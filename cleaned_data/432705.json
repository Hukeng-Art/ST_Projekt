    "text": "\n \nThe universe has a terrible sense of humor.\nCastiel doesn\u2019t mean to hope when he hears the heavy wooden doors creak open, but the chances of him getting a visitor here are slim to none. Zachariah rarely uses doors, and he certainly doesn\u2019t wear boots.\nUnfortunately, the human male who\u2019s walked in is a trespasser who\u2019d clearly had no idea what he\u2019d find. He starts with surprise when he sees Castiel. The feeling\u2019s mutual, Castiel thinks.\n\u201cHey.\u201d The hunter \u2013 for surely that is what he is \u2013 lowers his shotgun, but the concern on his face hardens into something far less friendly when he sees the sigils on the floor. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cIf you come in here, I will kill you,\u201d Castiel says helpfully. The hunter raises his eyebrows and looks pointedly at the shackles around Castiel\u2019s arms and legs.\u00a0 That\u2019s just uncalled for, so Castiel dredges up some strength to force his defensive scales to glimmer a threat. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d warn you.\u201d\nThe hunter\u2019s frown deepens, speculative gaze moving up the walls to the ceiling. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Phoenix doing taking non-human captives? I thought he was all about burning people. Human people, I mean.\u201d\nCastiel closes his eyes. If he concentrates hard enough, he can remember the feel of the sun and sky against his wings. He hasn\u2019t been in here all that long but Zachariah has been so very thorough\u2014\n\u201cYo, Isaac, you copy?\u201d the hunter says. \u201cFound some cells in the basement, one of \u2018em\u2019s occupied.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Castiel cracks open an eye, and the hunter pauses his talking into a walkie-talkie. \u201cWould you mind leaving?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Castiel\u2019s particularly upset about dying. It would be a relief, actually, after all these months tolerating Zachariah\u2019s poor hospitality. Not to mention the decades prior, but Castiel\u2019s not going to linger on that right now. Castiel\u2019s going to think about good things, nice things, the few and the precious that were part of his life, and he\u2019s going to carry them with him to\u2014\n\u201cDude, he been bleeding you?\u201d The hunter\u2019s annoyingly loud. \u201cThose scars are\u2026\u201d\nCastiel sighs. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cHey, this sucks for everyone,\u201d he says tersely. \u201cTwo families have been burned to death \u2013alive, and fuck me if that\u2019s not something to make you sit up and pay attention.\u201d\n\u201cMy heart bleeds.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d Disgust twists the hunter\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat, were you his competition? That why he put you in here? Disagreement on grazing rights?\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d Castiel manages to roll over, fixing the hunter with a glare that would have him trembling in his boots if Castiel weren\u2019t as exhausted as his is. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing, you child. You think you can stop Zachariah with that gun? You think that will so much as make him pause?\u201d\n\u201cHis name\u2019s really Zachariah?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and he\u2019s a Water Phoenix. Do you even know what that is?\u201d\n\u201cTell me.\u201d The hunter crouches closer, practically pressing his face against the bars in his eagerness. If Castiel were faking, the man\u2019s head would\u2019ve been ripped off. \u201cYou know what this guy\u2019s capable of. If you care at all about stopping him from hurting more people, tell me.\u201d\nCastiel looks up into his foolish face. There is fire in his eyes that makes Castiel wonder if he was ever that idealistic. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cDean Winchester.\u201d It\u2019s too easy on his tongue to be a lie.\n\u201cYou kill things like me for a living, Dean Winchester?\u201d\nHe hesitates, but briefly. \u201cYeah. Your buddy Zach\u2019s on my plate at the moment.\u201d\nCastiel wonders if there\u2019s any meaning in this, or if it\u2019s just his mind trying to grab some last comfort before he shuffles off this earth. Is it worse to die alone and forgotten, or to die in the company of someone who\u2019d be just as content flaying the wings off his back? A third option looms up: perhaps he can die doing one last thing of any weight.\nAt long last Castiel says, \u201cA Water Phoenix is not same as the Phoenix your culture is more familiar with, though their powers manifest in similar ways. What weapon are you using against him?\u201d Dean cautiously pulls out a bullet. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be enough. You need my blood.\u201d\nIt takes what little energy Castiel has left to crawl the few extra inches the shackles allow, stretching a hand towards the bars. Only the tips of his fingers are able to pass through.\n\u201cGive them to me right now.\u201d At the hunter\u2019s unhappy expression, Castiel adds. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, and don\u2019t thank me. I will be dead soon, and I shall be grateful for it. If you wish to do something in return, then once I\u2019m gone, burn my body. Don\u2019t desecrate it, don\u2019t harvest any part of it. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He rolls the bullets towards Castiel\u2019s fingers, which are still red where the scars have refused to heal over. \u201cYeah, I can do that.\u201d He watches while Castiel smears blood over the metal, staining them into usefulness. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cCastiel.\u201d\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Castiel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Castiel takes a slow, rattling breath. \u201cI\u2019ve no patience for that. Just take these and shoot Zachariah in the testicles.\u201d He flicks his thumb, sending the bullets back to their owner. \u201cThat was figurative, not literal. You may shoot him anywhere you like.\u201d\nDean accepts the enhanced ammunition, careful not to touch Castiel\u2019s blood when he loads his gun. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop talking to me.\u201d Castiel turns away, the hunter\u2019s pity worse to bear than malicious glee. Dean should just go on his way to kill Zachariah and claim his ashes. Castiel would kill Zachariah if he could; the ashes would just be a bonus.\nThe walkie-talkie crackles. \u201cDean, I got him in my sights. Where the hell are you, man?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d\nMaybe they\u2019ll get Zachariah, maybe they won\u2019t. Either outcome won\u2019t matter to Castiel in the long run, or even in the short run, because his fate is here, against these cold bricks. None of this explains why, when Dean opens the door, Castiel calls out, \u201cWait.\u201d\nDean glances back.\nHe\u2019s insane, that\u2019s what he is. Castiel is delirious and dying, which is why he says what he does to this man \u2013 this hunter \u2013 in the prime of his life, who probably has the blood of hundreds of Castiel\u2019s supernatural kin on his hands.\n\u201cYou need to shoot him from a distance,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cWhen he explodes there will be\u2026 It will not be safe for you. At least two dozen paces. Farther, if you can help it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d Dean opens his mouth, but then seems to change his mind. \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d\nThe door clicks shut, and Castiel\u2019s eyes drift back closed. He is so very tired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d\nDean didn\u2019t expect that to work. He hoped it would, but hoping doesn\u2019t amount to much in a business where the wrong scratch in the dirt could lead to someone going home in a body bag. Yet here they are: he and Isaac standing tall with all limbs intact, while the Fawkes formerly known as Zachariah is downgraded to a scar on the floor.\n\u201cYou owe me a drink,\u201d Isaac says shakily. \u201cQuite a chance you took there, Winchester.\u201d\n\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d Dean lowers his shotgun, and the pair of them slowly approach Zach\u2019s final resting place. That burn in the shape of a body with wings could be considered cool, as long as you didn\u2019t know where it came from. \u201cWe should get those ashes before the wind does. Can you handle this? I\u2019ve gotta go back down and finish up.\u201d\n\u201cYour call, man.\u201d\nIsaac\u2019s a decent partner but Dean\u2019ll be glad to get back to the Roadhouse. Maybe he\u2019ll get Jo next time, or Victor will finally stop being a bitch and call him. Ellen has a thing about solo hunts, i.e. only in case of emergencies; Dean can\u2019t blame her for putting that policy in place, but it does get frustrating.\nAwkward partner aside, it\u2019s been an easy hunt \u2013 as easy it gets, anyway \u2013 following the trail from the victims to the perp who\u2019d been hiding his pathetic ass in a fancy-pants mansion in the hills. Sounds like it could be a firebird of some sort, Ash had told them on the phone. Dean had been excited about that, only to be disappointed by reality: Phoenixes are less the firebirds of the ancient sonnets, and more middle-aged bald dudes in bad suits.\nWell, middle-aged bald dudes and sad, malnourished dudes like Castiel.\nCastiel\u2019s right where Dean left him in the underground cell, curled in on his side. The only difference is that his eyes are wide open and unmoving, with a thin film of gray covering his pupils.\nIt\u2019s pretty damn creepy, except for how it\u2019s also pretty damn sad. Dean\u2019s seen cells like these before, mostly used by Djinn and the occasional demon, though it\u2019s rare to see a creature use it on their own. Humans do shitty things to their fellow beings all the time, but creatures more often than not are happy to flock together against the rest of the world.\nWhatever else happened today, Dean can\u2019t deny that Castiel did him a solid.\nThe lock is picked easily, the rusty door swaying open with a groan.\nDean crouches down next to the body. \u201cWorked like a dream.\u201d The poor bastard\u2019s even sadder up close. He\u2019s not human but he sure looks like one, guy almost down to skin and bones. Zachariah\u2019s death was too easy. \u201cGot him right in the kisser.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a pathetic excuse for a last rite, but Dean has the feeling that Castiel wouldn\u2019t mind.\nThe creature\u2019s skin is cold to the touch when Dean rolls him over on to his back. Dean starts to reach for Castiel\u2019s eyelids, and that\u2019s when Castiel sighs.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Dean scrambles backward, heart pounding. His gun\u2019s out and ready, but Castiel doesn\u2019t move again. He\u2019s just lying there, making like a corpse and chilling.\nDean creeps close and puts his fingers over Castiel\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cOh man.\u201d Dean pulls at his walkie-talkie. \u201cIsaac, get your ass down here. Dude\u2019s not dead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel isn\u2019t dead.\nIt\u2019s an interesting turn of events, and if Castiel\u2019s mind can start its higher functions soon, he might be able to figure out how that happened. It takes some effort to open his eyes, and more effort still to wonder if a beige-white room with no windows is better or worse than an old brick cell with no windows.\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re awake.\u201d A young woman comes into view. She touches his forehead, which is a prelude to surprisingly strong psychic fingers forcing their way into Castiel\u2019s mind. \u201cSo your name really is Castiel. That\u2019s good to know.\u201d\nCastiel takes stock of his surroundings. The simple room has the feel of a basic medical facility, the bed he\u2019s in cordoned off from the rest of the area by an opaque curtain. There are sigils marked in spray paint around the bed and runes carved into the plaster. Castiel surreptitiously shifts his feet, confirming iron bindings around his ankles.\n\u201cThe name\u2019s Pamela,\u201d the psychic says. Her grip is business-like, checking his eyes, his ears, his mouth. \u201cYou hang on a moment.\u201d She disappears behind the curtain.\nCastiel is still trying to decide whether it\u2019s worth trying to sit up when Pamela comes in with Dean Winchester sauntering in right behind her. He is as Castiel remembers him: tall, fit, and affecting a grim expression as he takes in Castiel\u2019s pathetic state.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Dean says. \u201cYou feeling better?\u201d\nIt takes an embarrassingly long time for that question to sink into Castiel\u2019s head. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve stopped bleeding, at least.\u201d Dean\u2019s arms are crossed tight across his chest, his gaze assessing. \u201cFor a while we thought it wouldn\u2019t stop. And it didn\u2019t, not until we got you stationary. Was a bit of a tough one, it\u2019s not like anyone here has any experience with firebirds. Pamela wasn\u2019t even sure if we could clean you up with alcohol without the place catching fire, heh. But the bandages seem to be working, at least.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Castiel stares up at him in horror. \u201cI owe my life to a hunter.\u201d\nDean shrugs wryly. \u201cThem\u2019s the breaks.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely a kind of Phoenix,\u201d Pamela says, snapping her gloves off. \u201cLevel 3, I think. We can tell Ellen, she\u2019ll be relieved.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Castiel sneers at them. \u201cI\u2019m your prisoner now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean\u2019s eye drops to the chain on Castiel\u2019s ankles. \u201cThose are precautions. If you can tell us what you eat, maybe we can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHuman hearts,\u201d Castiel says quickly.\nDean gives him a look.\u00a0 \u201cBesides that.\u201d\n\u201cHuman eyes.\u201d\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t Pankot Palace, buddy.\u201d Dean laughs, as though this is funny. \u201cYou don\u2019t eat people \u2013 even Zachariah didn\u2019t eat people, he was just a sadist that needed to be put down. I read that Phoenixes burn their food before eating it, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s on the table for you right now. I could get some barbecue, maybe? Super well-done?\u201d\nCastiel stares at Dean for a long moment, utterly perplexed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Did you kill Zachariah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Worked just like you said.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re useful for something, then.\u201d Castiel feels a petty jolt at the way Dean starts in surprise. \u201cGood to know.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Pamela says loudly. \u201cThis is not helping the cosmic order of my infirmary. Castiel? You are not our prisoner, you are a patient, and you are not a special snowflake. I\u2019ve handled tougher creatures than you, and the only reason you\u2019re not in a cell right now is because Dean\u2019s vouched for you.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t ease Castiel\u2019s confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nDean\u2019s face softens a little. It is possibly the most terrifying thing that Castiel has ever seen. \u201cYou saved my life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou thought you were going to die, and the last thing you did was save my life.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a moment of insanity.\u201d\nDean glances at Pamela. She narrows her eyes \u2013 there\u2019s the feel of the same psychic fingers scraping through Castiel\u2019s thoughts \u2013 and then says, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s good. I\u2019ve got to let Ellen know, she\u2019ll want an update. Oh, and Dean? Clean this up.\u201d\nDean waves at her. \u201cYeah, yeah I got it.\u201d\n\u201cI take it back,\u201d Castiel mutters to Pamela\u2019s departing back. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s insane, it\u2019s all of you who are.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean knows what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s true that he\u2019d had doubts earlier when he\u2019d had to drag Castiel\u2019s sorry ass all the way back to the Roadhouse and Ellen reamed him out for not notifying her until they were already in the compound, but now that Castiel\u2019s awake, Dean\u2019s sure it was the right call.\nLevel 3, Pamela had said. That means Castiel\u2019s angry but not thinking blood-thirsty thoughts that would make him an immediate danger to the Roadhouse. Some creatures can be even more dangerous when they\u2019re weak, figuring that they have nothing to lose. Castiel doesn\u2019t read like that to Dean, though.\nDean gets a wheelchair from the closet. Castiel glares at him the whole time, and it\u2019s a good thing his creepy second eyelids have retracted, leaving the kind of clear blue irises that Hallmark card photographers would cream themselves over.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for a ride,\u201d Dean says. \u201cJust a short one, and I promise to do my best to not give you motion sickness.\u201d\nCastiel stiffens. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s boring in here, that\u2019s why.\u201d Dean pulls a corner of the bedsheet away to reveal Castiel\u2019s pale feet, still shackled to the bed frame. Castiel feebly tries to pull away but it\u2019s easy for Dean to reattach one length of chain to the wheelchair, and then stand back. \u201cI can carry you, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nDean raises his hands in surrender. He patiently waits through Castiel\u2019s internal conflict, the guy should be smart enough to weigh the pros and cons of refusing to go along with this. Castiel eventually shoves the sheets away, hands shaking with effort when he climbs down into the wheelchair.\nDean takes up station and starts wheeling Castiel. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\nAs soon as they\u2019re past the curtain, Castiel gasps. \u201cWhat is that? What is \u2013 is that a werewolf?\u201d\nThe infirmary isn\u2019t empty, and the sole other patient sits up sharply. \u201cI\u2019m not an it, thanks,\u201d Madison says.\n\u201cWhy do you have a werewolf in your premises?\u201d Castiel hisses. \u201cIs this \u2013 experimentation, torture\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cShe likes the skinmags Pamela leaves around the place.\u201d Dean winks at her. \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t make a single joke about lunar cycles or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in good hands, okay?\u201d Madison tells Castiel kindly. \u201cI know it\u2019s frightening right now, but it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cMadhouse,\u201d Castiel declares. \u201cAll of it.\u201d He mutters under his breath all the way to the end of the ward.\nOnce there, Dean pushes the door open and Castiel finally falls silent.\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous day outside. Dean looks up to the conveniently blue sky, and then kicks the ramp so that he can wheel Castiel to the ground. There are no windows in the infirmary for various reasons, but Pamela\u2019s spent the past couple of years setting up a nifty garden back here. It\u2019s hidden from the high-traffic portions of the compound so it\u2019s nice and quiet, which is just the way Pamela and most of her patients like it.\nCastiel\u2019s face is tilted up to the sky when Dean parks the wheelchair about halfway from to chain-link fence. How long had he been in that prison, anyway? His skin\u2019s near bone white, cheeks sunken in and lips cracked dry, but it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s his usual look and what\u2019s been forced on him. Still, there\u2019s something to be said for the way his eyes go wide and his fingers, though weak, clutch at the wheelchair\u2019s handrests.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Castiel\u2019s voice is a soft croak.\n\u201cHmm, what?\u201d\nCastiel closes his eyes, looking almost pained. \u201cWhat. Do you. Want?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Dean splays his weaponless hands out. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m taking a chance with you, Castiel. Eye for an eye, one time only. You get better, you walk, and we\u2019re even. That square with you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d Castiel stares at Dean. \u201cYou want to let me go?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not right here. I\u2019ll drive you out, if there\u2019s somewhere you want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTake out your gun.\u201d Castiel\u2019s hands grab at Dean, weak as kitten paws. \u201cI know you have one, you\u2019re not stupid.\u201d\n\u201cWatch it.\u201d Dean slides away from his reach. There is, in fact, a gun tucked into his pants, loaded with bullets of Phoenix ash that should work as good as blood, but that\u2019s just a precaution. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be touchy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop talking to me like I\u2019m a child.\u201d Castiel\u2019s a pathetic sack of bones, but his impossibly blue eyes cut sharp with anger. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have interfered. I\u2019m already dead, you\u2019ve just delayed it.\u201d He turns to the fence, searching for something beyond the trees. \u201cZachariah wasn\u2019t working alone. There are others on his side and they will find me and finish it, and they will be far less kind than a bullet.\nCastiel meets Dean\u2019s gaze, fierce and imploring. \u201cDean, I\u2019m asking you to be kind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean takes a startled step back. \u201cGeez, no! You survived that hell hole.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it your job to fix that?\u201d\nDean inhales sharply, arms tense with the punch he doesn\u2019t send Castiel\u2019s way. For a second Castiel\u2019s eyes are fearful \u2013 Dean knows what he sees when Dean looms over him \u2013 and then his cool mask is sliding back on. Dean takes a couple of steadying breaths, pushing down the anger that\u2019s clogged at the back of his throat.\n\u201cNot cool,\u201d Dean says. \u201cNo.\u201d\nCastiel shivers, tucking his shoulders in to make himself smaller. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there.\u201d Dean lowers himself to his knees so that their eyelines are level. \u201cI know it\u2019s tempting, but that doesn\u2019t work. Come on, you don\u2019t need me of all people to give you a pep talk, you\u2019re never gonna buy that. But there\u2019s gotta be something out there you want to go back to.\u201d\nCastiel smiles wryly. \u201cYou\u2019d think so, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d Then he frowns, as though just noticing Dean. \u201cHow did you deal?\u201d\n\u201cI was lucky.\u201d Dean shrugs. \u201cMy brother got better.\u201d\n\u201cConvenient.\u201d Castiel exhales sharply, sagging into the wheelchair as though force of will had been the only thing holding him upright. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the others find me. I\u2019d taken my leave of my brethren and severed the connection between us, but a tetherless mind is easily found by those who search for it.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Dean says. \u201cBells, ringing. You are a kind of Phoenix, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cA Garuda, actually,\u201d Castiel replies wistfully. \u201cSimilar and related, but not technically the same species. Zachariah was a cousin, the blood rule applies across the lot of us.\u201d He shakes his head angrily. \u201cWe are soldiers of honor, we\u2019ve fought alongside humanity for many centuries and it\u2019s like they\u2019ve forgotten everything. I hope Zachariah screamed when you shot him.\u201d\n\u201cSadly, he only cursed a lot and called us rude names.\u201d The tips of Dean\u2019s fingers tingle with the forming of an idea. \u201cThis all sounds really familiar, we might actually be able to do something with this. How long would it take for you to heal up?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has to be one of the most insane things Castiel has ever done. Second only to his leaving home, perhaps.\nHe\u2019s starting to hate the wheelchair, so Castiel distracts himself from mean thoughts by listening to Dean\u2019s commentary. This place is called the Roadhouse, which by Dean\u2019s enthusiastic descriptions makes Castiel think he thinks it\u2019s the most interesting place on earth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name of the whole place,\u201d Dean\u2019s saying above his head. \u201cMed block\u2019s in the back for privacy, on the left there is Bobby\u2019s salvage yard, and coming up here is the main building. Technically the Roadhouse is just Ellen\u2019s bar \u2013 that\u2019s out front, maybe you\u2019ll see it later \u2013 which was the original building before she expanded. Now we just call the whole compound the Roadhouse.\u201d\n\u201cWhere does the werewolf stay?\u201d Castiel asks.\n\u201cMadison? Oh, she doesn\u2019t live here, she just comes by once a month to get Pamela to braid her fur.\u201d Dean\u2019s head snaps around quickly. \u201cPretend I didn\u2019t say that, I don\u2019t want to get my ass kicked this week.\u201d Then, with a bit more seriousness, \u201cShe\u2019s a friend.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Castiel asks.\nDean snorts. \u201cYou just asked for sanctuary from a hunter, Cas. It happens. In her case, me and my brother got tangled up with her on a hunt. Stuff happens, Ellen comes up with a plan, she ends up coming by every month when it\u2019s teeth and claws time.\u201d\nSo although Castiel\u2019s first summation was right \u2013 that this is indeed nest of hunters \u2013he couldn\u2019t have guessed that the occasional creature or two may not be unwelcome. That is something to think about. The last time Castiel had any meaningful interaction with humans had been centuries ago, before their paths diverged and hunters took up arms against them.\n\u201cHey, Dean!\u201d There\u2019s a man pushing a wheelbarrow in the salvage yard, though he\u2019s put it down to watch them go past. \u201cIs that the stray of yours?\u201d\n\u201cJust giving him some fresh air, Bobby!\u201d Dean yells back.\nBobby raises his eyebrows. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look too good!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re working on that!\u201d\n\u201cStray?\u201d Castiel echoes later, after a harrowing adventure of getting the wheelchair up two flights of stairs to Dean\u2019s apartment due to Castiel\u2019s refusal to be carried. \u201cDid I hear that correctly?\u201d\n\u201cNot now, Cas.\u201d Panting for breath, Dean tows Castiel the last few feet through the open door and closes it behind them. \u201cSit tight, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nCastiel looks around. They\u2019re in a sitting area, a TV set up at the wall and chairs arranged in a haphazard manner. A simple kitchen area is on the farther side, mirrored by a well-stocked bookshelf on the other, and between the spaces of the wall are three doors. How much space does one person need?\n\u201cDoor in the middle\u2019s for the bathroom,\u201d Dean calls out. \u201cMy bedroom\u2019s on the right, the other one used to be my brother\u2019s so that\u2019s yours for now.\u201d He trails off, muttering about blankets.\nCastiel manages to wheel towards a side table to study the framed photographs propped up there. In one, a man and woman, obviously married, are holding a pair of children. Everyone looks happy. In another, Dean and a man Castiel assumes is his brother are sitting on the hood of a black car, seemingly relaxed and contented.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I got.\u201d Dean returns with a large leather-bound tome that he sets on the coffee table. Castiel\u2019s pleased to find that Dean has some civility, at least, because he snaps on a pair of gloves before opening the old pages. \u201cI was reading up on Phoenixes. Earlier, when we were still trying to confirm what you are. And I saw this thing, this story, and I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it at the time but maybe it\u2019ll be useful.\u201d He angles the book for Castiel to see.\nA few words in, and Castiel stifles a groan.\nCastiel shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This is myth to Dean but history to Castiel, and it\u2019s rather bizarre to hear Dean talk about the old rulers as though they\u2019re characters of fiction.\n\u201cSo if these kings could\u2019ve had Phoenixes and Garudas in their army,\u201d Dean says with increasing excitement at his own cleverness, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we use the same spell to link you and me? It\u2019s a mutual bond, right, going both ways? Heh, both ways. More importantly, you\u2019re off the radar of the bros that want to take you down, and you\u2019ll heal faster. That means you\u2019re out of my hair in no time and hey! We all go home champions.\u201d\nSo. Dean Winchester wants to get this stray out of his hair in no time.\nSurprisingly, Castiel feels calmed by this. He looks into Dean\u2019s hopeful, gormless face, and realizes that this is a man who prefers to think in straight, convenient lines. Of all the options, this is one of the best Castiel could have hoped for.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve described is called a nikah,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cDo you know what that means, Dean?\u201d\n\u201cGimme a sec, I got my phone\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt means marriage.\u201d Castiel watches that sink into Dean\u2019s head. \u201cThe spell you\u2019re talking about is a marriage bond. I suppose your books don\u2019t mention it for diplomatic reasons, but my brethren who\u2019d been in service of human monarchs were technically their concubines, though sex was not a necessary part of the arrangement.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dean is thoughtful. \u201cSo it\u2019s like a contract, then?\u201d\n\u201cYes, actually.\u201d Castiel had only been peripherally involved in the dramatics of that era, preferring to not get involved when his kin directly warred with each other. Raphael had been pleased to marry the great King Solomon, and not only because it gave him ample excuse to hunt and battle Gabriel whenever he wanted. Balthazar had married a Queen somewhere in there, too, though that had been more for recreational purposes.\nThat said, this suggestion is still better than putting Castiel in a box and hoping no one notices.\n\u201cIs that your family?\u201d Castiel gestures at the photos he\u2019d been studying earlier.\n\u201cHuh? Yeah.\u201d Dean smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother, Sam. Those are our parents. They died a long time ago.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Sam is your closest living relative.\u201d The photo seems recent, taken only a handful of years prior. \u201cWhat would he think of you getting married to a monster?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, do you sparkle in sunlight, too?\u201d Dean laughs at some unseen joke. \u201cLook, Sam used to date Madison, so I doubt he\u2019ll get high and mighty on me. It\u2019s only temporary, right? You said yourself that it\u2019s used as a contract. Just until you\u2019re healed up, and then we\u2019ll break it and never have to see each other again. So what do you say, Castiel, do you want to marry me or not?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the strangest proposal Castiel\u2019s ever received. Not that he\u2019s ever been proposed to before, but he knows the theory of it. Anna spoke of tender promises and touches, Balthazar had outrageous flirting in his, and even Raphael\u2019s professional marriage had involved long, careful negotiations of mutual respect.\n\u201cThis is,\u201d Castiel says slowly, \u201cterribly unusual.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Dean nods. \u201cWe agree on something.\u201d\nThe worst part of all of this is that Dean is right. He may not know the full extent of what he\u2019s dealing with, but he\u2019s right. This is the best chance Castiel has, for he won\u2019t be able to survive very long inside or outside this hunter\u2019s den without that level of protection. He\u2019d be a fool not to take this.\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll marry you. But we need to outline the regulations of the arrangement.\u201d\n\u201cFor that,\u201d Dean grabs his cellphone, \u201cI\u2019ll need my lawyer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sam arrives at the Roadhouse, he bitches at Dean for something like ten minutes straight about due notice and shoving things at him at the last minute and \u201cwhat do you mean he\u2019s a Garuda, are you messing with me\u201d. By then Ellen\u2019s already been notified of the whole scheme and gotten Castiel into her office to give him the third degree, so that\u2019s where Dean and Sam find him.\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d Castiel is doing his best impression of an angry caterpillar, glaring up from a cocoon of blankets on Ellen\u2019s couch. \u201cHello, you must be the brother.\u201d\nDean looks at Ellen, who shrugs and says, \u201cHe said he was cold.\u201d\nSam is nothing if not predictable, his mouth already drooping downwards as he watches Castiel struggle with the blankets to get his too-thin hands around the mug of hot chocolate. Dean shoves Sam forward. \u201cCas, this is Sam. Sam, Cas.\u201d\n\u201cHi.\u201d Sam kneels down, which means that Castiel\u2019s now glaring at him instead of the hot chocolate. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, Dean just introduced you,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cIs this going to be a day of redundant statements?\u201d\n\u201cBe nice,\u201d Dean warns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sam says, unoffended. He leaves Castiel to his chocolate and pulls Dean aside for a conference with Ellen. Dean can already see the excited wheels turning in the great big clunker that\u2019s Sam\u2019s head. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d\n\u201cHe does anything funny, we shoot him,\u201d Ellen says. \u201cSo no, I don\u2019t trust him, but if this spell does what you say it does, that won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\nSam pulls out the folders he\u2019d been carrying in his old man\u2019s briefcase. \u201cWe can start working out the details and check if there\u2019s anything\u2019s in the fine print. You seriously don\u2019t mind being saddled with a new roommate, Dean?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than the last one.\u201d Dean grins at Sam\u2019s eye roll.\nIt\u2019s not like Dean\u2019s ever woken up one morning and said to himself, hey, how about getting married to a supernatural creature today, that could be interesting. Yet here he is and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing.\nActual reasons aside, after they get the terms worked out and Bobby and Jo are called in as witnesses, the whole thing feels hilariously like a shotgun wedding. Here\u2019s Dean and Castiel side by side before Ellen\u2019s desk, waiting while Ellen double-checks her speech. As the boss of the Roadhouse, that gives her the authority to oversee this, though Bobby\u2019s still not convinced about any of this.\n\u201cWe still going to have the bit about holding our peace?\u201d Bobby asks.\n\u201cHey, Dean should get married if he wants to get married,\u201d Jo protests. She pumps her fist in the air supportively. \u201cRock on.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, getting married with a goddamn cereal box ring,\u201d Bobby grumps. Said plastic cereal prize ring, grabbed from the pantry, rests on the table next to one of Dean\u2019s silver rings that he\u2019s donating to the cause. \u201cReal classy there, Dean, you\u2019re going to be telling this story for years.\u201d\nCastiel looks up at Dean. \u201cYour family talks a lot.\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Dean replies.\n\u201cThe last I saw, my family liked to attack each other with swords,\u201d Castiel says. He doesn\u2019t seem to notice the awkward silence that follows. \u201cNot all of them. I have some cousins who are quite pleasant, though I have no confirmation they\u2019re still alive.\u201d\nJo clears her throat. \u201cDo you really have wings?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but they are shredded and useless at the moment.\u201d\nDean grimaces. \u201cI got the guy who did it, does that count as a wedding present?\u201d\nCastiel tilts his head up to shoot Dean an unimpressed side-eye that could knock him to his knees if it were coming from someone taller than four feet. \u201cOf course, Dean. It has always been my goal in life to settle down with a hunter who would offer me an act of violence as a testament to his intentions.\u201d\nDean pats Cas\u2019 shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, people, we\u2019re going to do this!\u201d Ellen exclaims with a loud clap. \u201cFix your collar, Dean. Try to look at least halfway decent.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Ellen,\u201d Castiel says primly.\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward ritual. Ellen opens with a dramatic, \u201cGood evening, everyone, we are gathered here today to observe this union between Dean Winchester and Castiel, under the rites described herein. First up\u2019s the bloodletting. Who\u2019s got the needles?\u201d\nThere\u2019s pricking of thumbs that are to be pressed together, and then the speaking of vows in a language Dean dutifully parrots back. The ritual only asks for \u2018tokens\u2019, not rings specifically, but according to Castiel, Dean\u2019s belief is just as important for the ceremony to work. Dean believes weddings aren\u2019t weddings without rings, so rings they shall have.\nDean goes first, sliding the silver piece he\u2019d gotten from some random flea market years ago on to Castiel\u2019s finger. Then it Castiel\u2019s turn \u2013 Dean\u2019s orange cereal prize ring is too small to go past his second knuckle, but Castiel insists that it\u2019s fine.\n\u201cAlrighty then.\u201d Dean admires his new piece. \u201cNew jewelry, check.\u201d\n\u201cSo by the power vested in me,\u201d Ellen says. \u201cI proclaim you married.\u201d\nDean waits. He looks down at Castiel, who stares back up at him in similar expectation. Dean had hoped that the mental bond would be unobtrusive but there should be something at least. Who the hell makes a spell without some fireworks? You\u2019d never know if you cast it right.\nCastiel turns to Ellen skeptically. \u201cAre you really the authority?\u201d\n\u201cYes, she really is the authority around here,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWas that really the correct ceremony or were you pulling that out of your ass?\u201d\n\u201cI did not pull\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFor crying out loud,\u201d Bobby says irritably. \u201cYou gotta kiss.\u201d\nDean and Castiel look at each other.\nIt\u2019s unfair to think that Castiel looks like death warmed over, even if he does look like death warmed over. There\u2019s been little improvement since Dean rolled him over in that prison cell, and it\u2019s hardly Castiel\u2019s fault that he has all the appeal of an aged, sun-baked frog.\nExcept his eyes, maybe. Cas\u2019 eyes are a pretty interesting shade of blue that\u2019s sadly muted in the bad lighting of Ellen\u2019s room, but they\u2019d been ridiculous out in sunlight. Anyway, it\u2019s not like Dean\u2019s lack of interest actually matters.\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Dean crouches down, not quite kneeling, and leans in.\nCastiel\u2019s lips are sandpaper dry. That\u2019s not the interesting part; the cool part is as soon as Dean lays one on him, something in Dean\u2019s mind moves, like a window he hadn\u2019t known existed quietly sliding open.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dean falls back onto his haunches in surprise. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like a sixth sense. Or a seventh sense, whatever. Dean can see Castiel right in front of him but he can also feel him, like a radio set to a frequency only Dean can hear. Castiel is a sack of bones on wheels, but he\u2019s also radiating waves of emotion (resignation, anxiety, fear) along with the white noise of hundreds of whispery thoughts laid over each other.\n\u201cThere.\u201d Castiel\u2019s eyes flutter closed. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\nThe mental bond is a new weight at the back of Dean\u2019s mind. This must be kinda like what Pamela and Missouri feel like all the time. He tugs at the bond, jumping when Castiel makes a sound of surprise.\n\u201cSo how is it?\u201d Sam asks.\n\u201cWeird.\u201d Dean prods at Castiel\u2019s mind curiously. There\u2019s a give when Castiel allows him to dip in, and it\u2019s easy to rustle around the topmost layer of Castiel\u2019s thoughts. There are no words there, just sensations, and although Dean can\u2019t parse all of them yet, he can clearly see Castiel\u2019s fatigue and relief. Then there\u2019s a tingling sensation when Dean feels Castiel probing at him.\n\u201cYour intentions are as honest as could have been hoped for.\u201d Castiel\u2019s face has lost some of its pinched look. \u201cI am agreeable.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Ellen slides the jacket off and tosses it over her chair. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, drinks are on me tonight.\u201d\nJo raises a hand. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Dean have to toss a bouquet?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll toss your face!\u201d Dean yells back, though she just laughs at him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel hadn\u2019t realized how badly he\u2019d missed having a bond. He takes care not to clutch at this new one too tightly, for Dean is still a human and a stranger, but its presence is a balm.\nThe real surprise is that Dean\u2019s mind is gorgeously vibrant. He is youthful and energetic and everything that Castiel can\u2019t remember ever being, and that\u2019s only what Castiel can see from casually brushing the surface. The moment the bond locked into place Castiel\u2019s entire being seemed to exhale in relief.\nPhysically, Castiel\u2019s now burrowed deep into Sam Winchester\u2019s former bed, but through the bond he can sense Dean\u2019s presence in the outer room. Good humor and affection lolls over Dean\u2019s thoughts as he converses with his brother, and just beneath that are feelings of wrought iron, fierce and protective. Sam is beloved. The strength of it startles Castiel, and he will push no deeper.\nThat\u2019s just fine, though, because Castiel doesn\u2019t need anything else from Dean. It\u2019s enough that the bond is there, which will allow him to focus all his energy on healing.\n\u201cYo, you in there?\u201d Dean calls out.\nCastiel\u2019s comfortable in his hive of blankets, which is a galaxy away from Zachariah\u2019s cold, hard floor. He doesn\u2019t want to move, and the good thing is, he doesn\u2019t have to.\nNo, I\u2019m not, Castiel thinks at him. I\u2019m just a pile of blankets, pay me no heed.\nDean\u2019s surprise tastes like mint: cool and slightly tangy. Whoa, that was\u2026 I can hear your voice in my head. \n\n\nThat\u2019s the idea, Dean.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be a smart-ass. Dean\u2019s footsteps approach the bed, and another layer of blankets are added on top of the ones Castiel\u2019s already purloined. It\u2019s different from being able to sense your feelings and knowing where you are. Feelings are kinda like\u2026 colors? Sort of? But this is like directly talking to you. Look, no mouths!\nDean is coping well to the mechanics of the link. Castiel had heard that some humans were adept, but he\u2019d found that hard to believe.\n\u201cSo me and Sam are gonna go for dinner with the others,\u201d Dean says. \u201cThere\u2019s water outside. You know where the bathroom is.\u201d\n\n\nI can manage. Right now all I need is sleep.\n\n\n\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Dean is remarkably chipper, almost buoyant in the aftermath of an event he\u2019d never planned. Resilience may be a virtue, and Castiel will honor his part of the bargain.\nThe entire ceremony with Ellen had gone so smoothly that Castiel wonders if this is part of his fevered mind\u2019s attempt to give him hope, and that he is still in the cell of Zachariah\u2019s home. He discards that notion swiftly; there is no faking the new presence thrumming at the edge of his mind, tugging at his thoughts with gentle curiosity.\nCastiel is starting to think that this might actually work out. This endeavor may be worthwhile, and he will be able to fly again one day.\nDean, Castiel calls out.\nDean\u2019s thoughts are on food, but he\u2019s listening. \u201cYeah?\u201d\nThank you. \nDean\u2019s mind titters, rolling away in attempts to brush off the thanks as unnecessary and unwanted. Castiel pulls back \u2013 Dean\u2019s brain is a kaleidoscope of language he doesn\u2019t have the energy to decipher, and for now all he wants to do is sleep.\nSo he does, slipping under as soon as Dean is gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a slow night in the bar, so Ellen takes a table in the back that\u2019s large enough for the immediate Roadhouse crew. Pamela\u2019s already done setting up Madison for the next couple of days, and is immediately on Dean\u2019s ass for not inviting her to the ceremony.\n\u201cWhat kind of friend are you?\u201d Pamela tries to grab the plastic ring that Dean\u2019s moved to the cord around his neck, but he quickly tucks it into his shirt. \u201cI miss everything interesting around here.\u201d\n\u201cHead\u2019s up for everyone,\u201d Ellen says. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping this under wraps. The fewer people know we\u2019ve got this guy here, the better. So for now we\u2019re restricting this to the Roadhouse and no further. Yes, Bobby, you can tell Rufus when he gets back.\u201d\n\u201cNice to know this is what it takes to get your ass down here from school,\u201d Dean tells Sam. He moves to ruffle Sam\u2019s hair, laughing when Sam jerks out of the way with a displeased grunt. \u201cAny hot students hitting on you yet?\u201d\n\u201cTotally irrelevant,\u201d Sam replies airily. \u201cWhat I want to know is what\u2019s going on in your head. Is it \u2013 is it like a built-in cellphone? Do you just hear words, or are there images, too?\u201d\n\u201cWell, kinda.\u201d It\u2019s easy to do but hard to describe. Dean can reach out with his mind to find Castiel exactly where he\u2019d left him, sleeping in Sam\u2019s room and practically dead to the world. \u201cI\u2019ve never wondered what it\u2019d be like to have a direct line to someone else\u2019s brain, but so far it\u2019s just\u2026 like having a third eye, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny.\u201d Jo chuckles under her breath. \u201cI thought if anyone were to marry a supernatural creature, it\u2019d be Sam.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Sam agrees, lifting up his glass to clink against Jo\u2019s. \u201cDean, you have just made that running joke officially obsolete. For that, I must thank you. Salud!\u201d\nThe Roadhouse is just made up of assholes, apparently, because there\u2019s a chorus of agreement and the wholehearted tossing back of drinks. Dean makes a show of being annoyed, but in no time he\u2019s cracking up and drinking with the best of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel sleeps.\nHe\u2019s vaguely aware of the passing of time, marked by the change of temperature and light beyond the curtains, but for the most part it\u2019s a long, blurry stretch of rest, punctuated by his occasional waking up to get a drink and check the bond.\nNo one barges into the room to demand explanations. None of his kin come screaming for his head. The worst that happens is that Castiel sometimes wakes up to Dean singing loudly in his head, usually about highways and/or roads of various sizes and allegorical meanings.\nCastiel hasn\u2019t been able to sleep like this since he\u2019d broken off the family link, which must have been a couple of centuries ago at least. He\u2019d told himself at the time that he could survive without it, that the pain of having to choose a faction and see his kin turn on each other was too great a price to pay for the inherent security of a bond.\nHe\u2019s not unaware of the irony of who\u2019s now at the other end of this bond.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re awake,\u201d Dean says, during one of the moments in-between when he\u2019s conscious. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in there for almost three days. I\u2019m not gonna judge, you do what you gotta do, but this is still my home and you\u2019ve got to be rank under there. I have a shower, you know.\u201d\nNo. Go away. Castiel pulls the blankets tighter, pleased that he\u2019s recovered enough motor control to be able to do that at all.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you need to eat?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice is coming from the foot of the bed, and Castiel can tell that his arms are crossed and he\u2019s trying to glare Castiel out from his nest. \u201cI don\u2019t have any snakes, but we can figure out something if you\u2019ve got any alternatives.\u201d\nSnakes? \u00a0Castiel starts in surprise. Ah, you\u2019ve been reading up. Actually, we don\u2019t eat reptiles, we eat the other kind of serpents. Namely, those who call themselves children of The Serpent.\n\u201cDemons? You eat demons?\nYes. Castiel doesn\u2019t resist when Dean probes his mind, checking for truthfulness. But we can go for many years, decades even, without feeding. It won\u2019t be a problem. Castiel lets Dean have some of his older memories, of when Castiel was younger and hunted with Uriel and Anna, flying free across the plains in chase.\nDean blanches. Oh Jesus, you fly.\n\n\nI thought you said you\u2019ve done your research\n\n.\n\n\u201cCould\u2019ve been metaphorical,\u201d Dean retorts. \u201cMost of the really old stories are.\u201d\nNow you know otherwise. What are you doing? \nCastiel\u2019s blanket shelter shifts wildly when Dean grabs handfuls and pulls. Relatively fresh air hits Castiel\u2019s nostrils. \u201cC\u2019mon, you can\u2019t stay in\u2026 Holy mother of what the fuck\u2019s your face!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m molting.\u201d Castiel peels a scale off his forehead and studies it. \u201cThis is a normal part of the healing process.\u201d\nDean\u2019s face is a rictus of horror. \u201cIs that hygienic?\u201d\nCastiel glances around the incongruous human bedroom. \u201cProbably not, but I promise that I will clean everything properly once I am able. Usually I am underground when I am in this state, for this is when we are most vulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you could\u2019ve mentioned something about that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Castiel insists. \u201cIt is like peeling off sunburned skin. Haven\u2019t you seen far more grotesque things in your line of work?\u201d\nDean stumbles to his feet. \u201cFor the love of keeping my breakfast down please stop talking.\u201d He turns around, firmly facing away from Castiel. \u201cYou need to have a shower and you need have it soon. There is gross and then there is shedding body parts all over my room\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought this was your brother\u2019s room.\u201d\n\u201cMy room!\u201d Dean yells.\n\u201cAll right, it\u2019s your room,\u201d Castiel concedes. \u201cI will do my utmost best to not leave any body parts lying around once I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u201cOh god, do you eat them?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, the nutritional value would be negligible.\u201d\nDean gags. \u201cNutritional value should be the least of your concerns, Cas.\u201d His mind has calmed, though, and his shallow-most thoughts are on a man named Jeff Goldblum who is somehow able to crawl on ceilings. \u201cWill you have a shower or not?\u201d\nCastiel sinks back into the blankets. Later.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\nI am a\n\n \nfirebird, Dean. I need to be dry until I am better. Who is David Cronenberg?\n\nDean shudders. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little downtime\u2019s good for the soul. Dean can still play his part from home base, no problem, though Bobby keeps grousing that Dean\u2019s \u201ccompromised\u201d and is \u201cunder house arrest for being a potential threat\u201d. Dean can see where he\u2019s coming from but he doesn\u2019t feel like a loose end.\nTrust and safety are inherent to the spell, Castiel tells him during one of the breaks between his epic nap time. I can heal quicker because my body knows that I am being watched over by another. It\u2019s not surprising that you feel some semblance of safety in the presence of the bond as well. It\u2019s nothing personal.\n\u201cAin\u2019t that right,\u201d Dean agrees.\nIt only gets weird when Castiel dreams. Sometimes Dean would be doing something menial like changing a lightbulb and he\u2019d be hit with a surround sound image of a desert, so vast as to seem like another planet, and somewhere in the distance there\u2019d be chanting in a language he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019d poked at Castiel for that, thinking the guy was trying to tell him something, only for Castiel to startle awake, panicked and confused.\nDean gets the hang of it after a while, though. Dreams are as fuzzy as cobwebs, and just as easily brushed aside so he can focus on stuff that needs to be done.\nThere\u2019s plenty that needs doing, too. Dean\u2019s already on occasional kitchen duty, general maintenance and helping Bobby out in the salvage yard, but case traffic happens to pick up in the fortnight after Cas\u2019 crashing the place. Jo and Ash end up having to take more fieldwork, leaving Dean to dive into long-distance recon and manning the phone bank. It\u2019s not as satisfying as going out himself, but it\u2019s okay. They do good stuff here.\nDean knows the Roadhouse isn\u2019t unique. There are other hunter hole-ups all over the world, but Dean genuinely believes they\u2019re the best. The Campbells\u2019 compound is bigger and has a killer library, and Gordon\u2019s place is stocked like a survivalist\u2019s wet dream, but when people want good food, a good time, and good info without being forced to trade unfairly for it, they come to the Roadhouse.\nEllen and Bill founded the place, some time before Jo was born. It started out a bar, and probably would have stayed that way if Bill hadn\u2019t died on a hunt and Ellen got on her damndest to prevent that from happening to anyone else. If only he\u2019d had the right info, Ellen liked to say; if only he hadn\u2019t been alone, and if only there\u2019d been others to turn to for help. Tradition has hunters staying isolated, but Ellen has spent the past decade plus turning that around. (Gordon\u2019s a poor copycat.)\nNowadays, only the bar in front and Bobby\u2019s yard are open for civilians. Everything else is by invitation only, but the bar is still an important fixture in keeping the place looking like a legit, respectable business.\nJo\u2019s hitting the road means that someone\u2019s got to man said bar. Usually they do a coin toss, but this time it\u2019s unanimously agreed that Dean will take over bar duty until such time as Jo gets back from kicking ass.\n\u201cYou enjoy it, though,\u201d Jo says. Tonight she\u2019s apparently decided to supervise Dean\u2019s prep work before leaving, because that\u2019s just the kind of caring person she is. She points at a spot Dean\u2019s missed in his wipe-down.\n\u201cI can never remember to be polite to tourists,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWhy do we even have to be nice to tourists, they never order anything worthwhile.\u201d\n\u201cBasically, any time you think about being an asshole, ask yourself, what would Jo do? And then do it.\u201d Jo slides a note on the table, smiling. \u201cNow make me a drink before I go. You will be graded.\u201d\nHalfway through preparing Jo\u2019s on-the-fly concoction, the mind link stirs. Dean\u2019s hands slow down so he can concentrate enough to reach out and check.\nDean? Castiel\u2019s groggy, but awake.\nWorking, Dean sends back. You finally getting your butt out of bed? Hallelujah.\n\n\nHow long have I been hibernating?\n\n\nDean drops a frilly umbrella into Jo\u2019s drink with a smirk and slides it to her. Almost two weeks. I gave up checking up on you after the first, the room\u2019s a freaking biohazard zone.\nCastiel drifts away, his immediate on his thirst and desire to get cleaned up \u2013 finally \u2013 so Dean turns his attention back to the present, apologizing to some poor guy who\u2019d been trying to make an order.\nJo raises her eyebrow, then nods with understanding when Dean taps a finger to his forehead. \u201cShould I go?\u201d\n\u201cNah, finish your drink. Might be the last decent one you\u2019ll have until you\u2019re back.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d\n\n\nDean, there are some things in the bathroom, may I\n\n\u2026\n\nYeah, that\u2019s for you. Towels, toothbrush, plus some of Sam\u2019s old clothes, though I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll fit. And please do me the favor of using plenty of soap, thanks. \u00a0Dean shakes his head.\n\u201cI\u2019m having second thoughts about this being a good idea,\u201d Jo says worriedly. \u201cIf you keep spacing out like that, people are going to notice.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slow night,\u201d Dean protests. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a TV on in the background, I just need to get used to it. And hey, see I just got that guy his drink, no problem. That okay, buddy? Right back atcha.\u201d Dean ducks his head to hide a smile when, through the bond, he hears Castiel cursing violently at the shower. Don\u2019t yank the knob like that. It\u2019s not an enemy.\nCastiel responds with the mental equivalent of a kick. I would like some privacy for my ablutions, thank you.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Jo says. \u201cAnyone who knows you will probably figure you got a free porn subscription and overdosed. Fried some of your brain cells.\u201d\nJody Mills, who had been walking up to the bar, stutters the last few steps. She glances from Jo to Dean and back. \u201cI want to ask, but something tells me it\u2019d be safer if I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Sheriff,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWhoa, someone\u2019s not a happy camper. Bobby left you hanging again?\u201d\nJody drops onto a stool despondently. \u201cI have no idea where he is, and he\u2019s still got my car!\u201d She dips her hand into the bowl of nuts Dean helpfully pushes towards her. \u201cSomething about giant spiders in Rhode Island, not that I can make much sense out of half a voice mail.\u201d\n\u201cGiant spiders in Rhode Island?\u201d Jo echoes. \u201cI think you heard that wrong, word on the vine is that the Campbells jumped on that.\u201d\n\u201cHey now,\u201d Dean warns, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about the Campbells here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so touchy,\u201d Jo laughs.\n\u201cI\u2019m touchy because I\u2019m related to assholes?\u201d Dean snorts. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m touchy. Sheriff? How \u2018bout I get you a drink and put it on Bobby\u2019s tab. That work with you?\u201d Of course Jody\u2019s down with that, and Dean gets on it.\nThe ladies happily get on gossiping about Bobby. Jody got pulled in with them through a case, which is how the story usually goes. Dean doesn\u2019t know her very well but she\u2019s tight with Bobby and Sam, so she must be cool. Dean still jumps whenever he sees a uniform, but he\u2019s getting used to having this particular Sheriff around.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Bobby went out to Rufus,\u201d Jo says. \u201cSomething about Okamis out of season.\u201d\n\u201cMan,\u201d Dean groans. \u201cAll the interesting shit comes out when I\u2019m on downtime. Remember a couple of years ago when you couldn\u2019t go anywhere without tripping over a demon? Now we barely see \u2018em anymore and there\u2019s all these other creepy crawlies rising up to the surface. All I managed to get was a Phoenix, and it wasn\u2019t even a real one.\u201d\n\u201cZachariah was a real Phoenix,\u201d Castiel says. He sits down next to Jody. \u201cNot the kind you were expecting, but he was still real. Hello, Dean.\u201d\nDean blinks, and then blinks again. \u201cUh. Where did you come\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThrough the door. Like normal people.\u201d Castiel makes himself comfortable on the stool. You\u2019re really unobservant. \n\u201cThis is Cas,\u201d Jo says. \u201cCas, this is Sheriff Jody Mills. She\u2019s new around here.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cI\u2019m new, as well.\u201d\n\u201cParty for everyone.\u201d Jody slides the bowl of peanuts at him, and Castiel pops one into his mouth.\nBy this time Dean\u2019s recovered enough to offer a weak, \u201cHey, Cas. You\u2019re looking better.\u201d\nCastiel nods. \u201cYes.\u201d Instead of being emaciated near death, he just looks like a guy in need of a bit of sun once in a while. He\u2019s also freshly showered, presumably minty fresh, and has damp hair that\u2019s sticking up in unruly spikes. Dean probably wouldn\u2019t have known it was him if the bond weren\u2019t humming in recognition.\nHis eyes are the same, though.\nJo coughs, and Dean shoots her a withering look. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a hunt to go to?\u201d What\u2019re you doing here?\nCastiel plucks at the sleeves of Sam\u2019s old shirt, frowning faintly. Pamela found me loitering upstairs and told me to come here to see you. \u00a0\u201cI was wondering if I could have my clothes back? Surely they weren\u2019t too damaged.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s really unhelpful,\u201d Castiel says mildly. \u201cI have no emotional attachment to my belongings, but surely you wouldn\u2019t have been so crass as to get rid of them without asking me first.\u201d\n\u201cThey have to be somewhere in the room, right? We can look for them later, quit your whining.\u201d Dean moves away to deal with a table order, and is surprised to find that he can multitask now. Castiel\u2019s right there, but his mind\u2019s also quieter \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a proximity thing. Dean makes the drinks while brushing over Castiel\u2019s thoughts, pulling the very recent memory of Pamela gleefully accosting Castiel outside Dean\u2019s room. Man, she\u2019s gonna get me for that.\nDean can feel \u2013 literally, thanks to the bond \u2013 Castiel look at him. She only said that she was sorry for not offering to bond with me before you did. She sounded disappointed, though I don\u2019t see why she\u2019d want such a burden.\n\n\nShe was teasing.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you know? You\u2019re not the psychic, she is.\n\n\nCall it human intuition. \u201cHey.\u201d Dean stops in front of Castiel. \u201cWhy do you smell like apricots? Did you use Sam\u2019s shower gel?\u201d\nCastiel\u2019s thoughts go cool. \u201cI find it very pleasing, Dean. There was little else in your bathroom that wasn\u2019t riddled with synthetic chemicals.\u201d\n\u201cOh great, you\u2019re one of those.\u201d Dean snorts, and then double-takes at the looks the pair of ladies are giving him. \u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019s got customers to handle. Man, it\u2019s so much easier to do stuff when you\u2019re here. When you were asleep it was fine, but when you wake up I lose focus.\nAn apology flickers across the link. That happens when you hold on to the bond tightly. Through no fault of yourself, of course, as you have no experience in such things. Calm trickles into Dean\u2019s mind like soft rain, a special delivery from Castiel. It\u2019s kinda cool.\n\u201cDammit,\u201d Jo mutters. \u201cI have to go soon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, do you think you could do me a favor?\u201d Castiel asks. \u201cI\u2019d like to get a nicer ring for Dean. We were quite hasty and I won\u2019t be content until I fix that. Could help me get something better? I can pay you back.\u201d Jody makes a choking sound.\nDean starts to laugh, and then stops. His eyes drop to Castiel\u2019s hand, where the ring \u2013 Dean\u2019s ring \u2013 gleams on Castiel\u2019s ring finger. He quickly rewinds the last couple of minutes and his gaze snaps up to Jody\u2019s face \u2013 he can practically see the gears turning in her head. Dean calmly puts down the glassware he\u2019d been holding.\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Jody clasps a hand to her chest, frighteningly dewy-eyed. \u201cOh, I see.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jo raises her eyebrows at Dean. \u201cHow about that, Dean?\u201d\nCastiel stiffens in alarm. What did I do? What? Dean, what is it? Thoughts of bullets and knives rush through his mind.\nDean rubs a hand over his face. When he lowers it, three pairs of eyes are staring at him expectantly.\nHe feels a little lightheaded, but it makes perfect sense to just say, \u201cYeah. We\u2019re kind of\u2026 not really comfortable being open about it yet? It\u2019s still so new, you know?\u201d Jody actually nods in enthusiastic understanding, while Jo looks like she\u2019s about to fall off her stool. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lots of other stuff to deal with, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I completely understand,\u201d Jody says. \u201cMum\u2019s the word. Does Bobby\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he was one of the witnesses,\u201d Dean says. \u201cBut we want to keep it in the house, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, yes, definitely,\u201d Jody says way too quickly. She grabs a handful of nuts to put into Castiel\u2019s palms, and then squeezes his hands. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\u201cUh.\u201d Castiel\u2019s eyes dart towards Dean in bewilderment. \u201cThank you?\u201d\nJody leans in to not-at-all whisper softly, \u201cMake sure he treats you right, okay? If he gets up to anything funny, you just run to Ellen.\u201d\n\u201cI will take that advice under consideration.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help you, Cas,\u201d Jo says cheerfully. She reaches around Jody to pat Castiel on the shoulder, and then shoots Dean a sly look. \u201cI\u2019ll scout a little when I\u2019m out there, then when I get back we\u2019ll go ring shopping, yes?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in the garrison, Castiel had had few chances to interact with humans as peers. Humans were to be dealt with deftly, and by those with the skill for it. At the time, Castiel harbored the wicked thought that there might\u2019ve not been much worth to that rule, seeing as it was one of Zachariah\u2019s favorites. That said, Castiel\u2019s had plenty of opportunities to mingle with humans since, and those encounters rarely turned out well.\nThe fact that Dean\u2019s only mildly annoyed with Castiel at the moment is a huge improvement.\n\u201cBut,\u201d Castiel says to Dean\u2019s tense back, \u201cWhy would she have made the assumption that we are romantically linked simply due to a single ring I am wearing?\u201d\n\u201cYou were talking \u2018bout weird stuff,\u201d Dean replies shiftily. \u201cAbout using my shower and your clothes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut I was taking your lead,\u201d Castiel points out. \u201cYou brought it up, so it had to be an appropriate topic.\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Dean makes an aimless, unhelpful gesture. It\u2019s probably meant to convey displeasure. \u201cFinish up so we can get out of here.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve closed the bar for the night. The others have gone off, leaving Dean to clear up the chairs and Castiel to wipe down the tables. Castiel had offered, actually, and though the task is menial, it\u2019s nice to be able to use his body after a long, pleasant hibernation. He\u2019d focused his energies on healing his human-shaped body first for convenience\u2019s sake, and so far everything appears to be in working order.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t in on it at first,\u201d Castiel confesses. \u201cI\u2019m referring to Sheriff Mills. I was mindful of what I was saying because there were others around, but I didn\u2019t know about her, specifically, until you started wailing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d Dean whips around to face him. \u201cHow is that\u2026 You\u2019re in my head! Literally! You have first class VIP all-access, how did you not know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t read your mind, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s incorrect,\u201d Castiel says thoughtfully. \u201cI hear your emotions. But I don\u2019t read the details of your thoughts unless you tell me to. You have a life that is irrelevant to mine, and as long as the bond is clear of any sign of betrayal, I am not interested in what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d Indignation flares across the bond. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cThen what the hell\u2014\u201d Dean closes his mouth. Is this?\n\u201cThat\u2019s more of a conversation,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cMessages that we actively send to each other. I don\u2019t go searching for anything deeper than that. Dean, you can tell when I read your mind, that\u2019s an inherent part of the trust mechanism. Like this.\u201d\nCastiel sends himself out, slipping through the bond to soothe mental fingers over the surface of Dean\u2019s mind. Annoyance and stubbornness cast a rusty scent.\nDean jumps at the psychic touch, eyes glazing over. \u201cI figured that was you.\u201d A blink, and then he\u2019s back to scowling at Castiel. \u201cWhat, you mean the rest of the time you\u2019re not listening in at all?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like that, Dean.\u201d Castiel\u2019s confused, and sifts through the events of the evening. \u201cI made an error with your friend, I apologize for that. I do know that there is risk to my staying here.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s\u2026\u201d Dean sends over an image of Sheriff Jody Mills, friend of Bobby, not a hunter but trusted. Dean thinks well of her, and she has come through for him and the Roadhouse more than once. \u201cShe\u2019s okay. She won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is what you\u2019re worried she might say,\u201d Castiel says thoughtfully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so careless as to tell her I\u2019m not human.\u201d\nDean snorts. \u201cA bat with broken sonar could tell you\u2019re not human.\u201d\n\u201cIs it the thought of her thinking you\u2019re married that has you so unnerved?\u201d Castiel knows that his aim is true when Dean straightens up sharply. \u201cBut you know its value is in honesty, not emotion. You were better at parsing that than anyone else \u2013 not your brother, not Ellen, not anyone. I don\u2019t see why any of that should discomfort you.\u201d\nCastiel jumps in surprise when Dean deliberately touches his mind. He moves with purpose, and Castiel follows Dean\u2019s search through his more recent memories.\nDean says, \u201cYou really do mean whatever you say.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d Dean says wryly, \u201cHumans lie. And exaggerate.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d Castiel says proudly. \u201cI apply sarcasm.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Dean shakes his head. Castiel feels, oddly enough, as though he has passed a test. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re mobile now, huh. We could give you more stuff to do around here.\u201d\n\u201cI would welcome it, but should warn you that I have limited experience with human technology.\u201d\nDean doesn\u2019t find that discouraging. In fact it has quite the opposite effect, and Dean\u2019s immediately pulling out his cellphone to show Castiel what it does. Castiel knows what they are but has limited experience with them, and is thus swept up in an impromptu lesson right there on how to make calls and send messages and take a photograph.\n\u201cOne for the road, yeah?\u201d Dean holds up his phone, snapping a picture. He turns it around and there they are on the screen, Castiel and Dean sitting on a table in an empty bar.\nCastiel is a little surprise how mundane they look. As if they\u2019re just two individuals enjoying each other\u2019s company.\n\u201cWe should get back, still-healing firebird creatures need their beddie-bye time.\u201d Dean\u2019s far more awake now than he\u2019d been earlier, though, humming with restless energy. \u201cMaybe we can start you in laundry. It\u2019d be a huge help, there\u2019s just all these cases popping up, an extra pair of hands would be really good right about now.\u201d\nCastiel follows him back to the main building, listening to him rattle and mumble all the way. Dean\u2019s emotions flare bright and warm, like sunlight in the cold, empty space. Dean doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s doing it, doesn\u2019t realize that his mind curls open like a flower, offering casual kindness and inviting Castiel in. It must be innate to who he is.\nHow to explain such a thing to him? Dean has no training. It\u2019s up to Castiel to pull away, which he does, forcing the bond to stretch thin and pushing stronger walls up. The bond quivers, resisting the unnatural manipulation, but Castiel stays firm. \u201cYou can work out the details tomorrow, Dean. To sleep with you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean figures that Castiel\u2019s an okay roommate. Sure, Dean\u2019s only ever lived with Sam, but he\u2019s heard things, like Jo and Pamela\u2019s epic clashes and Rufus\u2019 refusal to ever crash at Bobby\u2019s again under pain of death. So far Castiel has kept to his promise of destroying all the by-products of his cocoon time, and has not made any attempt to steal any of Dean\u2019s stuff.\nWhat Castiel is, is clean and unobtrusive. He flits in and out of the place, leaving little trace wherever he goes and making sure everything is exactly where he left it. If it weren\u2019t for the low-grade buzzing at the back of his head, Dean would have thought Castiel spends almost every waking moment hiding out in Sam\u2019s room.\nDean tries to get Castiel into laundry duty, but it doesn\u2019t take. Dean talks him through why sorting colors is important, when to use fabric softener and how blood stains are to be dealt with. Castiel listens and nods at all the important parts, but when Dean pokes into his head he comes up against a wall of disdain.\n\u201cPoker face me more, why don\u2019t you!\u201d Dean yanks the laundry basket from Castiel\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019re an accident waiting to happen.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t make an error on purpose,\u201d Castiel protests. \u201cInstructions are easy to follow.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who thinks clothes are unimportant doesn\u2019t belong here.\u201d Dean drags Castiel away. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you something else.\u201d\nIn the end, Castiel lands with Pamela. It happens by accident, when Jo and Isaac come back from their hunt with Dragon burns \u2013 from actual Dragons, what the hell \u2013 and somewhere in the middle of Pamela\u2019s arguing with Bobby and Isaac\u2019s breathless gasps from a bed while Jo holds his hand, Castiel shows up. He studies Isaac\u2019s arm for a moment and says, \u201cI can fix this.\u201d\nWhich he can. Castiel grabs some leaves, boils some water and does some chanting, but the real secret (which Dean knows because he can read Castiel\u2019s mind) is the two drops of his blood that Castiel puts into the spell bowl.\nI\u2019d prefer if you not reveal that to anyone, Castiel tells Dean. There are parties that would be particular about owning the source, if you understand my meaning. \nThere are other perks of having him around, too, though those trickle through bit by bit, and usually when Dean least expects them.\nSuch as the morning after an epic drinking binge with Caleb and his hunting buddies. Dean\u2019s in the kitchen, nursing a cup of OJ through his hangover and trying not to hate the world when Castiel comes stomping in, chanting, ice ice ice ice ah here we go in his head.\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Dean glares at the back of Castiel\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat do you even need ice for?\u201d\nCastiel opens the fridge without looking at him. \u201cI eat it.\u201d The ice tray is brought over to the counter top, where Castiel dumps about half its contents into a bowl. The rattling of the cubes is annoyingly loud. \u201cIce is considered an indulgence, even if water is all the nutrition I really need.\u201d\n\u201cAnd demons,\u201d Dean mutters.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a human being who eats herbivores that don\u2019t do you any harm so how about we not comment on each other\u2019s dietary needs?\u201d Castiel returns the refilled tray to the fridge and then turns to Dean. \u201cYou are uncomfortable.\u201d\nDean squints at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou are radiating discomfort.\u201d Castiel tilts his head curiously. \u201cAllow me.\u201d He steps forward, pressing a request for permission through the bond. Dean grumbles but stays still \u2013 mostly out of curiosity \u2013 while Castiel presses two fingers to his forehead.\nThe headache disappears. \u201cWhoa.\u201d Dean opens his eyes wide, startled at how the spots of light have faded away, leaving behind perfect technicolor vision. \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s like\u2026 magic.\u201d\nCastiel doesn\u2019t smile, but pleasure rolls through the bond. \u201cGlad to help. I shall excuse myself now.\u201d\n\u201cCan you do that if I have\u2026\u201d Dean trails off, trying to find a less gross way to describe the aftermath of Mexican food. Then he realizes he doesn\u2019t have to, and just shoves the thought at Castiel, who makes the most hilarious, scandalized face.\n\u201cI think in that case I\u2019d leave you to your suffering,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cAs a lesson.\u201d\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve just done that ten seconds ago,\u201d Dean points out. \u201cHangover\u2019s one of nature\u2019s basic lessons.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Castiel consider this. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Thank you for pointing that out. The next time you\u2019re paying the price for your drunken escapades, I won\u2019t offer my services.\u201d\nDean snickers. \u201cHeh, services. Never mind, go\u2026 enjoy your ice. But thanks for the\u2026\u201d He waves his finger in the air beside his temple. \u201cThat\u2019s nifty.\u201d\nMore mundane perks tend to involve Castiel being a goddamned creeper (to everyone except Dean, who can hear him coming). Like when Dean\u2019s in a discussion with Ellen and Ash about Roadhouse supplies, and Castiel shows up out of freaking nowhere with a cup coffee, leaves it on the flat surface nearest to Dean\u2019s hand, and then creeps out.\n\u201cPerks of being married,\u201d Dean says. \u201cYou should try it some time.\u201d\nAsh laughs and Ellen calls him an ass, but Dean doesn\u2019t mind. Cas says that he only does the random coffee and snack runs because he gets annoyed when Dean won\u2019t stop thinking about it, and who\u2019s Dean to stop him? Another bonus of the psychic link is that Cas knows exactly how Dean likes his coffee.\nYeah, Cas is an okay roommate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a little longer than expected because of events beyond Castiel\u2019s control, but he eventually manages to get a better ring for Dean. Silver, because the ring Dean gave Castiel was also silver, and decorated with a pattern of feather-like leaves and sunbursts.\n\u201cOkay, wrap that one up,\u201d Sam says once Castiel confirms that is his choice.\nThey\u2019re in a store not that far away from the Roadhouse, Sam and Jo acting as Castiel\u2019s caretakers for the day. Sam coming along had been Jo\u2019s idea, and Castiel had understood why when they\u2019d started going through the choices and Sam had provided helpful commentary on what Dean wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed to be seen wearing.\nCastiel\u2019s surprised by how important that is. A ring is just an object, but it\u2019s also an affirmation of an agreement that has been coming along stunningly well. Castiel\u2019s other body is well on its way to healing, his wings have finally sprouted new skin, and the only real price to pay is to put up with Dean\u2019s running mental commentary on bad soap operas he tells people he doesn\u2019t watch.\nJo pays for the ring, Castiel promising to give her clips of his talons in return, as they are notoriously sharp and can be used as weapons. Sam is enthralled by this, and insists that they have a meal together so they can talk more.\n\u201cHave you shown Dean your true form?\u201d Sam asks. \u201cOr is that really intimate?\u201d\n\u201cNot particularly intimate, just inconvenient.\u201d Castiel doesn\u2019t argue when Jo pushes a tall glass of something fruity at him. \u201cI don\u2019t see why he would want to, though?\u201d\n\u201cUh, because it\u2019s interesting?\u201d Sam is an inquisitive one. It\u2019s fascinating to note the similarities and differences between him and Dean, which are easy to pick out the more Sam consumes Castiel\u2019s answers on everything from the state of the marriage bond to Castiel\u2019s healing process to Castiel\u2019s adaptability to living in the Roadhouse.\n\u201cI wonder sometimes how the Roadhouse is able to function,\u201d Castiel admits. It\u2019s a far more comfortable place than others Castiel\u2019s lived in his lifetime, and Castiel admits to enjoying sitting on the windowsill of his room for hours at the time, but there\u2019s more to a successful community than that. \u201cThere is so little discipline in your everyday lives.\u201d\n\u201cI think what you mean is that it\u2019s not discipline you\u2019re used to,\u201d Jo says thoughtfully. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but you used to live in a hive mind, right? Shared thought and uniformity?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Sam agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s more than that kind of family. This is what happens to work for us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not part of the Roadhouse anymore, though,\u201d Castiel says.\n\u201cNot physically, no, but I still am where it counts.\u201d Sam taps his chest, over where his heart would be. \u201cDoes that make sense to you?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Castiel says, though it doesn\u2019t really.\nAha, lying to your brother-in-law! \u00a0Dean crows in Castiel\u2019s mind. Two points from Slytherin. \nCastiel resists the urge to roll his eyes. You do know that whenever you make a reference like that I have to go into your mind to find out what it\u2019s referring to, right? \n\n\n\u00a0You learn something new, and I don\u2019t need to do anything? Seems like a win-win to me.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking to Dean when you do that, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sam can be really excitable, Castiel thinks. Through the bond, he hears Dean\u2019s agreement. \u201cHow far\u2019s the range?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, there\u2019s been no cause to test it.\u201d\n\u201cOne of these days,\u201d Sam declares passionately. \u201cWe should try it out.\u201d\nSam has commitments at the institution he teaches at so they can\u2019t linger too long. They return to the Roadhouse together, and Sam stays just long enough so that Dean can be given his new ring. Jo jokes about how they\u2019d wanted to make a big production and Castiel has a moment of alarm because it hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind to make a production out of it and what if Dean wanted that?\n\u201cChill, Cas.\u201d Dean opens out his hand, and Castiel gives him the little box. Castiel watches Dean take the ring out, study it for a moment, and then switch it with the childish one around his neck.\nCastiel relaxes. Dean\u2019s approval is clear in how he allows the amulet and its new companion to fall outside his shirt, comfortable with letting others see it. Castiel\u2019s pleasure must be audible through the bond, for Dean smirks at him. \u201cDoes this mean we need to renew our vows?\u201d\n\u201cIf it would make your conscience feel better,\u201d Castiel replies.\nSam whips out his cellphone. \u201cStay right there.\u201d Dean starts to duck, but Castiel and Jo flank him neatly to grab a hold of either arm, and Sam gets his desired shot. \u201cHah! Thanks, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\u201cWow, I feel\u2026\u201d Dean shoves Castiel away, though he doesn\u2019t put much effort into it. \u201cVaguely disturbed that you\u2019re ganging up with them.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam says with a grin, \u201cYou might want to watch out for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean\u2019s freaked out enough when Cas discovers the internet, but that just gets worse when he learns there are only two things Cas is interested in using Pamela\u2019s laptop for: searching for pictures of old, dead things, and emailing Sam. He\u2019s emailing Sam, Jesus Christ.\n\u201cWhat the hell do you guys talk about?\u201d Dean demands.\n\u201cYesterday I told Sam about Madison\u2019s unexpected return to the Roadhouse, almost two weeks ahead of schedule,\u201d Cas tells him reasonably. \u201cAs she is his friend, I anticipated that he\u2019d to want to know that she\u2019s been having waking nightmares and that we were able to give her something for it. Next time, I expect I will tell Sam that you have voiced concerned about our communication, and ask for his advice on how to proceed.\u201d\nDean struggles with that for a while. \u201cFine, whatever.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Dean. You are also interesting.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d\n\u201cI was very impressed with how you dealt with those civilians Jody brought in yesterday,\u201d Cas continues earnestly. \u201cI have no patience or skill for calming others from such horrors, and have to admit that although I initially thought that there would be nothing of value from observing from your simple ways, I was wrong.\u201d\nDean clasps Cas\u2019 shoulder solemnly. \u201cNever ever try to praise anyone. You suck at it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not like Dean minds Sam having some influence on Cas. Anything that makes him less of a weirdo is all right in Dean\u2019s book, though even he\u2019s not expecting, a couple of days later, to come into Cas\u2019 room and find the guy doing honest-to-goodness push-ups on the floor.\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Dean\u2019s eyebrows go way, way up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d Castiel isn\u2019t even breathless, arms working smoothly as he moves up and down. Dean realizes he\u2019s never seen non-decrepit Cas without his shirt \u2013 he\u2019s bony and angular but solid, and there\u2019s a line of sweat that runs down the dip of his spine. \u201cSam recommended some routines that may be beneficial for the human body during my physical recovery.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause Sam\u2019s an exercise freak.\u201d A glance around the room has Dean noticing a mat rolled up next to the pile of neatly-folded (formerly Sam\u2019s) clothes. \u201cHe got you doing yoga, too?\u201d\nCas pauses in the up position, and turns his head to Dean. \u201cI think I might have been around when they invented yoga.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re older than dirt?\u201d\n\u201cCertain types of dirt, probably, yes.\u201d Cas returns to his exercise, amusement casting a warm glow over his thoughts. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean that as a proper question, but I find that I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cA harpy who does push-ups, now I\u2019ve seen everything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a Garuda, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cNames evolve all the time,\u201d Dean points out. \u201cYou\u2019re a mythological creature that\u2019s older than dirt and I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve been given a ton of other names by humans that\u2019ve seen you. Wings and beastly body and a human-ish face? Definitely a harpy. Or related to real harpies. I\u2019ve never seen one before but they\u2019re probably real, right?\u201d\nCas slowly moves into a resting position, sitting back on his haunches. Dean has a moment of: whoa, nipples, before being distracted by the way Cas\u2019 mind buzzes in confusion. Whenever the guy doesn\u2019t get something his thoughts become a whirlpool, swirling around in all sorts interesting ways as he tries to make sense of what he can\u2019t understand.\nDean may have noticed that because he\u2019d purposely made it happen. Once or twice. Or more, maybe.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the value of this conversation,\u201d Cas says slowly.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d Dean says. \u201cJo\u2019s gone again so I\u2019ve got to take the bar tonight. You\u2019re joining me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does your having work to do mean that I have to join you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s a better use of your time, and because no amount of push-ups will help your skinny ass.\u201d\nCas does a neat little forward-roll that has him landing on his feet, and Dean is not at all impressed. \u201cNot everyone can have your body, Dean.\u201d\nDean blinks. \u201cWhat?\n\u201cYour posturing is hardly subtle.\u201d Cas pats down his arms and then sends a thrum of sympathy through the bond. \u201cDo you believe you have something to prove? Are you compensating for a perceived flaw?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Dean pushes the door open. \u201cYou are so on bar duty tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that Castiel has to earn his keep in the Roadhouse, Dean\u2019s been clear about that. Still, Castiel\u2019s content to do what little he can helping Pamela because it eases his conscience, for there\u2019s no forgetting the place he\u2019s taken for sanctuary or the people who live in it. (But when Castiel sees for himself the damage they take, it\u2019s a reminder of how the world works.)\nCastiel\u2019s working at the bar makes very little logical sense.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking point.\u201d Dean\u2019s wearing his working clothes, as he calls them, though Castiel can\u2019t see the difference from his usual. Dean\u2019s also put on perfume. \u201cIt\u2019s called aftershave, Cas, geez.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that distinction is important.\u201d Castiel follows Dean into the space behind the bar. They\u2019ve not opened yet but Castiel doubts there is enough time for a crash course. He looks around, trying to make sense of the overwhelming number of bottles and pieces of glasses and \u2013 oh.\nDean\u2019s presence pushes into Castiel\u2019s mind, dropping names and context and uses to all the things Castiel sees. Squeezers, sealers, shakers, snifters, shot glasses \u2013 they\u2019re all there, some ready to use, some needing a wipe down, some needing to be checked.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Castiel opens a drawer and pulls out a clean wiping cloth. \u201cHow do you know how to do that, Dean?\u201d\n\u201cBeats me.\u201d Dean frowns a little in concentration and Castiel feels a slight tug in one wrist, showing him the strength and angle he is to use in wiping down the mixer. \u201cYour mind\u2019s wide open, it\u2019s pretty easy. You might want to watch that, though, anyone could just come barging in.\u201d\nCastiel tries not to bristle; he doesn\u2019t need to read Dean\u2019s mind to know he finds enjoyment in provoking him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be accommodating, Dean. You have no experience in these kinds of bonds, I\u2019m making it as painless for you as possible.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Dean grins as he checks the bottles lining the shelf. \u201cSeems to me you overestimated my need for kiddie wheels.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I said painless\u2026\u201d Castiel sends a mental flick at Dean.\n\u201cOw!\u201d Dean spins around and glares. \u201cDo that again and I\u2019m going to figure out how to do it back. Yeah! I see you worrying all up over there, just do what you\u2019re supposed to and try not to break anything.\u201d\nCastiel shrugs. If he did break anything it\u2019d be Dean\u2019s fault, since he\u2019s the one steering.\nThat said, it\u2019s easy. When the bar opens and customers arrive, Castiel needs only be a vessel, guided gently to and fro by Dean\u2019s instructions. Dean himself stays at the forefront, talking to customers and showing off his charm, while Castiel maneuvers around him in the narrow space, effectively acting as Dean\u2019s extra pair of hands.\nEllen drops by to check up on them. \u201cYou\u2019re really good that that,\u201d she says after watching for a while. \u201cReally good.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Dean.\u201d Castiel passes a bottle to Dean, who takes it without turning his head. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s a mild form of puppetry.\u201d\nEllen seems impressed, and then uncomfortable. Castiel makes way for Dean to approach her, moving out to the tables to clear up empty glasses and take payment from a customer. Castiel can still hear Dean and Ellen\u2019s hushed conversation, though.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that really intimate?\u201d Ellen whispers to Dean. \u201cThere\u2019s literally no way to get closer than that.\u201d\nDean, to Castiel\u2019s surprise, is not perturbed by this. \u201cIt would be intimate if it was you and me. Or me and Jo, or me and Sam\u2026 which would also be creepy as hell so let\u2019s not think about that at all. We have a relationship, so an extra level of mind whammy would make the whole thing way complicated and messy. Me and Cas? Have no relationship whatsoever, so it\u2019s pretty chill.\u201d Ain\u2019t that right, Cas?\nCastiel feels a tingle up his forearm. He returns to the bar and dutifully raises his arm into a high-five position, so that Dean may slap his palm.\n\u201cThat is quite the party trick,\u201d Ellen says. \u201cCould you use that for card sharping?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be dishonest,\u201d Castiel says before Dean can answer. \u201cI do have some morals.\u201d\nDean laughs, and then mimes a noose around his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s my ball and chain in action right there.\u201d Castiel sends an inquiry at Dean, and receives: It\u2019s a metaphor. For marriage, you know? That makes you the wife. \u00a0Castiel nods with understanding, which Dean finds hilarious.\n\u201cDid you really just call him a ball-and-chain?\u201d Jody slides onto the stool next to Ellen\u2019s with a laugh, nodding an acknowledgement at Castiel. \u201cYou might want to watch yourself.\u201d\nCastiel starts at the sudden flush of emotions that pass through Dean. It\u2019s a blast of hyperawareness and panic, and the rush to do something to cover said panic. That\u2019s followed by an equally abrupt (Fuck it) plummet of a decision.\nDean leans forward, hands braced on the bar top, and says to Jody, \u201cCas doesn\u2019t have any problems with balls and chains, if you catch my drift.\u201d\nCastiel thinks that\u2019s another metaphor until Dean passes him a helpful explanatory image.\n\u201cDean!\u201d Castiel yelps. \u201cNot in front of the patrons!\u201d\nWhich is apparently the correct thing to say because Jody all but doubles over in laughter, and Dean\u2019s mind hums with approval.\nCastiel can roll with this. It\u2019s a mere change of strategy, and far more agreeable than Dean having to deal with discomfort. Dean\u2019s a friendly person, warm and jovial, and it\u2019s only right he be able to continue to be so despite having a burden temporarily attached to his person. Ellen has no judgmental comment either way, simply pushing her empty glass towards Castiel with a nod for a refill.\nSo this is how it\u2019s going to be, is it? \u00a0Castiel asks. \nWell, she already thinks it\u2019s possible, so why not? I\u2019m totally a catch, aren\u2019t I a catch, Cas? Dean grins at him.\n\u201cOh, I see!\u201d Castiel exclaims in surprise. \u201cYou were lonely, that\u2019s why you asked me to join you down here tonight. You need only have asked, Dean.\u201d\nDean narrows his eyes. \n\u201cOh, that\u2019s great, you guys,\u201d Jody says happily. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be comfortable being yourselves here, where can you be?\u201d\n\u201cIt was Cas\u2019 idea, actually,\u201d Dean says, which such fake gravity as to be laughable. \u201cHe\u2019s the new guy, after all, he wasn\u2019t very comfortable being open and\u2026 of course I had to tag along with what he wanted.\u201d\nCastiel gawks at Dean in disbelief. Excuse me.\n\u201cLike I give a shit what anyone thinks about me,\u201d Dean continues insipidly. \u201cBut I gotta take care of this guy.\u201d\nCastiel stiffly hands Ellen her filled-up glass.\nHe can still hear Dean\u2019s mind trilling loudly with obnoxious excitement. Castiel has no choice, really, and turns to to address Jody: \u201cDo you really believe that? Just look \u2013 he refuses to wear my ring. He wears it around his neck instead. It hurts my feelings.\u201d Castiel turns so that he can fully appreciate Dean\u2019s shocked face, and then raises his own hand in demonstration. \u201cI\u2019m happy to wear mine.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Jody says. Ellen takes a slow sip of her drink.\n\u201cYou did not!\u201d Dean laughs. His thoughts are alight with the effect of adrenaline. \u201cThat\u2019s a low blow.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re only like this in public,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re an excellent spouse.\u201d\n\u201cYou should really\u2026\u201d Dean trails off. \u201cI\u2019m an excellent spouse?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are. You are immeasurable, and I\u2019m glad that it was you who saved my life.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve seemed to have amassed a small audience over the past few minutes. Castiel tenses up when he notices this \u2013 attention here of all places is bad \u2013 but that\u2019s abruptly soothed over by the purring assurance Dean sends to him. Most of these guys are friends, Dean tells him, and Ellen is right there, ready to kick anyone\u2019s ass if things get out of hand and besides, no one seems to think there\u2019s anything weird about Castiel at all.\nIt\u2019s just another night, \u00a0Dean says. This is nothing, you should see how Jo plays the crowd when she\u2019s in the mood. \nThen this could be good for the night\u2019s financial profits. Dean doesn\u2019t disagree, and is riding up his adrenaline into high spirits.\n\u201cHe saved your life?\u201d says a customer who looks like she will order another drink soon. \u201cDamn it, Dean, when the hell did this happen?\u201d\nCastiel tries on a friendly smile. \u201cHe proposed after I came out of medical care.\u201d\nEllen confirms this with a somber, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d Dean grins, basking under the attention. He knows most of these people \u2013 a hefty percentage of them regulars \u2013 and confidence makes him radiant, and as he leans towards his rapt congregation, new yarns spin wildly in his head. \u201cKnew something was special \u2018bout Cas the moment I met him.\u201d\n\u201cSo he says,\u201d Castiel says.\n\u201cYou gotta wear your ring, man,\u201d says a customer who\u2019s wearing a trucker hat not unlike Bobby\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s some things that\u2019re sacred.\u201d\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s near his heart!\u201d another protests. \u201cThat counts for something.\"\nUnder the sudden din that\u2019s enveloped the bar, Ellen mutters a quiet, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely clear on what just happened,\u201d that only Castiel\u2019s able to catch. She raises her glass at him. \u201cBut I guess it\u2019s your problem to deal with. Well, yours and your excellent spouse\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being facetious,\u201d Castiel says.\nEllen laughs helplessly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Dean says, leaning heavily against Cas, \u201cI\u2019ve never had that many chicks wanna fondle me at once. Sweet mother of Angelina Jolie I was on fire.\u201d\nCas has the best prissy face in the world, his head roaring a loud Do Not Care alongside calculations of what Dean suspects are the night\u2019s tips. Dean\u2019s arm is draped over Cas\u2019 shoulder as they find their way back to their rooms, and Dean stares at the side of Cas\u2019 head, amazed at how he can literally follow Cas\u2019 thought process through considering and then discarding the temptation to drop Dean\u2019s ass to the floor.\nDean\u2019s never wondered what it would be like to have someone else inside his head \u2013 Cas has been keeping a minimum safe distance until tonight, the scaredy-cat \u2013 but it\u2019s not so bad. Psychics poke around your skull like goddamn spies so you can never tell they\u2019re there until they tell you what they\u2019ve taken, but Cas moves around like a \u2013 like a submarine, letting out little pings wherever he goes and letting Dean see what he sees.\n\u201cPerhaps I should leave you to it,\u201d Cas says dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re comparing me to a submersible vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only a little bit drunk,\u201d Dean protests.\n\u201cOnly because I\u2019m holding you up,\u201d Cas replies. It\u2019s true, though, Cas\u2019 presence in Dean\u2019s head is a ballast keeping Dean\u2019s own mild \u2013 very very mild, really \u2013 drunkenness at bay. \u201cYou should have turned them down when they started offering to buy you drinks. It might not have been polite, but look at you now.\u201d\n\u201cI look fine. Don\u2019t tell me you wouldn\u2019t want to get into these pants. I want to get into these pants and I\u2019m wearing them. It\u2019s just so sad.\u201d Dean almost tips over in surprise when he realizes that they\u2019ve arrived as his door. \u201cThey were all over me.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have accepted.\u201d Cas pulls Dean inside and dumps him on the couch. \u201cI\u2019m sure at least one of them would\u2019ve welcomed your sexual advances.\u201d\n\u201cWhat in the what?\u201d Dean squints up as Cas locks the door.\n\u201cSexual advances.\u201d Cas has that stupidly solemn face that Dean would\u2019ve normally found useless, so thank goodness he can poke directly into that head and know that Cas is just voicing what\u2019s actually on his mind. \u201cYou\u2019re human, I\u2019m sure you have needs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s gross, man.\u201d Dean makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Dean echoes slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t do that. I mean, it\u2019s cool if you\u2019re into that, but it\u2019s not for me.\u201d\nCas is uninterested, plucking at the collar of his shirt and making a face at the smell. \u201cIf you ever change your mind, you have my full permission to go ahead. I\u2019m going to have a shower, you are going to sleep, and half the tips from tonight belong to me.\u201d\nDean opens his mouth for a parting shot, but Cas has closed the bathroom door. Cas also draws out of Dean\u2019s mind, allowing the night\u2019s exhaustion and \u2013 ugh \u2013 headache to return.\nYou know what? \nInside the bathroom, Cas trips. Dean doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying, but he\u2019s pretty sure those are curse words. Ancient curse words. Hey, Dean could learn them and annoy the hell out of Sam. Cas recovers with a prickly, What, Dean.\nWe should go for a drive. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got anything on your schedule. \nWhy would I want to do that, Dean. \nBecause. Because Dean\u2019s fixed everything that can be fixed and cleaned all his gear and Bobby threw him out of the phone bank room for being \u2018snippy\u2019 with an FBI agent.\nIt\u2019s cabin fever, that\u2019s what it is. Cas doesn\u2019t have a clue what that feels like until Dean shoves the feeling at him. Based on the few memories of his Dean\u2019s rifled through (what, he has permission), Cas has spent years at a time hiding in holes in the ground, so he has a poor understanding of that restless itch that keeps building and building until you just want to claw all your skin off to get at it.\nThere\u2019s no need to be melodramatic about it, Dean. We can go somewhere, if you like. \nDon\u2019t feel like you have to do me any favors, now. \nCas\u2019 cranky exhaustion is understandable \u2013 the little nerd must\u2019ve used up all his socializing quota in one night \u2013 but Dean still can\u2019t help feeling a little offended by his lack of interest. Cas did well tonight but he still thinks he\u2019s above all these wacky human shenanigans and is only enduring them for the sake of his safety, which is as good a lie as Dean\u2019s ever heard. It\u2019s hilarious how some people don\u2019t know their own minds.\nDean snaps back awake \u2013 when\u2019d he fall asleep \u2013 when Cas is back in his face, yammering, \u201cWhat are you doing? Get up, brush your teeth, I can smell you from over here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d Dean\u2019s such a nice guy, he doesn\u2019t even point out that before Cas came here, he\u2019d barely if ever brushed his teeth at all. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, not my mom.\u201d\n\u201cGo!\u201d Cas shoves Dean into the bathroom. Dean\u2019s still smiling when he turns to the sink, enjoying the prickly feeling at the back of his neck that\u2019s Cas\u2019 glowering at him through the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cI figured we\u2019d save Sam the drive and go up to see him instead.\u201d\n\u201cWould he appreciate the surprise?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not, but who cares.\u201d\nOne car, two people, two bags; Castiel can\u2019t help feeling a little nervous at the prospect. It made sense to agree to it last night, with Dean\u2019s anxiety and frustration bubbling over to cause his utterly appalling attention-seeking behavior in the bar. But now, under daylight and watching Dean whistling happily as he loads up the trunk, Castiel has reservations.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Dean\u2019s fingers slide along the car\u2019s roof slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s been you and me in the Roadhouse, now it\u2019s you and me in here.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll be right next to each other,\u201d Castiel points out.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Dean winks at him. \u201cDon\u2019t get any funny ideas.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s that, which is Dean making sport out of \u2013 out of something. It\u2019s more bewildering than anything else Castiel\u2019s experienced here, and the only saving grace is that Castiel figured out quickly how it\u2019s to be managed.\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d Castiel replies, \u201cIf anyone should be worried about the other\u2019s amorous advances, it would be me. I have heard terrible tales of the libido of humans.\u201d\n\u201cOh, hey now, having a libido ain\u2019t a bad thing. Even you\u2019ve got one. Somewhere.\u201d Dean waves vaguely at him. \u201cUnder there.\u201d\n\u201cUnder my two heads, six wings and tail?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, one day you should show me that.\u201d That statement is surprisingly honest, Dean\u2019s gaze drifting off into the middle distance as he imagines such a thing. Castiel can\u2019t help brushing over Dean\u2019s mind, pulling the imaginary yet not-completely-wrong image that Dean has of his true form. \u201cSounds cool. Come on, get in the damn car already, we don\u2019t have all day.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the point was we did have\u2026\u201d Castiel sighs when Dean enters the car. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d\nDean\u2019s \u201967 Chevy Impala had originally been purchased by his father prior to marriage. For a number of years Dean and Sam were brought up with this car as their only home, their family drawn into the hunt as those things sometimes happen. Castiel doesn\u2019t mean to learn all of this, but he does the moment he leans back in the seat, years of history seeping into Castiel\u2019s skin.\nCastiel turns to Dean in surprise. \u201cYou never chose to hunt?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean revs the engine. \u201cWhat hunt?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d\nNo, not never mind, you wanted to know something. Dean guides the car onto the main road and turns the radio on. What is it? Hit me.\n\u201cI can feel the history of this car.\u201d It\u2019s clearly enchanted, though not on purpose. Human objects do that sometimes, drinking up little bits of soul from those who\u2019ve touched them and ascribed value to their existence. \u201cI don\u2019t think she likes me very much.\u201d\nDean\u2019s pleasure glows through the bond. \u201cYou called her a she.\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks she\u2019s a she,\u201d Castiel admits, trying not to show too much discomfort. Dean reads it anyway, smile widening further. \u201cIt\u2019s only respectful that I refer to her as such. She has brought you and your brother comfort, and she has taken that into herself. The car remembers.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not haunted though, is she?\u201d Castiel shakes his head, and Dean sighs in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cA haunting would mean a foreign spirit entering her.\u201d Castiel runs his fingers along the door, tasting old echoes of laughter, along with memories of two boys shoving at each other and a father standing guard.\nCastiel looks up at the side of Dean\u2019s face. A careful touch to his mind reveals that Dean is enjoying the rushing wind and singing along to the radio, but from there his thoughts expand like spiderwebs into the significance of the lyrics, that time his brother made fun of him for knowing the lyrics, a movie he\u2019d seen that uses the song, the last time he\u2019d danced along to it during laundry day.\n\u201cYou place value on such things,\u201d Castiel says.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d Dean\u2019s relaxed already, elbow half-out the window as the car speeds along. \u201cYou wanna hang on to the good stuff. That\u2019s, like\u2026 basic.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s shallow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ve been on this planet for centuries and you haven\u2019t figured that out?\u201d Dean\u2019s wide-eyed stare of disbelief would last longer if he didn\u2019t have to watch the road. \u201cWhat have you been doing, living in a cave?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with living in a cave,\u201d Castiel replies tersely. \u201cStop devaluing me like that. Do I judge you for scratching your genitals in front of me? Or \u2013 or for deliberately talking about things I don\u2019t understand, or making those awful\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRelax, Cas.\u201d Dean does this thing \u2013 Castiel is sure Dean doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing it \u2013 easing into Castiel\u2019s mind and turning his tension around that he can see it for what it is and let it go. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, even creatures got their own lives, got their own... whatever it is that you do for fun.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean in between fleeing from hunters?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let that go.\u201d Dean is not apologetic enough for Castiel\u2019s liking. \u201cI\u2019m not in it for the brownie points and yeah, I\u2019ve made some bad calls in my time, but I\u2019m not going to feel sorry. What, you\u2019ve never hurt anyone to protect someone you care about?\u201d\n\u201cThat kind of thinking doesn\u2019t end well.\u201d Castiel thinks about Anna and Balthazar, wherever they are, and hopes that they\u2019re faring better than him. Zachariah may be dead, Gabriel may be missing and who knows what Raphael is up to now, but it\u2019s clear their time has passed. \u201cWe are scattered and few.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been that long since you last saw one of your own?\u201d Dean\u2019s genuinely surprised. \u201cI mean, one who didn\u2019t want to mess you up? That sucks.\u201d\n\u201cNot really. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d Dean gives him a pointed side-eye. \u201cYou wanted me to leave you in that prison cell.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not relevant.\u201d Castiel\u2019s discomfited at being the focus of Dean\u2019s scrutiny, but he cannot find the effort to kick Dean out of his head. He is getting complacent. \u201cMy initial decision to sequester myself was my own. I believed things were getting out of hand, and I chose to step away.\u201d\n\u201cThat takes balls.\u201d Dean\u2019s thoughts turn ashen as he briefly recalls early disagreements between Sam and their father. He and Sam are still shadowed by the threads left hanging by their father\u2019s unexpected death, though they try not to let it mar the rest of their lives. \u201cGood on you for taking a stand.\u201d\n\u201cCould you have guessed?\u201d Castiel asks. \u201cWhen you found me, could you have guessed that I was under arrest because I\u2019d refused to stand with Zachariah against your kind?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the strangest thing.\u201d Dean shakes his head with a grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know enough humans to make that kind of leap.\u201d\n\u201cI know my own kind,\u201d Castiel replies. \u201cI know what they\u2019re capable of. Don\u2019t \u2013 stop feeling sorry for me, Dean, I don\u2019t hate myself. I hate the conditions of the world that we have to obey in order to survive. Us or you? What logic is that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2026 I try not to think too hard about it. It\u2019s true though, I know some people who\u2019ve got it tough like that.\u201d Dean has a small, intimate smile on his face, while his mind radiates quiet pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, Cas. Harpy or not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re decent enough for a human. Most of the time.\u201d\nA feeling of warmth and contentment fills the space between them. Then Dean clears his throat and says, \u201cNow go watch the scenery.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a relief to get out from the Roadhouse.\nThere\u2019s no chance of Dean getting confused between this and old times with Sam, because Cas isn\u2019t like Sam at all. Cas doesn\u2019t know how to debate about the best assets of Scarlett Johansson versus Natalie Portman, or see the point of playing any of Dean\u2019s games, or even have the decency to fall asleep with his mouth open so that Dean can make fun when he drools.\nCas just sits there in his seat, quiet and observant. Scratch that, he was quiet and observant at the start, and then he\u2019d pointed at a sign and said, what does that mean? So Dean had launched into an unrelated but highly interesting story about how he got his license (they\u2019d still been living out of the Impala then) and Cas, having seen the opening for what it was, just took off.\nIt became a bazillion and one questions about everything, from why do you put your middle finger up like that to why do my shirts sometimes itch to why is it necessary for the men of your kind to wear underwear. \u00a0\nWhen they make it to a diner, Cas is still more interested in going Larry King on him than eating his fries.\n\u201cSo Ellen never officially adopted you?\u201d Cas asks.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been living under a rock,\u201d Dean says, \u201cHow the hell do you know what a guardian is? Or adoption, for that matter?\u201d\n\u201cI sometimes come up for air and education.\u201d Cas tilts his head slightly which \u2013 holy shit, that was Cas making a joke. \u201cIt seems unnecessary dramatics to allow Ellen to adopt Sam, yet make the runaround to avoid letting her adopt you. What if you\u2019d been caught? Then you\u2019d have been truly separated from Sam and then where would you be?\u201d\n\u201cYou already know I make stupid decisions, right?\u201d Dean shrugs. \u201cIt was tough when Dad died. Don\u2019t tell Ellen, okay? She probably knows already but\u2026 I kinda blamed Bill for what happened. He and Dad died together so we\u2019ll never know what happened, but I just couldn\u2019t buy that my father could go down like that. It\u2019s just\u2026 it was just too impossible.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve moved past that now,\u201d Cas says. \u201cJust look at you, and where you are.\u201d\n\u201cSolid praise comin\u2019 from you.\u201d Dean actually means that, and warmth echoes through the bond. \u201cNow eat your goddamned fries.\u201d\nCas drops his gaze to said fries. \u201cI keep telling you, I don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about need,\u201d Dean groans. \u201cIt\u2019s about having something just because you want to. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never felt like that?\u201d\nCas\u2019 brain hits a wall on that one. He tries to measure his experiences to Dean\u2019s, though that really wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cUm.\u201d\nDean shoves a fry into Cas\u2019 mouth. \u201cThere. Chew.\u201d\nCas goes a little cross-eyed as he tries to look at the fry. Then he brings it into his mouth, pink of his tongue flicking out briefly, and starts chewing. Dean watches Cas\u2019 mouth without comment, waiting until his Adam\u2019s apple bobs with the swallow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Cas\u2019 face gives away nothing, but Dean reads loud and clear that Cas may not be very impressed, but he\u2019s intrigued by the combination of salt and texture, and just curious enough to try a few more of Dean\u2019s recommendations.\nThe best opportunity would be dessert, then. Dean waves their waitress \u2013 Jamie, her nametag says \u2013 over, and whaddya know, they have pie in the house.\n\u201cOne for me, and one for my\u2026\u201d Dean looks at Cas. He\u2019s doing the poker face again, but inside he\u2019s bracing himself with a No, Dean.\nJamie cautiously offers, \u201cDate?\u201d\n\u201cDoes this guy look like someone I\u2019d date?\u201d Dean grins up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s my husband.\u201d\nCas sighs.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean\u2019s a terrible human being for loving this. \u201cI don\u2019t look like I could be married? Lots of bad-ass people get married. I\u2019m bad-ass and married. It\u2019ll be a trend.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s never going to believe that.\u201d Cas says to the waitress, \u201cI apologize, he\u2019s always like this. One slice for him and none for me, please, it would be a waste.\u201d\nJamie turns out to be awesome, because although she keeps to the letter of Cas\u2019 request, the slice of heaven she brings back to their table is super-sized and then some. The epic scoop of ice-cream is deserving of freaking rock-climbing equipment. \u201cBlessings upon this house,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just pastry,\u201d Cas mumbles, which makes Dean sputter.\n\u201cExtra-large, for the newlyweds,\u201d Jamie says. She\u2019s definitely cute, smiling at both of them in turn. Seriously, Dean thought he was lucky with chicks before he got gay-not-married but this is just ridiculous. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? Congrats, you two.\u201d\n\u201cI would\u2019ve done this ages ago,\u201d Dean says once Jamie is gone. They\u2019ve been given two forks, and he slides one to Cas. \u201cLots of perks \u2018bout this married thing, people keep wanting to give you shit. Do you think we could get a discount at a motel? I bet we can.\u201d\n\u201cBut then they\u2019d give us a room with one bed.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. Damn.\u201d Dean hefts a helping of awesome into his mouth, cursing when it turns out he hadn\u2019t waited long enough for the filling to cool. Cas makes the sound of the deeply exasperated and taps two fingers to Dean\u2019s forehead. The burn immediately subsides and Dean swallows. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll watch the next one.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you will.\u201d\n\u201cAnd!\u201d Dean scoops up another portion, blowing liberally this time, and offers it to Cas. \u201cDon\u2019t make that face at me, I know you\u2019re curious.\u201d\n\u201cNot enough to make a spectacle of myself.\u201d I realize you are an exhibitionist, Dean, but the best strategy is to stay unnoticeable. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t making a spectacle.\u201d You, Cas, are the opposite of unnoticeable. It\u2019s the weirdest stand-off ever \u2013 the bond makes it so that Dean can feel Cas waver, and Cas knows Dean can feel him waver. \u201cThis is being very appreciative of the lady who gave us this pie. You don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, do you?\u201d\nCas opens his mouth. He doesn\u2019t blink while Dean pushes the crumbly piece into his mouth, eyes on Dean as his lips close over it, then chewing thoughtfully.\n\u201cHey there, everything okay?\u201d Jamie says, appearing at their table. \u201cDo you guys want more coffee?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Dean cants his head at Cas. \u201cHe wants a refill.\u201d\n\u201cYou do know, Dean,\u201d Cas says, in a deliberately cool way that makes Dean\u2019s neck prickle, \u201cIf you wanted to hand-feed me you needed only ask. This whole farce was unnecessary.\u201d He glances up at Jamie, who gives him a sympathetic look. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful spouse but he\u2019s so shy about telling me what he wants.\u201d\nDean waits for Jamie to go off before he says, \u201cI\u2019m a bad influence on you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nCas effects a wide-eyed expression that passes for coy in his blank-face universe. \u201cOf course not, Dean.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second day out from the Roadhouse, Dean takes Castiel to watch a movie. They arrive at another town after miles of Castiel questioning Dean\u2019s choice in music and Dean being unable to define \u2018awesome\u2019 in any meaningful way, and Dean gets conniptions the moment he sees posters advertising a drive-in.\nCastiel is fully prepared to be skeptical of anything Dean sings praises of. Castiel has seen movies before, after all, and they\u2019ve been sitting in a car for far too many hours so how can a combination of the two offer anything new? Hence it\u2019s only all the more embarrassing when, after the movie\u2019s over, Dean goes quiet and embarrassed and fetches a milkshake from the concession van for Castiel without a single complaint.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a movie, Cas,\u201d Dean says again. \u201cI mean. Mostly.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Castiel accepts the peace-offering with as much dignity as he can muster. \u201cYou said that cartoons are funny\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMost of the time! Most of the time cartoons are funny.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and you kept making tentacle jokes so I braced myself for a farce and that is not what happened and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d Castiel shouldn\u2019t be sad, he knows he shouldn\u2019t be said, it\u2019s mostly fiction \u2013 those poor children \u2013 but apparently logic has no place in this.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\nCastiel takes a long, reflective sip of his drink, watching Dean closely the entire time. A casual coast over Dean\u2019s mind confirms that he\u2019s as disconcerted by the fiction as Castiel is, though he bears it differently. The movie makes Dean think of Sam and how close they\u2019d come to falling apart, though Dean feels bad for even briefly comparing that against the good fortune he\u2019s had in life. Dean has so much to be thankful for, and he knows it.\nRegardless, he could have at least warned Castiel as soon as it became clear what the movie was about.\n\u201cI dislike you,\u201d Castiel says.\n\u201cSo nothing new, then?\u201d Dean shoves at Castiel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll keep this a secret if you will?\u201d\nCastiel considers this. \u201cNo, I think I shall use this as blackmail material the next time I see Sam.\u201d\nDean tries to distract him with food, which is apparently a thing with him because Dean gets distracted by food and mistakenly assumes everyone else does as well. It\u2019s easy to indulge him, though, following him to yet another food establishment and letting Dean order for him.\nIt\u2019s a really good thing that Dean\u2019s interesting, or Castiel would\u2019ve started hibernating again.\n\u201cHey, my phone,\u201d Dean says about halfway through their meal. He glances at the screen and gets up. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nCastiel puts down his knife and fork as soon as Dean is out of view. It takes him a moment to realize what\u2019s off \u2013 Dean\u2019s pulled away from Castiel\u2019s mind, which must mean it\u2019s likely to do with hunter matters.\n\u201cOkay, just a small detour,\u201d Dean says when he gets back to the table. \u201cThat was a \u2013 a friend, there\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve got to do, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\nDefinitely hunter matters. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask if there\u2019s anything to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so there isn\u2019t.\u201d Dean frowns at Castiel\u2019s plate. \u201cWhat did those potatoes ever do to you?\u201d\nCastiel only relaxes when Dean opens his mind to him again, returning to their easy balance. They don\u2019t talk as much through the bond, Dean preferring to use his mouth (dirty joke, retracted) where possible, but there\u2019s bone-deep satisfaction in weaving close this way. Castiel hasn\u2019t done any of his exercises, or checked his wings and other feet, or even had a moment\u2019s peace, yet he is content. The bond must be doing its work and then some.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so needy,\u201d Dean teases.\nCastiel steals one of Dean\u2019s sausages. \u201cYou cry at the movies.\u201d\n\u201cSo do you!\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not human.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Dean drawls, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to stop using that bullshit excuse for everything. You like human connection, you lying liar who lies.\u201d He regards Castiel thoughtfully. \u201cIs that a side-effect of your Obi-Wan Kenobi thing? I mean, becoming a hermit, since you\u2019re usually mind-hived with your bros?\u201d\nAs with all of Dean\u2019s remarkable observations, Castiel has to take a moment to collect himself. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re more important than you are.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, though.\u201d Dean pokes at Castiel\u2019s nose with a straw. \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to be alone, and yet you chose to be. That\u2019s gotta fuck with your head.\u201d\n\u201cOn occasion,\u201d Castiel admits, \u201cBut the alternative is worse. You are\u2026 very different from what I\u2019m used to, but there\u2019s no burden in being bonded to you, no expectations for me to deliver. I am bonded, but free.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m like junk food. Or candy.\u201d Dean is amused, though. \u201cYeah, you look like a guy who hasn\u2019t had enough candy in your life.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, one who has had too much.\u201d\nCastiel hadn\u2019t even realized how good things were \u2013 and they are good \u2013 until he messes it up. When he looks back afterward, he\u2019s surprised it took so long to happen, since he\u2019s been married to Dean past yet another moon and Castiel can barely recall the last time he\u2019d been in someone\u2019s company that long without tragedy.\nIt happens later that night, after Dean\u2019s insisted on driving to another town on his important detour and they\u2019ve settled into a motel room. Castiel appreciates the utilitarian design of these rooms but is surprised to find that he has standards now; Dean\u2019s rooms have advantages these rooms do not. (Dean finds this hilarious when Castiel shares this observation.)\nThey get a room with two beds as usual. Dean collapses into his almost immediately, leaving Castiel to set their things aside properly and turn off the lights.\nCastiel doesn\u2019t need as much sleep now that his intense healing period is over, so he spends his time inspecting his wings and doing easy exercises on the floor, careful to not make any noise that would disturb Dean. There is merit to Sam\u2019s recommendations \u2013 there is something almost meditational about putting the human body through its paces.\nIt\u2019s the darkest hours of the morning when Dean stirs. It\u2019s subtle at first, little more than a scrape at the back of Castiel\u2019s mind. Then it slowly builds up, insistent as a growing heartbeat, as though wanting Castiel to notice it.\nIt\u2019s similar to other times Castiel\u2019s heard Dean\u2019s craving for food or coffee. They\u2019d be on opposite sides of the Roadhouse doing completely unrelated things, and then Castiel would feel a sliver of Dean\u2019s yearning slip into his consciousness. It\u2019d be ignorable at first, but slowly build up until Castiel would be left wondering why on Earth Dean couldn\u2019t just stop whatever it is he\u2019s doing to get the damn coffee that would make him stop being so unhappy.\nThis is sort of like that.\nMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re in close proximity now. Maybe it\u2019s because Castiel\u2019s only very recently started delving deeper into Dean\u2019s mind, and that closeness has resulted in hypersensitivity to things he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have noticed. Castiel definitely notices now: Dean is aroused.\nDean is aroused and frustrated. He\u2019s dreaming something pleasant but unfulfilling, murmuring in his sleep and moving gently against the mattress. Castiel should ignore it as he does everything that\u2019s none of his business, but when the minutes tick by, it becomes apparent that Dean\u2019s discomfort will not go away by will alone.\nAnd, thanks to the current state of their marriage bond, Dean\u2019s distress is Castiel\u2019s distress.\n\u201cDean.\u201d Castiel approaches Dean\u2019s bed slowly. He resists the urge to scratch his arms; Dean\u2019s frustration bleeds through like a disease. \u201cDean. Dean?\u201d\n\u201cWh-what.\u201d Dean flails, stuttering into awareness. He has his gun in his hand before his eyes are open, but he lowers it when he sees it\u2019s Castiel. \u201cCas\u2014what?\u201d His arousal simmers, unfulfilled and searching.\n\u201cI can help you.\u201d Castiel touches Dean\u2019s arm. His skin is warm under Castiel\u2019s palm, and the touch isn\u2019t displeasing at all. \u201cYou\u2019re frustrated and it\u2019s hurting you, I could\u2014\u201d\nDean\u2019s mind slams up a wall. The force of it is almost physical, ramming into Castiel like a boulder to the face.\nCastiel hisses, clutching his head. \u201cDean, what\u2014\u201d\nSTAY OUT Dean screams across the bond, anger and shame whitening out Castiel\u2019s vision. STAY OUT STAY OUT STAY OUT\n\u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d Castiel yells over the pounding in his head. \u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\nHe hasn\u2019t attempted to fly since the day Dean let him go, but he does so now, tucking his human body in and fleeing the room. Castiel just needs to get away, get away, stay out, flying blind until his hearing and vision return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay three doesn\u2019t start out so well. Dean wakes up irritated, and that irritation only amps up to 11 when he remembers what happened.\nCastiel is not in the room. The intrusive little chicken shit is probably hiding somewhere quivering, because seriously, what the fuck. Dean feels gross all over, which is a terrible feeling to have first thing in the morning.\nThere\u2019s a chicken sandwich on the bedside table, still warm and smelling of the grill. There\u2019s also a tall cup of coffee. Dean sits up to glare at them, and then notices the small note taped to the cup: This is for you. FYI, I did not steal money from your wallet, I got them on my own.\n\u201cSure you did.\u201d Dean eats the sandwich, because there\u2019s no point wasting perfectly good food.\nThe asswipe that is Cas doesn\u2019t show his stupid mug the whole morning, not even after Dean\u2019s brushed his teeth and gotten dressed and finished up the coffee. Dean could find him, of course, but Cas really should just stew in his own juices for a while.\nDid Cas really offer to have sex with him last night? Jesus.\nI\u2019m checking out and going to the car. Get your shit and be there in fifteen. \nCas is at the Impala when Dean gets there, duffel over his shoulder and the epic blank face out in full force. He doesn\u2019t so much as peek into Dean\u2019s head, seemingly content to stay in his own, and just gets into the car when Dean grunts at him.\nWell, two can play at that game.\nFor the first hour or so, there\u2019s just silence. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s great, the radio fills the space with much more interesting sounds than Cas could ever come up with \u2013 which is a line of thought that unfortunately comes back to the fact that Cas offered to have sex with him, which Dean should not be thinking about.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Cas won\u2019t hear him thinking about it, Dean still shouldn\u2019t think about it. Because down that path lies madness.\n\u201cDean, I\u2019m sorry I invaded your privacy,\u201d Cas says.\n\u201cAha!\u201d Dean exclaims. \u201cI win! You spoke first.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you win,\u201d Cas says, way too agreeably. It makes Dean irritated all over again. \u201cI apologize, I won\u2019t talk about it anymore. Can we put that aside and move on?\u201d\nAnd Dean would agree with that, except he\u2019s starting to suspect that Cas thinks he\u2019s mad at him for the wrong reason. It\u2019s not like Dean\u2019s never been in a situation like this before. Years of living in tight quarters with Dad and Sam have taught him ways to compartmentalize because there\u2019s only so much limited-living-space trauma to go around.\n\u201cCas, you and me,\u201d Dean says, \u201cThis whole\u2026 arrangement, it\u2019s all good, right? You said so yourself? Nothing personal.\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\n\u201cThen why the hell would you suggest sleeping with me?\u201d\nIt\u2019d be nice if Cas said that it\u2019s because Dean\u2019s hot (which he is), but it\u2019s no surprise whatsoever that the feathery dickhead just goes, \u201cBecause you were uncomfortable, and I was available to help.\u201d\nWhich means that Cas would\u2019ve offered it to anyone. Dean kinda wants to throw up. \u201cCas. You\u2019ve never had sex before.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a drive-in before either,\u201d Cas replies. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not open to the experience.\n\u201cDude. A drive-in is not the same thing as sex.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, why not, because it\u2019s not!\u201d\nThere\u2019s a loud thump \u2013 Cas knocking his head against the window in his exasperation. \u201cEvery time I think I have a handle on you\u2026 You get upset when I don\u2019t read your mind, and then you get upset when I do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s different!\u201d\n\u201cLike enjoying a movie with you is different from having sex with you?\u201d That might be a vein throbbing in Castiel\u2019s temple. \u201cHow? Tell me how, Dean, because all I can see is that both are activities that make you happy, and for some reason beyond my comprehension, I like making you happy!\u201d\nThe jolt of surprise that Cas cares at all what Dean thinks is knocked sideways with the sudden realization: \u201cCas. Are you saying that everything we\u2019ve been doing, you let me do it because you thought I\u2019d like it?\u201d Goosebumps crawl up Dean\u2019s arms. \u201cDo you have any idea how creepy that is?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be nice!\u201d\n\u201cThat is not being nice!\u201d Dean yells. \u201cI\u2019m a person, Cas, not a \u2013 not a game you earn points on! Look, sex is totally great, you should get on it, I can hook you up if you want, but it\u2019d be a good to, oh I don\u2019t know, only do it if you want to.\u201d\n\u201cAll I hear,\u201d Cas says, voice dry as dust, \u201cIs a petty little man going on about how this is all wrong without a single useful explanation why.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some things you just know, okay?\u201d\n\u201cJust know?\u201d Cas echoes dubiously. \u201cShall I tell you what I know? I know that you\u2019re bored and need to amuse yourself. I know that you have brought me along because you have no choice. I may understand and empathize, Dean Winchester, but for your information I am not a pet, and I am not here for your entertainment.\u201d\nA flush of anger rushes through Dean. \u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you can lie to me!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one who keeps lying\u2014\u201d\nThe argument ends there because it\u2019s hard to argue when you\u2019re hit with the urge to throw up your guts. Dean doubles over in pain, nausea balling up so high in his stomach that it\u2019s a miracle he manages to hit the brakes and get the Impala to the side to safety. Cas, for his part, slams his body against the door and lets out a high-pitched yelp of distress.\n\n\nWhat in the fucking fuck my stomach fuck.\n\n\n\n\nThe bond. We can\u2019t hurt each other. Or harbor the intent to hurt each other. Stop thinking bad thoughts.\n\n\nYou first, asshole. \nThey spend a few minutes breathing slowly. A couple of cars go by, one of them honking as it goes.\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be best,\u201d Cas croaks thickly, \u201cIf we continue without comment.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d Dean shakes his head rapidly, willing the spots of light out of his eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d\nSilence settles in the car.\nDean focuses all his energy on driving. Once or twice he\u2019s tempted to steal something from Cas\u2019 head, but he gets over it quick. Cas is stonewalling him and that\u2019s just fine, that\u2019s just perfect, it\u2019s much more pleasant this way.\nCas thinks Dean thinks of him as a pet? Seriously? Do many pets in Cas\u2019 universe think it\u2019s standard operating procedure to roll over like that? Dean shudders.\nDean didn\u2019t even know that Cas was capable of having interest in sex. He\u2019s just so tightly wound, so non-human. He doesn\u2019t pay much attention to eating, for chrissakes.\nBut Cas does like trying new stuff no matter how much he says he doesn\u2019t. To translate that into bed could\u2019ve been interesting. He\u2019d be pliant, wouldn\u2019t he? No, not pliant, he\u2019d be curious and surprised, then annoyed the hornier he gets because he wouldn\u2019t know how to get off, and he\u2019d yell at Dean to tell him what to do, damn you and would that healing mojo he has mean that they could have multiple orgasms?\nWow. Dean really needs to get laid if he\u2019s starting to think about Cas and orgasms at the same time.\nWhich Dean is definitely not going to continue thinking about.\nIt\u2019s a really good thing Cas is too angry to listen in right now, is all. Cas hasn\u2019t even tried to listen in since last night, which doesn\u2019t really matter anyway because now Dean knows how to kick him out if he tries anything.\nThey make it to the rendezvous point without incident, barring the one time Dean turned up the music really loud because Cas\u2019 breathing was getting on his nerves, and Cas broke the player by glaring at it. Dean would\u2019ve yelled at him but he liked the non-conversation.\nThey check into a new motel without a word. Cas petulantly wanders off with his key for who the hell knows what, and Dean calls Victor to let him know he made it.\nIt\u2019s a relief to be able to switch into hunt mode. Hunts are easy, and god knows how Dean\u2019s been craving one.\nHe and Victor meet up at the closest diner, agreeing to discuss the case over a meal. Victor\u2019s face makes it clear that he isn\u2019t in a joking mood, and he opens the festivities with, \u201cYou were the only one this way. Ellen mentioned you\u2019re on downtime but no one else was available.\u201d\n\u201cYou made the right call,\u201d Dean says. \u201cSucks about that friend of yours. Still in ICU?\u201d\n\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Victor grunts. \u201cHeard about that brush you had with a Phoenix. Didn\u2019t know those were real, that wasn\u2019t in the handbook.\u201d\nCas appears at their table. \u201cLife would be much easier if there was a handbook, yes.\u201d\nDean jumps. \u201cThe hell!\u201d At least Cas walked there like a normal person, but that\u2019s a poor consolation. \u201cWarn a guy, why don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cNot my fault you\u2019re not listening,\u201d Cas replies brusquely. \u201cI\u2019m here because I need money. It\u2019s possible that I\u2019ll be on my own for a day or so with you being away for business.\u201d He nods at Victor. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d Victor says slowly.\n\u201cWhat, I thought you\u2019re all about being independent,\u201d Dean tosses back at him. \u201cBig boy, can take care of yourself?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you boy me, are you going to give me any money or not?\u201d Cas tries to lean in threateningly, but it only makes him look like has an inner ear imbalance. \u201cYou have spousal responsibilities towards me.\u201d\nDean gapes. \u201cYou going to pull that on me? Now?\u201d\nCas shoots Victor the biggest, fakest smile. \u201cMy husband isn\u2019t very supportive of my needs.\u201d\n\u201cYou bitch,\u201d Dean breathes.\nCas winces \u2013 Dean feels the echoing twinge in his own head. \u201cYou have a Gorgon,\u201d Cas says. \u201cOr Gorgons, plural, though usually they\u2019re solitary so it\u2019s more likely there\u2019s the one. I wasn\u2019t sure earlier but when I walked here I could smell its saliva \u2013 it has a distinct acidic scent \u2013 through a sewage opening. They prefer hiding underground, usually near a water source. May I have some money now, Dean?\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Victor says in bemusement, \u201cYou got yourself married to a monster-sniffer?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, okay?\u201d Dean snaps. He pulls out his wallet anyway, ignoring the way Cas rolls his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s not a hunter, and he\u2019s staying out of this. You got me, Cas? We\u2019ll check out the Gorgon lead, see if there\u2019s anything in it.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Cas takes the money and smiles thinly. \u201cI hope you have a good day at work.\u201d\n\u201cAww,\u201d Dean says. \u201cThanks, honey.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Victor says, watching money-grubbing Cas makes his exit, \u201cI\u2019d heard about that from Charlie but didn\u2019t think it was true, so\u2026 congratulations.\u201d\nDean grits his teeth. \u201cYou have no idea how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop right there,\u201d Victor says. \u201cYou see this face, Dean? This is a face that does not care about your domestic problems. I said congrats and that\u2019s all you\u2019re gonna get, so let\u2019s check out this possible Gorgon infestation, that okay with you?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Dean nods. \u201cBreak it down for me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel is shocked with himself. He\u2019s sequestered in the motel room he and Dean are sharing, sitting on the floor and obsessively refolding the few clothes he\u2019s brought with him. It takes Castiel a ridiculously long time to realize that what he\u2019s really doing is sulking.\nHe could be doing a number of other far more productive things. Instead, he is arguing with himself. Actually to be more accurate, he is arguing with an absent Dean. Castiel didn\u2019t mean to make Dean angry so why is Dean holding a grudge for something that he didn\u2019t even do on purpose, and Castiel doesn\u2019t even know what it is he was supposed to have done in the first place.\nAn absent Dean does not argue back or say nonsensical things, but he still manages to make Castiel\u2019s blood boil anyway \u2013 why is that?\n\u201cThis is foolish,\u201d Castiel says aloud.\nStill, it must be said that worse than an absent Dean is an angry Dean. Castiel doesn\u2019t like how Dean turned sharp and cold in the flip of an eye, as though the real him had been nothing more than a mirage. Between Castiel and him, Dean\u2019s the warm one, the friendly one, the one who\u2019d offer his hand out first because his heart is just that big.\nBalthazar could possibly offer some advice for this. Castiel suspects it had not been just about sex, though that had been a part of it.\nCastiel turns on the television in some foolish notion that there might be some knowledge to be gleaned there. Unfortunately the only thing he learns is that TV is exponentially dull without Dean\u2019s commentary.\nSomewhere in the middle another procedural, Castiel\u2019s anger dissipates. It\u2019s just so stupid, look at him getting upset over something so petty. Now all Castiel can think of is how upset Dean had been \u2013 upset and disappointed, as though he\u2019d had expectations of Castiel that had been let down.\nCastiel really wants to figure this out. He thinks he could if Dean helped.\nIt\u2019s too quiet without him.\n\n\nCas.\n\n\nCastiel starts in surprise. Dean? What is it?\nEmotion rushes through the now-uncovered bond, of Dean\u2019s disgust and fear and determination. Dean\u2019s heart is beating steadily, a different kind of anger coursing through him now. With the invitation handed over Castiel moves in, slipping behind Dean\u2019s eyes to see what he sees.\nDean\u2019s underground, his nostrils full of the smells typical of a Gorgon\u2019s nest. You sure, Cas? Gorgons? Yes, that\u2019s definitely what it is. Dean\u2019s eyesight is poor in the darkness so Castiel nudges his optic nerves, giving them just enough of a boost to be able to make out the bodily remains in the walls and floor. \nDean blanches. He hadn\u2019t realized that that\u2019s what the Gorgon used to build its nest.\nI\u2019m sorry, Dean. Castiel leans a few more new combination curses when Dean studies the area. Some victims have already been turned to stone, partially broken into sand where the Gorgon feasted on them. Castiel can\u2019t help offering, For some of us, this is the way it must be. We are designed flawed. \n\n\nFuck flawed. I know creatures that make the choice not to be. Hell, \n\nyou did. \n\n\n\nYou have no idea how much we have to pay for a choice like that, Dean. Don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not trying to justify\u2014\n\n\nThanks, I\u2019ll take it from here. \nCastiel doesn\u2019t accept Dean\u2019s dismissal. He stays right where he is, following Dean through the catacombs and observing his discussion with Victor over what\u2019s to be done.\nThey suspect there\u2019s more that one Gorgon here. Victor is wavering, unsure if it\u2019s a good idea to go ahead without back-up, but Dean thinks they can handle this. Victor is newer to hunting, a friend that Dean relatively recently converted to the cause, though he has personal investment in this case as someone he used to work with \u2013 FBI \u2013 was last seen around here.\nDean, I hear breathing. About ten degrees to your left, downward, yes, there. \u00a0Dean has iron with him, good. He also has his phone out, and encourages Victor to do the same. Oh, you\u2019re using the camera on your phone as a protection filter. As opposed to a mirror. That\u2019s\u2026 clever. \n\n\nWell, I \n\nhave been doing this for a while, you know. \n\nCastiel makes himself watch. There is one active Gorgon standing guard, and Dean and Victor work together to take him out. There are two more further inside guarding their eggs \u2013 yes, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a nest, Dean \u2013 but after much cursing, a few injuries, and the destruction of one cellphone, they\u2019re successfully dealt with.\nThis is Dean in action, Dean at work. He moves with a confident grace, focused on the mission despite his quipping and affectionate ribbing with Victor.\nYou didn\u2019t have to help me, Dean tells him. He is injured, but satisfaction bolsters him through the pain. A part of him wants to celebrate, but when Dean looks down at their crumbling bodies he imagines Castiel in their place. Flawed by design. \nDoomed to destroy or be destroyed. Castiel thinks he should mourn them, but cannot rustle up the energy to care.\nThat\u2019s not all you are, you know. \u00a0Dean offers up \u2013 not memories, exactly, but more like a knot of emotions and doubts and old fears tied up together \u2013 thoughts he\u2019s had about what it\u2019s like to value yourself by how efficiently you kill. Sam told him, no, that\u2019s not all you have to be, which Dean hadn\u2019t believed that at the time.\nThat\u2019s not who you are, either, Castiel sends back. You saved my life when you didn\u2019t have to. Kindness given freely without expectation of return. There are things I could learn from you.\nDean response is surprise and discomfort. That\u2019s not what I meant, Cas. I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t expect you to \u2013 you\u2019re not a pet, okay. Geez, can\u2019t you tell?\nApparently not. Dean, why did you get upset? Tell me now.\nDean hesitates. Castiel tempers his frustration, because that just wouldn\u2019t help, and instead throws out an invitation of his own. Castiel promises to not be offended no matter what Dean tells him. He wants to know, honestly does.\nDean doesn\u2019t know how to put words to it. He gives emotions instead: embarrassment at the initial violation (Castiel knows that part), which then coalesced into anger. Castiel\u2019s shocked by the thick swarm of disgust in Dean\u2019s next thoughts \u2013 just the idea that he might\u2019ve forced Castiel into any of this makes Dean ill. The agreement and its boundaries have been clear between them, and Castiel\u2019s offer drove a wedge right into that. To think that Dean may have forced Castiel to bear his company where it wasn\u2019t wanted, and that Castiel offered sexual services in payment?\nNo, Dean says.\nThere\u2019s hurt there, too. Dean doesn\u2019t directly acknowledge it, but Castiel can see what it is. Dean didn\u2019t expect Castiel to think so little of him.\nThat\u2019s not what I\u2026 Castiel closes his eyes and sends something back. He chooses his most recent memories, letting them play out in Dean\u2019s mind as swift as one of his favorite TV shows, for this way Dean can know what it\u2019s been like for Castiel. There has been no compulsion here, no hate. And if there had been? Castiel would have broken the bond immediately.\nCastiel had no idea Dean placed such value on his honesty. Dean jokes so often and refuses to accept Castiel\u2019s upfront gratitude, Castiel had taken Dean\u2019s comfort for granted. It seems contradictory, though Castiel\u2019s learning that this is just the language Dean\u2019s mind works in.\nThank you, Dean. Castiel takes these new lessons into himself, tucking them away safely. He will need to study them closely, and not intrude into Dean\u2019s mind until he\u2019s figured them out. It looks like you and Victor may need help. What can I do?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor bitches and whines all the way out of the tunnels. \u201cThe fact is, if you\u2019d moved your lazy ass when you were supposed to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBefore or after you let tail-face get the jump on you?\u201d Dean\u2019s left calf is screaming in protest, so he and Victor are leaning on each other as they make the slow, painful trek out of there. Elsewhere, Cas is in a drugstore, painstakingly reading the labels of various painkillers. Dean sends to him: Just grab more bandages, we don\u2019t need that other stuff. Oh, and some ice. \n\u201cYou know what\u2019s interesting?\u201d Victor says.\n\u201cThe fact that you need to lose some weight?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, you said \u2018lose some weight\u2019 when I think you meant, \u2018stop asking dumbasses for help\u2019.\u201d\nAnd you actually like each other. \u00a0Cas is amused despite himself, prodding gently at Dean\u2019s mind for permission to learn more about Victor. But this is different from how you interact with, say, Jo and Ash.\nIt\u2019s not one-size-fits-all, Cas. Dean heaves Victor up the final step, ignoring his cursing. \u201cWe just need to make it to the car and we\u2019re good.\u201d Cas sinks into Dean\u2019s memories of Victor, captivated. Hey, watch the personal space.\n\n\nYes, sorry, I\u2019m still learning. \n\n\nCas is being really careful now, going only where Dean guides him to and otherwise keeping his distance. Dean\u2019s relieved, but he\u2019s also a little disconcerted \u2013 Cas had been so mad and now he isn\u2019t, and along the way he\u2019d managed to take Dean\u2019s own anger and turned that inside out. Dean feels a little stupid for his reaction now \u2013 sometimes Cas acts so human that Dean forgets he\u2019s really not.\nI think I might have figured it out. When I was bonded to my brethren, secrets were few and far between. I know that humans don\u2019t work that way, but I have very little practical experience. I sometimes can\u2019t tell what is off-limits, and what isn\u2019t. The same goes for\u2026 the physical, I think. \nYeah, I figured. \u00a0Cas is so reasonable about it that Dean feels like a douche. He\u2019d reacted pretty strongly, which seems bizarre in retrospect. Cas clearly didn\u2019t mean anything by it. The guy\u2019s harmless, and now he\u2019s practically tip-toeing around Dean again.\nWhich is good because that means Cas won\u2019t hear anything Dean wasn\u2019t want him to, but Dean kinda liked Cas poking around his head. Like Dean\u2019s a worthwhile subject of study, or something.\n\u201cAre you brain damaged?\u201d Victor barks. They\u2019re already in the car, but Dean realizes he hasn\u2019t made a move to turn the engine on. \u201cLet\u2019s get back before I crust over, how about that?\u201d\n\u201cJust a lot on my mind.\u201d Dean quickly turns the ignition on. \u201cYou were saying something?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Victor\u2019s voice goes soft, the way it does whenever he\u2019s worried. \u201cI had a hell of a time trying to pull someone in to help me on this. Was luck I got you at all, seems like everyone\u2019s\u2026 overworked? Claws here, ghouls there, but you know what\u2019s really interesting? Today we got a nest. The other day, Jo got that Rugaru camp and did you hear about that crazy vampire recruitment drive?\u201d\nDean nods. \u201cLenore gave us a tip on that, just before she went into hiding.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you should\u2019ve gotten the whole story out of her before you let her slip,\u201d Victor grunts. \u201cYou know what this looks like to me? Drafting. But hey, no one listens to me, I\u2019m just the new guy, what do I know. People keep saying this happens, the moon\u2019s in Mars or some bullshit like that, but my gut says otherwise.\u201d\nMadison had been acting weird, too. She\u2019d been tense and worried, though Pamela said that it was under control because Cas had given her something to help.\nCas, who\u2019d been in a cell when Dean found him because he didn\u2019t want to fight humans.\nWell, shit.\nDean starts to call Cas, only for Cas to contact him first: Dean, are these friends of yours?\nHe has to concentrate to drive and do the psychic projection thing at the same time. Cas is in an alley, can\u2019t be too far from the drugstore, and he\u2019s being asked pretty pointed questions. Ah fuck, that\u2019s\u2026 They\u2019re hunters but not\u2026 friendly, exactly. Can you get away? Don\u2019t let them know what you are. \u00a0\n\u201cVictor, did you see anyone else when you were poking around? The Campbells, maybe?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice anyone,\u201d Victor replies. \u201cBut if I heard about this case, anyone else could\u2019ve. Though I\u2019dve knocked \u2018em in the teeth for taking so damn long.\u201d\nCas, they\u2019re probably after the Gorgons. \n\u00a0I surmised as much. Cas tries to reason with the people who\u2019ve surrounded him, insisting that he\u2019s only there to buy supplies for a friend and has no idea what they\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s not working, though, because when the Campbells catch a scent they don\u2019t let go easily.\n\n\nWhat\u2019d you do to make them notice you? Never mind, forget it, you need to pretend you\u2019re innocent\u2014\n\n\n\n\nI \n\nam innocent. \n\nNo, I meant, uh, pretend that you\u2019re human. You\u2019re human and you\u2019re being harassed and these guys are pissing you off so \u2013 hey! Act like you think they\u2019re going to mug you, call for help. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think so, that\u2019d just draw more attention. \n\n\n\u201cDean,\u201d Victor says dryly. \u201cIn this country we drive on the right side of the road.\u201d\nCas wants to fly away. Dean can feel Cas\u2019 impatience at being forced to stand his ground, coupled with his inability to answer the rapid-fire questions coming from the vultures circling in on him. Hang on, I\u2019m coming. \nIt\u2019s a close call, but Dean makes it. He parks as close as he can, leaves Victor grumbling to himself, and high-tails it out to where the Campbells have Cas cornered. They\u2019ve followed standard operating procedure, drawing Cas into the shadows away from potential witnesses. Everyone appears to be carrying fistfuls of iron and silver.\n\u201cGet your own!\u201d Christian barks when he sees Dean. \u201cWe got this one, Winchester.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already taken them out, you morons!\u201d Dean shoves Mark out of the way. \u201cIt was Gorgons, three of them, they were building a nest underground. You think I ruined my shoes for the heck of it?\u201d\nChristian cursorily glances at Dean\u2019s boots. \u201cGorgons, you say?\u201d He\u2019s moved closer to Cas, poised to strike at any moment. \u201cSeems to me you missed this one. Thought you\u2019d come to finish the job yourself, huh?\u201d\nCas kicks Christian in the leg, running to Dean\u2019s side in the confusion that follows. \u201cDean\u2019s my husband, you assbutt,\u201d Cas snaps. He sullenly clutches his plastic bag to his chest. \u201cI got the bandages you wanted.\u201d\nDean throws an arm around Cas. \u201cThanks, hon.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me hon, you\u2019re late and I\u2019m tired and being harassed is not how I wished to spend tonight.\u201d They\u2019re wavering, Dean, this must be working.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not human,\u201d Gwen says cautiously. \u201cHe\u2019s allergic to iron. Did you know that?\u201d\n\u201cUh, hmm,\u201d Dean pretends to think, \u201cHow about, of fucking course I do. He\u2019s under my protection and you\u2019re all assholes for jumping on the first creature you find. You know what they say about assuming.\u201d Gwen opens her mouth again \u2013 probably to counter that Dean would\u2019ve done the same, which is true \u2013 so Dean quickly drags Cas away. \u201cAnd you wonder why I didn\u2019t invite you guys to the wedding.\u201d\nMark\u2019s eyes have gone comically wide. \u201cYou married a monster?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you\u2019ve tried it.\u201d Dean winks slyly at Cas, who responds with his best put-upon face. \u201cThe sex cannot be described.\u201d We should get out of here before they start wondering how I found you. When I start walking, keep up, but don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in a hurry. \n\u201cAnd you wonder why we won\u2019t have anything to do with you,\u201d Christian snaps. \u201cWhat kind of hunter are you?\u201d\n\u201cOne who actually found the thing that\u2019d been killing people, and dealt with them? Geez, keep up, Chris, you keep snoozing on the job and we\u2019re all screwed.\u201d Dean flashes a parting grin and makes his exit, Cas close to his side.\n\u201cI could\u2019ve just flown off,\u201d Cas says once they\u2019re out of earshot. No one\u2019s followed them, though they can hear faint sounds of the Campbells still talking among themselves. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been easier.\u201d\n\u201cIt also would\u2019ve made you look like you had something to hide.\u201d Dean exhales with relief when they make it to the Impala, but that just makes the pain in his side shoot up. He grits his teeth and presses a fist against the injury. \u201cThis way\u2019s easier. They know for sure you\u2019re with me, and they won\u2019t try to track you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cas suddenly crowds Dean against the car, grabbing the hem of his shirt and puling it upward. There\u2019s a snort somewhere nearby \u2013 Victor, who\u2019s still in the car. \u201cI\u2019m not molesting you, I promise,\u201d Cas says. His hand is gentle when it slides on Dean\u2019s skin, moving round to cup his side.\nDean\u2019s suddenly very warm.\nCas is just healing him, but they\u2019re still standing really close and Cas is frowning in that weirdly endearing way that makes Dean think that if he moved forward a little bit, he could take up Cas on that offer. Dean hadn\u2019t thought of it before, because Cas isn\u2019t human. He looks human and smells human and laughs like a human but he\u2019s just \u2013 he\u2019s only an arrangement. He doesn\u2019t care about anything but himself, so Dean should just return the favor.\n\u201cIs that better?\u201d Cas asks worriedly. \u201cI\u2019m going to fix your knee now.\u201d\nOh shit, Dean thinks. Apparently Cas isn\u2019t the only lying liar who lies; Dean\u2019s body is definitely thrumming with the urge to shove Cas against the car and kiss that anxious look off his face.\nGreat. It\u2019s not like Cas just got the message about the importance of defining one\u2019s sexual boundaries.\nDean turns away, grateful that Cas isn\u2019t listening in. Cas is too busy thinking about something else, not that Dean can make any sense of the rambling in his head: \u2018he doesn\u2019t understand how huge that is, does it not matter, how can he not realize\u2019, but Dean stops listening because Cas might hear him and that\u2019d just make it worse.\nCas draws back. \u201cIs that all right, Dean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Dean quickly fixes his shirt. It\u2019d be a bad idea to look at Cas right now, so he doesn\u2019t. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u00a0 Get in, we should be heading back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel knows from Dean\u2019s memories that Victor is a good person and a loyal friend. He\u2019s come through for Dean and the Roadhouse many times and, to his additional merit, when Dean explains that Castiel isn\u2019t human Victor\u2019s only response is to ask if Castiel can heal him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Castiel says, \u201cBut I\u2019m not married to you. It doesn\u2019t work that way. I could heal you if you had supernatural-related injuries, but not this.\u201d\nVictor shoves at Dean in disappointment. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have tapped a more useful creature? Or one with boobs?\u201d\n\u201cCas is fine.\u201d Dean\u2019s concentrating really hard on driving, refusing to take his eyes off the road. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to clean you up before infection gets in. You\u2019re staying at the same place me and Cas are, right?\u201d\nThey get Victor to his room with little trouble, Victor resuming his descriptive cursing once he\u2019s in bed. Dean proves himself a good friend, too, giving Castiel unembellished instructions in helping tend to his comrade.\nIt would almost be enough to distract Castiel from the fact that Dean is uncomfortable. He\u2019s barely up to his usual standard of filling the quiet with inane chatter, and even Victor seems to have noticed this. What is wrong with the world that Castiel prefers for them to be yelling at each other instead of this alternative? At least when they\u2019re arguing, they\u2019re talking to each other.\n\u201cThose wrappings aren\u2019t too tight, are they?\u201d Castiel asks Victor. \u201cCan I get you something? Water? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\u201cYou could just go.\u201d Dean doesn\u2019t look up from where he\u2019s finishing up on the bandages around Victor\u2019s ankle. \u201cI got this one.\u201d\nCastiel speedily reviews recent events. He\u2019d honestly thought they\u2019d made good headway after their disagreement \u2013 Dean had seemed relieved and willing to put that episode behind them. But it\u2019s also true that there are massive gaps in Castiel\u2019s knowledge of Dean. Maybe Castiel pushed too far in reminding Dean of his relation to the Gorgons, casting humanity\u2019s battle under a light Dean is not comfortable thinking of.\n\u201cI can\u2019t mourn them,\u201d Castiel blurts out. \u201cThe \u2013 those Gorgons, I mean. If I were in your place, I\u2019d kill them, too. I feel sad, sort of, but mostly I\u2019m angry that the situation is what it is. That in order to live at all we need to take from others.\u201d\nDean blinks owlishly at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cJust.\u201d Castiel shrugs helplessly. \u201cI just wanted you to know that. And thank you! With those hunters \u2013 Campbells, you said? You picked me.\u201d He tries on a hopeful smile. \u201cYou picked me over your own, and I know you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, but for me, I can\u2019t place value on something like that. So even if you don\u2019t care, I do. Thank you.\u201d\nThis just makes Dean\u2019s discomfort even worse. \u201cYou picked me over the Gorgons. It evens out.\u201d\n\u201cNot even, not a little,\u201d Castiel says quickly. \u201cDean, I\u2019m grateful. My own brothers have taken out their rage on me and you \u2013 you who owe me nothing \u2013 have done so much more than I could\u2019ve\u2026 If there\u2019s something you want?\u201d\nDean presses his fingers against his eyes. \u201cThis was a bad idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Victor grumps. \u201cYou\u2019re both still here and I need to get my beauty sleep.\u201d\nCastiel stands there feeling awkward. Unfinished business scrapes under his skin, insisting he fix this, and do it without taking the short-cut of looking into Dean\u2019s head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything of Zachariah\u2019s plans,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cI \u2013 you already know that he was trying to bring me over to his cause, but he didn\u2019t offer any details of his scheme. But there\u2019s been \u2013 I can\u2019t describe it \u2013 there\u2019s been this pull across the ether lately, as though my brethren have been calling out to each other, but I\u2019d heard nothing more of that since I\u2019d bound myself to you.\u201d\n\u201cDrafting!\u201d Victor barks. \u201cWhat\u2019d I tell you! Ow, shit.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, you idiot,\u201d Dean snaps. \u201cCas, look, we\u2019re all tired. Let\u2019s take a break, it\u2019ll be easier to figure out what\u2019s going on with a fresh mind tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Castiel says.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Dean gives him an expectant look. \u201cAre you going now or not?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course, I\u2026\u201d Castiel turns to Victor sharply. \u201cYou want to be alone?\u201d\nA new thought careens wildly down its path: Dean wants to be alone (fair enough), but Dean wants to be alone with Victor, and they\u2019re good friends, and Victor can offer the type of companionship that Castiel cannot, and Victor is attractive, and Dean has needs.\nThere\u2019s a tightness in Castiel\u2019s chest that hadn\u2019t been there before. How novel it is to be suffocated by something as insubstantial as an idea. Victor\u2019s a perfectly nice person, Castiel really shouldn\u2019t want to\u2026 do not very nice things to him.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Castiel says. So this is what it feels like to want someone.\nDean\u2019s head whips up. What?\nAnd that\u2019s what it feels like to have your personal space invaded. Castiel understands the need for secrets but is this different, it is its own kind of terrifying because although Castiel isn\u2019t in any danger of being killed, there\u2019s still the overwhelming urge to flee the fuck out of there. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says.\nCastiel snaps sideways, a single gentle flap of his wings enough to send him into his room \u2013 the room he shares with Dean.\nThough there is the chance that Dean might not be sharing it with him tonight.\nThat thought makes Castiel angry. Angry, but also bitter and a little sad. It\u2019s too much emotion for Castiel to parse at once. What do humans do when they get like this? Physical action, pacing? Castiel tries that now, traversing the room with tense steps to and fro, clutching at his shirt and breathing rapidly through his mouth as he tries to calm himself.\nCastiel starts at a sudden touch to his mind. It\u2019s Dean, brushing over Castiel\u2019s thoughts searchingly.\nFine. Let Dean take whatever he wants. It\u2019s not Castiel\u2019s place to deny him anything, even if what he wants is another person. That\u2019s a lie, though, Castiel does want to deny him that. Castiel wants to be selfish and recant his permission. So what if Dean didn\u2019t want him the first time, so what if Castiel has little practical experience?\nCastiel stops pacing, struck by the obvious next course of action.\n\u201cI have to seduce Dean,\u201d he declares.\nNow that he knows what it is, want burns along Castiel\u2019s skin, as though it\u2019d been there all this while but only chose to manifest itself now. He wants Dean, who is exasperating and interesting and refuses to acknowledge thanks for his good deeds as though to recognize them would be to admit weakness. Dean, who has little crinkles under his eyes and smells really nice when he doesn\u2019t go overboard with his aftershave.\nThe bond hums. Cas, stay right where you are. \n\u201cShit.\u201d The swear is strange but satisfying in Castiel\u2019s mouth. He looks down at his clothes \u2013 which are Sam\u2019s clothes, no wonder Dean doesn\u2019t want him, they must\u2019ve been really distracting. \u201cThink!\u201d What does Dean like to do, what does he look for in partners, why are human beings so complicated?\nThe door swings open. Dean is right there and coming straight for him.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Castiel says frantically when Dean closes the distance between them, an ominous feeling pulsing through the bond. \u201cWait, I\u2019m not ready, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d\nDean\u2019s hands come up to Castiel\u2019s face and, oh, Dean\u2019s kissing him. After a moment of stunned surprise, Castiel kisses back blindly. Dean\u2019s mouth is hot and his breath is warm and his body is a delicious wall of muscle Castiel wants to wrap himself around.\nThat was easy.\nI\u2019m not easy, Dean says. Well. Most of the time. \nYes, I think I\u2019ve figured that much out, oh, that feels\u2014 Castiel gasps when Dean\u2019s arousal careens through him.\nIt turns out that Dean wants him, too, and that want is just as new for Dean as it is for Castiel. Recent memories flicker through Dean\u2019s mind of their time together \u2013 the otherwise innocuous moments given new weight as Dean thinks, Has this always been there? I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s why I got mad when you offered without wanting me back, I don\u2019t know, who cares. \u00a0But unlike Castiel, Dean has clear ideas of where this can go: there are tastes and touches he wants to claim, and Castiel would give them to him gladly.\nDean\u2019s hands are obscenely clever, moving on a focused path of taking Castiel to pieces, pulling at his clothes and cupping the angles of his body. Castiel\u2019s lost in sensation but so is Dean, whose mind is also filled with glee and exhilaration, but a strange undercurrent of worry beneath\u2014\n\u201cDean.\u201d Castiel pulls away. \u201cDean, we need to. Walls.\u201d He presses fingers to Dean\u2019s temple. \u201cIf we do this, it can get\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, good idea.\u201d Dean\u2019s panting softly. Castiel\u2019s mesmerized when his tongue darts out to wet his lips. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll put them up now.\u201d Castiel feels a pang of regret, but a wall\u2019s a temporary necessity. Neither of them can promise to not listen to each other when they\u2019re distracted and Castiel, for one, does not want to take anything of Dean\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t mean to give. \u201cI\u2019ll take it down after, uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAfter I make you come your brains out?\u201d By all that is holy, Dean is breathtakingly handsome when he smiles. He tugs on Castiel\u2019s belt, drawing their bodies together. \u201cThat works.\u201d\nCastiel surges up to kiss him, open-mouthed and clumsy. Dean just laughs, hands gentle on either side of Castiel\u2019s head to guide him along. Dean is more patient with this than he is with anything else, contentedly leading from one kiss to another until kisses are not enough.\nUndressing is a tedious task. Dean practically cackles when Castiel tells him this, and then slows down. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Castiel demands.\nDean makes a show of it, flexing his muscles when he drags his undershirt over his head. It\u2019s nothing Castiel hasn\u2019t already seen, but it\u2019s different in this new context. Castiel feels breathless; he wants to touch Dean now, and is stunned by the realization that he\u2019s allowed to touch Dean now. Dean pops the button of his jeans, dragging the zipper down slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t you just want to jump this?\u201d\n\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Castiel says thickly. He kicks away the last piece of his unruly clothing. \u201cYou know, I thought that sex would be fun. This isn\u2019t fun.\u201d He looks down at his erection that\u2019s hanging heavy between his legs. \u201cNo, not fun.\u201d\nDean\u2019s leer deepens, and he shoves Castiel on to the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s about the anticipation.\u201d\n\u201cWhat good is anticipation?\u201d Castiel tilts his head back to watch Dean climb on top of him. He runs his fingers up Dean\u2019s sides, the drag of skin making his mouth dry. \u201cHow is it you\u2019ve changed? Why is it when I touch you\u2026\u201d He blinks up at Dean dazedly. \u201cYou\u2019re the same, but you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that happens.\u201d Dean shrugs, grinning happily. \u201cAnticipation means that feeling in your gut? That good feeling? It gets to build, and it gets better.\u201d He starts moving his hips, doing a strange sort of dance over Castiel\u2019s dick. \u201cJust go with it.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d Dean writhes in Castiel\u2019s lap, a lascivious god-like creature out to make Castiel crazy. His cock is flushed red and curved upwards suggestively, so Castiel takes it into his hand and squeezes. Dean murmurs his approval. \u201cYeah, yeah, good idea.\u201d\n\u201cI do know how this works,\u201d Castiel chastises.\n\u201cKnowing and doing are completely \u2013 oh shit.\u201d Castiel must be doing something right because Dean lets out a sound that makes Castiel want to roll them over and paw at Dean until he wrings out all the noises Dean can possibly make. \u201cFuck, keep going, keep going.\u201d\nCastiel wants to, but it gets harder to focus the more Dean moves. Dean reaches behind himself, finding Castiel\u2019s cock and pushing it firmly into the heat between his ass. Sweat is a poor lubricant but Dean loves it, rubbing insistently against Castiel\u2019s shaft and hinting of other lewd things.\n\u201cDean,\u201d Castiel gasps, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. Harder, must be \u2013 oh \u2013 harder.\u201d\n\u201cBossy pants.\u201d Dean obliges anyway, moving Castiel\u2019s legs around and changing the angle so that the snap of their bodies brings Castiel\u2019s cock firmly against the angle of Dean\u2019s thigh. Castiel races with it, losing breath and speech as Dean brings him closer to the edge.\nClever, clever Dean. When Castiel finally comes, he clings to Dean and gasps praises of that cleverness. It\u2019s messy and glorious, Dean grabbing his cock and pumping swiftly to prolong the sweetness of it.\nIn the aftermath, Castiel feels completely useless. Dean looks far too smug, but Castiel honestly has no criticism to offer. Castiel can only smile, and Dean takes that as an invitation to lower himself down for a kiss. These kisses are slower but no less scorching, the movements of Dean\u2019s mouth almost in time with his rubbing against Castiel\u2019s thigh.\n\u201cAnything you want.\u201d Castiel nods when Dean takes his hand, guiding it to wrap around Dean\u2019s erection. Dean\u2019s cock is almost silken smooth, sweat making their movement easier, and Castiel tightens his fingers until Dean nods.\n\u201cJust hold on.\u201d Dean makes a low sound of satisfaction, eyelids fluttering. He starts moving again, fucking Castiel\u2019s fist with steadily growing enthusiasm, until he lets loose, head thrown back and groaning, \u201cFuck, yeah\u201d and coming all over Castiel\u2019s hand.\nCastiel exhales slowly, contended beyond measure. He strokes a lazy hand down Dean\u2019s side as he drops onto the mattress, splayed out next to Castiel. That was wonderful, if a little clumsy in places, but surely with more practice Castiel will get better at it.\nThis is so unexpected. But not unwelcome, definitely.\n\u201cDean, do you think we could\u2026\u201d Castiel turns to Dean in surprise. \u201cDean, are you asleep?\u201d\nDean\u2019s mouth is open slightly, breath coming out in rattling almost-snores. His eyelashes rest soft near his cheeks, the eyes beneath still and untroubled. It\u2019s a sight to behold. Dean would never want to hear that Castiel finds him beautiful, so it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s not listening right now.\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant at all to desire someone when you\u2019re unsure if the sentiment\u2019s returned.\u201d Then he gets to search for washcloths to clean them both up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean\u2019s not sure what woke him up, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s something bad. He\u2019s not on alert \u2013 it\u2019s just really quiet. He turns his head and there\u2019s Cas, sitting cross-legged next to him.\nA slow grin spreads across Dean\u2019s face. They should\u2019ve done that earlier, he thinks. Not that he could\u2019ve guessed that Cas would be so into it. Dean\u2019s pretty sure that Cas didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be so into it, the guy hadn\u2019t had so much as a perverted thought in his head until he\u2019d hit himself with a cluebat and realized that he\u2019s married to a smokin\u2019 hot dude.\nThough Cas isn\u2019t all that bad, either. There\u2019s something cool about the way he\u2019s just sitting there, buck naked and uncaring.\n\u201cYou get off on watching me sleep?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice is a hoarse from sleep. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nCas has the stillness of someone who\u2019s been waiting for a while. Dean tries to poke at his mind, and is surprised to get silence. The wall that Cas put up is still there, and Dean must look frustrated because Cas says, \u201cI was just thinking about how I don\u2019t understand you. Even when I have access to your mind, I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d He rests his hand on Dean\u2019s stomach, stroking gently when Dean doesn\u2019t protest. \u201cThen there are times like now, when I can\u2019t read you, but I still see vibrancy in everything you are.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Dean says with a snicker, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re projecting. I\u2019m a simple guy with simple needs.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Cas nods. \u201cYou think of yourself that way.\u201d\nDean isn\u2019t awake enough to deal with this. \u201cDid you wake me up for sex or what?\u201d\n\u201cWe can do that.\u201d It\u2019s hard to read his expression in the dim light, but Cas seems softer somehow, like his sharper edges have been filed off. \u201cI want to taste you. All of you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nA lesser person would be floored by Cas\u2019 level of attention. Dean just happily goes, \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d\nCas goes down on him. He doesn\u2019t have much technique beyond taking as much of Dean as he can into his mouth, having all the finesse of someone who wants to destroy his reflex. Dean can\u2019t complain, because Cas lets him fuck his mouth \u2013 which he does, making short, quick shoves past Cas\u2019 lips that\u2019s obscenely hot to watch. Dean comes with a gasp, and Cas holds tight around him to swallow everything.\nBest way to wake up, really. Dean whistles his approval. \u201cNot bad.\u201d\nCas wipes his mouth. \u201cNow the rest of you.\u201d\n\u201cThe rest of me what?\u201d\nCas leans over Dean. He has an expression that Dean knows well because it\u2019s the one Dean himself gets whenever he stumbles on one of those fucking awesome all-you-can-eat at momma\u2019s homemade diner of your dreams with a dozen different types of pie. Except this time Dean is the buffet.\nWhich is apparently a turn-on.\n\u201cYou sure know how to make a guy feel special, Cas,\u201d Dean laughs.\nCas starts by lifting Dean\u2019s leg up to mouth at his ankles. He goes slow like he has all the time, hands and lips drifting lightly over Dean\u2019s skin in an attempt to make good at that promise to taste him.\nDean thinks he shouldn\u2019t enjoy this because he\u2019s already gotten off and Cas\u2019 impressive erection is getting neglected, but Cas doesn\u2019t seem to care. Cas just keeps kissing him, from his ankles up to his calves, then down his thighs and to his chest and his shoulders and neck. Dean really likes having his elbows licked, who knew?\n\u201cYou totally got me off first so you could do this,\u201d Dean pants. \u201cDidn\u2019t you? I knew it, you sneaky bastard.\u201d He\u2019s getting hard again, this is awesome.\nCas smiles as he drags mouth over Dean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI want to sodomize you.\u201d\nDean lets out a sputtering laugh. \u201cCas. We\u2019ve been hanging out for a while, surely you\u2019ve figured out at least a half-dozen better ways to say you want to pork a guy?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cas agrees. \u201cBut I like it when you laugh.\u201d\n\u201cNice cover.\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d Cas finally gets with the program, fingers nudging at Dean\u2019s entrance. \u201cLet me know if this hurts, I can\u2019t tell at the moment.\u201d\nDean sighs when he feels the smooth glide of a finger into him. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get lube?\u201d\n\u201cBought it while you were asleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s pretty\u2026\u201d Dean\u2019s really awake now, enjoying the fact that he\u2019ll be able to take two fingers in no time, the first orgasm\u2019s really gotten him loose. \u201cPretty presumptuous. What if I didn\u2019t want to?\u201d\nCas shrugs, more focused on getting that second finger in where it\u2019s needed. \u201cThen I\u2019d have an extra tub of lubricant to experiment on myself with.\u201d\n\u201cOh Jesus.\u201d Dean can imagine that though, Cas touching himself, curiously putting his own fingers inside him and then being blindsided by how good it feels. \u201cWe could do that, too. Oh \u2013 oh right there, find my \u2013 find it, bend your fingers. No, no, not there, a bit further up, yeah, warmer, just, oh fuck.\u201d\nMaybe Dean shouldn\u2019t have told Cas about the prostate, because now he\u2019s jabbing at it insistently and Dean\u2019s going to have a heart attack.\nCas stops. Dean makes a gurgling sound and opens his eyes.\n\u201cThis is less convenient.\u201d Cas tilts his head up to the ceiling. \u201cI need leverage. May I take my wings out?\u201d Dean nods. \u201cMay I use them to touch you? If you\u2019re uncomfortable, let me know and I\u2019ll retract them.\u201d\nTurns out, Garuda wings are not all that feathery. Cas brings out all six of them, these huge partly-translucent things that curve through the air like cloth moving through water. Two of them stretch up to the ceiling, the tips of them going into drywall. That\u2019s apparently what Cas meant by leverage, and he uses it now rise up to his knees.\n\u201cOh boy.\u201d Dean jerks when it feels like the sheet is lifting him up, but that\u2019s another of Cas\u2019 wings, supporting his ass and lower back. The wings aren\u2019t hot or cold, more like blankets of air that cause what feels like static electricity to run across whichever part of Dean\u2019s skin they touch.\nThe wing immediately underneath Dean cushions his head, and another pair hold his legs open. It occurs to Dean that he\u2019s being epically manhandled here, and he\u2019s so distracted by this apparent new kink that he almost misses Cas pushing into him. There\u2019s just so much other stuff going on \u2013 the wings undulating against his skin and stroking his neck \u2013 that Cas\u2019 cock spearing him open almost feels like an afterthought.\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d Dean rolls his body, surprised when the wings roll with him. The stretch in his ass is good but a little dulled by the pricks of not-electricity of Cas\u2019 wings brushing his face.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Cas blinks dazedly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Dean gazes up at Cas.\nCas is still his unassuming, awkward, bitchy Cas, but there\u2019s more than that. The way Cas looks at Dean makes him feel colossal, like he\u2019s really worthy of being the focus of that much attention from another person. When Dean thinks about it \u2013 really thinks about it \u2013 here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been alive for more centuries than Dean can wrap his head around, and Dean\u2019s been fucking taking him to eat fucking burgers and fries, and Cas makes it feel completely natural. Like, of course this is what Cas wants to do, of course Dean can have Cas\u2019 time and focus and laughter whenever he wants.\n\u201cUh, your wings are pretty cool,\u201d Dean says weakly.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Cas smiles, and Dean yelps at a particularly hard shock under one of his knees. It makes him clench down around Cas\u2019 cock, and Cas almost goes cross-eyed. \u201cOh. Noted, I shouldn\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n\u201cHell no, that was great.\u201d Dean puts his hands above his head \u2013 through the wings \u2013 and arches his body up. Cas\u2019 cock works just like a human\u2019s, sliding all the way home with a satisfying drag and burn.\nDean moans as he takes it. He\u2019s just as mesmerized by the way Cas is concentrating so hard to figure out the give of Dean\u2019s body. Dean wishes the wall weren\u2019t there between them, it\u2019d be so much easier to drop pointers direct into Cas\u2019 head.\nThose wings, though.\nCas slows down, frowning a little. \u201cYou\u2019re not enjoying this?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s great.\u201d Dean glances pointedly to where his cock is dripping pre-come upward onto his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s just ah. Your wings are really something.\u201d\nCas is confused, then thoughtful. He cautiously moves the wing supporting Dean\u2019s lower back, the edges like dozens of electrified fingers tickling his ass.\nDean shivers. \u201cWhoa, yeah. How\u2019s that working for you?\u201d\n\u201cNot as interesting for me, I\u2019m afraid. My wings don\u2019t register sensation the way, um\u2026\u201d Cas thrusts hard, forcing the breath out of Dean. \u201cI like watching you, though.\u201d\nDean figures he has to pray thanks to somebody because Cas then makes it his mission to find out what he can do with his wings. He cups Dean\u2019s body in the curve of one, rocking him up and down onto his cock. Dean wants to tell Cas that this means he\u2019s got a built-in supernatural sex swing, but Cas might stop to ask what a sex swing is and that\u2019d ruin the moment.\n\u201cLet\u2019s try\u2026\u201d Cas is still fucking Dean, hips not slowing as his wings brace and slide all over his body. \u201cTell me if this hurts.\u201d\nThe silk-electric feeling intensifies at Dean\u2019s shoulders, almost like a cock trying to find entry which is weird as hell to think about even if it\u2019s accurate. There\u2019s pressure at the skin and then the edges of Cas\u2019 wings are inside him, moving through the flesh beneath. Dean curses \u2013 an orgasm should not start at someone\u2019s shoulders for crying out loud \u2013 and then kicks at Cas frantically when he feels the wings start to withdraw.\n\u201cMore,\u201d Dean gasps. \u201cMore, more, give me more.\u201d His eyes are blurry but he can hear Cas\u2019 huff of amusement above him.\nThis is insane and probably illegal, but a lot of good things are. Cas\u2019 wings draw lines along Dean\u2019s sides just that little bit under his skin, working like a goddamned magician knowing exactly which buttons to push.\nDean\u2019s going to die. He\u2019s going to die because that\u2019s Cas\u2019 wing pushing through into him and lighting him up from the inside with crazy vibrating magic. Dean forces his eyes to focus and looks down \u2013 Cas hands are petting his stomach as though searching for something. It takes a moment for Dean to realize that Cas is aiming his wing for Dean\u2019s prostate, but by then it\u2019s too late.\nSucks to be their neighbors, \u2018cause there\u2019s no way Dean\u2019s not screaming through that.\nDean\u2019s brain is fried, game over, Cas zapped his prostate, medals for everyone. Dean\u2019s shaking so hard he barely comes back to himself in time to watch Cas come \u2013 the old-fashioned way, right in Dean\u2019s ass. There\u2019s a split-second just after when he opens his eyes, and Cas looks\u2026 soft. Younger. Like he\u2019s finally allowed to exhale.\nDean really wants know what Cas is thinking of at that moment.\nCas tucks his wings back into himself and lies down next to him. Dean approves of this, because an orgasm like that deserves a moment of awe and reflection.\nCas closes his eyes, and then the two-way\u2019s back on. Dean sighs, it\u2019s relief to be able to hear Cas\u2019 emotions again. The guy\u2019s practically high, coasting along the post-coital haze like it\u2019s the best drug in the world. You have a pulled muscle in your left calf, but you don\u2019t need me to fix that, do you? \u00a0\nNah, that\u2019ll be fine. Dean shoves Castiel\u2019s arm weakly. Just admit it, this is so much better than sitting alone in your room the whole day. \nAmusement flutters through the bond, and Cas turns to drop a kiss on Dean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn for clean-up.\u201d\nHow\u2019s that legit? I\u2019m the human one, here.\n\u201cI just gave you a wing orgasm.\u201d\nDean gets tingly just thinking about it. Yeah, okay, that\u2019s fair. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastiel wants to get Dean some breakfast. He doesn\u2019t want to get out of bed, for Dean is an excellent pillow, but a nice meal would start the day well.\nThere should be some shops open now, and the blissful clouds in Dean\u2019s mind means he\u2019s well on the way to stealing at least another hour in sleep. That last session had been particularly sublime, and Castiel isn\u2019t ashamed to admit that he\u2019d fallen asleep afterward pleasantly worn out.\nBut now it\u2019s important that Castiel get Dean something nice to eat. He has some reasonable skills in choosing what Dean would like, and a hearty meal would be a wonderful start to the rest of the day. It\u2019s likely Dean will be up for even more rigorous activity, and Castiel will be happy to oblige him.\nOnly it doesn\u2019t quite work out that way.\nCastiel\u2019s paying for takeaway when he hears Dean wake up. Dean sends some risqu\u00e9 suggestions at Castiel, to which Castiel replies that he\u2019s agreeable, and then there\u2019s a half-hearted debate on whether adding food to sexual activities would result in the loss of their motel deposit.\nIt\u2019s during Castiel\u2019s walk back that Dean\u2019s tone changes. His mind blares a warning that stops Castiel in his tracks.\nCas, don\u2019t come back yet. The Campbells are here, they\u2019ve got some\u2026 It\u2019s not safe. Stay where you are, I\u2019ll deal with this. \nCastiel tries to concentrate, wanting to see what Dean sees, but there\u2019s corruption in the bond. He can still hear Dean and his emotions, but some kind of distortion makes it hard for Castiel to focus.\n\n\nDean, there\u2019s iron and magic warping the link. \n\n\nCastiel readies himself to fly to Dean, but stops at the last moment. This seems eerily like a hunter\u2019s trap, but surely even the Campbells wouldn\u2019t hurt one of their own. Certainly not for the sake of one minor creature.\nStay away, Cas,. A knot of alarm, worry and anger strikes Castiel in the stomach.\nCastiel retains enough sense to fly onto the roof of a nearby building, far enough to be safe but close enough to observe the motel block. There\u2019s no one standing guard outside the room itself, but Castiel can see a van parked surreptitiously nearby.\nPain floods the bond \u2013 Dean\u2019s been hit, Dean\u2019s bleeding. Castiel doubles over and digs his wings into the cement, willing himself to remain still. Do they want me, Dean? Is that what they want?\nDon\u2019t. Stay where you are. \n\n\nDo they want my claws? My wings? My lungs?\n\n\nStay where you \u2013 Dean\u2019s struck again, harder this time.\n\n\nAre they after information? Dean, I can\u2019t act if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\n\n\nSomeone touches Dean\u2019s face and Castiel hisses at the pained echo that bounces through the bond. That touch belongs to a demon. It knows about the bond, and it knows Castiel can hear what it\u2019s doing. What is wrong with Castiel that he\u2019s letting Dean take this? Castiel\u2019s not fully healed yet but even he can take one demon.\nBut that\u2019s only one demon that he knows of. And there are also the hunters who are equipped to handle him.\nCastiel has to be logical. Castiel has to think clearly for Dean\u2019s sake.\nDean, can you hear me? I\u2019m right here. \nHe needs to get to Victor. Is it safe to fly? Are there other demons watching? They could sense him if they\u2019re close enough.\nDean, give your pain to me. \u00a0Castiel doesn\u2019t know if Dean even heard that, there\u2019s too much distortion now. All Castiel knows is that Dean is bearing another blow, and then another, and all Castiel can do \u2013 because he is useless \u2013 is hunker down and try not to panic.\nThe hunters eventually leave. It takes over two hours, but they do leave in the van, dragging an unconscious Dean with them. There are two demons in their flock: the driver and Christian, though the latter hadn\u2019t been taken by a demon last night.\nCastiel goes to Victor immediately, waking him up despite his protests. \u201cVictor, Victor, get up, you need to help. They\u2019ve taken Dean \u2013 I can find him but I can\u2019t \u2013 I need to get demons \u2013 call Ellen, I don\u2019t know how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCalm down.\u201d Victor peels Castiel\u2019s fingers off his shirt. \u201cBreathe. Who\u2019s taken Dean?\u201d\nVictor is apprised of the situation, but he can\u2019t help much. He\u2019s injured and his phone was ruined in the Gorgon hunt, so the most he can do is explain about the Campbells, Dean\u2019s devoted hunter clan cousins. They would not willingly ally themselves with demons, Victor says, so they must be being manipulated.\nCastiel may be alone, but Dean\u2019s allies are numerous. \u201cI could go to Sam. We were heading there anyway, we are closer to him than to the Roadhouse.\u201d Victor opens his mouth to say something but Castiel\u2019s gone, out the door to where the Impala is still resting in her parking spot.\n\u201cDean has been taken by villains.\u201d Castiel puts a hand on her roof. She\u2019s watched him and Dean, hopefully she knows he\u2019s a friend by now. \u201cI can recover him but I can\u2019t do it alone. I need to get to Sam, can you take me to him?\u201d\nVictor comes shambling out of his room, shirt half pulled-on and limping. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking her for help.\u201d The driver\u2019s door clicks open, and Castiel murmurs a thank you. \u201cShe can lead me to Sam.\u201d\n\u201cThe car?\u201d Victor stares for a moment, and then shrugs. \u201cI knew that thing was haunted.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not haunted, she just is.\u201d Castiel slides into the driver\u2019s seat and the engine rumbles to life. He can feel Dean in the leather \u2013 well, mostly Dean, with some Sam and the late John \u2013 and the echoing presence bleeds back into Castiel\u2019s skin. It helps Castiel center himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help change your bandages.\u201d\n\u201cNah, the love of your life\u2019s in peril.\u201d Victor claps Castiel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do from here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it just like life, as soon as you\u2019ve got a full day of getting laid in your immediate future, some doucheface with an agenda has to come and send it all down the crapper.\nDean wakes up on the floor of a van. His hands are tied and Gwen\u2019s booted feet are within view.\nHe can hear Cas freaking out somewhere, though it\u2019s barely audible through the cloud of static. The weird chain Christian dropped around his neck is doing its work, but at least he knows that Cas is alive. Cas knows he\u2019s alive, too, a sliver of relief and desperation trickling through the noise when he registers that Dean\u2019s awake. Cas is shouting at him, but it\u2019s a distant blur.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this,\u201d Gwen says. \u201cWe won\u2019t do anything to him, we just want to talk.\u201d\n\u201cThat your pitch, or do you actually believe that?\u201d\u00a0 Dean slowly sits up, wincing at the pain in his stomach. Mark is sitting near the door, gun at ready and watching Dean. Christian, thank goodness, is nowhere to be seen. \u201cC\u2019mon, guys, this isn\u2019t like you. Ambushing a guy in his boxers? I like a little roughing up every now and then, but the whole part where we\u2019re related is a turn-off\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s war coming, Dean.\u201d Gwen must be playing the good cop now. \u201cYou in your Ivory Roadhouse might not want to see it, but in the end it\u2019s going to be us against them.\u201d She joins him on the floor, pulling out the intense, sad eye contact. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard things. Monsters acting up.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Gwen creeps even closer. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t come for you. You were in pain because of him, and he didn\u2019t come to help you. Doesn\u2019t that tell you something?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it tells me you think Cas would magically know what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re married, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nDean narrows his eyes. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou told us yourself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dean snaps. \u201cHow do you know about the psychic bond? I sure as hell didn\u2019t until he explained it to me, it wasn\u2019t in any of the stuff I read up on.\u201d Cas, Cas, can you hear this? Boost up the signal, do something, you need to hear this. \nGwen starts. \u201cThat\u2019s not important. He was supposed to come back but he didn\u2019t, not even when you needed it. No matter what you think about him, no matter how trustworthy you think he is, he will abandon you the first choice he has to make. Maybe he already did, even before we got to you. It\u2019s us against them, and they\u2019ve been preparing for months.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, all the activity across the map\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. But we need more information. Anything at all about their next step will help us. That\u2019s why we need Castiel.\u201d She smiles at Dean hopefully.\nThis trap for Cas is really good, but it\u2019s too nasty even for his psycho cousins.\nDean takes a deep breath. \u201cChristo.\u201d Then, \u201cOh, shi\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam, when Castiel finds him, doesn\u2019t panic. Castiel practically breaks down his apartment door but Sam keeps a cool head and listens, going quiet and intense when Castiel lets his explanation unfold. Castiel stands back once he\u2019s done, watching with relief when Sam immediately grabs his phone. Of course Sam would know what to do.\n\u201cHow many demons do you need?\u201d Sam asks.\n\u201cThree or four will do,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cThe hosts will survive my feeding, though I can\u2019t heal them if they\u2019ve been harmed already.\u201d\n\u201cThat is funny, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Sam says with a dry laugh, \u201cSo much stuff going on, barely anyone noticed when the demon omens went quiet.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the extent of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Castiel admits, \u201cJust the part that\u2019s touched me.\u201d\nSomewhere else, Dean is awake and being moved. Castiel has some bearings on where he is, though it\u2019d be easier to pinpoint if there wasn\u2019t so much distortion.\nDean\u2019s ring is warm on Castiel\u2019s finger. He cups it now, a physical reminder of the bond that ensures that Dean will not be lost.\n\u201cMadison told me she\u2019s been having dreams of a giant wolf,\u201d Castiel tells Sam. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it meant at the time, I\u2019ve been shielded by my marriage to Dean, but I\u2019ve been thinking... It seems impossible, it\u2019s never happened before in my lifetime, but if I open myself just enough there\u2019s this \u2013 this pull, like we\u2019re being summoned back to our masters. I think it might be all of us creatures, no matter if we were born or made.\u201d\n\u201cYour masters?\u201d Sam echoes.\n\u201cOur Alphas. The first of our lines?\u201d\n\u201cAfter we\u2019ve saved Dean,\u201d Sam vows, \u201cYou and me are totally going to sit down and hash this all out. You guys have genealogy lines? That\u2019s just\u2026 would actually explain some things.\u201d\n\n\nDemons, Cas.\n\n\nCastiel\u2019s head snaps up. \u201cI can hear Dean. It\u2019s not as clear, but I can hear him.\u201d We\u2019re coming for you. \nYou might want to hold that thought, they\u2019ve got a whole Shawshank set up in here. Werewolves, Djinn, shifters, you name it. Can you see this? They took back the charm that was blocking you. I\u2019m thinking they want you to see this. \nNow Castiel\u2019s able to catch glimpses of the place Dean has been brought into. It\u2019s larger than Zachariah\u2019s, far more elaborate, and there are smells that make even Castiel gag from where he is. Dean, if they ask anything of me, answer them and try to stall. Sam\u2019s with me working on a plan. \n\u201cI know where Dean is,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go by myself, they will have prepared for that. The traps have to go down.\u201d\n\u201cWe can arrange that.\u201d Sam\u2019s frowning at his cellphone, typing messages with both thumbs. \u201cGive me a location, I\u2019ll see who we can pull to get there.\u201d\nCas, hey. Dean\u2019s been brought into a room that both of them immediately identify as an interrogation chamber. A demon wearing semi-formal clothes is waiting for Dean with a smile and welcome, and he talks to Dean in a way that makes it clear that he\u2019s the one holding the Campbells hostage.\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d Sam says.\nCastiel shrugs. \u201cWe might have to make that assumption for now.\u201d\nDean sees spell markings and implements that are strange to him until Castiel puts down their names and uses. Fear prickles at Dean\u2019s mind when Crowley has one of his minions \u2013 who\u2019s wearing Mark Campbell, one of the cousins Dean actually liked \u2013 put him into a chair and bind him. Crowley starts chanting a spell Castiel doesn\u2019t immediately recognize.\n\u201cCan you give a rough idea where Dean is?\u201d Sam has pulled a map onto his laptop screen. Maps are maps no matter if Castiel doesn\u2019t know most of the names on them, and he points. \u201cOkay, I got Bobby on, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s in the area.\u201d\n\n\nUh, Cas? \n\n\nCastiel jumps at the same time Dean does. Foreign magic tugs at the bond, sliding in thick like oil. Castiel gasps but Dean\u2019s just confused \u2013 he\u2019d expected the pain of torture, and doesn\u2019t understand why Castiel\u2019s panicking.\n\u201cSam, Sam, Sam,\u201d Castiel says urgently. \u201cI must \u2013 I need to concentrate, I need a place I can sit and focus, I won\u2019t be able to talk while I do this. Can you\u2014?\u201d Sam brings him into the bedroom without argument, and by the time Castiel\u2019s made himself comfortable on the floor, his scales have erupted over his neck and upper arms in a typical defensive response. \u201cI might talk or curse, just ignore that. If I\u2019m not done by the time you have the team ready for assault, wake me up. Slowly! Understand?\u201d\n\u201cI got it,\u201d Sam says worriedly. \u201cBut whatever happens, you can\u2019t let go of Dean.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that, Sam,\u201d Castiel says impatiently. \u201cI know how important he is.\u201d Surprise lights Sam\u2019s eyes, but Castiel\u2019s already slipping away, finding Dean and holding on to him tighter than he\u2019s ever allowed himself to.\nCas, what\u2019s happening? \nIt\u2019s an intrusion, a violation, foul magic used to usurp other magic. It\u2019s only thanks to Castiel\u2019s patience that he hasn\u2019t already burst into flames in rage, for the serpent is forcing its way in, trying to break into their bond and take it for themselves.\nWell, they can\u2019t have it. Let me in, Dean. \nThere\u2019s no training for this. Castiel has borne burdens with his brethren before \u2013 Anna, Balthazar, Rachel \u2013 but a marriage bond is different, Dean\u2019s mind is different. Dean is human, with thoughts of many facets and colors that make up a language wholly its own, and it will be a challenge despite their remarkable compatibility. You think we\u2019re compatible? \u00a0Of course they are, isn\u2019t it obvious?\nThey\u2019d only just met when they formed the bond and look at what it\u2019s been like since then. How is that anything but remarkable? Castiel puts that thought aside; he has something else to do.\nOkay, Cas, shut up and get in here. \nDean opens his mind, and Castiel dives in as the first surge of pain hits.\nThe spell is exquisite eldritch craftsmanship. Where did Crowley learn such a thing?\nCastiel opens Dean\u2019s eyes.\nHe and Dean are in the same space; together they glare up at the demon Crowley. Understanding swings back and forth between their individual conclusions \u2013 Crowley wants to remove Castiel from the bond so that he may use Dean as a \u2013 a modem, free access to the world wide hivemind \u2013 in his search for the other creatures he\u2019s hunting.\n\u201cBig mistake,\u201d Castiel says with Dean\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re the other one,\u201d Crowley says in surprise. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be on the other end? No matter.\u201d His blade glints over Dean\u2019s skin, ready to draw more of its unholy art. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know where Purgatory is, would you?\u201d\nDean, hold your ground. Dean\u2019s too busy thinking hunter\u2019s thoughts and trying to make sense of Crowley\u2019s plan, but Castiel makes him focus. The spell will hit us with all it has, and we must stand it. This is just the start. \n\u201cThat endeavor will kill you,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cThere is no value here.\u201d\nCrowley rolls his eyes and brings the blade back down. \u201cFigures that you\u2019d be too low down the food chain. We need to go a bit\u2026 higher.\u201d\nNew lines are drawn on Dean\u2019s skin, magic burning hot and foul as it cascades from Dean to Castiel and back. Dean curses violently and bucks against his chair. Castiel knows for certain that they\u2019re going to die. All of them who laid their hands and words on Dean are going to die. How about we not die first, huh, champ?\n\u201cThere are things\u2014\u201d Castiel stops to grit Dean\u2019s teeth. \u201cThere are things in there you cannot hope to ever control.\u201d Dean sees what Castiel means, catching a glimpse of the place where most of Castiel\u2019s kin came from, and takes over for a moment to say, \u201cYou\u2019re so fucked, Crowley. You\u2019re going to destroy us all.\u201d\n\u201cHow about you let the big boys worry about that?\u201d Crowley says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me cut off this tumor of yours, eh, Winchester? You should be thanking me for this.\u201d\nIt becomes a mass of pain. Both of them bear the intimate press of the curse, which is trying its best to slice its way through the bond. It\u2019s broken glass and lightning and hooks under the skin, both of them only vaguely aware of their physical bodies in the distance. The physical doesn\u2019t seem to matter when there are living, writhing things in their eyes, their chests, their stomachs. Scratch magical torture off my bucket list, Dean thinks hysterically.\nThey can bear this. They can, Dean is stronger than his vessel and more stubborn than his words. I thought I was a fragile human being who couldn\u2019t take care of himself. \u00a0Dean can definitely take care of himself, Castiel\u2019s the one who\u2019d needed him at the start of it, and they\u2019re in this now because of that.\nHold on, Dean. Castiel throws his mind wide open, giving Dean something to cling to. Dean somehow knows instinctually how this works, and his trust is as sweet as rainwater. Castiel pushes his favorite memories to the front \u2013 of flying in the desert, standing on mountaintops to breathe through the snow, that first crumble of apple and pastry in his mouth. Dean shares his own:\u00a0 the scratch of a record being placed on a player, wind rushing by on the upward arc of a swing, the smell of leather when putting his father\u2019s jacket on.\nThe blade edge of the spell nicks at the bond, but weakly. If they can hold on just long enough for Sam to set the other pieces in place, they will be free.\nAnd you\u2019re buying me a cheeseburger, Dean adds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a while \u2013 an hour, a day, who knows \u2013 the real world is irrelevant.\nThat\u2019s because Dean is elsewhere, tucked into that place you go to when pain is inconvenient, except he\u2019s not alone. Cas is with him. More interesting than that, Cas is pissed off. Cas rages at the violation like it\u2019s his job, which would be hilarious under any other circumstances because Dean had no idea this existed under all that bland confusion and disinterest, but there you go.\nThey can\u2019t have you. I won\u2019t let them. \nSo when Cas finally draws away with a sharp be right back, Dean doesn\u2019t get mad. He could, because it\u2019s not fun at all for Cas to leave him by himself to take how the world comes back in painful flashes of white and gray, cold air rushing into his lungs while the rest of his body screams.\nBut Dean doesn\u2019t get mad, because right now Cas\u2019 got that covered. The bond throbs firmly at the back of Dean\u2019s mind, still in working order despite the agony of what feels like knives slicing through his skull.\nHands grab at his face, an annoying voice chirping, \u201cHello?\u201d Crowley\u2019s face slowly comes into focus when Dean opens his eyes. \u201cSomeone in there?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a little hard to speak through the blood in Dean\u2019s mouth. He tries anyway.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Crowley waves that stupid blade in front of his face. \u201cLittle unclear on there, sport.\u201d\n\u201cI said\u2026\u201d Dean coughs wetly. \u201cYou\u2019re in so much trouble.\u201d Crowley looks confused for all of two seconds, and then he looks up to where the ceiling is rattling.\nUnfortunately, Dean misses the good part. Oh, he\u2019s still awake when Cas comes crashing through the wall, wings out like a boss and screaming at Crowley in his native tongue \u2013 they have some really interesting curse words, definitely \u2013 but he passes out around the time Cas\u2019 talons come down on Crowley\u2019s head.\nHeh, Cas has talons.\nSo Dean passes out. That\u2019s totally reasonable, world of pain and all that.\nWhen he eventually wakes up an indeterminate time later, he\u2019s only groggy and exhausted. Pain has been demoted to a hazy memory, and good riddance. When his eyes focus, he registers that he\u2019s no longer in Crowley\u2019s torture spa. \nDean notices Pamela\u2019s hippie art pieces on the walls, which means that he\u2019s in the Roadhouse infirmary. He considers moving, but that\u2019s a stupid idea because he feels wrung out like road-kill on a summer\u2019s day. A far better idea would be to melt into the bed for the next decade or so.\nHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s on drugs, though. He\u2019s exhausted, but he can still think. He certainly has enough brain capacity to notice that someone\u2019s in bed with him.\nDean looks down.\nCas stirs, eyes scrunching tight as he presses his face into the soft, ticklish skin adjacent to Dean\u2019s shoulder. A gentle prod into Cas\u2019 mind reveals exhaustion that mirrors Dean\u2019s own, and he\u2019d only woken up because Dean woke up.\n\u201cMrrr,\u201d Cas grumbles. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\nDean should really file a complaint. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a wealth of space on the bed, despite Cas\u2019 decision to tuck himself firmly against Dean\u2019s body. Cas\u2019 arm is flung across Dean\u2019s chest, his hand clutching onto a part of Dean\u2019s shoulder where he\u2019s also apparently decided to leave a handprint burn as a souvenir. \u201cThat\u2019s not permanent, is it?\u201d Dean asks.\n\u201cWas emergency.\u201d Cas nuzzles deeper like he doesn\u2019t care how dangerously close he is to faceplanting into Dean\u2019s armpit. There\u2019s a thread of unhappiness in Cas\u2019 mind, and when Dean follows it he sees a fuzzy memory of what Dean looked like when Cas arrived at Crowley\u2019s. Sorry it took so long. \u00a0\nCas feels really bad about that.\nDean runs his fingers through the hair at Cas\u2019 nape. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. You were right there with me most of the time.\u201d He tugs at Cas\u2019 ear teasingly. \u201cYou\u2019d totally miss me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nTerribly.\n\n\nIn the quiet of the room, Cas\u2019 sleepy presence becomes a fading buzz at the edges of Dean\u2019s thoughts. It\u2019s soothing, like white noise, though Dean doesn\u2019t feel like going back to sleep himself.\nNow that there\u2019s no pain to deal with, Dean can think about how insane it had been to go that deep into Cas\u2019 mind. Cas had been so angry and terrified that he\u2019d torn himself open to give Dean something to hold on to, and Dean swears that he saw echoes of himself settling in there between Cas\u2019 memories of his siblings (the nice ones), like Dean matters. \nAnd a part of him \u2013 just a teeny, tiny part, okay \u2013 is thrilled by that.\nThe divider curtain moves and then Sam\u2019s coming in, smiling sheepishly. \u201cHey.\u201d He\u2019s settled into the chair next to the bed before Dean realizes he should be embarrassed that he\u2019s got six feet of sleepy dude practically sprawled all over him. Pamela\u2019s probably taken pictures. \u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d\n\u201cJudging from your sorry face I\u2019m the best feeling person in this room.\u201d Dean snickers, because the world\u2019s already a better place when Sam\u2019s making disgruntled faces. \u201cCampbells okay?\u201d\nSam droops a little, nodding somberly at his shoes. \u201cThe ones we could find, yeah. When Cas made the pick-up he burned out all demons and even some of the other\u2026 inmates before we could question them.\u201d\nDean shrugs casually, though there\u2019s another unexpected rush at the thought of Cas going berserk on his behalf. \u201cGuy\u2019s thorough, what can you do.\u201d\n\u201cEllen\u2019s taking over this one personally, it looks like we might need to pull out the big guns.\u201d Sam studies his hands for a moment. \u201cDo you, um. Do you need anything? As far as Pamela could tell you\u2019ve totally healed.\u201d\nDean experimentally wiggles his feet. Everything\u2019s working, looks like. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m cool.\u201d\n\u201cSo I guess I should\u2026\u201d Sam moves to leave, but stops short at the curtains. \u201cBy the way, did you know you\u2019ve got some\u2014\u201d he wiggles a finger in Dean\u2019s direction, \u201c\u2014Cas all over your shirt? You might want to clean that up.\u201d\nDean flips him off. \u201cMight want to clean up your face.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you go to sleep,\u201d Cas groans. Familiar irritation oozes through the thick sleepiness of his mind.\nDean cups the back of Cas neck and squeezes gently. You know what\u2019ll be better? Post-rescue celebration sex. It\u2019s the best. He must make a really stupid face at that, because Sam gags and high-tails it out of there.\nA weird buzz floods Cas\u2019 mind, knocking Dean\u2019s awesome idea straight out on its ass. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten in almost two days.\u201d Cas peels himself off Dean and blinks sleepily at nothing. \u201cI\u2019ve fixed what I can but that\u2019s not enough. Come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2014\u201d\nCas grabs Dean\u2019s shirt and hauls him up. Dean knows Cas\u2019 wiry body is just a front for his real strength, but it\u2019s still bewildering to find himself manhandled off the bed and onto his feet in the dizzying blink of an eye. Cas tugs at the hem of Dean\u2019s shirt to fix it, and then raises up a warning finger. \u201cDon\u2019t argue.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Dean says, slipping into the shoes Cas pushes towards him, \u201cThat\u2019s actually kinda hot.\u201d\nDean is hungry now that he thinks about it, but Cas drags him out of the med wing with an urgency that\u2019s ridiculous. The buzzing in Cas\u2019 mind kicks up a notch, making it difficult for Dean to get a read on him beyond that he\u2019s tired and pissed \u2013 at Crowley, probably, though it\u2019s hard to say for sure. Dean politely pulls back because Cas needs his space like everyone else. If he\u2019s a little antsy around Dean because of what went down, Dean gets that, too.\nThey end up in the bar, where Sam\u2019s already settled at a table and talking with Victor and Jo. Early lunch, it looks like, and Cas promptly dumps Dean into a chair before making his way to the kitchen.\n\u201cHey man, looking good,\u201d Dean says. \u201cWhat\u2019d I miss?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be cheerful.\u201d Victor pokes a fork angrily in the air. \u201cStop being cheerful, it\u2019s offending me.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, dude, not my fault I\u2019m the only one with a Garuda up my sleeve.\u201d Dean grins when Cas comes back with the Roadhouse all-day-breakfast special. \u201cThanks. You getting something for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI have my coffee.\u201d Cas sits down opposite Dean and pushes the plate firmly towards him. \u201cEat up now.\u201d\nJo\u2019s smirking over her orange juice. \u201cHe always this bossy?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d Dean flicks at Cas through the bond, expecting his usual squirmy response, but Cas just hunkers down to take a long gulp of coffee. He\u2019s still tired, Dean reminds himself. Cas just needs proper rest and, heh, a good roll in the hay that Dean\u2019s more than happy to provide.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Dean says, turning to the others, \u201cAny news while I was out? Jo, how\u2019s it going?\u201d There\u2019s a lot to talk about, it seems, because they each have their theories and Victor\u2019s particularly smug that his conclusions about the monster activity have their truthiness after all. Dean listens to it all, jumping in every now and then to add what he managed to get from Crowley and his minions.\nCas isn\u2019t listening, though. Cas is sinking deep into his own thoughts, the buzzing in his mind growing louder and louder until Dean, who isn\u2019t even trying to listen, can\u2019t ignore it.\n\u201cCas,\u201d Dean says quietly, \u201cIf you\u2019re tired you should go.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Cas nods rapidly. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d He puts down his mug and the fog suddenly clears from his thoughts, leaving them crystal clear.\nDean knows what\u2019s coming, he can feel it dropping like an ominous pebble in Cas\u2019 mind, but that doesn\u2019t make hearing it any less of a kick in the nuts. \u201cDean, I want a divorce.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dean blurts out.\nSilence falls over the table. Sam coughs and tries to get up, but he slowly sits back down when Cas shoots him a glare.\n\u201cI mean.\u201d Dean clears his throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Cas?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m healed.\u201d Cas looks Dean right in the eye as he says it. That\u2019s a conscious choice, as is the cool wall he\u2019s firmly pulling over his thoughts. \u201cThose were the terms of the contract, weren\u2019t they? When Sam managed to get me a meal of demons to power myself up, the feeding completed the healing process as well.\u201d\nNow this is the punch in the face to match the kick in the balls. Dean hadn\u2019t thought of it like a contract since\u2026 a while, it has to be. But Cas is right. A promise is a promise and if Dean\u2019s stomach is sinking down to his feet then that\u2019s his own fucking problem because it\u2019s not like Cas ever pretended this was anything more than what it is.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Dean can be an adult about this. \u201cOkay, yeah. Do you want to move out? We\u2019ve still got a couple of rooms, I think, Ash can help set you up. Something higher up, maybe? There\u2019s a part in the attic of the main building that we got converted for this other guy \u2013 never mind, long story \u2013 but we could go have a look after this?\u201d\nCas blinks in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, it\u2019s not like you have that much stuff anyway,\u201d Dean rambles, \u201cAnd most of it used to belong to Sam. Your clothes, I mean. You should still keep them, it\u2019s not like Sam could fit into them anymore even if he wanted to.\u201d\nCas\u2019 mouth opens and closes. \u201cYou think I\u2019m staying?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re staying,\u201d Dean says. \u201cYou like it here, we like you here. And by \u2018we\u2019 I mean me and Sam and Jo and maybe Ellen, though I\u2019m not completely sure about that last one but she\u2019s got to be okay with you after taking out Crowley. Victor\u2019s totally on board, too \u2013\u00a0 you are, right?\u201d\nVictor starts. \u201cWhy do you keep dragging me into this?\u201d\n\u201cNeutral observer, go with it,\u201d Dean says.\nCas is still completely bewildered, slowly leaning backward as though he\u2019s developed a spontaneous allergy to the table. \u201cI do have things to do, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cBut you like it here! You like it here, and you like\u2026\u201d Dean trails off; oh god, not the right place for this, better ride the adrenaline rush before he starts crash-and-burning. \u201cCome on, Cas, you literally cannot lie to me. Life has just started becoming interesting for you. You\u2019re not gonna give that up.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even have to read Cas\u2019 mind to know the next part is true. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give that up.\u201d\nCas\u2019 face crumples, punching the breath from Dean\u2019s lungs. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says quietly. And then disappears.\nDean stares at the empty Cas-shaped space. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d\nMaybe he jumped to the wrong conclusion. Maybe he\u2019d gotten everything wrong about Cas, but\u2026 that\u2019s not possible, is it? Dean knows Cas has been happy, far happier than he\u2019s been for a long time. To hell with it, Dean\u2019s been happy, too. Maybe it\u2019s something else, maybe Dean fucked up somewhere without realizing, or maybe Cas saw something in his head\u2014\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Cas reappears in his seat. He\u2019s scowling, though, which is good because Dean can handle an irritated Cas better than a morose one. \u201cCan you stop thinking about yourself for five seconds?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d Victor chips in.\n\u201cDude.\u201d Sam shoves at Victor with his elbow. \u201cNot cool.\u201d\n\u201cBe nice,\u201d Cas snaps at Victor. \u201cHe\u2019s your friend.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s your husband,\u201d Victor replies with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m under no obligation to be nice and I\u2019m not the one making a big production out of fucking nothing.\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Jo glances between them uncertainly. \u201cShould we leave?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted witnesses!\u201d Cas yells. \u201cIt was supposed to be easy! I\u2019d declare my desire for a divorce, you\u2019d say yes, we\u2019d break the bond and your damn friends would be the damn witnesses and the whole damned thing would be over. Don\u2019t you dare make that joke you\u2019re thinking about dams and beavers, Dean, I am not in the mood.\u201d\nDean\u2019s stomach flips. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous when you\u2019re angry.\u201d\n\u201cStop that!\u201d Cas jumps up from his seat and grabs Dean\u2019s collar. \u201cAre you going to divorce me or not?\u201d\n\u201cIf I say yes, will you leave me?\u201d Dean asks.\n\u201cEmotional blackmail,\u201d Cas gasps. \u201cThat is low.\u201d\n\u201cSo you do want to leave me?\u201d Dean makes an unmanly sound of surprise when Cas pulls, dragging him to his feet and away from the table.\nHe knows he should feel really, really bad about poking Cas, but he loves it when Cas is like this. The guy\u2019s usually repressed to stillness, but there\u2019s so much more to him than that. A few right words and he falls, practically undone as he gives himself over to the emotions he keeps telling himself he doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s as if only Dean can do this to him.\nThere\u2019s also the part where this is turning out to be a major turn-on.\n\u201cDean.\u201d Cas only stops marching them both when they\u2019re outside the bar, their audience left far behind. \u201cStop being obtuse. We need to separate because I\u2019m compromised.\u201d\n\u201cCrowley?\u201d Dean starts. \u201cWhat, is the spell still there? I thought you flushed it out when you\u2014\u201d\nCas groans, dropping his face into his palms.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dean says slowly, \u201cNot Crowley?\u201d He carefully brushes over Cas\u2019 mind, just enough to show how much he wants to know but will be okay if Cas doesn\u2019t want to tell him. Cas, to Dean\u2019s surprise, downright melts at the touch, anxiety easing away when Dean soothes him.\n\u201cWhat I mean is\u2026\u201d Cas presses a hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m compromised.\u201d\nDean is a horrible, bad, terrible human being. Cas is holding himself taut like he expects to be shot, but Dean\u2019s brain is too busy spiraling around that little piece of information.\nCas is compromised. Dean can\u2019t say he\u2019d seen that one coming, but now that it\u2019s here it\u2019s not a surprise at all.\n\u201cI should\u2026\u201d Cas struggles with his ring, then stops halfway. \u201cDean?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean looks down to where he\u2019s got Cas\u2019 hands in an iron grip, stopping him from getting that ring off. \u201cOh.\u201d\nDean feels lightheaded. Cas is close to leaving and it\u2019s really important that he doesn\u2019t, but Dean\u2019s never been smart at this part. His track record has more potholes than not, he wouldn\u2019t put it past himself to fuck this up. The thing is, Cas is so upfront and honest about how he feels that all Dean wants is to return the favor and then some. Dean thinks he should be terrified \u2013 to lay yourself open like that is just insane \u2013 but then, he realizes, he\u2019s almost there, isn\u2019t he?\nDean thinks he might finally understand what Cas meant what he said that the bond is its own kind of freedom.\n\u201cWe can make it whatever we want it to be, right?\u201d Dean says carefully. \u201cWho cares how it started, because it works. Maybe one day it won\u2019t anymore, and we can break it then. But right now\u2026 right now it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good. At least I think it\u2019s good?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Yes, it\u2019s very good, Dean.\u201d\n\u201cThen why can\u2019t we keep it?\u201d Dean asks. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that you\u2019re compromised.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026?\u201d Shock widens Cas\u2019 eyes. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what you wanted. You like it to be simple.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I need to get over that.\u201d Dean feels something inside him shift, some old fear fading into nothing because the expression on Cas\u2019 face is something Dean can and does want to fix. \u201cMaybe I should get over that right now. I think you\u2019re awesome, and I think this\u2014\u201d he gestures between them, \u201c\u2014can be awesome, too. Christ on a cracker, Cas, you\u2019re plugged into my head. Don\u2019t be afraid to look, can\u2019t you see how okay I am with this?\u201d\nCas finally touches Dean\u2019s mind, but he does it so cautiously that Dean might scream. Everything\u2019s right there, if only Cas would take it. \u201cOh, I see,\u201d Cas say shakily. \u201cBut remember, you got quite upset the last time I breached a personal boundary of yours.\u201d\n\u201cThat was ages ago!\u201d\n\u201cMy mistake,\u201d Cas says with a wry smile, \u201cI thought it was only the three days prior.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Dean grabs Cas\u2019 hand firmly and pushes his ring back up to its proper place. \u201cThere. That\u2019s that.\u201d\nCas pulls his hand back and splays his fingers out, a tiny smile playing on his face as he admires the silver. Dean feels better already, relieved at the quiet satisfaction humming through Cas\u2019 mind. Then Cas says, \u201cDo you want this back?\u201d and pulls Dean\u2019s ring out from his pocket.\n\u201cHey, Crowley took that from me for\u2026 Oh.\u201d Dean almost laughs at the way Cas ducks his head in embarrassment. Even while in berserker mode, Cas had apparently enough presence of mind to save the ring. Dean loops his fingers into Cas\u2019 belt and tugs, grinning when Cas comes forward willingly. \u201cYou got it back for me, you marshmallow cream center.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Cas grabs Dean\u2019s hand and slides the ring on, neat as you please. \u201cTry not to lose it again.\u201d\nThe ring doesn\u2019t feel heavy at all. Dean toys with it for a moment, then grins at Cas. \u201cWhat, no kiss?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cas says loftily, \u201cI\u2019m tired and you haven\u2019t finished your breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cFuck breakfast.\u201d\nThat startles a smile out of Cas, the easiness of it tingling all the way down to Dean\u2019s toes. \u201cYou\u2019d choose me over food? Mind yourself, Dean, people might think you have feelings.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s pie.\u201d Dean shrugs carelessly. \u201cNothing personal, right?\u201d\nCas\u2019 laugh is one of the best sounds in the world. Dean\u2019s so busy watching the way the corners of Cas\u2019 eyes crinkle up he doesn\u2019t realize Cas is moving until he\u2019s right in his face, sliding his arms over Dean\u2019s shoulders and tilting his head up to kiss him. Dean huffs in surprise but recovers quickly, getting with the program of cupping Cas\u2019 head and guiding his lips open.\nCas\u2019 mouth is hot, his mind is like, god, it\u2019s like fucking sunshine and rainbows and kittens in there \u2013 I like sunshine, rainbows are all right but I don\u2019t have an opinion either way about kittens. \nOh now you pay attention to what I\u2019m thinking about, Dean responds. Amusement and yearning radiate from Cas\u2019 mind, and it\u2019s trippy to be able to feel that at the same that Cas licks a firm line up Dean\u2019s tongue. You have learned well, young Padawan. Cas\u2019 fingers are in Dean\u2019s hair and he\u2019s practically climbing Dean\u2019s hip in his eagerness.\nThe best part, though, is how Cas\u2019 arousal burns freely from his mind to Dean\u2019s. \nCas\u2019s desperation is right there, and Dean soaks in it, laughing breathlessly at the way Cas\u2019 want is an almost tangible thing, licking along Dean\u2019s thoughts in the strangest sort of foreplay. Cas plucks at Dean\u2019s mind for hints or ideas, and gasps when Dean helpfully provides. Yes, yes, all of it, yes. \nDean doesn\u2019t care that Cas can see right back into him. If he were wired differently he would be, but right now, with Cas, he can\u2019t find any fucks to give. He\u2019s open and Cas is open and this is so much better than relying on clunky words. Dean can see how Cas is overwhelmed and terrified, and that\u2019s cool because they can be overwhelmed and terrified together.\nI want to breathe you, Cas thinks at him. There\u2019s a rush of air and they\u2019re suddenly back in Dean\u2019s room, Cas falling onto the bed and pulling Dean with him. I want to put my roots in you and see what happens.\n\u201cOh Jesus, can we fuck like this?\u201d Dean fumbles with his belt, cursing when it takes too long to get his pants off. \u201cYou in my head, me in yours?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cas hisses, rising up to plant a firm kiss on Dean\u2019s chin. His shirt\u2019s a lost cause, pulled apart in his need to feel Dean\u2019s hands on his skin. \u201cMe, take me, I won\u2019t need much preparation, don\u2019t feel pain like you do.\u201d\nDean doesn\u2019t have to doubt that statement. He can follow everything that\u2019s going on, from Cas\u2019 eagerness, to his flicker of curiosity about what it\u2019d feel like to be fucked, to the still-new rush of hunger that comes from taking two, then three, of Dean\u2019s lubed-up fingers. There\u2019s only a twinge of discomfort when Dean pushes his fingers deep as they can, and with Cas\u2019 mind and body yelling their readiness, it\u2019s easy as anything to just shove Cas onto his stomach and give it to him.\n\u201cOh god.\u201d Dean blinks dazedly at the back of Cas\u2019 neck. The edges of Cas\u2019 hair are curled with sweat, though it\u2019s hard to focus on the individual strands because Cas is shaking so hard. Or Dean\u2019s the one who\u2019s shaking, same difference. How\u2019d we get here? \nA part of Dean wants to savor this, but that part\u2019s overridden by the boil in his blood to get this show on the fucking road. Underneath him, Cas is tense and ready, not quite enjoying it yet but confident that there are more interesting things to come.\nBe with me. Dean slowly rolls his hips, drawing his cock out only so that he can push back into the delicious clench of Cas\u2019 body. He moves his hands down Cas\u2019 sides, up his thighs, across his stomach, anything else he can touch. Goosebumps dance over Cas\u2019 skin and Dean gently pats the swell of his ass. You better pay attention. \nIt\u2019s going to be good. Dean knows that even before he starts fucking Cas in earnest, pacing it hard and fast with the knowledge that Cas can take it all. Dean slides a hand under Cas\u2019 chest to hold him in place, keeping their bodies slick against each other while his mind stays with Cas\u2019, following him closely through interesting and oh that\u2019s better and oh Dean oh that\u2019s which then dissolves into a wordless frenzy.\nDean knows the feeling.\nHe has to close his eyes. It\u2019s too tight in his skin and every time he knocks Cas\u2019 prostate the white-out of pleasure slams through them both.\nThere\u2019s no slowing down, though, they\u2019re racing headfirst into it, and who the fuck cares if the bed breaks with the workout it\u2019s getting. God, Dean wants to ride Cas for hours, wants to ruin him and make him scream, but there\u2019s no chance of that now. Cas is horny as hell, pushing back against Dean\u2019s dick while pleasure crests through his body in a wave.\nThe best part is that Dean gets to do this again. Cas has seen into him and he hasn\u2019t left, so Dean gets to keep this, and he gets to keep Cas.\nCas starts. Oh. He\u2019d heard that, and his surprise is that last, lingering step before he tips over and falls.\nThe orgasm roars through them, and Dean bares his teeth in a snarl because that\u2019s the only thing he has any control over anymore. Cas\u2019 delirious bliss drags Dean down with him, and the feedback loop means it\u2019s just crazy party time for everyone. That might be Cas sobbing but it\u2019s hard to be sure since Dean\u2019s also yelling and it\u2019s all messed up and no one knows what\u2019s going on anymore.\n\u201cBluh,\u201d Dean says much later. Cas is squashed flat under him but uncomplaining, his mind a contented flatline of oh\u2026 that doesn\u2019t want to go anywhere. Dean rolls off him with a grunt.\nThere\u2019s a long, quiet moment of nothing. But it\u2019s a good kind of nothing; the kind that doesn\u2019t want filling up. After a while Dean feels Cas stir. He doesn\u2019t move but his mind rumbles through its reboot and then turns its attention to Dean\u2019s.\nDean knows what Cas will find in his head. He can tell himself that it\u2019s only afterglow, but there\u2019s also happiness there: raw and bright and stupid-making. That\u2019s cool, though. Cas can look all he wants.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Dean laces his fingers together on his chest. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nCas shrugs. It was okay.\nDean hooks his foot over Cas\u2019 ankle and rubs gently. Cas starts making a sound in his mind \u2013 half-purr, half-hum \u2013 that Dean wants to wrap around himself like a blanket. \u201cNext time we do that, you\u2019re getting your wings out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they submit their proposal to Ellen, she puts her newspaper down to give them her full attention. \u201cRun that by me again?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d like some time off.\u201d Dean rocks back and forth on his feet, hands shoved into the front pockets of his jeans. \u201cA couple of weeks, max. We\u2019ll still be in touch, and we\u2019ll come back if there\u2019s an emergency, no question.\u201d\n\u201cDean would like to take me to Lawrence,\u201d Castiel says. \u201cThat\u2019s one stop of many, though we haven\u2019t agreed on a definite route at the moment. If you have any suggestions, we\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cThe traffic\u2019s gone down, too!\u201d Dean adds. \u201cSince Victor took up shop at Monster Alcatraz we\u2019ve got population control back online. Uh, sorry Cas.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense taken.\u201d\nDean continues, \u201cAnd with the Campbells up and running again, the workload of cleaning up Crowley\u2019s mess is pretty evenly spread out. I think you can spare us. Well, me at least. For a little while.\u201d Does it look like she\u2019s cracking?\nCastiel sends the mental equivalent of a shrug. You know her better than me, Dean. \n\u201cActually.\u201d Ellen purses her lips thoughtfully. \u201cI meant run that first part by me again. Your opening? Let\u2019s hear it one more time. For the balcony.\u201d\nDean squares his shoulders. \u201cMe and Cas want our honeymoon.\u201d\nCastiel nods. \u201cYes, it\u2019s only proper.\u201d When Ellen raises an eyebrow, he adds hastily, \u201cFor the sake of a mutually respectful cultural exchange between our species, of course.\u201d\nEllen is no fool. She\u2019s seen the shift between the two of them since Dean\u2019s kidnapping and recovery, even though she\u2019s not asked them directly about it. No one in the Roadhouse has, for Dean\u2019s family is kinder than that. They roll with it, supportive and observant of Dean\u2019s choices, and one day Castiel might even find the way to get Bobby to like him for who he is.\n\n\nBobby already likes you, feather-brain. \n\n\nThen why does he threaten to cut off my appendages if I ever break your heart? \nDean\u2019s head whips round. What?\nCastiel rolls his eyes and pulls one of Dean\u2019s unresisting hands into his own. It\u2019s a mark of affection, Dean. I like the assumption he\u2019s made that I\u2019m sticking around. Some progress is better than none. \n\u201cWell, then!\u201d Ellen says loudly, and they return their attention back to her. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve thought about this carefully \u2013 or I\u2019ll assume you have, seeing as that you\u2019re both adults who don\u2019t need me telling you what to do with your lives. I just need to know one thing. Is it still on the down-low?\u201d\nCastiel isn\u2019t sure what she\u2019s referring to, but Dean just says, \u201cNo. We\u2019re cool with it.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! Then we\u2019ll have a send-off.\u201d Ellen smiles warmly. \u201cThat okay with you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s perfect, then we can put a stop to all the goddamn questioning,\u201d Dean grumbles. \u201cWhy the hell everyone and their grandmother cares about whether I\u2019m really hitched, I have no idea. Victor\u2019s such a gossip queen, geez.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Castiel glances from Ellen to Dean and back. \u201cWhat\u2019s a proper send-off?\u201d\nA proper send-off turns out to be like any other of the Roadhouse dinners, except with Dean and Castiel as the guests of honor. Jo and Ash take charge as co-organizers, closing the bar for the night so that their near and dear can fill the space up. Castiel usually doesn\u2019t mind crowds \u2013 they make it easier to disappear in, after all \u2013 but it\u2019s different when people are there to actually see him.\nDean basks in the atmosphere, loud and laughing as he meets these faces of familiarity and affection. Everyone assumes Castiel\u2019s bewilderment at the attention is inherent to his non-humanness \u2013 which it might be, who knows.\nBreathe, Dean says, sending a layer of calm over Castiel\u2019s mind. Wherever Castiel turns, Dean drops a name and an anecdote in his head, reminding him that these are people Dean knows and trusts, and though all of them are related to hunting some way or the other, Castiel has nothing to worry about because Dean has his back.\nThere are few certainties in Castiel\u2019s life, but for this chapter at least, Dean\u2019s confidence and stubbornness to keep him here is one.\n\u201cHell of a coming out party,\u201d Pamela says, accosting Castiel while he\u2019s in the middle of trying to find a nondescript corner to hide in somewhere. She drags him towards the bar with an amused, \u201cLet Dean work the room. You just need to sit down and look pretty.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, Dean\u2019s better than me at that, too,\u201d Castiel demurs, which has Pamela laughing. They settle at the bar where Jo\u2019s waiting for them. Jo is on drinks duty tonight, and she takes to it with aplomb.\n\u201cI thought it would be a smaller affair,\u201d Castiel says, glancing around the room. Only a handful are actual hunters, the rest civilians. There are even some children partaking in the merriment. \u201cThough I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Dean\u2019s touched so many people. That is his gift.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a way to put it,\u201d Pamela says with a wink.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious.\u201d Castiel holds her gaze. \u201cI truly am.\u201d\nPamela swings her gaze round to Jo smugly. \u201cThat\u2019s twenty bucks you owe me, Harvelle.\u201d\n\u201cShhhh.\u201d Jo swats at Pamela with a towel cloth. \u201cSorry, Cas, we made a\u2026 I know, tasteless.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, too,\u201d Castiel says with a laugh. \u201cIf I had anything of value I would have wanted to join that bet.\u201d He sits back while Jo sets up a line of shots that he is apparently required to down one after another. He feels a flicker through the bond, and concentrates just enough to hear Dean\u2019s conversation with his brother across the room.\n\u201cJust be straight with me,\u201d Sam is saying softly. He\u2019s pulled Dean aside to where they have some partial privacy, Sam boxing Dean in against the corner. \u201cBecause otherwise? This is not cool.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not messing,\u201d Dean replies. He\u2019s smiling for the benefit of the others, but the words come out low and insistent. \u201cOkay, maybe just a little bit\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDean!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014but not where it counts.\u201d Dean takes a shaky breath, but he is calm, confident of his decisions. \u201cI know, it\u2019s only been a few months, but I\u2019m not breaking it. I don\u2019t want to, Cas doesn\u2019t want to, and if we\u2019re gonna keep it, everyone else has to know.\u201d\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t know how you guys\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Dean shrugs happily. \u201cMaybe this is as real as it gets for me. I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d\nSam\u2019s surprise is palpable. \u201cAnd Cas?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay with that, too.\u201d \n\u201cCas,\u201d Jo says, making Castiel start. Her coy expression makes Castiel drop his gaze \u2013 he must have been making a foolishly pleased expression, though who can blame him \u2013 but she\u2019s nice enough to not call him on it. \u201cYour go.\u201d\n\u201cDid I say congrats already?\u201d Pamela asks. \u201cNo? Well, congrats.\u201d She drops a kiss to his cheek and ruffles his hair.\nCastiel ducks his head, clamping down the urge to crow to the world the luck that has been his. It\u2019s not his secret to tell, but of all the impossible things Castiel could ever have hoped for, Dean wouldn\u2019t even have come close. Dean is kind and stubborn and perpetually fascinating, his mind taking to the bond with such skill and dexterity beyond anyone (human or not) that Castiel\u2019s known, as though he\u2019s been starving for the chance to share himself with someone beyond the clumsy limits of language.\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky,\u201d Castiel manages to say. \u201cAnd thankful.\u201d\nFor what they have here is not a marriage as the others understand it. This is just how Dean\u2019s determined to carve a place for Castiel in his world, and to say that Castiel is honored would be a gross understatement.\n\u201cDance!\u201d someone yells. Another voice picks it up and it dissolves into chanting, whoops in the air, and then Dean\u2019s sauntering up to Castiel at the bar, hand outstretched and practically glowing.\nSomewhere in the background someone increases the volume of a man\u2019s musical declaration of how much he wants sugar poured on him.\nDean cocks his head. \u201cYou know how much we humans love our rituals.\u201d\nCastiel is terrified for about two seconds, and then he\u2019s taking Dean\u2019s hand.\nAfter that it\u2019s a blur of laughter and Dean guiding Castiel\u2019s body through the bond and a lot of music with electric guitars and dramatic drumming. Castiel doesn\u2019t understand most of the conversation swirling around them but everything\u2019s okay because Dean\u2019s right there, a grounding presence that makes Castiel\u2019s own feet feel like they\u2019re on firm ground for the first time in eons.\nPeople fuss over them both, and there\u2019s a lot of back-slapping and a few direct hugs that throw Castiel off \u2013 some people are really offended on his behalf that there\u2019s no one on his side of the family here tonight \u2013 but Castiel finds himself helplessly swept up in the cheer of the night.\nThe best part is later, though. The final agenda of the night is apparently the guests\u2019 official sending off of Dean and him. The guests pour outside the front doors to where the Impala is parked, (Almost) Just Married written across the back in what turns out to be whipped cream.\nDean\u2019s busy with goodbyes, so Castiel makes himself comfortable in the Impala\u2019s passenger seat, rubbing his shoulders against the leather and nodding at the Impala\u2019s subtle murmur of recognition. Sam comes by the window to see him off, an understandably cautious smile on his face when he offers a hand out.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sam says quietly, \u201cGood luck, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Castiel shakes his hand firmly. \u201cI shall care for him to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\u201cYou talking \u2018bout me?\u201d Dean says, appearing at Sam\u2019s shoulder. He grabs at Sam, and the brothers tussle for a moment while Castiel fiddles with the radio. Dean\u2019s happiness makes him glow like a small sun, his laughter coming in short breaths.\nCas looks up when Dean gets into the car. \u201cDo you remember where we\u2019re going, or should I pull up the map?\u201d\n\u201cLet me get to the Interstate first.\u201d Dean checks the mirror. \u201cThat place better be good, Cas.\u201d\n\u201cThe honeymoon package had good reviews on the internet.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and the internet never lies?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already made the booking. You are not backing out on me.\u201d\nThey wave at their guests, and Castiel turns to watch the lighted-up Roadhouse slowly shrink as they leave it behind. Castiel feels like he should mark this occasion with something pithy, perhaps referring to the nature of roads and travel, and the pride he feels at having Dean with him.\nNone of it feels adequate, though.\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Dean says. \u201cWe should go see Victor. Give him a nice surprise, since he couldn\u2019t make it tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYou are at once a terrible person and a wonderful friend,\u201d Castiel observes. Once again this drives home what a miracle this is, that they can share this happiness without baggage or censure, and Castiel\u2019s seized by a sudden impulse. He leans across the space between them and kisses Dean\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dean shoots Castiel a slightly embarrassed \u2013 but pleased \u2013 glance. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go to Victor.\u201d Castiel toes off his shoes and pushes them into a corner. \u00a0\u201cThen we can canvass that area again, see if anything slipped through the cracks.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t still think Crowley survived, do you?\u201d Dean asks.\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Castiel admits, \u201cBut we also know he was dabbling in magic that should\u2019ve been beyond a normal demon\u2019s scope. I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have failsafes in place, no matter that Ellen and the others haven\u2019t been able to find anything.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t disagree there.\u201d Dean reaches over to cup the back of Castiel\u2019s neck, stroking his thumb across the skin there lazily. \u201cLenore\u2019s still missing, too. I\u2019d rest easier if we could make sure it\u2019s really over. Hey, c\u2019mere.\u201d\nThey\u2019re waiting at an intersection, so Dean gently tugs Castiel in for a kiss. Castiel murmurs his approval against Dean\u2019s mouth, flicking his tongue against Dean\u2019s in a soft tease until someone honks at them. Dean snickers and says, \u201cWait \u2018til you see what I brought for our honeymoon.\u201d\n\u201cBesides the small arsenal of weaponry and salt in the trunk?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d Dean drops a hand to Castiel\u2019s thigh, palming the flesh there firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a good time.\u201d\nCastiel rests his hand on top of Dean\u2019s. \u201cI know.\u201d"
