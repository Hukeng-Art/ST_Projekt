    "text": "Bucky\u2019s been at the Avengers Tower for three weeks before he finally gives in to Steve\u2019s gentle coaxing and Stark\u2019s cheerful waving of fistfuls of circuits, and lets them scan the arm.\nIt doesn\u2019t go well.\n\u201cJust rip it off,\u201d Bucky says, and he\u2019s not panicked. Panic is something that\u2019s been beaten and burned out of him. But he does put a hand to the join at his shoulder, dig his fingers in and start pulling. Steve makes a distinctly panicked sound and pulls Bucky\u2019s bloodied fingers away.\nBucky lets Steve press gauze to his shoulder. His breathing rate is slightly higher than optimal, but the bleeding stops quickly.\n\u201cOkay, one: that was freaky, you know that, right?\u201d Stark has both his hands held out, as though to distance himself. Understandable, given that Bucky has apparently been leaking increasingly dangerous levels of unknown radiation from his arm this entire time. High enough that even a supersoldier might be affected. That a human certainly would. \u201cTwo, this is why we scanned your arm to begin with, and it\u2019s not as simple as ripping it off. Pretty sure that will lead to A) you dying and B) explosions.\u201d\nBucky thinks, put me back down in the ice. Put me deep down where I won\u2019t hurt anyone ever again. Get me out of here.\nBut it\u2019s been a year of running, and yelling at each other on rooftops, and saving Steve from the stupid, stupid shit he gets up to when Bucky\u2019s not there to drag him out of it. And he thinks Steve means it when he says wherever Bucky goes, Steve\u2019s gonna follow.\nIt pisses him off. It makes him feel\u2014uncomfortable. Too warm. Frantic, because he\u2019s stuck here now, stuck in this fucked-up mess of a head and warzone of a body, because that\u2019s what Steve needs. Bucky needs Steve to be okay, and Steve needs Bucky to be okay, and isn\u2019t that a fucker.\nDeep freeze is out. Brute force, blunt removal: also out. Bucky doesn\u2019t know what else to do. He\u2019s not designed for finesse, not like this.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it off, but these things must be done delicately,\u201d Stark is saying, twirling a tool in his human fingers and looking at the arm pensively.\n\u201cAre you the Wicked Witch of the West in this scenario?\u201d Steve asks with careful lightness, head tilting, perfect eyebrow rising. His hands are rubbing Bucky\u2019s shoulder, tracing patterns. A star. A crescent moon. A sun. Bucky tries to focus on that, and not his pulse roaring in his ears. \u201cGotta admit, Buck would look great in ruby red slippers.\u201d\nBucky thinks he\u2019s had enough red for a lifetime, but he doesn\u2019t say anything, just stares at metal fingers and tries to think. Tries to imagine a world where he doesn\u2019t have this thing attached to him. It seems impossible.\n\u201cSure thing, Toto. Add that to the list. So, here\u2019s the plan: we\u2019ll give you some good ol\u2019 juice of the poppy, detach the armed bomb\u2014oh, come on, that was hilarious! We\u2019ll gussy you up while we\u2019re at it. Attach a new arm with a clean power source and give you pigtails and blue gingham. Everyone wins!\u201d\n\u201cGive me what juice,\u201d Bucky says flatly, and Stark takes a step backwards.\n\u201cAsgardian poppy,\u201d he clarifies quickly. \u201cThor assures me that you\u2019ll feel no pain! Besides, Steve gave it a go last week, and all it did was turn him into a snoozy puppy\u2014not literally, but you remember.\u201d\nSteve draped over Bucky in the common room while Star Trek played, drooling on Bucky\u2019s shoulder, mumbling about space pants. It\u2019d been nice. Quiet. Simple, threat levels minimal. Nice to card through Steve\u2019s hair carefully.\nSnoozy puppy is not an inaccurate description. Just one Bucky can\u2019t ever imagine applying to himself.\nAlso.\nBucky glares at Steve. \u201cSteve. You said you\u2019d just had a hard workout with Natasha and Thor.\u201d\nSteve scratches his head and looks at Bucky sheepishly from under his bangs. Bucky refuses to let the flood of fond memory that ensues soften his outrage. Fucker never learned, always flung himself on grenades and into experiments and through fire. What did Bucky have to do to make him stop?\n\u201cWell, kinda? Mostly we took shots. I just wanted to make sure it wouldn\u2019t hurt you before you tried it.\u201d Now Steve\u2019s making doe eyes, toeing the ground in front of him. Bucky knows he\u2019s being played like a piano, loud and obvious, and is aggravated that it seems to still be working. Working all the better for Steve showing his hand so deliberately.\nBucky tables the self-preservation argument, because he knows that tactically, it\u2019d be way too easy for Steve turn that blade back on him. But he\u2019s still feeling prickly and hurt. Nasty.\n\u201cNot real pleased you guys\u2019ve been sneaking around behind my back all this time, pal,\u201d Bucky growls, and it\u2019s true. He\u2019s not proud that Steve flinches, but still feels a vicious vindication all the same. He hates feeling that. He hates feeling anything. It\u2019s hard. It hurts. \u201cHow long have you been discussing this op without me?\u201d\n\u201cUh, when was it that you called me about Operation Arm, Steve? Was it\u2014yes, it was, right about when you were getting chased by nurses as you and Sam tried to flee the hospital in your delightful backless hospital couture and got your personal assets on the front page of the internet. Last summer, yep.\u201d\nThe internet doesn\u2019t have a front page. Bucky still remembers seeing that, all the way in Croatia, on a computer screen in an internet cafe. Hard to forget. A year ago. A year this has been coming, that they\u2019ve been discussing his arm, him, what to do with him. He rubs his face and tries to calm down.\n\u201cForgive me for worrying, but I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but your first instinct was to rip your own damn arm off with your bare hand, Bucky!\u201d Steve\u2019s saying, bright angry eyes and red cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna do anything without you okaying it, we just\u2014wanted to have options ready. Before we talked with you about it. So you didn\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTrapped,\u201d Bucky says, breathing through his nose. He gets it. Logically, he gets it. This isn\u2019t Hydra. They think he\u2019s a person. They care about how he feels. That he feels.\n\u201cWe were gonna ease you into it more, but then the scan showed radiation, and the time table kind of\u2014sped up.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to treat me with kid gloves, babe,\u201d Bucky says dully. They do. They do. He hates this. He wishes he could just\u2014rip. Rip it off. Rip the bad parts out of and off of him. It\u2019s not fair that he can\u2019t\u2014but he must have known, somewhere, in some forgotten programming, some old rust-brown lesson, than he couldn\u2019t. Or he\u2019d have done it already, a long time ago.\nHe\u2019s stuck the way he is.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Stark says, not looking at either of them. He\u2019s looking somewhere off in the distance, beyond the window, beyond maybe even the sky behind that. \u201cI know a thing or two about non-con body modifications that are killing you slowly, and, what do you know, I also have trust and control issues. So. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Here\u2019s your arm, JARVIS, blow it out for us, show the nerve attachments. Labels, yeah\u2014sure, add some Russian, why not.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bucky says, and takes a step closer, tilting his head to take it in. The arm. He\u2019s seen the innards, but not like this. Not without restraints on his arms, guns to his head, blood and smoke everywhere.\n\u201cSettle in, have a read. But this is the plan, which we have been discussing without you for some time, yes. That sucks. Sorry. But: zero restraints, you still conscious, you not assassinating me for causing mind-blowing pain as I detach that bomb you\u2019re walking around with, and at the end, you get a brand new, arc-reactor-powered arm which Steve has commissioned on your behalf and which I have spent a year designing.\u201d\nBucky doesn\u2019t say anything. Stark could have altered these scans. Could have tricked Steve. Could have\u2014but the snaking wires around his nerves, his veins, his bones. The power source that degrades and poisons him and everyone around him if he goes too long without a check-in. It does sound like Hydra. Sounds like something Bucky might even have heard being discussed around and over his head, a long time ago.\n\u201cThink about it?\u201d Steve asks softly, and rubs his hand up the arm. Bucky shudders, fighting the urge to tackle Steve away from\u2014himself. Fuck.\nSteve doesn\u2019t ask for a lot. Not out loud, just watches and hopes, with those eyes. It\u2019d be easier if he asked outright. Bucky, come inside, it\u2019s raining. Bucky, talk to me. Bucky, trust me. Bucky, be human again. \n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Bucky says, despite not wanting to, not wanting to at all. Steve smiles at him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking,\u201d he says, when he could ask for the moon and Bucky would try, try so hard, to give it to him. Doesn\u2019t know who he\u2019d have to kill to get ownership papers, but he\u2019d do it. It\u2019d be easier.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a while to think, I gotta readjust my specs. Those crazy Hydra bastards, hope Bruce is more up on neuroanatomy than I am,\u201d Tony mutters, wandering off with a wave over his shoulder. Bucky feels his body relax, slightly, infinitesimally, when it\u2019s just them and Stark\u2019s computers in the room.\n\u201cSorry, Buck,\u201d Steve sighs, moving in closer, until he\u2019s just barely brushing against Bucky\u2019s right side. He\u2019s hanging his head. He looks tired. \u201cI never meant to make you feel like we were making your decisions for you. That\u2019s not what I wanted at all.\u201d\n\u201cI know. \u2019s not you I\u2019m sore with, Steve,\u201d Bucky sighs back. He hesitates, then leans in and presses his mouth over Steve\u2019s, just to see Steve\u2019s pinched look vanish for a second, to feel Steve\u2019s lips curve into a smile. And maybe also because it makes Bucky feel a little warmer, a little less like a malfunctioning machine or a problem to solve.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s it like,\u201d he asks tentatively. \u201cThis drug you got. It won\u2019t\u2014\u201d of course it won\u2019t, Steve wouldn\u2019t do that to him, but he can\u2019t not ask, he has to ask \u201c\u2014make me forget?\u201d\n\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Steve says immediately. \u201cI remember you had that happen sometimes, with booze, so I checked. It just made everything bad, I dunno. Matter less? Everything that was nice got pumped up. Way my suit felt on my skin, the taste of Oreos. I liked it.\u201d He turns red, and Bucky cocks his head. \u201cI really liked you petting my hair.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Bucky replies, and smiling\u2019s not so hard, he thinks. He should try it more, for Steve. He reaches out, feeling clumsy and robotic even with his human hand, and tucks a strand of hair carefully behind Steve\u2019s ear. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad, I guess.\u201d\n***\nBucky keeps repeating that to himself as he lays down gingerly on a reinforced cot in Tony\u2019s lab a week later. Pillows and everything, sheets. It\u2019s not a chair at all. The sheets have cartoon Avengers on them; Stark thinks he\u2019s funny. Maybe it is a little funny. Maybe one day Bucky will laugh about this.\nBut right now, he doesn\u2019t want needles, he doesn\u2019t want drugs, he doesn\u2019t want Stark\u2019s hands on him. He wants to grab Steve and rabbit to the North Pole, to the ice and darkness where Bucky belongs, and where Steve doesn\u2019t. So Bucky can\u2019t do that. He can\u2019t leave Steve, so he\u2019s gotta stay here. Stay on this bed, on these stupid sheets, and get experimented on, again.\nIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not so bad, he lies to himself, every muscle tense. He finds himself opening his mouth for a guard and snaps it shut so hard his teeth hurt. Steve makes a worried sound.\n\u201cI promise, Hydra never gave you anything like this,\u201d Stark\u2019s rambling, tinkering with the IV, tapping a needle while Steve paces nearby. Hydra didn\u2019t ramble. Stark\u2019s annoying, but Bucky still... He appreciates it. The difference.\nThe arm has to come off, so Bucky\u2019s going to bear this. He examined the schematics in-depth over the last week, and it\u2019s\u2014exquisitely cruel, the way only Hydra can be. The inner workings of the arm are exactly beyond Bucky and his reach, his capabilities. Just close enough to be a torment. De-wiring the old and re-wiring the new is designed to hurt, and Bucky knows his programming, knows himself well enough to know how that will go.\nHe has enough blood on his hands without adding Steve\u2019s buddy to the list. But he can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t let himself be knocked out entirely. Even with Steve there. He can\u2019t. \nBut apparently even Hydra hadn\u2019t planned for Asgardian opioids. \nBucky\u2019ll be vulnerable. But Steve\u2019s here, and Stark\u2019s an ally, if not a friend.\n\u201cJust a pinch,\u201d Stark warns, and Bucky feels his entire body tense. Cold, it\u2019s inside and it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s\u2014\nIt\u2019s Steve\u2019s warm hand, rubbing his arm just above the needle.\n\u201c\u2019S fine, Buck,\u201d Steve says, hovering like a damn helicarrier. \u201cEverything\u2019s under control, you\u2019re gonna feel real good, no pain. You okay, Buck? We\u2019re alright. You\u2019re alright. You\u2019re doing so good.\u201d\n\u201cSo you say, pal,\u201d Bucky says, feeling waspish, buzzing and metallic and poisonous. He always feels like that, though, so he tries to summon up a smile again. Because it\u2019s Steve, Steve\u2019s trying so hard for him, every damn day, even with Bucky snapping and tense, leaking radioactive shit everywhere in more ways than one.\nSo Bucky can try, too. Pull out a smile, and it\u2019s just as hard every time, making sure it\u2019s not fake, finding something genuine.\nBut it\u2019s worth it for the way Steve\u2019s shoulders settle a little, his eyes brightening. And besides, the cold from the needle isn\u2019t so bad now. Not with Steve\u2019s hand on him, rubbing his veins warm. Like rubbing his hands together on a winter day, blowing on the tips of his fingers. Bringing the outside in.\nBut the cold goes down farther these days. Bucky\u2019s not sure even Steve, stubbornness personified, can reach it. But maybe trying to let him reach it is enough. It\u2019s probably the best he can do, so Bucky hopes so.\n\u201cShould be hitting soon,\u201d Stark says. \u201cStop hovering, Cap, pull up a chair. You know, I\u2019ve had less attractive but more terrifying nursemaids. You\u2019re a lucky man, Barnes. Think we could convince Cap to put on the appropriate outfit? Just for verisimilitude.\u201d\n\u201cLittle hat with a cross,\u201d Bucky says absently. He\u2019s staring at the needle in his arm, his arm, not the arm. Not the Asset\u2019s arm. This is Bucky\u2019s arm, and there\u2019s a needle in it. He kind of wants it out, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. He doesn\u2019t like the chill, though, and Steve\u2019s hand\u2019s not on him anymore. \u201cYeah, Stevie likes that. To dress up.\u201d\n\u201cBuck! Dammit, Tony. Don\u2019t start\u2014Bucky\u2019s compromised. Doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, you did dress up! This is the best day. Tell me there are pictures.\u201d\nNo. Too bad, Steve was pretty as a picture. In Bucky\u2019s uniform from the docks, eyebrow cocked and neckerchief knotted at his slender throat. Pretty. In stockings some dame left behind one night. In a USO skirt, or a striped French shirt, or with a rose tucked in his hair, extra red to his pout. Why\u2019d he done that? Playful. Silly. Making Bucky laugh. Bucky\u2019d forgotten they\u2019d done that. He\u2019s forgotten a lot.\n\u201cWe had some good times, huh, Rogers?\u201d he says, blinking, interrupting the bickering back-and-forth above him. \u201cLong time ago.\u201d Gone now. There\u2019s no more good times, just bombs and blood and Steve\u2019s battered face, Christ, he\u2019d hit Steve. Low as you could go. Anybody that hit Steve deserved a bomb for an arm, and a no man\u2019s land of mud and corpses for a head, and ice for veins.\nSomeone\u2019s petting his hair, and it is nice, it\u2019s really nice. Bucky shouldn\u2019t have it, it\u2019s too nice. But. The chill\u2019s not so bad now. It\u2019s funny. Bucky actually feels pretty warm. Like\u2014booze-warm, four bottles of Piel\u2019s down the throat warm. Spring, sweet and sunny, before summer starts stinking and sweating up the place. Melting, like butter in a pan.\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Bucky says, and blinks. He\u2019s butter. He\u2019s snow in the sun. Slush. Water. He blinks again, and the light gets trapped in his eyelashes. He tries to raise a hand to get it out, but someone gently presses him back down.\nIt\u2019s nice, he realizes with dawning wonder. He feels good. He didn\u2019t remember \u2013 could he always do that?\n\u201cAlright, Bucky?\u201d a worried voice says.\nBucky replies before he gets his eyes to work right, \u201cYou the nurse, sweetheart?\u201d Because he\u2019s supposed to have a nurse. Weren\u2019t they just saying that?\nBut no, it\u2019s better, it\u2019s Steve.\n\u201cSteve!\u201d Bucky says, delighted, and tries to sit up. Steve presses him down, big hand, so damned warm, and Bucky goes, smiling up at him. No restraints, just Steve\u2019s hands, like they\u2019d said. Steve never lies. Steve\u2019s the best, and he looks so good, lopsided frown, big blue eyes, damn. But he\u2019s frowning, he shouldn\u2019t be frowning when everything\u2019s this warm and nice. \u201cBaby doll, hi, baby.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyebrows move upwards, fast. Wow, he\u2019s gorgeous. Steve\u2019s just so pretty, even when he\u2019s frowning. \u201dYou come here often, doll?\u201d\n\u201cAnnnnd I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say operation nuclear disarmament is a go!\u201d another voice says, and something\u2019s happening with his shoulder, but Steve\u2019s on his right so Bucky can\u2019t be fucked to worry about it. \u201cThat hit fast, huh? You feel anything besides the need to drop some Paleolithic lines, Sergeant? The urge to maim or kill rising at all?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the blue face for, baby? Gimme a smile, doll. Pretty guy like you shouldn\u2019t be looking so glum,\u201d Bucky says, ignoring the ramble and the whirring noises coming from his left, thrilling to his toes when Steve\u2019s eyes crinkle up as he grins. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s what Bucky likes to see. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Gimme that smile. S\u2019all I need. Better than penicillin, pretty smile like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not pretty, Bucky. Or your nurse,\u201d Steve laughs, rolling those baby blues of his. But when Bucky fumbles around with the arm he can move, Steve catches his hand. So Bucky\u2019s lines are clearly excellent. It\u2019s so nice, Steve\u2019s big artist hands, the strong deft fingers, long and warm, and the familiar palm, Bucky\u2019s favorite hands. Through everything, thick and thin, small and tall, over seventy years this is one thing that didn\u2019t change much at all. Like the North Star with fingers.\n\u201cLove your hands, you never draw no more, Stevie, you gotta draw me something.\u201d\n\u201cSure, Buck,\u201d Steve says, and lets their fingers tangle. His fingers feels so good under Bucky\u2019s fingertips, shivery-fine. Bucky wants to kiss them, him. His pretty baby. \u201cSoon as we\u2019re done here, anything you want.\u201d\n\u201cSweet and pretty,\u201d Bucky says, awed. He feels like he\u2019s forgotten, somehow, what a jackpot he\u2019d won. Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes\u2019s fella. The hell\u2019d he ever do, to get a guy like this. He tugs at Steve\u2019s hand, serious now. Bucky has to let him know while he can still talk, while his words aren\u2019t all stuck up behind his teeth, in the brambles of his brain. \u201cPrettiest goddamn guy. You\u2019re a fucking doll, look at that face. I\u2019m serious. Even better than you look, and you look so good.\u201d\n\u201cOh, here we go,\u201d Steve says, but he\u2019s flushing pink, just like a rose, a sunrise.\n\u201cPerfect skin, you\u2019re a peach. Eyes? Bluer than blue, lashes for miles. Bluest eyes. Pretty. Gorgeous. God, you\u2019re swell. And lord a\u2019mighty, your mouth.\u201d Bucky untangles his hand to trace it. So soft. And it parts for him, lets him push down on that petal-soft pink lower lip. So good. \u201cSo good,\u201d he croons. \u201cSonnets. Poetry. Take \u2018em as written. I got no words, I just\u2014damn, baby. Got a kiss for me, Steve? I heard kisses are better even\u2019n smiles for anything that ails ya.\u201d\n\u201cBuck,\u201d Steve says, those gold lashes wide, and yeah, that\u2019s his dollbaby, heating up, he knows, Bucky knows that hot blue look. When\u2019d he see it last? Too long ago. \u201cSettle down, you gotta let Tony work.\u201d\n\u201cJust one taste, let me taste. You rationed, sugar?\u201d Bucky lets his voice drop low as he leans up. Something in his shoulder twinges, sparking shivers that don\u2019t feel so great, but now Steve\u2019s leaning in. Bucky lays back, encouraged. Licks his own lips and watches Steve\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cYeah, saving all my sugar for my best guy,\u201d Steve rasps. \u201cBuck, we\u2019re not\u2014ease up, Bucky. Tony, what the hell was in that mix you gave him? I wasn\u2019t like this!\u201d\n\u201cYou were definitely lazier. And less verbose. Huh. Maybe it\u2019s the higher dosage making the difference, or adrenaline\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour best guy, huh, must be a helluva fella,\u201d Bucky says hopefully, and grins like a dope, a total smack to the skull, when Steve stops talking at the other side of him and looks back down at Bucky and says:\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right, you are. Best guy I know, Buck.\u201d\nGod, Steve, he\u2019s so\u2014Steve, earnest and real and good and true, and Steve thinks Bucky\u2019s the best, and Bucky\u2019s his guy, his fella. Distantly Bucky knows he doesn\u2019t deserve this, doesn\u2019t deserve Steve, but Steve\u2019s here anyway and Bucky\u2019s over the moon, he can\u2019t handle it, he needs\u2014\nIt\u2019s been so long since he felt like this. They\u2019ve been kissing a little for a few weeks now. And it\u2019s good, it\u2019s careful and precise and better than anything Bucky thought was left in the world for him. He can barely let himself have it, most days. Steve deserves better, Bucky deserves worse, it\u2019s all so tangled in his head. Steve\u2019s been so steady, so patient, but Bucky\u2019s just felt... buried. Pressed like there\u2019s a damn mountain on his chest, all the things he\u2019s done stacked up like medieval torture, turning everything flat.\nHe doesn\u2019t feel any of that now. Everything that hurts feels far away, and he feels light, airy. Like champagne stolen in France, he\u2019s got bubbles in his veins, tickling and sweet. He could dance now, take Steve dancing. In Paris, in New York. Anywhere, how great is that? Kiss Steve drunk in the middle of the street. He wants to kiss Steve now, when he\u2019s feeling like this. Good, golden. Wants to feel Steve everywhere, all over, wants Steve to feel him.\n\u201cSteve, Stevie, just one kiss, baby,\u201d he begs, pouting and batting his own lashes, whining when Steve just cuffs the side of his head gently. He reaches out, hand grabbing at air. \u201cSteeeve, come on, some nurse you are. I gotta have just one kiss, I\u2019m dying, you\u2019re killing me, so far away.\u201d\n\u201cJust keep him still,\u201d someone laughs, and Bucky says, beaming, \u201cYeah, keep me still, Steve, come on.\u201d\nSteve smiles crookedly, leans in with a hand on Bucky\u2019s chest.\n\u201cOne kiss, and then you\u2019ll behave?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be so good,\u201d Bucky lies earnestly. And success. Steve settles his glorious, glorious ass on the side of the table and leans in. Speaking of sonnets that need to be written, Bucky will get right on that. Later. Right now\u2014\nSteve\u2019s nuzzling him, nose against Bucky\u2019s, mouth just barely parted against his. Press of lips, Bucky\u2019s hand in Steve\u2019s hair, it\u2019s so sweet, it\u2019s better than sugar, better than anything Bucky\u2019s tasted since the war ended and the Soldier began.\n\u201cBaby,\u201d Bucky says, in between hot, barely-wet kisses. \u201cOh, baby, oh.\u201d Messy, ragged gulps of breath between kisses. He\u2019s only got one hand to work with, the other pinned and weird, aching distantly, but one hand\u2019s all he needs, he remembers. He rakes his nails through the fine, damp hair at the back of Steve\u2019s neck, digging in just this side of too-hard. Steve moans into him, open-mouthed and shocked. That\u2019s money, take that to the bank. God, that\u2019s good.\n\u201cYeah, let me hear you,\u201d Bucky says dreamily, and bites at Steve\u2019s mouth, drinks in the tiny sounds Steve\u2019s making, little ohs and sighs and hitches of breath. Gives them back in hums and moans of his own. \u201cSo sweet, god, I told you, your mouth\u2014you make me feel so good. You feel good, Stevie? Want you to feel good.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I feel compelled to point out that this is considerably more than one kiss and I am also right here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here, you\u2019re here, Steve\u2019s here,\u201d Bucky agrees, and Steve\u2019s basically climbed on the table, plastered to Bucky\u2019s right side. Easy as anything to grab a handful of that ass and knead it. Holy grail of butts, all his. \u201cMmm, Steve\u2019s right here.\u201d\n\u201cBucky, you said you\u2019d behave,\u201d Steve mumbles into the side of Bucky\u2019s throat, but he\u2019s pushing his ass back into Bucky\u2019s hand. \u201cForgot how much you talked when we\u2014oh. Oh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky says fondly, hand down Steve\u2019s shorts. Smooth warm skin, curve of padded muscle, god, he wants his teeth in it. He slides one finger just at the top of the crease, and rubs, thinks about pressing open-mouthed kisses there, sliding down. He wants, he wants\u2014he kisses Steve\u2019s mouth open, strokes his tongue in deep and swirls it around Steve\u2019s. \u201cMmm, mmm, babydoll, wanna do this to you everywhere,\u201d he pulls back to say, in case Steve had missed the message. He rubs his hand further down Steve\u2019s ass. \u201cRemember? Kiss you open. Get you wet. Love that.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d someone mutters.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Steve bites out, high and breathy, pressing his forehead to Bucky\u2019s. Is there anything Bucky likes more than Steve swearing? Probably, but it\u2019s still up there. \u2018Fuck\u2019 sounds good in Steve\u2019s wet mouth. And there\u2019s a salute Steve\u2019s sporting in his trousers, just for Bucky, nudging against Bucky\u2019s hip. Bucky\u2019s proud for a moment, hotly dazedly proud that he can do this, to this man, but then\u2014bupkis.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d protests Bucky, mightily injured at the sudden lack of Steve beneath his fingers and lips. \u201cStevie, how could you do me like this? Kiss a man that way and then leave him hanging, that\u2019s cold. That\u2019s cold, doll.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not alone, Bucky!\u201d Steve hisses, wet-cat face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re drunk. High. Something!\u201d He settles in the chair by the table, hands in his lap. Gorgeous, all mussed and flushed. Bucky tries to sit up and it hurts but that doesn\u2019t matter, Steve\u2019s right there, hard and ready to be straddled, for Bucky\u2019s mouth to bloom kiss-shaped bruises on his throat and shoulders and thighs.\n\u201cJust feeling good, got me hot, Steve. Come back, come back,\u201d he croons, opens and closes his hand, reaching for him, stretching. But Steve\u2019s face looks\u2014\u201cDollface? Steve\u2014\u201d He struggles up.\n\u201cHey, hey, Capsicle, keep your boytoy under control! Delicate work, here! Mini nuclear reactor! With considerable amount of nasty goddamned traps set around it!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey, do whatever you want, I won\u2019t be looking. I\u2019ll be saving our lives by the skin of my teeth over here. You just keep his shoulders on the damn table.\u201d There\u2019s a saw buzzing, and Bucky glances over to see exposed bone, wires. Metal. They did that to him, he\u2019s not human, he\u2019s\u2014 Bucky looks up at the ceiling and pants, suddenly terrified he\u2019ll feel it again. Cold. He\u2019ll be cold.\n\u201cSteve, Steve don\u2019t leave me,\u201d Bucky pleads, and Steve\u2019s suddenly close again.\n\u201cI won\u2019t, I\u2019m here,\u201d Steve says, and fuck, that\u2019s a kiss, that\u2019s fierce, that\u2019s\u2014Buck feels it down to his boots, the sole and soul of him. Hot. Warm. \u201cBucky, Bucky.\u201d Kisses down his jawline, to the base of his throat. Bucky\u2019s heart beating for him, banging away at his chest like it wants to get out, get to Steve where it belongs. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, we\u2019re fine, I got you, whatever you want, Bucks, I love you, I got you,\u201d words mouthed into his skin, against his temple. \nBucky\u2019s stopped shaking so much, now. Steve\u2019s here. The kisses slow down, strung out like syrup, until finally Steve pulls back to look at him, damp hair flopping in his face, eyebrows pulled together and mouth crooked down.\n\u201cWith me now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You got me,\u201d Bucky says, and believes it. Feels it in his bones, exposed or not. Steve wouldn\u2019t lie to him. Steve loves him. He\u2019s here. Wants to be here. \u201cC\u2019mere. Come back, get up here with me.\u201d But Steve\u2019s got his constipated face on, ugh.\n\u201cJust. You\u2019re buzzing hard, Buck. I don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t want, okay? Or for you to be. Embarrassed. Later.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t nothing you could do with me I\u2019d be embarrassed of, Steve,\u201d Bucky says, indignant, trying to sit up against before he remembers to lay back and be still. \u201cAnd I want you. Anything with you. I just forgot we could feel this good.\u201d He makes his eyes real big and bites his lower lip and hopes. \u201cHelp me remember, Steve?\u201d\nAnd Steve\u2014maybe some of this juice buzzing through Bucky gives off a contact high, because Steve just melts, face dissolving from worry into something softer, adoring and sweet. Makes Bucky\u2019s toes curl.\n\u201cOkay. Okay, but. Just kissing, until you sober up,\u201d Steve says then, in his firmest command voice, the little twerp. He cups Bucky\u2019s cheek and looks him dead in the eye. \u201cHand to yourself, mister.\u201d\n\u201cScout\u2019s honor,\u201d Bucky says sweetly, and proceeds to start kissing the ever-loving hell out of Steve\u2019s hand, laughing around Steve\u2019s fingers when Steve squeaks and swears.\nSteve\u2019s skin tastes so good. Always did, still does. Clean sweat, the salty taste bursting in Bucky\u2019s mouth, and it\u2019s so easy to lose himself in tracing the swirl of fingerprints with his tongue, bite at Steve\u2019s thumb, kiss it better. Tries three, then four fingers, and loves the stretch of it in his mouth, the weight on his tongue. Not Steve\u2019s cock, but \u2018s nice.\nSteve\u2019s saying his name, over and over, and there\u2019s the slick sound of Bucky\u2019s mouth, and the thud thud thud of his own heartbeat in his ears.\nAnd then, the sound of a clunk, and lightness\u2014the arm\u2019s off. It\u2019s off, they did it, no one died, and Steve\u2019s face is desperate and gorgeously contorted. His free fist\u2019s clenched in the sheets by Bucky\u2019s head, and he\u2019s hunched over, looking at Bucky like Bucky did something miraculous, when he\u2019s just giving Steve\u2019s hand a suckjob to tide them over.\nSteve looks blown, though, eyes dark and breath ragged. Bucky knows that face, knows that shocked, wide-eyed look means Steve\u2019s about to lose it. He always looks so surprised by his own pleasure, each time. How\u2019d Bucky forget that?\n\u201cYou look so pretty when you\u2019re about to come for me,\u201d he says dreamily, rubbing Steve\u2019s spit-slick fingers over his lips. Kisses the fine skin of Steve\u2019s wrist, open mouthed. Just kisses. Just kisses, he\u2019s being good. \u201cFeels good. How long\u2019s it been? Too long, god, too long for me and you. I want it, want you in me, on me.\u201d\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says, voice strangled and rasping, eyes huge. Beautiful.\nThere\u2019s a clanking noise, and then Bucky jerks, full-body, as something staticky and electric goes through his left side. Hurts, but he doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s fine. Fading fast, and the fingers\u2014his left hand, his new fingers\u2014flex easy.\n\u201cAnnnnnd we\u2019re done! I\u2019m just gonna\u2014\u201d Bucky turns to see Tony\u2019s back, heading fast for the door. \u201cFind\u2014a shower. Pepper. Something. Great bedside manner, Cap, you\u2019re a natural.\u201d The man tosses off a salute before slamming the door behind him. \nBucky realizes that a) this means they\u2019re alone, and b) he has two hands now. He sets to pulling Steve on top of him. Shoves Steve\u2019s shorts down, gives his exposed cock a sloppy, sassy salute of his own because hey there, Captain. Steve\u2019s panting as he stares at Bucky, open mouthed, hips moving restlessly. So pretty, so pretty, goddamn.\n\u201cJust you and me now,\u201d he husks, and wraps Steve\u2019s spit-slick hand around his own cock, gives him a couple strokes to get him going. \u201cCome on, baby, come on, gimme it, I wanna see it, come all over me, I want it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Steve grits out, then he\u2019s slamming his mouth down on Bucky\u2019s. There\u2019s nothing but wet sounds: kissing, Steve\u2019s wet hand moving, Steve\u2019s desperate little whines into Bucky\u2019s mouth and then he\u2019s pulling away, again.\n\u201cWait, Bucky,\u201d he pants. \u201cI can\u2019t, you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSteeeeve,\u201d Bucky complains, and latches on to Steve\u2019s back, holding him in place. He knows what Steve likes, hand on the back of his neck with Bucky\u2019s nails digging in, hard, then soft. Other hand at the small of his back, urging him down. His new arm is strong, too. Softer, though, the edges smoother. He can touch Steve with it.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want this before,\u201d Steve gasps, and his face twists between slack with pleasure and frowning with worry. \u201cNot like this. Why\u2014why now, is it just the drugs\u2014Bucky, I don\u2019t want you to do anything you don\u2019t want, god, Buck. Hold off a second, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI want it, \u2018s not the drugs. Just you and me,\u201d Bucky assures him fervently, rolling his hips up and laughing, smugly delighted, when Steve\u2019s eyes unfocus slightly.\nBucky thinks he must be coming down a little\u2014the ache in his shoulder is bothering him more. And his own erection feels much, much more important than it had minutes previously, back when it was just a pleasant awareness of something new. Something else he\u2019d forgotten he could do, and feel, and have.\nBut Steve\u2019s sitting back on his heels, shaking his head and breathing out in long, careful breaths.\nBucky feels panicked, jittered. He can\u2019t\u2014he can\u2019t lose this now, not when he can\u2019t be sure he\u2019ll have it later, be able to let himself have it. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he pleads again, and sucks in breaths. \u201cSteve, please. I just wanna feel good with you. Don\u2019t you want it?\u201d\n\u201cBuck, you know I do.\u201d He takes Bucky\u2019s new hand slowly, and kisses the palm. Bucky lets him, watches with wide eyes. The new hand. His hand. He can feel it. \u201cYou\u2019re the definition of temptation, you know that? But I\u2019d rather never have sex again than hurt you. I\u2019d go full castrato first.\u201d His smile wobbles a bit. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me singing soprano, do you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d It\u2019s a joke. Gotta be a joke, but no, Bucky knows Steve, knows that face, knows that stubborn set of jaw, that streak of self-sacrifice and righteousness. The fucker might actually mean it.\n\u201cSo you gotta tell me,\u201d Steve presses on, big earnest eyes, leaning his soft cheek against Bucky\u2019s palm. \u201cYou need anything: sex, no sex, sex in public, sex in a nurse get-up, whatever. I\u2019m here for you. Anything. But why now? Why not before? I can\u2019t do anything until I know, Bucky.\u201d\n\u201cFine, god,\u201d Bucky huffs, but he\u2019s trying, he\u2019s trying to think of the words that will make it okay. Make Steve realize why it\u2019s okay. \u201cIt\u2019s just, my head\u2019s so loud, usually, and\u2014busy. I dunno. You get into trouble. And I could hurt you. Other people could hurt you. All I can think about.\u201d Steve kisses his new hand again, softly, and Bucky closes his eyes, it\u2019s so nice. \u201cAnd besides. Feeling good, it\u2019s not for me anymore. But for right now it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it? For right now?\u201d\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says thickly, and kisses up Bucky\u2019s arm until he\u2019s kissing the snarled mess of scars and then the side of his neck, and then across his face. He kisses Bucky, again and again, until Bucky opens his eyes. \u201cYou deserve to feel good. You do. All the time. Any time.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018f you say so, Stevie,\u201d Bucky says dubiously. He makes a low, startled sound of happiness when Steve really settles in between Bucky\u2019s thighs. He takes his shirt off, tosses it somewhere, then presses his perfect hot skin to Bucky\u2019s cold patchwork body. Bucky immediately takes the opportunity to wrap his limbs around him so he can\u2019t get away.\n\u201cI do say so. And you said something about liking my mouth, earlier, right?\u201d Steve says, and bites Bucky\u2019s throat just right, just like Bucky likes, wet and stinging and soft all at once. Then he moves down and tugs at a nipple with his teeth.\n\u201cSo much. Love it,\u201d Bucky agrees immediately. \u201cBest goddamn mouth in the history of mouths.\u201d\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d Steve says, looking up at Bucky with his wet red mouth and gold lashes and blue eyes. Primary, patriotic. Beautiful. \u201cWherever you want, whenever you want, Buck. Just ask.\u201d\n\u201cPut your mouth on my mouth,\u201d Bucky says immediately. \u201cYou can suck me later, I just wanna keep you like this for now.\u201d Safe, wrapped in Bucky\u2019s arms. With him, on top of him, everywhere. \u201cCome in our pants, like when we were kids, drunk on Dad\u2019s whiskey. Get fancy later.\u201d He pauses, unsure for a moment, because Steve\u2019s gone quiet, is just panting and nuzzling. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d\n\u201cReally, really okay,\u201d Steve says, raising his head. He kisses Bucky, hard, smacking their noses together, teeth clashing. He\u2019s beaming all over his stupid, flushed face. \u201cYou remember that? Our first time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You were lighter. Looked like a damn dream, up there.\u201d Bucky puts his hands on Steve\u2019s hips, thumbs the hipbones, and pulls him down. \u201cShove up a little? Lemme see you now. God, you\u2019re a bombshell. The curves on you these days. Better rack than any broad, I swear. Hey!\u201d he laughs, when Steve scowls jokingly and tweaks one of Bucky\u2019s nipples. Bucky retaliates by leaning up\u2014better abs, now, he can just sit up and bite back. \u201cAh, and then you made that same face. Just like that. Like you can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s just. So. Good. So good, baby, you like that?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s letting him set the pace, letting Bucky get his hands on each cheek and pull Steve down onto him, a rocking, rolling rhythm. Like a dance.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve pants. \u201cYeah, yes, Bucky, Buck. Yes.\u201d\n\u201cGonna take you dancing,\u201d Bucky breathes, staring up at Steve\u2019s stupid, sweet, pole-axed face. \u201cDon\u2019t let me forget, gonna take you\u2014ahh, baby, baby, that\u2019s it, you close, baby?\u201d\n\u201cBeen close since you kissed me,\u201d Steve admits, breathing hard. \u201cIt\u2019s been\u2014been a long time, Bucky.\u201d\n\u201cFor me too, doll,\u201d Bucky says, suspecting his face is just as dopey as Steve\u2019s, but who cares. \u201cBeen saving my sugar for you, too.\u201d He snickers in between thrusts, breathy and happy. \u201cAnd my syrup.\u201d\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve laughs, looking disgusted and delighted. \u201cGonna give it to me?\u201d\nBucky wants to sass something about pancakes and sausage, but Steve\u2019s got himself braced now, a hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder, and he\u2019s pushing down just right. Like the world\u2019s best lapdance, like he\u2019s got the person he loves most in the world grinding down on him, making high, breathy noises and each grind of his hips is so good\u2014Bucky can\u2019t speak, can only pull Steve in and clutch at him as he comes, and Steve chokes out his name and comes too, just like before, with his teeth in Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\nSomehow, when he can think again, Bucky finds them slumped together on the Hulk and Hawkeye patterned sheets. Steve\u2019s propped on his elbows, staring down at him with that shocked, awestruck look Bucky loves so much.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened,\u201d he says wonderingly, then slowly lowers himself to kiss the corner of Bucky\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat am I saying, of course I can. It\u2019s you.\u201d He kisses Bucky again, slower now, with lots of nuzzling and sighs. \u201cNot sure that was the best idea, but. God. God, Bucky, what you do to me. Love to see you smile. Love you.\u201d\n\u201cLove you, too,\u201d Bucky says dreamily, and wraps Steve in his arms\u2014two of them, he\u2019s got two now, and they\u2019re both his. None of them Hydra, all his, and he can give Steve this now without feeling like Bucky\u2019s embrace is smearing blood all over him.\n***\nBucky wakes up in their room, hours later. It\u2019s daylight, and he\u2019s warm. Warm everywhere. Even his new arm is warm, which means he really owes Stark a thank you. Even with Steve sleeping on top of it like he is now, the old arm would have had a cold inner core. Nothing but superficial heat.\nHe touches Steve\u2019s hair with his free hand, and keeps it there even after Steve opens an eye.\n\u201cMorning, beautiful,\u201d Steve rasps, taking the other half of his face out of the pillow and smiling over at Bucky hopefully.\nBucky flexes his fingers beneath Steve\u2019s body, then digs a finger into Steve\u2019s armpit. He frees his arm while Steve\u2019s squirming and yelping, then flicks him gently between the eyes.\n\u201cYou go blind after all that sinnin\u2019 last night, Rogers?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re the only one who can wax poetic?\u201d Steve says, smile full-on silly now. \u201cI can\u2019t moon over my gorgeous guy a little, after a good night together?\u201d He bites his lip, flicking his eyes away, then back. \u201cYou did have a good night, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo nightmares,\u201d Bucky agrees, then leans in to rub his nose against Steve\u2019s. \u201cArm\u2019s good.\u201d He waits just long enough for Steve\u2019s eyebrows to pull in slightly. \u201cGreat sex,\u201d he finishes. \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\u201cJerk,\u201d Steve sighs, and runs a hand over the curve of Bucky\u2019s side.\n\u201cPunk,\u201d Bucky returns, but it\u2019s been\u2014he\u2019s awake now, sober, and he hasn\u2019t checked the perimeter, and he doesn\u2019t have any weapons on him anywhere, and he doesn\u2019t know what this new arm is capable of yet. He feels itchy. \u201cGotta get up.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve says peaceably, having watched Bucky leave the bed for these walkabouts before. Many times per night, even. He watches Bucky pull the knife from the slot behind the bedframe, stalk around the room sweeping for bugs\u2014their room they sleep in is the only one that\u2019s unwired from the mainframe of the Tower, even from Jarvis. No mechanics, no electronics but what\u2019s necessary to set up the Faraday cage around them, nothing else but Bucky\u2019s arm. Only way to reach them is to come yourself, or send a message with a robot.\nBucky thinks, suddenly, that was probably a lot of work to set up. Just to give a paranoid amnesiac brainwashed assassin a place he feels safe enough to sleep.\nHe\u2019s gotta thank Stark. Tony. Whatever.\n\u201cHey, Bucky,\u201d Steve says as Bucky\u2019s pulling up his boxers over his calf and thigh holsters.\u201cYou know, you do. You do deserve to feel good.\u201d Bucky freezes, one leg in, one leg out. \u201cAnd you can ask me for anything, anything you want me to do to you. And you can do anything to me. With me. You don\u2019t gotta ask me if you want to touch me, or kiss me, or\u2014whatever. Anything at all. Permission granted, forever.\u201d\n\u201cAnything,\u201d Bucky says slowly, because that\u2019s\u2014he\u2019d worried, a little, when he woke up. That he wouldn\u2019t be able to feel it again, that hot flush of want, not without chemical intervention. Except. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Steve says easily, like it is that easy. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want anything, that\u2019s okay, too, Buck.\u201d\nBucky pauses in picking which guns to keep and which to leave and returns to the bed for a thorough kiss that leaves both their heart-rates moderately increased. Bucky can hear his, and Steve\u2019s. Can feel it in his throat, in the throb of his lips. \n\u201cI want things,\u201d Bucky says into the space between them, heart still hammering. Nothing hurts. It\u2019s okay.\nSteve beams at him, keeps beaming as Bucky moves away, and somehow, illogically, Bucky feels confident, positive, certain Steve\u2019s still beaming when Bucky retreats into the bathroom for quick ablutions and evacuations.\nSteve is indeed still beaming when Bucky re-emerges, hair wet and slicked back. He ties it back with an elastic and continues dressing. Mostly blacks and greys, because it\u2019s more functional, more efficient, but Steve\u2014he used to say he liked Bucky in blue. Makes your eyes glow, he\u2019d said, slanting a grin up over his sketchpad. Like the dawn sky with the sun coming up. The sappy little shit.\nBucky puts on a navy shirt, then layers a black vest over it.\nHe waits to ask until he\u2019s half-out the open window. \u201cHey, Steve.\u201d He flicks a glance back, and meets Steve\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want you to have to ask?\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Steve says. He\u2019s sitting in the morning sunshine, sheets puddled around his waist. His hair looks ridiculous. He looks happy. There\u2019s a red mark on his neck, slowly fading. Bucky wants to get back in bed with him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time. Come get breakfast when you\u2019re done?\u201d\nBucky nods, and goes.\n***\nBucky pauses, taking in the situation. Sunday breakfast. Avengers, all present. Pancakes, bacon, potatoes, sausage, eggs, a variety of fruits on the table. Syrup. Ketchup. Various condiments and cutlery. All the body language and vital stats appear normal\u2014unlikely to be imposters. All hands visible. Safe to approach.\nAdditional observation: Steve has a nurse\u2019s cap perched on his blond head. Crisp and white, with a red cross on the front. Difficult to determine who is responsible for this, but he suspects Natasha, given how pleased she looks with herself. Regardless, Steve is wearing it with aplomb and without shame.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it was like,\u201d Tony is saying, gesticulating vehemently with a piece of pineapple. \u201cI thought\u2014I thought Cap was a virgin! And then they had sex on top of me. Two of the hottest men in the world! While I was trying to defuse bombs!\u201d\n\u201cYou thought he was a virgin?\u201d Natasha says, amused, while Steve, faintly red, is protesting.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t on top of you! It was more, um. Adjacent. And you left before\u2014um.\u201d Bucky smirks at the blush spreading down Steve\u2019s neck. \u201cAnything. Ah\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m hot?\u201d Bucky contributes, because he still has Steve\u2019s six. He drops down from the top of the fridge and everyone but Natasha and Clint jump. Bucky locks eyes with Steve.\n\u201cWell, yeah! Murderously so, but still,\u201d Tony says, after he stops choking on tropical fruit. He waves a hand up and down appreciatively in Bucky\u2019s general direction. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve got my tech on you, there\u2019s an exponential increase in hotness. Not as hot as my girlfriend, obviously, literally or figuratively. But hey, speaking of firecrackers, how\u2019s the arm? I didn\u2019t get a chance to run specs. For some reason.\u201d\n\u201cIt functions well outside combat,\u201d Bucky says, not looking away from Steve, who\u2019s tilted the cap to a jaunty angle and is waggling his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a good arm.\u201d He hesitates, then adds, \u201cThank you. Tony.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence before Tony clears his throat and says, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s a lot of syllables, Buck,\u201d Clint says, sounding impressed. \u201cBefore coffee and everything.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea how many syllables that man is capable of,\u201d Tony hisses, but Bucky doesn\u2019t have time for them. He wends his way around the table to steal the bacon from Steve\u2019s plate.\n\u201cLookin\u2019 good, doll,\u201d he says between crunches.\n\u201cI made you your own plate, jerk,\u201d Steve complains, but he\u2019s beaming up at Bucky. Bucky takes the plate, heaped with food, more maybe even that Bucky needs. He stands behind Steve to eat it, listening to the conversation resume around them. Then, eventually, he lets himself slide into the seat on Steve\u2019s right. Steve always leaves a seat empty for him, but this is only the second time Bucky\u2019s taken it. It\u2019s only the fourth time Bucky\u2019s done more than look in on the Sunday breakfast ritual.\n\u201cPass the syrup,\u201d he murmurs, and enjoys the way Steve immediately starts coughing. He makes sure to let his fingers brush Steve\u2019s as the pass-off is conducted. And to lick a stray droplet off his wrist after he\u2019s finished dousing his plate. Steve\u2019s eyes dilate and his fingers tighten on his fork to the point of bending it.\nConclusion: I\u2019ve still got it, Bucky thinks smugly. \nHe keeps an eye on the room around them while he eats, one hand always free. Romanov and Barton are armed despite still being clad in sleepwear - both of them in pajamas inexplicably decorated with cartoon foxes. Wilson, Lewis, and Foster are unarmed and unlikely to present a threat. Banner is always a threat, armed or not, which is oddly comforting. And the Hulk is at least easily diverted. Stark has a random screwdriver he\u2019s gesticulating with. Threat level high, despite current lack of suit. Jarvis is not engaging in conversation currently, but has assured Bucky already this afternoon that no dangerous subroutines have been added overnight and assisted Bucky with checking the external building for weaknesses.\nSteve, Bucky notices suddenly, has switched his fork from his right to his left hand. Bucky knows he\u2019s perfectly dexterous with both, has been since he was a kid. Serum didn\u2019t change that. Still, Steve prefers his right hand be dominant. Now it\u2019s empty, sitting on the table in between them, palm up.\n\u201cSo the decoction was successful?\u201d Thor inquires from across them, after obtaining a fifth helping of potatoes. Bucky waits for someone else to respond, but when no one does, gives a curt nod in the Norse God\u2019s direction. \u201cI am glad to hear so. The healing of great warriors fresh from battle can be a difficult thing. I myself have partaken, and the Warriors Three as well, that we might not be a danger to those serving us.\u201d\n\u201cOhhh, I remember that,\u201d Foster says, with a reminiscent tone, and Lewis chimes in with additional details. Bucky ignores the conversation in favor of shifting his fork to his right hand. He experimentally sets his empty left on the table by Steve\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t look at Steve.\nThe chatter around them is continuing.\n\u201cSounds like good stuff,\u201d Clint is saying, leaning in interestedly around Natasha. \u201cHey, Bruce, maybe it'd help you, too.\u201d\n\u201cOh hell, no,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWe\u2019re not having a high, horny Hulk in Manhattan. Who knows what he\u2019d hump, huh? I\u2019m not being responsible for the honor of Lady Liberty.\u201d\nThe new prosthetic really is aesthetically pleasing. The inner adamantium plates are covered by a nanopolymer sheath. It\u2019s soft and smooth. It conducts body heat well. Bucky can feel his pinky brush Steve\u2019s. It\u2019s warm. His cheeks are strangely warm, too. \nThe drugs had hampered Bucky\u2019s situational awareness, dulled his senses. It\u2019s harder to touch Steve now, in the light of day, sober, with his brain a snarl of instinct, embedded with danger like a mined field, but it\u2019s also more real. Less like a dream, all soft-edged and intangible and hard to believe in.\nYou don\u2019t have to ask, Steve had said, so Bucky doesn\u2019t. He just takes Steve\u2019s hand in his and laces their fingers together. He doesn\u2019t breathe for a moment, vision graying slightly, sparkling with phosphenes like electricity, but nothing bad happens. Steve just squeezes his hand very, very slightly, and when Bucky flicks a glance at his face, he\u2019s smiling at his pancakes. The nurse hat of his slips down slightly.\nThe Asgardian drugs had been helpful, Bucky concludes, but Steve\u2014Steve\u2019s better. He\u2019s the best thing in Bucky\u2019s entire world, always has been. And Bucky gets to touch him. It\u2019s okay.\nIt\u2019s a good morning to be alive, Bucky thinks, breathing deep, and steals a bite of Steve\u2019s pancakes."
