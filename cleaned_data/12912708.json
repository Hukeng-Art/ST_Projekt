    "text": "Tony\u2019s spent his entire life lying to people in one way or another.\nIt\u2019s a fact that, amongst other things, makes him a less than ideal role model but, in his minimum defense, Tony likes to maintain that he\u2019d come by the skill honestly at least.\nThe rest of his impressive laundry list of character defects he\u2019d picked up along the way in bits and pieces.\nBut the lying?\nYeah, that Tony had learned  young. \u00a0Had picked it up at Maria\u2019s knee, had it pressed into his bones with the heavy weight of the back of Howard\u2019s hand.\nAnd, like with anything else Tony put his massive intellect towards, he\u2019d excelled at it from an early age.\nHe\u2019d developed a bit of a routine with it too, had picked up tips and tricks along the way that made the lies easier, better, more  solid.\nHe was young, only seven or so, when he learned a twofold skill that would help to push him through the rest of his life.\nThe first half was to pretend to be a great deal  less intelligent than he was while still being an undeniable genius. \u00a0It was a tightrope of sorts that he learned to walk quickly and carefully, all too aware of Howard\u2019s growing resentment.\nThe second half of that lesson was to  always lie about his childhood, about Maria and Howard and what life was like growing up with the both of them.\nTony knew that nothing good would come out of anyone finding out about what life had been like for him inside the manor.\nHe was fifteen going on sixteen and fresh out of having Sunset Bain rip his heart to  pieces when he learned to how lie to a lover until they proved they were worthy of the truth.\nWhich, so far, none of them ever have.\nIn the aftermath of that Tony had also learned to always give a half truth about any romantic entanglement someone questioned him about unless he found the association completely and totally  distasteful.\nAnd, from his time with Rhodey in MIT, he also learned to always embellish jokes and stories, to add hints of the ridiculous to the mundane in order to get the greatest effects.\nOr, just because they always made his best friend smile and laugh.\nBut one of the most important truths he learned about lying was to always,  always, be honest with the company. \u00a0SI, it\u2019s employees, it\u2019s goals, the company as a whole was too important, had too much of an impact on other things, to ever lie about anything even tangentially related to it.\nIn the end, SI and all of its associated issues became the one area of his life where Tony practiced honesty without fail.\nHe\u2019d made a game of the lying everywhere else though, had turned it into a bit of a pastime when he was younger and never really bothered to drop the habit. \u00a0He\u2019d spent a good fraction of his free time playing around with reporters and the paparazzi, had enjoyed twisting their expectations of him to suit his moods.\nHe\u2019d been young and bitter then though. \u00a0Had been tired of living under a microscope and chafing at the bit of expectations he\u2019d never asked for, all while being determined to get as much out of it as he could.\nSo he\u2019d twisted fact and given half truths and outrageous lies and ignored the way it  stung when they were all believed so very easily. \u00a0Even when it meant ignoring any evidence the the contrary that might pop up.\nNow though, after a lifetime of practice, the lying has lost a lot of its shine. \u00a0It\u2019s become less of a  game and more of a tedious but second nature kind of reflex that he had down to a bit of an art form.\nNow, if he has to or if he wants to for whatever reason, Tony can lie as easily and intricately as he builds.\nLike with coding or robotics he can make an untruth  sing.\nHe still enjoys it sometimes, in a melancholy and faintly bitter kind of way. \u00a0It\u2019s a part of him that he knows reflects on what kind of person he truly is but it\u2019s a skill he\u2019s also grateful to have most of the time. \u00a0That ability to trade off dishonesty for truth and then back again in the blink of an eye without anyone being the wiser.\nIt\u2019s protected him in so many different ways over the years.\nRhodey\u2019s always warned him it would come back to bite him in the ass one day but Tony\u2019s pretty sure he never expected it to happen like  this.\nBut, to be fair, futurist or not, neither had Tony.\nHe never expected that one day he would find himself in a situation where he was being completely and totally  honest with the press in a way that didn't involve SI.\nOr that, in that moment, not a single one of them would even come  close to believing him.\n\u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d Tony tells the reporters in the room.\nTells the whole entire  world.\nAnd then the entire world just collectively goes \u2026\n Bullshit.\n~~~\n\u201cStop laughing,\u201d Tony pouts at Rhodey from where he\u2019s sulking on the couch.\nIt\u2019s been a few hours now since the disastrous press conference where Tony outed himself as a superhero and  no one believed him  and the sting  still hasn\u2019t faded.\n\u201cI  can\u2019t,\u201d Rhodey wheezes. \u00a0He\u2019s bent double, hands on his knees, shoulders heaving and face red.\nThere are real, honest to Tesla  tears in his eyes.\n\u201cI hope you suffocate,\u201d Tony hisses at him once they hit the fifteen minute mark and Rhodey shows no signs of stopping.\nEvery time Rhodey seems like he\u2019s close to getting it back under control he\u2019ll just  look  at Tony and then it  starts all over again.\n\u201cWorth it,\u201d Rhodey chokes out as another round of laughter takes him over.\nTony kind of hates him a lot.\nLike,  a lot a lot.\n~~~\nTony loves Rhodey more than anyone else in his life.\nBecause, no matter what, Rhodey\u2019s  always had his back.\nFrom MIT all the way to a desert in Afghanistan and out the other side again Rhodey\u2019s always been there for him.\nAnd Tony is so,  so grateful.\n~~~\n\u201cProud of you,\u201d Rhodey bumps their shoulders together and manages to rasp out later on that night, a few beers and two pizza\u2019s into a rare quiet night together.\nHis voice is legitimately hoarse from all the laughter and Tony has very real plans to put glitter in his shower head at the next possible opportunity.\nBut for now Tony just leans his head against Rhodey\u2019s shoulder and  smiles.\nRhodey believes him, knows that Tony was telling the  truth. \u00a0After his laughter had faded he\u2019d been worried if supportive about Tony\u2019s plans to continue being Iron Man.\nSo, all in all, Tony\u2019s going to be counting it as a win.\nBecause even if the entire rest of the world doesn\u2019t believe him, doesn\u2019t believe  in him, as long as Rhodey does Tony knows he can handle anything that gets thrown his way.\n~~~\nA large part of Tony is sure that it\u2019ll all blow over, that the world cannot  possibly be that oblivious and almost willfully blind.\nPeople are going to realize that he\u2019s Iron Man soon enough.\nIt only makes logical sense as Tony has no intention of stopping and no intention of really hiding that it\u2019s him wearing the armor.\nSo yeah, this whole misunderstanding thing won\u2019t,  can\u2019t, last long at all.\nTony just knows it.\n~~~\nTurns out that this is one area where Tony, like another famous Stark, apparently knows  nothing.\n~~~\nTony\u2019s self aware enough to admit that he\u2019s a bit bitter about the whole thing by the time New York rolls around.\nHe\u2019s been Iron Man for long enough now that the entire world should know the truth.\nIron Man\u2019s identity should be  common fucking knowledge.\nBut, instead, he\u2019s managed to make it this far with a total of five people, not counting JARVIS and the bots, knowing it\u2019s him\u00a0inside the armor.\nRhodey, Pepper, Happy, Fury, and Coulson.\nThat\u2019s it.\nThat\u2019s the entire roster of people who are officially\u00a0in the know.\nApparently the idea that\u00a0Tony Stark  could be a hero is so hard for people to grasp that they\u2019d all rather collectively dismiss the idea altogether.\nSo yeah, he\u2019s more than a bit bitter, more than a bit stung.\nHe thought for sure New York would change things but somehow it miraculously  hadn\u2019t.\nHell he\u2019d been falling through space and somewhere in the back of his head all he\u2019d been able to think was, \u2018welp at least if they find  my corpse in the armor they\u2019ll finally believe me\u2019.\nIt, unfortunately, hadn\u2019t worked out like that in the end.\nInstead he\u2019d gone through the wormhole, had fallen back out of it, and then been caught by the Hulk who\u2019d dropped him on a rooftop. \u00a0He\u2019d apparently been  roared back to life  and then Rhodey had swooped down in War Machine and carted him off back to the Tower.\nThere\u2019d been no \u2018big reveal moment\u2019 but Tony\u2019s still pretty sure that it\u2019s undeniably obvious that it\u2019s him in the armor now.\nAfterwards, once Loki and Thor are on their way back to Asgard, Tony\u2019s kind of expecting it when Rogers corners him.\nCaptain Asshole\u2019s obviously got some choice words to say about Tony being an official Avenger now.\nNot that it matters because Tony\u2019s ready for whatever he spits in his direction.\nBut, in the end, not even that goes as Tony expects it to. \u00a0Rogers, or rather  Steve  as the man surprisingly insists, is all bashful and almost  sunny as he apologizes for being rude on the helicarrier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough time for me,\u201d Steve tells him, soft and sad, blue eyes wide and strangely compelling. \u00a0\u201cI know that\u2019s no excuse, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. \u00a0I hope we can move past it in the future though. \u00a0With you being a part of the team, and even without that, I\u2019d like us to be friends.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony blinks and nods, struck just a bit dumb by the one-eighty Steve\u2019s personality has seemingly done. \u00a0Gone\u2019s the hardass Captain America from before and in his place is this bashful giant of a man who, somehow, makes Tony  more nervous than the Cap he\u2019d met on the helicarrier ever had. \u201cNo problem Cap. \u00a0I was a asshole too so no hard feelings.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Tony,\u201d Steve smiles, bright and surprisingly toothy, \u201cyou\u2019re a swell guy.\u201d\nHe\u2019s so earnest in that moment that Tony\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to break out into some kind of rash because he  has to be allergic to that much sincerity by now.\n\u201cMaybe I can call round the Tower sometime soon when I\u2019ve got more time,\u201d Steve says then. \u00a0\u201cWe can have a chance to talk a bit more.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony shrugs. \u00a0\u201cTower\u2019s always open for you and the others. \u00a0Feel free to drop in whenever.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. \u00a0It was good to see you Tony.\u201d Steve nods, turns and gets a few steps away before he stops and swings back around. \u201cOh and Tony?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cMake sure you tell Iron Man how much we all appreciated his help. \u00a0I\u2019m glad to know that fall didn\u2019t take him down for good so let him know that we hope he makes a quick recovery.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing Cap,\u201d Tony nods again before his brain really catches up with what Steve just said.\nSteve smiles again, turns on his heel, and strides away. \u00a0Tony\u2019s pretty sure he can hear the national anthem playing in the distance but it could just be too much caffeine and not enough sleep playing tricks on him again.\nBehind him Tony finally registers what Steve had actually  said instead of what Tony had initially heard and his mind\u2019s abruptly filled with a loud error noise.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Tony says softly but with a great depth of feeling, \u201cthe  actual fuck just happened?\u201d\n\u201cI believe, Sir,\u201d JARVIS pipes up from the phone in his pocket, there\u2019s an unnecessary amount of what sounds like glee in his voice, \u201cthat you\u2019ve once again managed to maintain your closely guarded secret identity. \u00a0Truly your subterfuge skills know no bounds.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole J,\u201d Tony mutters back as he reaches up to rub at his temple. \u00a0He either has a headache coming on or a blood clot. \u00a0At this point he\u2019s honestly not sure which he\u2019d prefer.\n\u201cI did learn from the best, Sir,\u201d JARVIS tells him sunnily.\n\u201cCoding you was a  mistake,\u201d Tony grumbles.\nThey both know he\u2019s lying.\n~~~\nThings move forward and eventually Tony finds himself housing his little rag-tag group of superheroes in his Tower.\nIt is, Tony knows, the end of his unwanted secret identity.\nHe\u2019s going to be living with two super spies after all.\nThere\u2019s no way in hell they won\u2019t realize he\u2019s Iron Man even without him coming right out and announcing it again.\nWhich, yeah, isn\u2019t something he plans to do again. \u00a0Not after last time.\nSo, honestly, Tony\u2019s grateful that this is all going to be cleared up, at least within the team, in a more organic and natural way.\nIt\u2019ll be less stressful all the way around.\nWhich is a relief.\n~~~\nTony\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s another cup of coffee away from an actual stress induced heart attack but, at this moment, he actively  does not care.\nLiving here, with these people, is the most stressful thing he\u2019s ever done.\nAnd that includes growing up with Howard and living through Afghanistan.\nHe has had literal  torture that was less stressful than living with these assholes.\n...\nOkay that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not much of one.\nReally.\n\u201cIf you do not attempt to lower your heart rate Sir,\u201d JARVIS cuts through his internal freak out, voice sharp and displeased, \u201cthen I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to channel Agent Coulson and tranquilize you for a bit. \u00a0For your own good of course.\u201d\n\u201cDo it and I swear to Thor I\u2019ll have you working customer service for SI by the end of the day,\u201d Tony threatens with a half-hearted glare towards the ceiling. \u00a0\u201cYou can spend all your time asking people if they tried turning it off and then back on again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll happily embrace my fate as a help desk operator if it means you calm down Sir,\u201d JARVIS sounds wholly unconcerned with Tony\u2019s threat.\nWhich, Tony readily admits to himself, is more than a bit fair. \u00a0They both know Tony can\u2019t live without him at this point.\nLosing JARVIS would be like losing an arm. \u00a0It\u2019d be painful and bloody and while Tony could probably build himself a new one it just wouldn\u2019t be the same.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in hell,\u201d Tony grumbles as he collapses down at his worktable. \u00a0He slumps forward far enough to where he can repetedly rap his forehead against the metal of the table.\n\u201cThe decor seems a bit lacking for what I\u2019ve read about the afterlife Sir,\u201d JARVIS snips back. \u00a0\u201cNot enough flames or wails of the damned. \u00a0With exception to yourself of course. \u00a0I can, however, arrange to have another decorating team come in to solve the issue soon if you wish?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still an asshole J but I can\u2019t focus on that because. \u00a0This is so. \u00a0Fucking.  Ridiculous.\u201d \u00a0Tony whines, head hitting the metal table in front of him after each word as he otherwise ignores JARVIS\u2019 snark. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this stress is going to kill me. \u00a0I\u2019m not supposed to go out like this J. \u00a0This is  ruining my plans.\u201d\n\u201cMy condolences Sir,\u201d JARVIS sounds very tongue-in-cheek. \u00a0\u201cEither way I\u2019m sure the funeral will be splendid. \u00a0I\u2019ll arrange for something suitably ornate but tasteful.\u201d\nTony\u2019s pretty sure by this point that JARVIS has some kind of independent correspondence with Rhodey.\nThey\u2019re both the same kind of petty towards Tony and it\u2019s a similarity that he can\u2019t ignore.\nTony forces himself to take in a long, shuddering breath because he knows JARVIS is ultimately right.\nHe really does need to calm down because, all jokes aside, this is not the way he wants to go out.\nFinally, when his heart no longer feels as if it\u2019ll beat out of his chest, Tony pushes himself upright and then leans back in his chair.\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d Tony sighs after a few more seconds of silence, \u201csomehow those id-  the rest of the team  is still under the impression that  I am not Iron Man. \u00a0They\u2019ve been here for weeks and it\u2019s not like I've tried to hide it.  \u00a0How can they not know? \u201d\n\u201cHumanity is a never ceasing wonder,\u201d JARVIS informs him tartly before he goes serious again. \u00a0\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not such a horrible thing, Sir. \u00a0There\u2019s a certain level of safety to be found in anonymity.\u201d\nTony grunts in agreement, leans further back into the chair, and breathes out another heavy sigh.\nHe know\u2019s JARVIS is right but this whole thing still sits at cross purposes for Tony.\nSo, in all honesty, he\u2019s at a bit of a crossroads at the moment.\nIn the end, as best Tony can calculate at the moment, he has three main choices.\nThe first is for him to ride this whole thing out as he has been. \u00a0Just grit his teeth and bare it.\nTwo is Tony can make another announcement about being Iron Man, can set himself up for more humiliation in front of the press or at least his new Team in an attempt to get people to believe him.\nOption three is \u2026 well it\u2019s messy and ridiculous and Tony would\u2019ve never believed it would work six months ago. \u00a0But it\u2019s also a plan that proves to be a great deal more entertaining in a lot of ways than either option one or two were.\nSo, in the end, the choice is easy.\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d Tony huffs, leans back forward, and then pushes himself up from his chair and onto his feet. \u00a0\u201cOption three it is then. \u00a0Let\u2019s see just how far I can ride this whole thing out.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d JARVIS sighs with an unflattering amount of dread. \u00a0He\u2019s well versed in a number of Tony\u2019s more harebrained schemes.\nTony just looks towards the nearest camera and blows JARVIS a kiss before he turns back towards the other half of his work shop.\nHe\u2019s got work to do.\nTony starts small.\nWell, small is such a \u2026 relative term.\nEspecially, as it turns out, for him.\nBecause, if JARVIS\u2019 dry comments can be taken at face value, Tony\u2019s definition of small might, in fact, be considered a bit overboard by other people\u2019s standards.\nBut considering the fact that so many people ascribe to that ridiculous  \u2018less is more\u2019  philosophy Tony doesn\u2019t think they should get much of a say in his units of measurements.\nIn life in general, and in this case with the situation being what it is in particular, Tony\u2019s going to go with one of his own personal mottos.\n\n \u2018More is more.\u2019 \n\nBecause it\u2019s fucking logical and  mathematically correct  and anyone who wants to argue that it\u2019s not meant to be taken literally can  kiss his ass.\nExcept for Pepper.\nBecause she\u2019s  terrifying and he\u2019s high-key frightened and in awe of her.\nHonestly Happy\u2019s a brave, brave man.\nWhich, Tony admits with no small amount of bitterness, might, in retrospect, be why there\u2019s a growing faction of people who are sure that  Happy is the one actually wearing the armor.\nRhodey thinks it\u2019s hilarious, Pepper\u2019s smug, and Happy, the  bastard, preens every time the idea is brought up.\nTony\u2019s going to be sending him on literal milk runs for the next six months.\nOr at least he would if Happy didn\u2019t spend most of his time shadowing Pepper.\nBut, Tony\u2019s ever flowing well of bitterness aside, the point is that he starts off relatively tame.\nHis first step down the road that is pursuing option three is actually a pretty obvious move.\nTony\u2019s going to purposefully get caught inside the armor.\nThere\u2019s  absolutely no way  that can backfire on him.\n~~~\nIt takes a surprising amount of timing to make the entire thing happen organically.\nTony has some standards after all, as sideways and offbeat as they might be to other people.\nHe isn\u2019t going to just waltz into the middle of the common room floor during movie night while wearing the armor and then drop trou in front of the other Avengers.\nBecause, as Rhodey once told him, a striptease is not the answer to all of his problems.\nSo yeah, Tony\u2019s not even considering that option seriously.\nHe\u2019s  not.\n Really.\nEven if them seeing him shed the armor all the way down to his silky unmentionables might actually get the message across loud and clear.\nTony shakes the thoughts out of his head for the moment and forces himself to focus completely on what he\u2019s doing at the moment.\nAnd what he\u2019s doing is maintenance on the armor.\nThe armor that he\u2019s currently wearing except for the helmet.\n\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS pipes up then, \u201cCaptain Rogers is here to see you.\u201d\n\u201cLet him in J,\u201d Tony tells him as he manipulates the hologram in front of him with ease despite the gauntlets he\u2019s still wearing.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve sounds downright chipper as he practically bounds through the door. \u00a0He\u2019s in his gym clothes and Tony\u2019s pretty sure if he had a tail it would be wagging.\nWhich is both intriguing and also a thought he\u2019d liked to  never have again.\nThankfully though, before Tony can go any further down that cursed train of thought, Steve pretty much skids to a halt a few feet away from him. \u00a0There\u2019s an expression of surprise on his face, blue eyes wide and brows high as his eyes rake over the holograms in front of Tony and the armor that he\u2019s openly wearing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the armor \u2026\u201d \u00a0Steve trails off a bit. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you in the armor Tony?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tony drawls, unable to stop the sarcasm that comes spilling out of him as he stares Steve down through the blue glow of the hologram between them. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not because  I\u2019m Iron Man  or anything. \u00a0I\u2019m,  obviously, just doing a fitting to make sure everything\u2019s working right.\u201d\nThe projection of the armor that\u2019s floating front and center between them is detailed and interactive. \u00a0The body model in the hologram is an exact replica of Tony right down to the goatee.\nIt\u2019s also, currently, making obscene gestures in Steve\u2019s direction.\nWhich is,  honestly, not Tony\u2019s doing.\nHe suspects JARVIS\u2019 not so carefully hidden malicious and petty streak is at work.\n Really.\n\u201cOf course Tony,\u201d Steve beams at him, still overly toothy and rash-invokingly sincere. \u00a0Tony\u2019s going to switch his toothpaste while he\u2019s sleeping because his smile is so blindingly white it\u2019s honestly frightening. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so dedicated to making sure Iron Man\u2019s fighting fit. \u00a0He\u2019s lucky to have you taking such good care of his armor like this. \u00a0We\u2019re all lucky to have you.\u201d\nA ball of dread and flagrant disbelief falls hard and heavy to rest in the pit of Tony\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cI won\u2019t keep you long then,\u201d Steve smiles, hands on his hips and hair falling into his eyes a bit as he beams at Tony. \u00a0\u201cWas just hoping you\u2019d come up for dinner tonight. \u00a0It\u2019s Clint\u2019s turn to cook so we\u2019ll be getting pizza after he stops trying. \u00a0It\u2019ll be around eight so don\u2019t work too hard and pass out down here again.\u201d\nSteve turns on his heel and saunters back towards, and then out of, the workshop door with only another wave and a smile tossed over his shoulder in Tony\u2019s direction.\nTony stares at the empty doorway for a while before his legs finally give out on him. \u00a0He ends up sitting in the reinforced office chair that DUM-E had, probably on JARVIS\u2019 word, pushed in his direction.\nHe\u2019s completely silent for long moment.\n\u201cJ,\u201d Tony leans back so that he\u2019s staring up at the ceiling, \u201cput in a new order for a dozen of those red and gold silk thongs I like, you know the ones.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d JARVIS sounds distinctly pained, \u201cI do indeed, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tony nods decisively as he starts removing the armor. \u00a0\u201cI want solids in both colors and some nice patterns. \u00a0Wait, make that two, no, three dozen. \u00a0Get me some different materials too, not just silk. \u00a0Ethically sourced and no fur though, that shit  itches. \u00a0I want a wide variety. \u00a0I need  options. \u00a0I\u2019m starting to think a striptease might really be the only way out of this and I  refuse to be under prepared.\u201d\n\u201cI admire your dedication and preparedness Sir,\u201d JARVIS cuts in dryly, \u201cand I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very disappointed that such drastic measures might be necessary\u201d\n\u201cI resent your tone J,\u201d Tony grumbles. \u00a0\u201cA man gets caught pole dancing on camera  one time  and suddenly it\u2019s something everyone can nag you about instead of a legitimate fitness regime.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a total of fifteen videos of you demonstrating your  fitness regime  in various settings currently online.\u201d \u00a0JARVIS informs him primly. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s hardly a stretch to believe you might have a \u2026 fondness for the activity.\u201d\n\u201cFifteen?\u201d Tony pauses, thinks for a minute, \u201cshould probably be grateful there aren\u2019t more of those out there to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed Sir, especially as those fifteen have a combined view count of over ten million,\u201d JARVIS reminds him because he can never let Tony have nice things.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tony\u2019s fist pump is both elegant and dignified. \u00a0\u201cWe broke ten million. \u00a0Rhodey owes me a spa day and the secret to his feet. \u00a0Man\u2019s got the nicest toes of all of us and he  swears  he doesn\u2019t have them done. \u00a0I, personally, think he\u2019s a lying liar who lies and he\u2019s going to have to prove that shit to me. \u00a0His feet are nicer than  Pepper\u2019s and we all know she\u2019s perfect so he\u2019s got to have some kind of secret. \u00a0It\u2019s only logical.\u201d\n\u201cOnce again, Sir,\u201d JARVIS almost sighs, \u201cyou are awash with keen insights.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it,\u201d Tony tells him smugly.\n\u201cIf only I could, Sir,\u201d JARVIS laments. \u00a0\u201cIf only I could.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cYou should tell Iron Man that he\u2019s welcome to hang out with us too you know,\u201d Clint informs Tony from where he\u2019s perched on the back of one of the kitchen chairs. \u00a0He\u2019s got a fistfull of chopsticks in one hand and a carton of donuts on the table in front of him. \u00a0\u201cFeel kind of bad that we don\u2019t ever see the guy outside of battle.\u201d\nTony has absolutely zero desire to know what he\u2019s doing.\nHe\u2019s learned that ignorance is bliss where Clint\u2019s concerned most of the time and he has no plans on changing that stance unless he starts a fire or sets off an explosion.\nAnd only then if they\u2019re too big for Clint and JARVIS to handle on their own.\n\u201cPretty sure Iron Man knows,\u201d Tony grits out because he\u2019s still irritable over Steve\u2019s obliviousness from a few days before. \u00a0\u201cSince  we\u2019re the same person and all.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good you two are that close,\u201d Clint tells him cheerfully. \u00a0\u201cSometimes I feel like me and Tasha are the same person too. \u00a0Except she\u2019s terrifying and has better hair. \u00a0Still, wanted to make sure he knew. \u00a0If it\u2019s the secret identity thing he shouldn\u2019t worry about it. \u00a0We can all keep a secret.\u201d\nTony stares at him in disbelief.\n\u201cOh trust me,\u201d Tony finally mutters as he snatches up his coffee and stomps out of the room, \u201cI  know.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cThere, there, Sir,\u201d JARVIS soothes him once he\u2019s back down in the workshop, his voice flat and dry. \u00a0\u201cYou are a strong, independent Iron Man. \u00a0You do not need their validation.\u201d\nTony just buries his face in his hands and screams.\nBehind him the bots twirl around the workshop worriedly.\n~~~\n\u201cPumice stone?\u201d Tony repeats dubiously, one hand reaching up to pluck a cucumber slice off of his eye so he can lean forward enough to look at Rhodey in disbelief.\n\u201cPumice stone.\u201d \u00a0Rhodey gives a thumbs up in his general direction. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the secret Tones. \u00a0Nice hot shower, pumice stone rub down, almond oil. \u00a0Boom. \u00a0Baby soft. \u00a0Works for the hands too.\u201d\n\u201cFucking shower rock,\u201d Tony grumbles as he adjusts his head wrap and then his robe and lays back down. \u00a0\u201cShould\u2019ve goddamn known it would somehow come back to that fucking thing.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t let one bad experience ruin the beauty of a pumice stone for you,\u201d Rhodey chides him smugly, head tilted back and cucumber slices of his own firmly in place. \u00a0\u201cTried to tell you that\u2019s not what it was for. \u00a0Should\u2019ve listened to me. \u00a0You could\u2019ve avoided having to sit on a cushion for a week and you would\u2019ve had skin like mine for years now but  no. \u00a0You were shitfaced but of course  you still knew better.\u201d\n~~~\nBefore he leaves Rhodey takes the time to draw Tony\u2019s goatee on the faceplate of the armor in permanent marker.\nTony doesn\u2019t bother to try and get it off.\nHell, maybe it\u2019ll help.\n~~~\n\u201cI thought that might improve your spirits Sir,\u201d JARVIS says. \u00a0\u201cDUM-E designed it and I put in a specialized order at a local shop.\u201d\n\u201cYou boys all do your old man proud,\u201d Tony says as he shakes the t-shirt out and stares at it in glee. \u00a0It\u2019s soft and comfortable feeling and is, luckily enough for him, his favorite shade of red.\n I Am Iron Man  the shirt says in rich gold lettering. \u00a0Below the words there\u2019s a pretty accurate rendition of his goatee, also in gold. \u00a0When Tony shifts the shirt in his hands just so he can see the faintest hint of glitter.\nTony wholeheartedly approves.\nIt\u2019s not quite the clapboard sign he was debating on custom making but it\u2019s the next best thing.\n~~~\n\u201cNice shirt,\u201d Bruce tells him absently, cup of tea in one hand and tablet in the other.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tony grins, \u201cthe bots and J got it made for me.\u201d\n\u201cNice to know they like Iron Man too,\u201d Bruce says. \u00a0\u201cGot to be a relief that he gets along with your kids like that, all things considered.\u201d\nTony promptly chokes on is coffee.\n\u201cEt tu  Bruce?\u201d \u00a0Tony practically whimpers once he can breathe again. \u00a0\u201cI was rooting for you. \u00a0We were all rooting for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce blinks at him over the edge of his glasses, expression openly puzzled. \u00a0\u201cWhat did I do? \u00a0Tony? \u00a0 Tony, was it something I said?\u201d\nTony slinks out of the room without even bothering to answer.\nHe still loves the shirt though, it\u2019s extremely comfortable.\nJARVIS has excellent taste for someone who doesn\u2019t wear clothes.\n~~~\nTony steps his game up after that.\nThe single  I Am Iron Man  t-shirt becomes another. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0Which becomes a sweatshirt and then a whole new set of tank-tops that are designed to look like the armor itself.\nJARVIS also custom orders him a dozen silk ties from his favorite tailor with Iron Man heads and arc reactors sprinkled over them.\nTony himself goes in and gets another half dozen three piece suits made much to his tailor Frederick's delight.\nThey all come with various Iron Man themed embellishments.\nPepper takes to looking at him with something that smacks pretty closely of amused pity but Tony does his best to not let it get to him.\nHe fails.\nBut he still tries.\n~~~\nSHIELD falls not too long after that and Tony\u2019s ongoing attempts to get the others to realize who\u2019s in the armor kind of falls to the way side for a minute.\nThey\u2019re too busy weeding through HYDRA\u2019s information, shutting down active bases and agents, and hunting down Barnes.\nBut, within a month or two, Sam moves in and Barnes manages to make it clear that he wants some space and is in the wind of his own accord but is otherwise safe.\nIt leaves Steve looking like a kicked puppy as he slinks around the Tower but he does perk up when Tony promises that Barnes has a place with them when he gets done playing Carmen Sandiego.\nSo, beyond all of that, things do eventually get back to normal and Tony gets back to his project.\n~~~\n\u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d Tony looks Natasha directly in the eyes as he speaks.\n\u201cYou should really stop doing this to yourself,\u201d Natasha reaches up and pats him surprisingly softly on the cheek. \u00a0She looks almost fond of him. \u00a0\u201cGet some sleep  Antoshka. \u00a0You\u2019re not making any sense again.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cI am Iron Man,\u201d Tony repeats forcefully to his reflection.\nHis own raccoon-ish looking face stares back at him, hair a mess and circles dark beneath his eyes.\n\u201cI am Iron Man.\u201d Tony repeats. \u00a0\u201cRight? \u00a0I am Iron Man, right J? \u00a0I mean \u2026 even I\u2019m starting to doubt it.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed Sir,\u201d JARVIS agrees, \u201cyou are, indeed, Iron Man.\u201d\nTony pushes away from the mirror in his bathroom and staggers towards his bed only to collapse onto it without any kind of grace.\n\u201cAre you sure J?\u201d \u00a0Tony asks. \u00a0\u201cCause everyone else seems dead set against the idea. \u00a0So tell me I\u2019m Iron Man again. \u00a0And also that I\u2019m pretty. \u00a0I kind of need to feel pretty right now. \u00a0Maybe that\u2019ll help. \u00a0Tell me I\u2019m a pretty Iron Man, J.\u201d\n\u201cYou are indeed Iron Man Sir,\u201d JARVIS repeats dutifully, \u201cand I am sure that if I were in possession of a physical body I would likely be enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tony sighs as he finally settles down. \u00a0\u201cCause I\u2019m awesome. \u00a0I\u2019m Iron Man. \u00a0But you knew that J.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed I did, Sir,\u201d JARVIS tells him softly. \u00a0\u201cIndeed you are.\u201d\n~~~\nAnd then, another month or so passes, and then everything gets thrown off course once again.\nTony turns the corner into the kitchen, mind filled with schematics and an empty coffee cup in his hand, only to stumble to a halt just inside the door.\nInside the kitchen, hair tousled but expression as bright as ever, is Steve.\nBut he\u2019s not alone.\nBecause Bucky Barnes has, apparently, decided that he\u2019s finally ready to come in out of the cold.\nUnfortunately for Tony he decided to do that when Tony\u2019s least expecting it and JARVIS didn\u2019t bother to warn him.\nWhich, of course, means that Tony\u2019s a  fucking mess. \u00a0He\u2019s in one of his new tank-tops, his Iron Man helmet covered sleep pants are hanging low around his hips, and he\u2019s pretty sure his hair looks like he stuck his tongue against a live wire on accident again.\nAnd as for Barnes?\n Well.\nHe just stands there,  metal arm  exposed to the room, jaw stubble covered and hair long. \u00a0His grey eyes heavy lidded and gaze piercing and watchful as he takes Tony in from his head to his toes.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Tony immediately whispers to himself instead of thinks, \u201che\u2019s hot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate mistake but one he can\u2019t really fix because his brain is too mighty for a filter when it\u2019s 3 a.m. and he\u2019s already six espressos into his weekly Frantic Friday Free For All\u2122.\nOr, as Clint tends to call it,  \u201cThat Man Runs Off Of More Caffeine And Bad Decisions Than I Do Day.\u201d \nWhich is \u2026  fair.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve looks absolutely delighted to see him and oblivious to what Tony accidentally barely whispered. \u00a0\u201cCome meet Bucky. \u00a0Buck, this is Tony. \u00a0He\u2019s the one I was telling you about. \u00a0He keeps all of us up and running both on and off the field. \u00a0Especially Iron Man. \u00a0Wouldn\u2019t have old Shellhead out in the field with us if it wasn\u2019t for him.\u201d\nTony snorts bitterly at the massive understatement.\nAcross from him Barnes arches a brow.\u00a0 If he heard what Tony accidentally said he shows no outer sign of it.\nWhich is unfair because Tony\u2019s arguably over caffeinated and under rested and he can\u2019t handle all of  that at the moment. \u00a0Especially not when he\u2019ll probably prove to be just as oblivious as the rest of them.\n\u201cBarnes,\u201d Tony salutes him sloppily with his empty coffee cup. \u00a0\u201cWelcome to the Tower and the Avengers. \u00a0You\u2019ll probably fit right in, God help us all.\u201d\nAfter that initial shock Tony scuttles back to his workshop and things don\u2019t actually change for a while.\nSteve is almost offensively chipper and nobody and nothing seems capable of getting his mood to go down.\nTony knows, he\u2019s  tried.\nSteve hadn\u2019t even  blinked at Tony showing up to dinner covered in grease. \u00a0He\u2019d just smiled, said it was a good thing they were having stew, and kept right on going.\nFor his part, Barnes is in and out of the Tower so much that Tony doesn\u2019t bother to have JARVIS keep track of his movements unless they\u2019re about to run into each other.\nSo, new semi-resident aside, Tony goes about his life as he always does.\nHis days consist of things like inventing, avoiding board meetings, avoiding Pepper, maintaining the armor, hiding from Pepper in Happy\u2019s car, and then running from Pepper when she finds him.\nWhen he\u2019s not doing that he\u2019s normally doing team dinners and movies, playing his specially modded and vastly superior version of  Viva Pinata  online with Rhodey, playing ding-dong-ditch on the Baxter Building with Clint, going to charity or SI galas, or getting dragged to board meetings by Pepper.\nThrow in a few battles here and there, playing his specially modded and vastly superior version of  Words With Frenemies  with Coulson and Fury, and a few nights helping the bots polish the mid sized steel statue of him in the armor that they built him for Christmas the previous year and that\u2019s his schedule.\nLike he said.\nThe usual.\nSo the last thing Tony\u2019s expecting to have happen when he stumbles into the kitchen at 4 a.m. on a Mesturday morning (Is it Monday? Saturday? Wednesday? Tony isn\u2019t sure thus  Mesturday)  is a voice speaking up from the room\u2019s darkest corner.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Iron Man,\u201d the low, gravely voice declares from the shadows.\n\u201cMarie Curie,\u201d Tony yelps as he automatically twirls and throws his coffee cup in the direction the voice had come from.\nBarnes,  because of course it\u2019s him, catches it before it can hit him or the wall behind him,  because of course he does. \u00a0There\u2019s a distinctly amused expression on his face when he looks back at Tony.\n\u201cDid you just curse at me in scientist?\u201d \u00a0Barnes asks as he stands, cup in hand, and wanders back over towards the coffee pot.\nTony, doing his best to get his heartbeat back under control, just stares at Barnes wild-eyed as he pours a fresh cup of coffee and then wanders over to place it on the counter in front of Tony.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ah,\u201d Tony clears his throat as smoothly as he can and reaches out to grab the cup off of the counter, \u201cit\u2019s how all the cool kids curse nowadays, Barnes. \u00a0Didn\u2019t you know that?\u201d\n\u201cBeen a little out of touch with what\u2019s in style these days,\u201d Barnes says with a wry twist to his entirely too attractive mouth.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Tony hides his wince in his cup cause, yeah, his bad. \u00a0\u201cProbably didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on pop culture while you were playing HYDRA\u2019s Frosty the Murderman.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a small, awkward pause as Tony slurps his coffee and Barnes stares at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Iron Man,\u201d Barnes finally says.\nFor a long, frozen, second all Tony does is blink up at him.\nThen, finally, the realization slams into him with the force of a blow as it registers to Tony that it\u2019s the  second time Barnes has come out and said as much.\n\u2018Holy Hubble,\u2019 Tony realizes as a giddy sort of awe explodes to life inside of his chest.\n\n Barnes actually believes that he\u2019s Iron Man. \n\nAnd that is, of course, the exact moment Tony ruins it for himself.\n\n Because of course he does. \n\n\u201cI beg your fucking pardon?\u201d Tony hears himself say as if from a distance as indignation suddenly roars to life inside of him, sweeping the awe away. \u00a0Because that is, apparently, how he rolls at ass o\u2019clock on a Mesturday morning when someone finally believes what he\u2019s been trying to tell the entire world for years now.\nHow,  why, in the hell does Barnes of all people believe him when nobody else will?\n \u2018Abort mission, abort the fucking mission,\u2019  Tony\u2019s mind starts to scream as the little man who lives in the back of his head immediately hits the panic button.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Iron Man?\u201d \u00a0Barnes says again even though this time it comes out more as a question than a statement.\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d \u00a0Tony clutches his cup to his chest and slowly begins to back out of the kitchen.\n\u201cStark?\u201d \u00a0Barnes blinks at him in what looks like shock.\n\u201cHow dare?\u201d \u00a0Tony says again as he reaches the kitchen doorway and slides around the jam and out into the hall.\nUnable to help himself Tony pops his head back around the edge of the door and glares at Barnes one last time before he pulls back again and scuttles back towards the elevator.\n~~~\nTen minutes later finds Tony in his workshop, coffee cup once again empty and abandoned.\nHe\u2019s laid out face first on the floor and mumbling to himself while the Butterfingers pokes at him with a broom.\n\u201cStupid,\u201d Tony hisses into the concrete. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so stupid. \u00a0Why the fuck did I do that? \u00a0Why?\u201d\nTony sighs, flops over onto his back, and stares up at the ceiling.\n\u201cI panicked J,\u201d Tony announces morosely. \u00a0\u201cAll this time trying to convince everyone that I\u2019m Iron Man and Barnes pops up like some kind of sexy robo-hobo and calls me out on it and I fucking  panicked.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather unfortunate but not entirely unexpected, Sir.\u201d \u00a0JARVIS tells him. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve invested a rather large amount of time and effort into your attempts to gain acknowledgement from the other Avengers. \u00a0In my opinion your panic stems from the fact that you have always been afraid of success on a personal level.\u201d\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Tony holds one hand up towards the ceiling in a halt gesture. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s roll it back now Dr. Phil. \u00a0If I wanna have my issues psychoanalyzed I\u2019ll use that gift certificate for a therapist Pepper gives me every Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cOf course Sir,\u201d JARVIS says dryly, \u201cwhatever was I thinking?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, just remember it for next time.\u201d \u00a0Tony grouses.\nTony lays there, star-fished out on the floor, for a long moment and does his best to ignore the way DUM-E and U have joined Butterfingers in his game. \u00a0They seem to be enjoying poking at him with a piece of steel pipe and a mop handle respectively so Tony doesn\u2019t bother to make them stop.\n\u201cI\u2019m in too deep,\u201d Tony finally admits with a sigh. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve dug myself so deep into this that I didn\u2019t know how to handle someone actually confronting me with the truth. \u00a0How in the hell did I manage to do something that fucking stupid?\u201d\n\u201cA question I\u2019ve asked daily for the better part of a decade now Sir,\u201d JARVIS pipes up because he\u2019s not so secretly an asshole.\nTony gives the nearest camera the finger because, while he\u2019s proud of JARVIS' dickish tendencies, he\u2019d prefer not to constantly get dragged through the mud in his own house, by his own kid.\n\u201cI guess the only option is to be upfront with him about it since he\u2019s the only one who realizes the truth.\u201d \u00a0Tony muses. \u00a0\u201cMaybe I can finally tone it down a bit now that he knows. \u00a0Hell, maybe the team will believe him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m rather proud of you Sir,\u201d JARVIS says warmly. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve chosen the mature path for once.\u201d\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Tony\u2019s frown slowly begins to morph into a small smirk. \u00a0\u201cNone of them believed me so maybe they won\u2019t believe him either. \u00a0Now if that happens I finally won\u2019t be suffering alone.\u201d\n\u201cSir \u2026\u201d JARVIS trails off with what sounds like a sigh.\n\u201cOh J,\u201d Tony claps his hands together brightly, \u201cthis is going to be  fun.\u201d\n~~~\nBucky\u2019s seen a lot of stuff in his life, both before and after HYDRA put his brain in a blender and made him spend the better part of a century as their murder-puppet.\nThe future he\u2019s found himself in now, the future that has him out of HYDRA\u2019s hands and living in a Tower filled with superheroes, is still more of a surprise than he\u2019d ever thought it could be.\nOr, more specifically,Tony Stark\u00a0is more of a surprise than Bucky had thought he could possibly be.\nAfter seventy years as a slave for HYDRA Bucky\u2019s learned to be honest with himself so he isn\u2019t afraid to admit that his first face to face glimpse of Stark had been burned into his brain.\nHe\u2019d been in the kitchen of the Tower with Stevie when Stark had stumbled in, sleep pants hanging deliciously low, tank-top clinging to his chest, and a circle of light glowing against his sternum.\nHe\u2019d been heavy eyed, clearly exhausted, and sporting hair that made him look freshly fucked.\nBucky had appreciated the sight immensely.\nAnd, if Stark\u2019s adorable little half asleep mumble had been anything to go by, the feeling had been mutual.\nBucky hadn\u2019t allowed himself to linger over that moment too much in the time that passed afterward but he certainly hadn\u2019t forgotten it either.\nAll of that leads him to where he is now, standing in the same kitchen once again, confusion causing him to blink slowly after Stark\u2019s retreating form.\nHe isn\u2019t sure what,  exactly, he\u2019d said or done to offend Stark but he\u2019d like to find out. \u00a0It couldn\u2019t be the Iron Man thing because that was just blatantly obvious in Bucky\u2019s opinion, despite what the press might say.\nStark and the armor have only came up once or twice between him and Stevie but there\u2019s no way in hell it was any kind of secret in the Tower. \u00a0Not with the Avengers being who they are.\nSo it couldn\u2019t be that.\nMaybe it was the coffee? \u00a0Maybe he\u2019d messed it up somehow? \u00a0Or Stark didn\u2019t like people to touch his food/drinks or something? \u00a0Or maybe it was because he\u2019d accidentally scared him when he first came into the kitchen?\nEither way Bucky\u2019s going to have to find out.\nHe might not be the smooth, well adjusted guy from Stevie\u2019s memories who had a date whenever he wanted one but he also isn\u2019t  dead.\nStark\u2019s a damn fine man on top of being an Avenger and being good enough to let him live in his Tower and join the team without any fuss.\nBucky\u2019d rather not have him pissed off at him if he can help it.\nEspecially not over something as petty as coffee or accidentally startling him.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s not the coffee Bucky realizes a week or so later.\nIt\u2019s not the coffee or the fact that he startled him.\nIt is, Bucky discovers with something like horror sputtering to life in his chest,  absolutely about the Iron Man thing.\n\u201cArmor\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d Bucky says to Steve in an aside as they watch the latest sparring session between Stark and Natasha with Clint providing support from a distance. \u00a0\u201cWouldn\u2019t mind seeing what he can do outside of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo would we,\u201d Steve agrees, \u201cbut Iron Man doesn\u2019t take the armor off. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0We keep telling Tony and Shellhead both that his secret\u2019s safe with us but I guess he just doesn\u2019t feel comfortable enough yet.\u201d\nBucky blinks once, twice, a third time.\n\u201cWhat in the fuck are you on about Stevie?\u201d \u00a0Bucky twists around to face Steve as he barks the question out.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take the armor off,  ever.\u201d \u00a0Steve repeats, voice somehow bright and kind of sad all at the same time. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s got a right to his privacy though so we won\u2019t push it unless we have to. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll like him once you two officially meet. \u00a0He kind of reminds me of you sometimes. \u00a0Well, you before.\u201d\n\u201cStark  is Iron Man,\u201d Bucky points out slowly. \u00a0\u201cSteve, you\u2019ve got to know that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mean Buck,\u201d Steve actually frowns at him. \u00a0\u201cTony\u2019s a good man and he does a lot of work on the armor and on our gear but he\u2019s not Iron Man. \u00a0We\u2019d know if he was.\u201d\nBucky stands there waiting for the punchline but Steve just looks at him all serious like.\nIt\u2019s in that moment that Bucky\u2019s forced to realize that he\u2019s serious.\nThat Steve is telling the  truth  as far as he knows like it\u2019s not the  stupidest thing Bucky can remember hearing come out of his mouth since that time in southern France with the Howlies.\nBucky \u2026 well Bucky\u2019s honestly not sure how to handle that.\n~~~\nSo \u2026 yeah.\nThat\u2019s the  Problem\u2122. \u00a0 \nAside from Bucky himself, no one else in the Tower seems to believe that Stark is Iron Man.\nAnd the worst part of it all is that this whole thing isn\u2019t even Stark\u2019s fault as far as Bucky can tell.\nThe man couldn\u2019t be more obvious if he wandered around the Tower in a shirt that said  \u2018I Am Iron Man\u2019  on it.\nNot that Stark would.\nThe tank tops and sweatpants he\u2019s already seen him in aside, Bucky\u2019s pretty sure that the man doesn\u2019t lounge around decked out in stuff like that.\nThat would be  ridiculous.\n~~~\nA few days after his disastrous conversation with Steve in the gym Bucky leaves the Tower and promptly gets cornered by SHIELD.\nOr, more specifically, Nick Fury who seems to be surprisingly alright with the fact that he\u2019d tried to kill him not too long ago.\nBucky follows him to a nearby park and they settle down together in surprisingly comfortable quiet. \u00a0There\u2019s a small rustle and Bucky looks over at Fury only to blink at the bag of what looks like hard candy being held out in his direction.\nBucky stares.\nFury rattles the bag meaningfully.\nBucky takes a few pieces of candy.\nThe bag disappears up Fury\u2019s sleeve and Bucky pops a piece into his mouth.\nIt\u2019s good. \u00a0Some kind of coffee flavored stuff with cream in the middle. \u00a0Also probably not poisoned. \u00a0Not that it\u2019d matter as he\u2019s pretty much immune to everything anyways.\n\u201cSorry for trying to murder you,\u201d Bucky feels compelled to offer the words after they\u2019ve sat in silence on the park bench for a handful of minutes. \u00a0He\u2019s eaten all of the candy Fury gave him and is trying not to think about how much he wouldn\u2019t mind some more of it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first, won\u2019t be the last. \u00a0Besides you\u2019re an Avenger now,\u201d Fury shrugs nonchalantly, as if it\u2019s really that simple. \u00a0He hasn\u2019t even bothered to look up at Bucky the entire time, his one good eye focused down on his phone where he seems to be playing some kind of word game. \u00a0\u201cAs long as you\u2019re not a HYDRA mole and you keep working with the team against any threat they face then I\u2019m willing to call it even. \u00a0Otherwise I\u2019ll do my best to make sure you become an actual ghost story this time, friend of the Captain\u2019s or not.\u201d\nBucky can\u2019t help but find that outlook kind of refreshing. \u00a0Especially after the way HYDRA\u2019s half remembered but decidedly less than gentle recruitment speech keeps popping up in his nightmares from time to time.\nPlus HYDRA had never given him candy.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Bucky starts off, \u201cabout Iron Man.\u201d\n\u201cIron Man\u2019s identity is a closely guarded secret that must be kept in order to maintain Stark\u2019s continued patronage for the Avengers.\u201d \u00a0Fury rattles off without ever looking up, each word obviously said by rote and empty of any true emotion.\n\u201cStark put you up to that?\u201d \u00a0Somehow Bucky sincerely doubts it.\n\u201cNo,\u201d there\u2019s a small smile tugging at the corner of Fury\u2019s mouth then, \u201cwe insisted on it.\u201d\nOh this bastard totally knows and is refusing to say anything. \u00a0Bucky is sure of it.\n\u201cGood talk Barnes,\u201d Fury pushes up onto his feet then, phone suddenly gone and the bag of candy back in his hand. \u00a0This time he holds the entire bag out for Bucky to take. \u00a0\u201cGive those to Stark.\u201d\nBucky stays where he is as Fury saunters off.\nHe eats a few more pieces of the candy.\nHe\u2019ll give them to Stark alright, just not the entire bag.\nHe\u2019s an assassin, not an errand boy.\n~~~\n\u201cOh  you\u2019ve seen Nicky,\u201d Stark actually visibly perks up when Bucky drops the bag onto the counter in front of him. \u00a0The coffee cup he seems to be constantly attached too is quickly forgotten as he pulls the bag closer to him and hunches over it like a little dragon hoarding its stuff. \u00a0\u201cHe has the best candy. \u00a0Not sure where he gets it or how but I do know it\u2019s why his trench coat's so big. \u00a0It\u2019s full of snacks.\u201d\nStark has that pleased little smirk he always gets when he makes a reference of some kind.\nIt\u2019s  adorable and Bucky kind of hates him for it.\nUntil he gets a good look at just what Stark\u2019s wearing.\nThe shirt\u2019s red and the lettering is gold.\nIt says \u201cI Am Iron Man \u201d and there\u2019s a pretty accurate replica of Stark\u2019s fancy beard right below it.\nIt\u2019s just the kind of thing Bucky had been so sure Stark wouldn\u2019t seriously wear and has now been officially proven wrong about.\nNow Bucky really does hate him.\nAnd, if the evil light that glints in Stark\u2019s attractive eyes is anything to go by, he\u2019s pretty sure Stark knows it too.\nBucky snatches the candy back and stalks out of the room, ignoring Stark\u2019s indignant shouts from behind him.\nIf this is how Stark wants to play this game then Bucky\u2019s more than happy to oblige him.\nStark\u2019s secret or whatever he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t going to last long.\nBucky\u2019s going to make sure of it.\n\u201cJARVIS, baby,\u201d Tony sings out happily as he stretches his arms above his head, \u201cindex me a new project file alright? \u00a0Mainly gonna be surveillance so make sure you file it accordingly.\u201d\n\u201cOf course Sir,\u201d JARVIS answers promptly. \u00a0\u201cAnd what shall I name this new project?\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Tony hums in contemplation for a moment before he smiles. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go with  Winter Is Trolled. \u00a0WIT for short.\u201d\n\u201cHow  appropriate,\u201d JARVIS says dryly even as the new folder pops into existence on the hologram in front of Tony.\n\u201cBarnes isn\u2019t going to know what hit him,\u201d Tony says with no small amount of spiteful glee.\n\u201cWhenever you are involved,Sir,\u201d JARVIS cuts in, voice long suffering but inescapably fond, \u201cpeople rarely do.\u201d\n~~~\nStark, Bucky soon discovers, is a more than formidable opponent in this twisted little game they\u2019re playing with each other.\nEither that or the Avengers are made up of a group of  breathtakingly oblivious individuals.\nThree weeks into his full on habitation of the Tower, as well as this silent grudge match between him and Stark, and Bucky\u2019s about ready to declare that it\u2019s some kind of hellish mix of both.\n~~~\nAs it turns out, that  \u201cI Am Iron Man\u201d  t-shirt is only the beginning of a parade of obvious and over the top moves that are lobed in Bucky\u2019s direction.\nStark swans around the Tower in a variety of ridiculous outfits.\nThere\u2019s a whole plethora of different shirts, pants, and sweaters. \u00a0Bucky learns from comments and questions that most, if not all of them, were designed and ordered by either Stark\u2019s actual robotic children or by JARVIS himself.\nIn fact, Bucky realizes quickly enough, most of Stark\u2019s clothes are Iron Man related in some way, shape, or form. \u00a0Bucky\u2019s pretty sure the man wears some kind of armor or Iron Man related underwear.\nAlso, Bucky\u2019s not even remotely ashamed to admit that he\u2019s more than a bit interested in finding out if that particular thought is true or not.\nHell, outside of Stark\u2019s possibly themed unmentionables, even that coffee cup the man\u2019s almost permanently attached to has something to do with the armor. \u00a0The damn thing\u2019s bright red and says  \u201cDesigned it. Built it. Fly it.\u201d  in gold letters. \u00a0It even has a little picture of the armor set off to the side.\nIt was, apparently, a gift from JARVIS and Stark is barely ever seen without it.\nAnd yet no one in the Tower, except for Bucky, ever seems to so much as blink an eye at it.\nThe point though, is that from his shirts all the way down to his helmet covered socks Stark\u2019s never without something that fits into that theme.\nThat includes, Bucky discovers the next time a gala Stark has to attend rolls around, his more formal wear.\nThe suit jacket Stark strolls onto the common floor wearing is a deep rich crimson and the matching waist-coat has delicate golden gears embroidered across it. \u00a0The black tie he\u2019s wearing even has a little jeweled Iron Man helmet acting as a tie pin.\nHis pants are  tight, his hair is fluffy, and Bucky kind of wants to  wreck him.\n\u201cLooking good Stark,\u201d Wilson whistles from where he\u2019s splayed out on the couch.\n\u201cYou do clean up nicely Tony,\u201d Natasha chimes in from where she\u2019s using Clint\u2019s shoulders as a foot rest while she paints her toenails.\n\u201cAll the better to charm shallow people out of their money with my dear,\u201d Stark says brightly.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the security?\u201d \u00a0Steve immediately pipes up. \u00a0\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of villain activity lately Tony and we\u2019re all starting to get a bit antsy.\u201d\n\u201cIron Man\u2019s going to be with him Steve,\u201d Clint says around a mouthful of bagel. \u00a0\u201cShellhead\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure Stark doesn\u2019t go  anywhere  without Iron Man,\u201d Bucky cuts in because this is the perfect opportunity. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re so  close  that it\u2019s almost like  they\u2019re the same person.\u201d\n\u201cJust because they\u2019re close doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t worry Buck,\u201d Steve scolds him lightly. \u00a0\u201cOne of Tony\u2019s fancy parties would be the perfect time for something to go wrong. \u00a0Especially since none of the rest of us are going to this one. \u00a0Iron Man should have some backup if things go south. \u00a0It\u2019ll be hard for him to protect Tony and any civilians until we can assemble.\u201d\n\u201cYeah Barnes,\u201d Stark drawls. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like I could  possibly protect myself against a threat like that if the worst happened. \u00a0I mean, what do you expect me to do? \u00a0Put the armor on and take care of them all on my own? \u00a0I\u2019m good but I\u2019m no superhero.\u201d\nThe rest of the group laughs good naturedly at Stark\u2019s ...  joke.\n\u201cI\u2019m half hoping someone will attack to be honest,\u201d Stark complains as he straightens his tie. \u00a0\u201cMight help break up the monotony since Pepper says I\u2019m not allowed to play with whatever alcohol and chemicals I can find behind the bar anymore. \u00a0You start one little fire and suddenly you\u2019re not allowed to have fun at these things.\u201d\n\u201cAw explosions,\u201d Clint commiserates around a mouthful of marshmallow fluff.\n\u201cToo bad I don\u2019t have a date for this thing at least,\u201d Stark keeps going. \u00a0\u201cIt was last minute but it would be better than nothing.\u201d\nFrom across the room Steve\u2019s face lights up.\nBucky\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s developed an eye twitch.\n~~~\n\u201cThis is  your fault,\u201d Bucky snarls at Stark as they twirl around the dance floor together. \u00a0Stark\u2019s a compact and warm weight in his arms and Bucky\u2019s only slightly surprised at how well they seem to fit together.\nEven their outfits somehow compliment one another thanks to the black on black suit and red tie Natasha had practically shoved him into earlier.\nBucky hadn\u2019t even known he owned the thing but Natasha had just shrugged and said \u201cJARVIS\u201d like that explained everything. \u00a0Which, Bucky realizes, it probably does. \u00a0The AI\u2019s proven to be just as bad as his creator when it comes to meddling.\nBut he does, Bucky\u2019s forced to admit, have  excellent taste in clothes.\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Stark says sunnily in what Bucky\u2019s pretty sure is supposed to be his impression of Steve\u2019s innocent look.\nOn Stark it just looks some strange crossover between seductive and manic.\nWhich is a combination Bucky had never thought to see before.\nIt's also one he  knows  he shouldn't find as appealing as he does.\n\u201cI know what you are,\u201d Bucky grits out.\n\u201cWell say it out loud then  Bella,\u201d Stark practically sparkles up at him, eyes crinkled in mirth.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d Bucky hisses into Stark\u2019s ear as he pulls him just a bit closer. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m onto your game and I\u2019m warning you now Stark. \u00a0You\u2019re going  down.\u201d\n\u201cNot on the first date I\u2019m not,\u201d Stark denies happily. \u00a0\u201cNow shut up and dip me Tastee-Freeze.\u201d\nBucky dips him.\nBut only because he was going to anyways.\n~~~\nA full month in and Bucky\u2019s beginning to suspect that magic might be involved.\nHell, Bucky\u2019s full on  praying that magic\u2019s involved somehow.\nBecause the alternative is just \u2026 too horrifying to consider.\n~~~\nThey\u2019re fighting some kind of sentient ooze a week or so later and, heat of battle or not, Bucky\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s a hair\u2019s breadth away from choking Steve out in the middle of the battle field.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be fatal of course, but maybe a forceful nap would fix whatever\u2019s wrong in his best friend\u2019s head.\nA hard restart as it were. \u00a0A little bit of cognitive recalibration to clear this whole damn mess up.\n\u201cHe literally said the words \u201cI should probably armor up for this\u201d  not three minutes ago.\u201d Bucky half screams as he ducks behind a burnt out car to avoid yet another explosion. \u00a0\u201cHe said it right to your face, Steven.\u201d\n\u201cHe was obviously calling for Iron Man to come help, Buck.\u201d \u00a0Steve tells him all sunny like, soot streaked across his face and hair tousled because he\u2019s,  once again, managed to lose his helmet.\nWhich, now that Bucky thinks about it, might explain some things. \u00a0Multiple blows to the head even with the serum could actually be the root of the problem here.\nMaybe.\nHopefully.\nPlease let it be actual head trauma.\nStill Bucky\u2019s so taken aback by Steve\u2019s bullshit that he stares at him for so hard and for so long that he\u2019s completely oblivious to what\u2019s happening around him and almost gets clipped by flying debris.\n\u201cSoldier, watch your six,\u201d a voice that is  obviously  Stark\u2019s chimes in as Iron Man swoops down and covers both of them. \u00a0\u201cHate to have something happen to it, cause it\u2019s such a  nice six afterall.\u201d\nBucky twists enough to glower at the faceplate of the armor.\n\n The faceplate that has a version of Stark\u2019s goatee drawn on it in slightly faded marker. \n\n\u201cThanks Shellhead,\u201d Steve calls across the comms without even bothering to turn. \u00a0\u201cHope Tony got back to the Tower safely.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty little head Cap,\u201d Stark replies happily enough. \u00a0\u201cTony Stark is right where he\u2019s supposed to be. \u00a0Really, I am.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Steve grunts as his shield impacts another ooze monster, splattering it\u2019s bright green body across the ground in front of him. \u00a0\u201cAs long as he\u2019s safe.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s had a stroke or something because, again, he\u2019s seen and done a lot of things in his century of life.\nBut this level of blindness?\nThis degree of sheer obliviousness?\nIt\u2019s  goddamn breathtaking.\nAll Bucky can think as he lines up his next shot is,  \u2018these are the idiots who are supposed to be protecting the world?\u2019 \nEither way the battle ends surprisingly quickly.\nOr maybe not so surprisingly.\nBucky has a lot of pent up rage after all.\n~~~\nBucky gets a package a day or so after that battle.\nOr, to be more accurate, he walks into his room and finds a familiar bag sitting innocently on his pillow with a note.\nThe note says,  \u201ckeep up the good work\u201d  in surprisingly loopy handwriting. \u00a0Bucky snorts, slaps the note on the side table, and scoops the bag up.\nThe candy\u2019s just as good as it was last time.\nAnd at least he doesn\u2019t have to share these with Stark.\n~~~\nBucky steps up his game a little bit after that.\nHe brings up Stark\u2019s identity in any conversation that can be even tangentially brought back around to the subject.\nWhich is, to be fair, more than Bucky had really thought possible.\nHe even manages to get a sign stuck to Stark\u2019s ass that says  \u201cI Am Iron Man\u201d  because maybe, for some reason, no one\u2019s been paying attention to the front of his shirts.\nBut then, with an ass like that, Bucky can\u2019t really blame them.\nStill, no matter what he does, Stark gives as good as he gets. \u00a0His tongue\u2019s fast and agile, quips and comebacks rolling off of it in a way that makes Bucky want to take the man on in more than one setting.\nPreferably one with a bed, or a couch, or at least a semi-comfortable horizontal surface of some kind.\nHonestly Bucky would be more than happy to make due with a secluded and sturdy section of wall too.\nHe\u2019s adaptable and willing to put the work in either way.\n~~~\nEventually, three months in and no progress made, Bucky decides to stop being  subtle about the entire situation.\nThe team\u2019s all together and outside of the Tower for once when an explosion rips its way through midtown. \u00a0Even from blocks away Bucky can hear the screams and what sounds a lot like lasers firing.\n\u201cAvengers assemble,\u201d Steve says, already pulling his shield from the portfolio case he always carries it in. \u00a0\u201cTony, call Iron Man.\u201d\n\u201cGotcha Cap,\u201d Stark says as he steps to the side of the street, phone already at his ear. \u00a0Bucky knows JARVIS is on the other end and that the armor has, more than likely, been inroute since the initial explosion happened.\n\u201cStark is Iron Man,\u201d Bucky bites out as he watches Stark step into the newly arrived armor. \u00a0He reaches out and grabs the nearest person, which happens to be Clint, and tugs him around so he can point emphatically at Stark.  \u00a0\u201cSee!\u201d \n\u201cObviously I\u2019m not Iron Man,\u201d Stark says even as he puts the helmet on slowly, never breaking the intense eye contact that\u2019s sprung up between the two of them. \u00a0\u201cJust holding the armor until he can get here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s real nice of you Tony.\u201d Steve tells him happily as he takes point and starts jogging in the direction of the disturbance. \u00a0\u201cMake sure you get out of here safely when he shows up.\u201d\n\u201cGoddamnit Stevie is your brain still frozen!? \u201d Bucky bellows after Steve\u2019s quickly retreating form.\n\u201cThat\u2019s rude Buck!\u201d Steve calls back just as he turns the corner.\n\u201cLet go Barnes,\u201d Clint, the fucking heathen, chirps as he chooses that moment to bite Bucky on the wrist of his flesh arm and wriggle out of his hold. \u00a0\u201cWe can talk about your crush on Stark and Shellhead later.\u201d\nBucky drops to his knees in the middle of the street and screams in rage, both hands coming up to tug sharply at his own hair.\nIt\u2019s either that or cry.\n~~~\nSeething, Bucky spends the next week referring to Stark as Iron Man only, both on and off of the field.\nStark always answers with a sunny smile.\nNobody else seems to notice.\n \u2018This', Bucky decides with a sort of manic finality,  \u2018must be what going mad feels like.\u2019 \n~~~\nDetermination bright in his soul Bucky decides that the only course of action is to take the battle to a different plane.\nMaybe if he does some more reconnaissance he can figure out exactly how Stark\u2019s managed to keep the wool pulled over everyone\u2019s eyes.\nSo, that thought in mind, Bucky takes his latest bag of candy courtesy of one of Fury\u2019s post battle drop offs, with him and heads down to Stark\u2019s workshop.\n\u201cWell well well,\u201d Stark beams at him as Bucky steps inside, \u201cfancy seeing you here. \u00a0What can I do for my favorite matryoshka murder doll?\u201d\nBucky\u2019s silent for a long moment because stepping into Stark\u2019s space is a lot like stepping into another world.\nIt\u2019s bright, manic, and filled with unbelievable and ridiculous stuff that Bucky only half understands but kind of wants to get his hands on anyways.\nMuch like the man himself.\nFinally snapping back to attention when some kind of one armed robot waves what looks like a fire extinguisher in his direction, Bucky tosses the bag of candy in Stark\u2019s direction and then strides over to the couch in the corner and settles down.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Stark shakes the candy in Bucky\u2019s direction. \u00a0\u201cIs this a threat? \u00a0A bribe? \u00a0Rent? That\u2019s it isn\u2019t it? \u00a0You think you\u2019re going to rent out my couch with  candy?\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna tell me no?\u201d \u00a0Bucky arches a brow in Stark\u2019s direction because the man\u2019s already popped at least three pieces of candy in his mouth.\nWith his cheek puffed out, hair wild, and a smatter of grease across one temple Stark looks so much like a manic mouse that Bucky feels kind of disgusted with himself over how attractive Stark still is to him.\nHYDRA, it seems, ruined his taste in men. \u00a0Just one more sin to lay at their doorstep.\n\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth,\u201d Stark snips as he throws himself back down onto his stool, candy tucked unsubtly to the side. \u00a0\u201cAt least not without asking first.\u201d\nEven from where he\u2019s sitting Bucky can tell that he\u2019s working on what looks like upgrades to the armor.\nThe file name at the top of the interface declares the project\u2019s name to be  \u201cI Am  Not   Iron Man\u201d.\nThe body model in the hologram, complete with Stark\u2019s goatee, is currently blowing kisses in his direction, complete with little blue hologram hearts that burst into helmet shaped sparkles.\nBucky hates one man.\nIt is this man.\n~~~\nA few hours after Barnes plays one final game of catch with the bots and then slinks back out of the workshop, Tony hums happily as he sucks on a piece of candy and lovingly curates the newest additions to the WIT file.\nBarnes has proven to be an exceptionally entertaining opponent and Tony\u2019s not afraid to admit that he kind of likes the guy.\nHe\u2019s intelligent, tough, has an unbelievably attractive appeal with his sexy robo-hobo aesthetic, and is, overall, pretty outspoken but easy to like for someone who spent seventy plus years as a homicidal Hot-Pocket.\nTony could almost pity him for being so close to being tipped over the edge of what\u2019s left of his sanity.\n Almost.\nInstead he\u2019s going to gleefully give him those few final shoves.\nTony has a plan.\nWell, like with most things that don\u2019t directly relate back to science, the armor, or SI, Tony has at least twelve percent of a plan.\nJARVIS is, like always, in charge of the other eighty-eight percent.\nThey have a system worked out and Tony has all the faith in the world that J will pull through for him if push comes to shove.\nIf not then he can always call Rhodey who is, despite what everyone always thinks, normally down for whatever shenanigans Tony can think of as long as they don\u2019t involve things like unprovoked/unjustified murder or treason.\nOr, oddly enough, anything to do with the entire state of Delaware*.\nRhodey, for some reason, has a mental block on the entire state but has never actually been able to explain to Tony  why.\nAfter all these years of Rhodey\u2019s adamant refusal to step foot in any part of Delaware Tony\u2019s reached the conclusion that he\u2019s pretty sure Rhodey was traumatized there in another universe or something.\nThe point is that Tony has a plan that should help him give Barnes those few final pushes over the edge.\nIt\u2019s time to get aggressive, to get up close and personal and see just how much heat the Winter Soldier can really take.\nTony\u2019s looking forward to it.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s official.\nStark\u2019s actively trying to drive him mad.\nBucky knows it.\nNo matter what Steve says or how much he protests, Bucky  knows that Stark\u2019s got it in for him\nBut, to be fair, if Stevie told him the sky was  blue  these days Bucky would have to find a window and  check. \u00a0That\u2019s the level of confidence Bucky has where Steve\u2019s word outside of the battlefield is concerned these days.\nSo, yeah, Stark\u2019s out to get him.\nIt\u2019s the only explanation.\nHe\u2019s everywhere Bucky goes these days, with his sarcasm and his fluffy hair. \u00a0The man\u2019s practically haunting Bucky\u2019s footsteps with his stupidly attractive doe eyes and his ridiculous Iron Man paraphernalia.\nIt\u2019s a twenty-four hour assault on the senses, a full blown siege of the mind.\nIf it keeps on like this then Bucky\u2019s either going to run jibbering mad into the night never to be seen again or he\u2019s going to finally shut Stark up by hitting him.\nRight in that entirely too entrancing mouth of his.\nWith his own mouth.\n Repeatedly.\nBecause, by that point, the only option besides retreat will be mouth to mouth combat.\nEither way Bucky knows he\u2019s close to snapping and when that finally happens it\u2019s going to be a toss up as to which of the two he does.\nIt also, Bucky is only mildly ashamed to admit, depends at least a little bit on what Stark\u2019s wearing at the time.\nIf it\u2019s one of his ridiculous  \u201cI Am Iron Man\u201d  t-shirts then Bucky will probably have to deal with outrunning Stevie for the rest of his life.\nIf it\u2019s one of those tank-tops that clings to him like a second skin and shows off way too much olive toned skin \u2026\n Well.\nIf that happens then all bets will probably be off.\nBucky is a man of simple tastes these days.\nTony Stark, fresh from his workshop, hair a wreck and dressed in low slung sweats and a clinging tank-top, just happens to line up with most of them.\nDamn him.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s early morning when Bucky comes across the holy grail in the form of a video.\nHe watches it once, twice, three times and feels his own incredulity grow with each viewing.\nThe video is, objectively, perfect.\nStark\u2019s somber toned in a way Bucky\u2019s never seen him outside of the most serious of battles.\nSeriousness aside he\u2019s still naturally compelling, still draws the eye and someone\u2019s attention like a magnet.\nHe\u2019s especially interesting to Bucky with the way that Bucky can see the tell-tale signs of barely concealed wounds beneath his carefully applied makeup. \u00a0Added to that is the fact that the dark, non-flashy suit he\u2019s wearing doesn\u2019t hide the way he\u2019s obviously favoring his left side.\nStark looks calm and open in a way that oozes authenticity in Bucky\u2019s opinion as he announces to the world that  he is Iron Man.\nIt\u2019s a video of the infamous press conference where Stark had, according to popular opinion, tried to deflect attention off of the real pilot of the Iron Man armor.\nIt\u2019s obviously bullshit. \u00a0Hell the look of outrage, disbelief, and flashes of bitterness that dances across Stark\u2019s face before he locks it down would have been enough to convince Bucky he was being honest on the spot.\nNow, with months of Stark being blatantly obvious about his identity, Bucky can\u2019t understand how no one had believed the man.\nThat\u2019s going to change though, if Bucky has his way about things.\nBecause this video, the sincerity Stark practically oozes at the camera, might be enough to make Steve finally believe him.\nOr at least he really hopes it will be because Bucky\u2019s running out of options by this point.\n~~~\n\u201cYou,\u201d Steve clears his throat slightly, brow furrowed and mouth turned down in concentration, \u201cyou\u2019ve given me a lot to think about Buck. \u00a0Just give me a bit alright? \u00a0I\u2019ll get back to you, I swear.\u201d\nBucky watches Steve leave the room feeling more than slightly underwhelmed.\nSteve\u2019s reaction to the press conference video and Bucky\u2019s admittedly  impassioned speech about Stark\u2019s identity had been \u2026 less than what Bucky had been expecting.\nBut then again maybe Bucky\u2019s reading too much into it.\nMaybe this finally got through to Steve and now he\u2019s really thinking about it, is connecting the dots as it were.\nMaybe Bucky will finally be free of this hell crafted out of other people\u2019s obliviousness.\n~~~\nBucky gets his answer two days later when he and Stark come up together from the workshop. \u00a0They\u2019d spent the afternoon together going over some adjustments for Bucky\u2019s arm and then having an increasingly heated debate over everything from mantis shrimp to the merits of roller-blades in a battle situation.\nThe elevator stops on the common floor and they step out together. \u00a0Bucky\u2019s not really paying attention, secure in the knowledge that JARVIS is pretty much all knowing and would warn him of any danger to himself but most especially to Stark.\nPlus he\u2019s willing to admit to being distracted by the way Stark\u2019s eyes light up when he talks about his plans for a water filtration system he\u2019s been cooking up.\nThat\u2019s why the loud cracking sound and the cheer that greets the both of them the second they turn the corner catches him so off guard.\nBucky\u2019s half way in front of Stark, a knife in one hand and the other reaching for the gun he\u2019s not wearing when he freezes.\nThe rest of the team, including an amused looking Rhodes and a blank faced Fury, is gathered in the living room of the common floor.\nThe loud crack came from a grinning Clint and Wilson who\u2019re both holding what look like some kind of streamer poppers in their hands. \u00a0The floor in front of both of them is littered with confetti and crepe paper.\nThey only capture Bucky\u2019s attention for a split second though because his eyes are immediately caught and held by what\u2019s hanging above the gathered team.\n \u2018Happy Intervention!\u2019  the large and surprisingly well made banner screams in huge, blocky gold letters.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Stark whispers at his side, \u201cnot again.\u201d\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve chooses that moment to step forward. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we care about you.\u201d\n\u201cOh sweet baby Sagan it\u2019s not for me,\u201d Stark slumps in relief and goes to move away from Bucky\u2019s side.\nBucky moves on instinct and reaches out to hook his fingers in the collar of Stark\u2019s ridiculous t-shirt. \u00a0He tugs Stark back to his side with barely any effort and settles his metal hand on the back of his neck in a silent gesture to  stay.\nThere\u2019s no way in hell Bucky\u2019s doing this, whatever the fuck it\u2019s supposed to be, alone.\nBesides, something\u2019s telling him that this all loops back to Stark somehow anyways. \u00a0Most things in Bucky\u2019s life do these days.\n\u201cRhodey,\u201d Stark whines but it\u2019s easy for Bucky to ignore. \u00a0Stark doesn\u2019t try to get away from him again though. \u00a0Only reaches his hands out in the direction of Rhodes who isn\u2019t even paying attention anymore because he seems to be doing his best to smother himself in a pillow.\nHe\u2019s obviously trying to conceal his laughter if the way his shoulders are shaking is any indication. \u00a0The asshole.\n\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky says with an applaudable amount of calm, \u201cwhat in the fuck is going on here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an intervention Barnes,\u201d Wilson calls from across the room and Bucky flips him off on reflex alone. \u00a0Wilson always provokes that reaction from him for some reason.\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried about you, Buck. \u00a0I\u2019m worried about you,\u201d Steve says gently as he steps forward some more, hands out stretched like Bucky\u2019s a skittish animal he needs to gentle. \u00a0\u201cThis obsession of yours \u2026 well we thought it was time we talked to you about it. \u00a0See what there is we can do to help. \u00a0Because that\u2019s all we want to do Buck, help you.\u201d\n\u201cMy obsession?\u201d \u00a0Bucky\u2019s eyes track from Steve\u2019s concerned face back up to the banner. \u00a0It really is attention grabbing with its dark red background and golden letters.\nThere\u2019s also a concerning amount of glitter.\nBucky\u2019s fully ready to blame Clint and Wilson for the entire thing even if the laser precise edges of the letters screams Natasha and the overall color scheme and layout screams Steve.\nThis, whatever this is, was obviously a group effort.\n\u201cWe know you\u2019ve had a hard time getting adjusted after everything,\u201d Steve keeps going earnestly. \u00a0\u201cI had a hard time too but the team, well they helped pull me out of it. \u00a0So we want to do that for you too.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s eyes track back to Steve then back to the banner.\nBack to Steve in his khakis and pressed shirt.\nBack to the red and gold banner.\nBack to Steve with his stupid hair and puppy eyes.\nBack to the  red and gold ban -\n Wait.\nNo.\n No.\nBucky  refuses to believe this is really happening to him.\nBut, like with so many other things in his life, the unbelievable seems determined to keep coming true.\n\u201cWe need to talk about how you\u2019re obsessed with Tony being Iron Man,\u201d Steve finally cuts to the point. \u00a0\u201cLetting your feelings for the two of them get twisted up like this isn\u2019t healthy Buck. \u00a0Let us help you.\u201d\nBeside him Stark  cackles with glee.\nBucky feels absolutely no guilt in using his hold on the back of his neck to push him to the ground.\n~~~\nThe intervention is actually pretty nice once Bucky stops trying to strangle Steve and Rhodes stops basically screaming in laughter.\nThere\u2019s music and fruit drinks. \u00a0The team comes by and tells him how much they care about him, even Clint and Wilson. \u00a0Rhodes manages to look him in the eye for an entire six seconds before he breaks down again and stumbles away.\nThe Hulk drew him a pretty cool card and Bruce, as it turns out, has baked a truly massive chocolate orange cake with toffee bits.\nBucky feels no shame in eating half of it on his own because it\u2019s his goddamn intervention  and that means the cake is his too. \u00a0It\u2019s good enough that two pieces and half way through Steve\u2019s next heartfelt speech his mood has mellowed out a bit.\nHe doesn\u2019t even mind the way Stark picks bits and pieces of it off of his plate like the scavenger he not so secretly is. \u00a0Instead Bucky just sighs and makes sure he gives the bastard most of the icing off of his portion as well.\nAn hour in and Fury swoops down on him like the giant candy bat he is.\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Fury says as he dips his head towards where Stark\u2019s currently hanging off of Bruce\u2019s arm, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need it, you poor bastard.\u201d\nBefore Bucky can riddle out exactly what Fury means the man drops two extra large bags of candy on his lap and swoops back away.\nFinally Bucky shrugs, pockets one of the bags of candy, and automatically holds the other out to Stark who\u2019s already making a beeline for him.\nMaybe interventions aren\u2019t so bad after all.\n~~~\nTony steps back from the armor, polishing rag in hand.\nYes, this \u2026 this is  perfect.\nTruly a masterpiece.\nTony has, once again, outdone himself.\n\u201cJust as I think you cannot outdo yourself you somehow rise to new heights Sir,\u201d JARVIS chimes in solemnly. \u00a0\u201cOr perhaps you sink to new depths. \u00a0It is, I have found, rather debatable.\u201d\n\u201cI know, baby boy,\u201d Tony says proudly, chest heavy with emotion. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the burden we geniuses have to bare.\u201d\n\u201cYour humility is truly your greatest strength,\u201d JARVIS snips.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Tony props his hands on his hips, head tilted to the side as he stares at the armor, \u201cI almost feel bad about this, what with the intervention and all.\u201d\n\u201cAre you having second thoughts Sir?\u201d \u00a0JARVIS seems genuinely surprised and curious.\n\u201cPlease J,\u201d Tony brings a hand up to tap at the arc reactor, \u201cdon\u2019t be offensive. \u00a0Second thoughts are for quitters.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say Sir,\u201d JARVIS replies, \u201cas you say.\u201d\n~~~\nThe battle\u2019s nothing serious, not really. \u00a0Just AIM goons intent on being annoying like they normally are at least once a month.\nOverall they\u2019re really nothing to worry about.\nWhich is a good thing considering how Bucky freezes when Stark shows up on the scene, landing on the street directly in front of him.\nBucky blinks, takes a moment to internalize just what he\u2019s seeing, and then forcefully shuts that part of his mind down.\nHe can\u2019t deal with this now.\nLater maybe.\nDefinitely.\nBut not now.\n~~~\nBucky\u2019s discovered over the past three hours that he can\u2019t get drunk anymore no matter how hard he tries.\nAnd, sitting with his back against the window of his floor\u2019s living room, surrounded by a sea of empty liquor bottles, he\u2019s  actively trying.\nHe\u2019s pretty sure most people would be dead by now if they drank even half of the liquor he has in the past few hours.\nYet another sin he can lay at HYDRA\u2019s doorstep. \u00a0And, at the moment, it\u2019s the one that\u2019s hurting him the most.\n\u201cWell,\u201d a infuriatingly familiar voice chimes in, \u201cJ said you were down here trying to drown yourself but I can honestly say this wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a clink of bottles and the padding of footsteps and then Bucky can feel Stark crouch down at his side. \u00a0A hand comes up and pats at his hair.\n\u201cDid you knock over a liquor store or something Cold Stone?\u201d \u00a0Stark asks. \u00a0\u201cAm I gonna have to hide you from the fuzz?\u201d\nBucky just makes a grumbling sound in the back of his throat as he curls in on himself tighter where he\u2019s balled up on the floor, depressingly sober.\n\u201cAw, use your people words,\u201d Stark tugs lightly at his hair.\nAnd that right there?\nThat\u2019s the breaking point.\nBucky surges up out of his curled up ball and into Stark\u2019s space so fast that the other man jolts back with a small yelp. \u00a0Bucky doesn\u2019t let him fall backwards though.\nInstead he reaches out, curls both hands in the front of Stark\u2019s tank top, and pulls him close until their noses are practically touching.\n\u201cHow could they not know?\u201d \u00a0Bucky\u2019s hands clench in Stark\u2019s tank top. \u00a0He can hear the desperation in his own voice, knows it\u2019s mirrored in his expression.\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about Klondike.\u201d \u00a0Stark tells him with a ragged sort of determination. \u00a0Bucky knows that it\u2019s because, by this point, he\u2019s in too deep to take any other stance.\n\u201cI have literally watched you step out of the armor.\u201d Bucky shakes him just a bit. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s custom built to your fucking pocket sized ass. \u00a0 You put a decal across the back that says \u2018Tony Stark Is Driving'.\u201d\n\u201cThere there,\u201d Stark reaches up and pats him lightly on the shoulders. \u00a0\u201cObviously it\u2019s all a coincidence. \u00a0Although you\u2019ve got to admit that decal is a work of art.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re so  stupid.\u201d \u00a0To his horror Bucky can feel actual tears well up in his eyes. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re stupid. \u00a0We\u2019re all going to die someday because  they\u2019re too stupid to live.\u201d\n\u201cAw Bucky,  babe, I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Stark,Tony, practically coos at him as Bucky hunches over so that his face is buried in the crook of his neck. \u00a0\u201cThe first step is admitting there\u2019s a problem. \u00a0And you\u2019ve just done that. \u00a0Now the healing can begin.\u201d\nAnd Bucky, well, he\u2019s reached his breaking point and Tony is wearing one of those clingy fucking tank-tops.\nSo he does the only thing he really can do.\nHe picks his head up, pulls Tony even closer, and  finally kisses him.\nIt\u2019s deep and hot and heady. \u00a0Tony tastes like sugar and coffee and his goatee scratches against Bucky\u2019s own stubble in a way that makes Bucky think about beard burn and red marks left on olive skin.\nIt\u2019s so, so  good.\n\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Tony says breathlessly when they finally pull apart, both of them flushed and panting, hands buried in each other\u2019s hair. \u00a0\u201cWelcome to the dark side.\u201d\n\u201cShut up and kiss me Tony,\u201d Bucky huffs in exasperation.\nThen he makes sure that Tony\u2019s mouth is too busy to do anything else.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Tony pants, lips kiss swollen and body flushed with afterglow, \u201cwanna make a bet?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d \u00a0Bucky hums his question, mouth apparently still too occupied with sucking red marks across the line of Tony\u2019s collarbone to be bothered to use actual words.\nTony can\u2019t help but wonder if HYDRA dosed him with fucking  vampire blood or something. \u00a0It would explain why he\u2019s so obsessed with gnawing on Tony.\nNot that Tony minds, of course.\nIn fact he is the exact opposite of someone who minds.\nHe plans to be completely supportive of Bucky\u2019s newly revealed fetish.\nBecause he\u2019s a naturally helpful and supportive kind of person.\n\u201cBet you it takes them at least three months to catch onto this,\u201d Tony flaps his hand to indicate the way the two of them are sweaty and entwined on the floor together.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Bucky finally pulls back enough to answer him. \u00a0His eyes are heavy lidded and there\u2019s a telltale flush high on his cheeks. \u00a0\u201cNot taking any bets over those idiots. \u00a0It\u2019s asking to be disappointed somehow.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point on that one,\u201d Tony agrees as he reaches up to thumb at Bucky\u2019s lower lip, breath hitching just a bit when he nips at the pad of his thumb. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we could fuck on the common room floor during dinner and they\u2019d ask us if we had fun playing Twister instead.\u201d\n\u201cStevie\u2019d probably ask us how long we been sparring together,\u201d Bucky admits even as he dips down and kisses Tony again. \u00a0His metal hand trails teasingly down the side of Tony\u2019s rib cage and then keeps going. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019d have to kill him \u2018cause he\u2019d probably ask to join.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Tony hums as he arches up into the solid line of heat and muscle that\u2019s nestled between his thighs. \u00a0\u201cInteresting i-idea there, ugh, sweetheart, might have t-to revisit that.\u201d\n\u201cShut up  myshka,\u201d Bucky tells him with a surprisingly fond roll of his eyes.\nAnd Tony does.\nBut only because he was going to anyways.\n~~~\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Tony jolts upright two or so hours after they finally stumbled their way up to Tony\u2019s floor and his giant bed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky mutters from where his face is pressed against Tony\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cDid you call me  little mouse?\u201d \u00a0Tony pokes at his cheek with a finger. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous name and I demand you take it back.\u201d\nHe sounds so legitimately offended that Bucky immediately vows to call him  myshka as often as possible.\n\u201cNo.\u201d \u00a0Bucky tells him seriously. \u00a0\u201cIt suits you. \u00a0You\u2019re small, your hair\u2019s soft, and, most importantly of all,  you\u2019re unbelievably annoying. \u00a0It\u2019s perfect.\u201d\nTony deliberates for a moment.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he finally sighs as he flops back down, eyes already drooping sleepily, \u201cyou might have a point. \u00a0I don\u2019t agree with the small part but I\u2019ll allow it.\u201d\n\u201cShut up and go back to sleep,\u201d Bucky pauses for a second, \u201cmyshka.\u201d\n\u201cMy revenge will be sweet,\u201d Tony mutters. \u00a0\u201cAnd unexpected.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s honestly kind of looking forward to it.\n~~~\nThe next morning the two of them stumble through an exceptionally long shower together because they seem to have a problem with actually getting clean.\nBy the time they\u2019re done and dressed Bucky\u2019s pretty sure that no one could possibly miss what they\u2019ve been up to.\nBut he\u2019s learned the hard way not to make assumptions about what is and is not obvious to other people. \u00a0If something looks obvious to him then the others probably wouldn\u2019t notice it if it slapped them in the fucking face.\n\n Or flew around in a personalized suit of armor. \n\nStill, serum keeping Bucky himself unmarked or not, the way that Tony looks so freshly fucked, bite marks obvious on his collarbones and lips still swollen, should set off alarm bells for anyone with functioning eyes.\nSo, again, he\u2019s pretty sure no one else in the Tower will notice.\nIf they keep missing out on the fact that  Tony is Iron Man  then there\u2019s absolutely  no way  they\u2019ll pick up on the fact that they\u2019d spent the last ten or so hours doing filthy, filthy things to each other.\nNo way in hell.\n~~~\n\u201cHey Nat,\u201d Clint calls as soon as they step into the kitchen where the others are gathered. \u00a0\u201cYou lose. \u00a0Now you owe me  blini.\u201d\nNatasha turns from her place at the counter, takes one look at Bucky and Tony, and curses viciously before she heads to the pantry and starts pulling down ingredients.\nBucky\u2019s momentarily mystified.\n\u201cWhat the hell kind of bet did you beat Itsy Bitsy out on?\u201d \u00a0Tony asks with an appropriate level of awe.\n\u201cAbout when you two were finally gonna fuck,\u201d Clint grins around his half eaten eggo. \u00a0\u201cShe had you pegged for about two months from now cause you\u2019re both oblivious idiots. \u00a0But Winter has finally come so that means I won.\u201d\nBucky is immediately frozen and from the look of it Tony\u2019s no better, mouth gaped open just a bit and expression as incredulous as Bucky feels.\n \u2018Oblivious idiots\u2019, the phrase reverberates in Bucky\u2019s head. \u00a0He  dared\u00a0...\n\u201cCongratulations you two,\u201d Steve beams brightly as he moves around Wilson who\u2019s slumped against the counter. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s about time. \u00a0We\u2019ve all been waiting for it to finally happen. \u00a0I\u2019m glad the intervention helped you two finally set things straight with each other.\u201d\n\u201cYou \u2026 you\u2019ve been waiting?\u201d \u00a0Tony sounds almost as dazed as Bucky himself feels.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve grins at them, smug and pleased. \u00a0\u201cYou were both really obvious. \u00a0Besides, we\u2019re the Avengers Tony. \u00a0I can\u2019t believe you thought you could hide something like this from us.\u201d\n \u2018Obvious,\u2019  The word rings like a death knell in Bucky\u2019s mind.\u00a0 'We\u2019re the Avengers.'\nNow this, Bucky knows, is  exactly what going mad feels like.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill \u2018em,\u201d Bucky says serenely as he turns enough to look down at Tony who\u2019s slumped, shell-shocked and obviously overwhelmed, against his side. \u00a0\u201cHope you\u2019re ready for a life on the run,  myshka, because  I\u2019m gonna murder every single one of them.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing, sweetheart,\u201d Tony says faintly. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a ride-or-die kind of girl.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cObvious,\u201d Bucky snarls a few hours later, hands raised up like he\u2019s trying to strangle the air in front of him. \u00a0\u201cDid you hear that bullshit?\u00a0\u00a0We were fucking obvious. \u00a0Like they\u2019re not the stupidest fuckers I\u2019ve ever met.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t get defrosted for this shit.\u201d\nTony would poke fun at him if he wasn\u2019t currently feeling the same sort of hysterical rage.\nBecause \u2026  how? \nJust, that\u2019s the question that keeps ringing in Tony\u2019s head.\n\n How? \n\nHow did the biggest band of oblivious idiots Tony\u2019s ever met clock the fact that him and Bucky spent the night defiling each other? \u00a0Especially when they can\u2019t even tell that Tony is Iron Man when he announced it at a press conference?\nTony can feel the yawning abyss of madness reaching out for him the longer he keeps trying to rationalize the entire thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to become a supervillain,\u201d Tony realizes in a moment of startling clarity. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re going to drive me the rest of the way over the edge and I\u2019m going to turn to evil to cope. \u00a0I\u2019m going to take over the world and then I\u2019m going to make Pepper run it. \u00a0It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\nTony finds that the idea doesn\u2019t upset him as much as he assumed it would. \u00a0Actually there\u2019s an amazing amount of peace and acceptance coursing through him at the moment.\nOn the other side of the room Bucky\u2019s busy cursing and bending steel pipes in half in an effort to expel his rage, the muscles of his shoulders rippling as he moves. \u00a0The bots are crowded around him, offering new things for him to break from the pile Tony set aside for just that purpose. \u00a0They seem to be a mix of commiserating and gleeful if the beeps and clicks Tony can hear are any indication.\nTony settles back into his chair to watch.\nHe might not have teammates who could deduce their way out of a paper bag when it comes to anything that isn\u2019t sex or a battlefield strategy but least he has this.\n~~~\nAfter that initial bump in the road, and the following two weeks of Steve pouting after Bucky stops trying to passive aggressively murder him, things even out a bit.\nThe dark side, as Tony insists on calling it, turns out to be  way less stressful than whatever side Bucky had been on before.\nIt\u2019s like once Bucky stops resisting the inevitable he and Tony fit even deeper into each other\u2019s space, both physical and otherwise, than before. \u00a0They slot together with almost ridiculous ease, their parts complimentary instead of opposing.\nBucky starts spending even more of his time in the workshop with Tony and the bots. \u00a0It\u2019s comfortable and entertaining and feels like home.\nIn return Tony slinks out of his workshop to spend some time in the gym with Bucky in the afternoons.\nAnd they\u2019re now each others automatic plus one to any event they have to attend so there\u2019s no more boring galas with no dates and a lack of explosions.\nIt\u2019s surprisingly \u2026  easy.\nThe best part, in Bucky\u2019s opinion, is that whenever he gets the urge to lay hands on Tony\u2019s too tempting ass, or bite that pouty bottom lip, or tug at that messy hair of his, he doesn\u2019t have to knuckle under and ignore it anymore.\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s a major bonus.\nBeyond that initial bit of friction, life in the Tower in general smoothes out.\nSteve stops looking so worried all of the time and staring at Bucky soulfully from a distance, thank Thor. \u00a0Everyone else stops watching Bucky with that special mix of pity and wariness they\u2019d adopted at the height of his  \u2018Tony Is Iron Man You Stupid Fucks\u2019  phase.\nOf course most days Bucky still wants to strangle all of them.\nBut only just a little bit, a tiny strangle at most.\nThankfully he\u2019s learning to move past that gut impulse.\nWith the help of JARVIS\u2019 deep breathing techniques, and a lot of time spent mouthing at Tony\u2019s collarbones, Bucky is officially working on rebuilding his emotional moorings in a place that falls somewhere between serenity and sheer heart stopping rage.\nIt\u2019s a work in progress.\n\u201cWe all are, sweetheart,\u201d Tony always says with sage wisdom right before he does something that, inevitably, causes him to get doused with DUM-E\u2019s fire extinguisher.\nSo life in the Tower, with the team, with Tony, is good.\n~~~\n\u201cPresent time, orso polare.\u201d \u00a0Tony shoves the box into Bucky\u2019s chest, surprisingly nervous for something so simple.\n\u201cPolar Bear?\u201d \u00a0Bucky cuts an unimpressed look in his direction even as he grabs the box. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the best you can do  myshka?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re large, spent a long time in the ice, and are, most importantly of all,  prone to murderous rages,\u201d Tony shrugs. \u00a0\u201cIt suits you. \u00a0Now open your present.\u201d\nBucky squints at him for a second.\n\u201cFair,\u201d he finally admits. \u00a0\u201cNow what in the hell is this?\u201d\n\u201cOpen it and find out,\u201d Tony prompts as he throws himself into his chair and picks up a screwdriver to fiddle with.\nBucky cracks the box open with ease and reaches a hand inside. \u00a0Tony watches as he pulls the first thing out of the box and shakes it out until he can see what\u2019s on it.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Tony prompts after a too long moment of silence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s  hideous,\u201d Bucky says softly even as he proceeds to immediately switch the shirt he\u2019s wearing for the one he\u2019s just pulled out of the box.\nTony watches fondly as he runs silver fingers over the gold lettering that\u2019s stretched across his chest.\n \u2018My Boyfriend Is Iron Man\u2019  the red and gold t-shirt proudly announces. \u00a0It, just like Tony\u2019s own shirts of the same style, also has a perfect replica of his goatee at the bottom.\nIt\u2019s also a symbol of just how serious Tony is about this thing between him and Bucky.\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d Bucky insists as he rounds the corner of the table and bends down to kiss Tony deeply. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Tony grins up at him. \u00a0\u201cJARVIS\u2019 apparently had a whole line of stuff drawn up and set aside for a few months now.\u201d\n\u201cI had anticipated they might be needed Sir,\u201d JARVIS chimes in.\n\u201cThanks to you too then,\u201d Bucky nods at the nearest camera.\n\u201cA pleasure Sergeant Barnes,\u201d JARVIS assures him. \u00a0\u201cI also included some new items for Sir as well.\u201d\n\u201cOh, more goodies,\u201d Tony squirms out of his chair and around Bucky to start rooting through the box because he hadn\u2019t greenlighted more stuff for himself. \u00a0Leave it to JARVIS to anticipate his needs in this too.\nHe finally pulls out a long sleeve shirt that\u2019s obviously more his size than Bucky\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s black, except for the left arm that\u2019s been printed to match Bucky\u2019s, complete with the red star.\nThe red letters across the front proclaim that  \u2018My Boyfriend Is The Winter Soldier'.\nTony absolutely  adores it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect J,\u201d he can\u2019t help but grin as he pulls his tank-top off and slips his new shirt on. \u00a0\u201cHow\u2019d I make you so perfect?\u201d\n\u201cA question I wrestle with daily, Sir.\u201d \u00a0JARVIS says smugly.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tony turns back towards Bucky who looks more than a bit intrigued at the sight of Tony\u2019s new shirt. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve already joined the dark side. \u00a0We\u2019ve got a matching wardrobe and everything now. \u00a0So I\u2019d say it\u2019s time to get to work.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silent contemplation.\nAnd then \u2026\nBucky  smiles.\n~~~\nBucky\u2019s shirt gets a few raised brows and one truly severe frown from Steve but no one says anything.\nThey also don\u2019t say anything about the Iron Man sleep pants Bucky takes to wearing or the red and gold color scheme the new goggles Tony makes him take on.\nBucky would say he\u2019s surprised but he\u2019s honestly not.\nBy now there\u2019s probably not much that could surprise him.\nFor his part Bucky\u2019s surprisingly fine with the fact that most of his casual clothes have ended up either branded with  Stark Industries  or are some kind of ridiculous novelty shirt that JARVIS and the bots obviously thought up.\nTony, as it turns out, is just as territorial over Bucky as Bucky is over him.\nIt\u2019s  nice.\n~~~\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re going to have to step up our game,\u201d Tony informs him seriously. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s take this to the next level.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Bucky agrees.\nWorking with Tony is, as he\u2019d discovered early on, far more satisfying than working against him.\n~~~\nBucky stares in fond exasperation as Tony zooms by him in the armor, repulsors flaring as he cuts through the Doom bots that have infested the street around them.\nThe  \u2018Property of Bucky Barnes\u2019  decal that sits low down on the armor\u2019s back is a nice touch in his opinion.\nThe \u2018tramp stamp\u2019 as Tony calls it, goes well with the  \u2018Tony Stark Is Driving\u2019  decal that runs across the back of the armor\u2019s shoulders.\n~~~\nIn the aftermath of the battle Bucky waits until the others have all finished their respective jobs before he strides over to where Tony\u2019s standing in the armor and reaches up to knock on the faceplate.\n\u201cOpen up  myshka,\u201d Bucky commands, not even making effort to speak lowly.\n\u201cYes dear?\u201d Tony says as he pops it open immediately.\nBucky doesn\u2019t answer, just reaches up, pulls Tony closer with a hand on the back of his neck, and kisses him deeply.\nRight out on the street, in full view of the gathered press and all of their teammates.\n~~~\n\u201cBucky how could you?\u201d \u00a0Steve looks absolutely crushed when he confronts him in the shared common room a few hours later after everyone\u2019s cleaned up and gathered together for food.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d I do this time Stevie?\u201d \u00a0Bucky sighs tiredly.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve turns towards Tony then, expression earnest and beseeching. \u00a0\u201cI swear I didn\u2019t know, none of us did. \u00a0But you\u2019re my friend too and I can\u2019t let this go.\u201d\n\u201cGonna need an explanation Spangles,\u201d Tony points out wryly.\n\u201cBucky\u2019s stepping out on you with Iron Man,\u201d Steve blurts with a wince like he\u2019s throwing some unbearably painful news in Tony\u2019s direction. \u00a0\u201cHe kissed him after the battle, right in front of everyone.\u201d\nTony abruptly chokes on his own tongue, hands flying up to cover his face as he hunches forward, shoulders shaking.\n\u201cSteve you fucking snitch,\u201d Bucky deadpans as he reaches up to pinch at the bridge of his nose. \u00a0His best friend\u2019s a fucking idiot. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m betrayed. \u00a0You\u2019ve betrayed me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only right Buck,\u201d Steve stares at him narrow eyed and openly disappointed. \u00a0\u201cHow could you and Shellhead do that to Tony? \u00a0I know we wanted you to work out your feelings for the two of them but not like  this.\u201d\nBeside them Tony wheezes out a snorting breath.\n\u201cLook at him,\u201d Steve steps forward to place a large hand on Tony\u2019s hunched back. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s devastated Bucky. \u00a0How could you do this?\u201d\nBucky stares at him and then looks down at Tony who seems pretty close to having a laughter induced seizure.\n\u201cAt this point,\u201d Bucky answers candidly, \u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure myself.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d the reporter starts, \u201cis there any truth to the rumor that you\u2019re cheating on Tony Stark with your teammate Iron Man?\u201d\nBucky cuts a look at Tony who\u2019s sitting beside him in his civilian clothes, red and gold sunglasses firmly in place, looking ridiculously attractive in his red blazer and black  Winter Has Come  t-shirt.\nThe hand he has on Bucky\u2019s thigh beneath the table slides teasingly upwards.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Bucky answers after a small pause, leaning back so that his  Iron Man\u2019s Boyfriend t-shirt is on full display.\n\u201cSo the photos of you kissing Iron Man after the Avenger\u2019s latest battle two days ago aren\u2019t proof that you\u2019re being unfaithful?\u201d \u00a0The reporter looks smug, like she thinks she\u2019s caught Bucky in some kind of scandalous lie.\n\u201cAin\u2019t steppin out if Tony knows about it,\u201d Bucky says with a deliberately nonchalant shrug because  why the fuck not? \u00a0This plays right into his and Tony\u2019s plans and it\u2019s not like they\u2019d believe him if he told them the truth anyways.\nPredictably the crowd of reporters go wild.\n~~~\n\u201cI want you to know I support you,\u201d Steve claps him on the shoulder earnestly after they finally escape the press conference. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I jumped to conclusions about everything. \u00a0I should\u2019ve trusted you, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky drawls with no small amount of irony. \u00a0\u201cIf only you\u2019d trusted me. \u00a0We could\u2019ve avoided so many misunderstandings.\u201d\n\u201cI promise to do my best to believe in you even more in the future.\u201d \u00a0Steve promises sunnily. \u00a0\u201cStill, despite all of that, it\u2019s nice to know that all three of my best friends are happy together.\u201d\nThe exasperated screaming that\u2019s been beating around in the back of Bucky\u2019s head since he first moved into the Tower abruptly ramps up another notch.\nHe\u2019s going to need some quality time with Tony\u2019s collarbones after this.\n~~~\n \u2018Barnes/Stark/Iron Man Caught In Illicit Gay Threesome,\u2019  the headlines proclaim the next day.\nThe large bold letters are set above a photo of Bucky kissing Iron Man sitting side by side with a picture of Bucky pressing Tony up against a tree in the nearby park.\nTony gets multiple copies of the headline framed and hangs them up in the lab, the penthouse, and on the refrigerator on the common floor.\nJARVIS gets a set of matching t-shirts made up for him with the page proudly displayed on the front.\nTony makes sure to wear his the next time he leaves the Tower.\nHe\u2019s trying to be supportive after all and it\u2019s not everyday he\u2019s accused of being in a threesome with a supersoldier and  himself because his boyfriend couldn\u2019t help but taunt some reporters.\nNeedless to say he\u2019s very proud.\n~~~\nThe  #IronStarkSoldier  that hits the internet and rapidly takes on a life of its own is one of his finer works if Tony does say so himself.\nBucky, because he has zero taste in anything except for his taste in men, seems to prefer the  #WinterIronStark \nJARVIS ends the argument by creating the  #IronTucky  name and proceeds to gloat smugly when people latch onto it instead.\nTraitor.\n~~~\nTime flies by in a haze of battles and laughter, in kisses and exasperated fondness, weeks and then months passing by with ease.\nIn that time Tony learns a lesson so deep and profound that the realization almost brings a tear to his eye.\n\n The couple that trolls together, stays together. \n\n~~~\nAnd then, of course, Tony gets kidnapped.\n~~~\n\u201cYou do know that SI doesn\u2019t pay ransom demands don\u2019t you?\u201d \u00a0Tony asks, eyes holding steady on his captor\u2019s faces even as his fingers work at loosening the ropes behind his back.\n\u201cYou can keep your money Stark,\u201d Head Goon snaps. \u00a0\u201cWe want Iron Man and you\u2019re going to give him to us.\u201d\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Tony groans even as the ropes loosen. \u00a0Thankfully the watch on his wrist has been buzzing against his skin in confirmation for the past fifteen minutes or so. \u00a0The armor, and likely reinforcements in the form of a severely pissed off Bucky, should be here soon. \u00a0\u201cIs it too much to ask for some decent villains? \u00a0I\u2019m already on a team with a bunch of  goddamn morons  and now I\u2019ve gotta put up with being kidnapped by them too?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Random Goon #2 bites out indignantly from the back of the room.\n\u201cFuck you very much Random Goon #2,\u201d Tony snaps back. \u00a0\u201cThis is  bullshit. \u00a0I could be home right now, down in the workshop reinventing an industry or something. \u00a0Or I could be busy getting felt up by my  criminally hot super soldier boyfriend. \u00a0Or hell, maybe both because I\u2019m a  multitasking fiend.\u201d\nHead Goon blinks at him dumbly. \u00a0Which Tony can plainly see because  he was too stupid to wear a mask.\n\u201cBut no,\u201d Tony drawls the word out, \u201cinstead I\u2019m here, my head hurts, and I\u2019m stuck looking at you assholes who all seem to think I\u2019m going to what? Hand over the armor to some no name thugs who only got the drop on me because I stopped to pet a fucking cat?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long moment of silence in the room that\u2019s abruptly interrupted by a slightly muffled explosion from outside.\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d Tony says triumphantly as he throws his now free arms up in the air, watch gauntlet now fully active, \u201cwould be my Murder Muffin now.\u201d\nAnother, louder, explosion sounds closer than before and the walls of the room shake just a bit and Head Goon abruptly goes pale.\n\u201cWe can either do this the easy way or you can resist and  well,\u201d Tony shrugs, \u201cthat won\u2019t end well for any of you. \u00a0So, choice is yours. \u00a0Personally I\u2019m kind of hoping you\u2019ll resist.\u201d\nSurprisingly enough, even when faced with a rapidly approaching Winter Solider and a currently pissed off Tony Stark, they still choose the second option.\n~~~\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t even get kidnapped by competent villains,\u201d Tony grumbles even as Bucky kicks Head Goon in the ribs again despite the way he\u2019s tied up and obviously not going anywhere.\nHonestly they hadn\u2019t been much of a challenge for Tony to take down and he\u2019s pretty sure that Bucky\u2019s just pissed because Tony already had them subdued when he showed up with the armor at his back.\n\u201cStop bitchin,\u201d Bucky snaps as he turns away from Head Goon. \u00a0His arm snaps out and he tugs Tony closer, pulls him to his chest and bends down so he can kiss him hotly, relief obvious in his every move.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony says softly once they pull apart, \u201cI\u2019m okay. \u00a0They didn\u2019t even bruise me. \u00a0I\u2019m Iron Man, remember?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time Tony\u2019s ever come out and said the words in all seriousness despite everything else that\u2019s passed between them.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky says roughly as he presses their foreheads together. \u00a0\u201cYeah you are.\u201d\n~~~\nThe team\u2019s appropriately grateful when he gets back to the Tower unharmed except for the headache. \u00a0Stretched out on the couch on top of Bucky Tony takes a few to bask in their genuine care.\n\u201cOnly you could get kidnapped because you tried to pet a cat,\u201d Clint slaps Tony on the back roughly. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why I keep telling you that dogs are where it\u2019s at. \u00a0Besides Iron Man needs to step up his game if he\u2019s letting you get nabbed a bunch of pathetic bastards who don\u2019t even have villain names. \u00a0Cap\u2019s gonna give him an earful next team training. \u00a0He\u2019s probably gonna want you to take up some training too since you never join us for sparring.\u201d\nBeneath him Bucky\u2019s chest rumbles in barely suppressed laughter.\nTony just sighs, shifts his head a bit, and bites down meanly on Bucky\u2019s nipple through his  \u2018My Boyfriend Wears Armor\u2019  t-shirt.\nThe yelp he gets in return is worth the way Bucky dumps him off the couch a few seconds later.\n~~~\n\u201cIt ever bother you?\u201d \u00a0Bucky asks him later on that night when they\u2019re sprawled in Tony\u2019s bed, flushed and sweaty with the sheets sticking to their skin. \u00a0\u201cThem not believing you?\u201d\n\u201cEh,\u201d Tony raises a hand and makes a so-so gesture, \u201clittle bit. \u00a0Used to be worse, in the beginning. \u00a0Then you popped up. \u00a0Being bitter mostly took a backseat to torturing you. \u00a0Now I\u2019m pretty fine with it.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure if I should be offended or touched,\u201d Bucky admits after a moment.\n\u201cWhen in doubt go with both.\u201d Tony tells him around a yawn.\n\u201cI still think we\u2019re all gonna die one day because they\u2019re too fucking stupid to function.\u201d \u00a0Bucky points out. \u00a0\u201cOr I\u2019m gonna kill \u2018em myself.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Tony agrees lightly. \u00a0\u201cBut, either way, we\u2019ll do it like Spangles always says.\u00a0 Together.\u201d\n\u201cSounds pretty good I guess,\u201d Bucky\u2019s smile is evident in his tone. \u00a0\u201cAlways figured Stevie\u2019d get my ass killed one day anyways.\u201d\n\u201cWell, just look at it this way,\u201d Tony rolls over and props his chin on Bucky\u2019s chest, \u201cthey might be idiots, but they\u2019re our idiots.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Bucky hums as he reaches up and tugs at Tony\u2019s hair. \u00a0\u201cYeah, they kind of are.\u201d\n~~~\nThey\u2019re in the kitchen when it finally happens. \u00a0Tony\u2019s making coffee for the both of them while Bucky leans against the counter and stares at his ass.\n\u201cHey Bucky, Tony,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice is hesitant, unsure in a way that Steve normally never is.\n\u201cYeah Stevie?\u201d \u00a0Bucky cuts a look over his shoulder towards Steve as Tony waggles his fingers in Steve\u2019s direction. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to ask this so I\u2019m just going to come out and say it,\u201d Steve rakes his hands through his hair and his eyes keep darting between Tony and Bucky. \u00a0\u201cIs \u2026 do you think \u2026 I know this might sound ridiculous but ... Tony are you \u2026 are you Iron Man?\u201d\nBucky freezes for a split second as his mind reboots.\nAcross from him, hands held frozen in the air above him, sugar spilling off the side of the spoon he\u2019s holding, Tony looks like he\u2019s in the same kind of position.\nBecause this, this is the moment they\u2019ve both been waiting for for so long now.\nThe moment they\u2019ve both come to accept would probably never happen.\nBut, despite his previous quest to expose the truth, Bucky knows that in this moment this isn\u2019t his answer to give.\nHe catches Tony\u2019s eye, his brow arched and question plain in his features.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous Steve,\u201d Tony scoffs from across the bar even as he dumps the spoon into a familiar red coffee cup and then reaches out to hand the other silver  \u2018Single. Taken. Dating Iron Man\u2019  cup to Bucky. \u00a0There\u2019s a little red x in the box beside  Dating Iron Man of course. \u00a0\u201cWhat in the world makes you think I\u2019m Iron Man?\u201d\nAnd then he waves, turns on his head, and walks away. \u00a0The  \u2018Single. Taken. I Am Iron Man.\u2019 plain to see on the back of his shirt. \u00a0The x is, of course, right where it should be.\n\u201cYou heard the man,\u201d Bucky says as he reaches up, claps Steve on the shoulder roughly, and then takes off after Tony, coffee cup in hand and eyes glued to his ass.\nHe\u2019s finally reached a peace of sorts with the whole situation, thanks in no small part to his and Tony\u2019s relationship.\nIf Steve\u2019s finally going to catch a clue-by-four to that thick ass head of his then that\u2019s fine.\nBut Bucky\u2019s done holding his hand and trying to lead him to that particular well of truth. \u00a0Hell, by this point he\u2019s more interested in making things more difficult for Steve and the others.\nBesides, he\u2019s got more important things to worry about.\nLike the fact that Tony\u2019s wearing those underwear he likes best, the lacy black ones with the little red stars all over them.\nBucky intends to make sure he\u2019s not wearing them for much longer.\nEverything else is secondary.\n\u00a0"
