He does indeed have a Quirk, one called \u201cSecond Chance\u201d that gives him another chance at life after death.

    "notes": "<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>...I\u2019m...not even gonna say anything. I\u2019ll just leave all the author\u2019s notes to the next chapter. Goodbye I\u2019m done. *curls up into a ball of despair* So done.</p>\n<p>UPDATE (9/30/17): WHOO-WEEEE FINALLY UPDATED THIS 8,000 WORD MONSTROSITY YAY!! XD Let me know if you guys found any mistakes that I missed! :D</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t generally do A/Ns at the beginning of the chapter, but I felt like I needed to clarify something: Deku\u2019s Quirk \u201cSecond Chance\u201d sends him back to the place where he died, except now he\u2019s alive. It\u2019s almost like no time has passed. That\u2019s gonna be pretty obvious with this chapter, I know, but I felt like I had to say it before we begin so you guys aren\u2019t just like \u201cWait what the heck is going on.\u201d XD Anyways, that\u2019s all! Enjoy the chapter! :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This story was originally gonna be a one-shot, but then I hit nearly 30 pages (Arial, size 12 font on Google Docs if anyone cares) and decided to make it a two-shot instead, because 10,000+ words is a lot to read (and edit, oh my gosh) in one sitting. And I edited this chapter once all the way through, but once is hardly enough, so please excuse any errors you (probably) found. XD </p>\n<p>OH AND THIS IS IMPORTANT SO KEEP READING. If enough people are interested, I\u2019m considering writing a third chapter from the POV of Class 1-A/All Might/Aizawa during the Izuku-drowns-and-is-rescued scene, but only if enough people are interested. If I write it, I can promise it will be filled with lots of angst and hurt/comfort and Dad Might and Dad/Uncle Aizawa and Class Dynamics and Class Bonding and everything in between, so if you guys are interested, I\u2019ll write it! :) </p>\n<p>Be sure to let me know either way, though, because I don\u2019t want to waste my time writing something no one\u2019s interested in reading. XD </p>\n<p>Anyways, thank you all soooo much for reading! Like I said I\u2019ll add a third chapter to this story if you guys are interested, but for now, this story is finished! Thank you all so much for all your support! Hopefully I\u2019ll see y\u2019all around! :D </p>\n<p>Until next time, go beyond!! PLUS ULTRA!!</p>\n<p>You asked and I delivered! XD Here's everyone else's POV!! :D</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Can I just say that I was super overwhelmed and shocked (in a good way) by all the love and support this story got in such a short amount of time??? Like, thank you all so much??? I mean seriously you guys are so sweet and amazing and it makes me so happy to know that so many of you liked my story. SO THANK YOU!!!</p>\n<p>And I\u2019m sorry if this felt choppy at all. I had a lot of POVs to cover, soooo\u2026:/ Yeah. Oh, and you may or may not have noticed, but I didn\u2019t write Koda\u2019s POV, mainly because whenever I tried writing something in Koda\u2019s POV it just felt...OOC, which is NOT good. So...I\u2019m sorry. I love Koda, but I\u2019d rather not write a portion than to write a portion and butcher his character. :/</p>\n<p>Other than that, thank you all again!! It\u2019s funny, this chapter is longer than either of the previous ones. Go figure! XD Thank you all so much for your support! I hope you stick around to see what other stories I\u2019ve got under my sleeve! :) </p>\n<p>Thanks again! Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Yeah, so originally I was just gonna leave it at 3 chapters, but then I thought \u201cHey, how angsty would it be if I had the rest of 1-A figure out that their precious cinnamon roll classmate literally died?\u201d and lo and behold, I\u2019m back. </p>\n<p>BUT WAIT DON\u2019T LEAVE YET I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU GUYS. </p>\n<p>So, like last time, I decided to ask before I wrote it, because I didn\u2019t know if any of you would be interested, so here\u2019s my question: </p>\n<p>DO YOU WANT INKO (Izuku\u2019s mom even though I\u2019m sure you guys know that) TO FIND OUT ABOUT IZUKU\u2019S \u201cDEATH\u201d???</p>\n<p>AND I NEED TO KNOW OKAY? OR ELSE I\u2019LL JUST STOP THE STORY AT 4 CHAPTERS (A.K.A HERE). I THINK IT COULD BE REALLY SAD AND ANGSTY WITH LOTS OF MOM AND SON BONDING BUT ONLY IF YOU GUYS WANT THAT. </p>\n<p>Anyways, as usual, thanks for reading! Your support literally is what keeps me going sometimes! XD </p>\n<p>Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: So this is set in the timeline where Izuku ACTUALLY DIED. Just so everyone knows. :) </p>\n<p>So do you guys want some extra tears while reading? Head on over to YouTube and listen to \u201cIngenium\u201d from the newly-released Boku no Hero Season 2 OST on a loop. That was what I listened to while writing it, and let me tell you, I cried. So give it a try. You\u2019ll regret it as soon as the tears start flowing, but hey, clicking on this story meant you wanted angst, so why not?</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>WHOOPSYDAISY I DID A THING. </p>\n<p>And this chapter hasn\u2019t been edited yet so please excuse all my errors. I promise I\u2019ll go back and fix all of them eventually. It\u2019s just, 8,000 words is a lot to try and edit, and I wanted to post this for you guys while I have the time, soooo, yeah. Please ignore my errors for now. I\u2019ll fix \u2018em when I got the time. XD </p>\n<p>Another ridiculously long chapter I know, sorry guys. :/ But it\u2019s not MY FAULT there are so many characters in this show to go over! And you may or may not have noticed, but I didn\u2019t write a POV of everyone, just for my own reasons and writing troubles (with OOC-ness and whatever), but I DID have each student of 1-A write their own \u201cBox\u201d entry, which you probably also noticed. :)</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks soooooo much for all your amazing support! I think this story will have one more chapter (the promised chapter with Inko\u2019s reaction to Second Chance, along with some more Dadzawa because why not?), and then we\u2019re finished! Thank you all so much for all your continued support! It means the world to me! :D</p>\n<p>Until next time, go beyond! PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sorry for the long wait for an update y\u2019all! I\u2019ve been having some heart problems lately, and my mom had to rush me down to the ER on Saturday, which is usually my big write-all-day-write-all-night day, so I\u2019ve had to write in the evenings after school instead, but HEY I finished a chapter so cool!! </p>\n<p>And, unless you guys have any other ideas on where I could take this story, I believe it\u2019s officially...OVER. Yep, that\u2019s right! This story\u2019s over! (Unless, like I said, you guys have suggestions for other chapters.) </p>\n<p>I just want to say, thank you all SOOO much for all your support on this story! I never expected so many people to enjoy it when I started posting, so to hear that so many people loved it just...it makes me so happy. I love you all so much. I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful week and an even more wonderful life. I love you guys sooooo much and I can\u2019t thank you enough for all your encouragements. </p>\n<p>If you guys like angst/hurt/comfort/sadness, you can check out some of my other BNHA stories! I\u2019ve got a few I\u2019m working on, and even more I\u2019m planning on writing in the future, so, yeah! Hopefully you guys enjoy those! :) </p>\n<p>Well, if you guys have any ideas for any other chapters for this story, leave the suggestion in the comments, okay? Otherwise, this story\u2019s officially finished! :) </p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks again for everything! Until next time, go beyond! *punches the sky* PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>\n<p>Hey! So!! I never thought I would go back to this but here I am! I found an old draft for this chapter and I liked the concept so I went ahead and revised/completed it!</p>\n<p>My beta hasn't had the chance to look at this yet, so I'll fix all the errors a little later on. Hope you enjoy the FINAL final installment of this fic! :) </p>\n<p>*SET AFTER THE EVENTS OF the FIC</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Gotta say, this was largely inspired from a prompt I got on tumblr where Izuku sees the other timeline sometimes even now. I'd already had that thought in part, where he revisits it in his dreams, but I dropped the idea until that prompt came in, so thank you so much for that!!</p>\n<p>I know I've said it before but thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the story! \\o/</p>",
    "text": "\nIzuku was drowning. \n\n\nThe water was everywhere. Cold and unforgiving, it rushed around him, pushing him further down the depths, and no matter how many times he tried, he couldn\u2019t resurface. \n\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t breathe. He kicked desperately, but to no avail; his limbs felt heavier than usual, and his head was full of fog. His lungs had taken in water. His eyes stung. His chest burned. \n\n\nThere were chains wrapped around his throat and chest. Not metaphorically, but \n\nreal, metal chains, \n\nand no matter how much he clawed at them, he just couldn\u2019t get them off. His fingers were numb, and any train of thought he may have had had been derailed long ago. \n\n\n\nI-I can\u2019t\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u2014can\u2019t breathe\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u2014c-can\u2019t...breathe\u2014!\n\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t move. The rivers up here in the mountains were unforgiving in every way possible, the water strong, cold, and almost impossibly deep.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCold...it\u2019s too cold\u2026 !\n\n\n\n\nDangit, dangit, dangit\u2026.! \n\nhe mentally shrieked, gritting his teeth and yanking hard at the chains again, but his limbs wouldn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t) respond to his commands anymore. He was being dragged under by whatever villain had attacked him, further and further away from the surface, and there wasn\u2019t a single thing he could do about it. \n\n\nOn instinct, he sucked in a deep breath\u2014of water, unfortunately. Bad idea. He choked a desperate sob\u2014even though it was more like a cough than a sob\u2014and kicked his feet helplessly. \n\n\n\nI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe\u2014!\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s pointless. \n\n\n\nThe thought came so suddenly and out-of-nowhere that, for a moment, he froze. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s pointless now. \n\n\n\nAnd then, Izuku kicked again, struggling against the chains. \n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s too late. \n\n\n\nIzuku gritted his teeth. Black began flooding his vision, and he could \n\nfeel \n\nhis consciousness waning, could \n\nfeel \n\nan inescapable black closing in on him, and no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn\u2019t shake it. Couldn\u2019t \n\nescape \n\nit. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s pointless. \n\n\n\n\nGive up. \n\n\n\n\nC\u2019mon, just give up already. \n\n\n\n\nWon\u2019t it be easier once you\u2019re dead? \n\n\n\n\nStop fighting. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s too late. \n\n\n\n\nGive up. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s pointless. \n\n\n\n\nNo one\u2019d miss you anyway. \n\n\n\nHis chest tightened. His vision darkened. The words were as inescapable as the water, and he couldn\u2019t ignore them. \n\n\n\nI wonder\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...This\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...This is\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...The end, right\u2026? \n\n\n\nHis body went limp, and he released the chains around his throat, which tightened again immediately. His lungs burned; the icy water felt like hundreds of tiny daggers against his skin. \n\n\n\n...Would\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Would anyone even care\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...If I suddenly wasn\u2019t here anymore\u2026?\n\n\n\nHis eyes drifted shut, tears of frustration and hopelessness mingling with the saltwater. \n\n\n\nI...\n\n\n\nBlack finally grabbed hold of him and dragged him under. \n\n\n\n...don\u2019t know anymore...\n\n\n\nA sudden jolt shocked him awake, and Izuku shot upright, gasping heavily, both hands against his throat. His chest ached horribly, but not as horribly as a few seconds ago, and he could breathe, which was new. His clothes were dry, too, which logically shouldn\u2019t be right, considering he\u2019d been \n\nunderwater \n\njust a few seconds ago.\n\n\nWhen he found his bearings, he rose to his feet shakily and took in his surroundings. Around him was an endless landscape of pure, solid \n\nwhite. \n\nThere was white above him, white below him, and white surrounding him on all sides. No matter where he looked, it was all white, and nothing else. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s...that\u2019s weird\u2026\n\n\n\nThere was no door. No entrance. No exit. Just white. He couldn\u2019t tell floor from ceiling. It was like he was suspended in mid-air, but the white felt somehow \n\nfirm \n\nbeneath his feet. \n\n\n\n...Where am I?\n\n\n\nHe stared at the white for a long, long time, trying (and failing) to make sense of it. \n\n\nAnd then, a sudden sinking feeling overwhelmed him, and his eyes widened in horror. \n\n\n\u201c...I\u2019m dead,\u201d he realized, something in his stomach churning. \u201cI-I\u2019m...I\u2019m \n\ndead.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYep, sounds about right. But it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku whirled around towards the voice. \n\n\nAcross from him, in the white nothingness, stood a young boy. A young boy with bright green hair, bright green eyes, face sprinkled with freckles, and scars along the length of his arm. \n\n\nIzuku took a step back in shock, his breath catching in his throat. \n\n\nHe felt like he was looking straight into a mirror. This boy...was another \n\nhim. \n\nThere was no doubt about it. Absolutely \n\nno doubt. \n\nAside from their mirrored appearances, they were wearing the same clothes, too (the second model of Izuku\u2019s hero costume). The only thing that was \n\ndifferent \n\nwas the look on their faces. While Izuku looked the pure definition of \u201chorrified,\u201d this other him looked...\n\nconfident, \n\nmore \n\nsnide, \n\nand he was smirking, almost fiendishly. \n\n\n\u201c...W-Who are you?\u201d Izuku asked sharply. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \n\n\nThe other him (but still \n\nnot \n\nhim) shrugged. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said breezily, \u201cbut that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to explain things. It\u2019s...kinda tricky, though.\u201d Him-But-Not-Him rubbed the back of his neck idly, \u201cso, hear me out, \u2018kay?\u201d \u00a0\n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly, but he didn\u2019t exactly \n\nnot \n\nwant to know what was going on, so he just nodded shakily. \n\n\nNot-Him clapped his hands together cheerfully, like he\u2019d been waiting for this moment his entire life. \u201cAnyways, let\u2019s start from the beginning,\u201d chirped Not-Him. \u201cThe \n\nvery, VERY \n\nbeginning. To start things off\u2014and I\u2019m just gonna be blunt here\u2014you\u2019re not as Quirkless as you thought you were.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku only blinked at him. \u201c...W-What are you talking about?\u201d he asked, suddenly very confused. \u201cB-But...no, that\u2019s not right. I was born Quirkless. The pinky joint, I-I have two of them\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWell, your Quirk isn\u2019t exactly a \n\nphysical \n\nability\u2014\u201d (Not-Him made quotation marks with his fingers), \u201c\u2014so it makes sense why your body wouldn\u2019t be physically affected by it. Your Quirk is probably the rarest out there, actually, a Quirk that comes around every couple centuries by complete chance. It can\u2019t be passed down through generations, either. It just sort of\u2026\u201d Not-Him gestured at nothing with his hands for a moment or two, \n\n\u201c...Exists. \n\nYep, that\u2019s it!\u201d\n\n\nIzuku bit his lip. \n\n\nNot-Him swung around, pointing a finger at Izuku proudly. \u201cYour Quirk is called Second Chance!\u201d proclaimed Not-Him with a wide grin. \u201cWhen you die, you can be revived only once by this Quirk. Sort of like a power-up in Super Mario. Nothing \n\nreally \n\nchanges except that you don\u2019t die the next time you run into a bad guy.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cS-So...you mean\u2026\u201d Izuku looked around at the white nothingness, then met eyes with his double again. \u201cI-I\u2019m...I\u2019m actually dead.\u201d \n\n\nNot-Him frowned suddenly, lowering his arm and cocking his head. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Not-Him said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I just said, right?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku took in a long, shuddering breath. He was dead. He was \n\nliterally dead. \n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t Quirkless, either. These were both ground-breaking realizations (the former much more so than the latter), and it was a lot to try and take in all at once. \n\n\nNot-Him sighed heavily and shrugged. \u201c...Well, you can go back now, y\u2019know, to the land of the living or whatever,\u201d said Not-Him idly. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re \n\ndead, \n\nbut your Quirk gives you another go at life.\u201d \n\n\nThis was a lot. A \n\nlot. \n\nBut Izuku didn\u2019t really have any reason to \n\nnot \n\ngo back (he was dead, anyways), so he only swallowed thickly and nodded to his double. \n\n\nNot-Him grinned again. \u201cAlright!\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll send you back to your body! Oh, but wait\u2026\u201d He frowned suddenly, touching his chin with a gloved hand. \u201cThere\u2019s a side-effect of the Quirk,\u201d he said, more to himself than anything. \u201cOhhh boy, I probably should have started with this\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cW-Wait, what kind of side-effect?\u201d Izuku asked urgently. \n\n\nNot-Him looked at him and shook his head. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d \n\nlove\n\n to tell you, we\u2019re out of time here,\u201d he said, glancing down at his wrist at an imaginary watch, \u201cso it looks like you\u2019ll just have to find out on your own.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cW-Wait a second!\u201d Izuku shouted, reaching out, but then, a crack broke the white, like some unfortunate kid had hit a window with a baseball. The cracks spread like a spider\u2019s web until, finally, the world around him shattered. \n\n\nIt just...\n\nshattered, \n\nlike glass. \n\n\nIzuku put his arms up in front of his face to shield himself, but the white shards vanished as soon as they broke apart. There was a clatter and a crack, like a bolt of lightning, and then, silence. Complete, total, overwhelming \n\nsilence. \n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t dare move for the longest time. \n\n\nAnd then, Izuku lowered his arms and opened his eyes. Not-Him and the white room of nothingness was gone, replaced by a gray, cold, gloomy atmosphere. Rain fell from dark clouds overhead, and the grass was wet beneath his feet. \n\n\n\u201cW-What just happened\u2026?\u201d Izuku murmured to himself, looking around and trying to determine just where he was. \n\n\nAnd then, he noticed a group of people, dressed in black, standing just a little ways away. They were too far away for him to tell whether or not he knew them, but close enough for him to determine that it was a large group, made up of maybe twenty-some people. \n\n\nIzuku watched for yet another moment, not quite knowing what to do. \n\n\nAnd then, he took a step forward. \n\n\nThen another. \n\n\nAnd another. \n\n\nAnd another. \n\n\nEverything felt surreal, like something out of a dream, but also strangely \n\nreal\n\n. The wet grass sank with his footsteps. He felt the chill of the air, the drops of rainwater against his head.\n\n\nReal, but not real both at once. He didn\u2019t know how to describe it, really. \n\n\nHe kept walking. \n\n\nNot-Him\u2019s words bounced around in his head, but Izuku didn\u2019t really know what to make of them. Side-effect? \n\nWhat \n\nside-effect? Was \n\nthis \n\nthe side-effect, or was he back? And if he \n\nwas\n\n back, why \n\nhere\n\n and not where he\u2019d \u201cdied\u201d? \n\n\nWhen he got close enough to the figures clad in black, he realized with a start that he recognized every single person in the group. The majority of them were made up of his classmates, all nineteen of them, but his mom was there, too, and so was All Might, and Aizawa, and his other teachers at U.A. \n\n\nAnd they were all wearing black. Dark, solid black. Though it was raining, no one held an umbrella. \n\n\nIzuku spotted Ochako in the crowd, staring onwards at something he couldn\u2019t see, and he sprinted towards her urgently. \u201cUraraka!\u201d he called, his feet pounding against the wet grass. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\nOchako didn\u2019t answer. Her head was bowed, hands fisting the hem of her black dress, brown hair behind her head in a very stiff bun. Tears glistened in her eyes and streamed down her face, and Izuku swallowed thickly, a sharp pain stabbing his chest. \n\n\n\u201cUraraka, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, feeling more frantic and helpless by the moment. \u201cUraraka, hey...\u201d \n\n\nShe still didn\u2019t look at him, staring ahead with teary eyes. Finally, although he didn\u2019t want to, he followed her gaze.\n\n\nHe froze, his eyes going wide. \u00a0\n\n\nThere was a coffin. A black, wooden coffin, the top covered in white flowers. And at the edge of the coffin was a single ornate frame, encasing a picture. \n\n\nA picture of \n\nhim. \n\n\n\nA recent picture of himself, judging by the scars on his hand. In the photo, he was beaming brightly, making a peace sign with two fingers. He couldn\u2019t actually remember taking the picture, not that it mattered. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Dead? \n\n\n\n(A small part of his mind added \u201cstill,\u201d but he ignored this.)\n\n\n\u201cUraraka, I\u2019m fine!\u201d Izuku said loudly, spinning around to face her again. She didn\u2019t look at him, her tears joining the rain as they splashed against the ground at her feet. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Uraraka! Everyone! I\u2019m \n\nright here!\u201d\n\n\n\nHe reached out to touch her shoulder. \n\n\nBut his hand went straight through her, like he was some kind of a ghost. \n\n\nHe gasped and withdrew his hand like he\u2019d been burned, clutching his wrist. \n\nWhat the\u2026? \n\nHe looked up. Ochako kept the same posture, only now, her tears were beginning to increase. \n\n\n\u201cUraraka,\u201d Izuku tried again, but his words still garnered no reaction. \n\n\n\nShe can\u2019t...she can\u2019t \n\nsee \n\nme? \n\n\n\nHe looked around. Now that he thought about it, \n\nno one\n\n had acknowledged his presence. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWait, so...\n\nno one \n\ncan see me? \n\n\n\nAfter a long, long time, Aizawa stepped forward. Izuku couldn\u2019t see his face, but his homeroom teacher\u2019s voice was uncharacteristically hoarse when he spoke. \n\n\n\u201cIzuku Midoriya...a student of U.A., Class 1-A, first year,\u201d Aizawa said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...that this happened to one so young.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWait, no!\u201d Izuku shouted, racing forward. \u201cI\u2019m alive! I\u2019m here, \n\nI\u2019m okay!!\u201d \n\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t stand this. He couldn\u2019t stand seeing everyone so down, so \n\nupset, \n\nespecially when he was \n\nalive,\n\n when he was literally \n\nright in front of them. \n\n\n\nBut his shouts changed nothing, and one by one, his eyes scanned the crowd: \n\n\nIida, his teeth gritted tightly. \n\n\nTokoyami, Dark Shadow hovering over his head sorrowfully. \n\n\nTodoroki, staring like he couldn\u2019t comprehend what he was seeing, his balled fists trembling at his sides. \n\n\nYaoyorozu, trying in vain to comfort a sobbing Mina while trying to keep her own composure intact. \n\n\nKirishima, tears rolling down his face. \n\n\nKaminari, squeezing his eyes shut to try and hold back his own tears (to no avail) while Jiro did the same (also to no avail). His arm was wrapped around her trembling shoulders. \n\n\nSero was staring at the ground, his expression unreadable. \n\n\nShoji was using one of his wing-like appendages as an umbrella for Mineta, who was openly sobbing and rubbing his face with his hands constantly. Shoji wasn\u2019t much different. \u00a0\n\n\nSato and Koda stood side-by-side, trembling. \n\n\nOchako\u2019s tears never once slowed. \n\n\nAoyama looked uncharacteristically mournful, biting his lip while tears glistened in his eyes. \n\n\nBakug\u014d stared ahead, his teeth gritted tightly and hands balled into shaking fists. He looked angry, as per usual, but Izuku had known him long enough to tell that it wasn\u2019t anger, but rather...regret. \n\n\nTsuyu\u2019s expression was unreadable, but tears rolled off her cheeks. \n\n\nOjiro\u2019s shoulders shook. \n\n\nHagakure was as invisible as always, but Izuku could hear her choked sobs. \n\n\nAizawa\u2019s expression was flat. If Izuku didn\u2019t know any better, he would\u2019ve said that there was no emotion on his teacher\u2019s face at all. But Izuku, of course, knew better. \n\n\nHis mother...Izuku\u2019s mother was...\n\nbroken. \n\nHe\u2019d never seen her like this before, sobbing so openly with her head buried in her hands, her entire body trembling. His breath caught in his throat, and he wanted \n\nso badly \n\nto reach out and do \n\nsomething, \n\nbut when he tried, his fingers went right through her, just like they had with Ochako. \n\n\nHis presence...\n\nwasn\u2019t there. \n\n\n\nAnd All Might. He was there, too, and he wasn\u2019t smiling. Actually, Izuku couldn\u2019t recall a time when his mentor had looked more...\n\ndistraught. \n\nIt was alarming, actually. Really, truly alarming. \n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Izuku whispered, feeling tears burn his own eyes. \u201cY-You guys...please...stop this\u2026\u201d \n\n\nNothing changed. \n\nNothing. \n\n\n\n\u201cP-Please...d-don\u2019t...\u201d Izuku choked. \n\n\nHe reached out and touched Ochako\u2019s shoulder one final time, just in case something had changed, but this time, when he touched her, the spot where his fingers had reached cracked, just like earlier in the white nothingness. The cracks spread throughout the scene, and a moment later, the world shattered. \n\n\nIzuku put up his arms again out of habit, but as before, the shards vanished immediately, and at length, Izuku lowered his guard. The funeral scene was gone, and now, he was standing in his classroom at U.A. Sunlight streamed through open windows, and nineteen of twenty seats were taken by his classmates. \n\n\nThe only person missing from this picture was Izuku. \n\n\n\u201cH-Hello?\u201d he tried again, but as before, nothing changed. He was still invisible to them; they couldn\u2019t hear him nor could they see him, and while he \n\ncould\n\n hear and see them, he couldn\u2019t interact with them. \n\n\nThe classroom\u2019s door slammed opened, and Aizawa walked inside. The students didn\u2019t look up at him, didn\u2019t say a word, just continued staring down at their desks, at their hands, \n\nanywhere \n\nbut at their teacher. \n\n\nAizawa turned, faced the room, and didn\u2019t say anything for a long, long time. \n\n\n\u201c...There are a few things we\u2019re going to go over before we start your regular classes,\u201d he said with forced professionalism. \u201cNow, if you\u2014\u201d \n\n\nOchako suddenly pushed back her chair and got to her feet, her hands planted firmly against her desk. Instantly, all eyes in the room were on her\u2014Izuku\u2019s eyes included\u2014and she looked up at Aizawa, her expression unreadable. \n\n\n\u201cC-Can I go to the nurse\u2019s office?\u201d she asked. \u201cI-I...I have a headache.\u201d \n\n\nAizawa paused, then nodded, already scrawling out a hall pass. She made her way to the front of the class, and he quickly slipped her the piece of paper. \u201cGive this to the old lady once you get there, alright?\u201d \n\n\nOchako nodded shakily and left the classroom, closing the door softly behind her. Izuku swallowed thickly, waited a beat, then hurried forward to follow her. \n\n\nShe\u2019d closed the door behind her, and when he reached out and tried grasping the handle, his hand went through it, just as it had with everything else. He blinked, hesitated, then walked straight through it. In an instant, he was in the hallway, Ochako walking in the opposite direction. \n\n\nHe took a breath, steeled himself, and followed her. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019s not heading for the nurse\u2019s office, \n\nIzuku realized. He\u2019d been in Recovery Girl\u2019s office enough times to know exactly how to get to it. \n\nShe\u2019s going in the opposite direction...\n\n\n\nOchako started out slow, maintaining a steady pace. \n\n\nAnd then, that slow, steady pace became a brisk walk, and then, that brisk walk became a jog, and Izuku hurried after her. \n\n\n\nIf she\u2019s not going to the nurse\u2019s office\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Then where? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo one else was around. The halls were silent, the rest of the U.A. students in their classrooms where they belonged as Ochako ran, Izuku struggling to keep up with her, worry eating away at him. \n\n\nFinally, at long last, Ochako stopped in the middle of a dimly lit hallway all the way on the other side of the school. Izuku stopped a few feet behind her, breathing heavily, trying to get his breath back. \n\n\n\u201cUraraka,\u201d he panted, but she couldn\u2019t hear him, and he hadn\u2019t been expecting her to. \n\n\nDespite her sprint, Ochako didn\u2019t seem winded whatsoever. She stood in the shadowy hallway, stiff as a board, and Izuku watched her, wanting to say something and being helpless to do so. \n\n\nAnd then, Ochako let out a choked sob and buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders trembled, and she stumbled to the side, hitting the wall back-first before sinking to the floor, wrapping her arms around her knees and burying her face against them. \n\n\nShe was sobbing. Openly, completely sobbing. Hard. The sounds were guttural, and Izuku wanted nothing more than to reach out, to put his hand on her shoulder, but he knew that wouldn\u2019t work. He knew there was \n\nnothing \n\nhe could do. \n\n\n\u201cUraraka\u2026\u201d Izuku said stupidly, his chest aching. He wasn\u2019t quite sure \n\nwhy, \n\nbut this...hurt. A lot. \u201cUraraka, d-don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUraraka.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku spun around; there stood Iida, looking at Ochako with a pained look in his eyes. Ochako lifted her tear-stained face to stare at him, her breaths shuddering in her throat. \n\n\n\u201cI-I-Iida,\u201d she choked brokenly, rubbing her eyes with her forearm. \u201cI-I-I\u2019m s-s-sorry, I-I just\u2026\u201d \n\n\nIida swallowed thickly, and then, he held out his arms towards her. She looked at him for a moment or two, and then, she kicked off the ground and leapt into his embrace, her tears falling with fresh vigor. \n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it, Iida!\u201d \n\nOchako sobbed and screamed both at once, her shoulders shaking even harder. \n\n\u201cI c-c-can\u2019t do it! \n\nE-Every t-time...e-every time I l-look around, I-I just...I c-can\u2019t...\n\nI c-c-can\u2019t\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\nIida took in a long, shuddering breath. \u201cI...I know.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI want him \n\nback!\u201d \n\nOchako screamed, burying her face in her friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI WANT HIM \n\nBACK, \n\nIIDA!! I...I j-just...I-I just...w-want my friend b-back\u2026\u201d \n\n\nIida swallowed again, his arms tightening around her. \u201cI know,\u201d he said thickly, fighting to keep his composure intact (and he failed miserably). \u201cI know. I...I want him back, too.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku took one step backwards, then another. This wasn\u2019t right. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t right. \n\nSeeing Ochako like this, seeing Iida like this, it was \n\nwrong. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to see them like this. They were his friends, his \n\nclosest \n\nfriends, and...and\u2026\n\n\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Izuku whispered, but nothing changed. \n\n\nThe world shattered around him again. Izuku was used to it by now, so he didn\u2019t even bother shielding himself. This time, the shards gave way to a dark room; the boys\u2019 locker room, Izuku realized, the windows closed and the lights turned off. \n\n\nIn the room stood a single person: Bakug\u014d, all alone, sparks crackling on his palms. \n\n\n\u201cKacchan?\u201d Izuku whispered, not expecting an answer. \u201cW-What\u2026?\u201d \n\n\nThere was a beat. \n\n\nAnd then, Bakug\u014d swore loudly and swung around, punching the wall; an explosion erupted from his palm. \n\n\n\n\u201cSTUPID DEKU!!\u201d \n\nBakug\u014d yelled through gritted teeth, punching the wall again, then again, and then again. \n\n\u201cWHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT!? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST...\n\nLEAVE\n\n LIKE THAT!?\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku could only watch, horrified. \u201cK-Kacchan,\u201d he choked again, but he knew by now that words did absolutely nothing. \n\n\n\n\u201cGRAAAH!!\u201d \n\nBakug\u014d screeched, punching the wall once more. \n\n\u201cYOU IDIOT! YOU FRICKIN\u2019 \n\nIDIOT, \n\nDEKU!! WHAT THE HELL MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN GO DYING ON EVERYONE LIKE THAT, HUH!?\u201d \n\n\n\nOne explosion after the other fired from his palms, and Izuku could do nothing\u2014\n\nnothing\n\n\u2014but watch. \n\n\nAnd it hurt. A lot. \n\n\nBakug\u014d gave the wall one final punch, and then, he sank to his knees, resting his forehead against the charred wall of the locker room. His breaths came in raggedly, and something that probably wasn\u2019t sweat rolled down his face. \n\n\nBefore Izuku could react, though the world shattered once more, and a new scene played. \n\n\n\u201c...It\u2019s quiet in here,\u201d Kaminari murmured, \u201cwithout Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\nHe was in Class 1-A again, only now, the only students there were Kaminari, Sero, Ojiro, Kirishima, Tsuyu, Shoji, Koda, Sato, Aoyama and Mineta. Izuku didn\u2019t know where the rest of his classmates were, and he didn\u2019t really have the resources to find out, either. \n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Kirishima quietly, a former shell of his usual flamboyant self. The entire classroom was encased with a tangible sorrow, and the tension was so thick it\u2019d take a chainsaw to cut through it. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s really, really weird...without Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\nThere was a pause of uncomfortable silence. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya sure was insane,\u201d Sero breathed, leaning back in his chair and staring up at the ceiling. \u201cDo you guys remember the USJ?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen Shigaraki and those guys attacked?\u201d Sato said, though he didn\u2019t need the confirmation. \u201cYeah, I remember...I wasn\u2019t there to see what Midoriya did, but you guys told me the basic gist of what happened.\u201d \n\n\nTsuyu, looking uncharacteristically downhearted, stared at her desk like it\u2019d betrayed her somehow. \u201cHe saved us when we were about to get crushed by Shigaraki\u2019s monster,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhile he didn\u2019t actually take down the monster, he bought just enough time for All Might to get there.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\nMineta nodded fervently in agreement. \u201cMidoriya was so cool!\u201d Mineta said, punching the air as tears glistened in his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cAnd not \n\njust \n\nthat,\u201d said Shoji, \u201cbut, out of all of us here...I believe he was the most heroic.\u201d \n\n\nThe rest of the present students nodded solemnly. Not one person said otherwise. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Ojiro quietly. \u201cI mean, it takes a lot...to lay down your life for your friends. It...it really takes a special kind of person.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was amazing,\u201d said Aoyama, leaning his elbows on the table and resting his face on his hands. \n\n\n\u201cYeah, he really was something special,\u201d said Kaminari, his breath catching in his throat. \u201cI just...thinking about it, I-I mean\u2026\u201d Kaminari\u2019s voice broke, and he slapped his palm to his forehead. \u201cD-Dangit, man, this \n\nsucks,\u201d \n\nhe ground out through gritted teeth. \u201cThis r-really \n\nsucks.\u201d \n\n\n\nTsuyu closed her eyes and looked away; Kirishima leaned his head back, squeezing his eyes shut tightly; Sero mumbled something about the nurse\u2019s office and sprinted out of the room; Ojiro\u2019s posture remained the same, but his teeth were clenched; Koda didn\u2019t say anything, but he was crying silently; Shoji stood abruptly and followed Sero; Aoyama didn\u2019t move, but something flickered in his eyes, like sorrow, and Mineta face-planted the table with a muffled scream. \n\n\n\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Izuku whispered. \n\n\nThe world shattered yet again, and this time, Izuku was outdoors, standing on a grassy hilltop as the sun set beyond the horizon. A gentle but crisp breeze swept through the countryside. \n\nTodoroki stood across from him, staring at a stone monument. Carved into the gray stone, words read In Loving Memory: Izuku Midoriya, 15. You Live On in Our Hearts, and Izuku swallowed thickly before shifting his gaze back to Todoroki. ,\n\nTodoroki stood silently for a long while, staring intently at the grave.\n\n\nAnd then, he finally spoke. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201c...It...It feels pretty messed up, being here,\u201d Todoroki began, his voice low. \u201cI\u2019m...not very good with sentiment, so...I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll just get to my point.\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki took a deep breath and shut his eyes momentarily. \n\n\n\u201c...Thank you, Midoriya,\u201d he said. \u201cI...I don\u2019t think I ever had the opportunity to tell you, but thank you. What you did for me, during the Sports Festival...you changed the way I viewed the world, and how I viewed myself. If it wasn\u2019t for you...honestly...it terrifies me, to think of the person I might\u2019ve become.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\nTodoroki looked down at his shoes for a moment or two. \n\n\n\u201c...So...thank you,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cThanks, for everything, Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\n\nTodoroki\u2026 \n\nIzuku swallowed, then took in a deep, shaky breath. He didn\u2019t want this. He didn\u2019t want to see his friends like this, and he wanted to \n\ndo something, \n\nto \n\nsay something, so badly\u2026\n\n\n\nThere were footsteps a little ways off, followed by a voice. \u201cTodoroki?\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki turned, as did Izuku; Yaoyorozu stared at the only classmate she could see, a small bouquet of white flowers held between her hands. \n\n\n\u201cYaoyorozu,\u201d Todoroki greeted formally over his shoulder. He then turned back to the grave, and Yaoyorozu moved to stand beside him. \n\n\nThere was a long beat, the silence broken only by the sound of the wind as it rustled the grass. \n\n\n\u201c...If I\u2019m completely honest, I\u2019m...having a hard time grasping the reality,\u201d Yaoyorozu began quietly, casting her gaze upwards towards the orange-yellow sky. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very close to Midoriya, but...he was still a classmate. A friend. Someone I could trust. And...him just not \n\nbeing \n\nhere...it doesn\u2019t even seem \n\nreal.\u201d \n\n\n\nTodoroki exhaled sharply through his nose and nodded. \u201c...I know what you mean,\u201d he said. \u201cMidoriya...he was a great friend, an amazing friend, and...I guess...I haven\u2019t really grasped the reality of this, either.\u201d \n\n\nYaoyorozu bit her lip, then stepped forward, kneeling at the grave and setting the flowers gently before it. She didn\u2019t make a move to get up after that, settling her hands on her lap. \n\n\n\u201c...I could have done something,\u201d she said, her hands balling into fists against her legs. \u201cI could...I could have done \n\nsomething, \n\nbut...\n\nbut\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nTears splashed against her knuckles, and she shook her head. \n\n\n\u201cI could have done something,\u201d she repeated harshly. \u201cSomething, \n\nanything...\n\nI could\u2019ve...\n\nI could\u2019ve\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nShe ducked her head, her shoulders hunched. \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re \n\nheroes,\u201d \n\nshe said, her voice remaining steady even as her hands shook. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be \n\nheroes, \n\nand I...I couldn\u2019t do \n\nanything, \n\nwhen it came down to it. I couldn\u2019t even save my own \n\nclassmate \n\nwho was \n\nright in front of me, \n\nhow could I \n\npossibly \n\nhope to save anyone else?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not your fault!\u201d Izuku shouted, rushing forward even though he knew his presence didn\u2019t make a difference here. \u201cTodoroki, tell her! Tell her it wasn\u2019t her fault! \n\nTodoroki\u2014!\u201d \n\n\n\nHe whirled around to face his friend, then froze, the words dying in the back of his throat. \n\n\nA single tear cascaded down Todoroki\u2019s face, dripped off his chin, and splashed into the grass below. \n\n\n\u201c...I know,\u201d Todoroki murmured, casting his gaze downwards. \u201c...I feel the same way.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku took in a deep, shuddering breath, shaking his head feverishly. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, racing forward. \u201cNo, no, \n\nno! \n\nTodoroki, it wasn\u2019t\n\n\u2014it wasn\u2019t\u2014!\u201d \n\nHe reached out, trying to grasp Todoroki\u2019s shoulders and \n\nshake \n\nhim, because \n\nno, no, no, it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, \n\nbut of course, his hands went straight through Todoroki, just as they had with everyone else. \n\n\nHe hated this. He hated not being able to stop this...this \n\nwhatever \n\nit was. He felt helpless, useless, \n\npowerless, \n\nand everything in between. \n\n\nBefore he even registered what had happened, the scene shifted, and he wasn\u2019t in the U.A. anymore, but rather in his own home, more specifically the small little dining area in the kitchen. \n\n\nHe saw his mother working, stirring a pot of something over the stovetop. \n\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d Izuku called out of habit, and then remembered\u2014not for the first time and probably not for the last\u2014that she couldn\u2019t hear him. After that, he just watched, completely silent, as she continued preparing what he assumed was dinner. \n\n\nIzuku felt overwhelmed, not just by the knowledge that he was actually \n\ndead \n\nand \n\nnot \n\nQuirkless, but also with everything else he\u2019d seen today. His friends, in pain, crying, hurt, blaming themselves...it was hard. It was really hard, and he wanted it to stop, \n\nright now, \n\nbefore it got any worse. \n\n\nHis mother reached over and grabbed two plates from the cupboard. \n\n\nShe set the table for two. \n\n\nShe dished up two servings of katsudon. \n\n\nTwo. Just like always. \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly. \n\n\nHer eyes were rimmed red, and there were dark, bruise-like shadows beneath them. She was dishevelled, more dishevelled than Izuku had ever seen her, and he bit his lip, wanting, \n\nlonging, \n\nto do something. \n\n\nShe sat down. The chair across from her remained empty. She stared at this empty space for a long time, her eyes exhausted, her shoulders slumped. \n\n\nAnd then, she started crying. It wasn\u2019t the first time Izuku had seen his mother cry, but it was the first time he\u2019d seen her this \n\nbroken. \n\n\n\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m s-sorry, Izuku!\u201d she cried between heart-wrenching sobs, burying her face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m s-s-s-sorry, I\u2019m sorry, \n\nI-I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\n Her voice broke off as her sobs grew more ardent, more gut-wrenching, and Izuku felt vaguely like he was being stabbed repeatedly in the heart. \n\n\n\u201cN-No, i-it\u2019s okay, Mom,\u201d Izuku choked, his own eyes burning. \u201cI-It\u2019s okay, d-don\u2019t cry\u2026\u201d \n\n\nBut his words had no effect. All he could do was stand there, unable to say anything or do anything, wishing the scene would just \n\nshatter \n\nalready, because he couldn\u2019t stand seeing his mother like this, so \n\nbroken \n\nand \n\nhurt. \n\n\n\nThe scene didn\u2019t shatter nearly fast enough, but it did indeed shatter, and Izuku was back at the U.A., beams of bright sunlight streaming through windows that lined the long hallway.\n\n\n Jiro was striding down said hallway, her face stoic. She was walking briskly, with purpose, her fists clenched and swaying at her sides with every step. \n\n\nIzuku opened his mouth to call out to her, stopped, remembered, and then settled for following her instead. She didn\u2019t seem to be \n\ngoing \n\nanywhere in particular; just walking, walking, with her eyes staring straight ahead at nothing, her posture stiff, almost like a robot. \n\n\n\u201cJiro!\u201d \n\n\nJiro froze and spun around, anger taking place of her previous stoic expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped; Tokoyami, Mina, and Hagakure stopped dead in their tracks, a mere five feet away from her. \n\n\n\u201cJiro\u2026\u201d Hagakure began, taking another step forward. \u201cA-Are...are you okay?\u201d \n\n\nJiro snapped her teeth together with an audible click. \u201cDo you really think \n\nany \n\nof us are okay right now?\u201d she snarled, and Hagakure jumped, retracing her step. \n\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagakure stammered, twisting her shoe into the ground. \u201cT-That was a stupid question\u2026but, Jiro...you\u2019re...you\u2019re taking this super hard, and...we\u2019re...we\u2019re worried about you.\u201d \n\n\nMina nodded fervently; Tokoyami gave one, curt nod in his own agreement. \n\n\nIzuku\u2019s gaze shifted to Jiro. \n\nWhy would she\u2026? \n\n\n\nOh. \n\n\n\nOh. \n\n\n\nNow he remembered. His memories of what had happened leaving up to his \u201cdeath\u201d were hazy at points, but now, something became obvious to him. He realized. He remembered. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Jiro spat. \n\n\nTokoyami, Hagakure, and Mina only stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d Mina ventured. \u201cW-What do you mean it\u2019s your fault? I-It\u2019s not your fault, Jiro.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is my fault!\u201d Jiro exploded. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault Midoriya\u2019s de\u2026!\u201d She stopped short, her entire body going rigid. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d she repeated, calming down considerably (though not entirely). \n\nMina shook her head frantically. \u201cN-No it\u2019s not!\u201d Mina argued, surging forward. \u201cJiro, don\u2019t say that! It\u2019s not your fault! It \n\ncan\u2019t \n\nbe your fault!\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt \n\nis!\u201d \n\nJiro yelled, her fury returning in an instant. \n\n\u201cI \n\nwas the one who was supposed to be on look-out! \n\nMe! \n\nNot anyone else, \n\nme!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t hear it from under the water!\u201d Mina countered. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes, it \n\nis!\u201d \n\nJiro shouted again, more furious than Izuku had ever seen her before. \u201cNot only did I not notice the villain, but\u2026!\u201d \n\n\nShe stopped mid-rant and lowered her head, her fists shaking with a combination of anger, regret, and sorrow. \n\n\n\u201c...The villain was aiming for \n\nme!\u201d \n\nJiro screeched finally. \u201cIt was trying to grab \n\nme \n\nand drag \n\nme \n\nunderwater, but Midoriya noticed it, and\u2014\u201d \n\n\nAnd she stopped again, her voice cracking. \n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Jiro murmured, suddenly very quiet. \n\n\u201cWhy? \n\nNo matter what...no matter how dangerous it is...even when he knows...even when he \n\nknew \n\nthat it...it wouldn\u2019t turn out right for himself in the end...why...why...\n\nwhy\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\nMina sniffed, tears pooling in her eyes. \n\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I notice it!?\u201d Jiro exploded, though now, she was talking to herself more than to her friends. \u201cWhy, why, why, why, \n\nwhy!? Midoriya \n\nnoticed it, so \n\nwhy didn\u2019t I!?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jiro!\u201d said Hagakure, shaking her head feverishly; tears sprinkled everywhere. \u201cI-If it\u2019s your fault, t-then...then it\u2019s just as much \n\nour \n\nfault! W-We...we didn\u2019t...we c-couldn\u2019t help Midoriya, either\u2026\u201d \n\n\nTokoyami exhaled slowly. \u201c...I do not think Midoriya would want you to blame yourself,\u201d he told Jiro after a long, long beat of silence. \u201cIn fact...I do not think Midoriya would want \n\nany \n\nof us to blame ourselves.\u201d \n\n\nJiro bit her lip, tears dripping off her face. \u201c...Well,\u201d she said harshly, \u201cMidoriya\u2019s not \n\nhere right now,\n\n is he?\u201d \n\n\nSilence. Intense, thick silence, as Jiro\u2019s words bounced off the walls and echoed back at them. After that, Jiro turned sharply and kept walking down the hallway, towards an unknown destination. \n\n\nMina made a move to follow her, but Tokoyami\u2019s hand landed on her shoulder. \u201c...Leave her be,\u201d Tokoyami said. \u201cThis...this is hard for all of us.\u201d \n\n\nMina looked at Jiro\u2019s departing figure, then nodded feverishly, rubbing her eyes with the backs of her hands. She, Tokoyami, and Hagakure left in the opposite direction, back down the hallway from whence they\u2019d come. \n\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t follow either party. He stood there, alone, engulfed in his own thoughts. He didn\u2019t understand. The Not-Him had told him that his Quirk allowed him to come back once after death, to have a second chance, so why...why couldn\u2019t anyone see him? Was this the side-effect Not-Him hadn\u2019t had the chance to explain? Or was it something different? \n\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t know, and he didn\u2019t have time to find out; the walls of the hallway shattered, giving way to a new room\u2014one Izuku quickly recognized as the Teacher\u2019s Lounge. \n\n\nSitting across from each other on opposite couches were Aizawa and Present Mic, Aizawa going through a stack of paper while Present Mic looked idly in the other direction, his elbow on the arm of the couch and his chin resting on his knuckles. \n\n\n\u201c...The 1-A students stopped participating in class,\u201d Mic said after a few moments. \u201cThere are a few of \u2018em that \n\ntry, \n\nbut in the end...they just give up, y\u2019know?\u201d \n\n\nAizawa nodded shortly. \n\n\n\u201c...And I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I blame \u2018em, either,\u201d Mic went on defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s completely natural. It just...it sucks that these kids have to go through this.\u201d\n\n\nAizawa nodded again, and then, he pulled a single sheet of paper from his stack and passed it across the coffee table to Mic. Mic took the sheet and looked it over. \n\n\u201cThe villain called himself Abyss,\u201d Aizawa told him as he read the document. \u201cOther than that, the police don\u2019t know anything about his past, or his true identity.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not very well-known,\u201d Mic said after a few moments. \u201cThis is the first I\u2019m hearing of \u2018im, actually. What does he want? What\u2019s his goal?\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Aizawa said darkly. \u201cHe does it for his own sick kicks, apparently. He\u2019s evaded custody up until now, too, so no one\u2019s been able to stop him.\u201d \nMic stopped, the piece of paper slipping through his hands. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, leaning forward, something like murderous hatred gleaming in his eyes. \u201cYou mean to tell me that he murdered a fifteen year old boy just for the fun of it?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAizawa didn\u2019t answer, but his lack of response told Mic all he needed to know. The man shot to his feet and marched, feet pounding, towards the door. \n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on death row now, Mic,\u201d Aizawa said pointedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWatch me.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMic.\u201d \n\n\nMic stopped with a low growl and spun around. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this all in stride, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he snapped accusingly. \u201cDoes it not bother you that one of your students was \n\nmurd\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Aizawa ground out in a voice so low and threatening that Mic snapped his mouth shut instantly. \u201cDo you seriously believe I\u2019m \n\nnot \n\njust as upset about this as the rest of us?\u201d\n\n\nMic backed down immediately. \u201cSorry, Eraser,\u201d he said, putting up open-palmed hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d \n\n\nAizawa sighed heavily, setting his papers down on the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he said, and that was it. \n\n\nMic sighed, then crossed the room and sat down on the couch again, folding his hands together. \u201c...Mortal peril, danger, death...it\u2019s all part of being a hero,\u201d Mic said quietly. \u201cYou practically sign up for it. But...Midoriya...he was just a \n\nkid, \n\nyou know? I mean, it would still be horrible if it happened to anyone else, but...\n\nman.\u201d \n\n\n\nAizawa didn\u2019t respond. \n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen All Might around recently,\u201d Mic said out of the blue. \n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking some off-time,\u201d was Aizawa\u2019s simple answer. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be back, but he didn\u2019t say when.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku blinked and swallowed. Before Aizawa or Mic had the chance to say anything else, the world shattered once again, and Izuku was swept elsewhere. \n\n\nHe was back at the grave. \n\nHis \n\ngrave, as weird as that sounded, even to himself. But unlike the last time, Todoroki and Yaoyorozu were gone, and the sun had long since set, bright stars hanging in the dark sky overhead. \n\n\nStanding before the grave was All Might, in his \u201ctrue\u201d form, and he looked at the stone monument with an unreadable expression. \n\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t even try calling out this time. He knew by now that it would make no difference. Instead, he walked forward a few steps, so that he was standing a mere three feet from his mentor. \n\n\nAll Might didn\u2019t say nor do anything for the longest of times. \n\n\nBut when that longest of times passed, All Might took in a breath and spoke. \n\n\n\u201c...Young Midoriya...I would like to apologize,\u201d he said in a quiet voice, and already, Izuku could sense the guilt, the regret. Izuku opened his mouth to say that no, he didn\u2019t need to apologize, and then stopped at the last second. \n\n\n\u201c...There are a few things I\u2019d like to apologize for, actually,\u201d All Might said, his voice wavering this time. \u201cFirst...I\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. To save you, that is.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku bit his lip. \n\n\n\u201cWhen I heard what\u2019d happened, honestly...I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d All Might went on. \u201cI thought it was a joke. I didn\u2019t \n\nwant \n\nto believe it, and yet\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThere was a long pause. \n\n\n\u201c...Second,\u201d All Might changed the subject, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be a better mentor. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know anything about it, what it meant to guide somebody, let alone someone as reckless and determined as myself. I know my fumblings caused you pain, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\n\nThere was a second long pause. \n\n\n\u201c...That\u2019s not all I\u2019m here for,\u201d All Might said, like an afterthought. \u201c...I don\u2019t know if I ever told you this\u2014my memory isn\u2019t exactly the best, unfortunately\u2014but I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m sincerely, honestly \n\nproud \n\nof you, Young Midoriya, for all you did and for all you stood for. And I hope you realized this, but I never once regretted making you my successor. And...that hasn\u2019t changed. Even now, that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku felt like crying, not for the first time. \n\n\n\u201c...You were braver than most,\u201d All Might went on, \u201cwith a heart of pure gold. Your determination certainly was admirable, and your selflessness...well...I don\u2019t think I even need to say it.\u201d \n\n\nAll Might inhaled and exhaled slowly. \n\n\n\u201c...I don\u2019t think I ever mentioned this, either, Young Midoriya, but...you became something of a son to me,\u201d he went on, even quieter than before. \u201cAnd...I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you, not just as a hero, but as your mentor, too. I\u2019m...sorry. I failed you.\u201d \n\n\nAll Might\u2019s voice cracked at this, and Izuku suddenly couldn\u2019t hold back. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault!\u201d he shouted desperately, hoping, \n\npraying \n\nfor All Might to hear him, even though no one else could. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault! Don\u2019t think that, \n\nplease, don\u2019t think that!\u201d \n\n\n\nBut All Might made no indication that he\u2019d heard him, and suddenly, Izuku couldn\u2019t take it anymore. His bottled up feelings came bubbling to the surface all at once, and he spun around and \n\nbolted, \n\ncharging full-speed through the grass, his feet pounding against the ground. \n\n\n\nNo, no, no, no, no\u2014! \n\n\n\nHe gritted his teeth, his hands balling into fists as he pummelled on. \n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t real, this isn\u2019t real, this can\u2019t be real\u2014! \n\n\n\nThe wind whistled through the air around him, stinging his skin, not that he cared. \n\n\n\nEveryone...!\n\n\n\n\n...I\u2019m so sorry...! \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry! \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry!\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry! \n\n\n\nHe kept running, his lungs burning. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry I made you cry! I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t fight back harder! I\u2019m sorry I hurt you! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! \n\n\n\nOchako, crying into Iida\u2019s shoulder. Yaoyorozu and Todoroki, blaming themselves. His mother, crying her eyes out. Kirishima and Kaminari, trying and failing to hold it together. Jiro, self-loathing. Mina and Hagakure, trying in vain to comfort their friends and each other. Bakug\u014d, punching the wall in anger in frustration, but most importantly, regret. Ojiro. Sato. Sero. Tokoyami. Aoyama. Tsuyu. Mineta. Shoji. Koda. Aizawa. Present Mic. All Might. \n\n\nEveryone.\n\n\nIzuku clenched his teeth. \n\n\n\nTake me back. \n\n\n\nHe ran faster, his legs and lungs and heart burning as he plunged on. \n\n\n\nTake me back!! \n\n\n\nHe squeezed his eyes shut, wind blowing sweat and tears off his face. \n\n\n\n\u201cTAKE ME BACK!!\u201d \n\nIzuku screamed, loudly and longly. \n\n\nThere was a \n\ncrack \n\nlike a lightning bolt, and the world around him exploded. \n\n\u00a0\nIzuku was choking.\nHis clothes were soaked through, and every inch of his body was cold,  freezing cold. He coughed harshly and hacked, salty water spilling from between his lips.\nThere was a sudden commotion around him, voices shouting and footsteps scuttling to and fro; someone grabbed his shoulder and turned him over on his side, then thumped between his shoulder blades as he coughed and choked.\nHe gasped, every breath burning against his throat and lungs, the cold wind and air seeming to bite into his skin. But despite everything, he could breathe. He was breathing.\n\u201cMidoriya\u2014!\u201d Someone grabbed him and pulled him into their arms, wrapping him in a tight but warm embrace. It was a bit easier to breathe now that he was sitting up, but his chest was still burning, and he coughed twice. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Midoriya, it\u2019s alright, just breathe...keep breathing\u2026\u201d\nIzuku swallowed thickly, slowly dragging breaths of cold mountain air into his lungs from between chattering teeth.\n\u201cSomeone, go get help!\u201d the voice of whoever was holding him shouted, and Izuku finally managed to crack his eyes open, looking upwards. His eyes stung, and his vision was blurry; above, the sky was a dark, threatening black, stars and moon hidden by even darker clouds.\n\u201cI-I-Iida,\u201d Izuku managed through his cracked throat and chattering teeth. He felt weak, his limbs heavy and numb, and it was still. So.  Cold\u2026 \nIida tightened his hold, using his body as a shield against the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now, Midoriya,\u201d Iida told him firmly, but there was a waver and shudder in his voice that Izuku didn\u2019t miss. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay now, you\u2019re safe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe tied up the villain, he\u2019s unconscious now!\u201d shouted Kirishima\u2019s voice from seemingly far away. \u201cBakug\u014d\u2019s standing guard!\u201d\n\u201cMina ran to get help!\u201d came Kaminari\u2019s voice, much closer. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d\n\u201cDeku!\u201d\nIzuku glanced over; Ochako slammed to her knees beside him, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cD-Deku, I-I was...I was so scared,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking in a million different places.\nIzuku didn\u2019t know how he did it, but he somehow managed to give her an exhausted but genuine smile. \u201cS-Sorry,\u201d he croaked, and then, he launched into a fit of coughing an instant later.\nIida\u2019s arms tightened around him again protectively, and he ran a hand up and down Izuku\u2019s back until the coughing subsided. \u201cStop talking for now, Midoriya,\u201d Iida commanded, firmly but gently both at once, sort of how Izuku imagined an older brother\u2019s scorn. \u201cYou just focus on breathing, alright? We\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d\nIzuku listened, closing his eyes and resting his head against Iida\u2019s chest. \u00a0\n\u201cHere, I made a thermometer,\u201d came Yaoyorozu\u2019s voice, followed by something pressing to Izuku\u2019s temple. It disappeared a moment later, followed by Yaoyorozu\u2019s report of, \u201cThirty-three degrees, celsius.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s ears felt like they were full of cotton, and his head was pounding horribly, but...he was home. Whatever  nightmare  he\u2019d been in previously was gone. He was back, he was with his friends, he was safe, his friends were safe, they were  home. \n\u201cHis lips are blue.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s borderlining hypothermia...\u201d\n\u201cO-Oh my gosh, h-he\u2019s freezing\u2026\u201d\nIzuku, as hazy as his mind currently was, was no idiot. He knew the dangers of the situation, the kind of peril he was in; they\u2019d been in the middle of survival training on the top of a  mountain,  where the was air cold and the wind unforgiving. Getting dragged into an abyss of icy water by a murderous villain was  not an encouraged activity.\nBut for some reason, despite everything, Izuku felt like laughing. He felt like laughing, and he was pretty sure if he wasn\u2019t so weak, he would\u2019ve. He was so, so, so,  relieved.  He was back. He was  back,  and his friends were okay, and they weren\u2019t blaming themselves for his death, and they weren\u2019t mourning, they were  okay. \nHe felt something warm slide down his face, and it was now that he realized he was crying. He was crying, but he was happy, he was so, so, so  happy, and he felt giddy beneath his exhaustion and pain.\n\u201cMidoriya, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Iida asked, voice urgent but gentle both at once. \u201cMidoriya?\u201d\nBut Izuku barely heard him. \u201cI-I-I\u2019m back,\u201d Izuku murmured, his tears dripping off his face and his teeth chattering still. \u201cI\u2019m  b-b-back\u2026\u201d \n\u201cYes, you\u2019re home,\u201d Iida said, misunderstanding him, but his words were reassuring to Izuku either way. \u201cYou\u2019re home now, we\u2019ve got you. It\u2019s alright now.\u201d\nAnd it was. Izuku was  freezing,  and his chest was burning, and his head was pounding, and his throat felt like it\u2019d been shredded to ribbons, but he was content. He was  happy.  He was  home. \u00a0\n\u201cHere, let me see him.\u201d\nIzuku didn\u2019t bother opening his eyes, but he felt himself being handed over. An instant later, someone else wrapped their arms around him, but it was distinctly warmer.\n\u201cT-T-Todoroki\u2026\u201d he murmured, cracking his eyes open again.\nTodoroki just tightened his grip. \u201cLet me know if it\u2019s too hot, alright?\u201d was all he said, and Izuku nodded shakily, closing his eyes again. After a while\u2014and it took a  while \u2014the tremors stopped, and his teeth finally stopped chattering. He was cold, but he was also warm, and breathing became easier and easier by the second.\nHe heard voices, but the world began to fade around him, a fog overcoming his senses and thought process.\n\u201cHe should be alright now,\u201d came Todoroki\u2019s voice from above him. \u201cHe stopped shivering a while ago.\u201d\n\u201cHere!\u201d\nSomething was draped around him; a blanket, probably, but he was only about eighty percent sure, his mind fogged with exhaustion. Yaoyorozu\u2019s temple-scan thermometer grazed his forehead again.\n\u201cHis temperature\u2019s rising again...that\u2019s a relief\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGeez, that was...that was  terrifying.\u201d That was Sero\u2019s voice, he thought.\n\u201cHoly  crap, Midoriya.\u201d That was unmistakably Kirishima, and a hand ruffled Izuku\u2019s hair momentarily. \u201cDon\u2019t you do that again, \u2018kay, dude? That was seriously horrifying.\u201d\n\u201cI brought help!\u201d Mina\u2019s loud, fear-filled voice shouted from somewhere far off. \u201cHow\u2019s Midoriya!?\u201d\nThere were other voices, other responses, other answers, other commands, but Izuku couldn\u2019t make any of it out. After a few moments of nothing but chaos, he felt himself being lifted into another pair of arms -- bigger, stronger ones.\nHe cracked open his eyes again. \u201cA-All M-Might\u2026\u201d He broke himself off with a couple of harsh coughs, and All Might\u2019s arms tightened around him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Young Midoriya,\u201d his mentor told him. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. It\u2019s alright.\u201d\nIzuku smiled tiredly and closed his eyes, another tear making its way down his cheek. His mind was finally overwhelmed by darkness, and he let himself go.\nHe woke up in a hospital, surrounded by warmth and familiar voices.\n\u201cDo ya think he\u2019s okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he is. The doctor said he would be, right\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cAll things considered, it\u2019s pretty amazing. I mean...he stopped  breathing.  For, like...a  long time.\u201d \n\u201cI know. Thinking logically about it...it doesn\u2019t make sense. In all frankness, he shouldn\u2019t be alive\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLook at you guys, talking all depressed-like! Midoriya\u2019s  fine, remember? Isn\u2019t that all that matters now?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s right! Who cares  how?  He\u2019s  okay!\u201d \nHis classmates. Izuku recognized the voices as those of his classmates. With a sudden jolt, he remembered all that had transpired\u2014everything, from drowning, to meeting the \u201cother him,\u201d to seeing everyone,  everyone, as they mourned over his \u201cdeath.\u201d He remembered waking up again, choking, and then\u2026\n...He must have passed out, because his train of memories ended there.\n\u201cThe doctor said he was borderlining hypothermia, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I think so. Something like that.\u201d\n\u201cDo...do they know when Deku\u2019s gonna wake up?\u201d\n\u201cNo clue, only that it could be any day now. Other than the hypothermia thing and the bruised ribs, he\u2019s completely fine. Trust me, he\u2019s gonna wake up any moment now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! He\u2019s a fighter! He ain\u2019t gonna let this bring him down!\u201d\nIzuku cracked his eyes open. A blinding white light had him closing them just as quickly, but then, slower now that he knew better, he opened them again. It took his stinging eyes a moment or so to adjust to the hospital lights, but when they did, he was able to make out his classmates\u2014all nineteen of them\u2014dispersed through the hospital room.\n\u201c...I\u2019m awake,\u201d Izuku croaked.\nInstantly, his classmates whirled around to face him, eyes wide with shock.\nThere was a beat of total silence.\nAnd then, the room exploded into cheers and whoops. Ochako took a running start and glomped him; Sero and Mineta high-fived in the background; and everyone began talking and shouting at once. \u00a0\n\u201cMIDORIYA!!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s back!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201d\n\u201cDude! Don\u2019t do that again!\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cHey! I wanna hug him, too!\u201d\n\u201cWelcome back to the land of the living, buddy!\u201d\n\u201cOur sunshine classmate\u2019s back!\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright? Do you need a doctor?\u201d\n\u201cWe were all so scared, Midoriya\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cYou scared the living  crap out of us!\u201d\n\u201cGak, you dolt, you gave me a heart attack, you know\u2014!\u201d\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help it; a small laugh bubbled up from his chest, fragile but honest. \u201cI-I\u2019m okay, you guys, r-really\u2026\u201d he somehow managed to gasp, his throat feeling just as tight and scratchy as ever. \u201cI\u2019m okay\u2026\u201d\nOchako finally released him and sat back, which made breathing a bit easier. He hadn\u2019t noticed it before, but his chest was aching, as was his head, and there was an IV stand by the bed, the needle beneath his skin.\n\u201cGeez, though, dude, I mean it,\u201d said Kirishima, reaching over and ruffling Izuku\u2019s hair\u2014again. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again. I\u2019m telling you, when you went under, everyone lost their freaking  minds.  Even  Bakug\u014d was worried!\u201d\n\u201cSHUT UP!!\u201d screeched Bakug\u014d indignantly, brandishing his fists. \u201cDO YOU WANNA DIE, WEIRD-HAIR!?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Kirishima, activating his Quirk and putting up his forearms to fend off Bakug\u014d\u2019s punch in the nick of time.\nIzuku smiled, shakily but honestly. \u201cW-What...what happened?\u201d he asked after a moment or two. Although he knew the basic gist of it, he wanted to hear it from his friends\u2019 perspective. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou noticed the villain in the water and leapt in front of me,\u201d Jiro began, her gaze downcast, but not nearly as downcast as it had been before, when Izuku \u201cdied.\u201d \u201cIt...It grabbed you, and...it dragged you under.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ochako said, then stopped, swallowing thickly and wringing her hands together. \u201cYou...you were down there...for a  while.\u201d \nIzuku bit his lip and remembered, all too suddenly, that if it hadn\u2019t been for his undetectable Quirk, he would be dead. He would be really, truly, honestly  dead, for real this time (because he\u2019d already died once).\n\u201cAsui and Yaoyorozu leapt into the water after you,\u201d Mina narrated animatedly, but there was something in her voice that betrayed her fear at the memory. \u201cWhile Yaoyorozu distracted him, Asui fished you out. You\u2026\u201d\nHer voice trailed off suddenly, and she stopped altogether. No one said anything, but Izuku could already guess what had happened.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t breathing, idiot,\u201d Bakug\u014d finished (harshly) when no one else did. \u00a0\n\u201cIt was...it was terrifying,\u201d whispered Sero. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not just saying that, either. It was seriously, seriously terrifying.\u201d\n\u201cYaoyorozu came back up with the villain,\u201d Kaminari said, \u201cand we chained him up and made sure he was unconscious while...while Iida started CPR.\u201d\nIzuku turned; Iida looked the other way. \u201cYou\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI was the only one who knew how,\u201d was Iida\u2019s answer, and he straightened his glasses. \u201cI was...rather panicked, however. I...cracked some of your ribs in my haste, and for that, I apologize.\u201d\n\u201cNonono, don\u2019t apologize!\u201d Izuku said quickly, waving his hands back and forth. \u201cI-I mean, y-you saved me! I should thank you!\u201d\n(He didn\u2019t dare mention the fact that he\u2019d actually died while underwater, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for his undetectable Quirk, Iida\u2019s efforts would have been in vain.) \u00a0\nIida didn\u2019t look entirely certain, but he didn\u2019t argue, which Izuku counted as a win. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright now,\u201d Iida said.\n\u201cThe villain\u2019s on death row,\u201d said Kirishima, butting in; Bakug\u014d had given up on trying to kill him and was instead sulking in the background. \u201cApparently, he was this guy called Abyss who\u2019d killed a number of people in the past.\u201d\nIzuku came close\u2014 dangerously  close\u2014to saying \u201cI know,\u201d but he stopped himself at the last second. There was no way, just  no way, he could tell his friends what had actually happened.\n\u201cHe had a weird Quirk, though,\u201d said Sato thoughtfully, tapping his chin. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d think the guy would have a water related Quirk, since he attacked underwater and all, but apparently, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nIzuku blinked. This was new information. \u201cWhat was his Quirk?\u201d\n\u201cIt was something called...gah, I dunno\u2026\u201d Sero tapped his temple with a frown. You could almost  see  the gears trying to turn in his head. \u201cIt was...  Hopelessness,  or something. Or  Defeat.\u201d  \u00a0  \u00a0 \n\u201cIt hacks into its victims minds and makes them believe there is no hope, that there\u2019s no point in living,\u201d Yaoyorozu explained, her voice flat. \u201cOnce I was underwater, knocking him unconscious was unbelievably easy. He definitely wasn\u2019t used to combat, so I assume he used his Quirk to trick people into giving up on life.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s behind bars now!\u201d said Mineta brightly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about him ever again!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d boasted Hagakure proudly, punching her fist into the air (although the only evidence of this was her sleeve shooting upwards). \u201cEven though he was equipped with plenty of underwater equipment, he was no match for Yaomomo! She made a quick rebreather and staff for herself and showed him what for!\u201d\n That makes sense, Izuku thought, not to what Mineta and Hagakure proclaimed, but rather to what Yaoyorozu explained. Knowing more about the villain\u2019s Quirk explained those depressing thoughts Izuku had heard moments before he\u2026\u201ddied.\u201d Thoughts that weren\u2019t his own, words that he hadn\u2019t conjured up.\n\u201cIs that what you felt, Deku?\u201d Ochako asked, quietly and nervously, and Izuku looked at her. She averted her gaze, fiddling with the hem of her shirt. \u201cI-I mean...hopelessness. D-Did...did you...did you want to give up?\u201d\nIzuku grimaced. He hadn\u2019t wanted to say any of this, because he didn\u2019t want them to feel even worse about this situation, but...he was already hiding so much from them all, the whole \u201cliterally dying\u201d ordeal, and he didn\u2019t have the heart to hide this, too.\nAnd plus, they were all looking at him with eyes full of concern. Honestly...how  could he hide this from them, after all they went through?\n\u201cErrm...y-yeah,\u201d Izuku relented after a thick swallow, reaching and scratching the back of his neck awkwardly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal, or anything, just...hopelessness. Yeah, that\u2019s...that\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d\nHis friends didn\u2019t respond, and he assumed that meant they weren\u2019t satisfied with his answer, so he elaborated.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Izuku said (lied). \u201cJ-Just...stuff like,  it\u2019s pointless,  and  give up,  and  stop fighting, and that it\u2019d be better once I was dead...that no one would miss me\u2026\u201d\nThe previously comfortable silence became a tension-filled one, and his classmates stared at him, some looking shocked while others looked terrified. Ochako and Iida in particular fell into the latter category.\n\u201cDeku...d-do you believe it?\u201d Ochako asked him, her voice no more than a trembling whisper. \u201cDid you... do you...believe it\u2026?\u201d\nHonestly, the villain\u2019s words had felt all too familiar to Izuku. They were all things Izuku had grown up with, actually, things like  give up,  and  you\u2019re worthless,  and  how could you ever amount to anything?,  and  You\u2019re Quirkless!,  and  Why don\u2019t you just die already?,  so when Ochako asked the question, honestly...Izuku didn\u2019t know how to respond. Not because he didn\u2019t  want  to, but because he  literally didn\u2019t know how to. \n Did  he believe the things Abyss put in his head? He hadn\u2019t seemed very  alarmed  by them. He hadn\u2019t  argued with them. He\u2019d just...taken it all in stride, because they were words he was used to hearing. He hadn\u2019t thought much of them at all.\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d Now it was Iida\u2019s voice, firm and steady and borderline  threateningly.  \u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\n\u201cI...I-I don\u2019t know,\u201d Izuku finally managed, because that was the honest truth. He  didn\u2019t  know one way or the other. He certainly didn\u2019t fight against the thoughts. He fought against the  water  and  drowning plenty, but not against the thoughts and feelings assaulting his mind.\n\u201cI-I mean...I-I didn\u2019t really  object,\u201d Izuku said quietly. \u201cI-I just kind of...a-accepted it.\u201d\nThe instant the words were out of his mouth, he knew he\u2019d said too much. A look of hurt, of horrible, horrible hurt flashed across Ochako\u2019s face, and the rest of the class looked at him likewise, like he\u2019d said some horrible thing. \u00a0\n\u201cS-S-Sorry, t-that was really depressing,\u201d Izuku said, mentally screaming at himself. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDEKU!!\u201d  Ochako screamed, lunging for him once again and wrapping her arms tightly around his neck and shoulders. Izuku flinched, his ribs throbbing in protest to Ochako\u2019s movements, but he was too startled to push her away.\nAnd soon, Iida joined the embrace, and then, so did Kaminari, and Sero, and Kirishima, and Sato, and Koda, and Jiro, and Tokoyami, and Todoroki, and the whole rest of the class, too (even Bakug\u014d, though Kirishima may or may not have dragged him into it against his will).\nIzuku swallowed thickly. \u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou do realize we all care about you, don\u2019t you, Deku?\u201d Ochako asked him quietly. \u201cWe care about you, a  lot.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Midoriya,\u201d proclaimed Kaminari. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of thoughts that stupid villain put in your head, but no matter what he or anyone else says, we\u2019re your friends.\u201d\n\u201cYou matter to us,\u201d said Iida seriously, \u201cto each and every one of us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Midori,\u201d said Mina. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t  imagine life without you.\u201d\nAnd, remembering the side effect of his recently discovered Quirk, the one that allowed him to see what the world would be like if he really  did die, Izuku knew his friends told the truth. Izuku honestly didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d ever thought otherwise.\nHis friends loved him. They cared about him. And he knew this now. He was realizing this for perhaps the first time in his life.\nAnd he didn\u2019t really realize it until now, either, but he\u2019d started crying. In relief, in joy, or just because he was overwhelmed, he didn\u2019t know. And he decided it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cT-Thank you,\u201d he whispered, squeezing his eyes shut.  \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, Midoriya,\u201d said Kirishima. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank us.\u201d\nAnd Izuku smiled, a feeling of warmth, comfort and contentment settling deep into his heart. \u00a0\n\u201cIZUKU!!\u201d\nHis mother crashed into the little hospital room the moment his classmates filed out, tears streaming down her cheeks, her knees knocking together. Her face was filled with something that far surpassed mere  panic, but there was relief there, too, somehow.\nThe last time he\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d been sobbing brokenly over his death, and although the sobbing part hadn\u2019t changed, the circumstances under which she was sobbing had.\n\u201c...Mom,\u201d Izuku breathed, and he smiled brightly.\nShe ran to him and enveloped him in her arms, and he leaned into her embrace and hugged her back just as tightly, tears burning his eyes.\nAt length, though before he was ready to let go, she pulled back, taking his face in her hands and staring into his eyes intensely. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked urgently, brushing his hair off his forehead. \u201cAre you in pain? Are you scared? A-Are you..\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku insisted, smiling softly. \u201cJust a little shaken up, but...I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nHis mother smiled brokenly, let out a shaky sob, and yanked him into her arms once again. \u201cW-When I got the call, I-I...I was so scared,\u201d she whispered, squeezing him tight. \u201cI-I thought...I thought I\u2019d  lost you, Izuku\u2026\u201d\n\u201c...I\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku murmured. \u201cI-I promise I\u2019m okay, Mom\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI know, I know you are, I just\u2026oh, Izuku...\u201d\nShe held him for a long, long time after that, and he didn\u2019t object even once. He knew she needed this reassurance, this closeness, and honestly, he did, too. After being unable to interact with his friends and family, he came to value the time he had with them more.\nAfter a long stretch of time, she finally released him, holding him at arm\u2019s length with her hands on his shoulders.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d she said again, and it was more of a statement than a question. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku said for what felt like the utmost time, though he wasn\u2019t complaining. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m okay. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\nShe looked into his eyes for a moment or two, then smiled softly and kissed his bandaged forehead. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut make sure to let me know otherwise, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Izuku promised.\nShe smiled and threaded her fingers through his hair briefly. \u201cThey\u2019re discharging you a little later on this evening,\u201d she informed him, her voice low. \u201cI have to go fill out some papers, but I\u2019ll be back in a bit, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku agreed.\n\u201cAnd call the nurse if something happens,\u201d his mother said. \u201cNo hiding things, okay? I know how you can be.\u201d\nIzuku smiled faintly. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t.\u201d\nShe smiled softly, pressed another kiss to his temple, and left, closing the door behind her.\nIzuku took a doctor required week off of school, and then, he was back at U.A. with the rest of his friends. Things weren\u2019t really different; he noticed Ochako and Iida hanging around with him a bit more than usual, and Yaoyorozu offered to help him study if he ever had trouble with something, and Bakug\u014d was more \u201cchill\u201d (which was a true miracle), but other than that, and his classmates randomly asking him if he was okay every now and then, everything was back to the way it used to be.\nAnd then, during lunch, All Might asked if Izuku would meet him in the Teacher\u2019s Lounge, and Izuku did.\nIt wasn\u2019t unusual; he often met with All Might during the school day to discuss One For All, but this time, there was an unspoken  heaviness surrounding this meeting, and Izuku couldn\u2019t place what it was, or what it meant.\n\u201cSo...what did you want to talk about?\u201d Izuku asked, sitting on the couch opposite of the one All Might was seated on.\nAll Might, currently in his true form, sighed heavily. \u201cI wanted to apologize for not being there sooner,\u201d he said after a brief pause. \u201cI know it was hard on your classmates, but I don\u2019t want to think about how hard it was for you, being in that situation and all.\u201d\nIzuku got a serious sense of deja vu, and he shook his head feverishly, waving his hands back and forth. \u201cNononono, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Izuku proclaimed, his voice coming out as a high-pitched squeak. \u201cI-I mean, it\u2019s not your fault! It was survival training, we were supposed to be on our own\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cEven so,\u201d said All Might heavily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIzuku opened his mouth again to object.\n\u201cJust accept it, kid, alright?\u201d All Might cut in. \u201cTrust me, you\u2019re not going to be able to talk me out of this one.\u201d\nAnd Izuku snapped his mouth shut again. \u201c...Okay,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI-I forgive you\u2026\u201d And then, under his breath, \u201cEven though you don\u2019t have to apologize\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI heard that.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cBut, besides that,\u201d said All Might, \u201cI\u2019m also sorry I didn\u2019t get the chance to visit you in the hospital. I was meaning to, but then they discharged you, and I thought it would be best to wait until you recovered and were back to school.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I get it,\u201d said Izuku. \u201cIs...Is that all you wanted to talk about, or is there more?\u201d\n\u201cNo, actually, that was it,\u201d said All Might. \u201cI just wanted to apologize, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nIzuku paused and bit his lip, hard enough to draw blood.\n\u201cHey, All Might?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI died.\u201d\nAll Might gave him an incredigious look, then nodded heavily. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung Iida told me you stopped breathing for a full ten minutes, not counting the time you were underwater. It\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re still with us\u2014\u201d\nBut Izuku shook his head. \u201cN-N-No, that\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI-I mean...I-I...I  actually died.  I d-didn\u2019t just...  stop breathing,  I mean...I was  dead.\u201d \nAll Might only stared at him, clearly confused.\n\u201c...Sorry, but...you\u2019re going to have to elaborate a little more, kid,\u201d All Might said at length. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\nAnd Izuku told him everything, from drowning, to meeting Not-Him, to learning about the Quirk he\u2019d been born with, to watching his friends mourn, to waking up again, alive and breathing. All Might said nothing while he explained, just nodded periodically and glanced away, deep in thought.\n\u201c...I-I know it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Izuku said once everything was out in the open, \u201cb-but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe live in a superhuman society, Young Midoriya,\u201d All Might interrupted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try and explain yourself, I believe you. Just...forgive me if I have a hard time taking it in.\u201d\nIzuku swallowed, then nodded. There was a beat.\n\u201cYou died,\u201d All Might repeated. \u201cYou actually died.\u201d\nIzuku bit his lip again, then nodded feverishly.\n\u201cYou... died,\u201d  All Might said again. \u201cWhich means if you  didn\u2019t  have this Quirk, or,  Second Chance, as you called it...you\u2019d actually be dead right now.\u201d\nIzuku didn\u2019t want to think about it, either, but he nodded anyway.\n\u201cAnd, are you... okay  with that?\u201d All Might asked him cautiously. \u201cI mean...psychologically. Are you\u2026\u201d He looked away for a moment, then refrained.  \u201cHow are you, Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cI-I mean...it feels kinda surreal, but\u2026\u201d Izuku rubbed his forearm awkwardly. \u201c...I\u2019m not gonna  argue  with it, y\u2019know? It just...sort of  happened.\u201d \nAll Might nodded. \u201c...And you do realize you can talk to me about anything, and I won\u2019t judge you, correct? If you\u2019re shaken up by this\u2014which would definitely make sense\u2014I\u2019d like you to tell me, or at least someone.\u201d\n\u201cI-I know,\u201d Izuku replied, \u201ca-and I would, but I\u2019m just...i-it doesn\u2019t really... bother  me. W-Which probably sounds  crazy, but...it just doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not crazy, Midoriya,\u201d All Might said. \u201cMaybe the reason you aren\u2019t fazed by this because your body was subconsciously aware of your Quirk.\u201d\n\u201cM-Maybe\u2026\u201d Izuku sighed.\n\u201cDid you tell anyone else about this? Your friends, your doctor\u2026\u201d\nIzuku shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know how,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, my friends...they\u2019re still shaken up by everything, so I didn\u2019t really want to put anything else on them, but...I didn\u2019t know how to explain having two Quirks, either.\u201d\n\u201cRight, makes sense,\u201d All Might nodded. \u201cIf you really wanted to tell them, though, you probably could. This world is full of abnormalities, so it\u2019s unlikely it would arouse any suspicion.\u201d\n \u201cDo you really think  any  of us are okay right now?\u201d \n\n \u201cI-I-I\u2019m s-sorry, Izuku! I\u2019m s-s-s-sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I-I\u2019m sorry\u2014!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be  heroes  and I...I-I couldn\u2019t do  anything.  I couldn\u2019t even save my own classmate who was  right in front of me,  how can I possibly hope to save anyone else? \u201d\n\n \u201cI know...I feel the same way.\u201d \n\n\n \u201c...It\u2019s quiet here...without Midoriya.\u201d \n\n \u201cYOU FRICKIN\u2019  IDIOT,  DEKU! WHAT THE HELL MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN GO DYING ON EVERYBODY LIKE THAT!?\u201d \n \u201c...I don\u2019t think I ever mentioned this, Young Midoriya, but...you became something of a son to me. And...I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you, not just as a hero, but as your mentor, too. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u201cI can\u2019t do it, Iida! I want him back! I WANT HIM BACK, IIDA!!\u201d \n\n\u201cNo...I don\u2019t think I want to tell them,\u201d Izuku said, shaking his head. \u201cNot yet, anyways. Maybe...maybe someday, when this all feels like a distant memory.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said All Might. \u201cWell, if you do need anyone to talk to about this, know that I\u2019m here for you. I know I\u2019m not the most experienced mentor out there, but I\u2019ll do what I can, alright?\u201d\nIzuku nodded his agreement.\n\u201cAnd...I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d All Might put his hands together. \u201c...Are you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019re  sure? If something\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s important you let someone know. This...probably isn\u2019t something you should brush off so hastily.\u201d\nIzuku thought this over, long and hard. Maybe he was in some kind of shock or something, still trying to comprehend the fact that he\u2019d been literally  dead,  and maybe someday, he  would  be seriously disturbed by it, but for now...he just...didn\u2019t know what to feel. Didn\u2019t know what he  should have been feeling.\n\u201c...I think I\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cB-But if I...if I\u2019m ever  not okay, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nAll Might only nodded.\n\u201cErm...are...are  you okay?\u201d Izuku asked eventually. \u201cI-I mean...y-you said I\u2019m like a son to you, so\u2026I-I don\u2019t know h-how you\u2019re taking this...\u201d\nAll Might blinked. \u201c...Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cWhen did I tell you that I saw you as a son?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until this moment that Izuku realized he\u2019d slipped up. Up until this point, he\u2019d been treading lightly, not wanting to add any details to the whole \u201cwatching his friends in mourning\u201d part of his Quirk, but now, he\u2019d messed up.\n\u201cS-S-Sorry, I-I didn\u2019t mean to say that!\u201d Izuku stammered, waving his hands back and forth. \u201cI-I-I mean t-that was r-r-really random, I-I-I\u2019m sorry! I-I just\u2026\u201d He paused and looked down; the carpet suddenly became very interesting. \u201c...W-When...w-when everyone was m-mourning, y-you...y-you said...t-t-that ...s-sorry, this is s-stupid, I should shut up now\u2014\u201d\nHe was cut off mid-rant when All Might stood and embraced him.\nIzuku\u2019s train of thought screeched to a halt, his eyes going wide and his mouth snapping shut with an audible  click. He sucked in a sharp breath and held it, his posture going rigid.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spewing nonsense again, kid,\u201d All Might said. \u201cI never denied it, did I? That I see you as a son?\u201d\nIzuku blinked. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say. While he could probably make a living off of spewing random knowledge and mumbling to himself under his breath, words failed him now. He couldn\u2019t\u2014literally couldn\u2019t\u2014find anything to say. \u00a0\nIzuku never really knew his father. For as long as he could remember, it had always been him and his mother, and what memories he  did  manage to dig up of his father were always hazy and uncertain. He vaguely remembered a pair of long legs and a hand ruffling his hair, but he couldn\u2019t tell the difference between what he  actually remembered and what his brain fabricated to fill the void in his heart.\nSo, admittedly...he was more than a little shocked by all of this. All Might\u2019s embrace was different than his mother\u2019s, but also somehow the same. Izuku couldn\u2019t explain it, nor did he try.\nHe didn\u2019t really know what it was like to  have a father, but\u2026\n...If he  did\u2026 \n...He imagined it would be something like this. \u00a0\nHe noticed but didn\u2019t acknowledge All Might pulling back, settling his hands on Izuku\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThe look on your face is priceless right now,\u201d All Might told him, smiling.\nIzuku blinked thrice in rapid session. Didn\u2019t say anything. All Might chuckled lightly and ruffled his hair; Izuku blinked again, this time at the ground, then looked up at his mentor again.\n\u201cWell, so long as you\u2019re alright, that\u2019s all that really matters,\u201d All Might said, shrugging idly and putting up his hands. \u201cAnd don\u2019t do anything too reckless too soon, alright? I don\u2019t think the rest of us would be able to handle it.\u201d \u00a0\nSomehow, Izuku found his words again. \u201cI-I\u2019ll try,\u201d he said. \u201cBut...I can\u2019t really make any promises...\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I figured as much. Just try your best, alright?\u201d\nIzuku nodded firmly. \u201cFair enough.\u201d \u00a0\nAfter that, life just sort of...went on. His friends were more protective of him than normal, and his mother called him periodically during the school day to make sure he was okay, and Aizawa and All Might kept closer eye on him during potentially dangerous training exercises, but other than that, things just kept going the way they always had. It was...weird, after all that had happened, but he wasn\u2019t complaining.\n\u201cYou...you guys don\u2019t have to stay with me all the time,\u201d Izuku said, two weeks after returning to his school; Ochako and Iida flanked him, as they had been doing almost all day so far. \u201cI\u2019m okay now.\u201d\nIida let out a long sigh, closing his eyes momentarily. \u201cWe know, Midoriya,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can\u2019t really blame us for worrying. At the moment...\u201d He shared a look with Ochako, then directed his gaze towards Izuku. \u201cWe\u2019re all still trying to get over what happened.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re our friend, Deku,\u201d Ochako said, and she smiled brightly at him. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without you.\u201d\nIzuku blinked at her, and then, he smiled back. \u201c...Yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cJIRO, WATCH OUT!\u201d \n\n\nIt happened so quickly that no one moved in time to prevent it. There was a splash from the body of water nearby; Midoriya lunged forward and gave Jiro a harsh shove in the other direction; thick, black chains wrapped around Midoriya\u2019s chest and throat and yanked him backwards. \n\n\nHe disappeared beneath the murky water, and then...\n\n\nAnd then, it was over, just like that. \n\n\nA loud chorus of \u201cMIDORIYA!\u201d ran throughout the 1-A students, and they raced to the water\u2019s edge, everyone shouting and panicking at once. However, Jiro remained frozen in place, unable to move, as though her feet had been nailed to the ground.\n\n\nTsuyu suddenly barreled past the others and leapt into the water, disappearing an instant later. Yaoyorozu, thinking quickly, constructed a makeshift rebreather for herself as well as a long, metal staff before following her classmate into the depths. \n\n\nBlind panic. That was the only way to describe just what was happening. Kirishima tried jumping in, too, but was held back by Sero. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do anything!\u201d Sero shouted at him, using strips of tape to hold his classmate back. \u201cTsuyu and Yaoyorozu are the only people who can handle it!\u201d \n\n\nThere was panic. Blind, unbridled \n\npanic, \n\nbut through it all, Jiro just stared, unable to move, hardly able to breathe. She heard her classmates shouting orders, heard some of them uttering loud cries of, \u201cPlease, please, please, please, please let them be okay!!\u201d but she didn\u2019t respond to any of it. \n\n\n\nHe\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Midoriya, he\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...He saved me. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCold. Black. Unforgiving. That was Yaoyorozu\u2019s first impression of the water. She kicked her feet desperately, plunging further and further downwards into the abyss. Tsuyu was already far ahead of her, her Quirk working to her advantage, and Yaoyorozu narrowed her eyes, trying to see through the black, murky water. \n\n\nThey went deep. \n\nReally \n\ndeep. So deep in fact that it seemed impossible, and Yaoyorozu lost track of time. Had it already been a minute? Two minutes? She didn\u2019t know, nor did she care. \n\n\nThen, she spotted them: the villain, wearing a rebreather not much different than Yaoyorozu\u2019s, was dragging an unmoving Midoriya further and further into the black. Tsuyu was approaching steadily. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of getting Midoriya!\u201d Tsuyu hollered to Yaoyorozu, her voice muffled by the water, but Yaoyorozu somehow managed to make out what she\u2019d said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the villain to you!\u201d \n\n\nThat was the best course of action to take, and Yaoyorozu nodded to her classmate before narrowing her eyes at the villain again. The villain had been aiming for Jiro; Midoriya just noticed and jumped in to save her, but the fact that the villain had been aiming for her classmates \n\nat all \n\nbrought a burning hatred to Yaoyorozu\u2019s mind. \n\n\nShe\u2019d take care of the villain. Ohhh, she\u2019d \n\ntake care of the villain. \n\n\n\nThey reached Midoriya soon after, Tsuyu plunging ahead. She wrapped her tongue around Midoriya\u2019s midsection and yanked, but he was held fast by the chains around his chest and throat. The thing that was most terrifying about this was the fact that Midoriya wasn\u2019t struggling. It was hard to see in the dark water, but Yaoyorozu was pretty sure his eyes were closed...\n\n\n\nWe have to take out the villain before we can get Midoriya free, \n\nthe reasonable, problem-solving part of Yaoyorozu\u2019s mind told her, and with fiery determination filling her mind and heart and soul, she kicked her feet and sped forward. \n\n\nShe could see the villain, a mere silhouette in the dark water, but that wasn\u2019t a problem. It didn\u2019t matter how hard it was; Yaoyorozu was going to beat him, she was going to make him \n\npay \n\nfor what he did. \n\n\n(In the back of her mind, though, beneath this burning fury, she was panicking, because she confirmed now that Midoriya definitely wasn\u2019t moving.) \n\n\nYaoyorozu brandished her metal staff and swung at the gap of space between Midoriya\u2019s unmoving form and the silhouette of the villain. Metal clanged on metal; she\u2019d hit the chains. \n\n\nShe swung again, this time at the villain, and he dodged, so she swung at the chains again. The chill of the water was weakening them, and they didn\u2019t seem very strong to begin with; Yaoyorozu swung again, her hatred for the villain being momentarily replaced by the fear of losing her friend. \n\n\nGetting Midoriya out was a top priority. Was \n\nthe \n\ntop priority. \n\n\nShe swung again. Metal on metal. How long had they been down here? She swung again. It had to have been at least five minutes. Metal on metal. She swung again. Why wasn\u2019t Midoriya struggling? Metal on metal. Surely he should have been moving, been fighting back. She swung again. Metal on metal. Midoriya was a fighter, he was strong, so why wasn\u2019t he struggling? She swung again. How long had they been underwater? How long had \n\nMidoriya \n\nbeen underwater, unable to breathe? Metal on metal. \n\n\nAnd then, there was a very satisfying \n\nsnap, \n\nand the chains were broken. Instantly, Tsuyu wound her tongue around Midoriya\u2019s mid-section and yanked again, this time shooting upwards, towards the water\u2019s surface. Yaoyorozu watched until she disappeared, and then, she turned back towards the villain, tightening her grip on her staff. \n\n\nNow that Tsuyu and Midoriya were gone, Yaoyorozu could focus all her attention on the villain. She steeled her resolve, readied herself, and swung her staff\u2014hard.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThey were still underwater, but Tsuyu could tell Midoriya was unconscious. As she pulled him towards the surface as fast as humanly (or, rather frog-ly) possible, she could tell how limp he was, how \n\nlifeless \n\nhe seemed, not moving or twitching or objecting to being suddenly jerked around. She didn\u2019t want to think about it, but\u2026\n\n\n...What if they were too late\u2026?\n\n\nShe shook her head feverishly and broke the surface of the water, hauling Midoriya up with her tongue and gently setting him down on the cold hard ground. Instantly, her classmates surrounded him, everyone shouting and talking at once. \n\n\nAnd Tsuyu could see it clearly now. Even though the sky was dark, even though clouds blocked out the moon and stars, she could see it now, and her breath caught in her throat, her heart skipping a beat before pounding harder than ever. \n\n\nMidoriya wasn\u2019t breathing. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEVERYONE, \n\nMOVE!\u201d \n\nIida shouted, shoving his way through the crowd that was his classmates and finally crashing down at Midoriya\u2019s side. Midoriya was as still as death, his face drained of all color (except for his lips, which were tinged blue), and Iida wasted no time, bending over and pressing his ear to his friend\u2019s unmoving chest. \n\n\nSilence. Nothing but silence. Midoriya\u2019s heartbeat just...\n\nwasn\u2019t there. \n\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Iida shouted, springing backwards. Around him, he was aware of his classmates shouting, his classmates \n\nsobbing, \n\nbut he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. His hands moved on their own, locking together and pushing down repeatedly on Midoriya\u2019s chest. \u00a0\n\n\nHe was unqualified, really; he\u2019d taken a basic CPR course when he was in junior high, but he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d actually have to \n\nuse it on somebody, \n\nlet alone a close friend. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014Three, four, five, six, seven\u2014\u201d \n\n\nHe was sure he was pushing down too hard. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014Ten, eleven, twelve\u2014\u201d \n\n\nWas it twelve? Had he already said that? He couldn\u2019t remember. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014T-Thirteen, fourteen, f-fifteen\u2014\u201d \n\n\nNothing. Nothing. Nothing. He felt something crack beneath his hands, but as much as it sickened him, he didn\u2019t stop. He \n\ncouldn\u2019t \n\nstop. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014S-Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, t-t-twenty\u2014\u201d \n\n\nNo use. No use. No use. \n\n\n\u201cT-Twenty one, t-twenty two, twenty three\u2014\u201d \n\n\nThe reality was finally beginning to sink in. \n\n\n\u201cT-Twenty four, twenty five, t-t-twenty six\u2014\u201d \n\n\nHis vision was blurring, his breath coming in quick gasps between clenched teeth. He hit thirty, did a quick mouth-to-mouth, and went right back to chest compressions. \n\n\n\u201cOne, t-two, three, four...come on, Midoriya, work with me...please...ten, eleven, t-twelve...come on, \n\ncome on\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nHe was desperate. He was oh so desperate, and he was beginning to feel lightheaded now, acid burning the back of his throat. Even so, Midoriya did not stir. He did not move. He did not \n\nbreathe. \n\n\n\nEveryone had been screaming and shouting earlier; now, they stood silent, \n\ntoo \n\nsilent, only able to watch on in horror. Iida ignored them, his attention zeroed in on one person and one person only. \n\n\n\u201cDammit, Midoriya, \n\nbreathe!\u201d \n\nIida finally snapped, the first of many tears streaming down his face. \n\n\u201cBreathe, \n\nMidoriya! \n\nMidoriya!!\u201d \n\n\n\nSomeone\u2014or, rather, a number of people\u2014were sobbing. Heck, \n\nhe \n\nwas sobbing, and he couldn\u2019t do this, he couldn\u2019t do this, \n\nhe couldn\u2019t do this, \n\nbut he kept on, he kept up the chest compressions, kept up the mouth-to-mouths, because his friend\u2019s life was in danger and he\u2019d rather \n\ndie \n\nthan give up now. \n\n\nSo he didn\u2019t. He was sobbing, his vision was blurring, his head was pounding, but he didn\u2019t give up. He couldn\u2019t give up now. There was no way\u2014just \n\nno way\n\n\u2014he was going to let Midoriya die like this. Not now and not ever. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taking too long, \n\nIida realized all too suddenly, as he started what had to be the sixth round of chest compressions. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be taking this long. Why is it taking so long? He should have had some sort of reaction by now\u2026\n\n\n\nIida paused, only for a second, and pressed two fingers to the pulse point on Midoriya\u2019s wrist. His hands were shaking\u2014no, his entire \n\nbody \n\nwas shaking, actually. \n\n\nNothing. \n\n\nHe blamed it on his shaking fingers and pressed his head to Midoriya\u2019s chest this time, listening. \n\n\nStill nothing. \n\n\nIida let out a short scream of frustration and went right back to the chest compressions, blind terror grasping his heart. From seemingly far away, he heard his friends sobbing, heard broken, whispered pleas and prayers: \n\n\n\u201cNo...there\u2019s no way...t-this isn\u2019t real\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t let this be real\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, \n\nnononono, \n\nthis c-can\u2019t...this can\u2019t be happening\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPlease, please, please, \n\nplease, \n\nd-don\u2019t...don\u2019t let him die\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get help!\u201d And, tripping and tumbling over unsteady feet, Mina broke out of the crowd, dashing madly down the mountainside. \n\n\nIida barely registered any of this, his mind and body occupied with trying to restart Midoriya\u2019s heart, trying to make him \n\nbreathe \n\nagain. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taking too long, \n\nhe realized again, but this time, the realization made a deeper impact, an impact which only served to bring more fear into Iida\u2019s panicked mind. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taking too long. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taking too long. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s taking too long. \n\n\n\nAnd then, even more terrifying: \n\n\n\nIt \n\nshouldn\u2019t \n\nbe taking this long. \n\n\n\nWas it too late? No, no, \n\nno, \n\nIida wasn\u2019t going to think that way, he \n\nwasn\u2019t, \n\nhe \n\nwasn\u2019t, \n\nhe \n\nwasn\u2019t, \n\nhe \n\ncouldn\u2019t, \n\nhe \n\ncouldn\u2019t, \n\nbecause the hope that he could save Midoriya was the only thing keeping him from completely losing his mind. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014Ten, eleven, twelve, t-thirteen\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be taking this long. \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014F-Fourteen, f-f-fifteen, s-sixteen\u2014d-dammit, Midoriya, p-please\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be taking this long. \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014E-Eightten, n-nineteen\u2014\n\nb-breathe, \n\nMidoriya, just \n\nbreathe\u2014!\u201d \n\n\n\n\nIs it too late? \n\n\n\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, please\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014T-T-Twenty one, twenty two, t-twenty three\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\n...Please, don\u2019t let it be too late. It can\u2019t be too late. It can\u2019t be too late. No, no, no, no, no, no\u2014\n\n\n\nSobbing; whispered pleas; desperate prayers; everyone hoping for the same thing, everyone afraid for the same reason. \n\n\n\nPlease\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Don\u2019t\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Don\u2019t take Midoriya. Don\u2019t take him away from us. \n\n\n\nIida\u2019s panic was breaking through, despite how hard he tried to hold it back, and suddenly, he didn\u2019t know what to do anymore, because \n\nhow long had he been doing this, and how long had Midoriya not responded to it? \n\n\n\n\u201cMIDORIYA!! \n\nBREATHE!!\u201d \n\nIida screamed finally, performing one final chest compression in a last ditch-effort to save him. \n\n\nAnd then\u2014somehow, \n\nmiraculously\n\n\u2014Midoriya coughed. \n\n\nHe coughed and hacked, his lungs expelling the water that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there, and Iida, still running on adrenaline and nothing more, turned Midoriya over on his side so he didn\u2019t choke again. Overwhelming relief suddenly engulfed Iida\u2019s entire frame, and he felt more dizzy than ever, black tainting the edges of his vision. He thumped Midoriya on the back once or twice, but other than that, was too relieved to move. \n\n\nAround him, his friends had released a collective sigh of relief; Hagakure fell backwards and had to be caught by Ojiro, and a few others looked ready to faint, and somewhere close by, Sero let out a sharp cry of \u201cMidoriya\u2014!\u201d, but Iida wasn\u2019t really focused on them. \n\n\nMidoriya\u2019s coughing and hacking went on for a while longer, and then, Iida wrapped his arms around his friend and pulled him into a tight embrace, letting Midoriya rest against his chest. He knew he\u2019d cracked at least \n\none \n\nof Midoriya\u2019s ribs, and that it would be easier to breathe if he wasn\u2019t lying flat. Midoriya was shivering, too, almost horribly, and Iida tried using his own body heat to help stimulate his friend\u2019s. The \n\nlast thing \n\nthey needed was for Midoriya to get hypothermia. \u00a0\n\n\nBut there was another reason Iida embraced Midoriya, a reason that seemed more real and true than the rest. \n\n\nHe needed it. He needed the confirmation that Midoriya was breathing, that his heart was beating again, that he was \n\nokay. \n\nHurt and freezing, maybe, but \n\nokay. \n\nOver time, Midoriya had become something of a little brother to Iida, and Iida...Iida had almost \n\nlost him. \n\n\n\nMidoriya coughed again, the sound harsh and wet, and Iida internally winced. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Midoriya,\u201d Iida murmured, \u201cit\u2019s alright, just breathe...keep breathing\u2026\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya was breathing again. He was \n\nbreathing. \n\nIida felt like cheering, felt like whooping, felt like exclaiming it to the world because \n\nMidoriya was alive, \n\nbut for now, he settled for just holding his friend tight and not letting go. \n\n\n\u201cI-I-Iida,\u201d Izuku gasped; his teeth were chattering, the word nothing more than a groggy croak, and Iida tightened the embrace, just slightly. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright now, Midoriya,\u201d Iida soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay now, you\u2019re safe\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t know who he was reassuring, himself or Midoriya, and he decided that it didn\u2019t matter. \n\n\nAll that mattered now was the fact that Midoriya was alive. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe tied up the villain now, he\u2019s unconscious!\u201d Kirishima hollered to the rest of the class, even though the villain seemed like a distant thing now after the horror of Midoriya\u2019s unmoving form. \u201cBakug\u014d\u2019s standing guard!\u201d \n\n\nYaoyorozu had resurfaced simultaneously with Midoriya\u2019s returned breath, dragging an unmoving, bloody villain behind her, wrapped tightly in chains. She\u2019d run off almost immediately to check on Midoriya, and since then, Bakug\u014d had stood vigil over the villain, never once moving, never once looking away.\n\n\n\u201cMina ran to get help, she\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d Kaminari informed, though it sounded more like he was reassuring himself. \u00a0\n\n\nHonestly, Kirishima was so horrified by all of this that he didn\u2019t really know what to think. The fact that Midoriya was underwater for so long, and then the fact that he \n\nwasn\u2019t breathing \n\neven after being on the surface again, and then Iida\u2019s desperation as he tried CPR, the fact that Midoriya \n\nhadn\u2019t responded \n\nto it for...how long? Ten minutes? Fifteen? Kirishima didn\u2019t know. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna die, villain,\u201d came Bakug\u014d\u2019s voice suddenly, and Kirishima whirled around in shock. Even after being Bakug\u014d classmate for so long, even after all the times he\u2019d heard Bakug\u014d angry, he had never, \n\never \n\nheard Bakug\u014d\u2019s voice sound as menacing as it did now. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna \n\ndie,\u201d \n\nBakug\u014d snarled, his hands balled into shaking fists at his sides. He was trembling. Trembling in \n\nanger. \n\n\u201cIf the law doesn\u2019t kill you, I swear, \n\nI will.\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was scary, actually, seeing Bakug\u014d like this, and the guy was already scary enough to begin with. And the scariest thing about it was that Kirishima had no doubt Bakug\u014d would carry out this threat. If justice didn\u2019t sentence the villain to death...Bakug\u014d definitely would. \n\n\n\u201c...Bakug\u014d,\u201d Kirishima said, reaching out and grasping Bakug\u014d\u2019s shoulder; Bakug\u014d jerked away instantly. \u201cDude\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHe needs to die,\u201d Bakug\u014d growled, sparks flying from his fists. \u201cHe needs to \n\nsuffer.\u201d \n\n\n\nKirishima only nodded. He couldn\u2019t deny that he felt the same way. \u201cI get it, man, I get it,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cTrust me, the villain isn\u2019t going to get away with this. No matter what.\u201d \n\n\nBakug\u014d stared at the unconscious, unmoving villain. He said nothing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSato rarely felt anger, and by \u201canger\u201d be meant red hot \n\nfury \n\nthat took over the better-thinking part of his mind and made him want to punch something\u2014behavior that could only be compared to Bakug\u014d. But this time, Sato was sure his anger was justified, because his classmate, his comrade, his \n\nfriend \n\nhad been \n\nhurt \n\nand almost\n\n killed \n\nby this villain, and if Sato\u2019s hatred wasn\u2019t justified\n\n, \n\nhe didn\u2019t know what was. \n\n\nHe tried to play it off like it was nothing, but that was hard to do. It wasn\u2019t until Koda put a hand on his shoulder and silently shook his head that Sato calmed down\u2014just slightly, of course, because \n\ncalm \n\nwas the last thing \n\nanyone \n\nwas. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t have the chance to say anything; Ochako ran past him, a loud cry of \u201cDeku!!\u201d on her lips, and Sato was reminded that the villain wasn\u2019t what they should be worrying about right now. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOchako was so scared she felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe. Her heart was pounding almost \n\nviciously, \n\nlike a caged feral animal trying to escape, and adrenaline made her dizzy. She ran, finally crashing to her knees at Iida\u2019s side. \n\n\nDeku was pale. He was so, so, so pale, and it scared her even more. His chest rose and fell shakily, and his breaths came in short, shuddering gasps. It sounded painful. \n\n\n\u201cD-Deku, I-I was...I was so \n\nscared,\u201d \n\nOchako whimpered, her voice cracking pathetically, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Even though she was relieved now, even though he was alive and breathing again, she couldn\u2019t shake the terror she\u2019d felt when Tsuyu resurfaced with a definitely \n\nnot\n\n breathing Deku. \n\n\nDeku looked at her, pain and exhausted ebbed deep into his eyes, but regardless, he smiled at her. A small, broken smile, but an honest one, from his heart. \u201cS-Sorry,\u201d he murmured\u2014and then, his breath hitched, and he launched into a very painful-sounding fit of coughs. \n\n\nOchako reached out, but didn\u2019t actually touch him, unsure of what to do. Iida, meanwhile, tightened his grip around Deku, running his hand across his friend\u2019s back. Eventually\u2014and it felt like it took an eternity\u2014Deku stopped coughing, but his breathing sounded worse now, something rattling in his chest whenever he exhaled. \n\n\n\u201cStop talking for now, Midoriya,\u201d Iida told him, as though reading Ochako\u2019s mind. \u201cYou just focus on breathing, alright? We\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d \n\n\nDeku nodded shakily, closing his eyes and falling limp against Iida. \n\n\n\u201cHere, I made a thermometer,\u201d Yaoyorozu said suddenly, kneeling beside Ochako with said device (she had exchanged her wet clothes for dry ones, Ochako noticed). It was a temple-scan thermometer, which Yaoyorozu proceeded to press against Deku\u2019s forehead. The device beeped, and Yaoyorozu withdrew it, checking over the reading. \n\n\n\u201cThirty-three degrees, celsius,\u201d was Deku\u2019s current temperature according to Yaoyorozu, and Ochako knew in an instant that that wasn\u2019t good. That was a lot lower than it should\u2019ve been, and Ochako now noticed just how badly Deku was shivering, his teeth clattering together constantly. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHis lips are blue,\u201d Iida commented, his voice shaking ever so slightly (Ochako made a mental note to thank him later, for not giving up even when it seemed hopeless). \n\n\nYaoyorozu bit her lip, a combination of worry and fear in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s borderlining hypothermia,\u201d she stated quietly, more to herself than anything, though Iida and Ochako both heard her. \n\n\nOchako reached out again, this time brushing her fingers against Deku\u2019s pale cheek. Instantly, she withdrew her hand with a sharp cry of shock. His skin was like \n\nice. \n\n\u201cO-Oh my gosh,\u201d she breathed, horrified, staring down at her hand, \u201ch-he\u2019s freezing\u2026\u201d \n\n\nAnd he was. He was absolutely \n\nfreezing, \n\nand it was scary. Yaoyorozu had mentioned hypothermia; what if Deku got sick, on top of all of this? And hypothermia was serious, too. It was bad. This was bad. This was all very, very bad\u2014\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d came Iida\u2019s voice suddenly, an urgency in his tone that hadn\u2019t been there before. \u201cMidoriya?\u201d \n\n\nOchako\u2019s gaze shifted from her hand to Iida, and then to Deku. He was crying. \n\nCrying, \n\ntears streaming down his pale face, and something in Ochako\u2019s chest clenched and broke\u2014her heart, she concluded. \n\n\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m back,\u201d Deku murmured through chattering teeth, and it could have just been her imagination, but Ochako was pretty sure she saw a small, fragile smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019m \n\nb-b-back...\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re home,\u201d Iida reassured him quickly, no doubt trying to keep Deku from dissolving into hysterics. \u201cYou\u2019re home now, we\u2019ve got you. It\u2019s alright now.\u201d \n\n\nDeku didn\u2019t say anything else, just shut his eyes, a look of contentment settling on his face. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHere, let me see him,\u201d Todoroki said, his voice low yet demanding both at once, and he knelt beside Ochako, holding out his arms towards Iida. Iida caught on quickly, and he gently\u2014very, very gently\u2014handed Midoriya over to him. Instantly, Todoroki wound his arms around his shivering friend and carefully activated his fire-related Quirk, enough to heat his skin but not enough to set anything aflame. \n\n\nMidoriya stirred and cracked his eyes open, exhausted and confused. \u201cT-T-Todoroki,\u201d he croaked. \n\n\nTodoroki \n\nreally \n\ndidn\u2019t like the way Midoriya was shivering, so he held tighter, desperately trying to bring some heat back into his friend\u2019s pallid skin. \u201cLet me know if it gets too hot, alright?\u201d Todoroki told him. He was still trying to get a handle on his left side, and he\u2019d \n\nhate \n\nhimself if he ended up burning Midoriya after all he\u2019d just been through. \n\n\nMidoriya nodded up at him shakily and closed his eyes again. Todoroki let out a long sigh and shut his eyes likewise, his thoughts racing. \n\n\nWhen Tsuyu had dragged Midoriya\u2019s unmoving body from the depths, honestly, Todoroki\u2019s mind just...went blank. He hadn\u2019t known what to do, what to think, what to \n\nfeel; \n\nhe could only watch on as Iida began CPR, as Ochako sobbed, as Yaoyorozu resurfaced with the unconscious villain, as Midoriya finally\u2014blessedly\u2014started breathing again. \n\n\nAnd now, the reality of what had just happened was sinking in, and he tightened his grip around Midoriya. \n\n\nBefore now, Todoroki hadn\u2019t had friends. People he\u2019d met when he was little and in gradeschool had only wanted to be his friends because his dad was a \u201csuper cool hero,\u201d and whenever Todoroki asked his father if he could go meet with anyone on the weekends, his father\u2019s answer was always the same: \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time. You have a duty, Sh\u014dto. You don\u2019t have time for such \n\nnormal \n\nactivities.\u201d \n\n\nBut now, Todoroki had friends, true, honest \n\nfriends, \n\nand, well\u2026\n\n...He\u2019d almost lost one of them. He\u2019d almost lost the friend who\u2019d done so much for him during the Sports Festival. He\u2019d almost lost the friend who had saved Todoroki from himself. \n\nIt seriously horrified him. It seriously, seriously \n\nhorrified him. \n\n\n\nHe noticed now\u2014and he\u2019d been too entranced in his thoughts to notice before\u2014that Midoriya\u2019s tremors had stopped, that his teeth had ceased chattering. Todoroki sighed in relief. At least Midoriya wouldn\u2019t have to deal with hypothermia on top of everything else\u2026\n\n\n\u201cHe should be alright now,\u201d Todoroki told Iida, Yaoyorozu and Ochako, who were all kneeling nearby. \u201cHe stopped shivering a while ago.\u201d \n\n\nYaoyorozu suddenly perked up, and she ran her hand along her forearm. \u201cHere!\u201d she said, using her Quirk and constructing a quick, thick blanket, which she then proceeded to drape over Midoriya. Afterwards, she took the thermometer from earlier and swiped it across his forehead. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHis temperature\u2019s rising again,\u201d she breathed, closing her eyes briefly and letting out a long, shaky sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cGee, that was...that was terrifying,\u201d Sero shuddered; it was only now that Todoroki noticed him and a few others standing nearby. \n\n\n\u201cHoly crap, Midoriya,\u201d Kirishima said, kneeling down and ruffling Midoriya\u2019s damp hair gently (his hair and clothing had dried considerably thanks to Todoroki\u2019s Quirk). \u201cDon\u2019t you do that again, \u2018kay, dude?\u201d Kirishima went on, and though he was smiling, Todoroki could tell he was seriously shaken up by all of this. \u201cThat was seriously horrifying.\u201d\n\n\nMidoriya didn\u2019t respond this time, but he \n\ndid \n\nsmile faintly. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMina was a fast runner. Iida was faster, of course, but when she\u2019d volunteered to run and get help, Iida had been preoccupied. \n\n\nSo Mina ran, tripping and tumbling over her own feet more times than she wished to count. The cold air stung every inch of her skin that wasn\u2019t covered by clothing, but she didn\u2019t care. She \n\ncouldn\u2019t \n\ncare, not when her classmate was in such dire need of help. \n\n\nThey\u2019d hiked up to the mountain for survival training, to see how well each student adapted to a cold, high-altitude environment. Two other teachers, namely Aizawa and All Might, remained at a large log-cabin at the base of the mountain. That was where she was running to. \n\n\nHer phone wasn\u2019t getting any service all the way up here, or else she would\u2019ve just called for help, but as that wasn\u2019t an option, running was the best she could do, and she did it, pouring every ounce of her strength into every stride. \n\n\nShe had to hurry. She had to hurry, or it would be too late. \n\n\nWhen she reached the cabin, she didn\u2019t have the chance to slow down, and the momentum carried her forward, slamming her straight into the closed door. She hit the ground in a heap, holding her head briefly in pain. \n\n\nThe door swung open. \u201cAshido? What are you doing back?\u201d came Aizawa\u2019s brooding voice from above her, and Mina suddenly remembered why she was here, why she\u2019d poured so much energy into running all this way down the mountain. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nShe shot to her feet, panic replacing pain. \u201c\u201cW-W-We were attacked b-by a villain!\u201d she screamed, her voice cracking. Aizawa\u2019s eyes widened, and behind him, All Might\u2019s did as well. \u201cA-And, w-we c-couldn\u2019t...I-I\u2026\u201d \n\n\nPanic overrode her system. She couldn\u2019t think clearly anymore. \n\n\n\u201cAshido, what happened?\u201d Aizawa asked her demandingly, but there was a slight edge to his voice that gave away his fear. \n\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019s Midori!\u201d Mina shrieked. \u201cI-I-I mean, Midoriya! H-He...oh, oh my \n\ngosh...\n\nh-h-he...h-he was d-dragged underwater, a-and, a-a-and l-last I checked h-he...h-he...\n\nhe wasn\u2019t breathing\u2014!\u201d \n\n\n\nShe was hyperventilating now, and she couldn\u2019t help it, because Midoriya had been so \n\nmotionless \n\nand \n\nlifeless \n\nand \n\nstill \n\nand \n\npale \n\nand\u2014\n\n\nAll Might\u2019s hands landed on her shoulders, and she looked into his eyes. \u201cYoung Ashido,\u201d he said, his voice surprisingly steady, and she was certain it was just for her sake. \u201cCalm down. Take us there.\u201d \n\n\nAnd Mina nodded feverishly, already pivoting and racing back towards the way from whence she\u2019d come, her teachers sprinting in her wake. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAizawa had been against the whole survival training thing from the start for a number of reasons. One, he thought it was too soon and that they should be at least second years before attempting something like this, two, because there was no phone, radio, or \n\nany \n\nform of reception up in the mountains (which meant that the teachers had no way of monitoring the students\u2019 progress), and three, because, \n\nwhy? \n\n\n\nBut, apparently, the principal hadn\u2019t shared his opinions and thought it was best for the students to learn how to survive on their own as quickly as possible. \n\n\nAizawa should have added \n\npotential death of student \n\nas one of his opinions. Maybe the principal would\u2019ve called this whole stupid thing off if he had. But now his student was hurt, or rather \n\nnot breathing \n\naccording to Ashido, and Aizawa hated himself for not pushing his point further to the principal. \n\n\nAizawa tended to give his students a hard time, but in reality, he cared about each and every one of them individually, sort of like a father, even though he probably wouldn\u2019t admit that to anyone (including himself). They were all good kids, and somehow, they\u2019d become \n\nprecious \n\nto Aizawa, each one of them having a special place in his heart reserved specifically for them, and now\u2026\n\n\n...And now \n\nMidoriya\u2026\n\n\n\nHe ran faster, as fast as he could without getting ahead of Ashido, who was leading their way. Through it all, he only hoped that somehow, \n\nsomehow, \n\nMidoriya was alright. \u00a0\n\n\nBecause Aizawa wasn\u2019t quite sure what he\u2019d do if he wasn\u2019t. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll Might didn\u2019t know what to think about any of this. His mind was completely \n\nblank, \n\nand his legs moved on their own, like they were working in overdrive, although he had no conscious control over them. \n\n\nMidoriya. Something had happened to Midoriya. He didn\u2019t want to think about it, but Young Ashido had said so, and she\u2019d been absolutely \n\nhysteric \n\nas she tried to explain what was going on, and that wasn\u2019t a good sign. Ashido was usually very level-headed and flexible; for something to scare her so \n\nthoroughly \n\nlike this\u2026\n\n\nThey climbed the mountain without faltering even once, and All Might could see dark shapes just up ahead. A lot of them, actually, and not shapes, but people. The students of Class 1-A. \n\n\n\u201cI got help!\u201d Ashido shouted, her fear and panic still very evident in her voice. \u201cHow\u2019s Midoriya!?\u201d \n\n\nThat was the real question: was Midoriya okay?\n\n\nKaminari intercepted them, looking shaken but not disheartened. \u201cIida got him breathing again,\u201d Kaminari told them, his voice wavering only slightly. \u201cHe\u2019s alright now.\u201d \n\n\nThat was a relief, but it wasn\u2019t enough. While Mina stayed behind to catch her breath, Aizawa and All Might raced forward, towards the center of the commotion. Kneeling on the ground in a small semi-circle were Ochako, Yaoyorozu, Iida, and Todoroki. Yaoyorozu was wrapping a blanket around Iida\u2019s shoulders, and Todoroki had his arms around a pale, unmoving Midoriya. \n\n\nAll Might sucked in a sharp breath, the sight not one he was ready for. Midoriya\u2019s breath rattled painfully in his chest, and his skin was a horrible pale, though there seemed to be a small bit of color returning to his cheeks. \n\n\nAccording to Ashido, Midoriya hadn\u2019t been breathing, and according to Kaminari, it was Iida who saved him, it was Iida who had to \n\nmake Midoriya breathe again, \n\nand it felt so \n\nwrong \n\nand \n\nhorrible \n\nthat All Might didn\u2019t want to think about it, not now and not ever. \n\n\n\u201cEveryone, back to the cabin,\u201d Aizawa said with forced professionalism, and All Might was glad for Aizawa\u2019s level-headedness in times like these. \u201cWe have to get Midoriya someplace he can be properly looked over. We can\u2019t stay here.\u201d And then, he turned to Bakug\u014d, standing a little ways off. \u201cLeave the villain to me, I\u2019ll take care of him...\u201d \u00a0\n\n\nThe rest of the students, shaken and terrified thought they were, heeded their teacher\u2019s words and assembled together, ready to head back down the mountain. The only exceptions to this were Ochako, Todoroki, Iida, Yaoyorozu, and of course Midoriya. \n\n\nAll Might knelt in front of Todoroki and held out his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll take him from here,\u201d All Might said. \u201cThank you, Young Todoroki.\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki didn\u2019t seem certain, but he didn\u2019t hesitate to hand Midoriya over. Midoriya\u2019s clothes were dry, All Might noticed, probably thanks to Todoroki\u2019s Quirk, and once All Might had his student securely in his arms, he rose to his feet. \n\n\n\u201cHis ribs,\u201d Iida suddenly gasped out of nowhere, an urgency filling his eyes. \u201cI-I broke some of his ribs, I-I think.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be careful, Young Iida,\u201d All Might told him, looking the class representative straight in the eyes. \u201cYou were very brave today. Thank you.\u201d \n\n\nIida swallowed thickly. Didn\u2019t say anything. Ochako helped him to his feet, and they, along with Yaoyorozu and Todoroki, joined the others. \n\n\nAll Might made to follow, taking extreme caution as to not jostle his student any more than he had to. Even so, Midoriya stirred slightly and cracked his eyes open a sliver, looking up with a combination of confusion and relief. \n\n\n\u201cA-All M-Might\u2026\u201d Midoriya murmured, and then, he coughed harshly and raggedly. All Might internally winced, tightening his grip as much as he dared. He \n\nreally \n\ndidn\u2019t like the sound of those coughs\u2026\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Young Midoriya,\u201d All Might said, not just to Midoriya, but to himself as well. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. It\u2019s alright.\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya looked dazedly up at him for another moment or two, and then, his eyes closed, and his breathing, though shallow, evened out. \n\n\nOnce everyone was ready, they began their plight down the mountain\u2019s face, towards their sanctuary. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJust because Aizawa told Bakug\u014d that he would take care of the villain didn\u2019t mean that Bakug\u014d couldn\u2019t keep an eye on the villain, because he did. He watched that monster like a frickin\u2019 \n\nhawk, \n\nalmost \n\ndaring \n\nhim to try any funny business. \n\n\nBakug\u014d was angry. Really, really, \n\nreally \n\nangry. He wanted to punch something (or, moreover, punch that frickin\u2019 villain\u2019s stupid little \n\nface \n\nin), but obviously, as much as he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t do that. At least not while Aizawa was watching. \n\n\n\u201cBakug\u014d, you need to calm down,\u201d Aizawa told him, dragging the villain by one of Yaoyorozu\u2019s chains. \u201cThe villain isn\u2019t going to get away with this.\u201d \n\n\nBakug\u014d gritted his teeth, his fingernails digging into his palms. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Bakug\u014d snarled. \u201cJust \u2018getting put on death row\u2019 isn\u2019t enough.\u201d \n\n\nAIzawa glanced at Bakug\u014d over his shoulder, then sighed. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d said Aizawa. \u201cI feel the same way. But, unfortunately\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah, the \n\nlaw, \n\nI get it,\u201d growled Bakug\u014d, though he wasn\u2019t pleased with it. \n\n\nDeku was an idiot, granted, a helpless, worthless \n\nidiot, \n\nbut he was a helpless, worthless idiot that Bakug\u014d had grown up with, probably the closest thing to a \u201cfriend\u201d that Bakug\u014d had (although he wouldn\u2019t admit this to anyone\u2014including himself). \n\n\nHe\u2019d deny it until the ends of the world, but yes, he cared about Deku, just like he cared about his other loser classmates. \n\n\nAnd anyone that messed with \n\nany \n\nof them was going to pay. Bakug\u014d swore it. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShoji didn\u2019t know Midoriya well whatsoever, but he\u2019d been a member of Class 1-A long enough to know Midoriya\u2019s (as well as everyone else\u2019s) characteristics. One of the first things Shoji learned about Midoriya was that he was selfless, selfless to a \n\nfault \n\nalmost, and that assumption was only made all the more clear after today\u2019s events. \u00a0\n\n\nAnd while Shoji didn\u2019t know Midoriya well, he suddenly felt an urge of protectiveness, like that of an older brother, whenever he noticed just how \n\nlimp \n\nMidoriya was in All Might\u2019s arms. Shoji could tell that Bakug\u014d and Sato shared this righteous anger, and he knew, just by looking around, that anyone who messed with Midoriya after this was going to have a hell to pay. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe log cabin was a large, sturdy structure, with a open main floor with a fireplace and couches and two separate rooms in the upper floor, one for the girls to sleep in and one for the boys to sleep in. Once they arrived at the cabin, Midoriya was laid on the couch nearest to the fireplace, where he remained dead to the world. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get some blankets!\u201d Sero offered immediately, and he bolted upstairs before anyone could stop him. \n\n\n\u201cHey, wait up! I\u2019ll help!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed, sprinting after him, and soon after, so did Kaminari, even though it really only took one student to grab a few spare blankets. \n\n\n\nThat sounds like it could be the start of a joke or something, \n\nOjiro thought, quite against his own will. \n\nHow many U.A. students does it take to get a couple of blankets from upstairs? Just one, but everyone insists on helping anyways. \n\n\n\nIt was lame, sure, but Ojiro needed \n\nsomething\n\n lighthearted to keep his mind off what he and the rest of his classmates had just witnessed. \n\n\nHe and Midoriya weren\u2019t super close friends or anything, but they\u2019d gotten to know each other a bit more over the Sports Festival, and Ojiro could honestly call Midoriya a good friend, someone he respected and trusted indisputably. \n\n\nAnd to see Midoriya, unmoving and \n\nlifeless \n\nlike that was just\u2026\n\n\n...It was too much. Ojiro never wanted to see \n\nany \n\nof his classmates in such a state, not now and not ever again. He was pretty sure he\u2019d never be over this, that it\u2019d continue to haunt him for the rest of his life. \n\n\n\u201cWE\u2019VE GOT THE BLANKETS!!\u201d chorused Kirishima, Kaminari, and Sero all at once as they tripped and tumbled down the stairs in their haste, followed by them draping one, two, three, four, five blankets over the dozing Midoriya. \n\n\nOjiro took in a deep, shaky breath and let it out slowly. \n\n\nMidoriya was alive now. That was all that mattered. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try getting in contact with the school,\u201d Aizawa informed All Might, but Kaminari and the rest of the students heard him plain as day. \u201cThe weather conditions are deteriorating, though, so we may have to wait until morning.\u201d \n\n\nAfter that, Aizawa left, leaving behind All Might and the rest of the 1-A students in his wake. All Might stood there for a moment or two, doing nothing\u2014and then, he clapped his hands together and turned towards the remaining students. \n\n\n\u201cWell...I believe it\u2019s best for you all to get to bed,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI\u2019ll watch over Young Midoriya for now\u2014\u201d \n\n\nKaminari\u2019s hand shot into the air immediately. \u201cSensei!\u201d \n\n\nAll Might turned towards him. \u201cYes?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-If it\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d Kaminari paused momentarily, trying to find the words. When he \n\ndid \n\nfind them, he raised his head proudly and proclaimed them for all to hear: \u201cI\u2019d like to stay and help you watch over Midoriya!\u201d \n\n\nAll Might didn\u2019t seem at all surprised by this; however, that didn\u2019t mean he agreed. \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you went through a lot today. It may be better if\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d Sato said, also raising his hand, \u201cbut I would like to stay with Midoriya as well!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI second that!\u201d said Kirishima, waving his hand high above his head, looking like a total idiot in the process. \u201cMidoriya\u2019s my buddy, y\u2019know? How can I call myself his friend if I don\u2019t look after him?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a runner!\u201d offered Sero, his hand shooting into the air. \u201cIf anything happens or if you need anything, I\u2019ll get it! I want to do my part and help out, too!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll watch the frickin\u2019 villain,\u201d snarled Bakug\u014d. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya\u2019s our friend!\u201d said Hagakure, her voice wavering. \u201cIf I can help him, I want to!\u201d \n\n\nKoda said nothing, but he nodded in agreement, raising his hand shyly. \n\n\nKaminari felt the same way. He didn\u2019t consider himself a very \n\nbrave \n\nperson, which was why he admired Midoriya so much. Midoriya, jumping in there to save Jiro like he did, even when he \n\nknew \n\nit would cost him dearly...honestly, Kaminari was envious of his courage, of his bravery. He wanted to be like Midoriya, wanted to be the kind of person who wouldn\u2019t hesitate when it came to saving a friend, a classmate, or even a stranger. \n\n\nThat, and, like Kirishima said. Midoriya was also Kaminari\u2019s \n\nfriend. \n\nNot \n\nclose \n\nfriend, but \n\nfriend \n\nnonetheless. \n\n\nAll Might looked to each student in turn, then sighed in defeat. \u201cI should have known,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, alright. You can watch over Midoriya, but you have to work in shifts. Those who are \n\nnot \n\ncurrently on their shift will sleep. Understood?\u201d \n\n\nKaminari snapped up his hand in salute, as did a few others. They could do this. They could look after their friend. \n\n\nAfter all, Midoriya always looked after them. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo one slept that night. It was a common, well-known though unspoken fact amongst the students. Although nobody slept, nobody \n\ntalked \n\nto each other, either. They just laid in silence, staring up at the oaken ceiling. \n\n\nAoyama had always thought Midoriya was insane. Truly, honestly insane, and he didn\u2019t mean that as an insult, either. After all, it took a special kind of person to make the sacrifices Midoriya made, to go to such lengths just to save someone. Midoriya was insane, yes, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t admirable, because he was. Midoriya\u2019s insane amounts of courage and bravery and selflessness and compassion were something that Aoyama hadn\u2019t really seen before starting U.A. \n\n\nBut, while he admired Midoriya\u2019s character, the heart of gold he possessed, Aoyama found himself wishing Midoriya was a bit \n\nless \n\nselfless. Not by much, but just enough so that he didn\u2019t throw away his life so willingly. \n\n\nBecause that was the problem: if a villain literally told him \n\nI\u2019m going to shoot your friend you have five seconds to jump in front of them, \n\nthere was no way Midoriya would do anything but. \n\n\nAnd that was scary. His selflessness was scary. Admirable, but scary. \n\n\nThe door creaked open; Kaminari returned, and Tokoyami left for his shift. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTokoyami hadn\u2019t felt that kind of unbridled terror since...well...since \n\nnever.\n\n He\u2019d felt terror before, like at the USJ attack, but that didn\u2019t come even \n\nremotely \n\nclose to the terror he\u2019d felt seeing Midoriya pale, breathless, and unmoving as Iida fought to save him. \n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t something to be easily overlooked or forgotten. \n\n\nTokoyami took the third shift (Ochako first, Kaminari second), while the rest of the students were upstairs trying (and probably failing) to fall asleep. All Might had said something about making tea in case Midoriya woke up and left for the kitchen, leaving Tokoyami alone with Midoriya. \n\n\nDark Shadow was just as distressed as Tokoyami about this whole ordeal, and the shadowy shape-shifter appeared periodically, patting Tokoyami comfortingly on the head (a gesture which Tokoyami returned) or nuzzling Midoriya\u2019s shoulder. All the while, Midoriya didn\u2019t stir even once. \n\n\nIida, Ochako, and Todoroki had tried taking the first shifts, but the former and latter were shot down pretty quickly by their classmates. \n\n\n\u201cIida, come on,\u201d Kirishima had said, shaking his head. \u201cI get you\u2019re worried, but you\u2019ve gotta rest, man. You performed CPR for...gah, I don\u2019t know \n\nhow \n\nlong, but it was a while. You\u2019ll end up hurting yourself if you keep this up.\u201d \n\n\nAnd Todoroki hadn\u2019t exactly looked himself, either, which made sense (\n\nno one \n\nwas looking like themselves at the time being), and although it took some convincing, Todoroki had eventually agreed to taking a shift a little later on in the evening. \n\n\nTokoyami sat in silence for a while, listening to the fireplace crackle in the background, before he sighed heavily, looking at his classmate. Midoriya hadn\u2019t woken even once since being brought here, and Tokoyami wasn\u2019t surprised or startled by this at all. He didn\u2019t want to imagine the kind of stress Midoriya\u2019s body had been under today. \n\n\nIf anyone had earned the right to sleep, it was him. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMidoriya was so \n\ncool! \n\nThat was the only thing Mineta could think. Of course, he\u2019d been just as scared as the next person when Tsuyu had reemerged with a practically \n\ndead \n\nMidoriya, and it wasn\u2019t until Iida revived him that Mineta could truly breathe freely again. \n\n\nAnd the conclusion he came to regarding today was always the same: Midoriya was amazing. Everyone had seen it; he\u2019d leapt in to save Jiro when he noticed the villain in the water. Mineta tried to put himself in Midoriya\u2019s shoes and asked himself the question, \n\nWould I have saved someone if I knew it could cost me my life? \n\n\n\nOf course, to others, he\u2019d probably boast that \n\nYes, of course I\u2019d do the same! \n\nbut when he thought about it, when he was honest with himself, he knew that no, he wouldn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nWhy do you have to be so cool, Midoriya? \n\nMineta wondered silently, as he and his classmates tried in vain to fall asleep. Mineta didn\u2019t get his answer, of course, and a little while later, Tokoyami returned, and Sero left for his shift. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s in pain,\u201d Sero murmured with a frown; he and All Might sat on a couch opposite of Midoriya\u2019s. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s his ribs? Iida mentioned cracking some of them...\u201d\n\n\nAdmittedly, Sero was a bit worried for Iida\u2019s state of mind. After all, it wasn\u2019t every day you spent \n\nover ten minutes \n\ntrying to revive your friend with CPR. Sero didn\u2019t even want to \n\nthink \n\nabout what Iida was feeling. \n\n\nAll Might nodded shortly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d he said, and then, he got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll get an ice pack from the kitchen.\u201d \n\n\nSero nodded, and All Might left. That was another thing; All Might had been on edge, \n\nseriously \n\non edge, and though Sero could tell he was trying to be strong for the rest of the students, he was just as shaken up as the rest of them. \n\n\nIf Sero was completely honest, he felt kinda...\n\nnumb, \n\nabout this whole thing. Like it hadn\u2019t actually happened. He\u2019d been so terrified and horrified earlier, almost to an \n\nimpossible \n\ndegree, and now, although he\u2019d accepted the reality, he still felt...\n\ndetached. \n\nAnd he knew it was dumb, because the events had \n\nobviously \n\nhappened, but still. \n\n\n\u201c...Midoriya\u2026\u201d Sero sighed heavily, shaking his head. \u201c...I get that you want to protect us, but \n\ndang, \n\nman, could you think about your own safety every now and then?\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya, of course, didn\u2019t answer, and Sero hadn\u2019t really been expecting him to. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIce?\u201d Hagakure asked when she began her shift. \u201cA-Are...are you sure that\u2019s a good idea? Everyone was talking about hypothermia\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s well out of the woods in that respect,\u201d was All Might\u2019s answer; he was carefully pressing an ice pack against Midoriya\u2019s ribcage. \u201cThis is just to help numb the pain so he can sleep a little more soundly.\u201d \n\n\nHagakure nodded feverishly, feeling a bit dumb for questioning it. \u00a0\n\n\nShe\u2019d actually fainted earlier once or twice, the first time being when the realization that \n\nMidoriya wasn\u2019t breathing \n\nsank in and the second time being when Midoriya finally started breathing again. \n\n\nIt\u2019d been horrible. Absolutely horrible. And terrifying. Really, truly terrifying. She\u2019d been scared, \n\nreally \n\nscared, more scared than she\u2019d ever been in her entire life. Not even the battle at the USJ held a candle to this. \n\n\n\u201cD-Do...do you need any help?\u201d Hagakure offered. .\n\n\nAfter a moment or two, All Might nodded. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, passing the ice pack to her. \u201cWould you mind putting some more ice in this?\u201d \n\n\nHagakure nodded eagerly, took it, and bounded off. She\u2019d do whatever she could to help her classmate. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEventually\u2014and it really \n\nwas \n\neventually\u2014the students were all upstairs and (hopefully) sleeping, and Aizawa finally gave up on trying to contact the school. The weather here was unpredictable, and the phone lines were currently down; he\u2019d have to wait until morning before he was able to send for help. \n\n\nAizawa stepped into the main room, a clipboard in hand (he was currently filing a report on what had happened for the police) and frowned, crossing his arms over his chest and leaning idly against the doorframe. \n\n\n\u201cGo to bed,\u201d Aizawa said.\n\n\nAll Might didn\u2019t so much as look up. \u201cNo. I\u2019d like to watch over him.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any time left,\u201d Aizawa said, and All Might flinched, just slightly\u2014just slightly enough to confirm Aizawa\u2019s suspicion. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll take care of Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\nAll Might looked at him, then shifted his gaze to his student, and finally rose to his feet. \u201cIf something happens\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Aizawa said, unwavering. \u201cGo.\u201d \n\n\nAnd All Might did, though very reluctantly, and Aizawa crossed the room, taking a seat on the edge of the couch beside where Midoriya was sleeping. The boy still had yet to stir, not that Aizawa was super surprised by this. The human body could withstand a lot of things, but literally \n\ndrowning \n\nwas something that would take a bit more time to recover from. \n\n\nIt was another hour or two before Midoriya stirred, but he didn\u2019t fully wake up; just launched into a fit of harsh, grating coughs. Aizawa set his clipboard aside and helped him sit up, holding him steady until it passed. \n\n\n\nHopefully he doesn\u2019t end up with a lung infection\u2026\n\n Aizawa frowned, then sighed heavily, wrapping an arm around Midoriya\u2019s trembling shoulders and letting him rest his head on Aizawa\u2019s shoulder. \n\n\nHow these students had found a way into his heart was beyond him, but Aizawa decided it didn\u2019t really matter. Somehow or another, all twenty of them had, and Aizawa resolved to look after them, as a father would look after his children. \n\n\nMaybe he\u2019d gone soft. \n\n\nHe decided that didn\u2019t really matter, either. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy the next morning, the wind had cleared, and Aizawa was finally able to contact the emergency services. He explained the situation, asked for a paramedic, and hung up, phoning the school a moment later to inform the principal. \n\n\nThe students were awake before the sunrise, and since there was no reason for them to try going back to sleep, they remained downstairs, gathering in the main room where Midoriya still slept. \n\n\n\u201cThe paramedics should be here soon,\u201d Aizawa informed them. \u201cThey\u2019ll take Midoriya in an ambulance. The rest of us will be taking the bus home.\u201d \n\n\nThe students looked at each other briefly, saying nothing. \n\n\nAfter everything they\u2019d been through yesterday, the panic just...\n\ndied down. \n\nIt was weird, how they could be so horrified and terrified one moment and the next moment be...\n\nokay. \n\nBecause everything was \n\nokay \n\nnow. \n\n\nThe medics arrived sooner than anyone had thought, and as soon as they loaded Midoriya into the ambulance and started back towards the city, Class 1-A and their teachers did likewise, loading up into the bus they\u2019d come in and starting down the long road. \n\n\nThe hospital was their first stop, naturally, and they arrived long after the ambulance did. The doctor explained that, yes, Midoriya had broken a few ribs, but that he was healing nicely, doctors with medical-related Quirks kickstarting the recovery. He also explained that it was quite odd and miraculous; despite nearly \n\ndrowning, \n\nthe broken ribs was all Midoriya had to show for it. Otherwise, he was fine. \n\n\nNo one cared, though. Freak thing, unexplainable abnormality, \u201cood,\u201d \u201cmiraculous\u201d...none of it mattered. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter \n\nhow \n\nMidoriya was okay. \n\n\nIt just mattered that he \n\nwas \n\nokay. \n\n\nBecause as long as \n\nhe \n\nwas okay, his friends were okay, too. \n\n\nIt was a bad idea. \n\n\nIzuku knew it, he \n\nknew\n\n it was a bad idea, but he did it anyways. And the real problem was, he\u2019d assured everyone else\u2014namely his teachers and a few of his classmates\u2014that it was definitely \n\nnot \n\na bad idea, that he would be fine. \n\n\nIt was stupid. It was \n\nstupid. \n\nNot that he hadn\u2019t told anyone it was a \n\nbad idea, \n\nbut \n\nbecause \n\nthis was a bad idea. It was just something simple, something each student had to do during Rescue Training at the USJ. It was simple: dive towards the bottom of the Shipwreck Zone and retrieve a ring. That was all. It was simple. It was so simple it was \n\nstupid. \n\n\n\nAll Might had asked him ahead of time if he thought he would be okay with it, and that he could sit out if he thought it would bring back any unwanted memories, but Izuku had promised that, yes, he\u2019d be \n\nfine, \n\nthat it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, because at the time of All Might\u2019s inquiry, he \n\nhadn\u2019t \n\nthought it would be a problem. \n\n\nBut the instant his body became fully submerged in the water, he realized the truth. \n\n\nIt was a bad idea. Probably the worst idea he\u2019d ever had. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, \n\nhe told himself repeatedly, kicking his legs and making towards the bottom of the Zone. \n\nYou\u2019re fine, you\u2019re fine. Just stay calm, stay calm, stay calm\u2014\n\n\n\n\n(I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t breathe\u2014)\n\n\n\n\nStay calm, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s going to be fine, everything\u2019s okay\u2014\n\n\n\n\n(Can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t breathe\u2014!)\n\n\n\n\nRelax, relax! \n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t breathe, CAN\u2019T BREATHE\u2014\n\n\n\nAnd suddenly, there were chains around his throat again, chains holding him down, and he couldn\u2019t breathe, he couldn\u2019t breathe, \n\nhe couldn\u2019t breathe, \n\nhe was going to die (again), he was going to \n\ndie, \n\nand everyone would \n\nmourn, \n\nand everyone would \n\nhurt \n\nand \n\ncry \n\nand \n\nblame themselves \n\nand \n\ncrapcrapcrapno I can\u2019t breathe I can\u2019t breathe Ican\u2019tbreatheIcan\u2019tbreathe\u2014\n\n\n\nBefore he had time to think or do anything else, something wrapped around his waist and pulled him towards the surface. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll Might knew something was wrong the instant Midoriya assured him otherwise. He hadn\u2019t questioned his student, because he knew how awkward and shy and embarrassed Midoriya could get, but that didn\u2019t mean he agreed with his decision. The instant All Might asked the question, there\u2019d been a flicker of something in Midoriya\u2019s eyes, something probably even \n\nhe himself \n\nwas unaware of, but All Might noticed it. \n\n\nAnd now, as he pulled his near-limp student towards the surface of the water, he knew it wasn\u2019t something he should have brushed off. \n\n\nThey broke surface, and the first thing All Might did was make sure Midoriya\u2019s head was above the water. It was, and he was coughing, which was a good thing. All Might had gotten to him before he stopped breathing. \n\n\nHe set Midoriya down on the shoreline before heaving himself up out of the water as well; Midoriya\u2019s classmates were nearby instantly, though they kept their distance, looking like they wanted to help and just didn\u2019t know \n\nhow. \n\n\n\nNot that it mattered. \n\n\nAll Might knelt in front Midoriya, who was still coughing and hacking, and settled a hand on the boy\u2019s back to help steady him. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Young Midoriya,\u201d All Might told him. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d \n\n\nInternally, he was kicking and screaming at himself. \n\nAre you kidding me? You \n\nknew\n\n this would happen! Why didn\u2019t you stop him!? \n\n\n\nAt length, Midoriya stopped coughing, and at first, All Might thought he was alright (physically, at least)\u2014but then, he noticed Midoriya still wasn\u2019t \n\nbreathing \n\nright, that his breaths were drawn in as small, rapid gasps. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s hyperventilating. \n\n\n\nIt was so obvious that All Might felt like an idiot for not noticing sooner. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said firmly, putting his hands on his student\u2019s shoulders, \u201cit\u2019s okay, alright? You\u2019re fine, you\u2019re okay.\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya took in a shuddering breath that was no deeper or less hysteric than before. \u201cI-I-I c-can\u2019t do it,\u201d Midoriya choked between gasps, tears and water droplets cascading down his face. \u201cN-N-Not again, n-not again, p-p-please n-not again\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen again, I promise,\u201d All Might told him. He knew what the boy was referring to; literally \n\ndrowning, \n\nhis friends mourning over him\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re fine, you\u2019re alright, Young Midoriya\u2026\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya sucked in a shaky breath, ducking his head and burying his hands in his soaked hair, but he didn\u2019t seem completely \n\nthere. \n\nLike he wasn\u2019t aware of his surroundings, or even All Might kneeling in front of him. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya, \n\nyou\u2019re fine,\u201d \n\nAll Might told him, trying to be firm without being harsh, and finally, \n\nfinally, \n\nMidoriya\u2019s head snapped up, and his eyes met his mentor\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re alright, alright? It scared you, I know, but it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe. Nothing can hurt you now.\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya inhaled and exhaled shakily a few more times, then nodded feverishly. \n\n\n\u201cNow, you need to breathe,\u201d All Might instructed. \u201cTry and take in deep breaths, alright? You\u2019re fine. There\u2019s nothing to worry about anymore.\u201d \n\n\nMidoriya nodded again, less feverishly this time, and tried taking in a deep breath. It took a while\u2014a long while, actually, a lot longer than All Might would have hoped\u2014but finally, Midoriya\u2019s breathing returned to normal, and he brushed the last of his tears off his face. \n\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d All Might asked, and Midoriya nodded shakily, though he didn\u2019t respond verbally. At long last, the duo rose to their feet, and All Might wrapped an arm around his pupil\u2019s shoulders. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him to see Recovery Girl,\u201d All Might addressed the rest of the students, who had yet to move since Midoriya resurfaced. They all looked equally shaken up, which made sense considering the memories that must have resurfaced, but they didn\u2019t argue. \u201cYoung Iida, I\u2019m leaving you in charge. I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d \n\n\nIida nodded firmly and snapped his hand up in salute, but his eyes never once left Midoriya. After that, All Might led Midoriya off, saying nothing. \n\n\nAll Might was slowly realizing that one of the hardest parts of mentoring somebody was the inability to do more for them. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPanic attack,\u201d Recovery Girl diagnosed, pushing back her chair. Izuku sat on a nearby infirmary bed, where Recovery Girl had been examining him. All the while, he said nothing, keeping his head down, droplets of water dripping off his hair and leaving a small puddle on the floor. \n\n\n\u201cYou should be fine,\u201d Recovery Girl said; Izuku didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cI know panic attacks are scary, but they\u2019re not dangerous. You\u2019re alright.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku bit his lip, balling his fists against his knees. He didn\u2019t know \n\nwhy, \n\nbut just being underneath the water, in the black, in the \n\ncold, \n\nhad made him remember everything he wanted to forget. Drowning. Dying. Seeing his friends in pain. \n\n\nRecovery Girl reached out and patted his hand softly. \u201cTry not to be too hard on yourself, alright? It was your body\u2019s reaction to the situation. You couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly. \u201cI-It just feels stupid,\u201d he murmured. \n\n\nRecovery Girl shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I said, you couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly, then nodded. If there was one thing he couldn\u2019t do, it was argue with Recovery Girl. \n\n\nShe was the only person, aside from All Might, who knew about Second Chance. The day after he\u2019d explained his Quirk to All Might, All Might had prompted him to visit the nurse\u2019s office and tell Recovery Girl as well, just in case the Second Chance came with any physical side effects they didn\u2019t know about (and there weren\u2019t, but it was always good to make sure). \n\n\n\u201cWell, physically, you\u2019re fine to go,\u201d Recovery Girl said, offering him a smile. \u201cLet me know if anything else comes up, alright?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku thanked her, hopped off the bed, and left the infirmary. All Might had returned to the USJ for the rest of the students, so he was alone this time. \n\n\nAs he walked, his clothes still damp and drops of water leaving a small trail behind him, all he could think about were the haunted faces of his friends when All Might dragged him out of the water. He\u2019d only seen them for a glimpse, but he\u2019d seen enough, and it reminded him\u2014far, far too much\u2014of everything he wanted to forget. \n\n\n\n\u201cI WANT HIM BACK, IIDA! I...I j-just...I-I just...w-want my friend b-back\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYOU IDIOT! YOU FRICKIN\u2019 \n\nIDIOT, \n\nDEKU!! WHAT THE HELL MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN GO DYING ON EVERYONE LIKE THAT, HUH!?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cD-Dangit, man, this \n\nsucks. \n\nThis r-really \n\nsucks.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you really think \n\nany \n\nof us are okay right now?\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku sucked in a deep, shaky breath. \n\n\n\nI should tell them, \n\nhe realized, quite jarringly, as he headed back for Classroom 1-A to await everyone else\u2019s return. \n\n\n\nI should tell them. \n\n\n\n\nEven if it hurts\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...They have a right to know. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt took a few days before he finally mustered the courage to tell them the truth. He didn\u2019t even know how he was going to bring it up. He thought about doing it casually, like, \u201cSo you wanna get coffee?\u2014Oh, and I died a few months ago\u2014but THAT COFFEE THO,\u201d but no, it just didn\u2019t work that way. \n\n\nSo, he decided that, instead of trying to script what he\u2019d say and run different scenarios in his head, he\u2019d just blurt whatever felt right and finally get it over with. He\u2019d cross (or rather, burn) that bridge when he came to it. \n\n\n\u201cH-Hey, c-can...can I talk to you guys for a minute?\u201d he stammered after school one afternoon, as his classmates gathered up their backpacks and workbooks and prepared to leave Classroom 1-A. \n\n\n\u201cSure thing, Midoriya!\u201d Kirishima answered instantly with a trademark grin and thumbs-up. Yaoyorozu nodded, as did Mina and Mineta; Tsuyu shrugged with a \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to go anywhere,\u201d and Iida exclaimed, \u201cOf course, Midoriya!\u201d \n\n\nAfter that, everyone else agreed quickly, which was both good (because Izuku really just wanted to get this over with) and bad (because it meant he would actually have to \n\ntell them). \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d Ochako asked, swinging her backpack over her shoulder and looking at him curiously. \n\n\n\u201cE-Erm...I-I was thinking we could...do it somewhere a little more private,\u201d Izuku said, then bit his lip immediately afterwards. He wasn\u2019t ready for this. Ooooh, crap no, he wasn\u2019t ready for this. But he\u2019d already brought it up, and to back out of it now would just raise suspicion and worry his friends further, and he didn\u2019t have the heart to do that. \n\n\nSo he didn\u2019t. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow about the Student Lounge?\u201d Tsuyu offered, tapping a finger to her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s used very much this time of day.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThe Student Lounge!\u201d Kirishima roared proudly, as though it was his idea. \u201cAwesome! C\u2019mon, guys!\u201d \n\n\nAnd the students filed out, Izuku bringing up the rear with Kirishima up ahead. \n\n\n\nHow am I gonna say this? \n\n\n\n\n...I don\u2019t even know\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...It\u2019s probably better not to overthink things. \n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...Nevermind, that never works.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Midoriya, seriously, what\u2019s up?\u201d Kaminari asked, sliding up beside him. \u201cYou look pretty tense. What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s...it\u2019s not something, like, super \n\nserious, \n\nis it?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cN-Not...n-not really,\u201d Izuku said, but if he was completely honest, he didn\u2019t know either way, \u201ci-it\u2019s just...kind of a lot to explain, so\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh, I getcha,\u201d said Kaminari, nodding seriously. \u201cYou wanna explain it to everyone at the same time, right? That\u2019s cool. But seriously, you can loosen up a bit, y\u2019know. We\u2019re all friends here.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku had to bite back the urge to say, \n\nThat\u2019s just the problem. \n\n\n\nThey reached the Student Lounge before he was ready, and everyone filed inside. It was a nice, big, open area, with a rectangular coffee table and two couches on either side, facing each other. It was empty with the exception of the new arrivals, and everyone took a seat, half on one side and half on the other side. The instant Izuku sat down, Ochako and Iida took a seat on either side of them, which made sense. \n\n\nOnce everyone was situated, they sat in silence for a while as Izuku tried to gather his thoughts and find a way to word what he was about to say. \n\n\n\u201c...So, Midori...\u201d It was Mina who broke the silence, her hands folded tightly in her lap. \u201c...What this thing you wanna talk about?\u201d \n\n\n\u201c...Right,\u201d Izuku swallowed, \u201cerm...sorry, I just\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nSay it. \n\n\n\nAll eyes were on him, some worried, some curious, others scared, some unsure, some nervous, though the majority just looked...\n\nconcerned. \n\n\n\n\nJust say it. \n\n\n\n\nYou have to say it. \n\n\n\n\u201c...I-I\u2019ve told you guys a little bit about my Quirk,\u201d Izuku said quietly, winging his hands together. \u201cJ-Just...i-its origins, r-right?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sero agreed, nodding. \u201cYou said it was some freak mutation that developed right before you started high school, right?\u201d\n\n\nIzuku nodded feverishly. \u201cY-Yeah, that,\u201d he said. \u201cA-And...stuff like that happening is already super rare, but...t-t-there\u2019s something else. I didn\u2019t...I didn\u2019t actually realize it until now.\u201d \n\n\n\nJust say it. \n\n\n\n\nSay it. \n\n\n\n\nTell them the truth. \n\n\n\n\u201cI...I have two Quirks,\u201d Izuku said plainly. \u201cOne that didn\u2019t develop until I was older, and one...one that I was born with.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima snapped his fingers. \u201cSort of like Todoroki, except you didn\u2019t have both of them from the start?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not so weird,\u201d said Sato, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019ve had some friends who inherited both their parents\u2019 Quirks, so a person having two Quirks isn\u2019t that unheard of. It\u2019s not something you have to be so freaked out about, for sure.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d said Ochako, nodding encouragingly. \u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all! You don\u2019t have to look so nervous, Deku\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nThey\u2019re taking the \u201ctwo Quirks\u201d thing better than I thought they would\u2026\n\n\n\nIzuku only wished the \u201ctwo Quirks\u201d was the hard part, and he shook his head, wishing he didn\u2019t have to go on. But it was too late to back out now. He\u2019d dug his grave; time to lie in it. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s not really it. I-I mean, it \n\nis, \n\nbut...that\u2019s not \n\nall.\u201d \n\n\n\nHis friends fell silent again, but they were more zeroed in on him than ever, and he took a breath, mentally steeling himself. \n\n\n\u201cI...I was born with this Quirk called \u2018Second Chance,\u2019\u201d Izuku explained, fidgeting restlessly. \u201cI-It\u2019s a super rare Quirk that only comes around every couple centuries and can\u2019t be passed down through generations like most Quirks can. W-With this Quirk, w-when a person dies, they\u2019re \u2018revived\u2019 and can live again, a-and it can only be used once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...But, Midoriya, whatd\u2019ya look so down about!?\u201d Mineta exclaimed, surging forward suddenly, his eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s \n\nawesome!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d agreed Hagakure instantly, nodding vigorously (though it was hard to tell at first). \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, Midoriya! You get a super awesome physical Quirk, and if you\u2019re killed by a villain, you won\u2019t die! What\u2019s the problem?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed hard. \n\n\n\nSay it. \n\n\n\n\nJust say it. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time. \n\n\n\n\u201c...Erm...I-I mean...it\u2019s great, I-I know,\u201d Izuku said nervously, \u201cb-but...y-you see...I-I already used it. Second Chance, I mean.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a beat. \n\n\n\u201cWHAT!?\u201d his friends chorused in unison, and Izuku flinched back, biting his lip hard enough to draw blood. \n\n\n\u201cWait, \n\nwhen!?\u201d \n\nKirishima demanded suddenly. \u201cLike, when you were little? Holy \n\ncrap, \n\nMidoriya! You literally\u2014holy \n\ncrap\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhen did this happen, Midori?\u201d Mina asked, sounding very scared. \n\n\nIzuku swallowed. Didn\u2019t answer at first. \n\n\nThere were hands on Izuku\u2019s shoulders, and he was whirled around. \u201cMidoriya, \n\nwhen was this?\u201d \n\nIida asked him seriously, staring him dead in the eyes. Izuku shrunk under his and the others\u2019 gazes, wanting nothing more than to turn and \n\nrun \n\nfor all he was worth.\n\n\nBut of course he didn\u2019t do that. His friends were waiting silently for an answer, their expressions asking the same question as Iida, and they deserved to know. They deserved the truth. \n\n\nIzuku took in a deep, shuddering breath. \n\n\n\u201c...D-Do...do you guys r-remember...when we did survival training up in the mountains a few months ago?\u201d Izuku asked quietly. \u00a0\n\n\nSilence. \n\n\nIzuku had said all that was necessary. One by one, he saw the realization\u2014horrible, agonized \n\nrealization \n\nand horror\u2014dawn on each of his friends\u2019 faces. Mineta backed down; Hagakure froze; Ochako\u2019s eyes flew wide with horror; Iida\u2019s hands loosened on his shoulders; Todoroki inhaled sharply; Mina gasped; Yaoyorozu\u2019s hands flew to her mouth; Koda, Sato, Ojiro, and Tokoyami only stared; Aoyama let out a very high-pitched gasp; Jiro looked like a deer in the headlights; Kirishima\u2019s and Kaminari\u2019s mouths hung open; Tsuyu\u2019s face went blank; Shoji\u2019s eyes widened; Sero looked like he was going to be sick; and Bakug\u014d only stared, looking like he couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what he\u2019d just heard. \n\n\n\u201c...Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d Kirishima whispered. \u201cMidoriya, you aren\u2019t serious...c\u2019mon, dude\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDeku\u2026\u201d Ochako whispered. \u201cY-You...y-you mean\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhen you were dragged underwater,\u201d Yaoyorozu said quietly, staring at the floor with wide eyes full of denial and fear. \u201cYou...you\u2026\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed again. \u201c...It\u2019s...it\u2019s exactly what you think,\u201d he said with a tiny nod of his head.\n\n\n\u201cYou...you frickin\u2019 \n\ndied?\u201d \n\nBakug\u014d blurted, but his voice lacked the usual bite. \n\n\nIt was out. It was finally out, and his friends knew the truth. For a long, long time, no one did anything. The room was filled to bursting with tension and unspoken \n\nhorror, \n\nand Izuku felt sick, his stomach doing a weird, nauseating flip. \n\n\nAnd then, Kirishima stood as though in a trance, crossed the room, and hugged Izuku tight. \n\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Izuku heard Kirishima whisper, and Kirishima\u2019s arms were tight, \n\ntoo \n\ntight around him, and he was shaking, too. \u201cN-No way. No \n\nway\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDeku\u2026\u201d Ochako\u2019s arms wrapped around him from behind, and she buried her face between his shoulder blades. \u201cY-You actually...y-you mean you \n\nactually\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nEveryone else seemed too shocked to move, almost too shocked to \n\nthink, \n\nand Izuku couldn\u2019t blame them. After all, it wasn\u2019t every day your friend told you that they\u2019d literally \n\ndied. \n\n\n\n\u201cMidori...why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Mina asked him, and Izuku cringed at the sound of hurt and betrayal in her voice. \u201cI-I...I-I don\u2019t understand, \n\nwhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou...you know we\u2019re your friends, right?\u201d Kaminari stuttered. \u201cI-I mean...we\u2019re your \n\nfriends, \n\ndude, your \n\nclassmates. \n\nWe...we wanna \n\nknow \n\nthis kind of stuff.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku stammered clumsily, a dozen of different emotions crashing down on him at once. \u201cI-I was going to, b-but...a-after it happened...I-I didn\u2019t...I d-didn\u2019t think i-it was the right time\u2026\u201d \n\n\nAnother pair of arms wrapped around him; Iida had joined the embrace. He said nothing, and Izuku didn\u2019t want to imagine the thoughts currently running through his friend\u2019s head. It was Iida who\u2019d performed CPR on him for over ten minutes (according to what his classmates had told him). He didn\u2019t even want to \n\ntry \n\nto imagine what Iida was feeling. \n\n\n\u201c...I understand, Midoriya,\u201d Yaoyorozu said quietly. \u201cI...I understand your reasons. After all that happened...all that \n\nyou \n\ndealt with...I definitely understand. And I think anyone would be wrong \n\nnot \n\nto.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku took in a deep breath, trying to steady himself mentally (he failed). He wanted to leave. He\u2019d told his friends all he\u2019d planned on telling them, he could \n\nleave \n\nnow, it was time to \n\nget out of here before something else happened\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cD-Deku...it d-didn\u2019t...i-it didn\u2019t...\n\nhurt, \n\ndid it?\u201d Ochako whispered, her voice wavering and cracking on nearly every syllable. \u201cOh, my gosh...D-Deku...w-were...w-were you in \n\npain? \n\nD-Did...did you \n\nsuffer?\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku grimaced, swallowing thickly. \u201c...No,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cN-No, it didn\u2019t hurt\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cW-What...what was it like?\u201d Sero asked him, equally quietly, his voice full of just as much horror and denial as the next person. \u201cI-I mean, if it didn\u2019t hurt...were you...I-I mean, were you, like...\n\nscared?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cN-No,\u201d Izuku replied, feeling more overwhelmed than ever, and he wanted to leave, before anything else happened. \u201cE-Everything w-was...it...I-I mean...it was all j-just really...\n\nnumb. \n\nI-I don\u2019t...I-I don\u2019t \n\nthink \n\nI was scared\u2026\u201d \n\n\nIn complete honesty, Izuku hadn\u2019t even acknowledged the fact that he\u2019d been \n\ndying. \n\nThat was how numb he\u2019d been. Sure, the thought had crossed his mind, but he hadn\u2019t actually...\n\nrealized \n\nit. He\u2019d just...let himself go, without hardly putting up a fight, and while he knew part of that was because of the villain\u2019s Quirk, he didn\u2019t know how much of it was his own doing. \n\n\nWas he scared? Did it hurt? He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t \n\nremember. \n\nAll he remembered was struggling against cold, black chains, before being swallowed up by an even colder, blacker void. \n\n\nHe\u2019d died. \n\n\nHe had literally, \n\nliterally, \n\ndied. \u00a0\n\n\nAnd then, like a bolt of lightning, the weight of everything came crashing down around him. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t notice his sobs until he was choking on them. He didn\u2019t notice the tightness in his chest until he couldn\u2019t breathe. He didn\u2019t notice his friends\u2019 presence until their arms were around him. He didn\u2019t notice how truly \n\nbroken\n\n he was until this instant, until \n\nthis moment. \n\n\n\nBecause it was one thing to confide in All Might and Recovery Girl. \n\n\nBut it was another thing to hide something \n\nthis massive \n\nfrom his friends. \n\n\nSo he cried. He \n\ncried, \n\nbrokenly, disgustingly, sobbing harder than he\u2019d ever sobbed before in his life (and this said a lot). And he didn\u2019t know \n\nwhy. \n\nWhy now? Why here? Why was the reality sinking in \n\nnow \n\nafter all this time? Had his body and mind been in shock for this long? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ochako whispered, her arms tightening around his waist. He felt her tears against his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, \n\nI\u2019m so, so sorry, Deku\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou were \n\nhiding \n\nthis,\u201d Yaoyorozu breathed, a combination of horrified and awed. \u201cYou were hiding this, for \n\nall these months\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHoly crap, Midoriya,\u201d whispered Sero, shaking his head. \u201c...Holy \n\ncrap\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou...you\u2019re too selfless for your own good, you know that?\u201d Kirishima breathed, his voice trembling. \u201cYou were hiding this because you were worried about us, weren\u2019t you? Worried about how we\u2019d take it? Worried about how it would make us feel? You weren\u2019t thinking about yourself at all, were you?\u201d \n\n\u201cSounds like Midoriya, all right\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so glad you\u2019re \n\nokay, \n\nMidori\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah...seriously, Midoriya...I\u2019m just relieved you\u2019re \n\nalive.\u201d \n\n\n\nAs he sat there, crying his eyes out with his friends surrounding him (even Bakug\u014d, though Izuku was too overwhelmed at the moment to think about it), Izuku felt a sudden weight lift from his chest. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it was there until now. \n\n\nHis friends knew now. They knew. His secret was out. \n\n\nAnd even though they were completely and utterly \n\nmortified \n\nat the thought of \n\nlosing \n\nhim, of the knowledge that they \n\nhad \n\nlost him once, \u201csorrow\u201d wasn\u2019t really the vibe Izuku was getting from them. No, it was \n\nrelief. \n\nHis friends were \n\nrelieved, \n\nnot that he\u2019d \n\ndied\n\n of course, but that he was \n\nstill with them now. \n\nThat even though he\u2019d died, that even though it was something they didn\u2019t want to \n\nbegin \n\nto imagine, right now, in this moment, he was okay. Sobbing, but safe. Broken, but healing. Scarred, but alive. \n\n\nBecause \n\nthe now \n\nwas all that really mattered. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLater . . .\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was a concussion. A \n\nconcussion. \n\n\n\nAnd the members of Class 1-A \n\npanicked. \n\n\n\n\u201cI \n\ntold you, \n\nhe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Recovery Girl stated for the utmost time, when all remaining nineteen students burst into the infirmary \n\nalso \n\nfor the utmost time. Behind her, Midoriya was unconscious on one of the hospital beds, gauze wound tightly around his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s a concussion, and it\u2019ll take some time to heal, but he\u2019ll be alright, understand?\u201d \n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough. \n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I left my books in the locker room,\u201d Jiro announced during morning homeroom as she pushed herself to her feet. \u201cCan I go get them?\u201d \n\n\nAizawa gave her a funny look, then shrugged and wrote her a quick Hall Pass. Jiro left and didn\u2019t return until after morning homeroom, long after Aizawa had gone. \n\n\n\u201cRecovery Girl thinks it\u2019ll be some time before he wakes up,\u201d Jiro told the rest of her classmates, fiddling subconsciously with one of her earphone jacks. \u201cThat\u2019s what she was telling All Might. But she says he\u2019ll be fine with some rest.\u201d \n\n\nHowever, this knowledge did nothing to reassure Jiro or her remaining classmates. \n\n\n\u201c...I don\u2019t like this,\u201d Kaminari said, shaking his head feverishly at Midoriya\u2019s empty desk. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t like this one bit. We should go check on him.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Kirishima, shrugging animatedly. \u201cI already \n\ntried \n\nfaking an illness, but Recovery Girl saw right through me, and she\u2019s not letting anyone in the infirmary unless they\u2019re patients!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat if someone faked a broken leg?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d see through that.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat if we \n\nactually \n\nbroke someone\u2019s leg?\u201d Bakug\u014d growled. \n\n\nSero\u2019s hand shot into the air. \u201cI volunteer Mineta!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLeave me \n\nalone!\u201d \n\nMineta slid out of his chair and cowered under the desk. \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \n\ninjuring \n\nourselves is a good idea,\u201d Iida said, frowning. \n\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best we leave this to Recovery Girl,\u201d said Yaoyorozu, always the reasonable one of the group. \u201cShe\u2019s only keeping us out because she wants to make sure Midoriya gets plenty of rest. The stamina needed to heal a concussion is probably tremendous, even over the course of a few days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...The vents!\u201d Kirishima exclaimed, snapping his fingers. \u201cWe could go through the ceiling vents! Y\u2019know, like they do in all the spy movies?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d \n\nsaid Yaoyorozu and Iida together. \n\n\nIn the end, Izuku was fine. During indoor combat training, part of the roof structure had collapsed over his head and given him a concussion, but thanks to Recovery Girl, he was up and at it again within the week. \n\n\nThe 1-A students met again in the Student Lounge, but this time, Midoriya wasn\u2019t with them. And there was a reason for that. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve called you all here today on behalf of a certain Izuku Midoriya,\u201d Kirishima announced. \u201cBecause, let\u2019s be honest, he gets into more danger than he should, and if we\u2019re not careful, something really bad\u2019s gonna happen to him.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI agree!\u201d said Sero, punching his fist into the air. \u201cAll in favor of an Izuku Midoriya Protection Squad, say \u2018Aye\u2019!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d \n\n\nBakug\u014d snorted. \u201cIdiots,\u201d he growled, but that was all he said. \n\n\nAnd so, the Izuku Midoriya Protection Squad was born, and the students of Class 1-A made it their sworn duty to look after their friend, no matter what. If he was sick, they\u2019d either take care of him themselves or escort him to Recovery Girl. If he was hurt, same thing. When it came down to dangerous situations, they were constantly looking over their shoulders, keeping an eye on Midoriya at all times. \n\n\nThey were being overprotective, and they knew it. \n\n\nBut they\u2019d rather be overprotective and look like total idiots than to lose their friend for good. \n\nIt look Iida a lot longer than it should\u2019ve for him to realize that the CPR wasn\u2019t working. No matter how many times he pushed, no matter how many times he begged,  pleaded  with Midoriya to still  be there,  to  wake up,  to just simply  breathe again,  his friend just...  didn\u2019t.  He didn\u2019t move, he didn\u2019t breathe, he didn\u2019t open his eyes, he didn\u2019t...do  anything. \n\u201cCome on, Midoriya!!\u201d Iida yelled, tears now streaming down his face as he realized -- or, at least, tried  not  to realize -- just what this meant. \u201cM-Midoriya,  please!  Y-You have to...you have to  breathe,  Midoriya--!  Midoriya!!\u201d \nThere was sobbing all around him, and he was sobbing, too, his hands and body working on autopilot. He knew he was using too much force in the chest compressions, he just  knew  it, but he couldn\u2019t make himself push any less hard. He just...  couldn\u2019t.  He was  beyond  desperate, and hopelessness began eating away at him, because he\u2019d been doing this for  so long  and Midoriya  still wasn\u2019t breathing. \n I\u2019m useless!!  Iida screeched at himself.  I\u2019m USELESS!! \n\u201cMidoriya,  PLEASE!!\u201d  Iida screamed, his voice cracking in a thousand different places. \u201cMidoriya, y-you can\u2019t...  you can\u2019t be gone, Midoriya! I won\u2019t let you!! MIDORIYA!!\u201d \nBut Midoriya didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t flinch. Didn\u2019t speak. Didn\u2019t  breathe. \nAnd Iida finally began to despair.\nKaminari couldn\u2019t believe this was actually happening. There was just no way. There was  no way in hell this was actually happening. He stared, breathless and thoughtless, as Iida desperately tried to bring Midoriya back, only to no avail.\n\u201cIs this for real?\u201d Kaminari whispered, his eyes burning with tears he knew would be falling any second now. \u201cT-There\u2019s no way this...holy...holy  crap.  There\u2019s no way...there\u2019s just  no freaking way this is real\u2026\u201d \n\u201cMIDORIYA,  YOU HAVE TO BREATHE!!\u201d Iida shrieked, but Kaminari\u2019s brain already knew what his heart refused to accept. Iida\u2019s attempts...were in vain now. Midoriya\u2026\n\n ...Midoriya wasn\u2019t coming back. \n\nKirishima didn\u2019t want to believe this. He just... couldn\u2019t.  Midoriya was his buddy, his  bro,  so how...  how was this happening?  Why was this happening? Was this  really  happening? He was siding with Kaminari on this one. This was too horrible to real. There was no way this could ever actually  happen, right?\nThere was just  no way... there was...there was\u2026\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Kirishima whispered, shaking his head back and forth and stumbling backwards, his eyes locked on Midoriya\u2019s pale, lifeless, unmoving form. \u201cH-Hey, you guys...c-can one of you...j-just punch me? I...I need to wake up. Right now.\u201d\nNo one moved or spoke. It was like he hadn\u2019t even spoken. All eyes were wide, shimmering, and glued to the still figure of Midoriya. Iida was still screaming at him, still trying desperately to bring their friend and classmate back, but\u2026\n\n ...But\u2026 \n\n\u201cCome on, Midoriya,\u201d Kirishima whispered, shaking his head. \u201cD-Don\u2019t do this to me, man. Don\u2019t do...don\u2019t do this to  us.  Y-You can\u2019t be...you can\u2019t be...Midoriya, you  can\u2019t--\u201d \nIida let out a sudden scream of frustration, throwing himself backwards and punching the ground unproductively, every inch of his body trembling. \u201cYou\u2019re useless!\u201d Iida screamed at himself, punching the ground again. \u201cYOU\u2019RE  USELESS!!\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cI-Iida\u2026\u201d Yaoyorozu whispered, her voice choked with tears, \u201cd-don\u2019t...don\u2019t say that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d Kaminari was still chanting, shaking his head feverishly. \u201cThere\u2019s no way, there\u2019s no way, there\u2019s just  no freaking way\u2026\u201d \n\u201cM-M-Midoriya, you can stop the joke now,\u201d Sero gave a shaky laugh, which quickly broke off into a sob. \u201cT-This stopped being funny a  long time ago, Midoriya\u2026y-y-you can stop now...\u201d\nKirishima gritted his teeth, his tears finally beginning to spill over. The gravity of the situation slammed into him all at once, and he came to a sudden, terrifying realization, all too suddenly, before he was ready for it.\nMidoriya was gone.\nAnd he was never coming back.\nYaoyorozu felt like she was going to be sick.\nHer throat was clogged by an immovable lump that she couldn\u2019t swallow back no matter how hard she tried, and ragged sobs squeezed from between her clenched teeth. Her hair was still dripping wet from when she\u2019d went underwater after Midoriya and the villain, but she didn\u2019t even care. Her skin felt like ice cubes, and her wet clothes clung to her skin, but she didn\u2019t bother fashioning herself new ones.\nHagakure was sobbing beside her, and Yaoyorozu wanted to comfort her, only she couldn\u2019t, because honestly, Yaoyorozu wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to comfort  anyone right now. As strong-willed as she was, she just...couldn\u2019t do it. It was taking all her willpower not to scream as it was.\n\u201cDEKU!!\u201d Ochako suddenly rushed passed her and threw herself down at Midoriya\u2019s side. Iida had long since turned away, and he had his hands covering his face, tears streaking from between his fingers. He didn\u2019t look at Ochako, or at anyone else.\n\u201cDeku, no!!\u201d Ochako screamed, reaching out and taking his shoulders. \u201cC-Come on, D-Deku! You can\u2019t...you can\u2019t do this!! We\u2019re gonna...w-we\u2019re gonna be heroes, remember? R-Remember? Y-You said...y-you said we were gonna be  heroes, together,  Deku!! D-Don\u2019t...  don\u2019t you remember?  You promised! You  promised, and y-you\u2026\u201d\nShe broke off with a harsh, ragged, guttural sob, and Yaoyorozu cupped her hands around her mouth, horror and disbelief engulfing her entire frame.\n\u201cDeku, you c-can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Ochako was sobbing again, her tears splashing against Midoriya\u2019s pale cheeks. \u201cY-You can\u2019t...you can\u2019t be...d-don\u2019t... d-d-don\u2019t do this... p-please, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re...y-you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\nAnd she leaned over him, her head against his chest, and let out a loud, long, guttural scream.\nYaoyorozu looked away, unable to watch her friend and classmate in this kind of pain, let alone look at Midoriya\u2019s still body any longer.\n\n I couldn\u2019t beat the villain in time. \n\nThe thought struck her so quickly it was like a bolt of lightning, and she actually jumped, her tears halting for a fraction of a second before resuming.\n\n This is\u2026 \n\n\n ...This is my fault. \n\nTodoroki was grounded to the spot. He felt like his feet had been nailed to the ground, and he couldn\u2019t move, no matter how hard he tried or how badly he wanted to. This wasn\u2019t right. This just... wasn\u2019t right.  It was wrong. It was so, so, so, so, so,  so wrong,  and it just...there was no way something  this wrong could ever happen. There was no way.\u00a0\nAs badly as he wanted to move, as badly as he wanted to  do something,  he found that he just...  couldn\u2019t.  Midoriya was the first true friend Todoroki ever had, the first person to look at him as anything other than just  \u201cthe son of the Number Two Hero,\u201d and not only that, but he gave up winning the Sports Festival just for Todoroki\u2019s sake.\nHe was the first friend Todoroki ever had, the first person Todoroki felt  truly cared about him.\nAnd now, that same person was lying, motionless, breathless,  lifeless,  on the ground in front of him, and now...Todoroki just  couldn\u2019t move.  He was just...so  shocked  and  horrified  by all of this that he  literally  couldn\u2019t move a  muscle.  He could hardly  breathe. \n\u201c...Midoriya\u2026\u201d he managed to whisper, his voice completely drowned out by the sobs and cries of his classmates around him. \u201cM-Midoriya\u2026?\u201d\nAnd that was all he could say before his mind was overwhelmed by a blank, inescapable  nothingness. \nMidoriya was dead.\n\n Dead. \n\nTodoroki\u2019s first real friend, the first person who actually  cared  about him, the first person who actually attempted to  help Todoroki, was\u2026\n ...Gone. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTodoroki gritted his teeth, his eyes burning and his fists balling at his sides. He hadn\u2019t been able to move before, but now, he trembled, his shoulders shaking with every inhale and exhale respectively.\nAnd he cursed the world.\nHe cursed the world that let Midoriya die, cursed the world that let this happen, cursed the world that took Todoroki\u2019s first and closest friend away from him.\nNot for the first time, and definitely not for the last, Todoroki prayed this was all some horrible nightmare.\n(But he already knew, all too well, that this bitter reality was a nightmare he would never wake up from.)\n\n I was too late. \n\nThat was the thought Tsuyu kept coming back around to, as she stared at the lifeless, unmoving form of Midoriya, still soaked from head to toe in salty water. Tsuyu hadn\u2019t accepted the reality, hadn\u2019t  wanted  to accept the reality, because how  could  she accept a reality in which one of her closest friends was  murdered right in front of her?\n\n I was too late. \n\nOchako was screaming again, yelling Midoriya\u2019s name (or, rather, the endearing nickname she knew him by) in rapid session.\n\n I was too late. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m  worthless,\u201d  Iida whispered harshly, his fists balled against the ground and tears streaming down his face. \u201cI c-couldn\u2019t...I\u2019m  useless\u2026!\u201d \n\n I was too late. \n\n\u201cYou frickin\u2019 villain, I\u2019LL KILL YOU!!\u201d Bakug\u014d screeched, launching himself at the unconscious villain.  \u201cJUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!?\u201d \n\u201cBakug\u014d, stop!\u201d Sero yelled, swinging his tape around and catching Bakug\u014d around the chest, yanking him back to keep him from murdering the villain (as Tsuyu had no doubt he would). \u201cT-This...this isn\u2019t the time!\u201d\n\n I was too late. \n\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN!?\u201d Bakug\u014d roared, struggling to break free from Sero\u2019s hold. \u201cDON\u2019T TELL ME YOU\u2019RE  OKAY WITH WHAT HE DID!!\u201d\n\n I was too late. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,  there\u2019s no way I am!!\u201d  Sero screamed, yanking again. \u201cBut you  can\u2019t do this right now! You\u2019re...you\u2019re not making this any easier!\u201d\n\n I was too late. \n\nAnd, quite uncharacteristically, Bakug\u014d actually stopped, though he looked no less furious, his hands balled into tight, shaking fists at his sides. Tsuyu wasn\u2019t positive, either, but she was pretty sure something that definitely wasn\u2019t sweat rolled down Bakug\u014d\u2019s face.\n\n I was too late. \n\nThe reality finally caught up with her, and Tsuyu\u2019s tears spilled over.\n\n Midoriya\u2026 \n\n\n ...I\u2019m sorry. \n\n\n ...I\u2019m so, so sorry\u2026 \n\n\u201cI brought help!\u201d Mina screamed as she raced up the mountain, tripping over a dozen times on unsteady, shaking feet. \u201cHow\u2019s Midori--!?\u201d\nShe skidded to a halt as though she\u2019d slammed into an invisible wall. She could feel it already, could feel something in the air, something  horrible. She didn\u2019t even need to see anything before she already knew exactly what\u2019d happened.\n\u201c...No,\u201d she whispered, her eyes going wide with horror. \u201cNo, no, no, no, nonononono no,  there\u2019s no...  no\u2026\u201d \nShe was aware of All Might and Aizawa running passed her towards the scene, but she herself was grounded to the spot, unable to move or think beyond the fear and horror that suddenly engulfed every fibre of her being.\nOjiro stepped towards her, a deep sorrow ebbed in his eyes, along with tears that glistened in the moonlight and rolled down his cheeks. Mina\u2019s breath caught in her throat, a sour taste in her mouth.\n\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d she pleaded, shaking her head. \u201cY-You don\u2019t mean...Midori, he\u2019s...he\u2019s...h-h-he  can\u2019t be\u2026  he\u2019s not  d-d--\u201d \nShe couldn\u2019t say it. She just  couldn\u2019t say it,  because saying it meant it was true. Saying that one word now meant reality, and no, no, no, no,  no,  she wasn\u2019t going to accept this reality. This was one reality she just  wasn\u2019t going to accept.\n\u201c...Ashido\u2026\u201d Ojiro looked away, gritting his teeth tightly behind his lips. \u201cY-You...you did the best you could, bringing help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina whispered, shaking her head in denial. \u201cD-Don\u2019t talk like that, Ojiro. M-Midori\u2019s fine, i-isn\u2019t he? H-He\u2019s okay, right?\u201d\nOjiro said nothing, and his lack of response was enough to tell her all she needed to know.\nMina stared at him for a long, long moment, and then, she sank to the ground, hew knees scraping the hard, cold dirt below. \u201cNo,\u201d she begged, hanging her head. \u201cNo, no, no, no, this isn\u2019t happening...this can\u2019t be happening\u2026\u201d\nOjiro still said nothing, and Mina didn\u2019t know whether or not she wanted him to.\n\u201cW-We were...w-we were going to...w-we were going to meet for study sessions,\u201d Mina whispered, tears spilling down her face and sobs breaking her voice. \u201cH-He promised...h-he\u2019d help me with exams whenever M-Momo was busy...h-he promised he\u2019d help me\u2026\u201d\nOjiro inhaled sharply, but still said nothing. Mina realized he was in just as much shock as she was and probably couldn\u2019t find the right words to say. And of course, Mina couldn\u2019t, either.\nAnd honestly, how could she? Midori...the most sweetest, compassionate and selfless boy Mina knew, was just... gone. Just like that. Gone forever, and nothing was ever going to bring him back.\nAll Might thought it was a joke.\nIt had to be a joke, because there was no way something like  this  could ever actually happen. There was no way Midoriya could...  die,  surrounded by his sobbing, despairing classmates. There was no way. This world was messed up, this was something All Might knew well, but certainly it wasn\u2019t  this cruel.\nIt wasn\u2019t.\nIt just  couldn\u2019t be. \nThis wasn\u2019t real. It wasn\u2019t real, it  wasn\u2019t,  All Might wouldn\u2019t  accept it. \nMidoriya wasn\u2019t moving. That was the first thing All Might noticed. Aizawa was behind him, dealing with the villain (probably harsher than was necessary), but All Might couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. All that mattered right now was his student, still and pale and  most definitely not breathing. \nThat was the second thing he realized. Midoriya wasn\u2019t breathing.\nHis feet moved on their own, and his knees his the ground before he registered himself kneeling. Ochako was bent over Midoriya, sobbing openly and ardently, and it didn\u2019t take a genius to know what had happened.\nThis was too  twisted  and  wrong to ever be real.\n\u201c...Young Uraraka,\u201d All Might said, reaching out and gently touching her shoulder. She flinched and jumped, whirling around to look at him. Her eyes were wide, puffy, and bloodshot, and tears continued to stream down her face.\n\n This isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s just a dream. A dream. That\u2019s all this is. It\u2019s going to be fine. Midoriya is fine. Everything\u2019s alright\u2026 \n\n\u201c...Let me see him for a moment,\u201d All Might said thickly, and the words were truly a struggle to get out, because in honesty, All Might  didn\u2019t  want to see this. Because if he saw it, with his own two eyes, it meant that it was  real, and All Might wasn\u2019t ready for that.\nOchako nodded shakily and sat back, letting loose another choked sob. Yaoyorozu moved over and crouched beside her, and Ochako lunged into her friend\u2019s arms immediately, her sobs becoming screams.\nAnd, honestly, All Might felt like screaming, too. There was no doubt about it now. Midoriya was still, silent, pale as death (and the word \u201cdeath\u201d felt so, so, so  wrong), and All Might could see it now. The boy\u2019s chest wasn\u2019t rising and falling. He wasn\u2019t breathing.\nMidoriya wasn\u2019t breathing.\nAnd All Might\u2019s mind went blank. This boy,  his  boy, the one he\u2019d begun to see as a son since the day he chose Midoriya to be his successor, wasn\u2019t breathing anymore. Wasn\u2019t moving, wasn\u2019t smiling, wasn\u2019t laughing, wasn\u2019t crying, wasn\u2019t  alive.  The life was just...  gone. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Iida whispered, his voice strained and harsh and choked, and All Might tore his eyes away from Midoriya briefly to look at Iida. Iida didn\u2019t meet his gaze, staring off at nothing with a distant, horrified look in his red, swollen eyes. \u201cI-I t-tried, but I couldn\u2019t...I couldn\u2019t... dammit,  I  c-c-couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \n\u201c...It wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d All Might said thickly. \u201cYou did everything you could, Young Iida. This...this isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\nIida ducked his head, his tears splashing against the ground, and all the while, All Might just... couldn\u2019t believe this was actually happening.  His mind was fogged with denial, and while he accepted the facts, while the evidence was all  there, he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to believe it.\nThis couldn\u2019t be real. This was just too horrible and twisted and  wrong  to ever be  reality. \nAnd yet\u2026\n\n And yet\u2026 \n\nWhen All Might reached out and rested his hand on Midoriya\u2019s forearm, the boy\u2019s skin was cold. Midoriya didn\u2019t react to the touch, either. Just remained still, motionless, breathless, and\u2026\nAnd\u2026\nOh, there was  no way\u2026 \nThis just...this just couldn\u2019t  happen.  Not like this. Not like this. Not now and not ever. This wasn\u2019t real. This  couldn\u2019t be real.\nAll Might wasn\u2019t aware of anything else after that. He heard Aizawa talking from what seemed like far away, saying something about heading back to the cabin, and though All Might noticed the way Aizawa\u2019s voice shuddered and cracked, he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to acknowledge it. \u00a0\nWhat was important right now was Midoriya.\nDead.\nThe word struck All Might like an icy arrow, straight to the heart.\nDead.\nDead.\nDead.\nDead.\nDead.\nHis successor.\nDead.\nOne of the students he\u2019d sworn to protect.\nDead.\nThe boy he\u2019d come to see as a son.\nDead.\nAnd there was no changing this reality. This was one thing All Might couldn\u2019t change, no matter how badly, how  desperately he wanted to.\nWhen it was time to leave, All Might carefully -- oh so carefully -- scooped Midoriya\u2019s unmoving, lifeless form into his arms, inwardly (and outwardly, probably) wincing at just how limp the boy was.\nNo.\nThis wasn\u2019t Midoriya anymore.\nThis was...a body. Midoriya was gone. The life and warmth that was Midoriya  wasn\u2019t there anymore. \nAnd when his students weren\u2019t looking -- when All Might didn\u2019t need to put up a brave front for their sake -- he held Midoriya closer and finally let the tears fall.\nDeath was something Aizawa saw often. Part of being a hero was being willing to throw your life away at the drop of a hat. If it came down to your life or the life of someone else, it was always your life that was lost. It was a part of the job. You practically signed up for it.\nBut not this time. No. No.  No.  This wasn\u2019t something Aizawa could just  brush off as part of the \u201cjob.\u201d This was different. Oh so different.\nMidoriya. His student.  Dead. Murdered.  By the hands of a  villain. \nFor the first time in his life, Aizawa wanted to murder somebody. He wanted to murder the villain, he wanted to see the villain  dead.  After all, he deserved it. He  deserved to die after what he did to one of Aizawa\u2019s precious students.\nSure, his students were brats sometimes, but no matter how many times they screwed up or did something reckless, Aizawa still cared about them, like they were his own children. This group of crazy teenagers had come to mean  so much to him, and now\u2026\nAnd now one of them was  dead. Gone. Forever. Just like that. At the drop of a hat.\nAnd Aizawa didn\u2019t want to think about it. He didn\u2019t want to think about it, not now and not ever, but when he did...when he  did think about it, it was a lot harder to keep his haunted sorrow hidden.\nBecause Midoriya had been murdered.  Murdered. And Aizawa hadn\u2019t been able to do a single thing about it.\n\n ...Some hero I turned out to be\u2026 \n\n\n ...I couldn\u2019t even save my own student. \n\nAnd if, when he was alone, Aizawa cried until his throat was hoarse, well\u2026\n...That was his own business.\nInko got the feeling that something was wrong when Izuku didn\u2019t come home on the day he was supposed to. According to what the principal had told her, the students of Class 1-A had gone into the mountains for Survival Training and would return in three days, but it was day four now, and there was still no sign of her son.\nShe didn\u2019t know what it was, but...something in her heart told her that something terrible had happened. Of course she brushed it off, though, because Izuku was obviously fine. She was just being paranoid again over his safety. He was fine, though. No matter what, he\u2019d always come home to her, and this time would be no different.\nShe was right in the middle of making katsudon, later on that evening around dinner time, when there was a knock on the door, and she smiled, knowing it had to be Izuku, as she raced to open it. At the time, she didn\u2019t register the fact that he\u2019d knocked instead of just using his spare key to open the door.\nShe unlocked the door and opened it, but it wasn\u2019t her son who was standing there. It was Shouta Aizawa (and it took Inko a second to recall his name), her son\u2019s homeroom teacher at the U.A. and a pro hero as well. She remembered his eyes as worn and weary, but this time, his eyes were bloodshot.\n\u201c...What\u2019s this about?\u201d Inko could barely speak, something in her heart clenching in fear. \u201cW-Where\u2019s Izuku\u2026?\u201d\nThe man before her swallowed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re Inko Midoriya, correct?\u201d he asked, even though by the tone of his voice he already knew the answer. \u201cIzuku Midoriya\u2019s mother?\u201d\nInko sucked in a sharp inhale of breath. This wasn\u2019t good. This wasn\u2019t good.  This wasn\u2019t good.  \u201cW-Wh...where\u2019s my son?\u201d she asked instead of answering, looking behind Aizawa, expecting to see Izuku  somewhere. \u201cW-Where...where is he\u2026?\u201d\nAizawa swallowed again. \u201c...I\u2019m sorry to tell you this,\u201d he said, \u201cand...and no words could ever describe how truly, genuinely sorry I am.\u201d\nAnd Inko\u2019s heart stopped. When it started back again, it was pounding harder than ever. She felt lightheaded.\n\u201c...Your son, Izuku...he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nInko shook her head feverishly, bringing her hands to her mouth.\n\u201c...He was murdered. I\u2019m...I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d\nInko lost the ability to stand, and she crashed to her knees, her hands moving from her face to clutch at her heart. She\u2019d lost the ability to think a long time ago, overwhelmed by this fear and sadness and horror that she couldn\u2019t even  begin to describe.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Inko said quietly, looking up at Aizawa, desperate for an answer. She laughed, shakily and giddily, and the tears began flowing. \u201cYou have to be joking. This is a  joke, right? Izuku\u2026he can\u2019t be...\u201d\nOne look at Aizawa\u2019s face told her all she needed to know. The gravity of  what this meant slammed into Inko all at once, and she buried her face in her hands with a long, guttural wail, her sobs breaking her voice.\nThis wasn\u2019t possible. No, no,  no, this wasn\u2019t possible. Her boy, her precious, irreplaceable baby, he was\u2026\nHe was\u2026\n...No, this wasn\u2019t possible. This couldn\u2019t happen. This just... couldn\u2019t happen. \nAnd yet, as much as she tried to deny it, the reality was right in front of her, and she couldn\u2019t deny the truth.\nThe day of Midoriya\u2019s funeral was the worst day of Tokoyami\u2019s life.\nHis classmates were mourning around him. Dark Shadow wasn\u2019t his usual self, either, hovering over Tokoyami\u2019s head all throughout the funeral, also crying. Tokoyami didn\u2019t want to believe any of this, but...it was a  funeral.  This was  real.  All of this, all of this horrible nightmare was  real. \nEver since the Sports Festival, Midoriya had become a friend that Tokoyami could say he truly, honestly respected, and Tokoyami couldn\u2019t say that about a lot of people. Midoriya was an incredible person, with a heart of gold, and he\u2019d respected and trusted Tokoyami just as much as Tokoyami respected and trusted him.\nThere were no testimonies. When the funeral was over, everyone dispersed, never speaking a word to each other. It seemed wrong to not say anything, but at the same time, it seemed even  more wrong to try and engage in conversation.\nSo, in a mutual, unspoken agreement, everyone just... left,  Tokoyami included. And Tokoyami knew that if anyone had  tried  to get up and say a testimony, they would have broken down immediately, no matter who it was. Even  Bakug\u014d wouldn\u2019t have been able to get more than a word or two in.\nThey went home, each to their own. School was cancelled for a week by Aizawa-sensei. At the time, Aizawa had said the reason for it was police investigation, but Tokoyami knew the truth. Aizawa wanted to give the students (and teachers alike) some time to cope, some time to themselves.\nAnd while Tokoyami appreciated the gesture, he knew that no amount of time would help him or the others get over what had happened. There was no \u201cgetting over this,\u201d not now and not ever.\nThis was the truth Tokoyami knew, but refused to accept. \u00a0\nOchako couldn\u2019t breathe.\nShe tried paying attention when they finally returned to class, she really, really did, but she just couldn\u2019t. There was a permanent lump in her throat, and no matter how hard she tried, there was no getting rid of it. There was a tightness in her chest, like someone had wrapped steel bands around her and squeezed tightly.\nShe heard Aizawa talking, but she couldn\u2019t make out a word he was saying. She felt sick, and tears began to sting her eyes. In the back of the room was an empty desk:  Deku\u2019s  desk, a desk that would remain empty for...for as long as they were in the U.A. And even if someone transferred into Class 1-A in Deku\u2019s place, even when Class 1-A changed classrooms, that desk would always be known as  Deku\u2019s desk, no matter who sat in it.\nFinally, Ochako rose to her feet, slipping up a hand. Aizawa stopped talking, and she could feel her classmates\u2019 eyes on her, but she refused to look at them. She was having a really,  really hard time holding the tears back.\n\u201cC-Can I go to the nurse\u2019s office?\u201d she asked, trying to keep her voice from cracking although it did anyway. \u201cI-I...I have a headache.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t a complete lie. Actually, she thought it\u2019d be a miracle if she finished the day without getting sick, but at the same time, she wasn\u2019t planning on going to the nurse\u2019s office. She just wanted to get out of the classroom before she broke down in front of everyone.\nAizawa nodded, gestured for her to come forward, and she did, heading to the front of the class and ignoring her classmates. Aizawa handed her the Hall Pass with a quick order of, \u201cGive this to the old lady once you get there, alright?\u201d and Ochako nodded, already on her way out.\nShe closed the door behind her and looked down, just for a moment, at the Hall Pass Aizawa had given her. It was then she realized that it  wasn\u2019t a Hall Pass, rather a note he\u2019d written hastily for her.\n\n Uraraka - \n\n\n I\u2019m giving you a sick day. Go home and rest. \n\nOchako swallowed thickly, stuffed the note into her back pocket, and started down the hallway in the opposite direction. So Aizawa knew her true intentions. And it was pretty obvious, too, when she thought about it. Her classmates probably knew she didn\u2019t really want to go to the nurse\u2019s office.\nOchako started down the hall, keeping her head down. No one else was around, which was good; they wouldn\u2019t have to see her tears, and she wouldn\u2019t have to see them. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to speak without cracking.\nThere was a dimly lit hallway on the other side of the school; she\u2019d found it one day while walking with Iida and...and Deku. She knew exactly where it was. It was a place she could be alone, where no one else would be able to find her unless they followed her.\nShe could be alone.\nShe stepped into the hallway and stood there, her entire body rigid. She shut her eyes, and instantly, without her consent, she was flooded with memories of a better time, memories of her and Deku walking the long hallways towards their classes, reading the news on their smartphones, fangirling over pro heroes\u2026\nThe tears finally broke free, and Ochako sobbed, burying her face in her hands. She lost her balance, stumbling to the side and slamming back-first into the wall, but she didn\u2019t care. She slid to the floor, pulling her hands from her face and wrapping her arms around her legs instead.\nHer best friend was  gone.  He was...  gone,  gone  forever,  and she just...she couldn\u2019t  stand it.  Everywhere she looked, there was a memory of Deku. Everywhere she turned, she was slammed with the reality that  he wasn\u2019t here anymore. \nShe sobbed, harder than she\u2019d ever sobbed in her entire life, that lump in her throat and ache in her chest doing nothing to help. She couldn\u2019t breathe again, not that it mattered; she hadn\u2019t been able to breathe freely ever since that horrible day on the mountaintop.\n\u201cUraraka.\u201d\nOchako\u2019s head shot up, and she found herself staring into Iida\u2019s pained, glistening eyes. He was standing at the front of the hallway, keeping a distance between her and him, no doubt to give her her own space.\n\u201cI-I-Iida,\u201d Ochako stammered, wiping her tears away (to no avail -- new tears replaced them in an instant). Her voice was thick and strained, and every word was a struggle to get out. \u201cI-I-I\u2019m s-s-sorry, I-I just\u2026\u201d\nIida looked down briefly, and then, meeting her eyes again, he raised his hands and spread his arms.\nShe waited a beat, and then, she was on her feet, running towards him and leaping into his open arms. Her tears fell harder than ever, and she squeezed Iida impossibly tight.\n\u201cI can\u2019t  do it,  Iida!\u201d she screamed against his shoulder, her chest heaving with every word.  \u201cI c-c-can\u2019t do it!!  E-Every t-time...e-every time I l-look around, I-I just...I c-can\u2019t...  I c-c-can\u2019t--\u201d \nIn a better time, she, Iida and Deku were laughing, walking home together after school, running through practice drills, eating lunch at the cafeteria\u2026\n\u201cI...I know,\u201d Iida said thickly, and Ochako was brought back to the present. The present she no longer wanted to be a part of. The present that  Deku wasn\u2019t a part of.\n \u201cI want him back!\u201d  Ochako screamed, loudly and longly, burying her face against Iida\u2019s shoulder. Her entire body was trembling, and in this embrace, she could feel Iida shaking, too.  \u201cI WANT HIM BACK, IIDA!! I...I j-just\u2026\u201d\n\n \u201cIt would be bad luck if you fell, right?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cOh, well I think it\u2019s an awesome name! It sounds like the Japanese word for, \u2018You can do it,\u2019 so I like it!\u201d \n\n\n \u201cI used to hate this name, but someone changed the meaning of it.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cI made a strategy for you to use against Kacchan!\u201d \n\nThe memories came flooding again, and she couldn\u2019t escape them no matter how hard she tried. These little snippets of time, of a  better time...they seemed so long ago.\n\u201cI-I just...w-want my friend b-back,\u201d Ochako whispered, and she broke off into another round of sobs and tears. \u00a0\nIida tightened his embrace. \u201c...I know,\u201d he said, his voice thick, and Ochako could hear the tears behind the words. \u201cI...I want him back, too.\u201d\nAnd Ochako cried harder.\nIf this was truly reality\u2026\n...A reality without Deku in it, well\u2026\n...She didn\u2019t want it.\nDeku and Bakug\u014d weren\u2019t friends. They\u2019d never  been  friends, so Bakug\u014d couldn\u2019t understand why it  bothered him  so much now that Deku just...  wasn\u2019t there  anymore. Bakug\u014d literally could not put his finger on it. He didn\u2019t  care  about Deku. Deku was just a useless nobody who somehow managed to squeeze his way into the Hero Academy, he meant  nothing to Bakug\u014d.\nBut...if that was truly the case\u2026\nBakug\u014d wouldn\u2019t have felt the way he did. He wouldn\u2019t have felt this sudden emptiness and despair. While Deku and Bakug\u014d had never exactly been \u201cfriends,\u201d Bakug\u014d had known Deku since they were little, so if Bakug\u014d  did  have \u201cfriends,\u201d Deku would be the closest thing  to one.\nAnd now he was\u2026\n\n Gone. \n\nBut of course, Bakug\u014d wasn\u2019t going to let the others see just how much it upset him. So, when he was alone, he took his anger out on random walls, locker rooms, trees outside the building,  anything. \nAnd if the teachers or his classmates noticed the burn marks, they ignored it, which was fine with Bakug\u014d.\nAfter all, Bakug\u014d  didn\u2019t care.\n(Or, at least, that was what he kept telling himself.)\nIt was a week later, and Hagakure was watching the news in the Student Lounge. A new hero had debuted, a  strong hero with a truly fascinating Quirk, and with a wide, beaming smile, Hagakure leapt to her feet.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so cool!\u201d Hagakure gushed, turning and making for the door. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Midoriya about this, he\u2019s gonna  flip!\u201d \nShe barely made it two steps before she remembered.\nIt was Sato\u2019s idea to start something called \u201cThe Box,\u201d and Mineta and Aoyama were the ones who helped carry it out. They found an old filing box with a lid, cut a thin, five-inch slit through the top, and taped the lid down so no one could open it.\nOn the front and top of the box, they wrote the words, \u201cTo Midoriya,\u201d and every now and then, one of their classmates would take a sheet of paper, write a quick note, and slip it into The Box. There was one rule: The Box was never to be opened.\nIt didn\u2019t have to be anything major or special. Mineta wrote little tiny snippets of sentences, things like, \u201cYou\u2019re a great friend, Midoriya,\u201d and Aoyama did likewise. Neither of them knew Midoriya well enough to write much of anything else, but they wrote whatever they could.\nThe rest of Class 1-A did likewise, sometimes short letters and sometimes longer letters. Todoroki slipped in three one day; Ochako added a letter at least  once every day; Iida added letters periodically, but when he did add them, he always added at least three; and so on and so forth.\nBefore long, The Box was so full they couldn\u2019t cram a single letter in, and they made another box just like the first one, and the process repeated. Before long, they\u2019d gone through four boxes, which they kept by Midoriya\u2019s still-empty desk in Classroom 1-A. The letters just kept coming in, too. Everyone had something to say.\nAll except Jiro, who hadn\u2019t written a single thing to Midoriya since that tragic day on the mountaintop.\nJiro was in the Student Lounge, lying on her back on one of the couches, when her phone rang for what felt like the utmost time that day. She snatched her phone off the side table and stared at the contact with a merciless glare: the word \u201cDad\u201d stared back at her.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time her father had tried to call her, but this was the first time Jiro decided to answer. She accepted the call, got to her feet, and spoke.\n\u201cYeah, what?\u201d she snapped, her voice coming out harsher than she\u2019d meant for it to.\n\n \u201cHey, Kyouka! I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to reach ya for days! How are you, sweetheart?\u201d \n\nJiro gritted her teeth. \u201cOh, just fine,\u201d she spat bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my classmate just  died or anything.\u201d\nThere was a long beat of pure silence on the other side of the line.  \u201c...I saw it on the news,\u201d  her father said slowly.  \u201cI know exactly what happened, Kyouka. I wanted to call in and check on ya, make sure you were alright.\u201d \nJiro bit back her next exclamation. Her father didn\u2019t deserve her anger, but she was just so... mad.  Not at her dad, not at her classmates, not even at the  villain  who\u2019d done this, but rather...  herself. \n\u201cIt was my fault, Dad,\u201d Jiro said, maintaining the bitter edge while also managing to soften her tone considerably. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s my fault Midoriya...it\u2019s my fault my classmate, my  friend\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cKyouka, you ain\u2019t gonna like what I\u2019m gonna say, but it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d \n\nJiro\u2019s fury returned in a flash, and she completely exploded. \u201cThat\u2019s what  everyone\u2019s  told me!\u201d she screeched, swinging her arm around and punching the wall unproductively. \u201cThey  all  say the same thing, that it  wasn\u2019t  my fault, that there was  nothing  I could do about it, and--and it\u2019s a  lie!\u201d  Jiro\u2019s voice cracked, but she pumelled on. \u201cThey\u2019re all  lying!!  They  know  it\u2019s my fault!! They  know it is!!\u201d\n\n \u201c...Kyouka, no one blames you. No one, ya hear?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, I  don\u2019t  hear!!\u201d Jiro screamed. \u201cI  don\u2019t!!  I don\u2019t care that  they  don\u2019t blame me! It\u2019s the fact that they say it\u2019s  not  my fault when they  know  it  is!\u201d \nShe was angry. Angry with herself. Because she\u2019d been the one who was on look-out. She\u2019d been assigned to the job as part of the Survival Training. And it was because she failed that she didn\u2019t notice the villain, and because she didn\u2019t notice the villain that Midoriya leapt into save her, and because he leapt into save her that he...that he\u2026\n \u201cHE WAS MY F-FRIEND!!\u201d  Jiro screamed, her voice breaking without her willing it to, and her tears finally broke free, tears of frustration, anger, and most importantly,  regret  and  loss.  \u201cHE WAS MY  FRIEND,  DAD, MY  CLASSMATE!  AND...A-AND...  AND HE DIDN\u2019T DESERVE TO DIE!!\u201d \nShe punched the wall again, wishing she could go back in time and change what\u2019d happened, wishing she could go back and  notice  the villain, wishing she could go back and make sure Midoriya  didn\u2019t try to save her.\n \u201cW-WHY HIM!!?\u201d  Jiro screeched, slamming her fist against the wall once again.  \u201cWHY HIM!? WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE HIM!? HE WAS...HE WAS THE  LAST  PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO DESERVED IT!! WHY HIM!? WHY COULDN\u2019T\u2026\u201d \nShe sucked in a shaky breath, her throat feeling like it\u2019d been torn to ribbons.\n \u201cWHY COULDN\u2019T IT HAVE BEEN ME!?\u201d she yelled. She was talking to herself now, not her father, and she didn\u2019t care. She punched the wall for the utmost time; something in her hand cracked, and she was sure she\u2019d fractured something, but she didn\u2019t care even now.\n\u201cWHY!?\u201d\nPunch.\n\"WHY!?\u201d\nPunch.\n\"WHY!?\u201d\nPunch.\n\"WHY!?\u201d\nPunch.\n\n \u201cWHY!!?\u201d \n\nShe punched the wall one final time, and this time, she slid to the floor in a heap, her hands shaking so badly she could barely hold the phone. She was breathing heavily, and it seemed  impossible  to draw enough air into her lungs. Her tears were beginning to pick up speed, and no matter how hard she tried to get ahold of herself, to tell herself that she  didn\u2019t have the right to cry like this, she couldn\u2019t stop.\n\u201cH-H-He d-d-didn\u2019t deserve it, Dad,\u201d Jiro whispered, her voice cracking and breaking in a million different places.  \u201cM-M-Midoriya d-d-didn\u2019t deserve t-to die.\u201d \nHer father said nothing, and Jiro hadn\u2019t expected him to.\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n You\u2019re an amazing friend. Thanks for what you did for us at the USJ. You were super cool! I hope I can be a hero like you someday. \n\n\n - Mineta \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midori - \n\n\n Thank you soooo much for being willing to help me study. I bet we would\u2019ve had a lot of fun. And...I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t bring help fast enough. \n\n\n - Mina \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Thank you for what you did for me at the Sports Festival. You\u2019re an incredible friend, and I don\u2019t think words could ever describe just how much of an impact you had on my life. You changed me, Midoriya, changed me for the better, and...thank you. Thank you so much. \n\n\n - Todoroki \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Hey there, buddy! Um, I\u2019m horrible at writing letters, but I wanted to say something, so...erm...thanks, for being such a great bro and friend. This place really sucks without you. \n\n\n - Kirishima \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Heya, dude. It feels pretty screwed up, all of this. I mean, you\u2019re just...not here anymore, and it feels super, super messed up. Like, a LOT, and...well...crap, man, I don\u2019t even know what to say. Just...thanks, for everything, I guess, and...and I\u2019m sorry there wasn\u2019t more I could do. \n\n\n - Kaminari \n\n\u00a0\n\n Deku - \n\n\n Hi, Deku. I...I wish you were here. It\u2019s just...not the same without you. I miss you, a lot, and...and I think about you every day. You\u2019re my best friend, and...and, I wish I\u2019d cherished the time I had with you more. If I\u2019d known all of THIS would happen\u2026 \n\n\n Sorry, I\u2019m just...I\u2019m just rambling right now. I\u2019ll write again, when...when I can think a little clearer. Thanks...thanks for being such a great friend, Deku. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll never forget you. I promise. \n\n\n - Ochako \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly, honestly sorry. You gave me the responsibility of Class Representative, and when it came down to it, I failed to protect you...and to save you. I\u2019m sorry, Midoriya, for everything. You believed in me, and I let you down. \n\n\n Thank you for believing in me, and for helping me when I was in a rough spot. I admire your bravery more than I could ever say, and...and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t save you. I failed, not just as the Class Representative, but also as your friend. \n\n\n - Iida \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Thank you for believing in me at the Sports Festival, and for letting me a part of your team. You\u2019re a true, brilliant genius, and an even better friend, and thank you. I\u2019m sorry it had to end this way. \n\n\n - Tokoyami \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I failed you. I couldn\u2019t stop the villain in time to save you, and...and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, and I know I\u2019ll never be able to say that enough times. I wish I could have known you better. \n\n\n And...and thank you for saving Jiro. You\u2019re a truly amazing person and friend. \n\n\n - Yaoyorozu \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n You\u2019re the true hero among us. \n\n\n - Aoyama \n\n\u00a0\n\nMidoriya - \n\n\n You\u2019re a great friend. Thank you. \n\n\n -Kouda \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n You were incredible at the Sports Festival. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take the chance to get to know you better. You seem like an amazing person. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure that much out. \n\n\n I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to know you, and I\u2019m sorry I could do nothing to save you. Thank you for your compassion and your kindness. \n\n\n - Shoji \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Even though you didn\u2019t have the chance to actually graduate, you\u2019re a hero to us. It takes an insane amount of courage to do what you did to save Jiro. I always respected you, but now, I respect you ten times more. \n\n\n - Sato \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n Dude, what you did was crazy. It really made me take a look at myself and think, \u201cWould I have done what Midoriya did, even if I knew it would kill me?\u201d You\u2019re seriously the most heroic in our classroom, and nothing will ever change that. I\u2019m so glad I had the chance to know you. You\u2019re a great friend, not just to me, but to everyone in Class 1-A. \n\n\n - Sero \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I didn\u2019t really get the chance to know you as well as I would\u2019ve liked, but you\u2019re a seriously incredible person, and an equally incredible friend. Thanks for always being there for us. \n\n\n - Ojiro \n\n\u00a0\n\n Deku - \n\n\n You\u2019re an idiot. A frickin\u2019 idiot. You know that, right? You\u2019d BETTER know that. Ever since you went and freaking DIED on everyone, I\u2019ve been...ARGH, I\u2019ve been UPSET, okay!? What makes you think you had the right to go frickin\u2019 DIE on all of us, huh!? Just who do you think you are!? \n\n\n - Bakug\u014d \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t save you in time. This is my fault. \n\n\n - Tsuyu \n\n\u00a0\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I saw this really cool hero on TV the other day, and I was going to tell you, but...it actually took me a minute or two before I remembered that you aren\u2019t really HERE anymore. It\u2019s not the same without you by a long shot, and...and I miss you. A lot. You were a good friend, a classmate that I trusted and respected, and I\u2019m sorry it had to end like this. I\u2019m really sorry. \n\n\n - Hagakure \n\n\u00a0\nAnd finally,  finally,  though it took a long,  long time before she could bring herself to do it, Jiro wrote her own little letter to Midoriya as well.\n\n Midoriya - \n\n\n I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly, honestly sorry. You saved me, and I couldn\u2019t do anything for you in return. I failed in the position I\u2019d been given, and I failed you, too, as a friend. I know what you\u2019d say: it\u2019s not my fault and I should forgive myself, but...I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever gonna happen. No matter how much time passes...I\u2019m never going to be able to forgive myself. Not for this. \n\n\n And...and thank you. Thank you for saving me. Even though...even though you knew it meant danger and...and, well, death...for you, you still jumped in and saved me. And...even though I wish you hadn\u2019t...thanks anyway. \n\n\n And I\u2019m sorry. Again. This...this never should\u2019ve happened. I wish it\u2019ve been me instead. \n\n\n - Jiro \n\n\nInko Midoriya was always thrilled when Izuku came home from school in the evenings. \n\n\nEver since joining the U.A., he\u2019d always come home with new stories and would tell her all about the new friends he\u2019d made, what new things he was learning, and Inko, though she didn\u2019t always understand some of the terminology he used, couldn\u2019t have been happier for him. \n\n\nIf she had any complaints--any complaints at all--it would be that he always came home sprouting new injuries, scars or bruises, something she knew she\u2019d never fully be over. As much as her son wanted to be a hero, as passionate as he was about it, it always hurt her--almost physically sometimes--to see her baby in pain. \n\n\nTonight, though, was a bit different. When her son came home that evening, he didn\u2019t seem injured, but he looked exhausted, worn down, and worried, too. \n\n\n\u201cWelcome home, sweetie!\u201d she called, smiling at him regardless of her concern. \u201cAre you hungry? I could make something for you if you like.\u201d \n\n\nBut Izuku shook his head. \u201cN-No, I\u2019m alright,\u201d he said. \u201cT-Thanks, though\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThat was the first sign that told Inko that something was wrong. She couldn\u2019t tell \n\nwhat \n\nwas wrong, but she knew her son well enough to tell that \n\nsomething \n\nwas bothering him. \n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, let me know if you change your mind, okay? There\u2019s plenty I could heat up for you.\u201d \n\n\nHe smiled at her, but she could tell it was forced. \u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d he said, and though she could tell he meant it, that he was sincere, something was definitely wrong. \n\n\nShe didn\u2019t push it, though. She trusted he\u2019d bring it to her if it was something he needed help with. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t see Izuku again until a little later on that evening, while she was washing dishes at the sink. She heard Izuku\u2019s quiet, shuffling footsteps, followed by his timid voice:\n\n\n\u201cHey, Mom...do-do you have a minute? I need to talk to you about something\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSure, Izuku,\u201d Inko replied, smiling softly at her son, shutting off the tap and drying her hands on the front of her apron. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about, sweetheart?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cE-Erm\u2026\u201d Izuku twisted his foot into the ground, his hands behind his back. He didn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cJ-Just something...at school\u2026\u201d \n\n\nInko nodded understandingly. \u201cDo you want to sit down in the living room?\u201d she asked, and when he nodded (although shakily), they headed out of the kitchen and to the living area. \n\n\nIzuku sank down onto the couch, and Inko sat beside him a moment later, waiting patiently for him to speak. He seemed really nervous about \n\nsomething, \n\nand she wasn\u2019t going to push him into telling her what was wrong, no matter how worried she was. \n\n\n\u201cE-Erm...I-I...I don\u2019t really know where to start, um\u2026\u201d Izuku fiddled restlessly, wringing his hands together. \n\n\nShe wrapped an arm around his shoulders gently, offering him an equally gentle smile. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d she said, \u201cjust...take your time.\u201d \n\n\nBut she was worried now. There weren\u2019t many instances she could recall seeing Izuku \n\nthis \n\nbothered and \n\nthis \n\nunsure. It was beginning to scare her, if she was completely honest. \n\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Izuku finally stopped fidgeting and turned towards her, though he didn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cI...I-I was born Quirkless, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Inko nodded. \n\n\n\u201cW-Well...the doctors, erm...they were wrong,\u201d Izuku went on quietly. \u201cI-I mean, no, they weren\u2019t \n\nwrong, \n\nexactly, they just...they couldn\u2019t detect the Quirk with any of the methods they used, so...it went unnoticed.\u201d \n\n\nInko blinked at him. \u201cBut, your Quirk developed later, didn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cThe one you have right now, that developed out of an abnormality\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cY-Yeah, there\u2019s that, too,\u201d Izuku said, running a hand through his dishevelled hair, \u201cb-but...t-this one\u2019s different. I...I was born with one Quirk, and the second one developed recently. Does...d-does that make sense?\u201d \n\n\nInko took a moment or two to take this in, and then, when she realized the extent of her son\u2019s words, she beamed. \u201cBut, Izuku, that\u2019s \n\nwonderful!\u201d \n\nshe said, wrapping her arms around him and hugging him, tightly and briefly. \u201cSo, you mean you \n\nweren\u2019t \n\nQuirkless all of those years? That\u2019s \n\nwonderful!\u201d \n\n(She\u2019d said it once already, but she didn\u2019t know what else to say.) \u201cWhat type of Quirk is it? Do you know?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku looked no less nervous, and he bit his lip, averting his eyes and instead staring at the ground. \u201cY-Yeah, I...I know what it does,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI-It\u2019s...it\u2019s this Quirk c-called \u2018Second Chance,\u2019 that...that \u2018revives\u2019 me once if I die.\u201d \n\n\nAnd suddenly, at that very moment, something in Inko\u2019s heart \n\nclenched, \n\nand her eyes widened. In a moment of horror, she realized why Izuku was so nervous about all this, why he stammered over his words. \n\n\n\u201c...Izuku,\u201d she said, her voice firm, \u201c...why are you telling me this now?\u201d \n\n\nBut she already had a pretty good idea. She just hoped she wasn\u2019t actually \n\nright. \n\n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly, then nodded shakily. \u201cM-Mom...up on the mountain, d-during training...w-when...when we were attacked by the villain, I\u2026\u201d \n\n\nInko\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \n\n\n\u201c...I died, Mom,\u201d Izuku whispered. \u201cI-I...I actually died.\u201d \n\n\nHer breath caught in her throat, and her eyes burned with tears. \u201cOh, Izuku\u2026!\u201d And she had her arms wrapped around him tightly, pulling him into a tight embrace, tighter than any embrace she\u2019d ever given him before, and he hugged her back, almost equally tightly. Her tears spilled over, and she buried her face against his hair, something in her heart clenching and snapping. \n\n\nHe\u2019d died. He\u2019d actually \n\ndied. \n\nThat horrible day...Inko had received a phone call then, telling her that her son was in the hospital, unconscious but \n\nalive. \n\nBut, if he \n\ndidn\u2019t \n\nhave this Quirk, if he \n\nhadn\u2019t \n\nbeen born with it\u2026\n\n\n...He\u2019d be dead. Dead. Dead. Her precious little boy, her light and life and joy, \n\ndead. \n\n\n\n\u201cI...I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say anything sooner,\u201d Izuku said quietly, his voice strained. \u201cI just...I-I didn\u2019t want to bring it up...r-right after it happened. It...it didn\u2019t feel like the right time\u2026\u201d \n\n\nInko said nothing, just squeezed him tighter and nodded, pressing a kiss into his hair. She couldn\u2019t wrap her head around it. She couldn\u2019t \n\nbelieve \n\nit. That wasn\u2019t to say she thought Izuku was \n\nlying; \n\nshe knew he wouldn\u2019t lie about something like this; it was more of her simply not \n\nwanting \n\nto believe it. \n\n\nAfter all\u2026\n\n\n...Her precious baby boy had \n\ndied. \n\n\n\nHe was \n\nhere, \n\nand he was \n\nokay now, \n\nthank \n\ngoodness, \n\nbut...but for a time, if even just for a short, small time...he\u2019d been \n\ngone. \n\nHe \n\nhadn\u2019t \n\nbeen okay. \n\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t want to \n\nimagine \n\nwhat it\u2019d been like, what he\u2019d \n\nbeen \n\nthrough. It made her feel physically sick to think about it. Dying...\n\ndying\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cI-Izuku...a-are...a-are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d she asked him at long length, after what felt like an eternity. Her sobs broke her voice. \u201cA-Are you...y-you...\n\nIzuku\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku buried her face against her shoulder, then gave a shaky nod. \u201c...I-I\u2019m okay now,\u201d he said quietly. His voice was muffled, but she heard him well enough. \u201cI-I\u2019m okay, I...I promise\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cA-Are you \n\nsure?\u201d \n\nshe asked again. \u201cB-Because...because if you\u2019re \n\nnot\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Izuku nodded again, his voice firmer than before. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m fine.\u201d \n\n\nInko closed her eyes, her arms tightening around him. She didn\u2019t want to imagine what he\u2019d been through, the fear and pain he must\u2019ve felt, and for now, she didn\u2019t. She settled for holding her \n\ndefinitely not-dead \n\nson tightly, her tears never once easing. \n\n\nBecause, at this very moment\u2026\n\n\n...She was just relieved her boy was \n\nalive. \n\n\n\nAnd right now...Izuku\u2019s \n\nbeing alive \n\nwas enough. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInko had a really hard time functioning the next couple of days. She zoned out while cooking one night (Izuku had made it to the fire extinguisher in time, thankfully), and even basic household chores were suddenly exhausting. \n\n\nAnd there was a problem, something she hadn\u2019t thought about until three days after her and Izuku\u2019s talk. \n\n\nShe didn\u2019t trust U.A.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust the teachers. They were all fine heroes and fine people, and she knew this, but...U.A. was the target of so many villains, and not just the school as a whole, but the students specifically. If you had any affiliation with U.A. whatsoever, it made you a target to a whole bunch of villains, and Inko just...couldn\u2019t imagine sending Izuku back there. \n\nHe\u2019d already died \n\nonce, \n\nand if she lost him again...for \n\nreal \n\nthis time\u2026\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to take it. She literally, \n\nliterally \n\ndidn\u2019t think her heart would be able to take it. \n\n\nShe was torn, though. Ever since he was old enough to understand how the education system worked, getting accepted into U.A. had been Izuku\u2019s goal. And now he\u2019d \n\nmade it. \n\nAnd she didn\u2019t want to \n\ntake that away \n\nfrom him. \n\n\nBut\u2026\n\n\n...He\u2019d literally \n\ndied\u2026\n\n\n\nThat was the truth of it. She tried talking herself out of it, tried to be considerate of Izuku\u2019s feelings, of what \n\nhe \n\nwould want, because he obviously had no intention of quitting U.A. any time \n\nsoon, \n\nbut in the end...the fact that Izuku had \n\ndied \n\nstill remained.\n\n\nAny argument against that was invalid. \n\n\nIzuku had died. \n\n\nThe worst-case scenario actually \n\nhappened. \n\nThe literal \n\nworst thing \n\nthat could become of Izuku\u2019s attending U.A. had \n\nactually happened. \n\n\n\nAnd they were fortunate enough for Izuku\u2019s Quirk, or he\u2019d be \n\ngone. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI need to tell the school, \n\nwas Inko\u2019s conclusion. She didn\u2019t think she was quite ready to face Izuku regarding this just yet, because she didn\u2019t know how he would take it, but...she had to tell the school. She couldn\u2019t allow this. She wasn\u2019t going to lose her son. There were other schools, other academies Inko was sure were every bit as good as U.A. He could go to one of those instead\u2026\n\n\nA little later on that evening, after Izuku had gone to finish up some homework in his room, she picked up the phone and began dialing U.A.\u2019s number. \n\n\nAnd then, before she got far, there was a knock on the front door. \n\n\nShe stopped, looking up from the phone towards the sound. \u201cWho could be knocking at \n\nthis \n\nhour\u2026?\u201d Inko pondered out loud to herself, setting down the phone and crossing the room. She settled her hand on the knob, turned it, and swung the door open. \n\n\nStanding outside was a group -- a small group, made up of maybe four or five people -- of teenagers. \n\n\nInko blinked at them in confusion, and they blinked back, almost in perfect unison. They all seemed vaguely \n\nfamiliar, \n\nlike she\u2019d seen them before, but she couldn\u2019t remember ever \n\nmeeting \n\nthem\u2026\n\n\n\u201cHeya!\u201d a boy with bright, neon-red hair said cheerily (if not a bit awkwardly), raising one hand. \u201cYou\u2019re Ms. Midoriya, right? Ermm, you don\u2019t know us, but we\u2019re friends with your son!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cKirishima!\u201d snapped a second one, this one with jet-black hair and rectangular glasses. \u201cYou\u2019re being impolite!\u201d And then, bowing lowly to Inko, he went on: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the intrusion. This is all rather sudden\u2026\u201d\n\n\nInko blinked at them again. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said after a moment or two -- all eyes were on her in an instant. \u201cW-Who are you\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Deku\u2019s friends!\u201d a girl with short brown hair and wide, bright eyes cut in. \u201cWe\u2019re his classmates at U.A. I\u2019m Ochako Uraraka, that\u2019s Iida, the quiet one is Todoroki, and the one talking earlier is Kirishima.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the red-haired boy said shakily, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly. \u201cI-I\u2019m not super good with formalities\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou guys?\u201d came Izuku\u2019s voice from behind her, and Inko looked over her shoulder; Izuku didn\u2019t meet her gaze, only stared, confused, at the group of students outside the door. \u201cWhat are you all doing here\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHey, Midoriya!\u201d Kirishima greeted, raising his hand again. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \n\n\nInko looked to them briefly, and then back to Izuku. \u201cYour classmates?\u201d she asked, and he nodded in confirmation. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for coming here unannounced and uninvited,\u201d said the one with glasses, bowing again -- his name was Iida, Inko now knew. \u201cBut, Midoriya wasn\u2019t answering his phone, and we didn\u2019t know how else to reach you\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really just here to check up on you is all,\u201d Ochako said, shifting her weight nervously. \u201cWe\u2019ve...been worried.\u201d \n\n\nAnd there was tension, and in an instant, Inko knew why. His friends must\u2019ve known the truth about what happened that day on the mountain. That would explain a few things\u2026\n\n\n\u201cWhy not come in?\u201d Inko offered immediately, stepping out of the doorway and gesturing inside. \u201cOur place isn\u2019t very big, but you\u2019re welcome to stay a while, if you like\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh, really? Thank a bunch!\u201d Kirishima, after a moment or two, bowed, and when he straightened up again, he was beaming. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to meet you, Ms. Midoriya!\u201d \n\n\nThis was all very sudden, and Inko didn\u2019t really know what to make of it, but she smiled anyway. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to meet all of you,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe tried bringing everyone, but they couldn\u2019t all make it,\u201d Kirishima told Izuku once they were in the living room; only four of Izuku\u2019s classmates had visited, namely Kirishima, Iida, Ochako, and Todoroki. They were in the living room, sitting in a circle on the floor. Inko had gone into the kitchen with a promise to return with cookies. \n\n\n\u201cI \n\ntried \n\ndragging them all here, and they really wanted to come,\u201d said Kirishima, running a hand through his hair, \u201cbut, most of \u2018em had a ton of schoolwork they were behind on, and the ones who \n\ndidn\u2019t \n\nhave schoolwork were helping the ones who \n\ndid. \n\nThey said they\u2019d visit some other time, though. Sorry.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku said, offering an uncertain smile. He hadn\u2019t been expecting this \n\nwhatsoever, \n\nbut it was a pleasant surprise. \u201cI\u2019m glad you guys came.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd I really \n\nam \n\nsorry for the intrusion,\u201d Iida kept saying -- he said it a lot, in fact, so much so to the point where the others were beginning to be annoyed by it. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t answer your phone, we should have just left it at that and visited some other time.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku said again. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m glad to see you guys.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWell, I \n\ntechnically \n\nalso have a lot of schoolwork to do,\u201d Kirishima admitted, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cbut, well....YOLO. Well, unless you\u2019re Midoriya, in which case, YOLT, as in you only live twice--\u201d He stopped suddenly mid-sentence. \u201cAh crap, Midoriya! Sorry! I-I shouldn\u2019t make jokes like that--!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku said, cutting Kirishima off mid-rant. \u201cI-I mean...I know it was horrible, but...it\u2019s over now, so I\u2019d rather make jokes about it than act like...like it\u2019s something to still be upset over.\u201d \n\n\nKirishima didn\u2019t look completely convinced. \u201cA-Are you sure?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku nodded, and then, after another moment or two of thought, \u201cYOLT,\u201d he said. \n\n\nKirishima blinked, and then, with a smile, \u201cYOLT.\u201d \n\n\nThere was a beat or so of silence (Izuku couldn\u2019t decide whether or not there was tension) before Ochako spoke. \n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d Ochako asked. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been...doing okay,\u201d Izuku said after a moment of thought. \u201cN-Not \n\nsuper \n\nwell, but, I mean...\n\nbetter.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c...If you ever need any help, you know you can tell us, right?\u201d Todoroki asked, and it was more of a statement than an actual question. \n\n\nOchako nodded feverishly. \u201cWe\u2019re \n\nalways \n\nhere for you, Deku.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHeck \n\nyeah \n\nwe are!!\u201d Kirishima roared, leaping to his feet and punching his fist into the air. \u201cIf something happens, don\u2019t be afraid to call on your bro, \u2018kay, dude? We\u2019ve got your back!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s...thanks,\u201d Izuku breathed, unsure of how to respond to that. \u201cAnd...you guys, you...you don\u2019t have to be all...overprotective, you know? I told you I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThe room suddenly fell silent, and Kirishima sank to the ground again, his cheerfulness gone. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201c...I believe we\u2019re all aware of that, Midoriya,\u201d Iida spoke after a beat of heavy silence, \u201cand, I\u2019m sure over time we\u2019ll take that to heart, but, for now\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cJust let us be overprotective, alright?\u201d Kirishima said, reaching over and punching Izuku on the shoulder. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose you again.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly, then nodded. \u201c...Okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut, anyways, enough of this depressing stuff!\u201d Kirishima went right back to his loud, cheerful self, and he leapt to his feet again, this time grabbing his backpack off the couch and digging through it. \u201cI\u2019ve got some movies we can stream!\u201d \n\n\nAnd in an instant, they went from talking about Izuku\u2019s death to debating on whether to watch Star Wars or Wall-E.\n\n\n\u201cStar Wars or Wall-E, Midoriya?\u201d Kirishima asked. \n\n\n\u201cErrm...Star Wars.\u201d \n\n\nIida stared at him. \u201cYou betray me.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cS-Sorry!\u201d Izuku waved his hands. \u201cI-It\u2019s a r-really tough choice\u2026!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI like Wall-E,\u201d said Ochako, raising her hand into the air. \n\n\n\u201cWell, Todoroki, what do you say?\u201d Kirishima asked. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Wall-E or Star Wars.\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki looked down for a long, long time, thinking. \n\n\nAnd then, \n\n\n\u201cWall-E.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cTRAITOR!\u201d Kirishima screeched, pointing dramatically at Todoroki. Todoroki shrugged, and Kirishima whirled around to face Izuku. \u201cMIDORIYA! YOU CAN\u2019T TELL ME YOU\u2019RE OKAY WITH THIS!!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-I like both movies, s-so I\u2019m fine with either\u2026\u201d Izuku said, rubbing the back of his neck. \n\n\nKirishima put a hand against his chest. \u201cBetrayed by my own friends...how could this happen?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019s okay!\u201d Ochako said. \u201cWe can watch Star Wars later!\u201d\n\n\nAnd after much more complaining on Kirishima\u2019s part and reassurance on Ochako\u2019s, Kirishima set up his laptop, and they all crowded around to watch. \n\n\nAnd although Izuku\u2019s friends were insane at times, he wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInko listened from the kitchen, feeling torn between laughing and crying. Up until now, she\u2019d only heard stories about her son\u2019s classmates, and she\u2019d seen them at the Sports Festival as well (that was where she\u2019d vaguely recognized them from, she realized), but she was meeting them for the first time, and\u2026\n\n\n...And so far, they were all very considerate, nice, wonderful people, and even more wonderful friends. The fact that they\u2019d come here just to make sure her son was okay was just...\n\noverwhelming \n\nto her. \n\n\nUp until recently, Izuku just...didn\u2019t have any friends. There was that Katsuki boy, but Inko didn\u2019t trust him, and he didn\u2019t really fit Inko\u2019s definition of a \u201cfriend.\u201d And not only that, but Izuku had just seemed...\n\ndepressed. \n\nEven if he was good at hiding it while out in public, Inko knew him well enough. \n\n\nBut ever since he joined U.A., all of that...\n\nchanged. \n\nHe smiled a lot more, and not only that, but he had \n\nfriends. \n\nTrue, honest, \n\nwonderful \n\nfriends, who cared about him and looked after him. \n\n\nEvery now and then, she would stand by the doorway leading into the living room, listening in. They\u2019d put on a movie, but they were all giving more commentary than actually watching. \n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so cute together\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI ship it.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWaitwaitWAIT I can make a pun out of that, hang on---\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat, because they\u2019re on a spaceship?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cKirishima, shh! I like this part!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s...oh, it\u2019s the little cleany-dude! I love this guy! Hey buddy!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cFor some reason, he reminds me of Iida\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat!? How so!?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOoh, now that you mention it, I kinda see what you mean\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI \n\ndon\u2019t see it! Why are you comparing me to a robot!?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cShhh! Keep it down! We\u2019re trying to watch a movie!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cKirishima I \n\nswear\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nIt was fun to listen to, and it made Inko smile, because Izuku was \n\nhappy. \n\nThere weren\u2019t many times she could look back to in the past and think of when he\u2019d been genuinely happy like he was now.\n\n\nIt was\u2026\n\n\n...It was a nice change. A welcomed change. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Inko asked, stepping into the living room after their movies were over, \u201cwould you mind making sure I locked the back door? I can never remember whether or not I did.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSure!\u201d Izuku said, nodding, already getting to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d he told his friends, and then, he turned and started down the hall, disappearing a moment later. \n\n\nInko bit her lip, fiddling slightly with the hem of her shirt. \u201c...You four are Kirishima, Iida, Todoroki, and Uraraka, correct?\u201d she asked after a moment or two of silence. \n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Iida got to his feet and bowed; behind him, the others followed in suit. \u201cThank you for having us!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m glad to have you over,\u201d Inko said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to finally meet my son\u2019s friends. If anything, I...I should be the one thanking you. But...I have to ask\u2026\u201d \n\n\nShe paused, turning her gaze towards the floor, not quite sure how to word what she said next. \n\n\n\u201cIs Izuku...is he...\n\nhappy, \n\nat U.A.?\u201d she asked. \u201cI-I mean, not just that, but...how is he, in general?\u201d \n\n\nThey exchanged glances, then looked back at her. \n\n\n\u201cDeku\u2019s...he\u2019s usually really upbeat and optimistic about just about everything,\u201d Ochako said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said it \n\nspecifically, \n\nbut...I know he likes U.A.\u201d \n\n\n\u201c...I may be overstepping my bounds by saying this,\u201d Todoroki said suddenly, \u201cbut...this isn\u2019t really about that, is it?\u201d \n\n\nInko bit her lip again. \u201c...No, it\u2019s not,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI just...my son, he\u2019s...he\u2019s all I have. He\u2019s the most precious thing in the world to me, and...and after what happened\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThe four youths stiffened immediately, and after a moment or two, Inko went on. \n\n\n\u201c...I\u2019m considering...pulling him out of U.A.,\u201d Inko stated. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s something I\u2019ve...actually been considering for quite some time now.\u201d \n\n\nShe\u2019d expected shock from her son\u2019s friends, but instead, all she saw was silent understanding in their faces, like they\u2019d been expecting this. \n\n\n\u201c...I understand your reasoning behind that,\u201d Iida said quietly. \u201cAnd...I believe it\u2019s just the natural thing for someone in your position to do. If I\u2019m completely honest...I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d \n\n\nInko only nodded, fiddling with her shirt again. For a long, long time, neither party said anything. \n\n\nAnd then, \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll protect him,\u201d Kirishima stated firmly, and instantly, all eyes were on him. \u201cMidoriya\u2019s my buddy,\u201d Kirishima told them, \u201cand I\u2019m not gonna let anything happen to him again.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Todoroki said, nodding. \u201cI owe a lot to Midoriya, and, he\u2019s my friend as well. If you choose to let him continue attending U.A., Ms. Midoriya...we\u2019ll protect him.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDeku\u2019s my friend...no, my \n\nbest \n\nfriend,\u201d Ochako added. \u201cAnd...and I\u2019m never going to let him get hurt like that again.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd I promise to look after him as well,\u201d Iida said. \u201cMidoriya trusted me enough to elect me Class Representative, and as such, and as his friend...it\u2019s my duty to make sure he stays safe.\u201d \n\n\nInko looked at each of them in turn, feeling more torn than ever before in her life. Her son had died, \n\ndied, \n\nliterally \n\ndied, \n\nbut he had friends at U.A., friends who loved and cared for him, friends who swore to protect him, friends in \n\ngeneral. \n\n\n\nInko swallowed thickly.\n\n\n\u201c...You\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll...you\u2019ll look after him, you\u2019ll...you\u2019ll try to keep him from doing anything reckless, to the best of your abilities...you\u2019ll...you\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d\n\n\nAnd in unison, Kirishima, Iida, Ochako, and Todoroki nodded firmly, without any hesitation whatsoever. \n\n\n\u201c...Alright,\u201d Inko said, and the word was hard to get out. \u201cI trust you.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ochako said, smiling fragile. \n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let you down,\u201d Kirishima promised. \n\n\nAnd Inko smiled. \u201cI know you won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \n\n\nAnd while she knew she would worry, and she knew Izuku would always be in danger, so long as he was on the path to becoming a hero\u2026\n\n\n...She knew his friends would look after him. She knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt. \n\n\nAnd that was enough. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAizawa-sensei? Do you have a minute?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d was Aizawa\u2019s curt response, his voice as deadpan as ever. The rest of the students of Class 1-A filed out after morning homeroom; Izuku told Ochako and Iida to go on without him, that he would meet up with them later, and they, too, headed off. \n\n\n\u201cWhatever this is, make it quick,\u201d Aizawa told him, stacking a few papers idly on his desk. \u201cYou have other classes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cY-Yes,\u201d Izuku said, fiddling with the hem of his uniform for a moment or two. \u201cE-Erm, s-see, the thing is\u2026\u201d \n\n\nAizawa looked at him, his face devoid of emotion. \u201cJust spit it out, Midoriya,\u201d he said, not rudely, but not particularly patiently, either. \u201cStalling isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly. It\u2019d taken a lot of mental wrestling with himself before he finally caved and decided to tell Aizawa the truth of what happened on \n\nthat day \n\n(as his classmates had gotten used to calling it). \n\n\nBut it was still harder to tell Aizawa than it\u2019d been to tell the others. The thing about telling the others was, he knew them, and they were his close friends, more like \n\nfamily. \n\n\n\nAnd while he respected Aizawa, and he knew Aizawa cared for him and his classmates\u2026\n\n\n...It was harder. \n\n\n\u201c...On the mountain,\u201d Izuku said, \u201cd-during Survival Training\u2026\u201d \n\n\n(Aizawa stopped fiddling with the papers.)\n\n\n\u201c...I-I wasn\u2019t a-actually saved in time,\u201d Izuku stammered. \u201cI-I...I-I actually...I died.\u201d \n\n\nAizawa stared at him for a moment or two. \u201c...What are you talking about, Midoriya?\u201d he questioned. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnd (albeit hastily, and he tripped over his words more than once), Izuku told him exactly what he\u2019d told All Might, his classmates, and his mother. Aizawa listened silently, maintaining his same, flat, emotionless face. \n\n\n\u201c...S-S-So...t-that happened,\u201d Izuku finished, his shoulders stiff. \u201cI-It\u2019s pretty crazy, I-I know, so...so I\u2019d understand if...if you didn\u2019t believe me--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot of things, Midoriya,\u201d Aizawa interrupted, \u201cbut a \n\nliar \n\ncertainly isn\u2019t one of them. And even then, I doubt even the most dedicated prankster would joke around about something like \n\nthis.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cS-So...so you believe me?\u201d \n\n\nAizawa nodded briefly. \u201c...But, Midoriya...this means you actually...\n\ndied, \n\ncorrect?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku nodded. \u201cY-Yes, sir.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDied.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\nAizawa stared at him. \u201c...Are you alright?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cY-Yeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku said (he said that a lot, it seemed -- whenever this subject came up, in fact). \u201cI-I told Recovery Girl, and...and she said I was fine--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean physically. I mean mentally. Emotionally. That kind of thing.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d \n\n\nIzuku bit his lip. \n\n\n\u201cI-I am now,\u201d he decided. \u201cA-At first, I think I was in shock over the whole thing, so...it didn\u2019t really \n\nsink in \n\nuntil just recently, when I told my classmates about it\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou told your classmates?\u201d Aizawa asked, and Izuku nodded. \u201cThat explains their paranoia, at least,\u201d Aizawa sighed. \u201cI was beginning to think something was seriously wrong with them, but now I understand.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cY-Yeah, they\u2019re...they\u2019re freaked out about it,\u201d Izuku said, shifting his gaze towards his shoes. \u201cThey\u2019ve been really protective lately\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d Aizawa nodded shortly. \u201c...Thank you for telling me, Midoriya. I know this must have been hard on you.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku\u2019s head snapped up, and he stared at his teacher with wide, disbelieving eyes. This was the first time he\u2019d heard such genuine sincerity in Aizawa\u2019s tone. \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised,\u201d Aizawa droned. \u201cNo matter how annoying you brats can be, you\u2019re still my students. I care about each of you a great deal.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku already knew this, but actually hearing it from Aizawa himself was different, more reassuring. \n\n\n\u201cAnd, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there to protect you,\u201d Aizawa went on, and Izuku tore himself out of his thoughts to listen. \u201cYou were put under my watch and responsibility, and...well, you died, so obviously I failed.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cN-No, you don\u2019t have to apologize,\u201d Izuku blurted, \u201cit\u2019s okay. I...I don\u2019t really want anyone else to apologize. I\u2019d...I-I\u2019d rather just...m-move on a-and forget this ever happened.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Midoriya,\u201d Aizawa deadpanned, \u201cbut a person\u2019s feelings and emotions aren\u2019t something they can just \n\nforget,\n\n now are they?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku bit his lip, then shook his head. \n\n\n\u201cSo allow me to apologize,\u201d Aizawa said. \u201cWhether you take it or leave it is your choice.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cO-Okay\u2026\u201d Izuku murmured. \u201cT-Thank you.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd from here on out, I promise to watch over you more closely,\u201d Aizawa continued. \u201cAnd no more Survival Training. I thought the whole thing was stupid from the beginning\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d Izuku said quietly. \u201cI-I guess\u2026\u201d \n\n\nAizawa nodded, taking up a pen from the desk and scribbling something down on a small slip of paper. \u201cHere, take this,\u201d Aizawa said, passing the paper to Izuku. \u201cIt\u2019s a note for Recovery Girl. I want you to have her look at you again and make sure you\u2019re alright.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku blinked at the paper, then up at his teacher. \u201cB-But she already did--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me on this one, Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI-I said I\u2019m f-fine--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou literally died, I\u2019m allowed to double-check.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku opened his mouth again, decided against it, then sighed. \u201cY-Yes sir,\u201d he relented with a small nod of his head. \n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Aizawa said, reaching over and patting him on the shoulder. \u201cGo have the old lady look you over, and then, I want you to go home for the day.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku\u2019s head snapped up again. \u201cWait, why?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve been sleeping right.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku stopped, clenching his teeth behind his lips. He couldn\u2019t exactly \n\nargue \n\nwith that; ever since \n\nthat day, \n\nhe\u2019d been having frequent nightmares, bouts of insomnia, and times when he was just too overwhelmed with the gravity of the situation to even \n\nconsider \n\nsleeping. \n\n\n\u201cAfter you see the nurse, go home,\u201d Aizawa told him. \u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll give you a week\u2019s extension on the upcoming exam.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly. \u201cI-I think I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m sure you do. Now go.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku nodded, bowed briefly, then turned and headed off. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo say Aizawa was shocked would have been the greatest understatement in the world. \n\n\nThe moment Midoriya closed the door behind him, Aizawa let out a long sigh, shutting his eyes briefly as his thoughts raced. \n\n\nMidoriya had died. \n\n\nHis student, someone who had been put under his care, had actually died. \n\n\nThis...wasn\u2019t something Aizawa knew he would be able to get over any time soon. Honestly, he was a bit too shocked by this entire situation for it to even \n\nsink in. \n\n\n\nAizawa took up the papers, stashed them away, then turned and left the classroom. He could deal with his own conflicting thoughts later. Right now, he had to find out what the rest of Class 1-A was up to regarding this situation. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIzuku Midoriya Protection Squad.\u201d \n\n\nThat was the title Class 1-A (minus Midoriya) dubbed themselves. It was supposed to be a secret, Aizawa realized, but a teacher had his ways, and before long, Aizawa knew that the class held their own \u201cmeetings\u201d in the Student Lounge after school, after the rest of the students had long since gone home. \n\n\nIt was during this time that Aizawa found himself standing outside the closed door of the Student Lounge; the members of Class 1-A (minus Midoriya of course) were inside. While this whole thing was supposed to be a \u201csecret\u201d shared only by the students of Class 1-A Minus One, they weren\u2019t exactly \n\nsubtle \n\nwhatsoever, and Aizawa could hear their voices through the door. \n\n\n\u201cAizawa sent Midoriya home early today,\u201d came Mina\u2019s voice. \u201cDoes anyone know why?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d answered Sero in a knowing tone. \u201cI mean, did you see the dark rings beneath his eyes? He didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d slept in a week.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWait, are we talking about Aizawa or Midoriya?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Midoriya, Mineta.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBut, I mean, it makes sense when you think about it,\u201d said Kaminari with a long sigh. \u201cI mean, Midoriya did say he \n\ndied, \n\ndidn\u2019t he? I don\u2019t know much about \n\ndying, \n\nbut, I mean...could you imagine what\u2019s going through his head right now? What he\u2019s \n\nfeeling?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Deku told his mom, too,\u201d came Ochako\u2019s quiet, concerned voice. \u201cThat...that was probably pretty hard for him to do.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSo what do we do from here?\u201d Kirishima asked. \u201cWhat about you, Bakug\u014d? What do you think? \n\n\n\u201cThat you\u2019re all frickin\u2019 idiots.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI mean, what do you think about Midoriya?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDid I stutter?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe we should back off a bit for now,\u201d said Iida with a very Big-Brother tone of voice. \u201cNow that the truth is out in the open, I believe we should give Midoriya some space. He\u2019s not hiding anything from us anymore, after all.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI think Iida\u2019s right,\u201d said Yaoyorozu. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019ll just give Midoriya some time. If we think he needs help, or if his health deteriorates any further, we\u2019ll assert ourselves.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d said Sato. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Recovery Girl has noticed,\u201d Tsuyu piped up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for things to slip by her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already handling the situation.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cEven so, if Midoriya needs the extra help, we\u2019ll gladly give it,\u201d said Tokoyami firmly. \u201cAre we all in agreement to Iida\u2019s plan?\u201d \n\n\nThere was a long chorus of \u201cYes\u201des and \u201cAye\u201ds and \u201cDefinitely\u201ds (plus an angry snort from Bakug\u014d, though he didn\u2019t disagree). \n\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re all in agreement,\u201d said Iida, clapping his hands together. \u201cIf that\u2019s all we have to talk about, dismissed.\u201d \n\n\nAizawa stepped away from the door and headed down the hallway once more; behind him, he heard the door open, followed by a chorus of footsteps and chattering voices as his students filed out of the Lounge. \n\n\nAizawa exhaled sharply through his nose, something reminiscent of a smile playing on his face. \u00a0\n\n\nHis students were insane, completely reckless, and they got into trouble more often than not\u2026\n\n\n...But all in all, they were good kids. Good friends. No, \n\ngreat \n\nfriends. \n\n\nAnd, although he wouldn\u2019t admit it out loud, Aizawa was proud of them. \n\n\n(And he was in mutual agreement with them when it came to the \u201cIzuku Midoriya Protection Squad\u201d -- but that was also something he wouldn\u2019t admit out loud).\n\n\n\nSometimes, Izuku saw the other reality. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen very often, and the times it did happen were far and few between, but it happened. Sometimes he\u2019d be in class, and the scene would shift suddenly. He\u2019d see his classmates looking much less like themselves, with saddened, hard eyes. And then he\u2019d shift back into this reality as though nothing had happened at all. \n\n\nIt was a side-effect of his stupid Quirk\u2014the one he\u2019d been born with. Sometimes he thought maybe his Quirk-self, the Not-Him he\u2019d met in that dreamscape, was just toying with him relentlessly. Not letting him rest even after literally dying. \n\n\nBut that was just him theorizing. He hoped Not-Him died with the single usage of Second Chance. \n\n\n\u201cHey, Midoriya?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku turned. Aizawa had just called an end to morning homeroom, and while the rest of the students filed out, Jirou approached him. \n\n\n\u201cYou got a sec to talk?\u201d she asked. \n\n\n\u201cOh, s-sure, Jirou,\u201d Izuku answered with a nod, shouldering his backpack and turning to face her fully. Everyone else filed out moments later, leaving the two of them behind. Silence engulfed the classroom, and after a little while, Izuku breaks it and asks, \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d \n\n\nJiro paused momentarily, biting her lip. \u201cListen, Midoriya, I\u2026\u201d She stopped, took in a deep breath. \u201c...On the mountain,\u201d she went on slowly, \u201cy\u2019know, \n\nthat day, \n\nyou...you saved me. You literally\u2026\u201d She took another breath. \u201cYou literally \n\ndied \n\nfor me.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly and raised a hand to rub the back of his neck. He should have expected this, but even so. \u201cI-I guess,\u201d he said nervously, picking his words with care. \u201cBut I came back, s-so\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Jirou interrupted sharply. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know you were coming back. You were fully prepared to...to \n\ndie \n\nfor me, and...and I know you would\u2019ve done it for anyone, for \n\nany \n\nof us, because...because that\u2019s just the kind of person you are. And...And I wanted to thank you. You died for me, Midoriya, and...I don\u2019t think I could ever thank you enough.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku wanted to tell her not to thank him, that he\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat, that it was alright and everything turned out okay in the end\u2026\n\n\nBut then, Jirou\u2019s image flickered, and he was in the other reality. She was still standing before him, but instead of looking reserved and a bit embarrassed, she looked \n\nbroken. \n\n\n\nIt ended in a flash, but it left a lasting impression on him. He nodded shortly, forcing back tears. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said at length. \u201cI\u2019m glad everything turned out okay in the end.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cJust\u2014\u201d Jirou reached out as though to grab him, but stopped short and withdrew her hand. Her fingers curled into a fist. \u201cJust, don\u2019t do it again. Don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t go dying on us for real.\u201d \n\n\nAll he could do was nod. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said, and he meant it. After seeing the other reality, after \n\nstill seeing \n\nwhat the world was like without him, he really, truly meant it. \u201cI won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d \n\n\nJirou didn\u2019t seem convinced, and he couldn\u2019t blame her. They left the classroom to rejoin the rest of 1-A. \n\nThe second Izuku arrived back at the dormitory after that school day, he tossed his backpack onto his desk and flopped facedown on his bed without bothering with the lights. He didn\u2019t know why, but today had been particularly draining and left him with the growing need to sleep.\n\nBakugou would probably be making dinner soon. Everyone would be downstairs goofing off or exchanging study notes. Meanwhile, he\u2019d be up here, fast asleep. As much as he wanted to be down there with them, the majority of him just wanted to shut his eyes and not open them until he was well rested. \n\n\nSo that was what he did. He closed his eyes, took in a deep breath, and fell asleep without much difficulty at all. \n\n\n\nStaying \n\nasleep, however, was a different story. \n\n\nHe\u2019d seen plenty glimpses of the other reality in flashes during the day, and that was already too much. Parts of him had considered telling All Might, or Recovery Girl, or Aizawa, or \n\nsomeone, \n\nbut in the end he\u2019d stayed quiet. It wasn\u2019t something he couldn\u2019t suffer through in silence. \n\n\nExcept, now, he was seeing glimpses of the reality again. But this time, in his dreams. \n\n\nHe saw his classmates in the common room as though he were standing and watching from the hallway. The air was solemn, despite that months had passed since the accident, and they all looked like they wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t find the words. \n\n\nKaminari and Kirishima were trying to play cards, but there were long spaces in between their turns where they gazed out into space. Uraraka and Tsuyu were sitting on the couch with Ashido and Yaoyorozu, sipping mugs of what looked like hot cocoa, but none of them seemed happy with it. \n\n\n\u201cDinner should be ready soon,\u201d Iida said, returning from the kitchen with Bakugou, who kept his head down. \u201cEveryone, if you would come help gather plates for yourselves, we\u2019ll be serving curry soon.\u201d \n\n\nHe turned and left once more, and slowly, Izuku began to feel something crawling in his stomach. \n\n\n\u201cDoes anyone know where Todoroki is?\u201d Sero asked, sitting a bit straighter on the couch. \u201cAnd, now that I think about it, Jirou isn\u2019t here, either.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThey went to visit him,\u201d Uraraka answered quietly. \n\n\nShe didn\u2019t elaborate. She didn\u2019t need to. \n\n\nIt was weird, seeing them all like this even when so much time had passed. But, Izuku supposed, in the glimpses he\u2019d seen for the past few weeks (months now, actually), some days were better than others. Sometimes his classmates got around well. Sometimes they were alright. Other times, they were not. Other times, they struggled. In some glimpses, they were enjoying themselves and playing games; in other glimpses, they were sitting around aimlessly, doing absolutely nothing at all. \n\n\nLike they were here. Quiet, reserved, not doing much. Like the silence was a precious thing that shouldn\u2019t be disturbed. \n\n\nIzuku, in his dream, attempted to move forward, but his legs were glued in place. When he tried speaking or reaching out, he could move his arm, but no words left his mouth. Not ones his classmates could hear. \n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just like before\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you think it was over?\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku spun around. Not-Him stared across from him in the hallway. His grin wasn\u2019t as bright as it was when they first met, but the smirk he wore now\u2014subtle, simple\u2014was almost more malicious. \n\n\nIzuku bit his lip. Not-Him smiled brighter. \n\n\n\u201cYour Quirk is still a part of you, stupid,\u201d he said, eyes twinkling in the shadows. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t use it again, even if its usage has already been expended, it\u2019s still there. You still get to see it. The world without you.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku wanted to cry. He was just getting over actually \n\ndying, \n\nand now\u2014\n\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d he asked, and his voice cracked, although he\u2019d tried to be demanding. \u201cWhy do you keep doing this?\u201d \n\n\nNot-Him hung his head and shook it. \u201cListen, man, I\u2019m not causing any of this,\u201d he said, leaning against the wall idly, like they were discussing what to get for dinner. \u201cI\u2019m just the Quirk\u2019s instruction manual. I\u2019m here to explain stuff. I\u2019m not \n\ncausing \n\nany of this. You\u2019ve got your actual Quirk to blame for \n\nthat.\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku swallowed hard. \u201c...I don\u2019t want to see it anymore.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Not-Him grinned fully this time, teeth glimmering in the darkness. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make that choice, either.\u201d \n\n\nAnd then he woke up, breathing hard, fists clenching handfuls of his bedsheets. He shot upright, settling a hand against his head when it pounded. His heart raced. His breath came in quick, short gasps. \n\n\nThe sensation was familiar, somehow. Panic, fear, racing heart, being unable to breathe. He felt like he was \n\n\nDrowning. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep again that night. \n\n\nOr the next night. \n\n\nOr the night after that. \n\nKirishima sat in front of the group of students. Sans Midoriya, everyone in Class 1-A was present, sitting in a circle on the floor of the Student Lounge.\n\n\u201cSo.\u201d Kirishima clapped his hands together. \u201cThe official weekly meeting of the Midoriya Protection Squad is now in session. Discussions start now.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been sleeping,\u201d Uraraka spoke at once, without raising her hand or otherwise asking to speak. \u201cI mean, I know he\u2019s still dealing with everything, and sometimes he has a hard time with it either way, but...it\u2019s been really bad lately.\u201d \n\n\nJirou nodded her agreement. \u201cWhen I talked to him a few days ago,\u201d she said, \u201che seemed kind of out of it. It was subtle, but I still noticed it either way.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of odd, though,\u201d said Tokoyami, cradling his chin thoughtfully. He was perched in the only dark corner in the room, figure shrouded by shadow. \u201cHe\u2019s been going to bed early lately, hasn\u2019t he? Or, at least, he hasn\u2019t been participating in group activities after school.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHold on a second.\u201d Satou lifted his head, eyes widened slightly. \u201cWhen was the last time any of you actually saw him eating dinner?\u201d \n\n\nSilence. \n\n\n\u201cOh, \n\ncrap!\u201d \n\nAshido wailed, digging her hands into her hair (mindful of her horns). \u201cWhen \n\nwas \n\nthe last time he ate dinner with us!?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHe eats lunch,\u201d Todoroki spoke up before the turmoil could escalate. \u201cAnd he eats breakfast. He just goes to bed before dinner is actually prepared.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of worrisome,\u201d Iida murmured, \u201cespecially when you add in the fact that he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been \n\nsleeping\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nKaminari rocked himself back and forth for a moment, teeth sank into his bottom lip. \u201cShould we ask him? I mean, considering it\u2019s\u2014y\u2019know, \n\nhim, \n\nI doubt he\u2019d actually \n\ntell us \n\nif something was wrong, but...it\u2019s worth trying, right?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d Yaoyorozu agreed, rising to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask him directly. If it doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll start taking more of the initiative.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to rush him all at once and demand he tell us what\u2019s wrong, though,\u201d Kirishima mentioned, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cMaybe only one of us should talk to him. Someone who won\u2019t make him feel weirded out or pressured.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI can talk to him,\u201d Todoroki volunteered easily. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much he\u2019ll tell me, but I can try.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Kirishima got to his feet, and the others mirrored the movement shortly thereafter. Once they were all standing, Kirishima thrust his hand forward. The others settle their hands atop his and atop their classmates\u2019 until they form one awkward stack of nineteen. \u201cBattle plans decided. This meeting is finished!\u201d \n\n\nThey released each other\u2019s hands with a quiet whoop (quiet as to not lead the teachers on), and went about the rest of their day. \n\nIt was getting worse.\n\nSometimes, Izuku found himself sitting through \n\nentire classes \n\nin the other reality. The atmosphere was so \n\nwrong, \n\nso messed up and twisted, and the fact that he was always sitting in the same desk chair suggested that, in this other reality, it was still empty. He hadn\u2019t been replaced. Sometimes he wondered why; sometimes he felt he already knew. \n\n\nNot-Him didn\u2019t make any appearances other than in his dreams, when reality was distorted anyway. When Izuku \n\ndid \n\nsleep\u2014intentionally or accidentally, though mostly the latter\u2014Not-Him always had something to say. There was always a part of the alternate reality to see. There was always \n\nsomething there \n\nthat Izuku wished he didn\u2019t have to live through. \n\n\nHe became afraid to close his eyes. \n\n\nHe could tell people were suspicious\u2014not just his classmates, but his teachers, too. All Might in particular asked him if everything was okay, to which Izuku lied and said yes. His grades were declining. Present Mic pulled him aside one day, said that it didn\u2019t make sense since Izuku had always been good at English, and Izuku lied again and said that he was just struggling lately with the new material. Present Mic had bought it; Izuku still didn\u2019t know about All Might but he\u2019d deal with that later. For now, he thought he was doing pretty okay at pretending. \n\n\nAnd then he fell asleep in class. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t realize what\u2019d happened until Aizawa shook his shoulder and his head snapped off the desk. His classmates\u2014\n\nall \n\nof them\u2014were staring at him, worried. Concerned. Aizawa stood by his desk, but he didn\u2019t look fed up. Izuku didn\u2019t know how to describe the look on his face. \n\n\nIzuku realized it all at once. He\u2019d fallen asleep during \n\nmorning homeroom. \n\nHe\u2019d been doing an okay job of hiding his sleeplessness from his classmates, saying he was always tired by the end of the day, but now he couldn\u2019t lie about it. He\u2019d fallen asleep during morning homeroom. \n\nMorning \n\nhomeroom. At the start of the day. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku\u2019s head snapped up, and his eyes met Aizawa\u2019s. \n\n\n\u201cGo stand in the hall,\u201d Aizawa said curtly. \u201cWait for me. Todoroki, you too.\u201d \n\n\nMortified, Izuku rose to his feet. A couple desks across from him, he heard Todoroki\u2019s chair scrape the ground as he, too, did the same. Izuku didn\u2019t look at Aizawa, Todoroki, or anyone as he made his way to the front of the room and finally out the sliding door. Todoroki followed behind with Aizawa, and Aizawa pulled the door shut behind the three of them. \n\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t look at either of them. He was \n\nalmost \n\ntoo exhausted to feel embarrassed, but either way, Aizawa was the strictest of their teachers. He didn\u2019t know what to expect. \n\n\nAizawa wrote something on a notepad, tore out the page, and handed it to him. \u201cGo to Recovery Girl,\u201d Aizawa told him with a voice that left no room for argument. \u201cMake sure he gets there, Todoroki. I\u2019ll talk to the principal about giving you leave of absence for the next couple of days, Midoriya.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku finally raised his head, eyes widening. \u201cW-What? No, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t stay awake,\u201d Aizawa interrupted sharply, \u201cthen there\u2019s no reason for you to be here at all. Go to Recovery Girl, and then go back to Heights Alliance. Todoroki, come back to class once he\u2019s there.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYessir,\u201d Todoroki answered, nodding firmly. \u201cMidoriya. Don\u2019t argue. Come on.\u201d \n\n\nEven if he wanted to\u2014and he did\u2014Izuku knew it was futile. All he\u2019d do was make Aizawa irritated. He nodded, spun on his heel, and left with Todoroki. He heard Class 1-A\u2019s door open and shut behind them, and when he glanced over his shoulder, Aizawa was no longer there. \n\n\nHe turned back to face the hall without offering Todoroki so much as a single glance. Todoroki didn\u2019t, either. The silence was almost overwhelming, and not just that, but it was the most uncomfortable silence Izuku had ever suffered through. \n\n\nLuckily (or unluckily\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure), Todoroki broke it. \n\n\n\u201cMidoriya. What\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\n\n Izuku bit his lip. His fingernails dug into his palms. \u201cNothing.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re lying. We kind of all do at this point. So...please?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku let out a long, heaving sigh and hung his head. He didn\u2019t want to say it, but a part of him knew Todoroki was right. There was no way anyone was buying his \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d act anymore; he wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d ever actually bought it. He was torn between wishing he was more convincing and happy that he wasn\u2019t. \n\n\n\u201c...I...I-I just\u2014\u201d \n\n\nHe glanced at Todoroki, which turned out to be a terrible idea. \n\n\nTodoroki\u2019s image flickered, became black and white, and in this opposite reality, in this \n\nwhat-if, \n\nTodoroki\u2019s eyes were red, and tears made their way silently down his face. \n\n\nIzuku stopped short, wide-eyed.\n\n\nAnd then a wave of lightheadedness crashed over him unexpectedly. The edges of his vision went dark; his legs swayed beneath him while the floor swirled; he stumbled to the side, clutching his head and bracing his other hand against the wall. \n\n\n\u201c\u2014Midoriya\u2014!\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki caught him by the forearms and held him upright. Todoroki\u2019s eyes were wild with panic instead of filled with tears like they\u2019d been in the other reality, but Izuku didn\u2019t have much time to fully \n\nregister \n\nthis before the black closed in all the way, and he spiraled downwards.\n\n\nOn the bright side, at least Not-Him didn\u2019t haunt his unconsciousness. \n\nWhen he woke up, he felt no more rested than when he passed out, and his head was still pounding relentlessly. He blinked up at the infirmary roof slowly, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the light. He didn\u2019t trust himself to sit up, not without feeling dizzy again, so he stayed put.\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d \n\n\nHe turned his head slowly. Todoroki was perched on a stool by the bedside, elbows resting on his thighs and fingers threaded together loosely, with his chin resting on them. Izuku blinked at him, long and slow. \n\n\n\u201c...What happened\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cRecovery Girl said you blacked out,\u201d Todoroki answered shortly. \u201cFrom sleep deprivation. And nutrient deprivation, too.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku blinked at him again, and the pieces began falling into place. \u201cS-So...I...I actually passed out...?\u201d\n\n\nTodoroki\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. \u201cMidoriya, how long has this been going on? When was the last time you actually slept?\u201d\n\n\nIzuku couldn\u2019t answer. And maybe it was the fact that he couldn\u2019t answer that was the most terrifying thing of it all. Todoroki leaned back when the silence stretched, lowering his hands and looking down at them. \n\n\n\u201c...Could you...maybe tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201d Todoroki asked, voice quiet. Almost hesitant. \u201cI mean, if it\u2019s something private or personal, we don\u2019t expect you to, but we\u2019ve been worried about you for a long time now. We really want to know what\u2019s the matter. We can\u2019t help you otherwise.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed hard, eyes burning with tears. He wanted to tell them, he really did. He wanted to tell them of Second Chance\u2019s side effects, he wanted to tell them the truth about it all, but it\u2019d...it\u2019d been \n\nhard. \n\nActually telling them that he\u2019d died had been hard enough, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about what was going on \n\nnow, \n\nafter the fact, now that they\u2019ve been moving on and healing and all that. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to drag them all back down into it when they\u2019d just begun to resurface. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku turned and met Todoroki\u2019s eyes. Todoroki\u2019s gaze held a combination of desperation, concern, and sorrow. \n\n\n\u201cPlease, tell us. We just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed again, but the lump in his throat remained. He didn\u2019t want to \n\nthink \n\nabout it, much less talk about it, but\u2026\n\n\n\u201c...Okay, I\u2019ll tell you all,\u201d Izuku said at length, swallowing again. \u201cB-But I only want to say it once. With everyone.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Todoroki nodded, then reached out, hesitated, and squeezed Izuku\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku pondered this before nodding shakily. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be just fine. Eventually.\u201d \n\n\nRecovery Girl gave him medications to help him sleep and sent him off with strict orders to a) eat better and b) rest whenever he was able. She didn\u2019t seem \n\ntoo \n\nupset with him; it was more of a \u201cI\u2019m frustrated because I\u2019m worried\u201d kind of thing, which was nice. He didn\u2019t want to deal with her righteous fury atop of everything else.\n\n\nEither way, by the time she was through making him rest and brought him a hearty meal from the cafeteria, it was late in the day and school was through. She sent him back to the dormitory with his bottle of medications just as the sun began to set and everyone returned to Heights Alliance. \n\n\nWhen Izuku walked through the front door, the first thing he saw was his classmates as they would be from the alternate-reality; moping around, silent, not like themselves at all. \n\n\nWhen the moment ended, Izuku was being approached by Iida, who looked concerned. The rest of his classmates were sitting on the couches, perched on chairs, and in some cases, on the floor; but the point was, everyone was there. Todoroki, too. \n\n\nIida stopped in front of him, glanced at the group over his shoulder, then turned back. \u201cTodoroki more or less filled us in,\u201d he said quietly, just loud enough for Izuku to hear. \u201cHe said you wanted to talk to us all. If you aren\u2019t ready to do it now, then we\u2019ll do it some other time. Just say the word.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku swallowed. There was no real reason to postpone this; either way, he\u2019d have to deal with it eventually. Better sooner than later. \n\n\n\u201c...We can talk now,\u201d Izuku agreed, nodding and wiping his eyes with the backs of his hands. \u201cY-Yeah, let\u2019s...let\u2019s talk now.\u201d \n\n\nIida nodded. \u201cAlright. But \n\nfirst, \n\nBakugou and I prepared soup for everyone. We\u2019ll grab bowls and then sit down. Alright?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t know how much Todoroki told them, but he assumed it was enough to make them worry, which probably led to Iida\u2019s making sure Izuku actually ate dinner. \n\n\nIzuku nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d \n\nShortly thereafter found the entire group seated once again, this time each with their own bowl of steaming chicken noodle soup. Izuku was sure it was fantastic, considering Iida and Bakugou prepared it, but still. He couldn\u2019t actually taste it very well.\n\nHe himself was sitting on the couch in between Uraraka and Iida; Todoroki sat on Iida\u2019s left, and Tokoyami perched on the arm of the couch precariously. Sero did the same on the opposite side of the couch, and Tsuyu was squeezed in between him and Uraraka. The rest of them took the opposite couch as well as the floor and a couple chairs they\u2019d dragged over. \n\n\nNo one said anything, which Izuku took as them waiting for him to start first. He took in a breath, let it out, and settled his soup bowl on the coffee table for later. Maybe he\u2019d be able to enjoy it once he got all this off his chest. \n\n\n\u201cOkay, so, I\u2026\u201d Izuku bit his lip, wringing his hands together. It came to his attention a second later that everyone else had ceased eating, too. \u201cF-First of all, this has to do with \n\nthat day. \n\nOn the mountain.\u201d \n\n\nThe group nodded collectively. \n\n\n\u201cWe kind of already guessed that,\u201d Tsuyu admitted, \u201cbut go on. We\u2019re listening.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2026\u201d He really didn\u2019t know how to phrase this in a way that \n\nwouldn\u2019t \n\ncompletely freak them out. \u201c...I already told you that I died and my Quirk brought me back, right? \u2018Second Chance.\u2019\u201d \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t miss the emotions that flashed on their faces; guilt, pain, hurt, and everything in between. The answer was unspoken and unanimous, so Izuku went on; \n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s...there\u2019s a part of it that I didn\u2019t actually mention. Another weird mechanic that I just didn\u2019t feel like talking about. And, basically...my Quirk kind of created this...this\u2026\u201d He had no idea how to describe it. \u201cThis weird alternate reality where I \n\ndid \n\ndie. And while I was unconscious\u2014in the few minutes on the mountain top\u2014I got to see that alternate reality. I got to live in a world where you were in mourning and I was\u2014\n\ngone.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe heard a few sharp inhales. A couple gasps. Uraraka reached out with a small, hesitant \u201cDeku\u2026\u201d but he shook his head and cut her off. \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014t-that\u2019s not all. I wish it was but it\u2019s not.\u201d \n\n\nThey were silent, so he went ahead and continued. \n\n\n\u201cSometimes, I still see it. The other reality. It\u2019s been happening more and more lately, and I can\u2019t control when it starts or stops, it just\u2014\n\nhappens. \n\nAnd then it ends. But\u2014I have to see all of you...upset. I have to watch you guys mourn and I have to watch you guys \n\ngo through it \n\nwhile I\u2019m powerless to help. And it\u2019s been worse in my dreams. It\u2019s been happening a lot, s-so I just\u2014I thought maybe\u2014maybe if I \n\ndidn\u2019t \n\nsleep, I could avoid the worst of it. But that doesn\u2019t really work, either.\u201d \n\n\nIida\u2019s hand found his shoulder and squeezed, but he didn\u2019t say anything. No one did. Izuku took in a shaky breath, then let it out in like manner. \n\n\n\u201cS-So, that\u2019s it,\u201d he finished. There was a bitter, unpleasant taste in his mouth that he couldn\u2019t get rid of no matter what he tried. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been sleeping.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDang\u2026\u201d \n\nKirishima\u2019s eyes were wide, and he stared off into space. \u201cYou had to watch us\u2014you \n\nhave \n\nto watch us mourn, that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s \n\nmessed up, \n\ndude.\u201d \n\n\nThe more he thought about it, the more he realized that it really was. \n\n\n\u201cYou should have said something sooner,\u201d Yaoyorozu said, but her voice was small, and she didn\u2019t sound angry. If anything, she sounded sad. \u201cYou should have told us. We would have been glad to help you through it. We would have been able to help sooner.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku took in another shuddering breath and let it go. \u201cI-I know. I wasn\u2019t...I wasn\u2019t thinking about it. I wasn\u2019t thinking about how you guys would feel. I just\u2014I thought I could deal with it, but\u2014I-I was wrong.\u201d \n\n\nUraraka reached out, hesitated, then rested her hand over his in reassurance. \u201cBut we know now,\u201d she said. \n\n\nHer words seemed to break the trance, and suddenly everyone was in slightly higher spirits. \n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right!\u201d Satou agreed, the first to leap to his feet. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help before, but we\u2019re here to help now, Midoriya! Anything you need, just say the word and we\u2019ll do our best!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDark Shadow and I are mostly nocturnal,\u201d Tokoyami told him while Ashido and Hagakure joined in with Satou\u2019s whoops and cheers, \u201cso if you needed someone to stay up with you ever and keep you company, you can hit us up any time.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThe same goes for me as well,\u201d Iida agreed, nodding and straightening his glasses with the hand not on Izuku\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know it\u2019s important to get a full night\u2019s sleep, but it\u2019s better to not be alone should something like that happen.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help with night shift!\u201d Kaminari volunteered, too, and suddenly everyone was catching on and doing the same. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really good at hand puppets!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe could find some relaxing music to listen to, I have some good playlists.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe could even take turns if we had to!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHeck yeah!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cJust text us whenever you need us, Midori-chan! We\u2019re here for you!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAmen to \n\nthat!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHere, here!\u201d \n\n\nIzuku watched them cheer and scheme, and for once, he didn\u2019t see the alternate reality. All he saw were his friends, smiling, cheering, encouraging him and offering to be there for him, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile, even as the tears finally broke free. \n\n\nUraraka hugged him tight as soon as she noticed, and Izuku tensed at first, not expecting it, but then he returned the embrace with equal ferocity. Another pair of arms wrapped around him and her as Iida joined in, and Izuku sighed and shut his eyes, content. \n\n\nExcept\u2014\n\n\n\u201cHey! I wanna hug him, too!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo fair! Scoot over!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cScrew it, I\u2019m glomping him!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cW-Wait, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best idea\u2014!\u201d \n\n\nHe was too late to try objecting, and soon he, Iida, and Uraraka were pummeled by the rest of their classmates. It wasn\u2019t until they were nothing more than a heap of tangled limbs and constricted airways that they realized how terrible a plan this was, but Izuku couldn\u2019t help but laugh, even if it was hoarse. \n\n\nThey knew everything now, and even though it\u2019d been hard, he was glad for it. \n\nHe took the prescribed dosage of sleeping aids before bed that night. His friends had offered to stay with him, like they\u2019d promised, but he\u2019d assured them that he\u2019d be okay for tonight and he wanted to see how well the sleeping aids actually worked.\n\nSo, he bade them farewell, thanked them for everything, then went to bed. \n\n\nHe fell asleep easily enough, but again, staying asleep became a problem. He didn\u2019t see a \n\nlot \n\nbefore he woke up again, but the glimpses of the alternate reality had been enough to shake him and leave him wide awake. \n\n\nSo, that was a no for the sleeping aids. He\u2019d had high hopes for them, too. \n\n\nHe didn\u2019t feel like getting up, though, so he tossed and turned relentlessly for hours on end, trying (and failing) to find some comfortable position. He wanted to sleep again\u2014he really \n\nwas \n\nexhausted\u2014but his chest felt tight, and whenever he closed his eyes, he was overwhelmed by this sense of dread and hopelessness. \n\n\nHe sighed. \n\n\n\nI guess dying is finally starting to take its toll on me\u2026\n\n\n\nHe sat up, and after a moment or two of mentally wrestling with himself, he reached over to his bedside table and felt around for his phone. Finally, his fingers closed around it, and he pulled it to himself and turned it on. \n\n\nThe phone light was blinding, and he turned away until his eyes adjusted (which didn\u2019t take very long at all). After a moment, he pulled up his contact list and scrolled through them. He scrolled through them, found who he was looking for and\u2014\n\n\nStopped. His fingers paused over the screen. He stared at the contact name for a long while. \n\n\nHe wanted to, but at the same time, he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t burden them, even if they said they didn\u2019t mind. He couldn\u2019t throw all of this on them, not when he\u2019d already thrust so much onto them. \n\n\nBut his friends had told him to let them know if he needed anything. He knew they were worried; even though he was alive and breathing now, he knew they were scared, that they were still shaken up by everything, and he knew they would rather he come to them for help. They didn\u2019t care the time of day or the time of night. They\u2019d said they wanted to be there for him, and he believed them. \n\n\nSo, at long last, he tapped the contact and held the phone to his ear, waiting. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s really late, though\u2026\n\n\n\n\n...I hope I\u2019m not waking him up\u2026\n\n\n\nThe phone barely got through one full ring before it was answered. \n\n\n\n\u201cHello? Midoriya?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Iida,\u201d Izuku said uneasily, and then, a second later, \u201cI-I didn\u2019t wake you up, did I\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d \n\ncame Iida\u2019s response. \n\n\u201cI was studying, actually. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Izuku traced the bedsheet absentmindedly with a finger. \u201cThe...the sleep aids are a no-go.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, right. Hmm...do you want to talk about anything? Is there something in particular that\u2019s bothering you, or is it just...in general?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cP-Probably just, in general. With everything,\u201d Izuku answered thickly. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. Everything just feels...like it\u2019s been turned on its head, I guess. Ever since \n\nthat day...\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201c...This is probably a stupid question, but...are you alright?\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku swallowed hard. This time, he didn\u2019t lie. \u201c...I\u2019m not. I\u2019m really, really not.\u201d \n\n\nIida was silent for a long, seemingly endless while. \n\n\nAnd then, \n\n\n\n\u201cMeet me downstairs, alright? I\u2019ll sit up with you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cY-You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya. We\u2019ve been over this. Just take it, alright?\u201d \n\n\n\nIzuku stopped short, and in his heart, he knew Iida was right. Iida wasn\u2019t the kind of person to lie; if he said he didn\u2019t mind staying up with him, then it meant he didn\u2019t mind. Izuku didn\u2019t have to worry about the sincerity of his words. Iida meant them. \n\n\nSo instead of arguing again, Izuku nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll meet you down there.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, good. Bring a blanket, it\u2019s supposed to be cold tonight and the common room doesn\u2019t warm up quickly.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cG-Got it. See you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSee you.\u201d \n\n\n\nIida terminated the call, and Izuku swung himself off the bed, wrapped his blanket around his shoulders, and took the elevator downstairs. \n\n\nIida was there when he arrived, though it looked like they\u2019d nearly gotten there at the same time. Iida was carrying his blanket rather than settling it around his shoulders, and the glow of the hall light exposed his concerned expression. \n\n\nIzuku swallowed thickly. \u201cIida, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\nThe elevator dinged unexpectedly, and Izuku and Iida both jumped and looked towards it. The doors slid open, and out stepped Todoroki, Kaminari, Kirishima, Ashido and Hagakure, all carrying their own blankets and pillows. \n\n\n\u201cW-What?\u201d Izuku managed, eyes widening as they stepped out of the elevator and the doors shut behind them. \u201cWhat are you guys doing here\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNone of us could sleep,\u201d Kirishima answered shortly, already spreading his blanket out on the floor, \u201cand we heard you and Iida leave, so we thought we\u2019d see what was going on.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBesides, we promised we\u2019d look out for you!\u201d Hagakure interjected before Izuku could object. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just sit there and wonder what was wrong, we had to find out!\u201d \n\n\nIida sighed heavily, but to Izuku\u2019s surprise, he didn\u2019t reprimand them. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, straightening his glasses, \u201cbut please\u2014\u201d \n\n\nThe arrow on the elevator lit up, and everyone turned to look. \n\n\n\u201c...It\u2019s going up again,\u201d Todoroki stated, like it wasn\u2019t already obvious. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the elevator to return, and when it did, it brought with it Yaoyorozu, Sero, Satou, Jirou, Kouda, and Mineta. It was a tight squeeze with all of them, but they made it work, somehow. \n\n\n\u201cY-You guys, too?\u201d Izuku asked, something in his chest aching. \u201cY-You didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d \n\n\nFootsteps drew his attention to the staircase, and down came Aoyama, Tokoyami, Uraraka, Tsuyu, Shouji, Ojirou, and at the back of the pack, Bakugou. They all had blankets and pillows. \n\n\nIzuku stared, hardly believing it. \n\n\u201cEveryone?\u201d \n\n\n\nTokoyami sighed and shook his head. \u201cWhat can we say, Midoriya? We\u2019ve been worried.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Uraraka said, holding up her phone, \u201cTodoroki said you were awake and that you might need some support.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku whirled around to face him. Todoroki pretended not to notice. \n\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be alone if you\u2019re going through things like this,\u201d Yaoyorozu said, and he turned to her instead, listening. \u201cI know you don\u2019t always accept our help, but we \n\nare \n\nhere for you, and we care about you deeply.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHeck \n\nyeah \n\nwe do!\u201d agreed Kaminari immediately, nodding. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we wouldn\u2019t do for you, man. And like Yaoyorozu said, we know you probably feel awkward about it, or maybe you think you\u2019re burdening us, but it\u2019s really fine. It\u2019s easier for twenty people to carry something than one, right?\u201d \n\n\nIzuku couldn\u2019t find his voice for the longest moment. And then, when he did, he smiled. \n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, looking down at his feet. \u201cI\u2014I know I\u2019m bad at\u2014accepting help, but...I appreciate it a lot. Thank you.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it!\u201d Sero said, flashing him a thumbs-up. \u201cNow if we\u2019re ready\u2014!\u201d He tossed two blankets to the floor and shook out the third one. \u201cWe should build some kind of a blanket fort! The biggest one we\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d Yaoyorozu exclaimed, spinning towards him. \u201cI can build a couple beams. I don\u2019t think Aizawa-sensei would mind.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get some lights!\u201d Kaminari offered, already running for the elevator. \u201cI\u2019ve got some white Christmas lights from last year, gimme one second!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDo you wanna help me make hot cocoa, Uraraka?\u201d Satou asked, to which Uraraka nodded immediately and left with him, Hagakure, and Ashido into the kitchen. \n\n\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Izuku asked, starting towards them. \u201cI could\u2014\u201d \n\n\nIida caught him on the shoulder and held him back. \u201cNo. \n\nYou\u2019re \n\ngoing to sit down before you collapse again.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku turned to him, feeling kind of betrayed. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThis is part of the \u2018letting us help you,\u2019 Midoriya,\u201d Tokoyami said simply (behind him, the elevator door swung open and out ran Kaminari, holding the box of lights over his head like a trophy). \u201cSit down, we\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d \n\n\nA part of Izuku wanted to object, to say that he was fine and that they didn\u2019t need to worry. \n\n\nBut he didn\u2019t. The longer he thought about it, the less he wanted to say any of that. \n\n\nSo he nodded and sat down on the couch without protest, and his friends built the massive blanket fort around him. \n\n\nAt some point, someone threw a blanket over his head; he responded by blindly swinging a pillow at them. It turned out to be Kirishima, who laughed it off and helped Yaoyorozu secure the corner of the blankets to a metal beam she\u2019d constructed. Ashido crept up behind Bakugou and dropped a marshmallow down the back of his shirt, only to retreat, howling and cackling, with Bakugou fuming behind her. \n\n\nKaminari got himself tangled in the lights and had to be rescued by Tsuyu and Uraraka (although, when Mineta did the same thing, no one came to his rescue). Hagakure and Satou helped dish out the hot cocoa, and once the fort was completed and the lights were on, everyone gathered inside. \n\n\nThey played cards, a few rounds of Truth or Dare, even Charades when they were bored enough. Ashido snuck the bag of marshmallows by Iida and kept sneaking around, replenishing people\u2019s supply even when they were out of hot cocoa. When Iida finally caught her, she flung three at him and made a break for it. It was a combination of chaotic and peaceful both at once. \n\n\nAnd it was so simple. It was so painstakingly \n\nsimple \n\nthat Izuku didn\u2019t know why he hadn\u2019t realized it before now. He\u2019d realized it once before, how much his friends cared about him and loved him\u2014he\u2019d realized it thanks to Second Chance and thanks to the reality without him. \n\n\nBut now it was in the little things that he realized it all the more. It was one thing to miss him when he \n\ndied, \n\nbut it was another thing to throw a blanket over him, or toss a couple marshmallows into his cup, or ruffle his hair, or hug him just because he was struggling. \n\n\nThat was something else. That was something closer. That was something that elicited feelings in him that were different from the ones he\u2019d felt before, while witnessing the world without him. \n\n\nThe fact that they were still here with him, still supporting him, still doing whatever they could, was what really hit him hardest. \n\n\n\u201cHere, try this,\u201d Todoroki murmured, pressing a clump of ice into Ashido\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get this from me.\u201d \n\n\nAshido \n\ngrinned, \n\nclosed her fingers around the ice, then crept up behind Bakugou silently. Izuku watched for a bit; and then, Todoroki tapped him on the shoulder. \n\n\n\u201cYou doing alright?\u201d Todoroki asked, withdrawing his hand. \u201cYou...have a kind of weird look on your face.\u201d \n\n\nIzuku exhaled sharply through his nose and shook his head. \u201cI \n\nfeel \n\nkind of weird,\u201d he admitted, drawing the blanket further around his shoulders. \u201cLike...I just feel kind of...light? If that makes sense? I don\u2019t know it\u2019s...it\u2019s weird.\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki studied him for a little while longer. \u201cIs it...a good kind of weird?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHEY WHAT THE HELL, I\u2019LL KILL YOU!\u201d \n\n\nAshido dashed from the blanket fort, pursued by an angry, cursing Bakugou, and Izuku smiled faintly. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great kind of weird.\u201d \n\n\nTodoroki blinked, but then he smiled too. \n\nIt was one of the strangest scenarios Aizawa had ever walked in on.\n\nNone of the students had been there for morning homeroom. Not even Iida or Yaoyorozu, who wouldn\u2019t miss class even if they were physically unable to get out of bed. The fact that no one was there was concerning; which led to Aizawa making his way to Heights Alliance to find out exactly what the problem was. \n\n\nHe was met with a blanket fort and twenty snoring students dog-piling each other within. \n\n\nAizawa \n\nsighed, \n\nnot because he was annoyed, but because there was absolutely no way he could be upset with them. He resigned himself to it. They were no doubt here for Midoriya. They\u2019d probably stayed up all night with him just to make sure he was okay. \n\n\nAizawa didn\u2019t wake them. He left the dormitory silently, and when he returned to the school, explained the situation to Nedzu, who, likeminded, gave the students the day off. \n\n\nIt couldn\u2019t \n\nkeep \n\nhappening\u2014they couldn\u2019t \n\nalways \n\ngive the students a school excuse\u2014but today, for now, they\u2019d make an exception. \n"
