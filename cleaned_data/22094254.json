    "text": "\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan out of the blue one night. He has been playing guqin on the other side of the room without speaking for two hours, and Wei Wuxian has been noodling with some new ideas for talismans for nearly as long--one of those easy, quiet evenings of companionable silence, until Lan Zhan has thrown this enormous tantrum out of nowhere.\nWei Wuxian looks up in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLan Zhan is frowning, gazing down at the strings of his guqin. \u201cA-Yuan is seventeen.\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t want to think about it. A-Yuan is, in fact, nearly eighteen. He does not mention this, just waves a hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll just cut off his legs and then he\u2019ll be little forever. Don\u2019t worry about it.\"\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan.\nThis is a problem which Wei Wuxian cannot solve, either for himself or for Lan Zhan, so he returns to his talisman, commenting only, \u201cHe\u2019s a nice Lan boy, I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t getting up to any more unseemly mischief on night hunts than you were at his age, despite my best efforts at the time.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have a crush on anybody, so far as I can tell.\u201d Wei Wuxian shakes the end of his brush like a scolding finger. \u201cYou work the children too hard. No free time for looking at other people their age. A-Yuan will grow up stunted and repressed if he doesn\u2019t have a couple good heartbreaks when he\u2019s young.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan, plucking out a begrudging tune on the guqin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to be grown-up and married next week.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nNext week, Jin Ling shows up on the doorstep of Cloud Recesses in full panoply, with an entourage that includes Jiang Cheng at his shoulder, and says, \u201cIt\u2019s about Lan Sizhui,\u201d and it\u2019s all Wei Wuxian can do not to crow with laughter. Jin Ling is a child. An infant. He has a pimple on his chin. He is going through a particularly gawky growth spurt and he looks like someone dressed an awkward baby horse in fantastically extravagant Jin robes. How in the world he convinced Jiang Cheng to come along on this mission is honestly beyond Wei Wuxian, but he needs no further explanation.\n\u201cIs this what I think it is?\u201d he can\u2019t help saying, and he feels Lan Zhan beside him go stiff and outraged.\u00a0\nWhen he storms off, Wei Wuxian lingers only long enough to smooth things over with Jin Ling and Jiang Cheng, and then to throw in a single parting tease so things aren\u2019t too smooth, and then he runs after his husband.\nWei Wuxian is breathless with laughter when he catches up. \u201cOkay, I know what I said last week--\u201d\n\u201cThat boy,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\n\u201cI know. He\u2019s like twelve.\u201d\n\u201cSixteen.\u201d\n\u201cBasically the same as twelve. Who thinks of getting married at twelve? Who convinces their Uncle Jiang to come all the way from Lotus Pier for that? You know this wasn\u2019t his idea. Jin Ling looked far too proud of himself.\u201d\nLan Zhan stops striding forward and turns to face Wei Wuxian so sharply that Wei Wuxian almost runs into him. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\u201cWait for A-Yuan, for one,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you seem mad, so we should go back to the Jingshi and you should take it out on me, please.\u201d\nLan Zhan pauses for only a heartbeat, then seizes him by the wrist in a bruising grip and and hauls him along.\nThe ferocity of the sex is matched only by the ferocity of the snuggling afterward, Lan Zhan wrapped around him with all his limbs like an octopus, as if he could take Wei Wuxian into his chest and hold him there.\n\u201cGood boy, good boy,\u201d Wei Wuxian croons to him, petting his arm with two fingers because that\u2019s the only part of his body he is currently being allowed to move. Lan Zhan is still holding his hands and wrists, pinning him to immobility. \u201cLess angry now?\u201d\n\u201cNot angry,\u201d Lan Zhan mumbles against the back of his neck.\n\u201cSeem a bit angry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says philosophically.\nAfter a long moment, Lan Zhan says quietly, \u201cNo.\u201d\nWei Wuxian tugs his arm to indicate he is not being held snugly enough, and Lan Zhan obligingly tightens all his limbs until it\u2019s more like being held by a python than an octopus. \u201cWhat, then? A filthy rich sect leader not good enough for our little A-Yuan?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he isn\u2019t,\u201d Lan Zhan says with a prim sniff.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my nephew you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He\u2019s getting drowsy, all warm and loose in the joints and well-loved like this. \u201cHe\u2019s a twit, but he\u2019s the only twit I\u2019ve got.\u201d He pokes Lan Zhan\u2019s arm. \u201cWhy not-angry?\u201d\n\u00a0Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t answer, only holds him even tighter, and Wei Wuxian feels suddenly very awake.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, trying and failing to squirm around to face him. \u201cA-Zhan. What\u2019s the matter? Sad? Scared?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Why, why?\u201d\n\u201cJiangs,\u201d Lan Zhan says darkly. And then, with some effort: \u201cTaking someone from me. Again.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s heart breaks in his chest and he uses all his strength to break out of Lan Zhan\u2019s grip, purely so he can turn and engulf him in hugs. \u201cI will throw them out myself,\u201d he says, rubbing his face against Lan Zhan\u2019s hair. \u201cI will go now. I will chase them away. I will get the bunnies to nibble their feet off. Nephews don\u2019t need feet, not really. Brothers definitely don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt is foolish.\u201d\n\u201cWho, me? Foolish? I\u2019ve never been foolish a day in my life. You take that back.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Me,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\nWei Wuxian pushes himself up on his elbows to look at him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI am. It is foolish to feel--this--about something that is so different than\u2026 before.\u201d\nWei Wuxian puts his ear to Lan Zhan\u2019s chest to listen to his heartbeat as he sometimes does when Lan Zhan is having trouble with his feelings like this. He cannot divine anything from it--what does a sad heartbeat sound like, and how is it different from an angry one, or a scared one?\u00a0\n\"Also angry, though,\" Lan Zhan says, a minute later. The vibration of his voice through his chest rumbles against Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek. \"Jiangs.\"\n\"What's wrong with Jiangs?\"\n\"Wei Ying,\" he says, with a note of incredulity. \"They hurt you.\"\n\"What, when? Jiang Cheng on the cliff? That was sixteen years ago, let's forget about it.\"\n\"Never.\"\nWei Wuxian sighs. Marriage, he supposes, is about compromise.\n\"Jin Rulan too,\" Lan Zhan adds. \"He stabbed you.\"\nWei Wuxian scoffs. \"Little kitten stab. I've gotten worse just stubbing my toe. He's a baby.\"\n\"He should apologize.\"\n\"I don't need infants to apologize to me.\"\n\"I do,\" Lan Zhan mutters. \"To me.\"\nWei Wuxian kisses him right over his heart. \"Do you think A-Yuan likes him? I really can\u2019t tell.\" The problem is that that kid likes everybody, opens his whole heart to the world. He\u2019d let a kindly stranger he\u2019d known for five minutes call him A-Yuan. That is, as far as Wei Wuxian can tell, roughly how long it took Wen Ning to get the privilege.\u00a0\n\"Does not matter. I will not allow it.\"\n\"What, really?\" Wei Wuxian lifts his head again. \"What if he wants to?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan has set his jaw in a stubborn way that makes Wei Wuxian's heart melt. \"It is forbidden to marry Jiangs in the Cloud Recesses,\" he says, which is an attempt so good that Wei Wuxian laughs until he's blue in the face.\u00a0\n\"Aren't I as much of a Jiang as Jin Ling is?\" he says, wiping tears from his eyes. \"I'm sure your uncle would be delighted to institute such a law immediately. Make it retroactive, why not!\"\nLan Zhan bites him on the arm in retribution. \"I need no rule,\" he says. \"That boy can marry A-Yuan over my dead body.\"\n\"So forceful, Hanguang-jun!\" Wei Wuxian says. \"What if A-Yuan wants to elope with him?\"\n\"A-Yuan is a good boy,\" Lan Zhan says, but he sounds a little uncertain. Then, decisively: \"I will lock him up here in the Jingshi.\"\n\"You never lock me up in the Jingshi,\" Wei Wuxian says, pouting.\n\"I will lock you up together.\"\n\"It's going to make our everyday a bit inconvenient,\" Wei Wuxian says thoughtfully. \"We\u2019ll have to make do with silent quickies while he's in the bath.\"\nLan Zhan frowns for a long moment. \"I will think of something.\"\n\"You could just let him get married if he decides he wants to.\u201d\n\"He is welcome to marry anyone he wants, except that boy.\"\nWei Wuxian hums and flops his whole weight on top of Lan Zhan like a human blanket, lets himself be squeezed tight while Lan Zhan frets himself to sleep.\n\u00a0\n*\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian has witnessed many embarrassing disasters in his life, but this one is certainly amongst the top ten.\nWhile he\u2019s still laughing helplessly over the mental image of his brother giving their nephew advice about wooing people (which apparently consisted entirely of \u201ccombs good\u201d), said nephew makes a valiant effort at an honorable retreat from the field, and said brother throws his hands in the air and storms off in the opposite direction. Lan Zhan and A-Yuan drag each other into the library, the nearest ostensibly-private space, to debrief.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian follows them--A-Yuan is startled and confused, and Lan Zhan is stormy and territorial, and as cute as the lock-you-both-up-in-the-Jingshi scheme had been, Wei Wuxian thinks it would be less fun in practice: A-Yuan needs to be allowed to run free with the bunnies, and Wei Wuxian only really wants to be locked up in the Jingshi if it is for a sex thing.\n\"What just happened?\" A-Yuan says desperately. \"Why did he--oh gods, I didn't even know he--oh, why did he say it in front of everyone--\"\nLan Zhan, seeing that A-Yuan is apparently in no danger of running off with that boy, relaxes a thousand degrees, by Wei Wuxian's estimation, which means he's only about three thousand degrees away from comfortable. \"You need not ever see him again,\" Lan Zhan says. \"We will tell him to leave.\"\n\"He's my friend!\" A-Yuan wails. \"Is he in love with me? I didn't even know!\"\n\"Hm,\" says Wei Wuxian. They'd been so fixed on thinking of A-Yuan that he hadn't thought of where Jin Ling might be coming from. \"Do you think he might be? Not counting his mother, he comes from a long and noble line of morons. Could you have missed any other signs besides the comb?\"\nLan Zhan's stress levels ratchet back up before Wei Wuxian's very eyes.\n\u201cCombs,\u201d says A-Yuan miserably. \u201cTwo. The first one was--too much. I told him it was too much, he agreed it was too much--he was going to take it back and throw it away. And then he gave me--that silver one? I wore it last week, do you remember?\u201d\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cWhat was the one that was too much made of?\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d says A-Yuan. \u201cGold?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan makes a murder noise in his throat.\n\u201cHe said it was because he respected me as a cultivator! I thought he was being friendly.\" His voice cracks on tears. \"I suppose we aren't friends anymore after this, are we.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, who is beginning to find all this drama and despair contagious. It\u2019s giving him hives, watching all this elegant Lan despondency. They do not need him for this. What they need is for him to be the sensible one right now. Come to that, Jin Ling is hiding somewhere and probably in desperate need of a sensible one of his own. A-Yuan and Lan Zhan have each other; Jin Ling has\u2026 no one, and Wei Wuxian cannot let that happen.\u00a0\nSo he says, \u201cHow about both of you stay here and read some nice calming books, and I\u2019ll go see if I can figure out what on earth Jin Ling thought he was doing.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nSome nonsense, as it turns out.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian comes back into the library an hour or so later, feeling thoughtful and not wholly sure of what he\u2019s just heard and seen.\u00a0\n\u201cWell?\u201d Lan Zhan says immediately. He is sitting exactly where Wei Wuxian left him--on a cushion, back straight, hands on his knees. A-Yuan is still pacing.\u00a0\n\u201cNot to worry, everyone,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cNo harm done, no hearts broken.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not offended?\u201d A-Yuan asks. He\u2019s bitten his thumbnail to shreds, and his forehead is all knotted up with worry.\n\u201cNot at all. He\u2019s embarrassed, of course, but he\u2019s handling it quite well.\u201d\n\u201cNo hearts broken, you say. Why not?\u201d Lan Zhan asks suddenly.\n\u201cUm,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, who hadn\u2019t really planned on telling them details like that. \u201cSeems he got it into his little fool head that A-Yuan would be a good political match for him, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nLan Zhan\u2019s stress ratchets up another thousand degrees. Wei Wuxian mentally sighs to himself.\n\u201cI\u2026 Oh,\u201d says A-Yuan, confused and quiet. \u201cShould we--I mean, I can see where he\u2019s coming from--\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says sharply, because he likes his husband not being dead of an apoplexy. \u201cYou can do better. Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\u201cWill it--we\u2019re supposed to be allies with Lanling Jin, do you think this will ruin--\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says firmly. \u201cIt won\u2019t ruin anything. Listen, your other father is too good to say it, so I will: You\u2019re forbidden from marrying someone just for the politics. In fact, I hear it is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses to marry anybody unless you have ridiculous, frivolous reasons to do so, like being wildly in love with them and not being able to live a day without them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a rule,\u201d Lan Zhan says crisply, because he has to. \u201cBut\u2026 it might be recommended.\u201d\nA-Yuan chews his lip and looks down. \u201cHe\u2019s not angry with me? You\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\u201cVery sure,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a bit weird for a little while, but that\u2019s to be expected. And anyway, if he\u2019s an asshole about it, you probably don\u2019t want to be friends with him anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Lan Zhan says that night, once more wrapped firmly around Wei Wuxian\u2019s entire body, though his grip isn\u2019t nearly as suffocating as it had been before. It helps that there aren\u2019t any Jiangs in his house anymore, Wei Wuxian thinks.\n\u201cMean what? I say a lot of things.\u201d\n\u201cForbidding A-Yuan from marrying for politics.\u201d\n\u201cI absolutely meant it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says firmly. He turns to face Lan Zhan and looks him dead in the eye. \u201cAnd moreover\u2026 Lan Wangji, Hanguang-jun, hear this oath: I, Wei Wuxian, swear to you that I will never encourage Lan Sizhui to marry anybody unless I am absolutely certain that they love him. You hear me? Certain.\u201d\n\u201cCertain,\u201d Lan Zhan echoes. \u201cI hear you.\u201d\nQuiet and intense, Wei Wuxian says: \u201cIf we get to have this, then so does he.\u201d It is a foundation that the world is built on, as much as their youthful oaths to defend the weak and live without regrets, and just as important. A-Yuan has been loved to bits his whole life as far as Wei Wuxian can tell, and he\u2019s not about to let that trend stop anytime soon. \u201cHe gets this too, and not a whit less than this.\u201d\nLan Zhan releases his breath and nods, and pushes closer so his face is buried in Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair.\nWei Wuxian pets him and murmurs soft nonsense to him, but in the innermost depths of his mind\u2026 he wonders. He just wonders, a little, if everything Jin Ling told him was true and accurate, and he wonders what exactly was said in that letter that he gave A-Yuan, and he resolves to watch, and to keep wondering.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to wonder about the letter for long, because A-Yuan brings it the next day, puts it down silently in front of him, and sits back with his hands in his lap and his back very straight. In this moment, and often in other moments, he takes so much after Lan Zhan that it makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart sting in a complicated way--on one hand, the throb of joy as he recognizes the influence of the person he loves so fiercely, like the faint echo of a favorite song. On the other hand, a thread of regret--he\u2019ll never know A-Yuan like Lan Zhan does. He missed too much. The boy\u2019s nearly grown, closer to eighteen than seventeen, and probably long past the days when he could have inherited anything from Wei Wuxian except what shows in little flashes here and there. No, he\u2019s Lan to his bones now, and Wei Wuxian can\u2019t bring himself to feel more sorrow over it than that single thread.\nAll of A-Yuan\u2019s capacity for Lan Zhan\u2019s poise and reserve is being exercised to the fullest today. He must be feeling very off-balance, still, if he is so strongly modeling himself on a projection of calm and stability. It is the same thing that Lan Zhan does when he is uncomfortable, and it\u2019s no more true for Lan Zhan than it is for A-Yuan in this moment.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian wonders, and feels a little shy and awkward for wondering, why A-Yuan bothered coming to him, rather than to Lan Zhan.\nHe opens the letter, reads it. It seems normal. It\u2019s written in a neat hand with no evidence of tremor, in clean, clear language. More restrained and mature than Wei Wuxian would have given Jin Ling credit for--he\u2019s a little impressed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u00a0\nA-Yuan silently points to one edge of the paper. Wei Wuxian has to hold it up to the light and squint to see the words--he might have missed them entirely if A-Yuan hadn\u2019t pointed them out.\n\nI hope we\u2019re still friends.\n\nAh, damn. There\u2019s some feelings involved after all. A little heartbreak, at least, a very little one. Wei Wuxian had thought he\u2019d spotted something, but he\u2019s so acclimated to reading Lan Zhan\u2019s emotions from the subtlest, smallest signs that Jin Ling\u2019s were a fireworks display by comparison. Wei Wuxian had been left with no impression other than big and bright and loud. \u00a0\nWei Wuxian wonders, suddenly, what Jiang Cheng said to him after they\u2019d left. Probably shouted and scolded the boy, if Wei Wuxian were to place a wager on it, probably made him feel\u2026 No. No, the kid would be making himself feel bad all on his own. A, anything Jiang Cheng could say wouldn\u2019t even scratch the surface. Wei Wuxian knows that feeling too well.\u00a0\nDamn, the kid really needs an uncle around. Perhaps Wei Wuxian could go visit him, just to check and see how he's doing.\u00a0\nTo A-Yuan, he says, \"Good that he wants to be friends, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d A-Yuan still looks unhappy.\n\u201cOi.\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps his fingers at him. He does not know why A-Yuan came to him instead of Lan Zhan, but he can deduce that it\u2019s because A-Yuan thinks he will do or say something that Lan Zhan won\u2019t. He is, therefore, determined to do it or say it, whatever it is. He\u2019ll just throw himself at the problem and it will resolve itself. \u201cBe less of a Lan right now. Tell me what you want so I can go ransack the world to find it.\u201d\nA-Yuan puts his face in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m confused.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Be friends with him\u00a0 or not. It\u2019s not spoiling anything.\u201d\n\u201cI keep\u2026 thinking about it.\u201d\n\u201cAbout\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cAbout how I didn\u2019t,\u201d A-Yuan says slowly, \u201cactually say no to him.\u201d He winces and gives Wei Wuxian big puppy eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Hanguang-jun? I know he\u2019s unhappy about it.\u201d\nInteresting. Extremely interesting. That explains why he\u2019s here, then--he wants advice, and he doesn\u2019t want to upset Lan Zhan. \u201cYou want to marry Jin Ling?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\u2026 not want to marry him.\u201d\n\u201cDo you like him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWei Wuxian loves two people more than anyone else in all the world, and right now he wants to strangle the one that\u2019s in front of him. Lans! Get them to make a decision and they\u2019ll make the shit out of it; before that, they tangle themselves up in rules and the nonsense in their heads. \u201cBetter figure it out, then. Get more information. Hunt it down like a fierce corpse.\u201d\nWhich is very good advice, Wei Wuxian thinks, and he is so proud of it that he decides to take it for himself as well.\nHe leans forward and pats A-Yuan\u2019s hand. The only other thing he knows how to do is to tease, pushing someone out of their worry until they laugh or smack him or both. So he says: \u201cThe bookshop in Caiyi Town will sell you pornography if you need ideas. Let me know if you need help making covers for them.\u201d\nA-Yuan abruptly changes his allegiance to whom he takes after when he says, without missing a beat: \u201cAll your fake covers look like garbage.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one of those little occasional flashes of Wei Wuxian himself, and once again it makes his heart catch in his chest with surprised glee. Wei Wuxian knows this song, though--he scolds him roundly for impertinence, threatens to plant him in a hole in the ground again until A-Yuan\u2019s melancholy breaks on a laugh and he runs out of the room, Wei Wuxian close on his heels and shaking his finger and calling him all the rude names that mean I love you.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian mulls over the decision as to whether or not this whole situation is any of his business, decides that it definitely is his business (most things in this world are), mentally rolls up his sleeves, and starts playing the game.\nHe\u2019s not even entirely sure which game he\u2019s playing, or whose side he\u2019s on, or what his goal is--even after he visits Jin Ling and gets him all drunk and adorable. Once Jin Ling falls over asleep, Wei Wuxian rolls him up in a blanket like a giant dumpling and leaves him to sleep on the floor.\nHe watches. He waits. He is thrilled and fascinated when Sizhui gets a letter from Jin Ling, and the part of his heart that is reserved solely for his A-Yuan is sharply comforted to see his son\u2019s tension and worry slump out of him all at once, replaced by the simple joy and relief of knowing that he hasn\u2019t lost a friend. Wei Wuxian had words of advice for Jin Ling, but he doesn\u2019t think that Sizhui needs any more--he\u2019s a hard worker, determined, and besides that he is a Lan: He loves Jin Ling as friends at the very least, and Wei Wuxian has never known a Lan to change their mind when it comes to that sort of thing.\nSizhui has dinner with them in the Jingshi that night, the day the letter comes, and he chatters about it the entire time with a very un-Lannish effusiveness, despite Lan Zhan\u2019s pointed reminders that it is forbidden to speak during meals. Sizhui shows Wei Wuxian the flawed illumination talisman that Jin Ling has sent along, interrogates him about them until Wei Wuxian\u2019s head aches, and runs off to write a letter in response instead of lingering until dusk fades, as he usually does.\nWei Wuxian watches him go with an aching fondness, a bouncing trail of dark hair and white robes and ribbon like a moth fluttering through the gathering dark, and then he turns to Lan Zhan. \u201cThat kid\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan did a good job raising him.\u201d\nLan Zhan\u2019s expression is soft and pleased. \u201cWhen he came to me, he was good already. I did very little.\u201d\nWei Wuxian leans back on his hands and stretches out his leg to poke Lan Zhan\u2019s ankle with his toes. \u201cJin Ling\u2019s not the last suitor we\u2019re going to see, you know.\u201d\n\u201cTo be expected,\u201d Lan Zhan says, rueful. \u201cWe cannot cut off A-Yuan\u2019s legs to keep him little forever.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees with a sigh. But\u2026 This little game he\u2019s playing with himself is getting more interesting by the day. He\u2019s kept quiet about his investment in it so far, knowing that it will only make Lan Zhan stressed, but playing a game all on his own is boring. Lan Zhan is his favorite person to play games with. So he says, speculative, \u201cHey. Hey, Lan-er-gege. Wanna make a bet?\u201d\nLan Zhan quirks an eyebrow at him, stacking the bowls of dinner onto the tray for the servants to remove.\n\u201cI bet,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, slow and dramatic, \u201cthat we haven\u2019t seen the last of Jin Ling, either.\u201d\nLan Zhan\u2019s expression tightens.\n\u201cNo, no, hear me out,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Zhan says. \u201cI will not make wagers on my son\u2019s personal life.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very uncharitable way of looking at it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says primly. \u201cWe\u2019re not wagering on A-Yuan at all. We\u2019re just wagering on\u2026 Jin Ling trying a new tactic. Just for fun. Let\u2019s say I win five talents if he comes back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d\n\u201cThen you can celebrate by tearing off my clothes and having your wicked way with my helpless body,\u201d Wei Wuxian purrs, running his toes up the Lan Zhan\u2019s shin.\u00a0\nLan Zhan\u2019s fingers wrap around his ankle--not pushing him away, just holding him, like he\u2019d hold Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists to pin him. \u201cI can do that anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I can take five talents from you whenever I like too,\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s harmless fun.\u201d He flutters his eyelashes. \u201cUnless Hanguang-jun wants me to earn my pocket money tonight?\u201d\nHanguang-jun did want him to earn his pocket money, as it turned out.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nNothing happens for a few weeks, but Wei Wuxian keeps thinking about Sizhui, and about the inevitable horde of suitors who will inevitably descend upon the Cloud Recesses--boys, girls, whoever gets around to spotting Sizhui and thinking, as Jin Ling did, what a fine partner he\u2019d make for them. Jin Ling wasn\u2019t wrong when he said that Sizhui would be a good political match for him. He\u2019d be a good match for anyone--so far, it\u2019s looking pretty damn likely that Sizhui\u2019s going to be the heir to the whole sect, unless Zewu-jun comes out of seclusion and produces an heir of his own.\nBut Wei Wuxian knows Lans. He knows the Twin Jades, specifically. He knows the odds of that happening, and it puts a soft, tender ache in his heart. No--it\u2019ll be Sizhui, in all likelihood.\nWei Wuxian thinks about Jin Ling, too. For all his bluster and teenage arrogance, he\u2019s a good kid. Wei Wuxian can see so much of Shijie in him now that he knows him a little better. He has all the best parts of her: her protectiveness, her fierce caring, her warmth like spring sunshine.\nWei Wuxian thinks, and thinks, and thinks, and bides his time, waiting for the game to progress until his turn comes around again, and in the meantime he models some Lan discipline himself and gathers knowledge like sheaves of wheat. Quietly, so that no one notices, he starts taking inventory.\nHe starts with the Jin sect, just out of curiosity. He maps out Jin Ling\u2019s pedigree through six generations, uses cunning and wiles to compile a fairly comprehensive dossier of the Jin assets and territories. He does the same thing for a handful of the other sects too, picking a few of their heirs and running simulations in his head about how it might play out if one of them were to come courting.\nHe does it for the Lan sect too, as if he is an outsider, just to see how much information he can gather on them. For example, based on a few soil tests and local gossip, he\u2019s fairly sure there\u2019s silver in the hills around Qian\u2019s Spring, one of Gusu\u2019s minor villages, near the border to Jin Ling\u2019s territories.\u00a0\nThese sort of bits of trivia may be useful in marriage negotiations one day, and they are intriguing now. It\u2019s an interesting thought experiment, and he\u2019s fairly certain that the heaps of facts that he gathers about the clans still only scratch the surface of what Jin Guangyao had likely known, but Wei Wuxian is only a hobbyist. He is not looking to become matchmaker to the clans. He has A-Yuan, and he has his nephew, and he will see them both marry well, even if he has to break a sweat to do it.\n\n\n\n*\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd then one morning Wei Wuxian wakes up, naked and delightfully sore from the previous night and early this morning, to a frantic knocking at his front door and a plaintive little voice calling for him.\nIn his bleary, barely-conscious state, he thinks it\u2019s A-Yuan at first, but--no, A-Yuan doesn\u2019t knock like that.\n\u201cWhozit?\u201d he calls.\n\u201cJin Ling!\u201d\nInteresting. Very, very, very interesting. Wei Wuxian pushes himself up, blinking and squinting at the door, and ponders to himself that he probably just won five talents off Lan Zhan.\u00a0\nHe lets Jin Ling in.\nWei Wuxian is terribly fond of his nephew, but he has little patience in the mornings, and if Jin Ling has come all this way just to have a teenage meltdown at eight o\u2019clock in the fucking morning, then he can damn well go have it somewhere else and leave Wei Wuxian to sleep.\nAnd then Jin Ling, his little nephew, all of sixteen and at once so alarmingly grown-up and so fucking young, still a child, chokes out, \u201cUncle,\u201d and Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart stops dead in his chest from both astonishment and from the particular aching longing for family that he has carried with him his whole life.\u00a0\nIn that instant, with that one word and all unknowing, Jin Ling gains his unquestioning allegiance. He will do anything this child asks of him. He will ransack the country for him. In the heartbeat of space between that word and the next thing Jin Ling says, Wei Wuxian rearranges his heart so there\u2019s a piece of it that is reserved just for Jin Ling, and he adds a third name to the list of his favorite people in all the world.\nAnd then Jin Ling says, \u201cPlease. I love him.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels a burst of light in his chest, a sizzling firework of fierce joy and triumph and delight and overwhelming fondness, and in the wake of that, a sharp and visceral nostalgia for what it was like to be sixteen and so hopelessly in love that it left him more lost and bewildered than even the depths of the Burial Mounds ever did.\nThere is no way to explain this to Jin Ling. Their perspectives are too different--they don\u2019t share a language in which they can even begin to talk about it yet. Perhaps in another sixteen years, he\u2019ll be able to speak of this.\u00a0\nFor now, all he can say is: \u201cWell then. That changes things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nAn hour later, he is dressed and has listened to his nephew wax lyrical and despairing. In every note Wei Wuxian has heard the echo of his younger self, has heard Jin Ling singing a refrain that rings absolutely, devastatingly true and calls up ache after ache in Wei Wuxian\u2019s own heart, all the tender old spots, little yearnings that had all blurred together and faded over time until he\u2019d forgotten them like worn old clothes folded in the bottom of a trunk. Jin Ling, his hands over his eyes for propriety and no knowledge of what he\u2019s doing as he speaks, unpicks the stitches of Wei Wuxian\u2019s every carefully mended tear, every scrap of camouflaging embroidery, every patch sewn on to cover the threadbare soul at the core of him, repaired slowly by love and time.\nThat\u2019s the thing about children, Wei Wuxian is discovering. Sometimes, unwittingly, they say things that shake you to your foundations, and you can\u2019t tell them what kind of profound effect they\u2019re having on you even while you\u2019re rearranging your heart for them. Wei Wuxian\u2019s hurts and tender spots are ancient history; Jin Ling\u2019s are immediate and present. They take precedence right now.\u00a0\nAll the love in his heart is taken up today, split between Lan Zhan and A-Yuan and A-Ling. He spares a brief moment of apprehension to wonder whether he\u2019s going to be able to juggle three aspects of love without hurting any of them.\u00a0\nHe is still playing his game, of course. There is no option notto play it, to refuse to take anyone\u2019s side at all, because that would hurt at least one of them, and possibly all of them. He loves them too much to forsake them on this, so now it only remains to be seen whether the Yiling Patriarch is clever enough to play all four sides deftly enough that everyone comes out a winner.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nLan Zhan is scared.\nWei Wuxian is sitting across the table from his husband in the Lan administrative offices with his nephew vibrating at his side while they wait for Sizhui to arrive, and his husband is scared.\nWei Wuxian knew with a calm and level certainty that he would be. He led with flirting and teasing because Lan Zhan knows what to do with that. It is familiar and comfortable and it says to him, Wei Wuxian hopes, This is normal, there is nothing to fear, I am yours and you are mine. Be at ease.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and to Jin Ling it probably sounds angry--to a younger Wei Wuxian, it would sound angry too.\u00a0\nThe Wei Wuxian of today hears fear, hears uncertainty, hears What are you doing? and I don\u2019t know what to think and I feel like I\u2019m in danger of losing someone I love. For all of Wei Wuxian\u2019s threadbare little heart, Lan Zhan\u2019s is worse off. Nobody knows that about him. Nobody knows to handle it gently. He\u2019s lost his mother and Wei Wuxian to death, he\u2019s lost his brother to seclusion and heartbreak, and now he thinks he\u2019s losing his son, the only thing which brought him any joy in a decade and a half of grief.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, meeting his beloved\u2019s eyes steadily. He is projecting confidence and calm assurance as hard as he can.\nThey have a whole conversation in that shared look, as they have had hundreds of times before. At the heart of every one of those conversations is just the call and response: Do you trust me? Yes, with my life.\nSo the only thing that Lan Zhan asks is: \u201cCertain?\u201d An echo of the oath that Wei Wuxian swore, weeks ago.\nWei Wuxian nods slowly, not breaking eye contact, and he sees the bravest man he has ever known steel himself to be brave again, setting aside his fear, and Wei Wuxian thinks of himself at Jin Ling\u2019s age and marvels to think that there was a time when he couldn\u2019t feel the incandescent brilliance of this love echoing back through the years from this moment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nHe leaves the children to their own devices. The game board has been set, and opening gambits have been made. Now they pause to regroup and review their positions.\nLan Zhan is waiting for him in the hallway just outside the office when he exits. Without exchanging a word or looking at each other or touching, they go back to the Jingshi, and Lan Zhan sets aside his sword and pushes Wei Wuxian into bed and wraps python-like around him, fingertips digging into Wei Wuxian\u2019s flesh and his face pushing close against Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck.\nWei Wuxian pets his hair, and they simply lie like that for a time.\n\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d he whispers. It\u2019s the middle of the morning and the sun is bright--the words don\u2019t have quite the same power as they do when whispered into the dark. \u201cI\u2019m here, and I\u2019m all yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou took his side,\u201d Lan Zhan says. He is not injured or hurt. He does not feel betrayed; Wei Wuxian would know. Frustrated, though, yes--and uncomfortable, off-balance. He does not feel secure.\n\u201cThe only other side to take was A-Yuan\u2019s, and\u2026 A-Yuan has you,\u201d he murmurs back. \u201cA-Yuan has had you all his life. He doesn\u2019t need me right now--he needs you.\u201d\n\u201cNot true.\u201d\n\u201cThing is,\u201d he continues, more delicately, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that A-Ling has ever had someone on his side. I wanted him to know what that was like. He deserves to have someone.\u201d\n\u201cJiang Wanyin. Jin Guangyao. Many people have been on his side.\u201d\n\u201cMm, they pulled him onto their sides. Don\u2019t know that any of them took his.\u201d Wei Wuxian pulls off Lan Zhan\u2019s hair ornament so he can rub his face against the top of his head. \u201cForgive him. He\u2019s young. He reminds me of me--same kind of idiot.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSame kind of stupid over a beautiful and unattainable piece of Lan perfection,\u201d Wei Wuxian says wryly. \u201cYou people don\u2019t make it easy on us, you know.\u201d\nLan Zhan huffs against his neck. \u201cAm attained. Was attained from the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cFrom when? Which moment?\u201d\n\u201cThe first.\u201d\n\u201cLiar,\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts, brimming with fondness. \u201cFirst moment, you ignored me and silenced me. Second moment, you kicked my ass, silenced me, and tattled on me to your brother and Lan Qiren. Third moment was, uh...\u201d\n\u201cFirst moment,\u201d Lan Zhan insists. \u201cThought the boy at the gate was too pretty. Distracting mouth.\u201d\nWei Wuxian cannot speak for several seconds. \u201cOh my god, stop talking.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d agrees Lan Zhan.\n\u201cNo! No, keep going. Tell me everything you thought about my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cIt talked too much. Looked too soft. Thought it should be shut up. Thought about how.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhaaan,\u201d he sings, squirming with delight and tugging at Lan Zhan\u2019s hair. \u201cShameless!\u201d\u00a0\nHe\u2019s expecting a sharp nip of teeth at his neck, but Lan Zhan only nods a little and hugs him tighter. Still other business to resolve first, then, that\u2019s what that means. \u201cIs it okay? Do you forgive me? For being Jin Ling\u2019s uncle in this, instead of Lan Zhan\u2019s husband?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Zhan says. Then, begrudgingly, \u201cHe is very young.\u201d\n\u201cYounger than A-Yuan, even.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to like him,\u201d Lan Zhan says stubbornly. \u201cHe hurt Wei Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian flops dramatically into the pillows. \u201cOh, woe! I am so feeble that even a toddler with a paring knife can overcome me! Oh, what shall I do in this cruel and horrible world? Have I no protector?\u201d\nLan Zhan pushes himself up on his elbows to watch this show. He\u2019s feigning sternness now, but Wei Wuxian can see the quirk of amusement hiding just at the corner of his mouth.\n\u201cI shall lie here all helpless,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, tossing his head back and forth theatrically. \u201cI shall hope that no infants with toothpicks cross my path! Even worse, I will pray with all my heart that no evil man happens upon me, oh woe, else I will surely fall victim to his monstrous appetites. I, a delicate flower who--Lan Zhan, hurry up, this is turning me on--who is defenseless and fragile! Oh woe, I hope that no vile man of insatiable lusts sets his wicked eyes upon my tender, frail self and decides to ravish me--Lan Zhan, please, I\u2019m running out of synonyms--\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan kisses him. \u201cDistracting mouth,\u201d he says between kisses. \u201cShutting you up.\u201d\n\u201cOh nooo,\u201d Wei Wuxian croons back, winding his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s neck. \u201cOh no, I\u2019ve been captured. Oh woe.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nWei Wuxian has made a tactical error. His tactical error was in assuming that a single afternoon of vigorous and spectacular sex would be enough to distract Lan Zhan from this little ordeal that he is blowing so dramatically out of proportion.\u00a0\nHe realizes his error at the same moment that he spots, from across the courtyard, Lan Zhan striding towards the library with Sizhui red-faced and anxious at his heels, tugging at his sleeve to get him to stop. Lan Zhan shakes him off, takes Sizhui by the upper arm, and steers him along, as thunderous as Wei Wuxian has ever seen him.\u00a0\n\u201cAh fuck,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters under his breath, and trots after them, already wondering where Jin Ling is.\nHe sets one foot in the library when Lan Zhan whirls on him and says, \u201cYour rake of a nephew took liberties with my son.\u201d\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Sizhui says, yanking Lan Zhan by the shoulder to face him again. Damn, little A-Yuan has gotten tall, Wei Wuxian notices. When did that happen? He\u2019s as tall as Wei Wuxian is now, and he\u2019s right up in Lan Zhan\u2019s face, absolutely fearless. His dark eyes, usually so soft and sweet, are flashing with anger. \u201cFather, stop.\u201d\n\u201cI will throw that boy out,\u201d Lan Zhan says, icy.\u00a0\n\u201cYou will do no such thing,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cIf you throw him out, I\u2019m going with him.\u201d\nInteresting. Wei Wuxian carefully does not cheer. He clears his throat. \u201cWhen you say took liberties\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI was kissing him on the back porch of the guest house,\u201d Sizhui snaps. \u201cI was kissing him. It was my idea, I wanted to, I asked, I convinced him. If anyone was taking liberties, it was me.\u201d\n\u201cInappropriate behavior,\u201d Lan Zhan snarls.\n\u201cHypocrite,\u201d Sizhui shoots back.\nLan Zhan huffs and turns away, his jaw clenched. Sizhui glares at his back, then turns to Wei Wuxian with that same righteous anger, ready to fight him too if Wei Wuxian gives him the slightest reason to do so.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian has from time to time seen little firefly-flashes of Sizhui taking after him, but in this moment, Sizhui has set aside all his Lan and is pure, burning Wei: There is someone who is being treated unfairly, and Sizhui is going to stand up for him--even with all his feelings set aside, the mere fact that no one else in the room is defending Jin Ling would be enough of a reason for Sizhui to do so.\nWei Wuxian wants to hug him, wants to cheer him on, wants to beam with pride, and he realizes suddenly exactly how Lan Zhan feels. He looks at this Sizhui--Wei Sizhui--and feels every fiber of his body resonate with a pressing sense of recognition: My child. Mine. If the glimpses of Lan Zhan\u2019s influence on the boy strike Wei Wuxian like the strains of a favorite song heard across a long distance, then this reflection of himself is\u2026\u00a0 He has no words. He can only smile so hard his face hurts, and step quickly forward to squeeze Sizhui\u2019s hand and upper arm and whisper in his ear the words that he would have killed to hear when he was Sizhui\u2019s age: \u201cYes. Fight for him. Good.\u201d\nSizhui pulls back and blinks at him, the rage flickering out just long enough for a hesitant smile to spark through his eyes--where did he come by that particular strain of sweetness? Wei Wuxian cannot figure that one out. It\u2019s not Lan Zhan, and it\u2019s not himself.\u00a0\nBut then Lan Zhan is turning back for another round of the fight, and Sizhui is turning to meet him, his hand slipping out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and while Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t really mind receiving the occasional light stabbing from close family members, he is nevertheless not so suicidal that he\u2019s about to get in the middle of this.\nAnd besides, Jin Ling has been left alone, again, with no one on his side. The thought makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart colder now than it ever has before.\nHe edges towards the door and scampers out, hearing only Lan Zhan spit something under his breath that sounds outright bitchy, and Sizhui say immediately in response, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about him like that!\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough to make Wei Wuxian\u2019s hurrying steps pause briefly, and to bring a thoughtful smile to his face. A very interesting development. Part of him wants to stay and watch Lan Zhan\u2019s immovable object meet once more the unstoppable force of Wei-styled teenage rebellion, but Sizhui seems to be holding his own, and Wei Wuxian needs to make sure that Jin Ling isn\u2019t bleeding to death somewhere, or preparing to throw himself into a river. Not that a river would do much--he\u2019s Jiang Cheng\u2019s nephew too, and nobody who spends more than a summer in Lotus Pier gets out of learning how to swim.\u00a0\nStill, Wei Wuxian could appreciate the poetics of the gesture. If Jin Ling wants to ritually throw himself in a river, Wei Wuxian will allow it, and then he\u2019ll fish the boy out and rub him dry with towels until he\u2019s all mussed and tousled and grouchy.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nAfter ensuring that his nephew is neither wet and bedraggled nor bleeding to death nor in danger of running off to become a rogue cultivator before his best uncle can solve his problems for him, Wei Wuxian returns to the Jingshi for dinner, thinking about the sneakiest way to break into the administrative offices for a last look at the ledgers. He expects to find Lan Zhan still in a towering rage or at least a dark sulk, and he has all his debate points and arguments and distracting flirtations prepared, but he\u2019s still yards away from the door when he hears the low, mournful notes of the guqin and realizes that he has to change his strategy again. No matter. He is flexible.\nHe opens the door and says, \u201cOh, food! I\u2019m starving!\u201d as if he doesn\u2019t notice Lan Zhan being dramatically wistful in the corner. Dramatic wistfulness is the Lan specialty and does not require praise, validation, or encouragement any more than the sunrise does, or the changing of the seasons, or gravity. \u201cLan Zhan, come eat! Did you wait for me? So sweet, so thoughtful.\u201d He sits with his back towards Lan Zhan, shovels food into both their bowls and picks up his chopsticks. \u201cAh, I did a lot of work today! So did you, Lan Zhan, you must be hungry too.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan gets up in silence and joins him at the table.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shovels food into his mouth. Lan Zhan only picks at his, eating nothing, and finally Wei Wuxian pushes his empty bowl away and sighs. \u201cHow\u2019d it go with A-Yuan?\u201d\nLan Zhan sighs.\n\u201cThat good, eh?\u201d Wei Wuxian eyes him, pouring them both tea. \u201cDid you lose?\u201d\n\u201cI am a bad father,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\nWei Wuxian can\u2019t help but snort into his teacup. Lan Zhan gives him an aggrieved look. \u201cDid A-Yuan tell you that or did you come up with it all on your own?\u201d\nThe aggrieved look turns offended. \u201cHe is too polite to say such a thing.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. Wonder where he got those pretty manners from, then,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, sipping tea. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery. Would a bad father have taught him so well?\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says, frowning.\n\u201cYou seem like a pretty great father to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019d let you raise more of my kids.\u201d Lan Zhan blinks at him, the equivalent of dropping his jaw on the floor, and Wei Wuxian smirks. \u201cWhat? I would. You wanna have more kids, A-Zhan? Don\u2019t answer right now--let\u2019s finish up with current business first, get this one married off.\u201d He adds, innocently, \u201cMain benefit to consider, though: The more kids we have, the fewer of them will be able to marry Jiangs. Limited supply, you know. And it\u2019s just statistically unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says. His ears are red. Wei Wuxian is going to end up with six more kids. Maybe more. Enough to start a competitive archery team. Enough to start their own sect.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sighs, sets down his teacup, and takes Lan Zhan\u2019s hands. \u201cI have bad news for you. I\u2019m pretty sure A-Yuan is going to marry that boy. I have worse news for you: Since you\u2019re not a bad father, you\u2019re going to end up finding a way to live with it.\u201d\n\u201cHe hurt Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s taking my son away--\u201d\n\u201cA-Yuan is, currently, the Lan heir,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, finally losing a bit of his patience. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere, except to Lanling, and I daresay that\u2019s only going to be part time--he\u2019s going to have to come back here for heir business, and because he loves you and he loves Gusu. Besides that, you can write to him. You can visit him. We can go live in Lanling if it\u2019s hurting you so much to think of being apart from him.\u201d\nLan Zhan blinks, as if he had not thought of that possibility.\u00a0\n\u201cUs and our army of children,\u201d Wei Wuxian adds with relish. \u201cYou want to talk about shameless behavior? We\u2019ll shamelessly take advantage of Jin hospitality. We\u2019ll take up all their guest rooms and eat all their food and drink all their--well, I\u2019ll drink all their wine, you can drink all their tea. A-Ling will have to let us stay with him; it would be scandalous to turn away his in-laws. We\u2019re going to have fun with him. Do me a favor--if you start liking him a little bit, don\u2019t let him know. Keep glaring at him for a few more years, it\u2019ll keep him on his toes.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan, whose ears had reddened again at the mention of an army of children.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sips his tea, leisurely lines up his coup de grace, and says casually, \u201cNot to mention the last thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat thing,\u201d Lan Zhan says.\n\u201cWell. You know. One sect heir marrying another sect heir?\u201d Wei Wuxian says pointedly. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to come up with heirs of their own, one way or another. Y\u2019know. Our grandchildren.\u201d\nLan Zhan goes absolutely blank.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian finishes his tea, humming to himself. He clears the dishes from the table and leaves the tray by the porch steps for the servants to collect. He lights a few candles, takes out the disciples\u2019 essays for grading.\nLan Zhan does not speak, move, or blink, as far as Wei Wuxian can tell, for a solid hour. At last he draws a huge breath and says, \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cBetter hope that none of them have little paring knives, though.\u201d Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t look up from grading. \u201cYour poor helpless husband, attacked with many teeny, teeny stabs. Woe. Woe.\u201d\nLan Zhan doesn\u2019t speak or move again until Wei Wuxian has finished with grading. He blows out the candles, packs away the essays, pulls an unresisting Lan Zhan to his feet, and bundles him into bed.\nHe leans over Lan Zhan, lying flat on his back and staring gobsmacked at the ceiling, and snaps his fingers in front of Lan Zhan\u2019s face. \u201cHey. Want to have some more sex? I want to go get some fresh air before bed, but I\u2019ll help you fall asleep first if you want.\u201d\n\u201cGrandchildren,\u201d Lan Zhan says, as if it is a word he has never heard before and is trying to wrap his head around the concept and his tongue around the pronunciation.\n\u201cNatural risk of having kids,\u201d Wei Wuxian says reasonably. \u201cBut let\u2019s not talk about them when I\u2019m trying to chat you up. Sex? Yes, no?\u201d\nOf course the answer is yes--the answer has, so far, always and emphatically been yes. Lan Zhan visibly shakes off his stunned haze, pulls Wei Wuxian down by his collar, kisses him. He\u2019s in an unusual mood, all pliant and yielding, and Wei Wuxian honestly can\u2019t blame him--it\u2019s been a very long day. He smiles into Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth and enjoys the opportunity to unwind him slowly, first from his robes and ribbon and then from his restraint. He keeps most of his own clothing on, only undoing enough that he can get some bare skin against Lan Zhan\u2019s. It\u2019s easy, unhurried, and uncomplicated--he gets between Lan Zhan\u2019s perfect thighs and takes them both in hand, biting softly at all the places Lan Zhan likes best and murmuring nonsense against the hinge of his jaw until Lan Zhan is shuddering beneath him, squirming and clutching at Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder-blades. Wei Wuxian never increases the lazy rhythm of his hand, instead driving Lan Zhan over the edge with adoring words in his ear, and wet open-mouthed kisses on his neck. Wei Wuxian follows him, gasping his laughter into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair. They\u2019ve barely broken a sweat.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian sits back on his heels, robes hanging loose around him, and surveys the glory laid out before him, grinning. He swipes his hand through the mess on Lan Zhan\u2019s stomach--not horrible, since they already went three rounds today--and wipes it down his own bare chest. \u201cThere,\u201d he says, satisfied. \u201cNow if anyone catches me while I\u2019m out on my walk, they\u2019ll know I\u2019m yours.\u201d\u00a0\nHe dips to kiss Lan Zhan\u2019s perfect white-jade hipbone while his husband mumbles, halfheartedly, \u201cShameless. Disgusting.\u201d\nWei Wuxian bites him in the soft place just above the hipbone, a spot he knows is ticklish, and Lan Zhan jumps, shoving at his shoulder. Wei Wuxian, giggling, rolls out of bed and ties up his clothes again. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nHe is there when Lan Zhan wakes up, barely. He slips back in with the first faint grey light of dawn, throws his clothes into a pile on the floor, and wriggles into bed and around Lan Zhan.\nLan Zhan wakes, minutes later, and Wei Wuxian yawns hugely and murmurs, \u201cYou stole all the blankets last night, I\u2019m cold,\u201d just in case Lan Zhan notices that he\u2019s not as cozy as he should be if he\u2019d been there all night. He cracks an eye open, slides a hand over Lan Zhan\u2019s thigh under the covers, and says slyly, \u201cDo the honorable thing. Take responsibility and warm me up.\u201d\nLan Zhan\u2019s unusual mood has passed with the night--Wei Wuxian is comprehensively warmed up.\nIn the afterglow, still sticky and sweaty and drunk on each other, Wei Wuxian laughs and says, a little delirious, \u201cMarry me again. Marry me seven more times.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Zhan, untangling himself from Wei Wuxian and tucking the blankets snugly around him. \u201cEight more.\u201d\n\u201cNine.\u201d\n\u201cEvery day.\u201d\n\u201cDeal. I do love negotiating with you, gege.\u201d\nWhen Lan Zhan is done with the blankets, he sits on the edge of the bed, facing him. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, in a different tone.\nWei Wuxian eyes him over the edge of the blanket, which he has been swaddled in up to his nose. \u201cWorried about today?\u201d Lan Zhan shrugs, which is a huge improvement from yesterday. \u201cResigned?\u201d A nod. \u201cNot yet happy about it?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan says nothing for a moment. At last: \u201cI will be happy if A-Yuan is happy,\u201d he says stoically, and Wei Wuxian has to flail himself free from the blankets and sit up to kiss him.\n\u201cGood boy, good boy,\u201d he says. \u201cI will try to make it easy for you today. I will flirt with you the entire time. The children will hate it.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Zhan.\n\u201cI\u2019ll use my sex voice,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI\u2019ll bat my eyes at you and you\u2019ll think about me naked in your bed, and then I\u2019ll kick the kids out of your office so we can fuck on your desk.\u201d\nLan Zhan considers this solemnly, as if it is a matter of serious political import, and nods. \u201cYes.\u201d\nWei Wuxian plants a smacking kiss on his cheek, flings himself back into the pillows, and rolls onto his side. \u201cGood! Back to sleep. See you later.\u201d\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nThat afternoon, after all the negotiations and the post-negotiations sex, Wei Wuxian swaggers out of Lan Zhan\u2019s office with a last tug on his robes to straighten them. He is practically whistling. He has a new enormous hickey, high enough on his neck that there\u2019s really no chance of hiding it. Lan Zhan hadn\u2019t even pretended to be ashamed when he\u2019d seen his work, the territorial bastard.\nWei Wuxian tucks his thumbs into his belt and saunters towards the kitchens. He is pleased with himself, with his husband, with his nephew, with his son, with the world in general. He needs a snack and then everything will be perfect.\nHe swings himself around the doorpost into the kitchen and nearly runs face-first into Sizhui.\n\u201cA-ah, hello,\u201d says Sizhui. He has a bag in his arms and a very innocent look on his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you so soon. I thought\u2026 uh... \u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019d be occupied? Why? What are you doing?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. He\u2019s seen enough teenage sneaking in his life to be immediately curious--he was once an expert on teenage sneaking. Quick as a snake, he snatches the bag from Sizhui and looks inside. It\u2019s full of a few days\u2019 rations, the sort they send with the night-hunting parties. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cThere was a report,\u201d Sizhui says immediately. \u201cJust outside Caiyi Town. A fierce corpse. I\u2019m going to go take care of it. Not a big deal.\u201d\nHe\u2019s lying and it\u2019s adorable and Wei Wuxian, despite his warm benevolence towards the whole world right now, is too good of a father to let him get away with it--how is Sizhui supposed to learn to lie better if he doesn\u2019t get any practice at being called out for it?\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking rations for a night hunt that you could finish and return from before suppertime?\u201d\n\u201cThou shalt show prudence and good sense, and thereby avert the worst of misfortune,\u201d Sizhui quotes earnestly. Lan precept #2032, Wei Wuxian thinks. Somewhere in the 2030s, anyway.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, widening his eyes and matching Sizhui\u2019s earnest tone. \u201cSuch a disciplined and righteous young man! Truly an exemplar for all young cultivators! Not even engaged for five minutes and already running away from your fiance to protect the local townsfolk from danger. No, no, this cannot be.\u201d Wei Wuxian shakes his finger. \u201cIf it\u2019s such a minor problem, a single fierce corpse, you should let someone else take care of it. Today is for celebrating.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Uh,\u201d says Sizhui.\u00a0\n\u201cYou should stay right here,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, smiling. \u201cAnd not go out.\u201d\n\u201cI. Really want to take care of this myself.\u201d Yes, he definitely needs more practice at lying--already his mask is slipping and Wei Wuxian can see a note of scrambling panic setting in.\nWei Wuxian slaps a hand to his heart. \u201cSuch a brave and upstanding son I have! Truly the heavens have blessed me! In that case, you must go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, nodding, and just when Sizhui relaxes and smiles again, he adds, \u201cAnd I will come with you. And we\u2019ll get several others. Hanguang-jun, too! He\u2019s been cooped up here too long, he could do with a little fun.\u201d Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know exactly why Sizhui wants to go out, but he can guess--so much teenage sneaking, Wei Wuxian knows from personal experience, is motivated by a keen desire to get the hell away from the loved ones who would otherwise obstruct you from attaining your end goals. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a big outing of it. Lots of people.\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d says Sizhui, alarmed. \u201cReally not necessary.\u201d\nWei Wuxian gives him an aggrieved look. \u201cYou aren\u2019t trying to hoard all the valor and glory for yourself, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sizhui cries. \u201cNo, of course not. I--uh--it\u2019s just a single corpse, that\u2019s all. We don\u2019t need--so many people--certainly not Hanguang-jun, definitely not\u2026 him. Or you. Stay here! You should stay here. With him. And everyone else. I\u2019ll take care of it. Not for valor or glory, just--service to the townsfolk.\u201d He nods. \u201cWe owe them protection. Very important.\u201d\n\u201cBut Sizhui,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, reproachful. \u201cWhat about that precept you just quoted about prudence and good sense? Surely it\u2019s better to take a team with you, even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need them.\u201d\n\u201cAhaha,\u201d says Sizhui. \u201cHa. Right. Of course. I will... be meeting up with Wen Ning.\u201d\nWei Wuxian peeks in the bag again, counts the rations. \u201cTwo nights\u2019 supplies, for one person,\u201d he muses, then lets himself light up. He is mentally rubbing his hands together with glee. \u201cOr one night\u2019s supplies for two people!\u201d\nSizhui goes a little pink, but he doesn\u2019t break eye contact. Wei Wuxian is so proud of him that he is not going to go easy on him in the slightest. \u201cThat\u2019s how math works, yes,\u201d he says. He\u2019s rallied now, and he\u2019s doing a fantastic job keeping his composure.\n\u201cSass,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cCheek. Also, Wen Ning doesn\u2019t eat. Why take rations at all? There\u2019s lots of inns in Caiyi Town, no? If it\u2019s too late to come home, you could just\u2026\u201d He smirks. \u201cGet a room.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be any rooms available,\u201d Sizhui says immediately--it\u2019s a prepared story, that\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s why he has all the answers at hand.\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t want to be found, if someone notices you\u2019re missing, and you think the inns would be the first place they\u2019d look,\u201d Wei Wuxian counters. He\u2019s dropping his innocent earnestness. \u201cHm?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMn,\u201d says Sizhui. Trying to model Lan Zhan, but that\u2019s not the right tactic for this situation. Ah, he is still young. He will learn. Lan Zhan can be himself so successfully because no one dares question him. It\u2019s all smoke and mirrors--no one notices when he\u2019s afraid, and no one even really notices that he\u2019s a huge bitch, even when he is being ice fucking cold to their faces. Sizhui is trying to use that poker face to bluff his way past embarrassment, but it\u2019d work much better if he went on the offensive and tried to turn embarrassment back on Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian says, tapping his chin thoughtfully with one finger. \u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201d\n\u201cStrange?\u201d says Sizhui, blinking like an innocent bunny.\n\u201cStrange that you\u2019d leave Jin Ling here. He\u2019s a good cultivator. He could handle a fierce corpse, surely.\u201d Wei Wuxian shoots him a sly glance. \u201cAfter all that work I did to soothe Lan Zhan\u2019s ruffled feathers, you\u2019re not\u2026 having second thoughts, are you? Maybe you don\u2019t want to marry that boy?\u201d\nHe is watching Sizhui very carefully, so he has the singular delight of watching the Lan in him go to war against the Wei. The Wei, being more nimble and adaptable, wins out, to Wei Wuxian\u2019s glee, and Sizhui rises immediately to the bait. \u201cI do want to marry him, I\u2019m going to marry him, nobody can stop me from marrying him--\u201d\n\u201cGreat, good,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201c--and he says won\u2019t kiss me in the Cloud Recesses ever again because he thinks that Hanguang-jun can smell lewd thoughts on a person from a mile away--\u201d\n\u201cTrue, but only mine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says placidly.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m taking him out of Cloud Recesses and we won\u2019t be back until tomorrow, so there,\u201d Sizhui finishes, and steps around him towards the door.\n\u201cNice comb,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, catching a glittering eyeful of it as Sizhui passes. It is a nice comb--the part of his brain that always calculates things in bags of turnips (or food for a starving sect, or seeds that won\u2019t thrive in thin, rocky soil, or scant handfuls of medicinal herbs to treat coughs that won\u2019t go away, the result of ashy, poisonous air) estimates the comb\u2019s value as, roughly, eyewatering. It blazes against Sizhui\u2019s hair like a little sun.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cI like it too.\u201d\nWei Wuxian catches his sleeve. \u201cTake more rations.\u201d\nSizhui turns back, a little frown between his eyebrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTake more rations. Take a few days.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave for that long,\u201d Sizhui says, slow and cautious. \u201cHanguang-jun will notice.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll cover for you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, as if it is the simplest thing in the world, because it is.\nAll the Wei pride drops off of Sizhui abruptly. He stares at Wei Wuxian, wide eyed. \u201cWhat, really?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian pouts. \u201cI\u2019m insulted that you\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t. What else do you want from me? Practical advice on how to smuggle in alcohol? I don\u2019t have advice about that, I just get Lan Zhan to carry it for me in broad daylight, and then he hides it under the floorboards in the Jingshi for me, and fetches it out for me, and pours it for me. I am useless to you in this regard. What else? You hate my cooking, and apparently my fake covers for pornography are garbage, so--\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui hurls himself at Wei Wuxian, laughing, and hugs him around the neck.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian creaks a protest. \u201cStrong.\u201d\nSizhui only hugs him tighter. After a moment, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t say thank you yet.\u201d\nWei Wuxian splutters. \u201cHow dare you. I have done nothing. I refuse. This is nonsense.\u201d He braces himself with all his strength, because he knows where this is going and it\u2019s awful. This is the sort of soft, earnest tone that a Lan uses right before they tell you that they wrote a love song about you when you were teenagers together, or that they are your long-lost son that you assumed had died years ago. This is unforgivable sincerity and Wei Wuxian is going to have to endure it again even though it makes him squirm with agony.\n\u201cYou did more than anybody else,\u201d Sizhui says, pulling back enough to look at him with those shy, adoring eyes. \u201cI was watching you. You comforted me and Hanguang-jun, and you were there for Jin Ling. You did so much.\u201d\nWei Wuxian splutters again. \u201cSpying on me, eh? Impertinent boy. Who gave you permission to pay any attention, eh? Did I tell you to do that? Who ever said that was fine?\u201d He points a finger in Sizhui\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take everything I do for granted, you hear? And then I\u2019ll sigh about my thankless child, and nobly endure! That's the way it works!\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s eyes are sparkling now and he\u2019s fighting back a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re doing such a good job nobly enduring right now.\u201d\n\u201cCheek!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouts at him.\n\u201cThank you for looking after A-Ling,\u201d Sizhui yells back. He\u2019s grinning outright now, horrible thing. \u201cI love you very much and I\u2019m glad he had you!\u201d\nWei Wuxian, swearing between his teeth, seizes a nearby dishtowel and tries to whap him about the head with it as Sizhui, giggling the whole time, ducks and weaves and--damn it, when did he get to be this good of a cultivator? Wei Wuxian can\u2019t land a hit on him. He steps back, hands on his hips, glaring at his terrible child to cover up all the wretchedly embarrassing soft, glowy feelings in his chest. \u201cWho taught you to say things like that? Eh? Who\u2019d you get that from?\u201d He snaps the dishtowel at that wretched child again, but Sizhui only laughs and dances out of his reach. \u201cBah. Get the hell out of here!\u201d He points in the general direction of the gates. \u201cTake your fiance and don\u2019t let me see your faces again for two days!\u201d\n\u201cOr what,\u201d says Sizhui, doing that precious little head-tilt that looks so politely inquisitive, except right now Wei Wuxian knows it is being used for backchat. \u201cYou\u2019ll plant us in the turnip fields?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian feints another attack with the dishcloth. \u201cYou--!\u201d Sizhui squeaks, laughs, and gives Wei Wuxian the sunniest grin as he ducks out the door."
