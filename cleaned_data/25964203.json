    "text": "Stomach clenching and bile rising high in his throat, Izuku keeps his eyes on the screen even as he fidgets.\u00a0 His hands twist themselves together and apart over and over again, nails digging into scar tissue to keep himself from picking at his nail beds until they bleed.\nHe used to do that constantly growing up.\u00a0 His fingertips had been one massive, throbbing ache for years on end, raw and hurting from ragged, bitten down nails and ruthlessly peeled back cuticles.\u00a0 The pain had been grounding though, had helped to keep him aware and  together  through everything.\nThat had been one of the things most people in school had known about him when he was younger. He was  quirkless first before anything else, he was a creepy mumbler who always scribbled in his notebooks second, and he was the gross kid whose fingers were almost always either actively bleeding or wrapped up in bandages.\nIt\u2019s a habit he\u2019d only managed to break the year before when having open wounds on his hands would have been equal to basically  begging for an infection since he\u2019d spent most of his free time elbow deep in trash at Dagobah Beach.\nIt\u2019s a habit he\u2019s honestly considering taking back up right now despite how much he knows any new kind of damage to his hands and arms, no matter how superficial, would be an overall  bad idea.\nIt\u2019s hard to bring himself to really care at the moment though because Izuku  knows that he\u2019s going to fail his final exam.\nBecause, once again, he\u2019s been paired with Kacchan.\u00a0 Only this time, instead of fighting one another, they\u2019re supposed to be working as a  team against a larger threat.\nAnd the larger threat they\u2019re going up against is going to be All Might.\nThere is, Izuku knows with a ragged sort of certainty, no way they\u2019ll be passing this exercise.\nAnd, if the sympathetic glances from Iida and Uraraka as well as the displeased light in Todoroki\u2019s expression is anything to go by, then he\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s already realized that.\n~~~\nIzuku had learned a long time ago not to ask his teachers for anything.\nTamakawa-sensei had taught him that in elementary school with long hours spent standing in the hall outside of the classroom.\u00a0 With days where he\u2019d been forced to balance dictionaries on his hands or to hold up a pail of water no matter how much his arms  ached from the stress.\nAll because he\u2019d asked a question that Tamakawa-sensei had considered  unnecessary.\u00a0 And any and every question Izuku had ever asked had always been deemed unnecessary.\nIzuku had learned real fast how to handle his own issues in class, how to research and teach himself anything he didn\u2019t understand.\nEvery teacher he\u2019s had since then has only ever reinforced that lesson with sneers or extra cleaning duties that quickly became him taking over  all  cleaning duties, or whatever other punishment they could think of to  \u2018teach him the realities of life for someone like him'.\nAizawa-sensei, for all of his occasional harshness, has been the fairest teacher Izuku\u2019s ever had.\u00a0 Being in the man\u2019s homeroom has been a pleasant sort of change for Izuku for the most part, as has most of his classes with the heroes teaching at UA if he\u2019s being honest.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Izuku  trusts the man, that doesn\u2019t mean he really trusts any of them except for All Might.\nHe knows they would protect him from villains, just like they\u2019d protect the rest of his classmates.\u00a0 Aizawa and Thirteen both had almost  died for his class at the USJ, Aizawa-sensei especially given the damage that had been dealt to him from both Shigaraki and the Nomu.\nIzuku has no doubts that any of the other teachers would have done the same in their positions.\nThe teachers at UA are  heroes.\u00a0 It\u2019s who and what they are.\u00a0 So of course they\u2019d stand between villains and their students, heroes in training or not.\nOf course they would.\u00a0 Of course Izuku trusts them with  that.\nBut on a personal level?\u00a0 When things like class work and homework assignments and  punishments are concerned?\nIzuku knows better than to expect much in any of those departments, knows better than to expect much of  anything if he\u2019s being honest.\nBut, in this moment and against all of these well known and long learned odds, Izuku\u2019s also desperate.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to fail.\u00a0 Not again, not  here, not against  All Might  who is counting on him for  so much  and has already given him more than anyone else in his entire life.\nSo, despite the way everything inside of him rebels at the very idea, despite the way he\u2019s already sure this won\u2019t work, Izuku still has to  try.\n\u201cSensei,\u201d Izuku murmurs quietly as he slides up to Aizawa\u2019s side, arms crossed over his chest and hands twisting in the fabric of his costume to try and still the urge to  bite.\n\u201cProblem Child,\u201d Aizawa stares down at him, one brow arched in question but face otherwise blank.\n\u201cI-I know it\u2019s really late and really selfish and that there\u2019s a point to these m-matchups and for you putting me and ...\u201d Izuku swallows roughly, words coming out in a mix of stuttering and half finished sentences as he tries not to  shake, \u201cI know ... t-teamwork is  important  ... b-b-but can you, can  we, c-could \u2026\u201d\nIzuku trails off, his mouth and throat working but his voice gets trapped somewhere he can\u2019t quite reach it.\n\u201cKid,\u201d Aizawa sighs just a bit, obviously exasperated and Izuku has to bite back his instinctive flinch, \u201cwhat\u2019s this about?\u201d\nIzuku pauses, swallows again, and gathers as much determination and grit as he can get his mental hands on.\n\u201cCan you  please give Kacchan a different partner?\u201d\u00a0 Izuku finally manages to get the question out.\u00a0 \u201cH-We can\u2019t work together.\u00a0 Not for this exam.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long moment of silence and when Izuku finally manages to look up again he can\u2019t help but blanch just a bit at the disappointment that\u2019s so blatantly plain in Aizawa-sensei\u2019s expression then.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a half mind to fail you right here,\u201d Aizawa tells him, voice that dangerous sort of soft it gets when someone makes a mistake he absolutely can\u2019t abide by.\nIzuku  hates being on the receiving end of it.\n\u201cYou said you know teamwork is important, right Midoriya?\u201d Aizawa keeps going, something almost frustrated lurking in the corners of his mouth.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work with all kinds of heroes if you make it pro, no matter what your personal relationship is with them.\u00a0 So this rivalry between you and Bakugou?\u00a0 You need to learn to work with or around it because if you don\u2019t and you fail this exam \u2026 I might have to reevaluate your  potential.\u00a0 And it might not be just the summer camp you end up missing.\u201d\nIzuku doesn\u2019t say anything else.\nInstead he just turns his face to the side as he folds down in on himself a bit more, bobs his head in a shallow nodding bow, and slinks away back towards where Todoroki has been watching him.\nHis friend doesn\u2019t say anything to him, just brushes their shoulders together in a move so subtle Izuku almost doesn\u2019t feel it given how deep into his own head he\u2019s managed to sink.\nHe should have kept his mouth shut.\nAsking a teacher for help had, once again, done nothing but make things  worse.\nJust like it always has for him.\u00a0\n~~~\nIzuku chases after Kacchan, stays right on his heels as they both sprint through the gate and into the mock city.\n\u201cK-Kacchan,\u201d Izuku calls out to his teammate. \u201cW-We need to make a plan or something.\u00a0 It\u2019s All Might so maybe we should just run \u2018cause th-there\u2019s no way we can fight him.\u00a0 It\u2019s  All Might.\u201d\nThe hit to the face isn\u2019t a surprise really.\nA part of Izuku was even expecting it.\nWas waiting to feel that familiar burning crackle against his skin, the long familiar scent of burnt caramel flooding his senses as pain ripples out across his face like spider web fractures in a foundation.\nWhat is a surprise is the way that something in his mind just \u2026\n Shatters.\nIzuku greys out around the edges.\nSomething inside of him takes a step back and to the left until he\u2019s almost standing outside of his own body and watching the world pass by around him.\nIt\u2019s a feeling Izuku hasn\u2019t had in a long time now.\nBut it\u2019s still one he  knows.\n~~~\nIzuku doesn\u2019t really remember the rest of the exam.\nIs only aware of it in a vague sort of way as his body moves and fights and runs and hurts all without his real consent or input.\nIzuku gets up.\nHe runs.\nThere\u2019s  wind  and  fire, there\u2019s fists and feet and  screaming.\nThe pop crackle pop of explosions.\nHe gets back up, pushes himself up and away from metal and concrete and shattered glass.\nHe keeps running.\nThat\u2019s something he\u2019s always known how to do.\n~~~\nPop.\n\n Coward. Coward.\u00a0 \n\nCrackle. \n\n Useless fucking coward.\u00a0 All you ever do is run.\u00a0 \n\nPop. \n\n Stand still and take it. \n\n~~~\nThey win.\nSomehow, despite everything and against all odds, they  win.\nThey win but Kacchan is still so  angry.\nIs still so pissed and  vicious about something Izuku\u2019s done or not done or, maybe, just at Izuku existing in his general vicinity.\nIzuku isn\u2019t really sure which it is.\nAll of the above more than likely.\nIzuku just lets him scream, lets him threaten and curse at him, lets him pop off his quirk in his face like he\u2019s been doing since they were four and Izuku stopped being a real person in Kacchan\u2019s eyes.\nIzuku just stands there and  takes it  even after they\u2019re back in the viewing room with the others and Kacchan still hasn\u2019t calmed all the way down.\nAizawa gives him a shallow nod, All Might says something that, for once, Izuku doesn\u2019t actually pay attention to.\nUraraka and Iida smile and talk.\nTodoroki stands at his side, a silent but steady presence.\nIzuku just \u2026\n Drifts.\n~~~\nLater, once they\u2019ve all filed back onto the bus and ridden back to the main campus, Izuku still finds himself covered in that familiar grey haze.\nStill finds himself standing just beside his own body and watching everything pass him by.\nIn the end Izuku sits there on the bus, cheek, back, head, and  heart all aching, for the longest time.\nHe stays there long after everyone else has already cleared out except for him and Todoroki who\u2019d waved Iida and Uraraka away and then stayed sitting silently in the seat beside him.\nIzuku sits and  exists and doesn\u2019t do much else but those two things.\nTodoroki drifts out of the bus somewhere around the two hour mark with one last, lingering look at Izuku.\nBut still, Izuku just stays.\nSunset comes, the bus is awash in fiery reds and oranges that make Izuku uncomfortable for some reason he can\u2019t exactly place.\nBody aching in a way he almost registers, head stuffed full of cotton and vision grey around the edges, Izuku finally gets up.\nHe leaves.\nNot all of him walks away.\n~~~\nIzuku\u2019s been a patchwork person for as long as he can remember.\nFractures and scars sewed together with tears and apologies, held together by a thin thread of hope and built on a shaky base of  please I just want to be a hero I just want to help let me help please.\nBut ...\nAll threads fray eventually.\nAll bases under heavy stress break down.\nFatigue fractures spreading outwards like spider webs.\n~~~\nRecovery Girl scolds him again, tells him she\u2019s only going to heal him up after his normal ridiculous recklessness because the burn and the fractures in his cheek and jaw would make it difficult for him to eat.\u00a0 Because the dislocated shoulder can\u2019t be left alone.\nThe bruises will have to heal naturally because she swears, yet again, that she won\u2019t keep doing this, won\u2019t  enable him and his reckless, self destructive tendencies.\nIzuku just nods, shrugs, and walks away.\nSchool nurses have never liked Izuku much, have always gotten exasperated with his injuries and tired of seeing him after a few weeks into each new school year.\u00a0 To her credit Recovery Girl has lasted longer than most.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter either way.\nIzuku got used to patching himself up a long time ago.\u00a0 The few months he\u2019s had in UA haven\u2019t erased all of his hardwon and long perfected first aid skills.\nHe can save Recovery Girl\u2019s remaining scraps of goodwill for anything too extensive to handle on his own.\nEither way he\u2019ll get by.\nLike he always has.\n~~~\nLife becomes a collection of actions for Izuku in the days after the exam.\u00a0 Becomes a series of  tasks  instead of  experiences.\nIt goes from the routine he\u2019d slowly, cautiously,  hopefully, settled into back to the almost rhythmic sort of flow that used to be all that got him through his day to day life growing up.\nIt becomes:\nWake up. Train. Eat. Go to class. Smile. Nod. Train. Hurt. Sit. Stand. Smile. Train. Sleep. Wake up gasping alone in his room, chest heaving and throat sore from nightmares memories he can\u2019t won\u2019t remember.\u00a0\nRepeat. Repeat.  Repeat.\nIzuku  exists.\nHe doesn't do much else.\n~~~\nSometimes, in his clearer, more present moments, Izuku thinks about his last year of elementary school.\nOr, to be more accurate, he thinks about the fact that he doesn't really remember most of it.\nHe\u2019s got the scars to prove that it had  happened but ...\nHe'd existed then too, instead of living.\nIzuku had hoped, had  dreamed, that UA would be different.\u00a0 That this school full of heroes and hero hopefuls and the best and brightest Japan had to offer would be  better.\nAnd for a while it had been.\nAnd in some ways it still is.\n But \u2026\nIzuku should have known better than to get his hopes up too high.\nGood things rarely last.\nAnd some things never change.\n~~~\nA thought that Izuku would have never dreamed he\u2019d have begins to take shape in the back of his mind.\nAnd, despite the way it feels almost like blasphemy, Izuku can\u2019t shake it completely off.\n~~~\nTodoroki stops him one day in the locker room after training, keeps him behind as the others get dressed and head off towards the dorms and dinner.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to help you,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice is calm and even but Izuku sees what looks a lot like worry in his mismatched eyes.\u00a0 \u201cNot like how you helped me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku tells him absently, the same reassurance he\u2019s been saying since he was four, five, eight, thirteen years old.\nThe same thing he\u2019s always told his mom, the same thing he\u2019d told Uraraka and Iida only the day before.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Todoroki disagrees.\u00a0 \u201cThe others might not see it but I can.\u00a0 That look in your eyes \u2026\u201d\nThere\u2019s an understanding in Todoroki\u2019s voice, in the line of his shoulders, a  knowing in the set of his mouth.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s really \u2026  grey, isn\u2019t it Todoroki-kun?\u201d Izuku asks almost absently as he reaches down to pick up his uniform shirt.\nA cool hand stops him as fingertips trace over the collection of starbursts that litter the slope of his shoulder, spilling down and over his collarbone.\n\u201cMine used to be,\u201d Todoroki murmurs after a long, quiet moment.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you fix it?\u201d Izuku asks the question softly, aware but not, mind still half way floating somewhere static and  dull.\n\u201cI  didn\u2019t,\u201d Todoroki tells him just as softly.\n~~~\nIzuku\u2019s been running for so long now.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to run anymore.\nDoesn\u2019t want to leave some of the things he\u2019s finally found behind.\nAnd  yet ...\n~~~\nNo one\u2019s expecting the way Todoroki lashes out that evening.\nThe class is gathered in the dorm\u2019s common room, dinner cooking in the kitchen and laughter heavy in the air.\nIzuku sits curled up in the corner where Todoroki had put him earlier, notebook in hand and eyes trained out the window, with Todoroki himself a warm line of solidarity at his side.\u00a0 Iida and Uraraka are settled on the love seat close to them, Tsuyu at Uraraka\u2019s feet while she braids her hair and Iida watches with his special brand of intensity.\nEverything is quiet and calm for the most part. But then Kaminari\u2019s bray of laughter rings out across the room and a familiar pop crackle pop  cuts through the air.\nIzuku  flinches.\nTodoroki\u2019s moving in the next moment.\nHe flows up and off of the couch from beside Izuku and there\u2019s barely enough time to blink before spikes of ice are surging across the common room.\nThe attack sends Kacchan tumbling backwards from where he\u2019d been hovering over Kaminari with a shout.\u00a0 He hits the ground and rolls back up and onto his feet with a snarl even as he surges forwards to attack.\nTodoroki, unphased, meets him halfway.\nAnd this time, unlike at the Sports Festival, he does it with both his ice and his fire in hand.\nThe window behind Kacchan shatters and Izuku can only watch as he goes flying.\nSomeone  screams.\nOutside the dorm Kacchan  roars.\n~~~\nAizawa-sensei comes moments later, hair raised, eyes burning, and utterly furious.\nKacchan has to be full body restrained.\nTodoroki just stands there passively with a loop of Aizawa\u2019s capture scarf settled firmly around his waist.\nEveryone else is confused and upset and a few even sound scared.\nIzuku just looks back at Todoroki who\u2019s been staring at him the entire time with something that feels almost like awe brewing to life inside of him, filtering in through the static and the haze he\u2019s been living in.\nRight before he\u2019s dragged out of the dorm by Aizawa, Izuku\u2019s sure he sees Todoroki  smile.\n~~~\nTodoroki gets an entire week of house arrest, a month of detention, and an official warning.\u00a0 He\u2019ll also be stuck with the remedial classes during the training camp.\nWhenever anyone, even the teachers, asks him  why he just shrugs and turns away.\nIzuku seems to be the only one who notices the way Todoroki always turns to look at him.\nIt makes him feel just a bit more awake and aware.\nMakes him feel just a bit more  real.\n~~~\nSometimes, when the dorm is quiet and dark and his body feels  real again for at least a little while, Izuku heads outside.\nHe'll slip out of his dorm window, feet bare so he can  feel  the coolness of night dew on the grass, and he'll just walk the small courtyard garden behind the dorm.\nBack and forth, around and around, through the flowers and the small class vegetable plot Iida and Yaomomo had gotten permission for them to make.\nIzuku waits, sort of absently and without really caring, to get in trouble for his night time activities, but no one ever calls him on it. He never gets reprimanded for breaking curfew or anything of the like.\nNo one says anything.\nSo either Nezu, who Izuku is sure probably  knows, is content to leave him be or he\u2019s been wrong about the level of surveillance the dorms are actually under all of the time and no one actually knows about his walks.\nBoth options are worthy of deeper thought but, either way, Izuku doesn't stop sneaking out.\nSometimes Todoroki even comes out onto his balcony despite how late it is.\u00a0 Even when he\u2019s on house arrest he\u2019ll still come out to sit on the railing of his balcony like a silent sort of reassurance.\nSometimes Izuku will hop up to sit on the railing beside him, their shoulders pressed together and hands just brushing.\n~~~\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t go to UA anymore,\u201d Izuku asks one night when the stars and his mind are both clear and bright and everyone but the two of them have all long since gone to sleep, \u201cif I went to a different school, would you still be my friend?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d probably just transfer with you,\u201d Todoroki tells him simply with a small, unconcerned shrug.\nIzuku goes still.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku whispers the question out through a throat gone tight with emotion.\n\u201cShiketsu is a good school,\" Todoroki offers blandly.\u00a0 \"It's prestigious in its own right, and they\u2019d take you in on scholarship after your showing in the Sports Festival if All Might doesn\u2019t want to pay for your transfer.\"\nIzuku stares up at him, eyes wide and heart pounding.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be heroes no matter what, Izuku,\u201d Todoroki tells him like it\u2019s obvious, like it\u2019s a universal law, like the sound of his first name isn\u2019t enough to make something inside of Izuku  shake.\u00a0 \u201cUA isn\u2019t the only place to do that and if you change schools then I\u2019d rather be  there  with you than  here  without you.\u00a0 Besides, even if Endeavor won\u2019t pay for tuition if I transfer then I\u2019ll apply for their scholarship too.\u00a0 They\u2019d probably jump at the chance to steal the son of the Number 2 hero from UA.\u201d\nIzuku absorbs that, swallows as best he can through the tightness in his throat.\u00a0 The sigh he gives out is shaky at best.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku murmurs, just a bit dazed as tears gather at the corners of his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cI-I\u2019d rather be with you too, S-Shouto.\u201d\nHis hand shakes as he slides it across the railing and tentatively touches his fingertips to the back of Shouto\u2019s.\nShouto just shifts his hand until their fingers are tangled together.\nHis warmth feels soothing against Izuku's scars.\nAnd, for the first time in what feels like forever, Izuku  breathes.\nIzuku resettles into his body in bits and pieces.\n \u2018Greying out\u2019  as Izuku has always called this thing that happens to him, because some part of him shies away from the proper name for what happens to him and from what it implies about him and his  life, has always been equal parts exhausting and dream-like.\nIt\u2019s a strange state of being, living in half measures.\u00a0 It\u2019s  draining, that long familiar feeling of being half aware and half drifting somewhere just left of where he knows he should be.\nOf being breathless and breathing, sleeping and awake, of being  greyed out  everywhere and yet only around select edges all at the same time.\nRegaining his color, resettling into his body, has always  hurt, has always left Izuku feeling raw and  wounded and ready to shake apart in the aftermath.\nBut this time \u2026\nThis time things aren\u2019t miraculously perfect but they are ...  different.\nThis time instead of snapping harshly, painfully, back into place as he always has in the past, Izuku resettles  slowly.\nBit by bit.\nAnd, tucked away in that carefully shielded part of himself that\u2019s always moving, always thinking and calculating and  analyzing, Izuku  knows  that it\u2019s because Shouto  helps.\nHaving Shouto around, having him standing at his side or hovering just at his shoulder as he always seems to be these days, helps a lot more than Izuku had ever thought possible.\nHelps more than anything or anyone Izuku\u2019s ever had or known or thought of before.\nWhen they sit together at lunch Shouto presses their knees together beneath the table and suddenly Izuku can  taste  what he\u2019s eating again.\u00a0 Food becomes  food again instead of tasteless mush he\u2019s obligated to consume to keep his body moving.\nWhen they\u2019re assigned paired classwork or during training blocks Shouto partners up with him at every given opportunity.\u00a0 He moves so fast to claim the spot beside Izuku and then deadeye stares at anyone who gets too close.\u00a0 Eventually the rest of the class stops asking altogether, seeming to accept that Izuku\u2019s been declared off limits.\nEither way Shouto never falters and Izuku never protests. Instead Shouto just pulls him to the side and Izuku goes willingly, content to be led by someone he  knows won\u2019t hurt him.\u00a0 Shouto presses the both of them into the corner of the classroom or whatever training yard or gym they\u2019re currently using, tucks the both of them as far from the others as possible.\nInstead of feeling crowded or isolated Izuku finds that he can actually concentrate, can actually remember and  experience things when it\u2019s Shouto working at his side, Shouto standing between him and everyone else.\nShouto, quiet and calm but always  there, gives Izuku room to breathe.\nFor the first time in his life Izuku has someone he doesn\u2019t have to emotionally or physically hide from, has someone he doesn\u2019t have to pretend for.\nFor the first time since he stopped being a person and started being a  thing  to the world at large, Izuku has someone beside him who allows him to simply \u2026  be.\nSomehow that acceptance makes everything so much  smoother.\nIzuku knows it might just be proof that he\u2019s weak, the need to have Shouto with him in order to  be again, knows he should be trying to do all of this on his own, but \u2026\nAll he really feels is  protected.\nIzuku\u2019s never really been protected before, not like this, not from anything that wasn\u2019t certain death.\nAnd even then it wasn\u2019t like  this.\nNothing in Izuku\u2019s life has ever felt like this.\n Shouto is unlike anyone Izuku\u2019s ever had in his life before.\n~~~\nBut, just as Izuku learned when he was four, five, nine, fourteen years old and standing on the edge of a building, good things never last.\nAnd, despite all his years of experience and no matter how much he might wish otherwise, Izuku can only run so fast.\nEventually the things that are chasing him have a tendency to catch up.\n~~~\nHero schools don\u2019t operate on the standard school schedule so even though they\u2019ve had their final exams already, training and certain classes don\u2019t actually  stop.\nInstead things shift a bit more towards the physical end of the spectrum with book classes being phased out until the next semester officially begins.\u00a0 More group and specialized training slots into their places as the time until the training camp slowly clicks down.\nIzuku knows what\u2019s going to happen long before it does.\nIt\u2019s easy to calculate the odds, to watch as the rest of the class is paired off and his options whittle down bit by bit.\nSo, by the time it happens, Izuku\u2019s not even close to surprised.\n\u201cFinal match up for the day will be young Midoriya and young Bakugou,\u201d All Might announces cheerfully, smile bright and hands resting on his hips.\nThis time Izuku doesn\u2019t even bother to glance at Aizawa who\u2019s leaning against the wall overseeing things.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t bother to look at any of his other classmates either.\nInstead he just stares up at Shouto with something thin and  aching stirring to life inside of his chest.\nHe\u2019s been getting better, been  settling, bit by bit every single day, but now \u2026\nNow he\u2019s right back where he started, right back where he always seems to end up no matter the circumstances.\nFacing off against Kacchan.\nBecause it seems as if that\u2019s  exactly where everything and everyone in his life but Shouto wants Izuku to be.\nAnd Izuku already knows that nothing he says to any of the teachers will be enough to get him out of it.\n\u201cI can stop it,\u201d Shouto offers, his hand wrapping around Izuku\u2019s, seemingly uncaring that anyone could see the way their fingers tangled together if they bothered to look.\u00a0 \u201cSay the word and I\u2019ll  break him.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the kind of offer, the kind of fierce protection and unwavering support, that no one else has ever really extended to Izuku.\nShouto is ready and willing to interfere with the class, to get in trouble yet again with even harsher consequences.\u00a0 Is ready to  fight all to make sure that Izuku can walk away from this moment unscathed and avoid yet another brawl with Kacchan.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku says softly, fingers squeezing around Shouto\u2019s as he does his best to breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t an exam where Izuku\u2019s future depends on him somehow working with Kacchan as a team.\u00a0 This is just training.\u00a0 It\u2019s just another class, just another fight, another battle, another familiar bit of pain and fear and exhaustion waiting to happen.\nIzuku\u2019s been doing this in one form or another for  years.\nHe can handle it.\nBut the fact that Shouto offered? Was willing to put himself in the line of fire from multiple directions all for Izuku?\nIt means more to Izuku than he can say.\n~~~\nLater, once it\u2019s done and training is over and everyone else has walked off laughing and groaning and  happy  with only a few scrapes and light bruises to show for the day, Shouto sits with Izuku inside the now quiet locker room.\nIzuku\u2019s body aches and exhaustion tugs at the edges of his senses, but he\u2019s  present.\nSomehow, someway, he\u2019s still  aware.\nBut, given the fact that Shouto hasn\u2019t left his side unless absolutely necessary, maybe it\u2019s not that much of a surprise.\n\u201cYou should see Recovery Girl,\u201d Shouto murmurs from beside him, voice a deliberate sort of soft and even.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t have to look up to know that Shouto\u2019s eyes are locked on the vicious bruises that are already blooming across Izuku\u2019s ribs.\nHe can feel the weight of his gaze, can feel Shouto\u2019s eyes like a physical touch as they glance over his scared shoulders, at the warped bits of skin on his upper arms, at the small burn brushing across the arc of his left cheek.\nTraining or not, supervised by the teachers or not, Kacchan hadn\u2019t pulled any of his punches.\nAnd why would he when restraint, especially against Izuku, has never been something high on his list of priorities?\nNeedless to say the temperature in the locker room had dropped just a bit as soon as Izuku had peeled off his seared and tattered jumpsuit and tossed it down onto the bench.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Izuku tells him just as quietly because even if Shouto doesn\u2019t know Izuku still remembers Recovery Girl\u2019s warnings.\nBruised ribs and a few burns aren\u2019t enough to risk irritating her over.\nBetter to save that for something bigger, for something Izuku hasn\u2019t been dealing with his entire life.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Shouto agrees.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t ask questions, doesn\u2019t press Izuku for whys or try to convince him, so Izuku doesn\u2019t say anything else on the matter, doesn\u2019t feel that urgent need to explain himself.\nInstead Shouto just reaches over and lays a cold hand against Izuku\u2019s bruised ribs, delicate frost spiraling out across his fever hot skin.\nThe relief is instant but it\u2019s the wordless acceptance that Shouto gives him that means more.\nSo Izuku lets himself list just a bit to the side, lets himself sway just a bit further into Shouto\u2019s space until his temple is resting against the taller boy\u2019s shoulder.\nAnd Shouto, quiet and solid and  there, lets him.\nThey sit there together in silence for the longest time.\n~~~\n\u201cYou always get hurt,\u201d Shouto says softly just before they go their separate ways for the night.\u00a0 \u201cWorse than any of us.\u201d\nIzuku doesn\u2019t know what to say to that so he just stands there, his back pressed against his dorm room door as Shouto crowds close to his front.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Izuku knows it\u2019s not, he\u2019s had worse in the past.\u00a0 The final exam for example had been way worse.\u00a0 At least this time Izuku knows that nothing is actually  broken or dislocated.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Shouto presses.\u00a0 \u201cYou just can\u2019t see it like you should.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence.\n\u201cI was serious,\u201d Shouto finally says.\u00a0 \u201cAbout leaving, about Shiketsu.\u00a0 About all of it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll go with you.\u00a0 We can do this Izuku.\u00a0 We can be heroes,  together, somewhere else.\u00a0 Somewhere safer for you.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s heart skips a beat.\nHe\u2019s been doing his best to push that thought, that possible path, down and away since he\u2019d started to really slot himself back into his body again.\u00a0 Has been trying to make himself believe that it was just a thought brought on by the stale greyness that had consumed him.\nIt hasn\u2019t been working but Izuku\u2019s kept trying.\n\u201cS-Shouto,\u201d Izuku whispers, just a bit lost and reeling like he always is every time he allows himself to really think about leaving UA.\u00a0\n\u201cHow would you feel if it was Iida or Uraraka getting hurt all of the time?\u00a0 If it was  me?\u201d Shouto asks him, something steady and almost understanding in his expression.\u00a0 \u201cHow did you feel when you found out about Endeavour and everything else?\u00a0 How do you think it feels for me to see you like this, over and over again because no one else seems to see the problem?\u201d\nShouto leans down close enough to press their foreheads together, close enough that they\u2019re breathing each other\u2019s air.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not heroes yet Izuku,\u201d Shouto tells him just a bit raggedly as he presses even further into Izuku\u2019s space somehow.\u00a0 \u201cAnd even with the villain attacks it\u2019s not \u2026 it\u2019s not supposed to be like  this.\u00a0 UA was supposed to be  different.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a wealth of unspoken information in that statement, nuance and layers that they\u2019re both aware of but don\u2019t have to actually speak about at the moment.\nUA was supposed to be different for both of them in a lot of ways.\nAnd it has been and yet ...\nEyes slipping closed, Izuku basks in that closeness, in the serenity and steady sort of  realness that comes hand in hand with being near Shouto.\nBut all the while his mind click, click, clicks  away.\n~~~\nLater, when Izuku\u2019s in his room with the plastic tote that doubles as his first aid kit open on his bed beside him, he finds himself grinding to a complete halt with Shouto\u2019s words echoing in his head again.\n\n \u2018What if it was Iida or Uraraka? What if it was me?\u2019 \n\nIzuku remembers the fierce and protective rage he\u2019d felt for Iida in that alley.\u00a0 Remembers his determination to save Uraraka at the entrance exam in part because it was the right thing to do and because she\u2019d been the first person his age to be even passingly nice to him in  so long.\nRemembers the emotions that had seared him soul deep at the revelation of just what Shouto has had to deal with for so many years from someone who should have kept him safe on more than one level.\u00a0 The way not even his desire to make All Might proud had been strong enough to keep him from doing whatever he could to  help.\nIzuku remembers the way he\u2019d thrown himself into the line of fire for each of them, breaking his body into bits and pieces over and over to keep them safe, to help them out of their own personal darkness.\nHe remembers how much it had hurt him to see them in danger or in pain, just like it always hurts him on some level every time someone in 1-A ends up in a bad position.\nBurn cream in one hand and sterile gauze in the other, Izuku goes still as the truth spikes through him, sharp and merciless and sounding just a bit too much like Shouto\u2019s voice in the back of his head.\nFor a moment Izuku just  looks at the medical supplies he\u2019s holding, looks at the tote that he\u2019d spent most of his allowances over the years to get and keep stocked and hidden away from his mom.\nIzuku  looks  and he  thinks  and he  imagines.\nFor a too long moment Izuku feels as if he can\u2019t breathe through the thick rush of no not them never them not again it\u2019s not right that claws its way to life inside of him.\nIzuku\u2019s head fills overfull, his heart feels shredded and the tears that prickle his eyes feel both molten hot and blistering cold.\nBut in that moment Izuku thinks he  finally understands exactly what Shouto\u2019s been trying to tell him.\n~~~\nWith the entirety of his focus bent in one direction, it only takes Izuku a few hours to get everything together for both Shouto and himself.\nTransfers between hero schools are unusual but they do happen.\u00a0 The paperwork, requirements, and forms are out there and easily found even if it\u2019s absolutely unheard of for someone to attempt to transfer  out of UA.\nUA is, after all,  the hero school of Japan.\nPeople who make it into UA tend to stay in UA unless they have absolutely no other choice.\nIzuku had once thought he\u2019d be no different.\nUA was All Might\u2019s  alma mater  after all, it was  the hero school in Japan, staffed with and attended by the best of the best and it had been Izuku\u2019s dream for as long as he could remember.\nBut Shouto is  right  and Izuku is so  tired.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore.\nDoesn\u2019t want to stay stuck in this same holding pattern of fear and pain and helpless anxiety he\u2019s been trapped in since he was five years old.\nIzuku wants to learn, wants to change and grow and finally be free to just  be.\nAnd as much as it hurts and aches and burns Izuku doesn\u2019t think he can do any of that here, not really.\u00a0 He can\u2019t do any of those things to the fullest extent possible with Kacchan looming over him like a guillotine, hovering on the sidelines of his life like a bomb with a hair trigger.\nWhatever growth he\u2019d achieve in the long run would be \u2026  stunted.\nSo Izuku doesn\u2019t want to just  endure  school and training for another two years.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t want to study and train and fight during school hours only to have to go back to the dorms afterwards, to the safe place that will never really be  safe for him.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to be forced to live in the same building as someone ready to beat him down with fists and feet and searing explosions at the drop of a hat, at the barest hint of any real or imaginary slight.\nSomething has to give and, for the first time in his life, Izuku\u2019s not ashamed to admit that, this time, it\u2019s going to be him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Izuku says softly as he steps up to Shouto\u2019s side, a thick folder tucked neatly beneath his arm and another held out in Shouto\u2019s direction.\u00a0 \u201cDid some research last night, i-if you\u2019re still serious?\u201d\nShouto takes the folder and flips it open to see what\u2019s inside.\nIzuku can tell the moment he realizes just what he\u2019s looking at.\u00a0\nTransfer papers, scholarship applications, permission slips, and a host of other forms that need to be filled out if they\u2019re really going to do this.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Shouto agrees immediately, mouth turned up just a bit at the corners as he closes the folder and reaches out to grab Izuku\u2019s hand in his free one.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku nods, heart pounding but his resolve  firm  as he twines his battered fingers with Shouto\u2019s.\u00a0 He is  present  and  aware  and  real and they are doing this.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d\nLet Kacchan keep UA just like he\u2019s always wanted.\nIzuku\u2019s found something more important.\nHe\u2019s going to be a  hero, side by side with Shouto, no matter what."
