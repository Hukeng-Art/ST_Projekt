    "text": "Steve doesn't even notice at first, is the thing.\nHe tells himself that it\u2019s understandable after the fact, that he's had a hard couple of years, what with being unfrozen and then fighting gods and monsters and corrupt government agencies, but the truth is he might not have seen what was going on even before all that happened, because there are some things he\u2019s just not very observant about.\nSam is the one who eventually points it out to him, because Sam is the kind of guy who notices these things.\n\"Huh,\" he says, looking around the entryway. \"Did you get a maid or something?\"\nSteve frowns up at him from where he's untying his shoelaces. \"What? No.\" \u00a0Natasha had suggested that he hire a maid once, having seen how quickly his apartment turns into a disaster area when he's alone, but Steve had balked at the idea. He used to live with people who worked as cleaners and maids\u2014he doesn't think he'd be able to hire one, no matter how bad things get.\nSam raises his eyebrows. \"Okay. So you finally started cleaning, then? I have to admit, I'm impressed. I thought I'd come over one night and find you buried under your own trash.\"\nWhich is deeply unfair. Steve is not a disgusting garbage monster, Sam is just freakishly tidy. Steve looks around and realizes that the laundry basket is no longer sitting on the couch, the cups crowding the living room table have all disappeared, and the carpet in the hall looks suspiciously as though it has been vacuumed. And it smells nice, light and clean and slightly chemical.\n\"I'm pretty sure I didn't do that,\" he says finally.\nSam shakes his head. \"You're pretty sure? You don't know?\"\n\"Well, who else\u2014Stark. Of course.\u00a0 He must have hired somebody for me.\u00a0 Probably thought he was doing me a favour.\"\u00a0 He thinks about how much it must have cost him and tries to suppress a wince.\u00a0 He forgets sometimes that he knows rich people now.\nSam shakes his head again, looking more amused than baffled now.\u00a0 \"You honestly think Tony Stark would do something like this without telling you?\u00a0 Loudly and repeatedly?\" He looks around again.\u00a0 \"Either you've got elves or you've gotta start looking closer to home.\"\nIt takes him a while even after that.\u00a0 He forgets sometimes that he doesn't live alone anymore.\nHe asks Bucky about it a few nights later, when they're both in the living room.\u00a0 The television is on, because Steve's working his way alphabetically through Tony's very long list of \"Shows Cap Has to Watch So He Stops Feeling Like a Sad Grandpa.\"\u00a0 He hates that list, but since he's started to go through it he\u00a0does\u00a0feel like less of a sad grandpa.\u00a0 He's on\u00a0The Golden Girls\u00a0now, which he likes mostly because he knows that Peggy liked it, back in the day.\nBucky is curled up against the arm of the couch, dressed in a pair of Steve's old sweats.\u00a0 He has clothes of his own\u2014Steve took him out shopping months ago, and then Clint took him out re-shopping after he saw the things he'd bought with Steve because \u201cnot everyone loves khakis as much as you, Steve, Jesus\u201d\u2014but he tends to wear Steve's things instead, even though the sleeves trail over his hands and the pants hang too loose and too long.\u00a0 His feet are bare.\u00a0 He's watching the television, occasionally chuckling a little when Estelle Getty cracks wise.\n\"Bucky?\"\nHe turns his face to Steve's then, no hesitating, not like when Steve had first brought him home and he had to think carefully about the name every time he answered to it.\u00a0 He looks at him wordlessly, waiting for him to continue.\n\"Have you been, uh.\"\u00a0 Steve shifts a little, unsure of how exactly to have this talk.\u00a0 \"Cleaning?\u00a0 The apartment, I mean?\"\nNo hesitation again.\u00a0 Just a quick nod, and then, \"Yeah,\" Bucky says. \u00a0\u00a0His voice is still hoarse and too quiet, one of the most tangible reminders of all the years he didn't use it. \"A few times.\u00a0 Just while you were out.\"\nThere's nothing there, no tone or expression to clue Steve in to what he's thinking.\u00a0 He lets it sit for a few seconds before going on.\n\"Why?\"\nA slight crease appears between Bucky's brows.\u00a0 He looks at Steve for a moment as though he thinks the question might be a trick.\u00a0 \"Because it was messy?\" he offers at last.\u00a0 \"And because I know how long it takes for you to notice things like that?\" He does have a point there.\u00a0 Military training aside, when left to his own devices Steve tends to forget that he lives in a pig sty. \"I mean, I'm not really doing anything all day. Might as well make myself useful, right?\"\nThere had been a day, not too long after Bucky had come to live with him, when Steve had asked him to join the Avengers, against the wishes of... well, pretty much everyone except Sam and Natasha, who'd been there for his recovery and knew.\u00a0 He's not Natasha, he can't talk people into jumping off cliffs and thinking it was their idea\u2014he\u2019s not even Tony, who people seem to listen to out of sheer fascination\u2014but he can be pretty convincing when he wants to be, he thinks, when he believes in what he's saying. (And he had.) He'd explained what Bucky could do to help people, how he could make a difference in the world, who he could save and protect by using his skills to be a shield\u00a0instead of a weapon. Bucky had heard him out, still and patient like he was waiting for a clear shot, and then said \"No.\" Nothing else. Just \"no.\" It was so absolute that Steve had never asked him again.\nMaybe it had been a mistake to even ask.\n\"You don't have to, you know,\" he says.\u00a0 The crease between Bucky's eyes deepens.\n\"I know,\" he replies, sounding so honestly confused that Steve feels compelled to continue.\n\"I don't want you to feel like you have to earn your keep,\" he elaborates.\u00a0 \"You're my friend.\u00a0 I want you here no matter what-\"\nBucky's face shuts down completely, cutting him off.\n\"Steve,\" he says, his voice quiet and calm. Steve remembers that tone. It's always been his cue to shut up for a few minutes and listen.\u00a0 \"You ever think that maybe I want to earn my keep?\"\nSteve has not thought about that.\u00a0 Bucky seems to read this on his face.\u00a0 He sighs, carding a hand through the length of his hair.\n\"It kills me that I can't help you,\" he says.\u00a0 It sounds like he's forcing the words out from between his teeth.\u00a0 \"You can do so many things I can't now. \u00a0You're helping people, you're saving the world every other damn day.\u00a0 And I-I've thought about it, coming with you, I have, but I can't. You've seen me when we even watch movies with guns or loud noises in them, right? I get too twitchy.\u00a0 I get scared. I can't use what HYDRA did to me like you can use what Erskine gave you. But this...\u201d He waves his hand at the apartment, which is clean and tidy and smells like Lemon Pledge. \"I can do this. I like it. I want to feel useful. I don't want to be a-a drain, or a pet-\"\n\"You're not!\" Steve blurts, even though he'd promised himself he wouldn't interrupt, because the thought of Bucky thinking that kills him.\u00a0\n\"Then let me have this,\" Bucky says.\u00a0 He sounds almost pleading. \u00a0\"Please. I want\u2014I need to know I can be good at things, okay?\"\nSteve remembers the tiny apartment they'd rented after his mother had passed, how rarely he was able to help with rent.\u00a0 He'd been either too sick to work or too weak from having been sick to find work most of the time, and every odd job he'd been able to find\u2014sign painting, paper-selling, even sweeping doorsteps\u2014had felt like the world.\u00a0 He'd hated spending all of his time in bed, thinking about Bucky out there struggling to make ends meet while he waited for him to come home.\nHe smiles.\u00a0 It wobbles.\u00a0 \"Never thought I'd see the day when you argued for the right to clean the place,\" he says, and his voice, at least, is steady.\nBucky's smile back is small, but sincere. \u00a0\"Yeah, well, you never used to leave your dirty socks lying around so damn much.\"\n\"Jerk.\"\nThat earns him a bigger, brighter smile, the kind that makes him ache a little bit.\u00a0 He smiles less than he used to now, and every time he does Steve feels victorious, even if he\u2019s not the cause.\u00a0 \"Punk,\u201d he says, and Steve knows it\u2019s going to be okay.\nThey don't talk much more that night.\u00a0 Bucky sits pressed against the arm of the couch, his bare toes just brushing Steve's thigh.\n\u201cElves, man,\u201d Sam says the next time he comes over.\u00a0 His mouth twitches a little, his eyes landing on Bucky curled up in one of Steve\u2019s battered wing chairs, reading.\u00a0 \u201cOr maybe just one.\u201d\n***\nMonsters happen a few weeks later, crawling out of the New York sewer system like a bad joke.\u00a0 They keep him out of the apartment for a few days\u2014there's the planning, and then the fighting, and then what feels like an endless round of press conferences in which he has to explain to crowd after crowd of shouting journalists why half of the Manhattan Line is shut down, because apparently all the other Avengers voted him their official media liaison at some point.\u00a0\n\"It does make sense,\" Sam says as he drives him home.\u00a0 Steve's bike somehow got eaten by one of the creatures, which can apparently digest steel, and he didn't want to have to go home on foot while he's still suited up.\u00a0 He'd tried that once before and got mobbed in front of an artisanal bakery.\u00a0 He doesn't think he'd be able to manage the walk today even if that weren't the case\u2014serum or no serum, his whole body hurts.\u00a0 \"You've got that whole clean cut, all American, aw-shucks-I-cannot-tell-a-lie thing going for you, they like that.\u00a0 Besides, who else could do it?\u00a0 Bruce is too shy, Thor's logic is not like our Earth logic, Clint and Natasha hate the spotlight, and Tony's\u2026 Tony.\"\nThinking about it like that, it does make sense.\u00a0 Steve wishes it didn\u2019t.\nHe's still sore when he walks through the front door, but the worst of the pain has ebbed, replaced with a full-body ache that makes him think longingly of the days when aspirin actually worked for him.\u00a0 It takes him a minute to realize that the apartment smells different.\u00a0 Clean still, but sweet, floury, warm.\u00a0 He follows the scent to the kitchen, where Bucky is sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the oven, staring intently through the glass on its door.\n\"Hey, Buck,\" he says, bemused.\u00a0 Bucky nods but doesn't look up.\n\"How were the monsters?\" he asks.\n\"As advertised.\u00a0 Big, mean, scaly.\u00a0 A few were green.\"\u00a0 He squats next to Bucky, staring with him.\u00a0 He can't really see what's inside, since the oven light's not on, but he can make out the faint outline of something in a round pan.\u00a0 \"What have you been up to?\"\n\"Coffee cake,\" Bucky replies.\u00a0 \"One of those cooking shows was on all morning.\u00a0 I saw someone make this.\u00a0 It looked like something you'd like.\"\nSteve smiles, touched.\u00a0 Bucky glances at him sidelong, a brief little flash of the eyes, before turning back to glare at the oven door like he's trying to will the cake to bake faster.\nIt isn't that great\u2014it's a little too dense, and the crumble on top comes out burned\u2014but Steve eats it all anyway, Bucky watching him the whole time.\nCoffee cake is just the beginning.\u00a0 Bucky had never shown much of an aptitude for cooking when they were young; they'd lived on bachelor rations, beans and day-old bread and whatever they could find on the cheap, except when the old woman who lived in the apartment across the hall had taken pity on them and sent over something she'd made.\u00a0 But now he makes something new every day.\u00a0 Sweets seem to be his favourite (he makes a mean Brown Betty, Steve discovers), but he does real dinners too, shepherd's pie and beef stew and chicken dumplings with soda bread.\u00a0 It's all food Steve remembers from his childhood, heavy, Irish dishes that stick to his ribs and make him feel sleepy and content.\u00a0\nAfter a few weeks, during which Steve eats all he can and smuggles the rest out to pass off to the family three doors over, Bucky starts to move out of his comfort zone.\u00a0 There's a week when he makes nothing but complicated sauces, throwing them on top of whatever they have in the fridge.\u00a0 (Mole and refried salmon turns out to be surprisingly tasty, but even Steve can't finish the hollandaise hot dogs.)\u00a0 There\u2019s another when he sees a show about sushi and spends three days making nothing else, skeptical of its edibility even as he feeds it to Steve (\u201cyou don\u2019t even cook it, Steve, you can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s right\u201d).\u00a0 One week he makes nothing but fancy, airy desserts\u2014his flan collapses, but the others turn out fine.\u00a0 Steve finds that he likes trying to guess what kind of week it\u2019s going to be by looking in the fridge and seeing what new, strange ingredients are crowding the shelves.\u00a0 He gets pretty good at it after a while. \u00a0\nThey've never gone grocery shopping together before, really\u2014that had meant something different when they were young, and food was something you had to fight to get enough of.\u00a0 Taste hadn't mattered then.\u00a0 It hadn't mattered later either, when Bucky had first started venturing out to Whole Foods with Steve, huddled up small in an oversized hoodie and avoiding people's eyes.\u00a0 Steve had had to steer him by the elbow, gripping tighter when some loud noise or sudden movement had spooked him.\nNow he's the one being led, watching with fascination as Bucky inspects the ingredients available to him with a critical eye.\u00a0 He has to smell everything, touch everything (with his flesh hand\u2014they learn that quickly, after he accidentally bursts a tomato all over himself while trying to squeeze-test it with his metal one).\u00a0 Steve can't tell half the time what makes him nod and put something in his basket, what makes him scoff and toss it away.\u00a0 It reminds him, oddly, of watching him at target practice, the way his eyes move constantly, seeking out weak spots.\n\u00a0\"You ever thought of cooking professionally?\" Steve asks one day after he's cleaned his plate.\u00a0 \"You could, you know.\"\nBucky shakes his head.\u00a0 \"I don't want to do it for everyone,\" he replies.\u00a0 \"Just you.\"\nBeef Wellington is Bucky's Waterloo. He tries to make it three times in a row with no success\u2014the first time the pastry burns, the second time the beef is undercooked, the third time he forgets the pate and the whole thing is dust-dry and bland. Bucky doesn't try again after that, moving on to other dishes without saying a word.\u00a0 Steve thinks he must have forgotten about it.\u00a0 But a few weeks later he comes home late to the smell of beef and pastry and spices, and sees Bucky standing triumphantly in the kitchen, the table already set.\n\"I did it,\" he says, and he looks so happy that Steve forgets how tired he is, how badly he wants to lie down and sleep.\nThe Wellington is delicious, tender and flavourful, the pate soaking into the pastry just right.\u00a0 Steve's never had to fake his enthusiasm for the food Bucky makes him, even when it's bad, but he feels like he could eat this every day for the rest of his life.\nHe looks up at one point and sees Bucky watching him, his chin resting in one hand.\n\"What's wrong?\" he asks, after swallowing a huge mouthful of meat and pastry.\n\"Nothing,\" Bucky replies.\u00a0 His mouth curls slightly at the edges.\u00a0 Like paper in a fire, Steve thinks, and his fingers itch for his drawing pencils.\u00a0 \"I just like watching you eat.\"\nAnd suddenly it's 1940 again, with Bucky across from him at the wobbly card table they'd rescued from a junk heap and dragged up to their apartment, pushing his half-full plate over to him and insisting that he just isn't hungry. That same smile played on his face then, watching Steve eat, even though he knows\u2014knew then, too---that he was lying. He was hungry. They were both hungry all the time.\nBucky took care of him then, and he's taking care of him still, after everything. The thought makes Steve's breath hitch.\u00a0 He reaches out and touches Bucky's arm, the metal one, and Bucky starts a little at the pressure.\u00a0 (Pressure, he confided to Steve one night, is all he can really feel with that arm.)\n\"Buck,\" he starts, and then stops.\u00a0 How do you say thank you for all those years of someone looking out for you?\u00a0 How do you say thank you for someone caring more about you than they do about themselves?\u00a0 \"This is really good,\" he says instead, knowing that it's inadequate but not knowing how to make it better.\n\"I know,\" Bucky says, all confident and cocksure, sounding so much like the Bucky who used to turn girls' heads at the dance hall that Steve can't help but laugh and throw his napkin at him.\u00a0 Bucky catches it, looks pleased, looks away.\n***\nSteve doesn't usually enter Bucky's room without knocking.\u00a0 In the early days of his recovery being startled would set him off like nothing else, and he'd backslid that way a few times, just from Steve entering a room.\u00a0 But he seems to be better now\u2014Steve can't even remember the last time he accidentally tore a door off its hinges\u2014and so he's gotten lax about it, occasionally forgetting and just walking in without a sound.\u00a0 Which is what happens the day he goes in there to ask Bucky something and finds him hunched over a pair of knitting needles, his brow furrowed with concentration.\nIt's not the first time Steve's seen a man knitting.\u00a0 It's the twenty first century, after all, and a lot of things are fine now that weren't when he was growing up.\u00a0 But he has to admit that he's a little surprised, partly because Bucky is so engrossed in what he's doing that he doesn't seem to know he's there.\nHe coughs, hoping to alert him to his presence as gently as possible.\u00a0 \"Hey, Bucky,\" he says softly.\u00a0 Bucky looks up, his face an intensely focused mask.\u00a0 His hands don't stop moving.\u00a0 \"I\u2019m going to the store in five, you coming out?\"\nIt seems to take a minute for Bucky to process what he says.\u00a0 Then he nods, glancing back down at the tangle of yarn in his lap.\u00a0 \"Soon,\" he says.\u00a0 \"I just wanna finish this row first.\"\nSteve doesn't really know what to say to that, so he nods and lets the door fall shut.\u00a0 As he turns to walk away he hears Bucky begin to murmur, \"Knit one, purl two\u2026\"\nHe waits a few days before bringing it up, unsure of how Bucky will react.\u00a0 The cleaning and cooking were one thing.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t see how this is the same.\u00a0 When he asks over morning coffee, hesitantly, Bucky shrugs.\n\"Sam taught me,\" he replies.\u00a0 \"He said some of the guys he counsels have started doing it. Said it helps to have something to do with your hands.\"\u00a0 He holds his own hands out in front of him, gleaming metal and soft flesh.\u00a0 \"I\u2019ve got to hold back with my left, though, otherwise I rip the yarn.\"\nSteve thinks of that still, concentrated look on Bucky's face, the minute wrinkle between the eyebrows.\u00a0 \"Does it?\" he asks.\u00a0 \u201cHelp, I mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\"A little,\" he says.\u00a0 \"I can't do much yet, though. \u00a0Just straight rows.\u00a0 Sam's going to teach me to do the harder stuff later.\u201d\nThat\u2019s all he seems to want to say on the subject.\u00a0 He closes his mouth and leans over the newspaper, squinting at the funnies like he can make them actually funny through sheer force of will.\nBut that night, while Steve is watching television, Bucky plops down next to him with his needles and yarn.\n\u00a0\"What are we watching?\" he asks.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t actually look at the screen, just frowns down at what he\u2019s making.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t look like much of anything yet, although Steve is pretty sure it\u2019s blue.\nHe checks the menu.\u00a0 \"I Love Lucy,\" he reads.\u00a0 The note on the Sad Grandpa list says that he\u2019ll like this one \u201cbecause it\u2019s old.\u00a0 And you\u2019re old.\u00a0 So.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou might like it.\u201d\u00a0 After all, Bucky\u2019s old too.\nBucky nods and doesn't ask any more questions, the only sound from him the clacking of his knitting needles.\u00a0 Steve watches him as much as he watches the program, the movements of his metal hand a little fast than his right.\u00a0 The light of the screen washes him out, makes him look pale and delicate, turns his eyes a bright, electric blue.\nAfter a few minutes he stretches out, draping his legs across Steve\u2019s lap.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t look up as he does it, or even change the speed at which he knits. Like it\u2019s nothing.\nBut it\u2019s something.\u00a0 Before the fall, the ice, the war, Bucky had been a very tactile person, always ruffling Steve\u2019s hair or slinging an arm across his shoulders and pulling him close.\u00a0 It had been hard for Steve to get used to when they\u2019d first met.\u00a0 Then, when he came back, he avoided touch completely, flinching if he even got too near when they passed one another in the hallway.\u00a0 He\u2019s gotten more comfortable since then, he can stand brushing Steve\u2019s fingertips with his own when he passes him a plate, doesn\u2019t squirm when their shoulders touch in the movie theatre.\u00a0 But this\u2026 this is more physical contact than Steve has had with him since they were boys.\u00a0 He is a warm and heavy weight, and Steve can feel his face prickling with heat.\nHe looks away from him, keeping his eyes locked on the screen.\u00a0 He\u2019s lost the plot at this point. \u00a0Lucy is wearing a fake nose, he\u2019s pretty sure.\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay, Rogers?\u201d\nHe can feel Bucky\u2019s eyes on him all of a sudden.\u00a0 His voice is low.\u00a0 Steve hopes the light from the screen washes him out the way it does Bucky, turns him blue and white so he can\u2019t see the colour on his cheeks.\n\u201cNever better,\u201d he replies, hoping he sounds cheerful and not like he\u2019s about to swallow his tongue.\u00a0 \u201cNever better.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true, he thinks firmly, and pays strict attention to the television.\u00a0 But later he can\u2019t remember anything he watched.\n\u00a0***\nA few days later Steve enters his bedroom and finds a lumpy, uneven blue scarf on top of his pillow.\u00a0 There\u2019s no note.\u00a0 He wears it the next time he goes to Stark Tower\u2014or Avengers Tower, as it is now officially known\u2014for a meeting, wrapping it twice around his neck even though it's warm and sunny.\nTony notices, of course, because Tony Stark will never fail to notice things that give him an excuse to be a brat.\u00a0 \"What's with the noose?\" he asks as Steve sits down.\u00a0 \"Did your master finally give you clothes?\u00a0 Are you a free elf now?\"\nSteve rolls his eyes.\u00a0 It's a reference he understands\u2014thanks to Clint and his weird, intense obsession with those books about kid wizards, not because of Tony\u2014but that doesn't make it any less stupid.\u00a0 \"It was a present,\" he replies shortly, sitting down and looking at the tablet in front of him. There's another mad scientist threat. Apparently this one mostly does robots.\n\"A present from the Winter Soldier,\" Natasha adds from her seat further down the table.\nFor a minute Steve is confused as to how she knows all this.\u00a0 Then he remembers that just about everyone he knows now is a highly skilled covert operative and is no longer confused.\u00a0 \"I told you to stop spying on us,\" he says to Natasha.\u00a0\nNatasha shrugs. \u00a0\"If you really wanted me to stop you'd move into a building with fewer windows.\"\n\"And better locks,\" Clint agrees from further down the table.\n\u201cThicker walls would not go amiss either, Steve Rogers,\u201d Thor adds.\u00a0 Bruce nods.\nSteve ignores his awful friends, because Tony looks like he's died and gone to heaven, and that almost never means anything good for Steve.\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cThe bionically enhanced super-assassin you\u2019re keeping in your living room is knitting for you now.\u00a0 You couldn\u2019t have just shacked up with one of the millions of normal people who want to sleep with you.\u00a0 You had to choose a ninety-year-old former HYDRA agent with a robot arm.\u00a0 Who knits.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not millions,\u201d Steve replies, irritated.\u00a0 Then the first part of what Tony says catches up to him.\u00a0 He sets the tablet down.\u00a0 \u201cBucky and I have not shacked up.\u201d\nTony snorts.\u00a0 \u201cPlease.\u00a0 The last time I saw anyone look at anyone the way you and C-3P0 there do was\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He considers for a moment.\u00a0 \u201cWell, probably me looking at Pepper, actually.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d mutters Nat, just low enough for Steve to hear, \u201cit was you looking in a mirror.\u201d\nIn other circumstances he might laugh.\u00a0 Not now, though.\n\u201cYou and Miss Potts are in a relationship,\u201d he argues.\nTony raises his eyebrows.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d he says.\n\u201cBucky and I aren\u2019t in a relationship.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d He snorts.\u00a0 \u201cWell, if you say so.\u201d\nThey start talking about the scientist then.\u00a0 At least, the others do\u2014Steve\u2019s not really paying attention.\u00a0 He tries to remember the exact way that he and Bucky look at each other.\u00a0 He remembers the weight of Bucky\u2019s legs on him instead, the burning of his cheeks by the light of a screen.\n\u201cBut you love Miss Potts,\u201d he blurts out, interrupting Natasha\u2019s recitation of the intel she\u2019d gathered the night before.\u00a0 Tony actually rolls his eyes at this.\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that too, weirdly enough.\u201d\n\u201cBut if that\u2019s how Bucky and I look at each other\u2026\u201d\nHe trails off.\u00a0 Behind him, somebody\u2014he thinks it might be Bruce\u2014coughs gently.\u00a0 Tony looks at him.\u00a0 His expression is one Steve doesn\u2019t recognize immediately.\nEmpathy, he realizes.\u00a0 It\u2019s empathy.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, as though Steve has spoken aloud.\u00a0 His tone is different now too, softer and almost kind.\u00a0 \u201cKind of whacks you in the face, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nAnd maybe it really is understandable this time, because it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve exactly had normal person time to process things lately, but the truth is he hadn\u2019t seen what was going on even before all that happened.\u00a0 (Although maybe Bucky had\u2014he remembers the living room again, the low timbre of his voice.)\u00a0 But now that it\u2019s said\u2014now that it\u2019s something he can actually think about\u2014he can see it.\u00a0 Bucky curled up on the couch, wearing his sweats.\u00a0 The pages of dozens of sketchbooks filled with Bucky\u2019s face, before and after.\u00a0 The way Bucky had watched him eat, with a little secret smile, and the way he\u2019d always taken care of him, the way he still does even when he\u2019s half a mess himself.\u00a0 Waking up after the Potomac and knowing that he\u2019d saved him, that even in the mess that HYDRA had made of his brain there\u2019s still something in there that knows Steve, that can\u2019t not carry him to safety.\u00a0 Knowing that if it was the other way around, if Steve had been the one who\u2019d fallen and been emptied out and remade, there would be the same thing in his own brain, like he was born understanding that Bucky is important, that he\u2019s Steve\u2019s.\nHe thinks, I\u2019m in love, and it\u2019s like the lights go on inside him.\nHe stands abruptly, nearly knocking his chair over.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go do something,\u201d he says, and leaves.\nAs he closes the door behind him, he hears Tony say something that sounds like, \u201cAnd that, my friends, is how you do it.\u201d\n***\nIt should take almost an hour for him to walk from the Tower to their apartment. With a creative approach to what constitutes \"walking,\" and \"crosswalks,\" and occasionally \"streets,\" it takes him fifteen.\u00a0\nIt could have been ten if he\u2019d taken a similarly creative approach to pedestrian safety, but no matter how in love he might be, he\u2019s still himself.\nBucky isn't in the kitchen. He's not in the living room. He's not in his bedroom or Steve's bedroom or the bathroom or even the crawl space you can only get to through the hall closet. Steve is reasonably close to panicking when he passes by an open window and hears a familiar voice singing quietly, something sweet and low in a language he doesn't understand. He looks out and sees Bucky sitting cross-legged on the fire escape, golden sunlight making him look impossibly young. Underneath his singing Steve can hear the gentle click of knitting needles.\u00a0 His metal arm flashes as it moves.\nHe looks up when Steve steps out onto the fire escape, squinting into the light. \"You're home early,\" he says. He is gilded and beautiful, and Steve wonders how he never realized before.\u00a0 Maybe he had, maybe that\u2019s what this has been about all along, ever since they were kids. \u00a0\"Apocalypse ain't happening yet, I take it?\"\nSteve still isn\u2019t used to standing over him after all these years, and he doesn\u2019t like it.\u00a0 He sits down instead, folding his legs under him so they both have room\u2014it\u2019s a small fire escape, and they\u2019re both bigger than they used to be.\n\u201cIt might be,\u201d he replies.\u00a0 \u201cI just figure I have more important things to do right now than stop it.\u201d\nHe practiced that line all the way home.\u00a0 He thinks it\u2019s pretty good.\nAs it played out in his head, he\u2019d drop the line and then go in for a kiss immediately, and things would go from there.\u00a0 As it actually plays out, Bucky moves and starts to say something just as he begins to lean forward, and he starts back immediately, suddenly sure he\u2019d miscalculated somewhere.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. He\u2019s already trying to plan some way to fix this, because his brain is racing ahead to Bucky hating him and feeling uncomfortable and God, leaving, and he needs to head all those off at the pass.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c\nBucky actually rolls his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cChrist, Rogers,\u201d he all but growls, and reaches out, grabbing the ends of the scarf with his metal hand.\u00a0 He yanks, Steve falls forward, and then they\u2019re kissing, clumsy and sweet and warm.\nAfter a moment Bucky pushes him back, still holding on to the scarf, like Steve might float away any minute and needs to be tethered to the ground.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d he says, \u201cwas \u2018what the hell could be more important to Captain America than saving the world?\u2019\u201d\nSteve\u2019s grinning so hard his face hurts, his breath coming in quick, warm pants.\u00a0 He feels lightheaded and shivery and incredibly good.\u00a0 \u201cWell, I dunno,\u201d he says.\u00a0 He thinks he might sound a little drunk.\u00a0 \u201cTurns out there\u2019s this fella I\u2019m a little crazy about.\u00a0 Have been since I was a kid.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky inhales sharply at that but says nothing, his eyes tracking every movement in Steve\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cAnd he\u2019s been taking care of me since then, too, and I only realized what that meant about, oh, twenty minutes ago.\u201d\u00a0 He pauses, then adds thoughtfully, \u201cAnd I needed Tony Stark to help me get there, too.\u00a0 Guess I never was the brains of this outfit.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Bucky confirms.\u00a0 He winds the scarf tighter around his hand, pulling Steve back in until their foreheads touch.\u00a0 He glanced at the yarn wrapped around his fingers and says, \u201cI'm learning to make other things, you know.\"\n\"Yeah? Like what?\"\nHe hums.\u00a0 \"Hats. And mittens.\u201d\u00a0 He leans forward again, nips gently at Steve\u2019s lower lip. \u201cMaybe a sweater if you're good.\"\n\"And if I'm not?\" Steve manages, once his brain has started up again.\u00a0 He has, admittedly, very little experience with kissing, but the fact that teeth can be involved, and that it can feel good, is frankly mind-blowing.\nBucky smiles, letting the scarf go.\u00a0 \"Long underwear. Itchy, scratchy long johns that you'll have to wear under your suit.\u00a0 I\u2019ll check before you leave the house, like your ma used to do in winter.\"\n\"You wouldn't.\"\nHe drops another kiss on his lips, quick and hot, and says, \"Try me.\"\n***\nHe does."
