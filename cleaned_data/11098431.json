    "text": "\nTo: Yaoyorozu Momo, Iida Tenya, Uraraka Ochako, Kaminari Denki, Aizawa Shouta\n\n\nCC: Midoriya Izuku\n\n\nFrom: Todoroki Shouto\n\n\nDate: October 17\n\n\nSubject: Apologies\n\n\u00a0\n\nHello, all\u2014\n\n\nI would like to apologize for being so difficult to contact in the past two weeks. I\u2019ve been having some personal issues and family drama recently, and in spite of my best efforts, it has been negatively affecting other aspects of my life.\n\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t be open about this sort of thing, but I have committed myself to all of you in some way, and you deserve an explanation, and I hope to rely on your discretion. I\u2019ve been in conflict with my father recently, and it\u2019s severe enough that I\u2019m no longer welcome to return home. Unfortunately, many of my belongings are still there, including my laptop and the hard drive containing most of my current work. Iida, Yaoyorozu, and Kaminari, I\u2019ve been working to salvage my share of the work for our class; if it becomes clear that I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll make sure out professor knows to grade me separately, so that this doesn\u2019t reflect on you. Uraraka\u2014since my availability may be spotty while I get this sorted out, I can put you in contact with some of my acquaintances at the campus academic resource center.\n\n\nAizawa-sensei, I managed to salvage the notes I took. I\u2019ll send you those in a separate e-mail.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you all for your patience,\n\n\u2013Todoroki Shouto\n\u00a0\nIzuku had barely finished reading the last line when his phone went off. Startling in his seat, he knocked his knee against the leg of his desk and fumbled it out of his pocket with shaking hands. He nearly dropped it twice before he managed to answer the call.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nFor a moment there was no answer, besides a rush of air that he recognized as Shouto\u2019s quiet sigh.\n\u201cCan\u2026 we talk? Sometime today? It doesn\u2019t have to be now.\u201d\nIzuku let himself slide down in his chair, limp and boneless and caught between relief and worry. It had been two weeks since he\u2019d had so much as a text from Shouto, and the sound of his voice was a balm to Izuku\u2019s soul, but Shouto sounded so tired. \u201cIt can be now,\u201d he answered, sitting up again. \u201cAre you free? We can meet up.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have class soon?\u201d\n\u201cIshiyama-sensei records his lectures, I\u2019ll just listen to the podcast.\u201d Izuku has halfway out of his chair. \u201cCan we get coffee? Or tea. The usual place\u2014I can be there in ten.\u201d\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Was Shouto really that hoarse, or was the connection spotty? \u201cIf it\u2019s not an imposition\u2014I could just. Come to you. Are you in your apartment right now?\u201d\nIzuku sat up straight, heart stuttering in his chest. \u201cYes. Yes, of course it\u2019s\u2014come on over.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\n\u201cShouto,\u201d Izuku said, before the other could hang up.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nIzuku didn\u2019t realize his bottom lip was caught between his teeth until he had to release it to speak again. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nThe silence was longer this time. Then\u2014\n\u201cI love you too. I-I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\nThe call ended, and Izuku practically flew to the kitchen to get a pot of tea ready.\nShouto\u2019s hair hung over his eyes, hiding them from view. He sat alongside Izuku on the battered secondhand couch, one hand wrapped around his cup of tea. Izuku rested his own hand over the other, stroking gently with his thumb.\n\u201cSo, you\u2014I assume you saw the e-mail.\u201d Shouto paused, clearing his throat quietly. \u201cI should\u2019ve called sooner. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2026 sounds like you\u2019ve had a lot going on,\u201d Izuku answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting with your dad again?\u201d\nShouto\u2019s hand shifted, lacing their fingers together. \u201cYeah.\u201d He sipped his tea, then slowly lowered the cup back to the coffee table.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d Izuku moved closer, reached over, and brushed Shouto\u2019s bangs out of his face. \u201cTalk to me? What happened?\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d Shouto ground his teeth. He spoke as if every word hurt to say. \u201cIt was two weeks ago, and\u2026 and I shouldn\u2019t have disappeared like that, I\u2019m sorry, I just\u2014my head wasn\u2019t a pleasant place to be, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 want to subject you to that.\u201d\n\u201cHey. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Izuku squeezed his hand. \u201cI always am.\u201d\n\u201cIt got\u2026 really bad.\u201d Shouto\u2019s throat bobbed. \u201cI felt like I needed to be alone for a while, to get my head together and try to fix this.\u201d He paused, mouth twisting. \u201cIt\u2019s official, though. He pretty much kicked me out\u2014disowned me. Though\u2026 he didn\u2019t say that outright.\u201d\nThe breath left Izuku in a rush. \u201cOh, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Shouto said flatly. \u201cI-I mean\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t care. But I left some of my things at his place. Important things. And I\u2019ve tried to talk him around, but\u2026\u201d He let out a sharp, angry sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s cut me off completely. He won\u2019t let me near it unless I change my major.\u201d\nIzuku bristled, though he fought to keep from letting it show. \u201cIs he serious?\u201d\nA bitter smile quirked at the corner of Shouto\u2019s mouth. \u201cI guess he\u2019s still dead set on me being a surgeon.\u201d\n\u201cStill?\u201d Izuku shook his head, disgusted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Shouto said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d His cheekbones shifted as he gritted his teeth again. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou saw the e-mail, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Shouto let go of the tea cup to press his palm against his eyes. \u201cHe has my laptop and hard drive. And it\u2019s my own damn fault for hurrying out the way I did, but\u2014all of my school work was on that, and most of the work I\u2019ve done for my honors thesis. I\u2019m lucky I keep my work with Aizawa-sensei on a different drive, or I\u2019d be screwed there, too.\u201d His shoulders slumped. \u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll have to retake some classes, so it\u2019s going to take even longer to finish, which means it\u2019ll cost more, and even if I wanted to take his damn money, he\u2019d never\u2014\u201d\nIzuku shifted closer on the couch and wrapped him in a hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own fault,\u201d Shouto said softly. \u201cIf I\u2019d just slowed down and used my brain for two seconds\u2014instead of storming out like a self-righteous idiot\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should blame anybody except the asshole who\u2019s holding all your stuff for ransom,\u201d Izuku told him.\nShouto went quiet for a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019m still a self-righteous idiot,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re my self-righteous idiot.\u201d\nThere was no reply, at least not with words. Shouto turned, pressed his face against Izuku\u2019s shoulder, and let out another sigh, breath ghosting over his neck. Izuku pressed him close and combed his fingers through Shouto\u2019s hair.\n\u201cWas there anything else important?\u201d he asked cautiously. \u201cThat he took from you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 most of it can be replaced,\u201d Shouto answered. \u201cLike my clothes. And\u2026 if I could just get my hard drive back, I could get a new laptop, or just use the computers on campus. But then there\u2019s notebooks, accolades, books\u2014and some presents, from my mom and my sister. My sister made a scarf for me, did you know that? She learned to knit and she made me a scarf. Anyway, most of it\u2019s in my room. And\u2026 remember when we did that summer abroad in America? Blew all our money on souvenirs? He\u2019s got all that, too.\u201d\n\u201cThat bastard.\u201d\nShouto sighed, as Izuku began to rub calming circles on his back. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to get upset about all that, I just\u2026 it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Izuku buried his face in Shouto\u2019s hair. \u201cWant me to kick his ass for you? Martial arts club is doing an exhibition in a month or so, and I can always use the practice.\u201d\nHe was rewarded with a quiet spurt of laughter from Shouto. \u201cHe was a competitive boxer, you egg.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, years ago, and it\u2019s not like he actually won anything.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may.\u201d He could hear the smile in Shouto\u2019s voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a big, mean old bastard, and his temper hasn\u2019t aged well. I love you, but he can probably take you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you insist.\u201d Izuku pulled back, just far enough that he could see Shouto\u2019s face again. Up close, he could see the dark circles beneath his eyes, visible even on the scarred side of his face. Izuku took all of it in, one piece at a time.\nShouto stared back, eyelids heavy and tired. \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026 you.\u201d In spite of himself, Izuku felt the corners of his mouth creep upward into a smile. \u201cI missed seeing your face, this past couple of weeks.\u201d\nShouto lowered his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Izuku leaned forward and kissed him softly. \u201cIt\u2019s always all right, Shouto.\u201d\nShouto sighed again, and some of the tension seemed to leave him. His eyes were on Izuku\u2019s, shining in a way that made Izuku\u2019s heart do that funny little floppy thing in his chest. They had been dating too long for either of them to need to be bashful, and yet\u2026\n\u201cAre you\u2026 sure you don\u2019t have to go to class?\u201d Shouto asked.\nIzuku drank in the brightness of his eyes, the warmth of closeness, and the whisper of Shouto\u2019s breath against his skin. Instead of answering, he pushed their tea cups closer to the center of the coffee table, and climbed into Shouto\u2019s lap.\nSomething would have to be done about this, of course. But for now, with Shouto sliding his hands beneath Izuku\u2019s shirt and pressing kisses down the side of his neck, Izuku could set those thoughts aside for later.\n\nTo: Yaoyorozu Momo, Iida Tenya, Uraraka Ochako, Kaminari Denki, Aizawa Shouta\n\n\nFrom: Midoriya Izuku\n\n\nDate: October 17\n\n\nSubject: I have some concerns\n\n\u00a0\n\nHi!\n\n\nSo I only know a couple of you, but I figured I might as well contact all of you concerning that e-mail we all just received from Shouto. I don\u2019t know how much the rest of you know about the whole situation, but none of it sits right with me, and if I don\u2019t do something about it, it\u2019ll bother me.\n\n\nAnyway, I have some ideas, none of which I would be able to pull off myself, so I was wondering if any of you were interested in helping me remedy this situation? I know all our schedules probably differ, but I bet we could work something out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks!\n\n\u2013Midoriya Izuku\nOf the five who joined him in the cafe the following day, Izuku was already familiar with Uraraka and Iida.\nHe\u2019d met Uraraka at orientation his freshman year, and the two of them had clicked as instant best friends, in spite of the fact that their majors (journalism and civil engineering, respectively) had basically nothing to do with each other. They still found common ground; they\u2019d discovered the university\u2019s martial arts club together, and a mutual love of platonic late-night Netflix binges.\nIida was another friendly face; he and Izuku had shared the same communications class one semester, and Iida had let Izuku drag him to a club meeting, and promptly surprised him by flipping him over his shoulder and onto the mat. Not bad for a pre-law student; apparently he and his older brother used to do competitions.\nThe other three, however, were relatively unfamiliar to him. Izuku was a little confused as to how Shouto knew Kaminari Denki\u2014he seemed perfectly nice, but he was majoring in fashion design, and didn\u2019t seem like the type to travel in the same circles as him. Yaoyorozu Momo made a little more sense, at least personality-wise, though she was in chemical engineering, not psychology.\n(She had a strong handshake. \u201cYou\u2019re Midoriya? It\u2019s nice to finally meet you. Todoroki talks about you a lot\u2014we\u2019re, uh, jogging buddies.\u201d Her shirt was just short enough that Izuku could see her abs.)\nAizawa Shouta, at least, was someone he knew by reputation. Izuku had never taken a psych class in his life, but he was familiar with his boyfriend\u2019s favorite professor.\n(Hadn\u2019t Shouto said something about Aizawa being ex-military? Ah, well, not important.)\nThe six of them sat at the same table and seemed to size each other up as they exchanged glances\u2014some politely curious, some awkward, some grim.\n\u201cSo\u2026 perhaps we should go around and explain how we all know Todoroki,\u201d Iida suggested. \u201cMidoriya? You called us here, would you like to start?\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m his boyfriend,\u201d Izuku said, a little sheepishly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard from him in a couple weeks before he sent out that e-mail, but he told me a little more about his situation, and\u2026 I decided I couldn\u2019t leave it alone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, something seems pretty\u2026 icky about this whole thing,\u201d Uraraka agreed, nodding. \u201cAnd Todoroki\u2019s been tutoring me all semester\u2014he\u2019s the main reason I\u2019m passing my chemistry class. So I figure I owe him a favor.\u201d\n\u201cYaoyorozu, Kaminari, and I share a class with him,\u201d Iida said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a group project together.\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki\u2019s basically been spearheading most of it,\u201d Kaminari added. \u201cThis project\u2019s worth thirty-five percent of our grade. So we want to help him, but it\u2019s also practical \u2018cause, y\u2019know, we kinda need what\u2019s on that laptop if we want to pass this class.\u201d\n\u201cBesides which, he\u2019s a good friend of mine,\u201d Yaoyorozu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since high school, and\u2026 well, suffice it to say, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had problems with his father.\u201d\nThere was a pause, and Aizawa blinked suddenly, as if he\u2019d woken out of a doze. \u201cHe took my upper-division Child Psychology course when he was a freshman. Aced it. Kept showing up in my classes ever since. I\u2019ve been helping him out with his honors thesis, he\u2019s been helping me out with my doctoral thesis.\u201d He paused, and his hooded eyes flickered to each of them in turn. \u201cI hope you realize that if you\u2019re planning on engaging in unlawful or unsafe behavior, I am obligated to stop you.\u201d\n\u201cWe would never!\u201d Iida spluttered. \u201cAll we wish to do is help a friend out of a miserable situation. We certainly don\u2019t need to break the law to do so. Right, Midoriya?\u201d\nBut Izuku was only half listening. He was contemplating his own hands, callused and strong considering all the grip-strengthening he did whenever they were free. He was considering Iida\u2014big, broad, and muscular. Hulking, even. And Uraraka, a powerhouse in her own right; Izuku had certainly sparred with her enough to know that.\nHe considered Yaoyorozu\u2019s strong handshake and toned musculature, and the way she had paused before calling herself Shouto\u2019s \u201cjogging buddy.\u201d Kaminari was a bit more of a wild card, but he had a sharp look about him. He may as well have had \u201ctroublemaker\u201d tattooed across his forehead. They could work with that.\nAnd as for Aizawa\u2026\nThere was something about him. Something that Izuku couldn\u2019t quite name, but God if it wasn\u2019t reassuring and unsettling at the same time.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a plan involved,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Shouto\u2019s dad has shut him out and won\u2019t let him have his stuff back, so I figured we might have a better chance. There being\u2026 you know\u2026 more of us.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Kaminari broke in. \u201cYou want to intimidate this guy into giving Todoroki his stuff back?\u201d A slow smile spread across his face.\n\u201cNot intimidate,\u201d Izuku answered. \u201cJust\u2026 convince. Through superior numbers.\u201d\n\u201cSeems a little audacious,\u201d Yaoyorozu said thoughtfully. \u201cBut it could work. The six of us presenting a united front could convince him.\u201d\n\u201cJust as long as we aren\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know, threatening him,\u201d Iida said. \u201cAs much as he might deserve it, I\u2019m not sure Todoroki would be happy if we all got into trouble on his account.\u201d\n\u201cThreatening?\u201d Izuku echoed, widening his eyes for good measure. \u201cWho\u2019s threatening anyone? If six people show up on his doorstep asking to collect a mutual friend\u2019s belongings, and he takes a simple request like that as a threat, then it\u2019s hardly our fault he misinterpreted us.\u201d\nThe table fell into a thoughtful silence after that. Izuku watched their faces, gauging their reactions. Uraraka looked eager, Iida looked pensive. Yaoyorozu had a determined glint in her eye, and Kaminari was smiling like a cat with a canary.\nAs for Aizawa\u2026\n\u201cI have a car,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re all pitching in for gas.\u201d\nIzuku beamed.\n\u201cSo how\u2019re we going to play this?\u201d Kaminari asked, peering out at the house before them with his hands splayed against the window.\n\u201cDon\u2019t smudge the glass,\u201d Aizawa said flatly from behind the wheel.\n\u201cWe may as well give him a chance at civility first,\u201d Iida suggested. \u201cPerhaps if one of us explains the situation, he can be reasoned with.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t sound right,\u201d Izuku said.\n\u201cThat begs the question, though,\u201d Yaoyorozu said. \u201cWhich of us would approach him first?\u201d\n\u201cI vote Deku,\u201d Uraraka piped up.\nIzuku almost pulled a muscle in his neck turning to stare at her. \u201cW-what? Why me?\u201d\n\u201cThis was sort of your idea,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cNo\u2014no, my idea was all of us going up together,\u201d he reminded her.\n\u201cI think we can all agree that you\u2019re undeniably adorable,\u201d Kaminari pointed out. \u201cThink Todoroki\u2019s dad is weak to puppy eyes?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s palm made a faint smacking noise against his forehead. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it make more sense for you or Iida or Yaoyorozu to go? At least you have a really practical reason for needing this.\u201d\n\u201cOh, for the love of\u2014\u201d Yaoyorozu muttered, and opened her door. \u201cI\u2019ll go. I\u2019ve met him before, and Todoroki always said I was one of the few friends he actually approved of. Maybe I can make him budge.\u201d\n\u201cGodspeed, Yao-momo,\u201d Kaminari whispered, only for her to snag a handful of his jacket on her way out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re backing me up,\u201d she said.\nThe four of them watched as Yaoyorozu and Kaminari made their way down the sidewalk and climbed up the steps to the house. They had a decent view of the front door, so they could see perfectly well when the door opened, and Todoroki Enji stood in view for all of two seconds before yelling something and slamming the door in Yaoyorozu and Kaminari\u2019s faces.\n\u201cWelp,\u201d Uraraka said softly. \u201cGuess he\u2019s picked the hard way. Deku, Iida, let\u2019s go. Grab the boxes.\u201d She was dressed today in the tank top and athletic pants she usually wore for training. It was a good choice of outfit, because it showed off the hardened muscles in her arms. As they hurried up the sidewalk to the house, Izuku saw Yaoyorozu shed her jacket and grinned. Uraraka wasn\u2019t the only one dressed for the occasion.\nThey knocked again, and the door opened forcefully to reveal Todoroki Enji scowling down at them. And then he blinked, as if re-counting them.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Izuku said in a voice that dripped honey. \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that Shouto left some of his things here when he moved out, so we were hoping to pick them up for him. We\u2019ll be in and out, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nEnji\u2019s eyes narrowed scornfully. \u201cI already told Shouto how he can earn his\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off, and there was a soft clatter behind them.\nIzuku looked over his shoulder to find that, rather than walking up the steps like the rest of them, Aizawa had decided to climb up the banister and perch there like a dead-eyed gargoyle.\n\u201cYour son is one of my students,\u201d he said, without a drop of inflection in his voice. \u201cOne of my best, in fact. He\u2019ll be earning a psych degree a semester earlier than normal. With honors, no less. You must be so proud.\u201d\nTurning back, Izuku saw Enji\u2019s face go red with anger.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it slipped his mind that he left his hard drive here,\u201d Aizawa went on coolly. \u201cA hard drive that contains, among other things, research and data necessary for my doctoral thesis. So you can understand why I\u2019d like to return that to him.\u201d His eyes glinted. For a split second Izuku could imagine them glowing red. \u201cAnd why I would be very upset if I found that it had been tampered with in any way.\u201d\nAt the door, Todoroki Enji shook with rage. He was a big man, and it was easy to remember what Shouto said about the boxing. But there was a difference between a professional boxer, and a retiree who set aside his sport in favor of med school and had since let fat grow on his muscles.\nHe was outnumbered, and they all looked pissed.\nIzuku actually heard the doorknob creak in Enji\u2019s grip before he yanked the door open and stepped aside, seething. \u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTake what you\u2019re looking for and get out.\u201d\nIzuku was hard-pressed not to grin as he handed cardboard boxes to Iida and Kaminari, and walked inside.\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Iida said politely, if a little stiffly. Enji ignored him.\nLeading the charge, Izuku wondered if it was a bit suspicious that he made a beeline for Shouto\u2019s room, since as far as Enji knew, this was the first time he\u2019d ever set foot in this place. Not that it mattered\u2014if all went well today, then he would never be back anyway.\nIida followed in his wake, and it was only then that Izuku realized that none of the others had come into the hall with them. He paused. \u201cWhere\u2019d everybody go?\u201d\n\u201cIt might be best if we split up to look,\u201d Iida replied. \u201cYou never know if something has been moved or spread out. But we may as well focus on his bedroom.\u201d He dropped the volume of his voice. \u201cYou seem to know your way around.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 Enji\u2019s a busy man,\u201d Izuku muttered back. \u201cSometimes Shouto would have me over while he was at a medical conference or something. Here we go.\u201d He pushed the right door open and led the way inside.\nShouto\u2019s room was much the same as he remembered it from the last time he was here. The futon was folded up and put away, but the room still looked cluttered, which matched with what Shouto had said about his hasty departure. With a light sigh, Izuku placed his box on the floor and set about gathering his boyfriend\u2019s belongings.\n\u201cDo we know exactly what we\u2019re looking for here?\u201d Iida asked.\n\u201cBesides his laptop and hard drive, he mentioned presents from his mother and sister, including a scarf,\u201d Izuku replied. \u201cAnd then\u2026 oh, here we go.\u201d A drawer in Shouto\u2019s desk revealed notebooks and folders that, upon investigation, proved to contain old letters, certificates, and other congratulatory documents. Dates ranged from just last semester, all the way back to middle school. With a small smile, Izuku gathered up the contents of the drawer and carried them over to his box. \u201cPlus some souvenirs from our summer abroad in America, if you can find those. He said his clothes were replaceable, but\u2026 honestly, grab whatever fits.\u201d\nThey searched that room for another ten minutes. They had two empty boxes each, and with their presence so clearly unwelcome, both of them worked quickly. Not bothering with neatness, they filled all four boxes with anything that looked important or sentimental.\n\u201cAh!\u201d Iida gave a cry. \u201cI\u2019ve found his laptop. And this looks like his hard drive, as well.\u201d\nIzuku looked over. Sure enough, Iida was placing Shouto\u2019s familiar computer in one of the boxes, along with\u2026\n\u201cThat\u2019s not his hard drive,\u201d Izuku said, heart sinking.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Iida looked dismayed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it might be his\u2014an old one, I mean. But that\u2019s not the one he\u2019s currently using.\u201d Frustrated, he glanced around, but there was no other device in sight. Shouto\u2019s belongings were fairly sparse as it was, and this room didn\u2019t seem to be yielding anything. \u201cI\u2019ll go look around for it. Keep looking in here, okay?\u201d\n\u201cGot it. Good luck, Midoriya.\u201d\nIzuku wandered back out into the hall and tiptoed cautiously back to the main living area. The scene he came upon was a strange one.\nUraraka and Yaoyorozu were searching the living room, if you could call it \u201csearching.\u201d It was more like they were rearranging the furniture on the pretense of checking behind couches or under armchairs. Todoroki Enji looked fit to be tied. Aizawa stood a few feet behind him, not saying anything or touching him or even moving closer. He simply stood there, and wherever Enji went, Aizawa followed him like an ominous shadow. As Izuku wandered into view, Enji scowled at him and opened his mouth to speak.\nIn full view of him, Uraraka picked up the lamp table.\nIt was not a small piece of furniture. It was high enough to reach her waist and had drawers on it, presumably full drawers. Uraraka lifted it up as if gravity no longer applied to it. The lamp barely wobbled on its surface as she hefted it to shoulder level, checked beneath it, and set it down again. As if to emphasize the point, Yaoyorozu managed to drag the living room sofa two feet from the wall with minimal visible effort.\nEnji\u2019s mouth closed. Behind him, Aizawa was smirking.\nAfter a minute or so of poking around, Izuku found his way into Enji\u2019s office room. This time, heedless of the girls or of Aizawa\u2019s presence, Shouto\u2019s father pursued him.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing in there?\u201d he demanded.\nIzuku poked his head in and glanced around. \u201cJust checking for\u2026 oh! There it is!\u201d Sitting on Enji\u2019s desk, on top of a pile of papers, was the missing hard drive. Darting in, Izuku grabbed it and left the room.\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine\u2014\u201d Enji snapped, making a grab for it. Izuku darted out of the way and fixed him with a cold stare.\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThis belongs to Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell it\u2014\u201d Behind him, Aizawa stepped closer, and Enji darted a glare over his shoulder at him before rounding on Izuku again. \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d\n\u201cI recognize it,\u201d Izuku answered. \u201cAnd I should, considering I bought it for him.\u201d\nEnji\u2019s eyes burned with rage. Izuku walked past him and didn\u2019t look back.\nThe sound of rustling brought him into the kitchen, where he stopped in his tracks and stared. \u201cKaminari?\u201d\n\u201cHeya,\u201d Kaminari greeted him through a half-chewed mouthful.\n\u201cKaminari, where the hell did you get that sandwich?\u201d\nKaminari shrugged. \u201cMade it. Looked like you guys had everything under control, so.\u201d He popped the last bite into his mouth. \u201cMm. I missed lunch today.\u201d He glanced over Izuku\u2019s shoulder, as if checking to see if Enji was coming. \u201cHow long we got left?\u201d\n\u201cA little bit, why?\u201d Izuku replied.\nAnd there it was\u2014a little spark of trouble in Kaminari\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have an idea. And it\u2019ll be faster if there\u2019s two of us.\u201d\nIzuku squinted at him. \u201cWhat kind of idea?\u201d\n\u201cThe kind that ruins the asshole\u2019s day. Probably a bunch of his days.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s face lit up with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\nIn the end, they were in and out in less than twenty minutes, everyone carrying cardboard boxes\u2014Uraraka made a point of hefing one on each shoulder. Shouto\u2019s father said nothing as they left, only slamming the door and locking it behind them. Together they marched their way back to Aizawa\u2019s car like conquering heroes, and in a matter of minutes, they were loaded up and on the road again.\n\u00a0\n\n[Me:]\n\n\nhey shouto where are you right now.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[Shouto:]\n\n\nAt my apartment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[Me:]\n\n\noh good!!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[Me:]\n\n\ncan you come outside? we need a little help with all this.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[Shouto:]\n\n\nO? kay?\n\n\u00a0\nBy the time Shouto came down to the parking lot, the six of them were standing outside the car, waiting for him. Catching sight of them, he slowed to a halt and blinked, confusion clouding his face.\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Slowly, he walked the rest of the way until he reached them. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize all of you knew each other.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we didn\u2019t!\u201d Uraraka said cheerily. \u201cExcept me, Iida, and Deku.\u201d\n\u201cAnd us, of course,\u201d Yaoyorozu added.\nAizawa gave him a slow blink. \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t blind-copy your e-mails, Todoroki.\u201d\nShouto stared at him owlishly. \u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cSo anyway!\u201d Izuku piped up. \u201cWe, ah, went to see your dad. Somehow nobody punched him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d Shouto\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cWhen? What did you say to him?\u201d\n\u201cWe just left him, actually,\u201d Iida replied, adjusting his glasses. \u201cAnd we merely informed him that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Kaminari broke in, puffing his chest out a little. \u201cWe\u2019re not messenger boys\u2014we\u2019re delivery boys. And girls.\u201d\nAizawa\u2019s trunk was open, so Izuku lifted out one of the boxes and held it up, teeth bared in a grin. \u201cWe, uh. Got your stuff back?\u201d\nShouto stared back at him, speechless, as Uraraka gave him a hearty slap on the back. \u201cWell c\u2019mon, then! Let\u2019s get all this into your apartment!\u201d\nIt only took one trip to get the boxes from Aizawa\u2019s car to Shouto\u2019s living room floor, even with the latter wandering in a speechless daze the whole time. When it was all settled, Izuku opened up the first box.\n\u201cWell, first things first,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s your laptop and hard drive.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we checked them already,\u201d Iida said with a smile. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull any mischief by wiping them. We\u2019re not sure if everything is still on them, only you\u2019ll be able to know for sure, but we believe your files are untouched.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thanks.\u201d Shouto ducked his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for nearly losing them. With all of you relying on me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, dude,\u201d Kaminari interrupted. \u201cSeriously. This is a shitty thing to happen to anybody.\u201d\n\u201cOh! And Iida found that stuff you got in America!\u201d Izuku shoved another box toward him. \u201cAnd a bunch of your clothes. And\u2026 well, we basically tried to take everything in your room that wasn\u2019t nailed down or furniture. Couldn\u2019t get everything, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cN-no, you\u2026\u201d Shouto was sifting through the contents, moving as if he was still in a fog. \u201cYou got everything important. Oh, this\u2026\u201d He lifted out a small snow globe, then put it back quickly.\n\u201cOh, I recognize that,\u201d Yaoyorozu said. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom get you that?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah, after she got out of the hospital.\u201d With shaking hands, Shouto put it back. By now, all but two of the boxes were open, and he went through each one to give them a quick once-over. \u201cI-I think\u2026 yeah, you got everything. This is all my\u2014all the important things, anyway.\u201d He went to open the other two, and the dazed expression on his face turned to one of bewilderment. \u201cUm. What\u2019s all of this?\u201d\nKaminari cackled. \u201cThat\u2019s what me and Midoriya worked on together,\u201d he said, grinning with pure glee.\n\u201cIs this where you two vanished off to?\u201d Iida asked, frowning down at the contents of the box. \u201cWhat\u2014what exactly were you two doing?\u201d\nGrinning smugly, Izuku gave the box a light kick. \u201cTaking the batteries out of all his remote controls, the laces out of all his shoes, and every spare pen we could find.\u201d\n\u201cUnscrewed every lightbulb we thought we could get away with, too,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cI had to piggyback on Midoriya to get the one in his master closet, but he was a good sport about it. Oh, and we took all of your dad\u2019s dress socks\u2014that was Midoriya\u2019s idea, not mine.\u201d\n\u201cMuch like the rest of this entire venture,\u201d Yaoyorozu added. \u201cHe was the one who e-mailed the rest of us.\u201d\nBy now, Shouto was gaping openly at Izuku, who could only sputter and blush and try to change the subject. \u201cWell, we took all the dress socks we could find, anyway.\u201d He smirked. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we got all the toilet paper, though. Including the rolls already installed.\u201d He picked up a roll and held it up. \u201cYou guys wanna divvy this up? It\u2019s been a while since I could afford two-ply.\u201d\nUraraka burst out laughing, over-balanced, and ended up curled up on the floor, howling.\n\u201cW-well, I suppose a little harmless mischief was called for,\u201d Iida admitted, clearly trying not to join her.\nAizawa stared at them. Mostly at Kaminari. \u201cWe were in there for eighteen minutes,\u201d he said flatly, as Uraraka\u2019s shrieks of laughter wound down to breathless wheezing. \u201cYou were hiding in the kitchen for ten of those minutes.\u201d\n\u201cHey, sue me, alright?\u201d Kaminari rolled his eyes. \u201cI was hungry, and there was leftover salmon salad in the fridge. Which was delicious, by the way.\u201d\nYaoyorozu shook her head, and patted Uraraka\u2019s back as she sat back up, red-faced from laughing. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t account for how you managed to fill these in eight minutes.\u201d\n\u201cI am a professional,\u201d Kaminari said primly.\nIzuku shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, I was running on spite at that point.\u201d\nA soft, strangled noise turned their attention back to Shouto. If Izuku didn\u2019t know better, he would have said that it sounded like a choked-off laugh. Shouto was kneeling over the box, one hand pressed to his mouth, and before anyone else could speak, he was already in tears.\n\u201cS-sorry.\u201d Shouto ducked his head, pressing the back of his hand to his eyes in a vain attempt to stem them. \u201cSorry, I just\u2014give me a second, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d His breath hitched, and he sniffled a little. \u201cDamn it. I-I didn\u2019t\u2014you didn\u2019t have to go to this trouble just to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOf course we did!\u201d Kaminari said with mock horror. \u201cThirty-five percent of our grade, Todoroki!\u201d At Shouto\u2019s choked laugh, he grinned. \u201cBesides, we got your back, man.\u201d\nIzuku took hold of his boyfriend\u2019s elbow and gently drew him into a hug. For a moment Shouto clung to him, burying his face in the side of Izuku\u2019s neck while Izuku ruffled his hair fondly. \u201cYou told me not to try to kick his ass,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I settled for the next best thing.\u201d\n\u201cWe totally could\u2019ve taken him,\u201d Kaminari muttered.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Shouto\u2019s voice was muffled against Izuku\u2019s now damp shoulder. \u201cThank you, all of you\u2014\u201d\nUraraka joined the hug, dragging Iida along with her. Kaminari was quick to jump in after them, and a chuckling Yaoyorozu joined the chaotic embrace with Shouto at the center.\nThat left Aizawa standing off to the side, a little awkwardly, but nonetheless looking vaguely pleased.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody else up for ramen?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Shouto murmured against Izuku\u2019s jaw, \u201care unbelievable.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s breath hitched in his lungs as he slipped his hands beneath Shouto\u2019s shirt and ran his fingertips up his boyfriend\u2019s back. \u201cI know. And I love you too.\u201d A kiss cut him off, and he went limp and boneless between Shouto and the couch cushions beneath him. When Shouto came up for air again, Izuku freed one of his hands to caress the side of his face. \u201cQuestion\u2014is this a bad time to ask you to move in with me?\u201d When Shouto blinked down at him, Izuku smiled. \u201cSince you might need to be a little more money-conscious.\u201d\nSoft laughter escaped Shouto in a huff of breath.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d The whisper ghosted against Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you never learned\u2014\u201d Shouto kissed him again. \u201c\u2014to mind your own business.\u201d Another kiss, this time to the corner of his jaw.\n\u201cMind my own business, huh?\u201d Izuku grinned. \u201cSounds boring.\u201d\nShouto laughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it,\u201d Izuku whispered, his lips brushing the shell of Shouto\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can live with that.\u201d"
