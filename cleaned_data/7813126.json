    "text": "\u00a0\nThe nightmares start gradually.\n\u00a0\nJust slight flashes of discomfort. Winces in the night that slightly disturb Lance\u2019s slumber, but barely register the next morning. A negative feeling. A flash of feeling trapped. They\u2019re small and inconsequential. Whenever anyone asks the next morning how he slept, he replies with \u201cFine,\u201d because that\u2019s how he remembers it. They are nothing to worry about.\n\u00a0\nBut they get worse.\n\u00a0\nWhere he would normally just roll over and push the thoughts at bay, he is now wide awake in a cold sweat. The images linger in his head and reappear as soon as he shuts his eyes. His body seizes up and he gasps as if he hasn\u2019t taken a breath for several minutes. Distorted faces flash in his memory reminding him of fears he\u2019s tried ignore. He can\u2019t just roll over and go back to sleep anymore and the silence of space only makes his thoughts louder.\n\u00a0\nLance doesn\u2019t sleep.\n\u00a0\nHe feels drawn out, like a car that is running on fumes and sheer willpower. His efforts are commendable, but he can\u2019t keep up with the other paladins. Dark circles appear under his eyes and he gets his ass handed to him consistently in the training room. He doesn\u2019t spring back onto his feet, but instead lays face down in the mats, thankful for the few seconds of rest. He thinks he could probably pass out then and there if Keith wasn\u2019t shrieking at him to \u201cGet up already! Man what is wrong with you?!\u201d.\n\u00a0\nHe knows he has a problem when he starts nodding off in Shiro\u2019s pep talks and he has to apologise profusely for it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be rude,\u201d Lance repeats in one of the castle\u2019s hallways when Shiro has pulled him aside.\n\u201cI swear, I wanna get better! I\u2019m not trying to\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cLance,\u201d And Shiro uses that tone that makes his stomach drop. It sounds just like his older brother, and it floods him with guilt. Shiro looks at him with understanding and concern.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re trying, I\u2019m not accusing you of being lazy.\u201d Shiro places a heavy hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLance worries his bottom lip. He feels immature and stupid. How can he tell this man, someone he\u2019s admired for years, that he can\u2019t sleep because he\u2019s scared? That\u2019s what five year olds say. He\u2019s been swallowed by robot lions and shot at by aliens, what could possibly scare him anymore?\n\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d Lance steps away and rolls his shoulder out of Shiro\u2019s grasp. Hurt flickers on Shiro\u2019s face for just a moment.\n\u201cI think being in space for so long is affecting me. My sleep pattern seems to be off. I\u2019ve just gotta get it back on schedule.\u201d Lance stares at his feet. Shiro purses his lips but doesn\u2019t call him out on his obvious lie. He nods and sighs.\n\u201cOk. I hope you get better.\u201d And he sincerely does.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s 3am that night when Lance concedes defeat and admits that he is not going to get any sleep. He\u2019s exhausted. His eyes sting and his joints ache, but his heart beats thunderously. Fear has a way of pushing someone to their limits, and if Lance were in a better mindset, he\u2019d almost be impressed. The walls of his dull room, devoid of any childhood trinkets or personal touches, starts to feel claustrophobic. He rolls out of bed and begins to stumble down the hall. He doesn\u2019t really have a destination. He entertains the idea of maybe going to the observation deck. The endless expanse of space did have a way of making him sleepy, but his route changes when he hears rustling coming from the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nOh, Hunk. He hums to himself. Hunk is an immeasurable comfort to Lance on this crazy adventure. A shred of home life that keeps him tethered and sane. Lance thinks that he might be able to get some sleep on a couch or something if he knows that Hunk is in the same room. Hunk would do that for him, right? Even if he couldn\u2019t, Lance knows that his friend always comes ready with a hot drink and an understanding smile.\n\u00a0\nLance shuffles dopily into the kitchen, ready to be swept up in his friend\u2019s comforting arms, when he freezes at the counter. Lance chokes a little bit at the back of his throat, making the other paladin turn. Keith\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLance?\u201d\n\u201cKeith?!\u201d\nThe two boys gawk at each other. Lance scans up and down Keith\u2019s body and notices he\u2019s still fully dressed. Gloves, boots, everything, while Lance is in a disheveled t-shirt, saggy boxers and one sock. He must look a mess.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d Lance asks. He leans on the counter, trying to act casual.\n\u201cI never sleep.\u201d Keith shrugs. He takes a sip from his glass.\n\u201cNever sleep or can\u2019t sleep?\u201d Lance asks incredulously. Keith sighs.\n\u201cBit of both. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d He finishes his drink and places his glass in the dish cleaner. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be up, I might as well be productive.\u201d He glances over his shoulder at Lance and his eyes narrow obviously.\n\u201c\u2026You look like shit.\u201d\nLance blusters at the insult but his brain is only running on half cylinders so coming up with a comeback is impossible.\n\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Is all he can manage.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking pretty terrible for a while now.\u201d Keith moves closer. He\u2019s the least eloquent of all the paladins, but also the most honest. Lance wraps his intentions in jokes and innuendo, dodging moments of intimacy at all costs. They\u2019re complete opposites, which usually has them bristling and crackling against one another, but in moments like this there is a rare truce. An understanding where Lance might voluntarily let Keith help him, and Keith actually has the intelligence to tread lightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m too exhausted to rise to your insults now.\u201d Lance flops down onto the counter. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to be the mature one, though that\u2019s hardly surprising.\u201d\nKeith rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t insulting you. I just noticed you\u2019ve not been yourself.\u201d Keith\u2019s voice is uncharacteristically soft. Lance sighs and folds his arms underneath his cheek.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026. It\u2019s been weeks now. I\u2019m not like you.\u201d\n\u201cClearly,\u201d Keith smirks. Lance groans.\n\u201cI mean I actually need sleep to function!\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering why you were so much easier to beat then normal.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations, you managed to defeat a walking corpse. You must be so proud.\u201d Lance\u2019s sarcastic comment makes Keith laugh\u2026 until he notices Lance\u2019s pallid complexion. His eyes are bloodshot, his skin looks like its broken out, and his lips\u2026 which usually look so soft when they\u2019re quirked in a smirk, look chapped and raw. Lance has been worrying on them. He really does look half-dead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you sleep?\u201d\n\u201cNightmares.\u201d\nLance swears at himself. Keith has a way of drawing information out of him. He always has. He waits for the taunting.\n\u201cThat sucks.\u201d Is the only reply. Lance sits up in surprise.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not uh\u2026gonna make fun of me?\u201d\nKeith wrinkles his nose.\n\u201cWhy would I make fun of you. Look at you!\u201d Keith gestures at Lance\u2019s limp form.\n\u201cI can\u2019t make fun of this.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m so pathetic?\u201d Lance deadpans.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pitiful groan and Lance resumes his flopped position. So pathetic even Keith was being nice to him! This was a new low.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to fix this. We can\u2019t form Voltron if you\u2019re in this state.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for voicing all my worries out loud. That\u2019s a huge help for my anxiety right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Keith crosses his arms over his chest.\n\u201cHas this ever happened before?\u201d He presses. Lance\u2019s voice is muffled by the counter.\n\u201cNot this badly.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? But you\u2019ve had nightmares before, right?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2026yeah.\u201d\n\u201cSo then what did you do?\u201d Keith\u2019s voice drops low. He leans on the counter just in front of Lance.\n\nGod, don\u2019t make me say it.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid I used to go climb into bed with my parents.\u201d Lance starts.\n\u201cOk well that\u2019s when you were a kid. What do you do now?\u201d Keith exhales. It\u2019s too late in the night to speak in circles. He needs a solution immediately. Patience has never been his strong suit.\n\u201cI uh\u2026\u201d Lance sits up and nervously scratches his cheek. He worries his lips some more and Keith almost slaps him for it. He\u2019s done enough damage already.\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid\u2026\u201d Lance starts to blush. Keith would think it was cute if this wasn\u2019t such a serious moment.\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not. If it helps then it\u2019s now stupid. C\u2019mon\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI uh\u2026\u201d Lance closes his eyes tightly. Like he\u2019s about to rip off a band aid.\n\u201cI go sleep with my brother.\u201d He spits out. It\u2019s so fast that it takes Keith a few seconds to fully understand it. Lance sighs sharply.\n\u201cThere, you happy? I get so panicky that I can only calm down if I sleep with someone else. It\u2019s stupid and immature\u2026 and and I\u2019m a big baby who needs his brother to go to sleep!\u201d He flails his arms dramatically and pouts. Keith chuckles under his breath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to imagine the tough, macho, Lance whimpering and crawling into bed with his older brother for cuddles.\u201d\n\u201cI said shut up!\u201d\nKaith laughs again, but he\u2019s had his fun. He turns his focus once again to solving this problem.\n\u201cLook it\u2019s fine. Just sleep next to someone then.\u201d Keith shakes his head like it\u2019s the most obvious solution in the world.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Hunk would let you.\u201d\n\u201cHunk\u2019s too big.\u201d Lance pouts. \u201cHe barely fits in his bed himself. If I was in there too neither of us would sleep. We\u2019d have the same problem.\u201d\nKeith nods. That is definitely a point.\n\u201cPidge then?\u201d\n\u201cEhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026.\u201d Lance whines. \u201cI feel weird about it. She\u2019s a girl and all. I don\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable.\u201d\nKeith has to snort at this. Lance? Actually having boundaries when it comes to girls?\n\u201cI thought you hit on anything that identified as female.\u201d He smirks.\n\u201cYeah female adults. Pidge is a child and very off limits. Nooooo thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKeith ponders for some time. He drums his fingers nervously on the counter top and his nails clack against it. There is one very obvious solution, but Keith pushes it at the back of his mind. He pretends it isn\u2019t there, that it\u2019s not even an option. He dodges and goes to the next possibility.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShir\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNOPE.\u201d Lance cuts in before Keith can even finish.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I just\u2026\u201d Lance leans his head in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle that humiliation. And I think I\u2019d be so nervous I wouldn\u2019t ever get to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think I could either.\u201d Keith hums.\n\u201cWell yeah, of course you couldn\u2019t.\u201d Lance snaps under his breath. There\u2019s a meanness to it that Keith isn\u2019t used to.\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, nothing. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not thinking straight.\u201d Lance forces a timid smile. \u201cLook I appreciate you trying to help but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSleep with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd there it is. Keith\u2019s conscience is screaming at him. This is an awful idea. Terrible! He can\u2019t do this. He shouldn\u2019t do this. Because just the thought of lying next to Lance has his mouth filling with saliva and his heart fluttering in his chest. You\u2019re an idiot. An absolute idiot. \n\u00a0\n\u201cW\u2026what?\u201d Lance\u2019s voice breaks. Keith doesn\u2019t hear it over the thudding of his own pulse.\n\u201cYou heard me. Just sleep with me. It doesn\u2019t matter if you keep me awake because I barely sleep anyway.\u201d\nLance blinks at him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nSilence still hangs over them.\n\u201cDo you honestly hate me that much that you won\u2019t even\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo no that\u2019s not it.\u201d Lance exhales. \u201cI just\u2026 are you sure?\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s an uncertainty, a vulnerability in Lance\u2019s expression that makes Keith\u2019s pulse stutter. He collects himself and smiles lazily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re a team right?\u201d He holds his fist out in front of him. Lance sneers and a shred of his usual self sparkles to life. He bumps Keith\u2019s fist and chuckles.\n\u201cTeam Voltron.\u201d.\n\u00a0\nKeith leads them back to his room. It\u2019s a mirror image of Lance\u2019s, except with a few souvenirs from missions are scattered around the place. Lance isn\u2019t able to place them all. A piece of shrapnel, a rock from some distant planet, a pressed flower that some local had given him, Keith has kept them all and placed them lovingly around his room. Clearly his hoarding in his desert shack had not been just a phase, but Lance cherishes this new fact about Keith. He\u2019s sentimental. Lance never would have guessed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t need to be told.\u201d Lance eagerly crawls into the bed and underneath the thin blankets, curling into a tight ball against the corner when he\u2019s settled. He notices how the sheets smell like Keith. He\u2019s been pinned under him enough times in training to recognize that particular blend of citrus and black pepper musk. It\u2019s a pleasant smell, which only annoys Lance more because of course Keith would even smell good.\n\u00a0\nKeith kicks off his boots, gloves and socks, but keeps his t-shirt and pants on as he sidles in next to lance.\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, aren\u2019t you gonna get changed?\u201d Lance mumbles into the pillow.\n\u201cI told you. I barely sleep. If I stay in my clothes then I can just roll out of bed and start working immediately.\u201d Keith reaches by the side of the bed and pulls up his tablet. Allura had given each of the paladins one, in the hopes that they would allow them to communicate and research better. He could always read over battle tactics if Lance needed him to stay in the bed all night.\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, man\u201d, Lance yawns. He can barely keep his eyes open. \u201cPragmatic\u2026. But crazy.\u201d\n\u201cJust go to sleep already.\u201d\n\u201cKeith?\u201d\nKeith flicks through the Altean symbols that appear on his screen.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cThanks for this..\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Keith turns to look Lance in the eye, but he\u2019s already asleep. He\u2019s snoring gently into the pillow and his short hair is a fright. Keith smiles gently and sets his tablet down. Timidly, and with shaking fingers, he brushes Lance\u2019s hair away from his eyes. Butterflies soar in his stomach.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d He whispers.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeith, Keeeeeeiiiiith. Budddyyyyy\u2026.\u201d\nKeith opens his eyes blearily. He registers the wide smile first, then the tan skin, before he finally sees the brown eyes looking down at him.\n\u201cHey there sleepy head,\u201d Lance smirks.\n\u2018Hey! You ok? Did you have a nightmare?! Do you need me to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhoa what?!\u201d Lance catches Keith by the shoulders as he suddenly sits up.\n\u201cNo, no, Hunk made breakfast. I thought you\u2019d like some.\u201d\n\u201cBreakfast? What\u2026.\u201d Keith rubs the sleep from his eyes. \u201cWhy are we\u2026 what time is it?\u201d\n\u201cAbout 9:30.\u201d\n\u201c9:30?!\u201d\nNo. It couldn\u2019t be. Keith hadn\u2019t slept til 7am, let alone 9:30 in years! He hadn\u2019t been bragging when he told Lance that he didn\u2019t sleep. He really didn\u2019t. Insomnia was as much a part of him as his signature haircut. His body had learnt to maximize whatever sleep he got, which was usually only about three good hours a night. He almost always woke up around 6am, hit the training deck, showered, then met Shiro when he finally emerged around eight o\u2019clock.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSooooooo~\u201d Lance\u2019s gaze searches Keith as he stares into space. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d\nKeith is knocked out of his trance.\n\u201cBreakfast?! Yes, yes. Sounds good.\u201d Keith scrambles up. He\u2019s behind schedule. He hasn\u2019t worked out, or showered, or cleaned Red.\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll tell Hunk to make you a plate. You should go shower.\u201d Lance smiles over from the doorway.\n\u201cYeah, ok.\u201d\nLance turns to leave.\n\u2018W\u2026wait!\u201d\nHe freezes. Keith fumbles pulling his boots on.\n\u201cDo you uh\u2026 feel better?\u201d He sneaks a glance up as Lance beams and pushes up his sleeves.\n\u201cMuch better. I really owe you. I\u2019ll save you a plate!\u201d He waves over his shoulder as he heads out into the hall.\nDamn. Keith presses his hands to his heated cheeks. I could get used to this. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nLance still hasn\u2019t fully recovered, it\u2019ll take another full night\u2019s sleep for that, but his reflexes have greatly improved. Keith still tosses him clear across the room, but it takes at least 10 minutes for that to happen.\n\u00a0\nThey run through drills and Lance is able to follow Pidge\u2019s instructions through the invisible electrical maze swiftly. He only gets electrocuted twice, but he would swear that that\u2019s because she lead him into the walls on purpose. He even manages to be one of the final two standing when the paladins go against the drones. He falls through the floor, and Shiro joins them a few seconds later. He ruffles Lance\u2019s hair and speaks quietly so only the two of them can hear.\n\u201cMuch better. Glad you\u2019re looking more yourself.\u201d\nLance flushes at the praise and nods.\n\u00a0\nThey eat dinner enthusiastically together. Coran entertains them with stories of Altean creatures that seem impossible, and the way they used to farm them or ride them around the plains. Keith and Shiro listen politely, Allura interjects with her own experiences, while Hunk, Pidge and Lance make sarcastic comments to one another under their breath. It\u2019s barely 10pm, but Lance can already feel exhaustion catching up with him. His eyelids are heavy and he stifles a few too many yawns. Hunk notices.\n\u201cGo to bed already.\u201d He elbows him in the side. Lance rubs his sensitive ribs.\n\u201cBut I wanna know how Coran survived a grumblestork attack.\u201d Lance smirks.\n\u201cJust go. I don\u2019t wanna have to carry your skinny ass to your bed because you\u2019ve passed out here.\u201d\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Lance sighs and stands. \u201cEven though I\u2019m sure you secretly enjoy carrying me around.\u201d He pushes his chair out and begins to walk back to his room.\n\u201cGoodnight everybody! I\u2019m off to get my beauty sleep, though I hardly think I need it.\u201d He laughs at his own joke. Allura scoffs, Pidge groans, but Keith\u2019s expression is surprisingly blank. He locks eyes with Lance in a moment of unvoiced questioning. Lance\u2019s smug expression drops and he nods in Keith\u2019s direction.\n\u00a0\nHe walks into his bedroom and closes the door with an exhale.\n\u201cOk,\u201d He shucks off his jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s try this.\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n2am. It\u2019s 2am when Keith hears the aggressive rapping on his door. He\u2019s cleaning his bayard, but tosses it off the bed and runs over to the door. He yanks it open, half expecting someone to say that the Galra are attacking, but instead he just sees Lance. Shirtless, sweaty, and trembling in the dark hallway.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGet in here,\u201d Keith whispers. He gently tugs Lance into the room and guides him over to the bed. He wraps a blanket around his shoulders in attempt to stop him shivering. Lance\u2019s eyes are rimmed with red.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d be ok,\u201d He spits. He hasn\u2019t made eye-contact with Keith once, too ashamed of what he\u2019s been reduced to.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Hey\u2026\u201d Keith sinks next to him on the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. You can come here as much as you need.\u201d\n\u201cAugh,\u201d Lance flops over and groans into the pillow. \u201cI hate this.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Keith smirks. He crawls next to Lance and steals back some of his blanket. He lets his hand trail over Lance\u2019s bicep. He tries to make it seem casual, but he checks to see if Lance has stopped shaking. He has, but his skin is still sticky from sweat.\n\u201cJust try to get to sleep now. You can feel like a loser in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a comfort.\u201d\nKeith laughs softly. Lance rolls over and places his arms above the blankets. His position mirror Keith\u2019s, with both of them on their back and staring at the ceiling. Keith can feel Lance\u2019s pulse vibrate through the mattress, and the nervous twitching of his toes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you even tired?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d Lance grunts. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of wired right now. It\u2019ll take a while for me to calm down.\u201d Lance glances at Keith next to him. He tries not to notice how fair his skin looks in the dim light, or how his dark hair spills onto the pillow like silk.\n\u201cYou uh\u2026\u201d He swallows. \u201cYou can read if you want. You don\u2019t have to keep me company or anything.\u201d\nKeith just shrugs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually hate you Lance. I want to make sure you\u2019re ok.\u201d\n\u201cPffft, I\u2019m fine. Go back to playing with your sword.\u201d Lance scoffs, but his bravado is weak. Keith scowls and rolls over onto his elbow. He looks down into Lance\u2019s face so he can\u2019t avoid him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are your nightmares about?\u201d\nAnd as Keith predicted, Lance shrinks into himself. He tries to avoid Keith\u2019s gaze, and even attempts to turn onto his side. Keith grabs his shoulder before he can.\n\u201cJ\u2026just you know. Scary stuff\u2026\u201d\n\u201cClearly\u201d. Keith drawls. \u201cIt could make you feel better.\u201d\n\u201cYou leaving me alone would make me feel better.\u201d Lance pouts.\n\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that you are in my bed right now, and I could very easily kick your scrawny ass out in a second.\u201d Keith leans forward threateningly. Lance rises to the taunts.\n\u201cReally, Keith? Offer your help then blackmail me with it?\u201d\n\u201cYou make helping you so damn difficult.\u201d Keith flops back down. They both stare at the ceiling in suffocating silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re about my family.\u201d\nIt\u2019s barely audible, but Lance\u2019s words are unmistakable in the stillness of the room.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Usually about them getting hurt somehow. Like I fail up here\u2026. I can\u2019t protect them. And they all die.\u201d\n\u201cJeez,\u201d Keith closes his eyes. Yeah, he could understand how that would fuck you up. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been happening for?\u201d\n\u201cMonths?\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Lance.\u201d Keith rolls over with a reprimanding look. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone sooner? We could have helped you.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you supposed to help me?\u201d Lance hisses. He knows Keith means well, but he\u2019s already run through every possibility.\n\u201cUnless you can give me a wormhole that pops me back into my family\u2019s kitchen, there\u2019s nothing you can do for me.\u201d He closes his eyes and steals himself.\n\u201cThey probably think I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Keith snaps. He needs to get Lance out of this spiral. He settles down next to the taller boy and soothingly rubs his arm. A little thrill goes down his spine when Lance doesn\u2019t pull away.\n\u201cTell me what you miss about them.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Lance barks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get sappy on you.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019m building a bank of blackmail material here.\u201d Keith smiles and Lance is thankful for it.\n\u201cThe noise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat noise?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Lance rolls over so their faces are just inches from each other. Their hands touch on the pillow.\n\u201cLike I miss all the noise that was always there. Whether it was just my parents yelling at my siblings, a tv in the living room, my little sister blaring her terrible music, there was always just a bunch of noise. Space is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSilent.\u201d Keith offers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead! It creeps me out!\u201d There\u2019s a hint of a smile on Lance\u2019s lips. Keith feels relief bloom in his chest. He pushes again.\n\u201cWhat else do you miss?\u201d\n\u201cOh man, so many things. Birthdays are a big thing.\u201d\n\u201cBut they only happen once a year?\u201d\n\u201cOh ho ho,\u201d Lance shakes his head. \u201cFoolish child. Not in my household. Between me and my four siblings, parents, grandparents, my oldest brother\u2019s kids\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an uncle?\u201d Keith starts. It\u2019s weird finding out how little he knows about his fellow teammate. Dozens of mind melds in Voltron, and he never once figured out just how large Lance\u2019s family was. He supposes this explains a lot of Lance\u2019s outgoing behaviours. It\u2019s probably hard to get noticed in such a busy household.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, man.\u201d Lance smiles lazily. \u201cNiece and nephew. I\u2019m by far their favorite uncle. My brother, Tony, the one I told you helps me out, he\u2019s always trying to get them to say he\u2019s their favorite.\u201d Lance laughs to himself, remembering something that Keith has no way of relating to.\n\u201cBut they won\u2019t! They never will! Uncle Lance has trained them too well.\u201d\n\u201cYou and Tony close then?\u201d Keith likes the easiness in their conversation. The way Lance\u2019s eyes light up and the excitement in his voice is infectious.\n\u201cOh yeah, Tone and I are definitely the closest.\u201d Lance cringes and laughs. \u201cWe both got crazy into the Fast and Furious movies\u2026\u2019\n\u201cOh god, they\u2019re terrible\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know! I know!\u201d Lance laughs. \u201cBut we just loved them! I didn\u2019t have my license yet, but Tones did, and he\u2019d drive us down to the beach blaring Don Omar songs. We\u2019d take the corners a bit too quickly and it\u2019d make us feel like drift kings.\u201d\nKeith giggles at the image. He\u2019s seen the way Lance whoops and hollers when he pilots Blue. It\u2019s all too easy to see the kind of damage he would inflict behind the wheel of a car.\n\u201cI miss dumb things like that.\u201d Lance sighs. \u201cLittle rituals and traditions like that. Decades worth of inside jokes you know?\u201d\nKeith hums. He doesn\u2019t know, but he notices the way Lance and Hunk talk to each other when no one\u2019s around. It\u2019s impossible to understand, because they\u2019re intimate references and jokes. Practically a conversation entirely in code, based on years of shared Garrison experiences.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, how do you do it?\u201d Lance\u2019s smile turns sad. \u201cHow do deal with the homesickness?\u201d\nKeith shrugs.\n\u201cDon\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta. Everyone misses their family at least a little bit.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s eyes narrow. He looks into Lance\u2019s face, expecting to see a sneer at the cruel joke he\u2019s made, but Keith finds nothing there. Just an earnest and honest smile waiting to hear his answer.\nWait\u2026 Keith\u2019s brain clicks.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Lance\u2019s smile still stupidly stretches across his cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t have a family, Lance.\u201d\nConfusion.\n\u201cI\u2019m an orphan.\u201d\nThe dread on Lance\u2019s face is immediate. His eyes widen and his mouth goes slack. He sits up suddenly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeith\u2026I\u2026I didn\u2019t know.\u201d There\u2019s the edge of panic in his voice. How could he have not known?! Lance thinks back to every conversation he\u2019s had with Keith. How had he not known he had NO ONE. He lived in a desert shack for God\u2019s sake! People with parents don\u2019t do that?!\n\u201cStupid,\u201d he spits at himself. And he\u2019s just been talking about his family for the past 10 minutes. Just rubbing Keith\u2019s nose in it.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d He turns towards Keith. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have\u2026. God I feel like such a\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLance!\u201d Keith sits up and runs his hand up Lance\u2019s arm again. He immediately melts under the touch.\n\u201cI wanted you to tell me about your family. Don\u2019t start pitying me now. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d Keith gives his arm another reassuring squeeze.\n\u201cEspecially from someone who can\u2019t even sleep in their own bed at night.\u201d Keith grins. Lance rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI still feel like an ass.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but what else is new?\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lance punches him lightly in the shoulder. Keith chuckles and flops back onto the mattress.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m used to not having a family.\u201d\nThe words are said matter-of-factly, but they still make Lance\u2019s chest tighten. No one should have to say those words. Lance worries his lip.\n\u00a0\nThen an idea strikes.\n\u201cShare mine!\u201d He surges forward, placing his hands on either side of Keith\u2019s head. He looks down on him with a brilliant smile. It\u2019s a position Keith\u2019s fantasized about, and his breath catches in his throat.\n\u201cW\u2026what?!\u201d\n\u201cShare mine!\u201d Lance presses again. \u201cOh man, I will pay you to take my little sister. She is such a pain in the ass.\u201d\n\u201cSounds endearing.\u201d\n\u201cHer name is Lisa and she will love you. They all will, but let Lisa braid your hair just once? Now you\u2019ve got a sidekick for life.\u201d Lance laughs and leans onto his elbow.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve practically adopted Hunk, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019d adore you. They\u2019d be all \u2018Oh so you were top of the class? Wow! And you\u2019re so pretty and muscular! Not at all like my scrawny and awkward son!\u2019\u201d\nKeith lifts his head and practically cackles at Lance\u2019s hilarious impression of his mother. He tries to focus on that instead of the fact that Lance just called him pretty and muscular.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut yeah, when we get back to Earth you\u2019ve totally gotta come back with me.\u201d Lance hums and sinks into the pillow.\n\u201cWhen we get back to Earth?\u201d Keith\u2019s laughter fades.\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t want anything to do with me anymore.\u201d\nLance\u2019s brows crease. Keith\u2019s words make him go cold. Was this how he thought Lance felt?\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d He reaches out to jostle Keith\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe had a bonding moment remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even remember.\u201d Keith chuckles to disguise the hurt in his voice.\n\u201cI\u2019ll remember this.\u201d Lance whispers. He squeezes Keith\u2019s shoulder earnestly. It makes his heart ache. How can Lance say such honest things without blushing?\n\u201cW\u2026we should get some sleep.\u201d He stammers and turns away from Lance\u2019s dazzling smile. Lance chuckles.\n\u201cOk, ok. I get it.\u201d He turns on his side, now facing the opposite way to Keith.\n\u201cI meant it though.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence from Keith\u2019s side, but that doesn\u2019t deter Lance.\n\u201cI hope you like surfing. There\u2019s this beach we always go to. You don\u2019t look like much of a swimmer, but I\u2019m sure we can fix that.\u201d He shifts his position so that his feet touch Keith\u2019s ankles.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably too skinny\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOD YOUR FEET ARE FREEZING!\u201d Keith deals him a swift kick underneath the blankets, trying to escape the icy toes. Lance tries his hardest to keep his feet on Keith at all costs.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeeeeeeith~ Keeeeeiiiithy baby~\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce again Keith is woken up and immediately assaulted with Lance\u2019s smile.\n\u201cSorry, I let you sleep in again.\u201d\nThe mattress sinks with Lance\u2019s weight. A warm mug is thrust into Keith\u2019s hands. \u201cHere, I know how you like it.\u201d\nKeith gratefully raises the mug to his lips. The liquid is warm and mild, with just a bit of sweetness. It\u2019s as close to tea as he\u2019s going to get on an alien space craft.\n\u201c\u2019time isit?\u201d He slurs.\n\u201cClose to 10.\u201d\nKeith groans. Again? Why was this happening? He decides a good night\u2019s sleep is grossly overrated. It wastes his time and leaves him slow and groggy the next morning.\n\u201cSorry. I should\u2019ve woken you up earlier.\u201d Lance scratches his neck sheepishly.\n\u201c\u2019sfine.\u201d Keith takes another sip of his drink. Lance shouldn\u2019t have to take care of him like this. He should be able to wake up on his own.\n\u201cI uh\u2026 also brought you this.\u201d Lance places a bowl of warm porridge into his lap. A smiley face has been drawn on top with a spice resembling cinnamon.\n\u201cThought you might like breakfast in bed. I noticed you like to keep to yourself in the morning.\u201d\nKeith stares at the bowl in his lap. The obvious care that went into it, as well as the thoughtfulness behind it, warms his insides.\n\u201cLance, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do\u2026after last night.\u201d Lance casts his gaze to the ground. His ears burn scarlet.\n\u201cWELL! I\u2019ve got a lot to do! Gonna run some drills with Blue, I think the old girl misses me.\u201d Lance quickly shuffles to the door. Keith shakes his head after him.\n\u201cLance,\u201d\n\u201cHmmm?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t forget.\u201d\nLance softens. He brushes his hair back with his fingers.\n\u201cNah man. Never.\u201d And he beams.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re running the drones simulation again. Everyone is out, even Shiro, but Keith and Lance still dance on the floor. Their shields are up and they step around each other in a skilled rhythm.\n\u201cLance, your right!\u201d\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Lance whips around and blocks a shot aimed for his leg. Keith goes down on one knee and protects Lance\u2019s stomach from a second laser.\n\u201cYour left!\u201d Lance shouts and throws his shield down before a shot grazes Keith\u2019s ear.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\nLance offers a hand, and pulls Keith swiftly to his feet in time for both of them to raise their shields and protect the other\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Allura\u2019s voice crackles in Shiro\u2019s helmet. He watches from the side, having come out from beneath the training floor some time ago.\n\u201cFive minutes maybe? I\u2019ve lost track.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen them like this. Did you say something to them?\u201d\n\u201cNothing out of the ordinary. I\u2019m as amazed as you.\u201d\n\u201cKeith!\u201d Lance dives in front of his partner, narrowly blocking a laser from hitting the back of his shoulder. Lance falls clumsily on the ground. Keith throws his shield on top of him and risks himself getting hit as another shot is fired towards his stomach.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOk they\u2019re impostors. They have to be. I say we DNA test them.\u201d Pidge offers.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know. They\u2019ve both been trying to make an effort\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLance!\u201d Keith dives on top of Lance, holding his shield behind him. The two fall to the ground, avoiding a barrage of shots that they could have never blocked. They fall onto the ground breathless, staring silently at one another, until their laughter rings out.\n\u201cOK THEY ARE BODY SNATCHERS! WHERE IS MY CHILD?!\u201d Hunk exclaims. Pidge nods in agreement. Panting and tangled in each other on the floor, a drone hits Lance in the ankle and they both fall through. They emerge a short time later, helmets off and covered in sweat. Shiro applauds them and elbows Hunk and Pidge to do the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery impressive boys.\u201d Shiro smiles and saunters forward. \u201cI\u2019d hardly believe it, if I didn\u2019t just watch you with my own two eyes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal really. You act like me being awesome is unusual.\u201d Lance sighs and clicks a finger gun towards Hunk. His friend approaches cautiously. Hunk closely examines his face, prods his ribs and even sticks a finger in his mouth.\n\u201cBro!\u201d Lance steps away.\n\u201cI\u2019m just making sure!\u201d Hunk scratches his chin.\n\u201cI still say we take a biopsy.\u201d Pidge murmurs. Keith and Lance send identical scowls her way.\n\u201cLook, I was in a funk for a while, but now I\u2019ve sorted some things out and feel a lot better. Because I\u2019m no longer struggling with that, my tolerance for Keith has doubled.\u201d Lance holds his hand up in surrender.\n\u201cMy tolerance has stayed the same. I\u2019m just a professional about it.\u201d Keith rubs his helmet visor idly.\n\u201cExcuse me, but I think you\u2019re far more petty than me. We can all agree that I am the mature one.\u201d\n\u201cYou carried a grudge all the way from the Garrison!\u201d\n\u201cYou did too!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a grudge against someone I didn\u2019t even know existed!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t\u2026even\u2026!\u201d\n\u201cOk, there they are.\u201d Shiro groans. They had been so close too.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s late and the effort of their training session is catching up with Lance. They\u2019re all seated around a board on the floor, playing some sadistic Altean version of monopoly. Pidge is cleaning up, and Coran has to reprimand Keith several times for not following the rules. Lance leans against Hunk\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s comfortable and at just the right height for Lance to doze on. He\u2019ll occasionally roll and move his piece when prompted, but he\u2019s pretty much lost track of the game. Hunk feels his shoulder start to become damp with Lance\u2019s drool.\n\u201cOkaaaay, I think it\u2019s time for me to carry off this guy to bed.\u201d\nThe others look up and chuckle at Lance\u2019s sleeping face. Hunk begins to shift his weight, when Keith springs up next to him.\n\u201cI can take him.\u201d He offers. Hunk blinks at him in confusion. Pidge guffaws, and Shiro smirks to himself.\n\u201cW\u2026what? Keith, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d Hunk explains.\n\u201cNo I got it.\u201d And before Hunk can protest again, Keith bends down and braces Lance against his side. He tosses one of his arms across the back of his neck, and he holds his middle tightly.\n\u201cMmmm bed?\u201d Lance drunkenly asks. Keith rolls his eyes.\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Going to bed. Now help me out by walking.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Kay~\u201d\nThey shuffle out of the room with five pairs of eyes staring after them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDNA tests. I\u2019m telling you!\u201d Pidge thrusts her index finger into Shiro\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nLance isn\u2019t particularly heavy, but he is taller than Keith, which makes supporting him slightly more difficult. Thankfully, Lance is starting to wake up more now. Enough that he can walk himself, and enough that he seems to know where he is. They reach the outside of his bedroom door and he makes a small whimper of protest. Keith stops.\n\u201cY\u2026yours? Can I\u2026?\u201d\nAnd with heavy lidded eyes and a breathy voice\u2026 how could Keith possibly say no?\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt becomes routine. Lance doesn\u2019t even hesitate to waltz into Keith\u2019s room at night. He\u2019s got a small stack of underwear building up in the corner, and Keith barely blinks when he strips down to his briefs and crawls across him on the bed to take up his usual spot next to the wall. Keith\u2019s sleep pattern has not corrected itself, but he\u2019s getting used to the idea of actually sleeping through the night. Because of this though, he\u2019s had to actually listen to Lance\u2019s advice and start sleeping in just his t-shirt and boxers. No more fully clothed nights, ready to spring into action at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\u00a0\nBut along with routine comes a level of closeness that Keith was not prepared for. He frequently wakes up wrapped in Lance\u2019s limbs, a mess of arms around his middle and feet tangled around his ankles. He feels Lance\u2019s breath on the back of his neck, and goose bumps raise along his spine. He cherishes the feeling of Lance\u2019s skin against his, but he knows he shouldn\u2019t get used to it. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t mean anything, he repeats to himself when he leaves to use the bathroom, and returns to find Lance blindly searching for him. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, he whispers under his breath when his weight hits the mattress and Lance\u2019s arms immediately ensnare him and pull him against his naked chest.\n\u00a0\nKeith can\u2019t get enough of the feeling. Just because it doesn\u2019t mean anything, doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t enjoy the sensation. He starts to chase it in training when they spar together. He probably grapples with Lance more than he should, presses him against the floor longer than is necessary, sits straddling his waist when Lance is spent and makes a time out motion with his hands.\n\u00a0\nKeith is in the showers after one such session when Shiro approaches him. His hair is damp, but he\u2019s fully dressed. Keith sits just in his boxers with his towel draped over his head. His eyes are closed and he\u2019s in somewhat of a meditative state.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, good job out there today.\u201d\nShiro\u2019s voice snaps him awake.\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He breathes. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nShiro sits down next to him.\n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed with how far Lance has come. It\u2019s been really good for him to have you showing such an interest in his training.\u201d\n\u201cWell he needs it.\u201d Keith jabs. Shiro chuckles.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve sure been dedicated lately.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team. We\u2019re only as strong as our weakest link. We all need to be on the same page.\u201d\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Shiro hums. \u201cI suppose.\u201d He stands and rubs the towel on top of Keith\u2019s head. He pulls away with a grunt. Shiro laughs.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen you smile like that when you spar with anyone else.\u201d And he leaves.\nJust leaves Keith with his red face and stammering mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nThat night is the first night Keith witnesses one of the infamous nightmares. He\u2019s woken up by the mattress shifting next to him and small breathy noises. He rolls over, half expecting Lance to just be settling back into bed after using the bathroom, when he gets a good look at the boy next to him. Keith is instantly awake. Lance has gritted his teeth and his fingers clutch the sheets so tightly that his knuckles turn white. His hair is slicked to his forehead with sweat, the hairs on his skin are raised, and he trembles violently. Shallow, desperate breaths pass through his nose.\n\u201cLance!\u201d Keith worries. He wraps his arms around him and begins to stroke his hair. Lance\u2019s body is stiff and taut.\n\u201cLance, Lance, shhhhh, wake up,\u201d He whispers louder. He runs his hands over Lance\u2019s arms and sides in a coaxing motion. Lance\u2019s hands loosen their grip on the sheets and his eyes, that were clenched shut, seem to relax and flutter open just a tad. His body goes limp against Keith\u2019s hands.\n\u201cKeith?\u201d His voice is wrecked.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m here. It\u2019s ok. You\u2019re safe. Everyone\u2019s safe. It was just a bad dream.\u201d Keith presses their foreheads together and continues to rub circles against Lance\u2019s bony shoulders.\n\u201cOh, Keith,\u201d Half dazed, but desperate and shaking, Lance pushes forward and wraps his arms around Keith\u2019s shoulders. He buries his face in Keith\u2019s neck and presses their bodies together.\n\u201cKeith, Keith,\u201d He breathes against Keith\u2019s skin.\n\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here.\u201d Keith\u2019s hands begin to tangle themselves in Lance\u2019s hair and stroke invisible lines up and down his spine. Tears prickle at the corner of his eyes. He has Lance completely wrapped up in his arms. The other boy clings to him and is panting his name, but it\u2019s not in the context he\u2019s always desired. He can\u2019t have this. Not really. Not in the way he wants. Not in the way his body craves.\n\u201cKeith\u2026 need you\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d And it\u2019s too much. Keith presses his face into the side of Lance\u2019s head, hoping his tears will disappear in the short, brown hair there.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nKeith wakes up, and he thinks he might have actually woken up before Lance for once, until he sees the other boy laying beside him with his eyes open and hands tucked behind his head in thought. Keith\u2019s breathing changes and Lance notices.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he gives a sleepy smile.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Keith croaks. \u201cAre you ok? Did you\u2026.?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lance laughs. \u201cThanks to you.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s chest tightens. No. He does not need this first thing in the morning.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I told you I would help you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well,\u201d Lance rolls over and touches Keith\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was really in a bad way last night. That\u2019s what I\u2019d been dealing with on my own this whole time.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Lance. I wish you\u2019d told me sooner.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You were there for me yesterday. You did everything I needed and more.\u201d Lance tries to laugh away his embarrassment. \u201cI really owe you.\u201d\n\u201cMmmm, breakfast in bed sure sounds nice.\u201d Keith offers. Lance chuckles and the sound warms Keith\u2019s stomach better than hot tea ever could.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\nThey lay there for some time, breathing in the smell of citrus and black pepper permanently embedded into Keith\u2019s sheets, though Lance\u2019s side has started to smell more like him. Keith\u2019s noticed the smell of ocean spray lingering even when Lance is no longer around.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKeith,\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really helped me. And I think I\u2019m ready to start trying to sleep in my own room again.\u201d\nIt feels like someone has whipped Keith\u2019s warm blanket off of him. His body freezes and the wind is knocked out of him.\n\u201cO\u2026oh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s about time I give it another shot. I can\u2019t sleep with you forever now.\u201d\nYou could though. Oh god, you could. Keith wants to whisper the words into his mouth. His lips look soft again. With his improved sleep pattern he\u2019s stopped chewing on them excessively.\n\u201cYou\u2026 You can always come back. If you need I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Lance beams. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I think I\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nKeith hates this. He hates the cold spot next to him on the mattress. He hates how quiet it is without the sound of Lance\u2019s gentle breathing, but most of all, Keith hates that he can\u2019t fucking sleep.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only been the past few weeks that Keith has been able to sleep, but the consecutive nights of eight hours or more rest has completely ruined his rhythm. Not sleeping has been a constant for Keith, but now he feels sluggish and irritated during the day. He\u2019s clumsy when polishing his bayard and he nicks himself. His headaches are brutal, and he snaps at his teammates. His arguments with Lance have increased tenfold, in both frequency and aggression. Even Lance seems shocked at the outbursts, but he doesn\u2019t take it personally. Especially when he sees Keith snap at Shiro. Shiro levels the smaller boy with a harsh glare.\n\u201cRemember\u2026.who you are talking to.\u201d Shiro growls. Keith seems to remember himself and apologises in a weak and nervous voice.\n\u00a0\nAll of their synergy from the previous week\u2019s drone drill is gone. Keith is the first one out. It\u2019s unheard of. He falls through the floor with a weak groan and doesn\u2019t come back up for several minutes. He just lays on the mat wondering what he did to deserve this.\n\u00a0\nAllura pushes them to do a Voltron drill and it\u2019s almost unbearable. With the Paladins all linked together, Keith\u2019s negativity is contagious. It floods his team member\u2019s minds and they struggle to keep Voltron in tact.\n\u201cGuys\u2026 I\u2019ve gotta\u2026.\u201d Hunk sounds like he\u2019s going to be sick.\n\u201cI hear ya. Voltron disassemble. We can\u2019t do anything like this.\u201d Shiro commands.\n\u00a0\nThey pull apart, and even Allura seems to get that something has gone wrong. That another drill won\u2019t solve this. She looks at the woeful state of her Paladins. No one says anything to Keith, but he can feel everyone\u2019s eyes on him. When their linked, it\u2019s hard to exactly pinpoint which thoughts and feelings belong to who, but he feels like everyone must have worked it out. He\u2019s the only one looking ragged despite the relatively simple exercise.\n\u00a0\nHe needs to fix this.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nMidnight. There\u2019s a tentative knock on Lance\u2019s door.\n\u201cHunk, I\u2019m not trying\u2026\u201d But it\u2019s Keith on the other side. His voice immediately drops to a low whisper.\n\u201cOh, Keith? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nKeith scratches his arm nervously.\n\u201cC\u2026can I sleep with you?\u201d His cheeks burn. God, how could he be doing this?\nLance blinks at him. Then his face pulls into a smug expression.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t stay away, huh?\u201d\n\u201cLance, Please!\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok, come in.\u201d He guides Keith into the room.\n\u201cDo you want next to the wall or your usual spot?\u201d\n\u201cUsual thanks.\u201d Before Keith can really question what he\u2019s doing, he kicks off his boots and is slipping off his pants. Lance can see the rush and panic in his movements.\n\u201cWhoa, slow down. Are you even gonna tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lance stills Keith\u2019s hands. He holds them by the wrists as he\u2019s about to rip off his shirt.\n\u201cI uh\u2026. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were used to that?\u201d\n\u201cI was, I was, but\u2026 for some reason\u2026 augh it\u2019s crazy\u2026.\u201d Keith rubs his temples.\n\u201cTry me.\u201d\nIt feels weird to have their roles switched. Now Keith can fully appreciate just how meek Lance must have felt when coming to him for help.\n\u201cWhen you were with me, I could sleep. And I was. And now I\u2019m used to it, so if you take sleep away\u2026 I can\u2019t handle it!\u201d Keith collapses on the edge of the bed.\n\u201cUsually I\u2019d just fight through it. Re-set my body clock, you know? But we don\u2019t have time for that. The Galra could attack any day. You felt Voltron today!\u201d\n\u201cOh god, that was you?\u201d Lance takes a seat next to Keith. He nods.\n\u201cThat was terrible. It felt like somebody had told me that every puppy in the universe had died.\u201d\n\u201cYeah well\u2026 that\u2019s the state I\u2019m in right now.\u201d\n\u201cMan, you do not handle fatigue well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019d figured that out.\u201d\nLance shakes his head and laughs. He crawls over and slides himself underneath the blankets, before holding a side open for Keith.\n\u201cWell, come on then. The sooner you get to sleep the sooner we can fix this.\u201d\nKeith smiles. He\u2019s missed this. God has he needed this. He wraps the blanket tight around his shoulders and the smell of ocean spray and aloe vera is intoxicating.\nHe\u2019s unconscious before Lance can even wish him goodnight.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nIt feels like coming home after a rough trip abroad. It\u2019s comfortable and familiar, and Keith runs around the next morning with a spring in his step. He\u2019s much lighter on his feet when he spars against Shiro, and he offers to help Allura restore some of the Castle\u2019s less vital functions.\n\u00a0\nAllura worries about them forming Voltron again, but she knows the paladins can\u2019t let the day before get them down. She has them try the mind link simulator again and they are able to form Voltron with ease. A vibration of optimism hums through them all.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s clear to both Keith and Lance that what they have is important. It maintains a balance that cannot be upset. Each one thinks the other will get sick of it and kick them out, but neither of them ever says anything. Their nights are warm and intimate. Their limbs automatically seek each other out, and they stay up late whispering and laughing into their pillows. Lance talks more about the shenanigans he used to commit with his brother, Tony, and how much he misses strawberry and banana smoothies. Keith listens intently. He tries to imagine Lance cutting off his sister\u2019s hair or breeding frogs in his backyard without his parents finding out. Keith tells him how he misses sunsets and campfires.\n\u00a0\nThey are curled up together one lazy morning. Keith is vaguely aware of Lance\u2019s arm around his waist and his other touching his hand on the pillow between them. Lance blinks his eyes awake and groans.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be morning already.\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Keith sighs. There\u2019s still sleep in his eyes.\n\u201cI think we deserve a day off.\u201d Lance croaks. He closes his eyes with a dumb smile and pulls their two bodies closer together. Keith lets out an embarrassing gasp when their stomachs touch.\n\u201cThe Galra don\u2019t take a day off.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Lance\u2019s eyebrows crinkle. He peeks up at Keith through thick lashes.\n\u201cIf I ask you nicely, will you bring me breakfast in bed?\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know. What have you done for me lately?\u201d Lance pouts, and Keith hates how it makes him want to rush forward and kiss his frown off of him. Instead he just smirks and laughs airily.\n\u201cI have been nothing but nice to you lately.\u201d Lance flexes his fingers and they stroke Keith\u2019s spine.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been\u2026.\u201d Keith grins. \u201cTolerable.\u201d He laughs at Lance\u2019s wounded face. He sighs and wiggles closer, wrapping his arm over Lance\u2019s shoulder and pressing their foreheads together.\n\u201cFiiiiiine, tell me what you want.\u201d He concedes.\nLance beams and opens his mouth to answer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Lance! Wake up, I need you to help\u2026meeee\u2026.\u201d\nHunk bursts through the bedroom door completely uninhibited. His voice crashes into their space and Keith\u2019s naked shoulders suddenly feel cold. His forehead is still pressed into Lance\u2019s and their eyes stare into each other\u2019s, suddenly wide with fear. Their bodies stiffen. Neither breathes. Keith for some reason thinks that if he lies perfectly still, Hunk won\u2019t realise he\u2019s there. Or maybe there\u2019s enough blanket over them that he\u2019ll think he\u2019s Lance? Oh god, the blanket barely covers their hips. Keith is very obviously half naked in Lance\u2019s bed, and Lance\u2019s hands are very obviously splayed against Keith\u2019s pale back and shit fuck shit shit fuck!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll uh\u2026 I can see you two are busy\u2026. Never mind. It can wait.\u201d Hunk\u2019s voice cracks every which way and he practically slams the door as he scuttles out. Keith comes to his senses first.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d He snaps into action. He\u2019s out of the bed and careening into the hallway after Hunk before Lance can even take a breath. Keith\u2019s legs buckle under him, not yet used to supporting his weight after eight hours of lying down. The ship\u2019s air is cold on his mostly naked body, but he doesn\u2019t stop to throw anything on. He darts into the kitchen where Hunk is very busily making himself some hot tea. His cheeks are very red and he pretends not to see Keith when he runs in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHunk, listen,\u201d\n\u201cOh! H... HelGood morning, Keith.\u201d His hand shakes as he strains the tea into his mug. \u201cDid you sleep well, I mean, did you enjoy, no,\u2026\u201d He takes a loud sip. \u201cGood morning.\u201d He settles on. Keith holds his hands up.\n\u201cLook Hunk, what you just saw\u2026. It\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d Says Keith, the teenage boy with only his boxers on and who was just previously entangled with his equally naked teammate asking him what he wanted for breakfast. WOW did this look bad. Hunk scowls.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just sleeping together!\u201d Keith implores. Okay that may have come out wrong.\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no! I mean\u2026\u201d Keith rubs his face in frustration. \u201cI mean there\u2019s nothing between us. We literally just sleep in the same room.\u201d He sighs and leans on the counter. Hunk cocks an amused eyebrow.\n\u201cLance was having all these terrible night terrors, and I had insomnia and we just\u2026?\u201d Keith bites his lips and makes eye contact with Hunk for the first time. \u201cThis just works, ok? We both sleep better if someone else is there, so this is what we\u2019ve resorted to.\u201d Keith chews the inside of his cheek. \u201cI know\u2026 I know it\u2019s weird. But I really need you to not tell anyone. We\u2019re better as a team when we do this, and I don\u2019t want the others making this uncomfortable.\u201d\nHunk sighs. He nods several times to himself.\n\u201cLance did have some bad bouts of night terrors when he first got into the Garrison.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re the worst.\u201d And despite the dark subject matter, Keith can only laugh. Because this is ridiculous. This whole situation is absurd. Hunk chuckles as well.\n\u201cGod, you two\u2026. So nothing\u2019s happening? You don\u2019t kiss each other goodnight?\u201d He teases, but there\u2019s real concern there.\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d Keith, now feeling more comfortable, speaks quietly. \u201cNothing could ever happen anyway.\u201d\nHunk takes a long sip of his tea but raises his eyebrows curiously.\n\u201cWith Lance being straight and all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHunk loses it. He chokes and splutters on his tea, sending a spray of it onto Keith.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d He half cackles, half shrieks. Pidge toddles into the kitchen in a zombie like state and pours herself some juice behind them.\n\u201cL\u2026Lance is straight.\u201d Keith meekly repeats.\n\u201cHe is not!\u201d Hunk throws his head back and laughs.\n\u201cWha\u2026what?\u201d Keith goes red and he isn\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s from embarrassment or from annoyance.\n\u201cLook, if it walks around on two legs and can flirt? Lance will try to get with it.\u201d Hunk refills his mug after spitting so much of his drink out. \u201cHe is the king of bisexuals.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that? You can\u2019t be sure.\u201d Keith skeptically crosses his arms over his chest.\n\u201cWell I\u2019m pretty sure Lance hitting on me is a pretty good indicator. I think the line was something like \u2018You must be the square root of two, because I feel all irrational around you\u2019.\u201d Hunk shakes his head. \u201cNow if I wasn\u2019t straight, man that would have haaaaad me.\u201d\n\u201cLance uh\u2026 hit on you?\u201d\nHunk doesn\u2019t miss the once over that Keith gives him. He places his mug on the counter and leans forward into Keith\u2019s space. He prods at his chest threateningly.\n\u201cHey man! I will have you know that I am the Garrison cuddling champion and I could bench press you into next week. Lance would be lucky to have me.\u201d His eyes narrow. Keith steps back in surrender.\n\u201cNo, no! I just\u2026 you are very much a guy.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just caught me off guard is all. I still don\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d Keith runs his fingers through his knotted hair.\n\u201cHere, check this out.\u201d Hunk smirks and looks over his shoulder.\n\u201cHey, Pidge. Keith here thinks Lance is straight.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Pidge barks a laugh from where she sits hunched over a bowl of something resembling cereal. She looks up over her spoon at Keith.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d She deadpans and resumes shoveling food into her mouth.\nHunk waves towards her.\n\u201cSee?\u201d\nKeith just nods. He doesn\u2019t say anything more before he leaves to go shower.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s late and a rare night where they are actually given free time to themselves. Lance and Keith are hanging out in Lance\u2019s bedroom, in various states of undress, teeth brushed but not quite ready to call it a night. Lance sits on the bed oiling and reassembling parts of his bayard rifle, and Keith does the same from the chair in the corner. They idly chat about their training, what strange thing they ate for dinner, and other mundane things.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Hunk won\u2019t blab to everyone else?\u201d Lance asks. He\u2019s snaps his bayard back to its resting position.\n\u201cNot really. He seemed to understand.\u201d Keith shrugs. He scratches at a small bit of dirt on his blade.\n\u201cYeah, I tried to talk to him about it but we were never alone today. I felt like he was making fun of me all throughout our drills.\u201d\n\u201cHe probably was. It\u2019s not everyday you catch your best friend spooning the guy he\u2019s supposed to hate.\u201d Keith smirks. He snaps his bayard away and begins to pull off his gloves.\n\u201cOh god, the things he must have thought.\u201d A rush of embarrassment floods through Lance once more. He flops his head into his hands.\n\u201cMy soul honestly left my body when he walked in.\u201d\nKeith chuckles at the memory. In hindsight it is pretty funny.\n\u00a0\nHe begins to pull off his pants and shirt. Lance scoots over on the bed to let him climb in, but Keith instead sits back on the chair. The atmosphere in the room shifts. Lance leans forward anxiously.\n\u201cHey, you uh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re bisexual?\u201d Keith blurts out. Eloquent as always. Lance blusters.\n\u201cUm yeah? Yes?\u201d He looks taken aback. Where the hell was all this coming from?\n\u201cSorry, sorry\u2026 Hunk just mentioned\u2026\u201d Keith rubs the back of his neck. This is none of his business. He shouldn\u2019t pry like this.\nBut a question still burns at the back of his mind, despite all of his rational thoughts.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he tell me?\n\n\u201cWell yeah.\u201d Lance breathes. He pauses for a beat. \u201cWait, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d\nKeith bites his lip and shakes his head.\n\u201cI thought everyone knew!\u201d Lance throws his hands up. \u201cI thought it was obvious.\u201d\n\u201cW\u2026well it\u2019s not.\u201d Keith stands for no particular reason, but he\u2019s having a hard time keeping still. \u201cThese things aren\u2019t that simple.\u201d\nLance scoffs.\n\u201cI think they are.\u201d He leans forward and smiles knowingly. \u201cPeople are pretty easy to figure out.\u201d\n\u201cAre they?\u201d Keith juts out his hip and crosses his arms. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know Pidge was a girl?!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t need to. I already figured out what she was in to.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\u201cScience.\u201d Lance shrugs like it\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world. Keith throws his arms up in exasperation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re gay.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a stale silence. Lance drops his gaze, worrying he\u2019s gone too far. Keith stares at him with his mouth slightly agape. He snaps it shut. He sighs and sinks onto the mattress next to him.\n\u201cLooks like you are better than me at something.\u201d He smirks. Lance elbows him in the ribs.\n\u201cI said it was obvious.\u201d Lance chuckles.\n\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d Keith leans forward, genuine curiosity behind his grin. Lance\u2019s expression drops. His gaze goes to the floor. He nervously licks his lips.\n\u201cI notice how you look at Shiro.\u201d His voice is hushed. Keith\u2019s heart clenches.\n\u201cI know you have a thing for him.\u201d Lance laughs, but it\u2019s hollow. \u201cGod, who wouldn\u2019t right?\u201d\n\u201cLance,\u201d Keith snaps. Something makes him reach out to grab his friend\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a thing for Shiro.\u201d He shakes his head, begging Lance to understand.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me. I\u2019m actually a pretty excellent wingman if you need\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLance!\u201d\nAnd Lance\u2019s mouth snaps shut. This idiot. This absolute idiot. Keith has half a mind to grab his face and furiously kiss that stupid idea away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Shiro! I don\u2019t!\u201d He throws his hands up. Lance still looks skeptical.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Keith sighs. \u201cShiro is\u2026 very dear to me, and yeah he was probably my first crush, but our relationship is strictly friends now.\u201d Keith squeezes Lance\u2019s arm. It\u2019s you, you moron. \n\u201cHe\u2019s too old for me, and he\u2019s now much more of a mentor and brother than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cBut if he asked?\u201d\n\u201cOh well, if he\u2019s asking\u2026.\u201d Keith shrugs, then throws his head back and laughs when he sees how exasperated Lance looks.\n\u201cI\u2019m kidding!\u201d He sighs. He nudges Lance\u2019s thigh with his knee.\n\u201cSo yeah, I am gay. You got that right. Your method was just all wrong.\u201d\n\u201cHey, if the answer is right, who are you to judge my methods?\u201d\nKeith rolls his eyes. He flops back onto the mattress and places his hands behind his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI still don\u2019t believe you\u2019re bi. I\u2019ve only seen you hit on girls.\u201d\n\u201cCorrection!\u201d Lance holds up an index finger. \u201cYou\u2019ve only seen me hit on girl aliens. Coincidentally, all the male aliens we\u2019ve run into have not been my type.\u201d\n\u201cSeems implausible.\u201d Keith drawls.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d Lance laughs. \u201cThe Balmerans? The only do-able guy there was Shay\u2019s brother, and he was an asshole. You turn in my best friend? Guess what? You\u2019ve just entered the no-bone zone.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Keith exhales.\n\u201cArusians? They\u2019re oversized guinea pigs. Can\u2019t be having that.\u201d\n\u201cYou seemed pretty smitten with Nyma\u2026 why was Rolo excluded?\u201d Keith wonders out loud.\n\u201cAh well\u2026\u201d Lance flushes. \u201cRolo had that weird nose thing\u2026. I thought he would hurt to make out with.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Keith flails on the bed. \u201cYou are the most ridiculous\u2026.!\u201d He sits up suddenly.\n\u201cYou never made a pass at Shiro? What\u2019s up with that?\u201d\n\u201cShiro is an adult. And my leader. You said so yourself.\u201d Lance pulls back. Why is Keith so fixated on this? There\u2019s an urgency to his questioning.\n\u201cAlso he is wildly out of my league.\u201d He laughs. Keith nods at that. Lance gasps and punches him in the shoulder.\n\u201cHey! You\u2019re not supposed to agree with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say? You make good points.\u201d\n\u201cJeez.\u201d\nKeith leans against Lance\u2019s side. He looks up at him with a mischievous grin.\n\u201cSo Hunk, huh?\u201d\nIt takes Lance a few seconds to comprehend his meaning.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Lance pulls away. \u201cHe told you about that?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Keith pulls away. He starts to tuck himself under the blankets.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost insulted.\u201d He mumbles to himself, hoping Lance doesn\u2019t catch it.\n\u00a0\nBut Lance does. His eyebrows knit in confusion.\n\u201cInsulted wha\u2026?\u201d\nThen his eyes light up. A wide smile stretches across his features.\n\u201cKeeeeeeeith? Keeeeithy baby~\u201d He crawls over until he\u2019s looking down into Keith\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m tired now.\u201d He snaps.\n\u201cCould you actually be\u2026.?!\u201d Lance fake gasps incredibly loudly. \u201cOh my god, Keithy. Sweetie. Baby. Red-paladin of my life\u2026.are you actually jeeeeaaaalous?\u201d Lance waggles his eyebrows. Keith makes a noise like a drowning duck. He uses his grappling skills to fling Lance off of him and smash him onto the bed.\n\u201cI said time to sleep!\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOD YOU ARE!\u201d Lance howls. Keith pushes his face into the mattress. Maybe if he does it hard enough he\u2019ll smother him.\n\u201cI SAID SLEEP!\u201d\nHe lets go and pointedly rolls over so that he\u2019s got his back towards Lance.\n\u201cHey, Keith\u2026\u201d Lance\u2019s hand reaches out to touch Keith\u2019s arm. Keith slaps it away.\n\u201cHey no, serious talk now. Come on\u2026\u201d Lance\u2019s voice is soothing. Keith likes to think he\u2019s the only one who gets to hear Lance soft and gentle like this. He reluctantly rolls over.\n\u201cYou uh\u2026 you didn\u2019t know that I liked guys before. So if this\u2026\u201d Lance gestures to both of them lying in the bed. \u201cIf this makes you uncomfortable. Or if you don\u2019t want to do this anymore, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nKeith smiles lazily. This boy is going to be the death of him.\n\u201cThank you, Lance.\u201d He reaches up to firmly squeeze Lance\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine. Really. I\u2019m still here aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nLance\u2019s eyes crinkle at the sides when he smiles.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nKeith hums and rolls over again. He switches off the light and pulls the blanket around his shoulders. The mattress shifts next to him and he feels Lance\u2019s breath against his ear.\n\u201cHey baby, you must be an astronaut, because your ass is out of this world.\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d Keith rounds on him and pins him to the bed. He shoves a pillow over his face, but it does little to drown the sound of Lance\u2019s hysterical laughter.\n\u201cI hate you! I hate you! Why are you like this?!\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKeith is many things. Impulsive, impatient, skeptical, socially inept\u2026 he\u2019s been described as all of these things, and to be honest, he doesn\u2019t disagree with them.\n\u00a0\nBut he\u2019s never been called selfish.\n\u00a0\nBut he is. Keith is becoming incredibly selfish.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s selfish in how he hoards all of Lance\u2019s touches throughout the night. He sometimes lays there, just watching Lance sleep, committing to memory the way his mouth angles itself when it\u2019s slack and how his eyebrows sometimes crinkle when he\u2019s dreaming.\n\u00a0\nKeith will sometimes prop himself up on his elbow during the few lucky mornings he wakes up before Lance, and watch his chest rise and fall in an easy rhythm. He reaches out, guiltily, and runs his fingers through his short hair. He brushes the strands out of his face and relishes how Lance seems to lean into his touch.\n\u00a0\nKeith is selfish.\n\u00a0\nHis chest aches.\n\u00a0\nKeith\u2019s self indulgence reaches a peak the night Lance has another nightmare. There\u2019s shuffling and a wild foot collides with his shin, startling him awake. Lance is facing away from him, but it\u2019s obvious what is happening. The room is filled with small, distressed noises and Lance\u2019s fingers twitch against the sheets. Keith feels calmer this time. He\u2019s gotten Lance out of this before. He wraps an arm around his warm belly and pulls him against his chest.\n\u201cLance, Lance\u2026.\u201d Keith coos and pets his hair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay. Everything\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\nLance melts against him. There\u2019s a small gasp of breath indicating that he\u2019s somewhat awake now, and one of his hands holds onto Keith\u2019s as it strokes up and down his stomach in calming motions. Lance laces their fingers together. His heart still thuds so hard in his chest that Keith can feel it in his.\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe. Your familiy\u2019s safe.\u201d Keith whispers into Lance\u2019s ear.\n\u00a0\nThen he does it.\n\u00a0\nIt feels natural. A protective instinct. Comforting a friend he tells himself.\n\u00a0\nHe lightly kisses Lance\u2019s temple. Just on the hairline. Keith doesn\u2019t even realise what he\u2019s done until his lips leave Lance\u2019s warm skin. He freezes and waits for him to jerk away.\n\u00a0\nBut Lance doesn\u2019t move. Their fingers are still clasped together against his stomach and his bare back still presses into Keith\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\nKeith is selfish.\n\u00a0\nHe goes in again. And again. And again. Lightly kissing around Lance\u2019s hairline and ear, whispering little reassurances at the same time, until he hears Lance\u2019s breathing return to normal. He places one final kiss on the tip of his eyebrow, then relaxes back into the mattress. Keith lets out a shuddery breath and he\u2019s sure Lance can feel it on the nape of his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nSirens blare.\n\u00a0\nShit shit. It\u2019s been so long since they\u2019ve been caught off guard like this. Warm bodies quickly separate and the rush of the cold air on their skin fully wakes them up. Stiff ankles and knees crack as they sprint down the hallway, and fingers shake and claw at armour and helmets.\n\u00a0\nA Galran fleet. It seemed to just appear out of nowhere, surrounding the castle. Allura relays all this information on the way to their lions. Lance straps in and ejects Blue into space. Keith counts to 10, then does the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright team. We\u2019ve done this before. We can do it again.\u201d Shiro\u2019s commanding voice crackles in their ears. There\u2019s a hum of acknowledgement from everyone else.\n\u00a0\nLance hardly has a chance to appreciate the beauty of the galaxy they are in before lasers are on him. He maneuvers and dodges easily enough, taking out several ships with his tail beam, but he knows there\u2019s a couple of hundred more coming at them.\n\u00a0\nHunk smashes into several, badly damaging them enough that they can no longer shoot, and Pidge weaves in and out with expertise so that the Galra end up shooting their own ships. Even with Keith and Shiro\u2019s expert piloting, they are barely scratching the Galra\u2019s numbers. A few enemy ships ignore the lions completely, and begin to attack the castle instead. Their home, and base, which has much weaker defense.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m calling it.\u201d Shiro orders. \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Lance calls enthusiastically.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take these guys out!\u201d Hunk bellows.\n\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Pidge answers, like she\u2019s been waiting this whole time.\n\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Keith confirms.\n\u00a0\nThey combine like clockwork. It\u2019s easy and as natural to them as flying now, but there\u2019s still a small thrill knowing that they are now one. They are part of the universe\u2019s greatest weapon against tyranny. Their mental link is strong and the small shout of victory between them is unanimous.\n\u00a0\nVoltron begins to tear through the ships when Pidge feels it.\n\u201cJeez, Hunk. I know you didn\u2019t eat breakfast but\u2026\u201d Pidge teases.\n\u201cThat is not me.\u201d Hunk corrects.\nHunger. That\u2019s an interesting way to describe it. The weird feeling thrums through the group strongly enough that Shiro has to mention it.\n\u201cOk look, whatever the hell that is, just ignore it. It\u2019s uncomfortable, but we need to finish this.\u201d Shiro swallows. Voltron careens through the stars and swipes its sword in a large arc. A battalion of ships goes up in flames.\n\u201cUgh, this really sucks. I really hate hacking your brains sometimes.\u201d Pidge winces.\n\u201cStop calling it hacking. I feel violated.\u201d Lance chirps in. He expertly fires an ice attack at an incoming fighter.\n\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s just focus on the task at hand. It\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t deal with.\u201d Shiro throws Voltron into a dive towards the very center of the Galran fleet.\n\u201cRight!\u201d Everyone nods.\n\u00a0\nDespite the frustrated scratching at their heads, Voltron manages to take the fleet out. A few ships scuttle away, undoubtedly to report back to Zarkon about what has happened. The team know that they will likely have to wormhole jump again.\n\u00a0\nThey land their lions in the hangars. Many of the paladins sigh with exhaustion. They\u2019ve only been awake for about an hour and they have already dealt with so much.\n\u201cGood work team! I\u2019m proud of how we managed today. Make sure to put your suits back in their storage areas neatly.\u201d Shiro states, then signs off his comms. Lance rolls his eyes.\n\u00a0\nThey clap each other on the back when they all meet in the suit storage area. Pidge compliments Lance on his improved agility, and Keith compliments Hunk\u2019s improved confidence. He\u2019s just fastened his boots up when Shiro gently grabs him by the elbow.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you guys at breakfast,\u201d Shiro laughs and waves at the others, as he guides Keith out of the room. Keith waits several beats to make sure that they\u2019re out of ear-shot,\n\u00a0\n\u201cOk, what\u2019s up? You\u2019re using your dad voice.\u201d Keith sighs. Shiro scowls.\n\u201cI do not have a dad voice. I\u2019m just concerned\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere it is.\u201d Keith points out. Shiro groans. This argument of theirs has been going on for a while, but he doesn\u2019t have time for jokes right now.\n\u201cLook, Keith\u2026\u201d He steps into a small alcove and tugs the younger boy with him. Keith looks up skeptically.\n\u201cToday went fine. It did. But I\u2019m worried that next time your feelings may be stronger, and we won\u2019t be able to stay together.\u201d Shiro looks sympathetically down at his teammate. Keith gapes like a fish.\n\u201cMy what now?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t that that was me.\u201d\n\u201cKeeeeith,\u201d Shiro laughs. \u201cI know you. I know how you think. I know that was you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. It\u2019s what Pidge said. I clearly didn\u2019t have breakfast\u2026\u201d\nShiro sighs and leans forward. There\u2019s a teasing smirk on his face.\n\u201cIs that what they\u2019re calling it now?\u201d\nKeith flushes.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem again!\u201d Keith snaps to attention. He\u2019s done with this conversation. He doesn\u2019t need Shiro investigating his wants and desires in some broom closet just after he\u2019s risked his life to take down hundreds of enemy space craft. He doesn\u2019t need this.\n\u00a0\nHe gives a sharp nod and marches off. Shiro tries not to chuckle too loudly.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cOoooooh, Keith\u2019s in trouble.\u201d Lance sings. He recognizes Shiro\u2019s dad voice anywhere. He laughs quietly, wondering if Shiro will finally have a word with him about his need to always dive head first into danger. Or maybe he\u2019ll reprimand him for not following Lance\u2019s lead on one of the attacks today. Either would be good.\n\u201cMan I hate it when Shiro pulls me aside. You feel like you\u2019ve disappointed your grandmother or something.\u201d Pidge finishes changing into her civvies. She wipes her glasses and begins to wander off. Hunk is still zipping up his pants. Lance waits patiently for him.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna shower. Save me a plate.\u201d Pidge calls.\n\u201cWill do.\u201d Lance answers.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a comfortable silence between him and Hunk. He leans back on the wall and gently closes his eyes, listening as Hunk finishes pulling his boot on.\n\u201cHey, you wanna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat the HELL was that?!\u201d Hunk is in his face. He uses his size to completely crowd Lance against the wall.\n\u201cWhat was me\u2026.what?!\u201d Lance balks.\n\u201cYour crush on Keith is getting crazy, bro! I\u2019ve never been able to feel it in Voltron before. Control yourself, man!\u201d\nLance remembers. Oh god it had been bad. He slumps forward against Hunk with a loud groan.\n\u201cOh my god, was it really that bad? You could tell it was me?\u201d\n\u201cDude, for a couple of seconds I thought I had a crush on Keith, that\u2019s how strong it was.\u201d Hunk picks Lance\u2019s limp body up and looks into his eyes. Lance completely gives up supporting himself.\n\u201cOh noooooooo,\u201d He wails. \u201cShit. Really?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. And as a straight guy? It was very confusing. Please do not do that to me again.\u201d Hunk smiles, but there\u2019s a genuine warning to his voice. Lance rubs his face.\n\u201cFuuuuuck. Oh god, do you think he felt it? Do you think he knows?\u201d\n\u201cPffft, no. Keith\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cA beautiful idiot.\u201d\n\u201cStop that!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Lance crumbles to sit cross legged on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m fucked! I\u2019m so fucked!\u201d\n\u201cSo stop sleeping with him!\u201d Hunk offers. \u201cStop it! It\u2019s like going to bed with a huge plate of nachos every night! Eventually, you\u2019re gonna take a bite!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t stop! It\u2019s terrible. Please put on my tombstone \u2018Here lies Lance. He had no self control and overdosed on spooning.\u2019\u201d He flails his limbs.\n\u201cWell you gotta do something! If I get back into Voltron and start to feel sexually frustrated\u2026.?!\u201d Hunk holds up his hands and shakes his head in terror. \u201cI\u2019m done! Me and my leggy-ass self are OUT!\u201d\nLance slumps forward. Hunk had a point. God, what if next time they were doing drills he thought about Keith? How his hair looks falling over his face? How he smiles first thing in the morning when he\u2019s woken up with tea? How his soft, warm hands might feel when wrapped around his\u2026\n\u201cOH MY GOD YOU\u2019RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW!\u201d Hunk points dramatically. Lance blushes up to his ears.\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201d\n\u201cI KNOW WHAT YOUR HORNY FACE LOOKS LIKE! YOU CAN\u2019T FOOL ME, LANCE!\u201d\nLance wails. He hates how transparent he is. He hates how Keith has consumed every part of him.\n\u201cYou my friend, are a ticking time bomb.\u201d Hunk leans over and prods him in the chest with an index finger.\n\u201cPidge is a child and I will not expose her to your brain.\u201d\n\u201cI have a problem.\u201d Lance admits.\n\u201cYou have a problem.\u201d Hunk sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\nEach of them knows that they need to say something. Anything. But they push through the tension like a swimmer expertly moves through water. They dodge any nagging feelings and slip easily around each other, pretending that nothing has changed.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day they strip off their clothes and climb into bed together as normal. Their routine is still in tact. Calloused fingers reach out to touch tan skin, and toes flirtatiously touch under the blanket. They forget about their friend\u2019s warnings. They forget about Voltron. They breathe easily knowing that the other is still there. Sleep comes effortlessly.\n\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not a restful one. It\u2019s about 2am when Keith is woken by soft, frightened murmurs and a trembling Lance. The sight of Lance so obviously in pain is still uncomfortable, the way his teeth grit and his eyebrows scrunch together doesn\u2019t suit his youthful face, but it doesn\u2019t cause Keith to panic as much as he used to. He knows what to do now.\n\u00a0\nHe would never admit to it, but he secretly enjoys when Lance gets nightmares. It\u2019s an excuse to hold him close and indulge himself. When Lance is scared, he\u2019s allowed to whisper reassuring things in his ear and press his nose to the nape of his neck. Secure arms wrap around Lance\u2019s stomach, and he is pulled into Keith\u2019s chest. Their bare skin touching still sends a jolt of pleasure up Keith\u2019s spine. His fingertips brush gently between Lance\u2019s pectorals and he barely hesitates to press his lips to his ear.\n\u201cHey, hey, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Keith closes his eyes. Tries to pretend he\u2019s holding Lance for a different reason. Tries to forget the ravenous sensation in his chest. Lance\u2019s breathing slows. His body leans against Keith\u2019s and he reaches for one of his hands and holds it in his.\n\u201cYou\u2019re ok.\u201d Keith whispers and presses another kiss to Lance\u2019s hairline. \u201cWon\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a heavy sigh and Lance squeezes Keith\u2019s hand tighter. Keith takes that as a good sign and smiles into the next kiss he places on Lance\u2019s jawline.\n\u00a0\nLance shifts. He rolls over, but is sure to hold Keith\u2019s arm in place so that it still drapes over his waist. Keith pulls back nervously, but Lance catches his shoulder.\n\u201cNo, no\u2026.\u201d His voice is scratchy. He worries his lip. A faint blush appears on his cheekbones.\n\u201cKeep going.\u201d He asks. His eyes are glassy and sparkle in the dime light. Keith swallows.\n\u00a0\nWith his pulse thudding in his ears, Keith places a chaste kiss on Lance\u2019s forehead. Lance hums contentedly at the contact. The small noise reassures Keith, and he places another at the juncture of his ear. His temple. His cheekbone. His grip around Lance\u2019s waist tightens, and Lance places his hands against Keith\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\nHe kisses between his eyebrows. The tip of his nose. The corner of his mouth\u2026\nThere\u2019s an intake of breath. Keith looks at Lance expectantly, searching for some kind of meaning. Lance reaches out to stroke a thumb against his jawline. His eyes are sincere.\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s jaw goes slack. His fingertips, formerly so sure of themselves on Lance\u2019s hip, begin to shake. His eyes flicker rapidly between Lance\u2019s eyes and his mouth. He\u2019s terrified.\n\u201cHey,\u201d And now it\u2019s Lance speaking in that caressing tone. He applies the smallest amount of pressure to the back of Keith\u2019s neck.\n\u201cI told you to go ahead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKeith caves to the pressure and he\u2019s ashamed of the noise he makes when his lips touch Lance\u2019s. He can feel Lance smile against him and laugh quietly.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d And his hands twist in Keith\u2019s hair. Chaste kisses are abandoned, and they soon turn open mouthed and desperate. Keith leaves nail marks in Lance\u2019s hips from how hard he holds on, like he\u2019s worried he might slip away. He bites at Lance\u2019s bottom lip, and swallows the delicious moan that follows it. Lance\u2019s lips are just as soft as he\u2019s always hoped.\n\u00a0\nLance grips onto Keith and pulls him on top of him. Keith gives a little yelp, but he\u2019s soon back to making out with him enthusiastically. Lance can\u2019t get over how great Keith\u2019s hair feels tangled in his fingers. Keith continues to make breathy little noises and it makes his head swim. He has to pull back to catch his breath.\n\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d Keith looks down anxiously with swollen lips. His hair is a mess and falls around him, and there\u2019s a dark blush across his cheeks. His muscular chest heaves from lack of oxygen.\n\u201cFuuuuuck,\u201d Lance whines. This image alone could sate him for the rest of his life. He brushes Keith\u2019s hair back and runs his fingers along his throat.\n\u201cGod you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\nKeith blinks at him in shock. In all of his wildest fantasies, he never imagined Lance calling him beautiful. It was too sweet, too simple, too much of everything he\u2019s ever wanted.\n\u201cUh\u2026I uh\u2026\u201d Lance\u2019s eyes widen. Keith smirks. There\u2019s the boy he knows.\n\u201cWere you not supposed to say that out loud?\u201d\n\u201cI guess I had to slip up eventually.\u201d Lance rubs his thumb against Keith\u2019s cheek, who leans into the touch. He takes Lance\u2019s hand and kisses the back of his knuckles.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve thought that before then?\u201d He chuckles.\n\u201cSince I first saw you.\u201d\nThe wind is kicked out of Keith\u2019s chest. He\u2019s been dealt a blow he can\u2019t recover from. He stares at the boy pinned below him, who beams up at him.\n\u201cI like you, Keith.\u201d\nKeith\u2019s stopped breathing. Something stings his eyes. Oh god, no. He can\u2019t cry at this. He can\u2019t let Lance see how those words rip through him like fire. He falls forward and buries his face in the crook of Lance\u2019s neck and kisses the sensitive flesh there. Lance gasps and fists at Keith\u2019s hair. The sensation is almost too much. There\u2019s teeth, and tongue, and sucking. It starts to become painful, but Lance doesn\u2019t pull away. Keith releases the skin with a wet pop.\n\u201cDid you leave a mark?\u201d Lance gasps. Keith nods against him.\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t forget.\u201d He mouths at his ear. Lance makes a questioning sound.\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t like Shiro, you absolute idiot.\u201d Keith grumbles. Lance laughs and rolls over to face the boy in his arms.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d He presses their foreheads together.\n\u201cI honestly wanted to punch you.\u201d Keith mumbles. Lance loughs loudly.\n\u201cSays the guy who thought I was straight. I\u2019d been sending you signals for weeks.\u201d He rolls his eyes.\n\u201cYou flirt with everyone else so obviously! Why didn\u2019t I get any cheesy pick-up lines! You know I\u2019m not good with subtlety.\u201d Keith hisses in exasperation. Lance smiles and touches the tips of their noses.\n\u201cMmmm, cuz you deserved better than cheesy pick up lines.\u201d He sighs. Keith rolls his eyes and kisses the corner of his mouth.\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve been doing this sooner, you know.\u201d\nAnd Lance has to admit that that is a shame. He rolls onto his back and pulls Keith in so he lays on his chest. Keith is happy to oblige.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d He promises. Keith presses himself closer. He\u2019s exhausted and his joints feel weak, but his pulse still flutters in his throat.\n\u201cI know how you can.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Lance smirks. Because of course Keith knows what he wants immediately. Keith hums and throws an arm across his chest.\n\u201cSleep with me every night. Like this.\u201d He sighs. Lance angles his head to kiss the top of his head and breathes in the smell of orange blossoms.\n\u201cToo easy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTheir chests rise and fall in a steady rhythm. Keith feels sleep start to wrap its tendrils around him, and he listens to Lance\u2019s quiet breathing.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re my boyfriend now, right?\u201d Lance\u2019s voice cuts through the romantic silence.\n\u201cOh my god, yes.\u201d\n\u201cOk just checking, jeez.\u201d\n\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d Keith snaps, but there\u2019s no bite to it. The last thing he remembers is Lance\u2019s lips on the corner of his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cOk, Paladins! I understand you had some difficulty yesterday. Please understand that you must be able to function as a single unit in even the most stressful of situations.\u201d Allura\u2019s authoritative voice comes through the comms. Lance lazily flies Blue around, noting where all the other lions are moving.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour goal is simple. I\u2019ve set up several targets that will project into this planet\u2019s atmosphere, but they will be moving very quickly. Attack them all before your timer runs out. The number of targets will increase with each level.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re doing this all as Voltron?\u201d Hunk confirms.\n\u201cOf course. Your mental link is still quite weak. Your strategies shouldn\u2019t be \u2018Lance\u2019s idea\u2019 or \u2018Pidge\u2019s idea\u2019. You should all have the same thoughts at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you guys like thinking about corn dogs. Because I have a wicked craving\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Shiro cuts Lance off before he can make any more smart remarks.\n\u201cThis should be easy. Let\u2019s prove yesterday was a fluke.\u201d His voice is optimistic. It makes the other Paladins more confident.\n\u201cOkay! Let\u2019s form Voltron!\u201d\n\u00a0\nForming Voltron is amazingly easy now, and Keith welcomes the feeling of being joined to the others. He breathes easy and grips his controls tighty.\n\u201cAlright! We\u2019ve got this down!\u2019 Lance whoops loudly. Keith shakes his head and smiles.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh thank Christ, they got together.\u201d Pidge sighs into her mic. There\u2019s a choking sound from Lance.\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t\u2026!\u201d He starts to protest.\n\u201cOh yeah we do. You dog, you.\u201d Hunk teases. Keith blushes furiously in his seat. Ok never mind. He actually hates this. Never mind the joy of teams and finding somewhere he belongs. Please dump him back in his desert shack. Shiro\u2019s soft laughter echoes in his ear.\n\u201cCongrats Keith.\u201d His voice is gentle. Keith wonders if his lion has an eject button.\n\u201cI thought we had a goal here.\u201d He tries to remain professional. Form Voltron. Attack targets before the time runs out. It\u2019s simple, and he doesn\u2019t need people rummaging in his head and finding out how hopelessly gone he is for Lance\u2019s smile. How his voice first thing in the morning makes him weak at the knees, and how his hands against his chest make him feel\u2026\n\u201cAwww,\u201d Shiro hears everything. Keith yells over Hunk and Pidge laughing hysterically. Lance is mysteriously silent.\n\u201cAnd I thought Lance was the romantic.\u201d Pidge giggles.\n\u201cOh god, you don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know when they\u2019ve had sex will we?\u201d Hunk worries out loud. There\u2019s a smug chuckle from Lance.\n\u201cI dunno. Let\u2019s form Voltron tomorrow and you tell me.\u201d Even though Keith can\u2019t see him, he knows exactly what kind of shit eating grin Lance is wearing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you tonight, Lance.\u201d He drawls.\n\u201cAw babe, come on! Let me dream!\u201d\n\u201cOk, ok, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Shiro orders. \u201cEveryone stop bombarding Lance\u2019s and Keith\u2019s head holes. We\u2019re all very happy for you and wish you the best. But Keith\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d\n\u201cRight!\u201d Comes the unanimous reply.\n\u00a0\nVoltron soars through the air with ease. Keith\u2019s red lion cuts down the targets with it\u2019s sword and they are picking up even more speed. Despite the difficulty of the exercise, it is somehow pleasantly relaxing. Lance takes a moment to switch his comms into private.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s just us.\u201d His voice comes through to Keith.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll let me kiss you a lot tonight though, right?\u201d And Keith has to laugh at how worried Lance sounds.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a giddiness from Lance\u2019s end.\n\u201cOk cool. Just checking. Back to the task now.\u201d\n\u201cSwitching comms back to the team.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShiro please pilot us into a mountain. We are too happy and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Pidge groans.\n\u201cRequest denied.\u201d Shiro laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
