    "text": "It\u2019s a dark and stormy night.\nAlright, it isn\u2019t stormy\u2014just drizzling a tad. And it isn\u2019t even very dark, thanks to the motion sensing lights in the Manor\u2019s kitchen flickering to life as Jason slips in through the window above the sink. He could\u2019ve just used the door\u2014his biometrics are still programmed into the security system, which is the only reason his presence here doesn\u2019t set off Bruce\u2019s multitude of alarms\u2014but there\u2019s a camera on the landing that snaps a picture of anyone who enters, and Jason would rather avoid any photographic evidence of his visit.\u00a0\nPlausible deniability and all.\nSee, he\u2019s just returned home from a mission with Roy that had gone a little longer than they\u2019d intended.\u00a0\nLike. Sixteen days longer.\nBut in this line of work, that\u2019s just par for the course. Sometimes you show up, guns blazing, to bust a drug cartel, and you kick ass, and other times your buddy\u2019s exploding arrow malfunctions and you get captured and held underground in a bunker for two weeks until you manage to whittle yourself a shiv from a discarded plastic spork, shank a few guards, steal their clothes, and trick some lackey into letting you gain access to the drug lord\u2019s chambers so you can finish the job, all before driving off into the sunset in a stolen Jeep with a missing tail light.\n\n C'est la vie. \n\nAnyway, after a solid two weeks of forced team-bonding, Jason\u2019s little one-bedroom apartment had never sounded so sweet. A private shower, fresh clothes, a good night\u2019s sleep, and above all else,  a hot meal.  It\u2019s not like the cartel were starving them there, but suffice it to say that Jason doesn\u2019t want to see plain rice and beans again for at least a few months.\nOf course, the trouble with an impromptu sixteen-day kidnapping is arriving home at two in the morning\u2014exhausted, sore, a little jumpy, and downright famished\u2014to a fridge full of spoiled food. Because if there\u2019s one thing Jason Todd hates, it\u2019s going to bed hungry.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a trauma thing\u2014remnants of a childhood of chronic food insecurity, or whatever. Dinah explained it to him once. Practically speaking, it means his options are either breaking into the Manor, or hitting up the only 24-hour mini mart in Crime Alley for some laughably overpriced Top Ramen. And they don\u2019t even sell the picante shrimp flavor.\nSo there\u2019s really no choice at all, is there?\nJason pauses on the counter for a second to wipe his muddy boots off with paper towels\u2014because  Alfred didn\u2019t raise an animal (excluding Bruce, of course)\u2014before hopping down. Moving to the fridge, he rifles through the usual assortment of fresh produce and neatly stacked pyrex containers of leftovers, all labeled, dated, and organized in accordance with the butler\u2019s overly-anal storage system.\nHe\u2019s perusing the offerings\u201402/16 meatloaf, 02/17 vegetarian lasagna\u2013no onion, 02/17 roast turkey cutlets, 02/18 shepherd\u2019s pie\u2014when suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he notices a slight movement from a brown paper bag on the bottom shelf of the fridge.\nJason blinks, then rubs his eyes. The sleep deprivation these past few weeks must be catching up with him. But, no, the bag, marked simply with the timestamp of  7:30 pm, rustles ever so slightly again.\nWell that\u2019s not ominous at all.\nCarefully, Jason pulls out the package and unwraps it. Inside, he finds a pair of lobsters, their claws banded with rubber-bands, which only makes him more confused because after the absolute  fit Damian pitched last year, Alfred vowed only to ever purchase fresh lobster for\u2013\n\u201c...the old man\u2019s birthday,\u201d Jason whispers aloud, suddenly recalling the date. A sly grin spreads across his face.\nSure, he could just make himself a sandwich or reheat some of Alfie\u2019s meatloaf and call it a day, but he\u2019s had a  really bad past couple weeks,  okay, and nothing\u2014honestly  nothing  \u2014brings Jason as much pure unadulterated joy as being an  absolute menace  to Bruce Wayne.\nAnd if that happens to mean commandeering his adoptive father\u2019s one annual birthday indulgence for a post-midnight snack while he slumbers away upstairs?\u00a0\nWell, that\u2019s just the icing on the lobster thermidor.\nTen minutes later, Jason has just finished dicing the onions and celery, one of Alfred\u2019s French cookbooks propped open on the counter to a dog-eared page while a mixture of water, wine, and spices simmers on the stovetop. He\u2019s about to start in on the carrots when he hears the quiet but still unmistakable creak of the fifth stair from the upstairs landing.\n Shit.  Jason flicks the motion light off and ducks down behind the island. Who would be up at this hour? The glowing numbers on the stove\u2019s clock show it\u2019s not even four a.m. This is supposed to be the sweet spot\u2014when everyone\u2019s made it back from patrol and showered and collapsed into their respective beds, yet still several hours before even the earliest risers have emerged.\nDid he trip an alarm after all?\nJason stills his breathing, listening as the sound of footsteps comes closer\u2014which, honestly, is a little unexpected, given all the stealth training Bruce put them through. So that can only mean\u2013\nThere\u2019s a sharp thud of someone smacking straight into the doorframe, followed by a hiss of, \u201cOw! Fuck...\u201d \nJason stands back up, slapping on the light switch with a frown. \u201cDickface?\u201d\n\n The fuck is he doing here? \n\n\u201cThe fuck are you doing here?\u201d Jason demands.\nDick\u2014left arm in a sling, right arm braced against his bandaged side, and sporting the beginnings of an impressive black eye\u2014huffs out a short laugh. \u201cCould say the same to you, Jaybird,\u201d he says, wincing as he takes another step forward over the kitchen\u2019s threshold. He wrinkles up his nose at the steam wafting toward him from the pot. \u201cAre you\u2026 boiling  wine?\u201d \n \u201cNo,  you uncultured swine,\u201d Jason scoffs, turning back to the carrots to resume his chopping. \u201cThat is a  simmer.\u201d\nDick\u2019s gaze travels around the room, taking in the various ingredients before landing on the recipe\u2019s title in the open cookbook. He looks up again, blinking at his brother. \u201cReally, Jay?\u201d he says flatly. \u201cOn his birthday?\u201d\n\u201cI had a rough couple weeks!\u201d Jason defends. Using the knife, he gestures vaguely at Dick\u2019s injuries. \u201cNow, why do you look like someone beat the snot out of you?\u201d\nDick shifts uncomfortably. \u201cSting operation back in Blud\u2019,\u201d he says, moving gingerly over to the walk-in pantry. \u201cDidn\u2019t go entirely to plan.\u201d\nJason snorts. \u201cAnd you\u2019re always telling  me  not to go in with no back-up.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I  tried  to get back-up,\u201d Dick huffs, opening a hidden panel inside the pantry to reveal Alfred\u2019s meticulously well-stocked medicine cabinet. He starts rifling through the painkiller section. \u201cRoy said he was game to help me take down these guys  months  ago, but suddenly it\u2019s time to strike and the guy\u2019s not answering his phone.\u201d\nThe irony of that remark causes a sharp bark of laughter to escape Jason\u2019s lips. He knows  exactly why Roy wasn\u2019t picking up. The cartel had smashed their phones on day one.\nDick glances up from the bottles, giving him a quizzical look. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Jason says quickly. From the sounds of things, Dick has no reason to suspect his brother\u2019s absence for the last half month was anything out of the ordinary and Jason firmly intends to keep it that way. Last thing he needs is a four a.m. post-kidnapping heart to heart with a doped-up Dick Grayson.\nDick frowns at the orange prescription pill bottle in his hand. \u201cIs Percocet the same as hydrocodone?\u201d\nJason rolls his eyes because  honestly,  how do these idiots survive without him? \u201cWe go over this every time. Percocet is  oxycodone.  Norco  is hydrocodone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Vicodin then?\u201d he asks, holding up a different bottle.\n\u201cAlso hydrocodone.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not confusing at all\u2026\u201d Dick mutters, shaking out two Vicodin into his open palm. He tosses them back dry. \u201cUgh.\u201d He makes a face. \u201cNasty.\u201d\nJason\u2019s eyebrows raise. It\u2019s not like Dick\u2014or any of them, really\u2014to break out The Good Stuff willy-nilly. \u201cJust how hurt are you?\u201d\nDick gives a one-armed shrug. \u201cEh, cracked a couple ribs. Bruised a kidney. Popped my shoulder out again\u2026\u201d\nJason snorts. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that shoulder\u2019s even still attached at this point. You dislocate it every other week.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not  that often.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right,\u201d Jason scoffs. \u201cAre you forgetting the time you once sneezed it  out of place?\u201d\n\u201cHay fever sucks, what\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201cAnd denial is a river in Africa\u2026\u201d Jason mutters under his breath.\nDick shoots him a tired glare, but Jason just flips him off and resumes his chopping. He makes quick work of the carrots and dumps them carefully into the simmering pot, then on a whim, he takes out a small frying pan and sets it on the stove with a little oil.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just gonna stand there, grab the eggs, will ya?\u201d Jason orders, mincing one of the extra onions on the counter. \u201cAnd a green bell pepper, and the milk, and some shredded cheese. And ham, if you see any.\u201d\nDick opens the fridge dutifully. \u201cHaving second thoughts about ruining B\u2019s birthday dinner?\u201d\n\u201cGod no,\u201d Jason scoffs, side-stepping over to snag the requested ingredients as his brother deposits them onto the counter one by one. \u201cI\u2019m just making  me  lobster thermidor, and  you  an omelette.\u201d\nDick looks up, brow furrowed. \u201cAn omelette?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, because twenty bucks says you didn\u2019t eat dinner, and I\u2019m not about to mop Alfie\u2019s floor when those pills kick in and you hurl from taking narcotics on an empty stomach,\u201d Jason retorts, chopping the top off the pepper. \u201cNow hand me a mixing bowl.\u201d\nDick rolls his eyes, but gets one out of the cupboard anyway. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hurled.\u201d He hands Jason the metal bowl. \u201cAlso I hate green pepper.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, what was that?\u201d Jason mocks, still chopping away. \u201cExtra pepper you say?\u201d He dumps a generous handful into the bowl with the onion, receiving a very unamused look from his brother in return.\nJason grins back. Messing with Dick isn\u2019t quite on par with messing with Bruce, but it\u2019s certainly up there.\nDick closes the fridge again and goes back to leaning against it. He\u2019s quiet for a moment while Jason cracks the eggs and whisks them together with the veggies, then admits, \u201cB\u2019s been pushing me to get the surgery again.\u201d\n\u201cYou should do it,\u201d Jason says automatically.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Dick balks in faux-surprise. \u201cDo my ears deceive me or is Jason Todd siding with Bruce Wayne on something?\u201d\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re being a stubborn ass about it,\u201d Jason huffs, flicking an onion stem across the kitchen at him. \u201cLeslie\u2019s been telling you to get that shoulder fixed for  years.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not  that  bad.\u201d\n\u201cNot that good either,\u201d Jason points out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it and get it over with?\u201d\n\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Dick makes a dismissive gesture.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because the ortho told him it\u2019d be a minimum three-to-six month recovery time.\u201d\nBoth Jason and Dick startle when the new voice\u2014hoarse and raspy\u2014joins the mix. They turn to see Tim shuffling into the kitchen, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. The dark circles under his eyes are reminiscent of a raccoon\u2019s and he\u2019s even paler than usual\u2014which for Tim is saying something. He pauses on his way to the fridge to cough a few times into his elbow\u2014deep, chesty hacks that make Jason wince in sympathy.\nThat\u2019s bronchitis if he\u2019s ever heard it.\n\u201cAnd how do  you  know that?\u201d Dick demands, turning on the sick boy with equal parts annoyance and amusement in his tone. \u201cDid you hack my medical records again?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly \u2018hacking\u2019 when I wrote the encryption software for the database myself,\u201d Tim mutters. Reaching the fridge, he retrieves a metal water bottle and takes a sip, wincing as he swallows. \u201cOw,\u201d he breathes out, then starts hacking into his elbow again.\n\u201cDid you even use the cough syrup I bought you?\u201d Dick asks as Jason flips the omelette over.\n\u201cYou got me the menthol one,\u201d Tim croaks, wrinkling up his nose in disgust. \u201cIt tastes\u2013\u201d He cuts himself off, coughing a few more times. \u201cTastes like ass. Said I wanted cherry.\u201d\n\u201cCVS was out of cherry.\u201d\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve gone to\u2013\u201d Tim breaks into another coughing fit, this one going on long enough that Dick takes pity on him and limps over to help him cross the kitchen and collapse down onto the breakfast nook bench. Jason, meanwhile, starts the kettle going for tea.\nTim\u2019s wheezing by the time the fit has subsided. \u201cCould\u2019ve gone to Walgreens. God...\u201d  he groans, resting his elbows on the table and balling up his fists to press into his eyes. \u201cCan\u2019t wait till I\u2019m eighteen and I can buy my own friggin' Robitussin.\u201d\nJason snorts, sliding the omelette off the pan and onto a plate. \u201cYour problem is you\u2019re trying to buy it in  Bristol. Go to Crime Alley and I guarantee you, no one is carding minors for cough syrup.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no one\u2019s carding them for handguns either,\u201d Dick mutters.\nJason flips him off, scowling, and like the grown man he is, Dick sticks his tongue out in return.\nTossing a fork onto the plate, Jason slides it across the counter at Dick\u2014who for some reason has gone back to leaning against the fridge. \u201cBon appetit, dumbass. Get the surgery.\u201d\n\u201cMind your business,\u201d Dick grumbles. He pokes at the eggs a bit, looking unenthused.\nThe tea kettle whistles, so Jason takes it off the heat and makes a mug of chamomile. He sets it down in front of Tim\u2014who\u2019s coughing again so much that he can only nod his thanks.\n\u201cWant some eggs?\u201d he offers, mostly because there\u2019s still half a diced onion on the counter and Jason hates being wasteful.\nTim shakes his head, the coughs finally subsiding. \u201c\u2018M allergic,\u201d he rasps out.\nJason blinks at him. \u201cSince when?\u201d\n\u201c...Since ever?\u201d\nJason stares at him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve  seen  you eat eggs before. Like,  many times.\u201d\nTim flaps a hand dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m not  deathly  allergic. I eat \u2018em whenever Alfie makes them not to be rude. I just usually throw up after.\u201d\n\u201cTimmy!\u201d Dick whirls his head around in shock. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n\u201cNot on purpose!\u201d Tim croaks. \u201cThey just mess up my stomach, I dunno. And it\u2019s not  every  time, it\u2019s just that my throat already hurts so I don\u2019t wanna risk it.\u201d\nJason blinks at him again. \u201cOkay there\u2019s self-sacrificial bullshit, and then there\u2019s  whatever the fresh hell that is.\u201d  He crosses over to the pantry and pulls out a canister of stone-ground cornmeal. \u201cEat your eggs,\u201d he orders at Dick, seeing the still-untouched plate.\nDick makes a face. \u201cThese are like, forty percent green pepper.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re good for you,\u201d Jason retorts. He fills a small pot with equal parts water and milk and sets it on the stove to boil with a few dashes of salt. \u201cVitamin A and C and all that shit.\u201d\n\u201cI already take vitamins.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Flintstones chewables count.\u201d Jason measures out a cup full of cornmeal and sets it aside.\u00a0\n\u201cThen why are they the  pediatrician\u2019s number one choice?\u201d  Dick challenges.\n\u201cYou do know you\u2019re twenty-eight, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a child at heart.\u201d He stabs a piece of pepper with the fork and brings it warily to his lips, then immediately shudders. \u201cEugh. Yeah, no, still nasty.\u201d He pushes the plate away.\nJason rolls his eyes. \u201cThis is the last time I cook for you.\u201d\n\u201cNot like I asked.\u201d\n\u201cYou took  Vicodin, moron. You need to eat or you\u2019re gonna fucking hurl.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna hurl.\u201d\n\u201cYes you will,\u201d Tim says tiredly, head hunched over the steaming mug of tea. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the weakest stomach out of any of us.  And you\u2019re the whiniest when you\u2019re sick.\u201d\nDick scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s rich coming from Mr. \u2018I\u2019ve Been Puking Eggs Twice a Month for the Past Four Years.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYeah but I\u2019m not a little bitch about it.\u201d\nWhile Tim and Dick continue to bicker, Jason cranks the heat up on the larger pot of simmering liquid, and the tiny bubbles begin to grow in size. Then he grabs a silicon spatula and starts stirring the cornmeal into the small pot of water and milk\u2014which is now boiling.\n\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d Tim asks curiously.\u00a0\nJason points at the first pot. \u201cLobster thermidor\u2013\u201d\nTim covers his face with his hands.  \u201cYou\u2019re such an ass, Jay,\u201d he mutters into them.\n\u201c\u2013and for  you,  I\u2019m making grits,\u201d he finishes, nodding to the pot of corn mush he\u2019s stirring. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking welcome.\u201d\n\u201cGrits?\u201d Tim looks up again, wrinkling his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s like, baby food.\u201d\n\u201cUh,  excuse me?\u201d  Jason balks at him. \u201cI think you mean a  fucking delicious southern staple.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not even hungry.\u201d\nJason points his spatula at him threateningly. \u201cDo I look like I care?\u201d\nTim opens his mouth to retort something, but due to another coughing jag, Jason doesn\u2019t find out what. It\u2019s probably for the best.\nAs Tim\u2019s getting his breath back, Jason unwraps the lobsters and drops them into the boiling stock. He covers the pot, then checks the cookbook and turns to Dick. \u201cI need the mushrooms, a lemon, and some butter,\u201d he orders, pointing to the fridge.\nDick sighs and pushes himself away from the fridge door again while Jason gives the grits another few stirs. It\u2019s thickening up nicely.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Dick says, handing over the items. Then he closes the door again and goes back to leaning.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sitting down?\u201d Jason asks. He gestures over at the breakfast nook. \u201cI know Tiny Tim\u2019s got the plague over there, but I would\u2019ve thought your ironclad Flintstones immune system could take it.\u201d\nAt that, Tim barks out a laugh so suddenly that it triggers another round of coughing.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jason gives him a quizzical look. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t  that  funny.\u201d\nIf he didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d swear he sees Dick\u2019s face flush. \u201cHe\u2019s delirious,\u201d the older boy mumbles. \u201cFever, you know...\u201d\n \u201cNot,\u201d  a new voice says sharply, and all three boys jump\u2014Jason so badly that he jerks the spatula and accidentally flings some grits across the stove.\n\u201cJesus Christ, Cass,\u201d he breathes out, still clutching his chest. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\nCassandra emerges from the shadows on the far end of the kitchen, grinning. \u201cLong time. Heard you come in.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018S that why you\u2019re up?\u201d Tim rasps out. \u201cWe bein\u2019 too loud?\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cUp before, too. Not a sleeping night.\u201d\nThey all nod in understanding. Ever since Cass first joined the family, they\u2019ve been aware of her little idiosyncrasies, including her proclivity to silently patrol the Manor some nights instead of sleeping. Dinah says it\u2019s anxiety that causes Cass to not always feel safe in her own room, and Cass just shrugs at that.\nCass\u2019s eyes sparkle mischievously. She points a finger at Dick. \u201cCan\u2019t sit. Because\u2026\u201d She points at her own rear end, then mimes a kicking motion, which causes Tim to bark out another cough-laugh and Dick to groan and slide a hand over his face in exasperation.\n \u201cCass...\u201d  he whines.\n\u201cWait, wait\u2026\u201d Jason feels the corners of his mouth spreading into a shit-eating grin. \u201cDickhead\u2026 is she saying you  literally got your ass kicked?\u201d \nMore cough-laughs from Tim, and a louder groan from Dick.\nCass nods, grinning. \u201cBoot,\u201d she adds. \u201cSteel toe.\u201d\nJason is doubled over laughing now.  \u201cOh my god,  Dick. You got your fucking  ass kicked!\u201d\nDick shoots him a glare. \u201cIt\u2019s called a fractured tailbone,  Jason,\u201d  he says through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you know, I was winning that fight until the shoulder went out.\u201d\n \u201cSee?!\u201d  both Jason and Tim exclaim in unison, but Dick only scowls.\nOnce Jason\u2019s managed to wipe the tears from his eyes, the grits are bubbling. He turns off the heat and dishes up a bowlful, shoulders still shaking with silent giggles. After adding a pat of butter to the top and some more salt, he sets it down in front of Tim, along with a spoon.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tim mumbles, and to Jason\u2019s surprise, he actually picks up the spoon and starts eating.\u00a0\n(Then again, given his history with the eggs, that doesn\u2019t mean much from him.)\nJason turns to Cass. \u201cAnd what would  you like from the short order cook tonight?\u201d he sighs.\nHer face twists up in thought. \u201cMeat,\u201d she answers after a second\u2019s deliberation.\n\u201cMeat?\u201d Jason echoes. \u201cAny particular kind?\u201d\nShe shrugs. \u201cAny. Not picky.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t want grits?\u201d\nHer face scrunches up. \u201cNot a baby.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does everyone keep calling it baby food?\u201d Jason demands hotly. He rips the plastic off the top of the mushroom container and starts rinsing the dirt off them in the sink. \u201cGrits are a fucking  delicacy.  If I called it  polenta would you eat it?\u201d\nCass shakes her head. \u201cI have teeth,\u201d she says simply. \u201cWant meat.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you do\u2026\u201d Jason mutters under his breath, but it only makes her grin again. \u201cO Great Guardian of the Fridge,\u201d he addresses Dick with a mocking little bow. \u201cBacon, if you would be so kind.\u201d\nDick tosses him a tired salute and gets it out. He\u2019s looking progressively more dead on his feet, so Jason knows the drugs must be finally kicking in now.\nJason turns back to Cass with a sigh. \u201cDo you know what a donut pillow is?\u201d he asks.\nShe nods, swooping her hands around in a circle to outline its shape. \u201cFor sitting.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Jason returns the nod. \u201cThe old man keeps one upstairs in his bedroom closet for bad back days. Think you can sneak in and grab it without waking him?\u201d\n\u201cEasy,\u201d she says confidently, and Jason snorts. Bruce is a notoriously light sleeper, but he supposes if anyone has a hope of getting in and out undetected, it\u2019s the resident trained ninja assassin.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the donut, Cass,\u201d Dick grumbles as Jason takes two pans\u2014one larger frying one, and a smaller saut\u00e9 pan\u2014and sets them both on the stove.\nCass shakes her head back and forth a few times. \u201cDumb brother...\u201d she sighs fondly, and then slips out of the room without a single sound.\u00a0\nWhile she\u2019s gone, Jason starts the mushrooms stewing with butter and lemon juice in the saut\u00e9 pan. Then to the larger pan, he adds bacon strips, dropping them in carefully with tongs to avoid getting splashed with grease when they sizzle.\nCass returns a few minutes later, donut pillow tucked under her arm. She skips back through the kitchen and deposits it on the bench opposite Tim at the breakfast nook. \u201cSit,\u201d she says sweetly.\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Dick hums a bit, causing Jason to glance up from the stove. His brother has his eyes closed and is leaning the back of his head against the fridge door, breathing shallowly through his half-open mouth.\u00a0\n\u201cWell? Go sit down before you fall asleep standing up,\u201d Jason orders, pointing across the room at the bench. \u201cYou\u2019ve broken enough bones for one day.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d Dick hums again, and slowly pushes himself away from the support of the fridge. He shuffles slowly over to the bench and sits down on the pillow with a sigh, immediately resting his forehead down on the table.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your omelette,\u201d Tim points out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t want it,\u201d Dick mumbles into the table top.\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t make it for show,\u201d Jason scoffs. \u201cCass\u201d\u2014he nods toward the barely touched plate on the counter\u2014\u201ccan you bring him his omelette?\u201d\n\u201cNoo\u2026\u201d Dick groans, just bordering on a whine. \u201cI can\u2019t eat that.\u201d\n\u201cOh grow up, Richard, it\u2019s a fucking pepper,\u201d Jason grumbles while Cass sets the plate down in front of him.\nDick gulps audibly, the smallest of moans escaping.\n\u201cDick\u2026?\u201d Tim asks warily, pulling the plate back away from him. \u201cAre you gonna\u2013\u201d\n \u201cTrying not to,\u201d  he grits out.\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d Jason exclaims in exasperation, abandoning the bacon to move to the pantry. \u201cWhat did we  fucking tell you?  Cass, get a\u2013\u201d\n\u201cBowl,\u201d she agrees readily, racing over to the appropriate cabinet.\n\u201cTim!\u201d Jason grabs a sleeve of saltines from a box in the pantry and lobs it across the kitchen. Tim\u2014who isn\u2019t even looking up\u2014shoots out a hand to catch it on reflex.\u00a0\nCass plops an empty mixing bowl down in front of Dick. He immediately sits up and pulls it over to him, breathing heavily. Tim rips the crackers open and shoves one into Dick\u2019s hand, bending his fingers around it.\n \u201cEat,\u201d Tim orders, and this time Dick obliges, bringing the saltine up to his mouth with a grimace and starting to nibble at it while Jason grabs a can of ginger ale from the fridge and plunks it down in front of him.\nAfter a few tense minutes, it seems as though the danger has passed. Dick is breathing a little more evenly now that he\u2019s gotten down three of the crackers and about half the soda, and most of the color has returned to his face.\n\u201cNow what have we learned here?\u201d Jason asks in a faux-sweet voice as he plates up the cooked bacon, but Dick just gives him a withering look.\nJason passes off the bacon to Cass, who beams back at him, touching her chin with her fingertips and extending her hand forward in the sign for  thanks.  She carries it over to the table and slides in next to Tim to start munching on it.\n\u201cWhen did Todd arrive?\u201d\nFor the goddamn  fourth time that night, Jason startles at the voice of their newest intruder, and he drops the now-cooked lobster that he was fishing out of the pot with a pair of tongs straight back into the boiling liquid. It splashes back up at his hand and he shakes it, cursing.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s jumpy,\u201d Tim snorts.\nA bitter part of Jason nearly snaps back that  yeah, that\u2019s what fucking happens when you\u2019ve spent the last sixteen days held in some bunker being mildly tortured for information, but that\u2019s also not really something he wants to get into at the moment, so he settles for a glare.\nDamian steps further into the kitchen, and Jason can see now that he\u2019s holding Alfred the cat, stroking his fur absently. He side-eyes Jason. \u201cAre you cooking Father\u2019s birthday lobster?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBad week,\u201d Jason answers through gritted teeth.\n \u201cTt,\u201d Damian lets out a tiny scoff, but it\u2019s lacking its usual heat. He crosses the kitchen and climbs up onto the bench next to Dick, Alfred still clutched tightly in his arms, then leans his head up against Dick\u2019s good shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201c...Dames?\u201d Dick asks quietly, but Damian just shakes his head, eyes closed, so Dick wraps his arm around him and starts gently rubbing his back.\nJason catches Tim\u2019s gaze and they both exchange a look of  what the fuck? \nCass makes eye contact with Jason and slowly lifts one hand up in front of her mouth, palm in, fingers in a claw shape. She twists it outward.  Hot.  Then she makes a c-shape with the same hand and circles it on top of the opposite fist.  Chocolate. \nJason frowns at her. And then all of a sudden, it clicks.\nHe nods back and starts the kettle going again.\u00a0\n(After all, even  Jason  still has nightmares about his time with the League.)\nWhile Dick whispers quietly in Damian\u2019s ear, Jason spends the next few minutes working on the thermidor, adding the mushrooms and some cream to the lobster stock and starting to reduce it over the heat. Cass slips out of her seat and comes over to help, so Jason points at the diagrams in the cookbook which show how to split the lobster shells to remove the meat and she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work.\u00a0\nTim, meanwhile, pulls out his phone and starts scrolling idly through it. On the surface, he appears totally indifferent, but Jason\u2019s known him long enough to realize that\u2019s just how he gives people space when they need it.\u00a0\n(Jason\u2019s suspicions are further confirmed when he comes over to place a mug of cocoa down in front of Damian and classical music begins playing very softly from the kitchen\u2019s speakers\u2014Tim still not glancing up from the glowing screen.)\nOverall, it\u2019s quite peaceful. That is, until Jason nearly shits himself when he turns around to see a blonde-haired face above the sink.\nStephanie waves at him, smiling brightly. Open up,  she mouths through the window, pointing up at the locking mechanism.\n\u201cOh  fuck  no.\u201d He reaches up for the cord and pulls the blinds closed.\nThere\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, and then he hears knuckles rapping against the glass.\nHeaving out a sigh, Jason opens the blinds again. Stephanie makes a pouting face at him as he unlatches the window.\u00a0\n\u201cRude,\u201d she remarks as she swings her legs over and climbs in.\n\u201cFuck you, Blondie,\u201d Jason mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to finish me off a second time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only natural, Zombie Boy.\u201d She turns to take in the rest of the room. \u201cSo what\u2019s this, like the world\u2019s saddest breakfast club?\u201d\nJason and Tim both wince at that, but Damian just sits up straight and takes a sip of his cocoa with a smirk of amusement. \u201cIt is now that you\u2019re here, Brown,\u201d he quips.\n\u201cAw, love you too, Baby Bat,\u201d Stephanie gushes, hopping over to ruffle his hair.\u00a0\nDamian scowls and shakes the hair back into place.\n\u201cSo to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?\u201d Jason asks in a deadpan.\n\u201cOh, I was actually coming here for Cass,\u201d Stephanie explains, causing the other girl to poke her head up from the lobster. \u201cWe\u2019ve been texting all night \u2018cus I was up writing my Econ paper, and then like, an hour ago, I sent her a  burning philosophical question, and she left me on  read,\u201d  she says, narrowing her gaze in Cass\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd she hasn\u2019t answered a single text since.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Cass shrugs, looking a little sheepish. \u201cBusy.\u201d She inclines her head down to the lobster shell.\n\u201cYeah, speaking of that, why the heck are you two  shucking a lobster at five in the morning?\u201d she demands.\u00a0\nCass nods sideways to the open cookbook, so Steph walks over to peer over Cass\u2019s shoulder at it. \u201cOh.\u201d Her brow wrinkles up. \u201cIs this like, some kind of birthday surprise?\u201d\nJason snorts. \u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d She turns back to the room. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s actually great  that you\u2019re all up because now we have enough people for a whole philosophical  debate.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the burning question?\u201d Tim croaks.\nStephanie grins widely. \u201cWhether or not Spider-Man would stick to a non-stick pan.\u201d\nJason blinks at her. Then he points back at the window. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\u201cAw, but I just got here!\u201d She places her hands on the counter behind her and pushes herself up to sit on top of it. \u201cI wanna hear all of your arguments.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bite. What kind of non-stick pan?\u201d Dick asks, looking genuinely thoughtful.\n\u201cOh I dunno.\u201d Stephanie shrugs. \u201cLet\u2019s say teflon.\u201d\n\u201cTeflon is shit,\u201d Jason scoffs, getting out another mug. \u201cIt scrapes off if you scratch it with a fork. He\u2019d definitely stick to teflon.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s say ceramic then,\u201d she amends.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the surface area of the pan?\u201d Tim asks tiredly.\nDamian frowns. \u201cWhy would that matter, Drake? Spider-Man  himself has a limited surface area with which to adhere.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a fever, Dami, be nice...\u201d Dick mutters under his breath.\n\u201cWhat? No it would still matter.\u201d Tim looks up, brow pinched in confusion. \u201cWait\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDick pats his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tim.\u201d\nCass clears her throat sharply, diverting everyone\u2019s attention over to her. She\u2019s holding the handle of a non-stick pan in each hand, using them to chop at the air, karate style. Atop her head, a third pan is balanced upside down like a hat. \u201cGreatest enemy. Pan-Man,\u201d she declares with a grin.\n \u201cYes!\u201d  Stephanie exclaims happily.  \u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere!\u201d\nJason hands her a mug of hot chocolate. \u201cHere, join Breakfast Club.\u201d\nShe winces, sucking in a breath through her teeth. \u201cOoh, I would, but I\u2019m only eating raw foods this week.\u201d\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a food,\u201d Jason argues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beverage.\u201d\n\u201cYeahhh\u2026 but I think it still counts.\u201d\nDick frowns at her. \u201cSteph, you\u2019re not doing one of those weird detox cleanses are you? Because they can be really unhealthy in the long run if\u2013\u201d\n\u201cRelax!\u201d She laughs, holding up her hands in a placating gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cleanse, okay? It\u2019s a  bet.\u201d\n\u201cA bet?\u201d Tim repeats skeptically.\u00a0\n\u201cThis really annoying guy from my statistics class, Kevin Nelson, bet me fifty bucks I couldn\u2019t go raw vegan for a week.\u201d\n\u201cDo you see Kevin Nelson here?\u201d Jason scoffs, gesturing around the kitchen. \u201cBecause I sure don\u2019t.\u201d\nStephanie rolls her eyes. \u201cSheesh, it\u2019s called  integrity, Jason. I intend to win this fifty bucks fair and square.\u201d She glances over to Cass and grins. \u201cAnd then the two of us are gonna use them to go hit up House of 'Que downtown for two slabs of baby back ribs.\u201d\nCass licks her lips, touching her middle finger and thumb together before pulling them away from her mouth. Delicious.\nDamian rolls his eyes, muttering something about  omnivores  and  weakness. \n\u201cFine then,\u201d Jason huffs. He plucks a banana from the hanging fruit basket and chucks it at her head. \u201cHappy Breakfast.\u201d\nThe banana bounces off Stephanie\u2019s elbow and she has to fumble to catch it. \u201cThanks,\u201d she says cheerily, already starting to unpeel it. \u201cI appreciate the support.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, is this still the night shift?\u201d\n(Jason is pleased to report that he does  not  startle when Duke suddenly enters the room.)\n(Well, at least not  much.) \n\u201cIt\u2019s the  madrugada  shift,\u201d Stephanie replies. \u201cWhich reminds me, Jay\u2013\u201d She looks over at him, sticking her lip out in a pout. \u201cYou said you were gonna help me with my Spanish homework this semester.\u201d\nJason scoffs. \u201cUh, I never said that.\u201d He starts spooning the lobster mixture back into the shells. \u201cYou were the one who said that I was gonna help you with your Spanish homework.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon,\u201d she pleads. \u201cI suck at Spanish. I bombed that last quiz on preterite tense, so I\u2019ve got a D going right now.\u201d\n\u201cNot like I\u2019m the only bilingual here...\u201d Jason grumbles.\n\u201cYou should ask Bruce,\u201d Tim suggests. \u201cHe knows like, sixteen languages.\u201d\nStephanie snorts. \u201cHard pass, but thanks.\u201d\n\u201cI know Spanish,\u201d Duke says casually. \u201cI went to one of those elementary schools with a bilingual program until fifth grade. We did half the classes in English, half in Spanish, so we all learned both.\u201d\n\u201cOoh,  hola  new BFF!\u201d Stephanie skips over to Duke and loops her arm through his. She looks back at Jason. \u201cJay, you\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m crying on the inside.\u201d\nWhile the others continue to banter back and forth in the background, Jason finishes assembling the thermidor and slides it into the preheated oven. Then he heads back to the pantry and starts pulling out dry ingredients.\u00a0\n\u201cDuke,\u201d he hollers over Stephanie\u2019s chatter, and the boy looks up. \u201cYou\u2019re getting pancakes. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Duke\u2019s face twists up in thought. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a pancake.\u201d\nThe room goes silent. And then it explodes.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Dick blinks at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a pancake?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking right?\u201d Tim demands. \u201cThis is a joke.\u201d\n\u201cDuke!\u201d Stephanie looks aghast.  \u201cEveryone in the world  has had a pancake.\u201d\n\u201cEven my grandfather\u2019s servants prepared us pancakes on occasion,\u201d Damian adds.\nDuke shrugs. \u201cMy mom has celiac disease, so we never really ate gluten growing up, and at the foster homes, I was lucky if they tossed a box of cereal at me in the mornings. Then ever since I\u2019ve been here, everyone\u2019s told me Alfred\u2019s pancakes are terrible, so I figured why start now?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, that is true,\u201d Jason allows, taking out the griddle. \u201cDon\u2019t eat Alfie\u2019s pancakes.\u201d\nCass gives a solemn nod. \u201cHockey pucks,\u201d she agrees.\n\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t really know what the problem is,\u201d Dick says with a grimace. \u201cThe rest of his cooking is all really good...\u201d\n\u201cWe think he might be doing it on purpose,\u201d Tim throws in.\n\u201cBut Jay\u2019s pancakes are great!\u201d Stephanie assures.\nDuke watches warily as Jason starts to measure out the flour. \u201cI dunno man, I\u2019ve made it sixteen years without a pancake\u2014I kinda wanna see how long I can go now.\u201d\n\u201cTt. What utter foolishness,\u201d Damian huffs. \u201cWhat would be the point of that?\u201d\nDuke grins. \u201cI guess it\u2019s like a badge of pride at this point.\u201d\n\u201cPride of  what?\u201d  Stephanie balks. \u201cDenying yourself one of life\u2019s true pleasures?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Jason mutters as he cracks eggs into the bowl. \u201cYou just went raw vegan.\u201d\n\u201cWell screw that,\u201d  she exclaims, throwing her hands up dramatically. \u201cFifty bucks is not  nearly as important as participating in my new bestie\u2019s first pancake experience.\u201d\n\u201cStill don\u2019t know if I want to try pancakes, guys\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo one is leaving this kitchen until you eat a fucking pancake, Duke!\u201d\nThe bickering goes on for the next ten minutes or so, right up until Jason is taking the first batch of pancakes off the griddle. He stacks them onto a plate, then passes it down the counter to where Steph and Cass have laid out just about every possible condiment that could \u2018enhance the pancake experience.\u2019\n(Peer pressure eventually wins out and Duke eats a fucking pancake. He declares it,  fine  and  about what I expected.) \nBeneath his siblings\u2019 chatter, Jason can feel himself starting to fade as he ladles the next round of batter onto the griddle. He supposes it makes sense\u2014he\u2019s been on his feet cooking non-stop for the last two hours, and prior to that he was driving the escape jeep back to Gotham, and prior to  that  he was taking down a drug lord, and prior to  that  there was the whole captivity thing, and prior to  that\u2013 \nThe oven beeps, and Jason sighs and pulls on the oven mitts in a daze before opening the door. He\u2019s just managed to remove the pan of golden-brown-crusted lobster tails and set it on the stove when one final voice interrupts his evening.\n\u201c...Jay?\u201d\u00a0\nJason turns\u2014a bit too quickly, as it causes his head to rush\u2014to see Bruce standing in the doorway, fully dressed in his business clothes.\nGreetings of \u2018Hey Bruce\u2019 and \u2018Good morning, Father\u2019 and \u2018Happy birthday, B!' issue around the room, but Jason and Bruce are locked in a stare.\n\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d Bruce\u2019s gaze falls to the stovetop, and then suddenly, the old man looks so touched he might just start tearing up. \u201cDid you make me\u2026lobster thermidor?\u201d\n \u201cFuck no,\u201d  Jason snorts out, even though it makes his ears ring. \u201cI  stole your\u2026\u201d He takes a breath, black spots dancing before his eyes, the room feeling suddenly farther away. \u201cYour lobster therm\u2026 thermi\u2026\u201d\nAlmost before Jason realizes his knees are buckling under him, Bruce is there at his side, grabbing him by the elbows and lowering him down to sit on the ground, back propped against the kitchen island. Jason squeezes his eyes shut against the wave of dizziness.\nThe room has erupted into absolute chaos now, with little cries of \u2018What happened?\u2019 and \u2018Jay, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 and and \u2018Does anyone know if he\u2019s hurt?\u2019 and \u2018I haven\u2019t seen him patrol in a while\u2026\u2019\n\u201cJay,\u201d Bruce says urgently, and then someone is coaxing a straw to his lips. \u201cI need you to drink this, son.\u201d\nJason grunts and twists his head away because he\u2019s actually feeling kind of sick all of a sudden and he definitely does  not  want to drink anything. But the straw follows his movements, so he finally gives in and sucks on it. The sweet tang of orange juice fills his mouth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. Keep going, lad...\u201d Bruce encourages.\nAfter a few more sips, Jason pulls back and cracks an eyelid open to see seven pairs of worried eyes staring back at him.\u00a0\nJason makes a face. \u201cWho the fuck is buying extra-pulp OJ\u2026\u201d he murmurs.\nThere are multiple relieved exhales, but Bruce just asks seriously, \u201cJason, when\u2019s the last time you ate something?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d That is actually kind of a good question, now that he thinks about it. He and Roy had taken advantage of the last rice and beans delivery to make their move, so they hadn\u2019t gotten to eat  that meal, and then they hadn\u2019t had any money on them during the drive back, so no stops there\u2026 \u201cWhat day \u2018s it?\u201d\nBruce pinches the bridge of his nose in exasperation. \u201cWill one of you please get him some food?\u201d\nOnce again, the kitchen breaks into a flurry of movement and noise.\n\u201cPancakes! Give me pancakes!\u201d\n\u201c\u2013got a whole stack of crackers left\u2013\u201d\n\"Get a plate\u2013\"\n\u201cDuke! Catch!\u201d\n\u201c\u2013think there\u2019s still grits on the stove\u2013\u201d\n\u201cGrab that omelette, Steph!\u201d\n\u201c\u2013half a banana\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d the bacon go? Does anyone see the bacon?\u201d\n\u201cHere, Todd, I have some cocoa left\u2013\u201d\nBefore Jason knows what\u2019s happening, Stephanie is setting a plate heaped with food down onto his lap. He blinks at it dizzily as Cass guides a fork into one shaking hand, while Damian closes the fingers of Jason\u2019s other hand around the handle of a mug.\n\u201cJason?\u201d Tim asks, holding out a separate plate with a whole stuffed lobster tail on it. \u201cDid you want this instead?\u201d\nJason\u2019s stomach rolls at the thought and he grimaces before finally admitting the truth:\u00a0\n\u201cI fucking  hate lobster thermidor.\u201d\nBruce huffs out a short, breathy laugh. \u201cI know, Jay,\u201d he says, leaning back and rubbing his hand comfortingly up and down his son\u2019s arm. \u201cYou always have.\u201d"
