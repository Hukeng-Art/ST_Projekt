    "text": "Harry\nsat up with a start, rubbing his eyes as the vestiges of a nightmare\nfaded into nothing in his mind. He gasped faintly in the quiet, dark\nroom, fighting to slow his breathing so he didn\u2019t wake his dorm\nmates. He no longer woke up screaming. He had trained himself out of\nit somehow, hating the worried expressions Molly would give him when\nhe stayed the summer there, hating the awkward, helpless \u2018you\nalright, mate?\u2019 from Ron, hating the hugs and talks from\nHermione.\n\nHarry\npushed his blankets back and slipped out of the dorm he shared with\nRon and Neville, making his way to the common room. The cold air was\na balm on his overheated skin, cooling the sweat soaked through the\nback of his teeshirt until he felt like he could breathe again.\u00a0\n\nSince\nthe last battle, Harry constantly felt like he was overheating. It\nwas as if coming back from the dead had put his body into overdrive.\nHe was hungrier, ate more, and his skin was always too warm. And\nsometimes he had dreams of being a phoenix, bursting into flames with\nheat and fire prickling under his skin, making him something new and\nyet still the same. The healers said there was nothing wrong with him\nand nothing they could do except teach him stronger cooling charms\nand sent him on his way.\n\nHarry\nstopped short at the doorway; someone was sitting in the common room.\nThey were by the fire, which had been stoked high, filling the room\nwith flickering yellow light but very little warmth. The eighth years\nhad been moved to the third-floor corridor for the year, and the\nheating charms weren\u2019t repaired during the rebuilding. They\nwere weak at best, and nonexistent at worst, which was most of the\ntime.\u00a0\n\nHarry\nthought it was Ron or Ginny for a second but, once his eyes focused,\nhe realised it was just the reflection of the fire off of white-blond\nhair.\n\nDraco\nhad pushed one end of the sofa right in front of the fireplace and\nsat on the edge of the plush violet cushion with his hands so close\nthe fire it had to hurt. He stared at the fire blankly, looking\nthrough the flames without seeing them, occasional shivers wracking\nhis body. Deep shadows of exhaustion ringed his eyes, just as they\nhad every day since they had come back to school.\n\nHarry\nsat down on the other side of the couch.\n\nDraco\u2019s\nwhole body flinched, his hand going for his wand until he saw who it\nwas and hesitated.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d\nHarry said.\n\nDraco\nglared half-heartedly at Harry, his hands wending together in his\nlap, \u201cMerlin Potter, can\u2019t you just go to sleep like a\nnormal person?\u201d\n\u201cI\nsleep,\u201d Harry said pushing his glasses up to rub his eyes.\n\nDraco\nsnorted. \u201cWhen?\u201d he said acidly.\n\u201cBetween\nnightmares,\u201d Harry said, irritably pulling off his glasses and\nwiping off the smudges that he had just made with the edge of his\nteeshirt, \u201cWhen do you sleep, Draco?\u201d\n\nDraco\nfrowned at the \u2018Draco\u2019, but Harry refused to use anything\nthat had to do with their stupid childhood feud.\n\u201cAround\nthree or four, if I\u2019m lucky,\u201d Draco said with surprising\nhonesty.\n\nHarry\nnodded and sighed, \u201cYeah.\u201d He glanced at the fire but\nfound his eyes drawn back to Draco who was staring at him, his brows\nslowly drawing together. Harry raised his eyebrows in a silent\nquestion.\n\u201cWhy\naren\u2019t you freezing your arse off?\u201d Draco asked waving an\nannoyed hand at him.\n\nHarry\nlooked down at his thin tee shirt and sleep pants and shrugged.\n\nDraco\nwas wearing matching green, flannel sleep shirt and pants, wrapped up\nin a robe that was so fluffy it looked like a fur coat with slippers\nto match and yet was still trembling faintly from the cold.\n\nDraco\nfrowned furiously at his non-answer, so Harry reached out a hand.\nWhen Draco just stared at it, Harry waved impatiently. The stubborn\nshit glared at him like it was a trick.\n\nHarry\nmoved over, sitting right next to Draco and grabbed his wrist.\n\nDraco\nflinched, his eyes widening, \u201cAre you ill?\u201d\n\nHarry\nshook his head, \u201cNo. It\u2019s always like this.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s skin was thin, smooth and cold. It was as if he had\nbeen standing out in the snow. Harry could feel the heat leeching off\nhis hand, cooling his hand. It felt\u2026 really nice.\n\nHarry\nblinked slowly, his eyes getting caught like they wanted to pull him\ninto sleep but the lingering heat remained, making him want to pull\nhis clothes off or run outside and go flying. He\u2019d done that\nonce before and had ended up sick. It wasn\u2019t a good idea.\nStripping naked probably wasn\u2019t either.\n\nDraco\ncould have been petrified, he was so still, sitting on the edge of\nthe couch. Harry chewed his bottom lip and then quickly shifted over\nuntil he was half behind Draco, wrapped his arms around him and\nleaned against Draco\u2019s back. He could feel Draco twitch and\nthen go very still, his breathing quick and short like a rabbit\u2019s.\n\nHarry\nexpected Draco to shove him and run off. For a handful of tense\nseconds it seemed like he would but then his breathing slowed, and\nDraco slowly eased back against Harry\u2019s chest until all his\nweight rested against him. His robe was just as soft as it looked.\nHarry kept expecting to feel the heat from Draco\u2019s back, for it\nto grow until it became uncomfortable and Harry would have to let go\u2026\nbut it didn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou\nare far too warm for a normal human being,\u201d Draco said, his\nvoice so tight it was almost strangled.\n\nHarry\nleaned back into the couch, pulling Draco with him. \u201cSince when\nhave I ever been normal?\u201d he asked, closing his eyes\n\nThere\nwas a beat of silence, and then he could feel, more than hear, Draco\nlaughing against him. Harry smiled against the fluffy robe, squeezing\nhis arms around Draco\u2019s sides. He felt Draco slid his hands on\ntop of Harry\u2019s, cold skin meeting hot. Harry spread his fingers\nso Draco\u2019s could slide his between them and sighed at the cool\nslide of his skin.\n\nThere\nwas a long pause.\u00a0\n\u201cI\njust want to sleep,\u201d Draco said faintly.\n\nHarry\nhummed absentmindedly. He could feel the heat leeching off him until\nthe coldness of the room could almost touch him. Right as it seemed\nlike Harry would get cold, he started to feel the faint warmth of\nDraco\u2019s body rising, balancing his own. Harry could feel Draco\nbreathing, the faint echo of Draco\u2019s heartbeat through his\nback. He felt more relaxed and at ease than he had in months.\n\nHarry\u2019s\nhead fell back against the plush cushions of the couch and murmured,\n\u201cThen sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Just\nkeep moving.\nSo long as Draco kept moving he was\nfine, completely normal, just like he used to be.When he stopped,\nsitting in class, meals, staring blankly at the canopy of his bed and\npretending he would fall asleep soon, the cold crept into him.\nStarting in his feet and fingers, slowly creeping up his arms and\nlegs with the cold sinking in like shoots of ice.\n \u00a0Pansy\nand Blaise had suggested he see a healer, as if he had never thought\nof that himself. A healer couldn\u2019t help him. Too much exposure\nto Crucio damaged you. Draco felt lucky he had only ended up with\npoor circulation rather than permanent nerve damage or a mind driven\nto madness.\u00a0\n\u00a0Draco gave up on sleep when the\nwarmth had leeched out of his mountain of blankets, and his feet\nstarted to ache. He wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and\nshuffled to the common room, lighting the fire with a flick of his\nwand and directing few logs onto the grate. He stretched his hands\nand feet out toward the grate as close as he dared until they\nprickled painfully with the needles of warmth that couldn\u2019t\npenetrate deep enough to warm his bones.\n\u00a0He looked\nover at the sound of approaching footsteps, \u201cYou\u2019re\nlate,\u201d Draco said.\n\u00a0Potter ruffled a hand\nthrough his hair with a sheepish smile, \u201cRon wanted to chat.\u201d\n\u00a0Draco humphed faintly, watching as Potter sat in the middle of\nthe couch, dropping the pillow he had brought with him at the end and\nlaying back with a yawn.\u00a0\n\u00a0Draco pulled his feet\nonto the couch, bracing his back on the couch arm. Potter\u2019s\neyes sleepily blinked open and glanced down at him, moving his feet\nuntil they covered the tops of Draco\u2019s. He sighed and smiled\nfaintly.\n\u00a0Draco shivered as Potter\u2019s permanent\nfever soaked through his sock. People weren\u2019t supposed to be so\nwarm. But Potter was. It was like he was burning up inside. Draco\nfeet felt warm for the first time since, well, the night before.\nDraco leaned forward and pressed his hands over the tops of\nPotter\u2019s feet, \u201cWhy are you so warm?\u201d he asked\nabsently for about the tenth time.\n\u00a0\u201cWhy are you\nso cold?\u201d Potter asked back like he always did, his eyes\nclosed.\n\u00a0And here Draco would snipe something about it\nbeing winter and Potter being the freak, and- So, so many excuses.\nAnd he was so, so tired.\n\u00a0\u201cCrucio,\u201d Draco\nsaid softly. He didn\u2019t think Potter would pity him but couldn\u2019t\nbring himself to look at him; so he told the back of the couch. \u201cThe\ndark lord just liked to punish someone when his plans went wrong. And\nAunt Bella\u2026 well I was there. I was always there.\u201d\n\u00a0The couch creaked faintly as Potter sat up, grabbing Draco\u2019s\nhands. When Draco looked up, Potter grinned and flopped back onto his\npillow, dragging Draco with him.\n\u00a0Draco yelped in\nsurprise, half catching himself, half sprawling over Potter\u2019s\nchest.\u00a0\n\u00a0Potter let go of his hands and\nlaughed.\n \u00a0Draco glared at him and pinched his arm.\n \u201cOw! You git!\u201d Potter yelped, jerking his arm\naway.\n \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t knee\nyou in the groin,\u201d Draco grumbled. He gave Potter one more\nglare before dropping his cheek on Potter\u2019s chest.\u00a0\nHe could feel Potter chuckle. He summoned Draco\u2019s blanket\nand tossed it over them. Draco shivered faintly as the blanket warmed\nover his back and began catching Potter\u2019s heat. Potter linked\nhis hands together over Draco\u2019s back, right between his\nshoulder blades.\n\u00a0Draco could feel Potter\u2019s\nthumb absentmindedly moving up and down over his back.\n \u00a0\u201cI\ndied,\u201d Potter said quietly.\n\u00a0Draco looked up at\nhim in surprise.\u00a0\n\u00a0Potter stared at the ceiling,\n\u201cIn the Battle of Hogwarts, I really did die when Riddle hit me\nwith the killing curse, then-\u201d he squeezed his hands and Draco\nfelt the pressure around his body like a hug, Potter\u2019s heart\nwas pounding \u201c-I came back\u2026\u201d\nDraco\nlet his fingers curl around Potter\u2019s shoulders. His faded tee\nshirt was as soft as lambswool.\nPotter sighed and\nlooked down at Draco with a lopsided smile, \u201cEver since then\nI\u2019ve been too warm.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cHmm,\u201d\nDraco said absently, his cheeks feeling inexplicably flushed. He\npressed cheek back against Potter\u2019s chest. He could feel\nPotter\u2019s breath against his hair.\n\u00a0\u201cWhat\nthe hell are we supposed to talk about now?\u201d Draco said\nirritably.\n\u00a0\u201cYou started it,\u201d Potter said\nwith a laugh.\n\u00a0Draco hmphed into Potter\u2019s\nshirt.\n \u00a0\u201cBesides,\u201d Potter went on, \u201cI\u2019m\nsure we\u2019ll think of something.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve\nbeen sleeping better.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cHm?\u201d\nHarry said vaguely, looking up from his textbook at Hermione.\n\u00a0 She\nrolled her eyes, \u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping better,\u201d\nHermione repeated, tapping the corner of her eye, \u201cthe circles\nunder your eyes are gone, and you don\u2019t nap in class, well, as\nmuch.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d\nHarry said, tugging at his tie loose and unbuttoning the top two\nbuttons of his shirt. He didn\u2019t really wear a robe anymore.\n\u00a0 \u201cBut!\u201d\nHermione pointed her quill at his face, \u201cRon says you\u2019re\nusually not in bed in the morning, and sometimes at night. That leads\nme to believe your sleep solution is somewhere, or someone,\nelse.\u201d\n\u00a0 Harry\nblinked blankly at her, \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping in the common\nroom. On a couch,\u201d he added.\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cA couch? A couch is more comfortable than your\nbed.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cWell,\nit\u2019s colder and-\u201d Harry joked, \u201c-there\u2019s a\nlot less snoring.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione\nglanced around at the common room\u2019s stone walls, \u201cIt is\ncold in here. That helps with your overheating problem?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cMy\noverheating problem?\u201d Harry laughed, \u201cYou make it sound\nlike a disease not fit for polite company.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cYou\naren\u2019t fit for polite company, Potter, in case it had escaped\nyour notice,\u201d Draco said with a faint sneer as he strode past\nthem, heading for the door.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlaughed. He was fairly impressed how Draco somehow managed to look\npoised while wearing three jumpers along with a heavy woollen robe.\nHarry closed his books and pushed them away, and Draco paused.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nfelt inexplicably pleased and quickly asked, \u201cWhere are you\ngoing so late?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe\nlibrary. There\u2019s a book I need before Pince leaves,\u201d\nDraco said, he took a step then hesitated again.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nquickly pushed his chair back and stepped through the maze of chairs\nto reach Draco, \u201cFor the charms assignment? I\u2019ve been\nhaving trouble with that too.\u201d He held his breath, mostly\nexpecting Draco to refuse him or even ridicule him but he only\nglanced at Hermione with a flicker of anxiety before heading out to\nthe hallway with Harry at his heel.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\ngave Hermione a brief wave as he left, ignoring the puzzled look on\nher face.\n\u00a0 \u00a0They\nwalked side by side in silence. Curfew was close, and along with the\ncold, not many people were prone to linger, so the hallways were\nempty.\n\u00a0 \u201cAre\nyou actually having trouble with the charms assignment or just\nlooking for an excuse to harass me?\u201d Draco asked as they turned\nthe corner.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlooked over and smiled. Draco had pulled his hands into the sleeves\nof his jumpers and was clutching them tightly to his chest.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nshrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s tricky, all the little variations. I\nwished someone had warned me that so many high-level charms are\nintensely specific alterations to the basic charms you learn first\noff.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nsmirked very faintly, glancing over at Harry, \u201cI\u2019ve\nmastered sixteen different light and illumination charms so far.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSixteen?\u201d\nHarry groaned, \u201cI\u2019ve only found eight!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nchuckled, \u201cYou can borrow, Ms Olga\u2019s Household Charms for\nEvery Occasion, once we get back. I\u2019ve finished with it for\nnow.\u201d He leaned his face down, his hair fluttering down around\nhis eyes as he huffed on the tips of his fingers. His cheeks and the\ntip of his nose were flushed pink by the chill.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nreached out, taking Draco by the arm and pulling him closer.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t\nmanhandle me,\u201d Draco muttered, none-the-less allowing Harry to\ntake his arm and free his hand from the sweater.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlaced his fingers with Draco\u2019s; they were so cold they could\nhave been carved out of marble. He stopped walking and rubbed Draco\u2019s\nfingers between both his hands until some warmth came back into\nthem.\u201cThe library is going to close soon,\u201d Draco said a\nlittle sourly, his brow furrowing with irritation.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\ngestured for Draco to give him his other hand, \u201cHurry up then.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nshoved his hand in Harry\u2019s face, glowering at Harry\u2019s\ncollar,\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you even bother with a tie if you\u2019re\nnot going to wear it properly,\u201d he muttered.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\ngrinned, pressing Draco\u2019s hands together between his own, \u201cI\nwas wearing it properly. I just got warm and had to loosen it.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nrolled his eyes.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre\nyou even wearing a tie under all those jumpers?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf\ncourse I am,\u201d Draco said, affronted at the very notion, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot some sort of hooligan.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nburst out laughing.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nleaned against his shoulder with a chuckle of his own.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlead the way to the library, holding one of Draco\u2019s hands\ntightly, wrapping the other around his forearm.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis\nis ridiculous,\u201d Draco sighed, \u201cI feel like I should have\na bonnet and a bustle.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u201cI\ncould let go?\u201d Harry offered, loosening his grip.\n\u00a0 Draco\ntightened his grip, \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d\nHarry grinned, \u201cWhat book are you getting anyway?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMs\nOlga\u2019s Charms for Seasonal Celebrations and before you ask, yes\nyou may borrow it after,\u201d Draco said.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\npressed a little closer against Draco, \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nlicked his lips and twitched his wand slightly more the left as he\nperformed the fairy light charm, a small orb of green light pooled at\nthe end. Once it was the size he wanted, about as big as a grape, he\nmade a minute circle with the tip of his wand and traced a small U\naway from the green light, his wand tailing a strand of silver, then\nthe charm incantation and movement, central and down. A blue light a\nlittle darker than a lumos began to form, his brow furrowed as he\nconcentrated, making sure the lights would all be the same size and\nshape, connecting them with silver threads of light. He followed the\nblue light with a yellow then red and purple.\n\u00a0 \u00a0He\nwas in the middle of making an orange light when a loud knock from\nthe door to his rooms broke his concentration. Draco frowned at the\nend of his wand where a light ought to have been and instead was\nnothing. The rest of the fairy lights were stable though and glowed\nprettily against the sheets.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\ndo you want, Potter?\u201d Blaise asked coolly.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\num, I was looking for Draco?\u201d Potter asked as eloquently as\nalways.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\npushed himself up to the top of his bed, pulling the blankets down\njust enough to peek out.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Potter\nrubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, looking nervous.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Blaise\nwas sitting forward defensively on the edge of his vision, \u201cCan\u2019t\nyou leave off, Potter? Haven\u2019t you anyone else to harass?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nsaw Potter\u2019s brow furrow, and he interrupted before the\nconversation could become an argument, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThey both turned to look at him, \u201cYou\u2019re here about the\nbook?\u201d Draco asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Potter\nnodded.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nsighed, \u201cCome in then.\u201d He held up the edge of the\nblanket, \u201ctake off your shoes and don\u2019t stretch the\nopening too much or it\u2019ll break the space.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Potter\nleaned over, peering into the blankets, \u201cOh, a wizarding space?\n\u2026In blankets?\u201d\n\u00a0 Draco\nfrowned at him, \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you ever build a blanket\nfort growing up?\u201d\n\u00a0 Potter\nshrugged, kicking off his shoes and sitting on Draco\u2019s pillow.\n\u00a0 \u201cWhat\nthe fuck?\u201d Blaise said faintly.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\npromised to lend Potter a book for class,\u201d Draco said as he\nscooted down in the small tent sized space.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwon\u2019t be long,\u201d Potter told Blaise. He slipped his feet\nthrough, wiggling down until he was even with Draco, \u201cSo this\nis how wizards build a blanket fort?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nraised an eyebrow, \u201cHow else would you do it?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith\na lot more blankets usually,\u201d Potter said.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nlooked around critically, \u201cMy mother is particularly good at\ntemporary extension charms. It\u2019s just that the bigger you make\nthem, the more likely they are to collapse, and there\u2019s no\nreason to make it bigger since it would only lose heat faster and-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nlike it,\u201d Potter said and smiled at him.\n\nDraco\nsmiled faintly back and turned to the book he had left by the side of\nhis pillow, \u201cI\u2019ve been practising the fairy light\ncharms.\u201d\n\nPotter\nshifted onto his back and looked up at all the different fairy lights\nDraco had strung across the ceiling of the small space. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d\nHe said, reaching up and brushing his fingers through the blue light.\nHe turned his head to ask Draco, \u201cHow do you keep them all the\nsame size?\u201d\n\nTheir\nfaces were mere inches apart. Draco could see flecks of brown in the\ngreen of Potter\u2019s eyes. His eyelashes were very long.\n\u201cDraco?\u201d\nPotter asked, a smile curling up on his lips.\n\nDraco\ntook a deep breath, tearing his eyes away, \u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nPotter said, \u201cwell, move over.\u201d He pulled his arm up,\nwrapping it around Draco\u2019s shoulders and pulling him closer.\n\n\nDraco\nrested his head on Potter\u2019s shoulder and took out his wand, \u201cI\nshall show you how to keep the size consistent. Pay attention. It\u2019s\nall in the wrist-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHermione!\u201d\nHarry laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hermione\nshook her head, \u201cAbsolutely not. I don\u2019t- No.\u201d She\nstomped ahead of them.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot that bad is it?\u201d Ron said, trying to catch up to her,\n\u201cHarry getting a better mark than us- you. It\u2019s bound to\nhappen one of these days right? Just odds.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hermione\nstopped in her tracks, \u201cThis is just like sixth-year potions.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing like sixth-year potions,\u201d Harry said with a sigh.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\nhad help,\u201d Hermione said, pointing an accusing finger at him.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nrolled his eyes, \u201cYeah, but not like sixth-year.\u201d He\nflipped open his bag and took out the two Ms Olga\u2019s charm books\nhe had planned to return before dinner and held them out, \u201cSee?\nJust regular library books.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hermione\nsnatched them out of his hands, \u201cYou used these? Why didn\u2019t\nyou share them?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwas borrowing them myself,\u201d Harry said.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nneed to look at these,\u201d Hermione said, already opening the\nfirst book.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwas going to return them before dinner,\u201d Harry protested.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hermione\nnodded absently, walking into the common room as she read, \u201cI\u2019ll\njust have a look, then take them back myself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cMione!\u201d\nRon groaned, \u201cI thought we were going to have, y'know, like\nquality time now that the big exam\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHeating\ncharms!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cUhuh,\u201d\nHermione said absently, dropping onto a couch by the fire, \u201cWe\ncan read it together then.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ron\ngroaned, shot Harry a beleaguered look and sat on the couch next to\nher.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHeating\ncharms!\u201d Seamus snapped from the other side of the fireplace,\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s contributing! Come on!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hermione\ntook her wand out and cast a wordless heating charm over the room.\nRon quickly followed suit.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\ncast one as well, over by the fire where it wouldn\u2019t settle on\nhim too much. All the furniture in the room had been pushed into the\ntight ring around the blazing fireplace so anyone would have to step\nover armrests to go in or out. That didn\u2019t stop what seemed\nlike every eighth-year student gathering clustered together in the\ncrowded mess. The largest sofa had been left by the window,\napparently too heavy to bother moving.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nOutside\nsnow was falling in tiny crystals, sparkling when the light from\ninside hit them. Harry pulled the latest Quidditch Monthly out of his\nbag and laid back on the large couch, enjoying the cold radiated from\nthe tall windows.\n\u00a0 \u00a0He\nwas deep into an article about the viability of the new horseshoe\nfeint in Quidditch matches when he heard someone stomping down the\nhallway from their dorms. It was a very familiar stomp. A smile crept\nonto Harry\u2019s face as Draco stopped next to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nglanced over his magazine. Draco was wearing a jumper and had a\nblanket as well as his comforter wrapped around his shoulders but was\nstill shivering.\n\u00a0 \u00a0For\na second they just looked at one another and then Draco glowered at\nhim. He kicked Harry\u2019s leg out of the way so he could get on,\nbracing his arm on the back of the sofa and shoving Harry\u2019s\nmagazine out of the way so he could collapse onto Harry unimpeded.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlaughed in surprise, halfheartedly smacking Draco with his magazine.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\ngrumbled something into Harry\u2019s chest, pulling his blankets\nover his head and wriggling around to pull his blankets tighter\naround himself. Harry propped his magazine on Draco\u2019s back,\nabsent-mindedly tangling their legs together.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHarry?\u201d\nRon called, his voice strangled.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlooked over at his best friends and found the whole room leaning over\nthe backs of their chairs to stare at him.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nfucking told you,\u201d Blaise hissed to Pansy.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Pansy\nresponded with a faint whimper.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Ron\u2019s\nwhole face had gone so pale his freckles stood out like ink spots.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm,\nHarry?\u201d Hermione said quietly, her voice carrying in the dead\nsilence, \u201cAre- Are you dating, Malfoy?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nblinked, his heart rate picking up. He pulled up the edge of Draco\u2019s\nblanket, \u201cAre we dating?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Draco\nhuffed in annoyance, turning his head to prop his chin on Harry\u2019s\nchest. His fine blond hair clung to his cheek in a loose staticy\nmess, and Harry found himself carefully trying to tuck it back neatly\nbehind his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Draco\u2019s\nhands pressed against Harry\u2019s chest as he leaned forward and\nkissed him with lips that seemed unfairly soft. He slowly pulled\nback, searching Harry\u2019s expression and then smiled faintly, \u201cI\nsuppose we are,\u201d he said quietly and pulled blankets back over\nhimself.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Harry\nlooked back over at Hermione, \u201cLooks that way,\u201d he said\nwith a brilliant smile, curling an arm over Draco\u2019s back before\npicking up his magazine.\n\n-Fin-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\nHarry turned his head to glare at Draco who was laying, not in the\nshade like a sane human being, but fully clothed in the sun. Draco\ngrinned at him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand-\u201d Harry groaned, he had\nalready stripped off his shirt, and he\u2019d get yelled at by at\nleast three people if he took off his trousers.\n\u201cI\u00a0do,\u00a0you ass.\u201d\n\u201c-I am literally dying,\u201d Harry went on, \u201cI am\ncooking in my own skin. I am a broiler, a toaster oven, a campfire-\u201d\nDraco laughed, looking far too amused.\n\u201cThe sun is\u00a0trying\u00a0to kill me,\u201d Harry\nsaid.\n\u201cWe could go back to your room in the dungeons,\u201d Draco\nsaid, \u201cThe one I helped you get so that this wouldn\u2019t\nhappen?\u201d\nHarry pushed himself up on his elbows and looked out over the\nlawns. Hermione was reading under a tree with Ron\u2019s head in her\nlap, and Ginny and Luna were making flower crowns with the Patil\ntwins and Pansy. Dean and Seamus were trying to teach Blaise and Theo\nhow to play football, their robes heaped into makeshift goals on the\ngrass.\nHarry had wanted to spend some time with his friends. They\u2019d\nfinally finished their exams and could relax, but instead of having\nfun, he was miserable. He actually missed the dank, miserable,\nblessedly cool dungeons.\nDraco laughed again, \u201cAlright, toaster oven.\u201d He stood\nup, shrugged off his robes and shoes.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Harry asked, sitting up.\nDraco pulled off his socks, loosening his tie and pulling it over\nhis head, dropping it on top of the pile. He held his hand out, and\nHarry let himself be pulled up.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go swimming,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Harry said, already kicking off his tennis\nshoes before Draco changed his mind.\nDraco raised an eyebrow, \u201cObviously,\u201d he gestured at\nhimself.\nHarry grinned with childlike glee, pulling Draco down to the shore\nof Black lake. He charged into the cold water and got up to his knees\nbefore he had to stop, as Draco gripping his hand so hard it hurt\nwith a yelp of dismay as the water washed over his feet.\n\u201cC-cold!\u201d Draco said, jerking back.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry said, letting himself be pulled out of\nthe water, \u201cThat\u2019s the point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be that cold!\u201d Draco\nsaid in dismay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just turned summer,\u201d Harry said. He\nloosened his grip, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll go in for a bit, and you\ncan enjoy the sun.\u201d\nDraco bit his lip, staying on the shore as Harry walked out into\nthe water, just up to his shoulders. He took off his glasses and\ndunked his head under, sighing with relief when he came up, pushing\nhis hair back and putting his glasses back on his nose.\nHarry had hardly heard the splashes before his arms were full of a\nDraco Malfoy, clinging to his shoulders, gasping from the cold.\nHarry pulled Draco close, \u201cWhat-! Have you lost your mind?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said fiercely, and then instantly changed\nhis mind as he began to shiver, \u201cM-maybe.\u201d\nHarry grinned, ducking down and wrapping his arms under Draco\u2019s\narse, lifting him halfway up out of the water as he gasped and clung\non even tighter.\n\u201cH-Harry!\u00a0Now,\u00a0who\u2019s lost their\nmind?!\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cMe,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut I\u2019m in good\ncompany.\u201d\nDraco thumped his shoulder lightly, \u201cYou had better not drop\nme.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cLiar,\u201d Draco said, trying not to smile.\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s-!\u201d Draco smacked him again, \u201cYou\u2019re\nsupposed to lie!\u201d\nHarry laughed, \u201cAlright! Alright! I\u2019ll never drop you\nthen.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Fine,\u201d Draco said, mollified. His button-up\nshirt clung to his skin, coloured pink where it stuck to his skin,\nwell suited to his pout and the damp ends of his hair, wet by his\nreckless splashing.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco asked, his expression softening as Harry\nstudied him.\n\u201cMove in with me?\u201d Harry asked.\nDraco\u2019s breath caught, \u201c\u2026you want to live\ntogether?\u201d\nHarry nodded.\nDraco bit his lip fighting down a smile, \u201cAs if you could be\nrid of me. I have absolutely no interest in being cold ever again.\u201d\nHarry smiled in a blossom of relief and happiness, \u201cI\u2019ll\nnever let you get cold again.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re doing a terrible job of it,\u201d Draco\nteased, and as if his own words reminded him of the cold water a\nshiver shuddered through him.\nHarry tightened his grip and carried Draco back toward the shore,\nletting him down when the water was only knee-deep.\n\u201cWhat are you idiots doing?\u201d Pansy called down to\nthem.\n\u201cCooling off,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cFreezing to death,\u201d Draco shouted back, \u00a0walking\nback onto the shore, \u201cDry me off, Pans?\u201d\nPansy rolled her eyes and cast a drying and warming charm at him,\nleaving Draco looking rumpled and windswept.\nDraco irritably patted his hair down and turned back towards the\nlake, hands on his hips, \u201cComing out of the water anytime\nsoon?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, \u201cEventually.\u201d\nDraco tried to look irritated but only managed something between\nbemused and fond.\n\u201cMerlin, just get married already,\u201d Pansy said in faux\ndisgust.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rush,\u201d Draco said, looking only at\nHarry, \u201cwe have to live together for a while first.\u201d\nHarry smiled, his heart squeezing so hard it seemed too big for\nhis chest, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n"
