    "summary": "<p>Months after the Avengers' dispute in Germany, the team returns to the US and moves back into the tower. As always, everyone pretends that nothing happened. Tony is just fine with this. He's used to pretending, and he'll be damned if he lets any of them see him flinch.</p>\n<p>Tony's the bad guy, after all. He's used to it. He's fine with it. He's good at it.</p>\n<p>Only now, there's something far worse loitering around the tower - The Winter Soldier. No one notices the guy at first, but when they do, Tony figures that he should have the soldier's back. </p>\n<p>Birds of a feather should flock together, and the bad guys should start a book club.</p>",
    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So, I'm a recovering alcoholic. The first chapter of this was written while I was still drinking, the second while I was a couple weeks sober, and the third after I had a few months of sobriety under my belt. I think each chapter maybe kinda reflects the mood and state of mind I was in when I wrote it, but anywho.</p>\n<p>I've really relied on this story for the last few months - for the cathartic outlet it gave me, and for the comments and kudos from all of you. On some days, the support and encouragement people gave me while I writing this seemed like the only good thing happening in my life. I wanted to say thank you for reading, and for making my life just a little bit brighter when things were looking grim. Things are far better now, but I don't think \"better\" would have happened as quickly as it did without the positive encouragement I received for this story.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you, and I hope you enjoyed the story.</p>",
    "text": "Tony thought that nothing could be worse than being tortured in a cave in Afghanistan and then literally getting his heart ripped out by a man he admired and trusted.\nIt turned out that getting the blame for the destruction of a city and then getting his heart metaphorically ripped out by people who were considered the paragons of virtue and honor and good was far worse.\nThe kicker, though, was having to live and work with those people after said ripping out of the heart, and then having to pretend that nothing was wrong.\n\u201cMassive expansion,\u201d Tony said as an excuse when Sam invited him to the newly reinstated team movie night.\nWith a frown, Sam suspiciously asked, \u201cMassive expansion of what?\u201d\n\u201cProduction plants,\u201d Tony replied, keeping his eyes on the blueprints he was pretending to review and approve (the schematics had been greenlighted months ago, the materials purchased, and SI would be breaking ground on three new facilities within the month. Sam didn\u2019t need to know that, though). \u201cI leave for Korea in two days.\u201d\nHis brow furrowing, Sam argued, \u201cWe\u2019re watching Star Wars. It will be Bucky\u2019s first time seeing it. Clint says you hold house rights on showing sci-fi movies to alien beings and humans out-of-time.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Tony said, doing his best to sound convincingly disappointed. \u201cBetween the facilities in Korea, Chile, and Morocco, it will be a few months before I have enough downtime for any Star Wars marathons.\u201d\n\u201cA few months?\u201d Sam incredulously asked.\nGiving Sam a well-practiced pair of sad eyes, Tony told him, \u201cNo self-respecting person living in the 21st century can go that long without seeing Star Wars, I know. How about this - I relinquish house rights on Star Wars just this once. I\u2019ll make it up with Star Trek and Firefly. And Pitch Black. And 2001 Space Odyssey.\u201d\n\u201cDude, Star Wars,\u201d Sam wheedled.\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m flying to South Korea in 36 hours,\u201d Tony argued.\nThirty-six hours later, FRIDAY patched a call from Pepper through to the suit.\n\u201cTony, why are you flying to South Korea?\u201d Pepper asked.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d help out with the heavy lifting,\u201d Tony replied.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cHand it over. As Lord Commander of Stark Tower and the Avengers, I demand that you relinquish all hot food to my care for a thorough inspection-\u201d\n\u201cBack, Stark! Down!\u201d Scott Lang demanded, holding the foil encased casserole dish well out of Tony\u2019s reach -- damn Tony\u2019s compact stature! Damn his recessive height genes! \u201cAnd stop trying to implement fictional command structures to the team! You may be a Stark, but we aren\u2019t playing any game of thrones, we aren\u2019t the Night\u2019s Watch, and winter isn\u2019t coming for three months. Back, I said!\u201d\n\u201cI need to make sure it isn\u2019t poisoned!\u201d Tony insisted, making another grab for the divine smelling dish.\n\u201cYou can test it\u2019s toxicity along with everyone else at dinner tonight!\u201d Lang insisted.\n\u201cFire where now?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cGeeze, Stark, don\u2019t tell me you forgot - it\u2019s ethnic food night,\u201d Lang informed him.\nTony did his best to keep from falling into a defensive stance.\nLang was still talking. \u201c- my traditional Irish shepherd's pie along with T\u2019Challa\u2019s fataya, whatever German dish Steve has been slow cooking for the past two days, and the leeks Wanda has been stinking up the tower with.\u201d\n\u201cFoiled again,\u201d Tony said with a dramatic sigh. \u201cCome on, Lang? Just a bite for the road?\u201d\n\u201cFor the road?\u201d Ant-Man repeated with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming to ethnic food night? The team\u2019s been planning this for a month! Sam\u2019s trying his hand at a Cuban dish, and Clint promised some sort of French cheese thing-\u201d\n\u201cThe team may have been planning this for a month, but SI has been organizing-\u201d he chanced a glance at his phone, and FRIDAY helpfully supplied him with Maria Stark Foundation Charity Benefit @ 8:30P.M. in Boston, \u201c- a shindig at my alma mater for the past six months. Lord Commander Stark\u2019s participation is mandatory.\u201d\nLang was still frowning. \u201cBut Natasha said you\u2019re responsible for the Italian. Fotacha?\u201d\n\u201cFocaccia,\u201d Tony absently corrected as he began madly texting Happy and his tailor. \u201cMy mother\u2019s recipe, e stasera no. Duty calls. Or technically, people with so much money they can afford to give it away by the fistfuls to absolute strangers call. You run your heists, I\u2019ll run mine. But hey, if Rhodey makes that rice dish he picked up in Egypt, eat an extra bite for me. I don\u2019t know what sort of opiates go into that stuff, but it\u2019s addictive, I swear.\u201d\nThat evening, when Tony climbed into the back of his waiting car, Happy asked, \u201cYou avoiding a SHIELD budget meeting this evening?\u201d\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Tony replied.\n\u201cPepper told them not to email you an agenda beforehand. They promised they wouldn\u2019t announce meeting topics until you were in the room and had your ass planted in a chair.\u201d\nTony made sure to take note of this new machination.\nNatasha was watching him with narrowed eyes.\n\u201cYou went through three walls,\u201d she informed him.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony agreed, careful to keep his posture slumped and relaxed.\n\u201cYou need to visit the med bay,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cYou noticed that I went through three walls but you didn\u2019t notice that I was wearing my armor when it happened?\u201d Tony argued.\n\u201cYour armor only does so much,\u201d she snapped.\n\u201cTwo years ago, sure,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t around for the post-Cap-battle upgrades, though.\u201d To demonstrate the awesomeness of his latest impact-upgrades to the suit, Tony tapped his knuckles against his sternum. \u201cMy armor could take a hit from Thor and the insulated padding would make it feel like a love tap. A brick wall, or walls as the case may be, felt like cotton.\u201d\n\u201cThat must be nice,\u201d Natasha sniffed. \u201cHaving padded armor which protects you from serious impacts while the rest of us were beaten half to hell this morning while wearing our regular old combat gear.\u201d\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t pout,\u201d Tony demanded. \u201cYou want the special insulation, I can totally build a suit of armor for you. It would make stealth difficult, but-\u201d\nWith an aggravated huff, Natasha pushed off of the counter she was leaning against, bairly flinching from her injuries, then said, \u201cIf you need anything, the rest of the team will be getting treated in the med bay.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Tony hummed.\nAn hour latter, Peter Parker\u2019s aunt was putting stitches into his leg while Peter wrapped his cracked ribs.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have medical professionals at the Tower to do this for you?\u201d May asked. \u201cWait, don\u2019t answer that. I know you have medical professionals at the Tower to do this for you. Half of my coworkers at the hospital are on a freaking waiting list to be considered for that very job. The Stark Tower Medical Unit is the single most coveted position in the entire city\u2019s health community.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a bit crowded today,\u201d was all Tony would tell her.\nIt was fine when Tony was interacting with his teammates one-on-one, or in small groups of three or four. The more Avengers there were in one room, however, the harder it was for Tony to keep his cool.\nWhen Tony found himself with five or more Avengers at once, he felt like he was living in that children\u2019s song about monkeys jumping on beds before falling off and hurting themselves. Except that instead of a bump to the head, the chant which ran through Tony\u2019s mind was something more along the lines of One fell off and put an arrow attached to a line through my back in an attempt to keep himself from plummeting to the earth below. Or one fell off and cushioned her fall by pulling some Inception bullshit to get me to lie between her and the pavement. Or that one didn\u2019t fall off at all, but pushed me so that I fell instead.\nTony didn\u2019t like being an Avenger anymore.\nThe alternative to being an Avenger, however, was to not be an Avenger, or house the Avengers, or supply the Avengers with intel and weapons. And if he wasn\u2019t doing all of that, someone else would, and he didn\u2019t trust anyone else not to go \u201cSHIELD is Hydra\u201d on their asses all over again.\nAs long as he spent time with only a few of them in small doses, everything was fine.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve called.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mon Capitan?\u201d Tony immediately replied, turning on his heel so that he was facing Steve but still moving away from him.\nTechnically, Tony was backing away from him, but Tony was backing away towards the kitchen which was where he had been headed anyways, so it wouldn\u2019t be immediately obvious that carefully and quickly backing away from Steve was exactly what he was doing.\nHopefully. Maybe.\n\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Steve carefully asked as he dogged Tony\u2019s movements.\n\u201cI am up to my eyes in work,\u201d Tony answered, only turning his back to Steve once he had arrived in the kitchen. As Steve took a seat on one of the stools at the bar, Tony quickly put the island between him and Steve and then watched the super soldier\u2019s reflection in the chrome finish of the kitchen appliances. \u201cAnd everyone knows that if you\u2019re up to your eyes in work, you need to be completely submerged in coffee. Ooh, FRIDAY. Take note. Coffee bath. Like, in the pool area next to the hot-tub. A coffee-tub. Or a coffee-wave-pool. FRIDAY, I want the tower to be Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory only with coffee instead of chocolate. Well, maybe a little chocolate -- mochas are never a bad thing. Clint can be the Oompa-Loompas. FRIDAY, you can be the flying elevator at the end of the movie. We\u2019ll need to hire someone to be Willy Wonka, though. I don\u2019t grow or roast coffee, FRIDAY. I drink it. I\u2019ll be Augustus Gloop. Lord Commander Augustus of Wonka\u2019s-Coffee-Tower and-\u201d\nTony almost had a coronary when Steve\u2019s hand came down on his, halting his attempt to take a sip of the freshly brewed coffee he\u2019d just poured for himself.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough coffee today,\u201d Steve quietly told him. \u201cI wanted\u2026 We need to talk, but I think it might be best if you go get some sleep first, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Tony numbly agreed as he carefully set his mug on the counter (he liked that mug. He really, really liked that mug. It deserved better than to be smashed against Steve Rogers\u2019 face. In the Captain America vs. Mug battle, the mug would loose, and Tony liked that mug). \u201cSleep. Okay then.\u201d\nSteve was right, of course. As Tony quickly and surely made his way towards the penthouse, Tony knew that Steve was right. Tony really needed some sleep. Sleep meant that he would be fully alert the next time he faced Steve, and he wouldn\u2019t forget to keep eyes on the other man. Sleep meant that no one would sneak up on him or intrude in his space or touch him or-\nTony clearly needed sleep.\nThe Avengers had been in residence for six months, and Tony had done a fine job of avoiding Bucky Barnes during that time. The rest of the team - fine. Whatever. He could handle them. But Barnes? Tony needed time to deal with that shit.\nSix months was more than enough time to properly armor himself, though, so when Tony pressed the button for the common floor and FRIDAY informed him, \u201cSargent Barnes is currently reading in the living area, Boss,\u201d Tony didn\u2019t immediately say fuck that and press the button for the penthouse. Instead, Tony said, \u201cFuck that. I\u2019m too tired for the half-caff shit Vision keeps sneaking into my coffee maker. I want the full strength stuff they keep in the Action room.\u201d\nFRIDAY didn\u2019t reply. Instead, the button for the common floor lit up and the elevator began to move.\nWhen Tony stepped from the elevator, Barnes glanced up from the paperback book he was reading, spotted Tony, and treated him to a narrow-eyed gaze.\nTony stopped walking when he saw the title of the book Barnes was reading.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Barnes replied.\n\u201cThe guy who was kidnapped, held prisoner, and then brainwashed is reading a book about a guy who kidnaps a woman, holds her prisoner, and attempts to brainwash her.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was only Hydra,\u201d Barnes informed him. \u201cApparently that sort of treatment isn\u2019t reserved for megalomaniacs attempting to create weapons. It\u2019s for people in love, as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not love,\u201d Tony announced, pointing an accusing finger at the book.\n\u201cFor her, no. For him? It\u2019s the only sort of love he knows. It\u2019s what he feels and what he understands. Just because it\u2019s unhealthy, destructive, and unconventional doesn\u2019t mean that his emotions are invalid.\u201d\n\u201cHe tortures that poor woman,\u201d Tony pointed out.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s imperfect,\u201d Barnes agrees. \u201cIf he truly wanted to find love, he would assess his limitations and objectively consider his possibilities. There are plenty of pretty young girls out there who are desperate to escape their lives and would be susceptible to the emotional manipulation he\u2019s attempting to employ -\u201d\n\u201cGreat science, you admire that sick son of a bitch,\u201d Tony realized.\n\u201cI admire his ambition,\u201d Barnes corrected. \u201cHe is a simple man with simple needs with the means of getting what he wants. He\u2019s a complete idiot about it, of course. But he doesn\u2019t care about power or influence or prestige. He\u2019s a lonely man in need of company, and he would be content with such.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be naive,\u201d Tony snorted. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been on ice for most of your existence, but you should understand just as well as anyone that nothing ever works like that. He built some fantasy in his head, and that girl was lucky enough to die before he could be faced with reality. Once he was faced with reality, he would have dealt with it the same way he dealt with everything else in his life - inappropriately. Probably with violence. And if things had gone his way? Well that wouldn\u2019t have gone well either. The reality wouldn\u2019t have been as good as the fantasy, and his behavior would escalate until-\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, Stark,\u201d Barnes demanded with a sneer. \u201cIt\u2019s a story. He\u2019s not a real person.\u201d\n\u201cYet here you are talking about how great he is-\u201d\n\u201cI just called him an idiot!\u201d Barnes argued. \u201cI don\u2019t admire him. I relate to him, you ass. I\u2019m not good at interacting with people or the world and I don\u2019t like to, but I\u2019m lonely. I\u2019d like nothing more than to go sequester myself in a cabin somewhere and steal a bit of company, but I\u2019m not stupid. I know that wouldn\u2019t make me feel better, and I know perfectly well what Stockholm Syndrome is. Now fuck off, or else I\u2019ll make a point of being present any time you watch any of those futuristic movies you like so much, and I\u2019ll tear apart your favorite characters in all of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you even get that?\u201d Tony asked, motioning to the book.\n\u201cNatasha\u2019s room,\u201d Barnes replied.\nBarnes should have started with that fact. Tony made a quick retreat before Natasha realized that someone had been in her room and that they had taken something from it.\nSam had family, Rhodey had family, Lang had family, and Clint had family. Clint took Natasha to the farm (and Tony was always a bit uncomfortable saying that, because it sounded like a euphemism for enforced superhero retirement, and because Tony was sure that Laura had enough tranqs hidden around the house that such a euphemism could one day become applicable).\nSteve stayed in the kitchen for the most part, cooking enough food to feed the handful of Avengers who remained in the tower, Santa, Santa\u2019s reindeer, and Santa\u2019s army of dwarves.\n\u201cElves, Stark. Elves,\u201d Wanda corrected for the fifth time.\n\u201cElves, dwarves, ents, orcs - whatever LotR species Santa is conscripting to assist in toy making this year, Steve is cooking enough food to feed them all,\u201d Tony replied.\n\u201cThank you, Wanda,\u201d Vision said with a small smile as he finished inspecting\u2026 whatever it was that Wanda had stuffed into a too small, glittery, green-and-red bag for Vision.\nTony was glad that Vision had opened his gift from Wanda before Tony stuck his hand into the snowflake covered bag she\u2019d given him. The forewarning was appreciated.\nHe was also able to tell her, \u201cYou are such a troll. You are a Christmas troll. Please tell me you gave Natasha your first attempt.\u201d\n\u201cGeneral Ross received my first attempt. He has been instructed to wear it to the summit next month. It has beads.\u201d\nLaughing, Tony said, \u201cForget Santa. You are responsible for all of the Christmas miracles. So, uh\u2026. Thank you for the\u2026 homemade knitted\u2026 is it supposed to be a cummerbund?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cowl,\u201d she corrected with a frown.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a cowl?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cIs it like a towel? Is this supposed to be used like one of those paperless drying mechanisms in cheap gas stations where everyone drys their hands on the same cloth and its always damp no matter how much you turn it-\u201d\n\u201cThe pattern\u2019s creator described it as a clothing garment to wear draped around the neck, similar to a scarf but with closed ends,\u201d Vision quickly supplied.\n\u201cOh. Cool. Thanks, Wanda. And keep practicing! Hey, give it a couple more tries and the neck clothing garment you give me next Christmas might show up on the front cover of Vanity Fair as the next great winter fashion.\u201d\n\u201cThat one is more likely to wind up on the cover of Vanity Fair,\u201d Wanda pointed out. \u201cFashion is like modern art - put something formless and ugly on a person, put that person on a magazine, and suddenly it is considered attractive.\u201d\n\u201cYou see?! You\u2019re a fashion diva in the making. If that whole crime fighting thing doesn\u2019t work out for you, you can always fall back on-\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Barnes asked as he unwrapped Tony\u2019s present.\n\u201cIt appears to be a collection of dead insects,\u201d Vision supplied.\nAnd of course Steve chose that exact moment to deliver a fresh batch of cinnamon rolls to the living room. The blond frowned at the framed butterfly specimen which Bucky had unwrapped. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 beautiful,\u201d Steve slowly said. \u201cBut\u2026 why would someone do this to something so pretty? It seems cruel.\u201d\n\u201cPreserving butterflies and other insects in special glass boxes is extremely common,\u201d Vision oh-so-helpfully explained.\nBarnes blinked at the glass encased butterflies with their Latin names written underneath, then at Tony. \u201cWhat\u2026 what is this for? Am I supposed to\u2026 do something with 'em?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 for decoration,\u201d Tony said slowly.\n\u201cYou think Bucky wants to decorate his apartment with dead butterflies?\u201d Wanda asked, eyeing Tony as if he were insane.\n\u201cWell, no, it\u2019s just\u2026 The Collector,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cBy John Fowles? The book? It\u2019s a reference to a book by John Fowles.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Steve said slowly.\n\u201cThank you, Tony,\u201d Barnes informed him with a strained smile, setting the butterflies aside and reaching for his next present.\nWhat the fuck? Tony wondered.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Barnes cried.\nTony jumped, his hand knocking into his cup of coffee and sending it spilling across the table and ruining the sections of the newspaper Steve had set aside to read later.\nIt was the 29th of December, the day before the rest of the Avengers were supposed to return to the tower, and Tony was doing his damned best to condition himself to tolerate Steve\u2019s presence. He\u2019d been so hyper aware of Rogers, however, that he hadn\u2019t been paying any mind to the other Avengers in the kitchen with them.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Barnes continued to yell, throwing a book at the table with such force that it bounced off of the tabletop and into Tony\u2019s chest, making him fumble. \u201cWhy would you taunt me with something like that?!\u201d\nLooking down at the book, Tony saw that he was holding a newly purchased (and now coffee splattered) paperback version of The Collector.\n\u201cBucky, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cThat asshole gave me a reference to a story about kidnapping and psychological torture as a form of love for Christmas!\u201d\n\u201cStark!\u201d Wanda snapped.\n\u201cTony, why would you do something like that?\u201d Steve asked, giving Tony that same fucking look-\n\u201cSeriously!\u201d Barnes snapped. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?!\u201d\n\u201cMe?!\u201d Tony cried. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?! I wasn\u2019t taunting you! You said you liked it!\u201d\n\u201cI liked it? Liked what? Being tortured and brainwashed?\u201d\n\u201cThe Collector, you jerk!\u201d Tony snarled, throwing the book back at Barnes.\n\u201cWhy would you think I like something like this?!\u201d Barnes cried, brandishing the book as if it were something fowl.\n\u201cBecause you told me you liked it! You said you related to the main character, and you admired his ambition even if he was a complete idiot and\u2026 and\u2026 and you have no recollection of that, do you?\u201d Tony realized. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember stealing a copy of The Collector from Natasha\u2019s room and reading it in the common area. You don\u2019t remember talking about it and getting into an argument with me. Odin save us, I had an argument about inappropriate forms of love with the Winter Soldier and then got him a Christmas present to commemorate the argument.\u201d\nAround the kitchen table, the other Avengers looked horrified.\n\u201cLet me see if I have this straight,\u201d Lang said slowly. \u201cWhatever T\u2019Challa and his people did to deactivate the Winter Soldier\u2019s programming worked, we think. But the Winter Soldier isn't gone. He\u2019s still\u2026 in there with Bucky. And we only found out about it because Tony Stark gave Bucky a Christmas present which was actually meant for the Winter Soldier.\u201d\n\u201cAfter FRIDAY reviewed the tower\u2019s security footage of the last six months, she determined that the Winter Soldier becomes dominant at least three nights a week, and he wanders around the tower,\u201d Steve quietly explained, his brow furrowed and expression pinched.\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely broken into people\u2019s rooms on several occasions and watched them sleep,\u201d Tony announced.\n\u201cTony!\u201d Steve cried, and Barnes covered his face with his hands.\n\u201cWell?!\u201d Tony cried back.\n\u201cI am not okay with this,\u201d Lang immediately declared. \u201cHope is the only person allowed to watch me while I sleep. If she finds out someone else has been watching me while I sleep-\u201d\n\u201cHouse Rule 28,\u201d Steve snapped.\nWith a long sigh, Lang dutifully recited, \u201cWeird bedroom stuff stays in the bedroom and between the active participants. Seriously, Captain, if you think watching people while they sleep counts as weird bedroom stuff-\u201d\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be such a prude if he had to share a wall with Wanda and Vision,\u201d Clint groused.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Tony snapped. \u201cThis is Stark Tower, not some cheap, poorly built apartment complex! I know for a fact that Wanda and Vision could use jackhammers when engaging in foreplay-\u201d\n\u201cOh, ouch,\u201d Rhodey muttered as his expression twisted in distaste.\n\u201c-and no one would hear a damn thing!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the soundproofing that\u2019s the problem, Stark!\u201d Clint snapped back. \u201cWhen Vision gets worked up he doesn\u2019t always realize that he\u2019s phasing through the walls-\u201d\n\u201cHouse Rule 28! House Rule 28!\u201d Lang began to yell.\n\u201cNow that we\u2019ve established that there are far worse things than the Winter Soldier staring at us while we sleep,\u201d Natasha dryly intercepted, \u201ccan we determine if this is a problem?\u201d\n\u201cTony,\u201d Sam put in. \u201cYou said you had an actual conversation with him. How did he seem?\u201d\nTony shrugged. \u201cPretty messed up, but in a self-aware, basic-understanding-between-right-and-wrong kinda way.\u201d\n\u201cYou got that from a fifteen minute conversation in which you believed you were talking with Bucky Barnes?\u201d Natasha pressed.\n\u201cIt was a conversation about The Collector,\u201d Tony insisted.\n\u201cAh. That is\u2026 an interesting choice of reading material.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so, too,\u201d Tony sighed.\nTony was exhausted.\nEver since the team had found out the Winter Soldier was still a thing and that Tony was the only person who had spoken to him directly, the rest of the Avengers were constantly harassing him.\nActually, they were trying to talk with him to determine what this meant for the team's dynamic, their living arrangements, and their battle strategies.\nBut it sure felt like harassment.\n\u201cTony, this is serious,\u201d Steve ground out, interrupting Tony in the middle of his I-don\u2019t-have-time-for-your-shenanigans tirade. Which was somewhat understandable considering Tony's tirade had devolved into a why-aren\u2019t-my-employees-competent lamentation.\n\u201cI can tell that it\u2019s serious,\u201d Tony rejoined. \u201cDo you know how I can tell? It\u2019s because you\u2019re wearing your Game Face, Rogers.\u201d\nCalling it Rogers\u2019 Game Face wasn\u2019t completely accurate. Mostly because it wasn\u2019t only Steve\u2019s expression, it was his posture and body language as well. He stood squarely in front of Tony\u2019s work table with his feet evenly spread and firmly planted on the ground, his back straight and spine stiff, and his arms crossed over his chest. He was doing that thing where his chin was stubbornly jutting out which left him to look down his nose at where Tony was sitting at his work bench.\n\u201cThis is not my Game Face, Tony, because this is not a game!\u201d the man snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person the Winter Soldier has interacted with! You have a report with him! We need for you to approach him again and fully assess the situation so we can understand why he still exists and whether or not he could be controlled by Hydra!\u201d\nOn the screen in front of Tony, FRIDAY flashed a message which read Deep breaths.\nTony had to follow her command ten times over before he trusted himself to act in a way which wasn't born from panic. As soon as he was able, Tony slowly stood from his chair and stated, \u201cHe\u2019s been here for months, Steve. Months. And in that time, the Soldier has never left the tower or FRIDAY\u2019s supervision. He hasn\u2019t attempted to access any information on SHIELD or Stark Industries, he hasn\u2019t been recording information or sending messages to anyone outside the tower, and the only time he accesses any weapons is when he goes to the gym or shooting range. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t see a problem, and in this instance I\u2019m not going to go out of my way to create a problem. Barnes is your project, and I will not be held responsible for him. If you want to assess the situation, you can build a report of your own with the Winter Soldier.\u201d\nNow, Steve was using his Tony is Being Unreasonable glare, which was far more dangerous than the man\u2019s Game Face.\n\u201cYou have just as much cause to be weary of the Winter Soldier as anyone else in the tower,\u201d Steve pointed out.\nNow, FRIDAY\u2019s reminder of Deep breaths was flashing red.\n\u201cThen it sounds like you should try to talk about this with anyone else,\u201d Tony informed Steve.\nTony had gotten very, very good at coming up with excuses and extraneous work in order to avoid the Avengers. Every now and then, however, the excuses and extraneous work was not of Tony\u2019s creation, and there were legitimate work emergencies which arose.\nTony had been on the phone for 10 straight hours with the contractors in Chile. Hours one-through-eight had been Level 10, Red Alert, Full Crisis Mode. Hours nine and ten had been damage control.\n\u201cThe situation is stable,\u201d Tony assured several investors as he dug out some leftovers from the fridge in the communal kitchen and stuck the cartons of Chinese food in the microwave.\n\u201cWhy weren\u2019t we informed that the facility was being built in an area of the country prone to earthquakes?\u201d one of the men seethed.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Chile,\u201d Tony replied with a role of his eyes. \u201cThe entire country is prone to earthquakes. Which was taken into consideration during development and initial production. Seriously, guys, relax. The three people who were injured have already been treated and sent home, and there were no fatalities because the staff had training for this exact scenario, the facilities were designed to withstand earthquakes, and preventive measures were taken on day one of construction.\u201d\n\u201cAnd construction will continue as scheduled?\u201d the younger of the two men pressed.\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cIt was a magnitude 8 earthquake and there was massive damage! The Stark facilities are being used as an emergency shelter while the damage is being assessed in surrounding communities, and the construction equipment is being used to assist with rescue attempts. No, construction will not continue as scheduled, you asshole. Come on!\u201d\n\u201cIgnore Daniel, Mr. Stark,\u201d one of the other men instructed him with a long sigh. \u201cMy son is rather short-sighted when it comes to matters of long-term investment and gain. I\u2019m glad to hear that there was no major damage to the production facilities and that the community has a safe area to retreat to in times of danger.\u201d\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s Stark Industries for you - providing investors with more money at some point in the future and providing communities with stable jobs and safe work environments. Improving the world one earthquake resistant facility at a time,\u201d Tony chuckled.\nAfter ending the call, Tony dug into his appropriated food despite the fact that it hadn\u2019t been nuked long enough and there were mildly disgusting pockets of cold in the rice, all the while furiously texting on his cellphone. The food was almost gone when Clint wandered into the kitchen and began cursing at Tony.\n\u201cThat was mine, jerk!\u201d Clint declared when Tony blinked at him. \u201cWhat part of DO NOT TOUCH can\u2019t you read?!\u201d\nTony glanced at the carton he held, only just noticing that DO NOT TOUCH was indeed scrawled across the side of the carton. He also realized that it was a carton from the good Chinese place. The one that kept unpredictable hours and could only be accessed via quinjet.\n\u201cOops,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWant the last bite?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you inconsiderate ass-monkey! I don\u2019t know where your mouth has been! Seriously, Stark, would it kill you to get out of your own ego and pay one iota of attention and respect to other people?! Damn it!\u201d\nClint stormed from the kitchen, still cursing Tony\u2019s name, and his mother\u2019s, and that of Tony\u2019s bastard child which probably existed somewhere in the world.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to defend yourself?\u201d\nTony spun around to find Barnes sitting on the counter, his legs crossed and his back resting against the side of the refrigerator. Tony was sure the man hadn\u2019t been there a few moments before.\n\u201cNewton\u2019s shriveled balls!\u201d Tony exclaimed. \u201cHave you been there this entire time?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I was sitting on top of the refrigerator, before. Why doesn\u2019t anyone ever think to look up?\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t food or coffee on the ceiling,\u201d Tony explained.\nBarnes didn\u2019t seem concerned with where food was or wasn\u2019t located within the common kitchen. Instead, he said, \u201cHe just called you inconsiderate and disrespectful of other people. While you\u2019re dealing with a crisis which occurred on the other side of the planet and organizing rescue and aid.\u201d\n\u201cPeople get tetchy about food,\u201d Tony said with a shrug.\n\u201cFine. But I don\u2019t understand why you allowed him to treat you in such a way. After he called you an ass-monkey, why didn\u2019t you tell him to either shut up and leave you to your crisis management or inform him that food is only for those who earn it.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Let me guess. I am currently conversing with the Winter Soldier, right?\u201d Tony guessed.\nThe man\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cWas it not immediately obvious? I was of the understanding that my speech and behavioral patterns were significantly different from those of Sergeant Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cI bet they are, but I have officially had more conversations with you than with Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d the soldier slowly asked. \u201cOdd. I believed that you were unperturbed by your interaction with me because you had been exposed to Barnes for extended lengths of time.\u201d\n\u201cKinky. Kinky, but no. Does that mean you aren\u2019t aware of what he gets up to when he\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat?\u201d Tony questioned.\n\u201cI am not.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. The gang will be glad to hear that, I think. Steve will definitely be relieved to know that there isn\u2019t a voyeur critiquing his technique when he\u2019s making out with Barnes.\u201d\nThe soldier made a face at the idea of kissing Captain America, and Tony quietly chuckled.\n\u201cIf Barnes has nothing to do with your composure in my presence, then what is the reason? You can\u2019t have forgotten that I was responsible for the death of your parents.\u201d\nTony blinked. Because\u2026 those words, coming out of Bucky Barnes\u2019 mouth even if Barnes wasn\u2019t the one saying them\u2026\nWith a sharp inhale, Tony told the soldier, \u201cI have not forgotten, no. But you didn\u2019t have any choice in the mater. You were being controlled by Hydra.\u201d\nHis eyes narrowed at Tony, the soldier stated, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I was here. No one knew I was here. Not until you and I spoke, correct?\u201d At Tony\u2019s nod, he continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me you were avoiding. It was Barnes. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you may not have had a choice when it came to killing my parents, but Barnes has made plenty of his own choices. They all have.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d the soldier hummed.\n\u201cFRIDAY says you spoke with the Winter Soldier again,\u201d Steve said by way of greeting.\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a gossip,\u201d Tony wearily sighed.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was a private conversation.\u201d\n\u201cTony!\u201d Steve snapped, and Tony was glad he wasn\u2019t holding anything, or else he would have dropped it. \u201cWe need to know when things like this happen! We need to protect Bucky!\u201d\n\u201cYou need to protect Bucky,\u201d Tony snarled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, Steve! Bucky Barnes is not my responsibility!\u201d\n\u201cHow can I protect Bucky if you won\u2019t share the information you have on the Winter Soldier with the rest of the team?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\u201cTony, he\u2019s my friend,\u201d Steve argued.\n\u201cWell the Winter Soldier is my friend! So you look after yours, and I\u2019ll look after mine. There. Handled. Done. Now fuck off, Steve!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Stark?\u201d\nGlancing up from his tablet, Tony asked, \u201cProgramming an automatic response system for the quinjet?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing with Barnes?\u201d Lang asked with a roll of his eyes.\n\u201cNothing. I\u2019ve barely caught a glimpse of the guy from the corner of my eye since Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? You have conversations with him from the corner of your eye, too? Because word around the tower is that conversations are happening.\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes and returned to his tablet, adding a few lines of code as he told Scott, \u201cThere have been zero point two conversations with Barnes if you count Christmas. There have been two point zero conversations with the Winter Soldier.\u201d\n\u201cAnd two point zero conversations with the guy means that you\u2019re in his corner?\u201d Lang pressed.\n\u201cSomeone has to make camp there,\u201d Tony agreed.\n\u201cHank was right about you. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that when Captain America asked me to have his back at Leipzig/Halle, I totally agreed because Captain America. But after hearing the rest of the team talk about you while we were laid up in Wakanada, I thought 'Hey, maybe this one isn\u2019t just like the other.' Hank warned me that you\u2019d pull something like this, though. The Starks always have to have the biggest and shiniest weapons, don\u2019t thy?\u201d\nBy the end of Lang\u2019s rant, Tony was staring at him with raised eyebrows. \u201cOkay, you lost me there. I don\u2019t know who Hank is, I don\u2019t care about your pow-wow in Wakanda, and the Starks don\u2019t make weapons anymore. You didn\u2019t eat the green stuff in the fridge, did you? For fuck\u2019s sake, Lang, Vision made that stuff. Vision. House Rule 41.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t change the-\u201d\n\u201cHouse Rule 41, Lang!\u201d\nWith a heavy sigh, Scott dutifully recited, \u201cDon\u2019t eat anything made by Vision.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t eat anything made by Vision! He\u2019s technically related to DUM-E, Scott. They share some sort of binary code that only they can understand - like those secret languages that creepy twins sometimes speak with each other. And they share the same cooking skills, too. You\u2019re an adult - an adult human. You should know better than to eat strange substances in the refrigerator made by-\u201d\n\u201cJust forget it!\u201d Scott cried, throwing his hands in the air before turning on his heel and stomping away.\n\u201cNEVER forget House Rule 41!\u201d Tony yelled after him.\nIt was three in the morning, and Tony almost tripped over Barnes.\nBlinking down at the man sprawled across the floor just in front of the elevator, Tony asked, \u201cWhatcha doin, Soldier?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m attempting to gain comfort,\u201d he replied, his eyes remaining fixed on the ceiling overhead.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I used nothing but the finest and most expensive materials when building this tower, and I don\u2019t doubt that the concrete you\u2019re lying on is the most deliciously plush concrete you\u2019ve ever reclined against, but if it\u2019s comfort you want, you might consider relocating to the couch.\u201d\nHis lips twisting into a sneer, the soldier informed him, \u201cI am attempting to gain comfort by immersing myself in a familiar environment. You think Hydra let me kick my feet up on any of their couches?\u201d\nBlinking, Tony looked around.\nMost of the common area was decorated in beige (Pepper nixed the red). However, the elevator's lobby was nothing but white and the elevators doors were a shiny chrome. It occurred to Tony that if the soldier wasn\u2019t on missions for Hydra or stashed away in his cryo-tube, then he spent most of his time in labs and military bases. The concrete floor, the clinically white ceiling, and the chrome finish of the lobby was probably the closest thing to familiar the soldier could find without going and loitering in the med bay, and Tony totally understood why the soldier wouldn\u2019t want to hang out there.\n\u201cJoin me in my workshop?\u201d Tony offered. \u201cThere are concrete floors and white ceilings down there, and fewer people to step on you. Also, food. Rhodey brought me a couple of pizzas for dinner, and I\u2019m trying to watch my figure so I only ate one of them. You can have the others if you like.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of pizza?\u201d the soldier suspiciously asked.\n\u201cThe kind that doesn\u2019t have fruit, vegetables, or anything else which can be considered healthy.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d the soldier said, sitting up from his place on the floor. \u201cLead the way, then.\u201d\nIn Tony\u2019s workshop, the soldier forewent finding a bit of floor to lie on and made himself comfortable sitting on Tony\u2019s workbench, instead, straddling the seat and immediately helping himself to one of the pizzas conveniently located directly in front of him.\nTony left him to it, parking himself on the other end of the bench and resuming his soldering work.\n\u201cSo how\u2019s the workshop rank on the comfort scale?\u201d Tony asked almost an hour later after the soldier had eaten his fill, abandoned the workbench, and began looking around at Tony's workshop and the bots.\n\u201cTwelve-point-seven,\u201d the soldier instantly replied. \u201cYour workshop is eerily similar to the most advanced of Hydra\u2019s research facilities, but without the looming threat of invasive medical procedures or torture implements. Also, it\u2019s better lit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, lighting is key when establishing the difference between a safe workplace and a Hydra workplace,\u201d Tony idly agreed. \u201cHow do you like the rest of the tower?\u201d\n\u201cI want my own room,\u201d the soldier immediately stated. \u201cIt\u2019s getting difficult to hide things from Barnes and the Captain in the quarters I cohabitate with them.\u201d\n\u201cHide things? What is it you need to hide?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cThose lovely butterfly specimens. I found them at the bottom of a trash can several weeks ago along with\u00a0a copy of The Collector which I assume was meant as a holiday gift for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou did like it!\u201d Tony crowed. \u201cI knew you\u2019d appreciate my offbeat sense of humor!\u201d\n\u201cYour inappropriate sense of humor, you mean. But yes, I appreciated the gesture.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case, you can have one of the rooms in the penthouse. The room at the end of the hall is Pepper\u2019s, and the first door on the left is Rhodey\u2019s. Mine is the one with a door that looks like a vault entrance. The rest are up for grabs, though. Rhodey might give you a mean side-eye the first few times he sees you hanging around, but he won\u2019t go into your room and mess with your stuff when Barnes is in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d the soldier muttered, wandering over to the couch next to the bots and making himself comfortable in the seat as Tony began to tell the soldier the origin story of Tony-and-Rhodey\u2019s-Epic-Bromance.\nTony didn\u2019t stop talking until the morning, when FRIDAY sent him an alert stating that he had a meeting at 1:00 P.M., and he needed to sleep for a few hours if he didn\u2019t want to alarm the board members with his manic energy.\nWith a long sigh, Tony said, \u201cSorry soldier, but I\u2019m locking the place down - it\u2019s bedtime. The board doesn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m manic, and they whisper mean things behind my back about throwing me out of the company for real if they think I might attempt to take over the world while I\u2019m sleep-deprived. Did you want to go check out\u2026\u201d\nTony\u2019s words trailed away when he turned to the couch and discovered that Bucky Barnes now sat in his workshop, staring at him with an incredulous expression.\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s you,\u201d Tony said by way of greeting. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d\n\u201cFifteen minutes,\u201d Barnes replied. \u201cI have been here for fifteen minutes with no idea where I am or how I got here. Are we even in the tower right now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. This is my workshop,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cThe soldier likes shiny things, so he was chilling with me here. Come on, I\u2019ll drop you off at your floor.\u201d\nAt Tony\u2019s insistence, Barnes stood from the couch, allowed Tony to herd him into the elevator, and then mechanically stepped onto his own floor when the elevator arrived, still clearly thrown by the whole waking-up-in-a-strange-and-unfamiliar-place thing.\nRhodey watched with an incredulous expression as Tony set up the soldier\u2019s room, meaning that Tony found a room which wasn\u2019t occupied and threw a cellphone, a tablet, and a credit card on the bed, then declared his work done. If the soldier wanted to repaint or get a new bedspread, he could do it his own self.\n\u201cRodgers and Barnes have an entire suite,\u201d Rhodey pointed out as he followed Tony from the room and back towards the living area. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the soldier have one of the extra rooms in their place?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Rodgers would let himself in anytime he felt like it, rummage through the soldier\u2019s things, and then form opinions and judgments of the soldier without actually talking to him, and he\u2019d make decisions on the soldier\u2019s behalf. Barnes would probably trash the place in some attempt to pretend that the soldier\u00a0doesn't exist. As such, the soldier\u2019s safe place will be on our floor.\u201d\n\u201cBut our floor is our safe place,\u201d Rhodey argued.\n\u201cRelax, honeybun. Once you meet the soldier and get to know him, you\u2019ll\u00a0get along with him, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s one of those military types you like to fawn over and buddy up with.\u201d\n\u201cHe killed your parents, Tony.\u201d\nHis hands clenched into fists, Tony snapped, \u201cI know!\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you letting him into your home?! He\u2019s hardly even a person!\u201d\n\u201cOnly because he hasn\u2019t had the chance to be one yet!\u201d Tony replied. \u201cHe\u2019s only ever functioned as a machine before, Rhodey. The only difference between Vision and the Winter Soldier is that Vision didn\u2019t function as a weapon before gaining free will.\u201d\n\u201cAnd again, I reiterate, the Winter Soldier killed your parents!\u201d\n\u201cI know! And he knows! He\u2019s admitted to it!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe admitted to it,\u201d Tony said again. \u201cNo cop-outs, no lame excuses, no brushoffs. He didn\u2019t whine about how it wasn\u2019t his fault and he didn\u2019t have control of himself. He just\u2026 stated it as a fact. Honestly, Rhodey, I think the soldier is doing better at coming to terms with himself than Barnes is. He\u2019s doing better, and he hasn\u2019t had people tripping over themselves to help him or make things easier for him. He might hardly be a person, or whatever, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a monster, either.\u201d\nRhodey stared hard at Tony for a few long moments. Then, the man released a long breath, ran a tired hand over his eyes and said, \u201cFine. Fine. But if he watches me while I sleep or anything like that-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to only pull those stunts with the others,\u201d Tony resolutely promised.\n\u201cGet up.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my jet. It'll wait for me,\u201d Tony groaned, rolling onto his stomach and pressing his face into his pillow.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s watching the tower.\u201d\nBlearily looking around his darkened bedroom, Tony realized that it was the soldier standing over his bed, not Pepper.\n\u201cAre they watching the tower through a rifle scope? Are they holding a bazooka?\u201d Tony asked as he sat up with a sigh.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking pictures,\u201d the soldier growled.\n\u201cFRIDAY?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cFacial analysis indicates that the photographer is Devin Lobbins, an employee of Stark Industries. Specifically, Lobbins works jointly for SI\u2019s media division and advertising division.\u201d\n\u201cSo I pay the guy to make Stark Industries look good?\u201d Tony confirmed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Boss. It\u2019s likely that a photograph of the tower at night beneath a quarter moon will soon appear as a background on the company\u2019s website, considering that Lobbins has been tasked with providing a visual depiction of the tower\u2019s green energy at work.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other photographer?\u201d the soldier pressed.\n\u201cThat would me Marcia Johnston,\u201d FRIDAY informed him. \u201cShe\u2019s a freelance photographer who sells photographs of high-profile celebrities to gossip publications. She\u2019s been routinely scanning the tower\u2019s balconies every night for the past week.\u201d\n\u201cSee?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cFRIDAY has it handled. Maybe next time ask her before coming in here and waking me up in the middle of the - Hey! How did you get into my room?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat if the photographer wasn\u2019t an employee or a gossip rag photographer?\u201d the soldier replied. \u201cWhat if it was someone attempting to gain insight to the tower\u2019s schematics, the inhabitant's schedules, or-\u201d\n\u201cThe entire tower is covered in one-way glass,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cWe can see out but no one can see in. Also, my bedroom? It\u2019s essentially a safe room. I lock the door for the night and it becomes almost impossible to enter-\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re staring at me,\u201d the soldier argued. \u201cThe entire far wall of my room is a window. I can feel them looking at me.\u201d\n\u201cYou seriously need to start chatting with FRIDAY. She could have told you exactly who those people staring at you were, and then she could have blacked out your windows. Or she could have projected a view of the Caribbean over them. Or a view of a waterfall. Or a psychedelic light show. Hell, she could project a line of Bucky-Bears doing the can-can if you wanted. And then I would still be asleep and blissfully ignorant of the fact that my bedroom is not as secure as I thought it was, and I wouldn\u2019t have to spend the next week rebuilding the security protocol-\u201d\n\u201cThe security on your room is fine. FRIDAY let me in,\u201d the soldier snapped.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a mood,\u201d Tony realized. \u201cWhy are you in a mood? I\u2019m the one who was needlessly disturbed from my rest! Do you know how often I sleep?\u201d\n\u201cNot often enough,\u201d the soldier stated.\n\u201cExactly! Not often enough! Yet here I sit, growing increasingly alert by the moment, and you\u2019re the one in a mood! Why are you in a mood?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d the soldier snapped. \u201cI tried reading, and training, and I put in an hour at the shooting range! I rearranged the Black Widow\u2019s knives and set-up Vision to take the fall for it! I ate unhealthy food while watching bad television! Nothing is helping.\u201d\nBlinking, Tony said, \u201cHuh. It sounds to me like you need to destroy something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the soldier incredulously asked.\n\u201cIt sounds like destroying something is exactly what you need. Want to help me test some of the prototypes SI is working on? I don\u2019t build weapons anymore, but we still have contracts with the military for defensive products - armor, shields, heat-resistant materials, pressure resistant materials - let\u2019s go check out what the kiddies in R&amp;D have been up to and then we can go fuck up their stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWill I get to use a flamethrower?\u201d the soldier asked. \u201cMy handlers in Hydra never let me use flamethrowers.\u201d\n\u201cHeat-resistant materials it is!\u201d Tony cheered as he hurried to get out of bed.\nAfter quickly donning experimentation-appropriate clothing, Tony escorted the soldier down to the R&amp;D floors where they found a whole research unit dedicated to developing heat-resistant materials. They also ran into the single employee present on the floor in that late hour and discovered she was more than happy to abandon the work she was engrossed in to show the pair around.\n\u201c-and this is the polymer we\u2019re developing for firefighters,\u201d the overly eager, sleep-deprived woman explained to Tony. \u201cTechnically, we\u2019re developing the material for all sorts of things, but the NYC fire department has agreed to help us out with field testing. We\u2019re going to incorporate a calcium silicate base-\u201d\n\u201cAwesome. Melony, was it? Melony, I love how your mind works. My friend here couldn\u2019t care less about any of this, however. Think you could show us to the Blast Zone and set him up with some lights? Then, you and I can take a closer look at what you\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\u201cSure, Mr. Stark!\u201d the woman easily agreed. She quickly lead them into the lab and helped the soldier track down some protective gear which fit him.\nThe three of them remained in the Blast Zone for the rest of the night, Tony geeking out with his new buddy in R&amp;D as the soldier gleefully came up with new and creative ways of destroying all of Melony\u2019s hard work.\n\u201cThis is great,\u201d the woman gushed as Tony and the soldier were stepping into the elevator to return to the residential floors. \u201cDonnie\u2019s been talking about partnering on a project with one of his buddies at NASA - some of this data might give him an idea for close-contact materials to send a satellite towards the sun-\u201d\nThe woman started back to her work station, still talking to herself as she slumped into her desk chair.\nTony turned his gaze to the Winter Soldier and asked, \u201cFeel better?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d the soldier definitively replied as the elevator began to rise.\n\u201cTold you destroying stuff would help,\u201d Tony said with a grin. \u201cAnd see here? You were able to productively destroy stuff. Now we know the limits on all of those polymers my peeps have been working on.\u201d\nThe soldier hummed as he moved to lean against the elevator wall, flicking a knife from somewhere and using it to pick soot out from under his nails. He\u2019d probably need to shower three times over in order to wash all of the soot and ash out of his hair and skin. He may have gotten a bit over-enthusiastic when he was handed a flame thrower.\nTony grinned as he turned to face the doors again.\nThe soldier may not be showing how pleased he was with how the evening had gone, but Tony knew regardless.\n\u201cFRIDAY, is the soldier up top?\u201d Tony asked as he hurried into the penthouse.\n\u201cHe\u2019s resting in his room, Boss,\u201d the AI reported.\nHardly pausing, Tony asked, \u201cWhat do you think the likelihood is that he\u2019ll attack me when I burst into his room and wake him up?\u201d\n\u201cAnalyzing the soldier\u2019s previous response to sudden and unexpected stimuli\u2026 There\u2019s a 64% chance that he\u2019ll react violently but with mild force,\u201d FRIDAY informed him.\n\u201cWorth it,\u201d Tony decided just before bursting into the soldier\u2019s room.\nAs the door bounced off the wall and the lights came on, the soldier reacted within the 46th percentile as he abruptly sat upright in bed but didn\u2019t make any move to launch himself at Tony as he hurried into the room.\n\u201cUp and at um, soldier! I just finished the prototypes for SHIELD\u2019s new drones! Come on - FRIDAY says a lacky will be by to pick them up at noon. We only have five hours to take these puppies out for a spin. Come on, come on, come on.\u201d\nTony found a discarded shirt on the floor and threw it at the soldier before headed to the closet.\n\u201cDude, where do you get these things?\u201d Tony asked as he opened the door and found the closet stocked with guns and ammunition rather than clothes. \u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Slamming the door shut, Tony made his way to the dresser.\n\u201cWhat do you say, soldier?\u201d Tony asked as he opened one of the drawers and pulled out a hoodie and some gloves for the other man to wear. \u201cWant to go incognito and head to the park with me, or should we take R8? - no, the RS7. That one has tinted windows.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Barnes stuttered.\nTony froze.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d he realized. \u201cDamn. Don\u2019t tell Steve.\u201d\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Barnes asked.\n\u201cThe soldier\u2019s room in the penthouse,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cSpeaking of which - you are not authorized to be here. You aren\u2019t authorized to be here, and you have heard nothing about anything I\u2019m working on for SHIELD-\u201d\n\u201cOw, stop it!\u201d Barnes hissed as Tony began to pull him out of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m moving! Jeez - and I know about the drones, Stark. Natasha was talking about them last week-\u201d\n\u201cFine, but you don\u2019t know anything about any progress I may or may not have made with them, capice?\u201d\n\u201cWere you - were you going take the Winter Soldier out of the tower so that you could fuck around with SHIELD tech with him?\u201d Barnes hissed as Tony finally got him out of the soldier\u2019s room and into the hall.\nAs Tony continued to shove Barnes into the penthouse living area, Tony said, \u201cNo. Why on Earth would you think that? I swear to Odin, if you so much as even hint to Steve that I was going to do any such thing-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I\u2019m gonna tell Steve!\u201d Barnes snapped, firmly planting his feet on the ground and shoving Tony away from him. \u201cWhat part of any of that plan seems like a good idea to you? What if he hurt someone?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt anyone would get hurt,\u201d Tony said with a roll of his eyes. \u201cThe bombs I put in the drones are color bombs. The powder is non-allergenic, and it doesn\u2019t even stain clothing! It\u2019s less surprising than most of the stuff which people see on the streets of New York and only mildly disruptive-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the drones, Stark! I\u2019m talking about innocent people who might bump into him or set him off or piss him off-\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re confusing the Winter Soldier with the Hulk,\u201d Tony snorted. \u201cHe is capable of self control, you know, and I don\u2019t think he has an instant kill mode or anything-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. He probably doesn\u2019t,\u201d Barnes seethed. \u201cBut probably isn\u2019t good enough! Just\u2026 use your head! What happens if something sets him off?\u201d\nTony shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, the same thing that happened last time?\u201d\n\u201cLast - what last time?\u201d Barnes asked, his brow furrowing.\n\u201cLast time something set him off,\u201d Tony answered with a snide twist of his lips. \u201cWhich is to say that nothing happened. Well, not nothing. He came and woke me up in the middle of the night. Usually that would piss me off, because beauty sleep, you know? I need it from time-to-time. I wasn\u2019t too upset, though, because it was a good excuse to go down to the Blast Zone and science it up.\u201d\n\u201cBlast Zone?\u201d Barnes weakly repeated. \u201cScience?\u201d\n\u201cThe Blast Zone - Stark R&amp;D product testing facilities. The soldier operated the pyrotechnics, Melony and I took data. It was fun and productive. Unlike the outing we were supposed to go on this morning, which was only going to be fun and not productive in any way.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s interacting with other people now?\u201d Barnes asked, still frowning.\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Tony replied. Listing off his fingers, Tony told him, \u201cHe interacts with cab drivers and food industry employees whenever I send him to pick up take-out, he\u2019s on a first name basis with everyone in security and even joins them for poker nights every now and again, and he watches Animal Planet with Rhodey. You\u2019re gonna love this: One of their favorite shows is called Monsters Inside Me. Half of the episodes are about naturally occurring parasites which affect people\u2019s neurological functions.\u201d\n\u201cGood lord above,\u201d Barnes sighed, running a weary hand over his eyes.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony dryly agreed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s bad when the trigger-happy psychopath has more friends than you do.\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Barnes demanded.\nRolling his eyes, Tony went to the kitchen, hunting down a thermos and debating whether or not Rhodey might be amenable to terrorizing the good people of New York for a couple of hours. The two of them used to get into all sorts of trouble together before Rhodey had gone strait-laced when he started getting promoted in the military. Tony was sure that Rhodey would like to indulge once again, but at the same time, Rhodey was one of those pesky people who was mindful and considerate of others, and he preferred shenanigans which didn\u2019t directly interfere with people\u2019s daily lives. Maybe -\n\u201cYou gave him a room in the penthouse?\u201d Barnes asked.\n\u201cWhat? Yeah,\u201d Tony hummed as he considered the pros and cons of taking the drones to the park vs taking them to touristy places, instead. My grandmother got color bombed by a superhero while visiting Time Square and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Barnes asked. \u201cThere are plenty of rooms available on the Avenger\u2019s floor. There are rooms available in Steve\u2019s and my suite.\u201d\n\u201cThe dude doesn\u2019t want to live with a bunch of people who hate him -slash- are scared of him -slash- don\u2019t trust him -slash- who he doesn\u2019t trust not to fuck with his shit. He was pissed when he realized that the glass of the butterfly box I gave him for Christmas had cracked when you tossed it in the trash. I had to buy him four more before he quit bitching about it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2026 he goes outside? He goes outside and people don\u2019t recognize him?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they recognize him,\u201d Tony informed Barnes. \u201cHe gives them high-fives when they greet him as the Winter Soldier. When they address him as Bucky Barnes, he gives them this \u2018Aw, shucks\u2019 spiel which you would find absolutely humiliating. The guy\u2019s a fucking troll,\u201d Tony finished with a laugh.\nAt this, Barnes was quiet for several long moments. Then, he quietly asked, \u201cSo what exactly are you doing with those drones?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Barnes asked when he noticed that Tony was staring at him.\n\u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cFrom your time as the Winter Soldier?\u201d\nFrowning, Barnes shook his head. \u201cNot really. When I woke up in Wakanda, I remembered a few things from\u2026 the end of it. Running after escaping Hydra, mostly. Why?\u201d\nTony shrugged. \u201cWinter remembers all of it.\u201d\nHis face growing pale, Barnes asked, \u201cEven\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy parents?\u201d Tony finished with a dry smile. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nQuietly, his voice almost a whisper, Bucky asked, \u201cHave you tried saying the words to him?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it,\u201d Tony revealed. \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t think they would work. He doubts he would be capable of acting independently in any way if they still could. Winter's the weapon Hydra created, and whatever they did in Wakanda, it destroyed the user interface which made him a machine.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Barnes said, relaxing a bit. He turned back to the soggy cereal he was pushing around his bowl, and Tony turned back to the work he was doing on his tablet, sipping at his coffee and absently munching on the muffin he\u2019d grabbed for breakfast. Checking the time on his tablet, Tony decided he had twenty minutes before Vision would arrive in the communal kitchen, and then they could head out for the day.\nIt was only a few moments before Barnes suddenly asked, \u201cWhy are you telling me this? You\u2019ve hardly shared any information on the Winter Soldier since you started interacting with him.\u201d\nAgain, Tony shrugged. \u201cYou hardly ever ask.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Of course I do!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony slowly drawled. \u201cSteve backs me into a corner and demands I relinquish all information pertaining to the Winter Soldier every couple of weeks. It\u2019s none of Steve\u2019s business. You, however, share a body with the guy.\u201d\n\u201cSteve\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Barnes argued. \u201cHe\u2019s looking out for me. How isn\u2019t the Winter Soldier his business?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s not the Winter Soldier\u2019s friend,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou know why I asked you if you remembered your time with Hydra? It\u2019s because Winter doesn\u2019t remember any time before Hydra. He doesn\u2019t remember Brooklyn, growing up with Steve, the Howling Commandos, or anything about the war. The first time he met Steve Rogers was in DC. He doesn\u2019t know Steve, and he doesn\u2019t like Steve.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Barnes weakly replied, his eyes wide.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cOh.\u201d\nTony was having a bad week.\nWord of Wanda\u2019s mind-fuck of the Avengers in Sokovia had apparently gotten around the criminal underground, and the Avengers\u2019 last call to action had involved dreamscapes, and nightmares, and time-loop prisons. And ever since that nasty Tony Stark - Tell All had gone to press which included detailed information about his flashbacks, anxiety attacks, and hair-trigger reactions to certain stimuli, the baddies had decided that Tony was the Avenger of Choice when it came to testing the effectiveness of their brain-torture devices.\nRhodey and Vision had gotten Tony away from the battle and Lang had quickly figured out how to disable the device\u00a0 affecting Tony, so he\u2019d only been under for an hour or so.\nIn the time since, Tony hadn\u2019t been sleeping, he\u2019d started having regular anxiety attacks, and he was very, very jumpy.\nStaying over at Peter and May Parker\u2019s place for a couple of days had helped, but if he spent any more time away from SI or the Avengers, people would know just how severe the event had affected him, and Tony couldn\u2019t let this become people\u2019s primary method of attack against him.\nHe managed living in the tower for five days before he hit a snafu.\n\u201cSteve\u2019s looking for you,\u201d Wanda informed him as she passed through the communal kitchen. Tony paused in his task of rooting around one of the cabinets while looking for protein bars to stash in his workshop.\nWhen she was gone, Tony said, \u201cFRIDAY?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Rogers is currently on a call with King T\u2019Challa and several members of the Accords Committee, negotiating amendments to the chain of notification in the event of an emergency,\u201d she dutifully reported.\nTony rolled his eyes. \u201cEvery fucking inch,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cI estimate that Captain Rogers will be finished with his call in ten minutes,\u201d she finished.\n\u201cTakeoff in five,\u201d he commanded.\n\u201cSure thing, Boss,\u201d she chirped.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Barnes asked, causing Tony to jump and drop the boxes he had appropriated from the communal kitchen.\nFocusing on the other man, Tony watched as Barnes\u2019 expression of incredulity melted into one of concern.\n\u201cI\u2019m not - I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Barnes slowly said after a moment.\nBlinking, Tony realized what he was doing. His right hand was thrown up towards Barnes in what might be construed as the universal signal for Stop or Stay Back, but was held at an angle which much more strongly suggested I\u2019m going to repulsor you in the face.\nHis left hand had somehow found its way into one of the drawers holding utensils, and his fingers were gripped around a knife.\nForcefully exhaling, Tony dropped the knife on the countertop and pressed a hand against his sternum in an attempt to ground himself and calm his racing heart. \u201cWarn a guy, Barnes. Fuck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told Tony, hesitantly stepping into the kitchen. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Tony said with a shake of his head, moving to toss the knife back into the open drawer and firmly shut it. Then, he began fumbling with the number of boxes he\u2019d dropped all over the kitchen in his haste to move into a defensive stance.\n\u201cHere, let me help,\u201d Barnes insisted, stepping into the kitchen and navigating around the island to help pick up some protein bars which had fallen out of an already opened box.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d Tony snapped.\n\u201cActually, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY put in, \u201cIf you want to take off in four minutes, you do.\u201d\nTwitching, Tony snarled, \u201cFine.\u201d\nAfter grabbing the food, Barnes trailed after him as Tony rushed to the workshop, dumping the protein bars on the shop\u2019s couch and then hurrying to grab one of his suits and one of his tablets.\nIn the elevator, Tony told Barnes, \u201cThanks, bye,\u201d as the doors opened to let the other man off at the communal floor.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Barnes stated, his eyes narrowed at Tony.\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Tony succinctly replied.\n\u201cHell yes,\u201d Barnes insisted, his jaw locking into a stubborn set.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m fine. I just need a couple of days out of the city-\u201d\n\u201cYou are not fine,\u201d Barnes argued, \u201cand I\u2019m not letting you run off by yourself right now. Someone needs to have your back-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll invite Rhodey-\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s out of the country, Stark, and Vision's in the city with Wanda for the day. I\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d\nTony opened his mouth, fully intending to inform Barnes that if he didn\u2019t get out of the elevator, Tony would put on the suit and throw him out.\nBefore he could speak, however, the elevator doors closed and lurched into action, taking them up.\n\u201cFRIDAY, I swear to Odin-\u201d Tony hissed.\n\u201cThe quinjet\u2019s ready to go,\u201d FRIDAY replied, \u201cand one of the members of the Accords committee has been called away. Captain Rogers\u2019 meeting is going to end sooner than expected.\u201d\nWith an irritated sigh, Tony ran a rough hand over his eyes.\nMoments later, Tony and Barnes were seated in the jet and flying towards the compound in upstate New York. Barnes sat in the copilot\u2019s seat even though he didn\u2019t know a thing about operating any sort of aircraft.\nTony glared at Barnes, and he thought the look indicated that if Barnes said a single damn word, Tony would open the bay doors and shove the other man out of the jet.\n\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding Steve,\u201d Barnes immediately stated.\n\u201cI woke up on the wrong side of the bed and I\u2019m not in the mood to deal with other people\u2019s attitudes today,\u201d Tony shortly replied.\n\u201cSteve said the two of you had talked,\u201d Barnes insisted. \u201cHe said you\u2019d worked it out, and that you\u2019d forgiven each other.\u201d\n\u201cWell I had to tell him something to get him off my back,\u201d Tony seethed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve discovered that nothing works more efficiently than giving him exactly what he wants.\u201d\nHis shoulders falling and his brow furrowing, Barnes murmured, \u201cYou lied?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Tony replied.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Barnes pressed. \u201cIf you - if you haven\u2019t forgiven him, and if you\u2019re still uncomfortable around him, then why wouldn\u2019t you just tell him?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Rogers and I aren\u2019t people who tell each other things,\u201d Tony tightly replied.\n\u201cIf he knew he\u2019d try to fix it,\u201d Barnes pressed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Tony stated.\nThe compound wasn\u2019t much of a compound at the moment. After Wanda\u2019s abrupt departure during the Avengers\u2019 little dispute, Tony may have had a bit of a temper tantrum.\n\u201cThe way the others talked, I thought there would be a hole in the floor, or something,\u201d Barnes quietly said as the quinjet approached the property, his eyes wide as he studied the half-demolished compound.\n\u201cThere was a hole through several floors,\u201d Tony corrected.\n\u201cWas\u2026 was there an attack while we were in Wakanda?\u201d Barnes pressed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve become rather sensitive when it comes to people destroying my home. Usually when this happens, I retaliate by destroying the people who were responsible for the destruction to begin with. This time, since the people responsible for the destruction had fucked off to Wakanda, I retaliated by destroying their home instead. I\u2019m going to rebuild it and make it a clubhouse for the New Avengers. No residential suites included. Today is a\u2026 good time to get started on that particular project.\u201d\n\u201cIf you hate living with us so much, then why do you allow us to stay in the tower?\u201d Barnes quietly asked.\n\u201cYou know what they say - keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\u201d\n\u201cIf you really believed that, I would be the one with a room in the penthouse, and the Winter Soldier would be bunking with Steve.\u201d\nTony was surprised when he laughed. It had been a long, long time since someone other than Rhodey had made him laugh. It was difficult not to be a bit giddy, however, when he pictured Steve living with Winter. Let him see what it\u2019s like to feel threatened while sleeping in his own bed, Tony spitefully thought.\n\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Tony asked after he had banished a vivid daydream about the Winter Soldier booby-trapping Steve\u2019s suite. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of hype about living in penthouses, but the view from my floor isn\u2019t actually that different than the view from the communal floor.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the view. It\u2019s the coffee,\u201d Barnes replied. \u201cI may or may not sometimes wake up in the soldier\u2019s room and pretend to be him for a few minutes just so that I can smuggle a mug of the stuff downstairs.\u201d\nTony tsked. \u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI thought the guy\u2019s frequent appearances meant that he was just getting comfortable and taking control of the wheel more often.\u201d\nWhen Barnes remained silent, Tony\u2019s gaze turned to the man and he hurried to add, \u201cNot that you don\u2019t seem like a person who totally deserves to exist or whatever. It\u2019s just, Winter\u2019s my buddy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I get that,\u201d Barnes replied. \u201cOnly\u2026 I think he is taking control more often. I mean\u2026 at first he only ever wandered around at night every once in a while. I didn\u2019t - none of us - had any idea he was still around. Now, I miss entire days, I wake up in strange places, I never know where I\u2019ve been or what I\u2019ve been doing\u2026\u201d\nAfter a moment, Tony said, \u201cHuh. I can see why you might find that unsettling.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does Bucky get a prototype of SI\u2019s new StarkTech phone?\u201d Clint asked with a pout. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like Bucky.\u201d\n\u201cHouse Rule 17,\u201d Natasha called.\nNarrowing his eyes at the woman, Tony recited, \u201cIf one Avenger gets a toy, all Avengers get a toy.\u201d\n\u201cFork \u2018um over, Stark,\u201d Natasha demanded with a pointed grin.\nWith a grin of his own, Tony told her, \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem with your logic, princess.\u201d\n\u201cThe Bucky isn\u2019t an Avenger argument doesn\u2019t work anymore!\u201d Scott called from the kitchen. \u201cThe UN granted him full membership a month ago!\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBut Winter hasn\u2019t been granted membership, and he\u2019s not an Avenger. Bucky\u2019s phone may have the prototype\u2019s extended battery life and superior casing, but Bucky doesn\u2019t have access to all the bells and whistles. Technically, Bucky\u2019s using something which more closely resembles a Motorola from 2005 than the latest and greatest StarkTech. So if you\u2019d like some antique Motorolas, go dig some out of the landfill and I'll spruce them up for you.\u201d\nLeaning over the back of the couch to look at the phone in question at work, Clint scoffed. \u201cThis sure as hell doesn\u2019t look like outdated tech.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because Bucky uses the outdated tech,\u201d Tony replied, vindictive amusement filling his chest. \u201cWinter gets the fun stuff.\u201d\nTo drive home the point, Winter\u2019s metal arm shot up, he grabbed a fistful of Clint\u2019s shirt, and he used his grip to fling Clint over his shoulder, across the living room, and into the couch on the other side of the coffee table. Clint landed face first in the cushions with an indignant yelp.\n\u201cHouse Rule Three,\u201d the soldier intoned. \u201cDo not invade an assassin's personal space.\u201d\nNatasha was standing in an instant. Clint was scrambling over the couch to take cover behind it. Scott ran into the living area, instead of away from it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re him!\u201d Lang cried, pointing accusingly. \u201cHow long have you been here?!\u201d\n\u201cLong enough to judge you for your knowledge of children\u2019s television,\u201d Winter informed him, his eyes very judgmental indeed as his gaze met Lang\u2019s for a moment.\n\u201cHey, I have a nine-year-old daughter,\u201d Lang defensively declared.\n\u201cHave you ever actually lived with her or spent enough time with her to watch cartoons?\u201d Winter asked.\n\u201cLow blow, buddy,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cOther than poor impulse control, Scott\u2019s not actually a bad guy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Lang agreed. \u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Tony continued, nudging the soldier with his elbow. \u201cYou watch cartoons all the time.\u201d\n\u201cThe Justice League is of a different calibre than the Wonder Pets,\u201d Winter pointed out.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Tony chuckled as he looked over at Scott, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your daughter has outgrown the Wonder Pets.\u201d\nWith a frown, Lang told him, \u201cThe Wonder Pets is what Cassie watched when I did live with her.\u201d\n\u201cAww,\u201d Tony said, legitimately feeling sorry now. \u201cWinter, let Scott use your phone to facetime with his daughter.\u201d\nScott responded with a\u00a0roll of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not using the tiny little screen on that phone when I can facetime my daughter on the television in my room. Also, it\u2019s Thursday. She\u2019s in school.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is going to lay a single finger on this device. Not for anything,\u201d Winter promised as he sifted through apps. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that Barnes even has access to this.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Scott said, moving further into the sitting area as he eyed the soldier. \u201cIf you use the same phone, then your phones should have the same features.\u201d\n\u201cBarnes and Winter have different pass codes,\u201d Tony explained.\nWinter snorted. \u201cSomeone needs to teach Barnes about digital security. Using a four digit code is one thing. Using the year of his birth as the code is something else entirely.\u201d\n\u201cI told you not to hack his settings,\u201d Tony sighed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly considered hacking if I was granted access while using the first number which came to mind.\u201d\n\u201cIf you messed with anything, change it back,\u201d Tony demanded.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the soldier hummed. \u201cHe can change it back himself - it will be a good lesson for him in navigating modern technology.\u201d\nScott shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But this is so weird right now. One of the nicest guys I know is being an ass. To himself. Just. What?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not Bucky Barnes,\u201d Winter declared as he stood from his place on the couch, slipping his new phone into a pocket of his jeans.\n\u201cWhere ya going, Frosty?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cBlast Zone,\u201d Winter replied. Nodding to the opposite end of the living area where a door was swinging shut, he said, \u201cWidow and Hawk are running to tattle. I\u2019m getting out of here before Captain America shows up and tries to appeal to my sense of friendship or brotherhood or some shit in an attempt to put his bestie back in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\u201cWait for me,\u201d Tony demanded as he hurried to gather the R&amp;D schematics he\u2019d been reviewing that morning. As soon as Tony indicated that he wanted away from the common area before Rogers arrived, Winter started helping him gather the blueprints.\n\u201cHey, what about me?!\u201d Lang hurried to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s not even 10:00am yet - it is way too early in the day to be subjected to an interrogation from Captain America. Or worse - Steve\u2019s expression of betrayal when he finds out I let you two run off!\u201d\nTony met the soldier\u2019s eyes. After a moment, Winter gave an almost imperceptible shrug, so Tony said, \u201cWhat the hell. Come on down - I\u2019ll give you a tour of the labs while Winter blows things up in the name of progress.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, deja vu,\u201d Tony said by way of announcing himself as he took a seat in one of the recliners sitting catty corner from the couch Barnes was occupying.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Barnes asked.\n\u201cThis right here? This is the exact situation which occurred when I first met the Winter Soldier. Therefore, I will say to you what I said to him... Seriously?\u201d\nWith a wry smile, Barnes told him, \u201cIf this is a repeated conversation, it should probably be repeated with the Winter Soldier. It\u2019s his book.\u201d\nHis eyebrow raising, Tony asked, \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cI think he may have fallen asleep while reading last night - I woke up with the book on my face this morning.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tony said, far less interested than he was a moment ago. Watching Winter's reaction to discovering that Bucky Barnes had stolen a book out the the soldier\u2019s room would have been very entertaining.\n\u201cYeah. I thought I\u2019d take a look at it - he\u2019s clearly read it before. It's all marked up and there are whole sections which are highlighted. Although personally, I don\u2019t see the appeal. The movie was way more entertaining.\u201d\nWith a roll of his eyes, Tony said, \u201cOf course the movie was entertaining. The movie was about a monster. There were fight scenes and attacks from mobs and all sorts of drama. The movie wouldn\u2019t have been very popular if it was about some guys who sat around and talked a bunch before quietly dying.\u201d\n\u201cThe book\u2019s about a monster, too,\u201d Barnes pointed out. \u201cIt's a horrible creature, and the thing kills people.\u201d\nTony blinked at the other man and then glanced down at the well-worn book and the place he had marked with his finger. \u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten to the creature\u2019s narrative yet, have you?\u201d\nHis brow furrowing, Barnes asked, \u201cThe creature\u2019s narrative? How could it have a narrative? It can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\u201cI reiterate - they had to do something to make the movie interesting,\u201d Tony scoffed. \u201cThe creature in the book was highly intelligent. He mastered language and taught himself to read in a matter of months.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 makes it worse,\u201d Barnes repplied as he sat up and dropped the book onto the couch beside him. \u201cIf it was intelligent, that means it killed Victor\u2019s brother on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cBecause he didn't know that he had any other way to express his anger. The doctor created this great horrible being and then abruptly abandoned him without any explanation or offering him any assistance. The first thing the creature learned of life was that people feared him. When he first saw his own reflection, he feared himself. He was alone, he was angry, and he was scared. Every person he came into contact with violently rejected him. When that\u2019s all he knew of life, why would he go up to Victor or his brother and offer a handshake, a well-aged scotch, and some pleasant conversation?\u201d\nBarnes was frowning. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\nWith a sigh, Tony stood. \u201cIn that book, the creature\u2019s not the monster, Barnes. Frankenstein is the monster. No one ever remembers that, though, because the creature was the ugly one. Just\u2026 keep reading.\u201d\nBarnes still seemed unsettled - and he would be until he finished reading, Tony was sure. He gave the man\u2019s shoulder a sympathetic pat as he made his way to the elevator with plans to watch television in his own rooms.\nIf anyone asked, Tony could truthful tell them that yes, he had spent time on the common floor that day.\nTony didn\u2019t drink often.\nNot anymore.\nPepper had gone to Chicago to negotiate a merger (takeover, whatever). Rhodey was at the compound in upstate New York for a meeting with Hope van Dyne to discuss establishing a new chain of command and base of operations for the team. Vision promised to keep out of the penthouse for the evening.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d Winter asked when he emerged from his room after a long day spent assisting SI security in establishing emergency protocols for the tower\u2019s employees. Winter poured two fingers of scotch for himself as he asked the question.\n\u201cAnniversary,\u201d Tony simply replied.\n\u201cAh,\u201d the man hummed. \u201cThis is a tradition of yours, then?\u201d\nTony hummed, remaining otherwise silent as Winter slumped into the cushions next to him, leaving the bottle on the coffee table in front of them and within easy reach.\nTony didn\u2019t like it when people bothered him on this day - he never had. Ever since the death of his parents, Tony had claimed this day for himself. It was the only day which really belonged to him. No SI, no work, none of his friends, and nothing public. It was the one day of the year when he didn\u2019t have to pretend. Not in any way or for anyone.\nBeside him, the soldier remained quiet, finishing his drink and then pouring himself a second.\nTony did the same, although technically the drink he poured was his fourth.\nA long time passed, and Tony was halfway through his fifth drink before he spoke.\n\u201cTechnically, this is a reverse tradition,\u201d he stated. \u201cFor most of my life, this was the only day of the year when I didn\u2019t consume a single drop of alcohol, even though it was the day I wanted it most. Through good or bad, I would never drink on this day of the year.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nWith a bitter smile, Tony replied, \u201cBecause during all that time, I thought that this was the anniversary of the day when my father\u2019s drinking got him and my mother killed. You know what\u2019s really fucked up? I knew there had been a cover-up. I knew that people were lying when they told me how my parents died. But I thought I knew what they were lying about. I mean, my parents were a big deal - SI was a big deal. It would have been really, really bad for a lot of people if it got out that my parents had been killed because my father was driving drunk.\u201d\nNext to him, the soldier made a strange noise deep in his throat. Tony took a long, shaky breath, then gulped back another sip of his drink.\n\u201cI blamed him,\u201d he weakly admitted. \u201cFor thirty years, I blamed my father for taking my mother away from me. For abandoning me and leaving me alone. Do you know what that\u2019s like? To be overwhelmed with rage and contempt every time you think of one of the people who you love and admire most in the world? For fuck\u2019s sake, the first time I went to rehab, I spent three months trying to figure out what was wrong with me that I still valued his opinions and wanted to be someone he would be proud of. I warred with myself for years because logically, I wanted to be nothing like him, and yet I found myself striving to imitate him. All of that\u2026 all of the time and energy I spent hating him, all of the time I spent hating myself\u2026 And it was for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cJesus. Stark, I\u2019m sorry. I am so, so, sorry.\u201d\nBlearily, Tony blinked and looked to the man who sat on the couch beside him. \u201cBarnes?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the other man repeated.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Tony asked as he tilted his head back against the cushions, slouching further into the seat, the alcohol and his exhaustion finally, finally catching up to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything. Hey - hey, where\u2019s Winter? I want to talk to Winter. I like that guy - he doesn\u2019t get all weepy during emotions, and he doesn\u2019t apologize for shit he can\u2019t change.\u201d\nExhaling sharply, Barnes slammed the tumbler he held onto the coffee table, snarling, \u201cFuck. Fuck, Stark, what has happened to you? What happened that you\u2019re more eager to interact with a murder, the man who killed your parents, than with people who are good?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as good,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cGood is nothing more than a faulty concept which people have created in an attempt to establish order and structure in a chaotic universe. Good is something people pretend to be in order to manipulate others and convince them that some beings are superior to others. Winter\u2019s smarter than to fall for that bullshit, though. He knows - he understands. There\u2019s no such thing as good.\u201d\nSighing, Barnes muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony agreed with a sigh of his own.\n\u201cSeriously, why do you like the Winter Soldier so damn much?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously? I just told you,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the only people I know who doesn\u2019t lie to my face about who and what he is.\u201d\nAt this, Barnes gave a groan, except his sharp exhalation didn\u2019t sound like resignation, but irritation.\nHowever, that irritation didn't transfer to Barnes' movements as he gently removed the tumbler from Tony\u2019s hand and told him, \u201cCome on, Tony. Let\u2019s get you into bed.\u201d\nTony was turning 45, and this was apparently a Big Deal.\nHe was perfectly aware that he was one of the older Avengers, thank you. He didn\u2019t think people needed to get worked up until he had half a century under his belt, though.\nWhen he said as much to the others after they declared they would be throwing a party for him, Clint responded by saying, \u201cIt will be a miracle if you live to fifty.\u201d\nLater, when they bumped into each other on the elevator, Natasha asked, \u201cSince when do you dislike people celebrating you?\u201d\n\u201cSince my parties started resulting in massive amounts of destruction,\u201d Tony easily answered. \u201cOnce is an anomaly, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern, you know.\u201d\nTicking off her fingers, Natasha recited, \u201cYour 41st birthday party, and the post-destruction-of-Hydra celebration. When was the third?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I wasn\u2019t counting those,\u201d Tony hummed. \u201cBy my calculations, I should have stopped throwing parties when I was sixteen. Better late than never, though, so-\u201d\nRolling her eyes, Natasha told him, \u201cDon\u2019t get sensitive about your age now, Tony. You\u2019ve had your allotment of midlife crisis. The team hasn\u2019t had a good get-together in weeks, and they want to do something nice for you. Even if you don\u2019t go to feed your own ego, do it for them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s my party, I should get to spend it alone if I want to, Tony pouted.\nWhen the day of his birthday came around, Tony was delighted to find that Pepper had taken the initiative of inviting people other than his superhero-coworkers to the celebration.\nWanda made noise about allowing non-Avengers into the Avenger floors, but Happy shut her down as he sauntered out of the elevator and declared, \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with Tony Stark\u2019s explosive behavior longer than you\u2019ve been alive, kid, and being an Avenger has nothing to do with it. Get it, Tony? Explosive? Because of what happened during your 25th birthday?\u201d\n\u201cThere were plenty of lifeboats and the rescue workers posed with us for pictures. It wasn\u2019t that explosive,\u201d Tony said with a grin as he moved to greet his friend. Going in for a hug, Tony quietly told him, \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Boss,\u201d Happy replied with a bright grin.\nAround noon, May Parker turned up with a bunch of teenagers in tow.\nVision found Peter\u2019s friend Ned to be fascinating, and Michelle quickly determined that the optimistic and sunny Scott Lang was easy pickings in terms of disturbing someone with her unsettling behavior. The other members of Peter\u2019s robotics club (which Tony was officially sponsoring) quickly took to harassing the rest of the Avengers.\n\u201cMJ and Olivia made the vegan cake, Ned and Joey\u2019s parents helped them with the gluten free cake, and Peter insisted that we make you an ice-cream cake,\u201d May told Tony as Peter easily carried the three cakes which looked to be precariously balanced in his arms to the kitchen. \u201cWhere do we put presents?\u201d\n\u201cPresents go next to the throne!\u201d Darcy Lewis proudly declared as she and Jane Foster arrived.\n\u201cThrone?\u201d Tony asked, immediately coming to attention. \u201cAs in\u2026 an Iron Throne?\u201d\n\u201cDamnit, Lewis,\u201d Rhodey sighed. \u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise!\u201d\n\u201cOops!\u201d Darcy unapologetically chirped. \u201cHello highly attractive middle-aged woman. Are you Tony\u2019s new booty-\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my aunt!\u201d Peter cried as he hurried back from the kitchen.\n\u201cYour aunt\u2019s hot,\u201d Darcy replied.\nWith a long sigh, Jane said, \u201cTony, you don\u2019t get to sit in the throne or even see it until it\u2019s time to unwrap your gifts. Darcy, give me the presents.\u201d To May, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you where to stash your stuff.\u201d\nWhen Stephen Strange wandered into the party wearing casual slacks and a cape, Tony blinked at the man.\n\u201cLong time no see,\u201d he greeted as he shook Strange\u2019s hand, frowning and looking down when the man\u2019s hands didn\u2019t feel\u2026 right, in his.\nWith a somewhat sad smile, the man responded to Tony's glance at his heavily scarred hands by asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t this where you welcome me into the club?\u201d\nWith wide eyes, Tony asked, \u201cNo shit?\u201d\n\u201cNone,\u201d his old friend (seriously old, as in Tony hadn\u2019t seen Stephen Strange at any hoity-toity fundraisers in years) responded. Then, Strange pulled him into a hug. \u201cVision called me,\u201d he quietly told Tony. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s nice to come out on the other side of things and see a familiar face.\u201d\nSwallowing hard, Tony quietly agreed, \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d\nOnce they had pulled away from the embrace, Tony had a smile firmly stretched across his lips as he declared, \u201cWelcome to the club, then! Come on, I\u2019ll show you around and introduce you to the other Mouseketeers. If you want to stick around after your meet and greet, there will be three varieties of cake, and I can take you to the penthouse to choose a room.\u201d\n\u201cPenthouse,\u201d Stephen slowly repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve hung out in one of those.\u201d\nTony\u2019s favorite visitor arrived just before Vision declared that it was time to open presents.\nHarley Keener came into the penthouse looking frustrated and harried. \u201cBig cities suck,\u201d he told Tony in greeting. \u201cI refuse to ever ride the subway again!\u201d\nTony was determined to change the kid's mind, so Tony pulled him into a fierce hug in a show of exactly how welcome he was. Tony ended up sneezing when the hug meant that his nose wound up in Harley\u2019s hair.\n\u201cJeez, you've gotten big,\u201d Tony declared. \u201cI see the puberty fairy has come to visit.\u201d\nHarley rolled his eyes. \u201cYou should have seen the video they made us watch in health class. There were no diagrams or pictures. Instead, Captain America told us about our changing bodies.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, we had to watch that, too!\u201d one of the girls from Midtown High\u2019s robotics club loudly declared. \u201cHey, you know that guy\u2019s here, right? MJ has been asking him really awkward questions about her menstrual cycle for the past half hour - want to come and watch?\u201d\nHarley blinked at Tony, and Tony grinned. \u201cGo on, kid. Throw in some questions about how\u00a0uncomfortable it is to wake up after certain types of dreams. We\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d\nAs the girl pulled Harley away, the boy said, \u201cDon\u2019t think for a moment I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, Stark. I don\u2019t care how many like-minded friends I could make here, I\u2019m not moving to New York!\u201d\n\u201cSay that again at the end of the night and I might actually believe you!\u201d Tony called after his retreating form.\nThe throne was ridiculous.\nFirst of all, it seemed to be a regular chair with a bunch of cardboard attached to it.\nSecond, it was covered in glitter.\n\u201cNot one word,\u201d May quietly warned him, her tone dangerous even as she kept a wide smile on her face. \u201cThey tried to make you a real Iron Throne in shop class, and they were almost expelled for building weapons at school. They spent hours on that piece of junk. I\u2019m going to have to hire professional cleaners for my apartment - did you know they sell glitter by the gallon? Because I didn\u2019t know they sold glitter by the gallon.\u201d\n\u201cOMG, that is amazing!\u201d Tony loudly declared.\nAnd honestly? It kind of was amazing. The throne was a bit lopsided - there were way more glitter-swords on the left side of the throne than the right - and Tony was covered in annoying little flecks of gold the moment he came within a foot of the thing. It was clearly worthless and wouldn\u2019t hold up for longer than it took Tony to unwrap his presents, but no one had ever done something like this for him before.\nHe\u2019d had a throne at his 30th birthday party, and the thing had been deliciously gaudy. It had been ordered, though. The most effort anyone had put into its design was deciding that the cushions should be blue - complete strangers took care of the rest.\nTony\u2019s Iron Throne was ridiculous, but he loved it regardless. He loved it so much that he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to react in any way when someone muttered, \u201cI\u2019m surprised Stark didn\u2019t just buy the prop from the television studio.\u201d\nPeople rarely bought Tony gifts. What does someone buy for the man who has everything, after all? The answer: watches, apparently. Not a single gift-giving occasion passed where Tony didn\u2019t receive at least five watches. This year, when the Avengers announced they were throwing Tony a party, he firmly told them he didn\u2019t want gifts, because he knew he would end up with a bunch of watches.\nThe people who knew Tony didn\u2019t listen to his demands.\nVision bought him bacon. As in, Vision went to the kitchen, took a gift-wrapped package of bacon out of the fridge, handed it to Tony so Tony could read the card and pull apart the wrapping paper, and then Vision deposited the bacon in the penthouse refrigerator.\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Harley murmured as he watched Vision float through the ceiling.\nTony laughed when he opened his gift from Harley - a scented candle that smelled like motor oil.\nLike watches, Tony had plenty of ties. However, he didn\u2019t have any ties which were covered in little cartoon pineapples. He also didn\u2019t have any tie-dyed ties. He also didn\u2019t have any ties which pictured a collage of horrifying clowns.\n\u201cThank you?\u201d Tony asked MJ as he nervously eyed the final tie.\n\u201cIf you wear it around your neck, you\u2019ll be the only person who doesn\u2019t have to look at,\u201d MJ reminded him.\n\u201cIf I wear it around my neck, someone with magic might-\u201d\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Rhodey cried. \u201cDon\u2019t say it, Tony! Jeez, most of us already suffer from nightmares, and none of those nightmares require the addition of magic clowns!\u201d\nBefore Tony could open his mouth and expound on the magic clowns idea, Lang wisely distracted Tony with another gift.\n\u201cFrom Cassie,\u201d he informed Tony as he dropped an envelope into Tony\u2019s lap, right on top of the horrible ties.\nThe envelope contained a well-drawn picture of Iron Man and Tony Stark holding hands while a birthday cake with candles floated in between them. The accompanying letter essentially said \u201cthanks for saving the world and stuff and for keeping my dad out of jail. You should put fur on your suit.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Tony said as he read through the letter again. \u201cAwesome. I definitely know what she\u2019s getting for her birthday.\u201d\nThe next gift, surprisingly, was from Bucky.\nTony\u2019s eyes flickered over to the man, who only responded by giving him a small smile and a raised eyebrow. \u201cWhatcha waiting for?\u201d he challenged.\nRipping into the suspiciously thick envelope, Tony blinked down at the post-it notes which were revealed, the packet rumpled and with \u201cCoupon Book\u201d sloppily written on the topmost post-it.\n\u201cUm, what?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cFRIDAY says that you\u2019re supposed to give someone who\u2019s rich something they can\u2019t buy for themselves,\u201d Barnes told him with another grin. \u201cMost of the coupon books I found online were for things like breakfast-in-bed and hugs, but I think they were also made by children, so\u2026\u201d\nRipping off the top post-it, Tony couldn\u2019t help the delighted laughter which bubbled up in his chest.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it\u2019s for?\u201d Peter curiously asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coupon for a Fake Emergency,\u201d Tony declared as he began to flip through the post-its. \u201cGood for one boring HR presentation. And - ha! There\u2019s a coupon for a minor but highly distracting confrontation with insistent journalists! And a Break Out of Jail (read: Hospital) Free card. And\u2026\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes widened at the various notes which said things like, \u201cGet Steve Out of the Room\u201d or \u201cDistract the Avengers While Tony Makes a Get-Away\u201d or \u201cPublicly and Loudly Take Tony\u2019s Side in an Argument\u201d or \u201cTake the Blame for a Misunderstanding.\u201d\n\u201cI told you he would have liked getting personal coupons!\u201d Ned loudly declared as he pouted at Peter.\nClearing his throat, Tony set the post-its aside and loudly said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what you came up with instead, Neddo!\u201d\nThe distraction worked - for a few minutes. Tony unwrapped a number of pleasant, thoughtful gifts before Vision handed him a present and informed him, \u201cThe card says it\u2019s from the Winter Soldier.\u201d\nTony ignored the strange noises which several people made at this announcement as he unwrapped the gift.\n\u201cIs that\u2026 another coupon book?\u201d Rhodey asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 They\u2019re pictures\u2026 I think\u2026 Winter may have given me blackmail material for my birthday.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s blackmailing you?\u201d Natasha sharply questioned.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said, a grin spreading across his face. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d\nStrange, of course, gave Tony a watch.\nTony was far more appreciative of this watch than any other he had ever received, however, when Strange told him, \u201cThe watch face will begin to glow a pale blue - a similar color to your reactor technology, I believe, whenever you are in the vicinity of magic.\u201d\n\u201cNice,\u201d Tony declared as he instantly strapped the watch to his wrist.\nAt the end of the night, when he was alone in his room, Tony spread the incriminating photographs of the other Avengers, his political adversaries, and no-do-gooders who harassed him from time to time across his bed. After he pulled apart the post-it note coupons he had received and scattered them, as well, Tony began to organize his perfect day, in which when a situation went pear-shaped, he would be able to ensure that he was not responsible for taking the fall or straightening everything out.\nTony decided that this had been his best birthday ever.\nIt was 2:30 in the morning when Tony wandered into the communal kitchen to commandeer some leftovers from the fridge for his post creating-binge refuel. Slogging into the living area with his stolen goods, Tony collapsed on one of the couches and began to mechanically transfer food from the styrofoam carton to his mouth.\nIt took him several moments to realize he wasn\u2019t alone.\n\u201cWhatcha up to, Barnes?\u201d he blearily asked the other man, who was slouched in one of the recliners and angrily punching buttons on his cell phone.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to reset my phone settings,\u201d the man irritably grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my pass code five times - I\u2019ve even started using a seven digit code, but the Winter Soldier keeps working around it and messing with my settings.\u201d\n\u201cThe guy can be a real jerk sometimes,\u201d Tony told him with a lazy smile.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d Barnes muttered.\nTony thought about turning on the TV and ignoring Barnes\u2019 pathetic attempts to master outdated technology, but Tony was tired. In his current state, he found that staring at the blank, black television screen was just as entertaining as anything which might be showing at this time of the night (morning, whatever), and the insistent sound of gentle clicking from Barnes\u2019 phone was actually kind of soothing.\nTony\u2019s food was almost finished when the elevator pinged down the hall, and then Wilson, Natasha, and Rhodey were stumbling into the common area.\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m getting old,\u201d Wilson complained as he slouched into the seat next to Tony, the man smelling of sweat and alcohol. \u201cI thought that joining the Avengers would up my game.\u201d\n\u201cNo amount of superpowers can compensate for your lame dance moves,\u201d Rhodey quipped. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t have any problems.\u201d Grinning, Rhodey pulled several torn bits of napkin from his shirt pocket, proudly displaying the numbers he had gotten that evening.\n\u201cTwo of those numbers belong to government spies,\u201d Natasha informed him as she shed the ridiculously tall heels she was wearing and adjusted her short skirt.\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Rhodey agreed as he stuck the numbers back into his pockets. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to go around dating a civilian, am I? Besides, spies can defect. They do it all the time.\u201d\n\u201cAim for the stars, Care Bear,\u201d Tony said around a mouthful of food.\n\u201cNatasha\u2019s happy to date a civilian,\u201d Wilson grumbled. \u201cShe got more numbers than everyone else in the club combined.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Natasha,\u201d Rhodey argued. \u201cNatasha doesn\u2019t date. And Natasha was the one who taught me not to date civilians.\u201d\n\u201cMy code name is Black Widow,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI specialize in one night stands and booty calls.\u201d\n\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Wilson deadpanned.\n\u201cYou should have come with us, Bucky,\u201d Natasha said as she finished pouring drinks at the bar and handed out the nightcaps to Rhodey and Wilson. \u201cSteve says you used to be a real lady killer and you were such a good wingman that you were able to get him dates even before the serum. Wilson could have used you at his side.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve done any good,\u201d Barnes replied without looking away from his phone. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a sexuality crisis or something.\u201d\n\u201cUm, what?\u201d Wilson asked.\n\u201cI think I might be bi? I don\u2019t know. Thinking about guys wasn\u2019t exactly allowed where - when - I come from, and I certainly enjoy women, so it was never a problem. But now it is allowed, and even though I would have been perfectly happy continuing with my heterosexual lifestyle, the soldier\u2019s been metaphorically shoving dicks down my throat. And possibly literally. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Rhodey incredulously asked.\n\u201cWinter's hooking up with one of Tony\u2019s employees - a guy in security,\u201d Barnes explained, his eyes still on his phone as he pressed at the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve woken up naked in the guy\u2019s bed often enough that breakfast with him has stopped being awkward.\u201d\n\u201cWow, okay,\u201d Wilson said with wide eyes. \u201cThat seems\u2026 really inappropriate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Rhodey politely coughed while he worked out the terminology he wanted to use, \u201cmetaphorically?\u201d\nBarnes flashed them - literally - his phone. The home screen showed a very lewd picture of two very naked men doing very interesting things to each other. \u201cEvery time I set my background to an appropriate picture, he changes is back to something more explicit and then makes it more difficult to fix. I find that I\u2019m less upset about the pictures themselves than my inability to work the phone's settings, and Robert is a very kind, handsome, and physically affectionate man, so yeah. Sexuality crisis.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve had a busy week,\u201d Tony said with a yawn as he carelessly deposited his now empty carton of leftovers on the coffee table. Standing up with a stretch, Tony said, \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to remember most of this in the morning, or I\u2019ll think it was a particularly interesting waking dream or something. So if you want me to have a conversation with Winter about respecting the boundaries of the guy he shares a body with or something, leave a note on the refrigerator.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing. Thanks, Tony,\u201d Barnes said as he returned to his attempts at straightening out his phone settings.\nAs Tony made his way to the elevator, he could hear Natasha, Rhodey, and Wilson debating the merits of adding sexual harassment awareness training to the Avengers\u2019 orientation manuals.\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to hire a small force of lawyers and psychologists just to deal with the \u2018two people sharing the same body\u2019 aspect,\u201d Wilson was pointing out. \u201cIs that really prudent when there\u2019s only one person suffering from this predicament?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one person now,\u201d Natasha stated. \u201cIf working with the Avengers has taught me anything, it\u2019s that if something happens once, it\u2019s entirely possible that it will happen again. It will happen again, and it will be far more severe and far more dangerous. It would be nice to have a solid framework on hand if something like this were to-\u201d\nWhen the elevator doors closed behind him, Tony sighed. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing, Winter?\u201d he wondered.\nUsually, when it was Winter who woke up in the penthouse, the man would stumble from his room and into the bathroom, shirtless and with the jeans he slept in unbuttoned. Tony wasn\u2019t sure what the man did for ten minutes in the bathroom, because it certainly had nothing to do with straightening up. When he emerged from the bathroom, Winter made his way to the kitchen and did nothing to hide his metal arm, the warped and discolored skin around his shoulder, or the scars littering his chest and back. He also didn't do anything to tame his bedhead, and he didn't button his jeans. Instead, he poured himself a cup of coffee and began doing what Tony like to call the \u201cperimeter check\u201d of the penthouse, going around and inspecting the floor\u2019s security features, taking stock of who was or wasn\u2019t present in their rooms, and then eyeing the various buildings neighboring the tower as he finished his first cup.\nOn this morning, Winter went into the bathroom then immediately came back out, marching to where Tony was lounging on the couch and trolling some tech sites. His face twisted in affront and rage, he loudly asked, \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d\nBlinking as the man turned around and to show his back, Tony let out a bark of laughter. Quickly, he sat up and snapped a picture.\n\u201cI said what the hell is-\u201d\n\u201cIt looks like Bucky Barnes is getting his sweet, sweet revenge,\u201d Tony cackled. \u201cI think something from that sexual harassment and consent seminar might have struck a chord with him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Winter snarled once again.\n\u201cAccording to Google, it\u2019s a Palos Verdes Blue,\u201d Tony informed him, glancing from the picture on his phone to the tattoo on Winter\u2019s back. \u201cWow, look at the detail on that thing. Barnes must have done a lot of research to find someone to do such fine work-\u201d\nAbruptly turning around to face Tony, Winter snarled, \u201cThis is excessive retaliation. Just because I set a few dick pics as his user interface doesn\u2019t mean he has any right to give me a tattoo.\u201d\n\u201cBuddy, I don\u2019t think this is about the dick pics. I think this is about how you\u2019ve been getting down and dirty with your guy Robert.\u201d\n\u201cRob and I had the \u2018just friends, no more benefits\u2019\u00a0conversation weeks ago,\u201d Winter said with a deep frown. \u201cNo. This is about the home screen. It\u2019s not my fault that son-of-a-bitch can\u2019t work a remote control.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what? Winter, have you been fucking with more than Bucky's cellphone?\u201d\n\u201cThis is too much,\u201d Winter snarled, his eyes narrowed and his his lips twisted in fury.\n\u201cAs far as tramp stamps go, it\u2019s not bad. A butterfly is a little cliche, but at least it\u2019s a tasteful butterfly. It\u2019s a good size, beautifully done, and the color suits you. I mean, he could have gotten an arrow and the words \u2018insert here,' but instead he gave you some real art. Honestly, Winter? You should take this for what it is - a cry for help.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d the man flatly replied.\n\u201cYou share a body with the guy,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cHe may not have been aware of that at the beginning, but he\u2019s had enough time to get used to the idea. You should probably think about establishing some line of communication with him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d Winter intoned after a moment, his eyes carefully assessing Tony.\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m the only person who really interacts with both of you, and I\u2019ve never been complemented for my skills as a mediator or an interpreter,\u201d Tony pointed out as he settled back into his seat. \u201cYou two should probably figure out how to talk to each other without involving a bunch of other people or resorting to passive aggressive body modification.\u201d\n\u201cStop making this sound reasonable,\u201d the soldier commanded.\nAbruptly sitting up on the couch, Tony pointed an angry, accusing finger at the man. \u201cThere! You see?! I\u2019m having to act like a rational, reasonable adult right now, Winter. I should never, at any point in time, be the rational or reasonable member of any group of people!\u201d\n\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d the soldier groaned.\n\u201cWhen Pepper finds out, you are going to be in so much trouble,\u201d Tony insisted.\n\u201cIf you drank the last of the coffee, I\u2019m locking you out of your workshop for a week,\u201d Winter declared as he made an about turn and started back towards the bathroom.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the clearance,\u201d Tony argued.\n\u201cYou may have Potts on your side, but FRIDAY likes me the most!\u201d the man called before slamming the bathroom door behind him.\n\u201cShe does not!\u201d Tony yelled back. Then, after a moment\u2019s pause, he muttered, \u201cCrap.\u201d\nPutting his phone aside, Tony stood and made his way to the kitchen in order to start a fresh pot.\nIt wasn\u2019t personal.\nThe attack was focused on a military base near the Pentagon. That was personal, certainly. FRIDAY had managed to track down the info on the man responsible for that day's attack. The perpetrator was former military, dishonorably discharged, and had gone on to build himself a techno doomsday cult. Going for that particular military base was personal. For him.\nThe use of technology and parts scavenged from Ultron\u2019s Iron Legion meant that the Avengers had to be called in to stop the madman, his people, and their tech. That part wasn\u2019t personal. Not really. But the military, the government, and the press was making it seem like it was personal.\nOnce again, it was Tony Stark\u2019s fault. It was his fault even though he had never met the man responsible for the attack, Tony never had any contact with him or his people, and Tony had been barred from entering Sokovia in order to properly dispose of the Iron Legion\u2019s scrap. Also, the scrap in question had been so drastically altered and reworked that it had taken Tony a while to even realize that Iron Legion scrap was what some of the weapons were made from.\nWanda was giving Tony the same side-eye that she\u2019d given him before she and the others had fucked off to Wakanda. Clint wouldn\u2019t look at him at all. Steve was valiantly attempting to hide his frustration and disappointment. The one time Tony caught Steve's eye, the man was wearing an expression which indicated that he was asking himself why he had ever trusted Tony in the first place.\nAs the Avengers stood just beyond the stage and out of view of the press, still battered from the fight and waiting for the government representative to call them out to report (to answer for themselves), Tony took a look around himself and at his team.\nIt was Leipzig/Halle all over again, only worse, because this time they were supposed to be on the same side - a team.\nRhodey stood firmly at Tony\u2019s back, glowering at the curtain which separated them from the press conference and the audibly angry mutterings which were already drifting from the crowd. Vision was attempting to comfort Wanda with a supportive hand on her shoulder, but he was also conveniently standing in a way which ensured that his body blocked Tony from her direct line of sight.\nScott was biting his lip, his eyes darting from Tony to the other Avengers, the man tense and poised as if he was afraid he\u2019d be asked to choose sides again.\nSam was huddled with Natasha and Steve, the three of them speaking in low voices.\nHis jaw set, Tony said, \u201cYou know what? Fuck you. The lot of you can go to hell.\u201d\nSteve had the gall to blink at him with big, blue, surprised eyes. \u201cTony, what-\u201d\n\u201cStraight to the fiery, burning pits of a hell which I don\u2019t actually believe exists but I sure as shit wish did just so that you could all go there and rot,\u201d Tony snarled as he began to assemble his armor in order to go home. \u201cI am not taking the blame for this one.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Lang said, holding up his hands. \u201cNo one blames you for anything-\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. Three years ago, I was one of the dozens of people responsible for the creation of a homicidal robot. But does anyone talk about Hydra? No. Does anyone talk about Bruce? No. Does anyone talk about the fact that I\u2019m forced to house the woman who fucked with my head and helped to destroy not only her home, but eventually my home as well? No. I\u2019m the only one who ever gets the blame, even though I didn\u2019t do it alone. Even though I didn\u2019t do it under my own power or by my own choice. Even though I was the only person to apologize or try to fix anything, to make it better, or to clean up the mess. So why is it that three years later, I\u2019m still taking the fall for bullshit that I had only a small part of? Why does the \u2018I had no choice\u2019 argument pertain to Bucky Barnes, but not me? Why am I the person who has to go out and stand in front of all those people and apologize for the horrible things that happened today but which I had no knowledge of or part in? Why does this get to be my fault?\u201d\nHer expression twisted, Wanda snapped, \u201cYour Iron Legion was used in the attack today-\u201d\n\u201cMy Iron Legion was destroyed when a robot controlled by an alien energy device which you put in my hand tore through my home!\u201d Tony roared at her. \u201cThe Iron Legion used in the attack today was Ultron\u2019s Iron Legion! The Iron Legion he created in Sokovia! With your help! With your help after you agreed to enter into an alliance with him! The Iron Legion I tried to go back for and clean up after! Today didn\u2019t happen because of me! It happened because the people of Sokovia wouldn\u2019t let me into their country and they did a shit job of cleaning up and disposing of a bunch of weapons! Today happened because of Ultron! And if we\u2019re not putting blame on the guys who were actually responsible for the attack, then today happened because of you!\u201d\n\u201cTony, enough!\u201d Steve snapped.\nTony was glad he was wearing the armor, otherwise his resulting flinch would have been visible to the others.\n\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t susceptible to control from the scepter,\u201d Clint reminded him with a bitter frown. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work when Loki attempted to use it against you.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work because of the arc reactor, you idiot,\u201d Tony replied with a bitter sneer of his own. \u201cThe reactor intercepted and absorbed the scepter's energy. And guess what I had removed months before we went to Sokovia?\u201d\n\u201cHow convenient,\u201d Wilson muttered.\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s not convenient?\u201d Tony snarled at the man. \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient when things go wrong. It\u2019s not convenient when bad things happen. It\u2019s not convenient when the people you\u2019re supposed to rely on and trust abandon you to pick up the pieces and put them all back together. But you wouldn\u2019t know about that, would you? You were conveniently ensconced in Wakanda, sipping mojitos and sunbathing while I dealt with the shitstorm you lot left behind. Well guess what? Bucky, I\u2019m calling in my coupons.\u201d\nBarnes gave a put upon sigh from where he stood at the edge of the group, thus far staying out of the argument.\n\u201cFigured as much,\u201d he muttered as he moved forward and watched as Tony popped one of the compartments of his suit open and grabbed what he had taken to calling his Rainy-Day Stash of coupons and incriminating pictures. Barnes easily accepted the hand-off and scowled as he leafed through the jumble of post-it\u2019s and pictures. Mumbling to himself, Barnes said, \u201cThe Winter Soldier was aware that bits of Ultron's former army were being smuggled out of Sokovia, of course. My memories of it are foggy, and after the deprogramming in Wakanda, I didn\u2019t have the technical know-how to understand what it was I had seen. I thought Mr. Stark\u2019s Iron Man armor seemed familiar when I started working with the Avengers. I should have spoken up-\u201d\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve breathed, his complexion going pale. \u201cWhat are you-?\u201d\n\u201cTurns out it\u2019s real, real easy to make someone out as the bad guy,\u201d Barnes told Steve with a bemused grin. \u201cTony\u2019s not takin\u2019 the fall today. I am.\u201d\n\u201cBucky, you didn\u2019t have anything to do with what happened here!\u201d Steve insisted.\n\u201cI had more to do with it than Stark did,\u201d Bucky dryly replied. \u201cSteve, I had to make money somehow while I was on the run. I really did witness materials being smuggled out of Sokovia.\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t you,\u201d Steve said again.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t Stark neither. But he\u2019s right - someone\u2019s gotta take the fall, and the people out there aren\u2019t talking about the guys who actually attacked a military base today. They\u2019re talking about us. Tony - fly safe. I\u2019ll see ya back at the tower.\u201d\nTony\u2019s faceplate snapped shut and he saluted Barnes before starting away from the conference.\nHe was halfway back to the tower before he realized that he didn\u2019t feel overwhelming rage any longer. Now, he felt kinda sorta guilty.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Tony sighed.\nThe team meeting was mandatory, of course. Vision was sent to collect (escort) Tony and everything. Tony felt like he was being marched to his execution as they entered the communal floor and found the rest of the team waiting in solemn silence.\nOnce Tony was seated at one of the couches with Vision and Rhodey on either side of him, Tony was surprised when it was Lang who raised his hand and started speaking first.\n\u201cCan I just say that it is super awkward that I fought with you guys at Leipzig/Halle and then lived with a bunch of you for a year and never heard about any of the baggage that you lot are carrying around until yesterday?\u201d\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t involve you,\u201d Natasha stated.\nBefore an argument could break out already, Steve loudly interjected and said, \u201cTony, we didn\u2019t realize that you didn\u2019t like Wanda.\u201d\n\u201cI like Wanda fine. Liking her doesn\u2019t change the fact that I don\u2019t trust her, though,\u201d Tony replied, and he was self-aware enough to admit that he took some pleasure from the visible cringe which this statement wrangled out of Wanda.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Steve said with a tired, disappointed sigh. \u201cRight, so we\u2019ve talked about it, and we think that until we figure out what the problem is and how to fix it, Wanda and Vision should probably go stay at the compound for a while.\u201d\n\u201cNo can do,\u201d Tony informed the man. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you at the compound anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wilson asked. \u201cBut\u2026 The compound is our home. Rhodey said we\u2019d be able to head upstate again as soon as the new training facilities were complete.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony slowly replied. \u201cSo\u2026 I may have done a bit of remodeling while you were all fucked off to Wakanda.\u201d\n\u201cRemodeling?\u201d Natasha slowly repeated, over-stressing each of the word's syllables.\n\u201cRemodeling, partaking in therapeutic mass destruction, po-tay-toe, po-tah-toe. Either way, the compound\u00a0will henceforth be nothing but training facilities, and the only long-term sleeping quarters are located in the med-bay. I mean, you\u2019re welcome to go and set up camp in the Crash Quarters, but it\u2019s four to a room and you\u2019ll have to keep all of your stuff in lockers, so\u2026 It might just be easier and more comfortable to hang out at the tower.\u201d\nWith an aggravated sigh, Steve said, \u201cTony, why didn\u2019t you talk to us about this?\u201d\n\u201cYou fucked off to Wakanda after leaving me for dead in a frozen waste, Rogers. What was I supposed to do, call you up on that prehistoric trinket you sent me and talk about which walls I was going to leave intact? Or is this about my executive decision to make the sleeping quarters at the compound temporary sleeping quarters? Yeah, no. Next time you lot bulldoze my home, I\u2019d like to be sure that you\u2019re not bulldozing the only home of a whole bunch of other people, as well.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to talk about these things,\u201d Steve insisted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my money, I\u2019ll decide how to spend it,\u201d Tony stated. \u201cWhat more talking do we need to do?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what your behavior is doing to the team,\u201d Steve quietly and very carefully told him. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you about this for\u2026 for a while, really, but\u2026 The way you treat us sometimes\u2026 and these executive decisions\u2026 It makes us feel uncomfortable going to you about anything and sometimes\u2026 Sometimes people don\u2019t want to include you.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tony stated. \u201cThat means the next time you decide to go on some stupid crusade with guns ablazing, I\u2019ll be able to use plausible deniability to keep from being taken down in the crossfire.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what Steve is talking about and you know it,\u201d Natasha told him with narrowed eyes. \u201cStop misunderstanding everything and twisting people\u2019s words on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Tony snapped. \u201cYou want me to use small words? I can\u2019t stand to look at any of you most days. I don\u2019t like you and I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust you or like you either,\u201d Clint snapped back. \u201cAfter what you put Bucky through yesterday? Not on your life.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, yeah. That,\u201d Lang put in. \u201cWhy would you do that to someone?\u201d\nAt this, Tony sighed and leaned back in his seat. Because he was not proud of how he had handled himself the day before. His actions had been petty and vindictive and cruel. \u201cYeah, that was a shitty thing to do. I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have agreed to it if I couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d Barnes loudly declared from his place in one of the recliners.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault!\u201d Steve hotly insisted, seeming more lively than he had during any of the conversation thus far.\n\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t Tony\u2019s, either!\u201d Barnes argued. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t going to stop any of you from letting him get run roughshod, though! You know what, I\u2019m with Tony on this one. He doesn\u2019t have any reason to like you, and he doesn\u2019t have any reason to trust you! You talk a big game about teamwork and loyalty and trust, Steve Rogers, but none of you have ever behaved as if Tony was your teammate.\u201d\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Rhodey crowed. \u201cThat is exactly what I\u2019ve been saying! All of you treat Tony like the money-backer who was given honorary membership out of obligation or something!\u201d\n\u201cTony has taken hits for everyone - all of us. But who takes hits for him?\u201d Vision quietly asked.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I put Barnes out there like that - it wasn\u2019t fair and it was a shitty thing to do. Because it should have been Steve or Wanda or the Widow who I threw under the bus. Because you know what? Barnes is working to make up for his past mistakes, which none of you have ever done. You beat me down and shit all over everything I work for and I\u2019m left to clean up the mess, but you always come out on the other side smelling like roses. Barnes and Rhodey are right. I\u2019m not a part of your team. I\u2019m your scapegoat, and I\u2019m not, I repeat, I am not letting you\u00a0treat me like that anymore. We clear on that? Good, awesome. Great team meeting, guys. Super productive.\u201d\nTony stood from his seat and quickly made his way towards the elevator. Neither Rhodey nor Vision attempted to hold him back. As the doors closed behind him, Tony could here Barnes say, \u201cSit down, Stievie. Going after him right now won\u2019t help anything. Let him cool off and-\u201d\n\"Oh please, Barnes,\" Natasha interrupted. \"At which point in that conversation were\u00a0you helping anythin-\"\nAs the elevator moved to deliver him to his workshop, Tony had to admit that the entire confrontation had left him a bit off-kilter. He had just aired a lot of grievances and years worth of turmoil and resentment.\nAlso, the \u201cPublicly and Loudly Take Tony\u2019s Side in an Argument\u201d coupon hadn\u2019t been included in the packet he\u2019d handed off to Barnes the day before.\nWhen Tony suggested that Winter and Bucky should try communicating directly with one another, he probably should have been more specific about what methods they used.\nBy the time Tony realized what was going on, it was too late - the notebooks and journals he bought and placed in Winter\u2019s room went untouched, and the email account he set up for Bucky was primarily used to send people pictures of animals while Winter used his email to send people invitations to join pyramid schemes (Winter was turning into a real smooth talker - Tony had needed to reread the email invite three times before he realized why the business proposition Winter was suggesting sounded too good to be true).\n\u201cSacrilege,\u201d Tony accused while he sulked in the penthouse living area and watched Stephen Strange and Vision as they placed bookshelves along the far wall of the space. The shelves were nice, at least - Strange had found the antiques in an Asian market he liked to frequent.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Stephen murmured as he used a bit of magic to resize the bookshelves so that they expanded to take up all of the available space against the wall. \u201cThe tablet you gave me is amazing - and thank you for setting up an account which automatically buys and downloads the New York Times bestseller list. However, the tomes I study aren\u2019t available in electronic form, and I would feel more secure if there were copies of them here at the tower in case anything happened to the Sanctum\u2026 again.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bitch at Strange, Tony,\u201d Rhodey demanded from his place lounging on one of the couches. \u201cIt\u2019s Winter who\u2019s buying up bookstores. And let me tell you, at the beginning of all this, I would have been far less nervous about letting him into our space if I\u2019d known that he would spend so much time sitting around reading children\u2019s books.\u201d\n\u201cThe Harry Potter books may have initially been advertised and sold as children\u2019s stories, but as the series progresses the underlying themes and principles of the story become far darker and-\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, Viz,\u201d Rhodey demanded. \u201cWe\u2019ve already gotten you tickets for the Universal vacation package, and none of us have any right to judge considering the fact that we\u2019ll be right there with you wearing robes and waving around fake wands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I would like to take this moment to say that yes, I find it highly amusing that my books on the mystic arts will be housed on the same shelves as the Harry Potter series,\u201d Stephen put in.\nWhen Tony groaned in annoyance (because seriously, the shelves could have gone into Stephen\u2019s room if the shelves in Winter\u2019s room weren\u2019t already full to bursting), Rhodey told him, \u201cIf it bothers you that much, why don\u2019t you talk to Winter about donating books to libraries when he\u2019s finished reading them? Or better yet, set him up with a tablet and an Amazon account like the one you gave Stephen?\u201d\n\u201cHe has a tablet and an Amazon account, and he can\u2019t donate the books when he's finished because he doesn\u2019t just read them, you know.\u201d\nTo demonstrate, Tony grabbed the fifth Harry Potter book from the stack which was about to topple off the coffee table and he opened it to a random page. He held it out to Rhodey so the man could see the writing which filled the margins of the book's pages.\n\u201cApparently, the Winter Soldier and Bucky Barnes find that discussing literature is one of the only ways they can communicate without resorting to name calling and insulting each other\u2019s mothers,\u201d Tony informed him.\nAs Vision wandered over to take a look at the book, he said, \u201cThat seems rather counter-productive considering the fact that both men were in fact born from the same woman.\u201d\n\u201cWinter has no knowledge or memory of her, though, and Barnes makes real mean \u2018Your Mama\u2019 jokes about Hydra,\u201d Tony dryly replied.\nReading over some of the notes in the margin of the book, Rhodey made a strange noise in the back of his throat. \u201cIs this seriously four pages of Bucky Barnes and the Winter Soldier debating how best to kill Dolores Umbridge? In detail?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone forgets that Barnes was infamous for his sniper skills during the war, and he was very, very good at killing people even before Hydra started experimenting on him with super soldier serums,\u201d Tony reminded the man. \u201cAnd now do you see why we can\u2019t donate any of this crap? At best, the conversations written out in those books would be highly incriminating if anyone got their hands on them. At worst, unsavory characters would be able to actually use the ideas and information which the two of them write out as blueprints for crimes of their own.\u201d\nPicking up another one of the books sitting around the living area, The Count of Monte Cristo\u00a0this time, Vision murmured, \u201cTheir handwriting is different.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cIsn\u2019t Winter\u2019s cursive pretty?\u201d\n\u201cTheir situation gets more confusing by the day,\u201d Rhodey complained with a sigh.\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Tony argued. \u201cNot if you remember that they are and always have been two different people.\u201d\n\u201cI know that Steve can be a persistent asshole,\u201d Bucky informed Tony. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this guy since we were children. You think he was bad after he found out the Winter Soldier was still active and had access to the world through my eyes? Well now Steve's even worse, and I\u2019m the one he's going after. Please, Stark. The knucklehead cares about you. He really does. I\u2019m not asking you to forgive him. I\u2019m not asking you to like him. I\u2019m just asking for you to talk to him and make him understand where you stand.\u201d\nWith an incredulous frown, Tony set aside his soldering iron and gave Bucky his full attention as he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re really taking his side on this? Now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking anybody\u2019s side,\u201d Bucky argued. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re my friend and I want to support you. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be there for the conversation. You and Steve have some shit to work out, and neither of you are exactly easy to talk to, so I\u2019m going to act as your translator.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Tony scoffed.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Barnes insisted. \u201cLord knows I\u2019ll have a better chance of it than any of the other clowns we live with. And I promise I won\u2019t let him cut you down. Just like I won\u2019t let you cut him down. Please, Tony. Everyone has been on edge for weeks and the tension is making me suffocate. If you\u2019re not going to do this for yourself, do it for me.\u201d\n\u201cWow. You\u2019re really counting on this whole 'us being friends' thing to work out for you, huh?\u201d Tony asked.\nWith a wry smile, Barnes told him, \u201cI\u2019m actually counting on your sympathetic sense of camaraderie to work out for me. Remember how Steve used to corner you and press for information on the Winter Soldier? He\u2019s doing that to me now, about you. Help me get him off my back?\u201d\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Tony said with a long sigh. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\nThe agreement was kind of worth it simply for Barnes\u2019 resulting smile of relief. Tony totally understood; Steve was relentless when tackling a problem, and being on the opposite side of his Game Face was never pleasant. For anyone, apparently.\nThe rest of the team cleared out of the common room for them - Bucky nixed the idea of the three of them meeting in his and Steve\u2019s quarters. Bucky said they needed to meet on neutral ground. He also denied them the option of going someplace out of the tower where there would be food. He said there would probably be yelling, and while the public and press were fully aware of the divide which existed amongst the Avengers, they didn\u2019t need any evidence of just how bad it was.\u00a0\nAs soon as they were gathered and sitting, Steve turned his sad, earnest eyes to Tony and said, \u201cLook. I think-\u201d\n\u201cPut a sock in it, Stievie,\u201d Bucky immediately demanded. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly aware that Tony always has to have the last word, but just this once I think he should have the first word as well. Tony, go ahead.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be a team again,\u201d Tony immediately stated, his tone insistent and resolute. \u201cI don\u2019t care how sorry you are, and it doesn\u2019t matter what you do to try and make it better. It\u2019s not going to happen, dead stop.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s answering sigh was a sound of pure aggravation. \u201cI know I made a mistake, Tony. I lost my temper is Siberia and I hurt you. I know that.\u201d\n\u201cSiberia wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Tony informed him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re using doublespeak, Tony,\u201d Bucky put in. \u201cPlease use small words and give straightforward explanations for those of us who didn\u2019t grow up in an environment where a single sentence could have a dozen different meanings.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Tony said. Sitting up strait, squaring his shoulders, and raising his chin, he looked Steve in the eye and said, \u201cYou never trusted me, Rogers. Not from the very beginning. You questioned my every thought, move, and decision even while we were fighting an invading alien army, and you never stopped questioning me after. Yet you demanded blind obedience from me. We were supposed to be a team, but you made damn sure that there was never any doubt of who exactly was in charge.\u201d\n\u201cOnly because you would never work with the rest of us!\u201d Steve argued. \u201cTrust goes both ways! We tried to involve you in the team and you resisted every moment of it!\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn't the team I had a problem with - it was the team's insistence on working for SHEILD that I had a problem with! I thought I made my opinion of SHIELD clear from day one,\u201d Tony instantly replied. \u201cI told you that I would have nothing to do with a shadow organization, but you instantly and eagerly drank the Kool-Aid, and look how that turned out!\u201d\n\u201cHow was I supposed to know that they\u2019d been infiltrated by Hydra? How could I have possibly known-\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even about Hydra! Did you do any research on the organization before you signed on and started taking orders? Did you have any idea what they did, or what they would have you do?\u201d\n\u201cPeggy helped create SHIELD!\u201d Steve argued. \u201cYour father helped create SHIELD!\u201d\n\u201cMy father made shitty decisions and he was a shitty judge of character!\u201d Tony argued back. \u201cMy father was involved in some really shady business, Rogers. He made weapons. His fortune was soaked in the blood of America's enemies! He stole other people\u2019s work and designs. He gave Thaddeus Ross an accommodation when the man was first applying for a job in the DoD. He trusted Obadiah Stane to have his best interests at heart, even though Obi never left anyone with any doubt that all he cared about was money and power. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing which my father ever touched without royalty fucking it up. I mean, my father was the idiot who got his wife and himself killed because he was transporting five vials of experimental super soldier serum in the back of his civilian vehicle and-\u201d\n\u201cYour father was an ass,\u201d Bucky suddenly interjected. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t admire or emulate the guy. Got it. Stevie?\u201d\nWith a frown and a furrowed brow, Steve said, \u201cI never knew about any of that. Tony, you never told me.\u201d\n\u201cMost of it is public knowledge! If it wasn\u2019t public, it was in the file which SHIELD had on me,\u201d Tony pointed out.\n\u201cBesides a few lines about Stane, none of that was in your file!\u201d Steve argued. \u201cAnd there was never any mention of Stane and Howard working together! Stane was your business partner! If he was so horrible, why did you keep him at SI?!\u201d\n\u201cStane controlled SI for four years before I became eligible to take over, and by then I\u2019d developed an addiction to cocaine and could hardly get out of bed and get dressed under my own power, let alone run an entire company,\u201d Tony snapped back. \u201cAnd guess who it was who introduced me to the people who taught me about the delight of drugs in the first place?! That asshole worked long and hard to keep me down, Rogers! It\u2019s a miracle that I survived to the age of thirty, let alone the direct attack on my life which Stane orchestrated! And except for Stane's one direct attempt at murdering me, the rest of my life was so publicly documented that you can still find the before/after pictures of my stints in rehab! And that\u2019s saying something considering the fact that most of those stints happened before the world wide web was a thing.\u201d\n\u201cDoublespeak,\u201d Bucky once again warned.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s - how is that doublespeak?!\u201d Tony cried. \u201cI\u2019m spelling it out for him!\u201d\n\u201cI know, but it hasn\u2019t been spelled out before,\u201d Bucky replied. \u201cYou're glossing over a lot of information, and it seems like doublespeak. In fact, Winter had to explain most of your history to me. Like - Ivan Vanko is detailed in your file, but on paper he looks like a Russian copycat who was jealous of your fame and success and blamed you for his traitorous father\u2019s death. Winter had to explain to me me about how the arc reactor technology was originally designed by Vanko\u2019s father, and that guy had been charged with criminal conspiracy before getting deported from the country during the Cold War, a time in America\u2019s history where Vanko could have easily been framed or he could have been branded a Socialist sympathizer simply for trying to contact any of his family in Russia. I didn\u2019t understand that the man wouldn\u2019t have been in America and working for the government in the first place unless he had defected from the Communist Party by handing over some damning evidence to the US government before he was even allowed to enter the country. I didn\u2019t understand that upon getting kicked out of the US and returning to the Soviet Union, Vanko would have been treated as an outcast and a pariah by his former colleagues and the Russian government. You and Winter know what sort of environment that would have left Ivan Vanko to grow up in, so when you talk about Ivan Vanko it\u2019s with a different connotation than what the rest of us hear. You just know that he was raised in poverty and that he probably had to resort to crime at an early age just to get by, and he probably spent a lot of time in jail as a result. But without knowing the political and economical climate of that time, others would assume that he had just as many opportunities as the rest of us. You just know that he probably had a bad time of it in jail, and you just know how detrimental incarceration probably was to his brilliant psyche. You just know that the guy probably turned to alcohol to deal with his problems, and you just know how that further damaged him. You know exactly what Howard Stark did to that man and his family, and you assume that everyone else does, as well. You assume the same thing about Stane and his manipulations.\u201d\n\u201cYou spoke to the Winter Soldier about Ivan Vanko?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cWe read The Hunt for Red October a few weeks ago,\u201d Barnes replied.\n\u201cThe hunt for what?\u201d Steve asked with a furrowed brow as his eyes flickers from Bucky to Tony and then back again.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Tony said as he stared at Steve with wide eyes. But it was to Bucky he was speaking when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve repeated.\n\u201cYou and I missed a few things over the years,\u201d Bucky explained to his friend. \u201cIf the others got you caught up with current issues the same way they did with me\u2026 It\u2019s likely that a lot of information was left out or skipped over during the explanation.\u201d\nSteve let out a harried sigh. \u201cI know that. Clint calls it giving us the Cliff Notes. But what does that have to do with-\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been given a lot of information about a lot of things,\u201d Bucky reiterated. \u201cI was given the Cliff Notes on Tony Stark when I first moved into the tower, you know?\u201d\n\u201cIron Man, yes. Tony Stark, not recommended,\u201d Tony realized.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Bucky agreed.\nSteve ran an adgitated hand through his hair as he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted Tony Stark on the team. We\u2019ve tried to make you a part of the team, Tony. And you always shot us down.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still not listening, punk,\u201d Bucky told Steve. \u201cTony spent over fifteen years being manipulated by a megalomaniac who Tony believed cared for him and was his friend. Tony\u2019s file probably didn\u2019t go into much detail about Stane though, did it? Not beyond his trying to have Tony killed in Afghanistan. If anyone had cared to read the full length novel instead of the Cliff Notes, they would have realized that Tony has some major issues with trusting people, especially people who wish to exert control over him, his company, and the suit. Not because he\u2019s egocentric, or a control freak, or-or hoarding power or something, but because of the horrible things people have done and would do again if given half a chance.\u201d\nSteve grimaced, but then his brow furrowed. \u201cIf that's true, then why were you ready to subject us to the Accords, Tony?\u201d\n\u201cBecause people are scared of us,\u201d Tony stated. \u201cAnd for good reason. When we go into battle, we aren\u2019t the ones who die. Half of the people on our team committed criminal offences even before gaining superhero status. And none of us have a good track record when it comes to minimizing collateral damage.\u201d\n\u201cBucky says you have trust issues. When the government wanted your suit, you called a bunch of senators ass-clowns. But then you turn around and decide that you want those same people calling the shots for us?\u201d Steve pressed.\nHis lips pressed into a thin, angry line, Tony told Steve, \u201cDid you know that Senator Stern, who led the committee attempting to confiscate my suit, was a Hydra operative? And do you know what happened after that day? I was fined for cussing on CSPAN, and neither Hydra nor the government got any of my tech. I wasn\u2019t arrested for treason and my suit wasn\u2019t confiscated because there is a system in place which allows me to protect myself and my interests. Is it a perfect system? No. Does it protect every person and every person\u2019s interests? If it did, we\u2019d be living in a fucking utopia, so I can say with certainty that it doesn\u2019t. But it\u2019s something. It\u2019s something we need, it\u2019s something everyone needs, if we\u2019re going to survive and coexist with others.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice that the example you gave included a member of Hydra who was holding and exerting power over others,\u201d Steve dryly intoned.\n\u201cI reiterate - we don\u2019t live in a utopia,\u201d Tony tersely replied. \u201cThere will always be people who weasel their way into power in order to do bad things. Like Thaddeus Ross when he imprisoned all of you-\u201d\n\u201cYou were working for him!\u201d Steve hotly accused. \u201cYou knew he was bad news and you were on his side!\u201d\n\u201cOh for - Steve, you know what you should do? You should focus on the part of your job that involves punching people,\u201d Tony declared. \u201cRoss wasn\u2019t going to keep his position! That useless piece of shit wasn\u2019t going to last a week with us or the Accords.\u201d\n\u201cDoublespeak,\u201d Bucky chirped.\n\u201cIf you say doublespeak at me one more damn time-\u201d Tony seethed, now properly worked up.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Bucky demanded. Then, turning to Steve, he explained, \u201cWorking in politics isn\u2019t easy, and neither is working in big business. Part of the reason laws are so wordy and complicated is because lawmakers want to establish precise boundaries and rules which everyone has to follow, and even then there\u2019s more wiggle-room than most people are comfortable with within the law. Tony\u2019s lived in a world defined by those boundaries and he\u2019s practiced working around them his entire life. He knows far more about how these things work than any of us. And now? I think Tony\u2019s right. Steve, you don\u2019t understand the politics which go on behind the Accords. I barely understand them myself, and I\u2019ve been following the conferences and talks along with everyone else. I think Tony should be in charge of that part of the Avengers. And Tony, I think that your lone gunslinger mindset is too deeply ingrained for you to truly comprehend teamwork on the field. You get the mechanics of it, but you don\u2019t understand the spirit behind it, and that\u2019s what can make or break a team in battle. That\u2019s what Steve is good at, though. So he should be in charge of the Avengers\u2019 battles.\u201d\nSlowly, Steve told Bucky, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 already how we were doing things.\u201d\n\u201cOfficially?\u201d Bucky sardonically asked. \u201cAs in Tony\u2019s word in regards to the Avengers\u2019 legal situation is final, and your word in regards to battle-operations is final?\u201d\n\u201cBuck, that\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem-\u201d\n\u201cI am not-\u201d\n\u201cBoth of you shut your traps,\u201d Bucky snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be friends, okay? That\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. I\u2019m asking you to be coworkers. I\u2019m asking you each to officially do what you\u2019re good at. Tony, you\u2019re good at understanding legalities and managing large groups of people in boardrooms and during press conferences. Steve, you\u2019re good at managing people in the field of battle and acting as a strategist. So those are your official job assignments from now on. The rest of the team will still speak up when they want to or feel the need to, but you two have the final say in those particular areas because no one on this team can negotiate a deal like Tony, and no one is as strong a leader as Steve.\u201d\nBucky gave the both of them hard stares. Steve was the one to cave first.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he stubbornly ground out.\nTony immediately jumped at the concession. \u201cThat means no more secret calls to the Accords Committee behind my back,\u201d Tony demanded. \u201cIt means you stay out of it. You have no idea of how much ground I lost and how many favors I had to call in when I was arguing for them to let you and your lot back into the US and revoke your criminal status. We lost a lot of leeway and a lot of respect during that little stunt-\u201d\nWith a scowl firmly in place, Steve said, \u201cIf I stop working on the Accords, then you have to at least try being a part of the team. That means attending drills and team bonding nights and-\u201d\n\u201cWait, drills?\u201d Bucky asked.\n\u201cYeah, drills,\u201d Steve said with a frown towards Tony. \u201cWe\u2019ve only ever done practice drills sporadically, and if we\u2019re going to properly fight in the field, drills will be a regular mandatory event for everyone on the team.\u201d\n\u201cTony?\u201d Bucky asked. \u201cWhat do you say? You\u2019ll attend drills and follow Steve\u2019s lead in battle, and Steve will follow your lead in regards to the political side of the Avengers and with the Accords.\u201d\nWith an aggravated sigh, Tony said, \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re trending,\u201d MJ informed Tony when he walked into Midtown High\u2019s robotic lab for a Saturday of nerding out with a bunch of teenagers.\n\u201cI\u2019m always trending,\u201d Tony easily agreed as he made a beeline for one of the computer terminals to check out what his minions - unpaid child labor force - proteges had come up with by way of coding that month. \u201cWhat am I being trendy about today? World changing technology? Rescue and relief efforts in far off lands? Is it my new haircut?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s that list of rules you have posted on the Avengers floor of the tower,\u201d Ned chipperly informed him. \u201cMJ got photos of the list and Peter recorded some stuff.\u201d\n\u201cO...kay,\u201d Tony said slowly, turning away from his computer monitor to level MJ and Peter with a narrow-eyed gaze.\n\u201cShe made me do it!\u201d Peter fibbed as he pointed an accusing finger at MJ.\n\u201cI strongly suggested,\u201d MJ corrected.\n\u201cYou were threatening me with blackmail!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you made the choice to bow under pressure.\u201d\nTony turned back to the computer, quickly pulling up a web browser and almost instantly finding the YouTube account named AvengersInAnarchy999. The account was only five hours old and had three videos, and all three videos had already gone viral.\nClicking on the first upload, Tony watched as a large picture of the Avengers House Rules was displayed - and jeez, he hadn\u2019t realized that it had gotten so out of control. What had started as a neatly typed and printed list had turned into a sprawling web of additions, amendments, and contradictions over the years. The whiteboard which was originally meant for \u201csuggestions\u201d had gone to hell ages ago - Tony blamed Thor for mixing up the dry erase marker with a permanent marker. Then, construction paper had been tacked all over the wall, some pages with multiple rules written out on them, and some with only a single very important rule written out in bold marker. Eventually, people had stopped bothering with paper at all. Scott\u2019s daughter had written a rule directly on the wall in crayon after an incident with one of her stuffed animals during a visit. Natasha liked to carve rules which she considered particularly important into the plaster. Tony liked to include diagrams and illustrations with his additions, and Clint liked to shoot arrows into the rules he wasn\u2019t fond of.\nOut of context, it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious what was being pictured on the video. The hodgepodge looked like a crazy person\u2019s attempt to map the timeline of a conspiracy which wasn't real and had never occurred. Clarification was quick to come, however, as the picture zoomed in on the mess. Atop the screen, the words AVENGER HOUSE RULES appeared, and the picture stopped zooming when 9: Don\u2019t eat Thor\u2019s Pop-Tarts was clear and legible on the screen.\n\u201cThor hasn\u2019t been by in ages,\u201d Rhodey was saying as the video began to play.\n\u201cPlatypus, no,\u201d Tony groaned.\n\u201cDude, don\u2019t even,\u201d Clint warned in the video.\nGrabbing one of the boxes of cinnamon Pop-Tarts from the cupboard, Rhodey said, \u201cThor hasn\u2019t been by in so long, these have probably gone stale.\u201d\n\u201cThe vikings called Thor the god of fertility,\u201d Clint pointed out. \u201cNothing of his ever goes stale.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to miss one package,\u201d Rhodey insisted. \u201cEspecially if I replace the box-\u201d\n\u201cWe just finished dealing with the fallout from the Accords, man,\u201d Clint sighed. \u201cDo you really want to start an intergalactic incident over artificially flavored toaster pastries?\u201d\n\u201cArtificially flavored with LSD and meth,\u201d Rhodey pointed out. \u201cIf anyone can be blamed for what is about it happen, it\u2019s the corporation responsible for devising these amazing morsels of-\u201d\nAs soon as the seal broke on the Pop-Tart\u2019s box, a klaxon sounded and demonic chanting filled the air. The kitchen lights dimmed, the walls shuddered, and then a moment later the room returned to its normal state of being.\nOr at least it was mostly normal.\nRhodey still stood in the center of the kitchen, but his complexion was ashen, his eyes were wide, and the box of Pop-Tarts was mysteriously missing from the man\u2019s hands.\n\u201cDid I just die?\u201d Rhodey quietly asked.\nBarton stood from his chair with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll go see if Dr. Strange is around. If not, then\u2026 go lie down for a bit. It will wear off in a couple of hours,\u201d Barton instructed as he quickly moved to search for the resident magic-user.\n\u201cI think I just spent an eternity in hell,\u201d Rhodey told the empty kitchen.\n\u201cHouse Rule Nine,\u201d Natasha recited as she came into the kitchen, walked around Rhodey, and opened the fridge to grab some milk. \u201cDon\u2019t touch Thor\u2019s Pop-Tarts.\u201d\nThe next video started much the same way, with a full view of the House Rules before the view zoomed to focus on one in particular.\n23: Coffee is life.\nThis video was a montage. It showed a dozen different incidents as well as the dozen House Rules and addendums which were directly related to rule 23. It was a hilarious and horrible compilation, showing various members of the team as they attempted to operate while either undercaffeinated or overcaffeinated.\u00a0\n\u201cThis one\u2019s my favorite,\u201d MJ informed Tony as a split screen popped up.\nOne side showed Tony slouched on a couch in the common area and doing absolutely nothing to escape or extinguish the flames quickly engulfing the cushion beside him as he blearily said, \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about it tomorrow.\u201d The other half of the screen showed Wanda as she paced back and forth in front of a stairwell while speaking quickly, saying, \u201cThe alarms would sound if something was wrong - I will not use my powers to summon the elevator. I will not use my powers to summon the elevator. Bad idea. Steve! Steve!\u00a0I need for you to practice good judgement for me! What do I do? How should I help? I mean, is the tower under attack or what?\u201d\nAs Steve patiently explained to Wanda that the elevator was working just fine, she was at the doorway to the stairwell, and that the fully functioning elevator was down the hall, the words House Rule 33: Don\u2019t switch the full strength with half-caff appeared at the bottom of the screen.\nAs the third video began, Tony blinked as the shot zoomed in on a rule which he had been unaware of until that very moment. 64: Don\u2019t engage in prank wars with the Winter Soldier.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was Winter I was up against!\u201d Sam sulked from where he had his head in the kitchen sink. Steve was helping him wash something off his head while Vision wrote the new rule onto a napkin and then tacked it onto the wall with the other house rules.\n\u201cDid you honestly think it was Tony messing with your wings?\u201d Steve asked with a sigh. \u201cYou know he doesn\u2019t mess with our mission gear when he pranks us.\u201d\n\u201cAfter that little heart-to-heart we had last month, I thought he may have upped the ante and gotten more demonstrative in his anger towards us.\u201d\n\u201cTony doesn\u2019t mess with our mission gear,\u201d Steve said again, more firmly this time. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that no matter how angry he was. Tony doesn\u2019t do anything which would endanger us during a fight.\u201d\n\u201cBut Winter would,\u201d Sam muttered.\n\u201cWinter is very protective of Tony,\u201d Vision pointed out. \u201cWhile you may have been attempting to engage in playful comradery with Tony, and Tony would have understood the prank as such, Winter probably saw the trap laid out for Tony and interpreted it as an attempt to scare, hurt, or humiliate him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tony is Winter\u2019s favorite,\u201d Sam groused. \u201cYeah, I think we\u2019ve figured that out.\u201d\n\u201cFigured what out?\u201d Bucky asked as he wandered into the kitchen. \u201cHow to get that red goop off of you?\u201d\n\u201cWait, you knew about this?\u201d Steve asked, turning from the sink so that his red-stained hands were in plain view of the camera.\n\u201cWas my idea,\u201d Barnes replied with a shit-eating grin.\n\u201cVision, add another rule,\u201d Sam said from the sink. \u201cThe Winter Soldier and Bucky Barnes aren\u2019t allowed to do team-ups.\u201d\nVision was writing on a napkin again, but he said, \u201cIf we started making rules against Winter and Bucky teaming up, we\u2019d have to make rules against other people teaming up, as well. It would make team practice and game nights considerably less entertaining.\u201d\nSoon, a napkin which read 65: Do not engage in prank wars with Bucky Barnes was tacked to the wall. Then 66: Don\u2019t f*** with Tony Stark and give the Winter Soldier or Bucky Barnes any reason to disregard rules 64 or 65.\n\u201cThat last one wasn\u2019t actually all that funny,\u201d Tony pointed out after the video had ended.\n\u201cMJ said we had to post it for the good of mankind,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cThe good of mankind?\u201d Tony incredulously repeated. \u201cAre Winter and Bucky\u2019s prank skills that much of a threat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just their mad pranking skills, idiot,\u201d MJ said with a roll of her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the massive crush they have on you and fair warning to villains everywhere that if they mess with you, they\u2019ll have a devious Super Sniper/Assassin combo to deal with.\u201d\nTony almost did a spit take regardless of the fact that he wasn\u2019t drinking anything.\n\u201cThey do not-\u201d\nBefore Tony could even get the words out, MJ reached around him, took control of the cursor, and scrolled down to some of the comments under the video.\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s popular opinion doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a fact,\u201d Tony weakly informed the teenagers after reading some of the very supportive comments which were posted beneath the final video.\nBarnes usually only spent time in the penthouse if he woke up in the Winter Soldier\u2019s bed. Tony was therefore surprised when one evening, it was Bucky who stepped off the elevator, slouched into the living area, and collapsed onto one of the couches, rather than Winter.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sargent?\u201d Tony asked as he looked up from the specs he was reviewing for R&amp;D.\n\u201cSteve and I had a fight,\u201d Bucky informed him.\nAt least, Tony thought that was what the man said. It could have been, \u201cMy lego fort is fallen,\u201d or, \u201cMy appendix has ruptured.\u201d It was hard to tell when Bucky was lying face-down and had his face pressed into the couch cushions.\nJust to make sure, Tony asked, \u201cDo you need to go to the hospital?\u201d\nBucky chuckled as he sat up. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come to blows. There was just a lot of yelling.\u201d\nNot the appendix one, then.\n\u201cWhat were you fighting about?\u201d Tony asked. Winter, probably, Tony thought. Because that was what Bucky and Steve argued about the most.\n\u201cThe same thing we always fight about,\u201d Bucky informed him. \u201cYou.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Tony asked, his eyes wide.\nWith a tired sigh, Bucky\u2019s head fell back on the couch as he explained, \u201cHe seems to think that since you and I get along these days, it means that you and he should get along as well.\u201d\n\u201cWe get along fine,\u201d Tony announced, which he was proud to say was true. Since the Avengers had started running team drills regularly, their battles had become much smoother. Steve had learned not to throw his shield anywhere near Tony, and the rest of the team had gotten used to Tony not always being around to catch them when they fell (Wilson had taken over acting as the team\u2019s transport during battles). The team dynamics were getting better off the field, too. Tony no longer had to find excuses to Get the Hell Out whenever Steve was within his immediate vicinity for longer than ten minutes, and Tony no longer felt like bashing his head against the wall whenever he spoke with the other Avengers about the Accords. It turned out that setting and maintaining boundaries was the thing to do when a bunch of superheroes with sensitive dispositions lived and worked together.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cBut Steve wants things to be the way they used to be.\u201d\n\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d Tony instantly declared.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cThus, the argument. It\u2019s like\u2026 He got me back, and now he thinks that if he applies the same principles and methods to get you back, everything will be fine and dandy again.\u201d\n\u201cExcept that if he employed the principles and methods he used to rescue you to me, the team would probably be left dealing with a second personality who isn\u2019t nearly as happy-go-lucky and fanciful-free as Winter,\u201d Tony intoned.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bucky said as he gave Tony a shit eating grin. \u201cIf you ended up in the same predicament as me, I think you might be the evil half of that equation.\u201d\n\u201cWinter\u2019s not evil,\u201d Tony replied, the words a knee-jerk reaction after spending months defending the man\u2019s very right to exist.\n\u201cThat fucker likes green skittles,\u201d Bucky argued. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t an indication that he\u2019s the Antichrist, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with green skittles?\u201d Tony asked, honestly offended. \u201cThey should have stopped after making the green skittles. But no, they had to go and ruin a good thing by making every bag a rainbow monstrosity, and it\u2019s things like this that are the reason it took me such a long time to figure out that you weren\u2019t the second worst person in the world, Barnes. Why would you even suggest-\u201d\nBucky was still grinning at him, and Tony realized that the ass was trolling him.\nRolling his eyes, Tony reminded Bucky of the issue at hand. \u201cThe green Skittles are the best Skittles. End of story, stop distracting me. I still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re arguing with Steve about me. Just because I\u2019m not getting along with one of the other kids on the playground doesn\u2019t mean you need to step in all the time. I can look after myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t always have to, though,\u201d the man hummed in response. \u201cAnd Steve needs to come to terms with the fact that he\u2019s never going to have a buddy-buddy relationship with you again. I\u2019ve been heading him off from cornering you for a talk for weeks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd today was different from those other times because\u2026?\u201d\nBucky grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting a little frustrated with having the same conversation over and over again, and I may have let my frustration get to me, and I may have told Steve that he wasn\u2019t any better than Obadiah Stane.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyebrows slowly rose as he processed this information. \u201cYou told him what?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d Bucky defensively declared. \u201cI was just trying to make him understand why you wouldn\u2019t be friends with him again and why he should leave you alone, but then I may have pointed out what you did to the last person who betrayed you and took a kill shot at your arc reactor. Now he\u2019s not speaking to me, and he hasn\u2019t stopped wailing on the bags in the gym all afternoon.\u201d\nTony wanted to point out that the Steve-Acting-Like-Stane analogy wasn't exactly inaccurate, and he wanted to thank Bucky for sticking up for him and having his back, but it seemed like these would be inappropriate responses considering how upset Bucky was about the situation.\nTony remembered the times he\u2019d called Rhodey to complain about Pepper when they were still dating. He\u2019d made the calls because he needed to vent, but at the same time he didn\u2019t feel like Rhodey knew Pepper the same way Tony did. He appreciated it when Rhodey made sympathetic noises about whatever situation Tony was complaining about, but if Rhodey ever said anything nasty about Pepper, Tony became very defensive of her very quickly, and suddenly he would be upset at Pepper and Rhodey both.\nThis is why Tony surrounded himself with AIs.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Steve,\u201d Tony decided with a harried sigh.\nBucky frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to-\u201d\n\u201cYes I do. You shouldn\u2019t be fighting these battles for me, and I\u2019m not going to let you damage your relationship with your BFF just because I\u2019d rather run from this particular problem than face it. I\u2019m getting this over with.\u201d\n\u201cBucky was right, you know,\u201d Tony told Steve after they were finished yelling at each other and had gotten all of the really nasty bits out of their systems. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be friends with you, and I\u2019m not going to trust you. Been there, done that, and all it got me was a knife to the back, your shield to my arc reactor, millions of dollars in property damage and reparations, and over a year of muddling through the Accords by myself.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, Tony,\u201d Steve tried, looking exhausted.\n\u201cIs that supposed to make it better?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cCongratulations, Steve. You did worse by me than most of the people who actively try to kill me and destroy my life. You don\u2019t honestly expect me to allow you into a position where you can do that to me again, do you?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s shoulders sagged as he finally, finally gave in. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he quietly conceded.\n\u201cGood. Then stop being an ass to Bucky, stop harassing me, and focus on making sure that we can at least work together on the field.\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t sure how to approach the subject with Winter, since it was one of the few topics they\u2019d never actually discussed.\nTherefore, Tony brought the issue up with all of the tact and grace which he used when approaching any unfamiliar situation.\nHe tossed the tablet which he was working on towards the soldier, and when the man caught it and glanced at the schematics open on the screen, Tony declared, \u201cDone!\u201d\nWinter studied the blueprints with a raised eyebrow, then asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSergeant Barnes doesn\u2019t like the star. Our born and bred Brooklyn boy finds it offensive, and he wants to wear an American made product. He asked me if I could look into a new design. You\u2019re the one who remembers the shit Hydra did with the arm, though, so I thought this was one body modification that shouldn\u2019t be done without full consent and approval from all parties involved. Waking up with a tramp stamp is one thing - it happens to the best of us. Waking up with a new arm is something else entirely. And I mean, those Hydra guys did something right with you, in that they gave you a well designed and well built appendage. But this design has a few new bells and whistles and a very much improved power cell-\u201d\nSquinting at the screen, Winter asked, \u201cIs that a switchblade in the wrist?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s detachable and everything,\u201d Tony confirmed.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the soldier asked, his brow furrowed. \u201cI keep half a dozen knives on me at all times, and this design is also equipped with a - is that a repulsor? It has repulsor technology, flashbangs, a taser, and three tranq darts stashed inside of it. Why the fuck is there a switchblade in the wrist?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought it would look cool?\u201d Tony said with a shrug.\nTony was surprised when Winter responded by dropping the tablet, launching himself over the coffee table, and attacking Tony. With his mouth.\nWinter was very thorough and very efficient when it came to kissing. Tony was well aware that the soldier was capable of multitasking, but Tony had never considered the epicness which might occur when that ability was applied to kissing. There were lips, teeth, and tongue all over the place, all at once, Winter wasn\u2019t shy about using his metal hand to grip Tony\u2019s hip tight enough to leave a bruise, and he didn\u2019t hesitate in taking full advantage of Tony\u2019s overwhelmed state to make Tony\u2019s body do exactly what he wanted it to do.\n\u201cDamnit!\u201d Rhodey cried, making Tony jerk in surprise. Because yeah, a kiss that had lasted maybe thirty seconds had made him forget that the rest of the world existed, and that Rhodey had only left the living area to make a new bag of popcorn. \u201cWinter, we\u2019ve talked about this! It\u2019s fine and even somewhat understandable that you\u2019re completely obsessed with my best friend, but I don\u2019t want to see it or hear about it or-\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Rhodes,\u201d Winter responded as he sat up - and when did Tony wind up on his back, and how did they get to the floor? \u201cTony just designed a new arm for me, and he put an extraneous weapon in it just for shits and giggles. He is going to be rewarded for his behavior, your sensitive constitution be damned-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sensitive!\u201d Rhodey argued. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough hearing you talk about all of the depraved sexual acts you intend to perform on the guy who\u2019s like a brother to me. It\u2019s something else entirely to have to watch you engage in those acts in public spaces where I hang out and watch tv and sometimes take naps. And we\u2019re in the middle of a movie, dude! I\u2019ve been trying to sit through the entirety of Transformers for almost a decade, and-\u201d\nAs Winter and Rhodey continued to loudly argue, Tony sat up and rubbed at his lips, which were honest-to-Oden tingling, and then he rubbed at his back, which hurt - he must have hit the floor hard, and it was a testament to Winter\u2019s ability that Tony hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\u201cI think I may have had a religious experience,\" Tony breathed.\n\u201cIt certainly looked that way,\u201d Dr. Strange said from his place lounging in a nearby recliner.\n\u201cUm, shouldn\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d Tony asked as he watched Winter carefully remove the butterfly displays from the wall of his room.\n\u201cWe have talked about it,\u201d Winter responded.\nBlinking, Tony asked, \u201cWhen was this? I don\u2019t remember having any let\u2019s move in together after sharing one mind blowing\u00a0kiss conversation.\u201d\nTony almost immediately regretted this statement when he saw the self-satisfied smirk stretching across Winter\u2019s lips.\n\u201cI probably should have been more clear,\u201d Winter told him. \u201cBarnes and I have talked about it. We decided that while you\u2019re an attractive, kind, brilliant man, you\u2019re slow on the uptake when it comes to understanding people and making decisions about your personal relationship with them. Therefore, we\u2019re in charge. Technically, right now, I\u2019m in charge. And I say that no, we are not moving too fast and we don\u2019t need to discuss this. I say that I should have moved into your room weeks ago.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I've been doing great in the personal relationships department for the last few months!\u201d Tony pointed out.\n\u201cOnly because I\u2019ve been scaring people away from you and Barnes has been mediating your conversations with the others. And I hate to admit it, but Barnes is right - it\u2019s somewhat concerning that you\u2019ve been so twisted up and screwed over by people that you\u2019re more willing to interact with and support someone like me than to get to know and work with someone like Barnes.\u201d\nTony was very confused about what was happening. Bucky and Winter had been talking behind his back, clearly. But\u2026\n\u201cYou two hate each other,\u201d Tony pointed out, because that was the one thing he knew for sure. Even though they\u2019d started communicating, Winter and Bucky hated each other. They hated each other, and that would probably never change because there weren\u2019t exactly any trust fall exercises the two men could do to build trust or camaraderie of any kind.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Winter instantly agreed. \u201cBut we don\u2019t hate you. And you don\u2019t hate us. So we\u2026 we are going to share you.\u201d\nThe way Winter said the word share, it sounded like profanity.\n\u201cOh, well if you and Bucky have agreed, then okay,\u201d Tony dryly stated.\nWinter rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that attitude. You and I both know that you can stand up for yourself when you really need or want to. If any aspect of what is happening right now was upsetting to you, you wouldn\u2019t be standing here talking to me, and you certainly wouldn\u2019t be passively watching me take apart my room so that I could move all my stuff. If you want to play injured and ignored, pull that shit with Barnes, not me. Now make yourself useful. Start carrying this stuff to your room. The sooner we\u2019re done here, the sooner we can go back to inappropriately making out in public places and offending our friends and coworkers.\u201d\nIt figured that Winter would instantly find a means of controlling him via a system of positive reinforcement. No one else had ever realized how powerful an incentive making out was for him. As it was, Tony trusted that Bucky wouldn\u2019t let Winter use that knowledge to take advantage of him too often.\nTony awoke to a slap in the face.\nIt took him a moment to realize that he wasn\u2019t being slapped, but rather smacked. Beside him, Bucky was flailing about as he sat up, his head whipping from side to side and his eyes wide as he asked, \u201cWhere the fuck am I?\u201d\n\u201cYou are currently on the top floor of Stark Tower. The year is 2016 and the day-\u201d FRIDAY began to recite, and Bucky immediately relaxed.\n\u201cYeah, so Winter decided to move into my room last night and then we made out for a while,\u201d Tony announced as he rubbed at the spot where Bucky\u2019s flailing hand had connected with the side of his head.\nBucky jumped at the sound of Tony\u2019s voice, but then his eyes seemed to register Tony, and the bed, and Tony\u2019s - now Tony and Winter\u2019s - bedroom.\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting him keep those stupid butterflies?\u201d Bucky asked, his expression going sour. \u201cYou\u2019re letting him display them in your bedroom?\u201d\n\u201cWinter said that if I get to keep my Iron Man merch on the walls, then he gets to keep his butterflies on the walls, too,\u201d Tony explained.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the deal, then I get to put up the paintings that Steve\u2019s made for me.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that; I may not like the guy, but his art is literally a work of art and - wait, what? You mean you\u2019re going to put them up in here?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to put them here. I\u2019m moving in, too.\u201d\nWith a groan, Tony flopped back onto the mattress. \u201cYou were supposed to be the reasonable one, Barnes. You were supposed to be the one who wanted to talk things out and do things the boring normal way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd dance around with dates and wooing while Winter get\u2019s to live with you and make out with you? Don\u2019t get me wrong, you and I are still doing all of that, and there will be plenty of conversations and other normal boring things-\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Tony huffed.\n\u201c- but we\u2019ll be doing all of it while living together. I\u2019ll be damned if Winter\u2019s the only one who gets to smooch on you.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it smooching,\u201d Tony told him. \u201cSmooching implies a level of gentleness and innocence which is distinctly lacking from Winter\u2019s technique-\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be the one smooching,\u201d Bucky declared with determination.\nAnd smooch he did.\nThe kiss was simple and brief, hardly more than a quick press of lips. When Bucky pulled away, he was making a face at Tony\u2019s morning breath, but he didn\u2019t move very far away and his eyes were smiling even while his nose was scrunched up in distaste.\nThe entire thing was so fucking sweet it made Tony\u2019s gums ache, but he was smiling as Bucky said, \u201cGo brush your teeth and get dressed. You\u2019re helping me move today.\u201d\n\u201cYou move quick,\u201d Scott noted as they watched Steve and Bucky argue over which items would be remaining in Steve\u2019s rooms and which would be accompanying Bucky for his move-in with Tony. Most of the argument seemed to be about clothing. And not nice clothing, either, but worn out shirts and baggy sweatpants. When Tony had offered to buy Bucky some new laze-about-the-penthouse-clothes, Bucky had whined about how long it would take to properly wear the clothes in until they were of optimal worn comfortableness.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t move at all,\u201d Tony pointed out. \u201cWinter set the moving trend, and Bucky's simply following his lead.\u201d\n\u201cYou owe me fifty bucks,\u201d Clint told Natasha, and the woman sighed.\nHis eyebrows jolting upwards, Sam asked, \u201cYou bet against Tony getting together with Winter and Barnes?\u201d\n\u201cThis particular wager precedes Bucky and Winter by several years,\u201d Clint gleefully corrected as he watched Natasha count out bills. \u201cWhen the Avengers were first being formed and we were reviewing the potential member files, Nat and I spent quite a bit of time parsing through tabloid articles and reports of Tony\u2019s Sexcapades, and we made a game of trying to figure out which reports were real and which ones weren't.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way of getting to know your teammates, I guess,\u201d Tony dryly commented.\n\u201cLike you haven\u2019t spent hours looking over our mission reports from SHIELD while trying to figure out which details were truthful and which ones were more FUBAR than they appeared on paper,\u201d Natasha countered.\nAnd, point.\n\u201cNatasha thought that most of the reports were exaggerated, strait up fabrications, or that you'd outgrown your seemingly adventurous attitude in bed and that you\u2019d gone vanilla,\u201d Clint informed him.\n\u201cNo one has ever called me vanilla about anything in my life,\u201d Tony incredulously stated as he looked over to Natasha.\n\u201cI think we've all known for a very, very long time that my initial assessment of you was way off the mark. And in my defense, you stopped sleeping around after you received the arc reactor, and I always suspected that your time being held captive had left you with so many triggers that trying for anything beyond vanilla was a no go,\u201d Natasha told him.\n\u201cHey, do all of you sit around and speculate about my sex life like this?\u201d Sam asked, his brow furrowed in concern.\nIgnoring Sam, Clint accepted Natasha\u2019s money with a grin as he announced, \u201cI said that you were so wild and adventurous that you would somehow manage to do something in sex or a relationship which had never been done before. Considering the fact that Bucky and Winter are something that\u2019s never been done before, and now you\u2019re in a relationship with them\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI bet the sex is still vanilla,\u201d Natasha muttered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not! I mean, it won\u2019t be, when sex actually starts happening!\u201d Tony insisted.\n\u201cEither way, I win on the technicality,\u201d Clint gloated.\n\u201cCan we stop talking about this?\u201d Scott sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit through any more presentations about Sexual Harassment in the Workplace, please.\u201d\n\u201cDon't those rules only apply when we\u2019re out in the field?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cAsking us not to talk about sex in the place where we live and spend all of our downtime seems a little extreme.\u201d\nAs the debate devolved into something which Tony knew was going to result in their team sitting through a seminar of some kind, Tony decided that it was fine if his teammates were under the impression that his sex life was vanilla. The first time anyone said as much around Winter, he would correct them with impunity.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re\u2026 dating both of them,\u201d Pepper slowly confirmed.\n\u201cI guess so? I\u2019m definitely dating Barnes. He\u2019s been very considerate in letting me know when we\u2019re hanging out together and when we\u2019re technically on a date. Winter isn\u2019t nearly as concise - I think he likes to keep me on my toes and guessing. But regardless of our relationship status, we\u2019re definitely living together.\u201d\nThe tilt of Pepper\u2019s mouth and eyebrows indicated her disbelief, but in true Pepper form, she only continued to patiently nod as she asked, \u201cAnd how is cohabitation working out for you?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than I thought it would,\u201d Tony honestly replied. \u201cIt helps that Winter and Bucky can never be in the same room at the same time. I don\u2019t think they would be capable of sharing any sort of space if I wasn\u2019t there to talk them down from expressing their opinions on the other\u2019s taste in decor via vandalization. The best part of it, I think, is that since Winter\u2019s rooming with me now, we\u2019ve been able to convert his old room into a library so we won\u2019t have to put any more bookcases up in the living room.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Pepper agreed. \u201cBecause the most unpleasant part of dating two men sharing one body is rearranging your living room so that you don\u2019t have to be assaulted by the view of something non-electrical occupying space in your home.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Tony confirmed.\nPepper gave a long sigh, and her eyes darkened until she was giving him the No More Games face. Pepper\u2019s No More Games face was twice as horrible as Steve\u2019s Game Face.\nUsually, Tony cowered before that gaze. Today, it caused Tony to feel like something was finally right.\nTony and Pepper\u2019s break-up had been nasty, and they had faked their friendly attitudes towards one another for a long time afterwards. After months of seeing each other in boardrooms and greeting each other with pointedly polite smiles or tentative nods, they began to forgive each other and move on. Now, when Pepper leveled him with that familiar, terrifying look, Tony felt like he finally had his friend back.\n\u201cThey\u2019re treating you well?\u201d Pepper seriously asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he was confidently able to tell her.\nTony was 75% correct when he announced to the team that his sex life with Winter and Bucky wouldn\u2019t be vanilla.\nWinter was a kinky fucker. He was controlling, and possessive, and sometimes a little dangerous. His idea of going slow involved the use of intricate knots when tying Tony up and experimentation with orgasm denial. He didn\u2019t so much cuddle after sex as he allowed Tony to collapse on top of him in a boneless, tired heap. Also, Winter was shameless when it came to public displays of affection. His leer was a thing of magnificence, and it never failed to make Tony\u2019s knees go weak (Rhodey liked to claim that Tony was swooning).\nBucky, on the other hand, was very thoughtful during sex. His every move and action seemed purposeful and deliberate, and Tony gagged a bit the first time he thought of it as love making. When Bucky kissed Tony in front of others, they were the kind of kisses which made people sigh and go Awww. Which wasn\u2019t to say he couldn\u2019t get a little dirty - Bucky was a bit of an exhibitionist - he liked having sex in semi-public places, and most of their dates outside of the tower ended with the two of them going at it in a restaurant\u2019s bathroom or in Tony\u2019s car.\nIt only ever got awkward when one of the men would wake up ready for sex only to find that the other had already thoroughly worn Tony out. Tony refused to help mediate the argument which ensued where Bucky and Winter tried to work out some sort of schedule for sex with Tony (Tony soon discovered that either way the argument went, he was the winner of all the things).\nHe should have known better than to let the two men work it out for themselves.\n\u201cT-G-I-S,\u201d Tony said by way of greeting the day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday,\u201d Winter grunted in response.\nRolling onto his back, Tony blearily rubbed at his eyes as he glanced at Winter sitting beside him in bed. The man's back was propped against the headboard as he read a collection of short stories by the Grimm brothers.\nTony turned, flopping over to lie across Winter\u2019s legs before pulling the blankets tight around his shoulders. He fully intended to fall back to sleep as he told the soldier, \u201cCallenders, months of the year, days of the week, and the 24 hours of the day are artificial constructs created by humans in order to add some form of structure to their chaotic lives. They are sloppy and inefficient artificial constructs, and I just completed a magnificent workshop bender, so it\u2019s Saturday if I damn well say it\u2019s Saturday. It\u2019s the spirit of the thing that counts, so T-G-I-S.\u201d\nTo drive home his point, Tony forcefully snuggled against Winter\u2019s legs and abdomen. Snuggling only happened with Winter on the weekends when the rare lazy day occurred. Winter was ambivalent about snuggling at the best of times, but he was especially tolerant of Tony\u2019s attempts when he was reading in bed - Tony\u2019s head and shoulders made a fine perch for the man\u2019s books.\nLetting out a long sigh, Tony closed his eyes, preparing for another few hours of shuteye when Winter surprised him by saying, \u201cFRIDAY? Inform Ms. Potts that Tony is celebrating the weekend, and he won\u2019t be into the office until the next time the artificial construct known as Monday rolls around.\u201d\nTony groaned. \u201cThe artificial construct of time argument doesn\u2019t work on Pepper, Winter. She says that if I get to construct artificial intelligence, then I have to adhere to other people\u2019s artificial constructions as well and - Wait. Did you just call in my vacation days? Winter, vacation days are not an artificial construct. Vacation days are a mathematical formula. They involve money, and increments of non-artificial time in which I don\u2019t have to show up at the office, and I was going to use those days to take you on some Indiana Jones style tomb raiding adventures. Please tell me you are not forsaking the chance to explore jungles, rob graves, and tussle with cannibalistic voodoo cults so that we can laze around in bed and read Germanic fairy tales.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s my birthday,\u201d Winter replied.\nAt this, Tony became as close to fully awake and alert as he could before his first cup of coffee. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as he sat up. \u201cI mean\u2026 Bucky\u2019s birthday is in March\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m sharing a day with that asshole? Fuck that,\u201d Winter scoffed.\n\u201cAnd today is your birthday because\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I decided it was,\u201d Winter replied.\n\u201cAh. Of course,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cWell\u2026 The adventure vacation was supposed to be for our one year anniversary - I was going to get you the hat and the whip and everything.\u201d\nWinter\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cWould I get to use the whip on you?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t ask me things like that, Winter. I\u2019m getting old, and I have a heart condition. The autopsy will read death by anticipation. But yeah. I can rush order the hat and the whip - let me just arrange for the plane tickets and-\u201d\nBefore Tony could reach his phone, he found himself on his back being straddled by a half naked Winter Soldier.\n\u201cSave it for the anniversary,\u201d the man commanded. \u201cToday is my birthday, and I get to decide how we celebrate.\u201d\nTony\u2019s breath hitched as the man slowly and purposefully ran the tips of his fingers down Tony\u2019s arms, then grabbed his wrists and pinned them above his head.\nLeaning close, Winter warned him, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday, and no one\u2019s going to notice you missing for five days.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tony breathed.\nTony wasn\u2019t usually one for taking things slow, especially when it came to something he wanted. An orgasm, for example. He was very impatient when it came to climaxing during sex.\nWinter countered his impatience with several lines of rope and a cock ring.\nWinter had been preparing to celebrate his birthday for some time, apparently. He spent the morning getting Tony worked up, touching him carefully and patiently, his expression detached and his eyes observant as Tony got closer and closer to the edge only for Winter to pull away and add yet another restraint. It was all very calculated, and Tony was soon cursing as he realized that Winter was purposefully winding him up and holding off for his own amusement.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Tony panted as Winter pressed several well-slicked fingers in and out of Tony, his movements slow and methodical as he idly watched Tony writhe against the ropes restraining him. His arms were secured above his head, and his legs were held up and apart, secured to his chest and leaving him spread and fully displayed for Winter. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he insisted as Winter idly caught a bit of lube dripping from Tony\u2019s ass before pushing it back inside of him. \u201cGet inside of me and fuck me. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\nIn response, Winter hummed. \u201cYou may be ready, but I\u2019m not,\u201d he informed Tony with a pleased leer.\nTony groaned in annoyance as Winter withdrew, turning towards the entire fucking chest of toys he\u2019d set next to the bed. Tony\u2019s groan turned into a sob as Winter returned and pressed a plug into him.\nGrinning, Winter told him, \u201cI think I\u2019m ready for a bit of a break. Tell me if you\u2019re about to strain anything. It would be a pity if you were taken out of the game before we could properly start playing.\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Tony snarled as Winter grabbed his book from the bedside table and settled against the headboard beside his bound form.\n\u201cBe patient,\u201d Winter hummed in reply.\nTony was impatient, but Winter\u2019s special form of torture was worth it, he though.\nIt took Winter a while to get properly worked up, so it was rare for Tony to see him in full form. It was a treat, reserved for special occasions when time was put aside and Winter was able to work without distraction or interruption.\nWinter\u2019s eyes were dark, his pupils blown wide, and he was looking at Tony like he was prey, and like he was going to be devoured.Tony was gone by then. He\u2019d lost track of the hours, and the toys, and the games, and he was little more than a blubbering, sloppy mess of nerves and sensation.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he quietly begged, his voice gravely and hoarse, only a little louder than a whimper. \u201cWinter, please.\u201d\nThe man responded with a pleased, satisfied hum as he spent another few moments admiring Tony\u2019s bound form. Then, Winter slowly and carefully tugged at a few knots, causing the ropes to go slack and fall away from Tony, letting his body unfurl and go limp. He groaned as his bruised, aching limbs were released, but Tony lacked the energy and presence of mind to stretch or move.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Winter breathed as he effortlessly rearranged Tony\u2019s limbs to his satisfaction, Tony unresistant and limp as he was repositioned. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Tony. Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t think, and don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d\nTony let out a long, low sound when Winter finally removed the plug, and then finally, finally, the man was inside of him and pounding into hims with long, hard thrusts.\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Tony\u2019s every breath was a sob. He was all feeling and sensation, Winter had kept him that way for hours. \u201cPlease,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Winter breathed and then he finally, finally, released Tony\u2019s cock from the ring.\n\u201cWhat a fucking mess.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes slid open, but his body wasn\u2019t able to do much else. As he took inventory of himself, he instantly knew that Winter\u2019s treatment would leave him out of commission for at least two more days.\n\u201cBuck?\u201d he managed to breath.\n\u201cRelax, Tony. FRIDAY\u2019s starting a bath, and the food will be here by the time we\u2019ve finished cleaning you up.\u201d\nIt took every spare bit of Tony\u2019s concentration and energy to roll to his side. Through slatted eyelids, he saw Bucky grimacing as he neatly rewound and put away Winter's rope, then began gathering the various toys which Winter had employed and discarded during their time together.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a rule?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cA Winter-Bucky Bedroom Rule about cleaning up your own messes or something?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky replied. \u201cBut Winter\u2019s decided on his birthday, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony asked, because while the entire thing had been amazing, Winter\u2019s arbitrary method of choosing a date for his birthday seemed a little hanky.\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of clean-up and aftercare when Winter\u2019s celebrating his birthday,\u201d Bucky informed him. \u201cWe agreed that it\u2019s the one time a year when I don\u2019t get a say over what he does, where, or for how long, and I give him the gift of my discomfort and confusion while picking up\u2026 all of this. Seriously, why is the waffle maker here? What the fuck did he do with the waffle maker?\u201d\n\u201cHe made waffles,\u201d Tony replied with an laconic grin. \u201cAnd then he ate them off of me. Even super soldiers need to refuel every once in a while.\u201d\nBucky sighed, but he dutifully set the waffle maker aside for cleaning. He very pointedly kept it separate from the other items he was collecting.\n\u201cAlright, come on old man,\u201d Bucky urged after FRIDAY notified them that the bath had finished filling. He moved onto the bed, carefully pulling the sheets away from Tony and lifting him from the bed in order to carry him to the bathroom.\nBucky paid for the \"old man\" comment when his knee landed firmly in a large spot of syrup and lube which had smeared together on the bed sheets during Winter\u2019s time with Tony. The sound of disgust he made as he realized what had happened would doubtlessly become Winter\u2019s ringtone in the near future.\nIt was several hours, a long bath, and a deep tissue massage from Bucky before Tony felt somewhat human again. Bucky was kind enough to change the sheets on the bed before returning Tony to the mattress, and then Bucky served him dinner.\nTony was checking his email and texts - holy crap, was it actually Saturday now? Already?\nHe was about to lift a bite of perfectly cooked steak to his mouth when he realized that Bucky wasn\u2019t reading next to him, like Tony thought, but was speculatively eyeing him instead.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking of how I\u2019m going to top Winter\u2019s performance when it\u2019s my birthday,\u201d he revealed.\nAt this, Tony gave a loud, dramatic groan. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, \u201cplease do not talk to me about sex for at least a week. Even then, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be up for more than a quickie hand job, Buck. Winter did not go easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019ll have six months to recover before it\u2019s my turn, then,\u201d Bucky reminded him with a cheeky grin.\nBlinking, Tony opened the calendar on his phone and realized that yes, Winter had very conveniently chosen a birthday for himself which was smack dab on the opposite side of the year from Bucky\u2019s.\n\u201cYou two are planning to kill me,\u201d Tony realized.\n\u201cSlowly,\u201d Bucky agreed. \u201cVery, very slowly, over an extended period of time. It will take years, decades even. Just wait until you see what we\u2019ve got planned for your birthday.\u201d\nWhen Tony\u2019s response was to stare at Bucky with wide eyes and his mouth hanging open, Bucky treated him to a gentle, fond smile as he took Tony's hand and pushed at it until the forkful of food Tony held was guided into his mouth.\n\u201cEat,\u201d Bucky commanded. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to keep your strength up.\u201d\n\u201cI may or may not have a concussion,\u201d Tony reported as the battle came to a close. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell through the adrenaline.\u201d\n\u201cWanda, Scott, can you two start helping with cleanup and move debris?\u201d Steve called. \u201cEverett says they evacuated the building, but they\u2019re not sure everyone got out. Tony?\u201d\n\u201cThe suit\u2019s picking up on several life forms - it looks like some people made it into a shelter in the basement and they'll need to be dug out. Thank you, New York City building code, for making bunkers mandatory in populous areas of the city. Best public safety project ever,\u201d Tony gleefully reported as he finished scanning the destruction and determined there were survivors within before flying down to meet with the rest of the Avengers.\nEverett Ross, the team's new handler and UN affiliate, was waiting for them.\n\u201cStark, they want you to take a look at the weapons used in today's attack,\u201d the man immediately began.\n\u201cThose may have been weapons, but those were not Earth weapons,\u201d Tony immediately argued. \u201cYou might want to call Spider-Guy on this one, actually. He has way more experience with this salvaged knock-off bullshit than we do.\u201d\n\u201cRegardless,\u201d Ross began to press, his eyes narrowed.\n\u201cHave Strange and Vision take a look at the weapons while waiting for Spider-Man to arrive,\u201d Bucky commanded as he came up beside Tony. \u201cBabe, you okay? Are you sure you don\u2019t have a concussion?\u201d\n\u201cLooking good, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY said as she finished preforming her own scans of Tony.\n\u201cIf the weapons were salvaged, like you say,\u201d Ross continued, \u201cthen we need your help to determine from where. There are already reporters gathered at the edge of the barrier asking questions-\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t paying attention to Ross, because Bucky was struggling to release the manual latches which allowed Tony\u2019s helmet to detach from the rest of the suit. As soon as the helmet had been removed, Bucky\u2019s hand gently trailed through Tony\u2019s hair and over his scalp, causing Tony to hiss when the other man\u2019s fingers prodded at the nasty bump forming on his head.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Bucky murmured before pressing a quick kiss to Tony\u2019s lips in apology.\n\u201cInappropriate,\u201d Steve muttered.\n\u201cFuck off, Stevie,\u201d Bucky hummed as he moved to continue his examination. \u201cIf I want to reaffirm my man\u2019s continued survival with a little mouth-to-mouth, that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but mine.\u201d\n\u201cThere are reporters and civilians gathering,\u201d Steve argued. \u201cEverybody needs to remain professional.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we need to move quickly, before the vultures start coming up with their own answers to their questions,\u201d Ross pressed.\nTaking a deep breath, Bucky turned to the others and said, \u201cYou know what? Tony\u2019s hurt. And if I don\u2019t finish checking him out, Winter might show up to get the job done his own self, and his methods will ensure it gets done quickly and efficiently.\u201d The last words sounded like a threat.\n\u201cUgh, gross,\u201d Rhodey muttered.\nSighing, Steve squared his shoulders and decided, \u201cDr. Strange, Ant-Man, you two go and take a look at those weapons. Nat, see if you can get anything out of the men we captured. Wanda, Clint, Rhodey, you work on rescuing those people from the bunker. Sam, Vision, you two are on parana duty today.\u201d\nSam groaned as he looked to the line of reporters which was gathering at the barricade.\n\u201cOn one condition,\u201d Wanda put in.\nSteve turned to her with a raised eyebrow, because not helping the stranded civilians wasn\u2019t an option. Wanda, however, was looking at Tony and Bucky. \u201cIf you two get to run off and play Nurse Bucky while the rest of us deal with this cleanup, then next time Vision or I so much as break a nail during battle, you two have to cover for us.\u201d\n\u201cDone deal,\u201d Tony instantly agreed.\nTaking a bit of the brunt weight next time would be worth it if he and his guy got to shirk their responsibilities for a bit of role play today. Tony would make sure that the memories of this day would be so fucking amazing that after the next battle, when he was helping with clean up, or talking bureaucracy with the Accords Committee, or standing in front of the press, a genuine smile would still be stretched across his lips as he faced them down."
