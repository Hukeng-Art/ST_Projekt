    "text": "Becket Singers isn\u2019t necessarily a new intern to Stark Industries Research and Development department, but he hasn\u2019t been here as long as the singing roomba has.\nBecket hasn\u2019t worked in a lot of companies. He\u2019s only a junior at MIT with a background in chemistry. He finished his honors thesis on organometallic compounds by sophomore year and wanted something a little more challenging for the summer. He\u2019s got grad school in his future\u2014of course, because in this day and age it\u2019s very hard to get a decent paying job in STEM without getting some sort of graduate degree\u2014and while his research already looks fantastic on his resume, there\u2019s nothing quite as fantastic as Stark Industries Intern (even if only for a summer semester).\nWhere was his point in this? Oh, right. So, Becket hasn\u2019t worked at a lot of companies, but even he thinks the roomba that follows his boss and plays Mmm Whatcha Say full volume every time Mr. Stark drops something on the ground is more than a little weird. He knows it\u2019s The Roomba and not just a roomba by the printed out stock photo of Mr. Stark\u2019s face that is haphazardly taped to the top.\n(He hadn\u2019t believed it at first, when the other interns told him. He thought it was some sort of hazing ritual to get the new guy to believe whatever dumb bullshit they make up on the spot. Then he saw it with his own eyes and he hasn\u2019t been the same person since.)\nBecket had asked about it exactly once. \u00a0\nHis lab supervisor told him a tale, in a haunting tone, about how the roomba just showed up one day, started following Mr. Stark around and not a single person\u2014in all of the brilliance that is the SI staff\u2014could get rid of it. Apparently, once, they\u2019d tried throwing it down the garbage shoot, never to be seen again. Only for a new and better roomba to show up that very next day as if nothing perilous had ever happened to it. If the roomba breaks, it\u2019s fixed by the next morning. If someone destroys it, it comes back even more powerful.\nNo one knows who created it and repairs it and, unfortunately, no one knows why.\nIt\u2019s not the only thing he wonders about. Becket doesn\u2019t know a lot about Tony Stark, but he always wonders why, exactly, a man like Mr. Stark allows a roomba that plays Mmm Whatcha Say whenever he drops something to continue to follow him around a very prestigious building full of business people and researchers from around the world. Becket swears he\u2019s even seen Mr. Stark holding open a door for it, once.\u00a0\n(The other interns call Mr. Stark eccentric. Becket is convinced that he, like everyone else, simply can\u2019t kill the roomba because it\u2019s too powerful for even a man like Mr. Stark.)\u00a0\nBecket won\u2019t ever get the chance to ask, though\u2014perks of being a lowly R&amp;D intern for the inorganics lab is the fact that he\u2019s seen Mr. Stark exactly five times in his two months of being here and most of them were during casual 2am coffee runs on the third floor. A part of him is still convinced that he experienced a mass hallucination based solely on lack of sleep and several hours spent working on stoichiometry.\nLogically, Becket knows the mystery of the singing roomba is going to remain a mystery. It\u2019s not like he has anyone to ask\u2014no one had ever seen the roomba repair guy and lived to tell the tale.\u00a0\nPerhaps that\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s so surprised when walking into the inorganics lab, bright and early at exactly six-forty-five AM, only to see a child crouched in the corner of the room with several empty drink cans, various screwdrivers, and a roomba at his feet.\nTo top off his morning, Becket recognizes the stock photo of his boss taped to the top. This is no mere roomba.\nThe kid, as if sensing him walk in, jerks his head up and meets his eyes. Becket tries to keep his voice even and says slowly, \u201c\u2026What are you doing with that roomba?\u201d\nThe kid freezes, screw driver held in suspension looking akin to a deer in the headlights. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m fixing it?\u201d\nThe roomba makes a sad beeping noise. The kid absentmindedly runs his fingers over the sleek, black side as if it were habit.\n\u201cWhy are you fixing it?\u201d\n\u201cSo it works?\u201d\nIt\u2019s then that Becket comes to a terrifying realization that could rock the very foundation of the SI intern social ladder.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Roomba-Man,\u201d Becket breathes and tries to keep the horrified awe out of his voice. Then, seeing as the kid goes up maybe to his chin, he corrects, \u201cRoomba-Kid.\u201d\nThe kid puffs up like a balloon and says, like he has a lot of practice, \u201cI\u2019m a man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, god,\u201d Becket says and tries not to think about the fact that he\u2019s solved the biggest mystery in the history of SI within just two short months of working here.\n\u201cSorry about crashing in your lab but inorganics had the stuff I needed so,\u201d the kid scratches the back of his head awkwardly then gathers his remains\u2014roomba, screwdrivers, trash, and all\u2014before standing up and heading out. He pauses at the door, turns around and says, \u201cThanks for letting me sit here for a sec and y\u2019know, not screaming for security.\u201d\nBecket never let him do anything but Becket does not say this.\nThen Roomba-Kid is gone, lost in the crowd of people reporting early for work.\nBecket doesn\u2019t try to stop him. Roomba-Kid already holds so much power in his hands so Becket thinks no one can really blame him for being more than a little terrified in his presence. He just holds his lab keys, stares at the same spot, and tries to convince himself that this isn\u2019t all just a weird, coffee-induced dream.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs it turns out, Becket isn\u2019t the only one to notice something strange this morning. It just isn\u2019t until his mandated lunch break that he finds out.\n\u201cAnyone else here seen the kid who ransacked inorganics last night?\u201d Jess says and drops her food on the table before slouching in her seat.\nJess, like Becket, is one of the four interns that work in the inorganics lab. She\u2019s a chemistry major specializing in geochemistry. She\u2019s also senior\u2014a year older than him\u2014who\u2019s been interning here since every summer since her sophomore year. Becket isn\u2019t quite sure how she keeps getting her internship renewed but he hopes, with careful detection work and friendship bribes, that she will (eventually) tell him her secrets.\nThe other two people at the table are John (sophomore, biochem major) and Ryan (junior, chem major working with redox stability and redox reactions). Together, the four of them make up the only interns across the board that were accepted into the undergrad inorganics lab internship.\n\u201cSomeone took stuff from the lab?\u201d Ryan asks.\n\u201cA lot of my tools were missing this morning,\u201d Jess says. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think much of it until I saw who did it and he wouldn\u2019t give them back. Said Mr. Stark needed them which is bullshit because Mr. Stark has his own personal lab full of things I\u2019ve only seen in my wet dreams. I\u2019m gonna go inform the head after lunch.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a sinking feeling in Becket\u2019s stomach because this morning with Roomba-Kid could not be a coincidence. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d\n\u201cAbout yay-high, brown hair, brown eyes, looks like trouble. Probably a middle schooler by vibe alone.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw the Roomba-Kid,\u201d Becket informs her.\n\u201cThe Roomba-Kid,\u201d John repeats, slowly.\nBecket nods. \u201cThe roomba repair guy.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, back up. Wait a sec. We\u2019re talking about the roomba, right? Like, the singing one? The one with Mr. Stark\u2019s face taped to the top?\u201d At everyone\u2019s nods, Ryan continues, \u201cThere\u2019s a roomba repair guy?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Ryan, who do you think keeps replacing the roomba after we get rid of it?\u201d Jess asks.\nRyan purses his lips. \u201cI thought it was just, like, Mr. Stark\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\u201cLike,\u201d John says and is forced to pause. Becket begs every god he knows for Mr. Stark to not be listening in to random intern conversations. \u201cLike a fetish?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, you said it,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cNot me.\u201d\nJess holds her head in her hands. \u201cOh my god, the roomba that plays Mmm Whatcha Say is not Mr. Stark\u2019s fetish.\u201d\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not here to judge kinks\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease shut up,\u201d Jess says. \u201cRyan, I\u2019m actually begging you to shut your mouth. John, don\u2019t encourage him.\u201d\nJohn shrugs then snaps to get their attention. \u201cAnyway, back to the actual important conversation that we were just having\u2014roomba repair man is a kid?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s like twelve years old,\u201d Jess confirms despite the blaringly obvious fact that the kid is definitely much older than twelve. \u201cMaybe a high-schooler. I didn\u2019t exactly ask.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d John says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s whatever,\u201d Jess says. \u201cAs long as Roomba-Kid stops stealing my stuff and doesn\u2019t cause problems, I don\u2019t see a reason to worry about him.\u201d\n(They should have worried about him, Becket thinks much, much later. By god, they should\u2019ve worried.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are three things Becket has learned after working under one Tony Stark.\nThe first, and most important, rule is that unless you hold a lottery ticket in your very hands, you do not\u2014under any circumstances\u2014give Mr. Stark something to hold. Especially if it\u2019s papers. Double especially if it\u2019s papers that are incredibly important and pertain to the future of the company.\nMr. Stark has a way of sniffing those out and avoiding them the most.\nThe second, and still very important, rule is that interns are not allowed anywhere near Mr. Stark\u2019s personal lab. This is due to the incident in \u201912. Becket, unfortunately, does not know what happened during this incident and no one there is currently alive to tell it.\nThe third rule is if one is to even catch a glimpse of Ms. Pepper Potts in any way, shape or form they are not to bother her with anything unless she specifically asks them first. Legend says this rule was created by Mr. Stark himself after a bunch of interns kept harassing her. Becket, personally, thinks that rule is absolute bullshit because Ms. Potts could end a man\u2019s life without a second of hesitation and doesn\u2019t need something as arbitrary as a rule to protect her.\nThere are, of course, minor rules like don\u2019t use dangerous chemistry equipment alone, always double check stoichiometry calculations, and don\u2019t take stuff from the cabinets without informing a lab head first.\nAs long as he follows these rules, Becket knows everything will work out. It\u2019s why rules are made in the first place\u2014to foster peace and create a stable and helpful environment for project development. It\u2019s why, again, he finds himself surprised to see Roomba-Kid arms deep in the chemical cabinet in the inorganics lab.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Becket asks, not for the first time.\nRoomba-Kid doesn\u2019t look nearly as surprised this time around. \u201cOh! Hi. Your name is Becket, right? Ms. Potts was talking about you and the other interns a while back.\u201d\nBecket is going to ignore the implication that Roomba-Kid is on speaking terms with Ms. Potts. He just can\u2019t wrap his head around the very idea at this point in his very confusing, very short life.\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Becket confirms. Then, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right! Mr. Stark locked me out of the lab yesterday for reasons that were not my fault so I\u2019m going to cover Mr. Stark\u2019s lab entirely with sticky notes but I want them to be sticky enough that he can\u2019t just peel them off,\u201d Roomba-Kid says, dead serious. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call them unstickable sticky notes.\u201d\nBecket thinks about questioning it, but stops. The idea of in itself not especially weird\u2014if Roomba-Kid, for whatever reason, has the clearance to be in the lab without FRIDAY tattling on him, then he obviously has permission from someone. Unstickable sticky notes could easily be a cover for a classified project and, well, Becket\u2019s never been one to push.\n\u201cAlright, have fun with that,\u201d he says. \u201cJess says to bring back her tools because you keep losing them and she needs those for her project.\u201d\n\u201cJess is one of the interns in this lab, right?\u201d Roomba-Kid asks and shuts the cabinet. He\u2019s holding a bucket of chemicals with one hand and a stolen hand-crank centrifuge in the other. \u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry. Mr. Stark and I needed it \u2018cause he snapped his on the Mark 78 and I couldn\u2019t find it in the organics lab. He\u2019ll get her a new one. Or get himself a new one. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\nBecket eyes the bucket of chemicals and wonders if this is a good idea. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cAnyways, nice meeting you!\u201d Roomba-Kid says and wanders out of the lab and out of sight. Just like last time, when Becket does go to check, Roomba-Kid is gone with not a single thing to trace him by.\nIt occurs to him later that he never got Roomba-Kid\u2019s name. Then he shrugs because it\u2019s the Roomba-Kid. An eternal mystery of in itself and, well, Becket is more than happy to be as far away from that mystery as possible.\nIt\u2019s not until the next day when he figures out that he\u2019s completely and utterly fucked.\nHe\u2019s in his lab when it happens, googles and gloves on because he\u2019s not an animal. Unfortunately, he never gets to finish his project because his day starts and ends with him accidently overhearing two employees from the engineering sector that were milling about in the inorganics lab for the day.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Someone put sticky notes all in Mr. Stark\u2019s lab so now he\u2019s making us clean them off\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSticky notes? In Mr. Stark\u2019s personal lab?\u201d\n\u201cCrazy, right? I hear they\u2019re hard to get off. Something about the chemical composition allows them to completely adhere to flat surfaces. Everyone\u2019s been trying all morning to clean them up.\u201d\nThe voices gradually fade to the background. Becket stares at his hands.\nOh, Becket thinks. Oh, shit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are four things Becket has learned after working under one Tony Stark.\nThe fourth rule is if the Roomba-Kid says he\u2019s going to do something, you\u2014under every circumstance\u2014must do everything in your power to stop him. Otherwise, overtime is spent unsticking unstickable sticky notes from a billionaire\u2019s personal lab, simultaneously wondering and regretting which life choices led you to this exact, cursed moment in time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been exactly three weeks since the sticky note incident. Becket has look hell in the eyes and hell looks like a rainbow of tiny square papers that stick to just about everything and do not come off without extreme amounts of force (and some fire).\nIt\u2019s alright, though, because after a stunt like that, he knows he won\u2019t be seeing Roomba-Kid around again. Mr. Stark would never allow anyone like that to stay, no matter what circumstances came to them being here in the first place.\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been proven wrong by Roomba-Kid. Still, you can only imagine his surprise when he walks into inorganics only to see Roomba-Kid hard at work once again.\n(No one blames him for turning around and walking right back out.)\nBy this point, Roomba-Kid is more than an urban myth. He\u2019s a tiny demon running around with the power of god at his fingertips. Becket isn\u2019t sure how this kid is still in the R&amp;D department and he\u2019s not completely sure he even wants to find out.\nAlthough, it\u2019s to the point that Roomba-Kid is around enough that most everyone has at least glimpsed his face by now. Not many of them have held a conversation which is evident by the lack of a formal name other than Roomba-Kid, but, well, at least they can prove Roomba-Kid is real and not just a story cooked up by the chemist employees to scare new interns into behaving.\nLunch rolls around and with it comes the bountiful prospect of gossip from the inorganics interns.\n\u201cI think Roomba-Kid is a kind soul but my god he\u2019s a misguided little shit that has entirely too much power for his tiny middle schooler hands,\u201d Jess says as she slides into the table seat.\n\u201cHe\u2019s high school age at least,\u201d Becket says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sophomore,\u201d Ryan drums his fingers on the table, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. When he notices their confused stares, he rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat? I actually talk to him sometimes. He\u2019s weirdly magnetic.\u201d\n\u201cHe helped me carry stuff to the lab,\u201d Jess tells him. \u201cHelped John find some of the chemicals from upstairs and then he turned around and stole another centrifuge from the cabinet. He\u2019s a sweet kid, but I don\u2019t understand him at all.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a badge either. I saw him attempting to bribe the security guard to let him through the doors,\u201d John says.\nBecket holds his face in his hands and offers a muffled, \u201cHow does he even exist?\u201d\n\u201cDoes anyone know like, why, this kid just exists in Stark Industries and no one knows how to get rid of him or..?\u201d\n\"He takes after the very singing roomba he created,\" Becket says.\u00a0\nJess beckons them closer, like out of some crime TV show, and Becket knows he doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with this when she says, \u201cI once asked Mr. Stark if he knew about Roomba-Kid and he said, get this, who? So, y\u2019know, I have a theory\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, god,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201c\u2014I have a theory,\u201d Jess repeats, more forceful. \u201cI think that Roomba-Kid is actually the ghost of a kid who once came on a tour here and died in this very facility. So now he haunts the halls as a form of revenge.\u201d\n\u201cI think that your theory sucks and you should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d \u00a0John says, dryly.\nJess whacks him on the arm and ignores his laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t be fucking rude, John.\u201d\n\u201cI have to agree with John,\u201d Becket says. He ignores the booing. \u201cGhosts can\u2019t fix roombas or stick unstickable sticky notes to Mr. Stark\u2019s personal lab.\u201d\nRyan tries and fails to hide his snickers when he says, \u201cIf we gave a tip to the Buzzfeed Unsolved crew do y\u2019think they\u2019d come out here an investigate?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a ghost,\u201d John says\n\u201cDemon, maybe?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s literally just some random kid.\u201d\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make sense! He fixes the singing roomba and he takes stuff from the labs and no one can stop him and he stuck unstickable sticky notes to Mr. Stark\u2019s private lab and is still allowed in the building!\u201d\nIt\u2019s between the bickering that Becket catches sight of a pair of people out of the corner of his eyes. There should have been nothing remarkable about two people in a busy cafeteria, but Becket takes in the familiar sight of curly hair, brown eyes, and a t-shirt with a science pun on it talking animatedly alongside Actual Anthony Edward Stark and promptly drops his lunch.\nHe gapes for a solid second, seeing but not believing. It definitely doesn\u2019t look like Mr. Stark is forcing the kid to leave given the smiles on both of their faces. If anything, Becket thinks he looks rather proud.\n\u201cSo, uh, Mr. Stark definitely knows Roomba-Kid,\u201d Becket says and discreetly tilts his head in the direction of that level of bullshit.\nThe table goes silent.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jess says. She almost sounds gleeful. \u201cOh my god, he\u2019s not just some random kid. He\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom there, Becket\u2019s life only gets weirder.\n\u201cHave you seen Mr. Stark or Peter around here?\u201d Actual Ms. Pepper Potts asks. Her voice is kind, but there\u2019s a hard edge to it.\nBecket looks into her eyes and only feels absolute respect and a healthy amount of panic because this woman could end his entire life before he could even lift his pinky finger.\nHe\u2019s still kind of overwhelmed being in the mere presence of the woman who single-handedly keeps this company running so all he can do is stutter out, \u201cAh, no ma\u2019am, sorry ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you happen to see either of them do you think you could send them to my office? I have some, ah, issues to discuss with the both of them. Especially Peter. I haven\u2019t seen him around in a while.\u201d\nBecket doesn\u2019t know who Peter is, but he fears for him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecket runs into Mr. Stark another six times in the span of two weeks. Mr. Stark approaches him and has a conversation about his thesis on organometallic compounds. Becket, miraculously, does not pass out during any of these instances and actually manages to sound like the competent undergraduate researcher that he is.\n(That doesn\u2019t stop him from freaking out afterward, though.)\nSightings with Roomba-Kid are increasingly common as well. No one has managed to get his real name, but that\u2019s not from lack of trying on their part. Apparently, Roomba-Kid learned of his nickname and took a liking to it. Becket knows a lot more about him, though\u2014he\u2019s sixteen, a sophomore, goes to Midtown Tech, likes chemistry, likes dorky science puns even more, and, amazingly, is the personal intern of Mr. Stark.\nBecket hadn\u2019t known Mr. Stark even took personal interns.\nSeeing Mr. Stark and Roomba-Kid together, though? It hasn\u2019t happened since that fateful lunch break where Jess called Roomba-Kid Mr. Stark\u2019s son and hasn\u2019t let go of it since. He\u2019s heard the stories, of course, but Mr. Stark is a busy man and Roomba-Kid does\u2026.well, whatever Roomba-Kid does in his free time is not something Becket really wants to know.\nThere\u2019s a knock on the door.\n\u201cNose goes,\u201d Ryan says.\nBecket\u2019s not one for door duty so he\u2019s the second person to put a finger on his nose. Jess is, like always, last. She grumbles and grabs the papers she\u2019s working on but stands up from where she had been lounging at her desk with grace and walks over to the entrance anyways.\nJess opens the door then promptly almost drops the papers she\u2019s holding. \u201cM-Mr. Stark! And, uh, Roomba\u2014I mean, can I help you, sir?\u201d\nBecket\u2019s head snaps up so fast he swears he gets whiplash. There\u2019s a wheezing sound from John and Ryan coughs something that sounds suspiciously like a laugh into the palm of his hand. There, standing in the entrance door to inorganics, is Actual Anthony Edward Stark and Roomba-Kid. Mr. Stark is smiling, hand on Roomba-Kid\u2019s shoulders but Roomba-Kid absolutely does not look like he wants to be here at all which is a stark contrast from all the times Becket and Co have caught him sneaking in and stealing equipment and chemicals.\nThe first thing out of Roomba-Kid\u2019s mouth is, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d Mr. Stark says with all the exasperation one gathers from fathering a sixteen year old. \u201cThis is the inorganics lab, right? Kid, introduce yourself.\u201d\nSaid kid had very obviously been attempting to sneak off when Mr. Stark grabs his arm and yanks him back into the room. Becket has no shame in admitting that he\u2019s gaping. The entire lab is eerily silent. Even the actual employees watch with rapt attention.\nRoomba-Kid bites his lip and crosses his arms. For a moment, Becket wonders if he\u2019ll answer at all. Then, Roomba-Kid says, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d John says like Mr. Stark hadn\u2019t just exposed Roomba-Kid\u2019s secret identity to the entire inorganics department.\nBecket thinks of that conversation with Ms. Pepper Potts not even a week ago and tries to hide his cringe. If Roomba-Kid survived Ms. Potts\u2019 fury, he doubts there\u2019s much else on the planet that can get rid of him at this point. Although, Becket finds that his stomach twists unpleasantly at the thought of Roomba-Kid leaving. It\u2019s as Ryan said; he\u2019s weirdly magnetic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBabysit him,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cI need to go do important superhero things and he likes you guys for some reason.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Roomba-Kid\u2014Peter repeats. Then he whirls around on his heel with a surprising amount of grace and says to Mr. Stark, \u201cLet me come!\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mr. Stark tells Peter. He faces the horrible confused quadruplet of interns as if he isn\u2019t essentially asking them to be an over-qualified babysitter to his son. \u201cPeter is very slippery and very persuasive but I need you guys to keep him in this room until I come and get him.\u201d\nJess still hasn\u2019t taken her hand off the door handle. Ryan has his head in his hands, looking every bit as overwhelmed as Becket feels, and says, \u201cWhat is even going on here?\u201d\n\u201cLet me come, Mr. Stark!\u201d\n\u201cNo. You are going to stay here because I am your boss and I say so.\u201d\n\u201cFire me, then,\u201d Peter says, like a challenge. Becket almost yells because he worked so hard to get here and this kid is just goading to get fired. \u201cFire me right now.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cSuffer.\u201d\nPeter chooses to stick his tongue out, like a mature adult.\n\u201cDo not move. Do not come after me. I\u2019m serious, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cHi serious, I\u2019m dad.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ignoring that,\u201d Mr. Stark says. He turns back to the interns and gives them all a hard look. Becket\u2019s sweating underneath his required white lab coat. \u201cKeep. Him. Here.\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Jess says. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d\nMr. Stark nods once and sends a look at Peter who rolls his eyes. He\u2019s gone and out the door before another word can be uttered or before Peter can attempt to goad his way into being taken on a superhero business trip despite being a sixteen year old high school student.\nPersonal intern, my ass, Becket thinks.\nBecket\u2019s not quite sure what to make of Peter Parker but Peter Parker has no qualms of making everyone out as friends within the next ten minutes of being trapped and imprisoned in an SI lab. He\u2019s also very forthcoming with information\u2014in a grand total of five minutes Becket has learned that Mr. Stark is not, in fact, his dad, that he lives with his aunt, that his best friend is named Ned, that he\u2019s slowly befriending a girl named MJ, and he keeps the roomba running because he thinks of it as both a joke and a challenge. Apparently, the entire disaster started because Mr. Stark thought he couldn\u2019t program a roomba to follow him around considering how much he\u2019s in and out of the SI halls. Peter was the one who went the extra mile and added music whenever Mr. Stark dropped something. Now, Mr. Stark is cursed to have a musical roomba follow him around the halls of SI for all entirety.\nHa. Take that, Mr. Stark. Never underestimate what teenagers will do out of spite.\u00a0\nAs it turns out, keeping Peter from leaving is, in fact, a very hard and very demanding job. Peter tries to sneak out no less than fifteen different times in the first twenty minutes of the lab and the only reason Becket even realizes he left is spot is due to the warning alarm Mr. Stark had personally installed to keep him there.\n\u201cOh my god, are you actually Batman?\u201d John asks and holds Peter under the armpits like a cat to keep him escaping for the umpteenth time. Peter\u2019s feet dangle a couple inches off the ground and he laughs, like the joke is somehow ridiculously funny.\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Peter says then kicks his legs. \u201cPut me down.\u201d\n\u201cBad kid,\u201d Ryan drops him anyways. \u201cI need a squirt bottle or something, man. I don\u2019t want to get fired because you escaped the lab.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stark won\u2019t fire you,\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cHe\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cTo you, maybe,\u201d Jess says. \u201cYou get father-son privileges.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s face turns the color of a cherry tomatoed but he says, like he has a lot of experience, \u201cI already told you, Mr. Stark isn\u2019t my dad.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious! I\u2019ve only know him, like, two years\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat makes it even more suspicious! Where did he even find you? I thought\u2014\"\nBecket takes this time to interrupt, sending an argument before it actually happens. He\u2019d been meaning to ask, anyways, ever since that conversation with Ms. Potts from a week ago. \u201cSo, Peter, did you get in trouble with Ms. Potts?\u201d\nPeter looks at him like he\u2019s grown another head. \u201cWhy would I get in trouble with Ms. Potts?\u201d\n\u201c...Because last time I saw her she said she was looking for you and she, uh, she did look happy.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Don\u2019t worry about that, Ms. Potts loves me,\u201d Peter grins at him. \u201cShe was mad at Mr. Stark \u2018cause Mr. Stark took me out of school last week for, uh, unplanned internship purposes.\u201d\nThey chat and laugh and goof off for the next couple hours. Peter\u2019s thwarted escaping attempts gradually die off as he becomes more comfortable around the group and he\u2019s around and helping with as many chemical equations as can split his attention between. In the end, Mr. Stark comes and picks up his wayward intern long after the sun had set with a thank you and a promise of extra overtime in their next paychecks. Peter leaves without ever stealing a centrifuge or any assortment of chemicals so Becket counts that as a victory.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not every day you learn so much stuff about the elusive Roomba-Kid and his Iron Dad.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter Parker breaks Becket\u2019s list of SI rules and creates new ones just as fast.\nThe most important rule comes right after he spots the two of them in hall. Peter carries a stack of papers that he seems to be trying, unsuccessfully, to Mr. Stark.\nIt\u2019s a losing battle. The first rule and (previously, not that Becket knows it at the time) most important rule is that Mr. Stark will not be handed anything. Especially if that anything consists of papers that are important to the future of Stark Industries. Becket can see the bold Stark Industries letterhead from here.\n\u201cTake them,\u201d Peter says. He follows Mr. Stark around on his heels, poking him every so often with the corner of the packet. Mr. Stark is steadfast in his resolve to ignore his wayward intern.\n\u201cGo put them in my lab,\u201d Mr. Stark says.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t read them if I do that!\u201d Peter says. Mr. Stark pauses, then shrugs as if the accusation isn\u2019t completely baseless. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Ms. Potts if you don\u2019t take these.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck, kid. She\u2019s got years of experience trying and failing to hand me these things.\u201d\nPeter sighs, exasperated, but there\u2019s a smile on his face. The papers are still clutched tightly in his hands. \u201cMr. Stark, hold them.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHold them.\u201d\n\u201cNo, kid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna drop them.\u201d\n\u201cPeter\u2014\"\n\u00a0Peter drops them. The papers start to fall like in slow motion. Becket can only watch as they get closer and closer and closer to the floor.\nThey\u2019re not even stapled, Becket thinks in a growing sort of terror. \u00a0\nMr. Stark catches them. \u201cKid, you are actually going to kill me. You see these grey hairs? That\u2019s because of you, Peter. You\u2019re giving me grey hairs.\u201d\nPeter laughs and gives him a smile that could outshine the sun. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are five rules Becket has learned since starting his internship. Number five is that Peter Parker (alias: Roomba-Kid) is an unstoppable force of nature that no one can squash and fears no god nor man on this earth.\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Jess snaps. \u201cGet your butt off the counter.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s yet again in the inorganics lab, his entire torso in a cabinet that\u2019s a good five feet higher than the tallest countertop. His left arm cradles several different plastic containers of chemicals of various kinds. Apparently, Peter had decided that climbing the countertop to get to the chemical cabinet was a better idea than, say, asking a taller employee to help out. Becket\u2019s pretty sure that violates at least three OSHA violations but he\u2019s no snitch so he shrugs and goes back to work. \u00a0\nPeter smiles at her but doesn\u2019t get down from the countertop. \u201cI\u2019m just grabbing somethings.\u201d \u00a0\nAt least now he has Mr. Stark\u2019s explicit permission for his continued theft. They\u2019ve gotten some pretty awesome upgrades from Mr. Stark, personally, replacing the things that have gone missing. The new self-spinning centrifuge is better than the hand-crank one any day.\n\u201cThe last time you were grabbing chemicals,\u201d Jess says, \u201cYou ended up making the biggest goddamn mess of my entire career.\u201d\nPeter snorts, then tries to hide it as a cough. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\"\nJess cuts him off with an ah, ah noise. \u201cIf you are going to say that you didn\u2019t stick all those sticky notes to Mr. Stark\u2019s lab then you\u2019re talking to the wrong person, bub.\u201d\nBecket shares a look with John and Ryan from the other side of the lab and tries not to think about the many hours spent trying to get those awful sticky notes off every surface known to man. With his approachable appearance and general friendliness, it\u2019s easy to forget that it had been Peter that caused that absolute disaster of an afternoon.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter jumps down from the counter with a surprising amount of grace and puts his acquired chemicals on Becket\u2019s desk. \u201cNo, I mean, I definitely stuck all of those stick notes to his lab. It took hours but, like, that was for science.\u201d\n\u201cFor science,\u201d Ryan repeats.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this\u2014these chemicals aren\u2019t for science?\u201d\nPeter seems to realize he messed up because he freezes. \u201c\u2026Uh, no?\u201d\n\u201cThen what are you even doing with them?\u201d Jess grabs a bottle and reads it. \u201cWhat could a twelve year old possibly need salicylic acid, toluene, and\u2014is that beta hydroxy acid? What could you possibly be making that you would need to mix these for?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sixteen!\u201d Peter huffs. \u201cAnd it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s classified.\u201d\n\u201cClassified,\u201d Becket repeats, miffed. It\u2019s the first time Peter hasn\u2019t openly give them a response to any of their prodding. He\u2019d even told Becket he was going to stick unstickable sticky notes not five weeks ago.\n\u201cVery classified,\u201d Peter says, a little more strongly, but his face is red. \u201cSo classified.\u201d\n\u201cIs it going to blow up?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014? No!\u201d\n\u201cIs it for a prank?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cIs it destructive in any way?\u201d\n\u201cNot if I make it right the first time,\u201d Peter says. He sees the look he\u2019s getting and is quick to wave his hands. \u201cNot dangerous! It\u2019s just sticky. I promise I\u2019m not using it for nefarious purposes and it won\u2019t hurt people.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I guess,\u201d Becket says and eyes the chemicals.\nPeter notices and gathers them all up in his arms. His face is still more than a little flushed but he smiles all the same. \u201cSorry to bother. I\u2019ll just take these and get out of your hair.\u201d\nHe\u2019s out of the lab before any of them can think to stop him. Becket watches him leave with a weird look on his face.\u00a0\n\u201cAnyone else get the feeling that the kid was lying?\u201d he says.\n\u201cLay off,\u201d John tells him. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to tell us then he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s to hoping he doesn\u2019t blow himself up,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201cAs if,\u201d Jess says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seem his work here in the lab. The kid\u2019s a genius.\u201d\nThey never figure out what he was using it for but sometimes Becket catches Peter\u2019s eye and, man, does he ever wonder.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecket\u2019s entire life-centric knowledge comes crashing down on a Tuesday afternoon when a villain looking for a fight crashes straight through Stark Industries.\nIt had been a normal morning, for the most part. The actual employees are in their weekly meeting with the head of the lab. Peter had been working with the four interns in the inorganics lab, helping where he could. As it turns out, the kid is a genius at everything chemistry and engineering. Watching him work really leaves no wonder why Mr. Stark is so invested in this kid, son or not.\nThey were laughing, joking around. Trying to convince Peter to go to their respective colleges\u2014Harvard, Princeton, or MIT? It\u2019s ignited more than one heated debate in the past that had Peter laughing at the ridiculousness of it all.\n(MIT\u2019s absolutely the best. Becket\u2019s not biased in his answer at all.)\u00a0\nThen someone crashes straight through the thousands of windows of the entrance lounge. People scream, alarms blare, and chaos unfolds. The door to the Inorganic lab automatically shuts as a safety precaution, locking all five of them in there. Becket\u2019s on his feet in seconds. But not quite fast enough, he thinks when he takes note of the defensive stance Peter has already adapted.\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2014?\u201d John says. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the alarm system,\u201d Jess says. She grabs Peter\u2019s arm and drags him over to the desk. The other three follow and take cover behind any object they could. \u201cIt means someone bad got into the building. We need to hide and wait until they tell us its safe.\u201d\nThe look on Peter\u2019s face tells Becket that he\u2019s absolutely not happy with this situation. He keeps glancing at the door, then back at Jess\u2019s hand on his arm like he wants to take off but doesn\u2019t quite know how. He\u2019s probably overwhelmed\u2014Becket knows he definitely is in this situation\u2014but running won\u2019t do him any good when they\u2019ve already got a perfectly good hiding spot in here.\nThey wait in silence for what seems like forever\u2014minutes tick by in slow succession. The crashing sounds outside of the building gradually decrease but the alarms never once go silent. Then, all of a sudden, the building in plunged into darkness. The alarms stop. The halls fall into complete silence.\n\u201cIs it over?\u201d Becket asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jess says. \u201cIf it was safe, they would\u2019ve said something. The power wouldn\u2019t have just cut off like that.\u201d\nHe knew, when he first took this position, that there had always been some risk. New York is a known hotspot for all things supervillain and working for the Iron Man paints a big fat target on their building. It doesn\u2019t help the jarring terror that makes its way through his system and the sudden realization that this is actually happening. No longer is Super Villain Attacks just some story he read about in the daily newspaper\u2014he\u2019s living it. And he definitely doesn\u2019t like it.\n\u201cWell, this is awful,\u201d Ryan says and fails to keep the tremble out of his voice.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Peter says, voice barely above a whisper. He\u2019s staring intensely at the door, hands curled so tight into fists that his knuckles are white. \u201cDo you guys hear that?\u201d\nAt first, he doesn\u2019t. Peter doesn\u2019t take his eyes off the door, though, and his intensity doesn\u2019t waiver either. Becket strains his ears for a couple seconds, not hearing anything but their own breathing, just as a sound catches his attention from outside the door.\nFootsteps. His heart skips a beat. His stomach clenches in terror.\n\u201cHide, hide, hide,\u201d a voice says. It\u2019s nasally, but strong. There\u2019s a echoing laugh. \u201cGotta hide before the Iron Man finds me!\u201d\nJess grips Becket\u2019s hand and squeezes it. He pulls her closer, feeling both Ryan and John trying to push themselves as far away from the door as possible. Peter, though\u2014Peter doesn\u2019t back away. If anything, he crouches on the balls of his feet, eyes narrowed, and leans forward. It\u2019s like he can hear something they can\u2019t or, better yet, knows something they don\u2019t.\nHe\u2019s never seen that look of absolute concentration on Peter\u2019s face before. If there hadn\u2019t been an actual supervillain loose in the SI R&amp;D departments, Becket might have been a little intimidated.\nThe footsteps get louder and louder until they\u2019re right outside the door. Someone bangs on the outside so loud that all four of the interns flinch. Peter still hasn\u2019t moved from his crouched position, like he\u2019s ready to spring to his feet in seconds.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Jess hisses, quietly. \u201cPeter, get over here.\u201d\nPeter glances back at her, once, then turns his attention back to the door. Jess looks like she\u2019s about to yank him back again, but then the door makes a horrible grinding noise\nBecket\u2019s heart stops as a man steps through. Dressed in a trench coat, a fedora, and black shoes, the man looks almost like a traditional mobster. He might have even passed as a normal, albeit weirdly dressed, man if it hadn\u2019t been for the strange black goo that dripped from his black eyes, shoulders and fingertips.\nHe steps further into the room and Becket can tell the exact second the man spots them\u2014after all, it\u2019s not like a chemistry lab has a lot of places to hide. The man smiles, teeth black, and more goo drips from his open mouth.\nBecket\u2019s heart stops.\n\u201cHello, hello, hello,\u201d the man says. His voice echoes. \u201cWhat do we have here? Children?\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Ryan mutters.\n\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry,\u201d the man says. \u201cI need a hiding place, you see. Iron Man is coming and I haven\u2019t achieved my goal. I can\u2019t afford any witnesses.\u201d\nJohn makes a choked sound. Peter is on his feet in an instant, looking ready to pounce. Before anyone can make a move otherwise, Jess jumps up, grabs an opened bottle off the desks they had been working on before this all went down, and promptly throws acid in his face.\nThe man howls, spitting. Black goo flies everywhere. It almost lands on Becket, but he finds himself being yanked away at the last second. When he looks up, Peter is standing above him. It\u2019s like Becket\u2019s looking at a completely different person. No longer is this the awkward, friendly, sixteen year old intern that likes to make science puns and prank the entire chemistry department. Now, Peter stands tall and proud. His face is set in a determined line. He meets Becket\u2019s eyes and looks at his face, almost as if he\u2019s searching for something.\nCan I trust you? the look seems to say.\u00a0\nPeter must find his answer\u2014whatever it is\u2014because he looks away and smiles at the villain. He snatches another bottle from the desk and throws it with deadly accuracy. It hits the man right in the eyes. \u201cHey, ugly!\u201d\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Ryan snaps, trying to bring the kid back behind the safety of the desks.\nPeter dances around his arms and gives him a much more friendly smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I got this. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nBecket almost believes it.\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re sixteen,\u201d Ryan says right back.\nThe villain spits and roars, like an animal. Black goo comes pouring out of his mouth and eyes and an assortment of acid drips down his face. His solid black gaze locks on with Peter\u2019s and he hisses out, \u201cYou.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d Peter says, cheerfully despite the situation. The man looks like he\u2019s about to respond, but the liquid from the bottles drip into his mouth and he chokes. \u201cOh, sorry. Acid got your tongue?\u201d\nThe man roars, again, and charges. Peter flips a desk on its side like it weighs nothing and sends it into the man\u2019s knees in one smooth action. He wastes no time running forward and launching over the desk, careful to avoid the black goo, and kicks the man so hard he goes flying back into the door.\nBecket\u2019s sure his jaw is on the ground. From the frantic look his fellow interns are sending him, he\u2019s not the only one surprised at this new development.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d John says.\n\u201cHere, let me help you,\u201d Peter says and flips the desk so it lands on the man\u2019s back. The man grunts and groans before yelling. The goo explodes outward, the desk splinters, and Peter is pushed back so violently that he skids all the way back to where Becket, Jess, Ryan and John are cowering behind the ruined, goo-covered desk.\n\u201cHey, watch it, venom-imposter!\u201d Peter says, already having recovered. \u201cThis is my favorite shirt!\u201d\n\u201cChild, child, child,\u201d the man says. Black liquid drips down his fingers. \u201cThis would be significantly less painful if you were to stop resisting.\u201d\n\u201cThe goo thing and the death threats are getting kinda old, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry,\u201d the man says. He takes a dangerous step forward. Becket does not like the way his eyes seem to glow in the eerily darkness of the chemistry lab. \u201cAllow me to make it better.\u201d\nThe man flings his hand forward. Goo comes off and solidifies into spikes. Becket takes cover behind the desk, almost missing the skillful way that Peter dodges every single spike. They imbed themselves in the wall behind them.\nPeter glances once at the black goo on the man\u2019s fingers and once at the solid black spikes in the wall behind him.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d is all Peter says. Then he launches himself at the villain, tackling him to the ground. The villain grabs his shirt, yanking, but Peter flips them both over and kicks out. The man grunts, taking a hit to the stomach and another to the shoulder. \u201cSerious, dude, do you even have a badge? If you don\u2019t, I can talk to Happy about getting you a visitors pass since you really wanted to visit\u2014whoa!\u201d\nThe villain manages to get a grip and sends Peter flying into a pair of desks. Peter yelps, but pushes himself out of the way right as the villain jumps at him. He manages to avoid a nasty hit to the head and skitters just out of reach. He rubs his wrists almost unconsciously and mutters, just loud enough for Becket to hear, \u201cOf all the days not to be wearing my webshooters\u2026\u201d\nAnd Becket? Becket doesn\u2019t quite know how to feel about that.\nThe man stalks forward, shoulders hunched. \u201cYou know, you know, you know\u2026It is not wise to make a dangerous man look foolish, boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need my help for that,\u201d Peter says. \u201cHave you looked in a mirror lately, by chance?\u201d\nThe man spits. Both of them clash again. Becket sees the black goo from the villain and Peter\u2019s once-white shirt as they trade blows and attacks like this is just another Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cCan someone,\u201d John whispers from beside him. \u201cCan someone please tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nRyan laughs, but it sounds wet. \u201cBold of you to assume any of us know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cApparently, Peter has more than a few hidden skills,\u201d Jess says, which is just about the understatement of the century.\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d the man roars.\nBecket turns around in just enough time to see the man fling more hardened goo at Peter. It covers almost the entire area\u2014too thick for Peter to dodge. A yell catches in his throat and he stands, unsure of what to do but unwilling for this kid\u2014this kid who\u2019s been protecting them to get hurt\u2014when Peter jumps.\nThe hardened goo hits the further wall with a bang! Peter doesn\u2019t come back down.\n\u201cBreaking into Stark Industries in broad daylight, trying to hide from Iron Man, attacking us,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice says. Becket looks up. \u201cAlso have you seen your outfit? Seriously, dude, it\u2019s not the 60s anymore.\u201d\nPeter stares down at them. His fingers stick to the surface and he crawls along the ceiling, just like a\u2026just like a spider.\nSpider-Man.\nIt makes total sense while also making absolutely no sense at all.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jess whispers.\n\u201cWhat, what\u2014?\u201d the man doesn\u2019t even get to the third what when Peter drops from the ceiling and lands on the man\u2019s back. He pulls them both to the ground and the man\u2019s head makes a solid crack on the hard floor of the lab. Peter grabs both of his arms and pins them behind the man\u2019s head.\nThey wait with baited breath for one second, two, three, but the man doesn\u2019t get back up. He doesn\u2019t even stir. Becket lets out a sigh of relief he hadn\u2019t known he was holding in.\n\u201cIs he\u2026?\u201d John asks.\nPeter stands on two feet. Becket can\u2019t help but look at him in a whole different light\u2014it\u2019s hard to believe that the kid spending most of his free time running around SI and making roombas is the crime-fighting vigilante dressed in a spider-costume and beating up baddies.\nBecket even has a picture hanging up in his bedroom. He feels faint, almost.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Peter says. \u201cNasty headache, though.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, okay. Cool,\u201d John says. \u201cSo, uh, what the fuck?\u201d\nThey find themselves crowding around him. Jess says, \u201cYou\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s face is cherry-red and he rubs the back of his neck sheepishly but nods all the same. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god. Oh my god,\u201d Jess says. \u201cSpider-Man is a twelve year old who spends his time tormenting Tony Stark and blowing up labs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not exactly inaccurate.\n\u201cI\u2019m sixteen,\u201d he protests. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never blown up a lab!\u201d\n\u201cPurposely, maybe,\u201d Ryan says but there\u2019s a smile on his face.\nPeter relaxes just the barest amount. Then tenses up again like an unbidding thought came to mind. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna\u2014you\u2019re not gonna tell anyone, right? \u2018Cause, uh, I have a lot of enemies and I\u2014\"\nIt\u2019s then that he realizes just how much is on the line in Peter\u2019s life. Becket always thought of Spider-Man as this otherworldly figure\u2014untouchable, eternal. Up there in terms of Tony Stark and the Avengers. Knowing that Spider-Man is a real person, a kid nonetheless with a family and friends\u2026He\u2019s unwillingly trusting the four of them with more than just his own life. All because he had to choose between saving their life or keeping his secret.\nPeter must be terrified.\n\u201cRelax, kid,\u201d Becket says. Jess, Ryan, and John give him pats on the back or encouraging smiles. \u201cYour secret is safe with us.\u201d\nPeter meets his eyes. The tension melts out of him like a popped balloon. Out loud, he simply says, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d a new voice says from the door. \u201cThis is rather unexpected.\u201d\nBecket turns, half expecting more villain accomplices but is entirely welcoming of Tony Stark striding through the doorway.\nHe doesn\u2019t have his suit on, but he takes in the carnage of the room with a critical eye. Ruined desks, spilled chemicals, and black goo are scattered throughout the room. The unconscious body of the villain who attacked them lies in the far corner, as far away from the rest of them as possible.\nPeter waves. \u201cHi, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nMr. Stark gives them all a once over, like he\u2019s checking for injuries, before he pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have waited?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\" Peter says and doesn't sound a single bit sorry about it. \"But to be fair, he attacked first.\"\n\u201cPeter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlso, his goo? Disgusting,\u201d Peter plows on like he hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cI\u2019m almost glad I didn\u2019t have the suit, Mr. Stark, because I\u2019d be picking this stuff out for weeks\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Mr. Stark says, more forceful. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cOh. No, uh, I\u2019m good,\u201d Peter says. He glances down at his body, checks his limbs, and then shrugs. He looks back over at the interns. \u201cIs everyone else okay too?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201cThanks to you,\u201d John adds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d Peter awkwardly rubs the back of his neck. Nervous habit, Becket notes.\nMr. Stark sizes them all up, eyes guarded. Despite being rather small for a man, Tony Stark is nonetheless an intimidating presence to behold.\nMr. Stark places a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI take it that this will not be leaked?\u201d\nBecker blames it on the adrenaline when Ryan blurts out, \u201cBro, no one would actually believe us if we said that Spider-Man was a sixteen year old who spends his free time causing chaos and making roombas anyways.\u201d\nRyan immediately slaps a hand over his mouth, cheeks turning red. Becket sighs, Jess laughs. John looks so completely lost that he isn\u2019t quite sure how he should react. There\u2019s just the barest hint of a smile on Mr. Stark\u2019s face. Peter has the decency to hide his snort behind his hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be signing NDAs anyways,\u201d Mr. Stark says but there\u2019s something of a smile on his face.\nJess nods and says, \u201cOf course, Mr. Stark, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Mr. Stark continues, \u201cIf you ever wanted to come back here for another summer, the program would be lucky to have you. If you wanted something more permeant\u2026I think we could arrange that as well.\u201d\nWell. Becket knows a bribe when he sees one. The funny part? He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019ll absolutely take a job at SI anyway for keeping a secret he\u2019s already planning on keeping. One look at the other interns tells him they\u2019re all thinking along the same lines.\n\u201cCan we ask questions?\u201d John asks. When Peter and Mr. Stark nod, he goes on, \u201cSo, your internship?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually an internship,\u201d Peter says and smiles. \u201cSpider-Man is the internship. Mr. Stark is kinda my sponsor?\u201d\n\u201cYou basically live in my house on the weekends,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cThat\u2019s a mentor, kid,\u201d\n\u201cDad, sometimes,\u201d Peter tells them. Jess sends them all a vindictive look. \u201cBut mostly if I\u2019m here, I just mess with my suit or the Iron Man suits. Then I started coming down and hanging out with you guys \u2018cause you were always fun.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve touched the Iron Man suit,\u201d Ryan says with reverence.\n\u201cI\u2019m still working on getting Mr. Stark to let me take it for a test flight,\u201d Peter tells them brightly. \u201cI\u2019ll get him eventually.\u201d\n\u201cYou actually won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Stark says.\nThey laugh and talk and question for the next few hours. The sun has long since set, the police have gathered their statement. They leave with the promise of a better future and more information tomorrow morning. Peter and Mr. Stark are right there, making sure they get home safely.\nThroughout it all, Peter never once apologizes for not telling them\u2014Becket thinks, had this whole thing never happened, Peter never would have told them. Becket would have graduated his SI internship, gone home, got his degree, created his life, and never once known that he spent a summer getting to know the Spider-Man of New York City.\nIt\u2019s a humbling thought.\nTomorrow, he\u2019ll go back to the labs. He\u2019ll help with cleanup. He\u2019ll pass Peter in the hallways and say hello. He\u2019ll continue his research. The singing roomba will still follow Mr. Stark around. Peter will probably end up stealing more chemicals. Jess will gossip at lunch. Ryan will joke around. John will act as the voice of reason.\nBecket will go home that night thinking about his entire world has changed, yet it seems almost nothing has changed at all.\n\u00a0"
