    "text": "\u201cSo I was having a pretty good morning,\u201d Stiles says without preamble as he throws himself down in the chair across from Lydia, a scowl on his face. \u201cIn fact, I was having an excellent morning.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d Lydia asks, her tone bored, not bothering to look up from the paper she\u2019s grading, blood red pen in hand.\n\u201cBut then I found out that all but five of my Bio 424 students transferred out of the class last minute,\u201d Stiles bitches, throwing his hands up in the air and slumping back in his chair. \u201cAll but five, Lydia. Five. I had to cancel it.\u201d\n\u201cThey transferred out of your class?\u201d Lydia questions, looking up, her interest piqued.\nStiles can\u2019t help but preen at that a little bit, because he knows he\u2019s a good teacher, okay? He\u2019s young and enthusiastic and can remember names like a boss. Also, epigenetics is kickass, so really there\u2019s absolutely no reason for any of his students to transfer out of his class, much less over eighty percent of them.\n\u201cYou said this was your Bio 424 course?\u201d Lydia continues, a contemplative look on her face as she taps her pen against her perfectly painted lips. \u201cMonday, Wednesday, and Friday at eight am?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles answers, eyeing Lydia suspiciously. She clearly knows something he doesn\u2019t on the matter.\n\u201cWhen was the last time you dropped by the English department?\u201d she asks, a dangerous smile spreading over her face \u2013 the sort of which terrifies and arouses Stiles in equal measure.\n\u201cI dunno. Why?\u201d Stiles replies warily, frowning. It\u2019s a fairly strange question, after all.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new addition to the staff who has a class at the same time as your Bio 424,\u201d Lydia answers, as if that explanation should solve everything. If she\u2019d been teaching a class at the same time as him, he could understand people transferring into her class, but all of his bio students transferring into an English course? Clearly Lydia hasn\u2019t had quite enough coffee yet this morning.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that relevant?\u201d Stiles asks, his brow furrowing in confusion, nose wrinkling in distaste.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll have to go see for yourself,\u201d Lydia replies, that dangerous glint still shining in her eyes, an amused smirk curling her lips. \u201cI believe the class is in room 240 in the SEC.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Stiles questions, because, really, this whole thing is just getting more and more confusing.\n\u201cI may have sat in on the class this morning,\u201d Lydia admits, although she sounds inordinately pleased instead of embarrassed or guilty. \u201cNot exactly my type, but I can see why your students would transfer.\u201d\n\u201cThe class wasn\u2019t your type?\u201d Stiles asks, still completely lost.\n\u201cJust check it out,\u201d Lydia sighs, doing that thing where she rolls her eyes at him without ever actually rolling her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me later.\u201d\nStiles lets out an annoyed huff, but doesn\u2019t try to wheedle any more information out of Lydia \u2013 it\u2019s a useless endeavor if there ever was one. Their conversation devolves from there, Stiles nodding along understandingly as Lydia complains about particularly idiotic students. Somehow she\u2019d gotten stuck teaching a section of Intro Bio, which Stiles really doesn\u2019t envy. There are, what, two to three hundred students per section?\nHe doesn\u2019t forget about the mysterious English class, though, which is why, instead of sleeping comfortably in his apartment, he finds himself wandering aimlessly around the Sheppard English Center at seven forty-five the next morning, trying to remember which room Lydia had said the class was in. It\u2019s somewhere on the second floor, he knows, but \u2013\n\u201cYou look lost,\u201d a voice says, nearly startling Stiles out of his skin.\nHe whirls around, an answer on the tip of his tongue, but his mind goes blank as soon as he lays eyes on his savior. Because, hot damn, he needs to get lost more often if it means that this guy is going to help him out. Stiles licks his lower lip and tries to figure out what to say.\n\u201cForgot the classroom number,\u201d is what he finally settles on, shooting the guy his most charming smile. God, he hopes the dude\u2019s into nerdy-looking geneticists. Stiles doesn\u2019t recognize him, but he looks too old to be a student. A new lecturer, maybe?\n\u201cWhat class is it?\u201d Hot Guy asks, sounding a little annoyed and less than charmed, much to Stiles\u2019 disappointment.\n\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says, blushing as he realizes that he doesn\u2019t actually know. \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure. I know it starts at eight and that it\u2019s taught by a new prof.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know the course name?\u201d the guy asks, making Stiles wince a little, because okay, maybe he should have looked it up in the course guide, but he was a little preoccupied with informing his remaining Bio 424 students that the class had been cancelled. He then had to figure out how to shift the course over to next semester and rework his entire research schedule to accommodate the time loss. His winter semester is going to be so hectic.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been a little busy lately \u2013 sue me,\u201d Stiles huffs, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cNow do you know what class I\u2019m talking about, or should I just continue awkwardly checking every freaking room on this floor?\u201d\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d the guy says, and, wow, Stiles thought that Lydia was the only one capable of doing that \u2018rolling your eyes but not actually rolling your eyes\u2019 thing. Maybe it\u2019s just a thing all hot people are innately capable of. Or maybe they\u2019ve developed it specifically to show their disdain of him.\nStiles, on the other hand, has no problem with actually rolling his eyes. He does follow, though, only because the class is going to start relatively soon and he knows how annoying it can be to have people barging into your class late when you\u2019re trying to teach. The room Hot Guy leads him to is actually more of a classroom than a lecture hall, which, he supposes, shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising, considering the type of class this is.\nWhat is surprising, though, is how packed it is. In fact, Stiles ends up having to stand awkwardly in the back of the room because all of the desks are taken. Really, what could be so amazing about \u2013\n\u201cFor those of you who just transferred into this class or simply decided that day one wasn\u2019t important enough to attend, I\u2019m Professor Hale,\u201d Hot Guy announces, moving to stand at the front of the room, surveying the class with a cool gaze. \u201cWelcome to English 346, The American Novel.\u201d\nOh, wow. Stiles is pretty sure his mouth is hanging open right now and that his eyes are wide with shock, because holy fuck, he thinks he knows why his students transferred. Hell, if he was still an undergrad, he probably would have transferred, too. Sure, the guy \u2013 Professor Hale \u2013 was hot in the hallway, but the tone of voice he\u2019s using right now kind of makes Stiles want to drop to his knees immediately, and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s not the only person in the classroom who feels that way.\n\u201cNow, as you all know from the syllabus, our first text, which you should have already started reading, is Ernest Hemingway\u2019s A Farewell to Arms,\u201d Professor Hale continues, turning to write some basic information about Hemingway on the blackboard behind him. \u201cHemingway was one of the most influential, and arguably one of the greatest, American writers of \u2013 \u201d\nStiles can\u2019t help but let out a snort at that. He just can\u2019t \u2013 not when someone\u2019s calling Hemingway \u201cone of the greatest American writers.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a comment to make, Mr. \u2013 ?\u201d Hale asks, turning around to stare directly at Stiles. Seriously, how the fuck did he even hear that?\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Stiles answers, smiling at Hale a little sharply. \u201cBut I mean, c\u2019mon, Hemingway? Really?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have an issue with Hemingway?\u201d Hale shoots back, quirking an eyebrow at him, obviously unimpressed with his answer.\n\u201cWhat, you mean besides the fact that the dude was basically the phrase \u2018no homo\u2019 personified?\u201d Stiles replies, and for a moment he almost thinks he sees Hale\u2019s lips twitch up into an amused smile. \u201cSeriously, American society could have done without his contributions to sexism and the ideal of hypermasculinity.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that his writing style \u2013 \u201d Hale starts, only to be cut off by a sharp laugh from Stiles.\n\u201cSo the fact that his writing is pretty excuses the societal messages and consequences of his books?\u201d Stiles retorts, unable to help himself from enjoying the way Hale scowls at his words. \u201cThe only worthwhile book is one that actually says something meaningful.\u201d\n\u201cWould you therefore like to discount more than seventy five percent of the world\u2019s literature?\u201d Hale asks, looking at Stiles intently. \u201cIs the Harry Potter series not worth your while?\u201d\n\u201cDude, Harry Potter is about the power of love and families of choice,\u201d Stiles shoots back, narrowing his eyes, because no one insults Harry Potter on his watch, goddamn it. \u201cHemingway just writes about men drinking and women crying.\u201d\n\u201cWell then, Mr. Stiles, I\u2019m sure you can tell me all about how much you hate Hemingway in our subsequent classes, when we really start delving into the book,\u201d Hale replies, his smile all teeth.\nStiles just barely manages to prevent himself from saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s on,\u201d and that\u2019s only because he realizes that three of the students he had in his Bioethics course last semester are staring at him like he\u2019s been replaced by a pod person.\nWhat can he say? It looks like Professor Hale brings out the best in him.\n---\nJust a little over twenty four hours pass before Stiles sees Professor Hale again. Even then, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s intentional. Really, it would be more accurate to say that a little more than twenty four hours pass before Stiles runs into Professor Hale again. Literally.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Stiles squawks as he takes the hallway corner a little too quickly and comes face to face with Hale.\nUnfortunately, Hale looks just as startled as he probably does and before he can slow himself down sufficiently, they\u2019re colliding. The folders that Hale was holding go crashing to the ground, and Stiles nearly follows \u2013 his slim form can\u2019t possibly compete with I\u2019m-a-wall-of-solid-muscle Hale\u2019s. However, before he does a face plant, he feels an arm wrap around his waist, steadying him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says awkwardly, shoving his skewed glasses back up his nose. Fuck, if he\u2019d known he was going to run into Hale today, he would have worn his contacts instead. \u201cNice, uh, save there, Professor Hale.\u201d\n\u201cYou should watch where you\u2019re going, Mr. Stiles,\u201d Hale says after a beat of silence, taking his hand off of Stiles\u2019 waist as quickly as if he\u2019d been burned.\n\u201cJust Stiles,\u201d Stiles blurts out, still staring at Hale, transfixed. \u201cStiles is my first name.\u201d\n\u201cYour parents named you \u2018Stiles\u2019?\u201d Hale asks, his brow furrowing slightly and his frown deepening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nickname,\u201d Stiles explains, cheeks flushing, looking away from Hale and down at where the papers he was carrying are now scattered across the floor. He feels his cheeks heat even more at the mess he\u2019s caused and quickly drops down onto his hands and knees in order to help pick them up.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your actual name, then?\u201d Hale replies, also kneeling in order to gather his papers.\n\u201cA monstrosity that no one\u2019s ears should ever have to bear the burden of hearing,\u201d Stiles quips, pausing as he picks up one of the sheets of paper, pursing his lips as he reads it. \u201cWait, is this seriously your class booklist? Please tell me it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d Hale asks, sounding distinctly annoyed again.\n\u201cDo you seriously see nothing problematic about the fact that all of these texts were written by straight white men?\u201d Stiles shoots back, looking back up at Hale, his expression unimpressed. \u201cI mean, four out of the five are even dead.\u201d\nHale fixes him with an intense, unreadable look, and Stiles is about to flounder for an excuse in order to escape Hale\u2019s wrath, but just as he opens his mouth, Hale smiles.\n\u201cWhat books would you choose?\u201d Hale asks, but his tone isn\u2019t at all combative or defensive, throwing Stiles off guard. \u201cIf you were to design the course.\u201d\nStiles blinks at him, just looks at him for a moment, before averting his eyes and chewing on his bottom lip, considering the question. It\u2019s a difficult one for sure, and Stiles hasn\u2019t had any sort of English class since his sophomore year of college, so it takes a bit of digging for him to come up with an appropriate answer.\n\u201cSomething by Sherman Alexie,\u201d Stiles starts, his lips forming the words slowly as he tries to organize his ideas. \u201cFlight, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cGood choice,\u201d Hale says, a note of approval in his voice that has Stiles suppressing a shiver. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cThe Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison,\u201d Stiles continues, gaining a bit of confidence, enough to look up at Hale again. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest by Ken Kesey.\u201d \n\u201cHappy stories,\u201d Hale snorts, but he he\u2019s still smiling that small smile of his, eyes bright with interest.\n\u201cPlease, like Lolita and Cat\u2019s Cradle are any better,\u201d Stiles scoffs, but he can feel a smile tugging at the corners of his lips, too. \u201cWhat about The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, then? That has a semi-happy ending.\u201d\n\u201cHaddon\u2019s British,\u201d Hale replies, continuing to focus solely on Stiles in that unnerving way of his. \u201cThe course is The American Novel, remember?\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Stiles says, biting his lip again. \u201cUh, well. Fahrenheit 451\u2019s good. Either that or The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d go with The Namesake,\u201d Hale replies, nodding. \u201cIt gives a little more variety, considering how you already have a dystopic novel with One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. And the last one?\u201d\nStiles pauses, studying Hale carefully before deciding what to say.\n\u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d Stiles answers finally, smirking a little bit, his tone dipping just enough to be flirtatious.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a short story,\u201d Hale points out, but Stiles is gratified to notice that his cheeks have turned a little pink. \u201cAnd just for the record, I didn\u2019t choose the course texts.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d Stiles asks, surprised.\n\u201cI accepted the position fairly late and it was easier for me to just use the materials that the previous professor had left,\u201d Hale answers, shrugging before moving to pick up the last two papers off the ground. \u201cIf I ever teach the course again, though, I\u2019m certainly changing a good portion of the material.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I\u2019d have lost all respect for you otherwise,\u201d Stiles says, grinning at Professor Hale as he hands over his armful of papers and they both stand up again. Idly, Stiles wonders how long they were crouched there, discussing literature.\n\u201cYou respect me?\u201d Hale snorts, although he sounds distinctly amused.\n\u201cJust because I respect you a little doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Stiles shoots back, earning him a mild glare from Hale.\n\u201cBrat,\u201d Hale grumbles, shuffling his papers back into order. \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t you have somewhere to be? You seemed like you were in a hurry.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Stiles says, grimacing as he glances at his watch, already slinging his bag over his shoulder. \u201cThanks for reminding me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in class on Friday, Mr. \u2013 ?\u201d Hale calls out as Stiles starts rushing down the hall again.\n\u201cJust call me Stiles!\u201d he yells over his shoulder, sparing one backward glance.\nHe really does have to hurry, though. He\u2019d texted Kira saying that he was coming around to chat for a bit at one twenty-five and it\u2019s already one thirty-six. She has a section of Asian American Lit that she has to teach at two, also, so his timing actually does make a difference.\n\u201cHey Kira,\u201d he greets her, trying to steady his breathing when he finally pokes his head into her office.\n\u201cStiles! I was just about to text you,\u201d she replies, a bright smile on her face as she stands up from her desk to pull him into a hug.\n\u201cSo, how was Japan?\u201d Stiles asks as squeezing her tightly.\n\u201cAmazing, as always,\u201d Kira answers, still beaming as they break apart. \u201cI swear, even though I\u2019ve been four times, each visit feels like something completely new.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, I wish I could go,\u201d Stiles sighs, plopping himself down on the couch in Kira\u2019s office, Kira taking a seat next to him.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019ll be a conference you can go to someday,\u201d Kira says, trying to reassure him. \u201cYou could get the university to pay the airfare then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d probably only get to go to the American Society of Human Genetics\u2019 main conference, and that\u2019s always held either in the US or Canada,\u201d Stiles replies, pouting a little bit.\n\u201cWell, someday when you\u2019re tenured and have enough money saved up, then you can go,\u201d Kira says, leaning over and wrapping an arm around his shoulder, squeezing him a little. \u201cEither that or I\u2019ll, like, save up as many skymiles as possible and use them on you.\u201d\n\u201cAw, thanks, Kira,\u201d Stiles replies, smiling and snuggling up next to her. \u201cSeriously, though, how was it? Did you finally get to Nara?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Nara was amazing,\u201d Kira gushes, cheeks flushing with excitement at the mere memory of the place. \u201cI wish my Japanese was better, though \u2013 I wanted to write haikus to it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such an English professor,\u201d Stiles laughs, bumping his shoulder against Kira\u2019s lightly.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re such a scientist,\u201d Kira shoots back, a wide grin on her face, a teasing spark in her eyes.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ll have you know that I attended an English lecture yesterday!\u201d Stiles protests \u2013 not that he\u2019s actually offended or anything.\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d Kira asks, blinking at him in surprise. \u201cWhich class?\u201d\n\u201cEnglish 346,\u201d Stiles admits, wincing slightly as he begins to regret his impulsive outburst, hoping that Kira doesn\u2019t push too much on the subject.\nShe looks at him for a moment and then smiles knowingly. No such luck, then.\n\u201cDerek teaches that, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she says, clearly amused at his expense.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles repeats, feigning innocence, trying not to think about how his heart rate speeds up a little at finding out Professor Hale\u2019s first name. God, he\u2019s like a student with a crush. He totally could have looked up Hale\u2019s \u2013 Derek\u2019s \u2013 name online, anyway.\n\u201cProfessor Hale,\u201d Kira clarifies, unable to hide her grin anymore. \u201cNew, young, could probably quit academia to become a model, you know.\u201d\n\u201cHe stole my students!\u201d Stiles protests, giving up the pretense of not knowing who she\u2019s talking about. \u201cI had to cancel my Bio 424 class because it was at the same time as his stupid English 346 class and, like, eight percent of my students transferred at the last minute!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Stiles,\u201d Kira replies, the smile slipping off her face, immediately making Stiles feel guilty. \u201cDid you get it moved to next semester, at least?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s going to make my life so much more hectic,\u201d Stiles sighs, because he\u2019s been trying not to think too hard about it (thankfully Derek\u2019s been a fairly good distraction). \u201cI mean, I\u2019m going to be up for tenure soon, and I really hope this doesn\u2019t affect that.\u201d\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like it was your fault,\u201d Kira reassures him, her arm still around his shoulders. \u201cIn fact \u2013 \u201d\nA loud buzzing sound comes from Kira\u2019s phone, cutting her off.\n\u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry, Stiles, but I\u2019ve got to \u2013 \u201d Kira says, checking her phone to find a notice from her calendar, saying that she has a class to teach in ten minutes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll catch up later,\u201d Stiles replies, waving her off. \u201cI have some stuff I need to finish up at the lab anyway. No biggie.\u201d\n\u201cText me, okay?\u201d Kira says, pressing a light kiss to his cheek before rushing out the door.\n\u201cWill do!\u201d Stiles calls after her.\n---\nStiles considers not going to Derek\u2019s class the next morning. Really, there\u2019s no logical reason for him to go. Instead he could sleep in, could get his PCR started early, could leisurely get coffee and text Scott. He could do anything.\nInstead, he finds himself, once again, in Derek Hale\u2019s English 346 class. Where he\u2019s currently arguing with Derek about Hemingway\u2019s latent homosexuality (or lack thereof). What?\n\u201cOkay, so I can agree with the whole frat-boy-like overcompensation thing, but what you\u2019re saying about his portrayal of gender is bullshit,\u201d Stiles protests, leaning against the back wall of the classroom like he did on the first day.\n\u201cWell, in The Garden of Eden \u2013 \u201d Derek starts, but Stiles cuts him off with a loud groan, the sort of which would probably get him failed if he were actually a student. In fact, a few of the actual students in the class do look a little scandalized, except for those who\u2019ve had him as teacher before.\n\u201cOh my god, you actually subjected yourself to that much Hemingway?\u201d Stiles asks, trying not to make a childish gagging expression. \u201cDo you not love yourself?\u201d\n\u201cMr. \u2013 \u201d Derek snaps, cutting himself off with a frustrated look, like he\u2019s sucking on a lemon. \u201cStiles.\u201d\nStiles can\u2019t help but grin cheekily at Derek\u2019s use of his first name.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m just saying. Just because he used the word \u2018androgynous\u2019 once and had a character cross-dress doesn\u2019t technically support your latent homosexuality theory,\u201d Stiles protests, shrugging. \u201cAnd the whole lesbian relationship between Marita and Catherine really just seems like a male gaze thing. I mean, David\u2019s the one who ends up with Marita anyway. So yeah, not really supporting Hemingway\u2019s latent homosexuality.\u201d\nStiles is pretty sure that he hears one of the students mutter, \u201cThere\u2019s more than enough latent homosexuality in this room already.\u201d Stiles has to bite his lip not to laugh. Really, there\u2019s nothing \u201clatent\u201d about it. Also, he\u2019s bisexual, thank you very much.\n\u201cSo you did read The Garden of Eden,\u201d is apparently what Derek decides to reply with, making Stiles scowl and blush a little.\n\u201cOnly, like, half of it,\u201d Stiles snorts, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cEventually I gave up and just read an online summary.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d a tentative voice says, breaking into their conversation. Stiles feels a little sorry for the overwhelmed look that comes across the student\u2019s face as both he and Derek turn their eyes on her. \u201cSo I\u2019m kind of confused. Weren\u2019t we reading A Farewell to Arms? I didn\u2019t get the wrong book, did I?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sorry,\u201d Derek replies, clearing his throat, cheeks a little pink. \u201cA Farewell to Arms.\u201d\nAnd okay, so maybe Stiles is feeling a little guilty about taking away learning opportunities from students. Just a little, though. It\u2019s way too much fun to argue with Derek.\n---\nToday has been going\u2026 well, it\u2019s been going. It\u2019s certainly not the worst day Stiles has ever had, but it\u2019s certainly not the best either. He didn\u2019t go to Derek\u2019s class today and, honestly, he\u2019s feeling a little bad about that. Of course, if he actually went he\u2019d probably feel even worse. He\u2019s taking up time which Derek should be spending on his students, and that\u2019s really a dick move. His desire to get all up in that shouldn\u2019t outweigh a student\u2019s learning opportunity.\nSo, instead he\u2019d gotten an early start in the lab. It\u2019s nice, actually, working there first thing in the morning. The relative quiet before people really start trickling in is sort of comforting. It certainly helps him focus, at least.\nTherefore, as he\u2019s walking out of the lab to go get coffee, he\u2019s in a decent mood, despite having missed Derek\u2019s class. It\u2019s not necessarily a good mood, but he\u2019s feeling pleasant enough.\nWhich is why he hasn\u2019t left this stupid undergrad to fend for himself yet, because really? How many times does he need Stiles to repeat the directions to the chemistry building?\n\u201cOkay, I think I\u2019ve got it now,\u201d the guy says, smiling at Stiles and looking at him in a way that makes his skin crawl just a little bit.\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s really not that hard to find,\u201d Stiles replies, forcing a smile and taking a step back, trying to remember when the guy had gotten so close to him.\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m taking Bio 424 next semester,\u201d the guy continues, gesturing to the course textbook that Stiles is carrying, and oh god, isn\u2019t that just Stiles\u2019 luck? \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you in class. We could, ah, form a study group. You could probably even tutor me. You look like you\u2019re good at biology.\u201d\nWait. What?\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure professors aren\u2019t supposed to tutor individual students,\u201d Stiles says pointedly, trying to tamp down on the flush threatening to cover his cheeks. \u201cYou can ask questions during my office hours, though.\u201d\nThe student blinks at him for a moment, uncomprehending, before turning bright, bright red.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to forget this encounter as long as you are,\u201d Stiles continues, his words pointed, and the student nods a little hastily, at a loss for words. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in my class, then.\u201d\nAs he\u2019s walking away, he\u2019s pretty sure he hears the guy mutter, \u201cHoly shit, Rate My Professor was right.\u201d Stiles is pretty sure he doesn\u2019t want to know.\n(Okay, so maybe he does. Just a little bit. He\u2019ll look it up when he gets home.)\nHe can\u2019t help but let out a put upon sigh, though, his mood dampened. It\u2019s not like this is the first time something like this has happened to him. Really, he should almost be used to it by now. He\u2019s aware that he looks much younger than his twenty-nine years, still gangly and a little baby-faced. Still, it\u2019s always awkward to get hit on by your students, especially if they don\u2019t know that you\u2019re their professor. At least today wasn\u2019t like when he\u2019d first started teaching and a colleague mistook him for a high school student.\nBy the time he arrives at the Starbucks nearest to the center of campus, though, he\u2019s feeling at least a little bit better. Their mochas are his guilty pleasure, even though Lydia always gives him shit about it. Just because she can\u2019t stand anything but that special, high end stuff that she orders from god knows what tropical island doesn\u2019t mean that his palate is that uncultured.\nHe gets up to the counter and doesn\u2019t even have to order, really \u2013 he comes in often enough that pretty much everyone who works there knows that he never fails to get a mocha. So there he is, standing near the drink pickup area and messing around on his phone, when he hears a very familiar voice say, \u201cStiles?\u201d\nOh, shit. Shit, it\u2019s Derek. He quickly runs a hand through his hair, trying to straighten it out so that it doesn\u2019t look like he wandered out of his apartment this morning without brushing it (hint: he did). He\u2019s wearing his glasses again, too, and because he just came from the lab he probably has fucking goggle lines framing his eyes. Fuck, he probably looks like the poster child for \u201cawkward scientist.\u201d He\u2019s not even wearing a nice shirt today.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you in class today,\u201d Derek says, breaking Stiles out of the mildly panicked trance he\u2019s fallen into.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Stiles replies intelligently, blinking at him. \u201cOh! Yeah, I had some lab work that I needed to get done this morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou ditched class for lab work?\u201d Derek asks, sounding surprised and a little disappointed.\n\u201cHey! I didn\u2019t ditch,\u201d Stiles protests, mildly offended by Derek\u2019s word choice. \u201cI can\u2019t ditch a class I\u2019m not actually taking.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well, I suppose that explains why I couldn\u2019t find you on my class roster,\u201d Derek teases. Or, well, he\u2019s probably teasing. His tone isn\u2019t quite right, but that has to be a joke, right? Him being on the class roster?\n\u201cYeah, well, obviously I had to see what all the commotion was about when, like, eighty percent of my Bio 424 class transferred at the last moment,\u201d Stiles replies, shooting Derek a grin. \u201cNot that I can really blame them, now that I know what all the fuss is about.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201d Derek starts, blushing, but then he cuts himself off, pausing for a moment. \u201cClass was quiet without you today.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of people would consider that a good thing,\u201d Stiles snorts, shoving his hands in to his pockets and rocking back on his heels awkwardly, trying to resist the urge to mess with his hair again. \u201cAnd anyway, I don\u2019t want to take away learning opportunities from your actual students. They\u2019ll start talking eventually.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not coming back?\u201d Derek asks, sounding strangely disappointed.\n\u201cAre you really that desperate to continue our argument about Hemingway?\u201d Stiles shoots back, quirking an eyebrow at Derek.\n\u201cContinue? That implies that I didn\u2019t already win,\u201d Derek replies, the corners of his lips twitching up in what\u2019s almost a smile.\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no way you won that,\u201d Stiles says, a rush of something he can\u2019t quite identify swelling in his chest. \u201cHemingway\u2019s a dick and you agree \u2013 you just don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it is,\u201d Derek snorts, sarcasm obvious. \u201cRemind me, which one of us has a PhD in English?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, is liking Hemingway a PhD requirement?\u201d Stiles shoots back, tying not to think too hard about how comfortable their bantering is and how much he\u2019d prefer it if it was happening while they were in a more horizontal position.\n\u201cNo, but acknowledging his contributions to American literature and the art of writing as a whole is,\u201d Derek replies, giving Stiles an unimpressed look.\n\u201cWell, in my opinion, Hemingway can suck it,\u201d Stiles says, sticking his tongue out at Derek. The barista, who he\u2019s pretty sure was in one of his classes last year, openly stares at him. Ugh, sometimes he forgets that, as a university professor, he\u2019s supposed to act like a mature adult.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how your other professors survived having you in their classes,\u201d Derek huffs, although there\u2019s a note of amusement in his voice.\n\u201cYou seem to be holding up pretty well so far,\u201d Stiles replies, his smile softening just a little.\nDerek opens his mouth to reply, but he\u2019s cut off as the barista yells, \u201cGrande mocha for Stiles!\u201d\n\u201cChocolate this early in the morning? Really?\u201d is what Derek ends up saying, his tone clearly judging.\n\u201cOkay, first of all, it\u2019s already ten, so it\u2019s not that early,\u201d Stiles retorts, leveling Derek with his own judging look. \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m not sure what sort of messed up life you\u2019re living, but for your information, it\u2019s always a good time for chocolate.\u201d\nStiles thinks he might hear Derek mutter, \u201cGod, you\u2019re so young,\u201d under his breath. Which, you know, is kind of weird, because Derek can\u2019t be more than a handful of years older than him. He\u2019s about to say as much, when his phone buzzes with a text. He shoots Derek an apologetic look before checking it, cursing softly as he reads it.\n\u201cSorry, but it looks like I have to go,\u201d Stiles says, shoving his phone back into his pocket and grabbing his mocha off the pickup counter. \"Incident in the lab.\"\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Wednesday?\u201d Derek replies, but it\u2019s phrased as a question. In fact, it almost sounds tentative, which isn\u2019t exactly a word Stiles would have thought to associate with Derek Hale.\n\u201cMaybe? I don\u2019t know. It depends on my workload,\u201d Stiles answers, his tone apologetic as he tries not to read too deeply into Derek\u2019s carefully blank expression. \u201cI could stop by during your office hours, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Derek mutters, which really only serves to confuse Stiles more, because why the hell would that not be a good idea?\n\u201cOkaaaaay,\u201d Stiles says, stretching out the word and giving Derek a confused look. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you when I can. Which, you know, might have to be during your office hours.\u201d\nDerek lets out a little huff, but doesn\u2019t argue.\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see you \u2018round, Derek,\u201d Stiles continues, shooting Derek a little smile before turning to leave.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Professor Hale to you!\u201d Derek calls after him, and Stiles just laughs.\n---\n\u201cSo, a little birdie told me that you\u2019ve been hanging around Hale recently,\u201d Lydia says as soon as Stiles walks into her office, nearly making him turn around and walk right back out the door.\n\u201cKira wouldn\u2019t have betrayed me,\u201d Stiles replies, narrowing his eyes at her.\n\u201cNo, but Allison saw you two getting cozy in his office a few days ago,\u201d Lydia retorts, raising one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. \u201cSo spill.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making your girlfriend spy on me?\u201d Stiles asks, trying (probably in vain) to distract her from the situation at hand.\n\u201cShe and Kira were going to lunch together. She just happened to see you,\u201d Lydia replies, making Stiles deflate a little, because, really, Allison\u2019s much sweeter and less devious than her girlfriend and he has a hard time actually believing that she\u2019d intentionally spy on him. Also, getting lunch with Kira would explain why she, as a French Professor, would be in the English building.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who insisted that I check out his class,\u201d Stiles grumbles, plopping himself down in the chair across the desk from her, not bothering to try and deny it anymore. He should know by now that when it comes to Lydia Martin, resistance is futile.\n\u201cHave you at least had sex yet?\u201d she asks, making Stiles gape at her, his cheeks turning pink.\n\u201cLydia!\u201d he squawks, sounding more than a little scandalized. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cPlease, he\u2019s totally your type,\u201d Lydia scoffs, unimpressed with his answer. \u201cYou should make a move already.\u201d\n\u201cLook, he just \u2013 like, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s in my league, okay?\u201d Stiles sighs, sinking further into the plush chair. \u201cI\u2019ve already tried flirting and he doesn\u2019t really reciprocate.\u201d\nHe tries not to feel too disappointed as he admits to it. Really, it\u2019s been nearly a month now, and although he can certainly make Derek blush, Derek\u2019s always quick to shut down his flirting. The blushing probably just means that Derek\u2019s embarrassed on his behalf. Honestly, Stiles should just stop trying if his flirting is so bad it\u2019s giving Derek secondhand embarrassment.\nLydia studies him carefully, lips pressed in a thin line, clearly contemplating something.\n\u201cStiles, what you need is a confidence boost,\u201d she announces, leaning forward and resting her elbows on her desk. \u201cTherefore, you\u2019re coming with Allison and me to the Jungle tonight.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have plans already!\u201d Stiles protests, although really he was just going to marathon The Walking Dead with Scott.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that Kira will be able to find some other way to occupy Scott while we take you out,\u201d Lydia replies, seeing through him easily.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have sex with anyone but Derek right now,\u201d Stiles whines, trying another excuse, no matter how pathetic it makes him sound.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that you need to have sex with anyone,\u201d Lydia says, giving him her \u2018I thought you were smarter than this\u2019 look. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to do tonight is dance, get hot guys to buy you drinks, and maybe even do a little bit of making out, so that you\u2019ll stop your self-deprecating \u2018he\u2019s so out of my league\u2019 bullshit. Then, you\u2019re going to continue flirting with Hale and maybe even ask him out.\u201d\nStiles narrows his eyes at her and considers protesting, because, honestly, the only people who ever hit on him are undergrads (and sometimes grad students) who don\u2019t realize that he\u2019s a professor. Really, when he\u2019d finally ventured onto the \u201cRate My Professors\u201d website that that student who\u2019d been hitting on him had mentioned, he\u2019d been torn between being creeped out and mildly flattered that he\u2019d warranted such a high \u201chotness\u201d rating. In the end, he\u2019d settled on being creeped out. Because apparently the audience he appeals to is seventeen to twenty-two year olds with a teacher/student kink. At this rate he\u2019ll never go on another date.\nChrist, all of his friends are married, engaged, or in a long term relationship, and he\u2019s still desperately single. He might as well go out and start buying cats now.\n\u201cAre you gonna insist on picking out what I wear?\u201d Stiles finally asks, deciding to go for the route of minimal conflict.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says simply, as if her answer should have been obvious. Which, really, it should have been.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he sighs.\nLydia smirks.\n---\nOkay, so Stiles actually kind of likes going to the Jungle most of the time. By now he\u2019s already had a couple of drinks (neither of them bought by him \u2013 hell yeah!) and is starting to loosen up a bit. Of course, the attractive guy grinding up against him is helping with that, too. \nOccasionally he catches a glimpse of bright red hair and dark brown curls from where Lydia and Allison are also dancing, bodies moving together in a way that would be downright distracting if Stiles wasn\u2019t more interested individuals of the male persuasion tonight. (He and Lydia have a deal, okay? He gets to objectify her a little bit when they\u2019re out clubbing as long as she gets to objectify him in return.)\nStiles tips his head back against his dance partner\u2019s chest and lets out a little moan as the guy thrusts his hips forward. In fact, he has half a mind to just forget about Derek right now and let this guy take him home (or hell, even just to the bathroom) when his eyes land on a familiar figure sitting in one of the booths to the side of the dance floor.\nWell. Stiles isn\u2019t entirely sure if this is a horrible coincidence or a god given opportunity.\nHe decides that it\u2019s an opportunity.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, twisting his head to look over at the guy behind him. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna take a break now.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d the guy replies, a mildly disappointed but understanding look on his face. \u201cAny chance I might see you again later?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Stiles answers, an apologetic smile on his face. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s cool,\u201d the guy says, carefully removing his hands from Stiles\u2019 hips and taking a step back. \u201cGo have fun with tall, dark, and broody.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles replies, leaning over to press a light kiss to the guy\u2019s cheek before making his way through the crowd towards Derek.\nFor once, he feels comfortable in his own skin. A lot of that probably has to do with the buzz of alcohol flowing through his system, but, as much as he\u2019s loath to admit it, it also has to do with the fact that Lydia always knows just how to dress him up. Of course, the pants she\u2019s forced him into tonight would be way too impractical if he\u2019d actually come out looking for sex (they take forever to get on and off), but they do wonders for his ass. In fact, he\u2019d be tempted to do a little twirl in front of Derek if it wouldn\u2019t come off as awkward and like he\u2019s trying too hard.\n\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d Stiles says as he slides into the booth across from Derek, making him startle and stare.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek replies, looking a little gobsmacked. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does anyone do at a club?\u201d Stiles asks, an amused smirk on his face as Derek seems to flounder a little.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be talking,\u201d Derek says, his voice strangely strangled, his eyes fixed at some point behind Stiles, like he\u2019s afraid to look anywhere else. Huh. Stiles had certainly never expected Derek to be shy.\n\u201cIs that your way of asking me to dance?\u201d Stiles asks, licking his lips, not missing the way Derek\u2019s eyes are drawn to the movement for a split-second.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Derek replies, his tone a little pained, hands curled into tight fists. \u201cI \u2013 no dancing.\u201d\n\u201cThen let me buy you a drink,\u201d Stiles insists, leaning over the table a little in order to get closer to Derek.\n\u201cI\u2019m the designated driver,\u201d Derek says quickly, much to Stiles\u2019 disappointment.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a coke, then. Something nonalcoholic,\u201d Stiles replies, anxiety twisting in his gut at each rejection.\n\u201cThis is unprofessional,\u201d Derek murmurs after a moment, his voice almost too soft for Stiles to hear over the pounding bass of the music vibrating through the club.\n\u201cPlease, like you\u2019re the first person to do it,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes, making Derek look at him sharply, a shocked expression on his face. \u201cI mean, look at Allison and Lydia. Danny from Comp Sci and I had a thing for a while, too.\u201d\nAt that, Derek seems to look even more scandalized. Seriously? Stiles honestly hadn\u2019t pegged him as someone who\u2019d be that uptight about interdepartmental relationships.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek replies slowly, like he\u2019s talking to an easily spooked animal. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this \u2018Danny\u2019 told you, but \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cDerbear!\u201d a voice yells, startling Stiles as a gorgeous woman suddenly slides into the booth next to Derek. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend here?\u201d\n\u201cLaura,\u201d Derek growls, his tone chock full of warning that the woman \u2013 Laura, apparently \u2013 completely ignores.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m just his sister,\u201d she continues, the tension in Stiles\u2019 shoulders immediately bleeding away at her words. Not that he seriously thought that they were together. The Jungle is a gay club, after all.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Stiles replies, putting on his most charming smile.\n\u201cThe Stiles?\u201d Laura asks, throwing Stiles a little off guard. Her eyes hold a dangerously familiar spark, the sort of which Stiles is used to seeing in Lydia\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to meet you.\u201d \n\u201cYou have?\u201d Stiles asks, extremely confused now.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Laura replies simply, a smirk curling her bright red lips. \u201cYou\u2019re Der\u2019s favorite, after all.\u201d\n\u201cLaura!\u201d Derek snaps, louder now.\n\u201cAw, come on. He\u2019s not even \u2013 \u201d Laura starts, but Derek cuts her off.\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he announces, grabbing onto her upper arm and practically dragging her out of the booth.\n\u201cNice meeting you, Stiles!\u201d Laura calls over her shoulder, giggling a little, probably drunk.\nDerek doesn\u2019t say anything, though, leaving Stiles in his wake, dumfounded. He has half a mind to run after them \u2013 to demand an explanation \u2013 but they\u2019ve disappeared by the time he comes back to his senses. What the fuck was that about?\nHe sighs, rubbing a hand through his slightly sweat-damp hair as he realizes that he\u2019s struck out yet again. Maybe this is just the universe\u2019s way of telling him to back off. Hell, maybe this is Derek\u2019s way of telling him to back off. He stares down at the table morosely and wonders if it\u2019s socially acceptable for him to drink the half-glass of water Derek left behind.\nHe downs it in three gulps before heading back out onto the dance floor and losing himself in the mass of writhing bodies.\nNo one comes home with him, but he can\u2019t say he\u2019s disappointed.\n---\nStiles still attends Derek\u2019s classes, but he doesn\u2019t talk as much. As he\u2019d predicted, some of the other English 346 students have become bolder, offering up interpretations and even challenging some of Derek\u2019s assertions. Of course, there are still plenty who just sit there and drool over Derek, eyes wandering shamelessly. Stiles wants to say he\u2019s not one of them, but he kind of is.\nWhen he actually talks to Derek, though, is during his office hours. He spares as much time as he can for Derek then, although he sometimes can\u2019t get around his other duties, particularly his research.\n\u201cWhat are you working on, anyway?\u201d Derek asks one day after Stiles stumbles into his office, flushed from his sprint across campus in order to make the last fifteen minutes of Derek\u2019s office hours.\n\u201cGenomic imprinting,\u201d Stiles answers casually, sprawling himself out in the chair across from Derek, legs splayed purposefully wide. \u201cIt\u2019s basically when one copy of a certain gene is turned off during fetal development. You know, because you get two copies of each gene \u2013 one from each parent \u2013 and you don\u2019t necessarily need both.\u201d\n\u201cSounds complicated,\u201d Derek replies, and Stiles can\u2019t help but flush a little bit at the implied compliment in his tone.\nHonestly, he\u2019d been more than a bit worried about seeing Derek again after their encounter at the Jungle a little over a week ago. And, well, it had been awkward for a while. Somehow, though, they\u2019ve managed to get back to something close to what they had before. Stiles suspects most of that has to do with his single-minded stubbornness. He grows on people like a mold, or so he\u2019s been told.\n\u201cIt is complicated,\u201d Stiles says after a moment, smiling over at Derek. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could understand it if you put your mind to it.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Derek snorts, clearly not believing him. Trust Derek to be contradictory even when it comes to compliments.\n\u201cSeriously, if you can understand Mrs Dalloway I\u2019m pretty sure you can understand anything,\u201d Stiles replies, pursing his lips. \u201cI mean, what even was that? The POV shifts and shit?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult to interpret once you understand Woolf\u2019s writing style,\u201d Derek says, shrugging casually. \u201cYou just need to do more reading.\u201d \n\u201cHey, I read!\u201d Stiles protests, pouting at Derek, but he\u2019s not seriously offended. Derek\u2019s at least a little correct, after all. Since his last official English class in sophomore year, his reading material has consisted mostly of academic journals, blog posts, and students\u2019 essays.\n\u201cReally? What was the last thing you read, then?\u201d Derek asks, quirking an eyebrow at him.\n\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says, chewing on his lower lip as he wracks his brain for the answer. \u201cThe last issue of \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cMagazines don\u2019t count,\u201d Derek snorts, making Stiles scowl, because really? The New England Journal of Medicine is not a fucking magazine, thank you very much.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles replies, sighing overdramatically. \u201cI suppose then it would have to be \u2013 \u201d Realization dawns on him and he smirks. \u201c \u2013 Bisexuality and the Dangers of Historical Erasure by Derek Hale.\u201d\nDerek stares at him, eyes wide.\n\u201cYou read that?\u201d he asks after a moment, his voice a little strangled, although nowhere near as much as it was that night in the club.\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Stiles scoffs, but he\u2019s still smirking. \u201cI had to do my research on you.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you internet stalked me,\u201d Derek says, narrowing his eyes at Stiles, but the tips of his ears are a little bit red.\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, Derek. You make me sound like a creeper when you phrase it like that,\u201d Stiles protests, but his tone is teasing.\n\u201cYou are a creeper,\u201d Derek snorts, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m actually your student, Professor Hale,\u201d Stiles says, although the \u2018Professor Hale\u2019 bit comes out more like a purr than anything else, making Derek\u2019s cheeks turn a little bit red. \u201cC\u2019mon Professor, don\u2019t you think \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d a voice says from the doorway, interrupting them, nearly startling Stiles enough to make him flail and fall out of his chair. \u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d\n\u201cKira! Kira, old buddy, old pal, what are you doing here?\u201d Stiles asks through clenched teeth, trying to recompose himself while simultaneously trying to get Kira to go away, because, goddamn it, he\u2019s so close to getting Derek to crack! He can practically taste the office make-outs in his future.\nShe gives him an unimpressed look and strides on into the office, setting down a large stack of papers on Derek\u2019s desk.\n\u201cTwo of the GSIs for English 120 got into a bar fight and are in the hospital,\u201d she explains, turning to Derek. \u201cDo you think you could spare some time to help me grade these papers?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d Derek sighs, already picking up the first essay and scanning it, grimacing slightly.\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not an English professor,\u201d Stiles says, wincing in sympathy. \u201cI think I\u2019d die if I had to read that many essays written by freshmen.\u201d\n\u201cYou had to write a freshman essay once,\u201d Kira points out, making Stiles grin at the memory.\n\u201cYeah, on the history of the male circumcision,\u201d Stiles replies, pleased as he notes how Derek\u2019s ears starting to turn a little red again. \u201cI should get that thing framed someday day.\u201d\nKira\u2019s unable to keep herself from smiling just a little bit at that declaration.\n\u201cYou know, Professor Finstock is still bitter about that,\u201d Kira says, amusement clear in her voice. \u201cHe uses it as an example of off topic writing.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, that essay was a work of art and he knows it,\u201d Stiles scoffs, because it was, okay?\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you convince him of that yourself,\u201d Kira replies, openly grinning now. \u201cOh, and before I forget, Scott wants you to come over for dinner tomorrow because you missed Friday.\u201d\n\u201cWill do,\u201d Stiles says with a lazy salute, Kira nodding at him before turning back to Derek.\n\u201cThanks again, Derek,\u201d Kira says, sending Derek a bright smile.\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Derek replies, waving off her thanks.\nWith that, she leaves. It\u2019s relatively quiet for a moment as Derek pulls his newly acquired stack of essays towards him and Stiles tries to figure out what to say, trying to remember where they\u2019d left off before they\u2019d been interrupted by Kira.\n\u201cAre you on a first name basis with every professor at the university?\u201d Derek asks before Stiles can say anything, though.\n\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Stiles answers, shrugging, a little confused about why Derek\u2019s bringing this up. Is it really that strange that he knows professors from other departments? \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cStiles \u2013 \u201d Derek replies, the strangely concerned expression on his face throwing Stiles for a loop. \u201cForget it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, c\u2019mon, what is it?\u201d Stiles presses, straightening out his posture and leaning over so that his forearms are resting on Derek\u2019s desk. \u201cSeriously, you can\u2019t just leave me hanging, dude.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let people take advantage of you,\u201d Derek says after a moment, confusing Stiles even more.\n\u201cSure, okay,\u201d Stiles replies, giving him an odd look. \u201cI\u2019m, like, the least likely person to get taken advantage of, but thanks for looking out for my virtue, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a much better person than I am,\u201d he answers, glaring down at his papers and refusing to meet Stiles\u2019 eyes.\n\u201cNah, I know you\u2019re an asshole, but at the same time you\u2019re \u2013 I just \u2013 \u201d Stiles says, the words getting caught in his throat. He pauses for a moment. \u201cLet me take you out to dinner.\u201d\nDerek looks up sharply, clearly surprised.\n\u201cStiles \u2013 \u201d he replies, his voice strangled, a pained look on his face.\n\u201cNo, hear me out, okay?\u201d Stiles interrupts, leaning in even closer. \u201cI really like you. You\u2019re smart and sarcastic and aren\u2019t afraid to give as good as you get. And, you know, the fact that you\u2019re hot as fuck is a plus. I\u2019ve been trying to drop hints for months, and \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek repeats, his tone sharper this time, but Stiles is having none of it.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re attracted to me! Don\u2019t try to deny it!\u201d Stiles exclaims, staring at Derek intently, trying to maintain eye contact. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at me. So, please, go out to dinner with me?\u201d\nDerek is silent for a long moment, so many different expression warring on his face that Stiles can\u2019t even begin to interpret what he\u2019s feeling.\nThen, he says, \u201cNo.\u201d\n---\nStiles isn\u2019t exactly proud to admit that he spends nearly the entirety of the subsequent week in the lab. He\u2019s moping, okay? Which is a completely valid reaction, because he\u2019s just gotten his heart torn into a million tiny pieces. He knows that he can be kind of dense sometimes, but he really thought he\u2019d been reading the signs right this time. But apparently not.\nHe even stops by the cat shelter on Friday. He can\u2019t quite bring himself to take one home, though. But really, he should just stop living in denial already.\nHe\u2019s going to die alone with at least three cats. It\u2019s inevitable.\n\u201cTalk,\u201d Lydia commands, practically throwing him down into a chair after dragging him into her office. She\u2019s surprisingly strong for such a petite woman.\n\u201cAbout what? Climate change? Intersectional feminism?\u201d he shoots back, crossing his arms firmly over his chest as scowling at her stubbornly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday and you\u2019ve been moping around since last Tuesday,\u201d she says, clearly unamused with his attitude. \u201cI\u2019m done ignoring it. So spill.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I much prefer the philosophy of ignoring a problem until it just goes away,\u201d Stiles retorts, his tone biting.\n\u201cWell clearly it\u2019s not going away,\u201d Lydia replies, glaring at him, exasperated. \u201cWhen was the last time you showered? In fact, when was the last time you even bothered brushing your hair?\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes at her, but doesn\u2019t reply verbally.\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying here until I get an answer, Stilinski,\u201d Lydia threatens when it becomes clear that he has no intentions of saying anything. \u201cI\u2019ll sabotage your data, too.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says, narrowing his eyes at her, not entirely sure of that assertion.\nLydia smirks evilly.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles sighs, the fight finally draining out of him. \u201cI asked Derek out and he said no, okay? End of story.\u201d\n\u201cHe said no?\u201d Lydia repeats, sounding genuinely surprised for once. \u201cHe explicitly said no?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he explicitly said no,\u201d Stiles answers, running a hand through his already extremely messy hair. Lydia\u2019s right \u2013 it has been a while since he combed it with anything other than his fingers. \u201cVery clearly. To my face.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says after a moment, an uncommon look of pity on her face.\n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019d kind of like to just get back to drowning myself in my work to keep from drowning myself in the bottom of a bottle, so\u2026\u201d Stiles replies, flailing a hand vaguely in the direction of the office door.\n\u201cDid he give you a reason why?\u201d Lydia presses, apparently not content with his answer.\n\u201cNo. No, he didn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles snaps, jaw clenched tight. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know, okay? He literally just said \u2018no.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d\nLydia examines his expression for a long, long moment before pursing her lips and nodding. Stiles can\u2019t get out of the room fast enough.\n---\nIt\u2019s Friday before Stiles really leaves the lab for anything other than food or sleep, and that\u2019s only because Boyd\u2019s out with flu and someone needs to fill in for his Bio 130 lecture. Stiles, naturally, gets to be that lucky person. He\u2019s half convinced that Lydia did it on purpose. Hell, maybe she even gave Boyd the flu. Who knows?\nSo to say that he\u2019s less than happy to be giving a lecture to underclassmen at nine in the morning on a Friday is beyond an understatement. He still plasters a smile on his face and forces an upbeat attitude, though.\nReally, it\u2019s not that difficult. It\u2019s Bio 130, after all \u2013 he could probably teach this in his sleep. However, half an hour into the class, he falters.\nBecause loitering in the back of the lecture hall is Derek Hale, who\u2019s staring at Stiles like he\u2019s never seen him before.\nFuck, he\u2019s going to kill Lydia.\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Stiles manages to continue, tearing his eyes away from Derek and clearing his throat awkwardly, \u201cplasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements which carry non-essential genes.\u201d\nSomehow he manages to get through the second half of the lecture. He really has no fucking clue how he does it, but somehow he does. It\u2019s so hard not to let his eyes stray back to Derek at every opportunity, though \u2013 not when he standing right there.\nWhy\u2019s Derek even here, though? Seriously, what\u2019s the point? Fuck, hopefully he\u2019s not just here to humiliate Stiles further, because \u2013 because \u2013\nGod. Derek Hale needs to stop messing with his head.\nWhen the class is finally over, all Stiles wants to do is bolt out of the room and get as far away from Derek as possible. Of course, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen, partially because he needs to stick around to answer questions for a few students, but mainly because he\u2019s at the point furthest away from the exits and there are about two hundred undergrads all trying to escape at once.\nFuck his life.\n\u201cProfessor Stilinski,\u201d a student says, drawing Stiles back to the subject at hand, distracting him from Derek at least momentarily. \u201cUm, so, should I just turn in my exam re-grade request to you or should I wait until Professor Boyd is back?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Stiles replies, accepting the papers, quickly scanning the cover sheet before nodding, deeming it acceptable. \u201cIt might be a week or so before Professor Boyd gets back, in which case you\u2019d be past the deadline.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d the student answers, adjusting their grip on their backpack a little awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, see you on Monday, then, Professor Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. See ya,\u201d Stiles says absently, chewing on his bottom lip and pushing his glasses back up his nose as he flips through the exam.\n\u201cSo,\u201d an all too familiar voice says, making Stiles jump and jerk his head up. \u201cI think I owe you an apology, Professor Stilinski.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles replies, swallowing thickly and trying not to stare too obviously even though he\u2019s been deprived of Derek for over a week. \u201cOkay. Shoot.\u201d\n\u201cI, uh, never gave you a reason for why I rejected you,\u201d Derek starts, looking strangely awkward and anxious for once. \u201cI \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cDude, no,\u201d Stiles interrupts, shaking his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. No means no, and I respect that. I don\u2019t respect you any less because of it, but I will if you give me shitty excuses, so \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cI thought you were a student!\u201d Derek blurts out.\nWait. What?\n\u201cYou thought I was a student?\u201d Stiles repeats, incredulous, his mouth hanging open in surprise.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek replies gruffly, jaw clenched, breaking eye contact in order to stare at the lecture hall floor.\n\u201cYou thought I was a student,\u201d Stiles says again, the declaration still sinking in. \u201cYou thought I was a student.\u201d\n\u201cWell if you\u2019re just going to rub it in\u2026\u201d Derek grumbles, cheeks flushing bright pink. \u201cLook, forget it. I get that I lost my chance.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Stiles exclaims, grabbing onto Derek\u2019s wrist as he tries to turn away. \u201cI just \u2013 I\u2019m still processing it, okay? I mean, seriously, how did you not realize that I was a professor?\u201d\n\u201cYou were in my class. What did you expect?\u201d Derek retorts, although he sounds more embarrassed than defensive. \u201cAnd you\u2019re kind of \u2013 \u201d Derek grimaces. \u201c \u2013 young looking.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am aware that I\u2019m a twink,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes, but he\u2019s really kind of amused at the whole thing. Seriously, this would be hilarious if this stupid misunderstanding hadn\u2019t been keeping Derek from fucking the living daylights out of him for the past few months. \u201cYou\u2019re not even the first person this month to mistake me for an undergrad. I swear I\u2019m twenty-nine, though. I can show you my license and everything.\u201d\nDerek looks more than a little relieved at that.\n\u201cWait, is this why you were so weird about me being friends with Kira?\u201d Stiles asks, eyes widening as realization dawns on him. \u201cHoly shit, you really were trying to protect my virtue!\u201d\n\u201cIf I agree to take you out to dinner tonight will you shut up about it?\u201d Derek replies, still blushing bright, bright red.\n\u201cNever,\u201d Stiles answers, grinning at him cheekily. \u201cI\u2019ll telling this story to our grandchildren.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re getting a little ahead of yourself there,\u201d Derek grumbles, but it\u2019s a pretty weak protest by his standards.\n\u201cPlease, I spent months attempting to woo you. I read Hemingway for you. Do you really think I\u2019m going to let you go now?\u201d Stiles asks, taking Derek\u2019s hand in his and twining their fingers together.\n\u201cReading Hemingway is a pretty noble sacrifice,\u201d Derek replies, lips twitching up into the barest hint of a smile.\n\u201cHa! I knew you secretly hated \u2013 \u201d Stiles starts.\nDerek cuts him off with a kiss."
