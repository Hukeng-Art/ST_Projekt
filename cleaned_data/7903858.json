    "text": "It\u2019s the night before Natsu is set to leave for Suna for her chunin exams, and Itachi shouldn\u2019t burden her with this, she\u2019s just a kid. But he doesn\u2019t have anyone else to tell, and maybe the right thing to do, the strong thing to do would be to stay silent, but he can\u2019t. He\u2019s not that strong.\n\u201cNatsu-chan?\u201d he says softly, precariously balanced on her windowsill. He really wishes she\u2019d lock the damn thing.\nHer breathing shifts, then she\u2019s awake, pushing her blanket off of her and dragging herself to her feet. \u201cSenpai?\u201d she yawns, rubbing at her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d She looks even younger standing there in a too big t-shirt that he\u2019s certain is Kakashi\u2019s, and he almost changes his mind, tells her to go back to sleep and forget about it. But she crosses her room and holds out her hand, \u201cItachi, come here.\u201d\nSo he does. He sits down at the edge of her bed, and tells her everything. She paces and scowls, and when he finishes she crosses her arms and says, \u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious what we have to do.\u201d\nHe blinks. \u201cIt is?\u201d\n~\nThey\u2019re sneaking back out of his house as Root surrounds the home. Natsu\u2019s hand is clenched tightly around his own as they move silently through the forest, and he\u2019s still in shock of what they\u2019ve done, of what she risked for him without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nThat said, he really hopes that killing Danzo in the middle of the night and committing treason is the worst thing she talks him into. Also, that they don\u2019t get caught.\nSomehow, he doesn\u2019t think her assertation of \u201cDanzo started it\u201d would hold up under questioning.\n~\nShe offered to help with this part too, but he refused. For one, he didn\u2019t want her missing her chunin exam. For another, killing Madara would be dangerous enough but he\u2019s going to try and capture madman, and he doesn\u2019t want Natsu anywhere near him for that part. He\u2019s grateful she\u2019s going to be in Suna \u2013 putting a country between them is honestly the only way he can be sure she won\u2019t interfere and give him a heart attack.\n~\nItachi gives it a day. It takes less than that for the news to spread throughout the village. But he slides through the hokage\u2019s window, going into a low bow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting, but there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d\nShikaku and Ibiki are there. Good. He\u2019s kept Madara unconscious, but they\u2019re the ones that are going to end up having to deal with him.\nHe\u2019s a loyal shinobi of Kohonagakure. He would have slaughtered his clan if his village required it \u2013 he still might, if his father and Sarutobi cannot reach an accord. But maybe \u2013 maybe there\u2019s another way.\n~\nThey reach an accord.\nIt is not one that Itachi expected them to reach.\nHe\u2019s in his room, giving in to rare moment of weakness. He sits there with his head in his hands, and for his villaage he would sacrifice everything. Comparatively, this is nothing. And yet, it\u2019s somehow so much more terrifying.\nThere\u2019s a nearly-silent displacement of air, and his kunai is already in his hand by the time he recognizes the chakra signature. \u201cYou\u2019re back early,\u201d he croaks. He hopes his eyes aren\u2019t red.\nNatsu throws herself at him, and it\u2019s such a relief to fold his arms around her waist and rest his forehead against her shoulder. \u201cItachi-senpai! I was so worried, I could barely concentrate the whole exam. I was so scared I would come back, and you would be \u2013 I mean that there would be \u2013 you know.\u201d Natsu runs her fingers through his hair, and Itachi almost smiles, the closest he\u2019s come since Danzo first approached him.\n\u201cHow did your exam go?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m a chunin!\u201d she says excitedly, and she\u2019s the youngest chunin to be promoted in the last fifty years besides himself and Kakashi.\nHe pulls away from her and absently straightens her tunic, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you Natsu-chan. I knew you could do it.\u201d\nShe beams at him, but grabs at his hands, holding them in her own and refusing to let go. \u201cSenpai. Is everything okay now? With \u2013 everything?\u201d\nHe opens his mouth, and this is a secret. Only three people know besides the Uchiha clan elders, and he\u2019s under strict orders to keep it that way.\nBut it\u2019s Natsu. The only reason his family isn\u2019t dead and he isn\u2019t on the run is because of her.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be hokage.\u201d\nNatsu blinks. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t blame her at all. He had the same reaction.\n~\n\u201cSo I heard you\u2019re going to be hokage.\u201d\nItachi freezes halfway through his kata and slowly turns his head. Kakashi doesn\u2019t look up from his book. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cNatsu didn\u2019t tell me, if it makes you feel better.\u201d It does, actually. \u201cShikaku told me.\u201d\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t know either,\u201d he snaps.\nKakashi shrugs, \u201cIt\u2019s Shikaku. Knowing everything is his job. Or well, maybe that\u2019s Inoichi\u2019s job. Point being, they all know. So they\u2019ll tell the other clan heads out of courtesy, except maybe Hyuuga. Who will tell their heirs.\u201d Dear god, this is all going to spiral out of control so quickly. \u201cI told Gai, by the way. He\u2019ll probably tell Anko, who will tell Kurenai. That is, if she hasn\u2019t already heard from Asuma. Who I\u2019d guess already knows, because his father definitely told him.\u201d\nThis is the worst day of his life. \u201cDid you need something, Kakashi?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I wanted to thank you.\u201d He finally looks up from the book, and even under the mask Itachi can tell that he\u2019s beaming. \u201cSarutobi\u2019s been pressuring me to take the hokage position. Now that you\u2019re next in line instead I won\u2019t have to!\u201d\nWorst. Day. Of. His. Life.\n~\nHe\u2019s thirteen, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to shove the pointy hat on him and call it a day. No, they\u2019re going to wait. Sarutobi had proposed eighteen, while surprisingly his father had fought for at least twenty one. \u201cThe villagers won\u2019t respect a child, Sarutobi. No matter how gifted.\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t decided. They\u2019d play it by ear.\nSo sometime in the next five to ten years, assuming he doesn\u2019t die, he\u2019s going to be made hokage.\nFuck.\n~\nEveryone starts treating him differently. He\u2019s the shining hope of his clan now, and it\u2019s almost physically painful, how they all look at him. Shinobi who were wary of him and avoided him are now friendly.\nHe hates it.\nHe\u2019s just returned from a mission, and he doesn\u2019t want to go home but he doesn\u2019t want to go to the training grounds alone either. He can\u2019t even be surprised with himself when he ends up Natsu\u2019s apartment. Her and Anko are sitting cross legged on the floor, a large sheath of paper spread out on the ground and a half sketched seal taking up most of it. At first glance it looks like a summoning seal, only \u2013 not. He honestly doesn\u2019t want to know.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intrude,\u201d he apologizes, mentally kicking himself. Natsu\u2019s a chunin now on an indefinite research mission. Just because she\u2019s not with her team or on patrols doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s free.\nNatsu beams and pats the space next to her, \u201cCome on Senpai! You can help.\u201d\nAnko smirks at him. That woman unnerves him, but she\u2019s certainly not going to start being nice to him just because he\u2019s the next hokage, so there\u2019s that. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n~\nThe next ten years pass thusly:\nSasuke qualifies to graduate from the Academy early at ten years old. Both he and Natsu advise against it. Sasuke listens to them, and one day he\u2019ll lose his starry eyed adoration for Itachi and crush on Natsu, but until then.\nItachi studies, and trains, and there\u2019s no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind he\u2019s the strongest ninja in the village, Sarutobi included. He still doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ready.\nNatsu becomes a jounin at the age of fifteen. The next day, she takes a C ranked mission to Wave. She comes back two months later the most injured Itachi has ever seen her. She won\u2019t speak to Kabuto for three weeks. Hana doesn\u2019t speak to him for over a month. He never finds out what exactly happened on that mission \u2013 he\u2019s already decided his first act as Hokage will be to read that particular mission scroll.\nBut truly, it is a good ten years.\nThen his mother tells him it\u2019s time for him to get married.\n~\n\u201cAniki is getting married?\u201d Sasuke demands over dinner. Itachi\u2019s frozen and his dumpling is stuck in midair two inches from his mouth.\nMikoto raises an eyebrow, \u201cYour brother is to be made hokage in the next month.\u201d\nHis dumpling falls from his chopsticks and onto his lap. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put it off long enough,\u201d Fugaku sighs, \u201cItachi, you\u2019re twenty three years old. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cBut what does that have to do with him getting married?\u201d Sasuke insists. Itachi loves his brother.\n\u201cOur image is very important right now,\u201d Mikoto smooths out the napkin on her lap, \u201cWe need to make the right connections. Now, there aren\u2019t many suitable young woman from strong clan families. I personally would have preferred Hana Inuzuka, that relationship you two had was quite nice,\u201d she says to him. Personally, he thinks relationship is a strong word for something that not only lasted less than three months, but also consisted purely of them having sex and complaining about Natsu. \u201cHowever, she\u2019s the heir to her clan and Tsume won\u2019t be persuaded to name her son instead.\u201d\nSasuke frowns, \u201cKiba\u2019s a good leader.\u201d\nFugaku clears his throat. It has been a sour point in the household when Kiba had been named team leader and Sasuke had refused to contest it. \u201cAnyway, our options are limited. We\u2019re considering Hiashi\u2019s youngest, in which case of course we\u2019ll simply announce the engagement until she\u2019s of age.\u201d\n\u201cHanabi?\u201d Sasuke repeats, and he and Itachi make a pointed effort not to look at each other. \u201cShe can\u2019t marry Itachi!\u201d\n\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d their mother asks.\nItachi tries to think of a way to tell them that Hanabi is heading a coup of the Hyuuga clan without ruining years of work and revealing both himself and Sasuke as conspirators against one of the most powerful clans in Konoha, and fails.\nThe entire thing is Natsu\u2019s fault, and she\u2019s inordinately proud of her scheming little prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unsuitable match,\u201d he settles on finally. \u201cI would prefer a different bride.\u201d\n\u201cWell who would you pick?\u201d his father snaps, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re overflowing with options.\u201d\nThis entire thing is giving him a headache. \u201cPerhaps a foreign bride to cement trade relations? From Suna?\u201d\nFugaku scoffs, \u201cAs if there\u2019s any need to strengthen our relationship with Suna. Nami has done that quite well herself.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that young man of hers?\u201d Mikoto asks, nearly cutting off the beginning of yet another argument about the flighty jounin.\nSasuke puts his elbow on the table and rests his chin on his hands. It\u2019s a testament to how frazzled their parents are that neither of them call him on it. \u201cGaara is currently engaged to Mei Terumi of Kirigakure. Now that\u2019s a political match.\u201d\nItachi hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cWho\u2019s moving where?\u201d\n\u201cThey set up a revolving system,\u201d he answers, \u201cKiri isn\u2019t stable enough to lose it\u2019s jounin commander, so Gaara will be living there for the next few years. After that they\u2019ll move to Suna.\u201d\n\u201cThis must be difficult for them,\u201d he says after a moment, \u201cconsidering.\u201d\nSasuke shrugs, \u201cGaara says there\u2019s sand in the ocean and water in the desert. They\u2019ll adapt.\u201d\n\u201cIs Natsu upset?\u201d Mikoto asks. Fugaku\u2019s mouth tugs down at the corners in irritation. This conversation has gotten away from him. \u201cThose two have been dating for over a year now.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Sasuke says, \u201cShe\u2019s the one that arranged it.\u201d\n\u201cBack to the matter at hand,\u201d Fugaku snaps, \u201cItachi, you must take a bride of respectable station before you become Godaime Hokage. That is an order.\u201d\nSasuke\u2019s eye flash red, but Itachi kicks his little brother\u2019s seat and says, \u201cYes father.\u201d\n~\nThe next day the Nara heir intercepts Itachi on his way to the mission assignment office, \u201cTeam Natsu is returning today. We just got the notice from the border guards.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t do anything so obvious as sigh in relief, but he\u2019s tempted. He\u2019d been \u2013 upset, when Natsu had been sent on a mission without him. They were partners. They were supposed to run missions together. Now, of course, he understands it\u2019s because they\u2019re prepping him to finally take over as hokage. But that doesn\u2019t mean watching her go off alone had been easy. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nShikamaru rubs the back of his neck, and a low pit of dread forms in Itachi\u2019s stomach. \u201cAccording to reports they don\u2019t look so great. Something happened in Kiri. I\u2019m telling you now so you don\u2019t overreact.\u201d\n\u201cI never overreact,\u201d he says automatically.\nHe raises an eyebrow. \u201cRight,\u201d and then shunshins away.\nItachi has a meeting with the hokage that it would be incredibly inappropriate of him to miss. He considers this for a moment, and then turns on his heel and heads to the border.\nHe gets there just as they\u2019re arriving. Natsu is blood covered and limping, her uniform in tatters. Her arm is hanging at an awkward angle at her side, and she\u2019s practically carrying Hanabi at her side. Hinata and Hanabi are equally cut up, although all their limbs seem to intact. However both of them have bandages wrapped around the top halves of their faces. \u201cTheir eyes?\u201d he asks, reaching out to help but not knowing where to touch without doing more damage. If enemy ninja have gotten their hands on two pairs of Hyuuga eyes \u2013\n\u201cIntact,\u201d Hanabi croaks, \u201conly damaged. It\u2019s temporary.\u201d\n\u201cHey Senpai,\u201d Natsu smiles and her mouth is full of blood. Her words are coming out slurred, and Itachi steps closer. If nothing else, at least if she falls she\u2019ll land on him and not on the ground.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demands, \u201cThis was supposed to be a reconnaissance mission!\u201d\nThey don\u2019t have chance to explain before Kabuto and Hana body flicker besides them. \u201cHyuuga first,\u201d Natsu commands immediately.\nThey throw her sour looks, but Kabuto gently eases Hanabi from Natsu\u2019s side and his hands flare green. \u201cWhy did Sensei name you team leader again? All you do is stick your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong, and then Hana and I have to clean up your mess.\u201d\n\u201cAt least she\u2019s conscious this time,\u201d Hana adds.\n\u201cThat was one time,\u201d Itachi and Natsu protest in unison. It hadn\u2019t been their proudest moment.\nHana frowns as her chakra coats Hinata\u2019s face. \u201cKabuto, I think you\u2019re going to have to handle their eyes on your own. Or I can grab Sakura, she has some experience with eye based bloodline limit injuries thanks to Sasuke.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Kabuto says, \u201cYou just take care of the muscle tears and skin abrasions and blood loss.\u201d\n\u201cOh, just those,\u201d Hana mutters, rolling her eyes.\nNatsu sways on her feet, and Itachi reaches out, placing one hand on her good shoulder and the other on the opposite hip. She sighs and leans forward enough to rest her head against his shoulder, and lets him take most of her weight. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he repeats. Her hair is streaked with blood, too much of it for it to be her own. He thinks. He hopes.\n\u201cJust a few complications,\u201d she says, and he has to wind an arm around her waist to keep her steady against him. That\u2019s not an answer, but Hana comes over and with a painful sounding crack shoves Natsu\u2019s arm back in place, healing the damage with a wash of healing chakra. It happens so quickly that Natsu doesn\u2019t even think to go \u201cOW! Hana!\u201d until it\u2019s already over.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like being healed, you should stop getting hurt so often,\u201d the older girl says firmly. \u201cItachi, take her home, the rest of her injuries can wait. One of us will be over once we get Hinata and Hanabi sorted out.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so mean to me,\u201d Natsu pouts. Hana rolls her eyes and goes back over to help Kabuto. Natsu starts to pull away, like she actually expects Itachi to let her walk home like this, and in one smooth motion he\u2019s lifted her into his arms. Her blood is going to completely ruin his uniform. Well, it won\u2019t be the first time, nor the last. \u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he orders, although she\u2019s never obeyed him once, and starts walking.\nShe grumbles, but her protests are completely invalidated by the way she curls against him. \u201cMy apartment is the other way, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d he says dryly. It should probably be concerning how many people see him carrying his injured partner through the village and don\u2019t even give them a second glance. He carries her through the window of his room, and walks her to the bathroom, gingerly setting her down on the edge of the tub. \u201cYou need a bath.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she says sarcastically. But now that she\u2019s not running on the adrenaline of getting herself and two blind Hyuugas home she\u2019s wilting. He runs the water this side of too hot to be bearable, and dumps in the bath salts that he keeps specifically for her.\n\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmurs, taking out a kunai and carefully cutting away her clothes. The sandals are salvageable, so takes those off and slides them in the corner. They\u2019ve treated each other\u2019s wounds and been running missions together for too many years to get embarrassed by each other\u2019s bodies. He offers her his arm and Natsu slides into the hot water, twisting her body so her back\u2019s to Itachi. She unwinds her breast band and tosses it behind her. It lands neatly in the trash. Itachi takes off his shoes and shirt \u2013 they\u2019re just going to get in the way. \u201cNatsu, what happened?\u201d\nHer back has deep, long cuts that are about an inch into the muscle. That would be one thing, but they\u2019re black around the edges \u2013 burned closed. Natsu is hardly the most skilled with healing chakra, but she\u2019s certainly accomplished enough that she shouldn\u2019t need to cauterize a wound. Which means whatever did this to her was also on fire. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she says, twisting to dunk her hair underneath the water.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he repeats flatly. Natsu\u2019s an incredibly intelligent woman, and that\u2019s the dumbest thing she\u2019s ever said. She doesn\u2019t answer him, but she does hold out his shampoo bottle. He sighs and squirts it into his hands, beginning the long process of working it into her ridiculously long hair. Her skin is warm and soft and she came back to him alive, which is all he has any right to ask of her. He is, however, sick of cleaning his best friend\u2019s blood from his clothes. The bath water is tinged pink, and the salts have to be stinging her open wounds. But Natsu only leans into his hands and tilts so he can gently wipe the grime from her skin.\nShikamaru was wrong. It\u2019s not an overreaction when Natsu keeps coming back from missions looking like this.\n~\nNatsu is wrapped in on his spare shirts and sleeping in his bed by the time Kabuto knocks on his window. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, gently easing the blanket down so he can get to her wounds, \u201cI just have her keep extra sets of clothes at Hana\u2019s place for when she shows up bleeding and falling asleep on our couch.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she does,\u201d Itachi confirms. \u201cShe has her own drawer of them.\u201d\nKabuto flashes him a grin, \u201cYeah, she never uses them at ours either. Last time she walked naked from her room to ours to steal a set of Hana\u2019s pajamas instead.\u201d\n\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Natsu grumbles, opening up a single dark eye to glare at them. \u201cTook you long enough. I could have been bleeding out.\u201d\nKabuto rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d his hands glow green and he reaches under Natsu\u2019s shirt, running his hands over her and healing as he goes. The discomfort in her face lessens by degrees, until she\u2019s basically asleep again, her breathing deep and even in a way it hadn\u2019t been before. Kabuto runs his hands over her arms and legs, quickly healing other minor injuries and muscle tears.\n\u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d Itachi asks softly as Kabuto drags the blankets up over Natsu\u2019s shoulders.\nHe hesitates, brushing the hair from Natsu\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Itachi.\u201d\nItachi grabs his arm when he tries to leave, tight enough to break it. \u201cYou saw her back. She\u2019s my partner.\u201d\nKabuto scowls and twists out of Itachi\u2019s grasp only to push himself into the other man\u2019s face, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk like that to me, Uchiha. Natsu was my teammate for years before joining Anbu, she\u2019s family to me, asshole. Hana and I have seen her in worse shape more times than we can count, and we\u2019ve healed her. Every time. Including all those times when she comes home limping and half dead from whatever insane mission the two of you have been on.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t choose our missions,\u201d he says, because Natsu is one of the most skilled ninja in the village, and one of the few people who can keep up with him. But seeing her hurt makes his lungs constrict.\nKabuto pokes him hard in the shoulder, and Kabuto is another person that doesn\u2019t give a crap that he\u2019s the future hokage. Usually he\u2019s grateful for that, but this time he has to resist the urge to tear off his hand. \u201cWell, what makes you think she chooses hers, dumbass?\u201d\nItachi doesn\u2019t have a response to that. Thankfully, Kabuto doesn\u2019t wait for one.\n~\nHe\u2019s downstairs eating breakfast with his family when Natsu comes down the stairs, bright eyed and moving easily. \u201cGood morning!\u201d she says cheerfully.\n\u201cGood morning Natsu,\u201d Sasuke greets, hiding a smile behind his glass of orange juice. Fugaku is staring and Mikoto\u2019s hand is already half raised to rub at her temples.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t feel like getting dressed this morning?\u201d he asks. He\u2019s long been resigned to this.\nNatsu is still in his shirt, her ash pale hair piled in a messy bun on top of her head. She\u2019s not wearing any pants, her long legs bare as she goes on her tip toes to snag herself a coffee cup. \u201cWell, you ruined my clothes last night! What am I supposed to wear? Your pants are too big on me.\u201d His father turns to glare at him. Itachi refuses to blush. Natsu pours herself a cup of coffee and chugs all of it one go, then pours herself another. \u201cDo you have any plans today?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting with the hokage,\u201d he answers calmly.\nNatsu\u2019s nose scrunches and she wanders over, leaning against his back and reaching over to steal some of his bacon. \u201cBummer. I have to leave on another mission tomorrow.\u201d\nItachi frowns and leans back in his chair so he\u2019s looking up at her, \u201cYou just got back. Who are you going with?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she stage whispers, eyes wide. Itachi glares at her and she giggles and leans down to kiss his forehead.\nSasuke coughs and puts his napkin on top of his plate before standing, \u201cNatsu, I wear my pants tighter than Aniki. You can borrow a pair of mine.\u201d\n\u201cThanks Sasuke!\u201d she beams and lets his little brother place a hand on her back and guide her upstairs, coffee cup still held in her hand.\nBoth of his parents are staring at him. He stares back and pretends he doesn\u2019t miss the warmth of Natsu against his back.\n~\n\u201cAre you getting married to Senpai?\u201d\nItachi despairs of ever arriving to his appointment with the hokage on time, and turns to look at the teenager. \u201cNo,\u201d he pauses, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s been walking around the village wearing the Uchiha crest,\u201d Hanabi says, \u201cand everyone who\u2019s not an idiot knows your parents are pushing you to get married. Natsu is the obvious choice.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s wearing the Uchiha crest because she\u2019s wearing my shirt,\u201d he sighs, \u201cand actually, you were my parent\u2019s first choice.\u201d\nHer face twists. Itachi decides not to be offended by that. \u201cWhatever. Natsu-senpai won\u2019t wait around for you get your shit together forever. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t accept Gaara\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\u201cGaara proposed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he offered to,\u201d she says, \u201cHe needed to make a political marriage, and Natsu was a perfect choice. She set him up with Mei instead, but Gaara would have been good for Senpai. They could have loved each other.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d he asks. He can\u2019t believe Natsu didn\u2019t tell him that Gaara offered to marry her.\nShe rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not her only option. In fact, I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re her best option,\u201d she sniffs. \u201cSo I would get your shit together if you don\u2019t want to lose her to someone who\u2019s less of an idiot.\u201d\n~\nThe number of people he can ask this to are limited. It\u2019s a Saturday, so he\u2019s lucky enough to find Kakashi and Iruka together.\n\u201cItachi,\u201d the Academy teacher says warmly, \u201cNatsu\u2019s not here, if you\u2019re looking for her. I believe she\u2019s with Anko.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, gaze quickly flickering between him and Kakashi, \u201cI was just wondering \u2013 am I in love with Natsu?\u201d\nKakashi snorts, then drops his orange book to slap his hand over his face in an attempt to muffle what is clearly the beginnings of hysterical laughter. Iruka stares at him as if he\u2019s a particularly slow student.\n\u201cRight,\u201d he nods, \u201cthank you.\u201d\nHe goes to Shikamaru next. He finds the jounin training his brats, which mostly means cloud watching while his genin attempt to kill each other. He bends at the waist so he\u2019s looking the other man in the face. Shikamaru opens his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Natsu.\u201d\n\u201cThe sky is blue,\u201d he responds. Itachi raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat? I thought we were saying obvious facts that everyone knows.\u201d\nItachi doesn\u2019t respond to that. Instead he body flickers home to where his parents are pouring over clan lineage books. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Natsu.\u201d\nHis parents share a glance, but don\u2019t seem surprised by this at all. If he finds out Sasuke knew about this and didn\u2019t tell him, he\u2019s going to be down one little brother. \u201cWe know, dear,\u201d Mikoto says finally. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t approve of her \u2013 flaunting herself at you, after she\u2019s already rejected you.\u201d\nHe stares. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t rejected me. I haven\u2019t told her yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Fugaku blinks, \u201cItachi, you have to have told her. You\u2019ve been half gone over that girl since basically the two of you met. You call her Natsu-chan!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wish someone had told me that,\u201d he says, frowning.\nHis mother puts her face in her hands. \u201cFugaku, he can\u2019t become hokage. Our son\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\nItachi considers getting offended, but he needs their blessing more than his pride. \u201cI want to ask her to marry me.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Fugaku says firmly, \u201cTake my mother\u2019s ring so she knows you\u2019re serious.\u201d\nToday is a day of surprises. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any objections?\u201d\nMikoto huffs and counts off on her fingers, \u201cShe\u2019s a special Anbu, arguably the best seal master in the elemental nations, considered a close personal ally of no less than eight major clans. She brokered treaties with three other ninja nations on behalf of Konoha, and is comfortable and trusted enough as diplomat to arrange the marriage of nobles from two other ninja villages.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s the perfect choice to be your wife,\u201d Fugaku concludes. \u201cA bearer of your children is nice and all, but a true partner is someone you can share your burdens with. She half runs this village already.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says. He expected this conversation to be a lot more difficult. \u201cOkay then.\u201d\n~\nThere\u2019s one more person he has to visit before he tracks down Natsu. It\u2019s too early in the day for the Flower District to be busy, but a beautiful young man answers the door anyway, robes low around his shoulders to display the koi fish tattooed on his chest. That\u2019s not surpring \u2013 what is surprising is the other boy\u2019s dark eyes, pale skin, and very distinctive bone structure. He knows all the Uchiha, and he\u2019s never seen this boy before in his life. \u201cUchiha-san,\u201d the man murmurers, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re here to sample the wares?\u201d\n\u201cI am not,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but are you \u2013 you look familiar.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t glare, koi don\u2019t do anything as uncouth as glare, but he does somehow give the general impression that he considers Itachi to be worth less than they dirt under his shoes. \u201cYou may call me Sai, Uchiha-san.\u201d\nHe knows for damn fact that no one had a kid named Sai. But there\u2019s no way this boy isn\u2019t one of them. But this isn\u2019t what he came here for. \u201cI wish to speak to Madame Koi.\u201d\nSai doesn\u2019t move to let him in. \u201cYou know all of your family have been banned from our business. For obvious reasons.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Natsu,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nSai wavers. Natsu may not work in the brothel, but she wears her koi tattoo just as proudly. \u201cIf I\u2019m fired for this, I expect you to find me a rich woman to service indefinitely,\u201d he warns.\nItachi almost smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\nHe\u2019s led through the house, and more than one koi gives him a strange look. They all know Natsu, so they all know him, but they know that Uchiha aren\u2019t welcome here. He\u2019s never had the need to break the rule before know. The man leads him to an oak door, and calls out, \u201cGRANDMOTHER! You have a visitor!\u201d before tapping him twice on the back for good luck.\nHe takes a deep breath before stepping inside. He\u2019s not surprised at all to find a blade pressed to his neck. Madame Koi looks so much like her sister it\u2019s terrifying. Except that Grandma had been happy to remain a moderately skilled chunin at her husband\u2019s side \u2013 something the woman in front of him never would have been happy with, no matter her path in life. \u201cI should slit your throat, boy.\u201d\n\u201cHello Aunt Kiyomi,\u201d he says evenly. \u201cI assume I just met my cousin?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she snaps, not moving the blade. \u201cWhat do you want? Did your father send you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here as an Uchiha,\u201d he says.\nHe doesn\u2019t say anything else. Kiyomi is as intelligent as the best of their clansmen, and it only takes her a handful of seconds to figure it out. \u201cI don\u2019t make Natsu\u2019s decisions for her. I never have.\u201d\n\u201cI still ask for your blessing,\u201d he says. He really does wish she\u2019d put down the sword.\nShe snorts, \u201cWhy ask? I\u2019m not the girl\u2019s mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the closest she has,\u201d he answers, \u201cPlease, Madame Koi.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t make her choices for her,\u201d she repeats, but finally lowers the sword. \u201cNatsu is no fool. If she accepts your offer, then she\u2019ll do it knowing exactly the type of family she\u2019s marrying into. My opinion doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cYou did raise her,\u201d he says softly, \u201cYou\u2019re not so different from the rest of us.\u201d\nHer face twists and she raises her sword again, \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m just like the rest of you. I\u2019m just honest enough not lie about what I am.\u201d\nThere\u2019s irony in that, that she refuses to answer to the name Uchiha when her identity is less a mystery and more a high level secret. But he knows what she means. A large part of being an Uchiha is living under a microscope for your village, living under a type of scrutiny that no other clan is put under. It twists people, and maybe Kiyomi\u2019s whole life is a performance \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t pretend it\u2019s anything else. \u201cThank you,\u201d he settles on.\n\u201cGet out,\u201d she answers. She doesn\u2019t lower her sword.\nHonestly, he was expecting it to go worse.\n~\nFinding Natsu, ironically, leads him straight to the Hokage tower. He slides in through the window, and has to blink at the odd group gathered there.\nThere\u2019s Natsu and Sarutobi, of course, but also Anko, Hanabi, and Sasuke. \u201cShit,\u201d his little brother says, eyes wide.\nThey\u2019re in a circle around what looks like him to a modified portal seal. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks.\nNatsu doesn\u2019t answer. The seal is already glowing, and she slams her hands down on the edges to complete it. Itachi doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting to come out the other side, but it\u2019s certainly not who does.\nOrochimaru and Kisame of the Seven Swordsman are standing in the middle of the office. \u201cBrat,\u201d Orochimaru greets fondly, reaching out a hand to pat Natsu on the head. Anko takes the opportunity to duck under Orochimaru\u2019s arm and snuggle against his side. He obligingly folds his arm around her shoulders and kisses her on the head. \u201cWhere\u2019s Kabuto?\u201d\n\u201cHe and Hana had an emergency at the hospital to take care of,\u201d Natsu answers, glancing nervously at Itachi. \u201cDo you have them?\u201d\n\u201cMy debt is repaid,\u201d he intones dramatically, before unsealing a large blood stained sack and handing it Sarutobi, who takes it with an exasperated sigh. \u201cThose are the heads of all your bounties. Can I go back to running my village now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m head of Torture and Investigation,\u201d Kisame reminds grumpily, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to leave the village. When I\u2019m not there, Haku is in charge.\u201d\n\u201cYour subordinates must weep with gratitude when you return,\u201d Hanabi says.\nKisame grins, \u201cThey do, actually. Underneath all the pretty, that boy is terrifying.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Itachi says, louder than strictly necessary. \u201cBut what the fuck?\u201d\nOrochimaru blinks. \u201cThis is the kid we\u2019ve been running around nearly getting killed for?\u201d He looks Itachi up and down and then says to Natsu, \u201cHe better be good in bed, because it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s that bright.\u201d\nAnko and Sasuke snort at the same time and Natsu is pulled between exasperated and mortified. \u201cI should have left you crazy.\u201d\nThe missing nin sniffs and attempts to look unaffected with Anko cuddled into his side, \u201cDarling, it\u2019s adorable that you think I\u2019m not just as crazy now.\u201d\n~\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Itachi says slowly, and he understands completely how Natsu had basically turned Inoichi into an alcoholic, \u201cis that you\u2019ve been systematically taking out missing nin and providing covert aid to other villages \u2026 why exactly?\u201d\nHanabi and Sasuke trade uncomfortable looks. \u201cWe all know how you feel about war,\u201d Sasuke says, \u201cand I could see how worried you were about taking over, and so could Natsu.\u201d\n\u201cI just helped out because it would benefit the village and Natsu asked me too,\u201d Hanabi shrugs.\nNatsu takes her hair out of its bun and starts braiding it. It\u2019s what she does when she\u2019s nervous. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to get so huge,\u201d she confesses, \u201cbut I was going through Danzo\u2019s files, and after I found Sai and he helped me figure out some other things, so I started \u2013 investigating, I guess. Then there was the mission to Wave, and that where I met Haku and Zabuza.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d he holds up a hand, \u201cZabuza, as in the current mizukage?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the other one,\u201d Hanabi snarks. Sasuke kicks her in the shin.\nNatsu smiles, \u201cYes, that one. That was my idea, I\u2019m afraid, but I think it\u2019s working out well to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cShe also found out about Orochimaru on that mission,\u201d Sasuke adds, \u201cDanzo had given him a seal too, and when he died it had mostly degraded. Enough so that Orochimaru was sane enough to track down a seal master that could help \u2013 Natsu.\u201d\n\u201cOrochimaru is the Otokage,\u201d Hanabi adds, and Itachi gets the impression that the girl is laughing at him. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nWhat the fuck. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \u201cso what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019ve all been going behind my back to subtly manipulate and sometimes outright wage war against all the other elemental nations.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it was really Natsu,\u201d Sasuke says, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cWe just helped.\u201d\nIt occurs to Itachi that Natsu is probably the most politically powerful person in the world. He shudders to think about what someone like Danzo could do with her influence. But it\u2019s Natsu, so instead of trying to put herself in a position of power or amassing wealth for herself or anything normal people do when presented with that kind of opportunity, she actively worked to make the world a better place. Because she wanted Itachi to have a village he could lead without worrying, so she changed the world around them to make it safer for their village, at least in part so Itachi wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid about war on his doorstep.\n\u201cNatsu,\u201d he says, and she cringes like she thinks he\u2019s going to be mad at her. He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a ring, His grandmother\u2019s ring is gold inlaid with sapphires, and he stands and pulls her up with him. \u201cI think this is long overdue. Will you marry me?\u201d She\u2019s staring at him open mouthed, and he ignores Hanabi and Sasuke high fiving behind him. \u201cI know dating first is \u2013 traditional, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cScrew that,\u201d Natsu croaks, \u201cWe\u2019ve basically been dating for ten years anyway.\u201d\nShe takes the ring and throws her arms around his neck. She angels their faces together, and he doesn\u2019t hesitate to kiss her back. It\u2019s a rush, exhilarating and wonderful and like falling from a too tall building before the chakra cushions your fall. But it\u2019s also like coming home too, and he\u2019s such an idiot.\n~\nThey get married as week before Itachi is set to officially become hokage. If he\u2019d thought normal weddings were complicated, that had nothing to weddings that not only had guests from multiple elemental nations, but were also hosting three different kages and their high level ninja. Even the Water daimyo had apparently wanted to attend, although she hadn\u2019t been able to for security reasons. She\u2019d sent her sincerest regrets along with a casket of sealing scrolls salvaged from the Uzugakure that had been sitting in the royal library. They were worth a fortune, and she\u2019d just given them to Natsu. Unbelievable.\nThis was all made extra hilarious of course, since besides all the dignitaries and aristocrats Natsu was friends with, the majority her other friends were high class prostitutes. Shikamaru was currently deep in conversation with a young Madame who\u2019d traveled all the way from Water to be here.\nEven Aunt Kiyomi and Sai had shown up, although they were pointedly not speaking to any of the Uchihas.\nHanabi is the maid of honor, and of course Sasuke is his best man. Kakashi is the one that walks Natsu down the aisle, and Itachi knows that her dress was hand stitched by all the koi of Kiyomi\u2019s parlor, as is tradition, and she looks beautiful in it. She always looks beautiful.\nThey get married in front of what feels like half the world. After the wedding and the party, Itachi and Natsu go home. Fugaku and Mikoto had already moved out earlier that week, but that\u2019s not the point of the tradition. His parents bow to him, and he and his wife bow in return. Mikoto hands over the keys to the Main House to Natsu, \u201cThis home is now your home, daughter.\u201d\n\u201cI will keep it well, mother,\u201d she beams. As is tradition, Natsu unlocks the door and steps inside, her first steps in this home an Uchiha. Itachi bows to his parents once more and takes a step toward the door.\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Fukaku says with a wink. Mikoto slaps him in the shoulder, and Itachi follows his wife inside before they can embarrass him anymore.\nThen, finally, a week later he takes the vows he\u2019s been building up to take for a decade, and becomes Godaime Hokage.\nNatsu is at his side, beaming with his ring on her finger. He\u2019s not going to do this alone, he has Natsu \u2013 his best friend, the smartest woman he knows, and his wife at his side.\nHe puts the hokage hat on his head. The crowd of villagers and ninja cheer, but he only has eyes for Natsu. Her eyes shine with pride and love, and this life is a happiness he never thought he\u2019d have. He\u2019s not scared anymore."
