    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nyou can\u2019t hold on to the thrill   so I hope you find your will to follow through (what we invented I am now ending)\n\u00a0\n Watching Lydia sink to the filthy concrete floor, cradling Jackson like the dirt and the blood and the slick sweat don\u2019t mean anything, like there\u2019s nothing that can stop her from sharing those last few breaths with him \u2013 it does something to Stiles. Does something to his ribs, maybe, makes them brittle and sharp, curling in a little tighter and pinching his lungs, his heart. Later he\u2019ll feel a little selfish about it; Lydia and Jackson are playing out their Satine and Christian horror story and Gerard\u2019s mostly-dead, completely-disgusting body is gone, Peter\u2019s apparently risen from the dead and Derek\u2019s got this look on his face like he\u2019s finally realizing he lost whatever tentative control he had. All Stiles cares about is that whatever fleeting chance he might have thought he had with Lydia has quite literally been given the kiss of death. The stubborn streak that dominates the majority of his personality wants to refuse, but Jackson's not so dead after all, and he's looking at Lydia like she hung the moon and personally arranged the stars around it, and Stiles thinks this might be what the captain of the Titanic felt like when his unsinkable ship was well and truly sunk. His departure is exponentially less dramatic than his arrival. There are shifty-eyed looks from Isaac and Scott is pointedly avoiding Derek's clearly betrayed expression. Allison's trigger-happy fingers are laced through Scott's, and Peter\u2019s got a whole, fully functioning body again, and it all clearly screams that Stiles has missed a ton, has missed at least three major plot twists before crashing through the wall, and he could not give less of a fuck. He shuffles his way through the motley crew of bodies, stalks passed Chris Argent (and seriously, what), slams the door on his relatively unscathed Jeep and drives away. If anyone tries to stop him - well, Stiles doesn't have werewolf superhearing, and he makes a point of driving with his stereo cranked to top volume.\nHis bed is the best thing he's ever experienced in his entire life, and a delivery of hot-from-the-microwave Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle before his dad heads to work Saturday afternoon is enough to ensure Stiles doesn't have to leave the warm, safe confines of his well-worn comforter for at least another few hours. The low battery warning on his phone stopped beeping hours ago, the dull throbbing radiating from his temple and the iron-metallic taste from the split lip he keeps accidentally biting open is more than enough for him to claim illness, more than enough for him to pull the covers back over his head and ignore the bright, sunlit Saturday afternoon and the eight missed calls from Scott.\nSunday follows a similar pattern, and he doesn't go to school on Monday either, though he does begrudgingly get out of bed for more than just a trip to the bathroom. The bruise on his cheek has settled into an ugly, mottled purple thing, the blood seeping further down toward his jaw and sinking into the fleshy apple of his cheek. Stiles finds it hard enough to suffer his dad\u2019s empathetic wince every time he sees it; he has no interest in the half a dozen lies he'll have to spread to explain it away at school. Besides, any post-victory fame he might've been granted would undoubtedly be overshadowed by Jackson's death, or maybe his resurrection, and really that's just another set of lies Stiles will have to spin, and he's so tired of lying.\nBy Monday night, though, his father\u2019s getting that pursed look around his mouth, the one that says they either need to move on or talk about it, and Stiles emphatically Does Not Want to talk about it. So when Tuesday morning rolls around he dutifully gets back in his Jeep and drives himself to school.\u00a0\nBecause the universe is actually shit the very first person Stiles sees on campus is Isaac, leather clad and surprisingly short two-thirds of his usual entourage. He gives Stiles a long, uncomfortably appraising look, nods definitively, and promptly walks away without a word. Well. Huh. Fine.\nAnd, because things stopped making sense in his life even before he stopped giving a shit, the first person to drop down into the empty seat next to him in AP World, blink a lingering look at his bruised cheekbone, and open his mouth, is Danny Mahealani.\u00a0\n\u201cSo before Jackson left he said I should come find you. That you\u2019d tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says back. Danny\u2019s already giving him an exasperated, what did I do to deserve you look, like he doesn\u2019t fully appreciate the brevity of what he\u2019s just said to Stiles. This, of course, is probably because he doesn\u2019t. \u201cJackson\u2026left?\u201d Stiles starts with the easiest option. Maybe some people didn\u2019t spend the last four days of their lives hiding in a bubble of fuck off under their makeshift blanket fortress of solitude. \u201cYou really did check out for the last few days, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Danny frowns back at him. \u201cJackson\u2019s like, gone gone. Something about being mistakenly pronounced dead by the paramedics and the Whittemores avoiding a scandal \u2013 the entire family\u2019s shipped themselves off to \u2018visit relatives\u2019 on the East Coast.\u201d He makes air quotes and everything, like it isn\u2019t obvious enough that Danny doesn\u2019t believe the half of it. \u201cWhat, you mean they can\u2019t just pay it all to go away?\u201d Stiles grumbles back. The longsuffering look Danny gives him explains just some of how the kid\u2019s managed to put up with Jackson and his own personal brand of douchebaggery for all these years. \u201cFine,\u201d Stiles relents. \u201cSo Jackson\u2019s skipped town. And he told you what now?\u201d \u201cThat you\u2019d explain everything,\u201d Danny repeats. \u201cAnd he put a stupidly heavy emphasis on everything, like he thought maybe I didn\u2019t notice the monumental amounts of bullshitting going on around here lately.\u201d \u201cRight, okay,\u201d Stiles nods absentmindedly, fidgeting with the unraveling spiral binding on his notebook. \u201cAnd Jackson nominated me for the job because\u2026\u201d\nDanny shrugs. \u201cHe said of all the freaks at the circus you're the least freaky. Also if you tell me everything, full disclosure, he'll get Mr. Whittemore to tell the Sheriff that the kidnapping thing was a retaliation in a prank battle he started, and he'll get his dad to repeal the restraining order.\u201d\nStiles exhales a long, slow breath of air he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding. That would be\u2026well, it wouldn\u2019t exactly repair his completely crumbling relationship with his dad, and it wouldn\u2019t do much in terms of the Sheriff\u2019s job, since he already got that back on his own, but it was something. A big something. And whether it was an olive branch from Jackson or a bargaining chip, or maybe both, it was enough for Stiles to nod a little more decisively this time.\u00a0 \u201cFine,\u201d he agrees. Danny looks expectant, like he\u2019s waiting for Stiles to start talking right this very second, and Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cNot here,\u201d he hisses. \u201cJesus Christ, you want me to explain at least ten different dead bodies, plus the inexplicable resurrection of two more, and you think I\u2019m going to do it in the middle of our World History classroom?\u201d There\u2019s a great battle of warring expressions on Danny\u2019s face, like he\u2019s not quite sure if he\u2019s intrigued, disbelieving, or already seriously second guessing his decision to come anywhere within twenty feet of Stiles. He settles on something that looks vaguely interested enough while still maintaining a healthy level of suspicion. Stiles doesn\u2019t care. Danny can believe him or not, doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to him one way or another. \u201cAfter school,\u201d he tells Danny. \u201cMy house.\u201d Danny makes a face like it\u2019s the last place he\u2019d like to be, but Stiles isn\u2019t having this conversation in public. He\u2019s still reeling from the feel of rough hands yanking him into the dark, of Scott conspiring with Gerard Argent, of Peter fucking Hale standing at Derek\u2019s back like he\u2019d never been a smoldering corpse buried under a pile of rotting wood. They\u2019re having this conversation on Stiles\u2019 terms or not at all. He tugs his hood up over his head, because it\u2019s hard to signal the definitive end of a conversation when you\u2019re sitting at adjacent desks and class is about to start, and the movement triggers something in Danny. His eyes slide back over to the barely-concealed bruise spreading down the left half of Stiles\u2019 face, and his disgruntled expression shifts to something softer, something more conciliatory. \u201cOkay, sure,\u201d he agrees. \u201cAfter school.\u201d\n He makes a point of not looking for her, which is why it takes Stiles until last period to figure out that Jackson isn\u2019t the only conspicuous absence today. Lydia, as far as Stiles can remember, has never missed a math class for anything less than being bedridden at the hospital or PTSD from a fugue state, so he doesn\u2019t blame himself for jumping to the worst possible conclusions. It\u2019s only after he\u2019s calmed down from the initial panic of werewolf Jackson Peter Hale Gerard Argent\u2019s missing body does he consider the much, much worse possibility that Jackson, fresh-made werewolf who clearly anchored himself the same way Scott did with Allison, might have taken Lydia with him.\u00a0 He dismisses that one almost as quickly. Lydia might love Jackson, but he thinks maybe she might love her perfect GPA more \u2013 Lydia may wind up absconding to the East Coast too, but it won\u2019t be for another two weeks, not until after school\u2019s out for the summer. Which means she\u2019s here, fresh off what was undoubtedly a traumatic weekend, without Jackson. Interesting. He\u2019s still considering it, distracted as he heads out towards his car after class, when he promptly gets waylaid by Scott. \u201cDude,\u201d Scott pouts aggressively at him, brows furrowed as he narrows his eyes at Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Stiles shrugs. Hiding. Ignoring Scott\u2019s progressively more incessant texts and phone calls and, eventually, Stiles\u2019 cell phone charger. Avoiding everything that existed outside of his bedroom. Pointedly staying away from anyone who was going to look at Stiles\u2019 face the exact way Scott is right now. \u201cSeriously, I have like a million things to tell you, there\u2019s like massive amounts of clean up to do, and we still haven\u2019t found Gerard\u2019s body \u2013\u201d \u201cAnytime now, Stilinski, it\u2019s not like I had anything else to do today.\u201d Scott looks baffled at the sudden appearance of Danny at Stiles\u2019 side, but Stiles does his best to play it off like he was totally in on this plan. \u201cYeah yeah, keep your pants on,\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes. He turns to interrupt Scott before whatever\u2019s building up in Scott\u2019s half-open mouth makes its way out. \u201cYou working tonight?\u201d \u201cUntil 8:00,\u201d Scott nods, clearly about to protest. \u201cBut \u2013\u201d \u201cCool, come over after,\u201d Stiles cuts him off. \u201cI\u2019ll even feed you, if you promise not to smell like wet dog when you get there.\u201d The promise of food, combined with the confusion of watching Stiles walk away with Danny, of all people, seems to be enough to temporarily placate Scott. At least he doesn\u2019t follow them, which is good enough for Stiles. He waits until Danny\u2019s actually climbing into the passenger seat of his Jeep to raise an eyebrow at the other teen. \u201cI don\u2019t have a car,\u201d he reminds Stiles. \u201cAnd my ride\u2019s left town. Besides, you looked like you needed the save.\u201d There\u2019s really not much to argue there, so Stiles doesn\u2019t bother. They drive in silence, and if Danny finds it strange that the most notorious loud-mouth rambler of their class doesn\u2019t have so much as a single word of small talk to make, he doesn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019s surprisingly patient, actually, quietly following Stiles into the kitchen and leaning against the counter while Stiles digs through the fridge. Stiles considers the possibility that Danny might not have expected him to agree so easily, that Stiles might not have been so willing to let him in on the secrets they\u2019ve obviously been keeping from him. Danny\u2019s not stupid, there\u2019s no doubt in Stiles\u2019 mind that Danny\u2019s known there\u2019s a lot Jackson wasn\u2019t telling him for a while now. If Scott hadn\u2019t told him \u2013 if Derek had gotten there first, before Stiles got involved, would Stiles know? Or would he be in the same seat as Danny, helplessly watching his best friend fall further and further into something dark and dangerous, something they couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about. Would it have been better, that way? If he didn\u2019t know? \u201cI\u2019m only going to warn you once,\u201d he says quietly to Danny, dropping two plates of sandwiches on the kitchen table and gesturing Danny towards an empty chair. \u201cThis is one of those things that once you know, you know, and there\u2019s no going back. You can\u2019t unknow, or unsee, and it\u2019s not exactly a picnic in the park.\u201d \u201cAre you offering me the blue pill?\u201d Danny asks, the corner of his mouth lifting in a halfhearted smirk. \u201cOn a better day I\u2019d fall a little bit in love with you for that,\u201d Stiles tells him solemnly. He\u2019s only half kidding. \u201cBut yeah. Exactly. Blue pill\u2019s gonna mean a lifetime of knowing your best friend\u2019s lying to you \u2013 to protect you, to keep you safe, but still lying. Red pill means you\u2019re gonna spend the rest of your life lying to your family, your other friends, and yourself. A lot of lying.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll know the truth,\u201d Danny counters. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d \u201cAbout why Jackson left, and why Lydia\u2019s a wreck,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cHow Scott and Isaac Lahey turned into overnight lacrosse stars, and why the Argent family\u2019s been decimated by more than half in less than a month.\u201d Danny processes for a minute, focusing most of his attention on the untouched sandwich in front of him. Stiles lets him think, fusses with his own sandwich, rearranging the two slices of bread until the corners are perfectly aligned. \u201cDoes it also have anything to do with why your cousin Miguel bears a striking resemblance to Derek Hale, who you may or may not have been harboring illegally from your own dad?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t bother holding back the laugh \u2013 it\u2019s as devoid of actual humor as any laugh could possibly be, bitter and sharp and oh, does it ever have to do with Derek fucking Hale. \u201cLast chance,\u201d he warns, leveling his gaze on Danny. Danny looks back unflinchingly, holding Stiles\u2019 stare before nodding firmly. \u201cRed pill.\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cDanny,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cwhat do you know about werewolves?\u201d\n Danny takes it surprisingly well, considering a. Stiles has absolutely no physical evidence to back it up and, b. apart from sounding like a mash up of a bad teen romance novel and a eighties teen comedy, the story also includes Danny\u2019s best friend brutally attacking and murdering an alarming number of people, including Danny himself.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of silence again as Stiles drives Danny home, but that\u2019s probably reasonable. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Besides, Stiles just talked more in an hour than he had in the last four days \u2013 he\u2019s content with the break, with the silence. \u201cListen,\u201d there is one last thing, though, just to be sure. \u201cIt kind of goes without saying\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Danny shakes his head vehemently. \u201cEven if they actually believed me, I\u2019m not stupid. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d \u201cI trust you,\u201d Stiles shrugs. It\u2019s a lie; he doesn\u2019t at all. It\u2019s nothing to do with Danny, really \u2013 Stiles has had a very rough and fast lesson in trust recently, and maybe Danny\u2019s done nothing to lose Stiles\u2019 trust, but he\u2019s done nothing to earn it either. Danny doesn\u2019t call him on it, just issues a low goodnight as he slams the Jeep\u2019s door shut behind him. Stiles waits until Danny\u2019s let himself in the front door, a lesson he\u2019d learned from his mother, and Scott\u2019s frequent inability to remember his house key (there\u2019s more than one reason Stiles has his own key). And much like when you speak of the Devil, Scott\u2019s sitting on Stiles\u2019 front stoop when he pulls the Jeep into the driveway, chin in his hands and elbows on his knees like Scott couldn\u2019t get into the house effortlessly on his own. It sparks a little something low and deep in the pit of Stiles\u2019 stomach, something like hesitation or wary; it\u2019s been years since Scott\u2019s felt uncomfortable at the Stilinski\u2019s. \u201cDeaton let me off early,\u201d Scott offers, pushing himself upright as Stiles walks slowly up to the stoop. \u201cYou could\u2019ve let yourself in,\u201d Stiles reminds him, stepping around Scott and nodding at the front door. \u201cOr did you lose your keys again?\u201d \u201cNope. I just didn\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d There\u2019s a sheepish expression on Scott\u2019s face when Stiles turns a narrow-eyed gaze his way. \u201cI \u2013 uh \u2013 might\u2019ve talked to your dad. He said you\u2019ve been a little jumpy since Friday, and I didn\u2019t want you to freak out when you thought you were coming home to an empty house and found a werewolf there instead.\u201d The warning in Stiles\u2019 gut fades almost completely, replaced by a low burn of guilt that he\u2019d been suspicious of Scott. That was surprisingly considerate of his best friend, especially considering the way Stiles completely and undeniably would have gone batshit crazy if he thought he was facing another threat so soon. \u201cWhen\u2019d you see Dad?\u201d He focused his attention on unlocking the door, counting on Scott to accept the shift in subject without question. \u201cI ran into him on Sunday when he was on patrol,\u201d Scott explains, shuffling in behind Stiles and locking the front door again behind him. \u201cHe asked me about what happened to you after the game, but I told him I didn\u2019t know, that I hadn\u2019t seen you.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t completely a lie,\u201d Stiles offers, because he knows Scott feels just as guilty about lying to their parents as he does. He hasn\u2019t had much time yet to explore the bitter feeling of knowing that Ms. McCall was in on the secret now, that Scott didn\u2019t have to hide things from her anymore. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Scott shoulders Stiles further down the hall until they\u2019re firmly in the brightly lit kitchen, snagging Stiles\u2019 jaw between two carefully human fingers and tilting his injured cheek closer for Scott\u2019s inspection. Stiles lets him survey the damage without complaint. It was something of a werewolf thing, he\u2019d realized. Scott, and even Derek to a degree, had an uncomfortable habit of not trusting his own assessment of his injuries, of needing to observe them for themselves. Maybe not just a werewolf thing \u2013 maybe a pack thing, because Stiles was nothing if not Scott\u2019s pack. \u201cSo what did happen?\u201d Scott finally asks, releasing his light grip on Stiles\u2019 chin with a satisfied but deeply unhappy look on his face. \u201cGerard,\u201d Stiles offers, turning away before he can see Scott\u2019s reaction. \u201cApparently old age made him forget how to use pen and paper, maybe a phone, because he thought this was the best way to send a message to the pack. Well. That and stringing Erica and Boyd up with electrified wire.\u201d \u201cChris let them go. As far as I know they haven\u2019t come back though \u2013 Isaac said they were leaving.\u201d There\u2019s a long conversation ahead of them, and Stiles wants nothing more than to crawl back into his bed, recharge under the safety of his comforter and pretend that werewolves were still just an annoying-but-slightly-less-popular-than-vampires side effect of the Twilight phenomenon and maybe some really, really bad CGI in everything from Underworld to Harry Potter. He knows from experience with that particular expression on Scott\u2019s face, though, that that\u2019s not happening for at least another few hours, and regardless of how much Stiles is Not in the Mood, they\u2019re going to talk now. So they compare notes. Scott tells him about the plan he and Deaton had concocted against Gerard and how he formally declared his intent to stay separate from Derek\u2019s pack. Stiles tells him about the Argent\u2019s basement, Jackson\u2019s sudden relocation, and Danny\u2019s newfound knowledge. They don\u2019t talk about Allison, or Lydia. They don\u2019t talk about Isaac, who Stiles couldn\u2019t help but notice spent most of the school day at Scott\u2019s right shoulder, a position Stiles knew was werewolf code for Second in Command. They don\u2019t talk about Derek, or Peter, who neither of them have seen or heard from since they left the warehouse Friday night. Those, Stiles suspects, are all completely separate, heavily weighted conversations that he just can\u2019t handle right now. Scott, years and years of practice under his belt, doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. He cleans up the plate of leftovers Stiles had dutifully provided him with, takes one last lingering look at the wrecked surface of Stiles\u2019 face, and lets himself out the back door. For significant lack of better option, and because really, what control does he actually have, Stiles lets the week progress much the same way as Tuesday. School is a study in avoiding other people, which Stiles never would have assumed to be as difficult as is, considering six months ago he had exactly one friend. Erica and Boyd are still missing, Jackson\u2019s gone and Lydia hasn\u2019t been at school yet this week, but Isaac is everywhere, and so is Scott. Danny pops up when Stiles least expects him to, like he\u2019s not quite sure where they stand but wants to maintain open lines of communication with Stiles for when he eventually makes up his mind. Even Allison seems to be steadily hovering in his peripheral vision, always silent and withdrawn, deadly pale and looking for all the world like she\u2019d rather be anywhere than here. That, at least, Stiles can relate to. Scott and Allison are broken up for real these days. It takes Stiles less than half of Wednesday to figure that one out, and while he feels for the quiet heartbreak he knows his best friend is suffering, he can\u2019t bring himself to feel all that bad about it. Not entirely for nothing, and maybe not without some provocation, but Stiles did manage to glean enough information from Gerard to learn that Allison had been the one to unflinchingly shoot down and capture Boyd and Erica, and that she was fully aware of what was happening to them, at least, if not Stiles, in the basement of her own house. Still, they don\u2019t talk about it until Friday, until Stiles is back in his room, hood of his oversized lacrosse sweatshirt up over his head and attention firmly devoted to blowing the shit out of things in his latest RPG effort. He ignores the first call because he doesn\u2019t notice it, the second because he doesn\u2019t care, but the third attempt, a text this time, is enough for Stiles to pause and reach over for his phone.allisons leaving 4 smmer not cming bck til spt!!! :( He\u2019s a good enough friend (read: feels guilty enough for being a dick all week) that he finally calls Scott back, lets him ramble about their break-up, his declaration that he\u2019d wait for her, her finding him after school to tell him she and her dad were taking a \u201ctrip.\u201d It\u2019s not until much later, phone off and charging on his nightstand, laying in bed staring at the eerie outline of the snowboarder decal on the wall (that was going to have to go. Immediately.), when it occurs to him. Jackson was gone. Allison was gone. Lydia was suffering the aftermath of one hell of a few weeks without her best friend or her boyfriend there for her. And just like that, Stiles\u2019 planning instinct kicks it, without him even meaning to. Because obviously, obviously, standing around doing nothing for the last God knows how many years has done absolutely nothing for him in terms of getting Lydia\u2019s attention. The only times he\u2019s gotten anywhere close to it lately have been when he\u2019s stopped acting like a flailing boy with a crush and acted like they were friends. Or maybe not friends yet, but had the potential to be. Because if there\u2019s one thing Stiles is good at, it\u2019s being a hell of a good friend. Scott could vouch for him \u2013 Scott should take lessons from him. Stiles is totally the kind of guy you want in your corner if you were having a shit time of it; he knows those feelings all too well, has spent way too much of his time perfecting how to deal with them. He could be there for Lydia. In fact, he\u2019s the best person to be there for Lydia, because how many other completely human people in this town were in the know enough to be able to have unguardedly frank conversations about exactly what\u2019s been going on. He\u2019s perfect for that job, it was practically written for him. And if she got to know him, if Lydia really got to know Stiles\u2026 Well. It couldn\u2019t hurt.\n He wakes up and texts Scott. Texts Scott incessantly, a steady stream of get up get up get up at minute intervals until Scott finally responds to the fourteenth, WTF IM UP!?!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!? in all capitals. Stiles gives him some time to stew in it, leaving the message unanswered as he helps himself to a leisurely shower.were stdying 4 chem final he tells Scott twenty minutes later, shoving his feet into sneakers and grabbing his backpack off his desk chair. ur gonna pass if it kills me Scott texts him back a single k, most likely because he knows it drives Stiles absolutely batshit to waste a text on a single letter, but Stiles will take what he can get. He scribbles a quick note for his dad, just in case, and slams his way out the front door and into his Jeep. It\u2019s a quick stop at the coffee shop halfway between his and Lydia\u2019s house, and he doesn\u2019t bother feeling ashamed about the fact that he knows her favorite order, and he\u2019s standing on her front porch, precariously gripping two cups in one hand as he knocks on the door with his free fist. He\u2019s surprised when Lydia herself answers, even more surprised when she\u2019s standing there in oversized lacrosse sweatpants that could only be Jackson\u2019s and a worn camp t-shirt with a slit cut into the collar. She doesn\u2019t look that surprised to see him, and definitely doesn\u2019t look like she remotely cares about her current state of dress, just stands back and gestures him inside with a careless wave of her arm. \u201cNo, it\u2019s cool, I\u2019m just stopping by,\u201d Stiles tells her, and that elicits more surprise than his initial appearance did. Lydia levels him with an impatient look, and he holds up the coffees in defense. \u201cI come bearing ambrosia,\u201d he offers, switching his cup into his right hand and handing Lydia the untouched one meant for her. \u201cAnd also like serious amounts of apologies.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d Lydia accepts the paper to go cup with a substantially more serene expression, humming in approval after her first sip. She looks up expectantly when he doesn\u2019t respond, watching him shrug with sharp brown eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to yell at you like that,\u201d Stiles admits, wincing slightly as he remembers the way he flipped on her. She\u2019s already shaking her head, opening her mouth to respond, but he pushes on before she can speak. \u201cNo, seriously. It\u2019s not cool to snap like that, especially given everything that was going on, and I feel really bad about it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cIt happens,\u201d Lydia says dismissively, a weak smile flashing briefly from behind the rim of her coffee cup. \u201cLike you said, there was a lot going on, and you\u2019d just\u2026\u201d she releases the grip she still had on the doorknob to gesture loosely at Stiles\u2019 still-bruised cheek. \u201cWell. I\u2019d\u2019ve been a little on edge too.\u201d \u201cFair,\u201d he nods conciliatorily. \u201cAnyway, I also wanted to say that I heard about Jackson leaving. And now Allison too, after finals, and if last time didn\u2019t make you totally adverse to ever talking to me ever again, I\u2019m still here. If you have any questions about anything that\u2019s been going on, or if you just want someone around who you don\u2019t have to lie to.\u201d Stiles grins a slightly self-deprecating grin, and Lydia returns another tentative smile back. He makes a point not to push it \u2013 he\u2019s there to put the idea in her head and leave before he overstays his welcome. \u201cThat\u2026I might take you up on that,\u201d Lydia tells him, and it literally takes everything he has for Stiles to stop himself from a victory dance right there on the Martin\u2019s front porch. \u201cYou could come in, if you wanted. I was memorizing conjugations for my French final, but I could easily be persuaded into something else.\u201d Stiles has had countless dreams about this moment, Lydia bumping her front door further open with a little nudge of her hip and gesturing again for him to come in, but it is integral to his plan that he say no. Not playing hard to get, necessarily, but the drop-everything-and-jump-on-Lydia\u2019s-command doormat look hasn\u2019t been working for him thus far, so it\u2019s time to try a new tactic. \u201cI\u2019m actually on my way to Scott\u2019s,\u201d Stiles tells her instead, offering an apologetic half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to get him a passing grade on the chem final if it means literally teaching him morse code and tapping out the answers during the test.\u201d Lydia laughs, and Stiles bites back a grin because he totally made Lydia Martin laugh. \u201cOkay,\u201d she concedes. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly going to take all day, so I\u2019ll let you get to that.\u201d There\u2019s something a little sour in her expression though, a little sad and maybe a little lonely, and Stiles doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s just because Lydia must be craving any kind of social interaction after a week of self-imposed exile, he\u2019ll take the bait he\u2019s been offered. \u201cI was planning on going to the library tomorrow though,\u201d he says casually, \u201cbrushing up on all the books we\u2019ve read in English this year, maybe outlining a few of the potential essays Mrs. Donovan gave us.\u201d \u201cI was going to spark notes A Separate Peace,\u201d Lydia admits, \u201cI missed it when I was in the hospital.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty sure I have an entire notebook of notes on that one,\u201d Stiles tells her truthfully. They\u2019d talked about it extensively in class, talking circles around the overwhelming homoerotic undertone without ever actually getting there, and Stiles had filled half a spiral notebook with his own speculation on Gene and Finny\u2019s relationship. \u201cIf you can manage to decipher my completely shit handwriting, that is.\u201d \u201cSounds like a challenge.\u201d From her tone, it\u2019s clearly one that Lydia accepts. \u201cThe library opens at noon on Sundays. I\u2019ll bring the coffee?\u201d \u201cBlack,\u201d Stiles responds, tilting his mostly empty cup towards her. \u201cDon\u2019t let them put a single packet of sugar in it unless you don\u2019t mind hours and hours of incessant pen clicking.\u201d \u201cNoted,\u201d Lydia nods. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Stiles. Thanks for the coffee.\u201d He waits until he\u2019s at a red light half a mile away to let out a large congratulatory whoop for a job seriously well, well done. It takes Scott all of twenty seconds to notice the spring in Stiles\u2019 step, bounding up the McCall\u2019s front walk and bouncing on his toes as he waits for his best friend to open the door. Scott looks like he\u2019d gone straight back to bed the second Stiles stopped texting him, and Stiles shoves the bag of pastries he\u2019d also gotten at the coffee shop into Scott\u2019s already waiting hands. \u201cAre you high?\u201d is his first question. Stiles rolls his eyes, closing the front door behind him and elbowing his way into the kitchen while Scott digs through the pastries and shuffles along behind him. \u201cMy dad is still the Sheriff and would still smell pot on me in thirty seconds or less,\u201d Stiles reminds Scott, \u201cand so would you. Although I do wonder if you can get high. We should test that theory.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not,\u201d Scott mumbles through a mouthful of blueberry muffin. \u201cSo why are you grinning like Lydia just\u2026she didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles agrees, \u201cbut we are hanging out tomorrow.\u201d \u201cHanging out,\u201d Scott repeats flatly, and Stiles can feel the stern look his best friend has leveled at the back of his head. \u201cKeep your judginess away from me,\u201d Stiles scowls, batting one hand uselessly in Scott\u2019s direction. \u201cHanging out. We\u2019re going to be friends. I have a feeling Lydia could use a few more of those right now.\u201d \u201cAnd if, now that Jackson\u2019s been shipped off to Cape Cod, she happens to realize you\u2019re awesome and fall madly in love with you once she sees what a great friend you are\u2026\u201d Scott supplies. They\u2019ve been friends for far too long. \u201cEntirely her own doing,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cI heard it was Manhattan.\u201d \u201cI hope it was Antarctica.\u201d Scott throws himself into the chair next to Stiles, wiping his greasy fingers against his basketball shorts before reaching to tug his chemistry textbook across the table. \u00a0 They make it a solid two hours before the subject of Allison comes up, and Stiles manages to steer Scott back to the topic on hand in a record-breaking ten minutes. The fifth time they revisit the subject of her leaving, four and a half hours after they started and ten minutes after Stiles started quizzing Scott on how to read the periodic table, Stiles clears his throat and fixes his gaze on a spot somewhere over Scott\u2019s right shoulder. \u201cI think we should tell Derek.\u201d Scott\u2019s eyes flash gold, a low growl rising unbidden from his throat. Stiles does his best to hold his ground. \u201cI mean it, I think he should know,\u201d he insists. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you want him to tell us if something important was happening?\u201d \u201cDerek didn\u2019t even tell us things when we were actually working with him,\u201d Scott scoffs. \u201cWhy should we?\u201d \u201cBecause every time we try to keep secrets from each other we all wind up caught in a shitstorm of hell fire,\u201d Stiles says patiently, far more patiently than he actually feels. The entire afternoon has been an exercise in patience, to be completely honest. \u201cAlso, people tend to die.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to him,\u201d Scott insists, and it almost just borders on this side of a whine. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really interested in talking to you either, these days,\u201d Stiles shoots back. \u201cOr do you not remember adamantly declaring yourself Not His Pack after shamelessly using him as a deadly weapon in the master plan you didn\u2019t bother letting him in on?\u201d Scott has the grace to squirm slightly at that, but maintains his self-righteous look just like Stiles knew he would. Scott will go to his grave convinced he did the right thing with Gerard, and Stiles will go to his grave without ever pointing out to Scott how small it probably made everyone else, Stiles included, feel. \u201cFine, you tell him then.\u201d Scott sounds satisfied, like he\u2019s won, like he\u2019s certain Stiles would rather let the Argents leave and a thousand hunters take their place then voluntarily seek out and speak to Derek. Stiles, though, now that he\u2019s given himself the idea, is thinking more and more about what a good one it actually is. Scott\u2019s made his intent clear \u2013 he\u2019s his pack, omega at worst, pseudo-alpha to Stiles and occasionally Allison at best, and Derek and whoever\u2019s left with him are on their own. Stiles hasn\u2019t decided how he feels about that yet, whether or not he\u2019s in support of the permanent split and of Scott being his supposed Alpha, but he\u2019s growing increasingly more certain with each passing second that there needs to be some sort of truce between the werewolves in Beacon Hills. And maybe, possibly, that\u2019s where the token human comes in. \u201cOkay, good,\u201d he nods, \u201cI will.\u201d Scott opens his mouth to protest, and Stiles cuts him off with a question about how many electrons Potassium has. They make it another hour before Scott\u2019s eyes start glazing over, and even Stiles wants to cry at the thought of suffering through another chapter of notes, so they call it a day and spend a well-earned hour beating each other\u2019s avatars senseless on Brawl. Ms. McCall comes home in time to invite Stiles for dinner, but Stiles bows out, shooting Scott a stern and significant look as he insists he has an errand to run before heading home. He\u2019s honestly not sure where to find Derek \u2013 now that Gerard isn\u2019t a threat, would he have returned to the ruins of the Hale house? \u2013 but the train depot\u2019s closer to Scott\u2019s house, so he tries there first. He spots the Camaro a subtle two blocks away from the mostly-hidden back entrance, but the person waiting in the cleared out center of the warehouse isn\u2019t Derek. \u201cNo,\u201d Stiles tells Peter flatly, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at the newly-undead older man. \u201cNope. Absolutely not. Get out.\u201d \u201cHello Stiles,\u201d Peter replies calmly, smirking like he hasn\u2019t heard a word of Stiles\u2019 protests. \u201cNice to see you, Stiles. You\u2019re looking well. Murder agrees with you, I see.\u201d \u201cGet out,\u201d Stiles repeats, stubbornly ignoring him. \u201cI need to talk to Derek, and I\u2019m not doing it with you here.\u201d \u201cNow, it\u2019s awfully rude to show up uninvited at someone else\u2019s\u2026well, as reluctant as I am to call this place a home \u2013\u201d \u201cOut,\u201d Derek orders, stalking out of the half-shredded rail car. Stiles opens his mouth to protest when Derek tacks a sharply growled \u2018Peter,\u2019 on the end. Peter doesn\u2019t protest, merely holds up his hands in surrender and leaves the way Stiles came in without a word. Derek watches him go with narrowed eyes, holding up a hand when Stiles tries to speak again. \u201cI can still hear your heartbeat,\u201d he says, a conversational tone that Stiles is confident Peter can hear all the way outside. \u201cDo something useful like picking up the pizzas Isaac just ordered.\u201d The Alpha waits another minute or two before turning back to face Stiles, shifting the weight of his discontent until it\u2019s pinning Stiles in place. They blink slowly at each other, Derek poorly hiding his curiosity and annoyance while Stiles tests the limits of his welcome. \u201cSo I heard Scott\u2019s declared himself officially out,\u201d Stiles starts, because there\u2019s no better strategy than to piss the angry werewolf off from the very beginning of the already potentially volatile conversation. Derek\u2019s upper lip curls into something like a sneer and he doesn\u2019t bother to grace Stiles with a verbal response. It\u2019s not physical either, at least not in the form of shoving Stiles bodily into something, so he\u2019ll take that much as a win and keep going. \u201cAnyway, I think if there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve all learned it\u2019s that keeping secrets from each other, at least when it comes to secrets about people who are trying to kill us, you, and/or the general population of Beacon Hills\u2026well things don\u2019t really end too well for all of us. Or, I guess technically they do, but usually by some eleventh hour heroics that still leave behind a mostly unnecessary pile of dead bodies and bruised humans.\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes drift to the bruise still marring Stiles\u2019 left cheek, focused on ground zero, the pinprick of heavier marks where the blunt knuckle of Gerard\u2019s middle finger had hit. \u201cYou probably should have had this conversation with Scott,\u201d Derek points out. \u201cMaybe a few weeks ago. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing much for you now.\u201d \u201cFine,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. Except, for the record, Scott didn\u2019t tell me jack shit either. None of it. Not until after the fact. So you can act all betrayed and bitter and get revenge by not letting us know next time there are hunters in town until someone\u2019s already been shot by one, and I will sit here and judge the hell out of you for being petty and childish. Or you could be an adult for ten seconds and hear me out.\u201d Derek looks about a hair\u2019s breadth away from going Beta on him, which Stiles would really like to actively avoid because one, werewolves and two, he\u2019ll get entirely too distracted by questions like where\u2019d Derek\u2019s considerable eyebrows go and why doesn\u2019t he ever full on Alpha-out, and he doesn\u2019t have time for that. \u201cOr you could stand there and growl,\u201d Stiles amends, trying to sound braver than he actually feels. \u201cI can wait, it\u2019s cool.\u201d Derek reins it in just enough that his eyes are closer to their indiscernible rings of color than to the angry Alpha red, so Stiles takes a discrete breath and trucks on forward. \u201cI think we should agree to keep each other informed,\u201d he says quickly, determined to get out as much of his plan as possible before Derek starts protesting. \u201cAs informed as possible, as often as possible. A regular exchange of information during peace times, constant updates when something\u2019s going down.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Derek declares bluntly. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo you have trust issues,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cFine. In a delightful turn of events, you\u2019re no longer the only one with that problem.\u201d Something in Derek\u2019s expression twists at that, like he\u2019s not surprised but still doesn\u2019t like hearing Stiles admit it. He\u2019d overanalyze that if he could muster up the will to give a shit, but Stiles is on a roll right now and way too interested in giving Derek a piece of his mind to worry about trivialities like Derek\u2019s weird tics. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to trust me, that\u2019s whatever. Apparently I\u2019ve done nothing to earn it, so fine, do whatever makes you feel like you\u2019re still the one in control here. But this isn\u2019t about trust, this is about safety. The safety of your pack, and the safety of Scott\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWhy should I care about the safety of Scott\u2019s pack?\u201d Derek sneers back, voice harsh and sharp even halfway across the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve both made it clear you\u2019re not my responsibility.\u201d He has one card left, and out of everything he\u2019s played so far it\u2019s the one he\u2019s most reluctant to use. It\u2019s skirting the edge of downright cruel, especially if one or two of Stiles\u2019 more suspicious theories are accurate, but he\u2019s chock full of conviction that this is a thing they need to do, and if nothing else will convince Derek, well\u2026 \u201cThink about how you\u2019ll feel if something happens to Scott, or to me, because you deliberately withheld information. Can you bear the weight of another death on you conscience, Derek?\u201d Derek goes white. Stiles forces his sympathetic wince to stay internal \u2013 apart from just confirming that, at the very least, Derek feels responsible for more than his fair share of deaths, the look on his face is the closest to sheer horror Stiles has ever seen. They\u2019re quiet for a long moment. Stiles has said his piece, has said more than he wanted to, really, and it\u2019s on Derek now. Derek gets to decide where to go from here, to take Stiles offer or leave it, and Stiles is struck with the sudden weight of the situation. This is it. If Derek says no, if Derek turns him down, he\u2019s not sure that the two packs will ever fully repair their crumbling association enough to work together. \u201cI\u2019m not working with Scott,\u201d Derek says finally, quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you, that\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe a word that came out of Peter\u2019s mouth if it came with a notarized affidavit witnessed by you and my Dad,\u201d Stiles responds. Negotiations. He can do negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Isaac\u2019s loyalties lie anymore. He stayed for Scott, not for me.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s, either subconsciously or intentionally, assumed the stance of Scott\u2019s second, but at the end of the day he still talks about you like you\u2019re his Alpha.\u201d \u201cI still don\u2019t trust you.\u201d It hurts more than it should. It\u2019s not the first time Derek\u2019s said it, and even before that Stiles had his suspicions, but it hurts all the same now as it did back in the pool. Back when Derek had outright said Stiles was only keeping him alive to save his own neck, like Stiles hadn\u2019t stepped in to help Derek, groaning and grumbling but still unquestionably helping, half a dozen times already. It\u2019s bitter acid on an empty stomach, the sharp throb of trying to swallow over a ragged sore throat, of breathing under broken ribs. Stiles shoves it aside. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve made that abundantly clear.\u201d Derek looks at him like he\u2019s waiting for Stiles\u2019 confession of the same, but he\u2019ll be waiting a long time for that, because Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything. Derek is a walking lie detector, and Stiles would rather lie by omission than give Derek the satisfaction. \u201cThe Argents are leaving town,\u201d Stiles tells him instead, assuming the negotiation of terms has ended. \u201cNext week. Thus far it\u2019s just for the summer, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that became more permanent later. Also, Jackson told two people before he left. Lydia, who was already halfway in the know anyway, and Danny. He \u2013\u201d \u201cI remember Danny,\u201d Derek mutters darkly. Stiles bites back a smirk. \u201cShould I be worried about him?\u201d \u201cDanny\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Stiles defends, like he himself hadn\u2019t worried about Danny\u2019s loyalty. \u201cHe swears he won\u2019t tell anyone. I believe him.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say trust, and from the way Derek\u2019s eyebrows shift Stiles thinks maybe he might have picked up on that. If it\u2019s enough to concern him, though, he doesn\u2019t let on. \u201cFine,\u201d the werewolf nods. \u201cIf you have any reason to suspect otherwise, let me know.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first,\u201d Stiles responds cheekily. Derek glares at him. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn now.\u201d \u201cPeter\u2019s back,\u201d Derek says first. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d Stiles hisses scathingly. \u201cGo on, tell me more, this is such news.\u201d \u201cI have no idea what his angle is, but I don\u2019t trust him any further than I can throw him.\u201d \u201cWhich, werewolf strength and all, is actually probably a fair distance, so maybe you should consider a better analogy,\u201d Stiles comments, because honestly, this is the best Derek has for him? \u201cFine,\u201d Derek snarks back, \u201cI don\u2019t trust him any further than you can throw him.\u201d \u201cRude,\u201d Stiles mutters, \u201cbut admittedly more accurate. Do you have anything actually relevant to tell me?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another pack in town,\u201d and yeah, okay. That\u2019s relevant. \u201cSpecifically a pack of Alphas. They kind of \u2013 they consider themselves some kind of authority amongst werewolf packs, and the way the Alpha position has changed hands twice in three months, combined with the apparent reemergence of Hales back on Hale territory\u2026we\u2019ve drawn their attention.\u201d \u201cA pack of Alphas,\u201d Stiles repeats breathlessly. \u201cA whole pack of them. A pack of werewolves who are each equally as powerful as Peter was when he was mid-rampage?\u201d \u201cProbably more,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much about them yet. I\u2019ve been looking through some of the files Peter salvaged from the house, but\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can pull up,\u201d Stiles nods back, already considering possible combinations of Google searches that might actually turn up relevant information. He\u2019s halfway towards turning away before he remembers the last point he\u2019d wanted to bring up, turning back around into the searching look Derek was right in the middle of laying on him. \u201cDid you guys find, or move, or bury, or burn, or do anything to Gerard\u2019s body after we left the warehouse?\u201d he asks, filing away Derek\u2019s scrutiny to study at a time when it doesn\u2019t make his stomach turn over. The alpha shakes his head, frowning. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen him since,\u201d he admits, and he can tell right away it\u2019s not the answer Stiles wanted to hear. \u201cThe police have declared him missing,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping it quiet, last thing they need right now, considering he was the high school principal and all, but they\u2019ve formally declared him missing.\u201d \u201cAnd missing means they haven\u2019t found a body either,\u201d Derek guesses. Stiles lets himself out of the train depot, leaving Derek still standing in the center with the implications of that one sinking in.\u00a0\n Finals suck. Not because they\u2019re difficult; Stiles blows through them with ease, taking particular pleasure in his confidence that he got at least an A on Harris\u2019s chem exam, but because there is entirely too much down time in between them, and down time leads to thinking time.\u00a0 On the bright side, studying with Lydia is awesome. They meet up again on Tuesday so Lydia can help Stiles cram his short term memory full of math formulas, and Thursday afternoon Danny joins them as they quiz each other with 5 Steps to a 5 flash cards left over from the AP World History exam in May. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s easy, because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a study in patience and self-control, two things Stiles has never had much luck with, and every time Lydia\u2019s lips quirk in a smile directed his way, every time he earns himself a quietly appraising look, a pleasantly surprised wow, I didn\u2019t see that coming from you in the form of an arched eyebrow, he thinks his heart might actually beat its way right out of his ribcage. It\u2019s a small blessing none of the werewolves are anywhere near them \u2013 even Scott wouldn\u2019t be able to keep quiet about his smug amusement at Stiles\u2019 racing pulse. It doesn\u2019t help that Lydia, despite her surprisingly friendly attitude shift towards Stiles, despite the small smiles she frequently bestows on him, is surrounded by a perpetual air of quiet misery. It sits heavy on her shoulders, in the shadows under her eyes and the undertone of her voice, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. They haven\u2019t really gotten anywhere close to a place where he can call her on it, not without her breaching the topic first, and Stiles doesn\u2019t dare disrupt the tentative status quo they\u2019ve fallen into. It\u2019s camaraderie more than friendship, he gets that, but it\u2019s a start, and it\u2019s the furthest into his plan Stiles has ever managed to get, and he\u2019s not going to jeopardize that just because Lydia misses Jackson. Still, as much as they suck, he doesn\u2019t really know what to do with himself now that finals are over. His main excuse to talk to Lydia is gone, Scott seems to have fallen off the face of the Earth (and straight into the waiting arms of one Isaac Lahey), and of course now, now that the school year is over and summer looms easy and empty in front of him, now there\u2019s no sign of a supernatural crisis. The Alpha pack hasn\u2019t been heard from since they left their calling card on the Hale\u2019s front door, there hasn\u2019t been so much as a whiff of Erica and Boyd, and while Gerard\u2019s body hasn\u2019t been found, there hasn\u2019t been any suspicious activity to suggest he\u2019s still alive and wreaking havoc elsewhere either. Stiles would know, he\u2019s been checking. Like he said, he\u2019s been bored.  After the fifth failed attempt at coaxing Scott into hanging out with him five days in a row (\u201csorry man, Isaac and I are going to see how far we can run. I think he wants to see if he can track Erica and Boyd,\u201d because how is Stiles supposed to argue with that?), Stiles finally caves and texts Lydia.what do normal humans do w/o a supernatural crisis for fun?they go to parties Lydia texts him back almost immediately, and Stiles doesn\u2019t even try to pretend like that doesn\u2019t send a little thrill down his spine. like the one at katie chung\u2019s house tonight.only cool kids get invites to summer parties he reminds her, because Stiles is so not above playing the sad puppy if he thinks it\u2019ll work. Besides, he\u2019s not really sure what Lydia\u2019s implying, and honestly how lame would it be for him to show up if he wasn\u2019t supposed to.good thing I just invited you then. danny\u2019s DD tonight, he\u2019ll pick you up at 8:00. Well. That\u2019s that then. Apparently he\u2019s hanging out with Danny and Lydia in\u2026eight short hours. And maybe it\u2019s kind of the last thing he expected to happen when he texted Lydia, and he definitely didn\u2019t expect it to be that easy, but he\u2019s more than okay with it. Maybe it actually is this easy, ditching the overthinking and the second guessing and just kind of going for it. It\u2019s been a while since the last time Stiles actually put any effort into making friends \u2013 there was never a point, he had Scott and that was that, and Stiles had accepted the basic laws of high school stating that the asthmatic and the spaz were lucky to have each other and that\u2019s the best they were going to do. Then again, the laws of high school clearly say nothing about what happens when your best friend gets bitten by a werewolf and your worst enemy gets turned into a vengeful lizard and the gorgeous popular girl finally pays attention to you because all your mutual friends are somehow now fairy tale creatures. There are no rules for that. So huh. Maybe Stiles should experiment. He should have a friend in Derek\u2019s pack, he thinks, because that will make this information sharing game a hell of a lot easier. Derek\u2019s clearly out of the question, and Isaac\u2019s already taken\u2026it\u2019s a shame Erica\u2019s missing. It\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s crossed Stiles mind that he and Erica probably could have been pretty baller friends if she stopped power tripping for ten seconds. He\u2019ll make an effort with her, he decides, if she comes back. Allies are good to have, and there\u2019s no such thing as too many werewolves willing to have your back in a fight. Satisfied with his life plans, Stiles finds mindless ways to entertain himself for the afternoon \u2013 does the food shopping his dad\u2019s been putting off for a few days, kills some time painstakingly separating colors in his laundry instead of just dumping the whole hamper straight into the machine, takes great pleasure in cleaning out his desk and tossing all his school notes from the last year. The sharp, staccato beep of a horn announces Danny\u2019s arrival sooner than Stiles would have thought, which means he has no time to panic about his life choices as he shouts a goodbye at his dad and hustles out the front door. Lydia\u2019s already in the passenger\u2019s seat of Danny\u2019s Mom\u2019s Prius, window down and one arm dangling out. Danny beeps again, like he can\u2019t plainly see Stiles on the front stoop, and he thinks maybe this might be what high school is like for people who don\u2019t spend all their time pretending they don\u2019t care. \u201cGet a move on, Stilinski, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d Danny complains, but there\u2019s a good-natured grin on his face as Stiles deliberately slows his pace and leisurely opens the back door. Lydia had texted him again warning him not to eat dinner, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise when Danny pulls into Mel\u2019s Diner. Lydia nudges him towards one of the big round corner booths, already half full of juniors and seniors Stiles recognizes but has never, ever so much as spoken to, and yet each one of them nods when Lydia shoves Stiles in next to Harley Carter and says \u201ceveryone knows Stiles, yeah?\u201d \u201cHeard a couple of those Beavers caught up with you after Friday\u2019s game, Stilinski,\u201d one of the guys at the end of the table says, and unless he\u2019s seriously mistaken it\u2019s the starting quarterback of the football team. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to give them a little taste of what that\u2019s like next season.\u201d \u201cI think Stiles already took care of that,\u201d Lydia leans over, smirking conspiratorially at Stiles, \u201cyou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t know you had it in you,\u201d Anderson says approvingly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t kick their asses at Homecoming though.\u201d The guy two seats to Stiles\u2019 left whoops and offers his knuckles to Anderson, who pounds back like this is a perfectly ordinary thing to do. Stiles waits until they\u2019ve been dragged into a conversation about the football team\u2019s starting line now that the seniors are graduating before turning to Lydia. The feigned interest and amusement on her face is so painfully obvious that Stiles doesn\u2019t really understand how nobody else notices it. She catches him looking and her smile turns into something a little more genuine, and there\u2019s a sheepish tint to her expression as she offers him a minute shrug. \u201cTheir attention span lasts for a week, tops,\u201d she leans in close to whisper, long curls falling over Stiles\u2019 arm as she tilts her head towards his. \u201cThey\u2019ll only remember the interesting details, and the idea of you fighting back is much more noteworthy than you getting your ass kicked.\u201d It\u2019s a firsthand look at how Lydia got here, how a sophomore with no claim to fame other than striking good looks and an athletic boyfriend wound up at the same table as the most popular members of both the graduating and rising senior classes. She knows the game and plays it flawlessly, and Stiles is once again, as he always is, floored by Lydia Martin. They\u2019re actually there to eat, which Stiles shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by but actually kind of is, until Lydia notices the expression on his face when Harley, tiny enough that even Stiles could probably snap her in half, orders the chicken fingers entr\u00e9e with extra fries and not the salad he would have guessed. \u201cWe\u2019re young and dumb, but we\u2019re not stupid,\u201d Lydia tells him, rolling her eyes after placing her own order for a turkey club. \u201cKatie\u2019s notorious for providing more than enough alcohol, and nobody wants to be That Guy who ends the party early cause they\u2019ve got alcohol poisoning from drinking on an empty stomach.\u201d \u201cYou, Lydia Martin, are going to go far in life,\u201d Stiles insists, like that\u2019s news to anyone. \u201cDon\u2019t let her act like it was all her idea,\u201d Danny warns, cutting into Lydia\u2019s smug expression. \u201cSomeone over here spent the better part of Jackson\u2019s birthday party in the bathroom because she\u2019d been too busy organizing to remember to eat dinner, and ever since then Jackson insisted on mandatory pregaming at the diner.\u201d Lydia looks torn between annoyance that Danny spilled the beans and fondness at Jackson\u2019s uncharacteristic thoughtfulness. Even Stiles can begrudgingly admit that the other boy did right there. It wasn\u2019t a secret how much Lydia cared about Jackson, even before the kanima showdown, but this is a blatant and unfair reminder of how much Jackson cared about Lydia in return. Lydia\u2019s starting to get that look on her face again, the one that means she remembers Jackson\u2019s gone and isn\u2019t coming back anytime soon, and Stiles refuses to be overshadowed by a memory. He wracks his brain for a subject change, and before he can manage it one walks straight into the diner with an emphatic chime of over-the-door bells. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Derek Hale?\u201d Harley hisses on his left, and the entire table immediately falls into silence as everyone except Stiles makes the sudden and very obvious effort of peering around the corners of the booth. Stiles doesn\u2019t even bother; he recognized the leather (and seriously? It\u2019s June.) and the brooding before the door had even closed all the way behind him. \u201cGod he\u2019s hot,\u201d the girl across from Stiles whispers, and the two other girls at the table murmur their agreement. Danny, Stiles notices, is carefully silent despite the appreciative look on his face, and he\u2019s pleased to think that Danny remembers Derek can definitely hear them. \u201cHe\u2019s a murder suspect,\u201d Anderson grumbles, petulant displeasure obvious in his tone. \u201cHe was exonerated,\u201d Stiles mutters crankily, because he can still see the bitch face Derek pulled when Stiles had implied the exact same thing. \u201cExactly, suspect,\u201d one of the other girls repeats. \u201cBesides, they declared it an animal attack, and last time I checked he didn\u2019t have claws.\u201d Stiles slaps a hand over his mouth to muffle the hysterical laughter threatening to bubble over, and Lydia elbows him sharply in the ribs. Danny looks like he\u2019s not sure if he wants to laugh or run away, but Derek hasn\u2019t made any indication that he\u2019s heard them. He\u2019s got his back firmly to the group as he stands at the counter talking to one of the waitresses, and the staunch line of his shoulders is no tenser than usual. \u201cMmm, he might not have claws, but bet he\u2019s a total animal in bed,\u201d Harley leers, and she\u2019s literally sitting there with her chin propped up on one hand, eyes blatantly fixed on Derek\u2019s ass. Lydia\u2019s pointed elbow still digging into Stiles\u2019 ribs is the only thing that keeps him from slamming his forehead repeatedly into the Formica tabletop. Danny seems to have settled on some kind of panicky hysteria, and Lydia looks like she can\u2019t believe how completely unsmooth either of them are. Derek accepts a to go bag from the waitress and turns to his right, away from the door and towards their back corner table, and Stiles is pretty sure his stomach just hit the floor. The table once again goes painfully still and silent as Derek stalks right back towards them. He stops short when he\u2019s standing next to Danny, eyes on Stiles like the rest of them aren\u2019t even there, and Stiles can feel the weight of eight additional pairs of eyes on him all at once. Super. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Isaac in two days,\u201d Derek says, like there\u2019s absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about walking up to Stiles in the middle of Mel\u2019s Diner and jumping into a conversation without so much as a fancy running into you here. Jesus, and Stiles thought he was the socially awkward one at the party. \u201cHe\u2019s with Scott,\u201d Stiles grumbles, and Derek makes the same disgruntled face Stiles has been holding back all week. \u201cThey said something about going hiking, tracking, something like that. If you ask me Isaac\u2019s been watching way too many reruns of Lost on Netflix.\u201d He tries his best to give Derek a significant look while still not raising the suspicions of the eight high schoolers still staring at him. Derek\u2019s eyes flash red faster than a blink, and Stiles is pretty sure everyone else is too busy gawking at him to notice, but he thinks it was Derek\u2019s way of saying message received. Hopefully. He\u2019s starting to drift towards the uncomfortable edge of lingering, though, and the subtle nudge from Lydia lets him know everyone else is starting to realize it too. \u201cI\u2019ll let him know you\u2019re looking for him,\u201d Stiles tells Derek, tapping his fingers lightly against the cell phone he\u2019d left sitting next to his water glass, \u201cif I see him.\u201d Derek nods, and it\u2019s like the movement makes him suddenly aware of their audience. He nods again at Danny and Lydia, who look equally taken aback by the acknowledgement, and then completely floors all three of them by flashing a decidedly wolfish and completely panty-dropping (and shamelessly fake, though Stiles is certain he\u2019s the only one that notices) grin at the other half of the table. Harley actually, audibly sighs, and from the glint in Derek\u2019s eyes he definitely heard it. Stiles resists the urge to throw something at his retreating back. \u201cBye Derek,\u201d he mumbles under his breath, confident that Derek can hear him, \u201calways a pleasure running into you and your flawless social skills.\u201d He looks up again to find all eight pairs of eyes back on him, and it\u2019s slowly sinking in that the twenty-three year old murder suspect they\u2019d all just been gossiping about had just had an entirely too-familiar conversation with Stiles. \u201cOh look,\u201d Stiles says weakly, gesturing to the two waiters approaching with heavily laden trays, \u201cfood.\u201d\n Somehow Stiles manages not to make a complete ass of himself, some combination of a generous amount of Bacardi and his newfound conviction to make Lydia see him as something other than a pathetic spaz, and he finds himself back at the same corner booth a week later, this time sandwiched between Danny and Lisa Alvarez, twice more the week after, and three days after that at a picnic table in Danny\u2019s backyard, token Solo cup of warm keg beer in hand and the captain of the cheerleading squad snuggling into his hoody.\u00a0 He\u2019s not sure how he got here; he can\u2019t even put it on Lydia, since Danny was the one to invite him over and Lydia\u2019s clear on the other side of the backyard. Somehow he\u2019s at a table with four cheerleaders and the non-werewolf half of the lacrosse team\u2019s starting line, loudly debating the merits of convincing Danny to let them light up the fire pit, and he doesn\u2019t even hate it. The party winds down slowly, and Stiles isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s supposed to leave (and if he is he\u2019s walking, because he definitely forgot to remember that he drove himself here), but Lydia drops down next to where he\u2019s sitting with his bare feet in Danny\u2019s pool with a fresh beer for him, so he stays put. He wakes up in the morning with his face pressed into Danny\u2019s couch cushions in a way that he knows will leave marks on his cheek, the fingers of one hand dragging against carpet that seems much closer than it should be. Stiles opens his eyes and hates himself immediately; Danny\u2019s basement is dimly lit, but ugh. He isn\u2019t, as he\u2019d initially assumed, on the actual couch, but rather on the floor next to it, a makeshift bed cobbled out of the cushions normally lining the back of the couch. Lydia\u2019s on the actual loveseat, curled up with her hair over her face and her feet tucked into the crack between the seat and the armrest, Stiles\u2019 red hoody that she\u2019d reclaimed from Christina draped over her legs like a blanket. Harley Carter and Patrick Keegan, the other football player from Stiles\u2019 first night at the diner, are on the couch adjacent to Lydia\u2019s, and there\u2019s two unidentifiable lumps on an air mattress that Stiles has no idea how anyone even had the wherewithal to blow up. It\u2019d been Danny stumbling down the stairs that woke him up, although everyone else is still out cold, so Stiles drags his sorry ass out of bed, ignores the churning protest of his beer-filled stomach (though he does give in to the oppressive and completely overwhelming need to piss now right the fuck now), and shuffles out the back door to help Danny clean. \u201cDo you think werewolves have to deal with hangovers?\u201d Danny asks, holding three half-empty Solo cups as far away from his face as possible like he can\u2019t stomach the smell. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s so much as brought it up since the night Stiles dropped him off at his house. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure werewolves can get drunk,\u201d Stiles grumbles back, dumping the remnants of either beer pong or flip cup, or possibly both, and stacking the empty cups into a small tower. \u201cScott and I tried one night, after the first time he and Allison broke up, and he didn\u2019t even get a buzz.\u201d \u201cRight now I\u2019m jealous,\u201d Danny admits, \u201cI\u2019ll probably change my mind on that later though.\u201d \u201cIt depends entirely on how you look at it, I guess,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cOn the one hand, instant healing and the apparently inherited ability to pull off leather at all times. On the other, serious attitude problems and a suspicious disappearance of eyebrows.\u201d \u201cEven Derek\u2019s?\u201d Danny snorts, snatching Stiles\u2019 solo cup tower and tossing the lot into the garbage bag he\u2019s been lugging around. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of eyebrow to lose.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Stiles agrees, shooting three more cups into the bag like he\u2019s throwing a basketball. All three go wide, but Danny only rolls his eyes and scoops them up with his free hand. \u201cYou should see, it\u2019s so weird. Every time I want to ask him where they go, except he\u2019d totally eat my face off.\u201d \u201cThere are worse ways to die.\u201d Stiles must look scandalized, because Danny laughs and throws a cup at his head instead of into the bag. \u201cI mean it, I can think of worse ways to go than being ravaged by Derek Hale. At least the last thing you saw would be pure, unadulterated hotness.\u201d \u201cEating your face off,\u201d Stiles adds pointedly. \u201cWith boar-tusk teeth and creepy red eyes.\u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t deny his sexiness,\u201d Danny points out, holding the garbage bag open for Stiles\u2019 second and thankfully more successful attempt at sinking a stack of cups. \u201cConservative straight men wouldn\u2019t deny Derek Hale\u2019s sexiness,\u201d he scoffs, rolling his eyes. \u201cMy eighty-six year old grandmother probably thinks Derek Hale\u2019s sexy. Hell, dead people probably think Derek Hale\u2019s sexy.\u201d Danny gives Stiles a long, searching look that Stiles\u2019 alcohol-soaked brain absolutely cannot handle. He\u2019ll analyze it later, when he\u2019s not holding his breath as he wipes down the glass patio table on Danny\u2019s deck, trying to ignore the way the beer stench makes his stomach churn. Harley and Patrick step out long enough to thank Danny and tell him they\u2019re leaving, the two girls from the air mattress that Stiles does not remember the names of quick on their heels. Lydia comes out twenty minutes later, barefoot and swimming in Stiles\u2019 oversized hoody, but she drops herself into one of the cushioned lounge chairs by Danny\u2019s pool and declares herself \u201csupervising.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take that much longer to make the backyard presentable though, and Stiles and Danny haul the two trash bags they\u2019ve filled into the back of Stiles\u2019 Jeep after he promises to drop them in the dumpster behind the coffee house he has every intention of stopping at on the way home. Somehow Lydia needing a ride home turns into Danny wanting coffee too, which turns into all three of them back in Danny\u2019s lounge chairs, Stiles in a borrowed pair of board shorts and Lydia in a bikini she apparently keeps in her oversized handbag for exactly this occasion (and really, Stiles can\u2019t fault her for that, even if he could wrap his mind around Lydia in a bikini long enough to find girls weird). They\u2019re fighting off the last remnants of their hangovers with iced coffees and sunglasses, stretching sore limbs in the early afternoon sunlight, and it strikes Stiles that he\u2019s actually friends with Danny and Lydia. Which is, of course, when his phone goes off with a text from Scott.where r udanny\u2019smahealani?no the other danny we kno Lydia glances over at Stiles\u2019 derisive snort, eyes narrowing critically at the phone in his hand. \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d she asks, watching the way Stiles sighs at Scott\u2019s response of i dont kno ne other dannys??? \u201cScott has apparently noticed he hasn\u2019t seen me in three weeks,\u201d Stiles grumbles, and he immediately wishes it came out slightly less bitter. Lydia and Danny exchange looks, and Stiles knows without needing to ask that they\u2019ve noticed the same thing. \u201cI mean, we weren\u2019t going to bring it up,\u201d Danny says slowly, and it makes Stiles wonder. In the past he never really would have pinned Danny and Lydia as good friends, always assumed they were friends by circumstance, both popular and pretty and connected through Jackson more than anything else. He\u2019d assumed they were hanging out with each other lately for the same reason that they\u2019d been hanging out with him \u2013 Danny and Lydia both recently found themselves suddenly without a best friend, and if there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s learned about Lydia it\u2019s that even though she\u2019s friendly with what seems like every single person who shows up at any given party, she doesn\u2019t seem particularly close to any of them. Danny and Lydia, though, they\u2019re doing that thing where they talk over his outstretched legs without saying a word, Lydia\u2019s eyebrows and subtle twitches of Danny\u2019s expression speaking volumes, and he\u2019s thinking maybe he got it wrong. It takes years of friendship to get on that level of non-verbal. It kind of makes him wonder what he\u2019s doing here. \u201cWhat Danny means,\u201d Lydia says, like she\u2019s worried Stiles\u2019 distracted silence means he\u2019s offended, \u201cis that we didn\u2019t want to point out that you and Scott kind of have a reputation for being inseparable and lately you\u2019re not living up to that expectation?\u201d \u201cScott\u2019s been hanging out with Isaac,\u201d Stiles shrugs. He sends Scott a quick yea scott thats my point, and then adds, \u201cthey\u2019re being wolfy together.\u201d \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d Lydia frowns.since wen r u frends w/ danny? \u201cShould it?\u201d Stiles frowns back. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a werewolf, it\u2019s probably nice for Scott to have someone around who can keep up with him.\u201di didnt realize it was a big deal \u201cIt\u2019s just weird,\u201d Danny interjects. \u201cYou two are kind of like a package deal, you know? I mean, I can\u2019t tell you how many people see you walk into a party and ask me where McCall is.\u201dits not I just went 2 ur house and ur dad said u stayed @ a frends house last night and obvs it wasnt my house and wutever i guess im just surprised \u201cNews about Allison traveled fast, I guess? Everyone\u2019s favorite new lacrosse captain officially on the market?\u201d Stiles raises an eyebrow, both at Danny\u2019s comment and Scott\u2019s two texts, and Lydia\u2019s eye roll is visible even through her sunglasses. \u201cDon\u2019t make that face,\u201d she scolds him, \u201cjust as many girls ask me about you. Summer\u2019s a good look on you, people are apparently noticing that you have biceps now that you\u2019re not hiding them under three layers of flannel, sweatshirts, and jackets.\u201d Stiles buries the flush of pleasure that comment sparks under his annoyance at Scott. He\u2019s tempted to text him back that nobody else seems to think he\u2019s not good enough to hang out with Danny, but that\u2019ll lead to a conversation that frankly will take more effort than Stiles is willing to expend right now. \u201cWell then you\u2019re doing an absolutely shit job of sending them my way,\u201d Stiles teases, simultaneously typing a quick whatever whats up, \u201cyou\u2019re a horrible wingwoman and I think you\u2019re fired.\u201d \u201cNone of them have been good enough,\u201d Lydia says vehemently. \u201cI like to think at least some of us have standards.\u201d \u201cSays the girl in love with Jackson,\u201d Danny ribs, and Stiles laughs because he thinks he\u2019s actually allowed to. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that bitch tone,\u201d Lydia shoots back, \u201cI\u2019ve seen some of the guys you\u2019ve sunk low enough to consider.\u201disaac and i have news on erica and boyd, come over? \u201cHey, that last guy was kinda hot,\u201d Stiles defends Danny, thumb hovering indecisively over the reply button. \u201cThough clearly a dumbass for breaking up with you.\u201d \u201cSuck up,\u201d Lydia accuses. Stiles flashes a cheeky grin her way, and Danny laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous cause he\u2019d rather have me as a wingman,\u201d he teases Lydia.we think we kno where they r Stiles phone buzzes, like Scott\u2019s growing impatient with his lack of a timely response. Lydia looks pointedly at it, and Stiles takes a long drag from the iced coffee that is, by now, mostly half-melted ice. \u201cScott wants me to come over so he and Isaac can give me updates on their little woodsy adventures,\u201d Stiles admits, tossing the phone to Lydia. She shoves her sunglasses up over her forehead to perch them on the crown of her head, thumbing through the conversation with an entirely unimpressed expression on her face. \u201cProblem is I don\u2019t really care enough to move.\u201d \u201cTell them to come here then,\u201d Danny offers. \u201cYeah,\u201d Lydia nods, \u201cget the update on Erica and Boyd, plus the added bonus of blowing Scott\u2019s mind with the fact that you actually are friends with us.\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t protest, mostly because he\u2019s totally stuck on the matter of fact way Lydia says friends with us, and Lydia takes it upon herself to answer Scott. The exchange goes back and forth for a few texts, and Stiles makes a point of not being curious about what Scott\u2019s saying or what Lydia\u2019s replying with, just assumes that Lydia\u2019s smug satisfaction means Scott eventually agrees. Scott and Isaac let themselves in through the gate thirty minutes later to find Stiles and Danny arguing good-naturedly about the upcoming Spider-man remake, Lydia on a thickly inflated raft in the pool, holding on to the ledge so she doesn\u2019t float too far away from the conversation. When she spots Scott and Isaac, Scott frowning and Isaac looking like he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s allowed to be here, she pulls herself gracefully up off the raft and out of the pool without so much as getting her fingers wet, dropping down onto the edge of Stiles\u2019 chair and leaving hers open for the two werewolves. \u201cHey guys,\u201d Danny says warmly, like there\u2019s nothing remotely abnormal about either of them walking into his backyard, and Stiles bites down on a smirk. Lydia nudges at his leg until he takes the hint and drags his feet up the chair, letting her lean back against his shins. Scott stares like he\u2019s never seen them before. \u201cTrue or false, Andrew Garfield is going to be ten times the Spider-man Toby Maguire ever was?\u201d Danny asks, continuing the debate he and Stiles had been in the middle of. Scott blinks like he\u2019s not sure how to respond to any part of this situation, and Stiles could literally kiss Danny right now because he and Lydia are laying it on thick, and that\u2019s the kind of thing you do for your friends, and that means it\u2019s real. He\u2019s actually friends with them, nevermind that it\u2019s only been four weeks, really, that they\u2019ve known each other for years and Danny and Lydia have openly barely tolerated Stiles in the past. This is awesome. \u201cAt the very least he\u2019ll be ten times hotter than Toby Maguire?\u201d Isaac offers tentatively. Danny grins at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Lydia tells them, shifting her weight so Stiles\u2019 knees aren\u2019t quite so blunt against her shoulder blades. It\u2019s a lot of smooth, warm skin against his, and it\u2019s a more than sufficient distraction from the way Scott looks like he\u2019s swallowed a whole lemon \u201cA marathon and a midnight release is the only way to settle this,\u201d Stiles suggestions, and Lydia and Danny both agree so readily that even Stiles is surprised. Awesome. \u201cAnyway, we still have a few weeks for that. What\u2019s up with you guys, what\u2019d you find?\u201d Isaac immediately defers to Scott, and he\u2019s still standing at Scott\u2019s right shoulder, just behind him, like he still thinks he\u2019s Scott\u2019s second in command. Stiles has no doubt he is, really, except for the fact that he\u2019s pretty sure you\u2019re not allowed to be in two packs at once, and last he checked Isaac\u2019s still calling Derek his Alpha.are you allowed to be in two packs at once? he texts Derek, ignoring the way Scott suddenly seems to notice that coming all the way here meant Lydia and Danny were also going to be privy to his update. \u201cYou might as well just say it,\u201d he finally tells Scott. \u201cThey both know everything anyway.\u201d \u201cEverything?\u201d Scott balks, glancing at Danny, who shrugs nonchalantly in response. \u201cEverything,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cIf Jackson was still here they\u2019d probably be part of whichever pack he picked, so what difference does it make?\u201d Scott looks decidedly unhappy to hear it, but Stiles\u2019 attention is stuck on Isaac, who looks like the option of picking a pack hadn\u2019t occurred to him before now. Shit, Stiles so did not want to be the one to plant that idea in his head.no. he\u2019s going to have to pick one sooner or later. Great. \u201cWe found a trail,\u201d Scott says finally. \u201cAbout a week ago. Isaac had found one right after everything, but it went cold. And then we found the one again last week, and that went cold too.\u201d \u201cSo which part of that makes it noteworthy now?\u201d Lydia asks, and it\u2019s a completely valid question, but the way she says it is just so. Stiles nudges her thigh lightly with the side of his foot, and she tosses a challenging look over her shoulder at him. \u201cWe found another trail last night,\u201d Scott continues, a hard edge to his voice like he\u2019s talking right over Lydia\u2019s interruption, \u201conly this time we\u2019re pretty sure it was deliberate.\u201d\n \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Stiles prompts, frowning. He\u2019s already steps ahead of Scott\u2019s story, filling in dots from the last thing they knew about Erica and Boyd leaving to go find another pack, getting captured and then released from the Argent\u2019s basement, presumably following through on their plan to leave instead of running back to Derek. There\u2019s only two reasons why someone would deliberately leave a trail to two missing werewolves, especially when he\u2019s certain Scott and Isaac haven\u2019t been subtle in their search. \u201cWe found the cuff of the jacket Erica was wearing,\u201d Isaac fills in, pulling the scrap of black fabric from his back pocket. \u201cWedged between two rocks, like it was left there on purpose.\u201d \u201cSo either Erica ripped it off hoping you\u2019d find it and eventually her, or the Alpha pack has them and is trying to lure you into a trap,\u201d Stiles continues, sighing. Scott nods. \u201cYeah, I figured it was probably a trap too, but if it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t bother asking why Scott\u2019s so hell-bent on finding Erica and Boyd. Even if it wasn\u2019t important to Isaac, which it clearly is, some part of Scott feels responsible for Derek\u2019s Betas. He\u2019s been friends with Scott long enough, they don\u2019t need to talk about it \u2013 the guilt twisting Scott\u2019s face as he looks at the fabric in Isaac\u2019s hand is enough. \u201cWhat did Derek say about it?\u201d Stiles asks, and the looks exchanged between Isaac and Scott make him want to shove them both face-first into Danny\u2019s pool. \u201cWe came here first,\u201d Isaac admits. \u201cDerek\u2019s kind of, uh, mad at me?\u201d Even Danny rolls his eyes at that. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d Stiles mumbles. He plucks his phone off his lap and flips to Derek\u2019s last text, sending him a quick dumb and dumber have news on E&amp;B, should I send them your way or are you still firmly Not Speaking to Scott?I\u2019m already in town, are they still with you? I can come there \u201cSo, Danny,\u201d Stiles sighs, glancing up with the best puppy dog eyes he can muster. \u201cHow do you feel about having an alpha werewolf at your house?\u201d \u201cDepends entirely on whether or not he\u2019ll be putting on another performance,\u201d Danny drawls lazily, and Stiles and Lydia both laugh.yeah but we\u2019re at danny\u2019s, 48 northwood dr, just let yourself in the gate fine, 20 minutes \u201cI can\u2019t make any promises,\u201d he laughs before turning back to where Scott and Isaac are still standing with matching apprehensive expressions. \u201cYou two might as well sit,\u201d he gestures to the empty lounge chair Lydia had vacated. \u201cWell, since this is clearly about to turn into another party,\u201d Lydia pushes herself upright, turning to Danny, \u201cdid we actually tap the keg last night, or do we still have some we need to finish off.\u201d \u201cThere should be some left, Stiles and I dragged it into the kitchen,\u201d he nods. \u201cGet one for me?\u201d Lydia nods as she gets her feet under her, picking up both hers and Stiles\u2019 empty coffee cups. \u201cStiles?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d he shrugs, because why the hell not. Who knows, maybe Derek\u2019ll be just a bit more sufferable with a beer or two in him. Scott lowers himself into the lounge chair with his judgiest of bitch faces, and Stiles returns his stare with a particularly exaggerated frown. Scott\u2019s expression says nothing more than what the fuck, and Stiles responds with a half-hearted shrug and slight jerk of his chin in Isaac\u2019s direction. Scott glares like he can\u2019t even believe they\u2019re having this discussion, and Stiles rolls his eyes because honestly, Scott, it\u2019s really not a big deal so stop acting like it is. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t want, did you?\u201d Lydia asks, returning with three Solo cups balanced between two hands like she\u2019s had a lot of practice, frowning at Scott and Isaac like she\u2019s only just realized how rude it was to not offer any to the two of them. \u201cOnly, I kind of assumed werewolves couldn\u2019t get drunk.\u201d \u201cNah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Isaac assures her. \u201cAt least, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d Scott looks at Stiles like he\u2019s drinking straight poison when he accepts his cup from Lydia, and he knows Scott\u2019s not opposed to indulging in a drink or two, so Stiles can\u2019t help but throw his free hand up in exasperation and shove himself up off the lounge chair. \u201cScott, can I borrow you for a minute,\u201d he snaps, yanking his friend up by the collar without waiting for a reply. He leads Scott around to the grass on the other side of the deck, not far enough away that Isaac won\u2019t hear but far enough to at least give them an illusion of privacy. \u201cWhat is your deal,\u201d he hisses. \u201cWhat\u2019s my deal?\u201d Scott snaps back. \u201cYou\u2019re at Danny Mahealani\u2019s house, where you apparently spent the night after a rager, judging by the way it smells back here, drinking his leftover beer that Lydia Martin hand delivered to you, and you\u2019re asking what my deal is?\u201d \u201cYup,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cBecause the only thing I got out of that was Stiles, you\u2019re hanging out with people who aren\u2019t me and what gives?\u201d Scott gapes like a fish, and the flash of warm endearment is enough of a reminder that this is Scott, and even when he\u2019s being a jealously possessive puppy, he\u2019s still a damn puppy. \u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d Stiles sighs, all the fight going out of him in one fell swoop. \u201cYou knew I was studying with Lydia during finals week, and I told you about filling Danny in too.\u201d \u201cYeah but studying with Lydia and drinking day beers at Danny\u2019s house are two totally different things,\u201d Scott accuses, like Stiles hasn\u2019t noticed. \u201cYou were busy,\u201d Stiles mutters, and it\u2019s not an accusation, it\u2019s really not. \u201cI get it, I know you and Isaac are all bonding over wolfdom, and that you\u2019re helping him look for Erica and Boyd. I get why that\u2019s important to you, I do. But dude, you can only blow me off so many times before I take the hint and try somewhere else. I texted Lydia, and she and Danny brought me to a party, and it was fun, so the next time they asked I said yes. And here we are.\u201d \u201cTroy Murphy\u2019s party last week?\u201d Scott hisses, and he sounds like he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s annoyed or impressed. \u201cThe video of Ramirez falling down the stairs, rolling into a perfect somersault, and walking away like nothing happened? That went viral on YouTube?\u201d \u201cWas actually even better in real life,\u201d Stiles confirms, \u201cthe video cut too soon, he kept walking straight into the kitchen, puked in the sink as he walked by, and kept going back out into the backyard like business as usual.\u201d \u201cEw,\u201d Scott\u2019s nose is wrinkled distastefully, but Stiles knows when he\u2019s won, and he\u2019s almost there. \u201cDude, I know it\u2019s weird,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut it\u2019s kind of nice, you know? Nobody who might accidentally bite me if I piss them off, nobody shoving me into walls. Last night I spent two hours talking to a couple cheerleaders, and not once did they ask me if I was worried that Gerard Argent\u2019s body hasn\u2019t turned up yet, or whether or not I think Peter\u2019s going to try to kill us all again.\u201d Scott\u2019s wavering expression settles on something like guilt, and it seals the deal that Stiles has successfully smoothed this over. Score one for Stilinski. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Scott concedes, \u201cyou\u2019re totally right. And I\u2019m totally acting like an ass, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cDamn right you are,\u201d Stiles nods decisively, flashing a grin so Scott knows he\u2019s kidding. \u201cNow come on, if I lose my seat because Derek beats me to it I will shamelessly steal yours and you\u2019ll be the awkward standing guy.\u201d Scott makes a face like that\u2019s all the motivation he needs, and as they make their way back around to the pool side all three teens make quick and obvious attempts to pretend like they weren\u2019t trying (and in Isaac\u2019s case, probably succeeding) to listen in. \u201cYou guys are shameless,\u201d he tells them, dropping back into his chair and helping himself to a sip of his lukewarm beer. \u201cAnd this is gross, can\u2019t we pump it into a pitcher and stick it in the fridge or something?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Lydia volunteers. Danny just toasts his cup in her general direction, taking a long drag and making a face not unlike the one Stiles was still sporting. \u201cUgh, you\u2019re right,\u201d he nods. \u201cStill, my cousin\u2019s swinging by to pick the keg up when he gets off work, he has to return the tap by the end of the day, so we might as well finish it while we still have it.\u201d \u201cI really hope there\u2019s some secret special way for werewolves to get drunk,\u201d Isaac sighs, pouting at the Solo cup in Stiles\u2019 hand. \u201cI never did get around to it before I took the bite.\u201d \u201cStiles and I were talking about that earlier,\u201d Danny tells him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve come up with a theory. If it doesn\u2019t work because of your healing whatever skills, maybe you just have to be one step up on that.\u201d \u201cSo what, chug a bottle of Jack and hope it lasts longer than five minutes?\u201d Scott looks entirely repulsed by the idea, and Stiles remembers with a laugh the face Scott made the first time they\u2019d helped themselves to a sip of the Sheriff\u2019s whiskey. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to ask Derek,\u201d Stiles suggests, \u201cI have a feeling if there\u2019s a loophole in werewolf healing practices, he knows it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just feel like instant healing might make it difficult to get a tattoo in the conventional way. His body would push the ink back out just as fast as the gun pushed it in, and it would just go nowhere fast.\u201d Isaac and Scott both look faintly repulsed, like they\u2019ve never considered it before and now have to wrestle with the question of how exactly Derek managed it. The options are pretty grim \u2013 Stiles knows, he\u2019s considered them before. He knows when Derek arrives well before the Alpha shoves open the back gate \u2013 Isaac tenses up like he\u2019s just been caught sneaking into the girls\u2019 locker room, and Scott\u2019s face hardens into something that reeks of offense and irritation. It\u2019s not remotely a surprise when Derek lets himself in then, crossing the space between them with his immense displeasure at the situation rolling off him in waves. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Beacon Hills\u2019 favorite Alpha,\u201d Stiles teases, because someone has to break the tension. \u201cDrink?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have better luck inhaling the fumes from this backyard,\u201d Derek grumbles, and Stiles is very, very careful to hold back his reaction when Derek drops heavily onto the bottom half of the chair Stiles himself is sitting in. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky your parents aren\u2019t wolves,\u201d he tells Danny, raising an eyebrow at him. \u201cThat would probably make it difficult to get away with things,\u201d Danny agrees, making a pretty solid effort at sounding completely at ease. Stiles grins reassuringly at him. Derek turns away with a nod, like he\u2019s gotten the required niceties out of the way, and levels a searching look on Isaac, who shrinks away like he\u2019s being punished, and Scott, who glares right back and shifts closer to Isaac. If this dissolves into a territorial showdown between Alpha and Wannabe-Alpha Stiles is going to lose it completely. \u201cWell?\u201d Derek finally snaps, raising his eyebrows expectantly at the two Betas opposite him. Stiles hides his exasperation behind the rim of his cup, gulping down another long pull, because even lukewarm beer is better than nothing in this situation. Scott launches into an explanation that is both ten times more aggressive and ten times more deferential than his original one to Stiles, and as interesting a contradiction as it is, Stiles doesn\u2019t have the attention span to listen twice. He\u2019s staring at his thigh where Danny\u2019s shorts have ridden up a bit, trying to decide if he\u2019s gotten any kind of tan whatsoever today, when he notices the skin he\u2019s comparing his to is Derek\u2019s. Derek\u2019s enormous bicep, in particular, because Derek is not wearing his leather jacket. Derek is, in fact, wearing nothing more than jeans, sneakers, and a shockingly white t-shirt, and it\u2019s the least-imposing he\u2019s ever seen the Alpha before. And suddenly that\u2019s a million times more fascinating than his own tanning ability (because pale as he might be now, his mother was a hundred percent Italian, dammit, and he can occasionally be something other than pasty white). He\u2019s disrupted yet again by the arrival of Lydia, standing on the edge of the deck and glaring at Derek like he\u2019s a particularly bothersome gnat she\u2019d like to be rid of. Stiles has seen that look dozens of times before, most commonly when another girl made the horrendous mistake of attempting to flirt with Jackson while Lydia was around. And now she\u2019s glaring at Derek, like she\u2019s pissed he\u2019s stolen her spot on Stiles\u2019 chair, and holy crap does that hit like a blow to the gut. Lydia is getting territorial over Stiles. Like, visibly so, visibly enough that even Derek notices. He\u2019s staring back at her with an entirely bemused expression on his face, watching Lydia as she draws close enough to swap Stiles\u2019 mostly empty cup for a fuller, miraculously cold one. She settles down on the end of Danny\u2019s chaise, holding out a fresh beer for him too, and keeps her eyes on the back of Derek\u2019s head. \u201cIs that everything?\u201d he says to Scott, sitting forward like he\u2019s suddenly itching to move, to be anywhere other than that lounge chair or this backyard. Stiles tries not to feel too giddy about it. \u201cYeah?\u201d Scott shrugs. \u201cMostly. We just wanted to know if you think it\u2019s a trap or if we should follow it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not your Alpha,\u201d Derek growls \u201cYou\u2019re Isaac\u2019s,\u201d Scott protests, and Stiles wonders if Scott genuinely hasn\u2019t noticed. Of course he hasn\u2019t, Scott\u2019s not stupid but he\u2019s not exactly the most in tune with other people either, and Jesus, Stiles should have brought it up sooner. Preferably before Scott gave Derek the opportunity to kill him. Christ, they were going to have a hard time hiding the bloodstains from Danny\u2019s parents. Maybe Derek can smell the panic from Stiles\u2019 side of the chair, or maybe he just notices the way Stiles\u2019 heartbeat takes off in nervous anticipation of a fight, because he twitches slightly in Stiles\u2019 direction before exhaling slowly. The red fades from his eyes along with the rush of air, claws giving way to human fingernails, and he glances sideways at Stiles before turning back to Isaac. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Nobody makes a sound as Derek stalks back out the way he came, slamming the wooden gate hard enough behind him that the entire fence wobbles. \u201cI\u2019m moving to Hawaii,\u201d Stiles sighs, lolling his head to the side to give Danny a pleading look. \u201cDanny, tell me they don\u2019t have werewolves in Hawaii.\u201d\n His life falls into something of a pattern after that, but for the first time in a while it\u2019s a pattern Stiles can live with. Scott makes a point of seeing him at least once a week, sometimes with Isaac and sometimes without, and Stiles can deal with it. They\u2019re still going out almost every day, canvasing the woods for any sign of Erica and Boyd, but other than a few more scraps of Erica\u2019s jacket they don\u2019t find much in the way of a lead, and even those trails run cold after a few days.\u00a0 Derek, after the fiasco in Danny\u2019s backyard, firmly reinstates his policy of only communicating with Stiles. He shows up in Stiles\u2019 bedroom every Wednesday like clockwork, leaning against the wall by Stiles\u2019 window just long enough to admit he\u2019s got mostly nothing in the way of updates; Erica and Boyd still missing, Isaac still dancing the line between Scott\u2019s and Derek\u2019s packs, Peter still making nice like he doesn\u2019t have some ulterior motive, the Alpha pack still lurking in the shadows without making a move. Stiles tells him mostly the same back, Isaac and Scott have nothing to report on their daily hunts, Gerard\u2019s body hasn\u2019t turned up and the sheriff\u2019s department has no leads, everything seems suspiciously quiet. Derek\u2019s rarely there for more than ten minutes, and Stiles is more than content to keep it that way. He sees Lydia, or Danny, or Lydia and Danny, almost every day. The summer crowd seems to operate on some kind of rotation, like they\u2019ve compared notes to see exactly whose parents would be gone on which days, making sure there\u2019s at least two parties a week. He doesn\u2019t bother asking where the alcohol comes from, doesn\u2019t question how he somehow got worked into the cycle of designated drivers, and doesn\u2019t complain when he starts getting mass texts from numbers he doesn\u2019t recognize, invitations straight from the source instead of through Lydia or Danny. All in all, it\u2019s probably the best summer Stiles has had in years, really. His only complaint is the complete stalemate he\u2019s found himself at with Lydia, stalled out solidly in the friend zone with absolutely no idea how to push forward. He\u2019s completely certain they\u2019re definitely friends \u2013 real friends, like Lydia and Danny, or how Lydia was with Allison, and not just the friendly way Lydia breezes from person to person in various backyards. She calls him one afternoon while she\u2019s driving home from a trip to a mall forty five minutes from Beacon Hills, admitting when he finally asks that she didn\u2019t really have a reason, just wanted someone to talk to on the drive home, and that seals the deal for him. They\u2019re friends. Awesome. Now what? He\u2019s distracted by the sharp rap of Derek\u2019s knuckles against his window frame; Stiles isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d finally gotten the werewolf to announce his arrival, but it was a success on his part. He gestured for Derek to let himself in, closing his laptop and twisting around in his desk chair, and watches with no small amount of surprise as Derek drops down into the chair by his bed instead of bracing against his usual patch of wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, because the disruption in their routine can only mean that something\u2019s wrong. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything for a few long moments, and Stiles busies himself with trying to guess where the problem is. He\u2019d know if there was any update on Gerard, so it\u2019s not that, and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d have picked up on some weird news if the Alpha pack was making a move. Isaac and Scott are still predominantly manning the wolf-hunt front, which narrows it down to only\u2026 \u201cDo you ever talk to Isaac?\u201d Derek says finally. It sounds like the question takes a lot out of him, like saying it out loud to Stiles means he\u2019s officially admitting out loud that he has a problem he can\u2019t solve on his own, and Stiles is almost tempted to mock him for it. Almost, until he notices that somewhere under Derek\u2019s bristly exterior gruffness is something that looks like genuine concern, and maybe even genuine hurt, and that stops Stiles in his tracks. He\u2019s not above kicking a man when he\u2019s down, but only in the event that it\u2019ll somehow help Stiles. No point in doing it just for fun. \u201cLike, communicate verbally and without using Scott as a medium, or actually talk to him about substantial life issues?\u201d he clarifies, because he\u2019s still not completely a saint. Derek glares at him. \u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he growls. \u201cNo,\u201d Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNo, and I haven\u2019t talked to Scott about it either. The big stalling point, if I had to guess, is that for all his posturing Scott isn\u2019t actually an Alpha.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one of the problems,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cIf Isaac officially declares his allegiance to Scott it\u2019ll affect Scott\u2019s power. It won\u2019t make him an Alpha, only inheriting the title from another Alpha can do that, but it\u2019ll still give him a boost. In this case maybe even enough of a boost to take on one of the Alphas still lurking the woods here, at which point he actually would become a real Alpha with Isaac as his actual Beta.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still not sure if that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Stiles confesses. Derek raises an eyebrow and sits back slightly, like he hadn\u2019t expected Stiles to be anything but gung-ho about Scott\u2019s promotion, but Stiles just shakes his head. \u201cI do think Scott\u2019ll make a good Alpha. It didn\u2019t really surprise me that he turned you down, and Isaac\u2019s little hero-worship fixation doesn\u2019t either. I just don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ready for it quite yet.\u201d Stiles sighs, scrubs a hand over his head. He has no idea why he\u2019s telling Derek any of this, how they somehow landed in Bizarro World Confession Time instead of their usual perfunctory business-esque meeting. It\u2019s kind of\u2026it\u2019s nice, though. He has Scott for supernatural talk, Lydia and Danny for normal teenage human talk, but he\u2019s never had an outlet for problems. \u201cHe\u2019s sixteen,\u201d Derek nods, like that more than summarizes everything Stiles just said. It kind of does. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d Stiles argues defensively, \u201cI\u2019m sixteen, and I helped find and kill a murderer, got kidnapped and beat soundly by a grown man, watched a classmate die twice before miraculously coming back to life both times, and I\u2019ve saved your sorry ass more than once. Give the kids some credit.\u201d Derek makes a face like he sorely wants to protest, but there\u2019s the barest hint of a smirk that Stiles thinks means Derek\u2019s kind of amused. Hey, he\u2019ll take it. \u201cIsaac has to make a choice though,\u201d Derek insists, shaking his head and schooling his expression into something more serious. \u201cSooner, rather than later. He can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d \u201cHave you talked to him about it?\u201d Stiles asks. Derek looks at him like he\u2019s an idiot. \u201cNo, but really,\u201d Stiles protests. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t know what Isaac thinks. Maybe he thinks he has to choose.\u201d \u201cHe does have to choose,\u201d Derek says flatly, like Stiles hasn\u2019t been listening. \u201cI mean like, maybe he thinks that you\u2019re making him pick between you and Scott. Not as his Alpha,\u201d he says quickly, holding up a hand before Derek can interrupt him again, \u201cbut in general. Like if he chooses you as his Alpha he can\u2019t be friends with Scott anymore, and he\u2019s stalling on declaring anything one way or another because he\u2019s trying to prolong their friendship for as long as he can.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Derek frowns, and he looks kind of offended. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell Isaac who he is and isn\u2019t allowed to be friends with, that\u2019s not what being an Alpha is about. Scott\u2019s good for Isaac, I\u2019m glad he has someone to look up to.\u201d \u201cIsaac looks up to you,\u201d Stiles says carefully. He wasn\u2019t sure until after he said it, but he\u2019s pretty sure he hit the nail on the head considering the way Derek slumps like his whole body\u2019s just deflated all at once. \u201cHe does, do you really not know that?\u201d \u201cMaybe he did,\u201d Derek starts to protest, and Stiles almost immediately starts shaking his head. \u201cBut I\u2019m not exactly role model material, Stiles.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he insists. \u201cI know you know about Isaac\u2019s dad and everything, but did you know Isaac had an older brother too?\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cHe died,\u201d Stiles says simply, because it\u2019s not his story to tell. \u201cA few years back. I didn\u2019t really know Isaac, but, you know, big news, small town, you hear things. And I think maybe Isaac really needs someone who can be there for him like that. Obviously you\u2019re not ready to be anyone\u2019s father figure, but you\u2019ve got older brother written all over you.\u201d Something twists sharp and sudden in Derek\u2019s face, and Stiles desperately wishes he could backtrack just enough to take the end of that sentence back. It\u2019s all over Derek\u2019s suddenly agonized expression, and Stiles has read the incident reports on the Hale fire, he knows there were kids in the house. Of course Derek\u2019s older brother material\u2026he\u2019s been one before. \u201cDid you\u2026\u201d he says quietly, because he can\u2019t keep his fucking mouth shut sometimes. Derek squeezes his eyes shut and nods. \u201cMadeline was twelve,\u201d he whispers. \u201cBlake was only\u2026\u201dEight. Stiles mind fills in helplessly, because now that he\u2019s brought it up he remembers the reports he read. Both Derek\u2019s parents, his grandmother, two aunts and an uncle, the Hale\u2019s oldest son and youngest two children, and a baby cousin. A baby. \u201cI\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d Stiles mumbles, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026I\u2019m\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right though,\u201d Derek nods. \u201cIsaac could use\u2026Alex was four years older than me. He was an absolute shit half the time, beat me up just because he could, ganged up with Laura until I was an easier target than shooting fish in a barrel, and I still idolized the hell out of him.\u201d He glances up at Stiles, who\u2019s thunderstruck and mortified and kind of honored beyond all belief that Derek came to him with this, talked to him about it. Any port in a storm, maybe, but still. He\u2019s flattered, and maybe a little bit heartbroken. Derek kind of has that effect on people. \u201cTalk to Isaac,\u201d he says quietly, because he doesn\u2019t really know where else to go from here. \u201cLast I heard he was avoiding you because he thought you were mad at him, so at the very least clear that up. And maybe stop being such a dick to him? I get the idea of tough love and all that, but I think Isaac\u2019s had more tough love than any one person deserves in their lifetime.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek nods. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna go do that.\u201d He gets up, like he means right this very second, and Stiles isn\u2019t really about to stop him. They\u2019re hovering in this weird kind of aftershock though, and it\u2019s the kind of atmosphere that Stiles can\u2019t help but shatter because he can\u2019t handle it. \u201cAnd Derek,\u201d he calls, waiting until the werewolf already has one leg over the edge of Stiles\u2019 windowsill. \u201cMiddle child syndrome explains boatloads of your personality defects.\u201d He has to duck to narrowly avoid being nailed in the head by a book Derek scoops off the floor and hurls his way, but the tension is gone from the Alpha\u2019s shoulders as he disappears through the window, and Stiles\u2019 laughter follows him out.\n Stiles somehow comes to the conclusion that he can kill two birds with one stone by going to Lydia with his baffling Derek experience: it\u2019ll give him a chance to hash out the weirdness with an expert, and it might help in advancing their relationship, whatever that might be, to the next level. Maybe.\u00a0 It\u2019s a theory, and he\u2019s a little desperate, and he\u2019ll take it. He calls Lydia and purposely hedges when she asks what\u2019s up, knowing it\u2019ll pique her interest like nothing else. \u201cI should probably come over there,\u201d Lydia suggests, and Stiles makes sure to stay absolutely silent as he pulls a few victory fist pumps. \u201cBecause you\u2019re clearly lying through your teeth in an effort to get me to pay attention to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not even upset,\u201d Stiles tells her, \u201cjust proud that you\u2019re smart enough to know. Come over, please, so I can whine to you about the enigma that is Derek fucking Hale.\u201d \u201cYou should have led with that,\u201d Lydia scolds. \u201cThat\u2019s an immediate attention-grabber, honestly Stiles, I thought I trained you better than that.\u201d \u201cI was under the impression you didn\u2019t like him,\u201d Stiles defends himself, \u201cthought I\u2019d have to trick you over here some other way.\u201d \u201cThe opportunity to hear you bitch and gossip about someone that isn\u2019t Scott is intriguing enough,\u201d she insists, \u201cand Jesus Christ Grandma the gas pedal is the tall skinny one.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why it ever surprised me that you drive like a bat out of hell,\u201d Stiles tells her conversationally, listening to the unmistakable engine rev of Lydia swerving into the shoulder to cut off whoever isn\u2019t driving up to her standards. \u201cYou definitely present the kind of ice cool fa\u00e7ade that will ultimately end in you snapping and killing us all.\u201d \u201cSerial murder isn\u2019t funny anymore,\u201d Lydia grumbles back, \u201cwe\u2019ve witnessed it firsthand.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Stiles argues, \u201cit has to be funny now, because the alternative is mass hysteria and Lydia, mass hysteria is not a good look on any of us.\u201d They bicker amiably as Lydia cuts off two more drivers, definitely commits to running a yellow that turned red long before she drove through it, and calmly asks Stiles if her official position as favorite girl of the son of the Beacon Hills Sheriff will get her exempt from speeding tickets. \u201cI stole a police transport van and chained up your boyfriend in the cargo bay,\u201d Stiles reminds her, stumbling down the stairs to unlock the front door. \u201cI think I have officially used up all my get out of jail free cards. Literally.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Lydia scoffs primly, sliding her phone into her pocket and brushing a perfunctory kiss on Stiles\u2019 cheek as she breezes through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to count on my sweet disposition and good looks to keep charming my way out of them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see about getting you a PBA card,\u201d Stiles promises dryly, rolling his eyes and following Lydia up the stairs. \u201cAlthough something tells me you kind of enjoy the challenge.\u201d \u201cPlus,\u201d she leans back, eyes twinkling mischievously, \u201cyour dad had to hire a lot of young new deputies after the whole thing with Matt. Fresh out of the Academy and still looking particularly good in their new uniforms.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible,\u201d he tells her, and she laughs like it\u2019s a compliment. \u201cIt\u2019s why you like me.\u201d She\u2019s not wrong. \u201cSo, tell me about your issues with the king of the wild things.\u201d Stiles gets this little flash of a picture, Derek as a kid, still the youngest because his sister hasn\u2019t been born yet, wedged into the corner of a couch next to a little miniature version of Laura, an older woman leaning in close to show them the pages of the book she\u2019s reading from, and oh. Stiles knows, he just knows, that Derek, before fire and fury burned everything innocent out of him, just loved Where the Wild Things Are. His lungs do something funny, like he took a breath that didn\u2019t have enough oxygen and now they\u2019re seizing around nothing, and Lydia\u2019s looking at him like she\u2019s going to start drawing her own conclusions if he doesn\u2019t start talking. He shakes off whatever lingering mental images his overactive imagination is providing (four-year-old Derek in an oversized Max costume on Halloween, Jesus fucking Christ) and forces himself to drop down onto the floor next to her. \u201cSo you know how he comes over every week and we do the Beacon Hills Werewolves version of the nightly news?\u201d Lydia nods, and Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s never actually told her that before, so apparently everyone in his life is a grade A creep. \u201cNormally it\u2019s like an in and out, rapidfire exchange of information, don\u2019t let the windowsill land on your tail as you haul ass out of here kind of scenario,\u201d he explains, because Derek\u2019s weekly visits have given Stiles a whole new appreciation for the phrase \u2018wham bam thank you ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u201cAnd one of you broke the status quo and now it\u2019s weird?\u201d \u201cHe asked for advice. He pouted, then asked for advice, told me about his family, and then left saying he was actually going to do what I suggested he should, and Lyds it was so, so weird because I have no idea where in all of hell that came from.\u201d Lydia\u2019s looking at him kind of funny, some cross between amusement and irritation, and Stiles lets his imagination run away with him for a minute. Lets him imagine that she\u2019s amused because she thinks his wayward rambling\u2019s kind of cute, that the irritation stems from him paying so much attention to someone that isn\u2019t her (although Derek, seriously, like he\u2019s in any way competition for Stiles\u2019 affections). \u201cIt must be lonely,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cLiving with the knowledge that everyone you\u2019ve ever known in your life has either died or voluntarily abandoned you.\u201d \u201cAnd the one person who hasn\u2019t is the one you thought you, you know, killed,\u201d Stiles adds, because living with a once beloved Uncle who went mad, killed his last remaining niece, and then burned until his throat was slit only to rise from the grave again probably wasn\u2019t really such a picnic. Lydia nods, and with that simple movement goes all of Stiles\u2019 desire to overanalyze the stupid situation. Whooshes right out of him like water through an open drain, leaving him frowning sullenly at the chair Derek had been sitting in. Lydia\u2019s right, she\u2019s so right, he\u2019s focused a stupid amount of energy on trying to figure out why Derek would talk to him of all people. As if Derek had anyone else in the entire world to even try with. And great, good, now there\u2019s a low burn of guilt in his stomach. \u201cDid you ever think about what house you\u2019d be sorted into?\u201d Every time Stiles thinks he has a handle on Lydia, who could easily give Derek a run for his money as the most multifaceted person Stiles has ever met, Lydia goes and pulls something new on him; a whole encyclopedia\u2019s worth of knowledge on classic horror movies, a knitting habit, a well-buried secret love of all things Harry Potter. He knew this one already, learned it two weeks ago when he showed up twenty minutes early at her house and found her bawling her eyes out in front of DH Part II, but it still inspires a small thrill of interest. \u201cPottermore went Ravenclaw,\u201d he reminds her, because they\u2019ve already confessed to their no-shame excitement over the website\u2019s launch, almost immediately followed by crushing disappointment at its inadequacies. \u201cDollars to doughnuts you\u2019d be a four-way hatstall,\u201d Lydia argues. Stiles rolls his head sideways where it\u2019d been lolling back against his desk, raising an eyebrow at her. \u201cYou\u2019re stupid brave, boy-who-runs-with-wolves, fiercely loyal to people you love, overwhelmingly curious and clever, but you\u2019ve also definitely got a ruthlessly cunning streak. I go back and forth all the time on which house I think you\u2019d be in.\u201d \u201cI always wanted to be in Slytherin when I was younger,\u201d he admits, because he did. \u201cIt used to make me so angry that people would just cast the net accusation of Slytherin equals future Death Eater. I wanted so badly for J.K. Rowling to have one of the students step up in the eleventh hour and save the day, or help Harry, or something, just to prove to people that not all Slytherins were evil.\u201d \u201cThat is exactly my point,\u201d Lydia says smugly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had one.\u201d \u201cOf course I did. My point is that you look at a freshly turned werewolf and still see your dopey best friend, you look at a batshit girl crying her way to insanity and still think she\u2019s beautiful, you look at people and see people, not whatever issues they\u2019re buried in. And Derek, whether he\u2019s realizes that\u2019s why he\u2019s talking to you or not, really needs someone to look at him and see something more than a scared little boy pretending to be something he\u2019s not and failing spectacularly at it.\u201d \u00a0 Well that\u2019s \u2013 Stiles doesn\u2019t even know where to start, the painfully accurate description of Derek, the fairly glowing review of his character, or the way Lydia\u2019s assessment has sparked a warm thrill through him that settled low and hot in his ribcage. He shifts gears, because Stiles is a professional at switching topics to take obsessive interest in, and spends the rest of the evening wondering what Lydia sees when she looks at him.\n The next few Wednesday updates aren\u2019t quite as perfunctory as they once were. Derek sticks around just a little bit longer sometimes, and they discuss more than just the bare-bones facts. He talks about some of the tracking he himself has done, searching for signs of Erica and Boyd, recounts stories of Peter\u2019s behavior that they both analyze to shreds, speculates with Stiles on how Gerard survived and where he is now.\u00a0 Derek\u2019s appearance at Stiles\u2019 window disrupts Stiles\u2019 aimless internet browsing, and he watches the werewolf balance on the sill for a few seconds before shoving his way inside. It\u2019s only once Derek\u2019s in, sprawled ungainly across the floor with his head and shoulders propped against the wall, does Stiles realize that today is definitely not Wednesday. And, of course, that the rusty red stains on Derek\u2019s green t-shirt are definitely blood, and the smatter of wounds Stiles can see through what he now realizes are undoubtedly claw-induced tears in the fabric are not healing like they should. \u201cJesus,\u201d he hisses, throwing himself out of his desk chair to land on his knees next to Derek. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d \u201cFound the Alphas,\u201d Derek pants, grinding the heels of his hands against the carpet like he\u2019s trying (unsuccessfully) to push himself further upright. \u201cOr, I guess, one of them found me. Told me to stop looking for Erica and Boyd, then made sure I wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d \u201cAnd you suddenly believe so strongly in our information sharing circle that you came straight here rather than going home, or to, I don\u2019t know, a doctor?\u201d Stiles challenges. He\u2019s frazzled with the need to do something, to tug Derek\u2019s shirt off and clean the scrapes littering his torso, or drag him down the stairs and haul his ass to the hospital or Deaton\u2019s. \u201cYour house was closest,\u201d Derek grumbles defensively, and Stiles freezes, because he swears, just for a second, that what Derek actually meant was \u2018your house was safest.\u2019 Which is, of course, patently ridiculous, because Derek has already made it abundantly clear that he doesn\u2019t trust Stiles worth a damn, and there\u2019s absolutely no reason at all he would feel any safer at Stiles\u2019 house than he would his own den. \u201cYeah, well, lucky for you we have a well-stocked first aid kit here in the Stilinski household.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes, mutters something that sounds suspiciously like \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d and ignores the glare Stiles shoots him on his way out the bedroom door. He texts Scott on his way to the bathroom, call off search STAT, u and isaac dont leave ur house til i give u the all clear, and then again, on his way back with oversized plastic bin Melissa McCall personally helps Stiles keep stocked, adds D attacked by alpha, told to stop looking or else. Stiles comes back into his room to find Derek shirtless and braced against his bed, head lolling back against the mattress like it takes too much effort to hold it up on his own. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get blood all over my sheets,\u201d Stiles whines, because the alternative is panic and he\u2019s not ready to panic over Derek Hale quite yet. Derek blinks hazy eyes open and stares at him like he can\u2019t quite muster a glare, and it\u2019s hardly the worst Stiles has ever seen him look but it still sends a quiet note of terror through him. \u201cYeah, yeah, why is it you can still threaten to rip my throat out without even opening your mouth,\u201d Stiles complains at him, even though Derek\u2019s face is kittens in comparison to his usual intensity. \u201cPractice,\u201d Derek grumbles, and Stiles chuffs out a laugh as he drops to his knees again and opens up the first aid kit. \u201cPlease tell me you at least got one hit in,\u201d he gripes, studying the marks across Derek\u2019s skin. Most of them look fairly shallow, surface wounds more than anything else, but there\u2019s a set of four gashes trailing over his right shoulder that look like someone dug their claws in deep and dragged. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to do about those, doesn\u2019t know how the Alpha-wounds-don\u2019t-super-heal rule works when it\u2019s two Alphas in the equation, so he starts with the shallow scrapes he can handle. Derek growls at the first swipe of a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cotton ball against his shredded flesh, and Stiles mock-growls right back. \u201cDon\u2019t be a baby,\u201d he snaps, batting Derek\u2019s hand away with his own before pressing down again with the cotton ball. \u201cIf your stupid werewolf healing doesn\u2019t cure Alpha-induced injuries then whose to say it\u2019ll work on Alpha-injury-induced infections?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand the way your brain works,\u201d Derek protests through gritted teeth. Admittedly, he probably doesn\u2019t have much experience with cleaning injuries, seeing as they don\u2019t usually last long enough for them to be given any proper attention, but honestly, the guy\u2019s been shot, more than once, he should be able to handle a little medicine burn. \u201cWhich I will continue to use to my advantage for as long as possible,\u201d Stiles shoots back. \u201cDude, if you don\u2019t stop squirming I will sit on you, and that will be extremely unpleasant for both of us so for the love of my dignity, hold still.\u201d Derek growls again, like the threat of Stiles touching him more than necessary is acutely unbearable, and manages to settle into some kind of hyper-tension that keeps him at least mostly still. Stiles makes quick work of the remaining scrapes, and he\u2019s secretly pleased to see that while they\u2019re not healing at the rapid fire rate they normally would most of the cuts seem narrower and shorter, like the shallowest edges have healed quicker than the deeper center, and it\u2019s progress. He tapes long pieces of gauze over them anyway, because there\u2019s no point in all that griping and flinching if Derek\u2019s just going to go and get an infection anyway, until all that\u2019s left are the marks trailing over his shoulder. \u201cSit up,\u201d he urges quietly, nudging Derek\u2019s arm well below where the gashes end, and the face the werewolf makes in response makes the part of Stiles that hates seeing people in pain squirm uncomfortably. It\u2019s obvious from the way Derek\u2019s stomach shifts that the effort of sitting up straight puts a stupid amount of strain on the cuts that run diagonally across his abs, and Stiles suffers the grimace on Derek\u2019s face for all of ten seconds before sighing. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me,\u201d he begs, climbing over Derek\u2019s thighs until he\u2019s settled on the werewolf\u2019s left side, away from his injured shoulder. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything as Stiles wedges one leg behind him, nudging forward until Stiles is sitting at an angle between Derek and the side of his bed, supporting Derek\u2019s left shoulder against his collarbone while still leaving the right free. \u201cSeriously, please don\u2019t.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t so much as make a sound, but he does sink back until the additional strain fades from his face, leaning heavily into Stiles. Now that he can see Derek\u2019s back he can tell the gashes trail all the way down his ribs, like a clawed hand had grabbed over his shoulder and yanked him around while dragging down, and Stiles winces in sympathy pain. \u201cYou\u2019re all ridiculous,\u201d Stiles mutters, talking to himself more than anything else, distracting himself from the low hisses of pain issuing from Derek\u2019s mouth as he tries to clean the gashes as gently as possible. \u201cSeriously, everything\u2019s so stupidly aggressive and physical with you. I get that you\u2019re all wolf instincts and all, but has nobody ever considered the idea of werewolf diplomacy? Set up a little business meeting, you and the Alpha Alpha, seconds if you absolutely insist.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how proper packs work,\u201d Derek breathes out, pushing the words through clenched teeth. \u201cPretty sure mine doesn\u2019t count as a proper pack. Also, don\u2019t have a second anymore.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s always me in worst case scenarios,\u201d Stiles teases, because the alternative is to think how small Derek sounded with that admittance, and he\u2019d rather avoid that one like the plague. \u201cYou\u2019re Scott\u2019s,\u201d Derek argues. \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s,\u201d Stiles disagrees. \u201cI\u2019m human, your loyalty rules don\u2019t apply to me. I can favor whichever pack I want, whenever I want.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d \u201cThe way Isaac\u2019s divided loyalty had you all twisted up in knots but you haven\u2019t even made a passing comment about mine.\u201d \u201cDivided loyalty,\u201d Derek snorts and shakes his head. The movement jars his shoulder infinitesimally, but it\u2019s apparently enough for Derek\u2019s fingers to close over the closest thing they can find and squeeze. Stiles valiantly pretends not to notice Derek\u2019s fingertips digging into his thigh. \u201cIf you\u2019d crawled into Scott\u2019s window do you think he would have unquestioningly cleaned you up like this?\u201d he challenges. Derek\u2019s silence speaks volumes. Stiles lets the silence sit as he fits gauze squares over the claw marks, taping them as securely as he can manage without drifting into overkill territory. If Derek was human he would absolutely insist on going to the hospital for stitches, at least for the shoulder gashes, but Stiles knows better than to think Derek will even listen to the suggestion. He worms his way out from behind the werewolf instead, sparing a forlorn look at his definitely bloodstained sheets before straightening up and tossing the medical supplies he\u2019d used back into the first aid box. Derek hasn\u2019t moved when Stiles comes back from the bathroom again, hands washed and kit back where it belongs. He\u2019s slumped against the side of Stiles\u2019 bed, semi-curled protectively in over himself as much as his injuries will allow, and Stiles is completely taken aback by how utterly exhausted the Alpha looks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sleep you might as well get on the mattress properly,\u201d Stiles gripes, kicking lightly at Derek\u2019s sneakered foot. \u201cI\u2019m getting a crick in my neck just from looking at you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013\u201d \u201cYou really should,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cYou look like a kicked puppy. Seriously, it\u2019s like you\u2019re fresh off one of those god-awful Sarah McLachlan commercials, and I can\u2019t even look at you. Besides, do you even have an actual bed somewhere? Like not a nest of blankets, but an actual bed with a mattress and a box spring and a roof over it?\u201d Derek musters a stronger glare than he\u2019s managed yet tonight, and it\u2019s still not even half as impressive as his usual, and that\u2019s more than enough to strengthen Stiles\u2019 resolve. \u201cSeriously,\u201d he says, \u201cDad left twenty minutes before you got here for the night shift, and he won\u2019t be back until tomorrow morning so there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll accidentally walk in on you, and I\u2019m supposed to pick Danny and Lydia up in half an hour, so I\u2019ll be gone until at least like two. You\u2019ll have the place to yourself, stop being stupid and just take the damn bed.\u201d Derek pulls himself up just enough to shift his weight onto the mattress, toeing off his sneakers as he drags himself most of the way onto the bed. Stiles watches him until he\u2019s reasonably convinced Derek won\u2019t put up any more protest on the matter before shuffling over to his closet and pulling out a shirt that doesn\u2019t smell like sweat and Derek\u2019s blood and hydrogen peroxide. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to smell like them,\u201d Derek says quietly. Stiles glances up once he\u2019s tugged the fresh shirt over his head, blinking expectantly until Derek elaborates. \u201cLydia and Danny.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve definitely showered since the last time I saw either of them.\u201d \u201cNot like that,\u201d Derek mutters. He\u2019s watching Stiles pull his socks on, and Stiles can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s creepy or not. \u201cIf you spend enough time with someone your scents start to mingle \u2013 yours has always been more a combination of yours and Scott\u2019s and your dad\u2019s, since you spend almost all your time with them, even when you haven\u2019t been around either of them in a while.\u201d \u201cSo like, Scott still smells like Allison, even though they\u2019re not together anymore, because they spent so much time with each other when they were together?\u201d \u201cBasically.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s still kind of weird,\u201d Stiles nods decisively, shoving his feet into a pair of Chucks low-tops before sliding his phone and his wallet into his pockets, \u201cbut also kind of cool. You gonna be okay here? Painkillers probably don\u2019t work on you, right?\u201d Derek shakes his head, and Stiles assumes it\u2019s to the second question, not the first. \u201cOkay,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSeriously though, don\u2019t just humor me and leave the second I\u2019m gone. You really look like you could use a couple hours of good sleep.\u201d \u201cGet out of here, Stiles,\u201d Derek grumbles, but it\u2019s muffled by sleep and the weight of the pillow where it\u2019s mashed against the side of his face. \u201cSweet dreams, Sourwolf,\u201d Stiles says back, rolling his eyes and glancing over his shoulder. There\u2019s a smile tugging at the visible corner of Derek\u2019s mouth, curving along his lips and disappearing into the shadow of his jaw, and Stiles can\u2019t help staring. It\u2019s nothing like the sardonic smirk Derek occasionally pulls, not the seductive distraction Stiles has seen before. It\u2019s small and soft, quietly unassuming and so painfully genuine, and Stiles feels his breath catch in his throat and hopes to God that Derek didn\u2019t notice the way his heart might have skipped a beat. Oh man. Stiles is so fucked.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n The wolf messed with your vision He is sitting in your kitchen while you sleep tonight He will eat your young, and you will act surprised\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI know you\u2019re busy, but please won\u2019t you come visit me? You are an aimless ghost, you haunt your bag of bones\n\n \u201cStiles!\u201d Lydia whines, and it\u2019s all the warning she offers before dropping herself bodily into his lap. Small as she is it\u2019s hardly much hassle, but her surprise appearance still startles an \u201coomph\u201d out of him. He\u2019d been curled in an Adirondack chair in a dark corner of Anderson\u2019s backyard, nursing the single beer he was allowing himself and generally sulking.\u00a0 This, of course, would have been like a beacon to Lydia. \u201cStiles Stiles Stiles,\u201d she coos, and Stiles wraps a bracing arm around her waist and leans forward to tug at her cup, bringing it to his mouth for an experimental sip. He hadn\u2019t made it deep into the party, didn\u2019t feel the need to push his way into the kitchen when the keg and most of the crowd were on the back deck, but Lydia had clearly found the good stuff, the hard stash of vodka and pineapple juice, heavy emphasis on the vodka. There\u2019s no reason to keep it from her, though; he personally witnessed her put away three quarters of a hamburger and a full plate of fries not three hours ago and she\u2019s still mostly on her feet. She accepts the drink like she hadn\u2019t noticed him taking it from her, taking a long sip before trying to settle back into him. The dip of the chair makes him significantly lower than her, perched as she is on his knees, and that clearly isn\u2019t satisfactory at all. Lydia shifts her weight until she\u2019s firmly in the seat of his lap, butt nestling into the cradle of his hips, and they somehow wind up so Lydia\u2019s shoulder is the perfect height for Stiles to rest his chin on. \u201cYou\u2019re sulking,\u201d she accuses. \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees, because there\u2019s no point in denying it, not to Lydia. She\u2019s all-knowing, alcohol be damned; he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she even knew why. \u201cMe too,\u201d she admits morosely, taking another sip. \u201cYou should have told me earlier, we could have pawned DD duty onto Harley for the night, she owes me one. We could have sulked together.\u201d \u201cMisery always loves company, intoxicated or sober,\u201d Stiles reminds her. They toast their drinks together, and Stiles feels momentarily overwhelmed with a wave of affection for this girl. It\u2019s completely loving and completely platonic, the way he\u2019s felt about Scott for most of his life, the way he maybe was starting to feel about Allison, when he thought she wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and oh man does that seal the fucking deal on Stiles royal clusterfuck of a situation. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lyds?\u201d he coaxes gently, because at least some of the truth behind misery loving company is that misery loves being distracted by a good old round of schadenfreude.\u00a0 \u201cJackson called today,\u201d Lydia mumbles, and that\u2019s hardly news because Jackson, Stiles learned recently, calls every day. Jackson and Lydia talk for hours every day, apparently, despite their pointedly long-distance relationship, and the weakness of his disappointment at that revelation clearly should have been a red flag sooner. \u201cWas he a dick?\u201d Stiles prods, \u201cbecause I will drive to wherever the hell he is and kick his ass, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMartha\u2019s Vineyard,\u201d she reminds him, because of course he was. \u201cHe told me\u2026Stiles, he\u2019s not coming back.\u201d \u201cEver?\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but ask, because that\u2019s really the last thing he expected. \u201cMr. Whittemore put in for a transfer to his firm\u2019s office in Manhattan,\u201d Lydia sniffs, and Stiles tightens the arm he\u2019s still got wrapped around her waist. \u201cThey enrolled Jackson in Choate, in Connecticut. They think he got mixed up in something bad here, and he won\u2019t tell them what because honestly, werewolves, and their solution is to just keep him away from it all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026Lydia,\u201d Stiles says softly, because he doesn\u2019t know what to say. The sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach is entirely sympathy for Lydia, because he has no basis for understanding what that must feel like. It\u2019s one thing to lose someone to death; there\u2019s a clear-cut finality to it, a permanent separation. Losing someone the way Lydia is, to know that Jackson is perfectly alive and probably reasonably happy and entirely without her, that\u2019s a whole different monster. \u201cHe said we could still try,\u201d she continues quietly, and he settles back to let her talk. She chases the warmth of him, pressing further into his chest, and Stiles drops his beer on the ground in favor of curling his other arm around her too. \u201cSaid we could keep doing the long distance thing, if I wanted to.\u201d \u201cDo you want to?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cN-no,\u201d Lydia admits, shaking her head vehemently enough that three long curls land messily across Stiles\u2019 face. He lifts one hand and brushes them aside absently, keeps his hand in place and starts stroking her hair when she leans back against him again. \u201cHe\u2019s never coming back, Stiles. My love life just went from Twilight to an asinine Taylor Swift song, and I\u2019m genuinely not sure which is worse.\u201d She\u2019s definitely crying now, giving in to the press of tears Stiles had heard hovering the back of her trembling voice, but she doesn\u2019t let it stop her. \u201cThere\u2019s always college?\u201d he suggests gently. \u201cMIT\u2019s in Boston, maybe Jackson\u2019ll wind up liking the East Coast so much that he\u2019ll want to stay, maybe he\u2019ll even wind up in Boston too.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s two years from now,\u201d Lydia cries. \u201cHe\u2019s going to one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the country, where he\u2019ll still be the gorgeous lacrosse star, but there\u2019ll be dozens and dozens of other smart, pretty girls just like me.\u201d \u201cLydia Martin,\u201d Stiles says sternly, tugging gently on her hair until she tilts her head enough to meet his eye. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody quite like you in the entire world, believe me. There\u2019s not a single girl at that school who can hold a candle to you, I mean it.\u201d Lydia starts to shake her head again, and it\u2019s the most insecure thing he\u2019s ever seen from this gorgeous goddess of a girl, and he absolutely won\u2019t have it. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he insists. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not just beautiful and talented and brilliant, you\u2019re also fierce and loyal and brave, and even if you weren\u2019t, Lydia, you are the one thing Jackson loves enough in this world to break the vengeance hold the kanima had on him, and that means a hell of a lot. If he gives that up for some stupid fling with some stupid prep school girl then he\u2019s an even bigger idiot than I ever thought, because that moron\u2019s gone from a douchebag to a scaly oversized lizard to a freaking werewolf and you still love him, and he\u2019ll never find another love like that ever again in his life.\u201d Lydia\u2019s completely silent by the end of his outburst, and Stiles can\u2019t help but feel like he did all those weeks and weeks ago, standing in his room and yelling at Lydia for being selfish in her recklessness. He opens his mouth to apologize, because he can\u2019t believe they\u2019re back there again, when Lydia reaches down and laces the fingers of her free hand through Stiles\u2019. \u201cI love you,\u201d she says quietly. Stiles is fairly certain he can feel each and every one of his organs shattering like shards of glass, piercing through the soft flesh of his innards and burrowing between muscles and bones. He\u2019s been waiting for what feels like most of his life to hear Lydia say those words to him, to hear soft warmth and affection and to have her fingers threaded through his and here he is. Lydia\u2019s warm in his lap and pliant in his arms, and it feels like nothing. No. Of course it doesn\u2019t feel like nothing. It feels like a worn blanket from the arm of the couch during late night movie marathons, like hot chocolate with indulgent marshmallows on snow days, like fingers combing through your hair when you\u2019re tired and half-asleep. It\u2019s comfortable and warm and it feels like family, and that\u2019s never how Stiles had imagined it, had wanted it, not from Lydia, and now that he has it it\u2019s exactly everything he never realized he needed. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d he murmurs back, tucking his chin back over her shoulder and curling protectively around her as she pulls deeper into herself and caves in to the tears He still feels it though, the snap and shatter of his organs and bones, the slow reformation as he settles into something new, something different. He\u2019s spent most of his life wanting Lydia, so much so that it became a part of his identity, a part of the very make-up of Stiles Stilinski, and now that he has her, maybe not in the capacity he\u2019d expected but definitely in the capacity he needs, now he has to figure out what to do with himself\n Danny finds them curled together and half-asleep as the party\u2019s winding down, and from the morose understanding in Danny\u2019s expression Stiles knows Lydia wasn\u2019t the only one to get a phone call today. He doesn\u2019t bother rousing Lydia, just lets Danny help get him upright while supporting both their weights and carries Lydia out to his Jeep. \u201cMy house?\u201d he asks, and Danny just nods, looking grateful. Stiles doesn\u2019t remember until they\u2019re halfway there that he\u2019d left Derek mostly asleep in his room, and he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s hoping to find when he gets home. If it was Derek in his bed, he\u2019s disappointed. Lydia wakes up enough to walk herself inside the Stilinski\u2019s house, and she makes her way straight into the kitchen for a glass of water and a hopeful quest for potato chips like Stiles knew she would. Danny heads for the bathroom, quiet on the first floor like they\u2019re not sure if the Sheriff is home or not, and Stiles creeps upstairs. His bedroom\u2019s empty, bed primly made like it hasn\u2019t been since the day he and his dad set it up (a month ago, as a belated birthday present, because all 5\u201911\u201d of Stiles was really too much to fit on the tiny twin size bed he\u2019d had since he\u2019d outgrown his crib). The sheets are cool when Stiles experimentally slides one hand between them, and decidedly not the same ones Derek bled all over. His fingers catch when he slips back up towards his pillow and accidentally brushes under a post-it note. It\u2019s gruff and simple and pretty classic Derek, even the thick block lettering spelling out a simple thanks., but Stiles is a sentimental fool and Derek has never thanked him before. He tucks the note into a dark corner of the bookshelf behind his bed and makes a point of forgetting about it. Stiles hisses down the stairs that the coast is clear, because even if the Sheriff isn\u2019t home it feels too late, too heavy and quiet to use daytime volumes, and he changes into pajamas while he waits for Lydia and Danny to make their way up. Lydia comes bearing the half-eaten bag of Lays he knew she would find tucked away on the bottom shelf of the pantry, holding it out for him in exchange for the mesh gym shorts and t-shirt he\u2019s pulled out for her. He feels a renewed sense of gratitude towards his new queen-sized bed as he, Lydia, and Danny all climb comfortably on top of it, Lydia sandwiched between the two boys. Stiles focuses way too much energy on pretending that the pillow doesn\u2019t smell like leather and smoke and wet leaves, and then on hoping that Lydia doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be okay in Connecticut?\u201d she asks quietly, breaking the lull of silence they\u2019d fallen into. \u201cI mean, not as a person, but as a werewolf?\u201d Stiles had been wondering the same thing, honestly. He\u2019d given Jackson\u2019s absence a surprising amount of thought in recent weeks, wondering if he was surviving the transition from unaware kanima to entirely-too-aware werewolf, if he\u2019d found a way to weather out the full moon on his own. The Whittemores, well-intentioned as they must have been, thinking they were pulling their son out of a bad situation, absolutely could not have picked a worse time to separate Jackson from his Alpha. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a really good question,\u201d Stiles admits, \u201cand we should probably talk to Derek about it. I was going to go there tomorrow, update him on Jackson\u2019s situation, I can ask if you want?\u201d Lydia hums an agreement. \u201cDo you think he would have stayed with Derek?\u201d he asks her. \u201cAs his Alpha? Derek did sire him, I guess, but he also tried to kill him.\u201d \u201cI think he would have stayed with Derek,\u201d Danny answers. \u201cIf he\u2019d asked me my opinion I would have said Derek over any alternative. I think it would have been good for him, to have a pack that he felt like he belonged in.\u201d \u201cDerek tried to kill Jackson because he didn\u2019t think there was a way to save him,\u201d Lydia adds. \u201cScott didn\u2019t get it, because all he was seeing was Derek trying to kill a kid, but Derek was trying to spare him, in the only way he knew how. Jackson might be a dick, we know that better than anyone, but if he knew he was being used to kill people like that\u2026\u201d Lydia shudders, and Stiles feels it all down his side where Lydia is pressed against him. \u201cIf Jackson thought he was going to spend the rest of his life in danger of being used for revenge killing, he would have rather been dead. Derek would have been doing him a favor.\u201d Stiles mulls that over. They\u2019re right, suggesting that Scott would never have understood that. \u201cThere has to be some way to merge Derek and Scott into one cohesive personality,\u201d he sighs, more to himself than anything else. \u201cTogether they\u2019d make the perfect Alpha.\u201d \u201cOr you,\u201d Lydia suggests, and she\u2019s half asleep again, nodding off against Danny, who\u2019s completely down for the count. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of the perfect marriage of Derek and Scott. Lets make you Alpha.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be the Alpha of the human pack,\u201d Stiles agrees, not bothering to hide his sharp grin in the darkness. \u201cPopulation: you, me, Danny.\u201d \u201cGrr,\u201d Lydia mumbles, raising one hand in a weak imitation of Gaga Monster Paws before dropping her hand back down to curl around Stiles\u2019 wrist. Stiles stifles a giggle against her shoulder, tugs the blanket up to his chin, and let himself fall asleep wrapped in the combined scents of the deep woods in the fall and Lydia\u2019s apple bodywash. He wakes up what feels like minutes later, though the weak sunlight pushing through the cracks between his blinds suggests otherwise. His dad is standing in the doorway, still in his uniform, eyebrows raised at the three teens piled into Stiles\u2019 bed like he\u2019s not sure if he should be scolding Stiles or celebrating his son\u2019s return to teenage normalcy. Stiles slips carefully from under the covers and ushers his dad out into the hallway, closing the door quietly behind them. \u201cThey found out yesterday that Jackson\u2019s not coming home,\u201d he stage whispers, frowning sympathetically like it\u2019ll earn him some brownie points. The Sheriff takes the bait. \u201cThey can\u2019t be too happy about that,\u201d he muses, glancing over Stiles\u2019 shoulder as though he can see through the door and personally gauge the other two teens\u2019 emotional stability. \u201cThey\u2019re not,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cNo one really is. Jackson\u2019s a pain in the ass, but he\u2019s still a pretty central figure in most our day to day lives, you know?\u201d His dad gives him a long, appraising look, and Stiles does his best not to squirm under it. \u201cGot an interesting phone call from Mr. Whittemore the other day,\u201d the Sheriff tells him slowly. \u201cSaid Jackson finally admitted he had a bigger part in the whole kidnap debacle than he\u2019d originally suggested. Claimed it was his idea, really, a challenge to you and Scott in an ongoing prank battle, you steal a cop car or suffer mass public humiliation at Jackson\u2019s hands, and you two locking him in the van was your stupid attempt at one-upping him, to which he retaliated with the restraining order. Mr. Whittemore was apoplectic, obviously, but it\u2019s not the first time Jackson\u2019s switched stories on me\u2026\u201d he trails off with a shrug, and Stiles exhales a breath he feels like he\u2019s been holding for months. \u201cEverything just got so out of hand,\u201d Stiles sighs, scrubbing one hand down his forehead and over the bridge of his nose. \u201cOne day, Dad, I swear I\u2019ll tell you everything. Everything. When\u2019s it safe, I promise I will.\u201d \u201cAre you in danger?\u201d the Sheriff pushes, latching onto the word \u2018safe\u2019 like Stiles knew he would. \u201cNo \u2013 not any more so than usual,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay, I really am. Right now it\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s Lydia, Dad\u2026\u201d he trails off suggestively, blinking puppy dog eyes at his dad, and he is the Worst Son Ever, because he\u2019s officially just graduated from lying to cover up werewolves to lying just to escape an awkward chat. Good one, Stilinski, A+ Humanity. The worst part is it totally works; the Sheriff gives him one last long, searching look before nodding. They hug, because there\u2019s always a hug, of course there\u2019s a hug, and Stiles tries not to squirm around too much before he\u2019s safely back behind the closed door of his room. The noise seems to have woken Danny and Lydia though, the pair of them blinking blearily at him, and from there it seems like the day has begun, early crack of dawn time or not. They make their way to the diner, Lydia still in Stiles\u2019 borrowed clothes, Stiles barely passing for acceptable outside attire in baggy cargos and one of his dad\u2019s old Police Academy tees with a hole in the collar, and Danny stumbles up his front walk looking like he has every intention of climbing back into bed whether he actually falls back asleep or not. \u201cAre you still going to see Derek?\u201d Lydia asks him, and she sounds more solid than she did last night but still a little small, a little softer than he\u2019d like. Stiles nods. \u201cAmong other things, yeah,\u201d he says, because today is a day for errand running. Haircut and grocery shopping and returning three week overdue books to the library, anything that can maybe provide a healthy distraction from last night\u2019s overwhelming epiphanies. \u201cDo you want some company, maybe?\u201d she hedges tentatively, and Lydia may be a stone cold ice bitch 60% percent of the time, but her capacity to channel an absolutely adorable kitten explains why she has so many people, Stiles shamelessly included, wrapped around her perfectly manicured finger. They stop by her house long enough for her to shower quickly, piling her wet hair under a UCLA baseball cap and tossing on denim shorts and an oversized t-shirt that looks about as worn and old as Stiles\u2019. He\u2019s perfectly content with today being a day for bumming it, God only knows he is, and they make a point of ignoring the raised eyebrows they both get as he leads her into the barbershop he\u2019s been going to since forever. \u201cStiles,\u201d George calls, jumping out of the black chair he\u2019d been lounging in and beckoning Stiles into it. \u201cThought you\u2019d be in soon. The usual?\u201d The usual, a straight buzz cut, takes about a grand total of ten minutes and George spends the vast majority of it giving Lydia significant looks and making proud-grandfather faces at Stiles in the mirror. Lydia\u2019s alarmingly good natured about it, charming and sweet as she settles herself into the vacant chair next to Stiles and prods George for stories about Stiles as a kid. He happily tells her about how Stiles, hyperactive since months before he even came out of the womb, his mother used to say, always had a bit of a problem sitting still for haircuts when he was a kid. \u201cKept his hair pretty long for a kid,\u201d George told Lydia, \u201cbecause his mother was a smart one, she was. But still, every few months or so we\u2019d have to wrestle Stiles into the airplane seat back there,\u201d he nods over his head, pointing out the child-size barber stool in the shape of an airplane, complete with leg holes and a seat belt. \u201cEven then, his Mom\u2019d have to hold him down most of the time, and we were damn lucky if the thing came out even halfway decent.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why I still come here,\u201d Stiles gripes back teasingly, covering his eyes with one hand. \u201cSee if you get a tip now, old man.\u201d George always gets a tip, of course, because George cuts his hair for free every time. Has since the first time Stiles came in and asked for a buzz cut, sitting still as a statue and watching tufts of hair fall away while firmly blinking unshed tears from his eyes. It\u2019s a longstanding argument between them, George insisting he doesn\u2019t feel right charging a long-time customer for a cut he could realistically do himself at home, especially one that requires monthly visits, and Stiles stubbornly leaving the exact amount the cut should be in George\u2019s tip drawer. It plays out as expected, Lydia watching with entirely too much interest as Stiles and George bicker back and forth, interjecting when George tried to insist Stiles \u201cuse the money to take your gorgeous girl here out to lunch,\u201d laughing when Stiles shoots back that he\u2019s \u201calready bought Lydia breakfast today, can\u2019t go spoiling her.\u201d She waits until they\u2019re back in the Jeep though, stifling giggles and helping Stiles brush away prickly little hairs that fell through the collar of the cape George had thrown over him, to pin him to the seat with an all-knowing look. \u201cYou did used to keep your hair long when we were kids,\u201d she says, and it sounds like an accusation. \u201cEven when you were definitely old enough to keep still for a quick haircut, you didn\u2019t start buzzing it until middle school.\u201d Lydia runs a hand over his freshly shorn head, dislodging a few more loose hairs, and Stiles stalls. \u201cYou knew who I was in middle school?\u201d he demands, and she rolls her eyes at him. \u201cOf course I did, moron, you were a hyper crazy lunatic and most likely my number one competition for valedictorian, provided you could shut up and concentrate on your tests long enough to finish them.\u201d \u201cWe were twelve,\u201d he reminds her flatly. \u201cTwelve, Lydia, what the hell were you doing thinking about valedictorian, I didn\u2019t even know what that word was when I was twelve.\u201d \u201cYes you did,\u201d she scoffs, because he\u2019s a liar and they both know it. \u201cNow stop deflecting.\u201d Stiles sighs, because he knows when he\u2019s been defeated, and nods. \u201cYeah. My mom started chemo in the middle of seventh grade, and she was pretty bummed about her hair. She had\u2026it was a lot like yours, actually, but this rich chocolate brown and shorter and less perfect curls, and she shaved it all off because she thought it would be easier to lose stubble than to lose all that long hair a little at a time.\u201d Lydia\u2019s silent in the passenger seat, and even though Stiles is sure she knew this was coming it\u2019s a different thing entirely to hear it out loud. \u201cI found her crying in the bathroom one morning, and after school I walked over to George\u2019s and asked him for a buzz cut. Went home and told my mom that as long as she was still going through chemo my hair would never be longer than hers, that I wouldn\u2019t grow it out again until we could grow it out together.\u201d His breath catches on the last word and Lydia reaches across the gearshift, lacing their fingers together and squeezing his hand hard. He squeezed back, because the alternative is pulling over and sobbing into the steering wheel and that\u2019s absolutely not even an option right now.\n \u201cDo you ever\u2026have you ever gotten to talk about it? Really?\u201d Lydia prods gently. Stiles shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve always had to see someone for my Adderall prescription, they wanted to up the visits to once a week when it happened, but it\u2019s hard for a single dad to get off work to drive his son around, especially when he\u2019s the sheriff.\u201d \u201cBut what about like, Scott? Or your Dad?\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Stiles shakes his head. \u201cScott and I\u2026a lot goes unspoken, you know? He knows enough to know how I feel about it, we don\u2019t really need to hash it out. And my dad\u2026I don\u2019t think my dad will ever get over it, really. She was the love of his life, and it\u2019s been a few years but he\u2019s still reeling like it\u2019s fresh, and I don\u2019t need to add to that.\u201d \u201cWell that\u2019s dumb,\u201d Lydia says bluntly, and Stiles can\u2019t hold back the short bark of laughter that explodes out of him. She says it so shamelessly, so matter of fact, and he can\u2019t help but grin at her even now. \u201cSeriously, you should talk about it. Talking\u2019s important. Any time you feel like you need to, tell me. I mean it.\u201d And she does, and that\u2019s baffling and brilliant, and Stiles wonders when it was, exactly, that Lydia Martin became the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. He keeps the question to himself, because there\u2019s no need to get overly emotional right now, not when he\u2019s raw enough that almost anything could be pried out of him with a properly worded nudge. She squeezes his hand again, like she knows anyway, and they drive the rest of the way to the Hale house in silence. He\u2019s shocked, actually, properly shocked, to pull up and find a full-on construction site, teams of men in tool belts and yellow hardhats swarming over the significantly sturdier-looking infrastructure of the house. Derek\u2019s standing on the edge looking for all the world like the human equivalent of a cat with his hackles raised, biceps bulging as he crosses his arm tightly over his chest, clearly doing absolutely nothing more than making everyone nervous. Stiles wants to laugh, wants to pet the center of his triskele tattoo until the tension bleeds from those taut shoulders, wants to sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground and demand he \u2018lighten up, sourwolf.\u2019 And then he wants to brain himself on the nearby pile of cinderblocks, because attraction he could probably deal with but this? Goddammit, where the hell did this come from? \u201cDerek!\u201d he calls, abandoning the Jeep a few yards behind the Camaro. It\u2019s not really loud enough to be heard over the din of the on-going construction, but Derek\u2019s a werewolf with supersonic hearing, and Stiles swears he sees the harsh line of Derek\u2019s shoulders relax just a bit. Lydia climbs out and seats herself firmly on the hood, clearly content to maintain her distance from the house. He\u2019ll give her that one; last time she was here, from what he\u2019d heard, she\u2019d raised the dead. So yeah, he\u2019s content to leave her behind as he closes the distance between him and Derek. Derek hasn\u2019t turned around, hasn\u2019t acknowledged Stiles\u2019 arrival other than the shift in his stance when Stiles\u2019 yelled his name, but he\u2019s got no illusions of sneaking up on the Alpha. He pulls to a stop a step or two behind Derek, propping himself up against the tree Derek\u2019s apparently staked out as his prime vantage point, and waits. \u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says finally, dropping his arms and glancing back at the teen. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cUpdates,\u201d he announces cheerfully. \u201cSpeaking of,\u201d he flails dramatically at the house behind them, \u201cupdate!?\u201d \u201cPeter decided he wasn\u2019t spending another night \u2018in that death trap of disgust and disease, Derek, this is not an episode of Supernatural, we don\u2019t need to live like fugitives.\u2019\u201d Derek parrots, and Stiles stamps down on the urge to giggle. \u201cHe said technically the house is his too, and therefore his right to do with it whatever he wanted, and the money too, I guess, and here we are.\u201d \u201cTechnically,\u201d Stiles points out, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Peter was declared legally dead by the town two weeks after he went missing from Beacon Crossing, so I\u2019m not sure he has rights to anything. Also I\u2019m not sure if living under an assumed dead identity makes you a fugitive, but I think there might be laws about that.\u201d Derek\u2019s lip quirks in a way that hints at a smile, and yup, there it goes. Seems like Stiles\u2019 body is completely incapable of not having something to swoon over, and since Lydia\u2019s apparently out of the equation now he seems to have just transferred the whole thing right on over to Derek and that goddamn smile. \u201cI\u2019ll let you be the one to remind him of that,\u201d Derek offers. \u201cBesides, I guess\u2026\u201d He turns back, looks up at the mostly reconstructed frame of the house, and Stiles knows he\u2019s seeing it before the fire, seeing the house in its full glory. Stiles had never made it out this far into the woods as a kid, had never seen it in person, but police reports. Newspaper articles. What he\u2019d seen of it had been beautiful, and maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to have it fixed up again. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping here, are you?\u201d Stiles says suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re still at the train depot, right?\u201d Derek shrugs in an entirely too dismissive way. Stiles narrows his eyes, because that\u2019s really just absolutely unacceptable, and Derek cuts him off with another hint of a smile. \u201cPeter rented a room at a motel in town for the duration of the construction and told me if I he finds out I\u2019ve gone back to the train depot again he\u2019ll take his claws to the Camaro,\u201d he admits, and Stiles doesn\u2019t bother trying to control his laughter this time. Derek looks like a sulky, well-scolded teenager, and for the first time since his resurrection Stiles wonders if Peter\u2019s return might be a good thing. Oh, sure, he\u2019s definitely got some hellfire planned, Stiles has no doubt about that, but maybe it won\u2019t be quite the catastrophe he and Derek have been anticipating. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to keep that in mind,\u201d Stiles says gleefully. \u201cStick it in my back pocket, save it for later. Next time you threaten to rip my throat out with your teeth I\u2019ll just dangle my keys near your precious paint job.\u201d Derek growls, but it\u2019s low and light, none of his usual aggression pressed into it, and Stiles thinks this might be what a playful growl sounds like. He nudges his shoulder experimentally against Derek\u2019s and all the Alpha does is look at him, one heavy eyebrow raised. \u201cI\u2019m onto you,\u201d he mutters, grinning, and Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cThe car can be fixed,\u201d Derek shoots back, \u201cripping your throat out is a lot more permanent.\u201d \u201cYeah, tell that to Peter,\u201d Stiles argues. He spares a look back over his shoulder, checking on Lydia still perched on the hood of his Jeep, and recoils slightly at the cold, narrow-eyed glare she\u2019s shooting directly their way. It takes him a long, surprised second to realize that her brown eyes are fixed on Derek, glaring at him like he\u2019s personally threatened everything she loves, and other than the one time Derek tried to kill Lydia, which Stiles isn\u2019t even sure she\u2019s ever heard the whole story about, he can\u2019t think of one good reason why. \u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s trying to kill me with her eyes,\u201d Derek complains, and apparently he\u2019s aware of the death glare too. He\u2019s probably got a built in radar for death glares, a beacon for kindred spirits who practice murdering souls in the mirror. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know why,\u201d Stiles mumbles back, frowning at Lydia. If she notices him looking at her she doesn\u2019t react. \u201cWhy\u2019re you here?\u201d Derek sounds grumpy again, all trace of light humor gone from his dark features, and Stiles takes a second to mourn the loss. \u201cUpdates,\u201d he says again, this time less enthusiastically. \u201cSpecifically of the Jackson variety, hence Lydia.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d Derek prompts, and Stiles rolls his eyes at the sudden impatience. \u201cJackson\u2019s gone for good. His parents are moving to New York and shipping him off to boarding school in Connecticut. I figure he\u2019s technically an Omega right now, but I\u2019ve been reliably informed that if he\u2019d had any choice in the matter he would have stayed as your Beta, so I thought you might want to know. Also, Lydia was wondering if there\u2019s anything he has to do, as a werewolf moving to a new territory, to avoid getting killed in some misguided turf war.\u201d \u201cManhattan\u2019s a big city, territory rules are a lot more lax in cities,\u201d Derek says slowly, running a hand through his hair as he parses through Stiles\u2019 points. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to boarding school he should be okay too, packs in the areas of colleges and boarding schools tend to have an open door policy, since most wolves in the areas are so transient. He should reach out to the local pack\u2019s Alpha, as a nicety more than anything else, but as long as he keeps his head down and his teeth to himself he should be fine.\u201d Stiles nods. It\u2019s a nice reminder that not all werewolves are aggressive dicks, he thinks maybe a few of the ones in this town could stand to have their memories jogged. \u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cAs a pretty new werewolf all alone on the opposite side of the country from what should\u2019ve been his pack?\u201d Derek turns to look at him, a long, searching look like he\u2019s trying to assemble the mystery puzzle that is Stiles without having any idea what the final product should look like. Stiles runs the question back through his head; he thinks maybe, if you listen to it the right way, it kind of sounds like he\u2019s lumping himself in with that pack. He might be. \u201cHe\u2019s made it through two full moons,\u201d Derek points out finally. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part, really.\u201d Stiles nods. He\u2019s not sure when he started caring about Jackson\u2019s welfare, sometime between the last time he suggested they kill him and feeling Lydia fall apart over Jackson\u2019s move, and it\u2019s a weird feeling. Derek knows it too, he\u2019s looking at Stiles like he\u2019s not sure what lead them here. Stiles wonders that a lot lately, when it comes to Derek. \u201cText me later,\u201d Derek adds. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Peter if he remembers who the predominant pack in Connecticut is, see if we can get Jackson some contact information.\u201d He pauses for a moment, like he\u2019s not sure he wants to say whatever\u2019s left on his mind, but Stiles waits. \u201cPack isn\u2019t necessarily affected by distance,\u201d he says finally, glancing over Stiles\u2019 shoulder to where Lydia\u2019s sitting. \u201cIf Jackson wants to be a member of this pack it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s spending a year or two in Connecticut.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll pass that on,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d Derek nods back like a dismissal, and Stiles takes the hint. He\u2019s halfway back to his Jeep when he remembers one last thing, turning back to Derek and not bothering to raise his voice over the buzz of a chainsaw ten feet away. \u201cIf the motel room starts feeling small, given your roommate and all, my window\u2019s always open. Even when I\u2019m not home, just keep an ear out for my dad and let yourself in.\u201d Derek makes no attempt to acknowledge him, but Stiles is satisfied the werewolf heard him anyway. He lets himself back into the Jeep and waits for Lydia to buckle herself in before shifting gears and pulling the car away from the new construction zone that is the once and future Hale house. It\u2019s just barely faded from the rearview mirror when he turns to Lydia, careful to keep his face void of judgment. \u201cYou,\u201d he accuses, \u201cwhat\u2019s your deal with Derek?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Lydia says defensively. Too defensively. \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t have a problem with Derek.\u201d \u201cYou are a lying liar who lies,\u201d Stiles sing-songs at her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you glaring great big daggers of death at him, what gives?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d she mumbles, fidgeting with the hem of her oversized shirt. \u201cI just get overprotective sometimes.\u201d \u201cOverprotective of who?\u201d he laughs, because none of them need protecting from Derek, not as far as he knows. \u201cYou, stupid,\u201d she pouts. \u201cHe looks at you like\u2026I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cAw, Lyds,\u201d Stiles teases, poking lightly at her. She swats his hand away, and there\u2019s no doubt in his mind that if she could be, she\u2019d be growling. \u201cSeriously, he\u2019s not that bad. We\u2019re almost even\u2026well, not friends, but we\u2019ve reached an understanding.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t like,\u201d Lydia grumbles. No amount of prodding will get her to elaborate on that though, so Stiles chalks it up to Lydia being Lydia and gives up before they even clear the woods.\n After he wakes up panting from his third dream about Derek shoving him against a wall/mattress/the Camaro, Stiles finally caves and does some research. He\u2019s thorough, because he\u2019s a nerd at heart, surfing everything from legitimate LGBT-friendly websites to trashy redtube porn to the incredibly detailed PWP archives on AO3 (incredibly detailed. Jesus Christ, half these authors are underage girls, and yet some of those stories might as well be step by step How to Gay Sex guides, diagrams provided by patented Stilinski overactive imaginations).\u00a0 And, because Thoroughness, thy bitch is Stiles, he talks to Danny. It\u2019s one of those nights where there\u2019s actually nothing going on, but Lydia wanted to see the Katy Perry movie, and Stiles\u2019 newfound reassessment of his feelings for her didn\u2019t make him any less whipped, and Danny genuinely had nothing better to do (read: was waiting for an excuse to see it anyway), so they were movie-bound. Danny offered him a ride, Stiles saw the opportunity, and there they were. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an easy conversation to start \u2013 Stiles has been spinning his phone between his fingers, smearing smudges across the screen and almost dropping it twice, for ten minutes when Danny finally reaches over and slaps his palm flat over Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cJust spit it out,\u201d he orders, and Stiles resists the urge to point out that that\u2019s totally what he said, because that joke is both outdated and overplayed. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d he asks carefully, and even though it\u2019s mostly his way of stalling it\u2019s still kind of a fair question. \u201cOf course we are, idiot, unless you\u2019re going to ask me again if you\u2019re attractive to gay guys.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Stiles says cagily, \u201cthat maybe I\u2019m less worried about the entire universe of gay guys in general and have narrowed my focus specifically to one not-so-gay-at-all guy?\u201d Danny is quiet for a few seconds, but Stiles gets the distinct impression that it\u2019s more his attempt at being properly respectful of Stiles\u2019 revelation than him actually being surprised by the confession. \u201cTo be fair, Derek pays a suspicious amount of attention to his hair. Metrosexuality and manscaping are all well and good, and stereotyping is bad, but I wouldn\u2019t rule him out entirely\u2026\u201d Stiles is pretty sure he chokes on nothing but thin air. \u201cWho said anything,\u201d he whines, and it\u2019s in such a desperate, panic-driven falsetto that he\u2019s certain he just confirmed every last one of Danny\u2019s suspicions, \u201cabout Derek?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you turn into flailing, spazzy nerdball around someone you like,\u201d Danny reminds him, smirking knowingly over from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cSo I know it\u2019s not anyone we hang out with regularly. Plus, I\u2019ve watched half a dozen guys and girls hit on you on any given night without you even noticing, and some of them have been Lydia-quality attractive, which means whoever\u2019s caught your eye has to be model-worthy.\u201d Stiles lets himself panic for a few more minutes, tells himself that Danny has always been uncanny in his observational skills, and that Derek, for all his built in supernatural emotion-detectors, is overwhelmingly obtuse about people. Danny spends plenty of time with Stiles these days, his logic\u2019s sound, and that totally doesn\u2019t mean that anyone else knows. \u201cThis one time,\u201d he finally says tentatively, glancing over at Danny\u2019s carefully neutral expression, \u201cI found a CVS receipt in his car for thirty bucks worth of Garnier Fructis and seriously almost died from laughing so hard. It\u2019s just really hard to take threatening growling seriously when you\u2019re picturing Derek carrying a little red basket and debating between Extra Strong and Ultra Strong.\u201d Danny finally grins, wide and open and honest, and Stiles can\u2019t help but grin back, laughing quietly and shaking his head. Okay, so that went maybe better than expected. Not that he had any fears about Danny, really, but still. Everything feels a little looser now that he\u2019s told someone \u2013 not completely gone, but less. Maybe like unbuckling your belt after a particularly enthusiastic effort at eating an entire Thanksgiving turkey on your own. The stomachache\u2019s still there, and so\u2019s the inevitable tryptophan crash, but the edge is softer. \u201cAnything in particular you wanted to know?\u201d Danny asks, pausing just a beat too long at the stop sign before Lydia\u2019s house. \u201cNah, I know how to use Google,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cJust wanted to tell someone.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Danny offers, pulling into Lydia\u2019s driveway, \u201cif you want to tell someone when you finally get into those super tight jeans of his, I\u2019m all ears. Every delicious, scandalous inch of detail.\u201d Lydia lets herself into the backseat and wisely doesn\u2019t ask why Stiles is systematically pelting Danny with the entire contents of the Prius\u2019s center console.\n Stiles opens his bedroom door and finds Derek on his laptop.\u00a0 He thinks he takes it in stride, really: flails silently, throws his keys at Derek\u2019s head (misses), and slams the door.\u00a0 \u201cAdmittedly, I literally invited this on myself, but couldn\u2019t you at least leave the door open or something, text a warning, wave a white flag out the window?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Derek promises, still with his back to Stiles, \u201cbecause your dad definitely won\u2019t notice any of that.\u201d \u201cFive second TXT, Derek, it literally only has to be eight characters. I-n-u-r-r-o-o-m,\u201d Stiles whines. He takes advantage of Derek\u2019s apparent determination to ignore him, shucking his shorts and replacing them with loose sweats. \u201cPhone\u2019s dead,\u201d Derek grunts, \u201cbullet through the screen.\u201d Stiles crosses the room so fast he surprises even himself. \u201cWhy was someone shooting bullets at you?\u201d he cries, grabbing Derek\u2019s shoulder and yanking the chair around. Derek looks whole, un-bloody, and entirely unimpressed with the interruption. \u201cIt\u2019s possible someone got the impression that I\u2019m a dangerous and potentially violent animal,\u201d he tells Stiles drily, pulling the expression Stiles privately (when he\u2019s panicking less) refers to as his grumpycat face. \u201cWhen, where, who was it, why, do we need wolfsbane, shit it wouldn\u2019t heal with the bullet still in you, right?\u201d Stiles\u2019 hands are skimming the air a quarter inch above Derek\u2019s arms as though he expects to feel bullet holes he can\u2019t see. They\u2019re hovering over the hem of his short sleeves when Derek\u2019s face softens, one hand coming up to cuff Stiles\u2019 wrist gently. \u201cStiles, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cI really meant animal. In the woods, it was kind of dark. I think I scared some guys with a bb gun. Besides,\u201d he adds wryly, \u201cyou\u2019re looking in the wrong place, considering my phone was in my pocket.\u201d Stiles, who\u2019s been staring at the place where Derek\u2019s thumb is still pressing lightly into his wrist, the little hollow between bone and tendon where his pulse is strongest, flashes his eyes down towards Derek\u2019s lap. Front pocket or back pocket? Thigh, or\u2026 Stiles flushes red and rears back hard enough to break Derek\u2019s loose grip. He busies himself with swooping down to pick up the shorts he\u2019d abandoned on the floor, waits to speak until he\u2019s got his back firmly to Derek and his hands focused on folding the shorts into perfectly overlapping halves. \u201cTell me you got shot in the ass,\u201d he laughs shakily, prays Derek buys the flimsy bravado in his voice. \u201cStiles, look at me,\u201d Derek demands softly, and he waits until Stiles (shoving the painstakingly folded shorts haphazardly into a drawer and undoing a solid minute of fussy work) actually looks over. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything, kicks the drawer shut and pretends the uneven drawstrings on his sweatpants are a travesty of utmost importance. \u201cWhatever, Hale,\u201d he scoffs, eyes on his knees, \u201cyou\u2019re just trying to distract me from the fact that a couple kids shot you in the ass.\u201d Stiles ignores the weight of Derek\u2019s eyes on him, meticulously tugs on the shorter string and studiously avoids looking up until he hears the telltale squeal of the desk chair pivoting back around. Even then he lowers himself slowly onto his bed, hauls up the stack of books he\u2019s been meaning to reshelf for a few weeks, and stares resolutely at the spine of The Maze Runner. \u201cYou know, the point of password protecting a computer is so that your average Joe Werewolf can\u2019t break into your room and help himself to it,\u201d he says finally, once he\u2019s sure he can open his mouth without giving anything away. \u201cI actually tried Lydia, before anything else,\u201d Derek admits, back to browsing what looks suspiciously like the Cyanide and Happiness homepage. \u201cSpeaking of, did Scott change his password now that they broke up?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Stiles lies, shoves Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close into place with a little too much force. \u201cHow many tries did it take?\u201d \u201cLydia, then your mom\u2019s name, then your birthday. It took two tries with \u2018derek is a sourwolf,\u2019 though, I wasn\u2019t sure if sourwolf was one or two words.\u201d \u201cI thought maybe it would be the lack of capitalization,\u201d Stiles shoots back. He\u2019s not even a little bit embarrassed; he\u2019d known it was only a matter of time before Derek helped himself to his laptop, that was the whole point of the password. \u201cYou have an ee Cummings anthology in that pile,\u201d Derek points out, nodding his head backwards towards the pile in Stiles\u2019 lap. \u201cThat, and your texts are always entirely lower case.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s sheer laziness,\u201d because it is, \u201cyou\u2019re lucky you even get fully actualized words, Scott gets straight textspeak.\u201d \u201cWhich is appalling. It\u2019s not even shorthand, it\u2019s just the brutalization of the English language.\u201d \u201cOkay Hipster McEnglish Major, calm down,\u201d Stiles teases. \u201cBesides, you can\u2019t really think Scott could read shorthand.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you can either,\u201d Derek challenges, and Stiles huffs out a laugh in response. \u201cI memorized the entire lexicon of Beacon Hills Police Department\u2019s signal codes, standard military call signs, and Morse code when I was thirteen, what makes you think I can\u2019t read shorthand.\u201d Stiles takes a pathetic amount of satisfaction in the ringing silence from Derek\u2019s side of the room, until he glances over just long enough to notice two fingers tapping lightly against the surface of his desk. \u201cNow you\u2019re just insulting my intelligence,\u201d he complains when Derek\u2019s finished, because tapping out Stiles is a shameless liar takes a stupidly long time and he\u2019s more than happy to let Derek suffer through the whole thing. \u201cAnd you can clearly tell I\u2019m not lying, you filthy cheater.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t look even slightly perturbed to be called out on it. \u201cYou should have told me sooner,\u201d he does say, though, because even when Stiles is right Derek still has to be slightly more right. \u201cMorse code is handy when you want to communicate with someone with extraordinary hearing.\u201d \u201cSign language,\u201d Stiles muses in response. \u201cWe should learn that. That could be even handier, pun completely intended. Or do you know it already?\u201d Derek glances over his shoulder long enough to make sure Stiles is watching before he raises his hand, fingers shifting rapidly \u2013 a fist, his pointer finger crossed over his thumb, pinky raised, pointer and thumb extended perpendicular, a looser fist with his fingertips against his thumb, another fist. It\u2019s faster and smoother than anything Stiles had ever managed with his clumsy fumbling, but he remembers enough of the basics to recognize his own name being spelled out. \u201cJust the alphabet,\u201d Derek admits, \u201csomething faster could be better.\u201d \u201cBaseball signals,\u201d Stiles suggests, because Moneyball is the next book on the pile and if that\u2019s not a sign from the universe then what is. \u201cFinger gun for hunters, Stilinski-esque arm flailing for \u2018run like hell,\u2019 helpless writhing on the floor for wolfsbane.\u201d \u201cYou do all of those already anyway, complete with incredibly loud verbal commentary in case we missed the memo,\u201d Derek points out, and maybe it\u2019s a little rude but it\u2019s not entirely inaccurate. \u201cBesides, baseball signals are supposed to be a lot less obvious.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019da you know anyway,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cOther than nine years of little league? Two seasons as the starting pitcher for the varsity baseball team probably didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Derek has the audacity to turn around and shoot Stiles a cheeky smirk that does horrible things to both Stiles\u2019 ability to breathe properly and his will to live. \u201cOooh,\u201d he mocks, \u201cI\u2019m so impressed the werewolf has athletic skills. Did you ever accidentally forget you weren\u2019t playing fetch and try to catch the ball with your teeth?\u201d \u201cOnly once, and I bit it clean in half,\u201d Derek says solemnly. Stiles will never admit it takes him a few too many long, drawn out seconds to catch sight of the telltale lilt at the edge of Derek\u2019s lips, but he will happily own up to the surprised bark of laughter that escapes when he realizes Derek is totally joking. \u201cWerewolf\u2019s got jokes,\u201d he laughs, and that small hint of a smile looks a little stronger when Stiles shrugs his shoulders and shakes his head in defeat. \u201cCome on, though, there has to be some little canine tendency. Inherent dislike of cats? Uncontrollable urge to growl at mailmen? Inexplicable tendency towards kibble over cereal?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Derek drawls slowly, and he\u2019s still twisted around enough that he can pin Stiles with a look Stiles feels straight down to his toes, \u201cI do love a good chase.\u201d \u201cWhat, not the kill?\u201d he tries, and if his voice is a little shaky no one ever has to know. \u201cOh, there\u2019s definitely fun there too,\u201d agrees Derek, and there\u2019s still something else in his stare. \u201cBut the anticipation\u2026\u201d And Stiles would swear, swear up down left right and with one hand over his heart on the soul of his beloved Jeep, that they\u2019re not just talking about a playful romp through the woods. That something is still lighting the grey green highlights of Derek\u2019s eyes, and there\u2019s the faintest hint of a dimple on the side where one corner of Derek\u2019s mouth is still upturned, and the overall effect is going to get Stiles in capital T-R-O-U TROUble. His phone\u2019s on vibrate, and for a text it only buzzes once, barely even enough for Stiles to feel where he dropped it against his ankle, but goddamn werewolves and their goddamn supersonic hearing, because Derek jerks like he\u2019s been pinched. Just like that whatever odd tension had been leaking into the air between them is poof, gone. He waits until Derek turns the chair back to face his desk, closing out of what was definitely Cyanide and Happiness to the even more baffling screen of the collective search results of mens henley on the J.Crew website (J.Crew, Derek? REALLY???), before quietly reaching for his phone and sliding open the text.impromptu beach road trip tomorrow, harley and co going too, I\u2019ll drive us and danny if you supply the food, say yes Of course Stiles says yes, because the beach is approximately his favorite place in all of California and he hasn\u2019t been there yet this summer.try to actually sleep tonight, I\u2019m picking you up at six and will blast nothing but Madonna at top volume if you even think about falling asleep in the carbring me coffee and then we\u2019ll all be happydanny\u2019s on breakfast duty, you can place your order with him Stiles is halfway through a simultaneously demanding and pleading text to Danny when Derek clears his throat, a low rumble that\u2019s not unlike his preferred growl. \u201cI can leave,\u201d he says hesitatingly when Stiles glances up in surprise. \u201cI mean, I know you\u2019re dad\u2019s on duty all night\u2026\u201d he trails off and gestures at Stiles\u2019 phone, like that\u2019s supposed to mean something. \u201cSo?\u201d Stiles frowns, because he\u2019s never been faced with this oddly awkward-looking Derek before, and he\u2019s not quite sure why his dad\u2019s presence is in any way related to his texting habits. \u201cNo one\u2019s kicking you out, it\u2019s just Lydia conspiring to drag my ass out of bed at the crack of dawn.\u201d Derek still looks extra super shady, and maybe a little bit like he\u2019s just stubbed his toe or sucked on a lemon, something wincing and sour in the creases around his eyes, and Stiles has absolutely no idea. \u201cLook, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he insists, shoving the last book (The Lightning Thief, and he feels absolutely no shame about it because awesome books are awesome no matter how old you are) onto his shelf. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go brush my teeth and whatever, but I mean it, you should stay. You obviously came here for a reason, and I totally invited you to. My bed\u2019s big enough for two people, or there\u2019s extra pillows and blankets in the hall closet if you\u2019d rather the floor, or even if you just want to keep up your little online shopping expedition, no silly little laptop glow is going to wake me up once I\u2019m out.\u201d Whatever\u2019s slid under Derek\u2019s skin doesn\u2019t seem to have been soothed by Stiles\u2019 little speech, but he nods once and slinks slowly back around to consider a slate gray henley that Stiles is 85% positive Derek already has three of, so he\u2019s confident enough that if he leaves the room Derek will still be there when he gets back. The computer screen might not be enough to keep him up, but Stiles is still wide awake with the knowledge that Derek is in his room when the white-blue glow cuts off an hour later, plunging them into darkness. He resolutely keeps his back to Derek, even though he\u2019s pretty sure the werewolf can tell from his heart rate or his breathing or his what-the-hell-ever that Stiles isn\u2019t really asleep. Let him make up his own mind about whether or not he wants to stay. Stiles feels the side of the bed dip the same moment he feels the comforter shifting against his bare flank, hides his small smile against the arm he\u2019s resting his head on. Derek\u2019s all broad-shouldered and big-armed, but his body tapers down enough at the waist that there\u2019s whole valleys of space between his hips and Stiles\u2019, and Stiles tries desperately to pretend that he\u2019s not hyperaware of last inch of distance between them. He cracks his eyes open just long enough to catalogue the subtle changes since he fell asleep still staring down the wall and pretending to ignore the heat of Derek\u2019s right shoulder a mere eight inches from his back. Stiles had rolled over at some point, hips and belly and chest facing Derek, shoulders twisted down nearly flat against the mattress, forehead inches from the arm Derek had shoved under his pillow and nose nearly pressed into Derek\u2019s side. It\u2019s slow burn heat, like sitting by a fire, and it washes over him in waves, and if he curls his wrist enough that the back of his hand brushes against Derek\u2019s ribs, no one ever has to know\u2026 The next time Stiles opens his eyes his alarm is going off, 5:30 and hell, and when he stretches an arm across to where he keeps his phone he realizes he\u2019s alone. There\u2019s a mug sitting on his desk, though, and two minutes later when Stiles finally drags himself over to it it\u2019s full to the brim of coffee, black, that\u2019s still too hot to drink.\n Considering everyone else\u2019s blatant disregard for things like territory, personal space, and locks, Stiles is kind of surprised when Scott bangs down the kitchen door like he wasn\u2019t capable of letting himself in. It\u2019s early, too early, that hazy half an hour before dawn when everything\u2019s the same flat murky gray, so Stiles will allow for the possibility that Scott forgot his key. And his built-in lock-picking skills. And wall-scaling, window-crawling abilities.\u00a0 \u201cWhyareyouatmyhouse,\u201d Stiles mumbles, one long string of syllables stumbling out of his mouth one on top of another. Scott doesn\u2019t answer, probably because Stiles doesn\u2019t quite possess the ability to hear through doors, so he shuffles blearily over and flips the deadbolt. \u201cGet in get in,\u201d Scott orders, shoving Stiles backwards and throwing himself over the threshold, slamming the door shut behind him. It wakes Stiles up faster and harder than a straight shot of caffeine, though his self preservation appears to still be in bed as he elbows Scott aside and presses his nose against the glass. \u201cWhat?\u201d he hisses, \u201cwhat is it, what\u2019s going on?\u201d And then he sees it. Laid out on the picnic table at the edge of the patio, neatly arranged with the arms folded serenely at the wrists and ankles pressed together through neat dress slacks, the carefully displayed body of Gerard Argent. \u00a0 In pieces. Three of them. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles whines, reaching behind him to slap uselessly at Scott\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHoly shit holy shit holy shit shit shit Scott what the fuck is that doing here?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Scott whispers back, high and distressed and pointedly not looking. \u201cI thought I smelled him \u2013 it \u2013 something \u2013 by my house and I was following the scent and it looked like it was leading here but I didn\u2019t think it would actually be here here.\u201d \u201cOh my god, is that a bow around his chest?\u201d It is. A gift bow, big and red and prissily tied right over his ribs, and Stiles knows exactly how it got here and oh my god he\u2019s going to vomit and then he\u2019s going to curl up in a ball and die. He\u2019s pawing numbly at the pocket of the hoody he grabbed after Scott\u2019s text, yanking out his cell phone after three failed attempts at finding the opening and dialing the number before Scott can even begin to protest. \u201cDerek,\u201d he hisses the moment the call connects, not even bothering to wait for whatever disgruntled greeting Derek had planned for him. \u201cYou need to get to my house now. Be as sneaky as possible, but try to avoid the backyard.\u201d \u201cWhat.\u201d \u201cYes, I appreciate it\u2019s 5:00am and even you need your beauty sleep, but Gerard Argent\u2019s dismembered body is in my backyard so can you please come over now.\u201d Stiles feels approximately no shame at the high pitched shrill his voice has reached by the end there \u2013 what matters is he can tell in an instant it\u2019s effective. \u201cStay in the house,\u201d Derek orders. \u201cKeep the doors locked until I get there. Are you alone?\u201d \u201cScott\u2019s here,\u201d Stiles admits, and Scott looks kind of pissed but he can deal. \u201cHe was tracking the scent and it lead him here. Derek, I think it\u2019s \u2013\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Derek cuts him off. There\u2019s an overwhelming amount of rustling that blocks out his voice for a split second, followed so quickly by the slam of a car door that he wonders if Derek hadn\u2019t been sleeping in the Camaro. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d The call ends with the rev of an engine, like Stiles might not have really believed him, and Stiles can\u2019t help but roll his eyes as he shoves the phone back into his pocket. \u201cWhat,\u201d he sighs, finally caving to the cranky glare Scott\u2019s been leveling him with since the second he hit send. \u201cWhy\u2019d you call Derek?\u201d Scott snaps, low and layered with a soft growl Stiles hasn\u2019t heard from Scott in a while. It\u2019s territorial and possessive, and almost exclusively reserved for threats against Allison. \u201cThere\u2019s a dead body in my backyard,\u201d Stiles reminds him. \u201cA dead body killed by wolfsbane poisoning after a bite you forced Derek to give. Making you one half of the parties responsible for the dead part of the label dead body. I just thought the other half might like to be present while we decided what to do with it.\u201d Stiles knows it\u2019s a lie the second the words are out of his mouth, and from the tight-lipped, narrow-eyed stare Scott gives him it\u2019s a pretty obvious one. \u201cYou know when we were little and they used to make us play word association games?\u201d Stiles tries again, after a few long minutes of suffering pointed and accusatory silence. \u201cYou know, like fire truck, red, sleep, pillow, that kind of thing.\u201d \u201cStiles, freak,\u201d Scott shoots back, and Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cScott, moron. Anyway. I think maybe somewhere along the way I developed a bit of a\u2026danger, Derek trigger.\u201d \u201cYeah, danger, probably caused by so you should stay away from Derek,\u201d Scott mutters hotly. Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNaw, man, more like oh shit Stiles you\u2019re in danger, call Derek cause he\u2019s got fangs and claws and an excellent track record for saving your life.\u201d Scott looks like Stiles has just insulted both Allison and his mother all in one shot, and Stiles can\u2019t help but roll his eyes again because seriously, this is even worse than the time Scott got cranky about Stiles hanging out with Lydia and Danny. \u201cDude, he literally crawled over broken glass to lead Peter in the opposite direction from my pathetic ass, and we weren\u2019t even friends yet.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re friends now?\u201d Stiles freezes, because there\u2019s no good way to answer that. He thinks maybe they are, actually \u2013 not like Lydia or Danny or, obviously, Scott, but still something. Maybe. To admit that to Scott though, when he\u2019s already starting to look a little hairy around the edges, would be a lot. And to lie, after already getting caught in one Derek-related lie this morning\u2026 \u201cLook,\u201d he sighs, \u201cDerek\u2019s an ass, and a dick, and an idiot, and kind of a lousy Alpha. But he\u2019s also kind of great, in his own weird way, and even before that I kind of trust him with my life.\u201d The buzz of an incoming text stops Scott from answering, though really the thunderous expression on his face is more than enough, and Stiles thanks God and also Jesus for small favors as he fishes his phone back out of his pocket.outside, window next to the tv Stiles forcibly shoves aside the immediate realization that Derek definitely just heard what he said to Scott, if he\u2019s standing just outside the house, focusing instead on scuttling into the living room and shoving the window in question as wide open as it\u2019ll go. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely concerned that you know my house this well,\u201d Stiles hisses as Derek shimmies through the tight space, rolling into a crouch under the sill before straightening up and sliding the window back into place. \u201cAlso, did you fly here, because my dad being the Sheriff will not save you from massive speeding tickets.\u201d \u201cIt gets really boring here, when you\u2019re at school and your dad\u2019s working,\u201d Derek grumbles back. He sounds kind of defensive about it, like it\u2019s totally normal to memorize the layout of houses you regularly lay low in. \u201cWhatever, creep,\u201d Stiles mutters. He purposefully knocks their shoulders together as they squeeze through the kitchen doorway, smirking as Derek snaps his teeth at him, and Scott blinks at them like he\u2019s quite sure they were possessed by demons in the short time Stiles was gone from the room. \u201cThere\u2019s a salt perimeter around the whole property,\u201d Stiles tells him, because even though it\u2019s a lie and he knows Scott won\u2019t get it, someone has to say something to snap the staring contest Scott and Derek have engaged in. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly Dean Winchester,\u201d Derek mutters, and Stiles can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s more surprised that Derek called him out on the reference or that, for the first time in Stiles\u2019 memory, Derek conceded the staring contest first. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d love to see you and Castiel sit down for coffee,\u201d he muses. \u201cDo alternate realities exist?\u201d Scott grumbles. \u201cWhat\u2019s the possibility that I\u2019ve woken up in a reality that isn\u2019t mine? Or that this is a dream?\u201d \u201cDo you dream about me and Derek often, then?\u201d Stiles says cheekily. His attention\u2019s mostly on Derek, crossing the kitchen to peer out the back door, but he can still see the way Scott\u2019s face runs through a variety of both vivid expressions and fascinating colors. \u201cDid you get a good look at this?\u201d Derek interrupts, glancing over his shoulder at them. \u201cEither of you?\u201d \u201cMostly what you can see,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s been cut at the neck and the waist, someone\u2019s clearly cleaned him up and he\u2019s definitely in different clothes than we last saw him in \u2013\u201d \u201cYou remember what he was wearing?\u201d \u201cHe kidnapped and beat the shit out of me, Scott, I kind of an unusually vivid memory of that particular evening.\u201d Derek\u2019s growl brings Stiles sharply back to the conversation, shaking his head once and cracking his neck before continuing. \u201cThe gift wrap, obvious and freaky, and if you look you can see his right forearm is bared.\u201d \u201cMeaning what?\u201d Derek presses. \u201cBared and healed. No sign of your bite on it. Which means he was alive after he left the warehouse for at least long enough for that to happen.\u201d Derek nods once, like Stiles is a student he\u2019s proud to have gotten the right answer from, and turns back towards them. \u201cWhy is he here,\u201d Scott snaps, eyes on the window over the kitchen sink. Stiles thinks he\u2019s tempted to double-check the observations but would rather admit ignorance than suffer sharing the same window space as Derek. \u201cWho brought him here, and why?\u201d \u201cStiles?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles knows it\u2019s a power play. Derek already knows the answer, is asking Stiles both as a test to see what Stiles will say and as a test to see how Scott will handle the easiness between them. \u201cThe Alphas,\u201d he guesses, rubbing one hand over his close-cropped hair and frowning at Derek\u2019s affirmative nod. \u201cIt\u2019s a reward for good behavior, Derek heeded their warning, you and Isaac called off the search, and they\u2019re rewarding us by tying up one of our loose ends.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d Derek nods, and Stiles can\u2019t help the pleased satisfaction that courses through him even if it means a sourpuss from Scott. \u201cGreat, so they\u2019re total power hungry creeps who like dangling their superior advantage over us,\u201d Scott assesses. It\u2019s crude, but not inaccurate, so Stiles doesn\u2019t bother addressing it. \u201cWhy here though? Why Stiles\u2019 house.\u201d Stiles has his own theory about that, too, but he\u2019s not as ready to share that one. It\u2019s slightly terrifying, for one thing, and kind of presumptuous for another. It\u2019ll also no doubt lead to more questions from Scott, questions Stiles isn\u2019t quite sure Derek will want him to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s another message,\u201d Derek answers, eyes thoughtful as he studies Stiles\u2019 neutral expression. \u201cThey\u2019re letting us know they\u2019re watching us, they know us. If they\u2019d dropped it at my house it\u2019d be a message to me, your house a message to you, but Stiles\u2019\u2026they know Stiles is between the two packs, that a message sent to him will be delivered loud and clear to both of us.\u201d There are times, on very rare occasions, that Stiles really, really hates being right. \u201cStiles isn\u2019t between the two packs,\u201d Scott says hotly. \u201cStiles has a place in a pack.\u201d And oh, he\u2019s even more than right. There were three messages being sent here. To Scott, a message to pay attention to the pack dynamics dividing them, to Stiles, a message that he\u2019s on their radar just as much as any of the wolves are, and to Derek\u2026 \u201cThey know you came here,\u201d Stiles says quietly, turning his gaze on Derek. Derek nods, because of course that\u2019s the message they\u2019re sending Derek. Derek, who\u2019s spent the last six years of his life just trying to find somewhere safe and quiet to lay low and hide, is being warned that no where, not while the Alpha pack is still in Beacon Hills, is a safe hideout from them. \u201cYou should swing by Allison\u2019s,\u201d he tells Scott suddenly. \u201cShe\u2019s not there,\u201d Scott reminds him. \u201cNo one is. Why would they have gone there?\u201d \u201cBecause he\u2019s Gerard Argent?\u201d Stiles suggests, and for a very brief second Derek\u2019s lips quirk at the obvious sass in his tone. He fights his own grin as he keeps his eyes on Scott. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve gotten everything they could\u2019ve from him, but there\u2019s still two other Argents left here, even if they aren\u2019t here here right now. Didn\u2019t you say she texted you the other day and said they\u2019re coming back soon?\u201d \u201cWhat about him?\u201d Scott frowns, jerking his head in a way that makes it unclear if he\u2019s referring to Derek or Gerard. \u201cCan we learn anything from the body that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d Stiles asks Derek, who frowns and shakes his head. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to, for once, do what a normal person would do if he found a dismembered body in his backyard \u2013 I\u2019m going to call the Sheriff, pack a bag, and stay anywhere else in the world that isn\u2019t the house a dead body was dropped off at.\u201d No one seems to have a legitimate argument against his plan, so cops it is. Scott, who Stiles knew would not be able to leave the Argent idea alone the second he suggested it, quietly slips out a side window as Stiles is making the 911 call. Derek watches with something like morbid amusement on his face as Stiles adopts a heady kind of panic the second the dispatcher picks up the phone, rambling fitfully about oh my god Janine it\u2019s Stiles there\u2019s a dead body in my backyard I\u2019m not kidding Janine I came downstairs to make coffee and there is a body on the back patio can you please send my dad like now right now. \u201cIs she new?\u201d Derek asks the minute Stiles hangs up the phone. Stiles, who has already started moving towards the coffee maker, because cover stories are only good when they\u2019re accurate and he really thinks he deserves a cup of coffee, shrugs. \u201cWorked there long enough that she knows who I am and I recognize her voice, but still new enough that she wasn\u2019t around when I was spending most of my free time at the station,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause the macabre doesn\u2019t make you panic like that.\u201d \u201cI panic all the time,\u201d Stiles argues, because he totally does. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it, don\u2019t pretend like you haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve even been known to panic over you, once or twice.\u201d \u201cYou panic,\u201d Derek agrees, reaching into exactly the right cabinet for two mugs (because he\u2019s the biggest creeper who\u2019s ever creeped) and handing them over to Stiles. \u201cBut you panic about life threatening things, not dead things. Dead things are already dead, you can\u2019t do anything about them.\u201d It\u2019s a completely fair and completely accurate assessment of Stiles, and he wonders where in the hell Derek got the inside scoop enough to sort that out. \u201cI told you, I spent a lot of time at the station for awhile,\u201d Stiles reminds him, pouring coffee into the two mugs. He dumps a hefty amount of sugar into one, a splash of the milk he\u2019d pulled from the fridge, and sticks a spoon in it before passing it over to Derek. And tries not to overanalyze that he knows exactly how Derek takes his coffee. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Camaro?\u201d \u201cFar enough away that the police won\u2019t notice it,\u201d Derek assures him. They drink their coffee in silence, Derek propped against the countertop, Stiles sitting on the edge of the sink, until Derek cocks his head to the side and turns slightly towards the front door. \u201cThey\u2019re almost here,\u201d he says, dumping the remains of his coffee into the sink and tucking the mug away into the dishwasher. \u201cI should\u2026\u201d \u201cGo upstairs,\u201d Stiles suggests quickly, nodding up to where his room is. \u201cNone of my windows face the backyard, so they shouldn\u2019t have any reason to go up there. You could even get a few more hours of sleep, if you can block out the noise.\u201d The red and blue lights from a squad car hit the back wall of the hallway, and Derek nods. He takes the stairs two at a time while Stiles heads for the front door, waiting until he hears the barely audible click of his bedroom door closing before wrenching the doorknob and staring at his dad. \u201cBackyard,\u201d he says, backing quickly out of the way of the Sheriff and the two deputies on his heels. \u201cSaw it out the window over the kitchen sink, it\u2019s \u2013 Dad, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d The Sheriff stops abruptly, gestures for his deputies to pass him before turning on his son. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks quietly, gripping Stiles\u2019 shoulders tight with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cFine, I swear. It just freaked me out, you know? I was half asleep still, and you don\u2019t really expect to look up from the kitchen sink and see Principal Argent\u2019s face staring back at you, you know?\u201d \u201cArgent?\u201d the Sheriff frowns, twisting back towards the kitchen without letting go of Stiles. \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cDefinitely. In\u2026you should go look. I\u2019m fine, I swear.\u201d His dad pulls him in for a hug anyway, squeezing quick and tight before releasing Stiles and stepping back. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Deputy Forrester come in and take your statement,\u201d he tells Stiles, business-like Sheriff voice back in action now that he\u2019s satisfied his parental concern. \u201cAnd then I think you should clear out. This is the last place you need to be, they\u2019re going to want to do a sweep of the whole property, and\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, no you\u2019re totally right that I want no part in that,\u201d Stiles agrees, and it\u2019s completely true. \u201cI\u2019ll text Lydia. Or Scott. Or someone, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The Sheriff squeezes his shoulder once more before hustling out the back door, and the deputy that replaces him is one of the few that survived the kanima incident by being on patrol halfway across town at the time. He\u2019s been around long enough to remember when Stiles didn\u2019t have a nickname, long enough to know exactly who he\u2019s dealing with, and is quick and clinical in getting as much of a statement as Stiles can pull together (significantly less of one than what he\u2019d offered Derek and Scott, like that\u2019s any surprise). Stiles is surprised when he finally stumbles his way back upstairs not even ten minutes later, intent on getting dressed and getting the hell out of dodge, and finds his room completely empty of one Alpha werewolf. His bed, though, was definitely not made when he fell out of it forty five minutes ago, and that\u2019s a classic Derek was here signature. Sure enough, there\u2019s a note on his pillow when he gets closer.don\u2019t go to Scott or Lydia, come to the house. it\u2019s safer, for now. wear old clothes, we\u2019re painting the living room.  The we, Stiles has no doubt, is not the royal we of Derek implying they\u2019ve hired contractors and Stiles should take care not to get messy. Oh no, he and Derek are apparently painting today, because apparently they\u2019re at least the kind of friends that help each other paint their houses. Whatever, it\u2019s not like Stiles had anything better to do today. Besides, he\u2019s not going to say no to enforced one on one time with Derek, he\u2019s way smarter than that. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s pulling on an old pair of shorts from the soccer team he\u2019d played on, summer after eighth grade, that he remembers the conversation he\u2019s absolutely certain Derek overheard between him and Scott. he\u2019s also kind of great, in his own weird way, and even before that I kind of trust him with my life Stiles sucks on his teeth before pulling his bottom lip into his mouth, gnawing lightly on it as he reconsiders his words. On the one hand, he\u2019d made it this far without letting the proverbial werewolf out of the bag; managed to avoid a situation in which he\u2019d be forced to either lie outright to Derek or admit openly to trusting him. On the other hand\u2026he thinks that, maybe, given the way things have kind of become between them, maybe it\u2019s not such a secret anymore. Maybe it\u2019s just one of those things, the unspoken secret that goes unacknowledged by anyone involved but is still generally known to be true. Besides, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s ever been the one to say outright that he doesn\u2019t trust Derek. He\u2019s maybe implied it, once or twice, but Derek was the one to insist that Stiles didn\u2019t trust him any more than he trusted Stiles. He ignores the white hot flare of anger the memory still drags up, because he\u2019s never been so insulted in his life, and he\u2019s never hated Derek more than he did in that moment, but fine. Whatever. Derek either heard him or he didn\u2019t, and there\u2019s nothing Stiles can really do about it now. He pulls his dad aside long enough to tell him he\u2019s heading to Danny\u2019s, they\u2019re repainting Danny\u2019s bedroom, then leaves before the Sheriff has a chance to question it. There\u2019s no point bringing Danny in on the lie, the Sheriff will definitely be entirely too busy with the crime scene at his house to worry about checking in on Stiles, but he does consider texting Lydia as he passes the turn off to her street. Something nudges the memory of Lydia, possessive and angry and staring down Derek like she has several choice words she\u2019d like to hurl at him, and he leaves his phone in the cup holder where he\u2019d dropped it. Derek\u2019s waiting for him on the front porch, but Stiles is so busy staring that he doesn\u2019t even notice. The house is\u2026Jesus, the house is incredible. It\u2019s breathtakingly gorgeous, all light wood and windows and an open air porch, and the sight of Derek standing there, hands in his pockets and one shoulder against a wooden support column, makes Stiles\u2019 hands shake with want and need and concern and silent desperation. \u201cWow,\u201d he says quietly, knowing Derek can hear him. \u201cWow, Derek, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d The closer he gets the more he takes in the subtle differences from the pictures he\u2019s seen of the old Hale house. The biggest, he thinks, are the enormous picture windows on both sides of the front door and, from what he can see straight through some of the empty, open rooms, dotting the other three walls at intervals too.Emergency exits, Stiles\u2019 traitorous mind supplies, and he shakes his head in response because he absolutely does not want to think about that. \u201cWhat if the Alphas\u2026\u201d he worries, because suddenly that\u2019s all he can see, the Alpha pack attacking the house, hitting Derek in the soft spots, torching the place and holding him still while they force him to watch it burn. It\u2019s a horrible image, entirely too vivid and entirely too possible, and it terrifies him. \u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Derek says firmly, interrupting the runaway train that is Stiles\u2019 imagination. \u201cThe Alpha pack sees itself as\u2026law enforcement, at a stretch. They have a code just like any other pack would, and one of the fundamentals of that is that the den is sacred. Besides, part of what they\u2019re interested in is seeing if we have a future as a pack, and rebuilding the house is a declaration of our intent to stay and to stabilize.\u201d \u201cWhat if it comes down to a last resort?\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d There\u2019s a new kind of conviction in Derek\u2019s voice, not the cocky confidence that came with the power of a new Alpha, but a quiet determination. Stiles isn\u2019t sure where it came from, when Derek started looking like he had the potential to be a good leader for the pack, but it\u2019s a good look on him. Derek was apparently serious about the painting thing, but Stiles doesn\u2019t mind. They get to work in this easy, comfortable silence only occasionally broken by Stiles blurting out a question his constantly-whirling thoughts offer up. Derek is surprisingly agreeable to answering almost everything Stiles comes up with (\u201cLaura used to tease me about that all the time,\u201d with a bittersweet smirk, when Stiles finally asks about the disappearing eyebrows. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re imaging, but worse,\u201d when Stiles dares ask how a werewolf obtains a tattoo. \u201cOlive green,\u201d specifically, when Stiles fails to guess his favorite color). They break for lunch after two of the walls are finished, Stiles elbowing Derek out of the way when he looks like he\u2019s about to start heating up instant mac and cheese. There\u2019s no furniture yet, but the kitchen has a large island in the center that Derek seems to have no qualms about hoisting himself up onto, so Stiles hauls his ass up next to him and serves them both properly made mac and cheese in never-before-used bowls. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Peter\u2019s not going to turn around and try to kill us all in our sleep,\u201d Stiles mumbles around the plastic fork in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that maybe this wasn\u2019t the worst idea anyone\u2019s ever had, rebuilding this house. And your standing around glaring at everyone sure seemed to expedite the process, who knew an entire house could get rebuilt in under a month in a world that isn\u2019t Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.\u201d Derek does not seem even slightly willing to concede the Peter point, but he does look rather pleased with himself for his own contribution. Stiles laughs and shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m also not saying anything about your priorities, and the lack of furniture makes sense since you\u2019ve only just started painting, but I do feel slightly confused about your considering bowls and three different kinds of pasta necessary but forks and cups optional.\u201d \u201cFood is necessary,\u201d Derek protests, like that\u2019s the one Stiles was really judging him on. \u201cIsaac brought the plastic forks over because he said even toddlers don\u2019t get away with eating pasta without utensils.\u201d \u201cAnd the bowls?\u201d They\u2019re nice bowls, actually, sturdy white porcelain with a stamp on the bottom declaring them \u2018professional grade.\u2019 Stiles thinks this might be a standard for werewolves, good, sturdy housewares, and has a momentary flash of wondering what kind of damage child-size werewolves could do to a home. \u201cI actually have no idea where those came from,\u201d Derek admits, tapping a nail lightly against the side of his. \u201cI suspect Peter,\u201d Stiles nods sagely. \u201cAre you gonna growl at me if I say he did a good job picking them out?\u201d Derek does growl at him, but there\u2019s absolutely no heat in it, so Stiles just laughs again and makes a point of flailing around enough to elbow Derek in the ribs (twice) as he dismounts from the counter. He appreciates the light banter, the carefully doled out tidbits of information about both werewolves and Derek, but there\u2019s something to be said for the long moments of silence just as much. Stiles has never suffered silence well, even the companionable kind, but in this case it gives him a chance to step back, to spend minutes on end musing quietly on where they are. It\u2019s not entirely out of the blue. Stiles isn\u2019t sure he\u2019d really have called them friends before, even when Scott point-blank asked him, but he thinks maybe they could be. Thinks maybe they could be more, really, but would settle for friendship at the least. It\u2019s not effortless like the way his friendships with Lydia and Danny just kind of fell into place, but still. Derek shows up at his house on days other than Wednesday, once or twice a week and always when the Sheriff\u2019s on duty. He always seems to show up just in time for Stiles to be thinking about dinner, and he sometimes sticks around long enough to follow Stiles into the living room for whatever random DVD Stiles got from Netflix that week. It\u2019s tentative, stilted at times and awkward at others, but it leaves Stiles feeling warm and content and Derek looking less like the weight of the world is hanging in the crease between his eyebrows, and that\u2019s definitely not insignificant. He gets a text from his dad a little after four, giving him the heads up that the coast is clear and, so long as he avoids the backyard, he\u2019s allowed back in the house. Stiles doesn\u2019t mention it to Derek right away, even though he looks over questioningly when Stiles\u2019 phone goes off. He tells himself it\u2019s because he wants to finish the wall he\u2019s working on, to say they successfully finished painting the whole room, and it tastes like a lie even in his own head. They do finish, and Stiles puts painstaking effort into cleaning the paint rollers until they look new again, and then there\u2019s really not much of an excuse for him to stay. He\u2019s futzing with the paint cans still stacked by the doorway, re-grouping them by color and piling them in a neat little line against the wall, while Derek hovers awkwardly on the bottom step of the staircase. \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d he says finally, and it\u2019s heavy enough to make Stiles stop where he is and turn around. \u201cThank you,\u201d Derek blurts out, and Stiles shakes his head a fraction because he was expecting more, and he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cNo problem, it was kind of fun,\u201d he shrugs, turning back around to the last two paint cans to be sorted. \u201cWell, I mean. Not fun, like woo afternoon at Disneyland fun, but you know. Relaxing. Refreshing. Something?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2026\u201d Derek lets out a sound that Stiles knows without even looking is accompanied by his fingers raking through his hair. There was paint on Derek\u2019s hand, last time he looked, and he\u2019s tempted to turn around and see if Derek\u2019s black hair had streaks of the warm sand paint in it now. \u201cI mean, yes, thanks for helping,\u201d Derek tries again. \u201cBut I meant earlier. When you were defending me, to Scott.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t really know you were listening,\u201d Stiles admits, wincing. \u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t have, but\u2026\u201d \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it \u2013 \u201d \u201cWho said I didn\u2019t \u2013 \u201d \u201c \u2013 I just appreciate you arguing with Scott \u2013 \u201d \u201c \u2013 I\u2019m allowed to think you\u2019re great if I want to \u2013 \u201d \u201c \u2013 on my \u2013 \u201d \u201cShhh! Shut up,\u201d Stiles snaps, pressing his pointer finger against his lips and shushing harshly every time Derek tries to keep going. \u201cNo no no,\u201d he insists, \u201cstop talking.\u201d Derek finally gives up, heaving a world-weary sigh and raising his eyebrows expectantly at Stiles, but Stiles isn\u2019t fooled. He can see the hint of fondness softening Derek\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re either really bad at using your wolf powers or you\u2019re actually shamelessly lying to yourself, because if you were able to hear me and Scott talking then you were definitely able to hear whether or not I was lying,\u201d Stiles points out, giving Derek a stern look that completely belies the way his stomach feels like the floor just dropped out from under him and he\u2019s in that split second before gravity caught up and dragged him down. \u201cScott can be a stubborn little prick sometimes, once he\u2019s made up his mind about a person, and I think he\u2019s wrong about you, and I reserve the right to challenge him on it whether you like it or not. Capice?\u201d \u00a0 Derek\u2019s (failed) attempt at a scowl has lifted significantly by the time Stiles finishes his rant, not really much of a smile but still a definite softness in lieu of the weight normally turning Derek\u2019s lips down. He\u2019s watching Stiles like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with this foreign creature, like he thought he\u2019d caught a fish and suddenly it sprouted wings and made to fly, but he also looks like he doesn\u2019t necessarily hate the surprise. \u201cAm I allowed to talk yet?\u201d he asks, and there\u2019s gruff amusement in his voice. Stiles nods and gestures one hand graciously towards him. \u201cI meant the trust part.\u201d \u201cWell then you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Stiles snaps quickly, and there\u2019s a little something sharp in his voice, a whip crack that snags Derek\u2019s attention like lightning. \u201cI have never, once, not ever, said I don\u2019t trust you. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure the first time you accused me of not trusting you I threw the treading-water-in-a-pool-supporting-two-hundred-pounds-of-deadweight-trying-not-to-get-us-both-drowned equivalent of a hissy fit temper tantrum.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2026\u201d Derek starts, and Stiles throws his hands sky high in a fit of drama. \u201cJesus Christ, yes,\u201d he cries. \u201cYes, I trust you. You idiot. You make dumbass decisions entirely too often, and sometimes you think with your claws too much and your brain not enough. But you\u2019ve put yourself between me and danger more than once, and I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019d take your word for it if you told me the sky suddenly changed to purple, but maybe I\u2019d go outside and double check just to be sure, because I trust you enough to at least maybe give you the benefit of the doubt. And Holy God, Derek, I really need you to stop looking at me like that.\u201d Derek, who\u2019d spent the majority of Stiles newest diatribe fighting (and failing again) to keep his expression neutral, finally caved to a small, amused smile, lips pressed together like it\u2019ll minimize the effect of the expression, like the effort to disguise his growing amusement will make any difference to the pathetic way Stiles\u2019 heart is melting to goo and dripping through his ribcage. \u201cSeriously,\u201d Stiles says desperately, closing his eyes and scrubbing his hand down over his face, \u201cyou have no idea. I look at you like that and I just think Jesus, you should smile like that all the time. All the time. If you\u2019re not careful I\u2019m going to wind up spending the rest of my life trying to make you smile, like that, like you mean it. And not because it makes your already delicious face unbearably beautiful, but because it means you\u2019re happy. Because fuck, Derek, you should be happy. You deserve to be happy.\u201d He finally blinks his eyes open as he trails off helplessly, and it\u2019s small consolation that the smile is gone. Gone, because Derek looks gutted. He doesn\u2019t make a sound, save the slow tensing of his jaw as his lips press into a tight, grim line. Doesn\u2019t move, keeps his eyes firmly locked on Stiles, and it\u2019s a look Stiles recognizes. Derek tracks him like a threat, like Stiles\u2019 every move, every breath, is a potential attack, and that\u2019s more than enough of an answer for Stiles. \u201cShit,\u201d he breathes, because he\u2019s said too much, way too much, more than enough. The easy camaraderie, the fond amusement, it\u2019s all shattered like Stiles shot a bullet straight through it, and there\u2019s no way to pick up that many pieces. Derek\u2019s still staring at him like Stiles has gone feral right in front of him, like he\u2019s hyper-tense and bracing himself for Stiles to attack, and Stiles doesn\u2019t have anything left in him to even begin to deal with that. He lets himself out without another word, pulling the new front door soundly shut behind him, and he can feel Derek\u2019s eyes on him all the way back to the Jeep, forceful and wary even through the glass pane of the picture window. Stiles waits until he\u2019s a safe distance away, and never in his life has he been more grateful for the time he and Scott specifically tested the exact distance necessary to be out of hearing range from the Hale house, pulls the Jeep into park, and slams both hands hard against the wheel. It does nothing but make his palms sting, angry, frustrated tears pricking the corners of his eyes, and Stiles refuses, he absolutely refuses to cry over Derek fucking Hale. He throws himself out the door, because the Jeep is too small, too enclosed, and he can\u2019t take another second of it, and stalks off in a direction that won\u2019t bring him even remotely close to the Hale property line.\n \u201cA little bird told me that you had a little run in with a dead body this morning.\u201d\u00a0 Stiles pulls the phone back away from his ear to look at the caller id again, to check that it really is Lydia who called five consecutive times until he gave up and answered his phone without a word. It is. \u201cStiles?\u201d He quickly raises his cell back up to press against his ear, swiping his free hand across his face like it makes a damn difference. \u201cThe same little bird told me you then spent the day hiding out at the newly rebuilt Hale house.\u201d \u201cYou know some very talkative birds,\u201d Stiles complains, and he knows immediately that it\u2019s a mistake. His voice has that definitive hoarseness to it that is only achieved by an extended amount of angry screaming and maybe a few discretely shed tears, and Lydia is smart enough to narrow in on that like a vulture. \u201cStiles,\u201d she demands quickly, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d He offers a derisive snort in response, because Lydia\u2019s an idiot if she thinks she\u2019ll get it out of him that easily, and over the phone no less, and he can hear her frustrated exhale back. \u201cHow far are you from your car?\u201d \u201cMaybe twenty minutes,\u201d he admits, because there\u2019s really no point in asking how she knew. \u201cGreat, you have thirty to get here,\u201d she informs him, and it\u2019s not a suggestion. Stiles is already turning on his heel towards the quickest route to his Jeep, because it\u2019s better to go along with it than to argue, and because there\u2019s also no point in denying that he really needs Lydia right now. \u201cAre you good to drive?\u201d she asks, and Stiles nods a few times before remembering she can\u2019t see him. \u201cYeah.\u201d He makes it there in twenty-five, and Lydia\u2019s waiting for him at the front door with her arms crossed and a stern expression on her face. Stiles is halfway towards the front porch before she catches a good look at him, and by the time he\u2019s made it up the steps she looks almost as heartbroken as he feels, and he doesn\u2019t protest as she reaches out to pull him into a wordless hug. \u201cMom\u2019s out for the night,\u201d she tells him, shifting her grip to tug him inside and straight up the stairs. \u201cWhich means we are going to sit on my bed and drink the wine I stole from Lucy\u2019s stash and you\u2019re going to give me a list of hopefully unconvincing reasons why I shouldn\u2019t go rip Derek Hale to pieces. Also, should I call Danny?\u201d \u201cNo. At least not yet, but maybe later. Shit, when the hell did you become my best friend?\u201d Stiles mumbles back, tossing himself bodily onto Lydia\u2019s thick pillows. It\u2019s genuine wonder, not disagreement, and from the all-knowing look Lydia flashes him he\u2019s confident she picked up on the distinction. \u201cRight around the time that you stopped trying to get into my pants,\u201d she reminds him, handing him the already open bottle of Pinot Grigio that had been waiting on her dresser. \u201cWhich, incidentally, I think probably coincides with the first time you actively realized that you want to lick Derek\u2019s abs.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember saying anything about Derek,\u201d Stiles grumbles, taking a swig straight from the bottle because glasses are for leisurely drinking, not heartache-induced alcohol binges. \u201cAnd I also didn\u2019t realize you noticed.\u201d \u201cThat you stopped trying to get into my pants?\u201d Lydia repeats, reaching for the wine and pouring a glass for herself. \u201cI dragged you to a party, got drunk, sat on your lap, and told you Jackson wasn\u2019t coming back and we were never ever ever getting back together and it still didn\u2019t even occur to you to make a move.\u201d Stiles remembers that night vividly \u2013 remembers having the same epiphany in the midst of his crisis over Derek. Somehow he\u2019s not entirely surprised Lydia picked up on it too. \u201cHave you ever seen Derek smile?\u201d he says in response, pushing further back into Lydia\u2019s rich pillows and reclaiming his bottle of wine. \u201cLike, not a smirk or a sneer or a fake, pretend smile, but an actual, proper, something just amused me I am pleased smile?\u201d \u201cNo?\u201d Lydia frowns at him like he doesn\u2019t make sense for even considering the question. \u201cHas anybody?\u201d He watches the realization dawn on her fair features, another wave of sympathetic understanding lighting her eyes. \u201cYou have,\u201d she supplies. Stiles nods unnecessarily. \u201cI mean, aside from the fact that it\u2019s like stupidly breathtaking,\u201d he admits, twisting his fingers around the glass neck, \u201cit\u2019s also like one of the saddest fucking things you\u2019ve ever seen. Because he smiles, and it\u2019s so noticeable because he\u2019s got a face that\u2019s just made for smiling, and then you realize that you wouldn\u2019t have noticed it as being anything extraordinary if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s normally so miserable.\u201d \u201cI know he\u2019s not exactly the poster boy for happy happy joy joy,\u201d Lydia says gently, \u201cbut is he really that miserable?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles breathes, and it breaks him all over again. Lydia squirms her way next to him, nestling into the valley between pillows that Stiles has wedged himself into. He worms his arm out from where it\u2019s pinned between their torsos and curls it around her back, pulling himself a little tighter against her. \u201cYeah, Lyds, I think he really is. And it\u2019s not fair, because he deserves to be happy. He really does, he deserves a fucking break, just for once, and I just\u2026\u201d \u201cYou thought maybe you could give him that,\u201d she finishes. He carefully toasts his bottle against Lydia\u2019s delicate wine glass, helping himself to another long swig before pouring more into her now empty glass. Yeah. He did. Or he\u2019d hoped, at least. He\u2019d hoped that maybe they were building something, something that Derek could trust, or rely on, or maybe even something that just gave him a second to breathe every now and then. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says gently. He rolls his eyes, and she doesn\u2019t even have to look at him to know he\u2019s protesting. \u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d she insists, shoving herself upright and turning to look him in the eye. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot, because you\u2019re absolutely right that he could use some good in his life, and you are nothing if not good.\u201d She exhales a frustrated sigh and takes another sip of wine, and Stiles knows better than to think that means she\u2019s finished. \u201cHe changes around you,\u201d she tells him finally. \u201cThat\u2019s how I knew it was Derek. He looks at you like you can fix him, like you\u2019re his solution.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Stiles snorts, \u201cit\u2019s called a punching bag for werewolf anger management.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Lydia shakes her head vehemently. \u201cIt\u2019s because you ground him. He needs you, and I thought maybe he knew that, but I guess not. I knew you were going to get burned by it, and he is an idiot.\u201d Stiles stays quiet for a minute, lets himself dissect that one a few dozen times. He\u2019d thought about it, in some of his less self-depreciating moments. Thought about the way he\u2019d offered Derek an outlet, a safe zone, that maybe he\u2019d become something for Derek to rely on. Well. So much for that. Maybe Lydia catches the way he\u2019s drifting off on a tangent, or maybe she\u2019s just smart enough to know when he can\u2019t talk about it anymore, because she doesn\u2019t say another word. She twists around and leans back off the bed, straightening up again with an iPad connected to a stupidly long HDMi cable, and her TV remote.\nStiles is only a little surprised by her choice of Heathers, and even if it does ultimately lead to a perfunctory discussion of Gerard\u2019s body it also sparks a twenty minute long comparison of the Heathers and Veronica versus Regina George and Cady Heron. The debate leads to an extremely critical viewing of Mean Girls and a competitive round of who can accurately quote the most lines in a row (a dead tie, Stiles is unashamed to admit). They\u2019re halfway through a third bottle of wine when the second movie ends and Lydia throws his abandoned phone into Stiles\u2019 lap.\u00a0 \u201cCall your dad,\u201d she orders. \u201cTell him you\u2019re spending the night.\u201d Stiles shrugs, because honestly he shouldn\u2019t be driving anywhere right now, and his dad can just deal. And maybe commend his excellent decision making skills. Besides, Lydia may as well be his sister for all the sexual attraction he\u2019s feeling for her right now, and hell how weird is that feeling still. \u201cStiles?\u201d whoops, he can hear his dad frowning. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but didn\u2019t I text you about coming home hours ago?\u201d \u201cYou are so right,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cI got a little\u2026sidetracked. Yeah. Sidetracked.\u201d \u201cSidetracked,\u201d the Sheriff repeats flatly, like he doesn\u2019t believe a word of it. \u201cWell it sounded better than brutally got my heart crushed into little pulpy pieces and spent a solid hour or two stomping around the woods sobbing like a little kid until Lydia convinced me to come to her house,\u201d Stiles grumbles, and Lydia\u2019s hazy brown eyes narrow sharply at him. Er. \u201cClearly I missed something,\u201d his dad says carefully, \u201csince last time I checked Lydia was the only person with the power to break your heart, so I can\u2019t really imagine why you\u2019re at her house right now.\u201d \u201cOh that,\u201d Stiles waves his free hand dismissively. \u201cSomewhere along the lines Scott started cheating on me with Isaac Lahey because they\u2019re all wolfy bros or whatever and Lydia kind of became like my best friend and go-to source in cases of extreme emotional emergencies, and it\u2019s possible that she coaxed me out of the woods and into her house and let me lay on her bed and cry into a bottle of wine and watch chick flicks. Apparently that\u2019s the thing to do when a boy breaks your heart.\u201d There\u2019s a long moment of silence on the other end of the line, long enough for Stiles to start wondering which of the many revelations tripped his dad up - Scott befriending yet another one of the police department\u2019s past suspects, Scott and Stiles being on the outs, Lydia and Stiles being on the in (?), or Stiles having his heart broken. By a boy. Man. Wolf? \u201cI\u2019m guessing there was actually more than one bottle of wine involved, yeah?\u201d the Sheriff says finally. Oh yeah. That one too. \u201cPossibly,\u201d Stiles says cagily. \u201cPossibly enough that I\u2019d be much better off spending the night here instead of trying to drive home?\u201d \u201cAre you sure the Martins don\u2019t mind?\u201d \u201cPositive,\u201d Stiles spares Lydia half a glance, she nods without question. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll come home first thing in the morning, you won\u2019t even notice I was gone.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019re not going to talk about this, Stiles,\u201d his dad warns, but Stiles has already moved on, checked out of the conversation now that he\u2019s fulfilled the necessary checking in responsibility. Lydia\u2019s still giving him that look when he hangs up, something gently scolding and accusatory, and he shrugs guiltily without really knowing what he\u2019s done. \u201cAn hour or two, Stiles?\u201d she says softly, and oh. Well yeah Stiles did say that, didn\u2019t he? \u201cMaybe closer to two,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really\u2026I mean, he triggered it, more than anything else, but it\u2019s been coming for a while. You know? Like when you have a totally shit day and you get detention for something someone else did and make a stupid mistake on a test and the entire day goes by without a single person talking to you and you go home to an empty house and make dinner for yourself and drop a glass and it\u2019s just a fucking glass it doesn\u2019t mean anything you can buy another one but all of a sudden you\u2019re losing your shit all because you dropped the stupid glass. You\u2019re not really crying over the broken glass, it\u2019s just the match that lit the fuse.\u201d Lydia gets up and fumbles with the blu-ray player under her TV, firmly keeping her back to Stiles as he drains the last few drops of wine from their third bottle lets it fall to the floor. When Lydia climbs back onto the bed and crawls across the mattress to curl up next to Stiles something that looks suspiciously like tear tracks stain her cheeks. She presses right up against him, elbowing him this way and that until they\u2019re both on their sides, Stiles hugging Lydia back against his chest and her arms bracketed over his. He doesn\u2019t know how she manages it, but even casting him as the unquestionable big spoon she still somehow arranged them so Stiles feels like he\u2019s being held just as tightly, just as securely as she is. \u201cWhen I was little and my parents would fight, my big sister would put this movie on for me to watch,\u201d she tells him quietly, the ghost of each word brushing over the bare skin of his bicep. \u201cShe told me to always remember that no matter what other shit we think is going on in the world there is always, always true love out there.\u201d Stiles knows she\u2019ll never admit, at least not out loud, how much she misses Jackson. Just like he\u2019ll never admit, not again, how much hope he\u2019d had riding on Derek, more than even he knew. So maybe they can\u2019t be with who they really want. And maybe their supposed best friends are too busy with other people, or sometimes too busy with each other, to really notice. But Stiles has Lydia now, and Lydia has him, and sometimes they have Danny too, and maybe it\u2019s not everything they want, but they\u2019ll do the damn best they can with what they have. Stiles falls asleep with the weight of Lydia heavy and warm in his arms and the sound of Westley and Buttercup fighting through hell and high water to prove that true love reigns supreme, and it\u2019s a start.\n He keeps his promise to come home as early as he can possibly manage to drag himself from Lydia\u2019s bed, pressing a kiss to her temple and letting himself out, but his dad\u2019s already left for the day by the time Stiles ducks under the crime scene tape and shuffles in through the front door. There\u2019s a large glass of water and three ibuprofen waiting for him on the kitchen table, a note propped against the glass promising that they\u2019ll discuss the terms of your grounding when I get home.\u00a0 Stiles washes down the pills with half the glass of water, chugging down the rest before refilling it to the top and stumbling towards the stairs. He can\u2019t say he\u2019s ever gotten drunk on exclusively wine before, and holy hell is it a hangover unlike any he\u2019s ever experienced. Stiles is more grateful than he\u2019d ever thought he\u2019d be over the fact that Scott will likely be way too distracted by Isaac to spring a surprise visit on him today \u2013 he has every intention of climbing right back into bed and sleeping til 2:00. Except, Stiles notes dully, elbowing his bedroom door open and zeroing in on the crumpled blankets on his bed, that might be difficult since someone else is already in it.  Derek is fast asleep and dead to the world, one arm shoved under Stiles\u2019 pillow and his feet, still in his heavy black boots, dangling off the end of the bed. If Stiles cared enough to guess he would assume that Derek hadn\u2019t meant to fall asleep, had been waiting there, maybe, and nodded off before Stiles made it home\u2026but he doesn\u2019t care. And he\u2019s way too hungover for this. \u201cNo way,\u201d he snaps, depositing the glass of water on one of the shelves that made up his headboard. \u201cGet up, and get out. I mean it, Derek, I\u2019m not in the mood for this. Hey!\u201d Stiles shoves one hand against Derek\u2019s shoulder, pressing hard, and the werewolf moves all at once. He surges half-upright with a sudden inhale, bracing himself on the forearm still under Stiles\u2019 pillow and twisting his torso to bring him face to face with the unimpressed teen. Stiles makes a halfhearted attempt at raising an eyebrow that he abandons almost immediately after the dull throb of a headache; he settles instead for crossing his arms over his chest and looking as stern as possible with bloodshot eyes and still wearing yesterday\u2019s paint-splattered clothes. \u201cGreat, you\u2019re up,\u201d he snarls, \u201cnow get out.\u201d Derek blinks confusedly at him, only half-awake and clearly still fuzzy with the warm haze of sleep, and the combination of the soft, half-lidded look, the outrageous bed hair, and the overall warmth of Derek in his bed makes Stiles\u2019 stomach churn. He closes his eyes in a poor effort to block out the image, like it isn\u2019t already burned permanently into his memory, and resists the urge to just put his face in his hands and scream into his palms. \u201cYou smell like sour grapes,\u201d Derek tells him, heaving himself the rest of the way upright and twisting until he\u2019s seated normally on the edge of Stiles\u2019 bed, \u201cand Lydia.\u201d \u201cYour deductive skills are unparalleled, Sherlock,\u201d Stiles grumbles. He doesn\u2019t wait for Derek to finish his apparently complicated process of getting the hell out of Stiles\u2019 room; he shoves his way into the space Derek just abandoned and tugs the covers out from under him, pulling them up and over his head. \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d Derek starts, and Stiles is just not. \u201cNope!\u201d he says loudly. Too loudly. Ugh. \u201cI\u2019m hungover, and exhausted, and at the moment looking at you makes me feel like my internal organs are shriveling into dry husks and crumbling to pieces, so I just can\u2019t right now.\u201d He can feel Derek hesitating, hear the unspoken words hanging off the werewolf\u2019s tongue and the soft creak of floorboards as he indecisively shifts his weight, but Stiles promised Lydia last night that one emotional breakdown over Derek Hale was the absolute limit, and he\u2019s too damn tired to fight it now. \u201cPlease, Derek,\u201d he whispers quietly, and that does the trick. He\u2019s asleep before Derek even lands on the soft grass outside his window. Stiles is out cold for a solid two hours, and while it doesn\u2019t feel like much, it\u2019s enough to settle most of the pounding in his head and the way his stomach twists. He\u2019s still shaking like a leaf, and his brain feels like it\u2019s been wrung out like a sponge and left to dry, and his tongue feels like sandpaper in the desert of his mouth, and\u2026 \u2026his room smells like cheeseburger. His room smells like grease and cheese and bacon and curly fries and oh my god there comes all the saliva that he\u2019d been missing from his mouth, all back in full force drool attack because oh my god his room smells like heaven. Stiles sits up and throws the covers off himself and promptly freezes. Derek is perched on the edge of his desk chair, holding a grease-stained take out bag from Mel\u2019s in his hand and directing the faintest hint of puppy dog eyes at Stiles. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very conflicted right now,\u201d Stiles says carefully, tugging just the sheet back over his lap and trying not to care that he\u2019d apparently pulled his shirt off in his sleep. \u201cOn the one hand, you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m pretty sure I told you to get the fuck out. On the other, you\u2019ve come bearing the best thing I\u2019ve ever smelled in my entire life. Also, I\u2019m not sure if a burger at 10:00 am is entirely socially acceptable, but I\u2019m trying really hard not to give a fuck about what you think.\u201d Derek stands up and crosses the room in two quick strides, holding out the bag like a peace offering. He hovers for a beat too long, glances down at the mattress next to his knee, and Stiles rolls his eyes and gestures over-dramatically for Derek to sit. He perches himself on the very edge of the bed, as far from Stiles as he can manage while still being on the mattress. \u00a0 \u201cTechnically you didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t come back,\u201d Derek finally shrugs, scratching his now-free hand through the hair at the nape of his neck. \u201cAnd I have it on good authority that greasy diner burgers are the absolute best hangover cure.\u201d \u201cThought werewolves couldn\u2019t get drunk,\u201d Stiles mumbles, gathering up the absolutely dripping burger (so rare it\u2019s practically still mooing, just the way he likes it). \u201cOh my god, is that a fried egg? Is there a fried egg on this burger? I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s brilliant or disgusting.\u201d \u201cTaste it,\u201d Derek urges. \u201cIt\u2019s a brunch burger\u2026the egg makes it an acceptable breakfast meal.\u201d Stiles takes a bite, and it\u2019s entirely not his imagination that his porn-worthy moan is the reason for the small quirk of Derek\u2019s lips. It hurts in the worst way possible \u2013 Stiles is selfish in his desire to claim that smile as his own, after he\u2019d made such a point about wanting Derek to smile for himself and not for anyone else\u2019s benefit. It\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s a lot, sitting in his bed feeling lousy and vulnerable, eating the (best damn) food Derek brought him specifically for the purpose of helping him feel better, and not dying to know why it can\u2019t be more. Why they can\u2019t be more. \u201cWerewolves can\u2019t really get drunk,\u201d Derek tells him, still almost smiling at the way Stiles is going to town on his brunch. \u201cNot without a substantial amount of effort. But I did go to college, it\u2019s hard not to pick up a few basic alcohol-related life skills.\u201d \u201cDid you really?\u201d Stiles stops fawning over his burger long enough to glance up at Derek, both eyebrows lifted in surprised. He hadn\u2019t really given much thought to what Derek and Laura must have gotten up to in the years between their departure from and subsequent return to Beacon Hills, but he never would have guessed college was Derek\u2019s top choice. \u201cEducation was always important in our family,\u201d he says quietly. He\u2019s not looking at Stiles anymore, but Stiles doesn\u2019t hold it against him. \u201cCollege was a big deal, Laura and I both went. I was working on my Masters when Laura\u2026\u201d He trails off, and Stiles clears his throat, replacing the remaining half of his burger in the Styrofoam tray. \u201cYou should finish,\u201d he suggests. \u201cSee if you can finish up from home maybe, or transfer somewhere closer.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek nods. \u201cMaybe.\u201d Silence falls awkward and heavy, Stiles picking at his fries and Derek twisting a napkin between his fingers. It\u2019s the first time in a while they\u2019ve been this uncomfortable around each other, since the beginning of the summer, really, and Stiles can\u2019t help but feel guilty about it.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asks softly, keeping his eyes trained on the fry he was slowly uncurling.\u00a0 \u201cI needed to\u2026\u201d Derek sighs, shifts his weight, tries again. \u201cI\u2026you left before I really had a chance to figure out what to say.\u201d \u201cI got the idea anyway,\u201d Stiles mutters, tossing the broken halves of the fry back into the tray and lifting the whole thing out of his lap. He settles it carefully on the floor by his bed before straightening up again, fixing his eyes somewhere near Derek\u2019s right knee but still not quite looking straight at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you did,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cAt least, not the right one.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cEveryone likes to act like you\u2019re this emotionally constipated wolf who doesn\u2019t know how to use his words, but you can\u2019t fool me. I\u2019ve heard entirely too much mumbo jumbo feelings mumbling from you, I know you\u2019re capable of putting words together and expressing yourself.\u201d Stiles is certain he doesn\u2019t quite mask the lie that sits in that middle bit, but Derek\u2019s kind enough not to call him out on it. \u201cYou make me happy,\u201d Derek tells him, sudden conviction like steel in his voice. \u201cYou said I deserve it, but I need you for that. It\u2019s selfish and unfair and that doesn\u2019t stop me from wanting it. From wanting you.\u201d Stiles mulls that over, busies himself with wiping the greasy remnants from his fingers onto the sheets he was planning on washing today anyway. When he finally looks up Derek\u2019s stuck somewhere between apprehension and resignation, and Stiles tries to stamp down on the sudden need for him to be so much closer. \u201cAnd what stopped you from saying that yesterday?\u201d he asks instead, because it seems like a pretty dramatic difference from Derek\u2019s defensive stance from the day before. Derek growls in frustration, soft enough that it sounds more like a particularly harsh sigh than anything wolfy. It\u2019s kind of cute. \u201cYesterday I wasn\u2019t really, I mean,\u201d he runs a hand through his still-tousled hair, pouting at Stiles like he doesn\u2019t understand why the teen doesn\u2019t just get it. \u201cI might have still been under the impression that you were in love with Lydia. Possibly dating her. And that what you were saying and what I wanted were two subtle but very different things.\u201d \u201cYour information is out of date,\u201d Stiles says firmly, even though the logical corner of his brain is doing some fast-acting connect-the-dots and he can kind of see how Derek drew that conclusion. He\u2019s had entirely enough miscommunication though \u2013 he pushes himself forward on his knees and loops a hand around Derek\u2019s arm, tugging until the werewolf falls in closer towards him. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cBy Lydia herself, actually. Aggressively.\u201d That\u2019s a story for later, Stiles muses, because Lydia mentioned no such thing but he\u2019s sure Derek\u2019s telling the truth. He focuses on moving forward instead, because Derek still hasn\u2019t gotten the hint on where Stiles would like him, and he drags himself forward until both his knees are pressed to Derek\u2019s thigh, fingers dropping lower to curl loosely around Derek\u2019s wrist. Derek makes an aborted move towards Stiles, free hand twitching like he\u2019s not quite sure if he\u2019s allowed to reach out and touch. \u201cLydia has somehow landed herself into the much-coveted position of Stiles\u2019 Best Friend,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cIt\u2019s shockingly platonic, all things considered. You\u2019ll have to take my word for it.\u201d Derek moves more decisively now, dropping his palm flat to Stiles\u2019 thigh and curling his fingers tightly into the fabric of the teen\u2019s shorts. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust you.\u201d Stiles freezes, staring at him with wide blown eyes. That\u2019s a huge thing for Derek to say to him, somewhere up there with a love confession (which Stiles isn\u2019t entirely ready for, so really, this might actually mean more), and the steady expression on Derek\u2019s face means he knows it. \u201cBut you \u2013 you always \u2013 since when?\u201d Derek\u2019s hand slide up further to find the curves of Stiles\u2019 bare hip bones, thumb pressing into the dip where skin pulls taut and fingers stretching out to curl back around his flank. \u201cThe animal hospital,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhen I asked you to cut my arm off. You were scared out of your mind, but if it meant saving my life you were absolutely going to do it. I knew you would, could see it all over your face, and that was it. You\u2019ve never given me a reason to second guess it, even if I\u2019ve lied about it.\u201d Stiles is speechless for all of about thirty seconds before he realizes there is a perfectly legitimate, perfectly viable response that doesn\u2019t require him to find a way to verbalize the overflow of emotions threatening to break him. He curls his free hand around the side of Derek\u2019s neck, cradling his jaw and brushing the pad of one thumb over Derek\u2019s bottom lip in a deliberate warning as Stiles guides him forward. Derek does nothing but pull him closer, wrapping his arm fully around Stiles\u2019 hips and tugging until the teen is nearly seated in Derek\u2019s lap, and when they meet in the middle it\u2019s because they both moved with intent. It\u2019s careful and mostly chaste, a deliberate catch of lip between lips, the barest graze of teeth and a curious slide of tongue. Stiles holds Derek firmly still even when they break apart, keeping their faces close. \u201cJust so we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d Stiles whispers, leaning into it as Derek shifts to press their foreheads together, scant inches between their mouths. \u201cThis means I like you. A lot. And not in a friendly, platonic bros sort of way.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek nods and Stiles can feel it more than he can see it. \u201cYeah I got that this time.\u201d And there it is. Small and soft, a gentle quirk in one corner, a hint of teeth.
