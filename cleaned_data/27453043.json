The man in the mirror becomes a stranger to him; he looks into the glass and wonders how everything became so distorted and backward and...wrong. He notices in bursts: when Teddy grows taller than him, when he\u2019s kissing Ginny on her lips and looking at the subtle smile lines she\u2019s starting to develop around her plush mouth.

This is the first Christmas after Thanos got all snappy-snappy</p>\n<p>Thor is okay with magic because he's Asgardian. Korg is just a nice guy. Next chapter more people will be confused by Harry. This one is all about the feels.</p>\n<p>Some people think Harry's Loki again. It's like... no one can imagine a new magic-user in the MCU who's not Loki (Except for Wong, and Doctor Strange and Wanda and... but that's NOT the point. Okay?) Black hair and green eyes and magic = Loki, right?</p>",

The most requested thing was for me to write both the pre-planned fic and also the Loki fic. I like this plan. I shall turn this into a series. The first in the series will not go much into Loki at all. The only thing I am changing is that the originally intended epilogue for this fic will be moved to the next fic. After this fic ends, Harry will continue on with adventures in the TVA. I can't tell you any more than that because spoilers, but I've already started outlining that one so hooray. </p>\n<p>It will probably be called \"Harry Potter and the Hourglass of Life\"</p>\n<p>Idk what the series as a whole will be called yet. But yeah, if you like Loki, you'll get Loki, you just have to wait a bit. If you don't like Loki/care about the TV show, don't read the next fic in this series. </p>\n<p>And that's all from me, folks. Thanks for giving me your comments!</p>\n<p>CONTENT WARNING:<br>The following section will include descriptions of death, building damage, suicide attempts, and medical treatment.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So I know there wasn't a whole lot of Harry/Thor in that fic chapter -- or none at all -- but I promise there will be more next chapter. Why Harry ends up where he does will be explained next chapter. I just needed a chapter that acknowledged how traumatic and terrible the snap was and May needed to be the one to show that. The MCU really just glossed over the Snap and it bothered me.</p>\n<p>Yes, I took liberties with this chapter and the MCU timeline. I just kinda liked it this way. Please leave a comment/kudos if you feel so inclined.</p>\n<p>Harry: I can heals the people.<br>Thor: Go heals them then.<br>Harry: But what if they call me a witch and try to burn me at the stake?<br>TQP: You're immortal. You'll survive.</p>\n<p>I'm baaack ladies and gentlemen. Also Loki's ending was awful and I'm not sure about advertising that one so there. This chapter was inspired by \"i used to have nothing and then\" by \"dirgewithoutmusic\" which you should all go and read. I really liked the way dirgewithoutmusic presented the soul stone and I used a similar structure with this chapter. Hope this was worth the wait and thank you everyone for waiting.</p>\n<p>I will start responding to comments soon :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thor: Where's my screentime?<br>TQP: Where's MY screentime?<br>Loki: Oh, how cute. You think you have problems. Well, I got a whole lot of screentime in this solo TV show with like seven thousand different versions of MYSELF and then I couldn't even get any kind of ENDING. I don't have an ENDGAME like the both of you so why don't you just stop complaining? Huh?<br>TQP: Your brother's touchy.<br>Thor: He's adopted</p>\n<p>Heeeey sorry about the long hiatus. We're two chapters from the end now. I was really busy this semester but this fic is now my #1 priority and will be done, I promise, by January 27th. Maybe earlier. Thanks for your patience.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Banner: I never got to snap<br>Stark: Me neither<br>Harry: Oh, snap!<br>Stark: No need to rub it, God.<br>Banner: Some people. </p>\n<p>Anywho thanks for reading! Please leave a comment or a kudos if you feel so inclined and stay safe out there!</p>\n<p>Aahahaha I'm back. Just one chapter left. You may want to re-read chapter five for clarity.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thor: My boyfriend is better than your husband.<br>Pepper: Not true. My husband invented the arc reactor.<br>Thor: MY boyfriend invented being the Master of Death.<br>Pepper: My husband flew a nuke into space to save New York<br>Thor: My boyfriend became God for a little bit to save the universe.<br>Pepper: Fine. You win.<br>Thor: I do. </p>\n<p>Please leave kudos if you feel so inclined, or a comment to know I am not writing into the void</p>\n<p>I find it hysterical how many people enjoy this fic. To be honest, I wrote out my other two fics to have like themes and overarching stories and plots. Especially Dripping Fingers. That fic has a 26 page document I use to keep track of all the things I need to keep track of. This fic is not like those other fics. (not like the other girls.) I wrote this fic to be purely self-indulgent. I was just like, \"eh may as well make it public.\" Thanks for indulging me with this and your comments.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in my other works, I have two HP fics called Another Mind Game and Dripping Fingers (prior mentioned) I highly recommend.</p>\n<p>Have you read both and are feeling interested in what I do outside of fic writing? Look up my book called \"Dear the Man Upstairs\"</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thor: So, were you hot?<br>Loki: What? Thor, Ohmygawd<br>Thor: You said you kissed yourself? So, was girl-you hot?<br>Loki: ...<br>Thor: ...<br>Loki: Okay, fine, fine! She was very hot. But she was more than that. She was strong, smart, witty. Treacherous, arguably.<br>Thor: Sounds like you.<br>Loki: She WAS me.<br>Harry: Yikes.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all you lovely people who came along on this journey with me. It's been a bit more than a year, and we are here at the end. It's been a pleasure and an honor to share these chapters with you. Please leave a kudos or one last comment if you feel so inclined.</p>",
    "text": "\nIt starts slowly, the steady disconnect between who he is and who he should be. The man in the mirror becomes a stranger to him; he looks into the glass and wonders how everything became so distorted and backward and...wrong. He notices in bursts: when Teddy grows taller than him, when he\u2019s kissing Ginny on her lips and looking at the subtle smile lines she\u2019s starting to develop around her plush mouth. She\u2019s got the cutest crinkles by her eyes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHis face is smooth as it was when he was seventeen. Which was \n\n18\n\n years ago. He hasn\u2019t aged a day.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Ron and Hermione start going grey, he invests in a cauldron and learns how to brew a potion that gives him the appearance of aging. He pretends not to notice the collective sigh of relief from all his friends.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge throws an arm around his shoulder during a Sunday brunch and jokes, \u201cwas worried you\u2019d been bitten by a vamp, for a sec there. You just had damn good genes.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHarry forces a smile. \u201cMust be my Potter luck.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRon guffaws and raises a glass. \u201cTo the Potter luck. Here\u2019s a toast for shit childhoods and smoking hot adulthood.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuna, curled around Neville\u2019s arm, gazes dreamily around the room. \u201cAging is the process of dying slowly. Those who don\u2019t age die in a flash. It takes one minute and they go from living to dead -- they don\u2019t spend much time at all fading away.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHermione coughs uncomfortably. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit dark, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuna looks confused. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d She winks at Harry, \u201cSometimes it means you get more time.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNeville looks at Harry then, too. \u201cSo you decided to get some wrinkles like the rest of us mortals, hmm?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEveryone else is still chatting and laughing at Harry\u2019s new selection of wrinkles. Something about the couple at the end of the table, the rugged herbology professor and his ethereal researching wife, niggles a piece at the back of Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n You decided to get wrinkles like the rest of us mortals\n\n... It was presented like a conscious choice.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSometimes it means you get more time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHis three children graduate Hogwarts and he embarrasses them terribly. Ginny laughs beside him, face red as her hair used to be, eyes pleased and fond.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe tells her she\u2019s still beautiful when her breasts sag and her face is decorated in miniature soft folds. Her breaths come shorter, her runs have turned to walks, her hips ache something fierce most nights. He studies potion books and notes from Severus Snape to make the aging potion more potent, starts drinking more of it, grits his teeth against the foul taste -- all to look the right age.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe carries Ginny up the stairs in their home when her knees start to go. She laughs and calls him a romantic. \u201cYou can just levitate me, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe kisses her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you that I\u2019m a romantic who was raised by muggles, my beloved pureblood princess.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShe swats his arm. \u201cStop that. I\u2019m a blood-traitor.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTheir children find them hysterical when they come and visit. Albus curls a hand around Scorpius\u2019s waist and whispers, \u201cWe\u2019ll be just like them when we\u2019re older.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he lays Ginny down in her grave, he feels a piece of himself go under the soft earth with her.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuna lays a withered hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll get easier with time. She\u2019ll always be a part of you, but there will be others.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHarry, tears streaming down his face, turns to gaze into her anguished blue eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShe gives him a sad smile. \u201cThis is nowhere near your ending. You smell like crickets and withered asphodel. You\u2019ve been trying so hard to look like an old man, haven\u2019t you? But you\u2019ve still many years yet. You\u2019ll bury me soon, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHarry stares out at the graveyard where his children all stand holding one another. Hermione and Ron lie two graves down, tombstones filled with poetry of their love to each other, their children, and Harry. He's brought flowers to them every day for the past two years.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting less cryptic with age.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken me a bit to comprehend the speech patterns of those who stumble blindly in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe lays a bouquet of yarrow over Ginny\u2019s grave with the tenderness he used to use when curling a lock of red hair behind her ear and kissing her nose just to see it crinkle. \u201cIs that so? Then can I ask you something candidly now?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"I\u2019m quite certain you know that I was a Ravenclaw. I breathe for the opportunity to answer life\u2019s biggest questions.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe stands. \u201cWell then, will I ever die?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLuna bends slowly over Ginny's tomb and lays down a bunch of alstroemeria. She runs her hand through the blossoms. \u201cOh Harry, everything dies. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe does bury Luna. He leaves her no flowers. He gives her instead a pair of his shoes, a bottle-cap necklace and a note: \u201cto keep you safe from the Nargles.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe first Christmas he looks around at his children and realizes that they too are starting to look old, he decides he\u2019s had enough. He wants to go before he buries his babies next to his wife and best friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe takes enough Angel\u2019s trumpet to kill a troll and banishes the bottle. He closes his eyes in his overly large and empty bed. When his children find him in the morning, it will look like he passed peacefully in the night. He thinks, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll meet death like an old friend, walk with him into the world beyond.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nOH, BUT IT\u2019S NOT YOUR TIME YET, MY DEAR. NOT YET. NOT NEARLY YET.\n\n\nHe wakes up in the morning still regretfully alive. He has flashes of a dream with a man holding a scythe, Harry saying, \u201cbut death is what gives life meaning,\u201d and the figure just watching him and then dipping its head, IT IS NOT YOUR TIME.\n\u00a0\nSo Harry looks around the room he's shared with his beloved wife for over a century, looks down at the bed he's cuddled all his children and rubbed their backs when they were sick, and read to them when they didn't know their letters yet, with a heavy sense of loss. He packs up the things he cannot live without -- his wedding ring, his photo album of his children and friends and wife and his childhood broomstick, that last gift from the only parent he\u2019s ever known. The gift from a man who was perhaps also, in his soul, a terribly lovable dog full of love.\n\u00a0\nHe stashes them in a mokeskin bag and apparates away (to somewhere, anywhere far from this deathbed) blind -- a bad choice -- but he doesn\u2019t mind just now if he gets splinched along the way. His children are sleeping beneath him and James has always been magic sensitive, they\u2019ll hear the crack and James will feel the wards shift as Harry leaves the Potter estate for the final time.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been well-documented that about ten percent of wizards apparate in their final moments to end up with the people they love. It's considered the most romantic form of accidental magic. He hopes his children will hear the crack and believe that he has just gone to rest with Ginny in one last act of undying love.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe ends up moments later, dry-heaving, in Japan, staring out at Hokkaido\u2019s magical population. They ignore him -- just another British tourist come to discover the secrets of the East, just as ignorant as all the rest of them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe smiles. No one is looking for a young Harry Potter. People barely remember him outside of the old man who wrote a few textbooks. The war was already more than a century ago. He is no more immortalized than Dumbledore, reduced to a wizened form on a chocolate frog card.\n\u00a0\nThe Japanese wizarding world has never cared much for foreign politics, absolutely no one will see or even look for resemblance to the former hero of the Wizarding world. He can be completely anonymous here.\n\u00a0\nHe learns Japanese, he makes friends, he spends twenty years in the country before he gets the news that Lily Potter, the inventor of the Retinus Reparos Potion, the innovative brew that fixes poor eye-sight, has passed away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe drinks himself half-dead, memories playing behind his eye-lids. He remembers her at four years old, sitting on his knee, as he told her -- with a great many omitted details -- the story of his childhood. And then, the next day when they were playing with training wands and baking cookies, she said, \u201cYou be Daddy McGonagall, and I\u2019ll be baby McGonagall, and let\u2019s go get Draco for being out after-hours.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d teased, \u201cReally, baby? That\u2019s who you choose\u2026 Don\u2019t you want to be like Daddy? Or Aunt Hermione?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d rolled her tiny eyes. \u201cProfessor   McGonagall  can turn into a cat. I wanna be just like her. Come on, let\u2019s gooo~\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt had all been a ruse for her to play kitten and for him to carry her around because, \u201cDaddy cats carry baby cats, it\u2019s how it works, daddy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d refused to eat the cookies when they were out of the oven and insisted they both drink milk out of bowls.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d said he didn\u2019t imagine McGonagall would ever drink anything like a common pet cat, and she\u2019d swatted his wrist and said, in a frighteningly realistic tone, \u201c Professor  McGonagall, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the second time he tries to die. He\u2019s rejected yet again,  NOT YET. So he leaves Japan, travels to France and then Italy, and then Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. He never spends more than fifteen years in any one place, just enough time to learn the language and a few bits of new magic, before he moves on.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s 271 when his last grandchild dies. Ginevra Siri Potter apparated in death to be with her beloved, the eulogy says. She was just three when Harry Potter \u201cdied,\u201d and he moved on beyond his beautiful family. He remembers her flaming red hair and emerald green eyes and that she always tugged on his sleeves and asked him to make a Patronus. He feels a pang of regret that he never got to see her grow up. The eulogy says that she and her wife were soulmates; her wife\u2019s spirit guardian had been a doe, and just like her grandfather, Ginevra\u2019s Patronus had always been a stag. The eulogy continues, \u201cwith a love like that, it\u2019s no surprise the souls rejoined in death.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe lets himself fall off a cliff into the ocean by the coast of Ivory and hopes to find peace beneath the waves. He opens his eyes on a beach in the Cape of Good Hope, dusts off his robes, and continues on.\n\u00a0\nHis friendships with Wizards and Muggles alike are hollow but so is he. He acts young sometimes and sometimes acts old. He cannot forget that he was a father any more than he can forget that he was a lover, a friend, and once, a prized soldier. He is too many things at once -- it\u2019s more than a man can bear.\n\u00a0\nHe knows he is becoming something of a legend, documented through centuries, the green-eyed boy who is too wise for his appearance, showing up all over the world with knowledge in his eyes and the weight of the world balanced precariously on his back.\n\u00a0\nThere are poems written about the tragedy that he wears like a woven tapestry, there are ballads sung for his bravery -- he\u2019s worshipped for all of a half-decade by an odd group of monks in central Europe, but he puts an end to that\u2026 he stops trying.\n\u00a0\nHe lies in the center of a sand-dune somewhere, he can\u2019t remember, and just stares up at the sun, daring it to blind him so that he can be numb somewhere. He should die of thirst soon, he thinks. He\u2019s never had the patience before to just waste away, but he\u2019s giving it his best shot. He closes his eyes, finally. He\u2019s exhausted. And, silence, welcome silence, envelopes him in a thick blanket. At long last.\n***\n\u00a0\nThe silence is deafening. The silence is the only thing Harry can hear, it drowns out all his thoughts, his pains, his fears, and leaves him in a vacuum void of sound. His own breath is silent, his heartbeat is stalled, there is nothing, only silence.\n\u00a0\nHarry listens. He listens to the silence. He lets his eyes stare unblinking at the white which surrounds him, letting his mind empty until the silence passes through.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Clear your mind. Snape's voice echoes in the recesses of Harry\u2019s memory.\n\u00a0\n Clear your mind. Are you even trying?\u00a0 Harry smiles ever so slightly, remembering his former professor.\n\u00a0\n \u201cMy mind is clear now. Are you proud?\u201d  He is met again by silence.  \u201cBastard.\u201d His thoughts return to nothingness and he allows himself to fall forward, encased on all sides by an unshakable quiet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry startles when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He opens his eyes slowly, expecting to be met by Dumbledore. That was the first person he saw when he was dead the first time, and this was still \u201chis party, after all.\u201d Instead, he is met by a hooded figure holding a scythe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeath.\u201d He greets.\n\u00a0\nMASTER.\u00a0 Death inclines his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d Harry smirks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYOU HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY MASTER.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that a question?\u201d\n\u00a0\nI HAVE WATCHED YOU TRY TO DIE 327 TIMES. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI never asked to be immortal. This is your fault. But hey, I\u2019m here now in this void thing. I think it might even bring me that peace I\u2019ve always wanted to have. So why don\u2019t we say it\u2019s been a good run and you just let me die.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYOU CANNOT DIE, MASTER. NOT YET.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw shucks. Can\u2019t you get a new master?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNO.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you even like me?\u201d Death is silent.\n\u00a0\nI HAVE AFFECTION FOR YOU. YOU ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THING I HAVE EVER SPENT TIME WITH.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I have to live eternally to be your entertainment?\u201d Harry\u2019s green eyes flash.\n\u00a0\nBACK IN ONE OF\u00a0 OUR CONVERSATIONS, YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR LIFE HAS NO MEANING BECAUSE DEATH IS WHAT MAKES LIFE HAVE PURPOSE.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry nods, running a finger through his disheveled locks. Even in death, his hair is doomed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYOU ARE THE REASON DEATH HAS MEANING. FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME I KNEW THAT YOU WOULD BE MY MASTER, YOU AND NO OTHER. YOU WANT TO SAVE PEOPLE, YOU WANT TO HELP THEM, AND EVEN I AM NOT OUTSIDE OF YOUR COMPASSION. YOU GIVE ME MEANING, HARRY POTTER. DEATH HAS MEANING BECAUSE YOU LIVE.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry sighs and sat up from where he is lying in the void and finds himself sitting in an abandoned version of Diagon alley outside of a coffee shop that had most certainly never decided to exist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what, then? I\u2019m alive forever so other people can die? So you can be happy? I have to live forever to just continue to be the world\u2019s fucking savior.\u201d Death seems amused and sad all at once.\n\u00a0\nYOU WILL BE MY DELIVERANCE. WHEN ALL HAS RETURNED TO NOTHINGNESS, YOU WILL RETURN ME. UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE HOPE, HARRY POTTER. YOU ARE HOPE.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just hope to stay here, in this thing that feels like it might be the end.\u201d Harry crosses his arms like a child. Death rumbles in a way Harry recognizes as laughter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTHIS PLACE DOES NOT EXIST. SURELY YOU CAN SEE THAT. DO NOT WORRY, YOU HAVE SO MANY OPTIONS. I CAN SEND YOU ANYWHERE. BACK IN TIME. FORWARD IN TIME. ELSEWHERE.\n\u00a0\n\u201cElsewhere?\u201d Harry asks, interested.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry feels himself beginning to tingle and feels his feet lifting off the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow just wait here a minute, I never said I wanted to go anywhere, I just wanted to know what my options were, I was asking a question, and --\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes were beginning to close.\n\u00a0\nHAVE FUN MASTER. MAKE FRIENDS. SEND POSTCARDS.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou little --\u201d\n\u00a0\nEMPTY YOUR MIND. STRANGE TIMES ARE AHEAD. REMEMBER THAT NOT EVERY ENDING IS ONE OF MINE.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh for the love of --\u201d And Harry is pulled abruptly until all he hears is noise. There\u2019s the sound waves crashing against the shore. There\u2019s the noise of pained wails and tremulous laughter. There\u2019s a dog barking, a sizzle of cooking meat. After so many stolen moments of silence, it\u2019s\u2026 deafening.\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\nHarry looks around at where he\u2019s landed curiously. He\u2019s standing in the center of what appears to be a town square, a collection of modestly dressed tall men and women milling about with grief hanging heavy overhead. The sky is filled with grey clouds, promising rain but not delivering. Stray bits of hardy sunlight shine with unmatched daring through the dusting of darkness in the mid-morning sky.\n\u00a0\nBeyond the square lies a small village crafted in an odd mixture of modernity and ancient history, run-down cabins teeming with technology until the distinction between the past and present exists only in memory. It looks as though Yesterday kissed Tomorrow and refused to let go.\n\u00a0\nThe city rests on fields filled with snow and on docks by a grey sea, the water of the ocean grieving the absence of sun.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s an enormous Christmas tree in the center of the square decorated in golden shining lights that seem to be getting their power from sheer power of will only, sparkling brilliantly as a thousand miniature stars. The tree is the only green in this odd, frigid city, Harry\u2019s breaths turning white in the misty air.\n\nThere\u2019s a banner hanging in the square that says, \u201cLost, Never Forgotten.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry looks at the men and women who are looking at him with shock, and then -- with hope. He sees it the moment they all recover from his surprise appearance and begin to stare at him with unbridled longing, as though he is the key to whatever their tragedy appears to be.\n\u00a0\nHe straightens his clothing out, self-consciously, and realizes his hands have come away with a light dusting of\u2026 ash. He\u2019s covered, he realizes quite suddenly, in ash. He shakes it off.\n\u00a0\nA tall man with eyes bluer than sapphires and hair the color of spun gold comes striding forward and envelopes Harry in a tight embrace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWithout knowing what to do, Harry slowly returns it, entwining his arms around the absurdly muscular back of this absurdly muscular man. The man is shaking, he feels the tremors all through his body. There\u2019s growing wetness on the top of Harry\u2019s head. The man, he\u2019s crying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBrother, I thought you were dead, I thought you were dead. But you\u2019ve returned to me.\u201d Oh, Harry thinks. I understand this grief.\n\u00a0\nHarry pulls back gently and the man lets him go, eyes drinking in Harry's face hungrily. He gives the man an apologetic smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, whoever you are. I\u2019m not your brother.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man wipes his tears. \u201cBut your eyes\u2026\u201d he says softly, \u201cyour magic. You\u2019re not Loki?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cMy name\u2019s Harry. I hope you find him, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man whispers, \u201cI am Thor,\u201d as if he cannot help himself. \u201cBut you\u2026 you came from the ash. He's always been a trickster. I thought, surely,\u00a0 Loki wouldn\u2019t have truly died by the hand of Thanos, and I thought, perhaps, the ashes\u2026 he\u2019d have found a way to return if anyone could.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry lays a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLoss\u2026 it\u2019s the sort of thing that makes us all dream of impossibility. I am truly sorry I\u2019m not who you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA woman pushes through the crowd and then cups Harry\u2019s cheeks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou came from the ash. Are they coming back?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAre who coming back?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like a dam has been broken. Suddenly all the men and women crowd around him and Thor, throwing out dozens of questions. \u201cDid you see Vanrad?\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s Reinn?\u201d \u201cWhen\u2019s everyone else coming back?\u201d \u201cAre they safe?\u201d \u201cWere you alive the whole time?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s overwhelming to say the least. Harry can feel himself beginning to hyperventilate. He\u2019s not, he can tell, he\u2019s not what these people need. There\u2019s so much tragedy here and it\u2019s not his. He\u2019s given speeches before, for that first war with Voldemort, for the children murdered in World War Three for having been born with magic running through their veins, for the dead in the 4122 Pulmonavirus epidemic. But he lived through each of those terrible moments in history. His words meant something as a survivor (as the man who\u2019s survived far more than any other.) The shared experience of being part of the left behind gave him the ability to, if not always save, at least provide a modicum of comfort to his ever-changing pocket of community.\n\u00a0\nBut these people are not his. This sadness is not one he knows as intimately as the creases on the palm of his hands, as deeply as the smile lines he misses from Ginny\u2019s wide grins, it does not echo in his memory just as loudly as the high giggle of Lily when she first got on a broomstick.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a grief as poignant as any he\u2019s experienced, but it\u2019s theirs, these tall and haunted men and women living in a city above the grey sea, huddled around a glittering Christmas tree and looking to him as though he\u2019s the only light they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\u00a0\nA warm, large hand, at the base of his spine grounds him. Thor, deep voice rumbling, commands, \u201cBreathe. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d He feels the man exaggerate breathing in and out, and Harry follows suit. He watches his exhales materialize in the air.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry says quietly.\n\nThe man inclines his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite the journey, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe people of the town look at him far more gently, the desperation fading from their faces and melding into something compassionate.\n\u00a0\nOne person, a child, Harry sees, comes forward and tugs on his legs. \u201cDid you\u2026 Did you come back from the dead?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe yearning in the child\u2019s amber eyes reminds Harry that he can still answer the question with some comfort.\n\u00a0\nHarry kneels down to be of a height with the little boy. \u201cI have.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy asks, \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d\n\n\nHarry can see the entire town leaning forward, needing to hear these words the way starving men need food, the way crying children need their parents.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI woke up in what looked like a train station. The only person I saw was a mentor, a former teacher I admired, standing by an express. He said that I could go on the train or go... back. So I talked with him for a while, and when the time came\u2026 I left through a doorway, and returned to the land of the living.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA woman is looking at him with tears running down her face. \u201cWas it very cold?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry looks out at the snow dusting this odd town in the middle of winter. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, remembering the heat of golden sunlight seeping through the glass windows of King\u2019s Cross. \u201cIt was very warm.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman tries to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I'm so glad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think others will come back too?\u201d A tall man asks.\n\u00a0\nHarry doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened here, but he\u2019s afraid to ask. So instead, he replies, \u201cIf a door was open to me, it may open for another.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not an answer. It\u2019s barely a comfort. But in this moment, with ice hanging down from shingled rooftops, with a banner billowing promising those gone will not be forgotten, with a green tree glittering in gold, it seems to be enough.\n\u00a0\nThor pulls Harry to his feet. \u201cCome, Traveler Harry, allow me to give you some hospitality for at least the night. It is Yuletide and no one should be alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry has nowhere to go, and this man seems just as lonely as Harry\u2019s been for centuries. He understands grief better than perhaps anyone else, and he doesn\u2019t want to be alone either. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe follows the man through the crowd, which parts like he and Thor are Moses and they the sea, the two men crafting freedom out of miracles.\n\u00a0\nThey walk over the dirt path and icy ground, into a run-down cabin, oddly reminiscent of the shack where Harry spent his eleventh birthday and was introduced to magic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe home is a bit dirty on the inside, but it is far from the worst place Harry has ever stayed. There\u2019s a couch in a large room, bottles of empty beer, and a TV. The kitchen looks fairly empty, but there\u2019s a teapot sitting on a grime covered stove.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThor is looking at the place with a sheepish appearance of embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d the man says, \u201cwith all that has happened, I have not been in the right frame of mind to, to be, perhaps what people might have expected of me. Please do not judge me too much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry ambles over to the kitchen and fills up the kettle with water. \u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d he says, turning on the stove with a spark of magic and then putting the teapot on the stove. \u201cWhen you lose the people you love, it takes time to find out who you are again. And often, it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s not the person you were before.\u201d Harry thinks back to who he was when he had been 17 and in love, and who he is now, and knows that he\u2019s changed to the point where even Ron wouldn\u2019t recognize him (not all of him, at any rate) anymore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThor is looking at him, eyes wide and pained. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to go on, Traveler Harry. Half the world is gone, and it must be because I failed. If I had not been so arrogant, if I had not sought to prove myself and instead had been more like my brother, cunning and subtle -- if I had gone for the head --\u201d\n\n\nHarry cuts him off, \u201cThe people who survive always feel guilty. It is never your fault for living. But there\u2019s something I do for people when they feel like they can\u2019t go on.\u201d\n\n\nThor, voice very small, asks, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone feels better with a cup of tea.\u201d As though on cue, the teapot begins to boil and a sound like a whistle echoes through the house. Harry turns off the heat. He gives Thor a look of deep understanding. \u201cWhen the day is too dark and too cold, you can always put the kettle on.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry finishes making the tea and brings it over to Thor and hands it to the large man. The blonde man takes a sip, not thinking to question where the tea came from (Harry\u2019s Mokeskin,) and relaxes into the cushions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm.\u201d He says. \u201cThank you, Traveler Harry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust Harry is fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThor gives Harry a look that\u2019s all warm eyes, some frost thawing from the tragedy engraved in his stormy blue irises. \u201cJust Harry, then.\u201d\n\nWhen Harry wakes, it\u2019s to the feel of a hard body pressed to his back. He is uncomfortably warm but for some reason, he doesn\u2019t mind that his feet feel like they are touching miniature fires. He\u2019s not cold any longer, and he\u2019s been cold for such a long time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hasn\u2019t woken up in a bed with someone for at least three centuries. He\u2019s loved twice since Ginny, and each was harder than the last. He feels each of his former lovers\u2019 phantom lips press against his brows, his eyes, his \n\nlips\n\n most nights before he feigns sleep in an empty and freezing bed. He has sex, of course he does, but after he\u2019s done with whatever person thought he was attractive, he\u2019ll zip up his trousers, tousle his hair, and return to wherever he\u2019s staying alone. (It\u2019s easier that way. Because when people start to kiss him more than once, when they wind their hands in his silky hair and stroke -- he wants so very badly for them to love him. But he\u2019s a strange creature now and the more they know the more they shy away, as all people do, from things that scare them. As he does, from losing a true love yet again.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can\u2019t remember the last time he was held for nothing but being held -- the last time someone expected nothing for their comfort. He\u2019s learned to stop searching. But he slept last night, somehow, in this warm bed\u2026 with the hard body at his back. And he\u2019s still clothed so nothing untoward happened. Probably.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe vaguely remembers appearing in a new world, universe, time (maybe?), and the odd reaction to ash in this town touched by tragedy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe wonders about his odd introduction to\u00a0elsewhere\u00a0and makes to sit up in the bed of blue crumpled sheets, the cabin walls around them dark wood and empty chip wrappers decorating the floor like metallic confetti.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs he attempts to straighten himself, the strong mass at his back wraps one sturdy arm around his chest and pulls him back down.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is a deep rumble and then the command, \u201cSettle,\u201d spoken in a voice no less regal for its sleepiness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry presses his face back into the pillow. The arm around his chest relaxes slightly and large hands begin to absentmindedly pet his sides.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sensation is foreign but welcome and Harry closes his eyes, allowing the peace of this unmistakably odd moment to wash over him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis breaths are coming long and even when the door to the room is thrust open.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry opens his eyes to see a being made of\u2026 rocks\u2026 that is so weird, staring down at him with an expression of immense confusion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThor,\u201d the being says in a surprisingly friendly male voice, \u201cthere\u2019s a boy in your bed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe man behind him mumbles, \u201cWassat?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rock being seems distressed. \u201cThere is a \n\nboy \n\nin your bed,\u201d he hiss-whispers. His voice, despite its obvious discomfort, remains even-toned and friendly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, affronted, says, \u201cI\u2019m a man, thank you very little.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rock being is getting more and more anxious, but Thor finally wakes up and then sits up, white shirt rippling around his strong muscles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sits up as well, if only not to be at a disadvantage when staring at the strange rock being.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor breaks into a broad smile and spreads his arms as though welcoming a hug. The rock being comes forward and awkwardly clasps Thor around his middle, still staring at Harry.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKorg! How are you faring, my good man?\u201d Thor booms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe being -- Korg?-- pulls back and places its hands on Thor\u2019s shoulders. He scans the man\u2019s face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI saw you just yesterday and I\u2019m all good man. But there is a man in your bed. Are you being safe? Did you read my pamphlet about safety?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Harry grins at the friend of Thor, odd though it (he?) may be.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor pats Korg on its (his) back. \u201cDo not worry, loyal friend. This here is Harry and he is a traveler from beyond the Snap. He returned yesterday from ash.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKorg\u2019s eyes widen and then focus on Harry with ill-concealed hope. \u201cYou came back from the Snap?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is trying to piece together all the pieces of what he\u2019s seen: the banner, the sadness, the ash, the questions about life after death and he feels only regret.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere was an event here, wasn\u2019t there? For some reason, a lot of people died. Because of a snapshot moment? Did someone snap their fingers? I don't really...\u201d He cuts himself off, not sure how to express his complete confusion without giving everything away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor has one eye that\u2019s brown, Harry realizes. But both still feel blue. The blue eye right now is wider than the brown but both seemed shocked.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Thor breathes, \u201ca regular from Midgard who was Snapped would not have known what happened. Yes, Harry, it was Thanos who did the Snap and took half the universe.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry chokes, \u201c\n\nHalf the universe?\u201d \n\nHe looks to Korg to see if it's a joke, an exaggeration, but the laid back rock-creature just looks somber. Harry shakes his head. \u201cHalf the universe, Merlin. How\u2019d he manage that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThor shudders. \u201cMy failure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat doesn\u2019t feel like the full story. So Harry says, \u201cbattles are never lost or won by a single man. Don\u2019t get a god-complex just because things didn\u2019t work out well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor exhales once, sharp and angry. \u201cI am a God.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry again looks to Korg, who just shrugs. \u201cHe is, man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cNo one, even the most powerful person alive, is God.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor reaches beside him and pulls open the drawer of a dresser Harry did not notice due to all the clothing piled around it, and withdraws an odd-looking axe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am the God of thunder, and look at me, alone in a bed with a man who was dead just Yesterday and it was not even I who brought him back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis feels like the beginning of a guilt spiral and Harry can tell this man is dealing with a huge amount of survivor\u2019s guilt. Harry relates so strongly he decides to accept the possibility of hatred and discomfort that will come from his telling the truth. It's not as if he can die, he thinks bitterly. What's a bit of being dissected for laughs? It wouldn't be the first time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe scratches the back of his neck awkwardly, \u201cWell, so you see, I wasn\u2019t dead yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor tilts his head. \u201cYou were alive in the soul stone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks down at his ring. \u201cEm, never been in the soul stone? No one ever is really, in the stone, I mean, you just talk to the dead souls through it? Wait, how do you know about the soul stone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor\u2019s eyes sharpen from the kind of tired command to a king ready for war. They are intense and dark and disturbed\u2026. Haunted. Harry recognizes the look. He\u2019s worn it so many times for too many battles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Thor asks, voice filled with danger. He hasn\u2019t attacked him yet, but Harry can tell it\u2019s a close thing. Thor\u2019s muscles are rippling and Harry believes the man will lunge if he doesn\u2019t like the answer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry. But you know that. I, um, well I\u2019m from a different place. Elsewhere, I suppose. Like a different universe if I had to guess.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor and the rock being, Korg, stare at him. Harry stares back. Korg breaks up the tense moment by saying, \u201cI\u2019m from a different planet. Most of us are. We get it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor looks crestfallen. \"A different universe,\" he murmurs, \u201c...you didn\u2019t have the Snap there, did you? What was the whole thing about you having come back from the dead, then? Were you lying?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry shakes his head, aware that he is still in the bed with the man questioning him. \u201cNo. That wasn\u2019t a lie. I have died before -- and come back -- but that\u2019s the thing. Death doesn\u2019t really stick with me. Won\u2019t for a while, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor and Korg are silent and stare at one another as the self-proclaimed God of thunder twirls his axe in his hands.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou were in possession of the soul stone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, feeling a bit like an idiot but mostly like he has less than nothing to lose, holds up his hand where the Gaunt ring rests and has rested for more than three millennia. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve still got it. It\u2019s called the resurrection stone more commonly than soul stone, but I\u2019ve heard it both ways.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKorg shrugs, \u201cI think it\u2019s a different stone. The other one was yellow, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor gently holds Harry\u2019s hand, turning it around in enormous palms and running his fingers over the stone in the ring. \u201c...Yes,\u201d he replies absentmindedly, stroking little circles on the back of Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cI do not believe this is the same stone at all. Did this bring you to us, little traveler?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn a way?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor abruptly, still holding Harry\u2019s hand, stands and guides Harry off the bed with him. \u201cCome,\u201d he commands, \u201cYou shall tell me your story over breakfast and then I shall tell you mine. My brother was a better liar than you, I am sure, and his stories were told such that you could not imagine any other truth but the one he gave you. Your stories are told badly and with missing pieces -- all the more reason to believe they are real.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Thor guides Harry, one hand at the small of his back, into the cramped main room of the cabin from the night before, Korg -- who is very tall -- walking beside them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor and Korg seemed inclined to buy their breakfast out -- apparently, Thor\u2019s been gorging exclusively on fried foods and donuts since the Snap, and he has no interest in pulling himself together to make anything fresh.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, being an expert on guilt and coping mechanisms, asks if he can buy some things at the grocery store and make food instead. He says, voice full of vulnerability, \u201cIt just soothes me. Cooking helps.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the three of them toddle off to a rather small grocery store full of sad, tall people, milling about listlessly after their first Yule without half their community. It\u2019s heartbreaking. There are two women staring at a bottle of -- is that \n\nmead? -- \n\nand crying. One woman says, \u201cThis year she was to join us at the adult\u2019s table, we were going to have a toast about her bravery and gift her a bow and her first taste of golden wine but her seat was empty, do you see, it was empty\u2026. And now I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t --\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe breaks off into deep and heavy sobs and the other woman clasps her in a tight hug. \u201cI know,\u201d the other woman is saying, \u201cI know. Let it out now, let it out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry averts his eyes and buys some staples with money Thor gives him. They leave the store in silence, the whispers and cries of those in mourning creating a haunting harmony to the howling wind's melody. Harry looks at the large man on the walk back to the cabin, hands laden with groceries, and says, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor barks a humorless laugh. \u201cI am a king, Harry. I can provide for one scrawny boy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s not a boy. He's a man,\u201d Korg pipes up. \u201cHe told us earlier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor frowns at Korg and then takes the grocery bags out of Harry\u2019s hands and leads the small group back to the dilapidated cabin.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce they return, Harry falls into the familiar pattern of baking scones and frying up some bacon with eggs. He\u2019s been out of the Dursley house for more than three thousand years -- he spent less than eighteen years in that house -- and yet the habits have endured. He can\u2019t feel calm unless he makes a good breakfast. He wasn\u2019t lying, he finds the repetitive motion of scrambling the eggs, stirring in a single square of butter until the white melts down, browning at the edges and smelling of caramel and smoked meat, soothing in ways he cannot describe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs the house begins to smell of orange and bread from the scones and bacon and eggs, Harry feels something settle in his chest. He\u2019s a far way from anywhere he\u2019s ever been before. \n\nElsewhere. \n\nIt\u2019s an odd, sad world he\u2019s found himself living inside. And yet\u2026 he thinks Death perhaps was right. This is better than he felt two days ago, lying on a sand dune and praying to finally be granted eternal rest.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe thought of tomorrow doesn\u2019t make him want to tear his heart into nothingness.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor and Korg are sitting on a moth-eaten couch and playing some form of a primitive muggle video game (Harry\u2019s seen much better now the few times he\u2019s ventured into the muggle world -- but then again, it appears to still be the twenty-first century in this universe. They have time to catch up.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he finishes the breakfast, he calls out to the men on the couch and Korg ambles over but Thor yells, \u201cNoobmaster69, today I will vanquish you once and for all!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt seems the vanquishing was not to be, for not even a minute later, Thor throws off his headset with an ungodly scream and then stomps over to the cramped kitchen counter.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRough luck,\u201d Korg says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNoobmaster69 has another thing coming if he thinks I\u2019ll let him stay as belligerent as he has been. He needs to learn respect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry slides Thor some eggs, bacon, and a scone. Thor begins eating with a murmured, \u201cLooks good, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey silently eat, Korg smiling happily and Thor shoveling the food down as though it will suddenly disappear if he doesn\u2019t eat it fast enough. He finishes the plate in record time and then smashes it against the ground. \u201cAnother!\u201d He says. Harry gapes. Thor looks confused for a moment, then his eyes widen and he flushes, \u201cI apologize. I learned years ago from the Lady Jane that this is not how Midguardians express their enjoyment.\u201d He breathes. \u201cThank you, Harry, for the delightful food. Might I have some more?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry laughs. \u201cOf course. And I think we promised each other some stories.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nT\nhor nods and then looks down at the ruined dish. \u201cOh,\u201d he sighs, \u201cI only had three plates.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry looks at him, raises a brow, and then mutters, \u201cReparo.\u201d Immediately the plate knits itself back together and Harry wordlessly summons it to his hands.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKorg continues eating and says, \u201cCool trick.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor does not seem startled. Instead, he seems mesmerized, \u201cA \nsei\u00f0r. We are blessed, then, little magic breather. I would be honored to exchange histories with you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe three of them talk all day, over at least six cups of tea, Harry casting warming charms so that the drinks never go cold.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe and Thor only speak of the first few years of their lives. Thor angrily interjects after almost every year of his Hogwarts experience, commending Harry on his bravery and cursing every adult for their negligence. (Harry doesn\u2019t talk about the Dursleys. That\u2019s private.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe speaks of Ginny and her smile lines and how she looked when she waddled like a madwoman, eight months pregnant and more fearsome than a nesting Hungarian Horntail. He speaks of James\u2019 brilliant mind and how he and Hermione would have debates none of the rest of the family could follow. He speaks of Lily, how she was eight years old when she broke into the garden shed and went flying on her older brother\u2019s broomstick and how Ginny found out and didn\u2019t do anything but cast a cushioning charm on the grass, remembering her own stolen moments of flight. He speaks of Albus\u2019s quiet confidence, how his youngest son learned he didn\u2019t need to yell to command a room, how he wore power and kindness so thick it wrapped him up like a cloak.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe tries to say what it was to be a father and see in a country halfway across the world a eulogy in a translated paper -- a blurb to the life of the most beautiful boys and girl to have ever lived -- and to know that you missed their last moments and that they think they\u2019re going to meet you again, that they think you\u2019re waiting for them, and that you\u2019re not -- that you can\u2019t join them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd when Harry cannot go on any further,\u00a0 Korg speaks of his own story. The rock being manages to explain his revolution, imprisonment and escape quickly and in an even tone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Thor speaks against the setting sun, the sky shining through grime-streaked windows to color the blonde of his beard the colors of a dying flame, embers of red and purple bursting through the cold.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe God speaks of growing up in a world made of gold with a brother younger, smarter, and less beloved than him. He speaks of his arrogance, of his exploits, of being a prince and knowing he would one day be a king.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe speaks of wars fought in adolescence when ego outweighed pragmatism, of how he was cast out of his home by his own father, and told he would not be able to hold a weapon forged in a star until he was worthy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry curses Odin as often as Thor did Dumbeldore, both of them laughing over men with white beards using love as a weapon.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Thor speaks of Lady Jane, of their embraces and their separation. He speaks of his brother Loki and a battle and New York and a group of impossible people and an evil army and evil stones and something called Ulton and\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moon has risen. Korg sets off to go to his own little cabin. He\u2019s been sleeping over with Thor more often than not, but he does have his own place and he looks at Harry and Thor and says, \u201cYou two have more to discuss.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Thor holds out a hand and Harry takes it. \u201cWill you stay with me again tonight? You\u2019ve been lonely for a long time. I have as well. Allow me to keep you warm tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd Harry nods because it\u2019s true. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says, shivering.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey clean themselves up in a bathroom that is more dirt than tile and go into the small bedroom, stepping over crinkling wrappers and Thor pulls Harry under the covers, pressing a kiss to the smaller man\u2019s forehead.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe should talk more in the morning, but for now, I would just like to hold you, brave lion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry blushes down to his toes at the nickname. \u201cThen hold me,\u201d he says, \u201cKeep me warm.\u201d It should be awkward, to be held in the arms of a man he barely knows. But he understands tragedy, they've both shared so much of their stories, and really, Harry has nothing to lose.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe falls asleep wrapped in an embrace for the second time in three centuries. Tomorrow the sun will rise, golden and insistent, but for tonight he finds peace in darkness.\n\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t meant to get used to the feeling of waking up in a large bed, back pressed to the warm man behind him. He hadn\u2019t meant to get used to the feel of stubble pressed faintly into his neck, used to large hands wrapping around his waist and chest and pulling him back onto strong muscles. He hadn\u2019t meant to start to think of a small wooden cottage in a town defined by redefining itself and what it means to be living as home, but\u2026 he had. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIt took two weeks before he stopped pretending to Thor that he was going to leave and go somewhere else. Thor had been making comments, repeatedly, of how Harry need not be anywhere other than here, in New Asgard. Korg had started telling Harry first how much he was helping the God of Thunder seem so much healthier, and then, Korg began telling Harry how much he enjoyed his company.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBetween the mornings of tea that Harry brewed and Thor blearily drank, the afternoons Harry spent finally cleaning up the mess that Thor\u2019s home had become, and then the evenings the two of them spent together, either training for battles they might never fight or using spells (well Harry used them, Thor \u201cdirected\") to charm the house larger, warmer, more comfortable, Harry had found himself hoping for more than just waking up and going to sleep with the man who\u2019d taken him in. He thinks, sometimes, of what it might be like to be with the man in all senses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith every passing day, the ache Harry's lived with for four thousand years seems to be a bit easier to bear. He finds himself dreaming of tomorrows for the first time since his children died. He has plans for the sunrise, to make hot chocolate instead of tea and surprise Thor. (Thor drops the mug and demands, with a cheeky grin, \u201cAnother!\u201d Harry rolls his eyes and fixes the mug wand-less, it\u2019s become a kind of morning tradition.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds himself looking forward to Korg coming over and attempting to make banana bread in the oven Harry charmed into existence because Korg ate Harry\u2019s banana bread once and became determined to learn how to make it himself. (\u201cThis is the taste of friendship, Harry. I will learn!\u201d) So Korg comes over many late mornings and busies himself in the kitchen, making a mess of flour that Harry will clean up, and making jokes that cause Thor\u2019s laughter to boom. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThor and Harry speak to each other every night before sleep claims them. Sometimes their conversations are on the inconsequential and mundane: is silk better than Egyptian cotton? Chocolate or lemon? If you could have a pet panda, would you want one?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor speaks of his father, a complicated figure, and his mother, less so, and his brother \u2014 a daring trickster, too angry for his own good and yet deeply complicated at the end. Thor says, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if Loki himself knew how much of the way he behaved was an act, but when there was no room for anything other than honor, he claimed himself a prince of Asgard and my brother. And I \u2014 I wish I could grant that warrior's death with the praise it no doubt deserves, but I\u2019m angry, Harry. I\u2019m so angry that he\u2019s gone. And I miss him. Even though he killed so many people, I miss him. Does that \u2014 does that ever go away?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s spoken of Ginny and his beautiful children enough to know the answer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go away, not really. The thing about loss is you still feel its jagged edges no matter how much you grow. What happened will never be okay. But\u2026 time gives us the tools so that one day, we can be okay. That\u2019s the best we can hope for.\u201d\n\n\nThor wraps Harry up that night tight, like he is afraid of his traveler too slipping away, and in the morning looks down at the smaller man\u2019s green eyes like they hold all the treasure in the world and asks, voice low and deep, \u201cCan I kiss you, \u2018Just Harry?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Harry, tired and warm and cozy and well on his way to being helplessly enamored says, \u201cOnly if you get on with it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir first kiss is long and sweet, a greeting as much as it is a beginning and culmination, a soft sigh of coming home even as it ignites a fire that\u2019s been brewing from the moment Harry emerged from the ash and met Thor\u2019s blue eyes, the color of the frozen sea. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe second kiss is far more heated and leads to a third, and one thing leads to another, and then Harry grows used to baths against a muscled chest, the feel of large hands unbuttoning his shirt with single-minded care and the feel of faint stubble against his groin. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe people of New Asgard come to know Harry in small bits and pieces. He heals the knee of a boy who slipped on ice and meets the boy\u2019s parents. He talks a woman down from jumping off the cliff at the edge of town by reminding her that just as she is missing her daughter \u2014 and he understands, Merlin does he understand \u2014 her mother, heart still beating and smile lined creased \u2014 would miss her. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe meets the members of New Asgard sometimes with Thor, and sometimes with Korg, and most often alone. He is regarded by them as a kind of magic guardian. They call him a Sei\u00f0r but they also name him a Protector, sent to even the balance from beyond. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe does not know how to tell them that he is being saved by them far more than he is giving back. But he conjures fireworks for the children and brews potions for the heart-aches, and little by little, the diamond snow melts into a crisp spring, and as the first snow buttercup pokes up from the damp earth, Thor pulls him into his enormous side (Harry fits in that space just right) and whispers, \u201cI love you, Harry.\u201dAnd Harry, watching as the world of death gives way to new life, hearing the cries of a newborn child he helped deliver says, \u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s early morning and though the sun is streaming through the now clear windows, Thor is still deeply asleep. He\u2019s not a morning person, Harry\u2019s found, but that\u2019s perfect because normally Harry is content enough to either snuggle back down in bed with the God or get up early to make tea by the time Thor stumbles out into the kitchen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis morning, Harry wakes not because he is well-rested and at an end of his dreams, but because his wards have been tripped. Someone is trying to get into his home. They won\u2019t be able to enter, of course, as far as Harry can tell he is the only wizard in this entire world (something equal parts lonely and relieving \u2014 he\u2019s been helping out wizardkind for millennia and they\u2019re the sort that are easy and difficult to love),\u00a0 but it\u2019s still confusing and a bit concerning. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry, with some difficulty, successfully slides out of Thor\u2019s hold and pulls on a fluffy black robe. After a moment\u2019s consideration (and wow, the wards are informing him that the people attempting entry are getting aggressive) he slides on a pair of soft trousers. It seems bad form to meet potentially hostile individuals without anything covering his lower regions. (Not that Thor seems to mind, but then again, it would be hard to do what they do most nights if Harry or Thor wore their trousers to bed.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe then puts on his fuzzy yellow slippers (the ones that look like baby chicks) and softly pads out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him and putting up a silencing ward for good measure. He would hate to wake Thor for something as simple as dealing with a couple of wannabe villains. Unless Thanos is standing outside their home, Harry is fairly confident the people now attempting to knock down the door, honestly, will serve no issue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry swiftly walks through the newly expanded living room and kitchen, both decorated with warm tones of brown and gold detail and takes a deep breath before opening the door. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe quickly throws up a shield when he sees a beam of light coming toward him and it was fortunate that he did so. Outside the door, a man in a metal suit has his arms raised and is firing repulsers. There are several dangerous looking individuals behind the suited man and for a moment Harry is utterly confused before he thinks back to Thor\u2019s stories. Ah, he does know these people.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould you please stop firing on my house, Dr. Stark?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe man in the suit \u2026 Anthony, if Harry\u2019s remembered the first name right, lowers his gauntlet. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d He asks, voice sounding rather electronic from the suit. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am Harry,\u201d Harry says cheerfully, \u201cThor\u2019s told me all about you guys. He calls you his shield brothers and sister. Would you care to come in for some tea?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey exchange glasses before a redhead with a somewhat awful blonde dye job pushes through the group and says, \u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019s mimicking his accent, just slightly. Just enough that it should make him feel a bit at ease. It doesn\u2019t help much because he knows all about Natasha Romonaff, but he does appreciate the effort. He stands aside and motions the Avengers forward. \u201cWelcome, welcome,\u201d he says, \u201cIf you would kindly take off your shoes there\u2019s a rack to your left and slippers will appear in your size by your feet once you come into the house proper.\u201dThis information is met with some confusion, but Natasha enters first and dutifully removes her leather boots, and then discovers that indeed, a pair of blue slippers just her size have appeared \u2014 as if by magic \u2014 by her feet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe says nothing. The iron suit retracts and seems to stand guard as Anthony stark, dressed in a suit that does nothing to hide how thin he is, unhealthily, so, enters next. He says, \u201cYeah my shoes stay on, stranger-boy. You don\u2019t mess with perfection.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry smiles serenely. \u201cHave you walked outside in those shoes before?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnthony gives Harry a clearly practiced arrogant grin, \u201cI never wear the same pair twice. Made of money, and all that.\u201d\n\n\nHarry nods. \u201cWell alright then, off you pop.\u201d He takes the time to help James Rhodes remove his shoes because it seems like the brace is giving him some trouble -- he'll have to look into healing the man's legs later -- but then wanders back to the kitchen because the avengers are old enough to know how to take off their own shoes.\n\n\nClint, Bruce, and the Captain of America (Roger??) all come through and into the house with little difficulty and a good deal of frowns and then settle on Harry's deep couch. Clint, however, yells when red slippers appear next to his feet, \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnthony Stark seems to agree very deeply with the sentiment. \"A challenging puzzle. I wonder if he uses magnets and a hidden department... or maybe there's some kind of subspace and portal situation...\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nRhodes says, softly, \"You can't make sense of everything, Tones.\"\n\n\nThe man in question grins, \"But I damn well try.\"\n\n\nHarry, communicating with the wards while fixing some tea, tells the wards to close the front door and be nice to his guests, and then says, pouring a bit of extra milk into Thor\u2019s mug because that\u2019s how his man likes it, \u201cWell this is all magic, of course.\u201d\n\n\nHe does not blink this time even as a good number of lethal weapons are trained on his person.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint says, voice wary, \u201cLoki?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sighs. \u201cNo, man of Arrows. Although, Thor thought so too when he first saw me. Something about green eyes and black hair and magic equals Loki to you folks. I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnthony settles into the couch looking very angry and Harry slips a bit of nutrition potion into the man\u2019s cup of tea and sets out biscuits on a tray before floating all the food and beverages over to the coffee table and taking a seat on an armchair across from the Avengers. The couch they are all seated on has expanded to fit the six of them comfortably, although all of them look rather uncomfortable.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTea?\u201d Harry offers, indicating the floating saucers. \n\n\u00a0\n\nCaptain of America, clearly a young man raised with manners, says, \u201cOh, um, yes, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome of his friends choose to glare at him, but Natasha says, \u201cWithout milk, if you would,\u201d and Bruce says, \u201cTea sounds great.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry easily flicks his hand and the proper tea ends up with the proper person. Clint and Anthony categorically refuse which is really too bad, because Anthony would benefit from the nutrition help and Clint seems to be in deep mourning and tea always makes people feel better. James Rhodes seems to be not drinking his tea as an act of solidarity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnthony says, spreading his legs wide on the couch and looking entirely too comfortable for someone so on edge, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I only drink the highest quality coffee.\u201d He even sounds a little bit sad in a \"what-can-you-do?\" kind of way.\n\n\nNatasha smirks and mocks, \u201cInstant?\u201d\n\n\nStark levels her with a glare that would make Snape green with envy and Harry says, \u201cI can get you some coffee if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames Rhodes mutters, \"Doubtful.\"\n\n\n\u201cOh how unfortunate for me, Gandalf, I\u2019ve already had my morning cup,\u201d Stark says in a somewhat hostile yet condescending tone. Harry is suitably impressed with the power display and is content to drink his own tea and eat a selection of his biscuits.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe scene feels far more domestic than Harry is sure the Avengers are used to, the group of them sitting down in a homey living room and eating a light breakfast. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe silence is broken when Thor stumbles out into the hall, bare-chested and wearing only red plaid pajama bottoms, his eight abs on glorious, gleaming display. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry, love, why did you get out of bed?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Avengers look at Harry sharply as Thor comes round the bend and sets his eyes on their guests. \n\n\u00a0\n\nA beam breaks out on the man\u2019s face. \u201cFriends Anthony and Natasha and Clint and Bruce and Steve \u2014 how wonderful it is to see you all!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sweeps Harry up in a huge hug and spins him around. \u201cDid you want to surprise me with this gift of my friends?\u201d He asks, before settling back down on the armchair Harry had previously been occupying, the wizard tucked into his lap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s neck turns red as the Avengers watch him and Thor with uncharacteristic surprise. \u201cEm, no. They kind of just showed up?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA happy coincidence!\u201d Thor booms. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, no, point-break,\u201d Stark interjects, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not here for a social call.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor seems to droop. \u201cRight,\u201d he says in forced cheer, \u201cOf course not. That would be ridiculous, coming all this way just to see me.\u201d Only Natasha and Bruce (who is shockingly green in this light despite Harry having been warned) have the decency to look contrite.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry squeezes Thor\u2019s hand as if it to be saying, \u201cI\u2019m here for you, babe \u2014 winky face, eggplant \u2014 don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor squeezes back. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d Harry asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting energy readings here that are off the charts,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cTo the point we wondered if there was somehow another infinity stone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark leans forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not just wondering. There has to be. That\u2019s the only thing capable of readings like these.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes travel down to his left ring finger. The soul stone sits there, a reminder of a family line lost to madness and ambition. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEr. Yeah. So I might be from another dimension, and well, I\u2019ve got a soul stone?\u201d Harry tries. It\u2019s clearly a terrible explanation, but in his defense, Harry\u2019s been working very hard to keep Stark\u2019s teacup from tipping down the man\u2019s throat whenever he opens his mouth because it seems the teacup has developed its own opinions about Stark\u2019s obvious ill-health in the eight or so minutes it\u2019s been enchanted. (This is the problem, Harry thinks, with being as old as he is. He has an absolute knack for magic and tends to make things so much more powerful than they have any reason to be.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs it stands, Harry delivers his shocking revelation while attempting to uncharm the teacup, whereupon it snootily spins in the air and then transfigures the tea within its confines to coffee as if to remind Harry, \u201cI can help the poor man if you\u2019d just let me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Stark and Banner seem not to notice the dance with the teacup, everyone else certainly does, and it looks as if Captain of America: Steve is amused by the whole thing. The teacup breaks free of Harry\u2019s suggestion to leave Stark alone and begins to happily bop about the billionaire\u2019s head, attempting to get the man to drink.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally Stark begins to say, most likely about the bomb Harry\u2019s just dropped about possessing a soul stone, \u201cWhat the fuck\u2014\u201c but the teacup sees its opportunity and with no sense of decorum, tips itself gently into Stark\u2019s open mouth. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis eyes bug open but he reflexively swallows and happily, the teacup settles down on the table, turning around once in smug satisfaction.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha takes the opportunity to say, \u201cWho did you kill for the stone?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry cocks his head, considering. \u201cMyself, I think.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nCaptain of America: Steve seems utterly confused. \u201cBut then you would be dead, son.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly young enough for you to call son, son. And well I should be dead many times over but I\u2019ve never been and I\u2019m certainly not going to start now.\u201d His lightning scar, faded but present, is a reminder to the fact that he really should have died before he could talk, and yet. Harry is singularly excellent at doing the impossible.\n\n\nThor adds with his chin on Harry\u2019s shoulder, in an entirely gloating voice, \u201cHe\u2019s immortal.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nStark finishes swallowing the coffee. \u201cJust because that was good doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t bizarre. This is all firmly in the 'very bizarre' territory. What do you mean \u2018another dimension?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry says, \u201cSo Death told me that I\u2019d tried committing suicide one too many times and then the bastard was like, \u2018do you want to go elsewhere?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018elsewhere, what\u2019s that?\u2019 And then Death was like, \u2018have fun, little master,\u2019 and then I emerged here from the ash not realizing that it was a big deal to do that. You know, because of Mr. Purple faced-Snappy-Snappy.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThanos, you mean?\u201d Captain America: Steve asks. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry answers. \"Him.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint takes a sip of his tea as though under great strain. \u201cI fucking hate that guy but I also fucking hate magic,\u201d\u00a0 is what he says. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry snuggles back into Thor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to hate about both. But now that I have all of you here,\"\n\n\nStark says, \u201cNow that I've gotten all of us here,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nRhodes says, \"Are we really going to just ignore the part where he said, 'after I tried to commit suicide one too many times?'\"\n\u00a0\nNatasha lightly kicks the man and says, \"Yes. We'll come back to it.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry says, \u201cI'd rather not go back to that but sure. we can do that later. Now that Stark has assembled us all, after you finish interrogating me\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a conversation,\u201d comes Natasha\u2019s gentle tone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFine then after this conversation,\u201d Harry continues, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan to take down Thanos?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nCaptain of America: Steve looks at Thor with a raised brow. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t turn out to be a mass-murderer, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a keeper.\u201d\n\nHarry can feel Thor\u2019s smile against his neck. \u201cOn the contrary, friend Steve, he\u2019s a keeper either way.\u201d\n\nStark rubs his hands together on Harry\u2019s expanded couch and says, \u201cRight, well we\u2019re burning daylight so might as well go on and get to somewhere we can do some action. I\u2019ve got places to go, people to see, yada, yada, a pregnant wife, so let\u2019s blow this popsicle stand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry files this new information away in a folder of his mindscape. He can feel Thor\u2019s smile at the base of his neck and the god booms, \u201cMan of Iron, I extend my felicitations on this wondrous occasion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry, from where he is still pressed against Thor\u2019s chest allows himself a private smile from remembering the first time Ginny was pregnant. He remembers her little waddles and the way her face got red from exertion.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTry to get catch up on your sleep while you still can,\u201d Harry advises, \u201cinfants are murder on schedules. Also, skin-on-skin contact is important so that your baby will develop an attachment to you as the father.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy do you know that?\u201d Steve asks and turns to Clint, \u201cWhy does he know that?\u201d He returns his gaze to Harry. \u201cYou look barely fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shrugs, \u201cStopped aging at seventeen. Still had three children.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSharply, Romanov prompts, \u201cYou \n\nhad \n\nthree children?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint snorts. \u201cWhat, do wizard men carry the babies?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell some do, but my wife was the one who carried my kids. No, I just said 'had' because I\u2019m immortal.\u201d Harry says by way of explanation. Understanding dawns on all faces but Steve\u2019s. For the captain\u2019s benefit Harry adds, \u201cMy children were not.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere is a long moment of horrified silence.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor knows Harry tells enough at this time to take charge and he scoops Harry into his arms and asks, \u201cShall we go?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd thus the Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes and one over-enthusiastic teacup board the quinjet, an odd kind of plane, senseless chatter filling up the loss that seeks to choke them all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York is different than Harry remembers. New Asgard was a place he\u2019d never been before. The oddity of the town hadn\u2019t bothered him. It had been a welcome change even. But\u2026, New York is missing all the things Harry had grown to love about the city over the 4,000 years of his existence.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe remembers the first time he came to America decked out in designer sunglasses to hide his green eyes and somehow still ended up at MACUSA headquarters because he\u2019d been an idiot and just wanted to check out the Woolworth building.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d spent a few nights at the Blind Pig enjoying the feel of 1920s that had persisted until the late 2050s when Harry\u2019d first visited. Magic was everywhere in those days.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis New York does not have the Blind Pig. This New York has the Woolworth building but MACUSA is not within its confines. (Harry checked.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are no wizards anywhere in this strange odd world. He\u2019d known that already so he\u2019s not surprised. Still, being in a place he remembers he keeps looking over his shoulder expecting to see a man in brightly colored robes scurry past and the rest of New York turn a blind eye to the crazy man with a stick.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut instead he sees semi-familiar buildings covered in scorch marks and graffiti. Windows are boarded up all over. There are flowers littering the streets, some new and some dead, and most dying.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d asked Stark about all the petals and why they were out on the asphalt and the man answered, \u201cWhen there are no bodies to bury, roads become graves,\u201d and that was the end of that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s dark out and the sun is just barely beginning to peek up from its slumber. Harry is leaning against a crumbling wall as mists roll in the early morning and ripple around his slight frame. He casts a warming charm and relaxes into the steady breaths his lungs still make even in this world so far from where he comes from.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s been in New York for two weeks now and between talks with the Avengers on how to take down Thanos, odd verbal spars with Romanov that always leave him wrong-footed, and his relentless search for the ingredients he needs to heal Rhodes\u2019 legs, he\u2019s starting to get a little overwhelmed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Thor had said to him at 3am when he still couldn\u2019t sleep, \u201cGo outside and clear your head, my love. I think it will do you some good. I know you need to be alone sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd Harry had kissed Thor slow and sweet and said, \u201cI think you\u2019re right. I'll be outside for a litte while.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo here Harry stands, looking at an alien New York and breathing out white puffs into the winter air.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s calm for a long time and enjoying the little things this broken new york has to offer -- brighter stars because fewer buildings have their lights on, quieter streets because literally half the city is gone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s horror there too that settles. This New York is not his and even if he were from this world, it would still be \n\nWrong.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe sun is just barely cresting over cracked concrete when Harry sees a group of five women, all weather-worn and in different shapes, sizes, and colors, walking toward him. They are all wearing a tri-colored ribbon, silver, white and red, on their breasts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe youngest looks about twenty-five and the oldest is well into her seventies. They raise their hands in a sign of greeting. The oldest woman says as they approach, \u201cYou lost, hun?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d The women all exchange glances.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother speaks up. \u201cHey, do you need us to walk you somewhere? It\u2019s not safe for kids to be out alone at this hour.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry shakes his head once more. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you though.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks at them all with an analytical eye to determine the threat they may or may not pose. They seem concerned as opposed to threatening. The youngest of the group speaks up. \u201cDo you have anywhere to go, hun?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe says it gently and full of understanding. This is not the first time, Harry instinctively knows, that any of these women have seen a child on the streets with no one to care for them and nowhere to go. \n\nHalf the universe disappeared. How many kids were orphaned? Holy hell, how many?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is aware all at once that he\u2019s wearing an ill-fitting t-shirt with a hole and a pizza stain (thanks, Thor,) and even though he\u2019s cast a warming charm it is still technically freezing outside and he does not outwardly appear dressed for the cold. He\u2019s also aware that now that he\u2019s no longer bothering to drink an aging potion he looks fairly young.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRon used to make fun of Harry\u2019s svelte 172 cm after the war. He\u2019d say, \u201cMate, when are you gonna fill out? You look like one of those porcelain dolls Hermione\u2019s mum collects.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019d be obliged to say something along the lines of, \u201cWhen are you gonna go grey mate? Your hair looks like one of Petunia\u2019s carrots.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThen they\u2019d both grimace at the reminder of Harry\u2019s relatives and then Ron would say, \u201cBut you love my hair, don\u2019t you Harry?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Harry, never one to lie, would say, \u201cI love carrots too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nRon would say, \u201cSod off,\u201d and then they\u2019d go to a pub and meet Hermione and Draco and Neville and Luna after long days of work.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe aging potion helped Harry fill out a bit, but he always runs small. So he knows right now, 17 in appearance and shorter than average with big old green eyes, he could easily pass for any age between 14 and 25. He just has one of those faces.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDraped in oversized clothing though, he bets he\u2019s leaning toward the younger side. And he\u2019s just spent the last few minutes in silence and gone a bit teary-eyed thinking of his first friends and now he\u2019s sure that\u2019s not helping look like an adult.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...Yeah,\u201d Harry says at last, \u201cI\u2019ve got a roof over my head if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis words are clearly not a comfort to these odd-warrior women. \u201cHow old are you, sweetheart?\u201d The youngest asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMuch older than you, sweetheart, \n\nHarry doesn\u2019t say.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy body\u2019s 17.\u201d He answers if only to be believable and not lie. He tries to avoid lying these days. It helps him feel grounded.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hears one of them whisper to another, \u201cBullshit. I say 15 at the oldest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry asks, \u201cWho are you guys?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey blink. The oldest says, \u201cWe\u2019re the Archers of Artemis, hun. Been around for ten months. You know, the women who protect the children and other women after the rapture?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA woman hits the oldest and hisses, \u201cDon\u2019t call it that. The avengers call it the Snap.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe older woman rolls her eyes. \u201cLike anyone believes all that purple alien mumbo jumbo. Anyway, hun, we\u2019ve been around a long while and helping clean up the streets and keep as many people safe as we can. We patrol in groups of five like these and wear the ribbons. You must have seen us before, unless, did you hit your head by any chance? Can you tell me your name?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry absorbs all this information. \u201cI\u2019m Harry,\u201d he offers. The women seem very intent on getting him back home but he doesn\u2019t know how to tell him he has no idea what the address of the tower is and that he was just planning on apparating back.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJust as he\u2019s saying, \u201cI promise you that I am not being neglected, yes I know it\u2019s a thin shirt, no I don\u2019t need your coat though thank you, ma\u2019am --\u201d an incredibly fancy red Lamborghini rolls into the alley and shines on the assembled group with bright headlights.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOut of the car steps one Tony Stark with a full suit and sunglasses and a million-dollar smile.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLadies,\u201d he says, \u201cWe appreciate all you do. Real hero work. But Houdini here is one of mine.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe women seem absolutely floored to be in the presence of \n\nthe\n\n Tony Stark and are all looking at him in open-mouthed awe.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry gives a sheepish wave. \u201cHey, Stark. Sorry if I worried you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony gives Harry a dismissive hand wave. \u201cWorry? I don\u2019t do that. These Archers here do all the worrying for me and all the saving people stuff too. Remind me later to send Priscilla a thank you for facilitating the organization.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne of the women says, \u201c\n\nPriscilla? \n\nAs in Priscilla Chan?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony gives her a curt nod. \u201cThe one and the same.\u201d He moves forward far enough to loop his arm over Harry\u2019s shoulder and draw the boy toward the car. \u201cAnd you, mini-Merlin, are in so much trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMerlin was one of Slytherin\u2019s direct ancestors,\u201d Harry says. Tony\u2019s opened a door and is ushering Harry inside. Harry closes the door but rolls down his window so he can say goodbye to this group of the Archers of Artemis.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWere those words supposed to be English?\u201d Tony asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cEnglish as I am,\u201d Harry responds.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe archers look on as Tony himself gets into the luxury vehicle. The youngest woman says, to Harry haltingly, \u201cYou\u2019re not really 17, are you? Or in need of help?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry gives her an appraising look before he grins. \u201cNo, I\u2019m much older than that. Older than all of you, even.\u201d He pauses for a moment as he hears the engine starting up. \u201cAnd to let you in on a secret, I don\u2019t need the car to get back to where I\u2019m staying either.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTony seems to catch on and yells out, \u201cOh no you don\u2019t--\u201d but Harry\u2019s already thought of the refrigerator in the tower and apparates with a loud crack, leaving the women and Tony to stare at the empty leather passenger seat in disbelief.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony sighs and says, \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry appears in the middle of the Avenger\u2019s tower kitchen, only Natasha and Clint are awake. The two of them are sitting on one of Stark\u2019s obscenely expensive couches and speaking in hushed whispers. Clint holds a coffee mug in one hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA single drop of coffee spills as Clint turns to stare at the sudden appearance of Harry. He and Natasha seem otherwise unbothered.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStark\u2019s gonna get on your ass for doing that,\u201d Clint informs Harry, \u201che just got Friday to scan for your face and go find you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just ask Thor to find me?\u201d Harry asks, head quirked to one side.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha gives Harry an incredibly unimpressed look. \u201cAsk for help? Tony Stark does no such thing ever. He was once targeted by terrorists and refused to reach out to any of us.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nClint mutters a sentence that sounds shockingly like, \u201cAnd then we turned on him so maybe he was right to leave us out of his messes,\u201d but Harry can\u2019t be sure. Natasha\u2019s face is curiously blank. There\u2019s a story there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d he need me at,\u201d Harry checks the clock on an industrial microwave, \u201c6 am anyway?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFRIDAY\u2019s voice (Stark\u2019s AI -- much more impressively intelligent than any Harry\u2019s ever seen) pipes up, \u201cBoss had an idea he wanted to run by you. Something to do with time travel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nClint lays his coffee down on the armrest of the couch and spreads his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s Stark for you. Once he gets in one of his inventing moods, he\u2019s just go-go-go and can\u2019t stop until he's finished.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry says, \u201cHe reminds me of Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNatasha says, soft and prompting, \u201cWho\u2019s Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe only response Harry gives is, \u201cWho \n\nwas\n\n Hermione? What a question,\u201d and wanders off to go find his baby chick slippers. His feet are cold.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nStark is indeed a bit upset at Harry that afternoon for the \u201cdisappearing act of the fucking century,\u201d but Harry\u2019s not concerned because he has something that will stop even the genius from his tirade.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark is lecturing about how \"personal responsibility is not the kind of thing you get to forgo, magic or no, and whilst you are living under my roof after I've gone through all the trouble of keeping Pepper safe and away from all this nonsense and just as I was starting to breathe a little better with who I've lo--\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\nI\u2019ve finished it,\u201d Harry interrupts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark holds up a finger, breathes out, and says, \u201cI may be mellowing with age, but if you dare to interrupt me one more time, I swear to all that is holy in this world I will get TQP to pour boiling water on your head.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry blinks. \u201cTQP?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony says, \u201cOh, remember that teacup from when I first met you? She fits right in with Friday and Dum-E and U so she\u2019s part of the family now. I named her TQP which stands for Thirst-Quenching-Protector.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry nods as though this makes sense. TQP will be happy to be part of a family. She deserves that. \u201cGood,\u201d Harry says, \u201ctreat her well, Stark.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark looks affronted. \u201cI treat all my children well, adopted or no, don\u2019t I Fri?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFRIDAY\u2019s Irish voice responds, \u201cBetter than yourself, boss, but if I may say, that\u2019s not exactly a high bar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark grimaces and says to Harry, \u201cIt\u2019s just my burden in life that all my children develop sass. But what were you saying about having finished an elusive \u2018it?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry grins, \u201cI\u2019ve finished the potion to heal Rhodes\u2019 legs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cIt\u2019s a spinal injury. Kinda one and done damage. I'd have fixed it if I could.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell that's true but fortunately, I'm shit at science and fucking fabulous at magic. I\u2019ve finally found the last ingredient for \nspondylik\u00ed st\u00edli so I can fix the damage to Rhodes no problem. We just vanish his spine and he drinks the potion and boom! His spine regrows healthy as ever in four to six hours. I was thinking of giving it to him tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nClint says from the couch, \u201cYou just \n\nvanish \n\nthe \n\nspine?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry says, \u201cThat\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony looks at Harry like he is a very confusing and dangerous puzzle. \u201cThat sounds horrifying and I bet Rhodey will be all over it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodes \n\nis\n\n all over it. \u201cTones, it\u2019s a chance. What have I really got to lose?\u201d he\u2019s asking that night in a room with just him, Harry, Thor, and Tony.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour spine, for one,\u201d Tony mutters.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor wraps around Harry excited to witness Midguardian magic. \u201cMy love is the most accomplished magic user to ever walk in all the realms. James is in the best hands.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry blushes, \u201cI\u2019m not that good --\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFucking hell just say you are for my peace of mind,\u201d Tony interrupts.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRhodes rolls his eyes. \u201cJust give me the damn potion so I can wake up and give Wilson the surprise of his life.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry hands over a thin phial of crystalline blue liquid. Rhodes downs it like a shot and shudders at the feeling.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry says, brandishing his wand, \u201cI almost forgot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cForgot \n\nwhat?\n\n\u201d Stark says intently.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry finishes the spell quietly and Rhodes go limp against the pillows. \u201cTo vanish the spine. But that\u2019s done now. Be weird to have two spines.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRhodes seems to pale. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wake up tomorrow, am I? I can\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Harry soothes, \u201cyou\u2019ll be good as new in the morning. In the meantime,\u201d he hands over another phial, \u201cdreamless sleep will be a help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodes downs that one as well with Harry's help (he can't really feel his arms,) and is soon fast asleep. Tony gives Harry a deeply suspicious glare and says, \u201cDrugging people is wrong. If this doesn't work I will kill you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry ignores the threat and pushes another dose of dreamless sleep into Stark\u2019s hands. \u201cFor you, tonight,\u201d and leaves the room with his hand in Thor\u2019s to go back to their room and have some hot God sex.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nSam Wilson is running laps around Stark\u2019s indoor track in the gym early in the morning. He can often get a lap or three in before Steve joins him and proves which of the two of them has superpowers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn no time at all, he can practically feel steps thundering behind him and rolls his eyes because of course Steve would start waking up early just for this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut the breaths are too loud and the footfalls too heavy to be Captain America. He turns and there at his side, James Rhodes runs, body weight held by his two legs for the first time in years.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nJames\u2019 voice calls out breathless and joyful and triumphant all at once, \u201cOn your left.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNothing about the day the Snap happened was remarkable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay Parker was doing her shift at the emergency room. She had on her scrubs. Her hair was pulled up in a sensible bun. Her feet were in flat white shoes. She was wearing her compression socks. Those are important socks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter got them for her. They\u2019re not that expensive. It\u2019s something a high school boy can get his aunt for her birthday easily.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019d found them on her pillow when she\u2019d woken up on her birthday just a few weeks prior. She'd opened her eyes and pushed herself into a seated position. She looked up and saw Peter been grinning on her ceiling and she\u2019d collapsed back on her pillows startled.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c\n\nPeter!\u201d \n\nShe\u2019d yelled, \u201cAre you trying to give me a heart attack?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019d grinned at her, all sixteen years of him, brown curls and a boy-ish smile. \u201cA heart attack!\u201d He\u2019d said, dropping down from her ceiling gracefully, \u201cNot I! Never. I got you a present May. Happy Birthday!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was then that she noticed the socks on her pillow. \u201cWow Peter, these are great,\u201d she\u2019d said, because every parent loves whatever their child gives them, even if their child gives them mildly ugly tan socks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re compression socks,\u201d Peter supplied, \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be really good for nurses. I read that you guys stand on your feet all day, and it makes it more likely for you to develop varicose veins. The compression socks help with muscle soreness and protect you from gnarly blood issues. So I just thought -- I mean, I know they\u2019re only socks -- but they\u2019re \n\ngood \n\nsocks, you know? And you deserve good things, Aunt May. And it\u2019s your birthday. So\u2026 yeah. I got them for you. I\u2019ll just go make breakfast now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that adorable ramble, he\u2019d turned to go and walk out of her tiny bedroom, but May had gotten out of bed and turned him back around and grabbed him in a tight hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d She\u2019d said. Peter squeezed her back just as tightly. She knew that they both felt the absence of a third hug. It was her second birthday after Ben\u2019s death. She doesn\u2019t remember the first.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019d had breakfast together and Peter left to go to school and May went to Ben\u2019s grave and left him a stone. It was a great birthday.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay loved her compression socks so much, she\u2019d bought a whole set of them. Peter was right: they were good socks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo on the day the world ended, she was wearing Peter\u2019s pair.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere had been a big car crash and May was assisting a doctor who was performing surgery on a wealthy man\u2019s spine. He would be lucky to make it out alive, paralysis seemed unavoidable.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne moment she was handing a knife to the surgeon, and the next, the surgeon was gone. The patient was gone. Her hand met empty air.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then the screams started. She\u2019d run out of the operation room. Patients were staring up into empty spaces doctors had been. Doctors were staring at empty spaces patients had been. But most of the doctors were gone. May looked out and saw more nurses than physicians left from whatever had just happened.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay\u2019s eyes narrowed in on an eight-year-old girl bleeding from her chest. May had run her vitals minutes earlier -- she knew the girl had a punctured lung. The girl was lying on a table with the curtain half drawn around her. She was in the middle of surgery. Her doctor was gone.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay had a moment of thought: the emergency room nurses liked to joke that after ten years of watching the doctors do surgery, they could perform them just as well.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay thought, \u201cI\u2019ve been a nurse here for fifteen years. It\u2019s now or never.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo May had put on a new pair of gloves, gotten out her equipment, and set to work. She saved that girl\u2019s life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs she worked, nurses saw what she was doing, and they kept treating the emergency room patients. Questions could wait.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs soon as the eight-year-old girl was stable, May had to help another patient. People kept pouring in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCassidy, the newest nurse, ran over to May and said, \u201cIt\u2019s mayhem out there. Too many people need emergency services and the doctors -- we don\u2019t know where at least three-quarters of our doctors are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay couldn\u2019t look up from where she was cutting into a man\u2019s throat to help relieve the pressure of swelling and allow him to breathe. He would die if she didn\u2019t cut it perfectly. \u201cDo what we\u2019ve always done. Ignore the outside noise. Send in the ones who will die if they aren\u2019t treated \n\nnow\n\n and prioritize. That\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe nurses and doctors that remained worked and worked. Some of the people who brought the injured to them realized how understaffed they were and stuck around to help.\u00a0 May and the other nurses caught sleep in two-hour shifts and then jumped back into helping the sick and dying.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey learned in bits and pieces what happened. \n\nHalf of the world is gone.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay treated a grandma who latched on to her sleeve and bit out, \u201cIt\u2019s the rapture,\u201d before dying on a table that needed to be sanitized but there hadn\u2019t been \n\ntime.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf the world disappears. A truck driver named Stan is whistling the Disney theme song one moment and gone the next. His truck has no driver and it hits the foundation of 432 Park Avenue. Most of the building collapses.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA plane loses both of its pilots and three of its flight attendants. It crashes into the empire state building.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the first day, the death toll in New York City is estimated at no less than 5,500 people. That number only accounts for the people who were not Snapped.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s smoke outside the hospital. And rioting. And so many people are injured. In the first week after the Snap, the number of patients admitted to May\u2019s emergency room is more than six times the record for New-York Presbyterian ER. Their staff is half of what it had been before the Snap. They have only a quarter of their doctors left.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe death toll of the people who weren\u2019t Snapped, the ones whose bodies remain -- is staggering and climbs day by day.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay wears the same pair of compression socks for two weeks with the other nurses before medical school students, doctors, and nurses from other states and cities that were hit less hard than New York and Queens come to relieve the nurses from New-York Presbyterian.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay has to walk home because the subway isn\u2019t running and half of New York is on fire and no taxis are in the street.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer apartment is standing, mercifully, and she strips, showers and falls into bed and then asleep. She sleeps for 17 hours and wakes up as tired as she was when she went to sleep.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe drinks three glasses of water and turns on the news, sitting huddled on her couch. Peter isn\u2019t home. She calls him. She can\u2019t believe she hasn\u2019t called for two weeks. She\u2019s been the worst aunt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe calls Peter. And calls Peter.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, please God, if you\u2019re alive, please tell me. I don\u2019t care where you are or if you are in spandex right now, figure out some way to tell me you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, I know I should have called you but I was in the hospital and there are so many people who need help and I just didn\u2019t have the ability to think but I love you and I care about you and if you need \n\nanything, \n\nyou know I\u2019m always in your corner. I understand if you\u2019re angry, but please call me. Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, Peter -- are you, are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, answer the phone! I am your aunt!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, just tell me you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter, you don\u2019t have to be okay. Please just be alive.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter --\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery time, she gets the same cheery voicemail: \u201cHello awesome person! You\u2019ve reached Peter Parker. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re calling me when you could just text me. Unless you\u2019re May. May, if you\u2019re calling, you\u2019re the most-most-awesome person I know and I\u2019ll call you back when I\u2019m out of class. Anywho, if you\u2019re cool enough to have my number and not text me, you\u2019re cool enough to leave a message, which you should do after the beep. Thanks!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, it\u2019s May, please tell me anything, Peter. Anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter three days of calling Peter and watching the world burn on the news, May pulls her hair into a sensible bun, puts on her scrubs, and goes back to the hospital to save as many lives as she can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe gets used to five days shifts. She gets used to treating patients for suicide attempts. She gets used to traumatized children taking up space and huddling together for warmth. Her new normal is wrong. But she gets used to it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery time she goes back to her apartment, New York changes. The burns aren\u2019t fixed. Windows remain broken. Graffiti goes up and instead of charming wall art like, \u201cDumb. Anus. 2014,\u201d pictures of the lost are etched into the walls.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne month after the Snap, Peter\u2019s voicemail box is full.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay keeps calling.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen May isn\u2019t working or calling Peter, she sleeps. She eats enough, barely. Grocery stores have lines now and sometimes it just...isn\u2019t worth the energy. They feed her when she works in protein bars. Medically trained people are in short supply.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay is sleeping on her bed when her phone rings. She can\u2019t pick it up fast enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPETER? Oh my god, Peter, is that you? Is that --\u201d she breaks off, a sob catching in her throat.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c...May, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s Cassidy. The Avengers returned and they're \non the news. I think everyone, like literally all of the earth, is watching. I know you don\u2019t really watch the news, and I thought just that maybe, you\u2019d like to know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay closes her eyes. Not Peter. Cassidy. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll turn it on.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe hangs up and throws her phone across the room. It thwacks into the wall and falls down, unharmed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStupid five-star phone case,\u201d May mutters. She drags herself out of bed draped in a blanket and pads out into her living room. She turns on her TV.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Avengers are standing in Queens. Cameras are all around.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark is in his Ironman armor, speaking into a mic.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere was a fight,\u201d he\u2019s saying, \u201cAnd...Earth lost. A man named Thanos Snapped half of the universe away. We\u2019ll get everyone back. I promise you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne person yells, \u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother person screams, \u201cWHEN? WHEN?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd too many voices start to chorus, \u201cWhere\u2019s Spiderman? Where\u2019s Spiderman? Where\u2019s OUR hero?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark\u2019s faceplate retracts. His eye bags look like bruises. His goatee is grey. He looks broken and tired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpiderman\u2026\u201d he pauses. May feels herself gripping the blanket so hard her knuckles turn white. \u201cSpiderman didn\u2019t make it back. He -- he was Snapped too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0May turns off the TV. She stands. She\u2019s known. It\u2019s been two months. She \n\nknew. \n\nShe knows that she knew.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut\u2026 Peter\u2019s room is just as he left it. There\u2019s a half-finished lego on his desk. He has his Star wars posters up. He was sixteen, all boyish features and curly brown hair.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay trades out her scrubs for a pair of black pants and a black sweater. She walks to the graveyard with two rocks in her hand.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe leaves both at Ben\u2019s grave. She kneels down by the tombstone. For so long it was him and her and Peter. And then it was just her and Peter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, it\u2019s just her. May Parker. A woman carrying the name of her dead husband and nephew.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have a body, Ben,\u201d She whispers. \u201cHow messed up is it that I'm so grateful to have yours?\" She breaks off into ugly, hysterical wailing. She curls her fingers around Ben's tombstone and sobs into the stillness of February air. \"I don\u2019t even have his body.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMay is in scrubs by the next morning. Even if her eyes are red-rimmed, her hands are steady. She couldn\u2019t save Peter. She can save other children. She does.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nA woman named Kiana Fong starts a movement. Kiana was a nationally ranked archer in college.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the Snap happened, Kiana was in the delivery room of a hospital in San Francisco. Her baby\u2019s head had just come out. Her baby and the delivery room nurse were both Snapped.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere had been a woman next to Kiana who was also giving birth. That baby had just been delivered. When Kiana lost her baby, that other baby lost his mother.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana hadn\u2019t known what to do, but the baby started crying. She scooped him up and took him home. Her story sparked a movement of women: the Archers of Artemis. Women who lost their loved ones protected the loved ones of others.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPriscilla Chan and Melinda Gates both stepped into their husband\u2019s companies following the Snap and they became benefactors of the movement.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first time May sees the tri-colored pin on one of her patients, she ignores it. The second time, she asks the woman what it\u2019s for. The third time May sees the tri-colored pin, she sees it displayed prominently on her scrubs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe walks several little kids through riot territory to safety when her shift ends.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFour months after the Snap, May is walking home in her scrubs when an Audi pulls up next to her. Tony Stark gets out of the car and begins walking next to her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay says nothing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMay,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay doesn\u2019t reply.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was half of the world. It\u2019s tearing me apart too -- he was a good kid. The best maybe. He shouldn\u2019t have been one to go. But, it was half of the world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay stops walking and slams her hand into Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cHalf of the world?\u201d She questions. She points to the New York skyline and the fallen Empire State building. \u201cLook at this city and then look me in my eyes and tell me again that it was only half of the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony looks appropriately chastened but it isn\u2019t enough. May wants to see him broken. He broke her family. He broke the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo she continues, \u201cDoes every parent of a Snapped child get this talk from you, or am I just special?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony jumps on this. \u201cOf course you\u2019re special. You\u2019re -- were -- are -- Peter\u2019s aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe fought long and hard. He was\u2026 a credit to you. I could give you some money if you want it. Something to help make your life easier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m getting this because I\u2019m Peter\u2019s Aunt?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony nods.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay turns away from Tony\u2019s earnest and pleading eyes. There are so many other children who died. There are children that died because she didn't have the training to save them. As much as it feels like Peter is the only loss of this tragedy, he isn't. \u201cYou disgust me,\u201d She says at long last. \u201cAre the lives of superpowered people the only ones that matter to you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe walks away from Tony quickly. He does not follow. When she finds $30,000 in her bank account, she donates it all to the children\u2019s centers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe tries not to think about Peter. Instead, she puts her hair up in a sensible bun. She pulls on her scrubs. She wears flat white shoes and compression socks.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the first five months after the snap, May Parker saves no less than seven hundred and thirty one lives.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nEight months after the Snap, May walks into New-York Presbyterian to begin her shift and sees a teenage boy with crazy black hair and bright green eyes waving a stick and closing the wounds of a little girl with several lacerations on her back in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHullo there,\u201d the boy says in an English accent, \u201cI heard that this was where all the heroes go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay looks at him and then to where he\u2019s saved the girl. He's done the impossible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut half of the world disappearing was impossible too. And that happened, didn't it?\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe breathes in. She breathes out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the time she spends waiting, the strange teenage boy heals a man coughing up blood.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay\u2019s eyes narrow. Questions can wait. She\u2019ll do what she\u2019s always done. Prioritize the people who will die if they aren\u2019t treated \n\nnow.\n\n Save as many people as she can.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe've got a ten-year-old boy with hemophilia bleeding out just down the hall. Can you save him?\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe eyes of the teenager sharpen. \"I can try.\"\n\u00a0\nBy the end of the day, she and the boy have managed to heal all of the patients in the emergency room. The boy holds out his hand. \"My name is Harry Potter.\"\n\u00a0\nMay takes his hand. \"May Parker.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Good to meet you, May Parker. I'll probably be back tomorrow.\" And with a loud crack, the teen dissapears.\n\u00a0\nMay doesn't know why, but the day she meets Harry Potter is the day she realizes that the world is no longer ending.\nMay stares around at the huge Avengers tower interior. Harry is lounging on a cream-colored couch and several saucers of tea are zooming around the room accompanied by scones and spoonfuls of clotted cream. He\u2019s wearing an open silk robe embroidered with multicolored flowers and black satin pajamas. His feet are in baby yellow chick slippers.\n\u00a0\nThor is at the kitchen counter wearing a grey sweatshirt that does nothing to hide his muscles and matching sweatpants. His blonde hair is tied up in a short ponytail.\n\u00a0\nMay steps into the space with less trepidation than she had the first few times she\u2019d come here. She\u2019s been here more than six times now. Harry invites her after the work they do in the emergency room. Since Harry\u2019s started helping out, the emergency room deaths have decreased to zero. He helps with city clean-up efforts too. It\u2019s slow and it\u2019s sad, but the world is recovering. A lot of it has to do with the green-eyed boy on a cream-colored couch.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you know that Tony was worried that this floor would be too small for us?\u201d Harry motions to himself and Thor. \u201cAs if I would care. I was raised in a cupboard.\u201d\n\n\nMay blinks. \u201cWhat? What does that mean? Is that a joke?\u201d Her voice comes out sharp.\n\u00a0\nThor plucks a scone out of midair and takes a large bite. \u201cNo. Harry really was kept in a cupboard for the first eleven years of his life by his disgusting relatives.\u201d\n\n\nHarry snaps his fingers and all the teacups and scones and spoonfuls of clotted cream zoom into the kitchen and begin cleaning themselves up and putting themselves away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll he says is, \u201cFamilies are complicated.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s abuse, right?\u201d May asks. \u201cLike, raising your child in a cupboard is in no way shape nor form ever okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, yeah. I know that. I mean it\u2019s just been four thousand years. I guess I moved on? I don\u2019t know. My relatives didn\u2019t love me but I loved my kids enough to make up for it, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMay walks over and sits on the couch. She\u2019s learned a lot about Harry and this right here is part of why the two of them get on so well despite the fact that she\u2019s a mortal and he\u2019s something so clearly other. He tried to explain magic the second time he helped out in the emergency room and she just said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to know.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nBut they\u2019re both parents who\u2019ve lost their children. Few things bond people more than that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI brought over a bottle of trashy rose. Want to get wine drunk with me?\u201d May asks.\n\u00a0\nHarry says, \u201cHell yes!\u201d and Thor says, \u201cI\u2019ll go grab the Asgardian mead!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd if they all sing drinking songs off-key and if Thor says, \u201cLoki could sing better than all of us with his tongue cut off,\u201d and if Harry says, \u201cMerlin but James Sirius could hold his firewhisky,\u201d and May says, \u201cPeter never got old enough to have his first drink,\u201d well then, that\u2019s just what happens when people are grieving.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSometimes Harry can feel himself growing out of bullet wounds and though his skin is stretched and pink, the wounds heal and fade into scars. He wears those scars soul-deep and with pride.\n\n\n***\n\u201cOkay so let me get this straight, widow and Stormbreak will go to Asgard to get one stone, I\u2019ll head to the 1970s with Steve to grab the tesseract from 2012, and Harry will head to Vormir with Clint to grab the soul stone?\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhat a fucking plan.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone looks very serious around the conference table except for Harry who is still in satin pajamas and a silk robe. He looks very tired. Thor pokes him periodically to keep him awake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought Harry had a soul stone,\u201d Dr. Banner says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do, Harry says, \u201cBut it\u2019s a different kind than the one you guys are trying to get. I don't think it would work in the grape's snappy snappy gauntlet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Right,\u201d Clint says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one teeny, tiny problem,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI haven\u2019t invented time travel yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI am perfectly capable of sending each of you back in time. Back in 3032, I invented time-travel portkeys so all you will need to do is take one of these,\u201d and out of nowhere, Harry produces several stuffed animals pandas with huge eyes and tosses one to each Avenger. \u201cJust say, \u2018Hogwarts\u2019 to get to the time you want and then say, \u2018Gryffindor,\u2019 to get back. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m writing that down,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re choosing to trust this guy,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cI mean I get he healed my legs and all but we\u2019ve known him less than three months.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThor begins to puff up, \u201cI will vouch for my love unto my dying breath which will be a far bit further from your dying breath and if necessary I will pound respect into your puny bod--\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry puts his hand on Thor\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d he says to Rhodes. \u201cBut I want to help this world just as much as any of you. With all due respect, what do you have to lose by trusting me? It\u2019s not like there are any other big ideas rolling around.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could move on,\u201d Rhodes says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could not,\u201d Natasha says quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the week, Harry kisses Thor\u2019s lips, smacks the God\u2019s butt, and then takes Clint\u2019s hand to travel to the end of the universe. He holds the panda in his hands and says with determination, \u201cHogwarts.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n A soul for a soul.  That is the price given by the oddly red-faced dementor. Harry and Clint look toward one another. Clint is so young and so damaged and Harry thinks that this is someone he could grow to love as a brother. No, that's not enough. He breathes and decides he does\u00a0love Clint. He loves the man that keeps going even though his wife is gone. He loves the man that keeps fighting even though his children are gone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh hell no,\u201d Clint says. \u201cI might not have known you for long but I\u2019m not just letting you die for a universe that isn\u2019t even yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever universe I\u2019m in is the universe that\u2019s mine. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry breaks into a run and flings himself off the cliff. His wrist is caught in a bruising grip. He looks up. Clint\u2019s brow is furrowed and his face is red with exertion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pull you up,\u201d the man promises.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d rather if you wouldn\u2019t. They say one life is worth the entire world,\u201d Harry says, \u201cSo let me use my whole world to save the worlds of everyone else.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint cracks a lopsided smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else to die. I don\u2019t if I can keep surviving everyone\u2019s deaths. You know, you kinda look like how I imagine Cooper will look if he gets the chance to grow up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd he will,\u201d Harry says, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Let me go so Cooper can have a chance to become even more handsome than I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSelf-righteous bastard,\u201d Clint says. He begins pulling Harry to safety. Harry digs his legs into the face of the cliff to slow Clint down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to let me go,\u201d Harry repeats. \"Please.\" Clint bites his lips and then nods once, sharply. Harry\u2019s wrist slips out of Clint\u2019s grasp.\n\u00a0\nHe falls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe wind is cold as it wraps around his thin chest. It howls in his ear as he hurtles into the abyss. He could fly back toward the cliff if he wanted to. But this is meant to be a sacrifice. So he doesn\u2019t use any magic and allows himself to fall down and down and down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Harry Potter is eleven years old and staring into a mirror. He sees himself reflected back, with a family all around him. His mother, his father, his cousins, his grandparents, Thor, Frigga, Loki even, Odin. \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cEven after all this time, your family is still your deepest desire?\u201d The voice is not spoken but Harry still hears it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing wrong with being consistent.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs death a sacrifice if you want to join the dead yourself?\n\n\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s falling and falling and he can\u2019t see the cliff anymore. It\u2019s so cold.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThat sounds like Ginny. Harry slams into the ground but it doesn\u2019t hurt. Ginny kneels in front of him. She cups her hands on his face. \u201cWhat do you want, Harry?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA tear slips down his cheek. \u201cYou know I always wanted you, my pureblood princess. But you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I?\u201d She asks. \u201cI\u2019m somewhere, aren\u2019t I? Don\u2019t you want to join me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut no longer?\u201d She says. Her lips are wobbling. She\u2019s about to cry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI still have more years to live.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"But do you want them?\" She asks.\n\u00a0\n\"I --\"\n\u00a0\nHarry loses his voice and the sight of Ginny's face to the wind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt might be raining. Harry feels wetness seeping into his bones but he doesn\u2019t cast a warming charm. He\u2019s been falling for a lifetime.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe falls into a train seat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRon has dirt on his nose and he\u2019s saying, \u201cdo you really have the - the scar?\u201d eleven years old and all charming awkwardness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry pushes his hair back and shows the lightning scar. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, smiling.\n\u00a0\nBut Ron frowns. \u201cNot that one. The scar you got waiting to join us on the other side.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s smile fades. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t healed all the way yet,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen would your death be a sacrifice?\u201d Ron asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think --\u201d Harry starts to say, but then he\u2019s swept up and away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSunlight is filtering down and Harry is on the Quidditch pitch. He stares up at the blue sky and an older boy comes and sits down next to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright there, Potter?\u201d Cedric asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeen better,\u201d Harry says. Cedric looks so concerned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want, Harry?\u201d He asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d never died,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I did. So what do you want?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any other innocent children to die.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Cedric says, \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry crashes into a potion\u2019s case and Snape clasps Harry\u2019s robes in his hands and spits out, \u201cArrogant, Potter, just like your father!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Harry spits back, \u201cHow would you like it if I judged you by the character of your father, huh, Severus? Would that be fair?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing in this world is fair, Potter!\u201d Snape roars. \u201cYou of all people should know that. Giving up your life for a stone isn\u2019t fair, is it? The question is, do you want to die?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Snape sneers. He lets go of Harry\u2019s robes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry falls.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry sees himself, eleven years old and sitting in a cupboard. He opens the door with a quick alohomora and takes child-him into the kitchen. Petunia starts shouting, \u201cFreaks in the house, get out, get out, GET OUT!\u201d and little Harry flinches.\n\u00a0\nHarry says calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Aunt Petunia. I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut do you want to? Do you want to see me suffering in the next world?\u201d She asks. \u201cDo you want to get revenge for your childhood?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says, \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never wanted that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLittle Harry goes and joins Aunt Petunia. She takes his hand and there\u2019s a love tangible in the air. \u201cThen,\u201d little Harry asks in an innocent and sweet voice, \u201cDo you want her to love you in the next world? Do you want to love her back?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know I do,\u201d Harry says, \u201cBut this isn\u2019t about wanting. It\u2019s about giving.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut what are you giving up, Harry?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPetunia sniffs. \u201cWrong answer.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry falls. He can\u2019t even see the sky. He\u2019s been falling for so long. It\u2019s cold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe slams into a field of yarrow at sunrise. Albus Severus waves Harry over from where he sits underneath an old willow. He looks about five. Lily Luna is weaving a crown of flowers for James Sirius.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re all so young. Harry can\u2019t run over to his children fast enough.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy, look! Look! I did it! I made a flower crown.\u201d Lily Luna says. She beams.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful darling,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want one,\u201d Albus Severus says to his sister. \u201cCan\u2019t you make me one?\u201d He asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJames Sirius leans over to Harry and says, conspiratorially, \u201cThey\u2019re such children.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Harry agrees, tucking his son into his side. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want one too, Daddy?\u201d Lily Luna asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you?\u201d Albus Severus asks. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMore than anything,\u201d Harry says. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want, Dad?\u201d James Sirius asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to save people.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve always wanted that,\u201d Albus-Severus says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you really want?\u201d Lily-Luna asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry looks at his children and gathers them all into his chest reveling in the feel of them pressed against him. He misses them so much. He kisses the top of each of their heads.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want --\u201d he says, \u201cI want-- I want to see you all again. I want to see you all again. I would have died for all of you.\u201d He feels tears dripping down his face. \"I just want to see you.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Harry Potter is eleven years old and staring into a mirror. He sees himself reflected back, with a family all around him. His mother, his father, his cousins, his grandparents, Thor, Frigga, Loki even, Odin. His adult children stare at him.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nDeath\u2019s voice echoes in the recesses of Harry\u2019s mind. IT IS NOT YOUR TIME YET. NOT YET. NOT NEARLY YET.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would never want you to die for me, Dad,\u201d Lily-Luna says, holding a baby to her chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could never want you to die,\u201d his mother says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis entire family, his children, and his parents, his aunt, his cousin, and his grandparents and grandchildren, Hermione and Ron and all the generations of Weasleys and Potters, they all chorus, \u201cI want you to live for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n A soul for a soul. That\u2019s what this will cost. \n\n\u00a0\nVormir is cold and Harry can feel it in his bones. His eyes are wet with tears. He opens his eyes to a dark abyss and there\u2019s a stone pulsing in his hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe voice echoes all around. \u201cThe price was paid. A soul for a soul. A living soul for a living soul. We won't collect yours, Harry Potter. We\u2019ve seen quite enough of dying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry wipes his eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers into the silence. \u201cThank you for letting me see my family one more time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe silence remains but the air feels warmer somehow. Harry clasps a wand in his hand and with a loud crack, he joins Clint on the cliff.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Clint says in immense confusion. \u201cWhat happened? Did you not get the stone?\u201d\n\n\nHarry uncurls his palm and displays the stone. \u201cNo, I got it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen how are you -- well, alive?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry thinks back to a blonde-haired witch with misty eyes who saw too much and says, \u201cOh Clint, Everything dies. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d Harry takes a deep breath. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t live with the time we have.\"\n\u00a0\nHarry thinks about Thor and the way the God will smash plates into the ground when he enjoys something. He thinks of Korg and the rock-being's excellent banana bread. He thinks of a future filled with joy and with heartbreak and says, \"Sometimes living can feel like a sacrifice. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing.\"\n\u00a0\nClint looks supremely unimpressed. \"That explains absolutely nothing at all.\"\n\u00a0\nHarry can feel that he is growing past bullet wounds. His skin is stretched and pink but the wounds of loss are healing and fading into scars. He wears those scars soul-deep and with pride.\n\u00a0\nHarry smiles. \"It doesn't. Some things can't be explained.\"\n\u00a0\n\nThe grass is green and the air is cold. There are mountains Harry can see on the horizon. Thor is standing by his side. All the Avengers are standing in a line and looking toward ships that are congregating in the sky.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo recap,\u201d Harry says, \u201cNebula\u2019s neural link-activated when she was in 2014 with Rhodes on Morag and Thanos sent 2014 Nebula forward somehow, she managed to steal one of the stones, and now Thanos has it. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStark\u2019s voice comes out cold and grim even through the voice modulation, \u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo we have five of six infinity stones.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAye, beloved,\u201d Thor affirms.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the ship lands, hordes of humanoid aliens pour out of the hold. Great portals open in the sky and chariots Harry recognizes as Chitauri from documentaries he\u2019s seen begin streaming out into the open air.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA large purple man, Thanos, comes out with a manic expression and settles himself on a large stone. He seems very much at home, as though he is already king and allowing expendable soldiers to fight a battle he has won.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re outnumbered,\u201d Romanoff spits in her earpiece.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry grins. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be a fair fight.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry snakes his hand up to tangle in Thor\u2019s hair. He pulls Thor down and surges up to meet his lips. In the middle of what will become a battlefield, Harry slips his tongue inside Thor\u2019s mouth, gentle and insistent. Harry\u2019s fingers grip Thor\u2019s hair, pulling him closer. Thor groans and crushes Harry closer, closer, lifting Harry up until his toes scrape the ground. As if from far away, Harry hears a crash.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe pulls away from Thor, flushed and smiling. \u201cGuess that\u2019s my cue,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThor, very seriously, says, \u201cGo get them, Tiger.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe elder wand jumps into Harry\u2019s hand easily and is excited to get some action. With a quick practiced flick, Harry jumps into the sky and takes flight.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe chitauri are flying toward him, but Harry looks at them and is undaunted. He allows himself to observe their form and admire their metal figures. They have a power that is so decidedly lacking magic.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to have any sentience. The sky flashes red and green and gold as Harry stuns, immobilizes, and incinerates all the armed aliens that come his way.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA man with blue skin calls out from the ground beneath Harry, \u201cWhat manner of mortal are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry half-feral and thrumming with power calls back, \u201cNot a mortal, for one thing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chitauri are falling down around him like raindrops made of scrap metal.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0When Harry reaches the portal, he realizes he doesn\u2019t know a specific spell to close it. No matter. With his eyes wide open, he imagines that the portal is really nothing more than a fancy door. And he knows how to lock doors. \u201cColloportus,\u201d he says, imagining Flitwick talking at the front of the class when Harry was just eleven.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a great sounding thud, the portal folds in on itself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry lands on the ground and is stared at by one of Thanos\u2019 children. \u201cWhat, is there something on my face?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanos\u2019 child shakes itself out of a reverie and charges at Harry. \u201cP\netrificus Totalus\u201d Harry calls out lazily.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe alien\u2019s arms snap to its sides and its legs spring together. The whole body goes rigid. It sways for a moment and falls flat on its face, stiff as a board.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry turns on the battlefield to see the Avengers engaged in a battle with a large number of aliens, and holding their own just fine. Harry looks for the purple man and sees him dragging what looks like a gauntlet.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry apparates directly in front of the man.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d He asks. It looks like the grape man has managed to somehow collect the five stones the Avengers found from their places in time during the kerfuffle.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry is not expecting Thanos to place a large muscled hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cClose your eyes, child. This will be over soon.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry knocks Thanos\u2019 hand from his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanos gives him a patronizing smile that is clearly intended to be fatherly. \u201cHow old are you, then?\u201d He asks indulgently. \u201cFifteen, sixteen? You are working so hard for people who do not appreciate you. Close your eyes, look away, and I will take you to a place where your gift can be nurtured the way it deserves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Harry asks.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 years old, little one. I feel no need to fight you if you can put your little fangs aside. I am inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, so I\u2019m not gonna do that. Accio gauntlet.\u201d The gauntlet and the stones are pulled away from Thanos\u2019 hands and land in Harry\u2019s arms. He feels the power rustle through him like a warm blanket.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThanos stares and then his face crumples into an expression of barely contained rage. The anger ripples beneath a countenance of carefully manicured concern. \u201cYou cannot sustain the power. No mortal can. You will die if you put those on your \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry slips his right hand into the gauntlet. He feels\u2026 fine. Better than fine, actually. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks for looking out for me though. Also, I\u2019m about 4,000 years old so the whole paternal thing is a bit weird, kiddo. And, just putting it out there, if you wanted to deal with the fact that there are finite resources and too many people you coulda just wish for infinite resources. Like, does it make sense to get rid of half the universe? People can still make babies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanos' expression devolves and he snarls. \u201cDo not pretend to understand what is happening here.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI'm not pretending anything. I legitimitately don\u2019t understand you. Doesn\u2019t matter though.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry places his left hand on Thanos\u2019 shoulder. He needs to stand on his tiptoes to do it. He winks. \u201cClose your eyes, child. This will all be over soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t mean to \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Banner calls from somewhere. \u201cI can handle it, pass it here \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he answers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis dark hair ruffles in the breeze. He breathes out and \u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSnaps.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt feels like he has been electrified. It\u2019s like there are a million microscopic needles covering every inch of his body. There\u2019s a flicker of warmth slicing through the energy crackling around his frame. His magic reacts instantly, swallowing the warmth down and down, absorbing the tendrils of something sleepy and powerful.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry feels his magic tugging itself down with whatever warmth it swallowed. It\u2019s like it has been caged by something and it frees itself until there is only \u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nColor. Bright and all-encompassing. A kaleidoscope of light explodes and Harry sees vivid greens and eclectic blues, deep reds, and the way the sun would look if you never needed to shield your eyes. It doesn\u2019t hurt him but it burns.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe feels the warmth and his magic combine into a liquid fire that travels through his veins, spreading out through his heart to his lungs, his hands, his head, down his legs and back again, purifying anything mundane until only the magic remains. He feels like he is choking on the flames and they threaten to burst out of him, dazzling and destructive. The magic and warmth swirl around him as though he is in the eye of a hurricane.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeeling as though he is being cleaved in two, Harry pulls his magic back and tries to separate himself out from the powerful warmth.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGive in,\u201d \n\nsomething childish coos. \u201c\n\nStop fighting us. Give in.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGive in?\u201d Harry echoes. \u201cI never have. I won\u2019t start now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe have been here since the beginning. We will grant your every dream. Give in.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry realizes the stones are speaking as he is assaulted with images of Ron and Hermione back, alive, on this earth he\u2019s built with the Avengers. The stones say that with this snap, he can bring back his children and their children and the Wizards he\u2019s lost in this new reality. All he needs to do is give in, to let himself and his magic be swallowed whole.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut in reality, even he can\u2019t bring the dead back to life\u2026 Even with this power, the vision could never come true.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt does not do to dwell on dreams,\u201d Harry says. \u201cYou may have been here since the beginning, but I will be here until the \nend.\n\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThen make your wish, little master.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry\u2019s magic snaps back to his body. Immediately he smells charred earth and tastes the bitter dirt on his tongue. For a moment, Harry can feel everything around him. He feels the ground as it shakes with the force of explosions, he feels his lungs expand in time with every person\u2019s breath, the cold water of melted glaciers deep in the ground, every blade of grass that shakes in the wind.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt goes beyond even this.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe can feel the gravity that traps every living creature on this tiny planet. He feels the force at which the Earth is spinning on its axis. He feels the pull of the moon on the oceans. He can feel everything.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sees everything and it is not overwhelming. For one moment, he \nwatches\n the entirety of the universe.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the next, he becomes the \nuniverse.\u00a0\n\n\nTen months ago, the world ended. Harry is thrumming with energy and he\u2019s going to fix it, fix it, fix it but he needs to get it \n\nright. \n\nHe sees in a flash the world burning, the lives taken, the destruction that followed half the life in the universe being snuffed out of existence, easy as blowing out the candles before bed.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen half the life in all the universe disappeared, the people who were left behind suffered. Car crashes, plane crashes, babies falling to the floor as their parents flickered out of existence \u2013 all of these caused death and injury.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf Harry simply snaps his fingers together and ignores the finesse this will take to get \n\nright, \n\nhe will kill people by bringing them back. If he brings back the individuals who were in cars or planes or in any place that\u2019s been changed because of the snap, he\u2019s condemning them to death.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was an architect for about sixty years when he went muggle for a while back in 3412. A project of this scale will take planning and direction, but Harry knows it will be worth it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBreathe. Just, breathe.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sees every life he can impact, the glowing diamonds of life still present in the universe and the equally radiant diamonds of the taken lives glittering in the confines of space just beyond reality.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs though he is a puppeteer, he manipulates each tiny flicker of light to be in the exactly correct place it should be. On a planet filled with glowing flowers, Harry rebuilds the networks of roots that were lost in the snap.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn an alien planet with orange skies, Harry mends the tears in a mountain that were caused by a shipwreck and places parents in the rooms of their missing children.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn New York City, Harry rebuilds 432 Park Avenue. It\u2019s just as ugly as it was before the Snap. He fixes the broken empire state building. He fixes hospitals, apartment complexes, homes that were broken and boarded up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs an homage to where he comes from, Harry builds a castle in Scotland with a lake. On the Woolworth building, he engraves a small wand.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen Harry moves the people where he needs them to be.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s disorienting, sure, but children are taken from their schools and open their eyes in their homes. A single woman who lost her boyfriend during the snap finds herself on a mountain near her childhood home as the sun sets. Not a single person is left driving on the street.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSnap.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanos and his army return back to 2014, where they belong.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSnap.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana Fong blinks and finds herself sitting in her San Francisco apartment. She\u2019s holding Mason, the baby she took home back when she lost hers in the Snap, and he lost his mother.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a sound like a pop, or maybe like a very faint crackle.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the middle of her living room, Kiana stares at a woman with red hair holding a newborn girl with dark hair.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana looks down at the tenth-month-old boy on her lap with red curls and blue eyes just like this woman in her apartment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana stands with Mason in her arms and crosses to the woman.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWithout saying anything, both women exchange the babies. Kiana cradles the newborn to her chest.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat was his first word?\u201d The woman asks, holding Mason like he is the most precious treasure in the world.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana smiles at the memory. \u201cNom-nom. He really likes eating.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe woman smiles too. \u201cIs that so? You like eating, huh?\u201d She says to Mason.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMason nods solemnly. The little girl cradled against Kiana's chest yawns.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy name is Kiana,\u201d Kiana says.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Audrey,\u201d the woman responds. She looks so genuinely grateful and heartbroken. \u201cI will never be able to thank you enough for what you have done for us.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKiana thinks of Mason\u2019s first words and steps and the look on his face when she gave him banana for the first time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou could come over for dinner sometimes. I think that would just about do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Audrey says. \u201cYeah, I think I'd like that a lot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSnap.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nA truck driver named Stan finds himself in his fourty-year-old daughter\u2019s house, whistling the Disney theme song.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a crash from above and then his daughter is rushing down the stairs and throwing herself into his arms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDad. Oh my God, Dad, I missed you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJesus Joan, you\u2019re acting like I died or something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSnap.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nA single woman whose boyfriend was snapped meets her again on the mountain near her childhood home and he asks her to marry him. Through tears, she says yes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFamilies are reunited, dogs wag their tails so hard they create currents of wind as their owners appear once more, siblings hug each other and refuse to let go.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor one single day, every single person is exactly where they should be. Aging seniors with dementia have breakthrough lucidity and are able to tell whole families what needs to be said.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSnapped parents return and bundle their children up with so much affection, the children never forget the feeling of warmth and relief.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor one single day, every person is around someone or something that loves them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the day Harry snaps his fingers, for the first and last time in all of history, not even one person dies.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe day of the second snap becomes a national holiday. It is known as the \u201cDay of Miracles.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s one person left to return from the Snap. Harry\u2019s not sure what to do with this boy, Peter Parker. He sees May Parker\u2019s desperate face and hears Tony\u2019s heartbroken, \u201cI lost the kid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the end, he settles for a compromise.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter Parker appears right in front of Tony Stark.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Stark! You\u2019ll never guess what happened. One moment I was like, \u201cOw, that really hurts, I\u2019m disappearing that\u2019s so scary, and the next it was like I was all warm and tingly and it felt like someone really cared about me, and now I\u2019m here and then \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter cuts off as Tony pulls him in for a hug. \u201cOh. This is nice. Are we there now?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony laughs in a choked-up way into Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah, kid. We\u2019re there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Harry is satisfied with the state of the universe, he removes the gauntlet from his fingers. The stones arrange themselves on Harry\u2019s knuckles, three on each hand.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey get off,\u201d he demands.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe stones smugly do not move an inch. He can tell they\u2019ll stick around just like the hallows. Harry runs a hand through his hair and sighs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Avengers all congregate together on the grass and watch the sky above them as the clouds dissipate to reveal the blue horizon.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s Clint?\u201d Tony asks, with an arm around Peter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith his kids,\u201d Harry answers off-handedly. \u201cOne of them was snapped.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood place for him to be, then,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhat about Cap?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry sees a woman with red lipstick and a fearsome amount of fighting spirit. \u201cExactly where he should be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThor pulls Harry into his lap. \u201cAs you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry leans his head back against Thor\u2019s chest. \u201cExactly as I am.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably the most dangerous creature in the universe,\u201d Natasha says off-handedly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI definitely am,\u201d Harry says. \u201cExcept for Death, probably.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeath is real? Like a person?\u201d Peter squeaks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI mean, Death isn\u2019t really a person \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nRUDE.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut Death is sentient, at any rate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWoah.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlso, Peter could you do me a favor?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe boy looks at him, all sixteen years of him, brown curls and a boy-ish face with chubby cheeks. \u201cWhat kind of favor?\u201d He asks slowly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNothing bad, I promise.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay Parker is sleeping on her bed when her phone rings. She fumbles around to pick it up and lifts it to her ear.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCassidy, I\u2019m running a bit behind schedule but I\u2019ll be at the hospital soon so \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe voice that comes through the phone is decidedly male, young, and achingly familiar. \u201cI\u201dm not Cassidy, May. Though I\u2019m sure Cassidy is very cool! I\u2019m just your average, friendly, neighborhood \u2013\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPETER? Oh my god, Peter, is that you? Is that you? Please God, Peter that\u2019s you, right \u2013\u201d She breaks off, as she attempts to do anything other than sob.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, May. It\u2019s me. Your Peter.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter all the hours of trying to call Peter and wishing he were alive against all hope, May can\u2019t think of one single thing to say. She ends up telling Peter, \u201cI\u2019m wearing socks right now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter laughs and May wants to bottle the sound and lock it in a glass case so that she never forgets what it sounds like again. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m in my suit. No socks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSocks are good, Peter,\u201d May tells him. \u201cEspecially compression socks. Those are good socks.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAha! I knew it! I knew you\u2019d like them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI like everything you give me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d like these socks even if I didn\u2019t give them to you, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay feels incandescently happy as she and Peter talk about this and that. She\u2019s missed this.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI plead the fifth. So, when are you coming to Queens?\u201d She asks. \u201cI thought I got rid of your room but it\u2019s back somehow and I\u2019m really good at buying dinner from whole foods now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs soon as she asks the question, there\u2019s a loud crack and then a knock on her door. \u201cSorry Peter, someone\u2019s at the door, but don\u2019t hang up!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay is half-convinced this conversation is just happening in her head and Peter is still gone, gone, gone.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe opens her door meaning to be very rude to whoever\u2019s in the doorway but she sees Harry and his floppy black hair. \u201cExpress delivery,\u201d he says with jazz hands. He steps aside and May drops her phone.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nBehind him is Peter. Peter is wearing his spiderman suit. His brown eyes are sparkling and he\u2019s got one dimple showing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMay must fly because she swears she lifts off the ground as she runs toward her nephew and envelops him in a hug.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d She says. \u201cPeter. I missed you.\u201d The words aren\u2019t anywhere near big enough but they\u2019re the best she can do.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter clutches her back in a desperate and loving hold. \u201cMay,\u00a0I\u2019m home.\u201d\u00a0\n\nVictory is swift and comfortable. The day of miracles comes and passes, but the joy remains strong and vibrant in the fabric of every street, city, country, world across the universe. Monuments are set up to remember all the fallen who were killed as a result of the first snap. There are millions who died and will never return. There are billions of people who were lost and found.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry finds himself meeting a huge number of snapped Avengers. They are all lovely, traumatized, and generally bizarre. He feels like having a team this size is maybe unwieldy and feels oddly grateful he didn\u2019t have to deal with this sheer quantity of people whilst saving the universe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSettled watching a movie with the Avengers in the New York tower, Tony clears his throat. \u201cHarry, we\u2019re gonna have to give you a superhero name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve just saved the universe almost single-handedly, heh. Sorry, guess the stones needed both your hands. We\u2019ll have to talk about you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with calling me Harry Potter? That\u2019s always been my go-to superhero name.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha sits straight up from leaning against Bucky\u2019s side. \u201cAre you telling me that this whole time \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 wasn\u2019t even your real name? Did not see that coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it is. I\u2019ve just been called a hero since I was about 11 months old and I\u2019ve never felt the need to go around calling myself, \u201cmagic man,\u201d or something.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMagic man,\u201d Tony muses, \u201cNot bad, but we can do better.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI vote for \u2018Scary Motherfucker\u2019,\u201d Rocket Racoon suggests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGroot agrees with an, \u201cI am groot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThor says, \u201cClearly he should be called, \u2018Ravishing Potterson.\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, babe,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe healer?\u201d May suggests.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter whispers, \u201cit\u2019s so weird May\u2019s friends with Thor and Harry now. Like, wut?\u201d Louder he calls out, \u201cWhat about \u2018Spellcrafter?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSei\u00f0r?\u201d Thor says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGuys, I got it. What about \u2018The Master of Death?\u2019 It\u2019s what I am,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony shakes his head, \u201cNo one wants to be the fan of \u2018the Master of Death.\u2019 That\u2019s a terrible name for selling action figures to the masses.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"I think that's pretty cool, actually,\" Peter says. \"I would totally go nuts for a superhero named 'The Master of Death.'\"\n\u00a0\nTony says, \"Hush child. I am the only superhero you are allowed to 'go nuts for.'\"\n\u00a0\nNebula says. \u201cI agree with Tony. That cannot be your name. You have done more than mastered death. You have mastered power. You are immortal and the universe is your playground.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony claps his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019ll introduce you as, \u2018The Immortal.\u2019\u201d TQP bops over from the counter and spins around, as if to support Tony. He catches her out of the air and takes a sip of the coffee TQP has made just for him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry groans. \u201cJust call me Harry. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou could never be \u2018just Harry,\u2019\u201d Natasha says. \u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThor says, all blustery and frustrated, \u201cHe can always be \u2018Just Harry\u2019 with me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd really, that\u2019s all Harry needs. He climbs into Thor\u2019s lap and snogs the God senseless. Everyone else can suck it.\n\u00a0\nHarry attends the conference, is praised for saving the universe, and dubbed \u201cThe Immortal One.\u201d It\u2019s quite awful and Harry\u2019s certain he\u2019s the most famous he\u2019s ever been in all of his existence. Still, it\u2019s hard to hate the fame that much when he gets all this fan mail from children thanking him for returning their parents to them. One little boy writes that he\u2019d been living with an uncle that kept him in the attic and he\u2019s so glad to have his parents back who love him and give him a whole room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs May tells him, Harry's childhood was garbage. Even if he never had someone come and take him from his cupboard, the world tells him he saved so many children from theirs. It means so much to him, even after all this time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nA man with an eyepatch stares at Harry across a table in the Avengers tower. \u201cYou realize that I will devote a good amount of resources into determining a way to neutralize you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s wearing an oversized fluffy blue hoodie, jeans, and his chick slippers. Fury is wearing an all-black suit. Harry casually flexes one hand, revealing knuckles with infinity stones resting comfortably like rings.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do that,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is an insurance policy, you understand. I fully support your part in the Avengers initiative.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Harry says, \u201cI don\u2019t work for SHIELD. Or the U.S.A Or anyone, really. I\u2019m just chilling until the end of the universe.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Fury says. He\u2019s hiding it well, but it\u2019s clear Harry terrifies him. \u201cAlso, Immortal One, thank you. For what you did for me. For everyone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry winces at the name and then winks, \u201cNo problemo, kiddo.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\u00a0\nNew Asgard is filled with confetti, ribbons, and the blooms of flowers in spring. Tall men and women dance and get uproariously drunk as they celebrate the return of their children, mothers, and fathers. Harry can\u2019t help reflect that everything seems so different than it did a few months ago when he landed here from another universe. Still, he finds it hard to get all this gratitude from parents when he\u2019s still missing his children.\u00a0\n\nTheir first night back in their cabin, Harry\u2019s not sure what comes over him. He just starts crying blankly as he and Thor are curled up in bed. Thor kisses Harry\u2019s head and climbs out of bed. At first, Harry\u2019s not sure where Thor went until his boyfriend returns holding a mug of tea. He gives Harry a lopsided smile, \u201cWhen the day is too dark and too cold, you can always put the kettle on. Someone I love taught me that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry accepts the tea and takes a sip, folding his hands around the cup. \u201cIt helps. I just miss them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour children?\u201d Thor asks, sliding into bed and cuddling up behind Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry says.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSome days are harder than others.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Harry wakes up happy and ready to tell Thor what he\u2019s done.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThor, don\u2019t freak out, but I made Asgard again. The golden planet.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThor falls out of bed. \u201cWhat? Harry, what? How, What? When can we go?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna open the rainbow bridge today, and then Skurge can go back to gatekeeping.\u201d\n\n\nThor stands up and pulls Harry into his arms. \u201cI love you. I love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry succeeds in opening the rainbow bridge and the members of New Asgard all begin weeping as they return to their first and true home.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA woman tells Harry, \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done for our people will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course it won\u2019t,\u201d Thor says, \u201cYou\u2019re looking at my future husband and your future monarch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d the woman says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have found a better partner.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry and Thor will go down to Earth once a month for Avengers game night. They\u2019ll come down for the birth of Tony\u2019s daughter, and for Peter\u2019s graduation, and for drinks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut for that first afternoon, Harry explores every single corner of the Asgardian Palace. He\u2019s new to it even though he brought it back into existence. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s expecting as Thor shows him around but it\u2019s definitely not opening the door to a room and finding a man with black hair, green eyes, and a ridiculous lounging posture. He\u2019s tossing a ball up in the air and catching it with one hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Thor and Harry open the door, the man grins. \u201cYou will not  believe the year I\u2019ve had.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLoki,\u201d Thor says. He rushes over immediately and gathers Loki into a smothering hug. \u201cOh, brother, I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere, there, big guy,\u201d Loki says. He pats Thor\u2019s back awkwardly. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d He asks Harry.\n\u00a0\nHarry says, sarcastically, \u201cOh, just you from another time. Can\u2019t you tell from my black hair and green eyes? Of course, in this timeline, I\u2019m dating Thor.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLoki groans. \u201cFuck. I thought I was done with that TVA shit when I got zapped back here. Still, I get it. I mean at least we and Thor are adopted siblings right?\u201d Loki laughs nervously. \u201cI kissed another version of myself and I\u2019m like 99% convinced that\u2019s worse because she and I literally have the same biological parents.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Thor asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cErm,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2019m not actually you. I thought you would know that, of all people.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut your eyes, hair, and  magic.  You must be one of my variants.  \u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m just your average, ordinary, magical immortal named Harry. Harry Potter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***\n\n It started slowly, the steady disconnect between who he was and who he should have been. The man in the mirror became a stranger to him and everything for millennia seemed backward and wrong. Loss became his companion and grief his lover.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n Lifetimes ago, he married a woman with fiery red hair and aged to be just like her. He buried his best friends.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n In Elsewhere, the reconnect between who he was and who he is becoming starts slowly. The man in the mirror becomes a friend, a confidant, and finally someone he recognizes as himself. Harry settles into the reality of his existence with grace and befriends mortals that will pass on before he will. He makes friends with the more hardy Asgardians.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n He wears his scars soul-deep and with pride. There will be a time when everything ends and he will walk hand in hand with Death into the world beyond. \n\n\u00a0\nDeath says, into the echoing recesses of Harry\u2019s mind, BUT IT IS NOT YOUR TIME YET.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry agrees. \u201cNot yet. Not nearly yet.\u201d"
