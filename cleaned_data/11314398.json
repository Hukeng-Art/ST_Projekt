    "text": "\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"Mysterious thing, time. Powerful, and when meddled with, dangerous.\" \n\n\n- Albus Dumbledore\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron and Mrs Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very long time.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,\u2019 Mrs Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. \u2018You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while \u2026 think about what you\u2019re going to buy with your winnings!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t want that gold,\u2019 said Harry in an expressionless voice. \u2018You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn\u2019t have won it. It should\u2019ve been Cedric\u2019s.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t your fault, Harry,\u2019 Mrs Weasley whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I told him to take the Cup with me,\u2019 said Harry.\n\u00a0\nNow the burning feeling was in his throat, too. He wished Ron would look away.\n\u00a0\nMrs Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother\u2019s face, his father\u2019s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.\n\u00a0\nThere was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 she whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Your potion, Harry,\u2019 said Mrs Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.\n\u00a0\nHarry drank it in one. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him, he fell back onto his pillows, and thought no more.\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry opened his eyes he didn\u2019t immediately notice anything wrong. He saw the blurry top of his four poster bed and the red curtains blocking the light. It wasn\u2019t until he put his glasses on that he remembered he should be in bed in the hospital wing; with its white linen sheets and not a red comforter. He looked down at it and wondered if someone had moved him in the middle of the night.\n\u00a0\nNo. Madam Pomfrey would never allow him out of her sight so easily.\n\u00a0\nHarry got up and noticed none of his roommates were in their beds; Ron must have known he would not want anyone waking him. So he got dressed mechanically and dared not look in the mirror. When he got down he saw Ron and Hermione were actually waiting for him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Finally, mate. Breakfast has started already.\u2019 Ron said and Harry had to pause for a moment. Neither of them looked like anything was wrong; Ron was fidgeting to get to breakfast and Hermione was doing what looked last minute History of Magic revising.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hermione, why are you reading that? Exams ended yesterday.\u2019 Harry was astonished at how she could be studying at a time like this, like Voldemort hadn\u2019t just returned the night before and Cedric wasn\u2019t dead.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What are you talking about, Harry? Yesterday was Charms; today is the last one. Are you okay?\u2019 Hermione put down her notes and looked at Harry in concern; he was starting to frown.\n\u00a0\n\u2018She\u2019s right, mate. You look a little off. Nervous about the third task? We practiced loads; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 Ron smiled encouragingly at him but Harry could honestly not understand a word his friend had just said.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, maybe you should sit a bit. You look like you\u2019re about to fall over.\u2019 Hermione got up from her chair and came to stand close to Harry as if she thought she might have to catch him if he did fall over.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The third task is today?\u2019 That couldn\u2019t be right; the third task had been yesterday.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did someone throw a confundus on you mate? How could you forget it?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Maybe we should take him to the hospital wing.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No! I\u2019m fine. Just \u2013 today is still the 24th?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes, Harry.\u2019 Hermione said warily, still looking at him as though Harry might fall over.\u00a0 \u2018Are you sure \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes, Hermione, let\u2019s just \u2013 let\u2019s go to breakfast.\u2019 It was a testament on how really off he must look that Ron didn\u2019t immediately agree; he and Hermione just shared a long look before sighing and heading toward the portrait entrance. Before they left Harry caught a look of himself in one of the mirrors in the common room.\n\u00a0\nThe face looking back at him indeed seemed very confused and nervous but otherwise the same as always. No bruising or cuts anywhere. Of course Madam Pomfrey could have gotten rid of them in a second but Harry was beginning to wonder if he had got them at all. While he walked there was no pain on his leg and discretely he pulled his sleeve up and on his arm there was also no long cut from Wormtail.\n\u00a0\nWas it all just a terrible dream?\n\u00a0\nBreakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius. He stared at the folded parchment knowing it only bore a muddy paw print on it; he opened and was right. The paw didn\u2019t give him the assurance it had the first time he saw it. Wasn\u2019t this his first time seeing it?\n\u00a0\nSoon enough a screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. Harry counted the seconds before Hermione would spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.\n\u00a0\nSeven seconds.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 said Ron, staring at her. Harry also stared but he knew what was written on the paper. He knew.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it.\n\u00a0\nHe stared at the headline, and said, \u2018No way. Not today. That old cow.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u2018Rita Skeeter again?\u2019 said Harry, if only for the fact that he didn\u2019t know what else to do. Had no idea what the hell was happening.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Let me guess, she is saying that I\u2019m \u2018disturbed and dangerous\u2019, isn\u2019t she?\u2019 said Harry.\n\u00a0\nRon and Hermione gaped identically at him and it would have been very funny if Harry wasn\u2019t feeling very off kilter. But soon enough Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\n\u00a0\nMalfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet, too. Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry\u2019s reaction.\n\u00a0\nHarry gave none; he just stared vaguely at the paper Ron was still holding. His friend must have thought that meant Harry wanted to see it and very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over, and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath a banner headline:\n\u00a0\n\nHARRY POTTER \u2018DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother to read any of it; he already knew what it said. But he kept staring at it as if it would change. As if the date would change or the words; anything that didn\u2019t say he was going crazy.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Gone off me a bit, hasn\u2019t she?\u2019 said Harry once again faintly, folding up the paper and ignoring Malfoy make an idiot of himself back over the Slytherin table.\n\u00a0\nRon and Hermione kept talking about how it was possible that Skeeter could have known Harry\u2019s scar hurt in Divination but Harry paid no attention to them. He just kept on thinking how everything was just the same.\n\u00a0\nIt couldn\u2019t be right. He couldn\u2019t really have dreamt a whole day before it happened could he? Maybe he should start considering applying himself more in Divination because things were starting to get eerie when Harry looked up and saw Hermione rushing out of the Great Hall. To the library certainly.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oi!\u2019 Ron called after her. \u2018We\u2019ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,\u2019 he said, turning back to Harry, \u2018she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What\u2019re you going to do in Binns\u2019s class \u2013 read again?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 If he was right McGonagall would come up to him any moment now; he didn\u2019t know if he rather be wrong or not. \u2018Why did Hermione run off?\u2019 Harry remembered she had run off before after he said something about bugging; he said nothing this time though. Maybe something changed, maybe nothing changed. Maybe he was dreaming right now and he actually made no difference in the occurrences of the day.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I asked her about that insect thing you were talking about that Skeeter could be doing. Then she just did that Hermione thing she does; starting talking nothing that made sense and ran off to the library. Honestly, we have an exam; whatever it is must be bloody important.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018S\u2019pose so,\u2019 Harry said to Ron; but he didn\u2019t really know since Hermione never actually told them whatever she had figured it out. Just then Professor McGonagall came walking along the Gryffindor table towards him, just like he knew she would.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\u2019 she said.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, alright.\u2019 said Harry not even reacting and McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him like she expected more of an argument.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The champions\u2019 families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is a chance for you to greet them.\u2019 She looked at him expectantly and when Harry just nodded he could see a slight frown forming on her face.\n\u00a0\nShe moved away. Harry just looked after her.\n\u00a0\nRon seemed oddly uncomfortable, most likely thinking about the so called family Harry had. So he just cleared his throat and got up. \u2018Harry, I\u2019d better hurry, I\u2019m going to be late for Binns. See you later.\u2019 Exactly like he had said before.\n\u00a0\nHarry played with the remains of his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall and watched. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterwards. Harry stayed where he was. It was exactly the same. Any moment now Cedric would come out and tell him how they were waiting for him; Mrs. Weasley and Bill. But Harry wasn\u2019t supposed to know that.\n\u00a0\nHe almost hoped for no one to show up if only it would make him feel more normal but no luck. The door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, come on, they\u2019re waiting for you!\u2019 Harry felt his breath hitch hearing the voice. There Cedric was, his handsome face looking back at him and smiling at Harry. There Cedric was very much alive and Harry had to close his eyes at the onslaught of images of that face cold and pale on the ground of the graveyard. \u00a0 \n\u00a0\nSo, shaking himself of the images - memories? -, Harry got up walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.\n\u00a0\nCedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his father\u2019s hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur\u2019s little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her mother\u2019s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back. Then he saw Mrs Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him just like they had the day before.\n\u00a0\nToday.\n\u00a0\nHarry had no idea.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Surprise!\u2019 Mrs Weasley said excitedly, as Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile back even with the way his mind was spinning. \u2018Thought we\u2019d come and watch you, Harry!\u2019 She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You all right?\u2019 said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. \u2018Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn\u2019t get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018This is really nice of you,\u2019 Harry muttered to Mrs Weasley.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s great being back here,\u2019 said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady\u2019s friend, winked at him from her frame). \u2018Haven\u2019t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.\n\u00a0\n\u2018And the Fat Lady?\u2019 said Bill.\n\u00a0\n\u2018She was here in my time,\u2019 said Mrs Weasley. \u2018She gave me such a telling-off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?\u2019 said Bill, surveying Mrs Weasley with amazement.\n\u00a0\nMrs Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Your father and I had been for a night-time stroll,\u2019 she said. \u2018He got caught by Apollyon Pringle \u2013 he was the caretaker in those days \u2013 your father\u2019s still got the marks.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?\u2019 said Bill.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, OK,\u2019 said Harry, and he was glad he hadn\u2019t actually eaten much at breakfast because he felt like he would be sick.\n\u00a0\nHe had no way of knowing that story but he did. He had heard the exact same thing before. And any moment now they would pass the Diggorys and Cedric\u2019s father would call him out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u2018There you are, are you?\u2019 And there it was. Amos Diggory looking Harry up and down. \u2018Bet you\u2019re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric\u2019s caught you up on points, are you?\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry said nothing, just stared.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ignore him,\u2019 said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \u2018He\u2019s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter\u2019s article about the Triwizard Tournament \u2013 you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Didn\u2019t bother to correct her, though, did he?\u2019 said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he made to walk out of the door with Mrs Weasley and Bill. \u2018Still \u2026 you\u2019ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\u2019 Mrs Weasley said angrily. \u2018I would have thought you\u2019d know that, working at the Ministry!\u2019\n\u00a0\nMr Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.\n\u00a0\nHarry tried very hard to enjoy the walk over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Mrs Weasley kept talking about Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg. But every now and then she would just throw a very concerned look at Harry, probably noticing his mind was elsewhere and assuming it was about the tournament.\n\u00a0\n\u2018How\u2019s Percy?\u2019 Harry asked, as they walked around the greenhouses if only to have something to talk about.\n\u00a0\nThey talked about how the Ministry was hushing up Mr. Crouch disappearance and Harry heard nothing. He was thinking about another particular Crouch and how, if he was not going crazy, there was an insane murderer in the Castle.\n\u00a0\nThey returned to the castle for lunch.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Mum \u2013 Bill!\u2019 said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table. \u2018What\u2019re you doing here?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Come to watch Harry in the last task!\u2019 said Mrs Weasley brightly. \u2018I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh \u2026 OK,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Couldn\u2019t remember all the goblin rebels\u2019 names, so I invented a few. It\u2019s all right,\u2019 he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs Weasley looked stern, \u2018they\u2019re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean, it wasn\u2019t hard.\u2019\n\u00a0\nFred, George and Ginny came to sit next to them, too, and Harry almost relaxed completely with how it felt they were back at The Burrow; he even tried hard to ignore how he had to explain once again to Mrs. Weasley how Hermione was in no way his girlfriend and how the older woman became so much warmer to his friend later.\n\u00a0\nHarry, Bill and Mrs Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Everything was again the same and once the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes\u2019 time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch pitch for the third and last task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr Bagman down to the stadium now.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the Great Hall, with Cedric, Fleur and Krum.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Feeling all right, Harry?\u2019 Bagman asked, as they went down the stone steps into the grounds. \u2018Confident?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019 said Harry. It was a complete lie; he was nervous, he kept expecting something to change. Anything. He hoped once he was inside the maze it would.\n\u00a0\nThere was no way he could know exactly what was in the maze.\n\u00a0\nThey walked onto the Quidditch pitch, which was now completely unrecognisable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them; the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.\n\u00a0\nFive minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin waistcoat.\n\u00a0\n\u2018We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall to the champions. \u2018If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe champions nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Off you go, then!\u2019 said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Good luck, Harry,\u2019 Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered \u2018Sonorus\u2019, and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, on eighty-five points each \u2013 Mr Cedric Diggory and Mr Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\u2019 The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \u2018In second place, on eighty points \u2013 Mr Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\u2019 More applause. \u2018And in third place \u2013 Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018So \u2026 on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\u2019 said Bagman. \u2018Three \u2013 two \u2013 one \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwards into the maze.\n\u00a0\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick, or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt his trepidation increase, so far it was all the same still. He pulled out his wand, muttered \u2018Lumos\u2019, and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.\n\u00a0\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.\n\u00a0\n\u2018See you,\u2019 Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right. For a moment he almost changed his path and went right but he had to know.\n\u00a0\nTo know if it was the same.\n\u00a0\nIt was.\n\u00a0\nHarry walked and walked and nothing came. He didn\u2019t use the \u2018point me\u2019 spell this time. He knew where he was going and just kept going. And there was nothing beside the hedges of the maze growing darker and darker and that feeling of being watched upon him.\n\u00a0\nFinally he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, and its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side like Harry already knew he would. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robes was smoking.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hagrid\u2019s Blast-Ended Skrewts!\u2019 he hissed. \u2018They\u2019re enormous \u2013 I only just got away!\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe shook his head, and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the Skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw \u2013\n\u00a0\nA Dementor was gliding towards him. But it wasn\u2019t a Dementor, Harry knew better this time and immediately cast a Riddikulus at it and making it explode in a wisp of smoke.\n\u00a0\nHe almost cast his patronus again anyway; if only he could have the reassuring presence of his stag near. He carried on.\n\u00a0\nLeft \u2026 right \u2026 left again \u2026 right turn, and saw the odd golden mist floating ahead of him.\n\u00a0\nHarry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand\u2019s beam at it. He still hesitated, because any moment now a scream would shatter the silence.\n\u00a0\nAnd there it was and the silence afterword once again. Krum attacked Fleur most likely. Because he was under an Imperius that a lunatic Death Eater cast on him.\n\u00a0\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to do but he did know what came next. He kept going.\n\u00a0\nThe world turned upside-down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. Because it didn\u2019t matter if he had done this before; to have the world turn upside down was always going to be upsetting.\n\u00a0\nBut then he closed his eyes again and just took a step as far as he could and the world righted itself. Harry fell forwards onto his knees on the wonderfully solid ground. He stayed there for a moment before getting up again and putting distance between him and the golden mist.\n\u00a0\nHe continued to meet nothing and when he came upon the path that he knew would bring him to the Blast-Ended Skrewt he briefly considering taking another one.\n\u00a0\nBut he didn\u2019t want to risk missing something. There was something important happening and Harry could not back down from it.\n\u00a0\nSo he rounded another corner, and found himself facing a Blast-Ended Skrewt. Cedric was right \u2013 it\u00a0was\u00a0enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armour glinted in the light from Harry\u2019s wand, which he pointed at it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Impedimenta!\u2019\u00a0Harry yelled immediately since he already knew stupefy did not work against it. The spell hit the Skrewt\u2019s armour again and ricocheted off; Harry tried again.\u00a0\u2018IMPEDIMENTA!\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe Skrewt was inches from him when it froze \u2013 he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction \u2013 soon enough Cedric would run into Krum and Harry really didn\u2019t feel that was something that had to repeat itself.\n\u00a0\nHe took a left path, and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another: forcing himself to stop and cursing because now was not the time to forget the path, so he performed the Four-Point Spell, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him north-west.\n\u00a0\nHe had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 yelled Cedric\u2019s voice. \u2018What the hell d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd then Harry heard Krum\u2019s voice.\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Crucio!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\nThe air was suddenly full of Cedric\u2019s yells. Felling sick, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find the way into Cedric\u2019s. When none appeared, he tried the Reductor curse knowing it wasn\u2019t very effective but it was all he had. It burnt a small hole in the hedge, through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes and, looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.\n\u00a0\nHarry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up. Krum turned and began to run.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Stupefy!\u2019\u00a0Harry yelled.\n\u00a0\nThe spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forwards and lay motionless, face down in the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching, and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric\u2019s arm.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 panted Cedric. \u2018Yeah \u2026 I don\u2019t believe it \u2026 he crept up behind me \u2026 I heard him, I turned round, and he had his wand on me \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum and the weight on Harry stomach just got heavier. He could have stopped this.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?\u2019 Cedric asked. \u00a0\u2018You don\u2019t think Krum got her, too?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Harry slowly. But he did.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Should we leave him here?\u2019 Cedric muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone\u2019ll come and collect him \u2026 otherwise he\u2019ll probably be eaten by a Skrewt.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018He\u2019d deserve it,\u2019 Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.\n\u00a0\nHarry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them. Then Cedric said, \u2018Well \u2026 I s\u2019pose we\u2019d better go on \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Oh \u2026 yeah \u2026 right \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd once more Harry felt odd. He and Cedric worked well together, he knew it because of the spider they fought together; would have to fight again soon probably. But then the fact that they were opponents came back to them both. They proceeded up the dark path without speaking, and then Harry turned left and Cedric right. Cedric\u2019s footsteps soon died away.\n\u00a0\nHarry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction once again. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Krum. The older boy seemed to play fair and what he did, what he was forced to do, was so incredibly wrong that Harry couldn\u2019t help feeling even angrier. It was something that could ruin Krums career; his whole life.\n\u00a0\nHe shook his head and continued on. Soon he was on the long straight path he knew had a wonderful being on the end.\n\u00a0\nIt was the sphinx. It had the body of an overlarge lion; great clawed paws, and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached.\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry was close enough she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice. \u2018You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I have to answer a riddle, right?\u2019 said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, continuing to pace and looking pleased that he knew as much. \u2018Answer on your first guess \u2013 I let you pass. Answer wrongly \u2013 I attack. Remain silent \u2013 I will let you walk away from me, unscathed.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018OK,\u2019 he said. \u2018Can I hear the riddle?\u2019 He didn\u2019t have to, he knew the answer already. But it would probably look suspicious and he didn\u2019t dare to risk that she changed it.\n\u00a0\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very centre of the path, and recited:\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018First think of the person who lives in disguise,\n\n\nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\n\n\nNext, tell me what\u2019s always the last thing to mend,\n\n\nThe middle of middle and end of the end?\n\n\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard\n\n\nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.\n\n\nNow string them together, and answer me this,\n\n\nWhich creature would you be unwilling to kiss?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\nHarry just stared at her. It was the exact same riddle.\n\u00a0\nHarry just kept on thinking on what to do. The sphinx must have thought he was just thinking on the riddle since she just stared patiently back at him.\n\u00a0\nIf he answered immediately would she suspect something and attack him anyway? That didn\u2019t seem fair but he couldn\u2019t risk it either. So he asked all the things he asked the first time again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018A creature I wouldn\u2019t want to kiss \u2026\u00a0a spider!\u2019 He finally answered, pretending it was a surprise.\n\u00a0\nThe sphinx smiled at him. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Thanks!\u2019 said Harry, because all in all, the sphinx was rather gracious to him, and he dashed forwards.\n\u00a0\nHe knew he was close now so he kept forward until he saw it.\n\u00a0\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Harry had just broken into a run, when a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.\n\u00a0\nCedric was sprinting as fast as he could towards the Cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, but he also knew that near them was an enormous spider. And soon enough he saw it move.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Cedric!\u2019 Harry bellowed. \u2018On your left!\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but, in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric\u2019s wand fly out of his hand, as a gigantic spider stepped into the path, and began to bear down upon Cedric.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Stupefy!\u2019\u00a0Harry yelled again; the spell hit the spider\u2019s gigantic, hairy black body but, for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Stupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\nAnd it was no use \u2013 the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it \u2013 Harry knew it was no use but there was nothing else he could do without Cedric\u2019s help so he just kept going until the spider lifted him again.\n\u00a0\nThis time he went immediately for the Disarming spell and rolling so he wouldn\u2019t fall on his leg again, he managed to point his wand at its underbelly and shout Stupefy just at the same moment Cedric did.\n\u00a0\nThe two spells combined did what one alone had not \u2013 the spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry!\u2019 he heard Cedric shouting. \u2018You all right? Did it fall on you?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 Harry called back, panting. He was glad his leg was fine this time though, so he got up leant against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around.\n\u00a0\nCedric was standing a foot from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him.\n\u00a0\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything. He couldn\u2019t. If Cedric touched that cup he could die. Most likely would die.\n\u00a0\nBut Cedric once again didn\u2019t move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the Cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself.\n\u00a0\nCedric took a deep breath and Harry knew what would come out of his mouth. \u2018You take it. You should win. That\u2019s twice you\u2019ve saved my neck in here.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to work,\u2019 Harry said. He felt lost. He could never just agree to that and at the same time he feared so much that if Cedric touched that cup he would have the same end as before. But Cedric had beaten him to it and he wanted it so much. \u2018The one who reaches the Cup first gets the points. That\u2019s you. You actually volunteered for this, you deserve it.\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the Cup, shaking his head.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said.\n\u00a0\nHarry stayed silent because hell if Cedric wasn\u2019t making this harder than it had to be. If Harry was anyone else he could just take it. Take the cup and face Voldemort all on his own and no one had to die.\n\u00a0\nBut there was still a part of Harry that doubted this was all real. Maybe he had dreamt it. Maybe he was dreaming now.\n\u00a0\nSo he couldn\u2019t let Cedric miss his chance and he knew the other boy was too fair to have it any other way. So once again he suggested it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Both of us,\u2019 Harry said.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018We\u2019ll take it at the same time. It\u2019s still a Hogwarts victory. We\u2019ll tie for it.\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms. \u2018You \u2013 you sure?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Yeah \u2026 we\u2019ve helped each other out, haven\u2019t we? We both got here. Let\u2019s just take it together.\u2019\n\u00a0\nFor a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn\u2019t believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You\u2019re on,\u2019 he said. \u2018Come on.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe waited for Harry to start walking and walked together with him, shooting him looks together with that grin like he still couldn\u2019t believe Harry was doing this. When they had reached it, they both held out a hand over one of the Cup\u2019s gleaming handles.\n\u00a0\n\u2018On three, right?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018One \u2013 two \u2013 three \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\n\u00a0\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onwards, in a howl of wind and swirling colour, Cedric at his side.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry felt his feet slam into the ground; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head and blanched.\n\u00a0\nThey were in the graveyard.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Cedric, get the cup again.\u2019 he said.\n\u00a0\nCedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and just looked around. Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did anyone tell\u00a0you\u00a0the Cup was a Portkey?\u2019 he asked.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard panicked. They had to get out of there. But than his scar exploded with pain and he feel to his knees again.\n\u00a0\nFrom far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say,\u00a0\u2018Kill the spare.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo. No\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nA swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night:\u00a0\u2018Avada Kedavra!\u2019\n\u00a0\nA blast of green light blazed through Harry\u2019s eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; but he couldn\u2019t look. Couldn\u2019t look because he knew.\n\u00a0\nCedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead and it was Harry\u2019s fault.\n\u00a0\nAgain.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEverything was the same.\n\u00a0\nThe graveyard. The potion. The Death Eaters.\n\u00a0\n\nPriori Incantatem.\n\n\u00a0\nHis parents. Cedric.\n\u00a0\n\nTake my body back to my parents. \n\n\u00a0\nAll the same.\n\u00a0\nSo when it was all done (again) and Harry once more took his dreamless sleep potion, he hoped it was to wake up on the next day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry opened his eyes and once again wasn\u2019t in the hospital wing Harry knew something was Very Wrong.\n\u00a0\nHe had just lived the same day twice. Seen everyone do the same things twice. Witnessed Voldemort come back twice. Watched Cedric Diggory die twice\u2026\n\u00a0\nHe sure as hell didn\u2019t want to do that again.\n\u00a0\nHarry, however, had absolutely no clue how to fix it.\n\u00a0\nHis first thought was to go to Hermione. She was sure to have read all about time last year because of the time-turner. Harry was sure he didn\u2019t have a time-turner but it was a start.\n\u00a0\nThat is if his friends didn\u2019t think he was completely mental.\n\u00a0\nSo he got dressed in a hurry and went down to find Ron and Hermione exactly like before. Ron fidgeting and Hermione revising.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Finally, mate. Breakfast has started already.\u2019 Ron said and Harry felt his eye twitch at the repeated phrase. He just nodded though and once Hermione was up they went to breakfast.\n\u00a0\nOn the way there Harry asked in what he hoped was a casual manner \u2018Hermione, did you read a lot about time last year? I mean \u2013 with the time-turner and all.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHermione turned to look at him startled but at once she started to talk excitedly about it. \u2018Oh sure. It was fascinating stuff really. Time related magic is very unstable so it is very closely inspected by the Ministry.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Was there ever any case of someone getting like \u2013stuck in time?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Well, there was Eloise Mintumble who tried to go back in time more than just a few hours. She got stuck in the 1400\u2019s for a few days before managing to come back to her time. But the strain of it made her body deteriorate the five centuries difference and she ended up dying shortly after.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Bloody hell.\u2019 Ron exclaimed looking perturbed and Harry wholeheartedly agreed; but it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I meant more like someone living the same day over and over again.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What? Like in Groundhog Day?\u2019 Hermione said looking amused.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What the hell is a groundhog?\u2019 Ron asked confused.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Kind off like a squirrel I guess. It\u2019s an American thing. But I meant the muggle movie. It\u2019s about a man who gets stuck on a day \u2013 Groundhog Day \u2013 and lives it until he finally manages to go to the next day.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018But what makes it end?!\u2019 He exclaimed and both Ron and Hermione started at his tone.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s never really clear. But it is just a movie, Harry; nothing like it ever really happened. Why are you so worked up over this?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Nothing, I just \u2013 had a dream like that.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t tell them; he didn\u2019t even know how to explain it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s just the nerves because of the task. Tomorrow it will all be fine.\u2019 Hermione put her hand on his arm and squeezed in reassurance before they finally got to the Great Hall and went in.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sure \u2013 tomorrow.\u2019 Whenever tomorrow would be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe day went exactly the same again but when it came the time to go into the maze Harry had decided.\n\u00a0\nThis time he would take the cup alone.\n\u00a0\nHe knew the way, knew the obstacles and could very well get there before Cedric.\n\u00a0\nHe could do this.\n\u00a0\nWhen he got to the sphinx he heard Cedric scream and felt his blood freeze. Why did Crouch made Krum still crucio Cedric when Harry was obviously winning?\n\u00a0\nHe turned around but then there was silence and red sparks. Had Cedric gotten free by himself? Had Krum stopped once Crouch saw that Harry would go back for Cedric?\n\u00a0\nThe thought of Neville\u2019s parents came to Harry\u2019s mind and he shut his eyes tight. He had to continue. Had to hope that like Fleur, Cedric didn\u2019t die at the hands of this Death Eater. Any Death Eater.\n\u00a0\nSo he continued. Answered the riddle very quickly and was not attacked. He got to the Cup and there was no spider. Odd. But then again this whole thing was rigged so he could win it. Crouch probably had some way for the spider not to attack him.\n\u00a0\nHarry stood in front of the Cup, took a deep breath, and took it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd fell right into his bed. The morning he had already lived three times and was now seeing it again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What the hell?\u2019 He said to the ceiling of his four poster bed. This made no sense. He took the cup and felt the portkey activate but then instead of falling on the ground of the graveyard he was on his bed.\n\u00a0\nNo, it definitely made even less sense than it already didn\u2019t make.\n\u00a0\nWhat the hell was this that he was stuck in? Why couldn\u2019t he go alone to confront Voldemort? Did someone have to die? Did Cedric? What was he doing wrong?\n\u00a0\nHarry must have stared at the ceiling for longer than he thought because a knock on the door made him jump. Ron stuck his head over the door and looked at Harry in concern.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Alright there mate? You are taking a while.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, sorry. You and Hermione go ahead.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018If you are sure.\u2019 Ron lingered a bit but eventually went off, still a look of concern on his face.\n\u00a0\nAfter he left Harry sat up properly in bed buried his face on his hand in frustration. He had to do something. He couldn\u2019t just live this day again and again forever.\n\u00a0\nHe had to do something different and suddenly the culprit for all of this came to mind.\n\u00a0\nBarty Crouch.\n\u00a0\nHarry got dressed as fast as he could and ran towards the DADA professor\u2019s office. Before he could get to the second floor however he collided with someone who was coming out of the fifth floor corridor and they both almost fell over.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Harry. Late for breakfast too?\u2019 It was Cedric and Harry felt his heart constrict a little. Cedric must have just gotten out of the prefect\u2019s bathroom; his hair was a little damp. Otherwise he looked as great as always.\n\u00a0\nMore importantly he was alive.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, I need to see Professor Moody about something.\u2019 Cedric raised an eyebrow at this and suddenly Harry was very aware of how the other boy had put a hand on his arm so they wouldn\u2019t fall.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Our families are gonna be here after breakfast you know.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, could you just tell Mrs. Weasley I\u2019ll meet her and Bill a little late?\u2019 With that Cedric\u2019s other eyebrow went up and Harry just belatedly noticed what he said.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sure \u2013 I\u2019ll walk with you until the second floor then?\u2019 Harry almost said no, but there was really no reason to so he just nodded. \u2018Getting some last minute advice?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018With Moody.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh. Right, for the task.\u2019 That was a good excuse \u2018My shield charm isn\u2019t really all that great yet.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I could help you.\u2019 Cedric said quickly and then cleared his throat as if embarrassed \u2018I mean, I guess it makes more sense for you to go for a teacher for that. We are competitors after all.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You helped me a lot though. With the egg.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even give you the clue right. I mean.\u2019 Cedric ruffled the back of his head and gave a self-depreciating laugh. \u00a0\u2018I kept thinking later that it wasn\u2019t very clear was it?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I got it eventually. If you hadn\u2019t said anything I wouldn\u2019t have. Not even Hermione had any idea about it.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You were very good at the task. That thing you took; it was like you were a merman!\u2019 Cedric turned to him with a grin looking genuinely excited with Harry\u2019s accomplishment. Something in Harry\u2019s stomach flipped.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Gillyweed. I didn\u2019t really know how to manage to breathe underwater for an hour either. That charm you and Fleur used looked very useful. I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be able to transfigure myself into a shark.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Krum sure went all out for it. But the bubble head charm is easy, really. You should learn it in fifth year or \u2013 well, again, I could teach you if you\u2019d like.\u2019 Cedric ruffled the back of his head and the thing in Harry\u2019s stomach flipped again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019d like that. Later though.\u2019 Harry stopped and looked at the second floor corridor that they had just arrived at.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Right, here is your stop. See you later.\u2019 Cedric shot one last smile at Harry and turned to continue down the stairs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry then turned and walked until he was face to face with Moody\u2019s door. Crouch\u2019s door. It was all still confusing in his head but he shook it and let himself in. There was no one there yet but Harry was pretty sure he had activated some ward while entering so Crouch should be here any moment now. Until then Harry looked around.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered when he had been here before, right after he had told Cedric about the dragons. Fake Moody told him how his dark detector kept humming; how the sneakoscope had to be turned off because it would not stop spinning.\n\u00a0\nSeemed very obvious as to why now.\n\u00a0\nThe clunking of Moody walking finally arrived and Harry turned to see the man walk in. Moody didn\u2019t seem surprised to see him, but then again he had Harry\u2019s map. Which in hindsight was another bloody obvious mistake.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Potter. Any reason you are in my office?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wanted to ask you something, sir.\u2019 It felt foul calling this man sir after everything but Harry couldn\u2019t let his pretense go so soon.\n\u00a0\n\u2018About the task? Reckon you are ready for it, boy. All will go perfectly.\u2019 The man went farther into the office and the door closed behind him with a finality. Harry felt his skin prickle. This was it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You made sure of that didn\u2019t you.\u2019 There was a tense moment of silence in which Moody\u2019s fake eye spun like crazy before coming to look right at Harry together with his normal eye.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Figure it out did you? And came to confront me alone? Maybe you are just as big headed as Snape says you are.\u2019 He gave an incredibly nasty grin that together with the fake eye just made him look madder than normal.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What? And risk you killing anyone? At least you need me alive for your Master don\u2019t you?\u2019 Harry gripped his wand very tightly and the thought that this was probably not really a good idea finally made itself known in Harry\u2019s mind.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Do I? The Dark Lord has many enemies; he can rise with any of those. Maybe he will be grateful if I finally get rid of the pest that is Harry Potter.\u2019 And Harry had to dodge very fast because apparently Crouch was very serious.\n\u00a0\nSpell after spell the office was getting destroyed but Harry had no way of getting pass Crouch and getting through the door.\n\u00a0\nOne spell connected and Harry felt very light all of a sudden before snapping out of it. Crouch had tried to imperius him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Probably not your best idea to have taught me how to break that.\u2019 Harry turned to look at Crouch, and it was Crouch; the polyjuice must have run out while they were playing this game of cat and mouse.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That is it Potter.\u2019 Crouch said and there was an insane and angry glint on his eyes. He cast something nonverbal and Harry suddenly could not move at all and then \u2018Avada Kedrava\u2019\n\u00a0\nIt ended.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis time Harry was very glad to open his eyes and see his ceiling. He almost cried in relief.\n\u00a0\nMerlin, that had been incredibly stupid. What the hell was he thinking? He probably wasn\u2019t thinking and that was just it wasn\u2019t it? He needed someone to help him.\n\u00a0\nHe had to convince Ron and Hermione of what was happening somehow. He needed their help. But how could he do that?\n\u00a0\nHe got up and got dressed. Once he was down in the common room there they were again. Ron fidgeting and Hermione revising.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Finally, mate. Breakfast \u2013 \u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018 \u2013 has started already. So let\u2019s go.\u2019 Ron stared at him and even Hermione gave him a look from over the top of her notes but shrugged. This was typical enough of Ron that it wasn\u2019t weird. He had to do something better.\n\u00a0\nSo they went down to breakfast and Harry waited for the post to arrive. Because if knowing every word to an article that had not come out yet didn\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t know what would. Soon enough a screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t drink that right now if I were you.\u2019 Harry said just seconds before Hermione would spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it. She ignored him and did it anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 said Ron, staring at her but also giving Harry an odd look.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it.\n\u00a0\nHe stared at the headline, and said, \u2018No way. Not today. That old cow.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u2018Rita Skeeter again?\u2019 said Harry, if only to give his friends a little leeway.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The article says I\u2019m \u2018disturbed and dangerous\u2019 and it goes on how I\u2019m an attention seeker liar, that speaks parseltongue and even talks about what happened in divination the other day.\u2019 said Harry and Ron and Hermione were looking at him with very wide eyes and very open mouths. \u2018Any second now Malfoy is gonna say the words \u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd soon enough Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\n\u00a0\nRon seemed to be choking on air while Hermione was very pale. It took more than a minute for her to manage to say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry \u2013 wha \u2013 what?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018How did you like de Groundhog Day movie, Hermione?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh my God.\u2019 Hermione continued to gape at him but her eyes had gone far away, that dreamy expression that meant she was thinking. \u2018Impossible.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I really wish it was impossible but this the fifth time I\u2019m on this day and I really not looking forward to staying in it much more.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019 Ron exclaimed and Harry swept a look over the hall and noticed how everyone was giving him wary looks.\n\u00a0\n\u2018We should go somewhere else.\u2019 Hermione nodded and she and Ron got up after him but before they could reach the doors someone was calling for Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Mr. Potter!\u2019 McGonagall exclaimed when she approached them, probably not wanting him to leave. Harry had forgotten about her.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hi, Professor. Could you please tell Mrs. Weasley and Bill that I\u2019ll be with them later?\u2019 Harry said as normally as he could and McGonagall looked at him with a start.\n\u00a0\n\u2018How did \u2013 Very well, Mr. Potter. But don\u2019t keep them waiting too much. Your friends have their exams to do too.\u2019 She gave them all one of her reproachful looks and turned back towards the staff table. Harry quickly went out of the Great Hall and started looking for somewhere he could talk to his friends.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wait, my mum and Bill are here?\u2019 Ron asked confusedly before Harry finally settled on one of the several classrooms which were not regularly used and, as such, had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom.\n\u00a0\n\u2018They came to see the third task. That\u2019s not important right now. I need you to help me figure this out.\u2019 Harry looked pleadingly at his friends and Hermione was still with that dreamy thinking face and Ron just looked frustratingly confused.\n\u00a0\n\u2018This what, mate? I have no idea what you are going about just that it looks that suddenly you became very good at Divination.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry is stuck in a time space continuum.\u2019 Hermione said finally snapping out of her daze.\n\u00a0\n\u2018A what?\u2019 Ron just looked even more confused.\n\u00a0\n\u2018A time loop.\u2019 Hermione said as if it were obvious and turned back at Harry with a crease in her brow. \u00a0\u2018Are you sure Harry?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m very sure. Unless I going completely insane. Which according to Skeeter is not very unlikely.\u2019 He said with a snort but Hermione just frowned harder.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That\u2019s not funny. Have you talked to anyone else? Have you talked to us already?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, this is the first time I\u2019ve tried to talk to you.\u2019 Both Ron and Hermione looked at him in disapproval probably not liking that he had not trusted them with this yet. \u2018I was sure you were going to think I was crazy okay. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m not.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Tell us what happens.\u2019 Ron asked in an incredibly calm voice for the situation.\n\u00a0\nAnd Harry does. Tells them all that happens until the task and then inside the maze and in the graveyard. Ron and Hermione look properly horrified and when he is done Harry feels slightly guilty.\n\u00a0\n\u2018And then I just woke up here again. The first time I thought it had been a very vivid dream and just\u2026 did it all over again.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh, Harry.\u2019 Hermione sounded so sad and concerned that Harry felt a little guilty for it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 He said pleadingly and Ron and Hermione shared a look before turning back to him in sympathy.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You have to try different things I imagine.\u2019 Hermione said simply and Harry had to stop a scream of frustration from coming out of his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I have.\u2019 He tugged at his hair in frustration.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2018You have to try more. I mean, the ones you did weren\u2019t the right combination to get you out of it.\u2019 Hermione seemed to be running possibilities in her mind before turning back to Harry \u2018What did you try differently so far?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I got to the cup without Cedric but it immediately brought me back to the start of the day again.\u2019 He left out Crouch and how he almost died before. That sure would not go over well.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Huumm.\u2019 Hermione started thinking deeply again and Harry and Ron just looked at her waiting; they were used to this. A knock on the door made the three of them jump however. The door opened and there was McGonagall looking at them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Like I said Mr. Potter. You have people waiting for you and Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley have exams to go.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ll see you guys later.\u2019 Harry said and both his friends looked like they wanted to continue discussing whatever was happening but they couldn\u2019t ditch their exam; specially not with McGonagall staring them down like that.\n\u00a0\nHarry went on into the day the same as the other times. Showing around the Weasleys and then when they went back for lunch Hermione grabbed hold of him immediately and dragged him and Ron to a near alcove.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The portkey.\u2019 She said immediately like it was a great revelation.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 Harry and Ron of course didn\u2019t understand it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The Cup. It must be what is causing all this. It must need two magical signatures to work properly so when you go alone it brings you back to the start.\u2019 It was a good theory, however \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u2018That kind of makes sense but \u2013 well when I come back I only have Cedric\u2019s body and the day continues until I fall asleep.\u2019 Hermione made a frustrated sound like that was exactly what she didn\u2019t understand either.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I didn\u2019t get to that little problem yet, but just \u2013 try to go with someone else this time won\u2019t you? Maybe it\u2019ll work.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018How? With Fleur knocked out at the start and Krum imperiused?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Just \u2013 try Harry. Like you said, you can\u2019t live this day forever. What of the consequences to your body? You know when Eloise Mintumble experimented with a time-turner \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018She got stuck in the past and then when she returned she aged five hundred years. Yeah, you told me that already before.\u2019 Both Ron and Hermione just looked at him astonished.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That\u2019s so weird, mate.\u2019 Ron shook his head as if it would turn everything back on its place. Harry understood the sentiment perfectly.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Tell me about it, Ron.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo when the time came Harry chose to stupefy both Krum and Cedric on the maze once it reached the moment Krum used crucio. He looked down remorsefully at Cedric but went to Krum and rennervated him.\n\u00a0\nKrum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Harry, he tried to sit up, and Harry helped him lean against the hedge.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I attacked him!\u2019 Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. \u2018But it vasn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You were under the Imperius. I know.\u2019 Krum turned his dark and guilty gaze towards Harry and an edge of suspicion entered his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u2018How do you know?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018There a many strange things happening in this maze Krum, in this whole tournament.\u2019 Harry was thinking how he could get Krum to trust him but the boy\u2019s next words surprised him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Like your name coming out of the goblet.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You believe that wasn\u2019t me?\u2019 Many people still thought he did it, people he knew for years. And here Krum was just easily believing him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018From vot I gathered about you and vot Hermy-own-ninny tells me off you, no, I\u2019m not thinking you vonted to be here.\u2019 Harry decided then to just try and be as truthful as he could to Krum.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I need you to take the Cup with me.\u2019 Krum was visibly startled and Harry couldn\u2019t really blame him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Vot? And share the title?\u2019 Krum frowned and looked at Cedric\u2019s laying frame once again with guilt on his face.\u00a0 \u2018Vouldn\u2019t your friend make more sense?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018This isn\u2019t about wining really. Could we talk while we walk?\u2019 Krum just got up and started walking, one last remorseful look towards Cedric before continuing. Harry kneeled next to the Hufflepuff and felt also very guilty. He was the one that stunned him after all.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sorry, Cedric.\u2019 Harry said before throwing up red sparks and rushing to catch up to Krum.\n\u00a0\nThey walked on and Harry could feel that Krum was waiting for him to speak. He should do it soon because ahead there was the sphinx and then possibly a spider and the finally the damned cup. If Harry never saw that cup again it would be too soon.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Do you know anything about time loops?\u2019 Might as well throw himself out there but he wasn\u2019t really expecting much. Hermione was sure they were\u00a0just a fabrication until the moment Harry fell into one. But Krum actually gave a moment of thought to it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Very rare things. Only granted to very significant people in crucial moments.\u2019 Krum said very seriously and Harry felt a sudden relief that someone seemed to know what was happening. There was just one problem.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Granted? Like it\u2019s a gift? This is more like a nightmare.\u2019\u00a0 Krum turned his dark eyes towards Harry once more and they looked at him in a very calculating manner.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Is this vot is happening? You already know vat is in front of us.\u2019 Krum turned his eye back forward as if expecting to see whatever Harry knew was coming.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I do and \u2013 there is great danger waiting after we touch the cup. And it is a lot to ask of you to come with me but \u2013\u2019 Harry looked over his shoulder and once he looked back Krum had a very knowing look on his face. It was oddly disturbing.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Something happens with Diggory ven he goes vit you.\u2019 Krum said with certainty and Harry could only nod.\n\u00a0\n\u2018He dies and then I just begin again.\u2019 Krum considered Harry for a very long and serious moment before offering him his hand. Startled, Harry took it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Vell, it\u2019ll be an honor to try and help you vit you quest from Chronos.\u2019 He said before shaking Harry\u2019s hand once. dropping it and starting back on their path again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wait, what? Who?\u2019 Harry rushed to catch up.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ven \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0440 happens \u2013 vot you called time loop \u2013 in my culture ve learn it is because Chronos \u2013 ancient Greek God of time \u2013 vasn\u2019t satisfied vit how something happened. Then the person would go back and back until he was satisfied.\u2019 Krum explained simply and Harry was suddenly reminded of Hermione. No wonder the other boy liked her so much.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That seems very random, I mean. What if this God decides he doesn\u2019t like the way I dress in the morning and I have to live a day endlessly until I get the colour of my shirt right?\u2019 Krum actually snorted at Harry and shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It is never frivolous things. A very dangerous thing time. Even for the God who is responsible for it. Him and The Fates have to be in complete agreement for it to happen. Hence why is very rare. The Three Sisters are very difficult to get on someone\u2019s side.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry\u2019s mind was spinning like it did when this all began. He knew nothing about mythology but Krum seemed pretty sure this was the case and Harry wasn\u2019t really in a place to disregard any theory.\n\u00a0\nThey finally arrived at the sphinx, who didn\u2019t seem to mind there were two of them, and once she was done saying the riddle Harry didn\u2019t even have time to open his mouth and Krum was already answering. Harry looked at him impressed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I already knew that one.\u2019 Krum shrugged and Harry barked out a laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You know, there might appear a giant spider ahead of us. I wonder if that riddle was actually a clue.\u2019 Harry said in wonder; it really did seem a little foreboding.\n\u00a0\n\u2018A giant spider? And you are not sure?\u2019 Krum looked around as if the spider could jump out of anywhere and had his wand at the ready.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s right at the path of the Cup and it only appeared the times I was with Cedric.\u2019 Krum went silent for a very long moment and only spoke when they could see the cup.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The only obstacle ve met vas that sphinx. Someone is altering this maze so you can vin.\u2019 Krum stopped and stared once again at Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You talk of a great danger; that Diggory died. Vot is after that cup?\u2019 Harry felt panic suddenly grip his heart thinking that this was the moment Krum backed out. But he deserved the truth and Harry would not lead someone on a lie.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Voldemort. This was all a lure so he could get me. So he could return.\u2019\u00a0 Krum stared very hard at Harry and Harry didn\u2019t dare look away.\n\u00a0\n\u2018If there is one thing I despise is dark lords.\u2019 Krum said eventually after what felt like an eternity and Harry almost fell with the relief that came to him. But the other boy wasn\u2019t finished. \u2018Have you tried not taking the cup?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t really think that would work either.\u2019 Harry thinks of the previous day on the office with Crouch and how he almost died but woke up once again on this day. No, whatever this time-loop had to do with was surely about what happened on the graveyard.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I imagined that. I think I\u2019m not right person for you to go vit either.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I understand. You don\u2019t have to come really. I\u2019ll just start again tomorrow anyway. Today I guess.\u2019 Harry sighed but didn\u2019t really blame Krum. It was a lot to ask of someone, especially someone he didn\u2019t even know that well.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I meant vot I said earlier. This is an honor and I\u2019ll very gladly take the cup vit you now.\u2019 Krum then turned his gaze towards where they had come from and frowned. \u2018I just mean it is not my honor to be had.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry frowned and looked back also. He thought of Cedric. Of how he indeed had gotten farther with Cedric than alone.\n\u00a0\nBut Cedric had died and now Harry was stuck.\n\u00a0\nKrum suddenly gave Harry\u2019s shoulder a pat and nodded back to the Cup. He was right, they better go. And so they walked ahead. The spider was easier to beat once they knew it was coming and very soon they were in front of the cup.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Once we land we go back to the cup right away and it will bring us back.\u2019 Krum tore his eyes from the cup and raise one thick eyebrow at Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You know that von\u2019t vork either.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, but I have to at least try. On three?\u2019 Krum nodded and the both of them readied their hands to touch the cup. \u2018One \u2013 two \u2013 three \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe and Krum both grasped a handle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry was back on his bed again and this time he smothered himself with his pillow and screamed.\n\u00a0\nKrum must have been right. It will not work if it is not Cedric taking the cup with Harry. But why? If they were both supposed to live through this why was only Harry remembering it?\n\u00a0\nHe must have taken too long again because there was a knock on the door and Ron poking his head over the door once more.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Alright there mate? You are taking a while.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, sorry. You and Hermione go ahead.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018If you are sure.\u2019 Ron lingered a bit but eventually went off, still a look of concern on his face. Harry didn\u2019t feel like trying to convince Ron and Hermione this time so he just put on his clothes and went down on his own, not really knowing where he was going until suddenly he collided with someone who was coming out of the fifth floor corridor and they both almost fell over.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Harry. Late for breakfast too?\u2019 It was Cedric again. Harry had forgotten how he had met with him before. It seemed as though all these same days were blurring together and he could not keep track properly.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, I mean \u2013 not really sure I\u2019m up for breakfast honestly. And you?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Me? Just took a bath you know \u2013 trying to relax I guess.\u2019 He tilted his head to indicate the corridor he just came off and probably the prefect\u2019s bathroom. \u2018Couldn\u2019t really sleep last night \u2013 even if Scott wasn\u2019t snoring like a freight train.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That bathroom is really amazing.\u2019 Harry said truthfully, remembering all the taps on the pool-like tub.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know right. First time I used it I think I turned on all the taps just to see what each one was.\u2019 Cedric said and then laughed as if embarrassed by his own admission.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I did that too that time I went there. Until I remembered I had to figure out the egg that is.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I didn\u2019t really help you a lot with that right? I mean,\u2019 Cedric ruffled the back of his head and gave a self-depreciating laugh. \u2018I kept thinking later that it wasn\u2019t very clear was it?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018It helped me more than anyone else. I really had no idea what to do.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018It was only fair. I would be a pile of ash if you hadn\u2019t told me about the dragons.\u2019 Cedric looked at Harry and grinned and Harry could not help but smile back. They stood like that for a moment before Cedric seemed to shake himself and look away embarrassed again. \u2018We should probably head down. Professor Sprout told me our families would arrive after breakfast to be with us before the task.\u2019 He started going down the stairs and Harry followed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m not really waiting for anyone.\u2019 Not really a lie since Harry wasn\u2019t supposed to know the Weasleys were coming for him. He chanced a glance at Cedric and noticed the other boy was looking at him in question. \u2018I live with my aunt and uncle, they are muggles. We don\u2019t really get along.\u2019 And that was a really nice way of putting his relationship with the Dursleys.\n\u00a0\nCedric\u2019s hand was suddenly on his shoulder and when Harry looked up at him the other boy had a half smile on his face and more importantly no pity in his eyes. Harry felt very warm all of a sudden.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Harry. Know that if you need anything you can come to me.\u2019 The half smile turned into a full one and Harry felt his mouth go dry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Thanks, Cedric. I \u2013er. Think I\u2019m gonna head to the library actually.\u2019 They had just arrived at the first floor landing and Harry very suddenly felt the need to be anywhere but near Cedric.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Okay, I\u2019ll see you later than.\u2019 Cedric grinned at him once more before continuing down the stairs and Harry just stared for a moment before shaking himself and actually thinking that going to the library wasn\u2019t a bad idea.\n\u00a0\nHe arrived just at the same time Hermione was rushing out.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry! There you are. You didn\u2019t come for breakfast.\u2019 She said in disapproval and looked at him concernedly.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I felt like staying in bed a little longer.\u2019 A little lie but saying he lost track of time talking to Cedric Diggory on the stairs wouldn\u2019t go overly well. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh, Harry! I think I figured it out what Skeeter is doing to get all that information she shouldn\u2019t have.\u2019 Hermione\u2019s eyes were sparkling and Harry felt himself grow curious. Hermione didn\u2019t mention what she figured out to him and Ron.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Hermione looked around as if Skeeter would pop out of nowhere and came closer so she could whisper to Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure she is an illegal animagus.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?!\u2019 Harry whispered back incredulously. Skeeter could go to Azkaban for that.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know. I reckon she turns into something really small so she can lurk around without anyone noticing her.\u2019 Hermione sounded very proud and smug of her own discovery and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile at his friend.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That\u2019s brilliant Hermione.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ron gave me the idea actually. He asked at breakfast about the insect thing we talked about \u2013 he meant bugging \u2013 and it just came to me.\u2019 Just then the bell signifying classes were starting chimed and Hermione got a panicked look on her face. \u2018Oh my God. The History of Magic exam. See you later, Harry!\u2019 Harry just watched as she ran but then suddenly a thought clicked.\n\u00a0\nGod. Chronos.\n\u00a0\nIt was probably more than worth it to look up the things Krum had told him. So he went into the library and even ventured to ask Madam Pince where he could find books about ancient Greece. She gave him that incredibly suspicious look she always gave every student who dared breathe near her books but even so directed him to the right section.\n\u00a0\nOnce there Harry realized he had no idea where to start. So he grabbed a huge tome and went to sit on an empty table nearby hoping it could give him some information. He hadn\u2019t even turned a page when another huge tome was put next to his and he lifted his head to look startled at the person who did it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You might want to try this one instead.\u2019 It was a girl, a little younger then him and a Ravenclaw by what he could see of her uniform. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a surprised look. \u2018Hello.\u2019 She said as if it was an afterthought. Like she wasn\u2019t really completely there.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Er\u2026Hi.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m Luna Lovegood, we haven\u2019t met yet.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Right, I\u2019m Harry. Look, sorry but I\u2019m kind of busy right now \u2013\u2019 She interrupted him and her voice was also as if she had stepped out of a dream.\n\u00a0\n\u2018We can do this again tomorrow if you like. Or today I guess there isn\u2019t really a difference.\u2019 She said as if it really didn\u2019t make a difference and it probably didn\u2019t but Harry was boggled.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wait you \u2013 you know.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s very interesting watching everyone doing the same things every day or changing things. Yesterday I switched Cornhill\u2019s tea with coffee and she spat all over her papers.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What? Why?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I think she took all my quills. Just a little harmless prank.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, I mean \u2013 why aren\u2019t you stuck like everyone else?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh. I always sleep with all my protection stones.\u2019 She took out of a pocket a chain interwoven with a multitude of different stones and what even looked like crystals, \u2018You know, the usual; negativity, harmful spirits, possession, umgubulars, evil eye. Those I usually take with me, but the ones for physical travel, world distortion, alternate realities and timeshares I just keep when I sleep.\u2019 She fiddled with some specially large and odd looking stones before looking back up at Harry. \u2018Ever since this started I keep them with me too. It seems to keep me out of this loop we are having.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That \u2013 that\u2019s great!\u2019 Harry thought it was great but he honestly didn\u2019t think he fully understood. However here was an apparent solution. \u2018Do you have more of those?\u2019 Luna gave him a vague smile.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ve tried that. I gave one to Ginny in one of todays and it just returned to my trunk in the next today.\u2019 She turned her dreamy stare at a nerby window; Harry supposed that was her way of thinking things over. \u2018I think it just worked on me because I had it on the original today and it just went from there.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t you talk to me before?\u2019 Here was someone who was living the same day he was and said nothing about it when they could be thinking together.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You didn\u2019t seem very approachable before. I mean, I\u2019ve been watching you some and you just trusted you friends with this yesterday. I don\u2019t think you would open to me much before.\u2019 Harry could see her point.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I guess you are right.\u2019 Luna nodded and perched herself on top of the desk and gestured to the book she brought.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s good that you are researching Greek entities. They are fascinating and have always had a great influence in occidental magic.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You think this is it too then? Chronos or whoever messing with my life?\u2019 But Luna just shook her head and stared at a point ahead as if she could see things Harry could not.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I think is so much more than just your life, Harry. Whatever the outcome of what happens tonight will affect the whole of England, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry was stunned. Because she was right, so right. This was so much bigger than just himself and he didn\u2019t consider it; wasn\u2019t seeing the bigger picture.\n\u00a0\nVoldemort would return. He was certain that was something he could not change but he had no idea how Cedric fell into the equation of all things. Because that was the link somehow.\n\u00a0\nCedric.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Do you think \u2013\u2019 But Harry could not finish his thought since very hurried steps were coming their way. Soon enough McGonagall was upon them and she looked at them \u2013 especially Luna still sat on top of the table \u2013 very disapprovingly.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ms. Lovegood we sit in chairs, not tables.\u2019 Luna didn\u2019t look as if she particularly agreed but got off the table anyway. McGonagall turned back to Harry. \u2018Mr. Potter, Mr. Diggory said I would find you here. There are people waiting for you, if you would be so kind to follow me.\u2019 Harry grimaced at his teacher\u2019s sarcasm; there was no arguing with that tone. He looked back at Luna and she just gazed back at him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ll talk to you again tomorrow?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sure, tomorrow or today.\u2019 They both knew it was the same and Harry probably wouldn\u2019t be getting them out of this on this try.\n\u00a0\nSo he followed McGonagall and braced himself for going through the grounds with Mrs. Weasley and Bill for the nth time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry got to the maze that time he had no plan. So he just repeated everything once more. When he and reached the cup together with Cedric he thought back to what Krum had said.\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018Have you tried not taking the cup?\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHarry was almost sure that would not work but he had to at least try it once like every other possibility. So when Harry counted to three he let Cedric touch the Cup alone.\n\u00a0\nThe Cup seemed to glow ominously red to Harry for a moment before Harry\u2019s vision went black.\n\u00a0\nYeah, that didn\u2019t work. Whatever God was this, Chronos sure was a piece of work.\n\u00a0\nHarry hurried to put on his clothes and find his friends downstairs. They didn\u2019t really have time between breakfast and their exams and Harry needed all the time he could get.\n\u00a0\nWhich was ironic considering he had nothing but time nowadays.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Finally, mate. Breakfast \u2013 \u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018\u2013 has started already. So let\u2019s go.\u2019 He had to perfect everything. Notice everything because he was sure he would need it later. This day wasn\u2019t the day either but maybe he could make it the next the last one.\n\u00a0\nRon and Hermione traded a look but they continued on. Harry just looked at everything and tried to remember it. There were a few fifth and seventh doing last minute studying on the halls. A little Ravenclaw second year tripped and would have almost rolled down the stairs if it weren\u2019t for a third year Gryffindor pulling them backwards. When they got to the fifth floor landing Mrs. Norris passed and gave them a glare. Harry thought about how Cedric would be in the prefect\u2019s bathroom right now and almost stayed but decided against it. He had to focus on Ron and Hermione right now; he would convince Cedric in another way.\n\u00a0\nThe Gryffindor table was as noisy as always but Harry kept looking at everything else. Luna was at the Ravenclaw table and she gave him a slight smile even as she moved a pitcher slightly so the boy in front of her missed it; Harry just shook his head, amused. Then the doors to the Great Hall opened and in came Cedric, just some minutes before the post arrived. Harry observed.\n\u00a0\nCedric approached the Hufflepuff table and everyone seemed to get louder. Cedric smiled at everyone, even at Hannah Abbot when she accidently hit him in her enthusiasm. Then he sat next to his year mates and got such a strong pat on the back from one of them he ended up knocking a glass of juice over. His friend laughed and used his wand to clean it all up. Cedric just smiled back.\n\u00a0\nThe post arrived and Harry braced himself for the repeated scene with Ron and Hermione. He just hoped that all he had on Cedric would be enough too.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t drink that right now if I were you.\u2019 Harry said just seconds before Hermione would spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it. She ignored him and did it anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 said Ron, staring at her but also giving Harry an odd look.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it.\n\u00a0\nHe stared at the headline, and said, \u2018No way. Not today. That old cow.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Rita Skeeter again?\u2019 said Harry again and he really hoped he wouldn't have to repeat it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The article says I\u2019m \u2018disturbed and dangerous\u2019 and it goes on how I\u2019m an attention seeker liar, that speaks parseltongue and even talks about what happened in divination the other day.\u2019 said Harry and Ron and Hermione were looking at him with very wide eyes and very open mouths. \u2018Any second now Malfoy is gonna say the words \u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd soon enough Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\n\u00a0\nRon seemed to be choking on air while Hermione was very pale. It took more than a minute for her to manage to say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry \u2013 wha \u2013 what?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018How did you like the Groundhog Day movie, Hermione?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh my God.\u2019 Hermione continued to gape at him and just like before her eyes had gone far away, that dreamy expression that meant she was thinking. \u2018Impossible.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, you said that before too.\u2019 It was getting annoying really, having to repeat everything. \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go before McGonagall calls after me saying there\u2019s people waiting for me.\u2019 No such luck since McGonagall was on them as soon as they got to the doors. I was useful to make Ron and Hermione more convinced at least. Quick enough they were once again on the unused classroom and his friends were looking at him in concern.\n\u00a0\nHe went as fast as he could through Hermione\u2019s questions and getting Ron to understand. In the end the both of them were just staring at Harry with a mix of awe and concern.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know this seems really crazy okay, but I\u2019m stuck on this day and I not sure how to get out just that Cedric is probably a part of the whole thing too.\u2019 They were all silent for a moment and then Hermione sighed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Have you tried everything?\u2019 Hermione asked insistently.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn\u2019t take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But the times he is with me he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I guess it is obvious then, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged \u2018You have to go with Diggory and make sure he lives.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry was once more stunned speechless. It was so obvious; so fucking obvious. It was staring him in the face the whole time. He had an inkling that might be it but to Ron to say it so simply.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how to do that.\u2019 Harry admitted because that was just the thing. He was scared of not being able to manage, scared of being stuck on this day that Cedric Diggory just died and died.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You should try and convince him too and have you help each other every step of the way.\u2019 Ron said and his friend sounded so sure that Harry looked at him with new eyes. \u2018I think you know that, mate. The moment Diggory got to the Great Hall you didn\u2019t take his eyes off him. You can convince him too.\u2019 Harry felt his face heat with Ron\u2019s comment but otherwise was still doubtful.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You two are my friends. Cedric and I don\u2019t really have anything for him to trust me about this.\u2019 Ron and Hermione just shared an exasperated look before turning back to Harry incredulously. Hermione took a breath and started talking again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I really doubt you\u2019ll have a very hard time convincing Cedric of anything.\u2019 Ron snorted and Hermione shot him a glare before returning to a very confused Harry \u2018You just have to try Harry, even if you think it won\u2019t work.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You basically described all these days so far.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was back at the library with Luna, Ron and Hermione had gone to their History of Magic exam and Harry managed to leave Mrs. Weasley and Bill. He felt slightly bad about it but he really didn\u2019t have the mind to listen to them this time around; he could probably recite back about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley time at Hogwarts by now.\n\u00a0\n\u2018 \u2013and then Hermione said I wouldn\u2019t have a hard convincing Cedric of anything. I didn\u2019t really get it. What?\u2019 Luna was actually giggling at him from her place perched once more on the table.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Nothing, Harry. You\u2019ll figure it out; it is just really amusing from who is on the outside.\u2019 Harry didn\u2019t really want to try and figure that one out so he just ignored it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Do you think she is right though?\u2019 He asked while flipping through the\u00a0book about Greek Gods. It wasn\u2019t actually that helpful, just telling him how Chronos and his consort circled the cosmos driving the rotation of heaven and the eternal passage of time. Also something about how he ate all his children but Harry wasn\u2019t sure that was the same God.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Cedric is a very nice person. We grew up near each other you know. He has always been nice to me and has a very open mind.\u2019 Harry looked up at Luna and saw she had a gentle smile on her face. She genuinely liked Cedric, but then again who didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I can manage it today. I have to start it at the beginning of the day.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What are you going to do this time then?\u2019 Luna asked honestly curious and Harry grimaced.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m going to do the first day again and see if I can come up with a strategy\u2019\n\u00a0\nWhen Harry woke up looking at his bed ceiling he was determined. He got up and dressed and went to meet his friends in the common room.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Finally, mate. Breakfast \u2013 \u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018\u2013 has started already. So let\u2019s go.\u2019 Ron and Hermione traded a look but they continued on. And so Harry started.\n\u00a0\n\u2018There\u2019s going to be two fifth years going over their OWL notes in the next corner; one has their quill behind their ear and is frantically looking for it.\u2019 And soon enough there they were.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Where is my quill, have you seen it? It is my lucky one.\u2019 Ron and Hermione shot him astonished looks but he carried on.\n\u00a0\n\u2018There\u2019s a seventh year just at the window seat studying and drawing runes in the air with their wand.\u2019 They passed said student and his friends continued to gape at Harry. They arrived at the stairs. \u2018That little Ravenclaw is going to trip but that third year is going to pull them back and stop them from falling down the stairs.\u2019 Harry started down the stairs but his friends stopped and just stared at him. He motioned for them to keep going and they rushed down the stairs. \u2018And Mrs. Norris is going to be at the fifth floor landing and glare at us.\u2019 And there she was.\n\u00a0\nHarry stopped then and just looked at his friends who were staring at him with very wide eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, what\u2019s going on? When did you become a seer?\u2019 Ron asked and Harry snorted. He supposed it was the more logical assumption than my best friend is stuck in time one.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m not a seer, Ron. I\u2019m on a time-loop, like in that muggle movie Hermione.\u2019 Harry saw realization come to his friends\u2019 eyes and let a breath out in relief; he thought maybe this way wouldn\u2019t work.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, that \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Impossible? Yeah, not really. Look you guys go down to breakfast I have something I need to do here.\u2019 Ron and Hermione just kept looking at Harry like they had never seen him before. \u2018Please just go, I\u2019ll be down before the post arrives and then we can talk better.\u2019\n\u00a0\nLooking very reluctant and still somewhat dazed Harry\u2019s friends eventually continued down the stairs. So Harry stood there and waited. Those upperclassmen that were studying made their way down and then some stragglers but then it was just Harry waiting for sound to come from the corridor.\n\u00a0\nA few moments later he could hear steps approaching and taking a breath to reassure himself Harry stepped forward just at the right moment. He collided with someone who was coming out of the fifth floor corridor and they both almost fell over.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Harry. Late for breakfast too?\u2019 And there was Cedric smiling down at Harry and with an arm out so he could stabilize the both of them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, just going down now. And you? Enjoyed your bath? Relaxed?\u2019 Harry started going down the stairs and soon enough Cedric was next to him with a faint blush on his cheeks.\n\u00a0\n\u2018How did you \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You didn\u2019t sleep well last night right? Because of the task; not that Scott snoring like a freight train really helped you anyway.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wha \u2013 how \u2013 you know Scott?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, I have no idea who he is actually.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, what are you going on about?\u2019 A frown was starting to form on Cedric's face and Harry looked ahead and rushed his speech.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2018You did help me you know? With the egg; even if you think you weren\u2019t clear with your clue. You helped me a lot.\u2019 Harry chanced a glance up at Cedric and the other boy was looking at him in astonishment. \u2018And I got to use the prefect\u2019s bathroom. Play with all the taps just like you did on your first time there.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I never told you any of those things.\u2019 They arrived at the entrance to the Great Hall and it was just the both of them. Harry would have to do it here.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You did, you just don\u2019t remember. Look, Cedric\u2019 Harry braced himself, this was it. \u2018There\u2019s something really weird happening to me and I don\u2019t know how to make you believe me so I\u2019m just going to say somethings that are going to sound crazy.\u2019 Harry took a breath and Cedric stared at him with a very red face and very wide eyes. \u2018When you go to the Hufflepuff table they are all going to cheer for you, and I guess that is not really so weird but Hannah Abbott is going to accidently hit you. Then when you sit down one of your mates is gonna pat you in the back so hard that you knock over a glass of juice. He laughs and clears the mess.\n\u00a0\n\u2018When the Prophet arrives today there is a story about how Skeeter thinks I\u2019m \u2018disturbed and dangerous\u2019. She goes on about the pain in my scar and how I collapsed the other day in divination. How I\u2019m a power and attention seeking lunatic. Mostly rubbish really. But at some point Malfoy will go and shout \u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019 and just make an idiot of himself \u2013which I suppose isn\u2019t really unusual either.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That \u2013 that\u2019s a lot to take in.\u2019 Cedric said now looking kind of pale and frowning.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know, just one more thing before we have to enter.\u2019 Harry looked at the great clock on the Entrance Hall and he had just a couple of minutes more before the time Cedric originally enters the Great Hall. \u2018McGonagall just tells me today at breakfast that our families are coming here. I\u2019m not expecting anyone since I don\u2019t get along with my aunt and uncle. You come to get me from the hall \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know if you will now but, anyway \u2013 Mrs. Weasley comes with one of her older sons; it is a surprise. Before we go out of the chamber your dad calls out to me and says how I should not be feeling so full of myself now that you caught up to me on points. You tell me how he is upset ever since Skeeter made out like I was the only Hogwarts champion. Mrs. Weasley goes on about how Skeeter is nothing but trouble and your father should know better since he works at the ministry.\u2019 Cedric was outright gaping at Harry now.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I sound crazy, I know. But please \u2013 if all of this happens and you have anyway of believing what I have to tell you \u2013 come talk to me later.\u2019 With a last look at Cedric, Harry walked into the Great Hall and went to sit next to Ron and Hermione who were obviously very impatiently waiting for him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, you can\u2019t just drop something like that and \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wait Hermione, I have something to watch.\u2019 Hermione gave an indignant squawk but kept quiet after trading a look with Ron.\n\u00a0\nHarry watched as Cedric got to the Hufflepuff table and everyone greeted him. He smiled at them but not as wide as before, especially when Hannah Abbott accidently hit him. Cedric brushed off her apology and went to sit with his friends, but not before shooting Harry a look. After he was sat he got a strong pat on the back from one of his mates and he ended up knocking a glass of juice over. His friend laughed and used his wand to clean it all up. Cedric just locked his eyes with Harry\u2019s and stared. When the post arrived Harry gestured towards the owls and finally broke his gaze away from Cedric\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What was that?\u2019 Ron asked sounding suspicious.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ll tell you later if it works. Oh, don\u2019t bother with the paper, Hermione.\u2019 Too late she spat her juice and Harry sighed. \u2018Honestly, it\u2019s not important right now and you\u2019ll get back at her.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What\u2019s on the paper?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What do you mean I\u2019ll get back at her?\u2019 Hermione asked very interested while passing the Prophet to Ron who started sputtering obscenities. Harry gestured to Hermione to lean closer to him and whispered to her.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You figured out how she had been listening to everyone. You reckon she is an illegal animagus, something small to go undetected. Like a bug.\u2019 Hermione got her dreamy thinking face for a moment before snapping her gaze back at Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh, that\u2019s brilliant.\u2019 Hermione said smiling and Harry smiled back.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, you are brilliant.\u2019 Harry said but then came the shout form Malfoy.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry just rolled his eyes before turning to look at the Hufflepuff table and was surprised to see Cedric glaring at Malfoy just before he turned his gaze once again on Harry. Harry felt that odd stomach flip he felt around Cedric and just shrugged before looking back at Hermione. Both she and Ron were giving him very knowing looks that made him nervous.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What?\u2019 Harry asked oddly defensive.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Something you want to tell us, mate?\u2019 Ron said with a teasing grin but Harry just raised an eyebrow at him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Lots, but not here.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s get down to busyness. What is happening Harry and how do we help?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You already helped me a lot, actually. I think we are not going to be able to talk now. McGonagall is coming to tell me the campions\u2019 families were invited to see the third task and are meeting in the chamber next to the Hall.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018She doesn\u2019t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?\u2019 Hermione asked exactly like he had before and Harry laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, it\u2019s Mrs. Weasley and Bill.\u2019 Ron blanched.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What? Mom is here?!\u2019 Harry would have said something but right at that moment McGonagall reached them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\u2019 she said.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, alright.\u2019 said Harry not even reacting and McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him like she expected more of an argument.\n\u00a0\n\u2018The champions\u2019 families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is a chance for you to greet them.\u2019 She looked at him expectantly and when Harry just nodded he could see a slight frown forming on her face again.\n\u00a0\nShe moved away. Harry, Ron and Hermione just watched her go.\n\u00a0\n\u2018This is bloody weird mate.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know, Ron. I know.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSoon enough Harry was once again alone in the Great Hall. He watched Ron and Hermione go to their History exam and then saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered, but not before shooting Harry a look. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterwards. Harry stayed where he was waiting to see if Cedric would call him. Soon enough the older boy came out and just stared at Harry with an expectant look.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What am I going to say now?\u2019 Cedric asked in a light tone and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile in relief.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry, come on, they\u2019re waiting for you!\u2019 Harry parroted Cedric\u2019s words and Cedric gave an incredulous laugh and nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Indeed they are. Come on.\u2019 Harry got up and went to Cedric who started opening his mouth to ask something most likely but Harry shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Wait until everything I told you happens.\u2019 They entered together and Cedric went to his parents while Harry made his way to the fireplace where he knew Mrs Weasley and Bill were. He just waved back at Fleur\u2019s little sister before beaming back at Mrs Weasley.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Surprise!\u2019 Mrs Weasley said excitedly, and Harry chanced a glance at the Diggorys where sure enough Cedric was watching him back. \u2018Thought we\u2019d come and watch you, Harry!\u2019 She bent down and kissed him on the cheek. They exchanged the usual pleasantries before heading out the chamber.\n\u00a0\n\u2018There you are, are you?\u2019 Amos Diggory looked Harry up and down as usual and Cedric gave him a defeated look. \u2018Bet you\u2019re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric\u2019s caught you up on points, are you?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry about him,\u2019 said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \u2018Honestly dad, it\u2019s not Harry\u2019s fault if Rita Skeeter\u2019s made him out to be the only Hogwarts champion.\u2019 Harry was slightly impressed how different and the same Cedric speech was.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Didn\u2019t bother to correct her, though, did he?\u2019 said Amos Diggory. \u2018Still \u2026 you\u2019ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven\u2019t you?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\u2019 Mrs Weasley said angrily. \u2018I would have thought you\u2019d know that, working at the Ministry!\u2019\n\u00a0\nMr Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away. And Harry would have continued on as usual if Cedric hadn\u2019t just spoken.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I need to discuss somethings about the tournament with Harry, actually. Would it be a terrible bother if we were to come with you?\u2019 Cedric gave Mrs Weasley a very charming smile but Harry could only gape at him much like Cedric\u2019s father was doing.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Aren\u2019t you polite?\u2019 Mrs Weasley said with a giggle before turning a slightly frosty look back at Mr Diggory. \u2018Is no problem with us dear, you and Harry can talk all you want while we reminisce around the grounds.\u2019 Mrs Weasley smiled once more before finally exiting the chamber, Bill right behind her. Mrs Diggory pulled her grumbling husband but gave both Cedric and Harry a smile too before exiting and leaving only Harry and Cedric alone on the chambers.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Well, this never happened before.\u2019 Harry said faintly and Cedric snorted.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Good to know I can surprise you.\u2019 Harry gave Cedric a questioning look and the other boy just shook his head and started walking outside like their families before. \u2018I\u2019ve been stunned speechless this morning Harry, you can\u2019t say this is all normal. Not counting the other times you\u2019ve made me speechless during the tournament.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Today I can understand but the tournament? I was competing the same as you.\u2019 Harry squinted when they got outside; ahead of them he could see the others admiring the Beauxbatons carriage.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You out flew a dragon and basically turned into a merman. Not to mention not letting any of the hostages stay behind. All of that and you didn\u2019t even want to compete.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You didn\u2019t believe that before.\u2019 Harry said quietly and something shifted inside him once Cedric turned to look at him fully. His gray eyes were very serious.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I believe in you now. I\u2019ll believe in anything you have to tell me.\u2019 That thing inside Harry shifted again and seemed to get incredibly warm. Harry couldn\u2019t stop staring at Cedric who just stared trustingly back. It was a while before Harry felt he could start talking.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ve been living this day over and over again for more than I can bear. It\u2019s been almost two weeks if I would guess and with all of these days repeating I finally came to the conclusion that only you can really help me end this.\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric stood silently looking at Harry; he was frowning but didn\u2019t look like he didn\u2019t believe Harry. He looked mostly confused and concerned.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Why me? I mean \u2013 why would I be important to whatever is happening?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You are important, especially to what happens.\u2019 Harry said immediately and Cedric blushed. Only then Harry noticed what he said and blushed too; he continued \u2018I\u2019ll tell you everything but I also have to tell Ron and Hermione again too. So do you mind if we wait for them?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, that\u2019s fine.\u2019 They started walking again; they could see the others near the lake, probably looking at the Durmstrang ship now. \u2018Have we had this conversation a lot? You said you had to tell everything to your friends again. It must get tiring.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You have no idea. But no, this is the first time we talk about this.\u2019 And hopefully the last.\n\u00a0\n\u2018But you knew things about me, things I would have to have told you before; like Scott and the prefect\u2019s bathroom.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Right, well.\u2019 Harry ruffled his hair suddenly embarrassed, then he noticed he was doing exactly what Cedric did and dropped his hand. \u2018Somedays I would bump into you out of the fifth floor like today and we would just talk for some time. About the tasks, school or family. You even offered to help me with some spells.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did I? Well \u2013\u2019 Cedric cleared his throat and, like Harry before, ruffled his hair before shooting Harry a half smile. \u2018I wish I could remember that. The offer still stands though, even if I don\u2019t remember making it.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019d like that.\u2019 Harry was very glad they reached the lake and Bill interrupted them because he could feel his face going red.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey, you two. Lunch is at any moment now, you joining us?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018We have to go to the library for something actually. Meet you guys later?\u2019 And Harry would have felt bad for not spending any time with the Weasleys but then Bill just looked between Harry and Cedric and smirked.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sure, Harry. See you later.\u2019 Bill walked back to his mother, shaking his head like he was very amused.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m really tired of those looks.\u2019 Harry muttered without thinking and then heard Cedric choke next to him. When he looked up the other boy had a flush on his cheeks.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Why do we need to go to the library?\u2019 Cedric turned and started walking back to the castle, obviously pretending nothing happened. Harry was very thankful.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I asked Ron and Hermione to meet me there at lunch; hopefully Luna will be there too.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Luna? Little Luna Lovegood?\u2019 Cedric smiled fondly and Harry was reassured to see he liked the odd girl just as much as she seemed to like him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, for some reason she is the only one who isn\u2019t stuck either.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That is actually not as surprising as it should be. She always had a way of not fitting into whatever is called normal.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t really think any of this could be called normal.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey all probably made a very odd sight; a sixth year Hufflepuff, three fourth year Gryffindors and a third year Ravenclaw. All they were missing was a Slytherin but then Harry would really think he was going crazy. Ron and Hermione kept shooting Luna questioning looks and Harry sighed; he had to start talking.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I know you guys are probably wondering what the hell is going on,\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Not really.\u2019 Luna interrupted from what seemed to be her favourite perch on the desk. \u2018I\u2019m glad you have Cedric here this time though, Harry. I told you he was very understanding.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Thanks, Luna.\u2019 Cedric smiled at the girl who happily smiled back.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Why is she here?\u2019 Ron asked tilting his head towards Luna.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Luna is the only other person who seems aware we are living this day over and over again.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Really? How?\u2019 Hermione seemed very interested but once Luna got her crystals out of her robes she frowned.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Protection crystals; I always sleep with them.\u2019 Luna said simply and Hermione scoffed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That makes no sense.\u2019 Harry could see Hermione would continue on about it and Luna was for once looking a little angry so he interrupted; they didn\u2019t have time for this.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hermione, nothing about this makes sense and they obviously worked. So please let it go.\u2019 Hermione seemed ready to start an argument but she kept quiet and nodded. \u2018I suppose I better start from the maze.\u2019\n\u00a0\nSo he did; talked about how he encountered almost no obstacles on the maze since someone was working for him to get to the cup first. How he encountered Cedric once more after he had an encounter with Hagrid\u2019s Blast-Ended Skrewts and then a Dementor who turned out to be a Boggart.\u00a0 How he heard Fleur scream and how Krum was imperiused and how he later attacked Cedric too. How Harry helped Cedric and then they separated again and he met a sphinx. How after he answered the riddle he was close to the cup but Cedric was closer but then the spider appeared and they fought it together. And then how they argued who should get the cup before Harry suggested they both take it and after it\u2026\n\u00a0\nThe graveyard.\n\u00a0\nHarry faltered then and Cedric squeezed his shoulder while giving him an encouraging look. Harry carried on.\n\u00a0\nHe told them how the cup was actually a portkey and how it took them to a graveyard very far away from Hogwarts. How his scar exploded with pain and Wormtail appearing. How that awful, awful voice said \u2018Kill the spare.\u2019 like it was nothing. And how then Cedric was dead.\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause and Cedric\u2019s hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder dropped. Harry dared to look up at the other boy and saw how pale he was; almost like when he was dead again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Go on.\u2019 Cedric said very quietly, almost faintly. So Harry did.\n\u00a0\nHe told them about the potion. \"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.\" And them Voldemort had risen again.\n\u00a0\nThere was silence once more and all of them thought of the horror that was to come. But Harry wasn\u2019t finished.\n\u00a0\nHe spoke about how he called his Death Eaters and how they came to him. How he punished some them and talked of who was faithful and who was not. But then he returned his attention to Harry and explained all that happened for them to be at that place. How Wormtail had found him and how he had a faithful servant at the castle who did everything for Harry to enter and win the tournament. And then how Voldemort made him duel him. How he cast unforgivables at him and then once he was done playing with Harry, the killing curse.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh my god, Harry.\u2019 Hermione gasped but Harry barely heard her; he was focused on the tale.\n\u00a0\nHe explained Priori Incantatem to them. How Voldemort\u2019s wand could not cast against a wand that was its brother and how Harry saw the spirits of the people Voldemort had recently killed come out of the wand. Cedric and his parents. How they managed to stop Voldemort for a moment and then Harry got to Cedric\u2019s body and the cup and came back to Hogwarts.\n\u00a0\nAnd once again silence reined in their little corner of the library. His friends seemed to be barely breathing and Harry could relate very well to that.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That\u2019s awful, Harry.\u2019 Hermione said with a very wobbly voice, as if she would start crying.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You reckon you have to stop it somehow? You-know-who returning?\u2019 Ron said, his freckles contrasting very much with his pale face.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to stop that. I think I need someone to witness it with me.\u2019 Harry turned his gaze to Cedric who just shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Why would you need me Harry? I\u2019m supposed to die.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No! You\u2019re not!\u2019 Harry practically shouted and continued to look at Cedric with urgency \u2018If you were this day wouldn\u2019t be repeating. After I come back, the Minister acts as if all I say are lies. Even with Dumbledore backing me up and all the evidence. He acts like you dropped dead out of nowhere and that I\u2019m just as disturbed and attention seeking as Skeeter painted me out to be. He is scared, scared of what will do to his position to have Voldemort return. So he denies it.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That would work out great for You-Know-Who wouldn\u2019t it? He could do whatever he needed in the cover of the Ministry's blind eye before the war finally started again.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018War?\u2019 Ron said faintly and Harry felt his heart drop a little for his friend.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, Ron. We are going to war.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What I don\u2019t get is why we aren\u2019t going to Dumbledore with this.\u2019 Cedric said after they all had a long moment to let the concept of war sink in.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry has trouble with authority figures.\u2019 Hermione said simply.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Hey! That\u2019s not true!\u2019 Harry exclaimed indignantly and Ron snorted. \u2018I respect Dumbledore a lot okay; I just feel this really is something I can\u2019t have him interfere with. Once it is all done I\u2019ll tell him everything.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I think Harry is right; Chronos wouldn\u2019t have too many factors interfering with the time fabric.\u2019 Luna said simply while absentmindedly playing with her stones chain.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Who?\u2019 Ron asked but Hermione said at the same time.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Surely you don\u2019t mean the mythological god of time. That is \u2013\u2019 Hermione started to rant but Harry interrupted her.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Krum\u2019s theory actually.\u2019 Hermione closed her mouth and turned to look at Harry incredulously. \u2018In one of the days I told him what was happening and had him take the cup with me \u2013 it didn\u2019t work. He told me how in his culture they have known of times that this has happened. When Chronos was unsatisfied with the, how did he say? Something about significant occurrences in time and that the person has to go back until whatever it is he wants happens.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018That sounds really vague, Harry.\u2019 He could see that all this was killing Hermione\u2019s logical analytical mind but Harry could only shrug.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, but I\u2019m not really ready to dismiss anything. Nothing makes sense, Hermione.\u2019 His friend sighed and shook her head before looking at one of the clocks nearby.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Come on, Ron; we are going to be late for our DADA exam.\u2019 Ron groaned but got up and gave Harry\u2019s shoulder a pat.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Bye, mate, see you later.\u2019 They nodded to Cedric and Luna and then left.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I suppose I have to go and take my Divination exam seriously this time.\u2019 Luna said while finally getting off the desk. She turned to them with a smile. \u2018I\u2019ve had fun the last few times inventing all kinds of things; I think Professor Trelawney was really impressed.\u2019 Harry and Cedric laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Well, you actually know what happens; shouldn\u2019t be hard to go well on that.\u2019 Luna gave a small laugh too and then left the two of them alone.\n\u00a0\nThere was a moment of silence before Cedric cleared his throat and turned on his seat to look at Harry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018So what\u2019s the plan?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018If you are not opposed I would have us both take my path on the maze; I already know all the right ways so it would be easier to get to the cup.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, that is fine. But you know I meant after we take the cup.\u2019 Harry fell silent and Cedric frowned. \u2018Harry.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I don\u2019t think you are going to like it.\u2019 Cedric already had a look like he wasn\u2019t liking it but Harry carried on.\u00a0 \u2018I would ask you to hide until the right moment \u2013 no, Cedric please. None of these people would even think twice before killing you. I need you here.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You are right, I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Cedric let out a frustrated breath. \u2018But I know you are probably right.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Harry smiled at Cedric and the other boy smiled back. They stayed like that for a while before Harry shook himself out of it and felt his cheeks redden. \u2018Er \u2013 I should probably find Mrs Weasley and Bill before dinner.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, my parents most likely aren\u2019t all too happy either.\u2019 Cedric grimaced and got up.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Sorry about that.\u2019 Harry apologized while they made their way out of the library.\n\u00a0\n\u2018No, don\u2019t be.\u2019 Cedric put his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and gave a reassuring grin. \u2018We are going to get through this.\u2019\n\u00a0\nSoon enough dinner had come and gone and Harry and Cedric were in position to get into the maze. Harry tried to act as normal as he could through dinner but with Ron and Hermione shooting him worried looks it was kind of difficult not to get nervous. He was glad to be out of their sight for the moment.\n\u00a0\n\u2018So \u2026 on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\u2019 said Bagman. \u2018Three \u2013 two \u2013 one \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwards into the maze.\n\u00a0\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick, or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. He pulled out his wand, muttered \u2018Lumos\u2019, and heard Cedric do the same next to him.\n\u00a0\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.\n\u00a0\n\u2018We go left,\u2019 Harry said, and Cedric nodded. They walked together.\n\u00a0\nThey walked and walked and nothing came. There was nothing beside the hedges of the maze growing darker and darker and that feeling of being watched upon them. Harry could see Cedric was starting to get anxious.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It really doesn\u2019t happen much on my end. That corner there was where I met you again after you escaped Hagrid\u2019s Skrewts and soon ahead there will be a Boggart.\u2019 Harry said if only to make Cedric relax a little; it worked and the older boy\u2019s shoulders dropped a fraction.\n\u00a0\nSoon they turned another corner, and there it was \u2013\n\u00a0\nA Dementor was gliding towards him and he heard Cedric draw a startled breath. But it wasn\u2019t a Dementor, Harry knew and immediately cast a Riddikulus at it and making it explode in a wisp of smoke.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Your boggart is a Dementor.\u2019 Cedric said in awe as they continued walking.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, ever since third year it was one.\u2019 Harry shrugged but Cedric continued to look at him amazed. That thing inside of Harry flipped.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Your biggest fear is fear itself. That is incredibly brave, Harry.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Professor Lupin told me that too when he was teaching me how to cast a Patronus.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You know how to cast a Patronus? Really?\u2019 Cedric sounded excited and not doubtful, so Harry more than readily cast his Patronus. His stag came galloping out of his wand and circled them before disappearing. Cedric gave a delighted laugh. \u2018That\u2019s amazing, Harry.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018It is very helpful.\u2019 Harry said truthfully, thinking back on last year and how it had saved Sirius and himself from a horde of Dementors.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I guess you could teach me something too then.\u2019 Cedric said smiling down at Harry and the thing inside him was full out flipping. But then suddenly they turned and saw the odd golden mist floating ahead of them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Cedric asked and Harry grimaced.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Right, I forgot to mention that mist.\u2019 Harry sighed and started explaining it. \u2018It turns everything upside down for a moment. It is not really harmful just really disorienting. However any moment now \u2013 \u2019 No sooner did the words leave Harry\u2019s mouth there was a scream followed quickly by silence.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What was that?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Fleur. Krum must have gotten to her.\u2019 Cedric turned to look backwards with an enraged look on his face and Harry took hold of his arm to make sure he wouldn\u2019t walk towards the noise. \u2018I told you he is imperiused, there is a Death Eater controlling him; he is not responsible for his actions and he will cast a crucio at you.\u2019 Cedric blanched but nodded and turned back towards the mist ahead of them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018We just have to go over it them?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, just take a step after it goes upside down and it rights itself over again.\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd so they did and the world turned upside-down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. Because it didn\u2019t matter how many times he had done this before; to have the world turn upside down was always going to be upsetting.\n\u00a0\nBut then he felt Cedrid\u2019s hand closing on his own and it was better. They took a large breath together and then took a step as far as they could and the world righted itself. Harry fell forwards onto his knees on the wonderfully solid ground, Cedric right next to him, hand still in his. They stayed there for a moment before getting up, Cedric first and using the hand still in his to help Harry before letting go.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Come on, the Skrewt is next. We have to try and hit it on its underbelly.\u2019 Cedric just nodded and they continued on in silent for about ten minutes before rounding a corner and coming to face with it.\n\u00a0\nIt\u00a0was as\u00a0enormous as always. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armour glinted in the light from Harry\u2019s wand, which he pointed at it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Impedimenta!\u2019\u00a0Harry yelled at the same time Cedric did and one of their spells hit the mark .The Skrewt froze \u2013 they had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That was never that easy.\u2019 Harry said to Cedric who huffed a laugh but soon they continued walking not wanting to risk the skrewt starting to move again. \u2018At some point ahead was the place that Krum attacked you; I don\u2019t know what will happen now that you are with me.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You never say who is it that is the Death Eater inside the castle.\u2019 Cedric said very quietly and Harry really shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Cedric would want to know who it was.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to risk any of you doing something to let him know. He is very dangerous.\u2019 After a moment of consideration Harry decided to be truthful. \u2018But I guess it would be better for you to know now. It\u2019s Moody.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Moody?! But he is a famous Auror!\u2019 Cedric sounded indignant.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It is not really Moody; we never even met the real Moody. The Death Eater has been polyjuicing himself as Moody the entire year. He is actually Barty Crouch Jr.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Mr Crouch\u2019s son? I thought he died a long time ago.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018A lie. Mrs Crouch traded places with him in Azkaban before she died and he has been hiding with his father ever since and now \u2013 well,\u2019 They fell silent and Harry was glad. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Barty Crouch and what his family did for him and yet he still killed his own father like it was nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry.\u2019 Cedric called and Harry snapped out of it and looked ahead. There was the sphinx. Harry let out a breath and thanked everything that they didn\u2019t encounter Krum; he really didn\u2019t want to have to attack Viktor.\n\u00a0\nWhen they were close enough she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice like always. \u2018You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018There is a riddle, right?\u2019 said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, continuing to pace and looking pleased. \u2018Answer on your first guess \u2013 I let you pass. Answer wrongly \u2013 I attack. Remain silent \u2013 I will let you walk away from me, unscathed.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018OK,\u2019 he said. \u2018Can we hear the riddle?\u2019 He was humoring her and Cedric shot him a look that told him he knew exactly what Harry was doing.\n\u00a0\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very centre of the path, and recited:\n\u00a0\n\n\u2018First think of the person who lives in disguise,\n\n\nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\n\n\nNext, tell me what\u2019s always the last thing to mend,\n\n\nThe middle of middle and end of the end?\n\n\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard\n\n\nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.\n\n\nNow string them together, and answer me this,\n\n\nWhich creature would you be unwilling to kiss?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\nHarry looked at Cedric and gave him a cheeky grin. \u2018Do you wanna have a go?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCedric shook his head and laughed \u2018We can solve all the riddles you want after we get out of here. You can have this one.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018A creature I wouldn\u2019t want to kiss is\u00a0a spider!\u2019 \u00a0Harry answered easily and smiled back at Cedric.\n\u00a0\nThe sphinx smiled at them. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Thanks!\u2019 said Harry and Cedric at the same moment before they dashed forwards.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It is close now, just ahead. If the spider appears it is the same thing we did with the Skrewt; we aim it for its underbelly. Be aware of your left.\u2019 Cedric just nodded and soon they saw it.\n\u00a0\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Harry and Cedric broke into a run, when a dark figure hurtled out of the left. Cedric rolled and brought Harry down with him; both of them out of the path of the spider and in a good position to aim at it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Stupefy!\u2019\u00a0They yelled together and the spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u2018You all right?\u2019 Cedric asked already sitting up and giving Harry a hand.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yeah, again; never that easy.\u2019 Cedric pulled him up and huffed a laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Guess it is easier when both parties know what is going on.\u2019 They turned back to the path of the cup and walked more sedately towards it.\n\u00a0\nThis was it.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Promise me once we get to the graveyard you will hide immediately.\u2019 Harry pleaded and he could see how hard it was on Cedric to agree.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I promise.\u2019 Cedric said and Harry felt more at ease, so he took out the thing he had hidden on his robes\u2019 pocket.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Here, have this.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Cedric took the silky fabric and looked at it in confusion.\n\u00a0\n\u2018My invisibility cloak. Use it carefully.\u2019 Cedric gaped at it before nodding and putting it in his own pocket before turning back towards the cup; Harry turned too. \u2018On three, right?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018One \u2013 two \u2013 three \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\n\u00a0\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onwards, in a howl of wind and swirling colour, Cedric at his side.\n\u00a0\nHarry felt his feet slam into the ground; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup. He raised his head and looked at the now familiar view of the graveyard.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Cedric, the cloak.\u2019 Cedric frowned but nodded and soon enough he disappeared completely. Harry breathed out in relief.\n\u00a0\nHarry got to his feet and waited. Soon enough a dark figure approached and Harry\u2019s scar exploded with pain. He was being dragged towards a marble headstone and he knew what came next.\n\u00a0\n\n\"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly sacrificed, you will revive your master. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.\"\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then for how many times Harry could not even remember anymore.\n\u00a0\nLord Voldemort rose again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis time when Priori Incantatem happened Harry could only feel relief to see the old man come out of Voldemort\u2019s wand first.\n\u00a0\n\u2018He was a real wizard, then?\u2019 the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \u2018Killed me, that one did \u2026 you fight him, boy \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry just nodded and noticed how the Death Eaters were falling to the ground suddenly. But then a feeling of loss came to him suddenly; this was probably the last time he would see his parents, but he shook it off. And soon enough there they were.\n\u00a0\nThe smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him \u2026 and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his mother.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Your father\u2019s coming \u2026\u2019 she said quietly. \u2018He wants to see you \u2026 it will be all right \u2026 hold on \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\nAnd he came \u2026 first his head, then his body \u2026 tall and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort\u2019s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and he spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear \u2026\n\u00a0\n\u2018When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments \u2026 but we will give you time \u2026 you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts \u2026 do you understand, Harry?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Harry gasped; fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Do it now,\u2019 whispered his father\u2019s voice. \u2018Be ready to run \u2026 do it now \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018NOW!\u2019 Harry yelled; he didn\u2019t think he could have held on for another moment anyway \u2013 he pulled his wand upwards with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died \u2013 but the shadowy figures of Voldemort\u2019s victims did not disappear \u2013 they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze \u2013\n\u00a0\nAnd Harry ran as he had never run in his life, jumping over two stunned Death Eaters as he passed; he zig-zagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones \u2013 suddenly he felt a hand on his own and almost jumped before remembering it was Cedric and breathing out in relief.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Stun him!\u2019 he heard Voldemort scream before turning and locking his gaze with the Dark Lord's.\n\u00a0\nVoldemort\u2019s red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Accio!\u2019 Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup.\n\u00a0\nIt flew into the air, and soared towards them \u2013 Harry caught it by the handle and saw Cedric\u2019s hand come out of the cloak to do the same \u2013\n\u00a0\nHe heard Voldemort\u2019s scream of fury at the same moment as he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked \u2013 it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and colour, Cedric along with him \u2026 they were going back \u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him was swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching \u2013 the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup, and Cedric\u2019s hand.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly he started laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry? Are you OK?\u2019 He could hear Cedric next to him ask worriedly but he continued sniggering and at once the other boy sat up, turned him over and looked down at Harry, who just laughed harder.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did you honestly go around stunning Death Eaters while you were invisible?\u2019 Harry said between laughs and struggling to sit up; Cedric started laughing too.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t really do nothing and I stayed hidden so \u2013 I kept my promise.\u2019 Cedric said simply with a shrug and a bashful grin.\n\u00a0\n\u2018And here I thought Slytherins were the cunning ones. You are unbelievable.\u2019 Harry said but then suddenly a pair of hands seized his shoulders roughly and sat him up properly. He stopped smiling.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Harry! Harry!\u2019\n\u00a0\nAlbus Dumbledore was crouched next him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing nearer; they had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.\n\u00a0\nHarry let go of the Cup, but clutched Cedric\u2019s hand to him even more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore\u2019s wrist.\n\u00a0\n\u2018He\u2019s back,\u2019 Harry whispered. \u2018He\u2019s back. Voldemort.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happened?\u2019\n\u00a0\nCornelius Fudge appeared and frowned at Harry and Cedric and the cup next to them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Did \u2013 did the both of you grab it?!\u2019 He sounded appalled and Harry felt the urge to laugh again. Honestly, two champions were the least of his problem.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Professor, Moody is gonna appear and try to take me with him any minute now,\u2019 Harry ignored Fudge and the crowd of students that had started to cheer for either him or Cedric or both. He needed Dumbledore to listen to him. \u2018Don\u2019t let him; he is not who you think he is. He is polyjuiced and he is the one who did all this.\u2019\n\u00a0\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes looked very deeply into his and Harry had that odd feeling he had from time to time that the Headmaster could read minds. Blue eyes then took in Harry\u2019s haggard appearance; how his arm had a bleeding cut and he was shaking both from exhaustion and from being tortured. Dumbledore regarded Cedric and how he still had Harry\u2019s cloak in his hand and then the Cup. Soon enough there was the distinct clunking of Moody approaching.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019ll take Harry to the hospital wing, Dumbledore, I\u2019ll take him \u2013\u2019 But Moody said no more because as fast as lighting Dumbledore stunned him. The whole crowd fell silent.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Dumbledore! What on earth!\u2019 The Minister looked like he would have a stroke. \u2018Attacking one of your teachers! An ex-Auror!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018This is not Alastor Moody, Severus if you\u2019d please.\u2019 Harry never in his life was so relieved to see Snape; Dumbledore was taking him seriously. \u2018If you would be so kind to lend us your office; we will need the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens, and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid\u2019s house, there you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Cornelius, do come with us and interrogate the suspect too.\u2019 Dumbledore said as an afterthought to Fudge before helping Harry to his feet, then Harry ended up pulling Cedric too since they were yet to let go of each other; neither of them seemed inclined to.\n\u00a0\nDumbledore levitated the stunned Moody and started walking back into the castle, Snape, Harry, Cedric and, once he seemed to get his act together, Minister Fudge.\n\u00a0\nOnce they were inside Snape\u2019s dudgeon office, Dumbledore tied Moody to one of the chairs, pulled out the one at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody. Harry stared at him, too knowing already what would happen. Minutes passed in silence \u2026\n\u00a0\nThen, before Harry\u2019s very eyes, the face of the man on the chair began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole, and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled grey hair was withdrawing into the scalp, and turning the colour of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man\u2019s face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.\n\u00a0\nHarry heard Cedric gasp and even Professor McGonagal,l who had returned sometime before, gasped too.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Crouch!\u2019 Snape said, looking stunned. \u2018Barty Crouch!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Good heavens,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall.\n\u00a0\nFilthy, dishevelled, Winky peered around Snape\u2019s legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek. \u2018Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\u2019\n\u00a0\nShe flung herself forwards onto the young man\u2019s feet. \u2018You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed master\u2019s son!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018He is simply Stunned, Winky,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018Step aside, please. Severus, you have the Potion?\u2019\n\u00a0\nSnape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid; the Veritaserum and then Harry was listening once more the tale of Barty Crouch.\n\u00a0\nHow his parents helped him escape from Azkaban, about Bertha Jonkins and the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup. How Voldemort appeared at his house with Wormtail and put his father under an Imperius. How Voldemort gave him a task to prove his loyalty, and then about trading places with Moody so that he could assure that Harry entered the tournament and how he killed his own father. And then\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u2018I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,\u2019 whispered Barty Crouch. \u2018Turned it into a Portkey. My master\u2019s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honoured by him beyond the dreams of wizards.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.\n\u00a0\nCornelius Fudge was incredibly silent trough out the whole ordeal and Harry knew he had to stop whatever was going on in the Minister\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You are thinking about having him Kissed.\u2019 Harry said suddenly in the silence that had reigned in Snape\u2019s office once Crouch was done talking. Everyone but Dumbledore jumped, like they forgot Harry was even there; Cedric\u2019s hand in his squeezed hard.\n\u00a0\n\u2018A Legilimens now, Mr Potter?\u2019 Fudge said stonily, refusing to look at Harry or anyone else. Harry glanced at Dumbledore and saw the Headmaster give him a nod; it was all he needed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018This man is our proof, he has all the evidence. You have him kissed and you are deliberately destroying that.\u2019 Fudge then turned to Harry, enraged; Harry heard McGonagall gasp and once again Cedric\u2019s hand squeezed his.\n\u00a0\n\u2018This man is a lunatic!\u2019 Fudge sputtered and gestured at Crouch while still staring at Harry \u2018I would be very careful with what you say Potter. It seems like you are accusing me of something.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I am.\u2019 Harry agreed and knew he was being stupidly brave at that moment. \u2018You don\u2019t want to admit that Voldemort is back but he is. I saw everything, I was there.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Not like your word counts for much either, Potter.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t the first time Harry heard it but it angered him all the same.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Reading much Rita Skeeter, Minister?\u2019 Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n\u00a0\n\u2018And if I have?\u2019 he said, looking at Dumbledore. \u2018If I have discovered that you\u2019ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place \u2013\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You mean the pains in my scar? The pains that always tells me when Voldemort is up to something! And look at that, he is back!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018He can\u2019t be back!\u2019 Fudge screamed and for once everyone in the office seemed stunned speechless. \u2018He can\u2019t. It would ruin me.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You are blinded,\u2019 said Dumbledore finally, his voice rising, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing, \u2018by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! I tell you now \u2013 take the steps you know you have to, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers for Magic we have ever known. Fail to act \u2013 and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Insane,\u2019 whispered Fudge, backing away. \u2018Mad \u2026\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSnape strode forwards from his place on the corner, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm, and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\n\u00a0\n\u2018There,\u2019 said Snape harshly. \u2018There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was, an hour or so ago, when it burnt black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burnt into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing each other, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff\u2019s, too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord\u2019s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\u2019\n\u00a0\nFudge stepped back from Snape, too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled, at the ugly mark on Snape\u2019s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I must return to the Ministry.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe had almost reached the door but then Cedric steeped away from Harry and came to stand in front of it. Fudge stopped and seemed to recoil again.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I was there too you know Minister. I saw everything that happened. You have no claims on my mental health; can ask anyone who knows me to pledge for it.\u2019 Fudge was starting to look around as if to find another exit. \u2018I\u2019m overage you know, had to be to enter the tournament. I can very willingly volunteer myself for an interrogation under Veritaserum. I can give anyone who asks my memories. I can stand in the atrium of The Ministry all day, every day, and talk about it to anyone who wants to hear about the night You-Know-Who returned.\u2019 Cedric was impassable and Harry never felt so awed by someone before.\n\u00a0\nFudge seemed to lose all the fight in him; it was like he shrunk in size. He turned to look at Dumbledore and sighed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Very well, Dumbledore. You win.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Oh, my dear Cornelius. I don\u2019t think anyone is a winner in this.\u2019 The Headmaster got up and strode to the door. \u2018If you would please wait in Minerva\u2019s office, I still have to talk to Harry about tonight\u2019s happenings before you and I can discuss all that will have to be done.\u2019 Fudge just nodded and let himself be led by McGonagall. Dumbledore turned to Harry and Cedric.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You were both very brave tonight, but if I might ask that you let me talk to Harry alone for a moment Mr Diggory.\u2019 Cedric seemed like he would argue for a moment but caught himself. \u2018I will want to talk to you too, but now why don\u2019t you go to the hospital wing. I\u2019ll send word for both your families to meet you there and bring Harry down once we are done.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce Harry was done telling his tale, all of it this time \u2013 with the ever resetting days and all \u2013 it felt like Sirius would snap his shoulder with all the force he was putting over it. But Harry could only look at Dumbledore sad blue eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u2018To have endured such hardship over and over again, Harry. You indeed have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I just ask why you didn\u2019t come to me at any moment.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing most of the time, Professor. I can\u2019t even be sure if I won\u2019t wake next and I\u2019ll be staring at my ceiling again.\u2019 Harry admitted what he was dreading. Because if this wasn\u2019t it he had no idea what was.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Time, is a very dangerous magic; very fickle. Let us hope that you were right. But if not, please come to me next time.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018I will, sir.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Good. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace \u2026 Sirius, would you like to stay with him?\u2019\n\u00a0\nSirius nodded, and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog, and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.\n\u00a0\nWhen Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs Weasley, Bill, Ron and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Cedric, who had his parents next to him, together with Luna and one of his year mates. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him.\n\u00a0\nAll of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore and the black dog entered, and Mrs Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream. \u2018Harry! Oh, Harry!\u2019\n\u00a0\nShe started to hurry towards him, but Dumbledore moved between them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Molly,\u2019 he said, holding up a hand, \u2018please listen to me for a moment. Harry and Cedric have been through a terrible ordeal tonight. Harry has just had to relive it for me. If you would please also not bother Cedric. What they needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If they would like you all to stay with them,\u2019 he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, Bill, the Diggorys, Luna and Cedric's friend too, \u2018you may do so. But I do not want you questioning them until they are ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.\u2019\n\u00a0\nMrs Weasley nodded. She was very white.\n\u00a0\nShe rounded on Ron, Hermione and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, \u2018Did you hear? They need quiet!\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018Headmaster,\u2019 said Madam Pomfrey who had been standing back and was staring down at the great black dog that was Sirius, \u2018may I ask what \u2013?\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,\u2019 said Dumbledore simply. \u2018I assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry \u2013 I will wait while you get into bed.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHarry went straight over to the bed next to the one Cedric had already laid, suddenly feeling very exhausted.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018I would like you to remain here tomorrow, until I have spoken to the school.\u2019 He left.\n\u00a0\n\u2018Are you OK?\u2019 Harry turned his head and asked Cedric who gave him a half smile.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I should be asking you that. I didn\u2019t even really do anything.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u2018You did so much.\u2019 Harry said with so much feeling that made Cedric\u2019s lips part in wonder. Thankfully a throat clearing made they break the probably too long stare.\n\u00a0\nMadam Pomfrey was stood next to Harry\u2019s bed, she handed him some pyjamas and pulled screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pyjamas, opened the screens and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs Weasley and the black dog came and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him; same as Cedric\u2019s parents, Luna and his friend did next to him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018I\u2019m all right,\u2019 he told them. \u2018Just tired.\u2019\n\u00a0\nMrs Weasley\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily.\n\u00a0\nMadam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding two goblets and a small bottle of some purple potion.\n\u00a0\n\u2018You two will need to drink all of this.\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s a potion for dreamless sleep.\u2019 Harry knew very well what it was and was very wary of it. Cedric noticed.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s alright.\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2018What if it all goes back again?\u2019 Harry asked nervously and was glad when Hermione took his hand in hers. He was aware half the room didn\u2019t really understand what he was talking about but he didn\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\n\u2018If that happens you know you can count on us either way.\u2019 Hermione said giving him the best smile that she could and it actually did make him feel better. So he took the goblet and drank it. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once and soon he was asleep.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHarry woke up to a very loud and unknown sound. He opened his eyes and everything was blurry.\n\u00a0\n\u2018What the hell is that noise?\u2019 He mumbled while looking for his glasses, someone must have moved them.\n\u00a0\n\u2018That would be Scott.\u2019 A voice next to him said and for a moment Harry heart skipped. He hurried to find his glasses and once they were on he could have cried in relief.\n\u00a0\nHe was in the Hospital wing, with its white linen sheets and vaulted ceiling. Next to him in all manners of sleep were Ron, Hermione \u2013 his friend had a jar with what looked like a beetle next to her and Harry could very well imagine what that was \u2013, Mrs Weasley and Bill and he could even see Sirius' animagus form at the foot of his bed. Looking to the other side he could equally see Mr and Mrs Digorry also asleep, Luna sleeping like a cat in one of the beds farther away and Cedric\u2019s friend \u2013 Scott \u2013 folded over it with his head on top of his arms and sleeping; and snoring indeed very loudly.\n\u00a0\nMost importantly he could see the sunshine coming through the windows.\n\u00a0\nHe turned his eyes \u2013 which he felt were suspiciously wet \u2013 back at Cedric who was smiling very softly back at him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s tomorrow.\u2019 Harry could feel his voice catching but he didn\u2019t really care either. Cedric just nodded and continued smiling at him.\n\u00a0\n\u2018It\u2019s tomorrow.\u2019"
