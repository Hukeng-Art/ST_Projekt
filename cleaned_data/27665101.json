B.\", has gone from an average of 10 views per post to an average of 20,000 views per post.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku does not know how to view the impressions analysis for his suddenly popular blog, and only notices that sometimes, people actually comment on his posts now. He does not google himself or his moniker and thus does not see the rise in online articles and speculation.</p>\n<p>He is unaware that the \"kyuu-ei-bee\" he begins to hear about in passing refers to his own blog. He does not have a Twitter account.</p>\n<p>At the time, Midoriya Izuku is 15 years old.<br></p>\n<p>Izuku (accidentally) starts a cult.</p>",

HOWEVER; the anime makes several references to 20XX, so uh that's what i went with. also the anime makes references to \"yahoo news\" (and no way yahoo is gonna be around that long) so i feel justified in just saying bnha is set in a parallel modern day universe. therein also lies my justification of the abuse of modern day social media sites.<br>- the reason i used 20X4 is bc bnha released in 2014 and im afraid i may need to increase the year counter at some point. (the first draft just used 20XX, but that was before things got ~out of hand~.)<br>- \"shuttai\" is an alternate reading of the kanji used for \"izuku\" (well... sort of. don't think about it too hard)<br>- ive decided to include japanese honorifics for. reasons? (i think i had a real reason at one point but i cant remember now so im just going to trust past!me on this one.)<br>- - i have spent several hours watching random bnha clips youtube and hulu in the original japanese to figure out what everyone uses for honorifics bc they sure do localize bnha, dont they :/ i had to guess on a few.<br>- in japanese, when you're talking to (or about) someone on the internet, you generally use '-san'. im going to be taking a looot of liberties here and mixing and matching the way engish speakers and japanese speakers talk to each other online, partially for convenience, partially for flow. (you probably wont notice, but ive lost sleep over it.)<br>- we're using military time bc thats the staple in japan.<br>- after mirio comes to terms with midoriya's blog post, he changes his online handle(s) to \"pacman\". i have yet to smuggle this in anywhere and am incredibly sad.</p>\n<p><b>warnings:</b><br>- i have NOT figured out the theoretical days of the week for this theoretical year bc my brand of crazy only takes me so far.<br>- im pulling from the bnha:illegals crew. just know they exist i guess? (koichi, kazuho, and iwao.)<br>- i have several ideas for how this fic will go, but rn im only promising you \"part 1\". part 1 will be standalone. part 1 is complete sans editing and sans a metric buttload of html.<br>- i do not know html. i've spent the last two weekends learning (/suffering) and being forced to create my own workskins bc ao3 hates spaces.<br>- i played around with a lot of different types of formatting before settling on what i hope comes across as \"minimalistic but still recognizable and nice to look at\". if i did not succeed, i only want to know if it's a small, fixable thing; otherwise, i prefer to live in semi-satisfied ignorance. thank you for your understanding and cooperation.<br>- i am still not happy with the spacing between lines during texting rants but i am also very, very tired. i might circle back.<br>- i am still not happy with how i've got sort-of-but-not-really right-aligned text working, but this is likely NOT changing bc ive spent the last 8h just getting it to this point.<br>- i have not quite decided how to handle transitions and am liable to change it. suggestions welcome, i guess?</p>\n<p><b>final notes:</b><br>- if you notice any weird errors (particularly in the html) please, please let me know!<br>- google now thinks im a robot and i have to keep clicking the 'im not a robot' captcha. apparently googling html terms is suspicious??<br>- ive never had to make such a detailed timeline in my life and i dont care for it at all and now that we're live im just praying i dont have to go back and change the timeline and all the date/timestamps AGAIN<br>- ao3, why u no support flexbox :(</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(<b>update:</b> <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/PoppinBoppin\" rel=\"nofollow\">PoppinBoppin</a> made a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/quirkanalysisblog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> like a total madlad, just thought y'all should know (does contain spoilers tho! if you're new to the series and care about that.))</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr authors notes: </strong><br>- uh, dont worry about the stuff kouichi did? its legit and makes midoriya much harder to find/track<br>- fun fact, yap!news is bnha canon<br>- haha yeah so how about that stain guy<br><strong>gratuitously unnecessary authors notes: </strong><br>- blockquotes are so cute?? like omg time to update all my summaries bc ~ b l o c k q u o t e s ~<br>- layering blockquotes is :( not allowed :(<br>- thusly, (multiple) vertical lines are hell<br>- i invented a college for kouichi. i thought about it long and hard and felt very clever. i thought it was important that u know i suffered over a fake email address that shows up exactly once and may never be used again. am i stupid.<br>- i forged a whois report. i forged. an entire whois report. why did i do that. why am i like this.<br>- i need you to believe me the whois report is incredibly accurate.<br>- i also need you to know that it's actually like three times as long and was in the original draft and on some readthrough a while back i was all, \"wait, w. why did you include this entire thing.\" and the answer was \"because i doctored the entire thing and it was hard\" but that wasnt enough reason to make the final cut.<br>- so one time i ordered this sketchy thing from a kickstarter and it never showed up. no tracking number, no emails. i emailed the help email but a week went by with no response. i called the listed help number but it was an automated voice with no actual help to offer. so i ran whois against the website for the inventor guy and snagged his phone number and called him up, all \"hey uh, sorry to bother you but can you help me get my thing, i dont think it shipped\" and he was all *\"who is this, how did you get this number\"*. it was his personal cell. he did help me out tho.<br>- moral of this story is *BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SET UP A WEBSITE*.<br>- yap!news is used in actual bnha but i cant find it on the wiki/reddit/anywhere? i promise its a thing, i was watching the anime and remember laughing at it and writing it down. it's obviously a play on yahoo!news, which i might not have realized except that it's the End All Be All news source for like. japan. i dont make the rules and am just as confused as you are.<br>- at one point during the html testing process, i angered the html gods and had to take a very long break: https://imgur.com/a/cFonEc3<br>- i think im almost done with examples for every kind of media i include in season 1. this is very exciting bc i can maybe stop dying in html every weekend and get back to actual writing.<br>- on the other hand, im not sure if ao3 will let me put three vertical lines next to each other, and idk how nesting divs works? so im currently living in the happy world of not knowing and thinking, logically, it'll be fine. but having spent so much time with ao3 trying to \"help me out\" and html being the worst thing ever invented, i think im going to be spending a lot of time crying in the near future.<br>- (sorry html i didnt mean it i love u)<br>- but like at that point do i alter the actual text/story vs letting the formatting suffer? how am i suppose to make that choice because i KNOW i'll choose the formatting and i also know that's very much not what i should do.<br>- re: vertical lines are HELL<br>- ch3 is a lil more exciting, but ch 4 is where it's AT (as in, where hawks is at bc he shows up again briefly and i just love him okay)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><b>so anyway:</b><br>- first and foremost, you CAN nest vertical lines, it just makes you want to tear your hair and eyeballs out<br>- but DID YOU SEE? NESTED VERTICAL LINES. BOOYAH.<br>- chapter count has been upped bc i split a chapter in half.<br>- it'll likely go up again bc 1, im bad at math and 2, 10 is a better number than 9.<br>- 'suiran' is a reference to 'arashi', a (Very) popular jpop boys band. they use the same kanji, bc i like to make dumb obscure kanji jokes. (\u7fe0\u5d50 - suiran; \u5d50 - arashi)<br>- i dont think ive ever heard an arashi song so idk if they're any good?<br>- kouichi doesnt know what/who suiran is, but he knows it would make Kazuho mad if she found out. im hoping to smuggle that in at some point, but if i dont manage it, at least now you know.<br>- thanks to Mayhap_Mishap for the libel/slander fix<br>- i had to rewrite the timeline again and it ate my whole weekend :( but i shouldnt have to do it again for arc1. (im trying not to think about arc2.)<br>- i made some formatting edits to previous chapters and will likely do so again but im tired rn<br>- \"no one will notice\" i say out loud; \"you cannot unknow your own sins\" my brain whispers<br>- i have come to the realization that this is the most ambitious writing project ive ever attempted and have started to sweat.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><b>ch4 notes:</b><br>- semi-major, not at all important, retroactively updated formatting in previous chapters. i keep figuring out how to do things i'd given up on.<br>- (updates are mostly ch1 and a little of ch3. i was too tired for ch2, maybe later.)<br>- i was split between \"chi-chan\" and \"hime-chan\" (chi being blood and hime being princess) so lemme know if you've got a preference. they're both dumb enough to be funny to me<br>- i turned on discord light to check how things were formatted against a white background and i still feel unsettled from looking at it<br>- have i finally gone too far with the colored background squares?? i thought about not putting them in but. they're so pretty.<br>- i was gonna have some people use actual text/sms in this chapter, but i couldnt in good faith do it. no one uses sms in japan, it's all line all the time. (and some messenger, but ugh no thanks)<br>- \"ku\" means. uh. ward? it's like an area of a prefecture.<br>- (you can skip this next part if you dont care about physical location details)<br>- japan's split up weird, but lets talk about tokyo.<br>-- tokyo is a prefecture. tokyo is split into 23 \"wards\".<br>-- in japanese, 'ward' is 'ku'. so harajuku is in 'shinjuku-ku'. i am physically incapable of using the word ward, it confuses me. when i was hearing kamino spoilers through the grapevine and everyone kept saying 'kamino ward' i was 100% sure the kamino arc took place in a hospital.<br>-- basically, if you see \"-ku\", it's an area in tokyo.<br>- osaka is way south west of tokyo<br>- UA (and midoriya) are in shizuoka (south of Tokyo) but i feel like the majority of crimes would happen in tokyo. (lots of hero agencies seem to be in tokyo, including best jeanist and all might's agencies.) so uh. QAB messes around in tokyo a lot, dont worry about it<br>- this fic is starting to feel like 'today i learned html could do X, and then tried to make it do my bidding. come, listen to the agonized screaming of my soul' but if y'all r still here, then \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><b>n o t e s :</b><br>- i didnt mean to write an interlude, it just happened. i was looking at ~1k of consecutive, todoroki-centric content, and screamed at myself \"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS.\" my brain screamed back, \"AN INTERLUDE, IDK, JUST RUN WITH IT\"<br>- increased ch count to 10 just like i threatened. im actually p pleased bc 10 is such a good number.<br>- next chapter: get ready for a useless info dump on japanese ssns and the borderline irresponsible mixing of japanese and american ssn history/lore, id be more excited if i hadnt made it so much work for myself, why did i do this</p>\n<p><b>c o m p l a i n t s : </b><br>- i crafted a whole second discord layout bc i figured kouichi would be using the desktop version of discord during this chapter, but i couldn't get it to look okay on both desktop and mobile versions of ao3 so a scrapped it and i am just super sad okay, i really wanted to use that format<br>- there's a known issue wherein on some devices (ie, only one device that i know of and it isn't mine), right aligned text appears inexplicably smaller than all other text. im hoping this is an extremely isolated incident bc i dont think there's anything i can do about it, i tried really hard, i promise :(<br>- (this has been a known issue from the start but i only recently took a serious stab at trying to fix it so idr if i mentioned it before or not.)</p>\n<p><b>from this point on im just going to complain about html gratuitously, u can leave if u want. this is the abbreviated version, can u believe: </b><br>- i didnt want to bore you with too many of the details but BOY OH BOY WAS THERE SUFFERING IN THIS HOUSE<br>- the problem is, its not even anything that matters. ive just been trying for the last two weeks (not like, straight, but there were a few all-nighters) to get things to like, fade out? bc i. i needed it. i learned it existed and was all \"yeah we need that right now immediately\"<br>- lowkey i think my brain just wants to make ch1 the most beautiful mock-up known to man, who knows<br>- btw uh. i updated the formatting on ch1 again.<br>- so anyway i did it after much blood and tears and screaming and y'all are lucky my computer was out of commission this week (y'all being the operative term for \"you unfortunate saps on apple devices\"). this is because if it hadn't been, i never would have in a thousand years touched safari and found out transparent doesnt work the same<br>- whys this you ask? BECAUSE APPLE HATES CONFORMING AND LIKES TO MAKE UP DUMB ARBITRARY RULES TO MAKE THE REST OF US SUFFER is all i can come up with<br>- had to hit up my art degree sister and be all \"what is rgba\" and she was all \"what do u mean u dont know what rgba is, how is this possible, have u never used an art program\" and im still a little iffy on the 'a'<br>- anyway imma add a fade out thing to the next chapter (that was the whole point of this madness) and probably add it in to previous chapters where it makes sense to do so (ie. basically everywhere i can shove it bc i spent literal days of my life figuring out how to 1, do the thing, 2, do the thing on apple products)<br>- screw you, apple. &gt;:(</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>[1] <a name=\"note1\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"note1\"></a>\"My Number\" is japan's version of citizen identification.

(which is the whole point.) but this means that it takes longer to get results and it's a more complicated process and requires more overhead (ie, they have to pay more people to handle this process.) banks/loan officers/etc say, wait, its gonna take how long? you're gonna *charge us*? ...nah, we don't need it, it's fine. #yolo<br>- this is a REAL THING that i am likely misremembering details of and couldnt find references for; dont worry about it (i tell myself, while worrying about it). this is fiction, yo.</p>\n<p><b>misc:</b><br>- people are legit referring to me as 'format god' for some reason and i think this is hilarous and am half convinced i should put it on a business card<br>- HEY I REMEMBERED WHY I GAVE KOICHI A WHOLE EMAIL ADDRESS it's bc i reused his fake university in this chapter.

would you accept a display: grid?? and then??? not display: grid???? for real tho, what is WRONG with you, i honestly want to know. i spent hours formatting that box thing at the top of the chapter, got it just right, and then ao3 said, 'lol, oh u thought?'<br>- so yes. i took a picture of it. and threw it in there as an image. yes i did.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><b>and now, notes: </b><br>- this chapter was really tricky to write but i think i pulled it off?

NO. YOU FREAKING WOULDN'T HAVE. GOD. I hope no impressionable children were watching your interview, because that sort of mindset is contagious and DAMAGING AF.\n\nAs you can likely already tell, this post will be a departure from my usual format. We will be discussing the difference between \"versatility\" and \"strength\" and why they're the SAME FREAKING THING.\n\n(IF I EVER SEE YOU IRL: LEMILLION, I WILL PUNCH YOU IN YOUR GOSH DARNED PERFECT PACMAN FACE.)\n\n[...]\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSir Nighteye  \n\n\nHawks, I must ask to speak with you concerning the blog post you shared publicly this afternoon. Please call my office at your earliest convenience.\n\n\nYesterday, 20:08\n\n\nAlternatively, if you could be bothered to answer your phone, that would serve my purposes just as well. Thank you.\n\n\nYesterday, 22:09\n\n\n2 unread messages\n\nidk who u thnk i am but this isnt hawks\n\n\n2:43\n \u2713 \nHawks, please. You and I both know that it is.\n\n\n2:48\n\nwho is ths \"hawks\" person nvr heard of them\n\nalso y nt jst rply publicly dude do u nt kno how the internt works\n\n2:50\n \u2713 \nI am painfully aware of how data transfer and storage works on services owned by third-parties, so while I would very much appreciate you answering your phone, if I have no other choice then at least I do not wish to have this conversation in a public setting.\n\n2:51\n\ndont get out much do u\n\nuuuggghhh how r u STILL typng i dont wanna read ur essay\n\n2:53\n \u2713 \nI don't think you understand the potential gravity of this kind of publicly facing information. The blog post in question publicly disclosed concerningly viable ways of bypassing the quirk belonging to my intern, Lemillion, to accomplish the goal of \"punching him in the face\". It was phased lightly as if a joke, but the methods are quite possibly sound. I will require more investigation to know for sure.\n\nThough the content contained on this blog would appear to the untrained eye to be harmless speculation, in the hands someone who would wish harm upon a given hero, these speculations could be weaponized.\n\nIt is possible the author of these posts realizes the potential ramifications of his actions. However, without further proof as to the author's intent, I have no grounds with which to pursue his identity or to enforce that he remove the article on Lemillion. So I ask again;\n\n2:57\n\nwhat makes u thnk i kno anythg i just thought it was funny\n\n2:58\n \u2713 \nYou tweeted a direct link to the post not three hours after it was posted. From the average fan base of the site BEFORE 24 hours ago, you were one among the tens of people following this person's blog before you caused them to \"go viral\", as they say.\n\n2:58\n\nas who say \"the kids\"?? \"as the kids say\"??\n\n2:58\n \u2713 \nHawks, please.\n\n2:59\n\nno nighteye YOU please. pls i need ths im dyng\n\n2:59\n \u2713 \nAre you willing and able to assist me in tracking down the owner of this blog? It would appear that there were several posts of a more personal nature that were available to the public previous to this incident. I have only been able to retrieve but a handful.\n\n3:00\n\nno &amp;no\n\n3:00\n \u2713 \nVery well, then.

It also seems to have your real name, possibly? I didn't look you up or anything so pelase don't worry about that, I just thought you might like to know. Also, you might to remove that information before you get any more popular and more people start looking at that sort of stuff.\n\nMy deepest apologies for kind of accidentally stalking you,\n\nHaimawari Koichi \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is a whois?? how did you get this email?? Are you saying other people can get this email and my real name??\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nYes, that is unfortunately what I'm saying. Do you remember setting up the domain for your blog? When you register a domain, you also have to provide contact information for that domain. It's very common for people to use their real information for this contact information, but it is accessible to anyone who knows where to look.\n\nThis is probably going to sound really creepy, but is XXX-XXX-XXX still your number? That's also included on the whois for your domain.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nI'm sorry I really don't mean to be rude I'm just freaking out because why do you have my mom's cellphone number\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThis might not make you feel better but I promise I'm just a normal college student. I do computers as a hobby, and follow Hawks' Twitter.

Around the same time, QAB started to change the way it presented content; it's now publishing current event articles and has also started up a \"quirk consultation\" series. This seems to have done two things: made QAB controversial, and cemented a die hard fanbase. (As an aside, the quirk consultations are incredibly well done and worth a read, especially for anyone interested in pursuing a career in quirk analysis. Readers vote on a list of submitted quirks and then the writer of QAB posts detailed dissertations on the most popular ones. He's an amateur (amateur as in not classically trained/no accreditation, and he's not shy about admitting that), but the series has been garnering a lot of attention.)\n\nEarlier this week QAB posted a more political piece about media coverage in heroics. The post talks about how heroics is turning into a \"popularity contest\", and turning some heros into \"dangerously unstable megalomaniacs [...] like Endeavor.\" Endeavor's agency very quickly tried to sue on the basis of defamation or libel, but 1, suing an anonymous internet user is no joke, 2, the post isn't against the terms of service for the service provider he uses, and 3, as far as anyone can tell, Endeavor wasn't actually defamed. (Not by any legal definitions, anyway.)\n\nThere's rumors that a SECOND lawsuit was filed against QAB for how the fanbase reacted to the first lawsuit, but I haven't seen any solid proof of that.\n\nCurrently, it's a full-blown Twitter war. Even some of my IRL coworkers have strong opinions about what is ultimately one anonymous guy on the internet publicly publishing his political views... just like everyone on Twitter is doing already. Someone with more of a sociology background might be able to tell you why the article has been so polarizing.\n\nedit: a word\n\n\n 1shadow1 4h \n\nI am once again glad I don't have a twitter\n\nMayhap_Mishap 4h  \n&gt; \"sue on the basis of defamation or slander\" \nQAB is being sued for libel, not slander. Slander is oral, libel is written. (But otherwise, 10/10)\n\n HVCmelody 3h \n\nTIL. Thanks!\n\n\n3 more replies\n ANMBR  3h  \nEndeavor's people have been really aggressive about getting in front of any potential bad press ever since he failed to bring down Stain back in May. I think that's part of the reason things got so out of control.\n\n\n noburo 2h \n\nI think people got worked up because ANN keeps running stories about how similar Stain and Shuttai (founder of QAB) are. They do seem to have some similar thoughts on the current state of hero society, but Stain is out on the streets stabbing people and Shuttai is giving away free quirk consultations.\n\n fullofsinewaves 4h  \nhawks_unofficial also made a series of tweets that seem to be in direct response to this.\n\n ItsudemoDoutei 4h \n\nHawks is the embodiment of a troll tho\n\n\n5w4nn 4h  \nHawks response was really enlightening, from the perspective of someone outside of the heroics industry. He seemed to sort of (respectfully) disagree with Shuttai? Considering how much he helped push QAB to where it is today, I would have expected Hawks to either back Shuttai or disavow him entirely.\n\n\nSee replies\n\n\nVIEW ALL 672 COMMENTS\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConcerning the Lawsuit\n by Shuttai on July 05, 20X4 \n\nHey everyone! I apologize that this isn't the quirk analysis you were expecting. Instead, I wanted to address the recent rumors and set the record straight before things can get even more ridiculous.\n\nDid Endeavor sue you?\nEndeavor's publicity team tried to threaten me with a lawsuit. This was done in an effort to intimidate me into removing an article I posted early last week. They believed the article did not frame Endeavor in \"an accurate or publicly respectable manner\", which I think was their way of accusing me of defamation. (You've probably read the offending post already, given that you're reading this. But in case you missed it, here it is.)\n\nIt is my suspicion that Endeavor's publicity team did not, in fact, read the article they tried to sue me over, as the lines they took issue with were taken out of context. The lawsuit (or rather, the empty threat of a lawsuit) has subsequently been dropped.\n\nDo you have a personal grudge against Endeavor?\nEndeavor has done a lot for Japan, and many grateful people owe him their lives. Again, if you've read the original post, I think you'll see that my criticisms are against the current structure of the hero industry, NOT directly against Endeavor.\n\nRegarding Hawks\nHawks and I are not fighting, and we don't hate each other. I don't know why people keep asking about this. I don't even know Hawks! To be honest, I'd be too embarrassed to try to talk to him, even over the internet. He's so famous?? He's?? So cool?? I'm pretty sure the one time he allegedly read my blog was just a fluke. I'm sure someone like him is much too busy for the ramblings of an amateur quirk enthusiast.\n\nIn the off chance his recent tweet wasn't just a mistake or a joke, then I am honored he read my post and I respect his opinion! He's given me a lot to think about. My personal perspective is one from the outside looking in. I, like many of you, live in a world where every decision the Hero Public Safety Commission makes can affect my daily life and well-being, and as such I have opinions about how they operate. But I am in no way a professional in the hero industry.\n\nAnd on the topic of other's opinions, please keep in mind that everyone is entitled to their own! We are all walking through life using a different lens of upbringing and experience. We all have different opinions and ideas on what we think is the right way to change the world. In the end, I believe the melding of those ideas is what will give us the power to shape our collective future for the better.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nShoe Size Revealed?! Mt.

One of the students possessed a locating quirk and used it to help the little girl find her mother. Some public concerns were raised over the illegal quirk usage, and when we reached out to the Ikebukuro city police station, the police chief issued the following statement:\n\n\"The students [...] did use their quirks but the quirk usage was not publicly visible nor did the illegal usage lead to additional crimes. There are no charges being pressed at this time.

This entire article is very well articulated, not to mention beautifully written, and I know All Might himself would shed a tear at the way you portray him. It's always astounding, the amount of impact people can have on each other.\n\nGiven how many comments there are already I'm unsure if you'll see this. But in the case that you do, I wanted to let you know that I found this to be an incredibly thoughtful take on hero society as a whole. You've given me a lot to consider. As a veteran of the industry, it gives me hope that there are young people like you ready to take the reigns.\n\n\nShuttai\nJuly 23, 20X4, 16:12\nOh my gosh, thank you so much!!

The problem isn't quirkless discrimination; it's quirk discrimination.\n\nIt use to be leagues more difficult to get a job with a \"villainous\" quirk than with no quirk at all. Up until (relatively) recently, that was still very much the case. And then, about 30 years back, the government changed the way Kojin Bangou[1] were assigned to counter rampant identity fraud.\n\nIn the last 5-10 years as the people with the fraud-proof Kojin Bangou started to enter the workforce, the unfortunate trend of \"quirk fronting\" emerged. In direct response to this, an overwhelming number of individuals with \"villainous\" quirks started identifying as quirkless. Under the old Kojin Bangou system, (or even before the Medical Privacy act,) quirkless status was easy to verify. Under the new governance, verification can take up to three months. And that's not even taking into account the new fees and restrictions with Kojin Bangou related requests.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that employers don't want to hire someone with a \"villainous\" quirk, and if you say you're quirkless they assume you're lying. There's a much higher population of people with \"villainous\" quirks than people who are \"quirkless\", and to this day there's still a lot of quirk fraud happening.\n\nedit: For those of you looking for more info, look up the Sugihara vs Softbank case. The ruling on that case has made it near impossible to hold employers accountable for quirk/quirkless discrimination.\n\n\n  soho2025  2h \n\nYou can inversely lie about having a quirk/fake a different quirk but that's grounds for immediate termination and a fine. Sometimes it's worth it though (speaking from personal experience)\n\n CloudedThoughts 2h  \nI don't know where you're located, but not in Tokyo it's not. If you're caught, you get entered into an internal database all major companies in Japan (and the majority of companies in Tokyo/Osaka) pull from. On the other hand, if you're working for a small, privately owned business, it's real easy to get away with saying you have something that's harder to verify, like an analysis quirk.

I should have known it was coming, I should have reacted faster, been less stupid, but I wasn't and it turned out fine anyway. But what if it hadn't? What if that hero hadn't been there? I've always been a kind of anxious person, but never like this. I can't eat, I can't sleep, My chest hurts, and I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack.

I was stalked for almost 6 months and spend most of that time telling myself it was all in my head. Some really bad things happened because of it, and I spent a long time thinking that if only I had noticed or behaved differently or talked to someone sooner, I could have prevented it. I felt like it was it was my fault. It wasn't. This isn't your fault.\n\nThe best thing I could do for myself was accept that it happened, that it sucked, try to learn from the experience, and to move on.

Public Faith in the Hero Commission on the Decline?!  \nBY HARA MARI\n\nLast Sunday, the feared Hero Killer: Stain attacked a top ranking hero in broad daylight. Witnesses say it was a harrowing experience, but we talked to the hero in question in an EXCLUSIVE interview. The Wing Hero: Hawks, famous for his unbeatable speeds and his spotless rescue record, says the encounter wasn't \"[...] that big of a deal.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't really say I was afaid for my life,\" Hawks told us after the murder attempt. \"But man! That Stain fellow is a slippery guy, huh?\"\n\nWhile we're glad Hawks seems to be doing well following this harrowing experience, the same cannot be said for Onemu Shinya, who lost an arm in her recent encounter with Stain.

Votes for measure approval fell 20.5 percent short of the simple majority needed.\n\nThe failure of this measure to pass is largely attributed to UAs overall failure to secure their own campus and assure the safety of their students and staff during off-campus activities. A second vote will be taken in December. If approved, students currently attending UA would be required to use the new boarding system in order to remain enrolled.\n\nAccording to various third party reports, the Principal of UA High is still pursuing construction companies for quotes on a large scale addition to the school campus, but declined to comment. Though there is speculation that UA plans to continue pushing for dormitory housing, these construction inquiries could also be related to the USJ building, which has been operating at 50% capacity since the League of Villains attack in April of this year.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Kaminari Denki\nThurs, Aug 19 \u2022 20:10\n\n\nDo you want to train together this weekend?\n\n\nSorry, I can't!!\n\nDo you know Blood?

Does this sub have an opinion?\n\nHis content looks super promising, especially the quirk studies stuff. But one of my big hang ups is that I prefer text articles so I can read on the train and on breaks at work, and he seems to be most active on youtube.\n\n\n 200    22\n\n22 Comments sorted by Best \nLogin or sign up to leave a comment\n\n 5w4nn  3h  \nThere's a lot of QAB clones out there, but in my opinion Prelude is next level. His takes are unique and his analyses are solid.

Though he may not appreciate or acknowledge it, we may very well have saved his life. Because of the community you fostered, because you taught people to help out where they can and stand up for themselves, because you stepped up and took charge of the mission itself, we were able to remove someone from a dangerous situation. We absolutely couldn't have done it without you. \nAnd because the student in question would be too prideful to say it, I'll say it for him. \nThank you.\n\nShuttai Today at 12:50\nI like to think it all would have worked out somehow but I'm incredibly glad I could help! \nI couldn't just ignore someone in need if there was a chance we could do something. I'm so glad it worked out and that your classmate is back home safe.\n\nShouto Today at 12:57\nNone the less \nThank you again, Shuttai-san.
