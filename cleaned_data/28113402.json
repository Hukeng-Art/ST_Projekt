    "text": "The only thing Dabi remembered when he woke up in some back alley dumpster, head spinning and skin half melted off his body, was a handful of names and a few brief flashes of fire.\nNot that any of those memories were helpful\u2014he quickly (and painfully) discovered the blue flames that were his quirk, flickering over his hand for no more than a few moments before his what little of his skin that was unmarred began to turn an angry red.\nSo not only did he have a flame quirk that burned him because his body ran too cold, but it also rendered the memories of flames useless in figuring out who he was. Fantastic.\nThe names? Shou, Yumi, Nat, and Kei weren\u2019t much to work with.\nAs soon as he\u2019d checked himself out of the underground clinic that\u2019d helped him staple his face on (and while Dabi might not remember shit, he knew that was  super  weird), he began trying to figure out who he was, amnesia be damned.\nHe kept a list of what he knew about himself in his pocket.\nAdmittedly, most of what he had beyond basic descriptors was speculation, but it was  something. \nWith no legal documentation to his still unknown name, Dabi didn\u2019t have many avenues in life to go. So for the next six or seven years, his main source of income was nothing but petty crime and odd jobs around his neighborhood for the employers who didn\u2019t care about the random teen-twenty-something-year-old not having any form of ID.\nHis main (only) hobby and pastime was fondly referred to as  The Ongoing Investigation Into Who The Fuck Am I? \nHe was almost on a given name basis with the librarians at the public library a half-hour walk from his dingy apartment. It was nice of them to clarify to the rare hero that bothered to patrol the area that no, despite his appearance  (and didn\u2019t that sting?),  he was not a villain. He often went over to research new leads or reference a psychology book to figure out whether one of his weird, unexplained habits could mean something.\nThe way looking at his white hair in the mirror made him tense to the point where he just dyed it red, only to feel on the verge of tears when he looked at it, and then dyed it black? Had people with red or white hair hurt him before? He had no reason he could  remember  to hate the colors, so he wrote it down.\nThe way he flinched and hunched in on himself whenever someone raised their voice unexpectedly? Concerning. He wrote it down.\nThe time he realized that he couldn\u2019t remember anything more than a few months ago that clearly?  Brain damage, most likely. \nSo not only did Dabi have severe amnesia, he also had some sort of problem with his long term memory that he couldn\u2019t figure out the cause of. Did the issue stem from physical or psychological trauma? How did he get covered in severe burns on over half his body, despite the fact that he  had  to have known how much it hurt his body?  (Was the amnesia caused by an incident that gave him a force activated quirk? It would certainly explain a lot) \nIt\u2019d be nice to not be a walking poster boy for health issues, both physical and mental, but Dabi did his best.\nAfter realizing the growing extent of his memory issues, Dabi switched from just keeping a list of general notes in his pocket to some of those fancy 3-inch binders full of notes, leads, and theories that he had to lug around in a bulky messenger bag.\nHe was rather proud of himself for keeping the table of contents and index so well organized.\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d Shigaraki interrupted. \u201cYou can\u2019t even do what that crazy high school girl was able to do.\u201d\n God,  Dabi thought,  I\u2019d hope not. I have enough mental issues already, I don\u2019t need whatever\u2019s going on with her. \n\u201cGive your name first,\u201d the handy-man continued  (he literally had a severed hand as some sort of face mask what the fuck he thought that news report was exaggerated).  \u201cYou\u2019re an adult, right?\u201d\n\u201cI currently go by Dabi,\u201d he answered, smoothly stepping around the question of his age after years of experience because  fuck he probably was? He looked like an adult, but it\u2019s not like he had facial hair or anything to judge off of because he wasn\u2019t growing any of that any time soon, what if he had just been a really tall ten-year-old? He could barely remember what he was doing in February, but he was pretty sure he was at the end of puberty when he washed up on the streets but he might be remembering wrong oh fuck- \n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want to know,\u201d Shigaraki snapped, uncaring and unaware of Dabi\u2019s panicking internal monologue. It was times like that that he was glad his face was fucked up\u2014it was easy to school your expression when it hurt to change, to begin with. \u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d\n\n And isn\u2019t that the million yen question? \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s time,\u201d Dabi said instead. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued, ready to move on from the question, \u201cI will carry out the Hero Killer\u2019s will.\u201d\nThat changed the topic of conversation pretty effectively.\nApparently, becoming one of Japan\u2019s most wanted villains was an  excellent  way to get the entire internet in theorizing your real identity as well, Dabi was thrilled to discover. He couldn\u2019t figure out why he hadn\u2019t thought of it sooner.\nSeven years of chasing leads and hacking databases to no avail, and he\u2019d absolutely ran out of ideas. The internet, on the other hand, was an endless pool of new theories.\nEver since joining the League of Villains, Dabi had been enjoying something of a lifestyle boost. Now, it wasn\u2019t all comfort, but say what you would about All for One getting captured, the man had left  bank  behind.\nDabi now had a laptop of his own to do his research on, which was mostly a relief due to the fact that he kept popping staples in his wrist when he took notes by hand. Most of his days were spent in the corner of their hideout, dutifully ignoring whatever antics the rest of the League managed to get themselves into each day.\nHis heart went out for Kurogiri each time he saw the man glance consideringly towards the hard alcohol.\n\n \u201c... The government has been known to cover up unethical experiments in the past, especially ones including children\u2014since the first appearance of quirks, secret government training, and experimental facilities have existed to test the limits of powerful quirks. Dabi has been seen to wield powerful blue flames, easily pulling off feats of both quirk and physical prowess that should be considered impossible to pull off if he had begun a sort of training regime at a normal age\u2014let\u2019s say around twelve.\u201d \n\nDabi\u2019s lips quirked as he listened to the theory video, hands briefly pausing their constant typing as the voice in his ear kept talking. He turned up the volume of his headphones, clicking over to the tab to check the sources in the video description.\n\n \u201cGoing by what normal physical features we can make out on the few close up photos and videos we have of Dabi, I would say that it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019s older than his late twenties, yet his movements and instincts and quirk abilities speak of experience of almost that many years, supporting the possibility that Dabi could be from one of these experiment or training facilities.\u201d \n\nDabi paused as the information registered.\nGovernment experiment?\nHis first instinct was to brush off the notion as ridiculous, but his second train of thought was  what if? \nDabi had no clue what the fuck was up with himself, he couldn\u2019t brush off anything.\nIt was true that he did have an odd sort of muscle memory for how to use his quirk offensively and how to fight, on an almost instinctual level\u2014years of government training?\u2014and that he had an unnatural pain tolerance\u2014experiments without anesthesia?\u2014and that he couldn\u2019t remember shit\u2014memory quirk from a shady government official trying to keep information from leaking?\u2014and he woke up in a back alley\u2014getting rid of the physical evidence by posing it as murder?\u2014and  fuck was he a government experiment?\nDabi held his head in his hands while the voice droned on in his ear as the information registered. Was he a government guinea pig? A lab rat? Did he even have parents? Oh god, what if he didn\u2019t even have a  name,  what if he was just listed in a folder somewhere  as nothing more than a number, fuck- \nDabi spent the next three days trying to figure out whether he should just find a way to call the government and ask, before realizing that if he was an escaped government experiment or something then they wouldn\u2019t just  tell that  to some random stranger on the phone, but he still kind of wanted to try.\nHe put down  \u201descaped government experiment???\u201d  on his list of  Potential identities/reasons why I\u2019m like this. \nDabi knew Hawks was a spy. It was pretty goddamn obvious, the hero wasn\u2019t subtle.\nHe asked too many probing questions about the rest of the league members and seemed a little  too  willing to do whatever Dabi asked of him, a little  too  casual and friendly. Dabi couldn\u2019t explain why the way Hawks acted twisted something in his gut, but it seemed  fake  and  wrong,  and he couldn\u2019t figure out why.\nFor a bird, Hawks was a pretty obvious mole.\nBut, Dabi reasoned, a mole that he could use.\nIt was easy enough to reason that Hawks\u2019 purpose was to figure out information on the members of the League, identities, histories, and psych profiles. Dabi felt relatively few qualms about letting Hawks weasel the information out of him; it wasn\u2019t anything you couldn\u2019t find on the internet or in a police database.\nNo, the reason Dabi continued to encourage Hawks\u2019 probing behavior was because Hawks was smart, and had the resources to conduct an investigation into who Dabi could be that the fire user himself could only dream of.\nYou didn\u2019t get to be the number two hero at 22 years of age just by running around and stopping crime, no, Hawks\u2019 agency was well known for its investigative prowess, and that was  precisely  what Dabi was betting on.\nHe let Hawks into the League, hoping the extended exposure would help Hawks figure out who he was because goddamnit, he was getting  desperate. \nIt didn\u2019t take long at all for conversations about Dabi specifically to come up in their meetings.\n\u201cYou ever seen those conspiracy theory videos about you?\u201d Hawks asked casually one evening.\nDabi gave an amused huff. \u201cPractically all I watch, not gonna lie. I like them.\u201d\n\u201cAny of them right?\u201d\nDabi smirked and shrugged, and Hawks gave a good-natured chuckle in response, not realizing that Dabi was quite literal in the implied meaning of  I have no fucking idea. \n\u201cYou seen the one the hero kids made about you?\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Dabi asked, glancing at him. Hawks looked over and gave him an amused grin.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re aware of class 1-A, the one you guys attack like every other week?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t lump me in Handy McFuck-Face\u2019s obsessions, it\u2019s insulting.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d Dabi flicked a small burst of flame at the hero in retaliation, who simply smirked and ducked out of the way as he continued talking. \u201cTodoroki Shouto and Kaminari Denki started a conspiracy theory channel together, and they made a video about you being the Zodiac Killer.\u201d\nDabi had to stop and think about it for a second. \u201cIsn\u2019t the Zodiac Killer some American serial killer from like\u2014the  pre-quirk  era?\u201d\n\u201cDude had to have died centuries ago unless he had some sort of longevity quirk from before the first registered quirk, and your quirk is  blue flames,  I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d\n\u201cThat aside, they think  I\u2019m  the  Zodiac Killer?\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d\nDabi paused, staring at Hawks through narrowed eyes.\n\u201c...Show me.\u201d\nHawks beamed and whipped out his phone, taking no more than a few moments to pull up the video and hold it between himself and Dabi, who leaned over to watch the screen.\nThere was something about the Todoroki kid that just tugged at something in the back of his head, but he brushed it off easy enough. Probably the hair, he remembered the notes he had on the shit reactions he\u2019d had to his own when it was those colors.\nThe tug in his mind was quickly forgotten when Todoroki and Kaminari started putting up all their evidence on a corkboard, using  honest to god red yarn  to connect all their points together and-\nHoly shit. They had a point. Fuck.\n\n \u201c... It\u2019s well known that Dabi\u2019s quirk is powerful blue flames, yet it is also known that he joined the League of Villains, who were previously sponsored by the supervillain known as All for One before his capture during the Kamino Ward Incident several months ago. Connecting all the ties that link Dabi to the Zodiac Killer, as well as the behavioral ticks that could also link them, it would not be far-fetched to assume that Dabi might have some sort of longevity quirk.\u201d \n\nDabi was reeling as Kaminari picked up where Todoroki left off.\n\n \u201cHe has some hella nasty scars, ones that after asking Recovery Girl, shouldn\u2019t have been survivable assuming they were all received at the same time-\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-which it is relevant to presume since all seem to be of the same severity, in the same state of healing-\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-if you can call it that, have you seen the man?\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-and their relatively uniform manner.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYeah, he had to have gotten fucked up like that all at once right? Can you imagine surviving something like that? It\u2019s clear he didn\u2019t go to a hospital, since one of them probably would have reported getting a patient with that distinct a physical trait by now to help in the police investigation, so clearly, either Dabi has some sorta fucked up turtle quirk that gives him his weird-ass skin and longevity-\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-or his original quirk was purely a longevity or immortality quirk, allowing him to survive his severe injuries long enough to join with the League of Villains, and potentially receive his famous blue flame quirk from All for One himself.\u201d \n\n Fuck,  Dabi thought.  Do I have a longevity quirk? I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve had blue flames since long before I joined the League, but I can\u2019t remember shit. \nIt took him a few moments to notice the video had ended, and that Hawks was staring at him expectantly.\n\u201cSo?\u201d the bird prodded. \u201cWhatcha think?\u201d\n\u201cFuck man, maybe I am the Zodiac Killer.\u201d\nDabi tried to not let the frustrated aura Hawks gave off at the answer reflect on his own face.\nHe really hoped Hawks was as clever as he heard because  he was so good at keeping his identity a secret that even he didn\u2019t know who the fuck he was. \nDabi was at the end of his fucking rope.\nHe\u2019d hoped that after almost half a year of being a high profile villain,  someone  would have figured it out, and don\u2019t get him wrong, a few of them had some pretty convincing evidence (maybe he was an escaped Canadian convict who\u2019d escaped 60 years ago, he didn\u2019t fucking know), but of none of them felt quite  right. \nHe was steadily approaching his third night of no sleep, surviving on nothing but desperation and monster energy drinks as he stared blankly at his lists of theories that he hadn\u2019t ruled out.\n -government experiment?    -noumu?    -zodiac killer?    -demon summoned from hell? \nFuck, he needed another energy drink. Or caffeine pills. 5-hour energy.\nHe stumbled into the main room of the base, barely managing to catch himself on the edge of a table when he tripped over his own feet and  fucking ow, he was gonna have to redo that staple in the morning. \nDabi looked up and made eye contact with Shigaraki, who had likely looked over at the sudden noise.\nThey stared at each other, and it took almost a full ten seconds for Dabi\u2019s sluggish mind to realize that he was the one who usually looked away first, and he was about to when a thought lodged in his mind.\n\n Shigaraki would probably be able to confirm or deny the noumu theory, at the very least. \n\nDabi was pretty sure someone would have mentioned it if he  was  a noumu, and he\u2019s pretty sure that he joined the League at some point, but maybe he just imagined that? Could he ask Toga instead? Dabi thought she might\u2019ve been there so maybe he could ask her?\nBut Shigaraki was right there, and Dabi was running out of patience for his almost decade-long investigation.\nHe also simultaneously realized that he and Shigaraki had been staring at each other for almost a minute, and he reminded himself to blink.\nFuck it.\n\u201cOkay, just to be sure, I\u2019m not a noumu, right?\u201d\nTomura sometimes wondered what he was willing to put up with, and he was fairly sure it  wasn\u2019t fucking this. \nDabi had stumbled into the main room, and Tomura had looked over, fully ready to mock the asshole of a Frankenstein\u2019s monster. And then he thought to himself,  Dabi looks like shit. \nThat\u2019s not to say Dabi didn\u2019t  always  look like shit, but he usually looked more aesthetically like shit, if that were a thing. His casual grace was also gone, and Tomura wanted to bark a laugh as he watched Dabi trip over his own feet.\nThen they caught each other\u2019s gazes, and Dabi just  stared. \nTomura didn\u2019t exactly look away either, but it became clear after a few seconds that Dabi wasn\u2019t going to look away and Tomura refused to look away first.\nTheir staring contest carried on for almost a minute, and he could feel his eyes watering painfully from being held open for too long, when Dabi blinked lethargically, almost like a cat. Tomura was glad to give his own eyes relief, and was about to ask what the fuck was wrong with Dabi when the burnt Sasuke started talking.\nAnd Tomura could never stress it enough, nothing could have ever prepared him for the conversation he was about to get into.\n\u201cOkay, just to be sure, I\u2019m not a noumu, right?\u201d\nTomura stopped, stared, processed the question, and felt his brain glitch like a fucking Bethesda game.\n\u201cI-\u201d he cut himself off, trying to figure out if Dabi was fucking with him or not, and looking at the man, Tomura felt frustration when he couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2014no? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not? Why the fuck are  you  asking  me?\u201d \nAnd at that question, Dabi lets out an exhausted sigh as he begins to cross the room, and it was probably the most expressive sound Tomura had ever heard from him. Throwing himself down on the other side of the coffee table, picking a sluggishly bleeding staple from his ankle as he sat down, and looked at Tomura tiredly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried figuring this out on my own but I fucking give up,\u201d he grumbled before continuing. \u201cAlright, all cards on the table here,\u201d Dabi says, holding his hands up in a show of peace as Tomura raises an irritated eyebrow, \u201cmy memory is pretty fucked up.\u201d And in hindsight, not leaving when Dabi said that was probably when Tomura passed the point of no return. \u201cProbably has something to do with all the burns. Plus the heat stroke, which I assume must\u2019ve happened at some point.\u201d\n Yeah, that adds up,  Tomura thought, glancing at the bloody staple Dabi was fiddling with. Not for the first time, Tomura idly wondered how the fuck Dabi was still alive as the man kept talking.\n\u201cAnyways, basically I have no idea who the fuck I was or what I was doing any more than eight years ago, and like, honestly even a few months back is stretching it. I can remember things starting from eight years ago, albeit super unreliably, but anything further than eight years ago? Fucking blank. Been trying to figure this shit out for years. But I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on stuff online to see if anyone else figures it out, and there was a  really  convincing video about me being a noumu. It didn\u2019t  sound  right, but I wanted to check. You\u2019re sure it\u2019s wrong though, right?\u201d\nAnd Tomura has to take a minute to process that confession. He\u2019d always just thought Dabi was trying to be edgy and mysterious, but he actually had no idea who the fuck he was, and as Tomura looked back on all his past interactions with Dabi, the concluding thought came to him unbidden,  yeah, that checks out. \nTomura briefly entertained the idea of telling Dabi to fuck off and figure it out on his own time.\nBut on the other hand, the entire situation sounded like a shit show waiting to happen, and if there was anything Tomura enjoyed doing outside of playing video games, it was laughing at the suffering of other people. Bonus points if that person would finally be Dabi.\nFuck it, Tomura didn\u2019t have any plans for his evening anyway.\n\u201c...Show me the video.\u201d\nDabi  runs  to fetch his computer, and Tomura finds himself vaguely disturbed by the fact that he seems almost eager to show the video to him, like some sort of patchwork puppy.\nBut then whatever conspiracy theory Dabi had found himself enamored with started playing and-\nFuck.\nThat made\u2026 far too much sense.\nTomura was fairly sure that Sensei would have told him if Dabi was a noumu, but he was right, it  was  convincing.\nAs the video ended, sources flashing across the screen, Tomura turned in his seat to stare consideringly at Dabi, who stared right back at him. After a moment, Tomura broke the silence.\n \u201cAre  you a noumu?\u201d he asked, a bewildered note to his voice, because he\u2019d thought Dabi was on drugs or something before, but now as he looked at him, he couldn't stop the pervasive thought of  noumu  rocketing around his head.\n \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know,\u201d  Dabi whispered in the most defeated tone Tomura had ever heard.\n\u201cGive me a second,\u201d Tomura muttered, fishing his phone out of his pocket and pulling up his contacts list. \u201cI can figure this out.\u201d Quickly scrolling through the relatively short list, he clicked on that one succinctly titled  Dr. Ujiko  and held his phone up to his ear, pinky curled into his palm as he listened to his phone ring.\n\n\u201cAh, hel-\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Dabi a noumu?\u201d Tomura interrupted the greeting, deciding to get straight to the point.\n\u201cI-\u201d The doctor cut himself off with a confused tone, and as much as Tomura had never liked the man, he could understand the confusion. However, he had less patience than Dabi  (he\u2019d been trying to figure this shit out for almost a decade and he hadn\u2019t lost his shit yet how the fuck-). \n\u201cIs Dabi a noumu, yes or no?\u201d\n\n\u201c...No, Dabi is not a noumu. Why would you think he\u2019s-\u201d\n\n\n Beep. \n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Tomura said blandly, shoving his phone back into his pocket. \u201cThe good news is you\u2019re not a noumu. The bad news is we still have no idea who or what the fuck you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can cross the noumu theory off my list at least.\u201d Dabi sighed tiredly.\n\u201cYou have a  list?\u201d  Tomura asked incredulously. Dabi gave him a blank, unamused look.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out who I am for almost seven years, of  course  I have a fucking list.\u201d\nBut Tomura was invested at this point, and just pointed at Dabi commandingly. \u201cGo get them. We\u2019re leveling up our investigation skills and unlocking your backstory.\u201d\nTomura wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he should be surprised by the piles of thick binders Dabi brought back and dropped on the coffee table, which groaned worryingly under the sudden weight (and the man was a  twig,  he had no idea how he\u2019d carried them without snapping like a glow stick).\n\u201cIs this\u2026 all of it?\u201d he asked slowly, flipping open the binder closest to him and blinking at the tiny font of a  fucking table of contents. \n\u201cPretty much, yeah,\u201d Dabi said, organized the binders into different groups before pointing at them one by one. \u201cThis one is just some general information I\u2019ve been able to figure out about myself. These two are theories and leads that I\u2019ve followed up on and we\u2019re able to confidently rule out. The next two are ones that I\u2019m currently looking into. These three have lists of ideas that I need to start looking into, and there\u2019s a shit ton of them. And finally, these six,\u201d he said pointing to the largest pile of binders, \u201care leads that I haven\u2019t been able to follow up on fully, either because of a lack of resources or just hitting a dead end.\u201d\nTomura simply stared, only able to comprehend the amount of information piled in front of him simply by thinking  I thought Dabi killed a fuck ton of trees at that summer camp, but apparently this is somehow where he\u2019s more effective at tearing down forests. \nTomura took in a deep breath and exhaled.\nStanding up from the ratty couch without a word, he took a few steps up to the large wall on the far side of the bar and brushed his fingers along the surface. He walked from end to end until all the yellowed and torn old posters that used to decorate the surface laid in piles of dust around his feet, leaving the plain wooden wall in his wake.\nTurning around and padding past Dabi\u2019s confused stare and over to the bar, he leaned over the counter and grabbed a knife and marker. Carefully balancing the blade and marker in one hand with decaying them, tore another poster down from another wall in the bar and turned it to the blank side on the coffee table.\nHolding the knife in one hand and pressing down the poster with his wrist, he took the cap off the marker with his teeth and wrote down in large, bold kanji,  WHO THE FUCK IS DABI? \nThen he held the poster up to the center of the recently cleared wall, and stabbed it with the knife, pinning it effectively in place.\nHe turned to Dabi, who was starting to gain some level of comprehension in his eyes at what Tomura was trying to accomplish.\n\u201cStart pulling out your most likely theories, you amnesiatic fuck face,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring this shit out.\u201d\nSpinner really had no idea what he was looking at.\nAll he\u2019d wanted to do was go into the kitchen and grab a snack to eat before turning in for the night, and instead, he walked in on Shigaraki and Dabi having what appeared to be a  civil debate  about whether or not Dabi\u2019s burn scars were from  time traveling? \nMaybe he\u2019d already gone to bed and what he was seeing was just a really weird dream or something.\nHe must\u2019ve made a noise or something because Shigaraki and Dabi snapped their heads around to look at him simultaneously.\nHe gulped nervously under their combined stares.\n\u201cSpinner,\u201d Shigaraki said sharply, and he snapped to attention at his name. \u201cSettle something for us. On a scale of one to ten, how likely is it that Dabi\u2019s some sort of time traveler?\u201d\n\u201cI, uh,\u201d Spinner stuttered. \u201cUm, four?\u201d\nShigaraki cursed softly under his breath.\n\u201cFucking told you,\u201d Dabi said, picking a mug of tea from the coffee table and sipped at it. Shigaraki kicked his shin, to which Dabi only responded by saying, \u201cIf you pop a staple on my leg, you're putting it back in.\u201d\nShigaraki returned his attention to Spinner, who wasn\u2019t exactly eager to be getting glared at by their decay-happy leader again. \u201cSpinner, go fetch the rest of the League. There\u2019s been a change of plans.\u201d\nIt was Hawks\u2019 day off.\nNow, he  said  that it was his day off, but it really only meant that he wasn\u2019t doing any patrols or work at his agency, and would probably end up spending the whole day at the League of Villains hideout.\nTechnically work, Hawks supposed, but over time at least it had become  enjoyable  work. He was reluctant to admit to himself that he\u2019d probably miss their company once he finished his mission and had to break cover to take them down.\nThey were better company than the suits at the Commission by a long shot.\nNow, whatever Hawks had been expecting when he walked into the League hideout at 9 AM, it certainly wasn\u2019t Shigaraki slamming his hands down on the table and yelling a question at Dabi, the rest of the league spread across the couches and chairs, watching intently. A wall that Hawks swore was decorated with posters of trashy old bands last time he\u2019d been there was instead covered with papers, either hung up with push pins or knives, some connected by red yarn.\n\u201cGive us something to fucking work with here, Dabi! Hobbies, interests, skills, anything you can\u2019t explain away!\u201d\n\u201cFuck if I know!\u201d Dabi snapped back, sounding every bit as exasperated and defeated as Shigaraki did annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was a person before all this shit, but I don\u2019t remember a goddamn thing about it.\u201d\nThe League seemed to let out a simultaneous groan at the answer.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dabi! Recovering from any sort of brain trauma is a long journey, so take your time!\u201d Twice chirped. \u201cMaybe if we whack you in the head with a metal bat, all the memories will come back!\u201d\n\u201cWait-\u201d Dabi said suddenly, holding up a hand, appearing to be in deep thought. Noise in the room quieted, and Hawks had a sinking feeling he knew exactly what was going on as he spied the  WHO THE FUCK IS DABI  sign in the center of the wall. Dabi held a hand to his chin, brows furrowing as he thought. \u201cActually I think I used to like soba. Maybe. I also might have never eaten soba before. Honestly fifty-fifty chance,\u201d he said with false cheeriness, giving the group a thumbs up.\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Hawks said softly, but with feeling.\nThe League quieted all at once and turned to look at him. Several seconds of silence passed before Shigaraki broke the quiet.\n\u201cListen, either sit your ass down and help or get the fuck out. We\u2019re not doing anything else until we figure this shit out.\u201d\nHawks felt the sigh he gave out in response somewhere deep in his soul, shutting the door behind himself and shuffling over to an empty chair, grumbling under his breath.\n\u201cWell, this explains why I couldn\u2019t figure out this shit either.\u201d\nSometimes, Shouta wondered if it was really worth ever getting out of bed in the morning. Maybe he should\u2019ve never crawled out of his sleeping bag, just laid there and let the ratty thing become his coffin.\nInstances in which he wondered such a thing tended to happen whenever he had to deal with the League of Villains. Again.\nShigaraki was a manchild who was more difficult to reason with than almost all of his students, Toga was some sort of psychopath, Twice desperately needed a psychotherapist, Compress and Kurogiri were polite but frustrating to deal with and thus Shouta hated them by default, Dabi was a powerful and smug asshole, and Spinner was a cosplayer taking method acting too far.\nSo Shouta wasn\u2019t exactly  thrilled that\u00a0he got into a confrontation with Shigaraki on the weekend when all he had been trying to accomplish was picking up more eye drops.\nThe underground hero in him was steadily becoming more frustrated as the year progressed at the sheer amount of confrontations he was getting forced into in broad daylight, in front of the news cameras. He might as well become a spotlight hero, at that rate.\nNow, the cause of his headache during this particular confrontation, for once, didn\u2019t come from Midoriya\u2019s suicidal self-sacrificing tendencies. No, the problem child was back at the dorms,  not getting pulled into yet another major villain fight. \nIt instead came from the fact that Shigaraki kept leaning in and asking about missing person cases he had worked on in the past\u2014the majority of them ones he and the police had never been able to solve.\n\u201cWhat about Okamoto Shinju? Ever found him?\u201d Shigaraki hissed into his ear as he shot past, barely avoiding the man's outstretched fingers. \u201cNoguchi Kichirou? Yamauchi Misaki? Inoue Riko?\u201d\nShouta growled lowly under his breath, whipping around and focusing his gaze on Shigaraki, thankful that it was only the one League member he had to deal with  (though none of them would have been ideal). \n\u201cWhy are you so interested in cold missing person cases?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Shigaraki intoned, giving a bright smile that looked demented on his face. \u201cSo they\u2019re still cold, hm? That\u2019s very useful information.\u201d\nShouta startled at the statement, not having expected the reaction.  Why did Shigaraki suddenly care about decade-old missing person cases? \nShigaraki suddenly shot away from him, and at the top of his lungs screeched, \u201cIT\u2019S A LEAD!\u201d\nBefore Shouta could even process what on earth  that  statement could possibly mean, a blast of blue flames poured down on Shigaraki, causing the leader to\u2014melt,  not burn. Shouta hissed as he jumped away from the flames, turning his glare to where Dabi was leaning over a nearby rooftop, furious at having been played in such a way.\nOf course it was one of Twice\u2019s doubles. Shigaraki, even childish as he was, usually had a better plan than just running up to him on the sidewalk.\n\u201cThanks, Eraserhead!\u201d Dabi called over the roof, before quickly retreating back and out of Shouta\u2019s line of sight. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a huge help!\u201d\nShouta shot out his capture weapon, quickly grappling to the top of the building he had just spotted Dabi upon, determined to catch him before-\nA few wisps of purple mist floated away in the wind.\nShouta tightened his hands into fists, growling a low  \u201cDammit,\u201d  under his breath.\nHe was too late.\n\u201cCold cases are cold for a reason, you know,\u201d Hawks said dryly, dumping a box of files on the table with a grunt. It\u2019d been a bitch to get his hands on the printed copies of the various cases, but the fact that they were considered cold was useful, in that they had a little less attention paid to them. One quick trip to the photocopier and back and Hawks had officially committed yet another crime.\nHe was vaguely worried about how nonchalant he was becoming about following the law, regardless of the wide parameters he was given on his mission. That was a problem for future him, however.\n\u201cThey\u2019re cold for the police,\u201d Shigaraki said distractedly, already shuffling through the files. Hawks was relieved that he\u2019d taken to taping two of his fingers on each hand unless he was leaving the bar, having accidentally disintegrated more than a few flash drives of potentially useful information. \u201cUnlike them, we don\u2019t have to deal with any red tape or listen to any higher-ups.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re becoming back alley detectives? Like some sort of discount Sherlock Holmes roleplayers?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fucking LARPers, chicken wings. This is a serious investigation.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Hawks said, holding his hands up placatingly. \u201cAlso, if you\u2019re going to insult me, go for something that\u2019s actually there. Call me chicken legs or chicken ankles.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to-\u201d Shigaraki cut himself off as he looked down at where Hawks was pointing, staring at the gap between where his baggy flight pants ended and his boots began.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Spinner commented contemplatively from off the side after a few moments of silence, \u201cnow that you\u2019ve pointed it out I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to unsee it.\u201d\n\u201cDetective Chicken Legs, at your service,\u201d Hawks chirped, saluting sarcastically with a ditzy smile on his face.\n\u201cI fucking hate it here,\u201d Dabi said.\nYuuta didn\u2019t really know how long he\u2019d been stuck in that damp basement.\nHe had a general idea, of course; other prisoners were occasionally tossed into the room with him, and they would tell him what date they estimated it was.\nAt the very least, he\u2019d been there for over eight years.\nIt made sense, of course, that the Yakuza cell he\u2019d been sold to would do well to keep their source of limitless energy from being discovered, but well\u2014it still  hurt  when he realized, around his fourth year, that it was unlikely that anyone would ever come for him. Picked right off the streets in front of Ketsubutsu, and no one could track him down. He finally had his provisional license, and he\u2019d been picked up, just like that.\nHe picked absentmindedly at the brace around his leg that chained him to the wall, a device that endlessly siphoned off the energy that used to crackle off his skin in abundance.\nHe startled at sudden sounds of fighting, muffled through layers of concrete. His hand slipped and his nail caught in a seam of the brace, pulling at an awkward angle that left a dull throb in his fingertip. He straightened up, a traitorous part of his mind flaring up in hope before he crushed it back down.\nYuuta knew that if they hadn\u2019t found him by now, his case was more than likely cold and shelved. They wouldn\u2019t expend more resources on him when there were warmer trails to follow.\nIt was significantly more likely that some rival Yakuza family was starting something.\nOr at least, that\u2019s what Yuuta  thought  until the sounds of fighting began to grow closer. He shifted on his ratty cot nervously\u2014the screams outside his room made the fight sound  very  one-sided, and in the intruders' favor. That small flare of hope kept nudging at the back of his mind.\nWhen the sounds of fighting faded, Yuuta sat tensely, picking at the frayed edges of his thin blanket, mind racing as he tried to figure out what might happen next.\nWhen the wall of his room crumbled into dust before his very eyes, Yuuta only blinked confusedly at what he saw.\nThe group before him certainly had\u2026 a  unique  sense of style, not that Yuuta and his too-big-for-his-emaciated-body clothes were ones to talk.\nBut the one standing at the front of the group with his hand outstretched looked like he had a whole hand kink thing going on, another looked like a discount Frankenstein\u2019s monster, and the last was wearing nothing more than a slightly too big school uniform.\nYuuta wasn\u2019t sure what had changed since he had been kidnapped, but he was fairly sure that interns were meant to be given their real costumes before being taken on fieldwork.\n\u201c\u2018Sup,\u201d the guy with the patchwork face and coat said casually, stepping forward as he pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to be,\u201d he squinted at the paper (Yuuta was struck by the horrific realization that the scars weren\u2019t an aesthetic thing, but were  very real  as he spied the inside of the guy's mouth through the gap between the first and second staple on either side of his mouth as he spoke, and  oh god Yuuta felt sick),  \u201cSerizawa Yuuta, do you?\u201d\n\u201cUh, y-\u201d Yuuta coughed harshly into his elbow, grimacing at the rough scratch of his throat. \u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cAwww, what a letdown,\u201d the school girl whined, waving her arms around angrily, and Yuuta felt the feeling of being sick coming up again as he saw the very much blood-covered knife in her hand. How much more brutal had heroics gotten in eight years? \u201cHe\u2019s not even that cute\u2014he\u2019s so skinny! There\u2019s no blood on his bones!\u201d\nYuuta was fairly sure that the saying was \u201cmeat,\u201d but he didn\u2019t get a chance to ask about the strange turn of phrase before the guy covered in hands groaned loudly and childishly. \u201cThis is a waste of time, I\u2019m gonna call Kurogiri for a pick-up.\u201d\nThe other two intoned a disappointed \u201cYeah,\u201d as they followed him when he stalked away and out of sight, presumably fishing his phone from his pocket.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Yuuta managed to call out, his throat itching at the effort. The group paused briefly and glanced back at him, looking impatient. \u201cI\u2014are you three heroes? You don\u2019t look like part of the Miyashita family\u2026\u201d\nThe guy covered in scars barked out a harsh laugh, waving blandly over his shoulder as the group continued walking away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said in an amused tone before they all disappeared from sight. After a few moments, Yuuta couldn\u2019t hear their footsteps any longer.\nNo more than a few minutes passed before police and heroes flooded the room, and Yuuta allowed his confusion to be washed away by crushing relief as tears pricked at his eyes.\n\u201cRight. Yes, we\u2019re at the location. I\u2019ll text you the coordinates. Alright, thank you,\u201d Atsuhiro said, before pulling his phone away from his face and hanging up. He turned to face Spinner and Twice, who had sat on the grass and started a game of chopsticks in the time it had taken him to call Kurogiri. Allowing himself a smile at this scene, he quickly shot off a text with their coordinates to the bartender before catching his comrades' attention.\n\u201cShigaraki, Dabi, and Toga have finished up their objective. We\u2019ll be joining them back at the base shortly,\u201d he informed them, both looking up at him. \u201cThe police will be here soon, so get ready to move. Kurogiri will be sending a portal momentarily.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Spinner said easily, standing up in tandem with Twice. \u201cSo, uh, they\u2019re taking care of\u2026\u201d he gestured weakly at the pit next to them, a stale, vaguely nauseating scent rising from its depths.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be taking care of the body, yes,\u201d Atsuhiro confirmed, glancing at the skeleton still slightly buried at the bottom of the hole. \u201cWe\u2019ll allow the police to run DNA analysis on whether or not this is Itou Ryouta. Hawks will be able to tell us the results before it's even on the news.\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\n\u201cRelax!\u201d Twice chirped, patting Spinner on the back. \u201cEither we still have a lead on who Dabi is or we\u2019ve helped a family find closure! Either way, there\u2019s a silver lining to this! This entire situation is a fucking waste of time!\u201d\n\u201cI still think Toga would have been a better choice for this kind of thing,\u201d Spinner muttered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Atsuhiro said noncommittally, \u201cbut she was getting stabby, so we decided to handle that efficiently while we could.\u201d\n\u201cI guess.\u201d\nAtsuhiro was pleased to see the familiar purple mist of Kurogiri\u2019s portal appear just a few meters away as police sirens screeched into the park. The police officers who exited the car froze upon spotting the three members of the League, but Atsuhiro did no more than tip his hat and stroll briskly into the portal, Spinner and Twice behind him.\n\u201cBye-bye!\u201d Twice called, and Atsuhiro could almost hear the cheery wave he was giving the officers in his voice. \u201cSee you never, fuckers!\u201d\nLEAGUE OF VILLAINS RESCUE KIDNAPPED HERO STUDENTBy Saitou Masahiko\n\n Serizawa Yuuta was a student in Ketsubutsu Academy\u2019s heroics course, with a brand new provisional license in his pocket when he was kidnapped right off the streets in front of the school. Having a powerful energy quirk, he was sold to the Miyashita Yakuza family and kept in their basement as a source of endless energy to power their bases, operations, and to make a little extra on the side. Serizawa lived in that basement for almost nine years, giving up hope of ever being found, before he was rescued. \n\n Serizawa didn\u2019t recognize the heroes that had dusted the wall of his damp basement room but brushed it off; the face of heroics can certainly change in nine years. Two pros and a work experience intern are what he presumed to have rescued him. He knew that he was not simply found by accident because one of the pros stepped up and asked him to confirm his identity\u2014and Serizawa was relieved. The pro-heroes  had  come for him. \n\n They must have been the advance team, he thought, when they spoke of contacting a \u2018Kurogiri,\u2019 perhaps another pro, for pick up. They went ahead, presumably to rescue other prisoners of the Miyashita. Other pros and police officers soon flooded the room, rushing him to a hospital to be treated for malnutrition and given physical therapy for his atrophied muscles. \n\n\n However, it wasn\u2019t until Serizawa gave his statement to the police that both law enforcement and Serizawa himself realized the truth: he had been reduced by the League of Villains. When he described the \u2018pros\u2019 that reduced him, their descriptions matched perfectly to that of Shigaraki Tomura and Dabi, and their \u2018intern\u2019 to that of Toga Himiko. When given police sketches to confirm for certain the identities of those who found him, Serizawa said yes\u2014those were the people that had taken down an entire yakuza cell to find him. \n\n\n Read more \n\n\u201cAlright, so,\u201d Shigaraki announced, pacing back and forth to the League, sprawled across the couched of the bar, \u201cwhile we\u2019re waiting for the police to calm the fuck down so Hawks can finally be useful again-\u201d\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d\n\u201c-and get us some more of those cases, we\u2019re going to focus on some of the alternative theories and ruling those out.\u201d Shigaraki threw himself into a chair, looking around at them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be splitting up into groups. Toga, Spinner, you\u2019re working on the Zodiac Killer. Compress and Twice, time travel.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Dabi groaned, letting his head fall back into the couch cushions in exasperation. \u201cWe ruled that one out.\u201d\n\u201cNo,  you  ruled it out. I\u2019m still skeptical.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh my fucking god.\u201d \n\n\u201cDabi, you and Hawks are working on the demon from hell theory. Me and Kurogiri will be making a few house calls to the Yakuza.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, wait,\u201d Hawks said, visor pushed up into his hair as he pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI can suspend my disbelief for a lot of things, but there is no possible way that Dabi is a demon from hell. Hell doesn\u2019t even  exist.\u201d \n\u201cProve it,\u201d Shigaraki responded blankly.\n\u201cI- what?\u201d\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Shigaraki repeated, crossing his arms. \u201cWhile some quirks can have scientific explanations, some don\u2019t. How am I, scientifically, able to decay things with a single touch? How the fuck do Compress and Twice make Conservation of Matter their bitch? How do you control your feathers? For that matter, how does  any  form of telekinesis work?\u201d\n\u201cI, uh,\u201d Hawks stuttered, mind screeching to a halt. \u201cHah?\u201d\n\u201cExactly, you fucking pigeon head. Quirks are some wack-ass shit, so there\u2019s nothing to say hell can\u2019t exist, and that Dabi isn't a demon.\u201d Shigaraki pulled a Bible from out of nowhere and tossed it on the table. \u201cGet to work.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014but-\u201d Hawks blinked and stared down at his hands like he was having an existential crisis, which, Dabi supposed, was fair enough.\nDespite that, Dabi couldn\u2019t keep himself from cackling when Shigaraki huffed angrily, picking the book back up and nailing the hero in the face with it, growling, \u201cRead the fucking Bible, Hawks.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d was all Dabi managed to say once they got all the information laid out in front of them. Shigaraki simply made an odd noise of affirmation, and Hawks only nodded dumbly. \u201cI knew heroes were fucking corrupt but this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hawks agreed softly, looking vaguely sick.\n\u201cOkay, so Shinoda Kei is definitely dead,\u201d Shigaraki said. \u201cOur next question is what the fuck are we supposed to do about heroes taking on black market hits?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno, expose them?\u201d Dabi suggested, shrugging. \u201cTie into that whole \u2018fuck heroes\u2019 thing we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nIt was quite obvious that none of them had slept in the past two days when Shigaraki simply squinted at him for a few moments before understanding dawned across his face. \u201cRight, yeah, that. We\u2019ll get Toga to go drop off the files to a newspaper in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cTomura, Hawks, Dabi,\u201d a strict voice suddenly interrupted. The three of them tensed, before slowly turning around to see Kurogiri standing behind them, arms crossed. He didn\u2019t have a face, but Dabi could  feel  the disappointed stare. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you slept?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hawks started, facing scrunching up in concentration as he started to count on his fingers, talons glinting slightly in the soft light of the bar (Toga had been  thrilled  when they discovered that Hawks had additional avian features, and Dabi would reluctantly admit to being worried for his continued health with Toga\u2019s excitement).\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like\u2026 forty hours?\u201d Shigaraki said, glancing at both of them for confirmation. Dabi and Hawks shrugged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fifty-three, actually,\u201d Kurogiri informed them shortly. \u201cYou three are going to bed,  now.\u201d \nAll three of them groaned in unison, but with a pointed look from the team mom bartender, Shigaraki and Dabi began shuffling towards their rooms.\n\u201cWill you be able to make it back to your apartment safely Hawks?\u201d Unlikely, considering that Fukuoka was an hour flight at the very least from Musutafu.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Hawks hummed, thinking as he swayed on his feet. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\nKurogiri sighed. \u201cDo you know the precise coordinates of your apartment, so I can drop you off?\u201d\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 bird brains can\u2019t even string a sentence together right now,\u201d Dabi muttered, having stopped his mindless shuffle to watch the exchange. Backtracking easily, he grabbed the collar of Hawks\u2019 shirt and began dragging him along. \u201cY\u2019can stay with me tonight.\u201d Hawks squealed in surprise and barely managed to snatch his flight jack off the couch as they went past. \u201cGet Toga to go drop those files at a newspaper or something when she gets up,\u201d he said to Kurogiri as he and Hawks left.\n\u201cBe nice to Hawks, Dabi,\u201d the bartender called to him as they left the main room.\n\u201cDunno what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about,\u201d he responded. \u201c\u2018M a fucking saint.\u201d\nDabi elected to ignore the amused huff he could just barely hear from the man.\nHawks groaned as he blinked his eyes open, having spent the night at his own apartment for the first time in several days. Realizing that it was the jingle of his work phone that was waking him up and that if he was being called so early in the morning that it was most likely the Commission calling, he simply sighed and blindly reached out. Finally grabbing the correct phone after a few attempts, he quickly answered and held the device up to his ear.\n\u201cHello?\u201d he greeted, attempting to sound as awake as he possibly could.\n\u201cHawks,\u201d a clipped voice responded. \u201cAre you aware of what\u2019s on the news right now?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hawks trailed off, racking his brain for anything he\u2019d seen recently that could possibly have pissed the Commission off that could be tied back to him. He couldn\u2019t remember making any mistakes on his patrols recently, and he\u2019d been pretty on point in all of his interviews, sticking to the script and getting in and out before Shigaraki would begin blowing up his phone to get back to base and help out. \u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cWell then,\u201d the voice of his handler turned even icier than usual, if it were possible, \u201cI suggest you check.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, give me a second,\u201d Hawks responded, obediently throwing off the thick comforter of his bed, and  wow it was fucking freezing.  Hawks was harshly reminded of how close winter was as his feathers ruffled at the sudden temperature change, cringing at the unimpressed noise his handler made in response to the noise.\nTrying to avoid making his handler\u2019s mood worse than it already was, Hawks walked along in his little bird hop to avoid any sounds of his talons clacking against the floor. Shifting his work phone to be held between his head and shoulder, he grabbed his personal cell and shifted through his notifications as he padded into his living room. Kurogiri texted him to pick up milk and tea bags before he came over after his next patrol, and Twice had sent a few memes that he didn\u2019t really understand, but obligingly sent back a \u201clmao\u201d regardless.\nHe probably shouldn\u2019t have given the League his personal number, in hindsight, but the burner phone he\u2019d used before didn\u2019t do group chats and Hawks hadn\u2019t slept in a few days at the time. At least it was convenient, ignoring how incriminating it was.\nPicking up the remote to his TV, he flicked it on to the nearest news channel and suddenly understood.\n\n \u201c-pro hero Feedback has come under fire after newly published allegations of accepting, carrying out, and taking payment for a black market assassination contract of sixteen-year-old Shinoda Kei back in 2XXX, who until now has been presumed missing. The newspaper that broke this story cited their whistleblower as the League of Villains, and after police checked their CCTV, were able to confirm-\u201c \n\nHawks switched the channel, not quite able to believe what he was hearing.\n\n \u201c-Feedback has come out denying the allegations against him, however, video footage uncovered while corroborating the information provided by the League is in direct contradiction to his statements. Police have reopened the case of Shinoda Kei, moving the investigation from a missing person investigation to a homicide investigation-\u201d \n\n \u201c-how are we, as a population, supposed to feel that a hero, A: decided to do something like this of his own free will, and B: was able to cover it up for almost nine years without anyone suspecting a thing. We had to be informed of this by the  League of Villains,  and I\u2019m not sure what that says for the accountability of heroes-\u201d \n\n \u201c-new information brought to light by the League of Villains has revealed that pro hero Feed-\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-can easily be convicted of first-degree murder, with this kind of evidence-\u201d \n\n\n \u201c-the situation with Feedback is unprecedented, and how this is dealt with is likely going to have repercussions on society as we know it for decades to come.\u201d \n\nHawks kept flipping through the news stations and would\u2019ve forgotten his handler were he not able to barely make out the man\u2019s breathing. \u201cUh, yeah, okay, I think I know what you\u2019re talking about now,\u201d Hawks said hesitantly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve sent in notices that indicate you\u2019ve been spending more time at their hideout these past two months than you have on patrol, and you failed to notify us of anything like this potentially happening.\u201d It was a statement, not a question, and Hawks barely suppressed a wince. The Commission was  so  not happy with him.\n\u201cUm,\u201d Hawks started hesitantly, trying to figure out how to best navigate the conversation. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t even know they\u2019d sent that information off. I was there when they uncovered it, but I don\u2019t remember anything about them deciding to send it in as an expos\u00e9.\u201d There, that was a relatively safe way to say  \u2018I do remember it happening, however, I had been awake for fifty-three hours on two hours of sleep and by that point, I could taste colors so I wasn\u2019t too sure what had actually happened and what was a hallucination.\u2019 \n\u201cThe Commission expects you to do  better,  Hawks,\u201d his handler told him. He flinched at the cold tone and familiar reprimand, suddenly finding his talons very interesting, avoiding a gaze that wasn\u2019t even there. \u201cWe expect you to better inform us of these events in the future.\u201d\nAnd then all Hawks heard was his dial tone. Hawks numbly pulled the phone away from his ear, simply staring at it in his hand. Well, that could have gone  significantly  better, but it wasn\u2019t the worst possible outcome.\nSighing, he realized that the metaphorical cold bucket of water that was  that  whole situation meant he wasn\u2019t going to be able to crawl back into bed and go to sleep anytime soon.\nDeciding to at least have something interesting to watch (and maybe brighten up the shitty start to the day) as he turned off the TV, he simply tossed his work phone onto the couch while searching for the League group chat in the other. Shooting off a cryptic message, he simply watched and laughed to himself as replies rolled in as he got ready for his day.\ncolonel sandershey\nhey turn on the news\nhand kinkhawks its six thirty in the morning what could possibly warrant you waking me up\ncolonel sandersits funny i promise\nteam momI\u2019m already up, and I have to admit it is quite amusing how effective something the three of you came up with while that sleep deprived worked so efficiently.\nHimiko, please stop changing my username.\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetwait what what did we do\nshes not wrong tho\noh my fuCKING GOD\ncolonel sandersy\u2019all pissed off the commission big time\nthey just called me over this shit\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nugget\u201cy\u2019all\u201d he says, as if he didn\u2019t contribute as much as the rest of us to what happened\ncolonel sandersshut\nhand kinkwhat the fuck are you three talking about\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetlmfao come down and watch the news i gotta see ur reaction to this shit in person\ncolonel sandersfilm it pls\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetdon\u2019t worry i gotchu pretty bird\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himiko\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96usually id find you two flirting adorable but it\u2019s really early\ncolonel sanderswe\u2019re not flirting\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himiko\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96  \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nugget[shiggyshock.mp4]\ncolonel sandersLMFAOOOOOO\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nugget HE LOOKS SO SHOCKED THAT FOR ONCE SOMETHING WORKED IN FAVOR OF HIS GOALS AND IT WASNT EVEN ONE OF HIS DUMBASS PLANS\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himiko\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96wait what\u2019s going on\nDouble Trouble^\nStainStan^\nteam dad^\nHimiko please stop changing me and Kurogiri\u2019s usernames.\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetis she wrong tho\nanyway come and watch the news im loosing my fucking mind\nshiggy\u2019s in shock\nhawks got bitched at by the commission\nmamagiri\u2019s proud\nStainStanngl this lowkey worth being woken up before seven am for\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nugget ikr\ncolonel sandershey can we get a \u201cgood job\u201d from the team leader\nfor our outstanding performance with this stunt\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nugget^\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himiko\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96 ^\nhand kinkno\ncolonel sanders:(\nOchako knew when she woke up that morning, from some foreboding sense in the back of her mind, that something was going to happen. When she heard feet thumping down the hall to the common room, that feeling multiplied.

Most of the class was already in the common room, either lounging on the couch, doing last-minute homework, or getting breakfast. Deku made a beeline for the TV and snatched up the remote. \u201cTurn on the news,  oh my god.\u201d \nTheir classmates made various noises of confusion and asked questions as Deku frantically turned the TV over from the DVD player, but they congregated around the TV regardless, curious of what had gotten him into such a state.\u00a0\nWhen he finally got the TV tuned to a news station, the room went cold, and Ochako finally knew what the foreboding sense she had been feeling all morning was coming from.\n\n \u201c-pro hero Feedback has come under fire after newly published allegations of accepting, carrying out, and taking payment for a black market assassination contract of sixteen-year-old Shinoda Kei back in 2XXX, who until now has been presumed missing.

While Feedback has since been arrested and is currently awaiting trial for his actions, much of the populous has been calling for the government and Hero Public Safety Commission to ensure that such horrific abuse of power does not happen again. \n\n\n Three weeks ago, Representative Shimizu Saburou introduced the Shinoda Bill to the Diet. A preliminary action plan in response to the allegations made against Feedback by the League of Villains\u2014absolutely not where action should stop being taken, he says, but certainly a start to regaining the shaken trust of the public. \n\n\n The bill requires all heroes to publicly release their tax returns, disclosing their sources of income, as well as those of their agencies. All heroes will be expected to incorporate body cameras into their hero costumes before the end of the year, giving them a month and a half to make the change. Additional psychological evaluations and mental health checks are also being required. \n\n The Shinoda Bill was passed yesterday with an overwhelming majority, bringing an end to\u2026  \u00a0  Read more \n\u201cWhere the fuck have you been?\u201d Shigaraki snarled in question as Hawks stumbled into the hideout.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d Dabi added on in wonder, glancing up and down at the  interesting  sweatpants/hoodie/combat boots combination that he\u2019d decided to wear.\n\u201cDealing with the fallout of your shit,\u201d Hawks started, pointing accusingly at Shigaraki. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wear my hero costume around off-duty any more thanks to the whole body camera thing, so Miruko had to drag me out and help me buy a whole wardrobe since I\u2019ve never really worn anything else and overall it\u2019s been a really shitty week so  thanks  for that.\u201d\n\"Body camera thing?\" Dabi asked, confused as to what precisely Hawks was talking about, but was drowned out by Toga and Twice.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you look great!\u201d Twice chirped. \u201cYou look like shit!\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you wear anything cute as a teenager?\u201d Toga asked. \u201cYou always look so nice with your red suits during your interviews! They remind me of blood!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Hawks said in a tone that clearly displayed his displeasure with the topic, \u201cwe\u2019re here to discuss Dabi\u2019s tragic backstory, not mine.\u201d\nKurogiri glanced up at the commotion, took one look at what Hawks was wearing, and sighed long-sufferingly. \u201cGive me your sweatshirt, Hawks. The slits for your wings will fray if not hemmed, and I doubt you know how to sew.\u201d\nHawks groaned, all his feathers detaching and floating around him as he tugged the article of clothing off, placing it in Kurogiri\u2019s expectant hand. His wings quickly reattached themselves.\n\u201cAre you wearing a  fleece halter top?\u201d  Dabi asked incredulously, a cackle rising up in his throat as Hawks\u2019 feathers puffed out in agitation.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d he growled, stalking over to the couch. \u201cShove over, Spinner, I\u2019m freezing.\u201d\nHawks and Spinner had converted one of the couches into a pile of heating pads and electric blankets fairly early into winter, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon to walk into the main room and find the two of them swaddled in blankets, complaining in unison about how they weren\u2019t made for the cold.\n\u201cJust migrate or whatever it is birds do if it's that bad,\u201d Dabi said, sipping his tea with a raised eyebrow. In direct contrast to the two ice cubes across from him, Dabi  reveled  in the cold. His body was every bit made for the winter as it wasn\u2019t for his quirk, and it showed as he kicked his bare feet up onto the coffee table.\n\u201cYou seriously think Shigaraki and Commission aren\u2019t going to bitch at me endlessly for skipping work if I take off like that?\u201d\n\u201cYou better not,\u201d Shigaraki snapped at him as he walked past, taking his place in front of the  WHO THE FUCK IS DABI?  wall. \u201cI\u2019ll dust you no matter where you are if you don\u2019t carry your weight around here.\u201d\n\u201cSee? Just like that.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, here\u2019s the summary of our search for Dabi\u2019s identity as it currently stands,\u201d Shigaraki announced, ignoring Hawks\u2019 comment as he finally started the meeting. \u201cWe've managed to handle most of the possible leads dealing with the yakuza and the quirk trafficking rings, and thanks to Toga\u2019s work in infiltrating various police stations, we\u2019ve managed to confidently rule out Dabi being some sort of new pro who went missing and was covered up. Our current route of investigation is into mysterious disappearances surrounding heroes since that\u2019s apparently more of a thing than we thought it was. We also want to start working on miscellaneous disappearances that have no apparent cause.\u201d\n\u201cI finished looking into all the disappearances in Fukuoka, and my agency has moved on to combing the wider Kyushu region,\u201d Hawks offered, voice sounding muffled through the blankets now wrapped firmly around his body. Dabi entertained the thought of calling him a chicken burrito, but saved the thought for another time. \u201cMiruko\u2019s started investigating Hiroshima and the other prefectures in Chugoku. She\u2019s an independent, so she should be able to move pretty fast.\u201d\n\u201cMiruko?\u201d Dabi asked, looking over at Hawks in surprise. \u201cHow\u2019d you get her in on this?\u201d  Without coming off as hella suspicious  went unsaid.\nThe blanket burrito shifted slightly, and Dabi assumed that the movement translated to a shrug, somehow. \u201cShe\u2019s competitive. I mentioned how the League\u2019s closed more cases in the past few months than almost any agency or hero has in the past year, and she took it as a challenge.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, ooh!\u201d Toga squealed, waving her arms around excitedly. \u201cDoes this mean we might run into Miruko on the job? She\u2019s so pretty! Her outfit\u2019s white, I bet it shows blood super well!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Shigaraki said dismissively, his face clearly showing that he did  not  care. \u201cSince Hawks and his fancy agency and hero friends are taking care of Kyushu and Chugoku, that just leaves Hokkaido, Shikoku, and the rest of Honshu.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s like\u2026 seventy-five percent of Japan,\u201d Spinner said.\n\u201cWith a diligent work ethic, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get through it in no time!\u201d Twice cheered, ever the optimist. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take forever!\u201d\n\u201cThis is certainly quite an undertaking, Tomura,\u201d Kurogiri commented neutrally from the bar.\n\u201cMy life is a nightmare,\u201d Dabi muttered blankly.\n\u201cNah, this is hilarious,\u201d Hawks said, and while he wasn\u2019t explicitly laughing, Dabi  knew  that those weird little chirps he was letting out were pointed at him. \u201cImagine if we go through all this effort and you don\u2019t even have some sort of dramatic background or tragic backstory to justify you being this emo, you\u2019re just a hot topic junkie or something.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking  worse.\u201d \n\u201cHawks,\u201d Compress suddenly interrupted. Dabi and Hawks broke off from their back and forth to look at the magician, who had a contemplative look upon his face. \u201cYou said you were able to coerce Miruko\u2019s help in this investigation, yes?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t like the way you phrased that, but yes.\u201d\n\u201cWould it be at all possible for you to ask other heroes to work on these cases? The more of these that are solved, the less work there will be for us to do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 guess?\u201d Hawks agreed hesitantly, the bundle of blankets wiggling around until his hand emerged from the pile holding his phone up in front of his eyes. \u201cJeanist is usually pretty happy to help me out, so is Edgeshot\u2026 I talk to Uwabami at photo shoots occasionally, she might be willing to listen\u2026\u201d Hawks muttered, scanning through his contacts for a few moments before his arm disappeared back into the blanket and he began speaking. \u201cI can think of some people who might help out, but I know literally nobody from Tohoku or Hokkaido, much less anyone I\u2019m on speaking or asking for favors terms with, so you guys are gonna be pretty on your own there.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Shigaraki starting, redirecting attention to himself, \u201cso while Hawks is busy being the kiss ass that he is-\u201d\n\u201cSee if I ever help you out again.\u201d\n\u201c-we\u2019ll focus ourselves on Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Tokyo. We\u2019ll split into three teams. Dabi and Compress will be taking Tohoku since you\u2019re the only ones who\u2019ll be able to take the cold there and not bitch at me about it every five seconds.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Hokkaido further north, though?\u201d Spinner asked.\n\u201cHokkaido at least has hot springs,\u201d Shigaraki said. \u201cToga, Twice, that\u2019s where you two will be working, though expect that you might be pulled occasionally if there\u2019s a need for reconnaissance or backup from another team.\u201d\n\u201cSpa day!\u201d Toga cheered, high-fiving Twice.\n\u201cThat leaves\u2026 you, me, and Kurogiri to work here then, right?\u201d Spinner said.\n\u201cAstute deduction,\u201d Shigaraki remarked dryly.\n\u201cWhy do you wanna work with me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Dabi almost winced for Spinner, because Shigaraki pulled no punches on how much he despised all of them. \u201cYou\u2019re just here to crawl through the sewers so I don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cGod fucking dammit,\u201d Spinner muttered into his blanket.\nAERY, GENIUS OFFICE, LURKERS, MIRUKO, AND MANY MORE JOIN FORCES IN LARGEST HERO TEAM UP TO DATEBy Fujimoto Aimi\n\n It is well known by now that the League of Villains has taken a peculiar interest in solving missing person cases in the past four months, and the findings and success of their actions have been having ramifications all across the country. Accountability for heroes has skyrocketed, as well as transparency about their actions and incomes, and organized crime rates in Tokyo are at an all-time low. \n\n\n So when the Aery, agency of the No.2 Hero, Hawks, announced a press conference on Wednesday in conjunction with No.3 Hero, Best Jeanist, No.4 Hero, Edgeshot, No.5 Hero, Miruko, No.7 Hero, Kamui Woods, No.10 Hero, Ryuukyuu, and many other top 250 heroes, it was only expected that such an announcement with the presence of so many top heroes would concern the actions of the League. It did, of course; Hawks, the Wing Hero himself, began the conference explaining the ramifications of the League\u2019s actions on a level previously untouched. Vigilantism, and vigilante death rates have been at an all-time high since the success of the League became apparent. While organized crime have plummeted in Tokyo, it has skyrocketed in the Greater Tokyo Region as yakuza and traffickers who evaded capture when found by the League move their base of operations. \n\n\n Then, inviting Best Jeanist, Edgeshot, and Miruko to the podium, the four jointly announced the largest pro hero team up to date, the previous being the team organized to strike in Kamino Ward, when U.A. student Bakugou Katsuki was kidnapped by the League. However, while the Kamino team, made up of U.A. alumni, was only together for a scant few days in the time it took to carry out the operation, the new team-up headed by Hawks, Best Jeanist, Edgeshot, and Miruko, with alumni from the top 4 hero schools and 113 participating pros and their agencies spanning from the Okinawa Islands to Chubu and Kanto, will be part of a what is likely to be a multi-month project. An investigation into cold missing person cases, a show of strength to prove that the heroics industry has improved by leaps and bounds since they were shelved, and that the populous should not have to rely on villains and vigilantes to find their loved ones, or even a sense of safety. \n\nA complex web of agencies and heroes joined together to work in tandem, improving flow of information and backup, trying to track the league and close as many of these cases as possible, Hawks has created\u2026 Read More\nDabi wrinkled his nose at the cold pressure against his scars, Toga sticking her tongue out as she attempted to pat enough foundation onto his face to cover up the wrinkled purple skin.\n\u201cWe done yet?\u201d he asked as she pulled away, tilting her head as she inspected her work. \u201cPretty sure you\u2019ve dumped half that bottle on my face by now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to cover up purple, Dabi,\u201d Toga whined, patting the sponge under his eyes a few more times. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really obvious if I miss a spot or if it wears off, so it\u2019s better to just smother you.\u201d\n\u201cSmothering doesn\u2019t really seem your style,\u201d he said offhandedly, closing his eyes obligingly as the sponge pressed against his lower eyelids. Toga giggled in response.\n\u201cBleeding out is much prettier, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly leaves more of an impact,\u201d he said neutrally. He sneezed as something was sprayed on his face, and was coughing by the time Toga let up on whatever she was spritzing on him. \u201cGive me some warning next time, suffocation isn\u2019t my thing.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, not sounding sorry at all. She was pulling away and looking over him as he opened his eyes again. \u201cAlright, that should be enough. The foundation says that it\u2019s waterproof, but don\u2019t take any chances.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he responded gruffly, rolling up the collar of the turtleneck he\u2019d been stuffed into to hide the parts of his neck that hadn\u2019t been covered up. Toga squinted at him as he completed the action. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou look funny.\u201d\nDabi raised an eyebrow at the response. \u201cI usually look like a rotting eggplant, and me not looking like that is funny?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just-\u201d Toga waved her hands uselessly, mouth twisting as she searched for what she was trying to say. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like Dabi,\u201d she finally came up with after a few moments.\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the point.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean you  look  like someone else. I  know  what people look like, and your entire facial structure looks  different.  You don\u2019t look like  you.\u201d \nDabi blinked slowly at her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following.\u201d\nToga huffed, before taking out her phone and quickly taking a picture of his face, before handing it to him. Dabi took the phone and simply  stared.  Toga, as a certified shapeshifter, had always been particularly sensitive to people\u2019s appearances being out of place, and he\u2019d assumed that she was just overreacting, but actually  seeing  what she was talking about\u2026 yeah, Dabi could see her point.\nHis face was a lot  softer,  more  round  and less  sharp,  with his staples and scars covered. His face held a sort of youthful energy it didn\u2019t have before, with his eternal eyebags weighing down his eyes. He looked like someone completely different.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Toga asked probingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like Dabi, you look like\u2014like\u2014like  not-Dabi!\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I can definitely see what you were talking about now,\u201d Dabi agreed distractedly, still staring at his face.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she muttered, across her arms.\nDabi sighed, racking his brain to figure out how to deal with the situation he was presented with. There were main problems to deal with. The first was that Toga could likely  smell  him as Dabi, but couldn\u2019t  see  him as Dabi, which understandably upset and confused her slightly. The second being that Toga was exceptionally fond of his scars and staples, and not being able to see them was probably half the problem.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d Dabi said slowly, picking his words carefully as Toga looked up at him. \u201cBut me and Compress don\u2019t know the back alleys of Tohoku as well as we do here, so it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t look like ourselves so that we can travel freely. So how about this: if I pull a staple or start bleeding anywhere, I\u2019ll send you pictures, and each night, when I take the makeup off, I\u2019ll send you a picture so you know I\u2019m still me. Sound like a deal?\u201d\nToga sniffed, and after a moment, nodded her head. Dabi gave her a smile and ruffled her hair as he stood up from her bed.\n\u201cMake sure you\u2019ve got everything packed. You can call Kurogiri if you need anything, but it\u2019s probably best to not bother him excessively,\u201d he said, strolling out of her room as she chirped an affirmative.\nStrolling into the main room, he announced, \u201cGuess who\u2019s got a new look, fuckers.\u201d\nCompress, Kurogiri, Spinner, and Hawks, who he didn\u2019t even realize would be there, looked over at him simultaneously. Most of them simply blinked and squinted at him, while Hawks made a strangled sound and inhaled the mouthful of water he\u2019d been trying to drink.\nWhile Spinner thumped Hawks back as the hero tried to cough up his lungs, Kurogiri and Compress simply looked him over appraisingly.\n\u201cYou certainly look\u2026 different,\u201d Compress said after a moment. Dabi rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what Toga said. Anything else?\u201d\nCompress hummed for a second before shrugging his shoulders. \u201cYou look good, Dabi.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Dabi said, tilting his head slightly at the response. Hawks had finally finished hacking up his diaphragm and was looking at him like he\u2019d seen a ghost or something, causing Dabi to raise an eyebrow judgmentally in his direction. \u201cToo sexy for you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what? No, no, that\u2019s not it,\u201d he said, shaking his head and waving his hands around. His wings fluttered slightly with his movements, and Dabi allowed his eyes to follow them for a moment before looking back at Hawks\u2019 face as he got his words in order. \u201cNot that you  don\u2019t  look great, hot stuff, you just reminded me of someone and I  really  wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d\nDabi felt something tug in the back of his mind, like something wasn\u2019t quite right, but, unable to figure out what the problem was, simply narrowed his eyes at the hero before shrugging. \u201cAlright. What\u2019re you doing here, then?\u201d\nHawks shrugged, wings relaxing from their startled position as the topic shifted. \u201cWe\u2019re all gonna be pretty busy for the next month or two, thought I\u2019d see you guys off since flying up to Tohaku or Hokkaido in the middle of winter isn\u2019t my idea of a good time.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but you\u2019d still fly up here to Tokyo to visit lizard lips and hand fuck? I want a divorce,\u201d Dabi snarked, letting himself fall onto the couch across from the furnace that was Hawks' and Spinner\u2019s perch.\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m only coming up here for the food. Kurogiri makes the best yakitori I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cDabi, you\u2019ve finished packing?\u201d Kurogiri asked, interrupting the conversation.\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s mostly just a bunch of turtlenecks and, like, fifty bottles of concealer and foundation. Not much to remember.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t need a coat?\u201d\n\u201cI thrive in the cold. If anybody asks, I\u2019ll just say my quirk\u2019s cold resistance or something. Not too far off the mark.\u201d\n\u201cPlease bring one with you just in case,\u201d Kurogiri said, turning away to head back into the kitchen. \u201cCold resistance does not equal cold-proof.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll toss one in,\u201d Dabi responded, waving him off.\n\u201cOh my god, he sounds just like Tsunagu,\u201d Hawks whispered under his breath after a few moments. At the inquiring looks from both Dabi and Spinner, he clarified. \u201cBest Jeanist. Kurogiri sounds exactly like Best Jeanist, guys,\u201d he said, looking as if he\u2019d just had a revelation.\nDabi felt a mocking smile across his face as he realized the implications. \u201cAre you saying that Best Jeanist  parents  you?\u201d Hawks blinked at him.\n\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d His face scrunched up as he thought. \u201cI suppose that explains why Miruko kept asking me why I didn\u2019t buy him a Best Dad mug for his birthday this year. I was wondering about that.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh my fucking god, Hawks.\u201d \n\nDabi wasn\u2019t really prepared for the astronomically  strange  feeling of walking into a coffee shop and having absolutely  nobody  look at him twice, either because of his scars or his criminal status. Compress had gone off to raid a small gang a few blocks over and had sent Dabi off to get coffee in the meanwhile, as his quirk was incredibly distinctive, and they didn\u2019t want alarms about League presence in Sendai being raised quite yet.\nWas this what not looking like a discount Frankenstein\u2019s monster felt like? Novel.\nIt was probably his tense nerves from being so openly out in public that caused him to almost snap his self-restraint and cremate the person who slammed their hands on his table when he finally sat down with drinks.\n\u201cHey, can we ask you a question for a survey we\u2019re doing?\u201d He looked up to see the eager face of some guy with green hair and red eyes, flanked on each side by a woman with blue hair and green eyes and a guy with white hair and blue eyes, who was giving him an odd look.\nStaring at them for a moment, he shrugged. He didn\u2019t really have anything better to do. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d the guy chirped. \u201cI\u2019m Matsumoto Ryouichi, this is Takahashi Sho, and the polar bear is Todoroki Natsuo.\u201d Dabi felt himself twitch at the name, trying to place it. Maybe he\u2019d met the guy a few years ago and he just couldn\u2019t remember him? That happened a lot, so it was certainly possible.\n\u201cHashimoto Touwa,\u201d he said in response, the fake name rolling off his tongue oddly. The guy with white hair, Todoroki\u2014ah, like Todoroki Shouto from 1-A, that must be why he looked familiar\u2014choked slightly at his words.\n\u201cSorry, what did you say your given name was?\u201d he asked stiltedly. Dabi raised an eyebrow at the response.\n\u201cTouwa. You know, kanji for lamp and wing?\u201d\n\u201cAh, right sorry,\u201d Todoroki said, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly, as if his face hadn\u2019t gone dangerously pale. \u201cI thought you said something else.\u201d\nDabi hummed skeptically, but let the matter go. The guy looked a little sick, and he really didn\u2019t feel like getting thrown up on. He lived with enough infection risks as it was.\n\u201cWe\u2019re students from the Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University,\u201d Matsumoto said, skillfully brushing right along. \u201cOur question is pretty simple: do you think doctors should be friendly and personal, or distant and professional?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, a friendly presence is nice, I suppose,\u201d Dabi started after thinking for a moment of the best way to answer the question when the only experience with doctors he could remember was sketchy underground ones who helped him staple his body together. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really like getting casually friendly with people I don\u2019t know that well, so keeping the talk strictly professional would be ideal.\u201d\n\u201cSo, a friendly demeanor but no questions outside of what\u2019s needed?\u201d the med student clarified. \u201cCool, thanks for your time!\u201d Dabi inclined his head in response as the bubbly man herded his friends away.\nWhat an odd interaction. It was weird, talking to people in the medical industry about something other than how the fuck he was still alive.\nAfter a moment, he shrugged to himself, deciding that it must just be how people without debilitating trauma or mental issues must interact. Finally taking a sip of his coffee, he pulled out his phone to kill time while he waited for Compress to get back.\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetdoes my face really look that weird\nthis is the third weirdly visceral reaction i\u2019ve gotten about it in as many days\nmr steal yo handswell considering that you usually look like an emo quilt fresh out of a tattoo salon to get piercings\nand now the only thing you have going for you is the emo part\nyeah you look really fucking weird\neven though i look like a burnt chicken nuggetdid\ndid you just call me an emo quilt\nmr steal yo handsyou can read japanese, yes?\n even though i look like a burnt chicken nugget   has changed their name to   emo quilt \nemo quiltthis the best descriptor i\u2019ve ever had\nmr steal yo handsfuck off it was an insult\nMamagiriPlease stop before this turns into an argument.\nHimiko, what have I said about changing my username?\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96\u2026 to not?\nemo quiltlmao she\u2019s not wrong tho\nhow\u2019s it going in hokkaido?\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96great!\nme and twice hunted down a local radical quirk discrimination group and now we\u2019re at the spa!\nemo quilthokkaido has quirk extremists?\nrent-a-personalityyeah, they saw toga\u2019s fangs and started insulting her :(\nmr steal yo handsi\u2019m assuming you took care of them\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96they weren\u2019t cute at all but they still bled super pretty\nrent-a-personalityyeah they\u2019re pretty taken care of\nfuckers are dead\nemo quiltnice\ncolonel sanders see, shiggy does care about us!\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96 awww!\nrent-a-personalityawww!\nemo quiltawww!\nStain Stanawww!\nmr steal yo handsshut the fuck up i hate all of you like i hate everybody else\ncolonel sanders yes, but\u2026 maybe you hate us a little less than everyone else?\nmr steal yo hands\u2026\u00a0\ncolonel sandersi rest my case\nmr steal yo handstalking a lot of shit for somebody in dusting distance\ncolonel sandersyou won\u2019t dust me, who else is gonna make game stop runs for you?\nmr steal yo handsi\u2019m sure i can find an alternative\nMamagiriTomura, please don\u2019t disintegrate Hawks.\nHawks, please stop teasing Tomura.\nmr steal yo handsfine\ncolonel sandersfine\nemo quiltmamagiri strikes again\nMamagiriDabi.\nemo quiltsorry\nalso hawks we literally left two days ago\nwhy are you back in tokyo already\ncolonel sandersi would be surprised you don't know, but it's very clear none of you watch the news\ngot a big meeting early tomorrow morning\nso i decided to fly down tonight instead of getting up super early\nkurogiri letting me come over for dinner was half the motivation ngl\nMamagiriIt\u2019s always a pleasure to have you over, Hawks.\nemo quiltthis is favoritism\nMamagiriPerhaps.\nmr steal yo handsyou\u2019ve literally known him for like six months how can you like him more than me\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96i mean\nit\u2019s not hard\nmr steal yo handsfuck off\nMamagiriI like Hawks because he actually gets the groceries I want when I ask him, and he cleans up after himself.\nUnlike the rest of you.\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96shots fired\nStain Stankurogiri\u2019s disapproval hurts more than i thought it would\nemo quiltwait are you saying that hawks is responsible\nMamagiriYes.\nrent-a-personalitythat\u2019s a little unexpected\nsince when the fuck has hawks been responsible\nemo quiltyeah hawks tell us\nhow does one do the responsible and become the favorite\ncolonel sanderstrauma\nemo quiltunderstandable have a nice day\nMamagiriOn another note, Dabi, where is Compress?\nemo quiltoh yeah he went off to go raid a gang a few blocks down\nhe should be done soon don\u2019t worry\nalso is it usually this weird to go into a coffee shop and have people not look at you\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96it\u2019s fun sneaking around with nobody the wiser, isn\u2019t it?\nemo quilthella weird but yeah i get your point\nit\u2019s nice not having people ask me if i need a medical professional\ncolonel sandersi mean, you obviously need more than one\nemo quiltfuck off\nHawks tried to repress a sigh as he checked the text from the Commission, tilting his wings as he changed direction. He was already on a tight schedule, so of course they wanted to meet right now.\nIt was a short detour to the HPSC building, landing on the balcony outside the president\u2019s office and knocking. The door was quickly slid open by the president herself, who gave him a distinctly unimpressed look at his method of entry.\n\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d he asked, careful to keep a relaxed look on his face as he strolled into the office. He tapped his fingers along the can of coffee he held, taking a sip as the president took her seat.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she started. \u201cWould you tell me why the League has been so erratic lately? You haven\u2019t been turning in your reports.\u201d\nAh. Hawks knew he\u2019d been forgetting to do something. He should probably cut down on his visits to the League a little, the hour flight time to and from cut into his already tenuous sleep schedule.\n\u201cHawks,\u201d the president said, voice colder, snapping him out of his head. \u201cPlease explain the League\u2019s current motivations.\u201d\nHawks paused, running over the words in his mind.\nThe League\u2019s current motivations.\nHawks wondered how he could best explain that the reason Dabi had burned down that church was to test the demon theory, or how Toga was only dropping all those expos\u00e9s at the media because the files were taking up too much space at the bar, or Shigaraki being spotted helping out pros at several quirk trafficking ring busts was half to investigate, half something Hawks didn\u2019t want to touch with a twenty-foot pole.\nAfter sitting in silence for almost a minute, mulling his thoughts over, Hawks decided to make a rash decision.\nHe stood up, looked the president dead in the eye, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t pay me enough to explain that fucking rabbit hole,\u201d walked out the door, and jumped off the balcony.\nFlaring his wings out and relishing in the harsh tug on his back muscles as his wings stopped his descent, he took another sip of his coffee as he fished out his phone, tapping out a text as he flew towards U.A.\ncolonel sandersy\u2019all are a terrible influence\nHitoshi didn\u2019t think that anything could have ever really prepared him for his transfer into the hero course. Sure, Aizawa had made sure that he was caught up on all the heroics-specific coursework, and he was actually  ahead  of his new class in their other classes, thanks to gen ed having more rigorous academics. But he supposed he wasn\u2019t prepared for the  atmosphere  or the  socialization. \nThe first thing he\u2019d said when he\u2019d been introduced as their new classmate was his name and that he wasn\u2019t here to make friends.\nWhen he finally took his seat in the heroics course, the first thing any of his new classmates said to him was from Todoroki, who sat behind him to his right. The recommendation student had tapped him on the shoulder, and when he\u2019d turned around to meet Todoroki\u2019s blank look with one of his own, he was simply told, \u201cFriendship isn\u2019t an option here.\u201d\nHitoshi had stared at him for a few moments, trying to parse out the possible meaning of the statement. Todoroki didn\u2019t strike him as a social butterfly, and his statement sounded less like an invitation to socialize than a warning. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya doesn't give you much of a choice. He has a tendency to beat your face in with kindness.\u201d With that, he settled back into his own chair and continued going through his notes before class, unconcerned with Hitoshi\u2019s alarmed look.\nHitoshi had turned back around after a moment to stare at the green-haired cinnamon roll that sat in front of him.  That  was ominous as fuck.\nAnd it was true.\nTodoroki had told him that Monday. Wednesday, Hitoshi and Midoriya had gotten into an argument while sparring during heroics, and Midoriya had shouted some profound stuff at him as he beat Hitoshi\u2019s face in the ground, and on Thursday he was being dragged over to Midoriya\u2019s table for lunch.\nHitoshi really understood the whole \u2018beat your face in with kindness\u2019 thing after that.\nSo yes, heroics was intense in a way he didn\u2019t really expect or had prepared for.\nSo when the No.2 hero burst into homeroom chugging canned coffee and looking vaguely like he regretted life under a strained smile, Hitoshi spared a thought as to why he was surprised by anything anymore.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, chickadees?\u201d Hawks chirped as he strolled into the room. Aizawa\u2019s frustrated sigh was mirrored by Tokoyami dropping his head onto his desk with a  thud.  Hitoshi wondered for a moment why Tokoyami would have such a strong reaction to his mentor\u2019s appearance, before comparing Hawks\u2019 bright smile to \u2018revelry in the dark\u2019 and answered the question for himself.\n\u201cHawks,\u201d Aizawa greeted in a less than pleased tone. \u201cI hope you have a reason to be here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Hawks said, tossing the empty coffee can over his shoulder and landing it perfectly in the trash can (Hitoshi felt slightly tempted to clap at the trickshot) as he reached into his jacket and took out a file, handing it over. \u201cRelease forms. I\u2019m here to pick up some first-year interns and escort them over where we\u2019re having the meeting. Jeanist and Edgeshot are picking up the second and third years.\u201d\nHitoshi had no idea what \u2018the meeting\u2019 was, but Aizawa nodded knowingly as he flipped through the file Hawks handed him, eyes critically scanning over each page. \u201cEverything seems in order,\u201d he grunted after a few moments, turning his attention back to the students. \u201cJirou, Shoji, Sero, Iida, Tokoyami, Kirishima, Uraraka, Asui, Bakugou, and Yaoyorozu, pack your bags and collect your cases,\u201d he called, each named student straightening up as pulled out the remote and released the cases containing their hero costumes from the wall. \u201cYour work studies are beginning early today. You will not be headed to your mentor's agency as you usually are, so Hawks will be escorting you all to location.\u201d\n\u201cI know you still have a class to teach, so do you want me to send you the sparknotes of the meeting afterward?\u201d Hawks asked their teacher as all the named students stood up from their desks.\nAizawa grunted, tilting his head ever so slightly in thought before he spoke. \u201cShinsou,\u201d he called, and Hitoshi shot up straight in his seat as Aizawa looked at him. Aizawa made a quick beckoning gesture and he quickly made his way up to the front. \u201cThis is Shinsou Hitoshi, my intern,\u201d Aizawa introduced bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ll send him in as my proxy.\u201d Glancing at Hitoshi, he said, \u201cShinsou, this is Hawks. Consider him your mentor for the day.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t sudden at all,\u201d Hitoshi muttered under his breath. Going by the way Aizawa rolled his eyes and Hawks gave a small chuckle, he wasn\u2019t quiet enough.\n\u201cGo get your stuff, chicklet,\u201d Hawks said, smiling. \u201cYou can hang with me and Tsukuyomi for the day.\u201d At Aizawa\u2019s pointed look, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t get hurt, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u201cHearing that statement from you of all people only makes me worry more,\u201d he heard the tired man grumble in response as he retrieved his case.\nHitoshi found himself sticking close to Hawks and Tokoyami as the hero packed up some kids from 1-B and herded the students out of the school and onto a bus that was to take them all to location. Sure, he sat with Asui  (\u201ccall me Tsu-chan,\u201d)  and Uraraka at lunch, but he didn\u2019t really know how to  talk  to them. Hawks, he supposed, was his mentor for the day and he knew Tokoyami could also appreciate silence and was unlikely to bother him with small talk.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the kid with the brainwashing quirk, right?\u201d\nHowever, that did not prevent Hawks from being a small talker himself.\n\u201cYeah, what of it?\u201d he said sullenly in response, his body already tensing defensively.\nTo his surprise, however, Hawks completely lit up at the revelation. \u201cYou were incredible! I was super disappointed you weren\u2019t in the hero course, I had so many people I wanted to pester into taking you as an intern.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to take me as an intern yourself?\u201d Hitoshi asked, raising an eyebrow as he tried to suppress the pleased flush that threatened to rise to his face.\n\u201cOh, I absolutely would have,\u201d Hawks said, shifting forward in his seat slightly to spread his wings a little further. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I\u2019d have much to teach you. Your quirk is voice-based, right?\u201d Hitoshi nodded. \u201cI\u2019m primarily a spotlight hero, and if you\u2019re interning with Eraserhead, I\u2019m assuming you intend to go underground. I can give a few tips for that, and maybe teach you a few bird noises, how to deal with heights - maybe complex multitasking if you\u2019re able to control more than one person at a time, though that would\u2019ve been a gamble, but beyond that, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had much to teach you for the week.\u201d\n\u201cI have several questions about that statement,\u201d Hitoshi said, and when Hawks nodded obligingly, he continued. \u201cMy first question is  bird noises?\u201d \nHawks smirked at him and let out a low, rumbling coo. Hitoshi blinked.\n\u201cYou want some bread crumbs with that?\u201d he asked, and  wow  he should really learn how to keep his mouth shut. Luckily, Hawks was a hero with a sense of humor and laughed at his comment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first to basically call me a pigeon, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Hitoshi said, a bit off-kilter, before continuing with his second question. \u201cYou said you could give me a few tips for underground work? But you\u2019re not an underground hero. You\u2019re literally the opposite of that.\u201d\nHawks shrugged. \u201cI took a lot of night patrols when I first started out, and I still take about two a week. Hero rankings are heavily based on popularity and crime and case solving rates of the season, but it also incorporates overall crime and case rates from the course of your career.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWorking double or triple shifts every day is how I was able to reach the top ten so fast\u2014because I had to compensate for not having that kind of history with underground work. So I\u2019m pretty familiar with the operations of underground heroes since I work with them often enough. I\u2019ve also done a bit of undercover work, which you have the potential to be pretty good at.\u201d\n\u201cUndercover work?\u201d Hitoshi asked, giving Hawks\u2019 bright red wings a pointed look over.\nHawks laughed. \u201cYep! As long as you keep an open mind to those around you, you already have most of the tools you\u2019ll need to be good at it, and with some refining, you\u2019ll be great!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Hitoshi asked, beginning to get drawn in by the prospect. Aizawa had mentioned undercover work in passing to him but had recommended that he go to another underground hero for advice on the subject, not having done much of it himself. Hawks nodded.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty charismatic, which makes sense with your quirk, and if you\u2019re underground, you\u2019ll be an unknown, so there\u2019s a relatively small chance of them identifying you. And if the way you got tensed up when I mentioned your quirk before is any indication, you have your tragic backstory and villainy reasons already laid out for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a villain,\u201d Hitoshi snapped, almost on instinct. Hawks held up his hands placatingly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you are,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that we\u2019re you to go undercover, sticking as close to your personal history as possible is ideal, since you\u2019re less likely to forget anything. Just tweak some stuff, say you never made it into the hero course and became bitter or something, and bam!\u201d Hawks clapped his hands. \u201cTragic backstory and villain origins. And since it\u2019s personal, your body language will be more natural as well.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cTake all your hero-related trauma growing up and there you have your cover. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\u201cYou have hero-related trauma?\u201d Hitoshi asked, mouth moving faster than his brain was able to say  \u2018that\u2019s a bit of a dick question.\u2019 \nLuckily, Hawks was probably one of the most chill heroes he\u2019d ever met, and didn\u2019t seem to take it personally and simply shrugged it off. \u201cI\u2019m the number two hero at twenty-three. Doesn\u2019t come with a clean psyche, kid.\u201d\nHitoshi shifted uncomfortably in his seat, not quite sure what to say in response to such a nonchalant admission. Hawks was right, in a sense, about him being charismatic, but he was only charismatic in getting people to talk back to him. He wasn\u2019t, however, skilled in talking to people who were way too casual about their trauma. Talking to Hawks was reminiscent of talking to Todoroki, and that was something he never thought he\u2019d say.\nLuckily, Bakugou was there to save the day, which was a day of firsts because that was  another  thing that Hitoshi never thought he\u2019d say.\n\u201cHey, chicken legs,\u201d Bakugou called over the noise of the bus. Hawks looked away from Hitoshi, identifying Bakugou\u2019s scowling face with a smile.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Explosion Jeanist?\u201d\nHitoshi choked. He couldn\u2019t believe Hawks went there, and going by the sweet scent of burning caramel that suddenly began drifting through the bus, neither could  Explosion Jeanist. \nAfter a few moments, wherein Hitoshi was pretty confident he could hear Bakugou grinding his teeth into dust, he spoke. \u201cWhere the hell are you taking us?\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d Hawks said, perking up as he clapped his hands together. \u201cListen up, chickadees!\u201d he called over the noise of the bus, quickly gaining all their attention. \u201cI know that work studies only started back up again last week, so you\u2019ve probably been pretty busy, and that for some of you, you\u2019re either at a new agency or this is your first work-study, and as a result, your mentors probably haven\u2019t had a chance to explain what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tell us why we\u2019re here?\u201d Uraraka asked, raising her hand.\nHawks nodded. \u201cYep! So, assuming you\u2019re all keeping up with the news, you\u2019ve all heard of that super team-up thing Jeanist, Edgeshot, Miruko and I have organized?\u201d There was a wave of affirmative nods and murmurs before Hawks continued.\u00a0 \u201cCongratulations! All of the agencies you\u2019re at for work studies are part of this, and your mentors decided to have all of you attend the first meeting so that you get some big team-up experience, and are aware of the details of what you\u2019re likely going to be working on for the rest of your work studies.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to be working missing person cases, right? Because of the League of Villains?\u201d\nHawks hummed his agreement. \u201cYou should all be aware that the League of Villains has taken a peculiar interest in missing person cases. We\u2019re not exactly sure  why  this sudden interest has appeared,\u201d Hitoshi watched Hawks\u2019 face twitch as he spoke\u2014he supposed it must have been irritating to see villains rescuing people without understanding their motivations, \u201cbut it\u2019s been having a pretty negative impact on hero society\u2014take the assassination of Shinoda Kei.\u201d Everybody on the bus winced or cringed in some manner at the reminder of the incident. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m glad that it came to light and measures have been taken to prevent stuff like that from happening again, it\u2019s just that we can all agree that the \u2018how\u2019 it came to light wasn\u2019t exactly ideal.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re doing this to show that heroes are still reliable as an institution?\u201d Iida asked.\n\u201cOfficially, yes,\u201d Hawks said. \u201cHave you guys had a class on hero politics or publicity yet? I\u2019m not sure when you're supposed to get in-depth on that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a second-year class,  kero,\u201d  Asui offered up from the back of the bus.\nHawks nodded, leaning back in his seat slightly to tilt his head to stare at the roof of the bus. \u201cOkay, well you\u2019ll understand this a bit better next year then, but what\u2019s happening is something of a publicity stunt to save face, but we\u2019ve also got an unofficial mission statement behind this as well. Unofficially, this is also being done in an attempt to intercept the League of Villains. We\u2019ve noticed a trend with the cases they\u2019re going after, so we\u2019ll be focusing on many of the same. The fewer of those cases there are open, the higher of a chance we\u2019ll have of encountering them while investigating.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cClose in the walls, see if we can get them. Like that one trash chute scene from  Star Wars  or something.\u201d\nAnother hand was raised hesitantly, and Hitoshi was able to spot it belonging to Kirishima before Hawks inclined his head at him to speak.\u00a0 \u201cThis team-up is super big, we\u2019re not going to be doing anything like the Shie Hassaikai raid, will we?\u201d\nHitoshi watched the way Uraraka and Asui\u2019s faces twitched at the mention of the raid - he wasn\u2019t even there and he could feel his stomach churn a little. Just reading the news about the incident had felt brutal, actually being there must\u2019ve been  horrible. \nHawks was quick to reassure them amongst the quickly deteriorating mood. \u201cNo, no. The Hassai Incident was an unusually large group; it\u2019s one of the biggest yakuza or organized crimes cells we\u2019ve had to take down in decades, and Overhaul\u2019s quirk was\u2026 exceptionally well suited for causing maximum casualties. The Shie Hassaikai raid had oversights and gaps where there shouldn\u2019t have been any, and new protocols have been put in place to try and prevent it from happening again.\u201d Hawks placed his elbow on his knee and propped his cheek in his palm as he continued to talk. \u201cSince you\u2019ll primarily be investigating cold missing person cases, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll be tracking down graves than yakuza. Your mentors will make sure you don\u2019t see anything disturbing in those instances. But if you do end up going after someone who is hopefully still alive, it\u2019s important that you understand that this team-up is primarily organized as a way to share information and call for backup. There are going to be many more sub-teams or groups within this little organization we\u2019ve created that will carry out raids on smaller and less equipped cells. Nothing like the Shie Hassaikai raid. We\u2019re actually expecting the amount of combative and medical personnel that we\u2019re going to require at each raid to be overkill, considering that we\u2019re going into this expecting to confront the League of Villains.\u201d\nHitoshi and other students on the bus relaxed slightly at the hero\u2019s words, but there was still an underlying current of tension at the possibility of encountering the League for a third (or in Hitoshi\u2019s case, first) time. Hawks seemed to pick up on the slight uneasiness and gave them all a closed-eyed, easy, friendly smile.\u00a0\n\u201cI highly doubt any of you will run into them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry about them too much, okay?\u201d Hawks opened his eyes again, gazing across them all. Hitoshi felt something incredibly  sharp  and  dangerous  about the look. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re all safe.\u201d\nHitoshi wasn\u2019t sure whether the confident statement was comforting or worrying. Hawks\u2019 smile wasn\u2019t one of surety in his strength, it was confidence in his knowledge. Logically, Hitoshi understood that there would obviously be information that they wouldn\u2019t tell student interns\u2014levels of confidentiality and all that\u2014but at the No.2 hero\u2019s brazen statement, Hitoshi couldn\u2019t keep himself from wondering what Hawks knew that they didn\u2019t.\ncolonel sanders[raidcaselocation.pdf]\nlist of cases being worked and raids being planned rn\ndon\u2019t get caught\nemo quiltoh nice\nthat was fast\ncolonel sandersfastest man alive, hot stuff\nmr steal yo handsis that all of them?\ncolonel sandersyep\nalso something i want to say, but to you specifically, dust machine\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96oh tea?\ncolonel sandersif you even so much as approach a student intern\nconsider your scalps \u2728 forfeit \u2728\nemo quiltthat\u2019s really fucking ominous\nStain Stanliterally don\u2019t do it\nhe\u2019s started giving me a detailed presentation on how his feathers are flexible enough to cleanly separate your scalp from your skull and its really terrifying\nmr steal yo handsare you threatening me?\ncolonel sandersyou have a track record\nmr steal yo handsdabi literally kidnapped a kid why are you bitching at me\nemo quilthey leave me and my scalp out of this\nalso i did that?\nStain Stanoh you did\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96wow ur memory really is trash\nemo quilt&gt;:(\ncolonel sandersdabi doesn\u2019t carry around a picture of a student in 1-a and go around showing it to serial killers like toga with a crush\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96hawksie out here throwing some shade\nalso izuku\u2019s really cute, why wouldn\u2019t tomura want to show him off?\nemo quiltit\u2019s really creepy not gonna lie\ncolonel sandersand you\u2019re also the one who decided to stick around and investigate tokyo\nif anyone is gonna run into a kid at the mall, it\u2019s you\nmr steal yo handsone time\ncolonel sandersyou strangled him in the middle of the food court!\nmr steal yo handshe was annoying\nemo quiltjfc shiggy calm ur tits\ncolonel sandersmoral of the story: shigaraki isn\u2019t allowed near children\n emo quilt   has changed   mr steal yo hand\u2019s name to   bad touch man \n emo quilt   has locked   bad touch man\u2019s username \nbad touch mani fucking hate all of you\nchange it back\nemo quiltit\u2019s a beautiful day to be the server admin\nMamagiriDabi.\nemo quiltwhat? am i wrong?\nMamagiriStop harassing Tomura, the both of you.\ncolonel sandersthen tell tomura that he\u2019s not allowed near any students bc he\u2019s got a reputation\nMamagiriTomura, please don\u2019t go after any students.\nbad touch manfucking fine\nMamagiriDabi, let Tomura change his username.\nemo quiltuuuugggghhhhhh\nfiiiiiiiiiinnnnneeeeee\n emo quilt   has unlocked   bad touch man\u2019s username \n emo quilt   has changed   bad touch man\u2019s username to\u00a0human dandruff\nMamagiriThank you.\nhuman dandruffi hate all of you\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96:(\nemo quilt:(\nhuman dandruff\u00a0fuck off dabi you deserve it\n\u201cDid I really kidnap a UA student?\u201d Dabi asked, looking up from his phone to where Compress was reclining on the other bed of their abandoned-cabin-turned-base, reading a book. \u201cThat sounds like something I should remember.\u201d The showman looked up at him with an eyebrow raised in exasperation and amusement.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even remember the time Toga stabbed your hand to a table a few months ago. But yes, you did. Just this summer, actually. It was quite an event.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Dabi intoned neutrally, returning his gaze to Shigaraki\u2019s pissed tirade in the League group chat, feeling a frown tug at his staples.\n\u201cThis is such a bad idea,\u201d Spinner muttered for the hundredth time, watching Shigaraki dig through files. Spinner was all for helping Dabi out, but he felt like he really should have drawn the line at Shigaraki deciding to break into the Hero Public Safety Commission to search through their old case files. Sure, they were the League of Villains and had Kurogiri ready to warp them out at any moment, but it didn\u2019t make him feel better about being deep in what was essentially the heart of hero society.\n\u201cStop being a little bitch,\u201d Shigaraki snapped at him, \u201cand start being useful. Check those shelves over there.\u201d He waved a hand at the opposite end of the room, before pulling out another box of files and skimming through them quickly.\n\u201cWhat are we even looking for?\u201d Spinner asked, pulling a dusty box off the highest shelf and nearly dropped it on his own head. \u201cYou were kinda sparse on the details.\u201d\n\u201cFiles on missing or deceased people that look sketchy.\u201d Shigaraki picked out two files from the box he\u2019d been looking through and tossed them into the box they\u2019d set up in the middle of the file room. \u201cThe HPSC has a lot of unreleased and classified information, so if we need information or new leads, this is the place we\u2019re most likely to find it.\u201d\nSpinner hummed his acknowledgment, and they worked in silence, for the most part, making their way through the shelves of the HPSC\u2019s classified file room.\nNow, Spinner was a follower of Stain and his words of false heroes, but as he looked through the classified files of hero society\u2019s governing body, he suddenly felt a lot more understanding for late-night rants back at the bar about the inherent corruption of heroes.\nThe HPSC had a  hit squad  for people with information they wanted to be kept silent\u2014that entire box had been shoved next to the one slowly filling with independent files in the middle of the room.\nQuirk experimentation, blackmailing of heroes, missions that were assigned despite the minuscule chance of survival. Every dirty secret that was too classified to risk being stored on a digital, hackable server. Unfortunate that they hadn\u2019t accounted for a warp quirk.\nThe box labeled  Legacy Program  was filled with nothing  but  files on people; it was heavily redacted as well, and skimming over the birth years of some of the children  (Spinner was tempted to read further into the files to figure out what on earth the HPSC wanted with kids, but a feeling deep in his gut told him he didn\u2019t want to know)  placed a lot of them around Dabi\u2019s estimated age, so he just shoved that whole box to join the growing pile in the center.\nAnother box filled with files of cases that the Commission had ordered law enforcement to stop investigations into, a few files from the box of people who\u2019d quit unusually early and knew far too much, an amalgamation of files on people the HPSC didn\u2019t want anyone asking questions about.\n\u201cThe guard shift will change soon,\u201d Shigaraki grunted once they\u2019d met in the middle, a sizable mountain of boxes and files piled up in the center of the room. His phone was already in his hand, pinging Kurogiri for pickup.\nHelping Shigaraki push the boxes of files through Kurogiri\u2019s portal (read: doing it himself, because Shigaraki was lazy and pulled his quirk as an excuse, despite the fact Spinner  knew  that Shigaraki was perfectly capable of taping his fingers, but he wasn\u2019t exactly looking to get into that death wish), Spinner tried to ignore the growing pit in his stomach about what going through the information would reveal.\nLEAGUE OF VILLAINS BREAKS INTO HPSC HEADQUARTERSBy Matsuoka Natsumi\n\n Late last night, League of Villains leader Shigaraki Tomura and members Spinner and Kurogiri broke into the classified archive room of the Hero Public Safety Commission, and stole hundreds of classified documents and files. The break-in was only discovered after the fact, by a guard who checked the room as part of his regular patrol and found it ravaged. The HPSC had a press conference on the matter early this morning and released a statement giving basic details about the break-in, however, declined to share the nature of the information stolen. \n\n\n In recent months, the League of Villains has been acting in a capacity more akin to that of vigilantes, and while most laws draw the line between vigilantism and villainous charges very thin, most of the League\u2019s recent actions fall on the grayer side of that line. They have been acting as independent, albeit highly illegal, investigators and whistleblowers, which leads to many questioning what precisely is going to happen with this latest move by the League. \n\n\n From professional analysts to those on social media, nobody is quite sure what the League\u2019s goals are, as they have become muddled and unclear in recent months. It has been theorized that the League is returning to its more illegal acts, but on the opposite end, it has been suggested, as is in line with their more recent actions, that they are planning an expos\u00e9 on the HPSC. The amount of information stolen and the Commission\u2019s refusal to share what had been taken have been cited as evidence for this theory. \n\n If the Commission is indeed the next target of the League\u2019s investigation, considering what has previously been revealed - the assassination of Shinoda Kei, the Hanzou Cartel cover-up, the negligence of the TPD - concerns have been raised about what possible sociopolitical ramifications\u2026  Read more\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Kichirou called, jogging as fast she could in her heels to catch up to the duo she spotted. \u201cWait up, please!\u201d She almost cried in relief as the two stopped in unison, turning to look at her; one with slightly flushed cheeks, a peppy smile, and space buns, the other covered in spandex and jittering in place. She stumbled to a stop as she caught up with them, hunching over for a few moments to catch her breath.\n\u201cAre you okay lady?\u201d the spandex-covered one\u2014Twice, she remembered\u2014asked her, concern lacing his voice. \u201cFuck off and die!\u201d\nKirichou blinked, caught slightly off guard by the sudden switch, but recovered quickly enough. She\u2019d heard about his split personality she just... hadn\u2019t really been expecting to run into the League of Villains in Hokkaido, of all places. Last she checked, they operated mainly in Tokyo. But, she wasn\u2019t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she reassured, an easy smile on her face before she turned to the girl next to him. \u201cYou\u2019re Toga Himiko, correct?\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s\u2014Toga\u2019s  smile brightened as she nodded eagerly, fists tightening near to her jaw in excitement, and  oh, that was a knife. \nKirichou decided to pretend the red staining the edges of the knife was rust, for her own peace of mind.\nPushing the thought out of her mind, she bowed to the teen, who blinked at the action, her smile briefly replaced by a look of shock. \u201cMy name is Maeda Kirichou - Serizawa Yuuta is my cousin. Thank you for saving him.\u201d\nStraightening up, she saw the grin on the teen\u2019s face suddenly come back with almost overwhelming joy. \u201cOh, I remember him! He smelled like a power plant!\u201d\nKirichou laughed, almost able to completely ignore the fact that she was talking to a villain, with the child-like joy Toga gave off, and the man next to her joined her excited bounces, the two seemingly feeding off of each other. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you a few questions?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Twice asked worriedly. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna be calling the police on us, are you? Fuckin\u2019 snitch!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d she was quick to reassure them. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not the biggest fan of the police, after how they mishandled Yuuta\u2019s case. I\u2019m a journalist, I just wanted to ask a few questions about you, maybe your opinions on a few things\u2026 an interview?\u201d she suggested meekly.\nThe word \u2018interview\u2019 seemed to be the jackpot, as Twice and Toga brightened up, and began bouncing on their feet again in unison.\n\u201cAn interview? Like the ones famous people give?\u201d Toga asked excitedly.\n\u201cYou are sort of a famous person, yourself,\u201d Kirichou said. Toga squealed, glomping Twice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna give an interview and get famous!\u201d she cheered. She gasped suddenly, smile getting even brighter and the flush of her cheeks darkening. \u201cOoh, what if Izuku-kun or Ochako-chan see it and fall in love with me?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great, Toga-chan!\u201d Twice joined in on her celebrations, somehow managing to keep his excited hop going, even with the extra weight. \u201cThis is a fucking nightmare!\u201d\nIMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY: AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH TOGA HIMIKO AND TWICE FROM THE LEAGUE OF VILLAINSBy Maeda Kichirou\n\n Hokkaido is a relatively peaceful island, in early January. Snow is on the ground, a chill in the air, the sound of people hustling to work, school-children in large groups enjoying the last few days of their winter break. So, understandably, I was surprised when I spotted two members of the League of Villains on the street ahead of me. I hurried to catch up with them. Usually, I\u2019d never chance to approach a villain, I wouldn\u2019t even consider it. However, since the League seems to have been turning more towards vigilantism as of late, the journalist in me was able to overpower my common sense. \n\n\n My first impression of the two was that they were incredibly positive and energetic; the two are clearly good friends, and both seemed to find joy in simple things. When I approached them asking for an interview, they were both over the moon. We often write off and think of villains and criminals as these distant, cold personas, but when talking to Twice and Toga, I couldn\u2019t help but forget they were villains - talking to them, they were people. \n\n\n What follows is a transcript and commentary of an almost hour-long joint interview I had with Toga Himiko and Bubaigawara Jin (Alias: Twice), their stories and their perspectives of the world as it is. Both are stories of being outcasted for aspects of themselves beyond their control, be it either discrimination against their perceived \u201cvillainous\u201d quirk, or stigmatization and ostracization due to mental illness. Both are incredibly positive people, despite all they\u2019ve been through, and I believe it is important to share their stories; how systemic problems we refuse to acknowledge in our modern society cause people to turn to villainy, as it is only amongst the other outcasts of society that they can feel accepted. \n\nToga elected to speak first, allowing Twice time to collect himself.

It is fast forwarded as the coffee is brewed, and slows down again as Hawks takes the full pot off of the hot plate. He turns to the freezer and takes out several ice cubes and drops them into the pot, swirling them around to quickly cool the coffee. Hawks proceeds to chug the entire pot in one go. He then slams the pot onto the counter and turns to face the office, loudly declaring, \u201cI\u2019ve had my coffee, and I\u2019m ready to fight God or f****** die trying.\u201d The video begins to shake uncontrollably, and wheezing laughter can be heard in the background before the video abruptly ends.]\ntsukuyomi @ reveling in the dark @dementiaravenwayReplying to @hawksofficialif it makes you feel better, i have more than one video of you flying into billboards that i chose not to share.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @dementiaravenwaythe disrespect\nEvery day is leg day @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficial and @dementiaravenwaythe implication that you\u2019re respectable in any way is the real punchline here. i\u2019ve watched you cry over The Notebook too many times.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficial and @dementiaravenwayit\u2019s really good, okay, stop exposing me\nBest Jeanist @bestjeanistofficialReplying to @hawksofficial, @mirukoofficial and @dementiaravenwayHawks, there is nothing we can say about you that you haven\u2019t already told all your followers whenever you get on social media sleep-deprived, which is almost every single time.\nKING EXPLOSION MURDER @KINGEXPLOSIONMURDERReplying to @bestjeanistofficial and 3 morewhy the fuck did you wait until after my internship to get a fucking personality\nEvery day is leg day @mirukoofficialReplying to @bestjeanistofficial, @hawksofficial and @dementiaravenwayjeany, i take back every bad thing i\u2019ve ever said about you, drag him\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficial, @bestjeanistofficial and @dementiaravenwaythis is bullying\nEvery day is leg day @mirukoofficalReplying to @hawksofficial, @bestjeanistofficial and @dementiaravenwaystop me, coward\nchargebolt go wheeyy @irlpikachuReplying to @mirukoofficial and 3 morethe fact that pros are allowed to run their own social media accounts is a blessing i thank whatever higher being there is for every single day\n\u201cHey, Todoroki-kun!\u201d Izuku called as he jogged into the common room, catching the attention of the stoic teen from where he sat at the kitchen counter. \u201cDid you want to come and see a movie with us this Saturday?\u201d\nTodoroki blinked at the question, his eyes flicking over to the calendar hung on the wall. Izuku followed his glaze; most of the days were filled in with who was supposed to be cooking, due dates on various assignments, but the box labeled  January 18  was relatively blank. \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d he said bluntly. Izuku blinked at the response, and Todoroki stared at him for a moment longer, before continuing in a slightly softer tone. \u201cI\u2019m going out with my siblings that day. Maybe I can join you for something on Sunday, or another weekend, Midoriya.\u201d\nIzuku beamed at the response. Todoroki had certainly opened up more throughout the year. \u201cYeah! I\u2019d love that, Todoroki-kun.\u201d\n\n Touya. \n\n\n It\u2019s January 18th again, and it\u2019s been another year without you. A lot has happened this year; I\u2019ve started at U.A., and that\u2019s kept me so busy that I haven\u2019t had time to think of coming sooner. \n\n\n I thought I\u2019d hate U.A., that it\u2019d just be more of the same. I never really got to hear much about it from you\u2014you went to watch the sports festival in person, once, but the old man had started keeping us separate by then. Fuyumi always told me that you thought U.A. was alright, but she likes to look for the positive in everything, so I wasn\u2019t really sure. The teachers are nice. They care a lot. I\u2019ve made friends too, I think you\u2019d like that. I\u2019ve mentioned in my previous letters that I would become a hero without using my fire\u2026 my first friend, Midoriya Izuku (All Might\u2019s son), helped me realize how much I was holding myself back. Trying to become a hero using only ice to spite him\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live my life for him, either by living to follow his ambitions or by living only to go against him. I remembered what you told me about fire not being scary. I went to go see mom for the first time. I\u2019ve started seeing a therapist at U.A.. Midoriya\u2019s helped me a lot, you probably would\u2019ve liked him for that, if nothing else. I like to think you would have been proud of how much better I\u2019ve started doing this year. \n\n There\u2019s been a lot of villain attacks this year. I\u2019ve only been involved in three, personally. Midoriya\u2019s been in all of them. All Might\u2019s retired. Dad\u2019s the number one hero, now. I  know  you would have hated that. There\u2019s this younger hero, Hawks\u2014he\u2019s No.2, and his case rate has gone through the roof recently\u2014there\u2019s a lot of speculation that he might have a shot at No.1 next season. You would\u2019ve probably found this hilarious, at the very least. You knew him, I think. I remember seeing him at your funeral. I don\u2019t know how you knew him, but\u2026 I think you\u2019d like the hero he\u2019s become. I met him again when he came in to speak at heroics class, last semester. He\u2019s nice.\n\n Fuyumi\u2019s getting married. She wants me to be the ring bearer, and I think I\u2019m going to say yes. I remember Ashido (a classmate) saying something about \u201cplaying hard to get\u201d being beneficial for relationships, and I\u2019m trying to connect with Fuyumi and Natsuo more, so I\u2019ve decided to try it. \n\n\n I really hope you\u2019re proud of me, or at least, can be proud of who I am when I become a hero. I got my provisional license, after trying the exam a second time. You probably would\u2019ve made a joke about \u201cthe number 2 being a running theme in the family\u201d or something like that, but hug me nonetheless. Or at least, that\u2019s what I like to think. \n\n\n Fuyumi and Natsuo have finished writing their letters, so I suppose I should wrap this up. I\u2019ll try and visit again before next year. \n\n\n I hope you\u2019re happy, wherever you are now. I miss you. \n\n\n Shouto. \n\n \u201cFUCKING RUN FASTER!\u201d  Dabi screeched at Compress, ducking around a corner to dodge a blast of electricity.\n\u201cI\u2019M  TRYING!\u201d  Compress yelled back. Usually, Dabi probably would\u2019ve found it hilarious that the showman had finally lost his composure, but that was when they didn\u2019t have an angry supervillain on their tails, actively trying to kill them.\nTwo years ago, Dabi was fairly sure that he thought he would die of an infection, and he still held it as a likely probability. However, \u2018death by electrocution\u2019 was moving up his list of  the most likely ways i\u2019m going out  faster than he would have liked. As a person who had 39 metal piercings (did staples count as piercings? Probably.) on his head alone, he was surprised he hadn\u2019t come across this situation sooner.\nWell, he thought bleakly to himself as he felt a staple in his leg tear while sharply turning around another corner, at least they had managed to cross Morimoto Shou off the list of potential identities for himself. The problem was it turned out he\u2019d been a supervillain with an unknown identity. Considering what he could remember of his life so far, that about tracked.\n\n Hey, bro. \n\n\n I know I was just here a few weeks ago, but it\u2019s January 18th again, so here I am. \n\n\n Uni\u2019s going well. First-year is almost over\u2014I\u2019ve made friends, gotten good grades, made poor choices that I\u2019m sure you would have encouraged endlessly. Takahashi managed to convince Matsumoto to drink tub juice; he\u2019s gullible and more susceptible to doing things \u201cbecause it\u2019d be fucking cool,\u201d than you were. I managed to cut him off so he\u2019d only blackout, not need an ambulance. That band you really liked\u2014you had a poster of them in your room, Ajax Souls\u2014they\u2019re getting back together for a reunion tour next year. That other band, Clean Sweep (you bought their first album, back when it came out)\u2014Matsumoto\u2019s a fan, he\u2019s dragging me and Takahashi along to go see their show when they\u2019re in Sendai. \n\n\n I\u2019m not sure what Shouto will say. He\u2019s writing more than usual, but I\u2019ll just make sure you\u2019re updated none the less. He might just be writing about a conspiracy theory he might think you like, for all I know (I think he said the moon didn\u2019t exist, last time we all got together). But he seems to be doing pretty good, whenever I see him. Fuyumi agrees when she calls. U.A.\u2019s been surprisingly good for him. I think I\u2019ve seen him smile more in the last year than in the last ten combined. \n\n\n Fuyumi\u2019s well. She\u2019s engaged, now. Her girlfriend proposed two weeks ago. I get to be the best man for her which is pretty cool, if I\u2019m being honest. We\u2019re going suit shopping in March; they\u2019re planning on an August wedding. I think she\u2019s trying to convince Shouto to be the ring bearer. She said something about her fianc\u00e9 trying to con one of her hero friends to be the flower boy. Rumi\u2019s a riot, you two would\u2019ve gotten on great. I\u2019ll be sure to tell you all about the wedding when it happens. \n\n\n I miss you, Touya. I hope you\u2019re finally happy, wherever you are now. \n\n\n Natsuo. \n\n\u201cCall for help, CALL FOR HELP!\u201d Dabi screamed at Compress.\n\u201cFrom who, the  police!? \u201d Compress growled back, running alongside Dabi.\n\u201cYes, call one-ten\u2014of course not the police! You wanna get arrested? Call Kurogiri, dipshit!\u201d\n\u201cI left my phone in the cabin, you idiot!  You  call Kurogiri!\u201d\nDabi liked the League of Villains. No matter how frustrated he got with them, he liked them. He liked them. He liked them enough to not barbeque them. Maybe if he repeated it enough times, he could believe it. He barely suppressed a growl as he dug through his pockets, grimacing at the warm, wet feeling of blood staining his pants. Burns scars and staples weren\u2019t an ideal combination for cross-country.\nPulling out his phone and wiping the smear of blood off on his shirt, he quickly pulled up his contacts and dialed Kurogiri. The bartender was responsible, a fact that Dabi was exceptionally thankful for in that specific moment, and picked up on the first ring.\n\n \u201cDabi? Is something wrong?\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d he responded breathlessly.\n\u201cWhat he  means  is we\u2019re about to die!\u201d Compress yelled. \u201cAn escape portal would be highly appreciated right now!\u201d\nDabi really related to the deep, bone-tired sigh Kurogiri let out.\n\n Hey, Touya. \n\n\n I hope you\u2019re well, wherever you are. We\u2019ve been\u2026 pretty good, down here. Shouto\u2019s doing well at U.A.; he\u2019s made friends, he likes his teachers, and he\u2019s finally gotten his provisional license. Natsuo\u2019s started med school - he\u2019s still planning to become a doctor. He doesn\u2019t come home very often and he fights with Dad when he does\u2014almost as much as you did. I do think he\u2019s trying to be better, and he has started to be better this past year, but I know you wouldn\u2019t have wanted to hear about that. I know Natsuo and Shouto don\u2019t. Mom\u2019s started doing better, ever since Shouto started to visit. \n\n\n My class this year has been wonderful. They\u2019re little troublemakers, all twenty of them, but it\u2019s worth it to see them grow. I can hear you laughing at me for saying something as sentimental as that, but it\u2019s true. \n\n\n Rumi proposed to me, two weeks ago. I said yes. Natsuo is going to be my best man, and Shouto\u2019s started warming up to the idea of being the ring bearer for us. We\u2019re going to start planning next month - we\u2019re aiming to be married in August. I\u2019m going to keep a seat for you, on my side of the aisle - front row ticket. I would\u2019ve wanted you to be there. \n\n\n Rumi is friends with Hawks\u2014I\u2019ve mentioned this a few times, I think. I still don\u2019t really understand how you knew each other, and I still haven\u2019t really gotten a chance to talk to him, not even at the funeral, but going by the way Rumi talks of him, he\u2019s doing well. He seems happy. I know he leaves you letters, as well; I see them in the box, sometimes, whenever I write a new one myself. He\u2019s going to be Rumi\u2019s best man along with Ryuukyuu. They\u2019re splitting the position, somehow, so I\u2019ll get a chance to talk to him. Maybe about you. I\u2019m still trying to decide if that\u2019s something to bring up. It\u2019d be nice to know a friend of yours. You were always pretty quiet about school. \n\n\n I miss you Touya. \n\n Love,    Fuyumi. \n \u201cHow  on Earth did you two manage to be chased halfway across Hirosaki when all you were supposed to do was investigate?\u201d Kurogiri asked them once they fell through the portal.\n\u201cDabi doesn\u2019t seem to understand the concept of \u2018not everyone thinks you\u2019re funny,\u2019\u201d Compress muttered, dusting himself off with a huff as he stood up.\n\u201cFuck off, I\u2019m hilarious.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re rude, there\u2019s a difference.\u201d\nDabi groaned into the hardwood floor of the bar, before turning his face to the side to look up at Kurogiri. \u201cDo we have a stapler behind the bar or anything?\u201d\nKurogiri tilted his head at the odd question but nodded. Dabi grunted and peeled himself off the floor, steadfastly ignoring the red stains where his legs had been. In Kurogiri and Compress\u2019s shocked silence, he slid behind the bar and grabbed the stapler\u2014an office one, but it would do\u2014and a bottle of whiskey, before slinking towards the bathroom.\n\u201cDabi,\u201d Kurogiri suddenly cut in, concern lacing his voice, \u201cif you\u2019re injured, it would be best to go find a doctor. That\u2019s not even a medical stapler you\u2019re planning to use.\u201d\n\u201cWell, unfortunately,\u201d Dabi bit back, turning to glare over his shoulder, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m built to do cross-country, even if my health wasn\u2019t weaker than a wet tissue. You can find a doctor to take me to, I\u2019m not gonna complain about that, but in the meantime, I wanna drink the pain away and refrain from finding out if my skin can slide down my legs like shitty thigh highs. We good?\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cGreat. Call when you find someone willing to treat me, I\u2019m gonna get wasted in the bathroom.\u201d\n\n Hey, Touya. \n\n\n It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been pretty busy lately; the Commission has me doing a lot of stuff apart from patrol and managing my agency, so I haven\u2019t really been able to get a day off until now.\u00a0 \n\n\n Your siblings have been pretty good, from what I can tell. Tsukuyomi (he\u2019s my intern, I mentioned him last time I came) tells me that Shouto\u2019s doing pretty well. Failed his licensing exam, but he got it on the second try. He\u2019s working at your father\u2019s agency with a friend. Midoriya, I think, the kid who kept breaking his fingers at the Sports Festival. I think Natsuo\u2019s doing okay too, I probably would have heard about it through Rumi if something terrible happened. Fuyumi\u2019s doing great. Rumi finally proposed (she had that ring in her knife drawer for over a year, I swear), and they\u2019re getting married in August. Rumi\u2019s asked (well, more like demanded, but you know her) me to be her best man (Ryuukyuu\u2019s gonna be her maid of honor. Not quite the traditional wedding format, but Rumi does what she wants), so I suppose I\u2019ll finally have to talk to your siblings, at some point or another. \n\n\n Is it weird that I\u2019m nervous about speaking to them? They always sounded so nice when you talked about them, but I\u2019m always afraid of what they\u2019ll think of me, or what they\u2019ll ask. They looked confused when I went to your funeral, so I know you never really talked about training at the Commission, or me, for that matter. I felt out of place, and I don\u2019t want to intrude on anything. How would that even go? \u201cHey, remember your dead brother, Touya? We used to make out under stairwells in a secret government training facility. Surprise!\u201d You\u2019d find it hilarious, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019d go over well. \n\n\n That\u2019s a little silly to be caught up on. I\u2019ll probably wing it, say we were school friends or something. I don\u2019t want to upset them. Besides, it\u2019s Rumi who\u2019s gonna be the in-law, not me, so it should be fine. Rumi told me Fuyumi\u2019s keeping a seat for you, on her side of the aisle. I think that\u2019s sweet of her. Shouto\u2019s supposed to be the ring bearer, though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s agreed yet, and Natsuo\u2019s gonna be best man for her. Rumi\u2019s trying to convince Tsunagu to be the flower boy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to say yes, but she\u2019s stubborn and pushy. I\u2019m tempted to suggest asking All Might instead\u2014he might have retired, but he\u2019s a sweetheart and I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019d say yes. It\u2019d be the funniest shit if it happened, I\u2019d have to video record it and leave it here for you or something. \n\n\n Well... I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d find All Might so funny anymore. He retired after a huge villain attack at Kamino Ward. Had to fight some ancient supervillain called \u2018All for One\u2019. Your father\u2019s the No.1 hero, now. Pretty sure that\u2019d piss you off. He still calls me a child, funnily enough, despite the fact I now occupy the place he had for over twenty years. Ha. Your old boyfriend, the No.2 hero? That\u2019s kinda funny. \n\n\n I\u2019ve made friends since I last came to see you. Well, I think they\u2019re friends. Rumi\u2019s really my only point of reference, but I do like spending time with them (mostly). They\u2019re really weird, but they\u2019re nice, in their own way. One of them\u2019s hot, and we\u2019ve been flirting. He reminds me of you, a lot. I\u2019m\u2026 kind of at a loss of what to do. Rumi\u2019s telling me I should just let him rail me, but\u2026 it feels sort of like I\u2019m forgetting you, or replacing you, if I move on like that. And yeah, I get the whole point of moving on is \u201cmoving on,\u201d but you\u2019re special to me. I can just imagine all those relationship books saying things like \u201chigh school romances aren\u2019t meant to last,\u201d or something like that, but we weren\u2019t exactly a typical high school romance, were we? I can practically hear you making fun of me for being so sentimental. Well, too bad, I\u2019m gonna miss you whether you like it or not. \n\n\n I\u2019ve started distancing myself from the HPSC, as well. You always said they were terrible to me, and I guess understood that, but now I suppose I\u2019m doing something about it, since we couldn\u2019t escape together like you always talked about. I remember you trying to convince me to escape to America together or something. You wanted to start a band. I\u2019m not exactly piercing my tongue and dying my hair black\u2014they still own me, you know that\u2014but I\u2019m not letting them walk over me anymore either. \n\n\n They\u2019re calling me in now. Mandatory. I suppose they don\u2019t appreciate the meaning of a day off, but I guess I need to finish this up, now. \n\n\n I hope you\u2019re proud of me, Touya. \n\n Loving you, now and forever,    Keigo. \n\nkurogiri\u2019s favorite\n\n @everyone \n\nanyone mind telling me why the hpsc called me in on my first day off in months to talk about, in order: a break-in and massive information leak, a scandalous interview, and high-property damage chase through hirosaki\nStain Stanyeah, the break-in would be me and shigaraki\nit was just recon, tho, we got a lot of info\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritehm.\nprepare for trouble (and make it double)me and toga gave an interview to a really nice lady!\nit was fucking boring\nMagic MikeDabi angered a supervillain and he chased us through Hirosaki.\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritewell, it was the chase that tipped the scales and got me called in so\n\n @frankenstein\u2019s toaster \n\ngive me one good reason why i shouldn\u2019t fly over and strangle you right now\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasterkinky\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritelisten, it\u2019s a really shitty day for me\nso unless you want me to rip off your burnt dick and feed it to you\ncut the shit\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasterwait no dont do that\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96do it\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasteri was being a dick and i\u2019m sorry okay\nplease don\u2019t rip my dick off\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96do it\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasterno!\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritei\u2019ll take your plea under consideration\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasterfear\nsnake skinif that\u2019s over with\nwe can move on to finding ways to speed up our investigation\nStain Stani can already tell this isn\u2019t going to go great\nsnake skinapparently one of the 1a kids is pretty good at analysis\nkurogiri\u2019s favoriteno\nsnake skinyou didn\u2019t even let me finish\nkurogiri\u2019s favoriteand you can\u2019t solve all your problems by attacking 1a\nsnake skinfuck off i\u2019m in charge\n\nkurogiri\u2019s favorite\n\n @mist mom \n\nsnake skinoh you fucker\nmist momTomura, you promised you weren\u2019t going to approach any students.\nsnake skinthey\u2019re kids, nobody likes kids, what\u2019s the fucking problem\nMagic MikeYou might be projecting a little bit, Shigaraki.\nsnake skinkids are horrible\nkurogiri\u2019s favoriteyou want attention, kids take it\nit\u2019s called jealousy, get over it\nsnake skin\u2026\nyour username is stupid\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritewhat did we just say about jealousy\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96hello 110 i just witnessed a murder\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasteri should\u2019ve brought popcorn this is fkn hilarious\nprepare for trouble (and make it double)oh wow hawks\ndid you have a bad day?\nhe seems fine to me\nkurogiri\u2019s favoriteyes.\nand since all of you (except kurogiri) managed to make it exponentially worse\nconsider yourselves on thin fucking ice\nsnake skinfine we won\u2019t do anything with 1a\nget your feathered ass over here tomorrow to help out, if you\u2019re gonna be such a bitch about this\nkurogiri\u2019s favoritei am this close to murdering you\nfrankenstein\u2019s toasterdo it, it\u2019ll be hot\nkurogiri\u2019s favoriteyou too\nfrankenstein\u2019s toastera little less hot\n\u201cExactly how much information did you steal?\u201d Hawks asked, flicking through a box of files on the floor with a disbelieving look on his face.\n\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Spinner started, tilting his hand. \u201cWe combed the entire classified archive and took what looked interesting. So, a lot.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Hawks muttered, running a hand down his face.\nDabi snorted. \u201cSo how are we splitting this up?\u201d he asked, crouching next to Hawks and looking over the sea of information. \u201cWe just take a box each and look for plausible leads?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good enough,\u201d the hero shrugged.\nThey each reached for the box closest to them, settling into a companionable silence, broken only by the rustling of papers and files. Dabi flicked through the files quickly, separating them into piles for \u2018possible\u2019 and \u2018bullshit\u2019.\nSuddenly, a choked sound cut through the room, and Dabi glanced over to where Hawks sat next to him, looking sick. He raised a brow at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to throw up, please make sure it\u2019s not in my general direction.\u201d\nHawks blinked and glanced back at him, awareness flooding his glazed eyes, though they still looked a little\u2026 absent. He opened and closed his mouth for a moment before muttering, \u201cYeah, sorry about that.\u201d\nDabi glanced at the file in his hands as he closed it, catching only a glimpse of white hair and blue eyes. Something tugged in the back of his mind as Hawks set it aside into his \u2018bullshit\u2019 pile. \u201cHey, birdie. You okay?\u201d\nHawks blinked and startled again, whipping his head around to stare at Dabi. Dabi frowned at the reaction; it was pretty hard to startle Hawks, so he wasn\u2019t sure what the deal was. \u201cWhat\u2019d you just say?\u201d\nHe stared at the hero for a few moments. \u201cI said, \u2018you okay?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Hawks said in response, seemingly deflating. \u201cI thought you said Ke\u2014nevermind.\" He shook his head. \"I\u2019m just hearing things. Sorry, I\u2019ve been pretty off my game this week.\u201d He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes for a moment before staring up at the ceiling and sighing. He pulled out his phone to check the time and stood up. \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Dabi said slowly, watching the hero stretch. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re fine?\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Hawks smiled at him. Dabi\u2019s gut twisted. It was  wrong,  but he didn\u2019t know  why.  \u201cBe careful of how you get rid of those files, though. I\u2019m not sure dumping it all at the media is a great idea right now.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, whatever you say.\u201d Dabi shrugged disinterestedly, turning back to his box of files. Hawks could take care of himself.\n\u201cLater!\u201d the hero called as he left, and Dabi obligingly waved over his shoulder as Toga, Twice, and Spinner all called back to him.\n\u201cHawks, hey!\u201d\nHawks perked up at the sound of Rumi\u2019s voice, twisting around to see the fellow hero shoving through the crowd towards him, a white head with red spots following behind her. He ignored the nervous twist of his gut. \u201cThere\u2019s the happy couple!\u201d he laughed, cutting himself off with a strangled noise as Rumi did her best to shatter his ribs in a hug.\n\u201cBeen a while since we got a chance to catch up outside of work,\u201d she said, setting him down after one last squeeze. The slight woman who had been following behind his friend caught up and slipped her hand into Rumi\u2019s.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting that we go clubbing, I\u2019m gonna have to say a firm \u2018no\u2019 to that,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cGot a wedding to start planning, don\u2019t we?\u201d\nRumi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cRight! God, I can\u2019t believe I never got you two in the same room,\u201d she laughed. \u201cHawks, this is Fuyumi, my fianc\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d he greeted, holding his hand out for the other to shake. Fuyumi offered him a small smile as she shook his hand, and-\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, Hawks.\u201d\n-apparently, they were addressing the elephant in the room. Was it in the room if they were outside? Not the point. His smile tightened. \u201cYou as well.\u201d\nRumi blinked, looking between the two of them. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d She suddenly turned and whacked Hawks over the head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? I coulda introduced you two sooner!\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t punch the merchandise!\u201d he squawked, ducked away from her arm.\n\u201cWhat merchandise, I only see a KFC bucket with legs!\u201d\nFuyumi laughed, like winter bells, effectively distracting the two from their quarrel before it turned physical. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Rumi,\u201d she giggled, face quickly calming as she continued talking. \u201cMe and Hawks only met once, and it wasn\u2019t really under great circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, he save you before or something?\u201d\n\u201cFuneral,\u201d Hawks cut in with a flat voice, face falling into its default dead look.\nRumi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, shit - sorry, won\u2019t bring it up again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Fuyumi said, squeezing Rumi\u2019s hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d Her eyes flicked back over to Hawks, and he thanked his years of training for keeping the growing pit of dread he felt from showing on his face. \u201cHawks, I know this is a lot to ask, but would you mind telling me what you remember about him\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTouya?\u201d he asked. A guilty, but hopeful look passed across her face.\n\u201cPlease\u2014if it\u2019s no trouble.\u201d\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is supposed to be about you and Rumi getting hitched, but\u2026\u201d he rummaged around in his pocket, eventually procuring an old receipt for the yakitori place down the street from his apartment and a pen, scribbling down his number. \u201cHere, if you want to meet up some other time, or call-\u201d\nFuyumi took the paper with lights in her eyes, beaming at him. \u201cYes, thank you so much. It\u2019s great to finally know one of his school friends.\u201d\nHawks\u2019 stomach twisted, and he fought down a wave of nausea.\n\n \u201cWe can get away from the hell, Kei,\u201d Touya murmured into his hair, spindly arms wrapped around his waist. \u201cYou and me. They\u2019d never be able to hurt us again,\u201d he promised, pressing a kiss against Keigo\u2019s smiling lips- \n\nGod, he wished he\u2019d been mean enough to say no to Fuyumi\u2019s request.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hawks agreed, a plastic smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d He turned to Rumi, who had respectfully averted her gaze during the conversation to at least pretend she wouldn\u2019t have been able to hear their conversation from three blocks away. \u201cReady to plan the wedding of the century?\u201d\nRumi grinned. \u201cOh,  hell  yeah.\u201d\nqueen thumperyou alright?\nyour heartbeat sounded like death metal earlier\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyyeah im fine\nqueen thumperokay im calling bullshit right now\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneylet it go rumi\nqueen thumperalright, if thats how you want it to be elsa\nbut if you need to talk\nim the best listener\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneydo you want me to make the obvious rabbit joke or the present mic joke\nqueen thumperpresent mic joke is more original\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyi\u2019ll take it under advisement\nqueen thumperbut seriously hawks, you always get pretty down this time of year\na lot worse this year tho\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyi\u2019m just really stressed rn\nqueen thumperyou??? freely admitting to stress or feeling pressure of any kind???\nhawks how close are you to a complete meltdown\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyit's not that bad\nqueen thumperoh, now you're trying to walk it back\nnot fooling me\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyrumi it's fine, you don't need to worry about me\nqueen thumpertake a day off, hawks, youre about to have a nervous breakdown\ni can cover your patrol next sunday, sleep in, take some time for yourself\ngo full spa day if you have to\ni\u2019ll join you in the evening to make sure you\u2019re relaxing\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneywhat no sundays are your day off\nqueen thumperconsider it me paying you back for all those times you covered for me so i could go on dates w yumi\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyim not sure\u2026\nqueen thumpertake the day off or i add tsunagu to the chat\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneysuddenly i am taking a detour to go pick up bath bombs and face masks\nqueen thumpergood boy\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneythanks rumi\nyoure a really good friend\nqueen thumperright back at you\nchicken shit\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneywow and here i thought we were having a moment\nqueen thumperwe were, but i refuse to let this conversation end on an emotional note\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneythe fact that you of all people are getting married astounds me\nqueen thumpersucks to suck, doesnt it single boy\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneyfuck off\nqueen thumperjust let that hot guy ur always complaining about rail u\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloneynot having this conversation right now\nqueen thumperyes having this conversation right now\nhawks\nhawks\nhawks dont you dare fucking ignore me\nchicken wings, chicken wings, hotdog and baloney\u2714\ufe0fread 10:52pm\nqueen thumperi am fucking murdering you next time i see you\n\u201cThe League of Villains has certainly become more active in recent months,\u201d Nemuri muttered, hand pressed over her mouth as she looked over the papers in front of her.\nShouta grunted his agreement. \u201cTheir activities are going to prove pretty problematic soon if they don\u2019t slow down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hizashi asked, leaning back in his chair to look upside down at the two of them.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve started gaining public support\u2014people have started calling them the \u2018League of Vigilantes,\u2019 if you can believe it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to believe,\u201d Nemuri said, looking up from the essays she was grading. \u201cIf you think about it, the only crimes they themselves committed before all this was breaking and entering, assault, attempted murder, for Shigaraki, and kidnapping. When most people hear League of Villains, they\u2019re expecting them be a bunch of mini All for Ones.\u201d She shrugged, twirling her pen between her fingers. \u201cAfter all that, pretty much all of their crimes can be charged as vigilantism, and since they\u2019ve been so high-profile from the start, it was bound to be a problem from the get-go. You know how the public gets over vigilantes.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially ones that are as effective as the League has been,\u201d Shouta muttered, a frown on his face.\n\u201cHey, Shouta, can you help me read Midoriya\u2019s paper?\u201d Hizashi asked, chair tilting back even further so he could stick the paper under Shouta's nose. \u201cHis writing got all tiny and excited again.\u201d\nShouta rolled his eyes, but snatched the paper out of his hands and began going over it with his own red pen regardless.\n\u201cThe League\u2019s definitely trying something, though,\u201d he muttered as his eyes scanned through the problem child\u2019s minuscule handwriting.\n\u201cThey\u2019re always trying something,\u201d Nemuri said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure what.\u201d\n\u201cWe can actually sort of deduce what they\u2019re trying to do going by what we know about them,\u201d Shouta said, circling a section of the paper in red and adding a note about going off on tangents. \u201cShigaraki\u2019s whole thing is tearing down hero society, most represented by his attempts to kill All Might. Some of the people who joined the League as well, like Spinner and Toga, we know that they joined because of Stain, and that doesn\u2019t bode very well either.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that they\u2019re doing this to tear down the hero system?\u201d Hizashi asked. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like the most practical way to do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, just because\u2014Hizashi, what is this essay even supposed to be about? Midoriya\u2019s all over the place.\u201d\n\u201cI let them choose whatever topic they wanted.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains a lot. Anyway, just because they\u2019re not running around murdering heroes doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t being effective. They\u2019re just doing what vigilantes do, but on a nation-wide scale.\u201d\nNemuri laughed at the confused and lost look on Hizashi\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re primarily a daytime hero, so you don\u2019t have to deal with vigilantes as often, but... they have a tendency of shaking faith in the hero system, especially the good ones. You know, protecting the people the heroes can\u2019t, bringing down justice without fear of high-ups trying to sweep something under the rug. They show how we\u2019re flawed, and that can get pretty dangerous.\u201d\nHizashi\u2019s eyes widened behind his sunglasses in understanding, finally setting his chair back on all four legs and spinning around to face them fully. \u201cAnd the League is the highest profile group of vigilantes we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nShouta nodded. \u201cStudents have been spending a lot of time on it in Current Events. Every week, we have to have another lesson on how what they\u2019re doing is going to affect the public perception of us. I\u2019ve never had to spend so much time with a class on current events until this year. I\u2019m considering just setting up a weekly assignment where they have to keep up to date on the League\u2019s activities. We\u2019ve actually started to fall behind in some other subjects because we have to spend so much time on the League.\u201d\n\u201cThe League is powerful, quick, and clever. They don\u2019t have to worry about bureaucracy like we do, so they\u2019ve been solving cold cases left and right.\u201d Nemuri shrugged and flipped over to the next paper to grade. \u201cIt\u2019s started this whole discussion about them bringing down crime rings and bringing home people we were never able to, and that\u2019s going to get pretty damaging soon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the information leaks\u2026\u201d Hizashi murmured, a dour look on his face. Shouta glanced at him but didn\u2019t comment on his down demeanor.\n\u201cThose are probably the worst part of it,\u201d Shouta said, glaring at the paper in front of him as if it could solve all his problems. \u201cYou remember Shinoda Kei.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all just gone downhill from there,\u201d Nemuri commented. \u201cThe Hanzou Cartel cover-up got a few heroes\u2019 licenses revoked, and you\u2019ve seen the trial on television, and the protests against the TPD are only getting larger.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they just broke into the HPSC,\u201d Hizashi continued. \u201cThey won\u2019t tell us what was taken, so who knows what the hell we\u2019re going to find out, or what kind of damage it can do.\u201d\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s a government body, so most of its activities are required to be made public record by law, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be some seriously shady stuff if they\u2019re refusing to even warn anybody outside of the higher staff in the Commission what was taken. They\u2019re not even giving us an estimate of how damaging this could be.\u201d\nShouta hummed his agreement. \u201cAll we know if that they took a significant amount of information from the Commission\u2019s classified archives, and if that information is anywhere near as damaging as what the League\u2019s been releasing so far-\u201d\n\u201cThe reaction\u2019s going to be brutal. I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t have riots in the street,\u201d Nemuri said.\n\u201cShigaraki\u2019s gotten clever, and we have no idea where to find the League - we don\u2019t have another chance like the one Yaoyorozu gave us back at Kamino.\u201d Shouta\u2019s hand clenched around his pen, fingers going white at the pressure as he scowled. \u201cThe League\u2019s trying to cut down society as we know it, and they\u2019re succeeding.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, so the Suzuki Yakuza lead didn\u2019t follow through,\u201d Shigaraki announced as he burst back into the bar, causing everyone to look up at him. \u201cHowever, we no longer have any competition or leads left in Shibuya.\u201d\n\u201cCross it off the map, then?\u201d Spinner asked, glancing up from his file. Shigaraki grunted, and Dabi watched as Spinner stretched over and crossed Shibuya off the large map of Greater Tokyo on the wall. \u201cWe\u2019ve completely finished Tokyo then.\u201d\nShigaraki hummed, walking over to scan their  WHO THE FUCK IS DABI?  wall, while Dabi himself simply shrugged and continued reviewing files, listening to the conversation around him as it happened. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared the largest level in the game, then, but what about the rest of it?\u201d\n\u201cWe only have Kawasaki and Sagamihara left in Greater Tokyo. Hawks said that the group of heroes he has working on this is about halfway done with the areas they\u2019re focusing on.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll be focusing next, then,\u201d Shigaraki decided before turning to face the rest of the room. \u201cHave we finished sorting through the files?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018We,\u2019\u201d Dabi repeated mockingly under his breath.\n\u201cFuck off, you discount easy bake oven. Have you finished?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Dabi rolled his eyes, snapping the folder in his hand shut, tossing it into the large pile of folders in the center of the room. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Shigaraki said, turning to Toga. \u201cGo get some blood; you and Kurogiri are dropping off all the bullshit folders, it\u2019s getting cramped in here.\u201d\nToga beamed and squealed in excitement, bouncing off to her room to go find whatever blood sample she wanted to try out.\nDabi fondly shook his head, slowly standing up and helping Spinner and Twice pack all the bullshit files into boxes. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close,\u201d Twice chirped happily. \u201cAll this effort and we\u2019re finally closing in! This is pointless!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dabi grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ve made more progress in the past\u2026\u201d he paused, trying to remember how long it had been.\n\u201cSeven months,\u201d Spinner offered.\n\u201cYeah, more progress in the past seven months than I have in eight years.\u201d\nToga bounced back into the room, or rather, a middle-aged woman in a pressed suit who honestly looked deranged with Toga\u2019s excitement on her face. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d she cheered.\nShigaraki grunted and waved at Kurogiri, who took his cue to open a portal to a newspaper office halfway across Tokyo. Toga hummed happily and picked up the first box of files, skipping through the portal before coming back a minute later to grab another. The rest of the League watched the process in relative silence.\nDabi frowned. Something was wrong. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something,\u201d he muttered, running a hand through his hair as he thought. Spinner and Twice glanced at him, while Shigaraki simply rolled his eyes and kept his attention on whatever free-to-play game he had going on his phone.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll remember whatever it is,\u201d Twice said, clapping a comforting hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou forget fucking everything!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Spinner agreed. \u201cNo offense, Dabi, but-\u201d\n\u201cI already know I\u2019m going to take offense to this.\u201d\n\u201c-I\u2019ve literally seen you text the group chat asking if any of us had seen your phone.\u201d\n\u201cHarvey Dent\u2019s done it more than once, don\u2019t sugar coat it,\u201d Shigaraki cackled.\n\u201cFuck you, coconut flakes!\u201d\n\u201cRight back at you, patchwork!\u201d\n\u201cWanna fucking go, chapstick poster boy?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s fucking go, Evanescence!\u201d\nJust as Dabi and Shigaraki launched themselves at each other growling out insults, Dabi only just barely heard Kurogiri\u2019s tired sigh before a portal opened between them.\nThe past year he\u2019d had with his class was really fucking testing Shouta\u2019s will to live. Most other years he\u2019d been a teacher, he just expelled those with no potential (or max stupidity), suffered through every field trip and training camp, slept all day during the breaks\u2014but this particular class, throughout this particular year...\nShouta was 95% convinced he\u2019d found a grey hair earlier that morning. He wondered if he should quit teaching, or maybe heroism all together once the school year was over. He half considered just letting himself get mauled on patrol so he could isolate himself with a nice pension. Become a recluded cat person who didn\u2019t have to deal with all this  bullshit. \nBut he didn\u2019t do that.\nInstead, he was stuck with all his students staring expectantly up at him, all sat around the dining table in the common room, not marching down to Nedzu\u2019s office to turn in his two-week notice.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he began, looking over his silent class, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all smart enough to figure out why the staff is being required to meet with all of you on Sunday instead of waiting until tomorrow, especially if you\u2019ve all been keeping up with the news.\u201d\nNEW DOCUMENTS REVEAL GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED QUIRK EXPERIMENTATIONBy Saitou Gorou\n A new leak by the League of Villains reveals the Hero Public Safety Commission has partaken in highly illegal quirk experimentation. It is currently confirmed that a facility in Chiba was used to perform experiments on criminals with life-sentences. We are currently working to confirm the identities of those involved and those impacted. The HPSC has released a statement denying the allegations\u2026   Read more \nHis class remained silent, but they nodded their heads quietly.\n\u201cThe League of Villains has leaked possibly the most damning information yet, and more is still coming out as we speak.\u201d Shouta glanced down at the notes from the staff meeting and sighed before he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s best that I inform you now how we believe this is going to impact your education here at U.A., and what we\u2019re doing to try and mitigate any ramifications that could come upon any of you.\u201d\nKirishima hesitantly raised his hand, a troubled look on his face. Shouta nodded his head at the student. \u201cSensei, what do you mean by ramifications on us? I didn\u2019t think anything had come out about the education system, specifically.\u201d\nShouta sighed, mentally crossing out any hope he had of squeezing in a nap before his patrol that night. \u201cIt\u2019s not a direct matter, nothing has explicitly come out about U.A., Shiketsu, or any of the other hero schools. It\u2019s more of what we\u2019re expecting to be an osmosis effect of what\u2019s come out about the Commission\u2019s activities. Any of you know which new scandal out of the dozens that have appeared this week is most likely to affect public perception of U.A.?\u201d\nHERO COMMISSION FOUND TO HAVE SECRET POLICEBy Itou Aiko\n New documents revealed by the LoV, and summarily fact-checked and followed up on, reveals the Hero Public Safety Commission to be guilty of ordering hits on those they consider to be \u201cdangerous persons.\u201d These persons aren\u2019t top Yakuza bosses or trafficking ring organizers - it\u2019s those with information the HPSC doesn\u2019t want getting out. The HPSC has released a statement denying\u2026  Read more\nMidoriya hesitantly raised his hand after a moment of silence. Shouta wasn\u2019t surprised and made a loose gesture for the kid to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s about what came out about the Legacy Program and Hawks, isn\u2019t it.\u201d\nShouta watched as the faces of some of the students fell flat at the statement. He wasn\u2019t surprised that not all of them knew about it yet\u2014it had only come out two and a half hours prior. Tokoyami looked particularly stricken. \u201cYeah. We\u2019re expecting a lot of public outcry about hero training programs being targeted at minors, and we\u2019re currently not sure about whether or not this might lead to U.A. being shut down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kaminari cried, similarly shocked exclamations escaping some of those surrounding them.\nHERO COMMISSION ACCUSED OF BLACKMAIL AND EXTORTIONBy Minami Miyako\nAnother new information leak by the League of Villains has revealed records of the Hero Public Safety Commission blackmailing and extorting dozens of heroes into silence, with threats of blacklisting, contract termination, having their licenses revoked, to even bringing false charges against them. The HPSC has released a statement\u2026 Read more\nShouta flashed his quirk, and the class quickly settled down. He sighed as he tilted his head back, squeezing out his eye drops. \u201cOur current plan of action, which we\u2019re going to have more meetings about to finalize over the next week, is to cancel this year\u2019s entrance exam.\u201d He looked back down at his students. \u201cThere will be no new Class 1-A, B, C, D, E, etcetera, etcetera next year. You\u2019re one of the last two hero classes to be trained at U.A. High School.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026 is U.A. shutting down, then?\u201d Uraraka asked worriedly, wringing her hands together. Several of the other students shared the same concerned look as the bubbly girl.\n\u201cU.A. High School will be shutting down,\u201d Shouta said, barreling over anymore shocked exclamations before they could happen. \u201cU.A. University will be starting.\u201d\n\u201cU.A\u2026. University?\u201d one of the students muttered.\n\u201cU.A. will be using the next three years to transition to a university format. First-year teachers will be using the next year to prepare, and the year after that, we will begin entrance exams for first-year U.A. university students. Second-year teachers will use that year to prepare, and third-year teachers the year after that. It has been planned to try and allow you all to continue and finish your education at U.A. High School, and allow all those who will not be able to have a chance this year to apply at U.A. University in two years' time.\u201d\nYaoyarozu raised her hand, and Shouta nodded for her to speak. \u201cWill other hero schools also be following this approach?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently not sure,\u201d Shouta admitted. \u201cHowever, with the severity and amount of public outcry already happening, we\u2019re expecting legislation to raise the hero training program age limit to at least eighteen. As all of you are already enrolled, you might be exempt from that. However Nedzu wants all of us to inform you now that while we will try our best to allow you to continue your education here, assuming your parents still give their permission, that the hero program here might be transitioned into another General Education class.\u201d\nShouta tried his best to not let his gaze linger too long on Shinsou, who looked particularly pissed at the idea of having just fought tooth and nail to get  out  of Gen Ed, only to be kicked right back come the new school year.\n\u201cYou would all, of course, be automatically accepted into U.A. university as an extra class for that year, should this happen, but we decided it would be best if we informed you of this now instead of during tomorrow\u2019s press conference.\u201d\nHis class was silent, faces solemn.\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d\nEvery hand raised.\nShouta sighed. Definitely not getting that nap in before patrol.\nHERO COMMISSION INFORMATION LEAK SHOW RECORDS OF QUIRK TRAFFICKING; NO.2 HERO HAWKS MAIN VICTIMBy Kanda Jiro\n\n In perhaps one of the most shocking new Hero Public Safety Commission scandals to be revealed by the League of Villains this week, new documents that have been extensively followed-up on and verified reveal No.2 Hero Hawks to be a victim of quirk trafficking by the HPSC. The Commission gained an interest in the young Hawks, or as we now know his name to be, Takami Keigo after he saved nine people from a high-speed car crash at the young age of six. Takami was then sold to the Commission by his mother, Takami Tomie, and he was taken to a government-sponsored facility to join a training program known as the Legacy Program. \n\n\n Records show very few of those in the Legacy Program to have survived, and none of the children recruited into the program were allowed to leave without having their memories altered if decided to have no potential in the program. Takami\u2019s name was buried by the HPSC when he was six, to hide any possible relation to his father, known as Takami the Thief, a famous robber and serial killer in the slums of Fukuoka. \n\nRecords of Takami\u2019s training are brutal to read, ranging from combat training to interrogation, even to lessons on withstanding torture, beginning from when he was only eleven years old\u2026 Read more\nHawks sighed happily as he sank deeper into the almost scorching water. He almost never had an opportunity to use the lavish tub (borderline a pool) his apartment had come with. He might have to take more days off, if only to have the time to feel his muscles unwind and relax in the heat of the water. Having left all his feathers, except for the soft down close to the bone, underneath a heat lamp in the living room, Hawks was very much in a comfortable bliss right at that moment.\nHe stretched, groaning at the pleasant burn of his sore muscles. Both his phones were turned completely off and tucked away in a desk drawer so he didn\u2019t even have to  look  at them. His agency knew to forward any calls they might have for him to Rumi, and while she might not have an agency of her own, she was smart and could definitely keep the Aery from falling apart for a day, at the very least.\nHawks leaned back, closing his eyes as he relaxed. No heroes, no sidekicks, no Commission, no League, no Dabi and his stupid blue eyes, no  nothing.  He allowed himself a small smile.\nHe startled when he heard a pounding at his front door, choking slightly on the barely lukewarm bathwater. Shit, he\u2019d fallen asleep? Hawks frowned as he lifted his hand out of the water, his fingers and palm pruned to the extreme until his skin faded into talons. The pounding at his door began again.\n\u201cHawks? You in there?\u201d\nHe relaxed. It was just Rumi. \u201cJust a minute!\u201d he shouted back, moving one of his feathers in the living room to unlock and open the door as he crawled out of the tub and reached for a towel. \u201cCome in!\u201d He returned his attention to quickly drying down his body and patting the water out of his down feathers as she entered his apartment. \u201cGimme a sec, I\u2019m getting dressed,\u201d he called as he slipped on boxers and sweatpants. Tying his halter top at the neck, he grabbed his towel and started drying his hair as he exited the bathroom, freezing as he saw what awaited him in the living room.\nRumi was there, still in full costume and looking troubled, which was never a great sign, and beside her stood a plain man in a trench coat, leafing through his briefcase. They both turned to him, giving him an unidentifiable look. Hawks briefly wondered if it was possible to be underdressed in his own home. Probably. But in his own defense, he had no idea they were coming.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked after a moment, settling his towel around his shoulders instead of continuing to dry his hair, calling his wings back to him. The warmed feathers proved a comforting weight against his back.\n\u201cI apologize for the intrusion,\u201d the man next to Rumi said, bowing slightly. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s important. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve seen the news?\u201d\nHawks blinked. A feeling of dread that had become all too familiar the past few months settled in his stomach. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that happened today, then no,\u201d he responded, slowly making his way over to the kitchen. The move was less for practicality and more to get behind the counter that separated it from the living room. He could handle people seeing his talons, but he wasn\u2019t very comfortable with a stranger being able to see his fucked-up bird feet. \u201cI took the day off, no exception, so I\u2019ve turned both my phones off.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains why you weren\u2019t answering my calls,\u201d Rumi muttered under her breath.\nHawks took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. It was becoming very, very clear that something was wrong, and it wasn\u2019t going to do him any favors to panic.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s best that I get right to the point then, instead of making you wait,\u201d the man said. Hawks watched him warily, plucking a glass off the counter and filling it with water. \u201cMy name is Detective Tsukauchi Naomasa, from the Musutafu Police Department.\u201d He sat at the counter, tapping his talons nervously against the glass. \u201cA case has been opened against the Hero Public Safety Commission for Quirk Trafficking and Child Abuse, amongst other charges.\u201d\nHawks forced himself to keep breathing. So that\u2019s what it was about. \u201cHow effective would it be for me to pretend like I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, and that I have nothing to do with this.\u201d\nThe detective\u2014Tsukauchi\u2014gave him a sympathetic look as he shook his head. \u201cNot very. You\u2019ve already been identified as a key witness in the case, and if you don\u2019t want to testify, you\u2019re still enough of a person of interest that we expect you to be in danger.\u201d\nHawks let out a bitter laugh. \u201cThe Moonlights, right? Their execution squad. You\u2019re afraid there\u2019s going to be a hit on my head.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his face through his hair, catching briefly in the wet tangles. \u201cThought I\u2019d make it to at least twenty-six before they decided to take me out.\u201d\n\u201cHawks\u2026\u201d Rumi murmured, taking a few steps forward to lean over the counter, laying a comforting hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cHow\u2019s this gonna go down?\u201d Hawks asked in a monotone voice, already exhausted from the conversation.\n\u201cDue to the determined threat on your life, Miruko is currently here in an official capacity to act as a security detail.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna sneak up on you with my ears around here.\u201d Rumi grinned, and Hawks found a slight bit of comfort in her confidence.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working out the details, but the current plan is to have a rotating roster of heroes staying with you to ensure your safety. We\u2019ll be contacting you within a week about the case if you\u2019re willing to testify.\u201d\nHawks shrugged as best he could with how tense his shoulders had become. \u201cMight as well, if everybody knows already about this. Can\u2019t get much worse.\u201d\nTsukauchi nodded. \u201cThank you, Takami-san. An-\u201d\nHawks knew he was fast, he was famous for it, but right at that moment, he\u2019d be surprised if anything would ever be faster than the speed at which his stress levels ratcheted up at hearing the name. It was fast enough that he didn\u2019t have time to even think about calming himself before he felt the muscles in his hand forcibly contracting, and the glass in his hand shattered under his grip. His hand tightened into a fist, shards of glass digging into his palm.\nThe detective startled at the sudden sound, and Rumi flinched back. It took all of Hawks\u2019 willpower to force his other hand to grip his arm instead of grabbing Rumi; he didn\u2019t need his dumbass predator instincts grabbing Rumi  (p r e y)  and making the situation worse. His hand felt warm as blood welled up from the sharp glass, and further up, his arm stung as he felt the pinpricks of his talons digging into his skin.\n\u201cGod, Hawks,\u201d Rumi breathed in shock, eyes wide. \u201cFuck\u2014are you okay? Shit, you\u2019re bleeding, lemme see-\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Hawks wheezed out, throat tight. It\u2019d been over a year since he last stress gripped, and even longer since he\u2019d done it in front of another person. \u201cNot gonna be able to let go for a while. \u2018S part of my quirk.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d Rumi asked, and Hawks looked up at her and  shit  he\u2019d made her worried.\nHe shook his head.\n\u201cSooner we get this conversation over with, sooner I\u2019ll be able to let go,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust\u2014don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\nThe detective looked shaken, Hawks could feel his eyes lingering on the red streaks he knew were running down his arm and hand, but nodded nonetheless. His fingers tightened at the attention, and Hawks chewed at the inside of his cheek to prevent himself from making any noise.\nTsukauchi seemed to speed through the rest of the conversation, only calling him by his hero name (Hawks appreciated that), and soon left with a promise to call the next day with more information and to keep him updated.\nHawks tersely bid the detective goodbye as he left, and sank further into his seat, awkwardly burying his head into the crook of his elbow as the door shut. Rumi had crossed over to be on the same side of the counter as him, at some point, and was rubbing circles into his back, right between his wings.\n\u201cHawks?\u201d she asked quietly. He gave a thought to how it was vaguely disconcerting for Rumi to be so subdued. He turned his head, eyes skipping over the small puddle of red that was smeared underneath his arm to look at her. Worry was clear as day on her face.\n\u201cKeigo,\u201d he muttered, tongue almost stumbling on the name he hadn\u2019t spoken in years. \u201cYou can call me Keigo if you want.\u201d\nShe gave him a soft smile. Hawks felt as if his entire day had taken place in the Twilight Zone, by that point.\n\u201cKeigo, then. Anything I can do to help you stop gripping that glass like a teddy bear?\u201d\nHawks\u2014Keigo? Was he Keigo, now? Keigo let out a choked laugh. \u201cTurn off the lights? Helps me calm down.\u201d\nRumi nodded, and Keigo listened to her footsteps pad across the floor and the  click  of the light switch before the room was bathed in darkness, the only light coming through the nightlife outside his window. He closed his eyes, feeling his muscles uncoil. Rumi\u2019s hand returned to rubbing his back, and a few minutes later, the shards of glass made an odd, chime-like sound as they fell onto the counter from his shredded palms.\nAlthough he knew his cheeks were blotchy and he could feel a pounding headache from his swollen sinuses, Keigo was really glad that his quirk made him unable to cry. He\u2019d had enough jarring emotion for one day.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialI take one day off. I turn my phone off for one day.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialIt\u2019s pretty late, and my agency\u2019s PR department has already gone home for the night, but I want to address this as soon as possible: yes, the documents the League of Villains has released about me and the Legacy Program are true. There\u2019s no point in me lying about that.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialNo, I will not be accepting any interview requests or answering any questions about this. Not only is there an open case about this, and my safety somewhat at risk due to the situation, I am also not comfortable talking about this at the moment. Maybe in the future, but not now.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialI do want to address this, however: amidst all this, my real name has been made public knowledge, and I\u2019ve noticed people have already begun using it in place of my hero name. I'd highly prefer if this wasn\u2019t the case and that all of you continue referring to me as \u201cHawks.\u201d\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialEver since I was six, and in a way, before that, the only thing that has ever been mine was my name. The Commission basically owned everything else, including my body. But my name was mine, and it is mine, and I deeply dislike people using it without my express permission.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialYou can use my name for official, informative purposes, like news articles about what\u2019s been revealed today, but apart from that, for unrelated purposes where my real name is unnecessary, I\u2019d prefer to be referred to as Hawks.\nyakitori simp @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialThank you all for understanding.\ntsukuyomi @ reveling in the dark @dementiaravenwayReplying to @hawksofficialI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, Hawks.

Right, she hadn\u2019t got further than middle school. To be fair, Dabi didn\u2019t even know his own education level, but he\u2019d been a bit of a bookworm for his investigations before joining the League. \u201cBasically, I'm saying it doesn\u2019t look like shit.\u201d\n\u201cOoohhhhh. Okay!\u201d\nQuickly crossing the street, not bothering to walk down to the crosswalk (they were villains, what harm was a little jaywalking going to do?) and stood in front of the building.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Spinner said, glancing over the notes he had written down in a dingy notebook. \u201cAccording to Giran, Abe Chiyo was held in here once, and it\u2019s been abandoned with little to no activity since, so we can probably find some substantial evidence of his whereabouts here.\u201d He tucked the notebook into his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nToga let out a little cheer and took the first stride forward, reaching for the door handle and-\n\n Thnk. \n\n\n Thnk. \n\n\n Thnk thnk thnk. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s locked,\u201d Toga said blankly, pausing before aggressively trying to turn the handle faster, as if that would gain her entrance.\n\u201cYeah, I can hear that,\u201d Dabi muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose. The investigation was going to be a nightmare, he could already tell.\n\u201cWho locks an abandoned building?\u201d Spinner asked incredulously.\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Twice asked. \u201cShigaraki can\u2019t dust it, Compress can\u2019t marbleize it, and Kurogiri can\u2019t warp us in? Let\u2019s just go home already!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any useful blood on me,\u201d Toga announced as she rifled through her pockets, a pout upon her face.\n\u201cLet me find their measurements,\u201d Twice murmured, reaching to fish out his notebook.\nDabi, listening to the conversation, took quick stock of their surroundings and came up with a far less convoluted plan. \u201cSave it,\u201d he told Twice. \u201cGimme a sec, locks are my specialty.\u201d\nSpinner raised a skeptical brow. \u201cSince when could you pick-\u201d\n\n CRASH! \n\n\u201c-locks\u2026\u201d he trailed off, staring in shocked silence as Toga giggled hysterically at the window Dabi just threw a brick through.\n\u201cSee?\u201d Dabi said casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just shattered a window. He strode forward, boots crunching on the glass, leaning away slightly from the window as he gave it a few whacks with his elbow to widen the hole. \u201cMy specialty.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s some bullshit,\u201d Spinner commented sourly. Dabi shrugged in response before vaulting himself through the window.\n\u201cWorked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDabi heard Spinner\u2019s sigh as the other three climbed in behind him, quickly fanning out across the first floor.\n\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d he called after a few minutes, kicking a rotting chair aside and watching in amusement as it fell apart.\n\u201cNothing here!\u201d Twice chirped\n\u201cI found a file cabinet!\u201d Toga called, underlined by hollow metal noise and the deafening screech of rusted drawer slides.\n\u201cNothin\u2014Toga, be careful with the file cabinet, you\u2019re gonna get tetanus!\u201d Spinner snapped.\nDabi froze, the words tugging at something in the back of his mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Toga whined, and the shaking sound from the file cabinet increased.\nOh. Oh fuck.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Dabi shouted, slapping his forehead in frustration.\n\u201cIs that a \u2018stubbed my toe\u2019 shit or an \u2018I\u2019m about to get murdered\u2019 shit?\u201d Twice asked. \u201cFucking die, for all I care!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018I just remembered something important way too late\u2019 shit!\u201d Dabi bit back.\n\u201cWell, unless it\u2019s something important that's about to get us murdered, it can wait! We don\u2019t know how long we have until somebody calls the police about you throwing a brick through a window!\u201d Spinner yelled.\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d\nburnt toasthey hawks uh\ni just remembered that i forgot to separate those files you told me to be careful about from the main bullshit pile\ndiscount icarusi\u2019m aware\nburnt toastwait what\nhow do you know\ndiscount icarusbecause the information in those files got me put in witness protection, dipshit\ntell shigaraki i\u2019m not going to be available apart from over text for a while\nburnt toastwhat the fuck are you in witness protection for???\ndiscount icarussometimes i forget that none of you watch the news, and then i\u2019m painfully reminded every single time\nburnt toastwhat the fuck is that supposed to mean\nare you being targeted by the yakuza or something\ndiscount icarusyou know what\nclose enough\nlet\u2019s go with that\ni\u2019m being targeted by the yakuza\nburnt toastwhat the fuck hawks\ntragic backstory unlocked @hawksofficiali went to my first two therapy sessions this week and i can already tell it\u2019s just going to basically be biweekly episodes of \u201ci didn\u2019t know that was trauma!\u201d\nmayu @ finals crunch @storyenchantedReplying to @hawksofficialhawks are you okay\ntragic backstory unlocked @hawksofficialReplying to @storyenchantedas i\u2019m slowly beginning to find out, no.\nFuyumiHey, Hawks\u2026\nHawksThis is about what\u2019s on the news, isn\u2019t it?\nFuyumiYeah, I just wanted to ask a question, if you don\u2019t mind.\nHawksI think I already know where this is going, but go ahead.\nFuyumiYou and Touya didn\u2019t go to school together, did you.\nTouya\u2019s \u201cboarding school\u201d was the Commission, wasn\u2019t it?\nHawksYeah. It was.\nFuyumiWould you mind if I asked you about Touya again?\nAbout what actually happened this time.\nHawks?\nHawksI\u2019ll call you. This won\u2019t be a great conversation to have over text.\n\u201cI call dibs on being on Kurogiri\u2019s team for the rest of fucking time,\u201d Dabi called as he burst back into the bar, desperately trying to ignore the rolling of his stomach. \u201cAnd I also motion that nobody except Compress is ever allowed to drive ever again.\u201d\n\u201cWe got back here alive, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Spinner muttered sullenly.\n\u201cBarely.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Kurogiri asked, smoothly interesting himself into the conversation to prevent a fight from breaking out. Dabi raised an eyebrow, easily able to see what the bartender was doing, but shrugged and took a seat at the bar regardless, accepting the glass of whiskey that was set in front of him.\n\u201cWe managed to figure out where Abe was taken, so we can handle that tomorrow,\u201d Dabi murmured over the rim of the glass, taking a sip before he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a warehouse near the edge of Midori Ward - we\u2019ll either find him, a lead to his current location or, most likely, his grave.\u201d He took another sip of the whiskey, relishing in the burn down his throat. \u201cYou?\u201d\nCompress hummed. \u201cWe managed to get through the Nakamura Yakuza cell, but it turns out Shirai Touru and Ono Ayako have already been dead for a few years, so we\u2019ve crossed that lead off the list.\u201d\n\u201cHot take, but what if we just cut down the amount of yakuza leads we have to deal with?\u201d Dabi said. \u201cThey turn up dead like ninety-five percent of the time.\u201d\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s the other five percent that gives us a chance, and gets us closer to figuring this whole thing out,\u201d Kurogiri responded. Dabi grunted. The bartender shook his head, almost fondly, in response as he pulled up another glass and half-filled it with blood (from some mystery container he kept under the counter, and Dabi was vaguely afraid to ask where it came from) before topping it off with a Capri Sun. He stuck a tiny drink umbrella and silly straw in the glass before handing it to Toga, who beamed and started sipping at it happily. \u201cTwice, would you like anything to drink?\u201d\n\u201cJust water. I wanna get wasted!\u201d\n\u201cI also talked with Hawks,\u201d Dabi continued. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be available other than over text and occasional calls for a while since he got himself stuck in witness protection.\u201d\n\u201cHow the fuck does the number two hero get himself in witness protection?\u201d Shigaraki asked incredulously, looking up from his phone.\nDabi shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s being targeted by yakuza or something.\u201d\n\u201cDumbass,\u201d Shigaraki grunted. \u201cAnything else important I need to know now?\u201d\n\u201cDabi taught me a new word!\u201d Toga said brightly.\nAlmost immediately, Dabi could feel the unimpressed stares of both Kurogiri and Compress on him. He looked between the two of them incredulously. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t teach her anything bad.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s still only seventeen, so you should all be watching what you say around her,\u201d Kurogiri reprimanded.\n\u201cYou say this as you serve alcoholic drinks in front of her,\u201d Dabi muttered sullenly into his glass.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad word!\u201d Toga whined. \u201cIt was a big, fancy word! I even know how to use it in a sentence!\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Compress intoned interestedly.\n\u201cMm-hm!\u201d She grinned. \u201cHere: Tomura looks dilapidated!\u201d\nDabi snorted whiskey out through his nose.\nHAWKS ANNOUNCED NEW NO.1 HEROBy Matsumoto Chie\n\n Amongst all the chaos and scandal of the past several months, it was almost surprising to realize that the first Billboard Chart of the year was released this week. In a shocking, yet still somewhat unsurprising turn of events, Hawks has gone up a rank to become the new No.1 hero, while Endeavor falls back down to No.2. Hawks has broken the record for youngest No.1 hero, achieving the rank at age 23, beating out the previous record-holder, All Might, who achieved the rank at age 24.\n\n\n Not only does Hawks comfortably claim the lead in almost every popularity poll, but his case rate this season has been through the roof, so despite having to take the past three weeks off, as he is in witness protection, he still managed to snag the No.1 spot. \n\n\n Hawks was unable to join any journalist or television host for a traditional post-billboard interview, but he did have this to say on Twitter: \n\n\u201cI want to thank everybody who has supported me this past season, and also declare how proud I am of my fellow heroes for how much we\u2019ve stepped up as an institution these past few months [...] Faith in heroes has wavered, and everybody has been doing their best to show that we are still reliable. I\u2019ve never seen a season before where I\u2019ve seen so many heroes out there, not caring about fame or popularity, just trying to save as many people as they can. I know that sounds a bit hypocritical coming from me, of all people, but it\u2019s true. Rescuing people and knowing that I\u2019m able to make them feel safe is what makes this job worth it to me [...]\u201d  (Read the full thread here) \nOther notable changes in the rankings since the last billboard include Miruko just barely getting ahead of Edgeshot for the No.4 spot, and Ryuukyuu reclaiming No.9. Gang Orca has\u2026 Read more\n\u201cOh, hey Tsunagu,\u201d Keigo greeted as he opened the door, stepping aside to allow the hero in. \u201cLemme guess, you\u2019re my babysitter of the day?\u201d\nTsunagu turned, and while Keigo wasn\u2019t able to see half his face, he still very clearly got the disappointed stare. \u201cSecurity detail, Hawks.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d he responded flippantly, closing the door behind him. \u201cJust figured if I\u2019m gonna die, might as well have fun while it lasts, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\u201cHawks-\u201d\n\u201cYou can call me Keigo if you want,\u201d he interrupted, already making his way into the kitchen, continuing to cube the chicken breast he\u2019d pulled out of the fridge for stir fry.\nTsunagu paused. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nKeigo shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re like, one of three\u2014maybe ten, depending on what constitutes a \u2018friend\u2019\u2014friends that I have, and I\u2019m including my intern in that count. Go nuts. Just not on social media or on the streets.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. But, Keigo, you can\u2019t be so flippant about your safety,\u201d he said in that \u2018I\u2019m concerned about you and will proceed to shove my care at you until you accept it\u2019 tone of his. Keigo sighed, glancing up at the hero as he took a seat on the other side of the counter, watching him work. He set down the knife and wiped his hands off on a towel, leaning forward to set his elbows on the counter.\n\u201cI am taking this seriously,\u201d Keigo started, letting his face fall flat. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014used to it, I suppose. I grew up in the Commission, I always knew that this was a possibility. They don\u2019t like loose ends; they want the hero system to appear as secure and strong as possible, and if taking out a few people can prevent anarchy? Well, they\u2019ll do it.\u201d He sighed, blowing a stray bang out of his face. \u201cI\u2019ve been distancing myself from the Commission recently\u2014before all of this ever happened. I knew that there was a risk that they\u2019d see me getting too rebellious and decide to cut their losses with me, try and prevent something like what\u2019s happening right now.\u201d Keigo stood back up and shrugged, picking up the knife to continue his work. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that this might happen. Albeit, I thought I\u2019d make it a few more years before it did. The only difference now is that other people know about it.\u201d\nA silence fell between them, stretching on for a few moments too long. Keigo glanced up, taking stock of Tsunagu\u2019s stricken look before he finally seemed to find the words for a response.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just concerning to see you joke about your life,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us care about you, and we\u2019re not used to it, so it\u2019s harder for us to find anywhere near as much amusement in the situation as you do.\u201d\nKaigo gave him a blithe smile. \u201cWell, I never claimed to have healthy coping mechanisms.\u201d\nTsunagu gave an amused huff of air. \u201cI never implied you did.\u201d\n\u201cShove off, I only just started therapy. Gimme a few months, I\u2019m gonna rock your world, blow you away with how healthy my coping mechanisms are.\u201d\nTsunagu laughed, and Keigo grinned, counting it as a win.\n\u201cBut seriously, Tsunagu, Jest Beanist, father figure I never had, light of my life-\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d\n\u201c-if I do die, I want you to promise one thing for me.\u201d\nHe could practically see the other biting his tongue to keep himself from saying something about being negative, but after a moment, he nodded.\n\u201cBe the flower boy at Rumi\u2019s wedding, it\u2019d be fucking hilarious.\u201d\n \u201cKeigo.\u201d  And  there  was the exasperated tone he was so used to hearing out of the fiber hero.\nHe cackled. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s funny! You promised me, I\u2019ll even put it in my will to make sure it happens. I want to see it recorded and a video of it left for me to enjoy for the rest of my afterlife.\u201d\nTsunagu sighed, rolling his eyes fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die. I\u2019ll make sure of it if only so I  don\u2019t  have to do that.\u201d\nKeigo laughed. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to tell Rumi we\u2019re going with plan B.\u201d\n\u201cPlan B?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re gonna ask All Might to be the flower boy. Guy\u2019s a real sweetheart, he wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t torment him like that,\u201d Tsunagu groaned, rubbing his forehead tiredly.\n\u201cWho\u2019s tormenting him? We\u2019re just asking if he\u2019d like to have a role at her wedding.\u201d\n\u201cYou know exactly what I mean.\u201d\nKeigo\u2019s laughter was cut off by the jingle from his phone. Pausing to set the knife down again, he wiped his hands off before picking up the device, glancing at the screen to check who was calling.\n Incoming call\u2026   back alley magic man\n\n Compress. \n\n\u201cSorry, I need to take this,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cPrivate call\u2014I\u2019ll be in my bedroom.\u201d At the conflicted look on the other hero\u2019s face, Keigo rolled his eyes and floated a feather over to him, tucking it behind the man\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m about to get murked, okay?\u201d he called over his shoulder as he padded away.\n\n \u201cKeigo.\u201d \n\nAtsuhiro startled as the door to the bar burst open, Twice, Toga, and Spinner flooding in with clear panic, and Dabi\u2019s limp, wet body held between them. He was already out of his seat and guiding them to set the unconscious man down on the couch before he could even think about it.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kurogiri asked, joining the group by Atsuhiro\u2019s side. Shigaraki wasn\u2019t joining the rest of them in crowding around the couch, but he noted the younger man carefully watching the commotion out of the corner of his eye.\nSpinner helped Atsuhiro wrestle Dabi out of his muddy jacket as he talked. \u201cThere was a gang camping outside the warehouse, we got into a fight, and one of them managed to whack Dabi in the head. Knocked him unconscious and he fell into the lake. Twice fished him out, and he was still breathing so we didn\u2019t have to do any CPR. He hasn\u2019t woken up, though, and there\u2019s all sorts of gunk on him.\u201d\nAtsuhiro could see where the worry was coming from\u2014Dabi already had unknown amounts of possible head trauma, and he could easily spy what must have been mud from the lake bed in the seams of his scars and healthy skin.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he cursed under his breath. \u201cWe need to strip him, see where the infection risk is at. Twice, go get some clean clothes from his room. Toga, medical supplies.\u201d\n\u201cOn it!\u201d the two chimed in unison, dashing off to do their assigned tasks.\nKurogiri wordlessly warped towels into his hands, crouching down beside Dabi and gently scrubbing him dry as Spinner and Atsuhiro peeled his wet clothes off. Luckily, it appeared that the scars on Dabi\u2019s legs had been spared by his habit of wearing leather pants no matter the weather. When Toga and Twice reappeared, Atsuhiro simply poured hydrogen peroxide over those seams while Kurogiri kept Toga turned around until they slipped clean boxers and sweatpants onto him.\nThey left the shirt off, but while his lower half had been spared, Dabi\u2019s thin cotton shirt had been every bit as useless against the mud as his pants had been effective.\n\u201cHow the fuck do we keep him from getting infected?\u201d Spinner asked, biting at his nails.\n\u201cIs the more immediate concern the hit to the head he hasn\u2019t woken up from or the very real infection risk?\u201d Twice asked, wringing his hands together, Toga vibrating with nervous energy at his side. \u201cLet him rot, for all I care!\u201d\n\u201cCall Hawks,\u201d Shigaraki\u2019s raspy voice floated over from where he sat in a cushioned chair, DS held up to his face. \u201cHeroes get EMT training or something, probably has a better idea what to do than the rest of you dipshits.\u201d\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s do that,\u201d Spinner agreed breathlessly, turning back to the prone man on the couch.\nAtsuhiro fished his phone out of his pocket, handing it to Toga. \u201cCall Hawks, put him on speakerphone.\u201d\nToga nodded, and they all waited in tense silence as the phone rang once, twice, three times\u2026 just as it was about to ring out-\n\n \u201cHello?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d Spinner muttered.\n\u201cWe have a situation,\u201d Atsuhiro started.\n \u201cNot sure if you\u2019ve heard, but I literally cannot leave my apartment without a police escort.\u201d  He could practically  hear  Hawks rolling his eyes.\n\u201cYou have EMT certification, right?\u201d\nThere was a beat of silence.\n \u201cWho\u2019s hurt?\u201d  he asked, voice serious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Dabi.\u201d Atsuhiro looked to Spinner, who took his cue to explain what happened.\n\u201cHe got hit in the head, knocked unconscious, and there\u2019s a ton of mud in his seams.\u201d\n \u201cOh, just go for the two worst problems you could cause, why don\u2019t you?\u201d  they could hear Hawks mutter before he spoke louder.  \u201cAlright, Spinner, I need you to stabilize Dabi\u2019s head\u2014keep it perfectly in line with his spine, don\u2019t let it move any more than I assume it already has. Compress, I need you to tell me who\u2019s there, and what medical supplies you have. Need to know what I\u2019m working with.\u201d \n\u201cThe entire League is here. For medical supplies, we don\u2019t have much more than a basic first aid kit.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, Kurogiri and Toga - I need you to go rob a hospital and a pharmacy. I\u2019m texting you a list of what you need to pick up now.\u201d  Almost directly on cue, Kurogiri\u2019s phone buzzed, who glanced at it before nodding and quickly ushering Toga off to leave.\n \u201cTwice, if there\u2019s any latex gloves or medical masks in the base, go get them and bring them to Compress.\u201d  Twice chirped an affirmative before running off.  \u201cCompress, I\u2019m putting you in charge of direct treatment\u2014I\u2019m assuming you have fairly steady hands, for all those magic tricks you do?\u201d \n\u201cOf course,\u201d Atsuhiro responded, allowing himself a flicker of pride for the recognition of his skills before refocusing on the situation at hand.\n\n \u201cGreat. Spinner, I need you to tell me if there\u2019s any discoloration around Dabi\u2019s eyes, any fluid leaking from his nose?\u201d \n\nSpinner paused for a second, looking down directly at Dabi\u2019s face before responding. \u201cThere\u2019s no discoloration apart from his scars, and nothing's leaking out of his nose.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, that\u2019s good news,\u201d  Hawks said, a note of relief in his voice that Atsuhiro himself felt.  \u201cIt\u2019s likely that he doesn\u2019t have any major brain injury, but if he starts to throw up or gag, you\u2019ll need to turn his head and body on its side as one, keeping it in line with his spine. I still need you to check for a concussion, I\u2019m texting you instructions on how to do that now.\u201d \n\u201cRight,\u201d Spinner responded, dutifully taking out his phone and beginning to follow whatever guide Hawks had sent him.\n\u201cIs he gonna die?\u201d Shigaraki called in the slight lull.\nHawks paused before answering.  \u201cIf we do this right, it\u2019s very unlikely, and he could make a full recovery in a few weeks.\u201d \n\u201cHe better not,\u201d Shigaraki muttered under his breath, sinking deeper into the armchair. \u201cHate to have wasted this much time on a party member only for him to die.\u201d\nHawks huffed out a short laugh.  \u201cCompress, I\u2019m going to give you a rundown of what I\u2019ll need you to do, and I\u2019ll stay on the line to walk you through it as soon as soon as Kurogiri and Toga get back.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Atsuhiro promised solemnly, stilling himself to listen carefully as Hawks began to talk.\n\n \u201cThis might get pretty bloody, but here\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna go down: anywhere there\u2019s mud or dirt, you\u2019re going to need to pull out his staples. Throw them into the trash when you do that, there\u2019s no reusing them.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said, nodding along even though he and Hawks couldn't see each other. He inclined his head in thanks as Twice reappeared, handing over the gloves and masks Hawks had told him to fetch.\n\n \u201cActually, before you do any of that\u2014there\u2019s enough infection risk as there is, so you\u2019re going to go into the kitchen and wash your hands while I keep talking, then you\u2019re going to put on two layers of gloves and a mask. Make sure your hair is securely out of the way before you do that.\u201d \n\nAtsuhiro stood up to do as requested, pinning his dark hair out of the way with some barrettes Toga had left lying around. Twice picked up his phone, trailing dutifully behind him so that Hawks could continue giving his instructions.\n \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to gently pull the seams open, and be careful about it, I don\u2019t know how strong they are without the staples, which is where this could get messy, and you\u2019re gonna wash the dirt and mud away with whatever bottled water you have lying around.\u201d  Atsuhiro nodded absently, rinsing the soap off his hands and drying them before beginning to pull on the gloves and mask.  \u201cThen, you\u2019re gonna take some sterile wipes and go over it, making  absolutely sure  that you\u2019ve got them completely clean. Then, go over the entire seam and surrounding area with disinfectant. Toga and Kurogiri should also be coming back with some medical staplers, and you\u2019re going to use those to staple his skin back together.\u201d \n\u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d Atushiro asked as he headed back to where Dabi and Spinner were. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to criticize your knowledge, I\u2019m just worried.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d  Hawks sighed,  \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I get it. I didn\u2019t exactly go to med school, so this definitely isn\u2019t perfect advice. I\u2019m just doing the best I can with what I know. But in case there is still a chance of infection, that\u2019s why I\u2019m having Kurogiri and Toga stop at a pharmacy; we\u2019re gonna be sticking Dabi on as much amoxicillin as we can safely give him for a few weeks.\u201d \n\u201cHey, Hawks?\u201d Spinner interrupted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be showing any signs of a concussion or anything.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence.\n\n \u201cThe only response he\u2019s had to getting hit in the head is being knocked out? No head wound, no spinal fluid, no concussion, no nothing?\u201d \n\nSpinner shrugged. \u201cAs far as I can tell, yeah. Pretty much.\u201d\n\n \u201cI really wonder how the fuck he has amnesia when his skull is apparently made out of fucking steel.\u201d \n\nattack cucco @hawksofficialmy therapist: *laughs at a joke i made*me, to myself: this is great. i\u2019m going to get a good grade in therapy, something that is both normal to want and possible to achieve-\npetra rabbit @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficialscale of 1-10, 1 being i can make fun of you for it, 10 being i need to tag jeanist into the conversation, how concerned should i be about this tweet\nattack cucco @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficialdon\u2019t worry, i know my therapist sees my twitter so i\u2019m definitely gonna hear about this. think of these tweets as an unsubtle cry for help to prep her for our next session.\npetra rabbit @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficialstill concerning, but also clever and kinda funny\n\ud83c\udf38moriko\ud83c\udf38 @pepperbrandyReplying to @hawksofficialhonestly, seeing the no1 hero talk so openly about mental health and therapy, and working to normalize talking about it makes me so happy\n\u201cGuess who\u2019s still fucking alive?\u201d\u2019 Dabi announced as he came through Kurogiri\u2019s portal, with a fresh bill of health from whatever sketchy underground clinic they'd just come from. He hadn't bothered to check.\n\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he heard Shigaraki mutter under his breath.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s your favorite burnt bacon bitch, back at it again.\u201d\n\u201cDabi!\u201d Toga cheered in excitement, her head popping up over the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive!\u201d Twice joined in, popping up next to her. \u201cI wish you died!\u201d\n\u201cHealth risk extraordinaire is here to stay,\u201d Dabi called out monotonously, the portal closing behind him. \u201cWhat the fuck are we doing now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we  were  figuring out our next plan of attack,\u201d Shigaraki snapped. \u201cSit down, we\u2019re doing some troubleshooting; there\u2019s gotta be a glitch in the system or something.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Dabi asked, throwing himself into a plush armchair with a raised brow, swinging his legs over the arm. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThe heroes Hawks is working with are almost done with their investigation, and we\u2019re almost done with  ours,  and we still haven\u2019t found a  single  clue about your identity. That\u2019s the chances of that?\u201d\n\u201cPretty low,\u201d Spinner offered. Shigaraki snapped his fingers and pointed at him, continuing to talk.\n\u201cExactly. So, we need to figure out what the fuck\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you suggest we do, genius? Not much we can do except put up \u2018please call if you know this person\u2019 posters for me like I\u2019m a runaway dog or something.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shit plan, of course we\u2019re not doing that,\u201d Shigaraki said, waving his hand at Dabi dismissively. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be bringing forward what I proposed back in January.\u201d\nDabi stared at Shigaraki for a moment, raking through his mind to try and figure out what he was referencing. Surprisingly, the memory came to the forefront of his mind easily, and his eyes widened as he realized what was being suggested. \u201cShigaraki, no-\u201d\n\u201cUnless you have a better idea?\u201d Shigaraki asked him scathingly.\nDabi opened and closed his mouth before crossing his arms sullenly.\n\u201cGreat. We\u2019re in agreement then.\u201d\n\u201cI just want it to be known,\u201d Dabi said angrily, \u201cthat this plan is going to absolutely ruin my chances of getting laid, so if it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m gonna murder you.\u201d\n\u201cNobody cares about you getting your dick wet with Hawks. Now shut up and focus, we need to start planning.\u201d\nphoenix wright @hawksofficialconcept: i punch my old handler when i see him in court today\nphoenix wright @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialfollow-up: i also punch my egg donor when i see her in court next week\ntried to put me on the cover of vogue @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficialdo it\nBest Jeanist @bestjeanistofficialReplying to @hawksofficialAs a hero, I cannot professionally condone violence. However, I will refrain from condemning it in this particular case.\ntried to put me on the cover of vogue @mirukoofficialReplying to @bestjeanistofficial and @hawksofficialyou heard jean-boy, hawks, beat their asses\n\u201cThere are a few things we need to go over before I can let you go for the weekend,\u201d Shouta announced blandly, relishing in the crushed looks some of his students gave him, eyes flicking back and forth between him and the clock. \u201cFirst of all: the final decision has been reached on how the new age limits in the Hero Training Restriction Act are going to impact you.\u201d\nHe watched their shoulders rise and tense in almost complete unison.\n\u201cThanks to Article Thirty-Nine of the Constitution, the retroactive application of laws is forbidden, so you will all, indeed, be the last hero class to graduate U.A. High School.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, in which Shouta could have heard a pin drop. He watched the gears turn in his students\u2019 brains, the pieces clicking together and their eyes brightening. The class started to let out a deafening cheer, some of them standing up and jumping around with euphoria. Shouta was feeling generous, so he allowed them to enjoy themselves for a few seconds before activating his quirk.\nThey were all silent and back in their seats within a few moments, though many still had wide, beaming smiles on their faces. Excitement. Disgusting.\n\u201cAll of you turned in forms to leave campus tomorrow. They\u2019ve all been approved, however, if you\u2019re planning to go to either the TPD or HPSC protests, which I suspect most of you are,\u201d a solid half of his class averted their eyes guiltily, while the rest gave their best shot at a poker face, none succeeding apart from Todoroki, \u201ctry to not get arrested. Stay out of trouble, and you can all protest to your heart's content. Dismissed.\u201d\nShouta sighed as the students flooded out of the classroom, already loudly chattering on their way back to the dorms. He mentally prepared himself for the next day. Despite the warning he gave, he  knew  that he was going to have to go pick up at least one of them from the police department. He  knew. \n\u201cI got the blocky markers, Momo\u2019s got the poster board!\u201d Jirou called as she and Yaoyorozu came into the common room, arms full of the aforementioned supplies. Izuku perked up, along with much of the rest of 1-A. \u201cWho\u2019s ready to unlock their inner punk and get ready to protest the government?\u201d\nIzuku laughed as they spread out the supplies along the floor, having moved the couches aside to work on the floor in front of the TV. Tokoyami had claimed the spot closest to the screen, and they let him without much fuss; Hawks\u2019 case against the HPSC was set to continue in a few minutes.\n\u201cHey, Todoroki-kun,\u201d Izuku greeted, sitting down next to his friend, who tilted his head slightly in greeting. \u201cExcited?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d he responded blandly, tapping the capped end of his marker against the poster in front of him. Izuku took a moment to observe Todoroki\u2019s tense posture and pinched brow. It was always hard to try and get a read on how the split-haired teen was doing. He didn\u2019t express much with his face and was fairly quiet, and his words were mostly neutral when he did speak, but\u2026\n\u201cAre you okay, Todoroki-kun?\u201d Izuku asked in a lower voice, using the chatter of the other students around them to mask his question. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a little\u2014off, I guess, the past two months.\u201d Todoroki blinked lethargically and stared at him for a long, long moment. Izuku felt his cheeks turn red as he flustered. \u201cNot that you have to tell me or anything, I don\u2019t want to intrude on your business, I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay and-\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Todoroki said, turning his gaze back to the poster board. \u201cHawks was at Touya\u2019s funeral.\u201d Any other person would have warmed up before getting to that, Izuku thought. Todoroki, on the other hand, was blunt, almost to a fault. \u201cWe always thought he was a school friend of his or something.\u201d\nIzuku paused, processing the statement before his eyes widened. \u201cOh.\u201d\nTodoroki hummed flatly in response. \u201cFuyumi has his contact information, apparently. He\u2019s her fianc\u00e9\u2019s friend, so-\u201d\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s getting married?\u201d Izuku asked. \u201cGive her my congratulations!\u201d Todoroki nodded. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt, uh\u2014you were saying?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s been quiet since the news came out, so I think she\u2019s talked to him about it. She hasn\u2019t shared what she knows with me or Natuso, however.\u201d\nIzuku was quiet for a moment, mulling over the information in his mind. \u201cI think Hawks is supposed to be giving testimony on others in the program today before the final verdict is made.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nThey lapsed into silence, apart from a brief exchange when Todoroki asked for a suggestion as to what he should put on his poster.\nSoon enough, Tokoyami was turning up the volume on the TV as coverage of the HPSC trial continued. The chatter in the room died, and they all watched with rapt attention, the only other sound in the room the occasional squeak of a marker.\nHawks\u2019 face was flat as he answered question after question. As the primary witness, the only documented survivor of the Legacy Program who still retained all memories, he\u2019d probably spent more time on the stand than all the other parties involved in the case combined.\n\n \u201cWe have one participant of the program left\u2014it was the most redacted file and gave us little information other than their hero name. Are you able to share information with the court about \u2018Supernova?\u2019\u201d \n\nHawks\u2019 face lost even more emotion at the question, if it were possible.  \u201cYes.\u201d \n\n \u201cDo you know Supernova\u2019s legal name?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cTodoroki Touya.\u201d \n\nThe shocked silence of the courtroom was matched only by the shocked silence of the common room. Every head slowly turned to stare at Todoroki, whose marker was creaking under his grip. A fierce glare from under his bangs had them all turning back towards the television, although Izuku was easily able to spot them taking glances back at him. He slowly laid a hand on Todoroki\u2019s shoulder, who simply hunched in on himself, but his eyes remained glued to the screen as the questions continued.\n\n \u201cAnd how did you meet Todoroki-san?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cHe was assigned to be my roommate after Saskia killed himself.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cWhat was your relationship with Todoroki-san?\u201d \n\nIzuku felt Todoroki tense under his fingers, shoulders drawing close to his ears.\nHawks\u2019 face hardened, and his words came out in a clipped voice, contrasting the flat monotone he\u2019d answered the rest of the questions in.  \u201cWe were involved.\u201d \nThere was another ringing silence.\n\n \u201cHow long did you know Todoroki-san?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cAlmost three years, from when we were introduced to when he died.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cIs the court able to presume that his training and the treatment he was given was similar to that of the other Legacy Program trainees?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cHow did Todoroki-san die?\u201d \n\nIzuku wrapped Todoroki in a hug, letting the other boy tuck his head into his shoulder as Hawks answered, again in a terse tone.  \u201cTouya was an odd case in the program\u2014he was often sent home on the weekends. He didn\u2019t come back one week, and I was informed a few days later that he had self-immolated at home.\u201d \nTodoroki\u2019s shoulders shook slightly, and Izuku elected to not comment on the slight dampness of the collar of his shirt.\n\n \u201cHow did the Commission react upon hearing news of his death?\u201d \n\nHawks let out a tired sigh, sagging deep into his chair, something pained shining in his eyes.  \u201cThey let me go to his funeral. After that, I was given a psych evaluation to ensure I could continue training at the 'desired pace,' and then they generally just pretended he never existed, like most of the other trainees. I wasn\u2019t assigned a roommate after him, though. They didn\u2019t want me growing \u2018attached\u2019 again.\u201d \n\n \u201cThank you. I have no more questions for the witness.\u201d \n\nThere was quiet in both the court and the dorm as a break was called after the almost two-hour testimony.\nTodoroki\u2019s chest shook slightly as he took several deep breaths before lifting his from Izuku\u2019s shoulder, his right eye noticeably red, while his left was disguised by the surrounding scar tissue. \u201cTodoroki-kun?\u201d Izuku asked slowly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said blankly after taking a few moments to smooth his face over again, though his voice grated ever-so-slightly. He turned his head to look at the rest of the quiet common room, all their classmates (except Kacchan, but he was reading something on his phone, anyway) having turned their heads to pretend they weren\u2019t eavesdropping. \u201cIf we leave early tomorrow,\u201d Todoroki began in a louder voice, catching the attention of everyone, \u201cwe\u2019ll have time to get breakfast at Girandole on Endeavor\u2019s credit card.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that place hella expensive?\u201d Sero asked.\n\u201cYes. If anybody needs to buy anything at all tomorrow, I\u2019ll pay for it, no questions asked.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cHow much spite is fueling your decisions right now?\u201d\n\u201cAs I am currently unable to put my father six feet underground, a lot. Any more questions?\u201d\nAfter a few moments, Kaminari spoke again.\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready to go do some fucking anarchy tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cAw, hell yeah!\u201d Sero and Mina cheered, sharing a group high-five with the blonde. Izuku laughed at the display as chatter picked back up in the room.\nHe watched Todoroki out of the corner of his eye. He seemed a little lighter. Izuku wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing was the healthiest way to deal with what he had just learned, but he seemed happier, at least. Izuku allowed himself a small smile.\n\u201cThis is such a fucking bad idea,\u201d Dabi repeated for the nth time.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, you\u2019re starting to sound like Spinner,\u201d Shigaraki snapped, both ignoring the offended exclamation from the mutant in question. \u201cKurogiri, Compress, you two know what to do?\u201d\nAn exasperated air imitated from the two adults. \u201cOf course, Shigaraki,\u201d Compress sighed.\n\u201cI understand, Tomura,\u201d and wow, Kurogiri was disappointed. Not that shame was something to stop Shigaraki from doing what he wanted, but it comforted Dabi some to know that the bartender wasn\u2019t happy with the plan either.\nuncaged birb @hawksofficialthe best part of winning the case against the hpsc, apart from finally getting released from witness protection this week, is having absolutely nobody to stop me from donating an obscene amount of money to the hpsc protest bail fund #hpscprotest\nuncaged birb @hawksofficialReplying to @hawksofficialspeaking of, if you\u2019re feeling as anarchical as i am and have money to spare, feel free to donate to the bail fund yourself (bit.ly/5cdb27e). if you can\u2019t donate, no worries! there\u2019s a petition you can sign to get the hpsc shut down (bit.ly/dec08c).\ndiscount kangaroo @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficialcan\u2019t decide if i\u2019m surprised or not that you\u2019ve become even more chaotic now\nuncaged birb @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficiali\u2019m tired of being nice. it\u2019s time to go apeshit.\nafter i get out of witness protection.\ndiscount kangaroo @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficiallmao. i\u2019ll protest enough for both of us til you get out chicken boy\ntsukuyomi @ drowning the hpsc in the void @dementiaravenwayReplying to @hawksofficialmy entire class is going to the protest today, and knowing some of them, thank you for paying their bail\nchargebolt go yeet the hpsc @irlpikachuReplying to @dementiaravenway and @hawksofficialwhat\u2019s that supposed to mean???\n\ud83d\udc7ealien queen\ud83d\udc7e @terrestialxenomorphReplying to @irlpikachu, @dementiaravenway and @hawksofficialyou wanna go, tokoyami???\ntsukuyomi @ drowning the hpsc in the void @dementiaravenwayReplying to @terrestialxenomorph, @irlpikachu and @hawksofficiali\u2019m simply stating facts, not looking for a fight. if i were, you\u2019re both sitting across from me, and i just watched kaminari try to shock bakugou with static electricity, forgetting that he sweats nitroglycerin, and i beat ashido at the sports festival. i\u2019m not that worried.\n\ud83c\udfb6earphone jack\ud83c\udfb6 @ anarchy @heartbeatoctavesReplying to @dementiaravenway and 3\u00a0moreunsurprised tokoyami is the first one to commit murder.\ntsukuyomi @ drowning the hpsc in the void @dementiaravenwayReplying to @heartbeatoctaves and 3 morefacts, my weapon of choice. their silence speaks volumes.\nuncaged birb @hawksofficialReplying to @dementiaravenway and 3 more*wipes away a tear* my intern is so talented\nU.A. STUDENT REPORTED MISSING AFTER HPSC PROTESTBy Kamiya Moriko\nU.A. hero course student Midoriya Izuku has been reported missing by his classmates after today's protests against the HPSC. Due to the events at and attacks on U.A. this past year, authorities and school officials are treating the incident as a kidnapping. The school\u2019s Class 1-A had gone on a group outing to the protest, but by early afternoon, their day had been effectively derailed. The first to notice Midoriya\u2019s absence\u2026 Read more\n\u201c...he wants to know what the fuck you think you\u2019re doing,\u201d said a low, raspy voice as Izuku slowly came back to consciousness. He slowly blinked his eyes open as another, familiar voice responded.\n\u201cTell him it\u2019s none of his fucking business, I\u2019m in charge, I make the decisions.\u201d Izuku\u2019s head snapped up as the first voice repeated the message.  Shigaraki.  His eyes scanned the area quickly\u2014he was in a nondescript warehouse, fantastic\u2014and quickly landed on Shigaraki and  Dabi,  that was the other voice. The rest of the League didn\u2019t seem to be around.\nHe reached for the pool of power that came with One for All and\u2014he was wearing quirk suppressors, he couldn\u2019t feel it! There went Escape Plan A.\nDabi had his phone up to his ear and was listening to someone Izuku couldn\u2019t hear with a tired expression. \u201cHe says you better let the kid go or he\u2019s coming down to scalp you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, tell him-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your fucking messenger boy! You two wanna argue, do it on your own time!\u201d he snapped, decisively hanging up on the call and glaring at Shigaraki as he did so.\nIzuku watched the proceedings with wide eyes.\nDabi quickly noticed him, and by extension, the fact that he was awake. He kicked Shigaraki in the shin and jerked his head in Izuku\u2019s direction.\nA moment of silence stretched between them before Izuku spoke.\n\u201cAre you gonna kill me?\u201d he asked hesitantly, anxious mind already jumping to the worst-case scenario.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shigaraki asked, looking confused. \u201cNo. You\u2019re a valuable NPC. Here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Izuku tensed as the villain stalked forward, leaning down towards his face\u2014if Shigaraki was trying to be intimidating, it was working and Izuku really wished he\u2019d stop. \u201cIf you can figure out who the fuck Dabi is, we\u2019ll let you go.\u201d And he stepped away, crossing his arms impatiently as the aforementioned villain appeared over Shigaraki\u2019s shoulder, a dark shadow behind him.\nIzuku blinked, trying to follow the logic of Shigaraki\u2019s statement. \u201cI\u2026\u201d he paused, running the words through his mind again. \u201cIs\u2026 is this like, some weird new torture method you\u2019re trying?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is with you and the stupid questions?\u201d Shigaraki snarled. \u201cWe\u2019re one-hundred percent serious about this, motherfucker can\u2019t remember who he is, and by God, we\u2019re gonna figure it out.\u201d\nIzuku attempted to process the situation. \u201cAre you saying that all those missing person cases you\u2019ve solved-\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit, were those on the news?\u201d Dabi asked. \u201cNice. Still maintaining a bit of notoriety even while on a break from villainy.\u201d\nIzuku gave the burned man an incredulous look, trying to figure out if he was messing with him or not. There wasn\u2019t any \u2018gotcha\u2019 coming, though, and Izuku briefly wondered if it was possible to have an aneurysm as a teenager. He let out a defeated sigh. \u201cHow do you expect me to do this?\u201d\nAnalysis, he could do that. Stave off the mind-melting puzzle that was whatever was going on with the League, and buy time for help to come.\nShigaraki snapped, and Dabi \u2018tch\u2019d and rolled his eyes, walking off to the side to bring out a rolling whiteboard, muttering what Izuku presumed to be insults under his breath. Izuku quickly scanned over the list of theories, organizing them in his head from most to least likely.\n\u201cI can already tell you the time-travel one probably isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come the fuck on.\u201d\n\u201cI told you so. More than once.\u201d\nIzuku ignored the exchange and kept running over the theories in his head. Black magic and demon were thrown aside, Zodiac killer looked interesting, clone experiment gone wrong had potential, escaped-\n\n BOOM \n\nKatsuki was pissed.\nHe knew, on a certain level, that most people would assume that was nothing out of the ordinary. However, his general baseline level was \u2018agitated\u2019. Right then and there, he was pissed.\nBest Jeanist had gone and let himself catch the flu at the very end of flu season, so Katsuki\u2019d been stuffed with Deku, the Half n\u2019 Half Bastard, and the flaming garbage bag for the past week for his work-study while Jeanist recovered. And then, when the class had gone to blow up the bullshit government, the shitty nerd had gone and gotten himself  kidnapped,  like the dumbass he was.\nAizawa, after the shitshow that was the first semester, had them all install trackers on their phones when they moved into the dorms - the GPS wasn\u2019t the most accurate, but by the time they\u2019d all headed to their work-studies on Monday, they\u2019d narrowed down Deku\u2019s location, and they were all moving out to comb the area. Katsuki would have thought that kidnappers would have a little more taste than a field of run-down, shitty warehouses, but apparently not. Reminded him to not hold too much faith in anybody else\u2019s intelligence.\nAnd that, in general, was how Katsuki found himself scowling, walking next to Icy Hot, trailing behind Endeavor as they scoured their section of the search area.\n\u201cBuilding\u2019s fucking empty!\u201d he shouted over his shoulder, kicking the door to yet another warehouse shut. He vaguely heard Endeavor grunt in acknowledgment, but he was already walking to the next building over. Suddenly-\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve found something,\u201d Half n\u2019 Half Bastard\u2019s bland voice floated over. Katsuki turned his head over his shoulder, catching sight of the other teen turning back to a closed warehouse to press his ear against the door.\nHe and Endeavor quickly made their way over as Icy Hot took a few steps away from the building, turning to face them. Before the hot garbage could even open his mouth, Icy Hot started speaking. \u201cI can hear voices inside, but I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying. One of them sounded like Midoriya, though.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Endeavor intoned, eyes scanning the warehouse. Katsuki crossed his arms impatiently, shifting his weight to his other foot as his scowl deepened. \u201cDynaMight,\u201d he suddenly spoke, and Katsuki sharply turned his gaze to the large man.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll blow the door in so we can catch them by surprise.\u201d Katsuki felt a smirk cross his face. \u201cBoth of you, be prepared for combat. Depending on what we find inside, I\u2019ll give you further instructions.\u201d\nAs much as Katsuki hated to agree with Half n\u2019 Half on anything, he could feel the other rolling his eyes in time with him.\nStepping up to the warehouse door as the two dickheads he was stuck with stepped back, Katsuki cracked his knuckles and shook out his hands. Widening his stance and bracing his shoulders for the inevitable recoil. He stretched his palms out in front of him, felt his hands begin to heat, and-\n\n BOOM \n\nThe door buckled and caved in with the bright flash of an explosion, and Katsuki raced in, hearing two sets of footsteps following behind him. The dust cleared quickly and revealed the scene in the warehouse.\n\u201cShouto, rescue the hostage,\u201d Endeavor snapped. \u201cDynaMight, keep Shigaraki distracted, I\u2019ll deal with Dabi.\u201d\nThe two teens nodded in unison, and Katsuki felt a feral grin grow across his face as he raced in. Fight fire with fire, and the flakey-fuck couldn\u2019t disintegrate what he couldn\u2019t touch. Not a bad plan for a fucking asshole.\n\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Shigaraki screeched, glaring at Katsuki as he approached, before quickly dodging an explosion by ducking behind a whiteboard, covered in writing he didn\u2019t bother reading before blasting it away.\nKatsuki ignored the damn nerd\u2019s relieved cry of \u201cKacchan!\u201d from behind him, quickly followed by a surprised noise and Icy Hot\u2019s voice saying \u201cLet\u2019s go, Midoriya.\u201d Fucking idiot, always causing problems for the rest of them.\nShigaraki and Katuski rolled to the left in unison, barely avoiding getting singed by a burst of blue and orange flames. Shigaraki\u2019s head whipped around, narrowing in something over Katsuki\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take him!\u201d the manchild shrieked, throwing his hands in the air before dodging another explosion from Katsuki. Motherfucker was fast. \u201cWe need him to figure out who Dabi is!\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s movements faltered for the briefest of seconds before explosions continued to roar from his palms. \u201cFirst of all,  motherfucker,\u201d  he hissed out, getting oh-so deliciously close to landing an explosion in the asshole\u2019s face before he dodged, \u201cyou don\u2019t tell me what to do. Second of all, how fucking stupid are you? Dabi\u2019s Todoroki Touya, that\u2019s been fucking obvious for ages now, dipshit!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fucking bullshit!\u201d Hand Kink screeched back, arm shooting out and just barely missing Katsuki\u2019s face as he ducked. \u201cYou\u2019re a glitched NP-\u201d\nThe villain was cut off as Dabi flew backward into him, both of them stumbling over. Katsuki felt his current mood of \u2018pissed\u2019 start ticking up towards a strong \u2018murderous.\u2019\n\u201cYOU!\u201d he shouted, letting off another explosion. He knew his target was Shigaraki, but if he managed to get Discount Frankenstein\u2019s Monster in the crossfire as well? Even fucking better.\n\u201cWho the fuck is the pomeranian?\u201d Dabi called to Shigaraki.\nKatsuki felt his movements falter again. \u201cYou fucking kidnapped me, asshole!\u201d\nEndeavor appeared beside him, flames coating his hands as the four of them stood in a standoff.\nDabi\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cOh, no shit? You\u2019re the U.A. kid I kidnapped!\u201d he said, tone sounding as if he\u2019d just had a giant revelation. Katsuki felt his mind bluescreen. \u201cI was wondering about that. Toga said I\u2019d kidnapped somebody, I was starting to think she was shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cDabi,\u201d he heard Shigaraki hiss, registering the voice in a distant, absent sort of way. \u201cKurogiri\u2019s sending a portal\u2014we need to  go.\u201d \n\u201cFucking told you this entire plan was a waste of time.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s brain finally managed to reboot, and he saw  red. \nHe screeched incoherently as he launched himself at the two, barely missing blowing the Burnt Fuck Face\u2019s head off as the other villain grabbed his collar and yanked him out of the way and towards a misty purple portal just a few feet away. Katsuki quickly redirected, and blasted another powerful explosion off, just barely missing the two as they disappeared into the mist, and the portal disappeared.\nKatsuki screeched again, his hands popping with hundreds of tiny explosions. Suddenly, a hand landed on his shoulder, and he turned around, ready to blow Icy Hot\u2019s face off.  \u201cWhat the fuck is it?\u201d  he hissed.\nHalf n\u2019 Half\u2019s face remained blank, which only served to piss Katsuki off  more. \n\u201cWe succeeded. Flawless rescue mission.\u201d From anybody else, Katsuki  might  have interpreted the statement as praise, but the other teen\u2019s stupid ass voice only made it sound sarcastic. He growled, low in his throat. \u201cEndeavor\u2019s radioing it in. Police will be here soon, and they\u2019ll need to take your statement.\u201d\nKatsuki scowled, shrugging the cold hand off of his shoulder.\n\u201cMidoriya\u2019s fine, Bakugou.\u201d\n\u201cFucking  Deku,\u201d  he hissed, storming out of the warehouse, eyes zeroing in on the fucking asshole that caused the whole situation. Katsuki also became aware of the paramedics, police officers, and other heroes who looked at him as he exited the warehouse.\nFuck. Professional, he could do professional.\nHe stiffly walked over to where the shit nerd sat next to an ambulance, a bright orange shock blanket draped over his shoulders. The nerd looked up at him with his too fucking bright eyes. \u201cKacchan?\u201d he asked hesitantly.\nCalm calm  calm. \nKatsuki gripped Deku\u2019s shoulder, ignoring the startled and slightly pained squeak as he squeezed. Right in the moment, he didn\u2019t particularly care if he was gripping his shoulder too tight.\n\n Professional. \n\n\u201cSurprised you managed to play stupid long enough for us to bail your dumbass out,\u201d Katsuki ground out after a moment. The shitty nerd's face screwed up in confusion.\nFuck it, Best Jeanist and his lessons on professionalism could go suck a dick.\n\u201cNext heroics class, Deku,\u201d Katsuki hissed, \u201cI am going to  fucking murder you.\u201d \nSpinner startled as Kurogiri\u2019s phone went off, distracted from the soap opera that was Twice and Compress trying to keep Toga distracted enough so she didn\u2019t go off and try to bleed out the U.A. kid Shigaraki had taken.\nKurogiri took one glance at his phone and sighed, and Spinner was intrigued because it was his \u2018I told them this would be a bad idea, but I care too much to not bail them out' sigh. As the rest of the League was in the base, and Hawks was still stuck in witness protection, last he\u2019d heard-\nKurogiri suddenly opened a portal, and Spinner flinched back as an absolutely feral screech came ringing out from whatever was going on on the other side. Compress, Twice, and Toga also had their attention drawn to the portal as Shigaraki and Dabi came stumbling through, the tail end of an explosion licking at the long ends of their coats as the portal closed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d I tell you?\u201d Dabi asked Shigaraki, voice raspier than usual as both of them worked to catch their breath. \u201cFucking stupid plan. Didn\u2019t work, and I\u2019m not getting laid.\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck the hell off!\u201d Shigaraki snapped.\n\u201cI assume something went wrong?\u201d Kurogiri asked neutrally, stepping himself, as he always did, into their confrontation before it could get too far. He set down two glasses of whiskey on the bar, several seats apart. The two of them grumbled, glaring at each other as they each took their seats, but eventually, Dabi answered.\n\u201cHeroes found us pretty fast. We\u2019d barely had ten minutes to talk with the kid before the door got blown down.\u201d\n\u201cThat fucking Bakugou NPC is glitched!\u201d Shigaraki screeched, cutting in, slamming an empty glass back on the bar. Spinner blinked, surprised. Shigaraki didn\u2019t drink, most of the time, so it was an odd experience to watch him throw it back like that. \u201cSpouted some bullshit about Dabi being Todoroki Touya, which is the fucking stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d\n\u201cEven stupider than your own voice?\u201d Toga asked, plopping herself in a seat next to Shigaraki.\nHe screeched.\n\u201cAren\u2019t the Todoroki\u2019s Endeavor\u2019s family?\u201d Compress asked, taking another seat at the bar, he and Twice filling in the seats between Shigaraki and Dabi.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what makes it so fucking stupid!\u201d Shigaraki shouted, waving his hands around angrily.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve entertained some wilder theories, Tomura,\u201d Kurogiri reminded, refilling his glass.\n\u201cYeah, but this is some next level manga plot-line  bullshit!\u201d \n\u201cI think Dabi\u2019s broken,\u201d Twice suddenly interrupted, leaning across the counter to grab everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cHe seems fine to me!\u201d\nSpinner looked over at Dabi, who was staring blankly ahead with wide eyes, arm frozen with whiskey halfway to his lips.\n\u201cDabi?\u201d he asked hesitantly, nudging the man next to him.\n\u201cWe sure the brain trauma hasn\u2019t finally caught up with him?\u201d Shigaraki muttered over the rim of his glass.\nDabi blinked after a few more moments, looking down at the counter as he lowered the glass, running his other hand through his hair.\n\u201cHoly shit, that name actually sounds really familiar.\u201d\nShigaraki threw his half-full glass at the wall. \u201cYOU\u2019VE GOTTA BE  FUCKING KIDDING ME!\u201d \nShouto listened with attention as Midoriya gave his recounting of events, all of them having been ushered into a conference room along with Aizawa and several police officers.\n\u201c... and then Todoroki-kun grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the warehouse. He froze the quirk suppressors off of my wrists, and then I was taken over to an ambulance to be checked over.\u201d Midoriya shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can remember.\u201d\nThe police officer who was taking notes nodded, and stopped the voice recorder next to him. \u201cThank you, Midoriya-san.\u201d His gaze turned to Bakugou, whose arms were crossed and a fierce scowl was still etched across his face, still not having calmed down much from the fight.\nShouto wondered if it was tiring, being that angry all the time.\nThe police officer clicked a few buttons on the voice recorder, turned to a new sheet in his notepad, and began a new recording. \u201cCan you state your hero identification and civilian name for the record?\u201d\n\u201cDynaMight, Provisional ID Number two one zero one seven nine nine eight. Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d\n\u201cPlease recount the events surrounding the rescue of Midoriya Izuku to the best of your ability.\u201d\nShouto watched Bakugou\u2019s eye twitch at the mention of \u2018best of your ability,\u2019 but he ground his teeth and began speaking nonetheless. \u201cWe were checking out a bunch of empty warehouses, and like half an hour into that, Icy Hot calls us over because he heard voices from inside one of them. Apparently heard Deku\u2019s voice in there, so Endeavor had me blow down the door and be prepared to fight. Some of the League was there, so me and Endeavor head in to fight while Half n\u2019 Half got Deku outta there. So I was fighting the handy-man from the League, Shigaraki or whatever, and then all of a sudden Endeavor\u2019s worst son-\u201d\n\u201cI was taking Midoriya outside, though?\u201d Shouto suddenly interrupted in confusion, earning a dirty look from one of the officers. Bakugou gave him a confused look before rolling his eyes and moving on.\n\u201cNah, not you, though you do suck pretty hard. The oldest one. Anyway, he-\u201d\n\u201cNatsuo wasn\u2019t there either, Bakugou.\u201d And his father was the one to interrupt that time.\nBakugou gave the old man a look that Shouto  thought  was supposed to be incredulous, although it came out looking more disgusted than anything else. Then again, Bakugou looked disgusted when addressing other people in general.\n \u201cNo,  not him, dumbass,\u201d Bakugou retorted mockingly. \u201cThe other one, CEO of Hot Topic, has like forty face piercings? Touya, or whatever his name was. Anyway, Dabi-\u201d\nShouto felt his mind go blank, slowly and painfully connecting together the meaning behind Bakugou\u2019s words. He heard his father go still across the table, as well. Thankfully, so he didn\u2019t have to say anything, Aizawa interrupted.\n\u201cBakugou,\u201d he said, quickly cutting him off. \u201cAre you implying that Dabi is Todoroki Touya?\u201d\nEven the police officers had stopped to stare at the explosive teen, who was starting to look pissed off again.\n \u201cYes,\u201d  Bakugou said. \u201cObviously. I figured that out ages ago.  Anyway-\u201d \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Aizawa asked, ignoring the deepening scowl on the other teen\u2019s face at being interrupted again. Shouto was staring at him.\nTouya, alive? (Albeit as a villain, but still.  Alive.) \n\u201cI thought we all knew and we were being polite and not saying shit about it!\u201d Bakugou snapped, throwing his hands up in frustration.\n\u201cThen why are you bringing it up?\u201d Aizawa shot back, looking equally as annoyed with the situation as the two Todoroki\u2019s in the room struggled to digest the information.\n\u201cI\u2019m not good at being fucking polite!\u201d\nThe strangled noise Aizawa let out in response, Shouto felt, accurately represented his mental state at that moment.\nrobin hoodwhy the fuck are you all so silent suddenly\nteenage mutant ninja lizarduh\nrobin hood\u2018uh\u2019 doesn\u2019t keep shigaraki from getting scalped\nteenage mutant ninja lizardwe found a pretty promising lead on dabi\nwe\u2019ve just been checking it out\nrobin hoodi can\u2019t help if you all decide to ghost me\nhello?\n\n @everyone \n\noh you motherfuckers\n @mr. sandman  you\u2019re getting scalped the second i\u2019m out of witness protection\nchicken littleruuuummmmiiiiiiii\nhow did rescuing the ua kid go?\nbugs bunnyuh\nchicken littlehe\u2019s not dead is he\nbugs bunnyno, the little shit is fine\nchicken littleokay, that\u2019s great news\nnow what\u2019s the \u2018uh\u2019 about\nbugs bunnysome info came up about dabi form the league\nwe\u2019re trying to verify it rn\nchicken littleokay, you\u2019re really beating around the bush here\nwhat the fuck is wrong\nbugs bunnythat\u2019s kinda the problem\ni\u2019m not allowed to tell you until we can verify it, which is probably gonna take a while\ni\u2019m probably really stretching it telling you this much\nchicken littleam i allowed to be patched in on the case once i\u2019m out?\nbugs bunnyi don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna let that happen\nchicken littlewhat\u2019s going on rumi\nbugs bunnysorry keigo, im really not allowed to tell you\nKeigo huffed, turning his phone off and tossed it onto the coffee table, leaning back on the couch.\n\u2018You.\u2019 Not \u2018anybody.\u2019\nKeigo, contrary to popular belief, wasn\u2019t a fucking idiot. He\u2019d been on the other side of the situation before. They were worried he\u2019d have a personal bias about whatever they\u2019d discovered.\nHis sharp eyes glanced at the calendar hung up over the counter between the living room and the kitchen. One more day until he was out of witness protection. Four days until he was back on duty.\nHe ignored the pit in his stomach about what everything could mean.\nuncaged birb\u00a0@hawksofficialGUESS WHO JUST GOT OUT OF WITNESS PROTECTION\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Toga said, reading something on her phone as Twice fluttered about, Compress, Kurogiri, and Spinner watching on in amusement. Dabi had no idea where the hell Shigaraki could be. \u201cAll the movies I\u2019ve ever seen had something about being able to get over amnesia if you\u2019re reminded enough of what you forgot.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think movies are the pinnacle of psychological or medical knowledge,\u201d Dabi commented dryly.\n\u201cWell, it's worth a shot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Toga asked, waving her arms in frustration, cheeks puffing up in a pout. Dabi sighed and rolled his eyes, but waved his hand in a \u2018go ahead\u2019 gesture nonetheless. He heard Compress chuckle, and he shot a glare at the man, who held his hands up innocently.\nToga beamed.\n\u201cIt turns out there\u2019s a bunch of recent articles about Todoroki Touya, and all of them think he\u2019s dead, but apparently a body was never found, so there\u2019s a chance!\u201d she said cheerily, shoving her phone in his face. \u201cHere, read and see if you remember anything!\u201d\nDabi rolled his eyes again, but took Toga\u2019s phone obligingly, and began scanning the article.\nWHO IS TODOROKI TOUYA?By Koizumi Suzu\n\n After the shocking trial against the- \n\nDabi huffed and skipped past whatever the introduction was, scrolling past the first few paragraphs to get it over with faster.\n Todoroki Touya was the firstborn son of Todoroki Rei and Enji, otherwise known as pro hero Endeavor. He was born on January 18th,  2XXX. Not much is known about the first three Todoroki children, as they had been kept mostly out of the public eye. Todoroki Fuyumi, when we reached out to her for a comment, agreed to speak some of her late brother. \n\n \u201cTouya was\u2026 incredible. He helped our mother raise Natsuo and Shouto, and he was my best friend growing up. He always went out of his way to make sure we were all safe and happy, and when our mother was sent away, he tried his best to fill her place, those few years until he died.\u201d \n\n\n [Pictured, from left to right, Todoroki Fuyumi, age 7, Todoroki Touya, age 9, Todoroki Shouto, age 6 months, Todoroki Natsuo, age 4. Picture provided by Todoroki Fuyumi] \n\nDabi froze as he reached the picture, three bright, smiling children, and a wide-eyed infant, snow-white hair with splashes of red across the board.\nHe stared at it.\nSomething was  tugging  in the back of his mind.\nHis thoughts raced.\nShou, Yumi, Nat,  Kei- \nTouya  remembered. \n\n Touya and Yumi hid underneath a table, their mother\u2019s feet walking right past as she called out in wonder. \u201cI wonder where Touya and Fuyumi could be,\u201d she said slowly, a smile in her voice. Touya shared a glance with his sister, the two of them starting to giggle. Their mom crouched down, her smiling face appearing as she looked under the table. \u201cThere\u2019s my two little trouble makers. Come on, hide-and-seek\u2019s over, time for lunch,\u201d she said, scooping the two of them up to hold one on each hip, strong arms carrying them with ease. Touya laughed as her short white hair tickled his nose. \n\nIt all came flooding back.\n\n \u201cThere\u2019s a baby in mommy?\u201d Nat asked in wonder, chubby little hands coming to rest on their mother\u2019s stomach with as much care as a four-year-old\u2019s motor skills could provide. \n\n\n Touya nodded, smiling as their mother looked down at the two boys fondly. \u201cMm-hm! You were in mom once too, Na-chan.\u201d \n\n\n Nat looked up at him with big, round eyes, filled with all the wonder and innocence of the world. \u201cReally?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cUh-huh! And now we\u2019re gonna have a little brother!\u201d \n\n\n Nat beamed up at him, before returning his awed gaze to her swollen stomach. \n\nHow could he forget-\n\n \u201cCareful,\u201d his mother\u2019s exhausted voice warned him as she gently laid the baby in his arms. \u201cMove your elbow a little, support his neck\u2014yes, just like that.\u201d \n\n\n Touya stared down as the tiny person now cradled in his arms, soft tufts of white and red hair sticking up from the top of his head. Blue and grey eyes blinked back up at him. He looked at his mother. \u201cHis eyes are funny.\u201d \n\n\n She laughed\u2014a soft, tinkling noise. \u201cIt\u2019s called heterochromia, sweetie. It means his eyes are two different colors.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cOhhh.\u201d Touya looked down at the baby again. \u201cHe\u2019s my little brother?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYes. This is your new little brother, Shouto.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cShouto,\u201d Touya repeated slowly, staring at the baby. After a few moments, he beamed. \u201cHey, Shouto. I\u2019m your big brother Touya. I\u2019m gonna protect you since that\u2019s what big brothers do!\u201d he said, finishing with a note of pride. His mother chuckled. \n\n\n \u201cYes, they certainly do,\u201d she said, ruffling his hair. \n\n\n Shouto stuck his hand in his mouth. \n\n\n \u201cI think he might be stupid.\u201d \n\n\n His mother laughed. \n\n-everything-\n\n \u201cHi!\u201d his roommate chirped, bouncing up to him as he entered the room. \u201cI\u2019m Hawks! I\u2019m thirteen, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \n\n\n Touya stared at the other boy with an unimpressed look on his face. \u201cTodoroki Touya. Fourteen. Do you have a real name or am I supposed to believe that your parents actually named you Hawks?\u201d \n\n\n The boy with the bird mutation blinked and reared back slightly, allowing Touya to step around him and set his bag on the extra bed in the room. \n\n\n \u201cI, uh,\u201d the boy started hesitantly, and Touya looked back over his shoulder to him tapping his talons\u2014he had talons? That was actually pretty sick\u2014together nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to go by my legal name.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not gonna tell on you if you tell me,\u201d Touya said, raising an amused brow as red feathers puffed up in embarrassment, the younger\u2019s face flushing. \u201cI\u2019m not a snitch.\u201d \n\n\n Clawed fingers twisted together for a moment, before freezing and clenching around each other. The other boy\u2019s flush deepened. \u201c...promise?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYeah. I promise. Dorm secrets, or whatever. What happens in the dorm stays in the dorm.\u201d \n\n\n Feather boy stared at him for a few moments longer, before his hands clenched slightly again and he slowly untangled them, shakily holding one out for Touya. \n\n\n \u201cTakami, uh\u2014Keigo. Takami Keigo. I prefer Keigo. Nice to meet you.\u201d \n\n\n Touya grinned and shook the boy\u2014Keigo\u2019s\u2014hand. \u201cTodoroki Touya.\u201d \n\n\n Keigo beamed. Touya already knew the other was going to be the death of him. \n\nHis head pounded.\n He was burning, Touya was  burning,  he couldn\u2019t fucking stop it- \n\u201c-i!...\u201d\n\n Blue flames surrounded him as he screamed- \n\n\u201c-bi!...\u201d\n\n He could feel his skin burning, and he could feel himself crying, but only blood made tacky by the heat was running down his face- \n\n\u201c-abi!...\u201d\n Touya screamed again as the fire kept licking at his body, and he could feel himself getting lightheaded, he was hyperventilating and he  didn\u2019t want to die-\n\u201cDABI!\u201d\nDabi\u2019s head snapped up, meeting Toga\u2019s concerned gaze only a few inches from his face. In his peripheral vision, he could see the rest of the League (except Shigaraki, who was still off pouting somewhere) staring at him with worry.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he asked in a monotone after a few moments of silence.\nToga sniffled, and oh God, Dabi was not prepared to deal with a crying person right at that moment. \u201cYou were just staring at the screen for a really long time, and then when Jin tried to get your attention, you weren\u2019t responding and-\u201d\n\u201cWhat she means,\u201d Compress interrupted gently, putting a hand on her shoulder, \u201cis that you worried us for a moment there.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Dabi said. Not the smartest response he\u2019d ever had. To be fair, he was processing a shit ton of information. \u201cHold this,\u201d he said, shoving Toga\u2019s phone back at her as he roughly stood up.\nThe bar was silent as he took several quick strides over to the window, yanking the curtains aside and sliding the window open, sticking his head out into the alley between their building and the next.\nTaking a deep breath-\n\n \u201cMOTHERFUCKER!\u201d \n\nHe listened to it echo slightly in the alley before ducking his head back inside, shutting the window and closing the curtain. He turned back to the occupants of the bar, who were all staring at him in shocked silence. \u201cSorry about that, I just remembered my entire fucking life.\u201d\nSpinner made an odd, aborted choking noise.\nBefore anybody could make much more of a reaction, however, the door to the bar slammed open, and a dangerously sweet voice floated in.\n \u201c~Shigaraki~ I\u2019ve come for your scalp,\u201d  Hawks said in a sing-song voice as he prowled inside.\nOh, Dabi was  not  ready for that conversation. Whether it was because of the threat against his scalp or because of the emotional baggage, he wasn\u2019t sure.\nHowever, Twice took away the option of  not  talking about it, probably in a well-meaning attempt to redirect Hawks\u2019 attention from his bloodlust, by shouting, \u201cDabi\u2019s Todoroki Touya! No, he\u2019s not!\u201d\nHawks froze. And slowly, ever so slowly, began to turn his head to look directly at Dabi, who froze in turn.\nIt was silent for a moment.\nHawks took a deep breath.\n\u201cSpinner,\u201d he started suddenly.\n\u201cYes?\u201d the mutant in question responded quickly.\n\u201cTell Shigaraki he gets to keep his scalp for another day.  You,\u201d  he continued, stalking over to Dabi with a dangerous look, fisting his hand in the collar of his jacket, \u201care coming with me. Kurogiri, could you be a dear and give me a portal back to my apartment?\u201d\nDabi decided he really hated favoritism as the bartender opened a portal without question.\nHe resigned himself to his fate as Hawks dragged him through, tossing a \u201cThank you,\u201d over his shoulder before the portal closed.\nHawks\u2019 apartment was nice, Dabi was able to decide quickly. Open plan, high rise, one of the walls was completely made out of glass. Once that was out of the road, Dabi didn\u2019t have much choice but to focus on the dangerously calm face in front of him.\n\u201cWas Twice telling the truth?\u201d he asked blankly, making direct eye contact. \u201cAre you Todoroki Touya?\u201d\nDabi swallowed, his throat feeling weirdly tight. \u201cHey, Kei-chan.\u201d\nDabi wasn\u2019t sure whether or not to be surprised by the punch that snapped his head to the side.\n\u201cYou  fucking asshole!\u201d  Hawks screeched. \u201cI thought you were  dead,  I fucking  grieved  over you, you piece of shit!\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair,\u201d Dabi tried slowly, holding a hand against his stinging cheek, watching Hawks\u2019 wings stretch out and puff up in agitation, \u201cI had no idea anybody thought I died until like, ten minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up, I\u2019m trying to be mad at you!\u201d he snapped. Dabi, suddenly able to recall  thousands  of memories of the hero that he hadn\u2019t before, simply laid a gentle hand on his shoulder and guided the other over to the couch as he continued to shout profanities at him. \u201cDo you know how times I cried over your grave, you dickhead! Too many times to be putting up with all this fucking  bullshit,  that\u2019s for sure! God  fucking  dammit!\u201d\nWhile Dabi might have more memories of Hawks, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean he knew precisely what to do at that moment. Suddenly returning from the dead because you finally remembered all your memories after seven years of looking and then confronting your old boyfriend wasn\u2019t really something Dabi had a point of reference for.\n\u201cDo you know how many fucking  awkward conversations  I\u2019ve had to have with your sister about this? Too fucking many! Could\u2019ve at least told them you had a boyfriend so I didn\u2019t have to tell your entire family that shit on  national television!\u201d  Okay, Dabi  really  wanted to ask what the fuck that was about, but knew it wasn\u2019t the time, unless he was feeling lucky. Which he kinda wasn\u2019t.\nAs they sat down on the couch, Hawks yelling all the while, Dabi took note of his red eyes and blotchy cheeks, and even though there weren\u2019t any tears, he knew Hawks was crying (at least they matched, now, in their lack of ability to properly cry).\nTrying to be comforting seemed the most likely route to  not  getting stabbed (or scalped).\nIn one quick movement, he pulled Hawks to his chest, wrapping his arms the other, rubbing the space in between his wings as the appendages flapped in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking  asshole!\u201d  Hawks' voice was muffled by his shirt.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed neutrally. Hawks\u2019 shoulders began to shake.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a problematic  dickhead!\u201d  he continued, hitting his fist weakly against Dabi\u2019s chest.\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cStop  fucking agreeing with me!\u201d \n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\n \u201cI fucking hate you!\u201d \n\n\u201cLove you too, Keigo.\u201d\nAnd that seemed to be the final straw for Hawks, as he fell limp, wrapping his arms around Dabi and fisting his hands in the back of his shirt.\nTouya held Keigo close as he sobbed.\nHe ran his fingers through the other's hair, humming a meaningless tune in the back of his throat as Keigo\u2019s chest hitched with every breath, each high pitched, shuddering sob muffled by Touya\u2019s shirt.\nEventually, Keigo slowly began to grow still. The apartment was dark, by then, the sun slowly having fallen lower and lower below the horizon. Touya worried Keigo might have fallen asleep, but continued to run his fingers through his hair.\nA good few minutes after Keigo\u2019s shoulders had finally fallen still and his breathing evened out, he slowly lifted his head from Touya\u2019s chest, his face flushed and eyes an irritated red. He sniffed as he sat up, pulling away slightly.\n\u201cHey, birdie,\u201d Touya said, giving him a small smile. Keigo let out a startled, wet laugh as he rubbed his eyes.\n\u201cHey, hot stuff,\u201d he responded with a shaky grin. \u201cDo you-\u201d he cut himself off, looking uncertain. Touya laced his fingers together with Keigo\u2019s, giving them a reassuring squeeze. \u201cDo\u2014do you want to be Touya and Keigo, again?\u201d he asked in a soft voice, using the hand that wasn\u2019t entwined with Touya\u2019s to gesture between them. \u201cDo you still want there to be\u2014an us?\u201d\nTouya sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can go entirely back. We\u2019re still Dabi and Hawks.\u201d He waved lamely with one hand out the window. \u201cBut\u2014I\u2019d like to be Touya, again. With you.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Keigo nodded shakily, leaning forward to rest his forehead against Touya\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 leave the rest of this conversation for tomorrow, I\u2019m fucking drained.\u201d Touya laughed in agreement, and Keigo smiled. \u201cFor now\u2026\u201d he smiled, leaning forward and pressing his lips against Touya\u2019s, who readily reciprocated the action. His head tilted slightly and one hand tangled in Keigo\u2019s hair, the other wrapped around his waist, tugging him forward to straddle Touya\u2019s lap.\nKeigo shifted slightly, his arms and shoulders shifting back and his red leather jacket landed on the floor, a slight rustle accompanying the reformation of his wings. He pressed deeper into the kiss, tongue running along Touya\u2019s mismatched lips which opened readily for him. Clawed hands delved into his raggedy coat, and Touya easily acquiesced, shrugging the coat off.\nTouya pulled away as his body warmed, staring into Keigo\u2019s blown eyes. \u201cOkay, uh\u2014I have two questions if this is going where I think it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\u201cIt probably is,\u201d Keigo responded, a teasing smirk playing along his lips.\n\u201cGreat, okay. First\u2014are you sure you want this?\u201d\n\u201cFuck yes.\u201d\n\u201cCool, we\u2019re in agreement.\u201d Keigo laughed at him, looping his arms around his shoulders. \u201cSecond\u2014is this a good idea?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Keigo admitted, though he made no effort to move. \u201cBut I\u2019m not well known for making the best decisions.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, am I a guilty pleasure, then?\u201d\n\u201cGuilty of several crimes, yes.\u201d\nTouya barked a laugh at the response, Keigo grinning down at him. He quickly calmed himself before he continued speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s probably at this point I should tell you that people weren\u2019t exactly lining up to fuck rotting eggplants, so I have  no  idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nKeigo snorted, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a workaholic who was just under so many NDAs it wasn\u2019t even funny. I didn\u2019t exactly get laid, either.\u201d\n\u201cFantastic, neither of us know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nKeigo laughed at that, before tugging Touya up to his feet. \u201cCome on. You\u2019ve seen porn, I\u2019ve seen porn, I have lube in my bedroom. We can piece it together.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. I love puzzles,\u201d Touya muttered sarcastically, following Keigo\u2019s lead.\n\u201cDo you wanna fuck or not?\u201d Keigo asked him sharply as they stumbled into what must\u2019ve been his bedroom, going by the insanely large bed in the center (Touya didn\u2019t think you could get bigger than a king-size bed, but apparently he was wrong).\n\u201cYeah-\u201d\n\u201cThen keep the snark to yourself and strip. I refuse to have my first time feeling like some half-clothed alleyway fuck.\u201d\nit\u2019s \u2728spicy nostalgia\u2728 @hawksofficialin a shocking turn of events, it turns out my therapist was right and that facing my trauma head-on makes things significantly better.\non an unrelated note, i have a pounding headache after crying for several hours last night.\nlola bunny @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficiali really don\u2019t know how concerned i should be about this. do i want to know what you did?\nit\u2019s \u2728spicy nostalgia\u2728 @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficialprobably not.\nBest Jeanist @bestjeanistofficialReplying to @hawksofficial and @mirukoofficialPlease tell me that\u2019s not code for something illegal.\nit\u2019s \u2728spicy nostalgia\u2728 @hawksofficialReplying to @bestjeanistofficial and @mirukoofficialno comment\nBest Jeanist @bestjeanistofficialReplying to @hawksofficial and @mirukoofficialHAWKS.\nhoshi @banjopiccaloReplying to @hawksofficiali refuse to believe there\u2019s anything more chaotic than hawks\u2019 twitter account post-hpsc\nyasu @ production period!!! @flygirl2XReplying to @banjopiccalo and @hawksofficiali mean, you\u2019re not wrong\nTomura wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect when Kurogiri looked down at his phone and opened a portal, and Hawks came through, dragging Dabi behind him - especially after the rest of the League\u2019s recounting of the day before. Dabi stumbled a few steps behind Hawks before being shoved onto the couch by the hero.\nHawks then scanned the room, waving back at Twice and Toga, before his eyes landed on Tomura, who tensed, eight fingers tightening around his DS as the Hawks stalked towards him. He wouldn\u2019t  actually  do it.\n\u201cShigaraki,\u201d Hawks said, a dangerous smile on his face as he laid his hand on his shoulder. Tomura met the glare with one of his own. \u201cThanks to a unique set of circumstances that isn\u2019t going to happen again, I\u2019ve decided to spare you, this time. However,\u201d his smile turned sharp, \u201cyou do anything like that again, and that oily rag on your head will be hung on my wall. Cool? Cool.\u201d And Hawks clapped him on the shoulder in a gesture that implied far too much familiarity before turning and walking away before Tomura could properly respond.\n\u201cStop fucking trying to threaten me!\u201d he shouted at Hawks\u2019 back, who simply made a dismissive gesture over his shoulder that made Tomura\u2019s blood pressure skyrocket.\nAs Hawks took a seat at the bar and began talking to Kurogiri, who greeted him warmly, Tomura heard Spinner ask Dabi, \u201cDid you get laid or beat up?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Hawks said, clapping his hands together as he finally got the entire League to sit down together. \u201cSince you assholes couldn\u2019t be bothered to watch the news these past seven months,\u201d he turned on the TV, hooked up to his laptop, showing a presentation he\u2019d spent the past several days putting together, \u201callow me to give you the rundown of all the  bullshit  you\u2019ve caused.\u201d\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d he asked, turning back to the room after two hours.\nSilence.\nThe League stared at the screen with wide eyes.\n\u201cGreat, now we can move on to what this means for you guys,\u201d Hawks said before they could recover. Their gazes slowly turned to focus on him. \u201cThere are two options I see here for you. Either you just continue on, starting to do your villainy stuff again,  or  you could\u2014well, I won\u2019t get into the legalities, but while public support is high, you can probably swing getting into vigilante reform programs. That\u2019s the route I\u2019d recommend. After a rehabilitation period, you can all probably apply for P.I. licenses, or, if you really want to, U.A. has moved to a university format, as well as most other hero schools, so Spinner, along with Dabi, Toga, and Shigaraki, assuming you\u2019re willing to work to earn your GEDs, could apply there. Compress, Twice, and Kurogiri probably could as well, but you\u2019re a bit over the target demographic. You could alternatively apply for a Quirk license in combination with a P.I. license. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that, but that route would allow all of you to continue what you have been doing, just without having to avoid the cops.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that we turn ourselves in,\u201d Shigaraki commented flatly after a moment. Hawks shrugged.\n\u201cPretty much. I can probably advocate for you guys. As the Number One hero, my word carries a bit of weight.\u201d\nDabi choked on a mouthful of water\u2014Hawks felt a sense of vindictive revenge, for the other had caused him to do the same more than once\u2014and stared at him incredulously, the rest of the League doing the same. \u201cSince when the fuck were you the Number One hero?\u201d\n\u201cSince the last billboard. I gave you guys the sparknotes version of the past few months.\u201d\nHawks paused for a moment, thinking. The HPSC had been shut down, and its offices raided. Nobody had approached him about any secret mission to infiltrate the League of Villains, so it was pretty safe for him to assume it hadn\u2019t been put on any records. He might have wanted to think that it was to maintain complete secrecy, but Hawks was a realistic person. The HPSC was more than willing to throw people under the bus. He was the only person not in prison who knew about it  (though, knowing Dabi was Touya made him fairly sure the other knew, or at least suspected).  After another moment of thought, he decided he might as well keep it that way. It had stopped being a mission a while ago, he knew that. He was still here, even with nobody to report to.\n\u201cI got into this whole thing because I wanted to see what was wrong with hero society change, and I didn\u2019t see any way to do that as a hero\u2014and I guess I was right about that much at least.\u201d Hawks shrugged, averting his gaze from the League down to his laptop. \u201cThe way things are run has been completely overhauled, the HPSC has been shut down, new regulations put in place, and heroes are working together better than ever.\u201d He looked back up at the League. \u201cI like you guys, I really do, but my goals have been accomplished. I like being a hero, and I enjoy saving people. Quirk discrimination laws have been expanded and sympathy for villains is at an all-time high.\u201d He averted his gaze again. \u201cI like to think you\u2019re all good people. You can just become civilians if you want to, but I think you\u2019d all make pretty great heroes.\u201d\nHe heard a sniffle, and froze, head snapping around to stare at Toga, whose eyes were watering.\n\u201cYou mean it?\u201d she asked, trembling slightly. \u201cYou\u2014you really think a freak like me could be a hero?\u201d\nHawks\u2019 eyes softened.\n\u201cWhoever told you you\u2019re a freak is a dumbass. You\u2019re a great kid, Toga. The world\u2019s just been unfairly cruel to you. I think you\u2019d make an  incredible  hero.\u201d\nShe burst into tears.\ntragic backstory boyconcept: before we turn ourselves in, i give a dramatic performance and share all the shit my father\u2019s done as my last act of villainy\nzazuconcept: no\ntragic backstory boybabe please\nzazuyou\u2019re going to embarrass yourself, i guarantee it\nwanna see a magic trick?...I will admit to being intrigued by the idea.\nzazuof course you are, you drama queen\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96oooh, you could dance!!!! it\u2019ll be like musical theatre!!!!!\ntragic backstory boygenius\nzazui wonder why i\u2019m even surprised that you\u2019re into this idea too\nhand puppetsi\u2019m in\nzazuokay, i know you\u2019re only in it to annoy me\ntragic backstory boywhat dance should i do\nzazuno!!!!\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96do the wap dance\ntragic backstory boyideas like this are why you\u2019re my favorite\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96:3c\nzazudabi you are not flexible enough to do the wap you\u2019re gonna pop so many staples\ntragic backstory boyoh, like you are?\nzazu\u2026\ntragic backstory boywait can you do the wap\nzazui don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant to this discussion\ntragic backstory boy1. hot\n2. teach me for my dramatic performance\nhand puppetdabi stop being horny\nteenage mutant ninja lizardnot gonna lie i think that\u2019s his default setting\ntwinsiesno it\u2019s not!!!!\nhe\u2019s a fucking horndog\ntragic backstory boyi\u2019ve talked it over with hawks, and after some negotiations, it has been decided i will not be doing the wap\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96awwww :(\nhand puppetyou two are revolting\nzazuyou\u2019re not going to be doing any dramatic performance\ntragic backstory boyi need a different dance\nzazudon\u2019t you fucking ignore me\nteenage mutant ninja lizardi guess this means the honeymoon period is over\ntwinsiesthey\u2019ll be fine!\ni bet it\u2019s not gonna last the year\nmom friendSpinner, Twice, it\u2019s not polite to talk about peoples\u2019 relationships like that\nteenage mutant ninja lizardsorry\ntwinsiessorry\nfuck off\n\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd2a\u2728Himikuwu\u2728\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc96i could teach you how to renegade!\ntragic backstory boyand you continue to be my favorite\nzazuyou\u2019re sleeping on the couch tonight\nDabi was usually the first one up; he had a tendency to crash around seven PM, and then sleep for eleven hours. Kurogiri was usually that next one awake, appearing in the bar around seven AM. The rest of the League would trickle in slowly after that.\nSo it was a bit odd for Shigaraki to slouch into the bar not long after six.\nDabi raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re up bright and early.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Shigaraki growled lowly, throwing himself into the seat next to Dabi, reaching for the coffee maker. Dabi snorted into his mug.\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes.\n\u201cGiran called,\u201d Shigaraki said. \u201cManaged to track down your old phone number and contacts. He\u2019s emailed them to you, for whatever the hell you\u2019re planning to use them for.\u201d\n\u201cNice.\u201d Dabi took a sip of his coffee and paused, pinching his lips as he considered his next words. \u201cHey, uh\u2026\u201d Shigaraki looked over, his permanent condescending look on his face. God, Dabi was regretting his decision already. \u201cThanks for helping me out with the whole amnesia thing. You didn\u2019t have to, so I\u2014I really appreciate it. Thank you.\u201d\nAfter a few moments wherein Shigaraki didn\u2019t respond, Dabi glanced over at him, silently preparing himself for whatever mocking comment he was gonna get in response.\n\u201cYeah. No problem.\u201d\nDabi blinking, staring at Shigaraki, who was determinedly not looking at him, a furious flush over his face.\n\u201cAre we having a moment?\u201d he asked after a second.\n\u201cIf by \u2018moment,\u2019 you mean I don\u2019t want to murder you for once, then yes.\u201d\n\u201cCool. Is it over?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThey sat in silence for another few moments before Dabi broke it again.\n\u201cThat was nice and all, but I\u2019m not really digging this whole \u2018being civil to each other\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\u201cIt was fucking weird, and you have yourself to blame for bringing it up.\u201d\n\u201cWanna argue?\u201d\n\u201cThis is getting uncomfortable, so either you start something, or I will.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shoving all your dirty work onto me, you discount Silent Hill character?\u201d\nShigaraki slammed his mug of coffee down on the table, turning to glare at Dabi, eyes blazing.\n\u201cOkay,  you know what-!\u201d \nfoghorn leghorn @hawksofficialyou know when somebody goes and does something you explicitly told them not to do and you have to ask why god is testing your patience like this.\nlong story short, i stopped a murder today\nlola bunny @mirukoofficialReplying to @hawksofficialthat\u2019s literally our job, how was this any different than usual?\nfoghorn leghorn @hawksofficialReplying to @mirukoofficiali stopped this one through self-control\n[Video]\n\nDABI'S DANCE | League of Villains turn themselves in (FULL VIDEO)\n\n #1 on Trending \n\n13,389,057 views \u00a0 708k likes\u00a0 \u00a045k dislikes \u00a0 SHARE \u00a0 SAVE\n\nmr compress stan\n\nPublished March 23, 2XXX\ni couldn\u2019t find the full raw video without news commentary anywhere, so i stitched it together myself for the masses to enjoy\n25,726 Comments\nAdd a public comment\n\nKawaguchi Akimitsu\n\ni genuinely do not know what to focus on here. do you focus on:\n- dabi trying to do the wap dance, getting to the chorus and immediately shouting \u201cOW FUCK MY STAPLES!\u201d before switching to the renegade- the amount of piping hot tea dabi spilled while doing the renegade- the fact that dabi\u2019s todoroki touya- the fact that they mic\u2019d dabi- twice holding the boombox in the background like he\u2019s playing careless whisper- toga live streaming the whole thing- the poor police officer who tries to ask toga who\u2019s in charge and she just says \u201cit\u2019s usually whoever yells loudest\u201d- shigaraki laughing at dabi- kurogiri shaking his head like a depressed and disappointed parent- mr compress shouting staging cues at dabi like a stage mom- the league of villains turning themselves over into police custody\n21.3k likes \u00a0 dislike \u00a0 Reply\n\nView 132 replies\n\n\nHamasaki Katsuhito\n\nthe disparity between dabi doing the renegade and exposing endeavor for child abuse and revealing himself as the thought-to-be-dead todoroki touya is incomprehensible\n5k likes \u00a0 dislike \u00a0 Reply\n\nView 25 replies\n\n\nMorikawa Sayaka\n\ni just went through five lifetimes worth of emotions in as many minutes\n8.6k likes \u00a0 dislike \u00a0 Reply\n\nView 9 replies\n\nTouya[peacesign.img]\ni lived, bitch\nNatsuoTOUYA?\nFuyumiTOUYA?\nShoutoHello, Touya.\nTouyaokay, you could at least pretend to be surprised shouto\nShoutoOh, sorry.

Are you excited for the new year?\u201d\nShouto shrugged. \u201cI suppose.\u201d\n\u201cHow was your break?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you saw about it on the news.\u201d\nMidoriya averted a guilty look. \u201cI know, but I\u2014I wanted to make sure you were doing okay, Todoroki-kun.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d That was nice, Shouto thought. \u201cI talked to Touya. His case was expedited, and he\u2019s elected to stay with Hawks for his rehabilitation. I think he felt awkward.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a bit of an odd situation to be in.\u201d\n\u201cMm. My father\u2019s case is next week. Detective Tsukauchi said he\u2019s most likely going to be convicted.\u201d\n\u201cAre you happy about it?\u201d Midoriya asked hesitantly.\nShouto\u2019s steps froze for a brief second, before he continued keeping pace with Midoriya. He thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I am.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be conflicted, Todoroki-kun!\u201d Midoriya reassured him with yet another bright smile. Shouto wondered if his face hurt from smiling all the time. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was a rude thing to ask somebody. \u201cTake your time, your feelings don\u2019t have to be immediate.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d A silence fell over them. Shouto wondered what he was supposed to do. \u201cHow was your break, Midoriya?\u201d\nWhen Midoriya grinned and launched into a story of staying up all night to get tickets for HeroCon  (\u201cI got an extra one, do you want to come with, Todoroki-kun?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d),  and a cool hero fight he saw when he was on a grocery run for his mother, Shouto decided that\u2019d been the right move.\nIt was nice, he thought, the slightest of smiles crossing his lips.

Wake up.\u201d\nTouya groaned, slowly peeling his eyes open to squint up at the blurry figure above him.\n\u201cKeigo?\u201d he asked, voice raspier than usual. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s seven, sleeping beauty. Come on, up and at \u2018em. Your sister\u2019s getting married today, and I think she might actually kill me if you don\u2019t show up.\u201d\nTouya laughed, stretching his arms above his head before moving his head up to peck Keigo\u2019s lips as he leaned over him. \u201cShe won\u2019t kill you,\u201d he said, sleepiness slowly starting to fade from his mind as Keigo crossed his arms and laid his head down on Touya\u2019s chest. \u201cShe\u2019s too nice for that.\u201d He ran his fingers through Keigo\u2019s hair.\n\u201cYeah, but she\u2019ll give me that \u2018I\u2019m not mad, just disappointed\u2019 look that makes you wish she'd kill you instead.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d he agreed, finally sitting up, Keigo moving with him. He kissed Keigo again, who smiled against his lips. Touya\u2019s hands were smacked away as they ran down his back.\n\u201cHands above the hips, buster, we\u2019re on a schedule today,\u201d Keigo reprimanded, pulling away with a smile and rolling out of bed.\nTouya laughed again, a grin pulling at his staples as he threw the sheets off his person. Not a bad way to wake up."
