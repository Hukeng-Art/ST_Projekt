    "text": "For Shouto, it starts with burns marring his skin.\nNo\u2014not that one. That comes later. He\u2019s with his mother when it happens, but she is not the one who burns him (yet). He sits in her lap, encircled by her arms, eyes glued to the TV, drinking in every word of All-Might\u2019s interview.\nAnd then he startles with a gasp, and curls in on himself with a soft whimper of pain.\n\u201cShouto?\u201d His mother\u2019s arms tighten around him, gathering him up. \u201cAre you all right? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHe can\u2019t answer, more than \u201cow, ow, ow,\u201d in a voice that trembles, and he holds out his own arms as the hot sting makes touch unbearable.\nThere are burns on his arms that weren\u2019t there before, that have nothing to do with his quirk. His hands shake, and tears gather in his eyes, as he looks down and sees inflamed skin, bright red in the shape of hands.\nSmall hands\u2014too small to be like the burns Father gives him when he isn\u2019t careful. They\u2019re Shouto-sized hands, but it\u2019s the wrong angle for Shouto to have done this to himself. And even if it wasn\u2019t, he can\u2019t make fire with both hands anyway.\nMoments later, as suddenly as they had appeared, the burns vanish, though the pain remains. He sniffles quietly, and his mother wraps him in a hug and rocks him as she presses a kiss to his hair.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your soulmate, Shouto,\u201d she whispers. There is no one else in the room, and Father isn\u2019t even at home right now, but she always whispers just to be safe whenever she tells Shouto things that Father doesn\u2019t like.\nShouto knows little of soulmates. He\u2019s heard Fuyumi talk about it before, but never to explain what they are. She always made it sound like something good, but Mom flinches at the word. And now, the first time she\u2019s ever spoken of it, it\u2019s to explain why Shouto\u2019s arms burn.\n\u201cDid they hurt me?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d He feels her shake her head. \u201cNever, Shouto. They\u2019d never hurt you. They love you.\u201d\n\u201cThey do?\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Her voice is warm and soft. \u201cThey will, when they meet you. That\u2019s what soulmates are for. It hurts because something else hurt them.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d The pain is ebbing now, from white-hot needles to a duller sting. \u201cUm\u2026 does that mean they feel it too?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Whenever you\u2019re in pain, your soulmate will feel it, too. That\u2019s how they know you need help.\u201d\nShouto falls silent again, looking at the TV. He thinks about this\u2014about how his parents aren\u2019t soulmates, can\u2019t possibly be soulmates because if they were then his father would never hurt her the way he does. He thinks about how useless it is for his soulmate to know that he hurts, because no one can help him. Not against Father. And if he feels his soulmate\u2019s pain, then what is he supposed to do to help them?\nHe can\u2019t even help Mom.\nFor Izuku, it starts when he is out with friends. He is nearly five, and running as fast as his legs can carry him as Kacchan and his friends race ahead of him through the woods. Kacchan has always been the faster runner, and Izuku has to work extra hard to keep from getting left behind.\nAt first he thinks he\u2019s tripped, or run into something. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time; he gets single-minded about catching up to Kacchan, and it makes him miss things like fallen logs or jutting branches or exposed tree roots.\nEither way, pain shoots through his leg like he\u2019s been kicked, and he stumbles and falls with a high-pitched cry of pain.\nUp ahead, most of the other boys run on heedless, but Kacchan skids to a halt and looks back. \u201cOh come on, Deku!\u201d he yells. \u201cHurry up or we\u2019ll leave you behind, stupid!\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s leg hurts, and his hands are scraped from catching his fall, but he raises his head and picks himself back up. No harm done\u2014he\u2019s wearing shorts, but he can handle skinned knees.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d He pushes forward, limping a little on his sore leg, and that\u2019s when his stomach blossoms with pain. This time he retches as he falls, and for a terrifying few seconds he can\u2019t even breathe. This is nothing like the cuffs and swats he takes from Kacchan sometimes, or from the other boys. This feels like someone\u2019s taken a hammer and swung it right into his gut, and he scrapes one of his hands even worse when he hits the ground. His other arm is curled around his stomach.\nHis throat hurts\u2014an ache and then an acidic burn, and with a pathetic little noise he brings up what little he has in his stomach.\n\u201cUgh!\u201d\n\u201cGross!\u201d\nThe other boys sound closer now, and Izuku is grateful that they\u2019ve come back for him this time. Usually they don\u2019t.\n\u201cSeriously, Deku? We weren\u2019t even running that fast and you\u2019re already puking? How useless are you?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s hand closes around his arm and tugs him to his feet.\n\u201cS-sorry.\u201d Izuku coughs, pulling a face at the taste of bile. \u201cSorry, Kacchan, I don\u2019t know what happened, my stomach just hurt all of a sudden.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, are you sick or something?\u201d Kacchan gives him a scornful look.\n\u201cN-no, I mean\u2026\u201d Izuku tugs up the hem of his shirt, and looks down just in time to see a massive fist-shaped bruise vanishing from his skin.\n\u201cWhoa, what the hell?\u201d one of the others yelps. \u201cIs that a quirk? Did you just heal?\u201d\n\u201cN-no.\u201d Izuku sniffles a little, on the verge of tears, and puts his shirt back down. He wheezes, still winded and sore from the invisible blow. \u201cIt still hurts. My leg does too, and\u2014I didn\u2019t even hit anything, it just started hurting for no reason.\u201d Fear makes his stomach churn again. Is something wrong with him?\nKacchan rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a quirk, stupid\u2014useless Deku doesn\u2019t have one, remember? This is just soulmate stuff.\u201d\nIzuku blinks at him, eyes wide and watery. \u201cS-soulmate?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, soulmate! It\u2019s stupid\u2014you feel it every time they get hurt.\u201d Bakugou scowls. \u201cI hate it. One time my face started hurting, right here.\u201d He points to the skin just above the corner of his left eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything, it just started bleeding for no reason! My parents freaked out, but then it stopped, so they told me.\u201d\n\u201cD-do they feel it too?\u201d With a jolt, Izuku thinks of all the times he\u2019s fallen and scraped his knee, or the times Kacchan\u2019s hit him or used his quirk on him.\n\u201cYeah, duh. Ugh, Deku, you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cI-I just, maybe I can ask my mom\u2014\u201d Izuku breaks off with a whimper of pain, and a new bruise appears on his arm. This one burns as well as aches, though the reddened skin fades quickly.\n\u201cWow, already?\u201d Kacchan says scornfully. \u201cYour soulmate must be just as stupid and clumsy as you are.\u201d\nHe runs ahead after that, taking his friends with him and leaving Izuku standing alone beneath the trees, clutching his tender stomach. It\u2019s not until they\u2019re well out of earshot that Izuku summons the nerve to answer him.\n\u201cD-don\u2019t talk about them like that.\u201d\nShouto forgets what it feels like to not hurt. His father\u2019s training hurts from start to finish. When he isn\u2019t training, he\u2019s aching from training. When he isn\u2019t aching from training, he\u2019s hiding in his room and flinching at his soulmate\u2019s pain.\nThere\u2019s a lot of it. More, Shouto thinks, than there should be, but considering his own situation, he can\u2019t be sure.\nOn the worst days, his father\u2019s training and his soulmate\u2019s pain line up.\n\u201cStop flinching!\u201d his father snaps. \u201cDo you think a villain would show you mercy? Do you think you can afford to hesitate in the middle of a fight?\u201d\nShouto bites his lip until it bleeds, because it feels like his arm is being twisted behind his back, and there\u2019s nothing he can do to make it stop. His father comes at him again, sending his small body skidding back across the mat.\nWhen he picks himself up, his nose is bleeding\u2014which must look odd to his father, since Shouto got hit in the chest, and the mat isn\u2019t hard enough to bloody his nose like that. Shouto flinches when he feels his father\u2019s rough hand grab his jaw and force it upward so the man can have a closer look. He can taste the blood as it runs into his mouth, and feel the heat off the flames that dance around his father\u2019s face.\nEndeavor spits a curse and releases him roughly. \u201cIgnore it, Shouto.\u201d\nShouto\u2019s nose has stopped bleeding by the time he wipes it on his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t. It always\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI said ignore it!\u201d His father\u2019s voice becomes a roar. \u201cIt means nothing. It\u2019s a pointless distraction, and it will not get in the way of your duty. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nHis father looms, hands glowing with embers. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\nThey love you. They will, when they meet you. Shouto scrapes together what little courage he has. \u201cBut Mom told me\u2014\u201d\nHis father\u2019s hand cracks across his face, sending him tumbling to the mat again. \u201cIts only use is to train yourself against pain. The life of a hero is a life of pain\u2014ignore it, Shouto.\u201d\nWhen Shouto stands, he nearly falls again when he feels another phantom punch, this time to his ribs. His legs buckle, but he holds firm and tries to muffle the wheezing in his breath.\n\nNever, Shouto. They\u2019d never hurt you.\n\nAs far as Shouto knows, all his soulmate has ever done is hurt him.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t tell his mother about his soulmate. He learns how to bury the pain, how to hide the bruises and burns behind his back or under the kitchen table, how to disguise his pained whimpers as coughing or mumbling. The pain stays but the marks don\u2019t, and before too long, Izuku can take an invisible blow without letting it show beyond a tight jaw or a skip in his breath.\nBut he can\u2019t hide it forever. The pain grows with him, the blows harder and more vicious, more numerous and for longer periods of time. And even when he isn\u2019t feeling them, a bone-deep ache sets in sometimes, especially at night or in the morning, as if he\u2019s just spent the previous day running for miles. His mother catches him limping, but he mumbles something about tripping and she knows about how mean Kacchan gets, so she ices it and fixes his favorite dinner that night. It does help, and Izuku wonders. If his soulmate feels his pain, can he make them feel like theirs is being taken away?\n\u201cI bet you get picked on a lot too, huh,\u201d he whispers at the ceiling one night, when the ache is too much to sleep through. It gets muffled sometimes, and he imagines that this is when his soulmate is asleep. But if it hurts this much, then they must still be awake.\nMaybe they\u2019re lying in their room just like him, looking at the ceiling and waiting for the pain to go away.\n\u201cI think you get hurt worse than me,\u201d Izuku says, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if his soulmate could hear him, and talk back? \u201cI wish I could meet you. I\u2019d be your friend, I promise. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t hurt us if there were two of us together.\u201d\nSilence answers him. These are wishful dreams, happy little ghosts of thoughts and nothing more.\nThe day comes when he can\u2019t hide it any longer. He\u2019s setting the table while Mom finishes up lunch, and he can\u2019t hide it because the first thing he does when it hits him is drop a plate.\nHis mother is in the room the second she hears the shatter, and Izuku is already on his knees, curled in on himself and screaming.\nHis face is on fire. It burns and burns, he\u2019s going blind, he\u2019s drowning in pain, he\u2019s dying\u2014\nMom snatches him up off the ground, and he can hear her voice calling to him, pitched with fear as she cradles him in her arms and begs him to take his hand away, to show her what\u2019s wrong, please Izuku I\u2019m here, Mommy\u2019s here, tell me what happened, tell me what hurts\nShe gently pries his hand from his face, and he doesn\u2019t see what she sees\u2014blisters forming on his face around his left eye, mottled reddened skin parting and peeling as Izuku screams and screams\u2014and then it\u2019s fading and gone, skin smooth and unblemished and freckled again, but Izuku can\u2019t stop screaming.\nShe holds him for a long time, letting him muffle his cries into her sweater, until the food is cold on the stove and Izuku has exhausted himself to fitful weeping and the pain is gone.\nNot just muffled, but gone, and Izuku has never wished more for a bruise in his life.\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Mom whispers. \u201cIzuku, talk to me. That\u2014that was your soulmate, wasn\u2019t it? How long has this been going on? How long have they been hurting?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel them.\u201d Izuku clutches at her, wishing for pain, for a bruise or another burn, something, anything to tell him that they\u2019re still there, that they\u2019re still somewhere and they aren\u2019t gone. \u201cM-mom, I can\u2019t feel anything from them anymore, what if\u2014what if they\u2014?\u201d\nInstead of answering, she holds him close and rocks him gently. He pinches himself\u2014not too hard, just enough to feel it. He does it again, and again, several times over the next few hours, wondering if his soulmate will answer.\nAnd as he waits he feels something\u2014not blows and bruises. What he feels is somewhere deep in his chest, a heavy pit in his heart, sadness and anger and the crushing emptiness of being alone. The anger is what confuses him, and clues him in to the idea that these feelings might not be his.\nAfter all, this is just another kind of pain, isn\u2019t it?\nHe can dare to let himself hope.\nIt\u2019s not until a day later that Izuku feels a phantom blow to his shoulder, and he cries again in pure relief. He hugs himself and rocks gently, and thinks about how unfair it is that pain is all they can feel from each other. Izuku wants to share so much more with them, warm blankets and summer days and hot tea and his favorite foods.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not there. I\u2019ll look for you, I promise, I promise. I\u2019ll find you and it\u2019ll be okay then, I promise.\u201d\nHe thinks, I love you, but doesn\u2019t say it out loud. How can he love someone he\u2019s never met?\nIzuku does get the chance to communicate one night. He\u2019s twelve years old, and it\u2019s the worst night of his life.\nThe pain starts a little after seven in the evening, and within a half hour, Izuku has locked himself in his room on the pretense of doing homework. It\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s finished most of his work in class already, because tonight, all he can do is curl up on his bed, bury his head beneath his pillow, and cry as silently as he can as he waits for it to stop.\nWithin two hours, his bed is littered with crumpled, bloodied tissues, used to staunch his four-second cuts and nosebleeds. His entire body is one mass of pain, and he\u2019s thirsty from crying but too scared to venture out of his room for fear of causing Mom more worry.\nWithin three hours, he\u2019s hoping desperately that his mother will go to bed without coming in to check on him tonight.\nWithin four hours, desperation finally breaks him. Mom is asleep, so Izuku limps and stumbles out of his room, finds what he needs in a drawer in the kitchen, and locks himself in the bathroom.\nEndeavor\u2019s training has always been Shouto\u2019s private hell, but there\u2019s one \u201ctutoring session\u201d that will always stand out in his mind.\nIt\u2019s rare for a criminal to slip through Endeavor\u2019s fingers, but rare does not mean impossible. Some quick-witted villain gets lucky or clever and escapes the number-two hero\u2019s clutches, only to be snapped up by some younger up-and-comer who gets the glory and the live news interview and their picture plastered all over online news and social media. Endeavor comes home in a foul mood.\nFour hours in, it is nearing midnight and Shouto is dead on his feet. He hurts so much that he\u2019s stopped feeling human. He\u2019s had enough. He wants to stop. He considers, just for a moment, lying down on the mat and closing his eyes and never moving again.\nBut Endeavor won\u2019t let him, even though he\u2019s not much use for anything but taking a hit and falling. \u201cGet up!\u201d he snaps. \u201cDo you think an enemy will care if you\u2019re tired? Do you think a villain will stop to let you rest?\u201d With one hand, he snags the front of Shouto\u2019s shirt, drags him back to his feet, and shakes him so hard that Shouto\u2019s teeth rattle. \u201cYou must be stronger!\u201d\nFor all those pretty words and shouting, Shouto is not fit to do anything but dodge one blow before the next knocks him to the ground again. He feels the mat against his face and thinks, That\u2019s it. I\u2019m not getting up. He can shout and kick all he wants but I can\u2019t. He feels the thud of his father\u2019s footsteps coming closer, shuts his eyes, and waits.\nIn the next moment his eyes snap open, and he curls in on himself and clutches at his arm with a choked cry of pain. His stomach twists, and he grits his teeth against pain and fear and the sudden sensation of sickening guilt.\n\u201cHow many times have I told you\u2014\u201d Endeavor seizes him by the upper arm and drags him up again. \u201cIgnore it! Push through and stand up agai\u2014\u201d He stops, abruptly, and Shouto glances down and sees why. Blood wells up from his forearm, trickling through the gaps in his fingers. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Endeavor snarls, then grabs Shouto\u2019s wrist and wrenches his hand away from the wound.\nThe underside of his arm is slick with blood, the cuts not yet fading, and Shouto can only stare dumbly down at them as he recognizes the wounds as the shapes of words.\n\nSTOP\n\n\n DONT HURT THEM\n\nEndeavor releases him so fast that Shouto nearly falls again. The sting remains, but the cuts are closing up and fading by now, the words\u2014his soulmate\u2019s words, his soulmate did this to him\u2014wiped clean from his skin.\nThe training session ends. Shouto limps to bed and all but falls unconscious the moment his head touches the pillow.\nThe bathroom door is locked, the sink twisted as far as it will go, and the hiss of water drowns out Izuku\u2019s quiet sobs as he washes away the blood.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\nHe washes and doctors the cuts as carefully as he can, using the gentlest disinfectant he can find in the medicine cabinet before wrapping them. From there he hurriedly cleans the blood from the sink, the counter, and the small paring knife he took from the kitchen, and creeps back out of hiding again.\nThe apartment is quiet. He hasn\u2019t woken his mother.\nThe pain is dampened now, and Izuku wonders if that\u2019s because of him, if it stopped because of what he did.\nHe stops wearing short sleeves after that.\nShouto\u2019s first year of high school is nearing. He already knows where he\u2019s going; that was decided for him the moment his quirk came in. His father wants him in UA; his father is going to make sure he ends up in UA no matter the cost.\nAnd that\u2019s fine. Shouto will swallow his distaste and give him that, because UA is the best school for becoming a hero, and he\u2019s going to need all the help he can get. Besides\u2014it won\u2019t matter that he lets Endeavor control this, because Shouto is going to deny him everything else.\nHis goals, as they stand, depend on his denial of two things: his left side, and his soulmate.\nA decision like that, he thinks, ought to be harder. But really, it\u2019s probably the easiest thing he\u2019s ever done.\nIt\u2019s not hard to hate his left side. It reminds him of his father, it reminded her of his father\u2014his mother called it ugly and she was right, of course she was right. It was ugly even before she scalded it with boiling water. It looks so much like Endeavor, and Endeavor makes everything ugly.\nAnd as for his soulmate\u2026\n\nNever, Shouto. They\u2019d never hurt you.\n\nHe hears those words in his mother\u2019s voice and thinks of the look on her face when she threw the kettle at him. He thinks of how it feels to have words carved into his arm. He thinks of the pain, of bruises and burns that have plagued him all his life, on top of the ones that his father deals out.\nThe bond is pain, and pain is something to be overcome. If he wants to reach his goal, then it is something he must ignore.\nHe doubts his soulmate will mind. The pain goes both ways, after all. After what Shouto has put them through all their lives, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they hate him by now. And seeing as how he\u2019s going to be a hero, that pain is never going to stop.\nIf they\u2019re smart, then they\u2019ll abandon him, too.\nThe evening after All-Might offers to train him, to help him get into UA, Izuku lies awake in bed and lets tears trickle from the corners of his eyes. His sleeve is rolled back, and if it were brighter, he might be able to see the faded outlines of words on his arm.\nHe takes a deep breath that shudders in and out, and feels the ache in his soulmate\u2019s bones, and the loneliness and anger that fester beneath the surface.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a hero,\u201d he whispers to them. \u201cI\u2019m going to find you. And I\u2019m going to make sure you never, ever have to hurt again.\u201d\nShouto gets extremely lucky, on the day of the entrance exam that he doesn\u2019t have to take.\nHe\u2019s already finished being tested with the other kids entering on recommendation; it would have been an utter disaster if he hadn\u2019t been.\nIt\u2019s so sudden, it\u2019s almost comical. The tests are over and he\u2019s walking back to the main building to stop by the restroom before he leaves. One of the other students tries to talk to him, but Shouto shrugs him off, too preoccupied by mild aches that he feels through the bond, to say nothing of his mixed feelings about being here. To his relief, he finds himself left alone.\nOne moment he\u2019s walking, and the next he\u2019s on the ground. He doesn\u2019t scream or cry out. He can\u2019t\u2014screaming is hard when he can\u2019t breathe, and all he can manage is a breathless wheeze.\nIgnore it, he thinks, distantly. Push through. The voice in his head sounds eerily like Endeavor, and it does nothing to make standing or moving or breathing any easier. He has felt so much pain over the years from his soulmate, but he has never known agony like this.\nThe breath rattles as he forces it into his own lungs, and it escapes again as another harsh gasp.\n\u201cF-fuck.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t stand because he now knows what it feels like to have his legs shatter beneath him. He can\u2019t even crawl, because his entire right arm is in the same state. Only his hand and wrist are visible from beneath his sleeve, and his stomach turns at the sight. The skin is dark purple with internal bleeding, his fingers limp and misshapen. Bile rises in his throat, and he swallows the urge to vomit.\nIn a matter of seconds, his fingers have reshaped themselves and his skin has returned to its normal color, but he still feels like he\u2019s been hit by a bullet train. Ignore it, says Endeavor\u2019s voice in his head, and Shouto forces himself to his knees even though it feels like his arm and legs might slough off if he tries to move them. He sits up, and ice is already forming on his right arm and leg, cooling the agony. He spreads the frost to his left leg, and the bitter cold kills the pain to numbness.\n(Not far from where he sits, Izuku lies limp on the pavement and sobs with relief as phantom chills numb his shattered bones.)\nShouto feels other things, deep down\u2014things that long isolated years and the lessons hammered into his head in his father\u2019s voice would choke out if they could. Things like worry, and fear\u2014because however painful it is for him, these injuries are not his. His soulmate is feeling this, right now, and the difference is that their wounds aren\u2019t going to vanish in a few seconds.\nSomething happened to thoroughly shatter them. Did they have an accident? Was it a villain attack? Did whatever or whoever has been hurting them all these years simply go too far?\nHe wonders, deep down, What happened? What did that to you? Are you all right? before the pain abruptly fades to soreness, and Shouto buries those thoughts like his life depends on it.\nIzuku\u2019s first day of school is a good day.\nIt\u2019s a good day because he wakes up that morning (and his soulmate does too, maybe, if they even live in the same time zone) feeling only mild aches through the bond. But they\u2019re dull and manageable, similar to the aches and pains that Izuku has known from All-Might\u2019s training.\nWith a twinge of guilt, he lets himself be grateful for this sign that his soulmate is still all right. He still feels terrible for what he must have put them through during the entrance exam; he hopes with all his heart that he didn\u2019t frighten them too much, or catch them in the middle of something important.\nI have to get my power under control, he thinks. I can\u2019t do that to them again.\nFor now, he sets those thoughts aside and takes a deep breath as he approaches his classroom door. This is it\u2014his next step to becoming a hero.\n\nWait for me. I\u2019m going to get stronger, just for you. So strong that people will think twice before they ever hurt us again.\n\nWalking in, Izuku is met with a shouting match between Bakugou and the boy he met at the entrance exam\u2014Iida, as he learns shortly. The girl he befriended is there, as well, and he allows himself a sigh of relief at that. It\u2019ll be good to have a friendly face here.\nHe makes a quick scan of the room after Aizawa-sensei\u2019s arrival, to see if he recognizes anyone else. But no, there are no more familiar faces in the room. Not that this is very surprising; he already knows that he and Bakugou are the only ones from their middle school to get in. As arrogant as Bakugou is, he wasn\u2019t wrong when he said that none of their former classmates had what it took get into a school like UA.\nAs he takes a step toward his seat, a flash of bright, eye-catching colors grabs his attention. There\u2019s another boy sitting near the back, ignoring or pretending to ignore everyone around him, and his hair\u2014bright red on one side, snow-white on the other\u2014is impossible to miss. The boy seems to sense him staring, and just barely bothers to glance toward him.\nIzuku\u2019s steps falter when the left side of his new classmate\u2019s face turns toward him. There\u2019s a mark on that side, a patch of darkened, reddened skin. It looks a bit like a birthmark, and in this day and age people are born with all sorts of strange physical features.\n(And yet Izuku finds his hand rising as if of its own accord, straying to the left side of his own face\u2014)\nSomething tugs at the back of his mind, but before it can grow into a proper thought, his new homeroom teacher calls the class to order, and Izuku hurries the rest of the way to his seat.\nIzuku sweats and struggles his way through the quirk apprehension test, keenly aware of how everyone else in his class is pulling ahead of him, regardless of the months he\u2019s spent training. Even Hagakure, whose quirk has nothing to do with physical fitness, is still managing to do better.\nThe temptation to use his own new quirk is strong, but he brushes it aside. He can hardly complete the tests if he breaks his arm or his legs again, and he has a soulmate to think about. He can\u2019t do that to them again.\nStill, his desperation wins out\u2014he can\u2019t risk getting expelled on his first day, not like this\u2014and Aizawa-sensei barely stops him from shattering his arm. Izuku shakes and curses himself.\n\nThink of your soulmate. Don\u2019t stop thinking of them. Don\u2019t stop thinking about how to cause them the least pain.\n\nWhen the idea comes to him, he hopes they can forgive him for one finger.\nShouto takes a mild interest in his classmates, and only out of common sense. These people are going to be his rivals and allies for the next three years, and beyond that when they become heroes in their own right. It\u2019s only practical to get a feel for their abilities, and to scope out the competition.\nYaoyorozu stands out. Besides being admitted on recommendation like himself, she\u2019s competent and sharply intelligent. Iida\u2019s background and lineage are nearly as impressive as Shouto\u2019s. Bakugou stands out the most in terms of power, though his temper and attitude raise Shouto\u2019s hackles.\nThe others run together a little. He probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed Midoriya at all if not for Bakugou\u2019s ranting, and Midoriya\u2019s blatant staring at his scar. Out of all their classmates, Midoriya stands out the least. He shies away from the others, says little once class starts, and hangs close to their classmate Uraraka as if she\u2019s a lifeline. Shouto doesn\u2019t see competition when he looks at him; he sees a timid, anxious boy who couldn\u2019t have looked more out of place if he tried.\nSparing Midoriya a few glances during the quirk apprehension tests don\u2019t do much to change his opinion. The only things that set him apart from the others are the fact that he wears long sleeves under his gym clothes, and how depressingly average he is. If anyone\u2019s getting expelled today, it\u2019s probably going to be Midoriya. Shouto has to wonder if the other boy even has a quirk at all.\nAizawa-sensei makes Midoriya\u2019s turn at the pitching test into a bit of a spectacle, and Shouto\u2019s only watching at this point because everyone\u2019s eyes are on Midoriya, everyone is waiting on bated breath to see what he\u2019ll do. Shouto sees the thoughtful look on Midoriya\u2019s face turn grim and determined, before his classmate winds up and pitches the ball. At the last moment, Shouto could swear he sees Midoriya\u2019s finger glow.\nThe ball goes rocketing into the distance, even further than Bakugou\u2019s attempt did, and Shouto sees none of it because he\u2019s too busy biting back a yell as his right index finger lights up with pain. He looks down, and his finger is entirely dark purple with bruising.\nWhat the hell, did someone take a damn sledgehammer to his soulmate\u2019s finger, or\u2014?\n\u201cOh hell, look at his hand,\u201d Shouto hears Kirishima say, and shoves his hand behind his back before glaring at him\u2014but Kirishima isn\u2019t looking at him.\nConfused, he follows his classmate\u2019s gaze back to Midoriya. Through watering eyes, Shouto sees Midoriya\u2019s right hand\u2014and the dark purple bruising on his finger, a perfect match of Shouto\u2019s own.\n\nNo.\n\nMidoriya\u2019s face is creased with pain, but he forces his teeth into a grin, lifts his injured hand, and curls it into a fist. Shoutos\u2019 vision goes blurry with tears\u2014even with the injury fading, the pain shoots sharply through his hand, and he brings his other arm to his face to muffle a hiss of pain.\n\nThere\u2019s no way.\n\nBut there is. Because Shouto suffers through the rest of the tests with the sensation of a broken finger, and it doesn\u2019t go away until after Aizawa shoos Midoriya off to Recovery Girl\u2019s office. Midoriya barely looks at him for the rest of the day\u2014and for good reason, because Shouto barely looks at him either.\nHe can\u2019t look at him.\nThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. He hasn\u2019t wondered who his soulmate is since he was small. He hasn\u2019t been looking. He never planned to look. He never wanted to know.\nBut apparently the universe doesn\u2019t care about that, because Shouto has found him anyway.\nA moment comes to pass, of course, as Shouto sits in class and allows himself a brief glance at the back of Midoriya\u2019s head, in which he considers pulling his classmate aside and telling him. But it\u2019s only one moment. Shocking as this may be, his plans have no reason to change. His goals are the same, and that means that the path to them is the same.\n\nIgnore it. Push through.\n\nWhen uncertainty plagues him, he remembers the hand-shaped burns on his arms when he was five years old. He thinks of words carved into his arm, spilling blood between his fingers until it dripped and stained the training mat beneath him. He thinks of Endeavor\u2019s training, of all the pain that the two of them have traded over the years, and no wonder Midoriya is timid and quiet. No wonder he shies away from strangers.\nAnd his quirk, apparently, injures him whenever he tries to use it. In the back of Shouto\u2019s mind, he wishes that Aizawa-sensei\u2019s logical ruse had been truthful. If Midoriya has a quirk like that, then Shouto has plenty to dread for the next three years.\nIgnore it, he tells himself. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It doesn\u2019t matter.\nIzuku feels eyes on the back of his head. He turns, and to his alarm finds Todoroki glaring at him like Izuku\u2019s done something to offend him. Bewildered, Izuku can only stare back with wide-eyed confusion as his mouth goes dry with fear. He saw Todoroki use his quirk today, and it\u2019s a powerful one. And Izuku may have a power of his own, but it\u2019s one that he can barely use, and when classmates with powerful quirks take notice of him, it never ends well.\nHe can\u2019t help shrinking a little under the weight of Todoroki\u2019s glare, until his classmate finally looks away.\nHe isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s done to make Todoroki angry with him. He certainly didn\u2019t come here intending to make enemies. It\u2019s bad enough that Kacchan is in his class, it\u2019s bad enough that he still has his soulmate\u2019s pain to worry about. He doesn\u2019t need Todoroki out to get him, too.\nHe\u2019ll just have to stay away, then. Keep out of Todoroki\u2019s way, keep from offending him. And\u2026 maybe apologize, if he ever figures out exactly what Todoroki has against him.\nBut for now, he has to focus on himself, and on One For All.\nThe next day, Izuku\u2019s arm blazes like a beacon of pain when it shatters, blowing a hole clear through every ceiling and floor above him. It\u2019s only a training simulation, but he can\u2019t lose to Kacchan\u2014not again.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers, inches from Kacchan\u2019s face, but he isn\u2019t talking to Kacchan at all.\n(A few buildings away, Shouto slips away from the group before the impact hits, and leans heavily against the wall to hiss and curse and retch with pain. He tries not to sob with relief when Midoriya finally passes out. He doesn\u2019t try hard enough.)\n\u201cLuckily for you, I want to be a hero, so I\u2019d like to avoid any unnecessary cru\u2014fucking goddamn it.\u201d Shouto\u2019s interrogation comes to a pause when his left thumb and middle finger spontaneously break, and it takes him a moment to get back on track. It\u2019s not just the pain, but the anxiety that comes with it. He can\u2019t properly interrogate these men if half his mind is busy wondering what the hell Midoriya thinks he\u2019s doing.\nHe\u2019s not worried about Midoriya. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s no more worried than he would be for any other classmate.\nHe\u2019s not particularly relieved to see Midoriya still in one piece when he rushes to All-Might\u2019s rescue armed with knowledge from the cannon-fodder villains.\nHe\u2019s not.\n(Later, after reinforcements have arrived, Izuku lies crumpled on the ground and tries not to move his broken legs. His eyes water as he whispers shaky apologies.\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, my boy,\u201d All-Might assures him. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku murmurs. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t\u2014I-I was talking to, um\u2026\u201d His voice trails off.\nAll-Might gives him a look of deep understanding. \u201c\u2026Ah. I see.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my boy. To you and your soulmate both.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes are drawn to All-Might\u2019s side, where he knows the scar lies hidden beneath his shirt. He wonders if All-Might has a soulmate, too. What happened to them, the day he received that awful wound? Did they worry about him? Were they angry with him for causing them so much pain?\n\u201cI\u2019ll get stronger,\u201d he whispers, too softly for All-Might to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll get stronger, I will, just please\u2026 please be patient with me.\u201d)\nShouto is ready to throttle his classmate.\nClassmate, he repeats in his head, mentally carving it into his mind as he\u2019s done since the first day of school. Midoriya is his classmate and nothing else.\nAnd if this keeps up, Shouto might scream.\nThat\u2019s the trouble, he thinks, of having a sou\u2014of having a connection with someone in possession of a destructive quirk and a ridiculously high pain threshold. Because Midoriya must have one, if he punishes himself this much and manages to stay sane.\nThank God for Recovery Girl. If not for her, Shouto probably would have punched him after the stunt he pulled during battle training\u2014and he would have had to use his left hand to do it.\n\u201cUm. Hey. T-Todoroki?\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\nShouto is in a foul mood. Midoriya sacrificed a finger during training again, and Shouto\u2019s handwriting has been terrible all day. So he snaps at the sound of Midoriya\u2019s voice, not caring, not caring that this is the first time he\u2019s ever spoken to his soulmate\nClassmate. They are classmates and that is all.\nMidoriya actually jumps, and for a moment Shouto thinks, hopes, that Midoriya will lose his nerve and walk away. But no, his classmate holds his ground, stammering. \u201cI-I-I was just\u2014sorry, I was just\u2026 w-wondering\u2026\u201d\nShouto gives him a flat stare, waiting for him to either spit it out or give up and leave.\nMidoriya meets his eyes briefly, then seems to brace himself. \u201cDid I do something to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shouto answers, and thinks of bumps and bruises and fractured bones over the years, of words carved into his flesh, of the overwhelming agony of shattering bones.\nHis classmate dithers for a few seconds, as if waiting for Shouto to say more, but Shouto has nothing more too say. \u201cO-oh. Okay, um, good. I was j-just\u2014okay\u2026 never mind then\u2026\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice trails off as Shouto walks away.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean anything. It can\u2019t mean anything.\n\nHe hates that he has to keep reminding himself of that. Shouldn\u2019t it be easier to disavow someone who has done little else but hurt him?\nTwo weeks later, Shouto throws down the gauntlet only moments before the Sports Festival begins, and Midoriya looks a lot less timid as he rises to his challenge.\nTodoroki is holding back.\nThe realization comes to Izuku when he\u2019s propped up by Hatsume, Uraraka, and Tokoyami, face to face with Todoroki during the cavalry battle. Todoroki is holding back, and it goes beyond his refusal to use his left side.\nThe battle is fierce already, so he doubts that his teammates\u2014or Todoroki\u2019s for that matter\u2014can tell. Even when Izuku goes after him with One For All, it feels like Todoroki is pulling punches. It feels like even in the middle of a fight, even after Kaminari\u2019s lightning nearly nearly took them down, Todoroki balks at hurting him with his own hands.\nThis is important, a tiny part of him whispers, nudging him in the back of his mind. This means something. This means everything. But in the din of the cavalry battle, with Kacchan\u2019s explosions growing louder and nearer and Izuku\u2019s own pulse pounding in his ears, he can\u2019t hear little voices like that.\nBalking aside, Todoroki\u2019s flames nearly catch on the end of Izuku\u2019s sleeve\u2014he wears long sleeves beneath his gym shirt, to hid scars and blooming bruises\u2014and Izuku fights against the urge to pull back, to keep those marks covered. His teammates depend on him. He can\u2019t afford to shy away.\nIn the end, Todoroki\u2019s hesitance and Tokoyami\u2019s quick thinking push their group forward into the third event, and now Izuku has sparring matches to look forward to.\nSorry, he thinks, to a person he has never seen or met. I\u2019ll try not to hurt you. I\u2019ll do my best.\nAnd then Todoroki is there, still glaring at him with eyes that Izuku cannot read. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d he says. \u201cIn private.\u201d Izuku follows, and tries not to swallow his own tongue. Disregarding his apparent reluctance to take Izuku on directly, Todoroki has been looking at him like he wants to punch him since the first week of school, and part of him wonders if his classmate is finally giving in to the temptation.\nBut instead, Todoroki takes him to an empty hallway close by the entrance and tells him a story.\nIt isn\u2019t a happy one. Todoroki breathes anger as he speaks. He asks questions that Izuku isn\u2019t comfortable answering. And then he talks of pain.\nHe talks of a jealous, ambitious father and of a mother who cries in his memories. He talks of quirk marriages and plans for power, glory by proxy at a vicious cost.\nHe talks of boiling water, and Izuku finds himself unconsciously mirroring Todoroki, one hand rising to the left side of his face.\n(The little voice in the back of his head is louder now.)\nIzuku\u2019s heart is pounding when Todoroki falls silent. He can\u2019t speak. He can barely think. It\u2019s difficult enough just to breathe. He tries to tear his eyes from the scar on his classmate\u2019s face, but he can\u2019t look away anymore. What can he say, to something like that?\nTodoroki watches his face for a moment more, stone-blank and thoughtful, considering him. He moves finally, stepping away from the wall he\u2019s been leaning against.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to. But in the interest of fairness, I don\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\nIzuku blinks, and confusion muddies his mental waters further. \u201cW-what\u2014what are you talking about, Todoroki?\u201d\nFor a moment, his classmate fixes him with a stare like cold steel. He lifts his right hand, and Izuku feels the temperature in the hallway drop. Ice forms in Todoroki\u2019s palm, shaping itself into a wicked-looking point.\nBefore Izuku can blink, Todoroki draws the ice shard across the thickest part of his palm.\n\u201cTodoroki, what are you\u2014ah, ow!\u201d Pain jolts him through the bond, cutting off further words.\nSharp, stinging pain in the palm of his hand.\nThe warm trickle of blood makes him look down, just in time to see the bleeding scratch on his palm as it slowly closes again. Izuku stares at it, frozen and dumb with shock, before looking back to Todoroki again.\nTodoroki\u2019s hand is at his side, but his palm points outward, so that Izuku can see the identical scratch in his own flesh.\nIzuku\u2019s mouth opens, but neither words nor noise emerge. He feels empty and blank.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known since school started,\u201d Todoroki says coldly. \u201cIt was hard to miss, when I saw you break your finger on the very first day of school.\u201d He pauses as if waiting for Izuku to respond, but Izuku doesn\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t. \u201cJust to be clear, this doesn\u2019t change anything. It doesn\u2019t mean anything and it never has. I\u2019m only telling you because if I face you with an unfair advantage of any kind, then I wouldn\u2019t be able to beat you properly.\u201d He raises his eyes again, and they bore into Izuku\u2019s. \u201cAnd I will beat you. Regardless of your connection to All-Might. Or\u2026\u201d He stops again. \u201cOr to me.\u201d When Izuku doesn\u2019t answer, he turns away. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to say. Sorry for taking your time.\u201d\nAnd Izuku wants to answer, as Todoroki\u2014his soulmate\u2014walks away. He wants to say something so desperately that he wonders if Todoroki can feel how much it hurts. Over the past ten years he\u2019s imagined what he would say to his soulmate if he ever met them, and the day has come and his chance is in front of him, but Izuku\u2019s mind is blank.\nAnd then Todoroki is gone, and Izuku is left to slide down the wall until he\u2019s hunched and kneeling in the dim hallway, tears streaming silently down his face.\n\u201cYou have an excellent quirk,\u201d Endeavor tells him before he goes out to face his soulmate, and it\u2019s technically a compliment but Izuku feels his insides twist in revulsion. \u201cIn fact, in terms of power level, yours may even rival All-Might\u2019s.\u201d\nHe gestures with his hands as he speaks, and Izuku can\u2019t take his eyes off of Endeavor\u2019s hands. It\u2019s surreal, to finally see the hands that have caused his soulmate so much pain over the years.\n\u201cNever thought of it that way.\u201d His own voice sounds far away to him as he moves stiffly past Endeavor. The hero\u2019s hands move in the corner of his vision, and Izuku averts his head suddenly enough that it could be called a flinch, if you wanted to get picky about it.\n\u201cMy Shouto has a duty to surpass All-Might,\u201d Endeavor continues before he can escape, and Izuku\u2019s hands clench into fists so tight that the knuckles ache and his nails bite into his palms. Can Todoroki feel that? Is he wondering why? \u201cYour match against him will be an excellent test bed. So don\u2019t disgrace yourself or him by holding back.\u201d\nHurt him, is what Endeavor is telling him. Make him bleed just as I have.\nLots of people have hurt Izuku before. Kacchan. Kacchan\u2019s other friends when they were little. His classmates, over the years. His teachers before he came to UA. The villains that attacked the USJ. They have struck him, beaten him, made him bleed, ground his self-worth into the dust, and made him feel helpless, and what of it? Kacchan was his friend. Their classmates were dumb and arrogant and ordinary. Their teachers were petty. Villains are villains and hurting people is what they do.\nThe man standing behind him, the Flame Hero, the second-strongest in the country, has never hurt him\u2014not really. Endeavor has never raised a hand to him, and now\u2014in the first conversation they have ever shared\u2014Endeavor is paying him a compliment and giving him advice.\nAnd yet it is this man that makes Izuku realize that maybe he can hate after all. There\u2019s no other word he can use to describe the heated rush in his veins, as if molten iron has replaced his blood. He looks over his shoulder to where the Flame Hero still stands, and the unshed tears in his eyes are scalding.\n\u201cYour Shouto,\u201d he says quietly. His words are barely above a whisper, but in the empty hallway he may as well be shouting them.\nEndeavor glances back at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not yours,\u201d His body is still and his voice is steady, but his heart trembles with bottled rage. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be yours.\u201d\nHe meets Endeavor\u2019s eyes with hatred blazing in his own, and walks on.\nMidoriya isn\u2019t holding back\u2014not against himself or Shouto, and for them, there\u2019s little difference.\nShouto is glad. Relieved, even. He was afraid that his blunt revelation to Midoriya had ended up sabotaging him anyway, but his sou\u2014his classmate is coming for him hard, and Shouto can only push through the pain\u2014both his own, and Midoriya\u2019s.\nHe has never been more thankful for his quirk than he is now. Shouto flings up ice and spreads it over his hands and arms, hiding the bruises that darken them every time Midoriya uses his quirk. Endeavor is in the audience, and Shouto can\u2019t risk him finding out. He can\u2019t risk Present Mic seeing and shouting it out for the entire stadium, and everyone watching across the country, to hear.\nAnd speaking of hearing\u2026\nBack at the entrance, after Shouto said his piece and walked away, Midoriya had been silent. But now his words lash at Shouto from across the field, clear and ringing off the ice.\n\u201cStop holding back!\u201d\nShouto\u2019s teeth grind until his head aches. \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Ice ripples across the ground toward Midoriya, but his\u2014his opponent dodges.\n\u201cYes, you are!\u201d There\u2019s blood running down Midoriya\u2019s face, down Shouto\u2019s face, and at this point Shouto can\u2019t even remember whose wound is causing it. \u201cYou said so yourself\u2014you\u2019re stronger than me!\u201d\nShouto shivers in the cold. He can see pale clouds when he breathes out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than this! You could have ended this already if you just used your left side!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Midoriya cries out, hoarse with pain. \u201cIs it\u2014\u201d A blast of ice cuts him off, and Shouto yells with pain as Midoriya sacrifices another finger to block it. In the next moment Midoriya is bursting through the cloud of frost, and Shouto whips to the side to avoid a blow. \u201cIs it because of what your mother said?\u201d\nAmid the frigid cold, Shouto\u2019s blood boils. He doesn\u2019t answer with words; he lets ice do the talking for him. He feels the pain of impact, and it distracts him from his anger and his left side and his memories of Mom crying.\nMidoriya emerges from the attack, battered but still on his feet. He couldn\u2019t have been hit that hard, because he still has enough breath to yell. \u201cShe was wrong, Todoroki! What she said to you was wrong!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Temper blinds him, and the next blast goes wide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ugly!\u201d\n\u201cI said\u2014\u201d Another wave of ice \u201c\u2014shut up\u2014\u201d His right arm is beginning to go numb with cold, so he barely feels another of Midoriya\u2019s fingers break \u201c\u2014about my mother!\u201d\nThe worst thing\u2014the worst thing\u2014is that flying ice shards and wind pressure have destroyed the sleeves on Midoriya\u2019s right arm and torn through the ones on his left, both the gym uniform and the long-sleeved shirt beneath it. The left is the arm on which words were carved, and Shouto understands now, why Midoriya has kept it covered.\n\u201cShe was hurting too, but that doesn\u2019t make her right!\u201d Midoriya gets close enough to slam his mangled fist into Shouto\u2019s stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s not ugly! It\u2019s not his! No part of you is!\u201d\nShouto retches with pain. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014talk about what you don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI do understand,\u201d Midoriya hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cI know what you felt because I felt it too. Remember?\u201d His eyes are wet, fighting a battle with tears and losing, and Midoriya is close enough, now. Shouto can look at his arm and see the pale scars of carved words\u2014STOP and DONT HURT THEM permanently etched into his skin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s how I know how strong you are. That\u2019s how I know that you can do this.\u201d\n\u201cNot without following my father,\u201d Shouto grits out. \u201cIf I use his power\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not his power, Todoroki!\u201d His soul\u2014his classmate\u2019s cry drives itself into him. Watery green eyes, set in a battered, bloodied face, catch his gaze and hold it. \u201cIt\u2019s not his. You\u2019re not his.\u201d He lifts his left hand and touches his face, the same place where the edge of Shouto\u2019s scar is. \u201cIt\u2019s not ugly. It\u2019s just a part of you.\u201d\nAnd that\nthat means something.\nThe stadium lights up with red and gold and orange.\nIzuku wakes up in Recovery Girl\u2019s temporary office, exhausted and thoroughly beaten.\nHe stares at the ceiling, only half-hearing her scold him for recklessness. All-Might is there too, but Izuku can\u2019t muster the energy to feel cowed or guilty. It\u2019s hard to manage feeling anything when every part of him is exhausted.\nHe does manage relief, though. His pain is a dull ache rather than the excruciating fire that usually comes with shattered bones. The less he hurts, the less Todoroki hurts.\nEventually, the scolding runs its course and Izuku is allowed to sit up. He returns reluctantly to the present when Recovery Girl\u2019s hand closes gently around his wrist\u2014the left one, healed and bandaged. Gently she turns it over so his forearm is visible, and he only looks at her then.\n\u201cDid you do this?\u201d she asks softly, fingertip tracing along the scars.\nIzuku tugs his arm out of her grip. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d All-Might looks like he wants to question him further, but Izuku turns his head away. He and All-Might may share secrets, but this one is between him and his soulmate.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t return to his place in the stands. He doesn\u2019t feel quite ready to face his classmates, or anyone for that matter, so he finds a sparser section of the stands and parks himself at the back where he can still watch. His arms are still uncovered, but with a fresh gym shirt draped over his shoulders, he doesn\u2019t feel as exposed as he could be. Besides\u2014everyone is too busy watching the tournament to pay him any mind.\nHe braces himself through Todoroki\u2019s match with Iida, but his fears come to nothing in the end. To his relief, the fight ends without either of them doing each other injury. It\u2019s a short fight. Todoroki doesn\u2019t even need his fire to win it.\n(Is that why he didn\u2019t use it? Because he didn\u2019t need it, or because he still doesn\u2019t want to?)\nThe penultimate round of the tournament ends, and Izuku is thoroughly glad that he picked this lonely spot instead of returning to sit with his classmates. His stomach sours with dread.\nThe final match is between Todoroki and Kacchan.\nIzuku grinds his teeth until his jaw aches. It\u2019s only fair that Todoroki face Kacchan, after Izuku faced Endeavor. He wonders if Todoroki will recognize the way Kacchan\u2019s blows land, the way his quirk punches at the same time as it burns.\nHe sets his back against the wall behind him, and braces himself for the fight to start.\n\u201cAh, there you are, my boy.\u201d\nHe jumps at the sound of All-Might\u2019s voice, jarring his injured arm. He winces. Sorry, Todoroki. It\u2019s harder to brush off pain now that the person sharing it is someone he knows.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d All-Might pats his uninjured shoulder. \u201cI saw that you hadn\u2019t gone back to your classmates, so I went looking for you. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are you doing all alone up here?\u201d\nIzuku feels his throat close. \u201cUh\u2026 I\u2019m fine up here,\u201d he says. \u201cReally. Th-thanks for worrying, but you can go back if you want.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. I may as well keep you company.\u201d All-Might stands beside him, leaning his thin frame against the wall.\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to go back?\u201d Izuku asks, burying his alarm as deep as it will go. \u201cAnd um, I don\u2019t know, sit down or\u2014\u201d\nAll-Might quirks an eyebrow at him. \u201cI might say the same of you, young Midoriya.\u201d An amused smile plays about his mouth. \u201cYou worry about your own self.\u201d\nAnd Izuku does, because the final match is about to start and he knows for a fact that Kacchan won\u2019t make it easy for him to hide it.\nAs Present Mic introduces the final contestants, Izuku presses back against the wall and braces himself.\nIt starts the way Izuku expects. Kacchan makes the first move, pulling no punches. When Izuku flinches, it\u2019s easy for anyone watching to write it off as him spooking at the noise, rather than feeling the impact as if he\u2019s the one down in the ring instead of Todoroki.\nHe tries not to move, for fear of jostling his injured arm and causing Todoroki more pain. Todoroki can\u2019t afford distractions, and Izuku will not cause him to lose. He\u2019s done enough to hurt his soulmate already, hasn\u2019t he?\nAnother explosion rocks the stadium, and Izuku cringes and breathes in sharply, feeling a bruise the size of a dinner plate forming on his ribs. All-Might\u2019s hand settles on his shoulder again.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d his mentor assures him. \u201cMidnight and Cementoss will put a stop to it if it gets too rough.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a high threshold for \u201ctoo rough,\u201d as Izuku knows firsthand. For a moment he considers leaving, finding an empty waiting room, and riding this out by himself.\nNo. He can\u2019t leave, not now. That\u2019s his soulmate out there.\nThe ache of impact turns to burns flashing across his arms, and Izuku hides the temporary wounds behind the overshirt draped over his shoulders. Tears prick in his eyes, but he keeps watching. Todoroki won\u2019t use his fire again, and Kacchan\u2014\nKacchan is losing his temper.\nIt finally happens. Izuku feels the blow land before he sees it, and the force of it whips his head to the side and sends him slamming back against the wall with a muffled cry that the spectators nearly drown out. His head swims, and the pain of getting hit in the face pushes the tears to spill over.\nAll-Might\u2019s hand is on his shoulder again, steadying him before he can fall. \u201cMidoriya\u2014my boy are you all\u2026 right\u2026?\u201d His voice trails off, and Izuku tastes the blood running from his nose.\n\u201cOw,\u201d he whispers.\nHis mentor stares at him, then turns to look out at the field, and then back to Izuku. Comprehension lights up in his eyes, and his grip on Izuku\u2019s shoulder tightens. Izuku pushes forward to keep watching his soulmate fight.\nIt\u2019s not long before Izuku can see which way the match will end. Ice alone can\u2019t stand up to Kacchan\u2019s power and viciousness, and Izuku can see and feel Todoroki flagging. The cold is making his bones ache even as the explosions burn.\nDon\u2019t give up, Izuku thinks. He thinks he also screams it out loud, trying in vain to pitch his voice above the roar of the crowd.\nThe match ends with the ring torn to pieces and Kacchan yelling his fury in Todoroki\u2019s face. Izuku leans back against the wall again, breathing through the pain that thunders through the bond. All-Might hovers over him, his gaunt face solemn and understanding.\nThe bleeding has long stopped, but the tears keep coming. There\u2019s no lying or excusing his way out of this one. \u201cIt\u2019s Todoroki,\u201d he whispers.\nUnderstanding turns to dismay. \u201cMy boy, you should have said something.\u201d\nIzuku shakes his head.\nAll-Might heaves a sigh. \u201cI assume he knows as well, by now?\u201d\n\u201cI just found out today,\u201d Izuku answers in a voice that breaks. \u201cBut Todoroki, he\u2014all this time, I\u2019ve been hurting myself, and breaking myself, and\u2026 and he never said anything.\u201d His vision goes blurry. \u201cHe told me so I\u2019d know before we fought. So it\u2019d be fair.\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRecovery Girl\u2019s right.\u201d Izuku tries to take a breath, but it shudders and trembles on the way out. \u201cI have to fix this. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t keep hurting myself. I can\u2019t keep hurting him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn.\u201d All-Might\u2019s hand moves to gently ruffle his hair. \u201cI know you will.\u201d\nShouto isn\u2019t expecting All-Might to pull him into a hug during the medal ceremony, but he does, and Shouto\u2019s not entirely sure how to react.\nBefore his teacher pulls back, his whisper reaches Shouto\u2019s ear. \u201cIf you can, talk to young Midoriya before you go.\u201d\nShouto takes that as a suggestion, and heads for the exit. He\u2019s not eager to go home, but he\u2019s eager to be out of here. He doesn\u2019t want to look at Bakugou, or Tokoyami, or any of his classmates, and if all goes well then he can get out of here before\u2014\n\u201cT-Todoroki?\u201d\nHe considers, for a moment, feigning deafness and walking on. It\u2019s not as if Midoriya\u2019s in any shape to stop him.\nIn the length of time he takes to consider it, Midoriya catches up to him. \u201cI-I just wanted to talk to you, before you go. If that\u2019s okay?\u201d\nIt\u2019s only fair, Shouto decides. He was the one who pulled Midoriya aside first.\nThey find somewhere quiet, away from the departing spectators and student exits where their classmates might catch them. Midoriya doesn\u2019t speak at first. There\u2019s blood on his face, and Shouto remembers the hits he took from Bakugou.\n(They were familiar, and the thought makes him sick.)\n\u201cWell?\u201d he says, when Midoriya takes too long to speak. \u201cWas there something you wanted to say, or not?\u201d\nHe\u2019s not sure what he expected from Midoriya. But then his soulm\u2014classmate, goddamn it, classmate\u2014takes a deep breath to speak, and it shudders and catches on the way in.\nShouto has seen Midoriya cry before, from a safe distance after the cavalry battle. But now it\u2019s up close and personal, with no buffer of space or people to separate them. It\u2019s too close, too quiet, too visceral, and Shouto doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya chokes out, before Shouto can untangle his own reaction. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d Shouto can feel the edge of faint panic creeping in.\n\u201cI hurt you.\u201d Tears flow freely down Midoriya\u2019s battered face. \u201cW-when I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t\u2014I was little, and I couldn\u2019t use my quirk, and I couldn\u2019t fight back. I couldn\u2019t stop them. I wasn\u2019t strong enough. I-I\u2019m sorry you had to feel that, on top of everything else, and\u2014\u201d Breath hisses sharply into Midoriya\u2019s lungs. \u201cUm. When\u2014when we were twelve.\u201d\nShouto\u2019s gut twists, and then Midoriya makes a small noise that twists harder.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I-I just\u2014you were in pain. And I could feel it, and it w-wouldn\u2019t stop, and\u2014and I got scared. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I just wanted it to stop, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Midoriya shakes as he presses the palm of his left hand to his face in an effort to stem the tears, but they won\u2019t stop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I keep hurting you and I\u2019m sorry you were alone. I was alone too but it wasn\u2019t like it was for you, and\u2014and I\u2019m gonna do better from here, and get stronger, so nobody hurts me and I don\u2019t have to hurt myself. Or you.\u201d\nHe should say something to this. There must be something he can say. But his mouth is sandpaper-dry, his tongue like lead, his mind empty of words. All he can think of is the resentment that he\u2019s allowed to build over the years and fester in recent weeks, and the sight of Midoriya guilt-ridden and crying leaves him sick with shame.\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d Midoriya draws his arm across his face again. The tears still run, but the shaking and sobbing have quieted and stopped. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can, yet, but I\u2019ll try, I promise. I don\u2019t want to hurt you anymore. I didn\u2019t ever want to hurt you.\u201d He won\u2019t meet Shouto\u2019s eyes again. \u201cA-anyway, that\u2019s all I wanted to say. Sorry for taking your time, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt went both ways, didn\u2019t it?\u201d The words barely pass through Shouto\u2019s mind before they\u2019re out. Midoriya blinks at him with red-rimmed eyes, and Shouto tries to swallow against the dry ache in his throat. \u201cI hurt you, too. You said so yourself. It\u2026 it couldn\u2019t have been easy for you. Having to feel all of that.\u201d He can\u2019t help looking to Midoriya\u2019s left arm as he says this.\nMidoriya follows his eyes to the faint words scarred into his skin. His mouth twists, and he moves his arm behind his back.\nShouto\u2019s hands curl into fists. His chest feels odd\u2014it\u2019s not quite pain, but it\u2019s not pleasant either. \u201cYou should know\u2014you did.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nThe ache in his throat grows thicker. This memory is not one that he relishes. \u201cYou\u2014you stopped it. He was angry that day, and he wasn\u2019t letting up, but then you\u2014well. He saw that, and he stopped.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya says softly. The tears have stopped, but he still avoids Shouto\u2019s eyes. \u201cG-good. I mean\u2026 I\u2019m glad I could do something.\u201d His left hand makes a fist. \u201cI think\u2014that was the worst part. You know? I could feel how much you were hurting, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I couldn\u2019t make it better, and\u2014I couldn\u2019t even just be there for you. That\u2019s part of why I wanted so bad to be a hero. I wanted to find you, and find out what was hurting you, and make it stop.\u201d A bitter little laugh escapes him. \u201cGuess I didn\u2019t see this coming.\u201d\nShouto gapes at him. \u201cYou\u2026 wanted to be a hero\u2026 because of me?\u201d\n\u201cS-sort of?\u201d There isn\u2019t much joy in the smile Midoriya gives him. \u201cI just thought\u2026 it felt like you needed help.\u201d\nAnd for the first time in years, the quiet voices in his head that nudge his actions don\u2019t sound like his father at all.\n\nWhenever you\u2019re in pain, your soulmate will feel it, too. That\u2019s how they know you need help.\n\nHis eyes burn. \u201cI...\u201d\n And then Midoriya moves far more quickly than a battered teenager with one arm in a sling has any right to. For the second time that day, Shouto finds himself with arms around him. One slung around his neck, the other wrapped gingerly around his back. He goes still with shock.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Midoriya says into his shoulder. \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to do this, too. For a long time.\u201d\n\nNever, Shouto. They\u2019d never hurt you. They love you.\n\nHe has to be careful, returning the hug. He\u2019s caused Midoriya enough pain over the years.\nShouto hasn\u2019t been touched like this for a long time.\nHe wishes now that he could have done this sooner, so that the first time he touched his soulmate could be a hug instead of a punch.\nPart of him doesn\u2019t want to let go.\n\u201cYou said before that it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Midoriya says, and shame twists inside of Shouto. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve changed your mind, but it does mean something to me.\u201d At last he pulls back, and there\u2019s something soft about him as he fidgets sheepishly and steps away. \u201cI\u2019ll, um. Let you go now. But I\u2019m really happy I found you. Or you found me. Either one.\u201d\nShouto manages, through some miracle, to say \u201cMe, too,\u201d before Midoriya moves out of hearing range. His soulmate looks back, and Shouto can\u2019t remember the last time anyone smiled at him like that.\n\u201cSee you around?\u201d Midoriya says.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d slips out, and Shouto lets it.\n\nThat\u2019s what soulmates are for.\n"
