All I can say is that my brain is a very strange place.</p>\n<p>Warnings for a view of a/b/o that involves a lot of serious discussions of whether or not consent can be granted in this sort of setting. I'm not trying to kinkshame anyone here, just exploring the concept. Plus there is a detailed description of a past rape and a suicide attempt (not in the first chapter, but later in the fic). So yeah, definitely some triggery material in here, take care of yourselves!</p>\n<p>I was asked to warn about the scene where the past rape is discussed, so, that's in this chapter. To avoid it, when you get to Stiles and Derek on a stake-out, you can skip ahead, just search for the word 'dating' and it'll take you to the bit where they're talking about that. ^_^</p>\n<p>this chapter is very nsfw =D</p>",
    "text": "The decision Derek makes to transfer to Beacon Hills is an easy one. He has no family, no significant other, no real reason to stay where he is. He lives in a one-bedroom apartment with his cat. The pay in Beacon Hills will be better, and to be honest, the idea of working in a small town is more appealing than the city.\nHe arrives for the first day on the job in his neatly pressed uniform and reports to the captain, a man who\u2019s only a few years his senior, named Jordan Parrish. He hadn\u2019t met him before, having interviewed with the sergeant and the administrative assistant. \u201cHave a seat,\u201d Parrish says, gesturing at the seat across from himself, and Derek sits.\nThey exchange pleasantries, Parrish asks about his experiences working in Los Angeles. About five minutes go by before Parrish glances at his watch and says, \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to partner you with Stilinski. He\u2019s a bit younger than you but his father was a sheriff so he\u2019s lived and breathed police work since he was in diapers. Don\u2019t let him give you any shit.\u201d\nDerek bites back a smile. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cOne other thing.\u201d Parrish hesitates for a moment before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re an alpha, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nDerek is surprised by the question. It\u2019s not precisely rude to ask, but most people consider it something of a taboo subject. But he grew up with it; he\u2019s not ashamed of it. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\u201cStilinski is an omega. Sometimes . . . alphas have problems working with him.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Derek can see why Parrish is concerned, even if he needn\u2019t be. Despite all the efforts to educate the public about the exact relationship between alphas and omegas, most regular humans will never really understand it. And sometimes alphas play up the attraction between the two for dramatic reasons, further muddying the waters. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem, sir.\u201d\nParrish hesitates again. \u201cLook, Hale. I\u2019m not saying all alphas become beasts ruled by their impulses whenever they see or smell an omega. I know that\u2019s not true. I know that you\u2019re in just as much control of yourself as I am. There are . . . circumstances, with Stilinski, that can make it difficult for alphas. I just want your word that you\u2019ll let me know if you have a problem.\u201d\nDerek has absolutely no idea what that means, but this man is his boss now, so he nods and says, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Dismissed.\u201d\nDerek heads out into the precinct feeling baffled by this conversation, and now more than a bit uneasy about meeting his new partner. He scans the room and immediately narrows in on Stiles; he\u2019s one of only two omegas in the precinct, and the other doesn\u2019t seem to be in the room at the moment. Derek heads over and extends a hand. \u201cDerek Hale. I guess I\u2019m your new partner.\u201d\nThe other man looks a little startled, but not uncomfortable the way Derek feels. \u201cOh, hey! I\u2019m Stiles.\u201d He shakes Derek\u2019s hand.\n\u201cIs that a nickname?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles waves a police report at him, and Derek peers at it.\n\u201cMieczyslaw Stilinski,\u201d he says, and sees Stiles\u2019 jaw sag at his accurate pronunciation. \u201cPolish?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah, wow. How\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\u201cI moved around a lot when I was a kid. Army brat. Spent three years on a base in Germany, and I wound up learning bits and pieces of a lot of European languages. Put a page of Polish in front of me and I\u2019d know how to pronounce it but I wouldn\u2019t have a damned clue what I was saying.\u201d\n\u201cSo I can still insult you in Polish? Okay, good to know,\u201d Stiles says, and grins at him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you around.\u201d\nTwenty minutes later, they\u2019re in the car, and Derek is still trying to work out what the hell Parrish had been talking about. Sure, he can see how Stiles would annoy some people. He\u2019s a ball of frenetic energy, always talking, never still. It doesn\u2019t annoy Derek, who just lets it wash over him like he\u2019s a rock in a river, but he can see how some people would want to kill him. He can also see how some people would find his know-it-all attitude about police procedure obnoxious. But that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Stiles being an omega. That\u2019s just Stiles being Stiles.\nAfter the first day, he shrugs it off. Whatever Parrish had been talking about undoubtedly stemmed from some human misunderstanding about the relationship between an alpha and an omega. It\u2019s not anything to worry about.\nAs to Stiles\u2019 status as an omega, that just isn\u2019t Derek\u2019s business unless Stiles brings it up. At Stiles\u2019 age, it\u2019s safe to assume that he has a steady partner, or at the very least knows where to find one when he needs one. Derek will need to find a partner as well, but alphas go into heat far less often than omegas \u2013 about once every six months rather than every six weeks \u2013 so he has plenty of time.\nStiles really turns out to be the best sort of partner once Derek learns to tune out his rambling. He\u2019s extremely competent, but doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. He also knows everyone. \u201cI grew up here,\u201d he tells Derek, after the third time he\u2019s recognized during their first shift. \u201cAnd my dad was the county sheriff for years, so, basically everyone knows me.\u201d\nThe job is less stressful, too. Sure, it isn\u2019t nothing. There are domestic disputes and theft, vandalism and drugs and DUIs. But there\u2019s no gang violence in Beacon Hills, no drive-by shootings. His entire first week passes without an incident that involves a gun.\nMore often it\u2019s rounding up the drunks at last call, manning the speed trap just around the curve where the speed limit drops from forty-five to thirty, and responding to car accidents. There\u2019s a four-year-old who goes missing only to be found a few hours later playing with frogs at a nearby creek. Some bored teenagers who get caught with more marijuana than they know what to do with. A guy who\u2019s caught drugging drinks at a bar.\nDerek finds himself admiring Stiles more than he would have expected. He\u2019s just honestly a good cop. He\u2019s thorough and meticulous when questioning the parents of the missing boy. Compassionate enough to let the stupid teenagers off with a slap on the wrist even though they could have been charged with possession (but not so compassionate that he doesn\u2019t call their parents). Flat out badass when the asshole would-be rapist tries to pull a gun on them when it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s caught.\nBy the time a month has gone by, Derek has basically forgotten about Parrish\u2019s warning. He\u2019s only reminded of it when he smells Stiles\u2019 heat coming on. From his experience, most omegas start to give off the telltale scent about twenty-four hours before the heat starts. He doesn\u2019t say anything about it, though. Even to people who don\u2019t consider it a taboo, mentioning it is impolite.\nAt the end of their shift, when he\u2019s changing back into his street clothes, Stiles clears his throat and says, \u201cSo, uh. I\u2019m gonna be out for a couple days.\u201d\nDerek glances at him and nods acknowledgement. It would be impossible for an omega to work during their heat, so accommodations are made. \u201cI figured Captain Parrish would probably just have me catch up on paperwork or clean up the evidence room or something.\u201d\n\u201cNah, he\u2019ll just send you to work as a crossing guard for a few days.\u201d Stiles makes the joke, but it comes without his usual grin. Derek is thinking about asking if he\u2019s okay, before Stiles turns to change, and strips his shirt over his head. At that, Derek forgets about their conversation and has to turn away for a moment. Sure, alphas are in control of their instincts. But every once in a while, it can be difficult, and when an omega on the cusp of heat, an omega that he\u2019s already attracted to, starts taking their clothes off in front of him, is one of those times.\nHe doesn\u2019t dare turn around until he hears Stiles\u2019 locker shut. \u201cSee you in a few days, then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles hesitates for a brief moment. \u201cLook, uh . . . if, uh, when I get back, if . . .\u201d\nDerek frowns at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Stiles grabs his bag. \u201cNever mind. Enjoy the evidence room.\u201d\nDerek is again left confused, but he doesn\u2019t say anything, letting Stiles depart. Some people get weird when they\u2019re going into heat. And it\u2019s possible (can he even hope that it\u2019s possible?) that if Stiles is attracted to him, he was having thoughts of asking Derek to join him during it. But if that\u2019s what was going on, it was good that he hadn\u2019t. Making decisions at this point in the cycle was never a good idea. Stiles could spend this heat with whatever partner he had previously arranged, and they could have a detailed discussion about it later.\nHe goes home, feeds his cat, grills himself some burgers and eats dinner. Work the next day is just as boring as anticipated. He does paperwork and prepares for a court case he\u2019s going to be doing the next week for a string of car thefts. The next day is more of the same.\nHe\u2019s a little surprised when Stiles isn\u2019t back on the third day, but not entirely. An omega\u2019s heat lasts anywhere between twenty-four and forty-eight hours. Some of them are fit to go back to normal activities right away, but sometimes they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s not entirely unusual to need a third day to recuperate. Derek has a momentary pang of jealousy, thinking of what Stiles\u2019 alpha must have been doing to him so that he required a day of rest.\nAll of that is forgotten when he sees Stiles in the locker room the next day. He looks wrecked, pale and gaunt like he\u2019s dropped a bunch of weight over the last three days. There are dark circles under his eyes, and his lips are ragged, like he\u2019s chewed them raw.\nTact and social mores are completely relegated to the back of Derek\u2019s brain, and without thinking, he blurts out, \u201cDid you spend your heat alone?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 head jerks around in surprise, and then he flushes pink and looks away. His voice comes out brusque and unfriendly. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I spend every heat alone.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s jaw sags, and he stares at Stiles. He can\u2019t even comprehend it for a few moments. He\u2019s never spent a heat alone, but he\u2019s heard about what it\u2019s like. He\u2019s heard that it\u2019s agony that can\u2019t be put into words. Heard about people who have hurt themselves in the efforts to find relief. Every time he\u2019s heard of an omega who had to endure a heat alone, they talk about how they never want to go through that again. He\u2019s also heard that it gets worse over time, that every heat spent alone is more painful than the last. \u201cWhy?\u201d he finally asks.\nStiles slams his locker shut, but when he turns to face Derek, his face has more grief than anything else. He stops and takes a deep breath. \u201cLook. I. I understand if you don\u2019t want to be my partner. Most alphas can\u2019t, can\u2019t deal with it when this happens. They want to.\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cHelp me out. You know? But I, I have reasons for doing what I do. So if it\u2019s going to be a problem for you, just tell Parrish. He can assign you to someone new.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that \u2013 look, it\u2019s your business, I won\u2019t \u2013 impose,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re obviously in pain, and, and yeah. It\u2019s really hard for an alpha to see an omega in pain. Especially for this reason.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Stiles rubs a hand over the back of his head. \u201cAnd I know it doesn\u2019t make sense to you. It doesn\u2019t have to. You don\u2019t have to understand it. I just need you to respect it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Derek can\u2019t help but stare at him. He doesn\u2019t understand it. What could drive someone to hurt themselves like that? \u201cYou know, if you were raised in one of those families where \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cStop. Don\u2019t do that. No, I wasn\u2019t raised in a fundamentalist family. I know there\u2019s nothing wrong with being omega. I don\u2019t judge other omegas or alphas, for that matter, for doing what they do. So don\u2019t judge me for what I do. Or I\u2019ll talk to Parrish.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek lifts his hands in surrender. \u201cAre you going to be okay to patrol?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be back at work if I wasn\u2019t. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nTo say that the day is awkward would be an understatement. Derek tries not to think about it, but he can\u2019t help it. It nags at the back of his brain. He keeps imagining what the last few days have been like for Stiles. He\u2019s never gone through a heat cycle alone, but one time his partner got stuck in traffic and was an hour late, and Derek vividly remembers that hour, how he was ready to claw his own skin to shreds just to get away from the intense cravings heat brought on. To hear that Stiles does that every time, that he does it voluntarily, he just can\u2019t make sense of it.\nFortunately for Derek, the day is busy. There\u2019s a three car accident in the morning rush hour, and one of the people involved starts literally trying to beat the shit out of the person who cut them off and caused it. It takes a couple hours to get all of that sorted out, by which point there\u2019s another call waiting for them because some jerk got disruptive at a coffee shop when they messed up his order.\nStiles is clearly feeling a little better the next day, even if he\u2019s still quiet. He keeps looking at Derek like he\u2019s waiting for the other shoe to drop. By the third day, he\u2019s back to his usual self. Derek can\u2019t help but wonder exactly how many partners he\u2019s lost because of this problem. Stiles\u2019 problem isn\u2019t just whatever\u2019s causing him to spend his heat alone \u2013 he\u2019s also clearly convinced that Derek is going to ditch him. Derek resolves that this will not happen.\nThat\u2019s easy to say during the month, but the weeks creep by and he finds himself bracing for it despite himself. The instant he smells Stiles\u2019 heat coming on, he practically has to duct tape his own mouth shut to keep from asking if he\u2019s going to spend it alone, is he sure, Derek would be happy to spend it with him, there\u2019s no reason for him to do this to himself. When Stiles leaves for the day with the same \u2018I\u2019m going to be out for a few days\u2019 speech, Derek slumps into a chair and realizes that his fingernails have dug furrows into his palms.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he says. He won\u2019t ask to change partners. He won\u2019t. But he feels like he has to understand.\nA little snooping leads him to a popular cop bar in the town next door. There\u2019s only one alpha in the cluster of police officers who are clearly enjoying their off time, and Derek hesitates but approaches. \u201cScott McCall?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s up?\u201d Scott is about the same age as Stiles, with an open, friendly face.\n\u201cI, uh, I\u2019m Derek Hale, with the Beacon Hills police.\u201d\n\u201cOh, hey! Nice to meet you.\u201d Scott shakes his hand like they\u2019re old friends. \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering if I could ask some incredibly impolite and invasive questions,\u201d Derek says, and Scott laughs. \u201cSee, uh. I\u2019m new to the force over there, and . . . partnered with Stilinski.\u201d\nThe smile immediately falls off Scott\u2019s face. He doesn\u2019t look angry, but upset. He looks away briefly, then says, \u201cOkay, yeah. And you want to ask me questions because I was Stiles\u2019 most recent partner. Let\u2019s get a drink.\u201d\nDerek is happy to have alcohol to help ease this conversation along. They get a table in the corner. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to intrude like this. It\u2019s just \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYou have to understand.\u201d Scott nods. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. And I wish I could help you out, but I can\u2019t. He won\u2019t talk about it. Any effort to get him to talk about it, and he\u2019ll just tell you to talk to the captain about changing partners if it bothers you.\u201d He takes a long pull at his beer. \u201cI told myself I could handle it, you know? That it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I have a steady partner \u2013 hell, I have a wife.\u201d Scott holds up his hand to display the wedding ring. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have mattered. I made it through four cycles before I had to get away from it. I transferred precincts and everything because I just \u2013 couldn\u2019t watch him do that to himself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on the second.\u201d Derek pushes a hand through his hair and tries to hide his disappointment. He suddenly doesn\u2019t know why he came here, why he expected that this guy would have the answers.\n\u201cLook, this is just my opinion, but if I were you, I would ask to transfer now.\u201d Scott sets his beer down. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna do it sooner rather than later, and it\u2019ll suck less for both of you if you just get it over with.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. I just feel like \u2013 he\u2019s waiting for someone not to abandon him.\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the vibe I got from him. He just looked so fucking sad when he told me I could ask to change partners if I wanted.\u201d\n\u201cI get it, but that\u2019s his choice, you know? He knows it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Scott sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I wish I had answers for you. I really do.\u201d\nDerek thanks him and heads back home. He paces for a large part of the night, nearly driven out of his skin by the idea that Stiles, energetic, sarcastic Stiles, is suffering. He works out for a bit and eventually has a few drinks so he can sleep. He wishes it wasn\u2019t the weekend. Work would be a blessed distraction right now.\nHe ends up at the precinct anyway, and knocks on Parrish\u2019s door. Parrish looks up, sees him, and sighs. \u201cCome on in.\u201d\nDerek does, and shuts the door behind himself. \u201cI\u2019m not asking to change partners,\u201d he opens with. \u201cI just wanted to ask a question, if I could.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to know why I would ever pair Stiles up with an alpha partner to begin with,\u201d Parrish says, and gives a little smile. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the first to ask that question. And no, before you posit your theory, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll eventually find the one that can change his mind. I\u2019ve known Stiles since he was seventeen, and nothing changes his mind.\u201d\n\u201cWas he . . .\u201d Derek trails off, because among all the various things that aren\u2019t his business, that is definitely one of them.\nParrish answers anyway. \u201cAs far as I know, yes. He doesn\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s my understanding that Stiles has never spent a heat with a partner.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s mind shies away from that. \u201cThen \u2013 maybe he just doesn\u2019t understand \u2013 \u201d\nParrish gives him a tired look.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Derek rubs his hands over his face. \u201cHe has his reasons and it\u2019s his choice to make. But, seriously, why do you give him alpha partners?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the fourth alpha partner he\u2019s had, and there\u2019s been a different reason each time,\u201d Parrish says. \u201cThe first time it was because we didn\u2019t know any better. It . . . went badly. We weren\u2019t prepared for it. He ended up being transferred to a different city. Second time, we thought, okay, we know it might be a problem, but personnel issues kind of forced my hand. His regular partner, who was human, went on maternity leave, and I didn\u2019t have anyone else I could partner with him. We all went into it with open eyes, and the instant there was a problem, I separated them and put Stiles on desk duty until Erica was back. He was with her for two years before she got promoted to sergeant and transferred. Again, I was strapped for better choices. We talked about it and decided to give it a try again. We thought that if any alpha could handle the problem, it would be Scott McCall. He was married with kids, has been with the same omega partner since his teens, so we hoped it wouldn\u2019t bother him. And he tried, Lord knows he tried not to let it, but he eventually said he couldn\u2019t handle it and asked to be transferred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now there\u2019s me,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cStiles had been on desk duty for six months and he was driving all of us bonkers. I shuffled people, gave him a chance in the field when I could, but it wasn\u2019t the same as having a regular partner. When I hired you, somehow it got overlooked in the paperwork that you were an alpha. So I had already told Stiles I had a partner for him, he was going to be back in the field regularly, and he was ecstatic. I realized the problem the day before you got here. He begged me to give it a chance, said he was losing his mind driving a desk. We thought maybe the problem was that we had overexplained in the past, primed the alphas to get upset about it, so we decided to just tell you to let us know if there was a problem.\u201d\nDerek sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to not be his partner, so I guess I\u2019ll just have to deal with it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. For giving him a chance. He\u2019s a great cop, and I hate to waste his talent. So just . . . keep me posted, okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nWhen Stiles comes in on Monday, he\u2019s exhausted and moving stiffly, like he\u2019s still in some pain. Derek orders himself not to mention it, but he can barely even look at Stiles, which leads to a lot of awkward silences while they cruise around town, both of them hoping desperately that something will happen to distract them.\nIt\u2019s a quiet few days, which only makes things more awkward, as both of them decidedly don\u2019t talk about it. It takes almost a week for things to get back to normal, and even then, there\u2019s that terrible sense of waiting. Derek thinks about what Scott had said, and wonders if maybe it would be better if he just chopped this off at the knees now. Certainly it\u2019s what Stiles expects him to do.\nHe\u2019s thinking about that more and more as the cycle draws to a close when they walk into the station at the end of their shift and he sees Stiles\u2019 face genuinely light up. \u201cErica!\u201d he shouts, waving madly at a blonde woman across the station.\nShe turns and smiles back. \u201cHey, Stiles!\u201d she says, and walks over to wrap her arms around him in a tight hug. She sees Derek behind him and says, \u201cDamn, nice! You traded up!\u201d\nStiles flushes pink and punches her in the shoulder. \u201cErica, this is my new partner, Derek Hale. Derek, Erica. She was my partner for two years before she got promoted and transferred.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Derek says, shaking her hand.\n\u201cLikewise.\u201d She rakes her eyes up and down him, then grins at Stiles. \u201cI\u2019m back, bitch!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes light up with excitement.\n\u201cYep. Sergeant Reyes of the Beacon Hills PD, reporting for service. Since Lahey was getting transferred, a position opened up here and I swooped in and took it. Knew you chuckleheads couldn\u2019t live without me. Still a sergeant, though,\u201d she adds, as Stiles opens his mouth, \u201cso you can keep your new partner.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, yeah, right,\u201d Stiles says, shifting uncomfortably.\n\u201cHow are you two handling that?\u201d Erica asks, frank and forthright unlike the way everyone else tiptoes around the subject when they\u2019re both present. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a couple cycles together now, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles\u2019 gaze darts to Derek like he\u2019s not sure what the answer is.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek says, then adds, \u201cI won\u2019t lie and say it\u2019s easy, but, you know, we\u2019re handling it.\u201d\n\u201cFor now,\u201d Stiles mumbles.\nErica sighs and dramatically rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, I can see that we have a lot of catching up to do. Come on, I\u2019ll take you out for a drink. Nice to meet you, Derek,\u201d she adds over her shoulder as she tows Stiles away.\nWhatever they talk about, it must help, because Stiles is in relatively good spirits the next day, even with his heat coming on. They part with minimal awkwardness.\nSomehow, Derek isn\u2019t surprised when he comes in the next day and Erica immediately nabs him. \u201cHey, since you\u2019re without a partner for a few days, you can partner up with me. I\u2019ve been super nostalgic for that speed trap out on Rock Hill Road. Seriously, those assholes make the best faces. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Derek is actually thrilled with this development, because Erica clearly wants to talk to him in private, so he feels like he might finally get some answers to his five hundred questions. They drive out to the edge of town and pull off onto the shoulder where the cruiser will be hidden by the curve.\n\u201cSo here\u2019s the deal, Hale,\u201d Erica says, without preamble. \u201cStiles is a good friend of mine, and I want to make sure I\u2019m not going to have to break your kneecaps.\u201d\n\u201cI prefer them unbroken myself,\u201d Derek agrees. They clock the first car coming around the curve at thirty-four.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lasted two cycles, which is better than a couple jackholes have done, but McCall made it four before he finally peaced out. I don\u2019t want you to do that to Stiles. And he said you\u2019ve been pretty cool about the whole thing, so, I thought I\u2019d give you the shovel talk.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Derek says, giving her a sideways glance. \u201cYou\u2019re a beta, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So yes, before you mention it, I know that I can never really understand what it\u2019s like for either of you. Stiles compared it to drugs, once. Said the cravings felt like that but were twice as bad, and going without was physically comparable to heroin withdrawal. Which I also can\u2019t relate to, because I\u2019ve never done heroin. But I get the idea.\u201d\n\u201cFor him. But not for me.\u201d\n\u201cFair.\u201d Erica glances at the radar as another car comes around the curve. Forty-two. \u201cEh, not worth it.\u201d She leans back in her seat. \u201cLook. I can\u2019t tell you why Stiles does what he does. I mean, even if I knew, which I don\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t give away his secrets. But I can tell you how to help him without putting your dick in him.\u201d\nDerek frowns at her. \u201cThanks for that. I think.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you, here,\u201d Erica says. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve obviously got a thing for him that has nothing to do with alphas and omegas \u2013 don\u2019t even start with me, I\u2019m not an idiot. You\u2019ve obviously got a thing for him. And I know from hearing about what happened with McCall what\u2019s going to happen now. He comes back, you tiptoe around the subject, there\u2019s a whole lot of awkward silence, and the end result is that Stiles feels like some sort of freak who should be in the circus.\u201d\nDerek winces. It\u2019s accurate, and he knows it. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, in this car with you, so I can \u2013 forty-eight, nice!\u201d Erica jams the car into gear and flips on the bubble lights.\nTen minutes and an extremely disgruntled driver later, they\u2019re back at the side of the road. \u201cSo what am I supposed to do?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you guys have to have an in-depth discussion about it,\u201d Erica says, much to Derek\u2019s relief. \u201cBut you need to not treat it like he\u2019s insane. Treat it like he\u2019s been sick or something. When he comes back in, bring him some donuts or something, say you brought them because you know he probably still feels a little woogly. Ask him if he wants you to drive. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t stare at him. He hates it when you guys stare.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it help?\u201d Erica asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek admits.\n\u201cThen suffer, bitch.\u201d\nDerek snorts.\n\u201cLook, he likes you, and he\u2019s so sick of feeling like nothing in his life will ever work out just because of this whole stupid heat thing. So just, just try to act normal around him. I promise that it\u2019ll help.\u201d\nDerek isn\u2019t sure about that, but she knows Stiles a lot better than he does, so he decides to give it a whirl. He knows that Stiles likes ridiculous coffee drinks, so on the way to the station on the day he expects Stiles to be back, he stops and gets him a caramel frappuccino. When Stiles comes into the locker room, practically stumbling with exhaustion, Derek holds it out to him. \u201cFigured you would probably need a pick-me-up today,\u201d he says. Stiles blinks at him in surprise, but takes the drink and thanks him. \u201cYou want me to drive, or would you rather?\u201d\n\u201cOh, uh, you can,\u201d Stiles says, still clearly a little surprised. But he starts drinking the coffee, and it does start to perk him up a little.\n\u201cSeen the trailer for the new Star Wars movie?\u201d Derek asks casually as they start their patrol, because if anything can cheer Stiles up, it\u2019s going to be Star Wars. It works like a charm. Stiles forgets all about his fatigue and his pain and starts giving an in-depth critique of every frame of the trailer.\nErica was right about one thing \u2013 it restores their relationship back to normal much more quickly than the previous few times. Stiles is basically back to his usual self by lunch time. They eat at the Greek deli and he\u2019s smiling, although still clearly tired, at the end of the day. Erica glances up from her desk as they come in, and gives Derek a genuine smile.\nSince that seems to work, Derek figures he can roll with it. The days approaching Stiles\u2019 heat are still bad \u2013 those are the worst days for him, as he fights down his own instincts \u2013 but the days afterwards can clearly be managed. Just knowing that he\u2019s helping Stiles feel better afterwards helps him fight his impulse to try to help during.\nSo he\u2019s a little nonplussed at the end of the next cycle, when he shows up for work with another ridiculous coffee monstrosity and Stiles isn\u2019t there. Parrish catches him just outside the locker room and says, \u201cStiles called this morning and said he\u2019s going to be out an extra day this time. Go see Sergeant Reyes, she\u2019ll give you something to do.\u201d\nDerek is hoping that Erica will have something to say about Stiles\u2019 extended absence, but she doesn\u2019t. She just takes the coffee that he had bought for Stiles, gives him a list of tasks, and puts him to work.\nThe next morning comes. Derek brings the coffee. Stiles looks as haggard as ever, but he takes the coffee and even smiles a bit, apologizes for being gone an extra day, and then immediately starts talking about a book he thinks Derek would like.\nThe next week, Stiles surprises him by saying, \u201cSo your heat must be coming up, huh?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Derek gives him the side-eye. He\u2019s felt it creeping up on him for the last week. Alphas don\u2019t go into heat as often as omegas, but it lasts longer, and it\u2019s more gradual. Still, he didn\u2019t think he had been giving off any signs. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\u201cI own a calendar,\u201d Stiles says, looking at him with an amused expression. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little over six months since you came here. You\u2019ve gotta be due soon.\u201d\n\u201cVery soon, yeah.\u201d Derek folds his arms over his stomach and hopes that Stiles doesn\u2019t take this conversation the wrong way. He finds himself wondering, if Stiles himself doesn\u2019t submit when he\u2019s in heat, would he have a problem having sex with a partner who was in heat? Where exactly is the problem? \u201cI\u2019ve been, uh, looking for a partner on the ABO website. You know.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, see anyone you like?\u201d Stiles asks, and when Derek blinks at him, he rolls his eyes. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t judge other people for what they do.\u201d\n\u201cI guess you did.\u201d Derek sighs and forces his posture to loosen up a little. It\u2019s hard to find an unattached omega without help, which is why he\u2019s been looking on the web. Omegas outnumber alphas, and they\u2019re more likely to have steady partners, since their heats come on more frequently. But there are some who don\u2019t, who like to have some variety. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve sent a couple messages but haven\u2019t gotten any hits. I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have to go back to LA.\u201d\n\u201cHere, call this number.\u201d Stiles has his phone out and is texting. \u201cThere\u2019s this omega I know, Danny? Who\u2019s basically always game. And you\u2019re his type. He doesn\u2019t go online because some stalker doxxed him once and it really put him off of it. But he would totally be up for it if I vouched for you. I\u2019ll text him to let him know you\u2019ll be calling.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek says, surprised.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to . . .\u201d Stiles flushes pink and looks away, but when he speaks, his voice is steady. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to do what I do. It sucks. So. Danny will help you out.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek fiddles with his phone for a minute. \u201cHey, six months, huh? We\u2019ve been partners for six months. We should celebrate.\u201d\nStiles smiles a little at that. \u201cOkay, yeah. You want to go get a drink?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nDanny is every bit the accommodating partner that Stiles had suggested he would be, and Derek has a surprisingly good time with him. They part with a wink and a \u2018call me\u2019, from Danny, and Derek heads back to work feeling good. The tension has been released, he got a great workout, his crops are watered and his skin is clear.\nOf course, that just makes him wonder again about Stiles, about why Stiles refuses to spend his heat with a partner. He tries not to think of it. He was gone for about a week, and Stiles isn\u2019t there when he gets back. He checks the calendar and realizes that Stiles is probably out for his own heat cycle.\nHe\u2019s not sure which day of Stiles\u2019 heat it would be, but he doesn\u2019t mind having another day or two to mellow out. That\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking until the next day, when he overhears Erica on her phone. \u201cI know, but \u2013 look, Stiles, you can take all the time you need, you\u2019re not going to get fired or anything. But I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d Her voice lowers. \u201cThey\u2019re getting worse.\u201d\nDerek wants to stay and hear the rest of the conversation, but he also doesn\u2019t want to get Reyes pissed off at him, so he goes about his business. Stiles had typically been out for three days, now it\u2019s four every time. He wonders if he didn\u2019t even need an extra day off at the beginning, since he certainly isn\u2019t suffering from overexertion.\nHe\u2019s inclined to fuss over Stiles the next day, buying him lunch and trying not to think about what Erica had said. Stiles wants to talk about how Derek did, and Derek tells him about it, but then he has to ask, he can\u2019t not ask. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t get it. You seem to understand that I had a perfectly good time during my heat, so why \u2013 why won\u2019t you let anyone help you through yours?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 jaw sets and he looks away. Derek is expecting another brush-off, but instead he gets, \u201cI just can\u2019t. When I\u2019m in heat, I\u2019d have sex with anyone with a dick. Regardless of how I felt about them twenty-four hours previous. I can\u2019t do that, Derek. It\u2019s gross. I know most people don\u2019t see it that way. I know it\u2019s probably because of what \u2013 \u201d He looks away and cuts himself off abruptly. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nDerek thinks about that very carefully for a minute, not wanting to push, but wanting to make sure Stiles gets the right information. \u201cI think most people think that if they arrange it ahead of time, consent is, you know, pre-granted.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, that isn\u2019t how consent works.\u201d Stiles swallows convulsively. \u201cEspecially knowing what it does to have to go through it alone. You know, an omega goes through a heat alone and after that, they\u2019d agree to just about anything to avoid it happening again. How is that consent?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cI guess most people just don\u2019t think of it very much. Since it\u2019s a, a biological imperative, like eating or sleeping. It\u2019s just something we do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t ask anyone to see it my way. Hell, I\u2019m happier for people if they don\u2019t see it my way, because that makes it so much easier for them. You had a great time with Danny. I\u2019m thrilled for you. I don\u2019t consider Danny a rapist because he had sex with you while you were in heat. Or vice versa, if it should ever happen that way. It\u2019s just my opinion, just my . . . way of looking at it.\u201d\nDerek lets him have that for a minute before he feels confident enough to push. \u201cBut they\u2019re getting worse, aren\u2019t they.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 intake of breath is sudden and ragged. Finally, he says, \u201cYeah.\u201d\nDerek nods and lets out a quiet breath of his own. \u201cUnderstand that I would never pressure you into anything you are uncomfortable with. Your friendship, your partnership, is more important to me than any day of heatsex could ever be. But I just want you to know that if there\u2019s anything I can do for you, whether it involves my dick or not, anything that would make this easier for you, please let me know. Okay?\u201d\nAfter a long minute, Stiles nods. \u201cOkay. And thanks.\u201d\n\u201cGood. You wanna grab a burger after work?\u201d\nStiles manages a wan, lopsided little smile. \u201cYeah. Sounds good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the seventh cycle. Derek has been in Beacon Hills for nearly a year. He knows that Stiles\u2019 heat is approaching, as he always does, and they have their usual conversation about what sort of partnerless drudgery he\u2019ll have to go through before Derek remembers he left something on his desk. He comes back into the locker room a few minutes later to find that Stiles has collapsed. He skids to his knees beside the other man, calling his name. Stiles is pale and shivering, sweat beading on his forehead.\n\u201cCame on so sudden \u2013 \u201d he chokes out, and the scent of him is so thick in the air that it practically hurts. It\u2019s all Derek can focus on for a minute.\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d he says, getting Stiles\u2019 face between his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. I\u2019ll get you home, okay?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Stiles whispers, staring up at Derek with eyes where the irises are practically swallowed by the pupils. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nIt would take less than a minute, and Derek knows it. The state he\u2019s in, Derek could take him over the bench and it would be over in two thrusts. Then Stiles could finally sleep, could finally be rid of the terrible, aching emptiness that Derek knows is consuming him. For a moment, the temptation is very real. Then Derek pushes it aside.\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d he says firmly, and Stiles moans. \u201cHey. Look at me. I need you to do something for me.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 gaze flickers to his face, focusing on the fact that an alpha is giving him orders. \u201cW-What?\u201d\n\u201cName fifty Star Wars characters.\u201d\nStiles gives a weak little chuckle. \u201cCan I,\u201d he pants for breath, \u201ccan I use the extended universe even though it isn\u2019t canon anymore?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019m going to count with you. Count with me, watch my hands.\u201d\n\u201cO-Okay. Okay. Luke. Leia. Han.\u201d Stiles focuses on Derek\u2019s hands as he counts off the characters. \u201cObi-Wan. Darth Vader . . .\u201d\nBy the time he gets to twenty, his pupils are constricting a little and his breathing is slowing down. At fifty, he\u2019s soaked with sweat but no longer shaking. Derek helps him stand up, and he\u2019s weak but moving on his own. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you home.\u201d\nStiles nods. Derek half-carries him out to the car. He slumps into the passenger seat, arms folding over his chest, hugging himself. He starts panting again, gritting his teeth against the pain. Derek feels like he should drive faster, but really, it\u2019s not like getting Stiles home is going to help. He pulls up outside the other man\u2019s apartment building about fifteen minutes later and gets him upstairs. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few days, okay?\u201d he says, and Stiles nods before collapsing onto his bed, shivering. Derek hesitates, but then goes. He can\u2019t help, and Stiles probably doesn\u2019t want to be stared at.\nIt\u2019s a long few days for Derek, but Stiles surprises him when he only misses three days, instead of four. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring coffee for you today,\u201d he says when he sees him. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t expect you to be back.\u201d\nStiles manages another little smile. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. We can stop by Peet\u2019s on our patrol.\u201d\nNeither of them say a word about what happened. Not until almost a month later, when they\u2019re sitting at the speed trap, watching cars come around the bend. They\u2019ve been there nearly half an hour before Stiles abruptly says, \u201cCan I ask you for a favor that will probably suck immensely for you to grant?\u201d\nDerek laughs a little at that. \u201cYou can always ask.\u201d\nStiles lets out a breath. \u201cWhat you did for me last month. It really helped. I\u2019m not sure why, but just \u2013 having your scent in my apartment, thinking about you holding onto me, about your hands \u2013 it made it \u2013 easier for me. It\u2019s weird, I know. But I wanted to ask if you . . . would stay with me when I go into heat again. But you have to promise me, promise that you won\u2019t fuck me. You . . . I\u2019ve never met anyone I would trust enough to do this for me. Not until you. If you don\u2019t want to, if you don\u2019t think you can, I understand. But I thought \u2013 I thought I would ask.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . not sure, to be honest,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cThat actually makes me feel better,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIf you had just agreed, I would have been suspicious that you didn\u2019t really mean it.\u201d\nDerek nods. And he does think about it. His self-control is good, but he has been tempted by Stiles, more than once, especially this most recent time. Then again, he had withstood the temptation then, even without the specific discussion beforehand. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for Stiles, but he can guess that basic tasks like making food and showering are probably beyond him while this is going on. Having someone there really might help.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have someone stay with you who isn\u2019t an alpha?\u201d he asks curiously, as they finish up their shift. \u201cYou know, to make sure you eat and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cI used to,\u201d Stiles says, not looking at him. \u201cMy dad used to stay with me. But it was getting harder for him, the worse it got for me. Erica has once or twice, but you know, she\u2019s married, she has kids and a career, she can\u2019t drop everything to stay with me for three days. And they\u2019re the only two people who haven\u2019t automatically treated me like I was crazy for doing this. I don\u2019t trust anyone else I know not to call an alpha hookup for me.\u201d\nDerek nods, understanding. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nStiles gives a little sigh of relief. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have a few questions about how you want me to handle things,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles glances over at him. \u201cI said I won\u2019t fuck you, and I won\u2019t, but what do you want me to do if you get physical with me? Should I stop you, or just let you grind one out?\u201d\nStiles flushes a little pink. \u201cUh, stop me. Not because I think that\u2019s gross, but just because I know from experience that if I jerk off, I only feel worse afterwards. Just dump me in a tub of cold water.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. That answers my second question of whether or not I should let you do that.\u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about medication? Is there anything you can take that helps?\u201d\nStiles shakes his head. \u201cWell,\u201d he modifies, \u201cif I go for the hard stuff, narcotics can get me through the worst of it. But there was a stretch while I was in college where I used narcotics to get me through a lot of stuff, if you know what I\u2019m saying. So I don\u2019t touch them anymore. Other than that, no. Tylenol, Advil, nothing touches the pain.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek lets out a breath and thinks about it for a minute. \u201cIf I come up with any other questions, I\u2019ll let you know. But I think we can do this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nDerek is nervous going into it. He\u2019s brought some things that he knows he\u2019s going to need and some things that he hopes he won\u2019t need. Stiles is edgy and nervous, but he\u2019s not fully into heat yet, so they\u2019re able to talk about books and play some cards.\nIt comes on suddenly, like it did in the precinct. Stiles is standing at the counter, pouring himself a bowl of cereal as a late night snack when he suddenly folds inward with a sharp gasp. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he moans, as Derek catches him and helps him downward. \u201cOh, God, it hurts. Derek, it hurts so bad.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Derek steers him into the bedroom and gets him lying down. Stiles curls up onto his side, trembling. \u201cI bet you can\u2019t name all the different types of Quidditch fouls.\u201d\n\u201cChallenge . . . fucking . . . accepted,\u201d Stiles says. He closes his hands and starts reciting them from memory. His fists clench and unclench, so Derek reaches out to take one of them. Stiles squeezes it hard, so hard that it hurts, but he doesn\u2019t stop talking. When he curls up tighter, Derek rubs a hand down his back, over the back of his neck.\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Stiles says about five minutes later, his body relaxing. He lets out a long, quivering sigh.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you something to drink.\u201d Derek props him up and grabs a bottle of water out of his bag. He holds it to Stiles\u2019 mouth and lets him sip. When he tries to lay Stiles back down, Stiles hangs onto him.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t let me go,\u201d he says, his voice tight and strained. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop touching me.\u201d\n\u201cSure, okay.\u201d Derek feels like this might cross a line in and of itself, but Stiles is fully clothed, and hadn\u2019t said anything about not touching him at all, so he thinks it\u2019s probably okay to keep rubbing his back. \u201cHey, let\u2019s put on a movie. You keep saying I haven\u2019t truly seen Lord of the Rings until I\u2019ve seen the extended editions, right? That\u2019ll keep us busy for a while.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles says, panting for breath. Derek gets him on his feet and guides him out to the sofa. Stiles shifts uncomfortably and whines a little when Derek puts him on the sofa and lets him go. \u201cCome ba-a-a-a-ack.\u201d\n\u201cJust a second,\u201d Derek says. He gets the DVD on and then sits down on the sofa next to him. Stiles immediately curls up next to him, climbing half onto Derek\u2019s lap and trying to grind against him. \u201cNone of that now,\u201d Derek says, removing Stiles from his lap.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Stiles whispers. \u201cPlease, Derek. Please.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay, sweetheart,\u201d Derek says, the endearment slipping out without him thinking about it. \u201cCome on, the movie\u2019s starting. Galadriel, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles rubs both hands over his face, taking several deep breaths. He manages to get through a half hour of the movie before the next wave hits. He winds up doubled over on the floor while Derek rubs his back.\n\u201cWant me to stop the movie?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNo. Leave \u2013 leave it on.\u201d Stiles curls up and grabs a pillow off the sofa. He presses his face into it and screams, his whole body going tense and rigid. He does that for a long minute before pulling away and panting out, \u201cHelps me \u2013 focus on \u2013 something else.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek sits beside him squeezes his hand while he alternates between watching the movie and screaming his lungs out into the pillow.\nIt\u2019s easier than he would have expected to control his own instincts. To be honest, he\u2019s really not feeling compelled to have sex with Stiles at all. It surprises him, but what he really feels compelled to do is help Stiles. Since Stiles seems comforted by his gestures, as little as they are, he can avoid thinking about the quicker, easier solution to the problem.\n\u201cYou should get some rest,\u201d he says, when the first movie is over. Stiles nods, groans a little, and lets Derek drag him back into the bedroom. Derek has brought along plenty of Red Bull to keep himself awake, and he\u2019s hoping Stiles will sleep.\nHe does \u2013 for about twenty minutes. Then he starts to toss and turn. Derek reaches out to smooth down his hair, and frowns when he touches Stiles\u2019 forehead. It\u2019s hot to the touch. The fact that Stiles has a fever isn\u2019t surprising, but he still doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s a little startled when Stiles grabs him by the wrist and climbs on top of him. Before Derek can react, Stiles is kissing him, desperately, his body practically glued against Derek\u2019s.\n\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d Derek says, trying to pull back. It\u2019s difficult. Stiles is strong, and every time Derek thinks he\u2019s gotten him off, he just comes back. He\u2019s moaning and crying a little as he tries to grind against him.\nFinally, Derek gives up on getting him off and just picks him up. Stiles wraps his legs around Derek\u2019s waist and doesn\u2019t even seem to notice that they\u2019re on the move until Derek dumps him in the bathtub and turns the cold water on him. He lets out a yelp and flails to get out, but then seems to realize where he is. He tugs all his clothes off in a rush and just lets the cold water soak him. Some lucidity seems to return to him. \u201cDistract me,\u201d he mumbles, curling up in the cold water.\n\u201cOkay, uh, name all the major houses in Game of Thrones and their mottos,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t watch Game of Thrones,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAre you kidding, with what they do to those poor characters?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t watch it either,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHonestly you could have just made some stuff up and I wouldn\u2019t have known.\u201d\nStiles blinks at him, then starts to snicker. Hearing him laughing is so gratifying that Derek\u2019s heart swells with it. \u201cHelp me up,\u201d Stiles says, fumbling at the edge of the tub. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing.\u201d\nThe rest of the night and next day are much the same way. Stiles will scream or cry, his body curled so tightly that it looks like something might snap, until fatigue overwhelms him. Then he\u2019ll be quiet for a little while. Occasionally he\u2019ll climb onto Derek or start jerking off. Two more times, Derek has to give him a cold shower.\nDerek keeps the TV on in the background and tries to get Stiles to focus on other things. They talk about stupid movies and Derek makes him recite as much trivia as he can come up with. Finally, around two o\u2019clock in the morning, Stiles gives a little shudder and his body relaxes. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Derek blinks himself awake. \u201cJust like that? You can tell?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s like . . . all my muscles just suddenly turn to jelly.\u201d Stiles gives an enormous yawn, and his eyelids are already sagging.\n\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cNo, s\u2019late,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019 drive. You stay here. Can sleep on the . . . sofa or the . . .\u201d His head tilts back as he passes out. Derek stifles a yawn of his own and puts a blanket over him before he totters over the sofa and falls onto it.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nDerek wakes up to the sound of a cabinet closing. He\u2019s half sitting up when Stiles comes into the room, wearing a loose T-shirt and flannel pants. \u201cMorning,\u201d Derek mumbles.\n\u201cOh, hey. Did I wake you? Sorry.\u201d Stiles sits down at the other end of the sofa, by Derek\u2019s feet. He looks \u2013 well, he looks bad, but not as bad as he often does when he comes back after a heat cycle. \u201cI got up thinking I would make you a thank-you breakfast but then I remembered that I can barely move, so instead I called Erica and bribed her into bringing us IHOP. I hope you like pancakes.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I love pancakes,\u201d Derek says, laughing, as he thinks of different late nights on the job and all the times they\u2019ve gone out for a diner breakfast. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cLike I went ten rounds with a weed whacker,\u201d Stiles says, relaxing against the cushions. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as bad as it usually is.\u201d\nDerek thinks back on the previous thirty-six hours in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s what you call \u2018not that bad\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Stiles shakes his head a little. \u201cRemember those times when I\u2019d be coiled tighter than a spring, screaming into a pillow? It\u2019s usually like that the whole time. If I\u2019m not wanking, which is usually followed by crying.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Derek mumbles.\nStiles is quiet for a minute. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that you can\u2019t completely understand how much this meant to me, but . . . thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m just glad it helped.\u201d Derek hauls himself off the sofa. \u201cMind if I use your shower?\u201d\n\u201cFeel free, man. But if you\u2019re not out by the time the food gets here, I\u2019m eating your share of the bacon.\u201d\nDerek flips him off and heads into the bathroom. He\u2019s as quick as he can be, mostly because he\u2019s really starving and wants to be able to set to the food as soon as it arrives. When he gets out, Stiles hasn\u2019t moved from the sofa, and Derek laughs a little. \u201cSo you said your dad used to stay with you?\u201d he adds, and asks curiously, \u201cWhy did he stop?\u201d\nStiles rubs a hand over the back of his head, looking embarrassed. \u201cI, uh, I told him I\u2019d gotten over myself and found a partner.\u201d\n\u201cJesus. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he just . . .\u201d Stiles lets out a breath. \u201cWatching me was really hard for him. You know, nobody likes watching their kid in pain. Plus it was getting kind of embarrassing for me, as I got older, what with the wanking and the crying and all. But I knew he would never just abandon me in my time of need, so . . . lying to him was easier.\u201d\n\u201cEasier, I can see,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBut better?\u201d\nStiles is quiet for a long moment. \u201cMaybe. It\u2019s better if he thinks that I\u2019m okay now. He sort of blames himself for the way I am, because . . .\u201d\nStiles trails off. Derek is about to prompt him when there\u2019s a knock on the door and Erica bounces in, laden down with bags. As glad as he is to see the food, Derek sort of wants to throttle her. But she\u2019s cheerful and friendly and wants to know how things went, so they eat while giving her a brief overview.\nOnce they\u2019ve eaten, Stiles says he wants to get some more sleep, that he\u2019ll probably spend most of the day in bed, so Derek should go home. Derek agrees and leans in to give him a hug. Stiles holds on for several long moments before letting go.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nA week goes by. They don\u2019t talk about it. They do their job, they hang out once or twice for a drink with some of the other cops, they eat at their favorite deli. They wind up on a late-night stakeout, watching the back entrance of a bar where the suspect in a murder often goes to get his drugs.\n\u201cI was raped when I was sixteen,\u201d Stiles says, completely out of nowhere.\nDerek nearly chokes on the coffee he\u2019s drinking. But he\u2019s not really surprised. He\u2019s suspected for a while that something like this is at the root of Stiles\u2019 problems. He glances at him but doesn\u2019t say anything. He doesn\u2019t want to tell Stiles that he doesn\u2019t need to talk about it. Stiles knows that. He\u2019s telling Derek this because he wants to.\n\u201cI was, uh, a junior in high school.\u201d Stiles picks up his own Styrofoam cup of coffee. \u201cOur school was a little unusual because we had more alphas than omegas. Usually the other way around, you know. So the omegas got their pick of the field. We played it up a little. You know. We liked to make the alphas sweat it out. It was our right, you know? That\u2019s what we thought.\n\u201cThere was this one alpha in the grade above me, Douglas.\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice trembles slightly, but then steadies. \u201cHe kind of had a thing for me. Used to tell everyone that he was gonna be my first. I was just starting, you know, to have those little hot flashes, you know? The ones that last a couple hours, in the months before you get your first real heat. First heat, always sweet. That\u2019s what everybody says about it, right?\u201d\nStiles clears his throat, looks over at Derek quickly, and then away. \u201cSo there I am. Being a shithead, not picking an alpha even though I knew it was less than a month before I was going to go into heat for the first time. I liked the attention. There were three different alphas who all thought I might pick them, and they\u2019d bring me food and buy me shit and . . .\u201d\nStiles is quiet for so long that Derek feels compelled to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s really unusual.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I guess not.\u201d Stiles gives a little shrug, his hands twisting in his lap. \u201cDoug cranked it up to eleven, though. He started following me around at school. Threatening the other alphas if they talked to me. I told him to back off, told him whoever I picked, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to be an asshole like him. He, uh, he followed me home. My dad wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\nThis time, Derek doesn\u2019t interrupt his quiet.\n\u201cWhen I think back on it, I don\u2019t remember the pain as much as I remember the fear,\u201d Stiles finally says. \u201cI mean, yeah, it was truly spectacular amounts of pain, but . . . I honestly thought he was going to kill me. He didn\u2019t, though. He . . .\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice cracks again. He reaches for his coffee with hands that \u00a0shake. \u201cHe told me that he was my alpha now. That no other alpha would want me because I\u2019d gotten taken before my first heat. That it was him or nothing. I\u2019d heard stories, you know, about what happened to omegas who went without a partner . . . about how the heat got worse and worse until it finally drove them crazy.\u201d\nAfter another long moment of silence, Stiles continues, \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t even the worst part. The worst part was that he said I wouldn\u2019t mind once I went into heat. That none of this would matter. I could hate him all I wanted, but once I was in heat, I would beg him to fuck me, that I would love being fucked by him.\u201d Stiles practically chokes on the words, and Derek just lets his eyes fall shut. He can\u2019t even imagine the pain Douglas\u2019 words had caused.\n\u201cEventually he got up and left. He told me to call him when I was going into heat so he could \u2018take care of me\u2019. I was so fucked up, I just got dressed and went about my business like I was in some sort of fog. I didn\u2019t say anything to anybody. I was bleeding like crazy, but I got it to stop after a few days.\n\u201cI was getting really close to going into heat for the first time, and my dad, you know, my poor beta dad who\u2019s desperately uncomfortable talking to his sixteen year old son about selecting a partner with whom to have torrid tantric sex, kept dropping hints. I had to choose somebody. I was running out of time. He wanted to meet them first.\n\u201cSo I brought Douglas home to meet him,\u201d Stiles continues, and clears his throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to do. I just kept thinking about how I knew I couldn\u2019t do it alone, but none of the other alphas in school, none of the other alphas ever, would want me. I felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice. I told myself it couldn\u2019t be that bad, you know, rationalized his rape of me six ways from Sunday. I\u2019d been leading him on. His alpha side drove him to stake a claim. I made it anything but \u2018this sick fuck assaulted me\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t deal with that.\u201d\nDerek opens his mouth, then shuts it. He wants to hear, needs to hear, that Stiles hadn\u2019t spent his first heat, or any heat, with Douglas. But he can\u2019t say that because he\u2019s still not sure how this story is going to end.\n\u201cI managed to do that all the way up to the day before I went into heat, which is when I finally flipped my shit completely.\u201d\n\u201cYou told your dad?\u201d Derek says, breathing a sigh of relief.\nStiles looks at him in some surprise. \u201cWhat? No. I went out to the garage with my belt and tried to hang myself.\u201d\n\u201cJesus Christ, Stiles,\u201d Derek says.\nA sad little smile touches Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cFortunately for me, the pipe that I was sure could hold my weight didn\u2019t. It broke, and I fell and there was a huge crash and my dad came out to see what was going on. That\u2019s when I told him everything. I said some things that day that I\u2019m really not proud of. I begged him to kill me. To just put his gun to my head. I told him I\u2019d rather die than let Douglas touch me again, or any alpha, but that I\u2019d rather die than go through it alone, too.\n\u201cMy poor dad brought me to the hospital. They brought in a shrink and even a heat specialist, and they decided to put me in a medically induced coma until my first heat was over. They were one hundred percent sure \u2013 and one hundred percent right \u2013 that having to go through it right then would break me beyond repair.\u201d Stiles takes another drink of his coffee. \u201cFirst heat, always sweet. Whenever I hear that, I think of the look on my dad\u2019s face right before I went under. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever completely forgiven himself for not, you know, not seeing what had happened. Not protecting me.\u201d\nHe goes quiet again. Derek searches for the right question. \u201cWhat happened to Douglas?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek makes a strangled little noise. \u201cNothing, then. It was my word against his. He denied that it was nonconsensual, and since I waited to go to the hospital, there was no evidence. I couldn\u2019t even be in the same room as him, let alone get up on a witness stand and talk about what he did to me. So nothing happened, then. He went off to college and assaulted three more omegas before he screwed up and picked one with an alpha boyfriend. That alpha beat his head in so bad that they had to identify his body from his fingerprints.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Derek mutters again.\n\u201cFor a long time, I was convinced that it was my fault. That if I\u2019d been able to say something against him, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten a chance to hurt those other omegas. I got over that about the same time that I got into the police academy and learned that the world doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a small blessing,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBut you never . . .\u201d\nStiles shakes his head. \u201cI could never bring myself to look for a heat partner. I spent almost that entire first year heavily sedated while I was in heat, because otherwise the panic attacks wouldn\u2019t stop. I got heavy-duty therapy and a bunch of different drugs to try. By the time I was eighteen, I could get through it by myself. But I never looked for anyone to go through it with me. Just \u2013 the thought \u2013 \u201d His voice breaks. \u201cAny time I thought about it, I just thought about what Douglas said, about how I would love being fucked by him.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true, right?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles looks at him again, and then away. \u201cI mean, yes, you would feel physical desire for him, but you would still know who he was. You would still have the same emotional reaction to him that you would at any other time of the month.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. Trust me, people have explained it to me. I probably know more about the heat cycle and the different hormones and everything than anybody else in this town. It just doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t get his voice out of my head.\u201d\nDerek takes a deep breath. \u201cHave you ever \u2013 had sex while you weren\u2019t in heat?\u201d\n\u201cA couple times. But with women.\u201d Stiles gives a little shrug. \u201cAdvantages of being bisexual. Every time I try to be with a guy, we round second base and I just lose it. Panic attacks, hysterics, it\u2019s very not pretty.\u201d\n\u201cYou need someone you can take it slow with,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles says, looking over at him.\n\u201cYeah. You know, someone who would be patient with you. Someone willing to take the time it \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be partners anymore,\u201d Stiles says abruptly.\nDerek internally panics. He had overstepped, obviously, Stiles had put so much trust in him, telling him that story, and now he \u2013\n\u201cBecause I really want to ask you out,\u201d Stiles continues, and Derek starts breathing again, \u201cbut dating in the workplace is a big no-no. I, uh, I\u2019ve been thinking about taking the sergeant\u2019s exam. I might get transferred if I pass. Then we could, you know. Date.\u201d\n\u201cI would love to date you,\u201d Derek says, then winces at how lame that sounds.\nBut Stiles doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s lame. He turns to Derek with a smile. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Absolutely. Sign me up.\u201d\n\u201cI want to . . .\u201d Stiles takes a breath and lets it out. \u201cDouglas stole ten years of my life from me. I can\u2019t get them back, I know that. But I don\u2019t want to let him take any more.\u201d\nOn impulse, Derek reaches out and takes Stiles\u2019 hand, presses a kiss into his knuckles. \u201cWell, you\u2019re definitely going to ace the sergeant\u2019s exam,\u201d he says, \u201cand then I\u2019m going to take you out on the world\u2019s cheesiest date. We\u2019re going to find a carnival to go to, and I\u2019m going to win a stuffed bear playing ring toss and give it to you, and bribe someone to stop the Ferris Wheel with us at the top so we can have our first kiss there.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had our first kiss, I think,\u201d Stiles says, but he\u2019s grinning.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay. How big a stuffed bear?\u201d\n\u201cEnormous. Bigger than you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to \u2013 oh, there\u2019s our guy! Let\u2019s roll!\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nBy mutual agreement, they don\u2019t talk about it for a while. Stiles takes the sergeant\u2019s exam, and as expected, passes. He gets transferred to the precinct in Red Bluff, about half an hour away. Derek gets a new partner at work, a woman named Braeden who\u2019s tough and smart and professional. They get along well, although he still finds himself missing Stiles a lot on the job. But that\u2019s all right, because now that Stiles\u2019 transfer is official, they can date.\nThey go on the first date about a week before Stiles is due to go into heat again. They have to drive almost two hours to get to an amusement park, but it\u2019s totally worth it. Derek wins Stiles a stuffed bear (slightly less impressive in the reality than in the plan) and they go on every ride, some of them twice. The ride operator is barely a teenager and messes up stopping the Ferris Wheel, so their first kiss is slightly off center, quiet and sweet.\nDerek stays with him when he goes into heat again. He brings two seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to keep him distracted and is unsurprised when Stiles can practically recite along with the dialogue. He\u2019s a little better prepared this time. He\u2019s starting to recognize when Stiles is losing control, so he can get him in the cold shower before he does anything he\u2019d find embarrassing. He coaxes Stiles into eating; when Stiles says he\u2019s too hot, Derek freezes watermelon and strawberries and feeds him those.\nStiles\u2019 heat ends at about seven AM, while they\u2019re sacked out on the sofa after a sleepless night. He crawls into Derek\u2019s lap and falls asleep with his head on Derek\u2019s chest. Derek sleeps, too.\nThey go to movies and baseball games, they go boating on Shasta Lake with Erica and her husband Boyd, they go hiking and fishing. They have Netflix marathons. Stiles teaches Derek how to make pierogies; Derek teaches Stiles tai chi. And when Stiles\u2019 heat comes on, they spend it together. It\u2019s still horrible for Stiles \u2013 Derek cringes during the approaching days, knowing it\u2019s coming. He still spends hours screaming or wracked with sobs. But he swears that it\u2019s not as bad as it had been spending it alone.\nWhen Derek\u2019s heat approaches, he\u2019s unsure how to handle it. Stiles tells him that he should spend it with Danny again, but that seems like infidelity to Derek. They\u2019re dating, they\u2019ve been dating for months; they\u2019re very solidly a couple. Even though they haven\u2019t done anything other than some enthusiastic kissing and a little light groping, having sex with someone else seems wrong to him.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t force yourself to go through it alone,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDon\u2019t do that for me. Okay? If it was just going to be this one time, then maybe . . . but I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before I\u2019m ready. Maybe in six months I\u2019ll be up for it, maybe I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHowever long it takes.\u201d\nStiles presses a kiss against the corner of Derek\u2019s mouth. \u201cI know. You are amazing. I don\u2019t want you to suffer because of how amazing you are. Go spend your heat with Danny. It\u2019s fine. I . . . I have something I want to do out of town, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Derek asks, pulling back.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m gonna go down to San Diego and spend the weekend with my dad. I need to . . . own up about a few lies I\u2019ve told him.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Derek squeezes Stiles\u2019 hand. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Then he\u2019s going to come back here with me, because I really want him to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d That statement makes Derek understandably nervous, but he figures that\u2019s normal. Meeting the parents of a serious boyfriend is always nerve-wracking, despite what other issues are at play. \u201cI\u2019ll make my famous fajitas.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nDerek was a little worried that Tom would make a big deal out of his son having finally found somebody, but he doesn\u2019t. He seems to realize that this would only embarrass all of them. He does ask Derek a lot of questions, about his family, his time in LA, how he likes Beacon Hills. But it\u2019s just the standard \u2018get to know your son\u2019s boyfriend\u2019 kind of questions. They go to the baseball game and grill some steaks and have a good time.\nHe leaves on Monday after hugging his son for a good five minutes, and says he\u2019s going to come back up in a couple weeks. Derek misses their last dinner together because he gets called in to work a case, but both Stiles and his father are police officers heart and soul, so neither of them make a big deal out of it. They\u2019ll visit again soon.\nBy the time he gets home that night, it\u2019s late, nearly midnight, and his stomach is growling. \u201cHey, your dad make his flight okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThere\u2019s some leftover Chinese if you want it.\u201d\n\u201cAwesome.\u201d Derek stops before going to the refrigerator to kiss Stiles, which is vastly more important than dinner. He gets distracted from the idea of food instantly, and somehow they wind up on the sofa, making out.\nThis isn\u2019t exactly new, and Derek is always careful not to let it get too far, but this time Stiles is being demanding, grinding his hips against Derek\u2019s and twining his hands in Derek\u2019s hair. He looks beautiful, head tossed back and eyes closed, just letting himself feel good. Derek holds onto his hips, lets his hands slide over Stiles\u2019 back and ass and is gratified when that just makes Stiles grind against him harder. Derek leans in and sucks a bruise into the side of Stiles\u2019 neck, and Stiles whimpers.\n\u201cDo you \u2013 want me to stop?\u201d Derek makes himself ask.\n\u201cJesus, no,\u201d Stiles says, leaning his forehead into the crook of Derek\u2019s shoulder and rocking forward frantically. He shudders a moment later, fingers digging into Derek\u2019s biceps hard enough to bruise. Then he relaxes with a faint moan. \u201cWell. That was.\u201d He lets out a slow breath. \u201cThat was anti-climactic.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I think it was the exact opposite,\u201d Derek says, stroking Stiles\u2019 hair.\nStiles snickers. \u201cOkay, yeah. I can\u2019t deny that. But I always just pictured my first time coming with a guy being really deep and complex somehow. Not just, you know. Coming in my pants like a teenager.\u201d\n\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cOh, hell yes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI kind of want to do it again, like, immediately.\u201d\n\u201cThen everything worked out,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cExcept this,\u201d Stiles says, rocking forward slightly against where Derek\u2019s erection is still rock hard in his pants. Derek groans a little despite his best efforts. \u201cWe should take care of that.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t have to,\u201d Derek pants, trying not to grab at Stiles\u2019 ass again.\n\u201cI know, but I actually, really want to,\u201d Stiles says, undoing Derek\u2019s belt and then unbuttoning his pants. \u201cLike, I\u2019m surprised by how much I want to,\u201d he adds, as he draws Derek\u2019s cock out of his pants. \u201cOne hundred ten percent on board over here.\u201d\n\u201cHnnngk,\u201d Derek pants out, letting his head rest against the back of the sofa.\n\u201cActually, make that one hundred fifty,\u201d Stiles says, stroking him gently, rubbing his thumb over the head and gaining another groan from Derek. He leans in to press a kiss against the side of Derek\u2019s neck, which turns into a long, drawn out process. Derek gives in to his impulse to grab Stiles\u2019 ass as his orgasm hits him. \u201cGood?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Derek relaxes, drawing Stiles in for another kiss. \u201cReally good.\u201d\nThey kiss a few more times, and Derek thinks he actually dozes off for a few minutes, but eventually he makes his way off the sofa to have dinner.\nThings are going well in other arenas, too. Rarely a night goes by that Stiles isn\u2019t at Derek\u2019s place or vice versa. Derek is working up to asking Stiles if he wants to get a place together, maybe splitting the distance between Beacon Hills and Red Bluff, when Stiles surprises him with a list of apartments that he thinks would work. They move in the next month, and get a second cat, and throw a housewarming party that has a surprising number of people at it.\nThe sex is great. It\u2019s not penetrative sex \u2013 Derek knows it\u2019s going to take time to work up to that. But it\u2019s a lot of handjobs and blowjobs and enthusiasm, and they\u2019re both having a great time.\nTo be honest, if Stiles wasn\u2019t an omega, Derek would have been content to leave it at that. There was no need to push him. They\u2019re both having orgasms, they\u2019re both enjoying themselves plenty. Plus there\u2019s the intriguingly hot option of Stiles being on top, something that Derek finds himself daydreaming about a lot.\nBut Stiles is an omega, which means that when he\u2019s in heat, nothing but an alpha inside him is going to be enough. That means that they have to work up to it, if they ever want to be able to end the agony that he\u2019s going through.\nWhen Derek tentatively brings that up, he half expects that Stiles will shoot him down. Even after all they\u2019ve been through together, he doesn\u2019t know that Stiles will ever want to have sex while he\u2019s in heat. But when he mentions it, Stiles gives a thoughtful nod. \u201cProbably best to start small. I\u2019ve heard that adding a finger really spices up a blowjob.\u201d\nDerek laughs despite himself. \u201cBeen reading Cosmo again?\u201d\n\u201cI have much better sources than Cosmo, trust me,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word on it.\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this? It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I do,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, not that the blowjobs aren\u2019t awesome. But I want, you know, everything. Which sounds greedy when I put it like that. But I still do.\u201d\n\u201cEven during your heat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles gives a little smile. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t imagine any scenario in which I wouldn\u2019t be willing to have sex with you, so, the whole pre-granting consent thing makes more sense to me now. Well, maybe if I had norovirus. That would probably be a bad idea. Or if we had an audience of grade school children. Or if \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cI get the idea,\u201d Derek says, laughing despite himself. He leans in to nuzzle at the crook of Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. You asking me if I\u2019m sure makes me sure. I mean, we\u2019ll have to work our way up to it, but I\u2019m sure I want to do that.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 source \u2013 who turns out to be Danny \u2013 is one hundred percent correct. Stiles enjoys being fingered so much that for a while it\u2019s all he wants. That\u2019s just fine by Derek, who loves the noises Stiles makes when Derek\u2019s fingers are inside him. They try it the other way, too, and he completely understands why Stiles loves it so much. It feels amazing. That gives him the courage to ask Stiles if he wants to try being on top.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles asks, blinking at him.\nDerek gives a little shrug. \u201cAlphas can enjoy being fucked, I think. We should give it a try. Maybe \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll help you to see me enjoy it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, shit, don\u2019t have to ask me twice,\u201d Stiles says, and jumps him.\nIt\u2019s a little awkward \u2013 they\u2019re both new at it, and so neither of them have a firm grasp on what they\u2019re doing \u2013 but they get into it, and after Stiles finds a good rhythm everything fades into the background. Derek tilts his head back and twines his fingers through Stiles\u2019 and just loves it, more than he would have ever thought he would. He comes so hard that the world goes blank and white around the edges.\n\u201cThat. That was.\u201d Stiles can\u2019t even catch his breath afterwards, sprawled out on the bed next to Derek. \u201cWow. Gotta do that again. Soon. A lot.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d is all Derek can muster in agreement.\nTwo weeks later, Derek tops for the first time. Stiles is clearly nervous and trying to hide it, but Derek has a plan that works beautifully. He barely pushes an inch into Stiles, just enough so that he can feel Derek there, and then jerks him off until he\u2019s moaning and comes in Derek\u2019s hands. \u201cHow was that?\u201d Derek asks, pressing kisses into the side of Stiles\u2019 neck.\n\u201cDon\u2019 think it counts,\u201d Stiles mumbles.\n\u201cSure it does. There\u2019s no rule saying I have to go all the way in.\u201d\n\u201cGuess not.\u201d Stiles yawns and falls asleep.\nThey get there gradually. The first time Stiles comes with Derek all the way inside him, he cries a little afterwards. \u201cAre you okay, did I hurt you?\u201d Derek asks, trying not to panic.\n\u201cNo, I just \u2013 I\u2019m just really happy,\u201d Stiles says, snuffling a little. \u201cThanks, Derek. Really. Thank you.\u201d\nDerek kisses him for what feels like hours.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nWhen Stiles is about to go into heat again, Derek finds himself growing more and more uneasy. Now that they\u2019re actually having sex, the scent of him is driving Derek insane. He catches himself trying to make a move on Stiles more than once, and keeps stopping himself. Stiles is busy with the dishes, working on a case, brushing the cat. Derek could initiate something, but he\u2019s more worried about how much he wants to.\nAs the hours creep by, he finds that he\u2019s nearly climbing the walls. Stiles is going to go into heat and he\u2019s not going to be able to control himself. He doesn\u2019t want to believe that about himself, but it\u2019s growing more clear by the minute.\nFinally, he blurts out, \u201cI have to go. I can\u2019t \u2013 be around you right now.\u201d\nStiles turns from where he\u2019s been making himself a sandwich and gives him a look that\u2019s a little bit hurt, but mostly just surprised and confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cYour scent. I can\u2019t.\u201d Derek takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose control. I hate \u2013 admitting that \u2013 but it\u2019s so much \u2013 now that we\u2019re having sex \u2013 you don\u2019t want to during your heat yet and I, I respect that, but I can\u2019t stay with you this time, I can\u2019t \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d Stiles moves a step towards him, and Derek retreats. He\u2019s trying to figure out how to convince him, waiting for Stiles to say he would never do that. He wants to believe that, but he knows it isn\u2019t true. But then Stiles surprises him. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call Erica \u2013 if she can\u2019t stay with me, I\u2019ll call Danny. He\u2019s always been a little weird about the heat thing but he\u2019ll get it now \u2013 knowing the way things are between us. Can you get yourself a hotel room or something?\u201d\nDerek nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d His breath escapes him in a rush. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that. Just \u2013 call me when it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles hesitates, then says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, you know.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this when I get back,\u201d Derek says, and stumbles out of the apartment. By the time he gets to a nearby hotel and has a room for himself, he feels like a complete ass. He knows that he did the right thing, removing himself from the situation, but he should have been able to control himself. It shouldn\u2019t have been an issue.\nHis phone chimes and he sees he has a text from Stiles. Somewhat warily, he opens it. It reads, \u2018Erica\u2019s coming over. I\u2019ll be fine, so don\u2019t worry about me.\u2019\nDerek sighs a little and slumps onto the bed. \u2018Okay.\u2019\n\u2018Let me guess. You\u2019re convinced that you should be able to handle this.\u2019\nDerek glares at the phone. \u2018Maybe.\u2019\n\u2018You know that doesn\u2019t make sense, right?\u2019\nNow Derek is really annoyed. \u2018Of course it makes sense. I should be in control of myself.\u2019\n\u2018You *are*. You removed yourself from the situation. That\u2019s control. Anyway, you\u2019re being ridiculous. You\u2019re the only alpha I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s been able to stay with me during a heat. The only one I would have trusted.\u2019\n\u2018I guess,\u2019 Derek texts back, and sighs.\n\u2018Erica\u2019s here, gotta go. I love you.\u2019\n\u2018Love you too,\u2019 Derek says, and turns on the television to distract himself. It\u2019s going to be a long night.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nTwo days later, Derek comes home with flowers and chocolate covered espresso beans. Stiles laughs and cuddles right up to him. He\u2019s tired, and although he doesn\u2019t look great, he\u2019s looked worse. He says that his heat went about as well as he could have expected it to.\n\u201cI tried to do research, you know, to occupy myself,\u201d he says, sprawling across Derek\u2019s lap. \u201cAbout alphas not having sex with omegas during their heat. But it turns out that nobody\u2019s really studied it. So, you know, you can stop assuming that other alphas would have been able to control themselves. Before you, nobody even tried.\u201d\nDerek scowls at him. \u201cFine. I guess.\u201d\nStiles laughs and traces his fingers over Derek\u2019s lips. \u201cNext time,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s so casual that it takes Derek a minute to figure out what he means. \u201cYou mean, next time . . .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHonestly, if I\u2019d had a little time to think about it, I probably would have been ready this time. Because you, leaving like that because you were afraid you would lose control . . . that means a lot to me. You know that, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, feeling okay for the first time in days. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\n\u201cSo. Next time.\u201d Stiles yawns. \u201cAlso, tonight. But first I need a nap.\u201d\nDerek laughs. \u201cMe too.\u201d\nOver breakfast the next morning, Stiles tells him about an idea he had, brought on by something Erica had said while he was in heat this time. \u201cI thought, it might make it easier if we got naked beforehand, you know, because we always know when I\u2019m getting close. If we\u2019re already on second base when I go into heat, I\u2019ll already be feeling really revved up, and the sudden \u2013 intensity \u2013 probably won\u2019t bother me anywhere near as much.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Derek says thoughtfully. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s got to be kind of jarring when one minute you\u2019re just casually eating cereal and the next \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re starving for dick,\u201d Stiles agrees with a nod, and Derek laughs. \u201cSound good?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nA few weeks slide by, no different from any other weeks. As Stiles\u2019 heat draws near, Derek is trying not to hover, hoping his anxiety doesn\u2019t show. He\u2019s afraid that Stiles might change his mind \u2013 but he\u2019s more afraid that Stiles will want to, but won\u2019t. He\u2019s not sure how to ask Stiles that he\u2019s sure without instilling doubts that Stiles doesn\u2019t actually have.\nHis anxiety does show, apparently, because Stiles starts reassuring him that he\u2019s fine. \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of, you know, excited,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been excited about going into heat before, so this is super new for me. But I\u2019m literally getting pep talks from Danny like, on the hour. He texts me constantly telling me about how amazing and awesome it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\nDerek laughs. \u201cDid you ask him to do that?\u201d\n\u201cI might have. You know. Just as a precaution.\u201d\nDerek gives a little snort despite himself. \u201cSounds like an excellent plan. Especially if it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\u201cHe also said to tell you that, although he\u2019s glad that the two of us are gonna get busy, that he\u2019s really gonna miss your dick. His words, not mine.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um.\u201d Derek flushes pink a little. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, I guess?\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if we\u2019ll ever go into heat at the same time,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully. \u201cDo we sync up after a while? Like periods?\u201d\n\u201cYes and no.\u201d Derek pokes him in the ribs. \u201cI thought you had done a bunch of research on the heat cycle.\u201d\n\u201cOmega heat yes. Alpha heat no. And it didn\u2019t come up, so I was gonna say \u2018I guess not\u2019, but you\u2019re going to say that it does?\u201d\nDerek nods. \u201cBecause the alpha heat comes on more gradually, and happens less often. You\u2019ll still have the same schedule as usual, but after the first year or so, yours will trigger mine. I\u2019ve never experienced it, though,\u201d he adds. \u201cGoing through a heat with a partner who was also in heat. So I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\u201cProbably very . . . sweaty,\u201d Stiles says, and both of them burst out laughing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s appealing, thanks,\u201d Derek finally manages.\n\u201cI do have a unique point of view.\u201d\nThe next few days pass more quickly than Derek would have expected, and he\u2019s so keenly aware of Stiles\u2019 scent that he has trouble focusing on anything else. Stiles is getting a little antsy himself, but they manage to make dinner. \u201cGonna start late,\u201d he says, as they\u2019re doing the dishes. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind being up all night. In more ways than one.\u201d\nDerek groans. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst. Come here and kiss me.\u201d\nStiles does. The dishes are abandoned in short order, and they adjourn to the bedroom. Derek estimates that they still have about half an hour, so he takes his time stripping Stiles out of his clothes, keeps their kisses slow and languorous and doesn\u2019t rush anything. He leaves Stiles\u2019 boxer shorts on and pulls the other man into his lap, running his hands up and down Stiles\u2019 back. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmurs into Stiles\u2019 skin, kissing the line of his moles.\n\u201cWhat are you even talking about, you\u2019re the one with the gorgeous rainbow eyes,\u201d Stiles manages, twining his hands in Derek\u2019s hair and just letting Derek take care of him. Before long, he\u2019s groaning quietly and trying to rock his hips against Derek\u2019s. Derek won\u2019t let him, though, keeping some space between them. \u201cCome on . . .\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Derek says, nipping at Stiles\u2019 ear and provoking a sharp intake of breath. But he does decide to get them onto the bed, spilling Stiles down onto it and sliding his underwear off. Stiles watches him intently as Derek divests himself of the last of his own clothes, then gets down onto the bed with him. He arches up for a kiss, and Derek obliges, still leaving a few inches of space between their bodies.\n\u201cListen, you jerk,\u201d Stiles pants. \u201cI\u2019m ready, okay?\u201d\nDerek shakes his head a little and leans in for another kiss. \u201cNot until you\u2019re all the way into heat. I\u2019ll know. Believe me, I\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want to now,\u201d Stiles says, fake-whining in a way that makes Derek laugh.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to be starving for dick,\u201d Derek reminded him, but he takes pity on him, leaning closer and letting their bodies press together. Stiles moans and puts his arms around Derek to pull him closer, twining a hand in his hair. \u201cEasy, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Derek murmurs into his ear, letting Stiles rock against him. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles gasps out, as Derek slides a hand between his legs, gently pushing them apart. \u201cOh, God. Derek.\u201d\nDerek hesitates, not sure if that\u2019s a good \u2018oh God\u2019 or a bad one. \u201cDo you want me to keep going?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please, if you stop I\u2019ll kill you \u2013 \u201d\nDerek huffs out a little laugh and goes back to teasing Stiles, running his hands up and down Stiles\u2019 thighs and over his hips. Stiles whines again, and Derek leans in to distract him with a kiss as he reaches for the lube. Technically, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, but he wants this to be good for Stiles, wants to be extra careful. He groans a little despite himself as he presses a finger into Stiles. He\u2019s hot to the touch, and he feels so ready. Derek goes in for another kiss, and Stiles bites at his lips frantically.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Stiles pants. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nHis scent changes, and it\u2019s so subtle but so affecting, and his pupils are blown wide and his fingers are twisting in Derek\u2019s hair, and Derek slides into him slow and easy, like breathing. Stiles\u2019 back arches and he throws his head back and he gives a quiet little whimper. \u201cEasy, Stiles, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Derek murmurs into his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll get you there, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\nHe thrusts once, twice, and Stiles\u2019 body goes taut. His hands twist painfully in Derek\u2019s hair and his mouth drops open a little like he\u2019s going to make a noise, but he doesn\u2019t. He comes so hard that it looks like it hurts to Derek, who smoothes down his hair as Stiles collapses back to the bed. Stiles is flushed and panting, but his hands loosen in Derek\u2019s hair.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Derek asks, brushing a few strands of hair out of Stiles\u2019 face.\nStiles blinks at him, slowly. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019 think I\u2019m done yet,\u201d Stiles says, his voice rather fuzzy. He squirms slightly, feeling Derek still inside him, and moans. \u201cYeah, I want \u2013 want to \u2013 \u201d\nDerek isn\u2019t sure what he wants, but then Stiles flip them over suddenly so he\u2019s on top, grinding down on Derek\u2019s cock and letting out another moan. Derek can\u2019t hold back one of his own. His hands gravitate to Stiles\u2019 hips, holding him steady. Stiles doesn\u2019t seem to notice, completely focused on riding Derek\u2019s cock. In fact, when Derek tries to shift slightly, he puts his hands on Derek\u2019s chest and pins him in place, intent on taking what he wants, what he needs. Derek lets him, watches him, forgetting entirely about his own pleasure, which is no match for the exquisite sight of Stiles finally letting himself have his.\nHe thinks that Stiles barely even remember he\u2019s there, he\u2019s so focused, but when Stiles comes, it\u2019s with Derek\u2019s name on his lips.\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Derek says again, as Stiles half-collapses on top of him. He runs his hands down Stiles\u2019 body, feeling the way he\u2019s still trembling. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\u201cMmkay,\u201d Stiles manages, his body relaxing by slow degrees.\nDerek gives him a minute, before asking again, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cSo good,\u201d Stiles murmurs. \u201cSo good, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Derek kisses him again, soft and gentle, staying as still as he can so Stiles can bask in the feeling.\nAfter about five minutes, Stiles shifts again. \u201cYou didn\u2019 come.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek says, and it is. He\u2019s going a little soft now, and although an orgasm would certainly be nice, he\u2019s not going to ask for anything. \u201cThere will be time for that later.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles frowns a little. \u201cI feel surprisingly . . . lucid. Like . . . I\u2019m still in heat, right? Shouldn\u2019t I still be, you know, feeling like it?\u201d\n\u201cGive yourself a little time and you\u2019ll rev back up.\u201d Derek rubs a hand up and down Stiles\u2019 spine. \u201cThis is how it usually goes. You get one or two good orgasms under your belt, then you\u2019ll feel clear for a couple hours, before it starts to build again. You\u2019re not supposed to feel it the whole time.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Okay.\u201d Stiles tries to stretch, but mostly just yawns instead. \u201cThink I\u2019m gonna fall asleep.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty typical reaction, too,\u201d Derek says, amused despite himself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cMmkay.\u201d Stiles tucks his head against Derek\u2019s shoulder and is asleep moments later.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nDerek dozes too, and wakes up a couple hours later when Stiles starts grinding against his hip. He rolls them over and kisses Stiles until they\u2019re both breathless before sliding into him again. He makes love to Stiles deep and slow and beautiful, until Stiles is a trembling, gasping mess; he takes him all the way apart and then puts him back together and it\u2019s the most amazing thing that\u2019s ever happened to either of them.\nWhen they finally come back after that, he coaxes Stiles out of bed and makes him drink some water. He knows that Stiles will be so focused on sex that he won\u2019t remember to do things like that, and a good alpha has to take care of their omega in more ways than just fucking. They sleep for a few more hours, and then he gets Stiles into the shower. They make out for a while and finally end up having sex on the bathroom floor because they can\u2019t manage to get back to the bedroom. Then they have breakfast. Stiles isn\u2019t really that hungry, but Derek feeds him a little at a time, rewarding him with kisses between bites.\nStiles is actually okay after that, for a little while, so they settle down with a movie that they miss the second half of.\nAll Stiles wants to do after that is cuddle, and he does so rather aggressively, wrapping his arms around Derek and refusing to let him get out of bed. Derek doesn\u2019t mind; there\u2019s really nothing he would rather do. They cuddle until late in the evening, when he finally manages to get Stiles to let go of him long enough to get them both some dinner. They take another shower \u2013 this one sex free \u2013 and manage to sleep for an entire six hours before Stiles is ready to go again. Derek\u2019s getting more tired than he wants to admit, so he rolls them over so Stiles can ride him again, which Stiles does with exuberant determination.\nIt\u2019s over by the next afternoon. Stiles eats an entire pizza and then sleeps for twelve hours without twitching.\nWhen the alarm goes off the next morning, Derek leans over and kisses Stiles on the temple. \u201cHey. How are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles murmurs. \u201cI think I can actually go to work.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek kisses him again and then gets out of bed. He ducks into the shower and gets dressed, before coming into the bedroom to find Stiles still in bed. He laughs a little, because he\u2019s used to Stiles\u2019 propensity to jump out of bed with five minutes to spare, down two cups of coffee and take off. \u201cYou want me to start the coffee maker?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Stiles yawns, stretches, and then swings his legs over the edge of the bed. He tries to stand up and immediately staggers. Derek catches him and helps him sit back down. \u201cOoooh. Okay. Maybe not so much with the work today.\u201d\nDerek laughs quietly. \u201cIt was quite a workout.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem okay,\u201d Stiles says, grumbling a little.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s because you were doing most of the work at least half the time,\u201d Derek says. He kisses him and says, \u201cNobody will be upset if you take a day to recover. Take a hot bath and take it easy.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles yawns again before flopping back down onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d\nWhen Derek gets to work half an hour later, he sees Erica smirking at him. He gives her a look, and she says, \u201cStiles sent me a text this morning that was a solid screenful of emojis. Wanna see it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, do I?\u201d Derek asks.\nErica doesn\u2019t answer his question before shoving her phone in his face so he can see the text. It\u2019s several rows of hearts, faces with heart eyes, and hands lifted in praise to the Heavens. Derek studies it for a few moments and tries to keep the idiotic grin off his face. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s working. \u201cI think he had a good time,\u201d Erica says, sounding smug. \u201cNow get to work,\u201d she adds, smacking Derek\u2019s ass and heading back to her desk.\n\u201cThat\u2019s harassment,\u201d he shouts after her.\n\u201cSomeone has to keep your ego in check!\u201d she calls back.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0\nHe ends up working late, which really annoys him, because he wants to get home to Stiles. But there\u2019s a messy car accident, followed by a drug bust, followed by a teenager who stole his step-father\u2019s car and is driving it like an idiot. The teenager in question turns out to have run away because his step-father is abusive, and Derek winds up sitting in the hospital with him for over an hour, calming him down and getting details.\nHe texts Stiles twice to apologize for how late he\u2019s going to be working, and Stiles says not to worry about it both times. When he finally gets home, it\u2019s after eight o\u2019clock, and he\u2019s starving. He comes into the house to hear soft jazz playing, and heads into the kitchen to find wine glasses, candles, and the amazing aroma of the steaks Stiles is making.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d he asks, laughing. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t need to pay me back for the last few days, right?\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Stiles says, glancing over his shoulder from where he\u2019s at the stove. \u201cIt\u2019s not payback, or a reward. It is something else.\u201d He turns the heat off the stove and says, \u201cThose just need to sit five minutes and then they\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, feeling a little flutter in his stomach when he sees the smile on Stiles\u2019 face.\nStiles puts his arms around Derek\u2019s waist and leans in for a kiss, soft and gentle, his thumb rubbing over Derek\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cI was thinking earlier today about how different things are now from how they were two years ago,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI really, honestly, thought I would never be happy. That I would just . . . claw through each day, suffer through it, until I died on the job or of old age or whatever happened. I did it for my dad, but I never thought it would get better. You might not have saved my life, but you made it worth living.\u201d\nDerek flushes pink. \u201cI just did what \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cWhat anyone would do? No, babe, you really didn\u2019t. You are the first person I ever met who treated me like my decisions were my own to make. Who respected them even if you didn\u2019t understand them. Even Erica \u2013 she\u2019s great, you know, she\u2019s my best friend, but even she spent the first year trying to, to solve me like a puzzle. She would say \u2018have you tried this and have you tried that\u2019 and finally she got to the point where she couldn\u2019t come up with any other ways to fix the problem. You didn\u2019t do that. You just accepted it. And I know that it was hard for you to do that, that you wanted to just fix me, but you never acted that way. You let me work through it on my own, gave me what I needed and just \u2013 just let me take things at my own speed.\n\u201cAnd, you know, I liked you from the first day I met you, and I knew I was interested in you by the time we\u2019d been on the job a week, but . . . I fell in love with you that day in the locker room. When you took me home and you didn\u2019t try to give me anything I couldn\u2019t accept. And I\u2019ve fallen in love with you a little bit more every day since then. For a really long time, I thought I was in this alone. You made me see that I wasn\u2019t. That even if you didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t know how to help, you were still there. I didn\u2019t have to do this by myself. I\u2019m not alone, and I never want to be alone again. So . . .\u201d Stiles takes a deep breath and goes to one knee, pulling a box out of his back pocket. \u201cWill you, Derek Alexander Hale, be \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek blurts out, and Stiles starts laughing. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll let you finish.\u201d\n\u201cMarry me?\u201d Stiles says, with a charming grin, and Derek says yes again and then Stiles jumps back to his feet and wraps his arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders, his legs around Derek\u2019s waist, kissing him over and over again.\nThey keep kissing for a solid minute before Derek\u2019s stomach lets out a loud growl, and they both wind up laughing so hard that they can barely breathe.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cLet\u2019s eat, and then we can watch the new Star Wars trailer fifteen times.\u201d\n\u201cNerd,\u201d Derek says, and falls in love with him all over again.\n\u00a0\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\u00a0"
