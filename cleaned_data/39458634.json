    "text": "It\u2019s a slow as shit Tuesday afternoon, and Steve is at work thinking about Eddie \u201cthe Freak\u201d Munson.\nSteve\u2019s life is such a fucking joke. Of course he\u2019s thinking about Eddie Munson. Of course he is.\u00a0\nEddie Munson, who is two years older than Steve and still finishing up high school. Eddie fucking Munson, with his long dark hair and his big grin and his long fingers. His big personality. Big enough to fill up an empty room.\nSteve bets, with Eddie inside, no house would ever feel empty.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s got big doe eyes. They\u2019re brown with lashes long enough to cast shadows on his cheeks. They\u2019re real pretty. Steve has, on multiple occasions, wondered what they look like when they\u2019re all glossy and wet. Fucked out.\u00a0\nSteve misses sex, sort of. It\u2019s hard to explain. Steve has sex every other week or so; sometimes with a girl he\u2019s slept with before, sometimes with someone new. He\u2019s not in a dry spell, or anything. No, Steve just misses  good sex.\u00a0\nSex that makes his heart race, his toes curl. Makes his blood rush. His head spin.\u00a0\nIt would probably be like that with Eddie. It would be  good with Eddie, Steve knows it. Eddie wouldn\u2019t even have to like him in order to fuck him. Fucking is, actually, probably Steve\u2019s most realistic option; Eddie and him are barely more than friendly acquaintances, and fuck knows Steve doesn\u2019t have the best track record with anything else.\n Fuck, fuck, fuck, Steve thinks sourly, because he\u2019s said the word so many times in his mind that it\u2019s starting to sound funny.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, why won\u2019t Eddie  fuck me, Robin?\u201d Steve bursts, smacking his palm against the counter.\u00a0\nHis words ring across the empty movie store and are absorbed by the soft VHS covers.\nRobin flicks over to a new page in her magazine. \u201cBecause he\u2019s dumb, Steve. Dumber than you are.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d Steve moans. He drops his head down, buries it in his arms. Then he lifts it and drops it again. Then a third time.  Thud, thud, thud,  his brain rattling around in his empty fuckin\u2019 skull, because what is wrong with him?  What is he doing wrong? \nRobin finally sets her magazine aside and leans her arms against Steve\u2019s shoulders. She hunches over him comfortingly, the both of them stacked together behind the family video register. Steve huffs at her and Robin blows in his ear, making him twitch.\n\u201cEddie just, like, refuses to notice you flirting with him. It\u2019s not you, babe, you\u2019ve been doing great. Flirting up a fucking storm,\u201d Robin says kindly.\n\u201cI blew a popsicle in front of him, Robs,\u201d Steve says, because  that  had been humiliating. He\u2019d really given it his all, too. Put his lips and tongue against the blue, icy tip and then hollowed out his cheeks. It had been a show. He had looked  good. Steve knows he did.\nEddie hadn\u2019t reacted at all. He had just turned around and rummaged through the trunk of his car for a minute, then turned back like nothing had happened.\nIn Steve\u2019s more delusional moments, he comforts himself with the fact\u2014 hope\u2014 that Eddie had been blushing. Probably.\u00a0\nThe stupidest thing Steve has  ever  done is blowing that popsicle. And he\u2019s done a lot of dumb fucking shit.\n\u201cI know, babe,\u201d Robin tells him, because that\u2019s their new thing. Her and Steve\u2019s new thing; calling each other  babe. \nIt cracks them up. Nobody else gets it.\nThat just makes it funnier.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just scared,\u201d Robin continues. \u201cHe\u2019s a self-confessed coward, Steve-o. Of course he\u2019s not gonna make a move on you. Not on King Steve.\u201d\nSteve breathes in very deep, his lungs heaving. Robin heaves with him, still laying on his shoulders, then deflates when he breathes out.\u00a0\nHe takes another deep breath and lets out a muffled yell into the crook of his arm.\u00a0\nIt makes him feel a little better.\n\u201cI bet real kings get, like, way more head than I do,\u201d Steve says. \u201cOr at least more money.  And  they get a dead dad, too\u2014  fuck, real kings have it so much better than me.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to work at Family Video, either,\u201d Robin says. Her voice is very glum.\nIt\u2019s real nice of Robin, to be melancholy and sullen right alongside Steve. It cements their best-friend status further, adds another tick into the  Steve \u2018n\u2019 Robin: Together Forever column.\n\u201cRight?\u201d Steve agrees.\nThey lay in their defeated heap behind the register together. They watch dust drift through the window light.\u00a0\nWhen a pimple-faced kid stumbles through the door, neither of them move. They chorus: \u201cWelcome to Scoops\u2014 wait, shit\u2014 welcome to Family Video.\u201d\nThey never fucking get their welcoming spiel right.\u00a0\nThe kid takes one look at them, stacked together behind the register, and turns bright red. He spins on his heel and leaves immediately.\u00a0\n\u201cThank God,\u201d Robin says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve\u2019s main problem is that Eddie is sweet.  Majorly sweet; sweeter than coke or skittles or peach cobbler pie. Just genuinely fucking soft hearted.\nDeep down at the core of himself, Steve is a little mean. He\u2019s come to terms with it, mostly because Robin and Nancy are the same way. The three of them are a little too ready to bear their teeth at people who might not completely deserve it.\nEddie\u2019s not like that. Eddie is more like Jonathan, though every time Steve has that thought he crumples it up like paper and tosses it into the furthest corner of his head. It makes his skin itch.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s true. Eddie is sweet. It\u2019s just a fact. His hair is permed and he likes Black Sabbath and he\u2019s got thirteen tattoos and he\u2019s  sweet.\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s been a long time since someone was sweet to Steve. And Eddie is. Sweet to Steve, that is. He gives Steve these shy smiles, hiding his face behind his hair. He talks a mile a minute and calls Steve  Ozzy  whenever they meet up. He touches Steve\u2019s shoulder, his wrist, Eddie\u2019s fingers warm and flitting away quickly. Eddie waves frantically and jogs over to talk whenever they see each other in public. He\u2019s fucking  excited to see Steve.\n\u201cWe saved the world together, Ozzy-O,\u201d Eddie says.\n\u201cRock on,\u201d Steve says back, and then has to throw his arm around Eddie\u2019s shoulders and noogie him, because it\u2019s that or kiss him.\nEddie\u2019s so sweet it makes Steve want to be sweet right back\u2014 to put his mouth to Eddie\u2019s collarbone and kiss him there. To tuck his hair behind his silver-studded ears. To drag his lips across Eddie\u2019s cheekbone, his nose, over his forehead. Straighten out his shirt. Smooth out his bracelets.\nThey\u2019re not best friends or anything, but they\u2019re solid. Him and Eddie are new and fresh and  good in a way that Steve can\u2019t help but pick at. There\u2019s so much potential, Steve feels like a newly potted plant. Like there are new places he could stretch out and grow into. New things to become.\nIt\u2019s been a long fucking time since Steve felt like he was  becoming something.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a nice feeling.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Thursday. Eddie Munson is in Mike Wheeler\u2019s basement, hidden behind his dorky fucking folder, arms splayed wide and weaving a web of a story.\u00a0\nSteve is also in Mike Wheeler\u2019s  armpit of a basement\u2014 shit, Steve has to take Max out to a park or something, get her to throw a ball around with him, they\u2019re both gonna get, like, jaundice doing this\u2014 and watching him. When Eddie grins, Steve\u2019s heart thumps. When he cracks his knuckles before rolling his dice, Steve bites down a smile. Eddie fiddles with his hair. Steve licks his lips.\nIt\u2019s pathetic. Steve is pathetic and he needs to stop.\u00a0\nBut then, for a moment, Eddie lifts his eyes off his notes. He doesn\u2019t look at Mike or Dustin or Lucas or Will, fresh from California. He doesn\u2019t look at El and Max, huddled in the corner and sharing headphones. Eddie doesn\u2019t look at any of them. Eddie looks at Steve, and Steve looks back. He thinks his eyes must be, like, fucking smoldering or something.\nEddie winks at him, flirty and dramatic and  not at all serious. And then he looks away.\nIt\u2019s fucking  bleak, is what it is.\n\u201cOh, ouch,\u201d Robin says, dropping onto the couch next to him. She hands him a coke.\u00a0\nSteve groans and buries his face into her bony shoulder, pressing the cold can to his hot cheeks. Everything he does is embarrassing.\u00a0\u00a0\nRobin pets his hair. \u201cI know, babe.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m killing myself,\u201d he tells her. \u201cLike, soon.\u201d\nDustin whips his head up from his nerd notebook. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d\nSteve ignores him. Robin does too.\n\u201cIf I were you? I would,\u201d Robin tells him. She\u2019s dead serious.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cRight?\u201d Steve asks, because  fuck this is so fuckin\u2019 sad.\u00a0\u00a0\n \u201cNot right, you guys, what the fuck!\u201d Dustin cries.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve, are you good?\u201d Will asks. Steve peeks one eye open and discovers him frowning, concerned. Next to him, Mike Wheeler is staring like he\u2019s not sure whether to be upset or anxious or what. Lucas is nibbling nervously on his lips.\nThe girls keep ignoring them.\u00a0\nSteve loves them most.\u00a0\n\u201cAren\u2019t you playing your nerd game?\u201d He asks, lifting his head from Robin\u2019s shoulder with a scowl. \u201cFocus on that. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m going to kill myself, but I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cHey, man, come on,\u201d Eddie says. His eyebrows are furrowed together over his gigantic fucking Bambi eyes. Steve wants to, like, lick them. He wants to see them shiny and wet.\nSteve\u2019s brain is so fucking  weird.\u00a0 \n\u201cHel-lo  we are having a fucking  conversation  here!\u201d Robin exclaims. She scowls at them, fiercely, and Steve squeezes her tightly in thanks. Robin is  so  the best. Steve, overwhelmed with warmth, kisses her temple.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just concerned!\u201d Dustin sputters.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d never let him do that,\u201d Robin says reassuringly. \u201cNot alone, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cAw, babe,\u201d Steve says, putting a hand over his heart.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a two for one deal, Harrington, and you know it.\u201d Robin rolls her eyes and crosses her arms over her chest. She\u2019s wearing her black jacket with the patches, and new green plaid pants. There\u2019s a silver chain hooked on them.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s so fucking cool. Steve loves her so much.\u00a0\nRobin huddles into Steve\u2019s side and Steve wraps his arms around her joyfully.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s, like,  not reassuring, Robin!\u201d Dustin cries.\u00a0\nLucas, Will, and Mike gaze at them, bug eyed, and Steve pinches his nose.\nAt the head of the table, Eddie chews on his lip nervously. After a moment, he clutches at his hair, pulling it across his face and twirling it between his fingers. Steve wants to touch Eddie\u2019s hands. Wants to pull them down and then stroke Eddie\u2019s hair back. Wants to soothe all that nervous energy.\u00a0\nSteve thinks that Eddie would probably let him. Probably. He\u2019s  almost  certain. But almost certain just isn\u2019t fucking good enough. If Eddie would give him just  one  sign, literally  any sign at all\u2014\u00a0 \nHe doesn\u2019t even have to blow any popsicles. Steve\u2019s done all the heavy lifting. Eddie\u2019s just got to fucking do fucking  anything\u2014 \n\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d Nancy asks, stepping delicately into the basement. Jonathan follows at her heels, his hands at her waist and a sort of big-eyed, stunned look on his face.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s mouth twitches, despite his frustrated thoughts, because looking at them makes him want to smile. If Eddie makes Steve feel like a blossoming young thing, then Jon and Nance make him feel rooted. Planted deep into the ground.\u00a0\nJonathan and Nancy being in the basement with them reassures Steve. Just a little.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve\u2019s talking about killing himself,\u201d Mike immediately snitches.\nIn unison, Steve and Robin groan.\n\u201cIt was a joke, Wheeler,\u201d Steve says. \u201cTake a joke. Also, Robin said she was going to, too.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin huffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a joint suicide pact, Steve, why would I lie about that?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, woah, what?\u201d Jonathan sputters.\u00a0\n\u201cBack up,\u201d Nancy agrees.\n\u201cWe love you, Steve, don\u2019t kill yourself,\u201d Dustin says. He\u2019s standing at the table fidgeting like he might come over and throw himself on top of Steve.\u00a0\n\u201cDo not come over here,\u201d Steve warns him.\nDustin comes over anyway.\nHe rounds the table and leaps onto Steve and Robin both, the solid weight of him slamming into Steve\u2019s chest and then settling with a  fwump  onto his legs. Dustin sprawls out on top of them like a too-large cat, and Steve raises his eyes to the ceiling and counts to ten.\u00a0\nAnd then he breathes in deep and pats Dustin\u2019s head.\n\u201cOkay, first of all, I\u2019m not going to kill myself. If I was going to do that I would\u2019ve already done it. And I\u2019m still here, so.\u201d This reassures precisely no one, so Steve keeps talking. \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t want to die. I promise. If I did, Robin would know.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d Robin promises. She gives them all a thumbs up and a crooked grin.\u00a0\nRobin is the realest friend Steve has ever had. Because sure, fine, there have been nights where she\u2019s had to come over and pull a bottle out of his hand. Draw the blinds for the windows that look out at the pool. But Steve\u2019s done the same for her; pulled her inside out of the rain, shaking and crying, because she  thinks her mom knows, Steve, oh God, oh God, what am I going to do? \nRobin is the realest friend Steve\u2019s ever had, and when push comes to shove, like it\u2019s shoving now, Steve knows she\u2019s going to take his secrets to the fuckin\u2019 grave. He\u2019s gonna do the same for her.\u00a0\n\u201cHel-lo,  are we  playing  or  not,\u201d  Eddie interrupts. He waves his hands back and forth, like,  look at me! I\u2019m right here!  \u201cLeave Harrington alone. Mike, you\u2019re in the chamber, four enemies around you. Will and Dustin are off to the side, and Lucas is in front with\u2014\u201d\nBarreling on without any further input from the players, Eddie picks up where he left off. Steve tips his chin at him, a silent thanks, and Eddie gazes at him with his big brown eyes.\u00a0\nAfter a moment, Steve needs to look away, because he wants to go over there. He wants to toss his arm around Eddie\u2019s shoulders and sit on the arm of his chair. Heckle him while he speaks. Brush kisses down his chin.\u00a0\nJon and Nance come and sit with their backs to the couch. Nancy tosses her legs over Jonathan\u2019s thighs, and Jonathan\u2019s long fingers stroke across them. Robin tucks herself further under Steve\u2019s arm. Eddie stays over at the geek table, effortlessly commanding and entertaining Steve\u2019s feral pack of nerds, and Steve watches him.\u00a0\nEddie catches him doing it, of course. He meets Steve\u2019s eye and grins like\u2014 like sunshine. So bright and stunning.\u00a0\nAnd then Eddie looks away. Focuses on the kids. His eyes never stick on Steve like Steve\u2019s do on Eddie.\u00a0\n Yeah, Steve thinks. Pretty fucking bleak.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I need,\u201d Steve declares, one foot on a movie rack like a historic general, \u201cIs a plan.\u201d\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d Robin agrees, mostly ignoring him. She\u2019s focused on painting her nails dark blue; her tongue is poking between her teeth.\n\u201cIf I could just figure out what he likes, then I\u2019d be in. I\u2019ve just gotta\u2026 I just need to know what  works for him, you know?\u201d\nRobin looks up from her nails. As soon as she does, she paints the brush across the counter and mutters  shit. She wipes at it with her thumb, but it just smears.\nSteve waits patiently.\n\u201cOkay, pause,\u201d Robin says, giving up on wiping the stain away. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna, like\u2026 Okay. You cannot change yourself for Eddie fucking Munson. You\u2019re better than that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Robin, of course not,\u201d Steve dismisses, although in all honesty he wouldn\u2019t put it past himself. But whatever. \u201cI just mean, like\u2026 dressing up a little. You know? If I could just figure out what gets him hot\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou blew a popsicle in front of him, Steve,\u201d Robin reminds him.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s cheeks heat. He flaps his hands at her then puts them on his hips. He opens and shuts his mouth four times in a row.\n\u201cAnd if that didn\u2019t do it, then I don\u2019t think anything can,\u201d Robin says. Her tone is so firm Steve almost expects her to follow it with  the prosecution rests.\u00a0 \n\u201cSome guys don\u2019t like blowies,\u201d Steve says, sullen and embarrassed. He\u2019s talking out of his ass and Robin knows it.\n\u201cYou think  Eddie the freak doesn\u2019t like blowjobs.\u201d Robin\u2019s tone is so incredulous that Steve\u2019s cheeks burn hotter.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I bet he fucking  loves  them!\u201d Steve presses his lips together and gives a muffled, frustrated yell then tosses his hands up. \u201cFine. Fine! I\u2019ll give up. I\u2019m pathetic and I  gave oral to a popsicle  to try to seduce him and I\u2019ll just  fucking throw myself off a cliff.\u201d \n\u201cOkay, just for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say Eddie isn\u2019t gay,\u201d Robin declares.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Steve says.\nA long pause comes. Robin taps her fingers against the blue stain on the counter. Steve chews on his lower lip.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to be gay,\u201d Robin finally says.\u00a0\n\u201cRight?\u201d Steve says again.\n\u201cSo then  why isn\u2019t this working?\u201d  Robin massages her temples like she\u2019s got a migraine. There\u2019s nothing Robin hates more than a puzzle that won\u2019t fucking solve. A mystery without any solid clues. \u201cIt\u2019s got to just be that he\u2019s stupid. Like, that\u2019s got to be it. Stupid  and a scaredy-cat. So even if he was picking up what you\u2019re putting down, he would ignore it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, woah,\u201d Steve says. \u201cA little mean.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin slaps her hand against the counter. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make  sense!\u201d\u00a0 \nSteve heaves a deep sigh. He sits down on the ugly, brightly patterned carpet and stares up at Robin.\n\u201cIt might,\u201d he starts, \u201cpossibly, potentially, be time to come to terms with the fact that he just doesn\u2019t want to fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Robin dismisses. \u201cThere\u2019s another answer.\u201d\nDrumming his fingers against the bottom of his shoe, Steve frowns. Thinks hard and long about Eddie and what might gag him. Thinks about his showboating, his cool-as-shit clothes, the way he took the nerds under his wing. Thinks about Eddie, repeating senior year three times. Eddie, flushing red and looking away from Steve. Looking away every time.\nHesitantly, Steve says, \u201cCould he be\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Embarrassed?\u201d\n\u201cEmbarrassed about what?\u201d Robin says.\nSteve shrugs. \u201cWanting things is humiliating. If you want something, someone can take it away from you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s vulnerable,\u201d Robin muses. She\u2019s quiet for a beat, tapping the heels of her converse against the floor. \u201cEspecially if you want something embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Steve says. \u201cLiking me is not embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cNot that,\u201d Robin says. \u201cYou\u2019re a catch.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, like\u2026 you know. The things Eddie likes.\u201d Robin flushes and looks away.\nSteve stares at her. \"No, I don't know. What fucking things?\"\nRobin stares back, wide eyed, like she\u2019s trying to communicate telepathically.\nNormally they kind of can. Talk telepathically, that is. But right now Steve isn\u2019t picking up what she\u2019s trying to put down.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it,\u201d Robin says. Her cheeks are a hot red, her eyes darting around.\nSteve whistles, long and low. \u201cDamn, Buckley. I\u2019m out of the rumor mill, mostly. I\u2019m not keeping up. Did something go around about Eddie?\u201d Because it must have really been something, the way her face is. All red and wide-eyed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s, uh. Not a rumor.\u201d Robin tugs at her shirt collar and presses the heels of her hands into her eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\n\u201cThe  hanky,\u201d Robin blurts in a scandalized whisper. She looks around the empty store, at the motionless shelves of tapes, like she thinks a customer might be hiding.\n\u201cThe hanky,\u201d Steve repeats, lost. He wracks his brains and comes up empty. But, wait. Hold on. \u201cThat\u2019s like the gay bandana system, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fucking hanky code, Steve,\u201d Robin responds. She puts her head down, like she can\u2019t stare at him and have this conversation at the same time.\n\u201cSo, Eddie\u2019s gay. There\u2019s our proof. Right?\u201d\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Robin says. \u201cThat\u2019s only if he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nSteve thinks about Eddie, twenty years old. Playing at bars and selling hard drugs out of his trailer. Grinning at Steve like that, knocking his chest against Steve\u2019s shoulder, touching Steve\u2019s bare wrist.\n\u201cNo, he definitely knows,\u201d Steve declares.\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Robin says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, ninety percent sure. Eighty-five. Sixty at the lowest.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Steve says dismissively, because Robin is avoiding something. Steve wants her to get to the fucking point. \u201cOkay. So if we assume Eddie knows about the code and is doing his hanky-thing on purpose\u2026 What does his mean?\u201d\nRobin bites her lip. Hesitantly, she says, \u201cback left pocket means receiving.\u201d\nSteve stares at her. \u201cWhat, you think he\u2019s embarrassed he likes to bottom?\u201d Because that\u2019s, like, not a big deal. Eddie wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about that\u2014 Steve knows he wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just practical, to put that preference out there. Makes it easier for everyone involved.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t fucking done, dingus!\u201d Robin blurts. She rolls her shoulders like she\u2019s about to run a race.\u00a0\nSteve stares at her, baffled.\n\u201cThe  black hanky. You know. The colors mean things. And the black hanky is for. Uh.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for\u2026?\u201d Steve prompts.\u00a0\nRobin presses her lips together. Winces.\n\u201cOkay, it cannot  possibly be that bad,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s for S&amp;M!\u201d Robin finally exclaims. \u201cHe\u2019s a masochist!\u201d\nSteve stares at her. Robin stares back.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve known this the  whole fucking time?\u201d Steve exclaims right back, throwing his arms up. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have fucking told me? Am I not a good wingman to you, is that it? Is that it? Is this payback for whatever fucking\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Robin interrupts. \u201cHold on, is this\u2014 are you, like. Do you know what masochism is?\u201d\n\u201cI know I act like it sometimes, Robin, but I\u2019m not actually fucking twelve,\u201d Steve says. \u201cIt means Eddie wants to get smacked around or whatever.\u201d\nRobin keeps staring at him.\n\u201cAnd this is all  beside the point  because what Eddie likes during sex is none of my business unless I can get him to  sleep with me!\u201d Steve finishes passionately.\u00a0\nAfter another pause, Robin nods her head like  respect, dude. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it keeps surprising me that you\u2019ve got hidden depths.\u201d\nSteve shrugs at her. \u201cI like sex,\u201d he says with a wave of his hands. \u201cWe, like, all know this. I especially like  good sex. And if that\u2019s what will make it good for Eddie\u2026\u201d Steve trails off.\u00a0\nIt comes to him like a vision, a daydream so vivid it\u2019s like he lives it: Eddie, beneath him, his skin a hot red. His wide brown eyes glossy. His cheeks glowing pink. Grinning and saying, fuck, Harrington, is that all you got? I can take it. Give me more, give me\u2014 Steve\u2014\u00a0 \nReluctantly, Steve pulls himself out of the fantasy, tucking it away for later when he\u2019s alone in his room. He clears his throat.\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Steve says. \u201cGame plan, Robin. Come on.\u201d\nBecause knowing what that hanky means does  exactly nothing if Eddie doesn\u2019t want Steve. It does fuck all.\u00a0\nRobin nibbles her lip thoughtfully, tilting her head from side to side. She hoists herself to sit cross-legged at the register counter, and Steve finally leaves his army-general perch against the shelves. He comes to lean next to her, his shoulder against her knee.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, so. You smoke, right?\u201d Robin asks, and Steve knows she\u2019s just thinking out loud, because of course Robin knows he does. Weed, cigarettes. Steve isn\u2019t picky. He\u2019s been cutting down, because recently lung capacity and stamina have seemed  life-savingly important, but he\u2019s never completely quit.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says anyway.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, maybe pretend you don\u2019t,\u201d Robin tells him.\u00a0\nSteve taps his fingers against his folded arms thoughtfully. \u201cGo on.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTell Eddie you\u2019ve never smoked before. He would  love to pop that cherry. He would, like, need to. Getting Steve Harrington high for the first time? He wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.\u201d\u00a0\nNodding, Steve tells her, \u201cI can do that. Then what?\u201d\u00a0\nRobin is really getting into it, now. Her eyes are all lit up and she\u2019s thinking fast, talking even faster. Improv and scheming are two of Robin\u2019s favorite things. She\u2019s way better at them than Steve.\u00a0\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019re telling him this at a kickback where people are already smoking,\u201d Robin says.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Steve agrees. \u201cAm I in charge of throwing this party?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what other parties you think this is going to happen at,\u201d Robin tells him. \u201cAnd after you weasel your way over there and are your stupidly endearing self, and take a hit or two of whatever, you\u2019re going to lean on him real cute and ask him what shotgunning is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh that\u2019s good,\u201d Steve says, pleased.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Robin says. \u201cI\u2019m a genius. But after that it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can lead an Eddie horse to water but you can\u2019t make the Eddie horse thirsty, or whatever,\u201d Steve agrees.\u00a0\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Robin says, because her and Steve share a brain. They have for pretty much the entire time they\u2019ve known each other. \u201cEddie might not have realized that the other stuff was flirting. He might\u2019ve thought you were, I don\u2019t know, making fun of him. Or something. But I  guarantee you he\u2019ll understand if you flirt with him like this. He\u2019ll have seen it before. He\u2019ll take it seriously.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I need,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\nAnd it is all he needs. He knows it. He just needs Eddie to realize what Steve\u2019s asking for, what he\u2019s  propositioning,  and then he\u2019ll be\u2026 maybe not in. Maybe Eddie will say no. But he\u2019ll be  done. For better or worse, he\u2019ll be done with the pining and imagining and scheming.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like he\u2019s been standing on Eddie\u2019s doorstep, nervous as a kid on his first date, waiting for Eddie. Just waiting and waiting, scuffing his shoes back and forth. With this shotgunning plan, maybe Steve will finally try the door handle and realize it\u2019s locked and walk away instead of doing what he\u2019s been doing, which is standing on the porch and hoping Eddie realizes he\u2019s there.\u00a0\nOr maybe he'll try the door and discover it's open. Maybe he'll be welcomed inside, be told to take off his shoes, his coat.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Robin,\u201d Steve sighs, leaning a little harder on her knee. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve got a party to plan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFour days later, Steve\u2019s got everyone at his house\u2014 and by everyone, he means Nance, Jonathan, Jonathan\u2019s friend Argyle, Robin, and Eddie.\u00a0\nRobin, who had crashed at Steve\u2019s the night before, single handedly prevents Steve from tearing his hair out while he sets up. They clean and laugh and shove each other into the pool, giddy and nervous. Or maybe that\u2019s just Steve.\nA kickback in order to seduce a big-eyed curly-haired beauty; Steve\u2019s done this before. It\u2019s going to be totally fine.\nTotally.\nFuck, there is such a horrible precedent here. It\u2019s making Steve lose it, just a little.\u00a0\nThe sun is setting by the time the others start arriving. The sky is leaking orange like a cracked fanta can, the trees standing dark against the sky. It\u2019s warm out, closer to sweltering than not, and Steve wipes his face with the bottom of his shirt.\u00a0\nHim and Robin are sitting on the steps to his front porch, knees knocking. She\u2019s got a lime green band-aid on her left shin.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s the low rumble of Jonathan\u2019s shitty car, then the squealing of his brakes, and Steve tips his head back while smiling. When he hears three doors open, he calls out, \u201cCome on in, Byers and friends.\u201d\n\u201cSteve Harrington!\u201d Nancy calls joyfully, climbing out of Jonathan\u2019s car, snagging Jonathan\u2019s hand, and jogging over. Jonathan keeps pace with her and they almost tackle Steve in greeting.\n\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Steve says, his throat feeling tight.\u00a0\nNancy and Jonathan put their heads on either side of Steve\u2019s neck, their arms around him like bands. Steve throws his around them, too, until they\u2019re all holding each other up.\u00a0\nYears and years, they\u2019ve been in each others\u2019 lives. Drifting together and apart and together and apart. Steve\u2019s stopped worrying about it, stopped questioning it. He has faith, now, that the three of them will drift back together every time.\u00a0\nSqueezing them a little tighter, Steve murmurs, \u201cBe cool, but I need a favor.\u201d\u00a0\nThey freeze. Steve can feel the tension creeping up their spines and immediately he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad! Just, uh.\u201d Steve clears his throat. Presses his cheek to Jonathan\u2019s hair and then to Nancy\u2019s. \u201cListen, if anyone asks, I\u2019ve never smoked weed before. Alright?\u201d\n\u201cSteve,  what?\u201d Nancy asks, the same moment Jonathan says, \u201cSure, whatever you need.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I fucking love you, Byers,\u201d Steve says. And then: \u201cPlease, Nance.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Nancy says, giving in. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to explain later, Steve, I mean it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Course, babe,\u201d Steve tells her.\u00a0\nAll three of them squeeze each other tight for another moment. Two, three. Steve only pulls away when he hears another car pull up, another door slam.\u00a0\nFinally, they unravel from each other, and Nancy greets Robin just as enthusiastically as she greeted Steve, Jonathan hanging back but giving Robin a casual nod. Steve looks out at his driveway and sees Argyle leaning against Jonathan\u2019s car, eyes on the sunset and a dazed smile on his face.  High already, Steve thinks, and snorts.\u00a0\nArgyle is a fucking riot. Steve loves that guy\u2014 anyone who can loosen Jon up even a little is worth his weight in gold.\u00a0\nBehind him, Jon, Nance, and Robin move inside, talking about something geeky. A news story or something. Steve tunes them out because then there\u2019s Eddie.\nEddie is standing next to his car, staring at Steve and frowning. Steve\u2019s heart thumps. It\u2019s half dread\u2014 because fuck why is Eddie frowning  already\u2014 \u00a0and half excitement. Eddie is here, leather jacket on, jeans ripped across the knee, black boots tied up tight.\u00a0\nThat black hanky is still hanging out of his back left pocket.\nEddie puts it there every day. He picks it up, tucks it in, and goes out with it every day on purpose.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a lot of bravery in that.\u00a0\nSteve lifts his hand and waves his fingers at Eddie, a sort of sardonic  toodle-oo, and Eddie finally cracks a smile.\u00a0\nHe comes jogging over, giving Argyle a friendly smack on the arm as he passes. Argyle sways a little then grins, waving at Eddie then leaning back against the car, eyes once again on the sky.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve fucking Harrington,\u201d Eddie exclaims once he\u2019s close enough. His eyes are glimmering, mischievous and bright. He\u2019s got a bag on his back, black canvas with pins and drawings in white sharpie, that rattles every time he moves.\u00a0\n\u201cMunson,\u201d Steve greets, then pulls Eddie in for a hug, too. He can\u2019t help it; he\u2019s a hugger. He\u2019s just got to grab and pull and squeeze at people. It\u2019s what he does.\nEddie isn\u2019t used to it yet. That\u2019s fine. Steve is great at wearing people down until they accept his affection. He\u2019s persistent and stubborn and bad at taking hints.\nHe squeezes tighter. He knocks their temples together.\u00a0\nFinally, Eddie lifts his arms, backpack clinking slightly, and returns the hug. Softly, he places his hands on Steve\u2019s back. Steve can feel his fingers twitch against his spine, out then in, like he wants to pet Steve but isn\u2019t sure he can. Slow and steady, Steve drags one hand up Eddie\u2019s ribs, then cups the back of his neck. Gives a firm squeeze.\nAfter a moment, Steve rocks them gently from side to side. Just a little. Barely any movement at all. Not enough to scare Eddie away.\nEddie fists his hands in the back of Steve\u2019s plain tee. It pulls his collar tight, choking him a little, but Steve doesn\u2019t care. He just holds Eddie tighter. Presses Eddie\u2019s face further into his neck.\u00a0\nThe tips of their shoes are touching.\u00a0\nSteve takes one, indulgent deep breath\u2014 Eddie smells like cigarettes and weed and sweat, honestly a little rank, but also like cheap cologne and deodorant\u2014 before pulling away.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on in, dude,\u201d he says, grinning so widely his cheeks hurt. \u201cMi casa and all that shit.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie stares at him for a moment, his brow furrowed, his hair ruffled. Steve stares back and tries to look cool, or at least friendly.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says, though Steve doesn\u2019t really know what he means. Eddie continues with more energy, rocking back on his heels and grinning, a little manic looking. Full-up on frenetic energy, the way Robin gets, sometimes. \u201cShow me what a party thrown by King Steve is like.\u201d\n\u201cProbably kind of lame,\u201d Steve warns. \u201cThere\u2019s only six of us.\u201d\n\u201cYou leave it to me, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says, clapping Steve on the arm. His hand lingers, long-fingered and warm, and Steve\u2019s heart leaps. \u201cI can get any party hoppin\u2019.\u201d\nEddie takes his hand off Steve and hefts the bag on his back up a little higher. It clinks and rattles, and Steve shakes his head. Wonders what Eddie has in there. Wonders how much trouble they\u2019d all be in if they got caught.\nWhatever. It\u2019s not like it would be the first time there was coke or weed or Jim Beam in Steve\u2019s house, at one of Steve\u2019s parties.\u00a0\nSteve shoves at Eddie\u2019s back and Eddie cackles.\n\u201cWho even says \u2018hopping,\u2019 man,\u201d Steve says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJonathan has followed Argyle into the fuckin\u2019 stratosphere, high as all get-out, Nancy shaking her head at them both because weed makes her feel sick. She\u2019s been pounding back her vodka soda, though, so Steve doesn\u2019t feel too bad for her. They\u2019re both sitting with their backs to the couch.\nSteve\u2019s in the only recliner, leaned back and faking like he\u2019s relaxed. He\u2019s not sure it\u2019s working.\nRobin and Eddie are sitting on the floor and passing a blunt back and forth over Argyle\u2019s prone body; the guy is snoring fit to shake the house down, passed out with a bag of chips on his chest.\u00a0\nSteve wants to be high so fucking bad but of course he isn\u2019t yet. He\u2019s faking weed virginity, so mostly he\u2019s reclining on his makeshift throne, downing vodka lemonades with his arms and legs spread invitingly, and trying to look  interested  and not  desperate.\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s been a couple hours, two or three, and everyone is settled into the house. In Steve\u2019s experience\u2014 of which he has a lot\u2014 this is the time that makes or breaks a party. When everyone\u2019s high, or drunk, and a little bit bored. In the headspace where they\u2019re willing to look at a bad idea with rose-colored glasses. Willing to look at a bad idea and think,  that looks fun. Besides, who\u2019s gonna know? \u00a0\nThe trick is, of course, throwing out a bad idea. If nothing happens everyone will leave, drunk or high enough to get horny and tired.\u00a0\nSteve is the king of bad ideas. Of tossing one out then hitting it out of the park.\nHe starts with: \u201cFuck, it\u2019s hot in here.\u201d\u00a0\nRobin, who Steve genuinely believes is connected to him telepathically, says: \u201cYou know what sounds, like\u2026 Really good?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve says.\n\u201cGrass. Being on\u2026 the grass.\u201d Robin\u2019s eyes are bloodshot. She\u2019s staring at the ceiling like she\u2019s counting the popcorn bumps.\n\u201cGrass,\u201d Jonathan sighs.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a pool, right, Harrington?\u201d Eddie says. He\u2019s hardly high at all; apparently, he\u2019s got an insanely high tolerance to everything.\u00a0\n Fuck, this might work, Steve thinks, shocked. He takes a deep breath, meets Nancy\u2019s eyes\u2014 more sober than he\u2019d thought\u2014 and raises his eyebrows.\nIf Nancy doesn\u2019t want to get in the pool, Steve won\u2019t let anyone get in the pool. Easy as that. End of story.\u00a0\n What do you think, Nance? He asks silently.\nShe stares back at him for a moment, her brow furrowed, the turn of her mouth sad. But then Jonathan touches her knee, and she covers his hand with hers, and she nods. Fuck it.\u00a0 \nA bad idea, rose colored glasses. Hook, line, sinker, Steve has this in the  bag. \u00a0\nHe\u2019s going to buy Nancy a brand new gun, holy shit.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Munson,\u201d Steve grins. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pool.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell let\u2019s go then!\u201d Eddie says, staggering to his feet.\u00a0\nSteve kicks the footrest of the recliner down just in time for Eddie to stumble over to him and hold out a hand. Steve takes it without hesitating and pulls himself up with too much force, an excuse to bump into Eddie.\u00a0\n Game time, Harrington,  he thinks to himself.  Keep it moving.\nHe fakes like he\u2019s off-balance, letting Eddie hold him up while everyone else gets moving. They\u2019re all grinning, eyes lidded low, cheeks red. Hair frizzy with alcohol and weed. Jonathan gently kicks Argyle\u2019s side and Argyle wakes up with a jerk and a good-natured  woah, man! \nNancy and Jonathan troop out into the backyard hand in hand, Robin and Argyle following. They slide into an easy conversation, something about conspiracy theories, and Steve shakes his head at them.\nEddie is still, like, holding him up. Even though he\u2019s got to know that Steve doesn\u2019t need it, not really.\u00a0\nSteve tugs at the bottom of Eddie\u2019s shirt. \u201cWe swimming or what?\u201d\nEddie\u2019s eyes are low, and dark, and he sways close to Steve. Just for a moment. Their noses almost brush and Eddie looks intent. Focused. His eyes are twinkling.\u00a0\nRefusing to move away, Steve meets Eddie\u2019s eye. Keeps himself planted.\n\u201cYeah, Harrington,\u201d Eddie finally says. \u201cLet\u2019s go swimming.\u201d\nAnd then he throws his head back and laughs, cackles really, and Steve doesn\u2019t get the joke but he smiles too. Eddie bounces on his toes, a weird little dance, and jostles Steve eagerly. He tugs Steve out of the house and into the back yard with an arm over his shoulders. Steve doesn\u2019t fight it. He just goes, easy as anything, and when Eddie Munson throws his shirt off, Steve doesn\u2019t look away.\u00a0\nEddie empties his pockets out before he jumps in; baggies of weed, of cash, of DnD cards, white pills in bottles.\u00a0\nWhen Steve sees the pills, he raises his eyebrows.\u00a0\n\u201cJust in case,\u201d Eddie shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jonathan seemed like he might want harder drugs.\u201d\n\u201cHe absolutely does not,\u201d Nancy interjects fiercely, from where she\u2019s sitting on Jonathan\u2019s lap in the slatted pool chair.\u00a0\nEddie just cackles. He shakes his head and his dark curls fall over his bare shoulders. His jeans hang low on his hips; Steve can see his underwear, the thick band of it. He wants to reach out and snap the elastic against Eddie\u2019s hips. Maybe with his teeth.\nInstead of doing that, Steve pulls off his shirt, too.\u00a0\nHe reaches out to Eddie, presses his palm flat to the slightly concave part of Eddie\u2019s chest. Eddie is a little thin in the arms, carries a little bit of weight in his hips. He looks nice. He looks healthy\u2014 Steve, abruptly, realizes he had been worried.\u00a0\nWorried that Eddie might be too thin, or sickly-pale, or pockmarked with cigarette burns. Maybe it\u2019s stereotyping, maybe Steve should feel bad about it, but he kind of thinks being worried is justifiable.\u00a0\nEddie Munson is twenty years old and sells hard drugs out of the trailer he shares with his Uncle. That\u2019s just facts.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re  worrying facts, if Steve is honest. He tries not to think about it too much.\u00a0\nBecause Eddie is sweet. He\u2019s just\u2014 he\u2019s sweet.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s hand is still on Eddie\u2019s chest.  Shit, Steve thinks, then does what he had meant to do before, which is shove Eddie into the pool.\u00a0\nEddie falls with a gigantic splash and a gleeful whoop. He bobs under then back up, sputtering and laughing, his hair hanging in his face. That beautiful large grin crinkling his cheeks.\u00a0\nLeaping in after him, Steve clears Eddie\u2019s head and lands in the water flat on his back, legs and arms all akimbo. He goes under, the water covering him, and he breathes out slow. Years on the swim team, a year as captain, and it never gets old.\u00a0\nThe cold of the water, the muffling of noise. It covers him, a tangible and full-body feeling. He loves it. He fucking loves swimming.\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t gone swimming in a long, long time.\u00a0\nAfter a moment, Steve kicks off the bottom and breaches, breathing in slow. When he opens his eyes, Eddie is right in front of him.\u00a0\nThey stare at each other for a heartbeat. Two heartbeats. Eddie\u2019s cheeks are pink, his lips are red. A bead of water slides down the edge of his nose. Eddie\u2019s eyelashes are long, and dark, and clumped together.\u00a0\nSteve kicks closer, wrapping an arm around Eddie\u2019s waist and pressing their naked chests together. Skin on skin in the pool, like this, makes everything a little bit more. Makes Eddie feel warmer than he really is, his skin a little smoother.\u00a0\n\u201cWanna play tag?\u201d Steve asks.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie asks, and his voice sounds strange. Breathless.\n One tally in the You Rule Column,  Steve thinks.  Eat that, Robin.\u00a0 \n\u201cTag,\u201d Steve says again. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll be it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to\u2026 play?\u201d Eddie says hesitantly.\n\u201cYeah, come on,\u201d Steve says, jostling Eddie a little. The water splashes. Their bare stomachs slide together. \u201cYou love games, dude. Let\u2019s play one.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t play  sports games,\u201d Eddie sputters, indignant for some reason.\u00a0\n Why the fuck not?  Steve thinks, baffled.  Aren\u2019t you like me, don\u2019t you want\u00a0this?\u00a0Don\u2019t you want an excuse to touch me all wet and shirtless? Don\u2019t you want to get away with it? \nSteve doesn\u2019t say that. Steve says, \u201cWell, Munson, then tonight\u2019s your night. I\u2019m popping that cherry.\u201d\nEddie stares at him with those big eyes, that smooth pale skin. \u201cCool.\u201d\nSo they play tag. They race around the pool, shouting and choking on water, shoving each other down, pulling each other up. Skin on skin, cheek to cheek, their legs twined together with their jeans rubbing.\u00a0\nDimly, Steve registers Robin and Argyle on their backs in the grass, still talking. Notes that Jon and Nance are still wrapped up in each other on the pool chair, playing with each others\u2019 hands and whispering. Giggling. Occasionally glancing over at Steve, making sure he\u2019s alright.\u00a0\nOnce, Steve holds Eddie under the water for a split-second in order to give them a thumbs-up. Eddie wrestles him off and dunks him under the water a moment later.\u00a0\nWhen he comes back up, Nancy is shaking her head and Jonathan\u2019s eyes are squinting happily.\u00a0\nHim and Eddie wrestle and play like puppies or kids, tumbling over each other in the water, shouting about nothing and everything. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s just\u2014 it\u2019s fucking fun.\u00a0\nThis is something him and Eddie have in common, though they go about it in different ways; they both love to  play.\u00a0\nBy the time they climb out, they\u2019re shaking and panting and still grappling with each other. Eddie is hanging on Steve\u2019s shoulders like a blanket, his hands skittering across Steve\u2019s chest, and knocking their heads together over and over again.\u00a0\nSteve tugs him over to the lidded basket where he keeps towels, spinning in Eddie\u2019s arms in order to wrap one around his shoulders. Without hesitation, Eddie does the same to him.\n\u201cKiller fuckin\u2019 party, dude,\u201d Eddie tells him, shivering like a small dog.\nSteve grins at him. \u201cIt\u2019s lame as shit, man, but thanks for lying.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, now that you say it,\u201d Eddie agrees. But then he tosses his head back and cackles, big and bold the way Eddie is sometimes.\u00a0\nThe kids, Mike and Dustin and Lucas, all insist that Eddie is larger than life.  So fucking cool, man, you should see him!  And Steve\u2019s caught glimpses. More than glimpses; Eddie in the Upside Down, bashing monsters to death. Eddie with his guitar, wailing out into the red-tinted night.\u00a0\nBut, mostly, Steve sees Eddie like he\u2019s been all night: genuine, and sweet to Steve. Hunching his shoulders in and looking up at Steve through his hair. A strange vulnerability to his jokes, like he might be crushed if Steve doesn\u2019t laugh.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s different, away from the kids. Away from the school. Eddie is different from his Freak Munson persona, the same way Steve is different from King Steve.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not that those personas are lies, exactly; Steve knows first hand that it\u2019s impossible to become a different person. King Steve is him, was him, will be him\u2014 cocky and energetic and full of life and too worried about what other people think. He is all those things. And, despite what everyone always says\u2014 Robin and Dustin and Nancy and even Eddie himself\u2014 Steve liked being King Steve. Not all the time, but mostly\u2026 yeah.\nKing Steve wasn\u2019t a lie. Eddie \u201cthe Freak\u201d Munson isn\u2019t a lie either.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not everything. Steve knows that better than anyone.\u00a0\nSteve takes a deep breath and thinks,  alright. Phase two. \n\u201cI\u2019ve got a confession, Munson,\u201d Steve murmurs, leaning in slightly closer. It\u2019s hard, because they\u2019re already pressed together so tightly there\u2019s not much empty space left between them, but Steve makes it work.\u00a0\n\u201cLay it on me,\u201d Eddie says, still grinning. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll take it to my grave, man.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve never smoked up before,\u201d Steve lies. Bold-faced and calm but feeling like his pants are on fire, the same way he did when he was fifteen and told his mom  oh, wow, I have no idea where those whiskey bottles went. I was spring cleaning earlier this week, maybe I moved them?\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve  what?\u201d Eddie sputters. His voice is loud and shocked, and Steve plays his part.\nHe waves his hands and shushes Eddie dramatically, eyes darting over to Jon and Nance, their foreheads pressed together, and Robin and Argyle, still in the grass.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a travesty, this is\u2014 this is a  crime, I can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Eddie says, already marching over to where he\u2019d tossed his plastic baggies of shit.\nSure enough, he finds one stuffed with weed, the green buds full and tempting. Tucked into the bag is a grinder and papers for rolling and Steve watches, delighted, as Eddie sets up shop right on the towel basket\u2019s lid.\nHe leans one shoulder against the back of his house, the brick scrubbing at his skin, and basks in his success.  Still got it, Harrington, he thinks smugly.\nQuicker than blinking, Eddie rolls them a fat blunt, perfectly put together and sealed. Steve is more than a little impressed.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, here, hold on,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cSo, like, okay. I\u2019ll start it and\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off by lighting it, putting it between his teeth, and taking the first drag. He breathes out, long and slow, getting more jittery by the second. \u201cSo, okay. Here.\u201d\nEddie steps closer to Steve and holds up his hand so that the blunt is near Steve\u2019s mouth.\u00a0\n\u201cBreathe in and then hold it,\u201d Eddie tells him. He starts strong but by the end of the sentence his voice is quiet. His doe eyes are wider than usual. Steve bites his lip, half to keep from smiling and half because he wants to kiss Eddie so fuckin\u2019 bad, and that\u2019s the only way he can think to stop himself from doing it. \u201cCount to five real slow and then breathe out. Do, like, the Mississippis.\u201d\nSteve leans forward, parting his lips just a little. He makes sure Eddie sees the flash of his tongue, the white of his teeth.  Please fucking let this be better than the fucking popsicle fiasco, Steve thinks, sending out a prayer to whoever the fuck wants to make it come true.\u00a0\nHe wraps his lips around the blunt. He takes a pull, counts  one Mississippi, two Mississippi, and then fakes a coughing fit at four seconds.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re good, dude,\u201d Eddie reassures him, rubbing Steve\u2019s bare shoulder. His nails scratch at Steve, just lightly. Gently.\u00a0\nSteve breaks out into goosebumps.\nSteve leans into him further, until his head is almost in the crook of Eddie\u2019s neck, still pretending to cough. \u201cFuck, man,\u201d Steve wheezes, and the hoarseness isn\u2019t fake.\n\u201cYeah, I know, the first couple tries can take it out of you,\u201d Eddie says kindly.\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Steve says, watching as Eddie takes a drag, too. His lips curl around the paper, pink and full, and the blunt\u2019s cherry burns red and hot for a moment.\u00a0\nAfter, Eddie holds it back out to Steve. \u201cTry again,\u201d he says, and his voice is a little lower. A little slower.\u00a0\nSteve looks up at him through his lashes. Meets his eyes while he wraps his lips around the blunt and takes another hit. He lets himself hold it for the full five seconds, this time, but he forces himself to cough right after.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Steve says, once he\u2019s fake-wheezed for long enough, and Eddie licks his lips at the word.\u00a0\nThey take another hit or two like that, pausing for longer and longer between drags, because Eddie doesn\u2019t want Steve to get too high too quick. It\u2019s sweet of him.\n So fucking sweet,  Steve thinks, a little blurrily. His tolerance isn\u2019t what it used to be.  Strawberry milkshake type sweet. \n\u201cIf you were a food, you\u2019d be a strawberry milkshake,\u201d Steve tells Eddie, because why not? He\u2019s supposed to be getting high for the first time. People who get high for the first time say the stupidest shit imaginable. Besides, it\u2019s true. Eddie is a strawberry milkshake and Steve wants to suck him down.\u00a0\nEddie flushes, one side of his towel falling off his bare shoulder. Steve can see his collarbones and he wants to put his teeth on them.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, I think,\u201d Eddie laughs. He leans until he\u2019s pressed shoulder to shoulder with Steve, both of them leaning against the brick of Steve\u2019s house.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re still in sight of all the others, but it feels private anyway. Secluded. It\u2019s a little magic, standing under the stars, still dripping from the pool, with Eddie Munson leaning into his space. Looking at Steve with those eyes of his.\u00a0\n\u201cGot a question for you, Munson,\u201d Steve says, his heart pounding in his chest like it\u2019s going to burst out and run away from him.\u00a0\n\u201cShoot, King Steve,\u201d Eddie tells him. His teeth flash in the dark. The blue glow of the pool lights his jaw and cheeks, turning him into something strange. Something beautiful.\n I\u2019m gonna fuck him,  Steve thinks. And then, for the first time:  I\u2019m gonna make him love me.\u00a0 \nThe thought doesn\u2019t scare him. It lights up something in his stomach instead.\n\u201cExplain shotgunning to me,\u201d Steve says, lazy and calm.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like. It\u2019s when you. Like. Okay, so it\u2019s like\u2014\u201d Eddie sputters, whole body rocking with sudden embarrassment. But then he pauses. Narrows his eyes at Steve.\u00a0\nSteve stares at him, all apple pie innocence. Just a good-ol\u2019 corn-fed Indiana boy who\u2019s never heard of shotgunning, and who  certainly doesn\u2019t know what Eddie\u2019s black hanky means, good Lord, nothing to see here, officer.\u00a0\n\u201cWell?\u201d Steve prompts, a little arrogant.  Are you calling my bluff or not, Munson? \nEddie stares for another moment, meeting Steve\u2019s eyes with a furrow in his brow. Steve doesn\u2019t look away. He gazes back serenely.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Eddie finally says.\u00a0\nSteve strangles back a grin. Kills off the triumphant burst of laughter that wants to explode out of his chest.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Eddie,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nEddie freezes with his mouth open. He licks his lips.\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d Eddie breathes, then raises the blunt. Inhales. Leans into Steve, who meets him with his lips already parted.\u00a0\nWhen Eddie breathes out, just a whisper away from Steve\u2019s mouth, Steve breathes in smoothly. Effortlessly.\u00a0\nWithout moving away from Steve, Eddie takes another drag. He holds it in his lungs and Steve can feel his chest expand. As he breathes out, Steve leans in closer, until their open mouths are pressed against each other and their teeth are almost touching. Eddie is tense, keeping his tongue pulled tight toward his throat, but Steve lets himself relax. Lets his tongue slide forward until it\u2019s pressed lightly to Eddie\u2019s bottom lip.\u00a0\nHe gives it a lick, slow and firm, dragging from one side to the other.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before,\u201d Eddie murmurs.\n\u201cYeah, no shit,\u201d Steve says, and then kisses him.\u00a0\nHe presses their open mouths together in a tight crush. It\u2019s immediately wet, because Eddie\u2019s not quite kissing him back, is mostly just standing with his lips parted wide, but Steve rolls with it. He wraps his tongue around Eddie\u2019s and gives it a stroke. He presses in closer, feels Eddie\u2019s nose dig into his cheek.\u00a0\nA muffled noise erupts from Eddie\u2019s throat, and then he\u2019s kissing Steve back.\u00a0\nEddie drops the blunt onto the ground and surges forward, throwing his arms around Steve\u2019s shoulders. Steve takes it, catches him easily. He wraps his arms around Eddie\u2019s waist in return, sliding his palm up Eddie\u2019s bare back.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s mouth is clumsy, too quick and too slow at the same time, and he pulls in and out like he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s supposed to be doing.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s fine. Steve likes it, actually. It puts a fire in his stomach, makes his legs tense, thinking about how maybe Eddie\u2019s never done this before\u2014 or, if he has, he\u2019s so nervous Steve\u2019s made him forget how to do it.\nEither option is fantastic.\u00a0\nSteve takes a sharp breath in through his nose and then focuses. Eddie seems fine with the amount of tongue they\u2019re using, so Steve keeps rocking with it\u2014 presses in and twirls their tongues together before pulling back, just barely, so that he can get their lips involved too.\u00a0\nA good kiss has a lot of lip and a little tongue.\u00a0\nSteve wants to give Eddie a good kiss.\u00a0\nSo he does: he tips his head back and slides his lips over Eddie\u2019s, sucks Eddie\u2019s bottom lip into his mouth. Smooths his tongue over it in a hot long stroke. Pulls Eddie until he\u2019s flush against Steve, pressing Steve into the wall.\u00a0\nEddie wraps one of his calves around Steve\u2019s and Steve hitches him upward until Eddie\u2019s crotch is flushed with Steve\u2019s thigh.\u00a0\nAnd then, there it is: another noise from Eddie. A moan, drawn out and a little breathy.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve whispers.  \u201cYeah, just like that.\u201d\u00a0\nSteve tilts his head and kisses him again, licks in from a new angle. Pulls his tongue back and bites down, so gently, on Eddie\u2019s lip. And then he tilts his head, chin scraping against Eddie\u2019s, sliding his tongue back in. Long and slow strokes where he never pulls away, just keeps kissing and kissing and  kissing Eddie Munson.\u00a0\nEddie, miraculously, keeps kissing him back.\nSo, like, okay. Eddie is a little bit high but definitely not high enough to be hallucinating.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s making out with Steve Harrington. Or, if Eddie is honest, Steve Harrington is making out with  him. \nSteve Harrington is hitching him up by the waist, his hands big and warm against Eddie\u2019s bare skin, and gently pulling Eddie down to his thigh. Steve Harrington is sliding their mouths together over and over again, tongue slickly smart against Eddie\u2019s own. One of Steve\u2019s hands trails up Eddie\u2019s side, over his ribs and up his spine, in order to grab him firmly by the back of the neck.\nThen Steve brings his hand to Eddie\u2019s hair and  pulls, slowly. Firmly. Eddie\u2019s knees buckle completely without his permission, and he lands a little more firmly on Steve\u2019s thigh, and he can\u2019t even be embarrassed because he\u2019s too busy moaning into Steve Harrington\u2019s mouth.\n Moaning. Him, Eddie Munson.\u00a0\nThis is stranger than the monsters. This is stranger than\u2014 than\u2014 Eddie can\u2019t even find a second thing to compare this to, because Steve is still kissing him and it still feels so fucking  good. Oh, shit, but it feels good, and Eddie tries his best to kiss Steve back just as smartly as Steve is kissing him but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s working. He thinks he might be a little bit bad at it.\u00a0\nHe just can\u2019t  focus. \u00a0\nEddie\u2019s made out with people before, kind of. A little. High or drunk off his ass at a party two towns over, trading drugs for cash in someone\u2019s back room or backyard. It was always fine. A way to pass the time.\nIt was never like  this, holy shit.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, fuck, Steve,\u201d Eddie says, and his voice comes out strange. A little too high, a little too breathless. It shocks him. It sends some weird jolt through his stomach and hips, like,  that\u2019s me?\u00a0 \nSteve just laughs and kisses him more. Eddie can feel the huff of hot air, damp and humid, in his open mouth. It makes him shiver.\nEddie shoves his tongue into Steve\u2019s mouth in response, because he wants to\u2014 like, fucking\u2014 he wants to climb  inside  Steve Harrington, or something. He wants to get as far down Steve\u2019s throat as he can, except that isn\u2019t right, that\u2019s  bad kissing etiquette, and that can\u2019t be enjoyable for Steve. He\u2019s got to make this enjoyable for Steve.\u00a0\u00a0\nPulling his tongue back, Eddie tries to collect himself and goes in again. But that\u2019s not quite right, either; he\u2019s got a bad angle. Their chins knock together and it doesn\u2019t hurt Eddie but maybe it hurts Steve. Shit, Eddie is fucking this up.\u00a0\nSteve pulls Eddie away from his mouth by his hair. It makes Eddie\u2019s vision go blurry. He winds up gasping into the open air and staring at Steve Harrington\u2019s slick mouth. At his charming smile.\u00a0\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Steve murmurs. \u201cRelax, Eds, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\u00a0\n Eds,  Eddie thinks, baffled.  What the fuck.\nAnd then he just has to kiss Steve Harrington again. Because what the fuck? What the fuck. What the fuck? The whole night has been a fever dream. The whole fucking  week has been\u2014 this week where Steve Harrington has been looking at him with focused eyes, has been eating popsicles in genuinely insane ways\u2014 Eddie needs to kiss him or he\u2019ll die. He\u2019ll fucking die, that\u2019s what it feels like.\nHe dives back in, mouth already open, tongue already out, and Steve huffs. Turns Eddie\u2019s desperation into something warm and close and  good.\u00a0 \nEddie wraps his arms around Steve\u2019s waist. Their bare chests are pushed together tight. He almost wishes Steve was wearing a shirt. Just so he could have something to cling to.\nIt\u2019s only  almost  a wish, though, because Steve\u2019s skin is smooth and hot and turning Eddie the  fuck on.\u00a0\nSuddenly a little bit frantic, Eddie shoves himself into Steve because he\u2019s just not sure what else to  do. But he pushes too hard, or maybe Steve wasn\u2019t braced for it, because Steve\u2019s head knocks back into the brick of his house and Eddie pulls away with a panicked noise.\u00a0\n\u201cOw,\u201d Steve says. His hair is ruffled and his lips are wet with spit. Eddie thinks Steve\u2019s got spit down his chin, too, and that\u2019s definitely Eddie\u2019s fault.\n\u201cOh, shit, I am so sorry,\u201d Eddie says, horrified with himself. And he\u2019s talking about Steve hitting his head, and his apparently awful kissing technique, and also some other third thing he should probably be apologizing for but can\u2019t think of right now.\nSteve stares at him for a moment, just as unreadable as he\u2019s ever been to Eddie, then smiles. It\u2019s a gentle quirk of his lips, understanding and kind. It makes Eddie shake and shiver and want to fucking  die.\u00a0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, man,\u201d Steve tells him.\nEddie\u2019s stomach falls out his ass.\u00a0\n Man.  Not  Eds  or even  Eddie, like he\u2019d used just a second ago.\n\u201cHey, woah,\u201d Steve says, and he pulls Eddie back in. His arms are bare and strong, thick in that way Eddie\u2019s been thinking about for weeks, ever since he saw Steve shirtless and ripping a monster apart with his bare hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face for, Munson?\u2019\nEddie stares at him, baffled. Their chests and hips and thighs are pressed tightly together. They\u2019re so close he can feel Steve breathing, the in and out of his bare stomach against Eddie\u2019s own.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, are you embarrassed?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cBecause I, like, bonked my head? Dude. Shit happens.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me dude right now, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says sourly.\u00a0\nHe thinks Steve will probably laugh. Snort and shake his head, grinning that grin that\u2019s not quite mean but not quite nice either. It's a hot fucking expression but Eddie doesn't want to see it, not like this.\u00a0\nExcept Steve doesn\u2019t. Steve looks at him, face calm and thoughtful\u2014 hadn\u2019t  that  been a trip and a half, when Eddie first realized that Steve is a  thinker, is\u00a0an  introspective person\u2014 and then Steve nudges their noses together.\u00a0\n\u201cBaby,\u201d Steve says. Eddie\u2019s heart  thumps. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I promise it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Eddie blurts unthinkingly. And then he commits to it, despite the humiliation, because that\u2019s what he  does. Commits to incredibly embarrassing shit and makes it fucking work for him. \u201cSay it\u2026 Say it again.\u201d\nSteve Harrington\u2014 King  fucking  Steve, basketball star, swim captain, and  monster killer  Steve Harrington, what the fuck is going  on\u2014  seals their mouths together. His lips are plump and soft and confident.\n\u201cBaby,\u201d Steve whispers.\n\u201cOh,  fuck,\u201d Eddie moans, and then dives back into Steve.\u00a0\nHe kisses Steve frantically, twisting his head and body, trying to squirm as close as possible. The weed is still buzzing softly under his skin, making Eddie feel hot and slow and tingly. He shoves his arms back around Steve\u2019s waist, low on his back, thinks about trying to grab his ass but decides against it because he can barely focus just doing  this. Just kissing and wiggling against Steve\u2019s body. Just running his tongue against Steve\u2019s. He\u2019s going out of his fucking head with it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking liar,\u201d Eddie says, gasping, because Steve is, he  is,  and they need to kiss forever, what the fuck is Eddie doing? What the fuck is he even  talking about? \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve agrees, tilting his head and coming back for another kiss.\u00a0\n\u201cShotgunning,\u201d Eddie pants, baffled, and squeezes his legs against Steve\u2019s thigh.\u00a0\nSteve laughs. He pulls away from Eddie\u2019s mouth and starts nibbling at his neck, lips and teeth and tongue, and Eddie wants to fucking\u2014 like\u2014 cry or something because it feels so good.\nHe bites down hard against Eddie\u2019s neck. Eddie bites his own lip because he feels like he\u2019s going to explode.\u00a0\n\u201cWell I had to do fucking  something, Munson, you weren\u2019t taking the fucking hint,\u201d Steve tells him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you calling me Munson for,\u201d Eddie says, tipping his head back so Steve can kiss further down his neck.  Go back to Eddie,  Eddie thinks but can\u2019t quite say.  Go back to Eds. Call me baby again, fuck me for even thinking it. \nSteve licks a long stripe up his neck, sweeping Eddie\u2019s still-dripping hair over his shoulder. He sucks Eddie\u2019s earlobe into his mouth, fiddles with his earring with his tongue.\u00a0\n\u201cSure, Eddie.\u201d Steve twirls the stud with his teeth and Eddie fucking\u2014 has a seizure or something. He  shakes.  \u201cBaby,\u201d Steve says again, and Eddie isn\u2019t, like,  proud  of it but he whines.\n\u201cEars, huh?\u201d Steve says, dragging his lips up the shell of Eddie\u2019s. Eddie hadn\u2019t even known he would like that, what the fuck is  happening.  \u201cI can work with that.\u201d\nAimlessly, Eddie thinks,  please, yeah, before there\u2019s a sudden sound from behind him and his whole body freezes.\u00a0\nEverything stops. Eddie\u2019s heart, his lungs. He doesn\u2019t breathe. He doesn\u2019t fucking blink. The brick of Steve\u2019s house and Steve\u2019s stupid pale face swims in front of his eyes.\nThey\u2019re outside. They\u2019re at the party with Argyle and Robin. Jonathan and Nancy.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat the fuck is Eddie  doing,  what is he doing, what is he doing, what the fuck is  Steve Harrington doing\u2014\u00a0 \n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Steve murmurs. \u201cBreathe. It\u2019s fine. I can see them, Eds, I\u2019m looking right at all of them, and it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re okay. Take a breath, we\u2019re alright.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie clutches at Steve\u2019s bare waist and tries to follow his directions.  Breathe,  Steve said, so Eddie does.  We\u2019re alright, Steve told him, and Eddie tries to believe it.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says. His voice is too soft to sound mean. Too confused to sound accusing.\nSteve sighs. Pulls Eddie in for something that\u2019s almost a hug and then starts untangling their limbs.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want pizza?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cI want pizza.\u201d He steps to the side, out from under Eddie\u2019s body, and the night air is suddenly cold against Eddie\u2019s bare chest.\nEddie\u2019s heart drops right down into his stomach acid, where it gets, like, fucking  boiled. That\u2019s the only explanation for why his chest suddenly hurts so bad. For the way his throat suddenly feels tight.\u00a0\nBut then Steve snags Eddie\u2019s hand, tugging until Eddie\u2019s hand is tucked into the curve of Steve\u2019s bare waist, and suddenly Eddie could fucking fly. Could sing a hundred fucking ballads.\n What are you  doing,  Harrington, Eddie thinks. He doesn\u2019t say it, though. Not again. It hadn\u2019t been the right thing to say\u2014 Steve pulled away after. Eddie had fucked up, fucking dumb as shit like he always is.\u00a0\nHe holds Steve\u2019s waist and tries to feel like he\u2019s not clutching at it.\u00a0\nMustering every bit of his courage\u2014 and Eddie fucking  has it,  he has a  lot  of it, he deals meth on the weekends and he\u2019s fought monsters and he isn\u2019t a  fucking coward\u2014 Eddie finally turns around. Looks out at Steve\u2019s yard and the people in it.\u00a0\nRobin and Argyle are still laying in the grass, off in their own universe, staring at the stars. Eddie glances at them nervously then looks away, trying to breathe normally.\nThe loud thud had, apparently, been Nancy and Jonathan Byers accidentally tipping over a tiny table for drinks next to their chair. No big deal. But they\u2019re  looking  at Eddie: glancing over, then at each other, and back over again. Eddie rolls his shoulders back and straightens his spine before he realizes, wait. No, they\u2019re looking at  Steve. \nSomehow that\u2019s worse. He\u2019s not sure why it\u2019s worse, but it is.\u00a0\nEddie huddles in a little closer to Steve, tucked just slightly behind his shoulder, his hand still on Steve\u2019s waist.\u00a0\nLike, sure, Eddie fought monsters with Nancy Wheeler. He had an absolutely horrible fucking two weeks with her and the Party and Robin while he was hunted by the police, and\u2014 and whatever. Whatever. That doesn\u2019t really matter. That\u2019s not important right now. Those horrible two weeks aren't important.\nNancy Wheeler and Jonathan Byers are  Steve\u2019s, is what Eddie is trying to get at; they\u2019re Steve\u2019s people. Eddie has no clue what he\u2019s supposed to do right now. How Steve is going to work this. What he\u2019s supposed to say, if he\u2019s supposed to say anything at all.\u00a0\nMaybe Steve does this all the time, brings guys to his house and kisses them against the wall by his pool where everyone can see. Maybe Steve\u2019s never done this before and they\u2019re both going to get run the fuck out of town.\u00a0\nEddie doesn\u2019t really think Byers or Nancy would snitch like that. Not really. But he just doesn\u2019t fucking  know.\u00a0\nAnd then Steve\u2014 Steve fucking. He tugs one of Eddie\u2019s arms, then the other, wrapping them around his stomach until they\u2019re walking while Eddie hugs him. Eddie blinks rapidly, feeling struck stupid, like Steve smacked him over the head with something, and then tightens his grip. Rolls with it, because the alternative is letting Steve go and he is  not doing that. He\u2019s stupid but not that fucking stupid, thanks.\n\u201cYou guys hungry yet? I\u2019m thinking pizza,\u201d Steve announces when they\u2019re closer. Eddie leans a little over his shoulder.\u00a0\nByers and Nancy stop pretending not to stare at Steve and just gawk at him outright.\u00a0\nSteve gives them a beaming smile, beatific and a little smug, and Eddie\u2019s heart twists in his chest like larvae-filled eggs. Or something.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s gross, is what Eddie means.\u00a0\n\u201cPizza,\u201d Nancy Wheeler says, squinting. She\u2019s tapping her fingers on Byers\u2019 leg, a quick rhythm that looks a little irritated. \u201cWere you planning on  pizza  this whole night, or is this an impulse buy? Because it would be really  irresponsible if it were.\u201d Wheeler pauses, then adds as an afterthought, \u201cFinancially, I mean.\u201d\nSteve rolls his eyes. Eddie stares between him and Wheeler, baffled. Is he the pizza? Is that what they\u2019re talking about?\n\u201cYes, this was the plan, Nance. Ask Robin; the whole reason we threw this party was so I could\u2026 order pizza.\u201d Steve bares his teeth at her.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, relax,\u201d Byers interjects.\u00a0\nSteve and Nancy both huff.\u00a0\nEddie chews his lip nervously, wondering if he should let go of Steve and go lay down by Robin and Argyle.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s fine if you\u2026 order pizza, Steve. We would never have a problem with that.\u201d Byers stares up at Steve with Wheeler on his lap, his eyes big and genuine. Steve stares back at him, softening slightly, and Eddie thinks bitterly that Byers has stupid hair. Really fucking stupid.\u00a0\n\u201cIt just would\u2019ve been nice to have known you were going to order it tonight,\u201d Nancy Wheeler says. She throws her hands up, scowling like Steve's purposely... Eddie doesn't know. Kept some big secret from her, maybe. Lied to her or something. But then she seems to catch herself. She blinks a couple times, kind of fast, and then starts laughing\u2014 either at Steve or herself, Eddie doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0\nHe is, like, so fucking confused.\nHe\u2019s even more confused when Steve starts laughing, too.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, you wanted to help me pick the toppings?\u201d Steve says. He\u2019s full of good humor, eyes bright, shoulders relaxed. Eddie wants to fucking bite them, sink his teeth into the meat of him.\u00a0\nWhat the fuck is wrong with him, holy shit.\u00a0\n\u201cYes!\u201d Wheeler wheezes back, overcome with giggles. She\u2019s fucking tearing up and Jonathan starts laughing, too. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to put\u2014\u201d she glances at Eddie. Eddie smiles at her, his Freak\u00a0Munson  smile, the big and bold and flashy one.  \u201cAnchovies on it!\u201d\nFucking anchovies. Wheeler\u2019s just called him anchovies.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, I am at least, like, fucking pineapple,\u201d Eddie complains.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can be whatever you want, Munson,\u201d Steve says, condescending like he is sometimes. \u201cDon\u2019t ever let anyone tell you different.\u201d\n\u201cNot even Nancy,\u201d Byers agrees, and fine.\nFine.\u00a0\nEddie starts laughing, too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEddie has this weird, vague hope\u2014 he\u2019s not calling it a fantasy, or a daydream, because that would be insane\u2014 that he\u2019ll get to sit on Steve\u2019s lap while they eat.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t, of course.\nRobin Buckley beats him to it.\u00a0\nAfter Steve and Nancy\u2019s weird fucking showdown, Steve goes inside, orders pizza, then drags another pool chair over so that they can sit by Nancy and Byers. He pulls Eddie down next to him and they sit pressed together, their wet jeans rubbing and bare arms brushing, while Wheeler and Byers try to explain something convoluted about\u2026 housing development?\u00a0\nThey\u2019re investigating something. It\u2019s on the edge of town, further out than even the trailer park, and Eddie never wants to see another fucking monster again so he mostly tunes them out.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s thirty minutes until the pizza guy rings the doorbell. Steve stands to get it and they all shuffle inside, Nancy and Byers going to retrieve Robin and Argyle from their prone positions in the grass.\u00a0\nEddie just kind of\u2026 stands and watches them do it. He\u2019s not really sure what to do with himself.\nDoes he pretend he wasn\u2019t just making out with Steve Harrington?  No idea what you\u2019re all talking about, get off my ass, pass me another slice of pepperoni? Does he brazen it out?\u00a0\nThey all head inside before Eddie can figure out what to do, which is typical. Eddie panicking and hesitating while life happens around him, passing him by while he\u2019s stuck in one spot.\u00a0\nHe follows them inside. What the fuck else could he do?\nAnd there\u2019s Steve, in the warm yellow lights of his weirdly empty home, boxes of pizza on the table. Hefting plates down from cabinets. Robin shakes herself and then goes to help him. After a moment, Nancy Wheeler walks over, too, pulling down cups. Finding napkins.\u00a0\nArgyle is leaning on Byers, grinning, and Byers is shaking his head, looking endeared.\nEddie fidgets. He shifts from foot to foot, tugs on his hair. Wishes, suddenly, to be wearing a shirt.\u00a0\nThey all grab plates and slices of pizza and troop into the living room. They find their spots again; Wheeler and Byers on the couch, Argyle on the floor, Steve in his recliner.\u00a0\nHe bites his lip. Hesitates.\u00a0\nBefore Eddie can muster up the courage to go to Steve, sit on the arm of his chair or\u2014 if he\u2019s really fucking bold, if he digs deep and finds that  Freak Munson  energy\u2014 on Steve\u2019s lap, Robin swans past him and flops onto Steve. He catches her without so much as blinking.\nHe wraps her up in his arms, still bare-chested, and those puckered scars on his sides glimmer in the living room light. Robin tucks herself in, her shoulder under his armpit, her nose near his neck. Her eyes are still bloodshot. She goes to town on her slice of pizza; she almost finishes it off in two bites. Robin holds the last of the slice out to Steve, who takes a sloppy bite of it. Sauce goes down his chin and Robin cackles, then swipes it off with her fingers. She stares down at her dirty hand, confused, before wiping it on Steve\u2019s jeans. Steve just rolls his eyes at her.\u00a0\nIt makes Eddie feel\u2026\u00a0\nIt just makes him feel. That\u2019s all.\u00a0\nInstead of sitting on Steve\u2019s lap, Eddie sits next to Argyle on the floor. He dodges Steve's eyes by ducking his head and focusing on his pizza; Steve is trying to silently tell him something, but Eddie doesn't want to know. Doesn't want to figure it out. He tries to not stare at Steve and Robin, sprawled out so comfortably he thinks they must sit like this all the time. He doesn\u2019t look at Wheeler and Byers, either, sitting shoulder to shoulder and sharing a plate. It\u2019s balanced between both their knees.\nSomeone, somehow, started a record when they came in. Probably Steve. It skips and scratches, stutters over the same phrase.  And my baby leaves\u2014 my baby leaves\u2014 my baby leaves. \n\u201cYou need to smoke some more, man,\u201d Argyle drawls from Eddie\u2019s left. \u201cYou\u2019re making an absolutely tragic fuckin\u2019 face right now.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie opens his mouth. Shuts it again.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, probably, man,\u201d he sighs.\u00a0\nBut before Eddie can stand up, go find his weed and his shirt and his dignity, Steve says, \u201cAlright, Robs. You\u2019re the light of my life, but get up. This is Eddie\u2019s spot.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie freezes. His cheeks get hot, then hotter, until he thinks he must be glowing apple red. The pounding of his heart turns faster, twisting excitedly in his chest like a wriggling puppy.\u00a0\n Eddie\u2019s spot. Fuck.\nHalf covering his face with his hair, Eddie stares up at Steve and Robin.\u00a0\nRobin looks high as all hell, eyes red and drooping a little, and she mouths to herself for a moment before gasping. She claps her hands over her cheeks, like she\u2019s mimicking Munch\u2019s  Scream,  and says, \u201cOh my God! Oh my God, I am so sorry.\u201d And then she\u2019s  diving out of Steve\u2019s lap.\n\u201cOh, shit, Munson, sorry!\u201d Robin apologizes again, tripping over herself and landing on her ass. She spills pizza onto the carpet and scoops it up, wincing. Dimly, he hears Byers and Nancy snickering.\nEddie watches her, baffled, beating back an odd swelling sensation in his chest.\u00a0\nSteve grins at Robin, like he\u2019s trying not to all-out laugh, then turns to Eddie. His eyes go liquid, smooth and shiny. \u201cYou coming up here?\u201d\nSomehow, Eddie climbs to his feet. It feels like his legs are a bunch of blocks precariously stacked together. Like he could collapse at any moment. He clutches at his plate of pizza like he would a life-raft in the ocean.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t actually have to sit on my lap,\u201d Steve murmurs, sweetly and just to Eddie, once he gets close. \u201cI just\u2026 You were looking pretty blue.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI was not,\u201d Eddie denies, even though he very definitely was. He\u2019d felt, like, fucking heartbroken about sitting on the floor.\nBefore Steve can argue with him, or change his mind, Eddie flops down on top of him. His arms and legs kind of go everywhere, flailing, but Eddie just makes it into a big show. Just to save face. He\u2019s leaning further and further into the performance, into  Eddie the freak  and he can\u2019t quite stop it. Doesn\u2019t think he  wants to stop it\u2014 if he does, he won\u2019t do anything at all.\u00a0\nSprawled on Steve\u2019s lap, he glances around the room nervously. They\u2019re all ignoring him, too high or drunk to care about anything except eating. Or, at least, they\u2019re pretending like they are.\nEddie picks up his pizza and accidentally squishes the cheese around. Sauce gets on his fingers and he holds up his hand, disgruntled, like  look at this shit. He\u2019s still on Steve\u2019s lap trying to look comfortable. It\u2019s probably not working\u2014 he\u2019s holding his spine so stiffly he thinks it might snap.\u00a0\nFrom behind his shoulder, Steve gives a little huff. Eddie glances back nervously and discovers that Steve\u2019s shaking his head a little, something warm on his face. He reaches out with a napkin and, gently, grabs Eddie by the palm. With one long swipe, he cleans the sauce off Eddie\u2019s fingers.\nAnd then Steve kind of\u2026 doesn\u2019t let go of his hand. Which is fine. Better than fine. Great! Eddie is down to hold hands. He's the world's best handholder, or whatever. Or he could be. Or something.\nWhen Steve starts to massage his hand, thumb pressing hard into the meat of Eddie\u2019s palm, Eddie\u2019s spine goes loose. With one last glance around at everyone, Eddie thinks,  fuck it. He tips his head back onto Steve\u2019s shoulder. Tries to relax his abdomen.\u00a0\nThey are both still, still,  fucking still shirtless. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s the best.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s dick is fucking hard.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a surprise, exactly, because that had been the best kiss of his life and  Steve Harrington  is currently shirtless and pressed along his back. It\u2019s just embarrassing, is all. To be hard in front of everyone. He\u2019s shirtless and in wet jeans, so there\u2019s not much  camouflage  happening. It\u2019s not that obvious, not yet, but if he gets harder it\u2019ll be easy to spot. Not that Eddie thinks they\u2019re looking\u2014 none of them are, they\u2019re all occupied with their pizza and each other\u2014 but  he knows. Eddie knows.\nIt makes his heart race in his chest. Determinedly, Eddie grabs his pizza with his other hand, because like fuck is he making Steve let go of him, and takes huge bites of it. Really hams it up, tries to make it funny, because there\u2019s no  attractive  way to eat food like this. He wishes, distantly, that there were. That Steve would look at him, doing something so normal, and think  wow. But there\u2019s not and he knows it, so Eddie tries to make it entertaining instead.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s good at entertaining people. At making them look at him. He can make Steve look at him, too.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a clown, Munson,\u201d Steve says, smile in his tone, and that\u2019s not  quite what Eddie had been going for, but. Close enough.\u00a0\nSteve doesn\u2019t let go of Eddie\u2019s hand. Eddie takes, like, great fucking pains to not move away.\u00a0\nSlow, tight circles are pressed into Eddie\u2019s skin. They\u2019re calm and consistent, and Eddie lets the last of his weight rest fully on Steve. When Steve digs his thumb into Eddie\u2019s palm, getting at some sort of knot, a low throb pulses through Eddie\u2019s hips. It\u2019s like his dick and hands are directly linked.\u00a0\n\u201cShit, Harrington,\u201d Eddie murmurs, turning his face into Steve\u2019s shoulder. His nose is almost touching Steve\u2019s neck and Eddie tries not to squirm. He\u2019s overwhelmed by feelings; embarrassment, affection, a strange type of skin hunger that he can\u2019t quite stifle.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s bare chest against his back is setting him on fire. He wants more of it. He wants more of it  now. \n\u201cShit, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says again. And then the words tumble back out of his mouth, like he\u2019s been hit with a truth spell. Irrepressible and vulnerable and so completely  wrong, because Steve hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about it before. Why would he now?\u00a0\nBut, like an idiot, Eddie murmurs, \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\nSteve straightens up. Eddie can feel his back bend, stiffen, and hates himself.  Fucking idiot,  Eddie thinks.  You\u2019re so fucking stupid, Munson. You\u2019re so fucking stupid.\u00a0 \nThe thoughts come on so fast they\u2019re like flood water rushing through him, but after the initial flinch Eddie shakes himself.  Shut the fuck up, he thinks.\u00a0\nWhen Steve responds, he\u2019s so slow and calm about it Eddie almost misses the words.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t answer earlier because I thought you knew,\u201d he tells Eddie. His voice is so fucking warm; Steve is such a warm person. Homey and comforting like a fucking bonfire. \u201cI thought you were teasing me, man. You really don\u2019t get it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie says, and his voice breaks a little. He clears his throat to try and cover it up, but the damage is done.\u00a0\nSteve nudges his nose along Eddie\u2019s hair. His lips shove against Eddie\u2019s forehead hard enough that it\u2019s not really a kiss. It can\u2019t really be anything else, either.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been flirting with you for, like, weeks. Eds, I gave a popsicle a blowjob just so you would look at me\u2014 and you  didn\u2019t, by the way. It was humiliating.\u201d Steve clunks his cheek against Eddie\u2019s head in a gentle reprimand. \u201cI literally faked weed virginity. Robin had to come up with the plan. I\u2019m such a mess about you, dude.\u201d\u00a0\nHe just\u2014  says all of this. Here on the recliner with Eddie in his lap, at this lame-ass party where everyone might hear him. Byers and Nancy and Robin and fucking Argyle are, like, three feet away.\u00a0\nThere's music playing, giving them a little bit of privacy, but still.\u00a0Still.\u00a0\nEddie almost wants to laugh. Fuck, but Steve is so fucking brave and he doesn\u2019t even seem to  realize it. Bold as brass tacks, that\u2019s what his Uncle Wayne would say, and Eddie\u2019s never known what the fuck his Uncle Wayne meant by that but maybe now he does.\n\u201cI, uh. Did not know any of that,\u201d Eddie says, a little belatedly.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Steve says, and Eddie can feel him shrug against his bare back.\u00a0\nThis whole night ranks in the  Top Five Fucking Weirdest Nights of Eddie Munson\u2019s Life and it\u2019s not even midnight. It\u2019s, like, ten.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Eddie says, baffled.\u00a0\nEddie chews his lip and tries to re-process the last few weeks. Tries to re-categorize his and Steve\u2019s interactions in his mind.\nWhen Steve greeted Eddie with his beaming smile, hugging him with his nose pressed to Eddie\u2019s temple, that was because Steve liked him.  Likes him. Steve heckling him at DnD sessions was flirting. Steve staring at him with hooded, dark eyes, wearing Eddie\u2019s vest like it had always belonged to him\u2026 Steve, with that blue popsicle in his mouth. Steve fucking Harrington, shoving Dustin off a couch just to sit next to Eddie.\u00a0\nA sigh from Steve breaks him out of his thoughts.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Steve says, his tone wry and strange. Full of some dry, gallows humor that Eddie has only heard from him a couple times before. \u201cLay it on me, man. I promise I won\u2019t get mad.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie says. \u201cLay what on you?\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a moment of hesitation. For the first time the whole fucking night, Eddie gets the impression that Steve is working himself up. Digging deep and planting his feet.\u00a0\n\u201cJust\u2026 whatever it is you need to say. You know.\u201d Steve lets go of his hand and leans to the side a little, so they can see each other's faces fully. Eddie is still on Steve\u2019s lap but, suddenly, Steve feels like he\u2019s on the other side of the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been real quiet, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\nEvery thought Eddie\u2019s ever had flies out of his brain. Escapes through his ear holes, or something. He spins in Steve\u2019s lap, overturning his empty pizza plate. He\u2019s not-quite straddling Steve, now, but he can\u2019t register that\u2014 he\u2019s caught in a strange panic, a sensation like sand or water slipping through his fingers. Like Steve is slipping away from him.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta know I\u2019m obsessed with you,\u201d Eddie blurts. \u201cLike, all the time I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m thinking about you, you know?\u201d\n\u201cHow the fuck would I know that,\u201d Steve sputters. \u201cYou barely look at me! I mean, Eds,  Eddie, I am fucking thrilled to hear it, you don\u2019t even know, but\u2014 you kept your cards pretty close to your chest, dude.\u201d\nEddie opens and shuts his mouth. Memories rewinding like VHS tape: Steve reaching out, Eddie pulling away. Averting his eyes. Trying not to laugh too loud, too long, at the stupid-funny jokes Steve came out with. Mocking Steve, occasionally, just in case. Just to cover his tracks.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d just been trying to\u2026 Eddie doesn\u2019t have a ton of genuine friends. Lackeys and DnD minions and people he deals to on the odd weekend, sure. But a friend like Steve? So genuine and steadfast and steady?\nEddie had tried so, so hard not to make Steve uncomfortable. Not to fuck up a good thing. Until this moment, he\u2019d been pretty proud of his efforts.\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Eddie says, mentally reviewing all the times he had, apparently, rejected Steve without even knowing. Fuck, but in hindsight some of those accidental rejections had been downright  mean.\u00a0 \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, man,\u201d Eddie tells him. He\u2019s desperate for Steve to believe it. \u201cI really didn\u2019t, I swear. I wouldn\u2019t have done\u2026 most of the shit I\u2019ve been doing if I did. You\u2019ve gotta believe me.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Steve says. Eddie nervously meets Steve\u2019s eyes, but Steve doesn\u2019t look mad. Doesn\u2019t look resentful or anything. Mostly, he looks relieved, and like he sort of wants to laugh. \u201cI believe you, baby, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\n Baby,  Eddie\u2019s earned back the word  baby.  It\u2019s better than  dude  or  Eddie  or even  Eds. It\u2019s so flattering, so tender, that it makes Eddie shiver.\u00a0\n\u201cDudes,\u201d Argyle calls, and immediately Byers, Nancy, and Robin are hissing  shut up, oh my God.\u00a0 \nSteve and Eddie freeze in perfect unison.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Argyle defends. \u201cThey just look like they need more weed, dudes, I\u2019m trying to be a  pal  here. Like, you know. Get everyone  vibing.\u201d \n\u201cWow,\u201d Steve says, and his voice is louder than it\u2019s been. He\u2019s talking to the whole room, his voice defensively wry. \u201cWell, this is just\u2026 humiliating. I thought the music was, you know. Loud enough you couldn\u2019t hear us.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe turned it down,\u201d Robin says. \u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0\nOut of the corner of his eye, Eddie sees Steve staring at her. Eddie looks nervously between Byers and Nancy. They\u2019ve got guilty looks on their faces and matching apologetic grins. Argyle looks fucking cooked\u2014 eyes red and hair frizzy.\u00a0\nAt his back, he can feel Steve start shaking. A jolt runs through Eddie and he shifts, concerned, but realizes Steve is only laughing.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you fucking turned it down,\u201d Steve says, stomach heaving. Eddie can feel it against his naked side, feels their bare skin brushing.\nHelplessly, Eddie grins. He couldn\u2019t contain it if he tried.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, Argyle\u2014 yeah, man,\u201d Eddie says. He shakes his head, still laughing. Steve leans up and forward into Eddie\u2019s side, slinging his arms around Eddie\u2019s waist. He buries his head into Eddie\u2019s shoulder, absolutely cackling. \u201cGive me the fucking blunt.\u201d\nSteve keeps laughing and Robin follows him into hysterics. He rocks Eddie side to side, clinging, and Eddie tips his head back in order to push his forehead against Steve\u2019s temple.\u00a0\nArgyle holds out two blunts, one half-smoked and the other freshly rolled. \u201cKeep these, dudes,\u201d he tells them. \u201cI\u2019ve got, like, four more rolled.\u201d\nEddie stares at Argyle, baffled, while Byers throws his hands up and Nancy pinches her nose in order to hide her smile.\n\u201cShit, man,\u201d Eddie says, shaking his head. The motion rubs Steve\u2019s hair against his cheek. \u201cPizza delivery must pay super fuckin\u2019 good, huh?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Jonathan Byers says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he fucking does it.\u201d He\u2019s got this look on his face, like he turns this over in his head on sleepless nights. Like an irrational part of him thinks Argyle might be some sort of magic, and able to summon blunts at will. A weed wizard.\n\u201cI grow it, man,\u201d Argyle says. \u201cI thought you knew that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow the fuck would I know that?\u201d Byers asks, an echo of Steve.\u00a0\nRobin and Steve keep cackling. Nancy shakes her head and Eddie leans back against Steve, accepting the blunts and the lighter Argyle offers him.\u00a0\nEddie puts the lit blunt between his teeth. He breathes in. He basks in the hot burning, the slight fuzzing of his limbs, the feeling of Steve\u2019s naked skin pressed against his own.\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s hands slide across his stomach, calluses catching slightly at the hair on Eddie\u2019s lower belly. His fingers stroke back and forth, just above Eddie\u2019s belt.\u00a0\n Fuck,  Eddie thinks.  Fuck.\u00a0 \nHe twists a little. Holds the blunt up to Steve\u2019s mouth.\nSteve grins at him, white toothed and mischievous, his eyes twinkling. He takes the hit like a champ, no coughing in sight.\u00a0\n Fuck, Eddie thinks for a third time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe six of them end up sprawled on the floor, puffing and passing. Eddie and Steve hoard their two blunts like gold, refusing to share with Robin.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t smoked in ages,\u201d Steve defends. He passes the blunt to Eddie, out of Robin\u2019s reach.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThese were a gift,\u201d Eddie says, leaning away when she tries to snatch it.\u00a0\nArgyle and Jonathan ignore them. They\u2019re staring up at the ceiling like there\u2019s something cool up there, like it\u2019s not just stucco.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you both,\u201d Robin whines, and Steve cackles.\u00a0\nThey lock eyes and Steve raises one corner of his mouth, then one eyebrow. Robin shakes her head at him like he\u2019s said something.\n\u201cThat was a pathetic joke,\u201d Robin tells Steve. \u201cGenuinely terrible.\u201d\nSteve grins lazily. \u201cIt was fucking funny and I\u2019m the funniest person you\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nEddie watches them in awe. Considers, briefly, that the Upside Down gave them powers, somehow, and that they can communicate telepathically. But, then again, probably not; they\u2019ve been like this for as long as Eddie\u2019s known them.\u00a0\nSteve and Robin are freaks, they have the freakiest symbiotic relationship Eddie's ever seen. It's majorly funny.\u00a0\nRobin shoves Steve\u2019s shoulder and Steve tugs her down, smacks three kisses across her forehead, cheek, and chin, and Robin strokes his hair for a moment. And then she turns to Nancy like nothing happened, babbling a blue streak about\u2014 the Dewey decimal system?\nWhatever.\u00a0\nSteve is flat on his back and Eddie wants to be, like, on top of him. But that would be weird probably, so he does the next best thing\u2014 he lays down right beside Steve and tosses a leg over Steve\u2019s hips.\u00a0\nHe shuffles until their legs are twined together, Eddie\u2019s hips pressed flush to Steve\u2019s waist. A lazy, hot throbbing starts back up in Eddie\u2019s hips\u2014 a pulse, pulse, pulsing that echoes his heartbeat.\u00a0\nEddie is so high he feels fuzzy, feels like he\u2019s swimming through air. Every puff of Steve\u2019s breath ripples across him like water.\nIn response to the feeling, Eddie shifts, then shifts again. He restlessly strokes his fingers down Steve\u2019s forearm, and Steve catches his hand. Brings it to his mouth and kisses Eddie\u2019s palm, easy as anything.\u00a0\nThe feeling of it, Steve\u2019s mouth against Eddie\u2019s hand, buzzes across Eddie. When Steve drags his lips up, toward Eddie\u2019s fingers, a strange noise bubbles up in Eddie\u2019s chest. He swallows it down and watches Steve with wide eyes.\nSteve brushes his mouth up, puts a kiss on each of Eddie\u2019s knuckles. And they\u2019re not\u2026 like, they\u2019re not  small  kisses, either. Steve\u2019s teeth scrape slightly, hook on Eddie\u2019s skin, and every so often he bites down. He drags his tongue across the pad of Eddie\u2019s finger and Eddie can\u2019t help it\u2014 he moans. It comes out of him,  fu-uck, like he\u2019s been hit.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s quiet, at least. Hopefully no one heard it but Steve\u2014 they\u2019ve got the music back on, turned up loud, and he and Steve are a few feet from everyone else anyway.\u00a0\nSlowly, Steve rolls so that he\u2019s on his side, too. Eddie\u2019s leg is still hitched over his waist. It pulls their hips tight together. He can feel the metal button of Steve\u2019s jeans low on his stomach.\u00a0\nEddie shifts, trying to get closer, hoping that Steve doesn\u2019t notice the fact that he\u2019s hard even as he hopes that he  does. \u00a0\nThey\u2019re nose to nose. Steve stares at him, pupils blown wide from smoking. His lips are slick and red. Eddie bites his bottom lip and doesn\u2019t look away. Couldn\u2019t if he tried.\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie tells him, because he can\u2019t think of anything better.\u00a0\nSteve responds by raising his eyebrows up then down very fast, a goofy sort of wiggle paired with a close-mouthed grin. It\u2019s charming. Eddie is fucking charmed.\u00a0\n\u201cHey yourself,\u201d Steve says back, sliding closer.\nJust like that, Steve is kissing him again. Kissing Eddie like it\u2019s easy, like he can\u2019t help himself.\nEddie hooks his fingers into Steve\u2019s belt loops and  pulls. He\u2019s too eager, too clumsy, and they more or less crash together, but Steve doesn\u2019t seem to mind.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, baby,\u201d Steve says. He wraps a hand around Eddie\u2019s thigh, which is still hitched over Steve\u2019s hip.\u00a0\nHe slides his hand over until it\u2019s just under Eddie\u2019s ass and what the  fuck, but that feeling makes Eddie clutch at Steve and shove their chests together. Steve pulls Eddie\u2019s hips up, hand still tucked into the divet between Eddie\u2019s ass and thigh, and holds Eddie tight against his body. At the same time, he slides his tongue against Eddie\u2019s teeth.\n\u201cOh,  fuck, Steve,\u201d Eddie gasps. Or he tries to, anyway\u2014 Steve keeps kissing him.\nIt\u2019s hot and open-mouthed. Steve coaxes him into opening up wider and wider, until his jaw is stretched and almost hurting. It hurts really good, though. Eddie tries to kiss back, shoves his tongue against Steve\u2019s in a slick glide that sends a shower of shivers down his spine.\u00a0\nHe clutches tight to Steve\u2019s bare back, thinks he\u2019s probably digging his nails in too deep but he can\u2019t fucking stop. Eddie tilts his head back and tries to get a better angle, tries to get Steve\u2019s tongue wrapped all the way around his own.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not even kissing so much as it is sliding their tongues together. It feels so, so good\u2014 Eddie really likes it, fuck, nobody ever lets him kiss them like this. Nobody  likes  it like he does\u2014 it\u2019s usually tolerated for about five minutes before he gets shoved off. Before the other person giggles and says,  nobody ever taught you how to kiss, huh? Let me fix that.\u00a0 \nPeople don\u2019t  like  kissing like this. It\u2019s slimy and wet and nevermind the fact that it sends Eddie into the stratosphere every time it happens; it\u2019s  gross. Shit, but Steve probably hates it.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Eddie says, pulling away and gasping. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d Even while he talks, though, he\u2019s kissing Steve, their lips sliding and hooking on each other. All wet with spit.\u00a0\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Steve says, and then doesn\u2019t let Eddie respond. Doesn\u2019t wait, just uses the hand not holding Eddie by the ass to clutch at his hair. Pulls his head back with a tight grip.\nEddie\u2019s mouth drops again, wholly without his permission, and Steve seals them back together. Flicks his tongue across Eddie\u2019s lips then pulls back slightly, goes back to sliding their lips together with a happy sigh, and Eddie just\u2014 just can\u2019t  resist.\u00a0 \nHe touches Steve\u2019s tongue with his own, begging silently for Steve to open his mouth more. To get closer. For him to grind his tongue against Eddie\u2019s the way he was doing a second ago.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a pause, just for a moment, and then Steve  does.\u00a0 \nAnd it\u2019s even better than before; somehow, Steve moves with more purpose, more focus. He stops pausing to pay attention to Eddie\u2019s lips and instead sucks on Eddie\u2019s tongue. Rubs the side of Eddie\u2019s tongue with his own, slides Eddie\u2019s tongue between his teeth, biting just enough for pressure. Not enough to hurt.\u00a0\nFuck, it does the  opposite  of hurt. Oh, fuck, oh  fuck.\u00a0 \nSteve pulls away, just barely, in order to breathe. Their lips are still touching. Eddie is gasping right into his face, panting, every couple breaths almost turning into a whine.\n\u201cYou got a thing for tongue, Munson?\u201d Steve murmurs.\n\u201cShut the fuck up, yes,  fuck, come back here,\u201d Eddie says.\u00a0\nSteve laughs. Steve laughs and Eddie can feel it against his mouth and something inside him  snaps.\u00a0 \nHe grabs Steve under his arms and yanks, hard, until Steve tumbles over him, landing hard on Eddie\u2019s chest. One elbow comes down by Eddie\u2019s head, Steve holding himself up.\u00a0\nEddie sputters and gasps, \u201ckiss me, kiss me  right now\u2014\u201d\u00a0 \nSteve does. He dives back down and, shit, but he\u2019s got Eddie\u2019s fucking number now doesn\u2019t he? Immediately Steve is kissing him in a way that\u2019s wet and sloppy and so  good, his tongue back in Eddie\u2019s mouth with no build-up, and Eddie can\u2019t help it. He squirms and wraps both of his legs around one of Steve\u2019s, shoving up against Steve\u2019s thigh.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s just barely coherent enough to hope that Steve\u2019s body is blocking Eddie from the rest of the room, because he can\u2019t stop moving. Can\u2019t stop tightening and relaxing his legs, can\u2019t stop nudging his chin against Steve\u2019s, can\u2019t stop thrusting his tongue back into Steve\u2019s mouth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSteve twists their tongues together. And then it\u2019s like he\u2014 like he\u2019s fucking stroking down Eddie\u2019s tongue with his own, up and down and around, and Eddie\u2019s whole body trembles and rocks.\u00a0\n\u201cYou cold, man?\u201d Steve teases in a whisper. His voice is thick and slow and  hot. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie just shakes his head, pulling Steve closer with his legs. His arms are around Steve\u2019s shoulders and he\u2019s clutching at Steve too tight, tight enough to bruise him, but he can\u2019t help it. His hips twitch, then twitch again, until he\u2019s thrusting almost rhythmically against Steve.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s moving in tiny humping motions because he\u2019s trying so, so hard not to get caught. Not by any of the others in the room\u2014 not even by Steve. Like maybe he can steal an orgasm, snatch it out from under everyone\u2019s noses, because he fucking needs it. He needs it, he needs it, he  needs it.\u00a0\nEddie hasn\u2019t  needed  anything like this since he stopped\u2026 sampling his own wares, so to speak. Fuck, he wants an orgasm the way he wanted coke at age fifteen. He\u2019s  twitching with it.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie gasps, and is shocked by his own voice. He sounds fucking\u2014 strung out.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,  shit, Eddie,\u201d Steve moans, and for the first time Steve\u2019s hips kick against Eddie\u2019s own.\u00a0\nImmediately, Eddie thrusts back, locking his legs so tight around Steve that his ankles cross. He\u2019s really, genuinely shaking now, his thighs and knees trembling around Steve\u2019s leg, his abdomen tensing and releasing.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve says. \u201cOkay, okay, hold on\u2014 okay.\u201d\u00a0\n \u201cDo not get off me,\u201d Eddie hisses, but is ignored.\u00a0\nSteve rolls off him, Eddie\u2019s hands sliding down his bare skin, and Eddie gasps up at the ceiling feeling like he\u2019s just surfaced from the bottom of a lake. His legs are still spasming, so hard it\u2019s visible  fuck his life,  and his pants are still clinging and he\u2019s still shirtless and  everyone can probably see how hard he is  and fuck him,  fuck him, because that doesn\u2019t bring him down from the brink at all. It does the opposite, actually.\nEddie\u2019s always loved when people watch him. Always loved being the center of attention; fuck, he stands up on cafeteria tables yelling about sorcery and sodomy just so people will look at him. Fuck,  fuck, fuck\u2014 he wants to touch himself. He\u2019s high as shit and he wants to just\u2014 stick his hand down his pants right the fuck now.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t. He turns his head and looks out at the room instead, and\u2014 nobody is looking at him. Argyle is fast asleep, Robin has headphones on. Byers and Nancy are sitting, backs stiff as boards, in front of the television.\u00a0\nBetween the TV volume and the record still spinning, nobody heard him or Steve.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s\u2014 a relief, actually. A knot of fear that Eddie didn\u2019t know he had loosens, relaxes, dissolves.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMe and Eddie are getting cold,\u201d Steve announces. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go, uh, find shirts. Upstairs.\u201d\nSteve doesn\u2019t wait for anyone to respond. He tugs Eddie up from the floor, wraps an arm around Eddie\u2019s waist. He leans on Steve because his legs are, like, fucking shaking. Steve hustles Eddie out of the room and up the stairs, his chest to Eddie\u2019s back.\u00a0\n\u201cMove, move, move,\u201d Steve urges.\u00a0\nAs they tumble toward Steve\u2019s room, Eddie floats back into his body a little bit. While making out with Steve, he\u2026 he doesn\u2019t know how to describe it. It was like every part of his body felt good; every part of him was throbbing, pulsing. Everything was so sensitive he didn\u2019t think about his dick at all. Eddie\u2019s going to blame the weed for that, but he\u2019s got the uncomfortable suspicion it might\u2019ve just been Steve. Just Steve Harrington, focused and observant and intent on pushing all his buttons.\nNow that he\u2019s up and moving, he becomes aware of how fucking\u2026  tight his cock feels. He\u2019s so hard it\u2019s like his skin is too small, the grip of his jeans feels like a hand squeezing him just right.\u00a0\u00a0\nEddie is embarrassingly, humiliatingly, toe-curlingly hard. He sticks his hand between his legs because it fucking\u2014 it almost  hurts,  and it hurts so good, and he\u2019s got to, he\u2019s  got to.\u00a0\nHe rubs up and down over his dick like he\u2019s massaging out a muscle, Steve still pushing at his back.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, shit, Eddie, are you touching yourself right now?\u201d Steve asks. He slides his hands down Eddie\u2019s chest, over his stomach, catches Eddie\u2019s hand where\u2014  yes\u2014  he\u2019s touching himself.\nA gasp against his neck, a choked-off noise, and suddenly Steve is shoving Eddie into the wall, just feet from his bedroom door.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s back slams against it hard. The smooth paint is cold against his naked spine but he doesn\u2019t give a  fuck\u2014 he grapples at Steve and hauls him in, smashing their mouths together and grinding against Steve with his chest and hips.\nTheir mouths are once again open, tongues pressed together. Eddie hauls himself against Steve, up and down, up and down, sliding his whole body along Steve\u2019s front. He\u2019s gasping,  oh oh oh oh, and his legs are shaking again, he\u2019s shaking all over.\u00a0\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Steve says, pulling his mouth off Eddie\u2019s and kissing over his cheek. Sliding his tongue down the line of Eddie\u2019s jaw. \u201cRelax, Eddie, it\u2019s okay\u2014 you\u2019re okay, we\u2019ll get you there.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe fixes his mouth onto Eddie\u2019s neck, right in the middle, and sucks hard. Eddie scrabbles across his shoulders but can\u2019t find a good grip; it feels like his fingers are tingling. Steve gently presses a thigh between Eddie\u2019s legs and Eddie takes what\u2019s on fucking offer. He latches on, desperate, and starts rocking.\nThe roll starts in his abdomen and works down, into his hips, his thighs. Back and forth, up and down\u2014 Eddie tries it fucking all. He gets so, so close; he\u2019s shaking again, or maybe still, but he\u2019s definitely shaking  more.  A strange buzzing starts between his ears. His dick is hard and he\u2019s fucking  wet  with it, wet because he\u2019s about to come but he can\u2019t quite  get there. \n\u201cSteve,\u201d he gasps. \u201cPlease, man, you\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to what,  man?\u201d  Steve says.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck off, Steve, come on,\u201d Eddie says, dragging himself across Steve\u2019s thigh, against his hips.\u00a0\nTheir bare chests scrape against each other. Eddie can feel Steve\u2019s nipples against his chest, feel the scratch of his chest hair. Every breath comes out as a moan. Eddie can hear himself but he can\u2019t  stop, and he doesn\u2019t really want to.\nHe feels wild, out of control, like he\u2019s about to shake into pieces. Liquify and then drip down Steve Harrington\u2019s thigh.  Fuck.\u00a0 \n\u201cCall me something sweeter than \u2018man\u2019 and I\u2019ll touch you,\u201d Steve bargains. He bites hard on Eddie\u2019s neck, then drags his tongue up in a long swipe. The spit dries cold against Eddie\u2019s burning skin and Eddie gasps.\u00a0\nSomething about Steve\u2019s tone\u2014 stern but teasing, mean but tender\u2014 makes Eddie lose his mind. It feels like a slap, it feels like a kiss. It feels like Eddie is about to fucking  die.\u00a0\nEddie licks his lips, fumbles for clarity. Tries to find something sweet to say. In the end, all he can say is  Steve. \nHe says it on a moan. Says it soft, says it with his heart in his mouth.\nSteve pulls away from his neck to stare at him. His eyes are dark and make Eddie\u2019s head spin.\n\u201cFucking strawberry milkshake,\u201d Steve says nonsensically, and Eddie can\u2019t ask him what he means because then Steve starts  touching him.\u00a0 \nSteve slips his hand down, cupping Eddie hard through his pants in the same moment Steve sucks Eddie\u2019s earlobe into his mouth. He fiddles with the silver stud with his tongue and scrubs the heel of his hand against Eddie\u2019s dick, the friction through his jeans almost hurting.\nEddie\u2019s knees start to shake and shake  hard.  It rattles his teeth. He pulls Steve close and works his hips, and it feels\u2014 it feels\u2014 it feels like finally scratching a rash. Eddie might be drooling but it doesn\u2019t matter because Steve keeps  touching him.\u00a0\nSteve is tonguing at his ear. Steve is pressing him against the wall. Steve is pulling Eddie\u2019s hair. Steve is digging in and  rubbing, over and over and over and\u2014\u00a0\n\n And\u2014\u00a0 \n\n\u201cComing, I\u2019m gonna, it\u2019s, oh fuck Steve\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s whole body locks up. His eyes roll back in his head. And then all at once he\u2019s shaking and thrashing because it just feels so  good, it\u2019s pulsing through his hips, his whole body throbbing. He humps up hard against Steve\u2019s hand. Steve presses strongly against him, unmoving, while he does. Eddie shudders his thanks, biting down on Steve\u2019s naked shoulder and drooling.\u00a0\nHis dick pulses, throbs\u2014 and the skin is so tight it\u2019s  squeezing\u2014 and come floods Eddie\u2019s jeans. Gets him wet.\u00a0\nEddie breathes against Steve\u2019s skin, which is slick from Eddie\u2019s mouth. He\u2019s still shaking and he can\u2019t make it stop. He pants, in and out, while Steve holds him up.\u00a0\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d Steve asks him. When Eddie can\u2019t find his tongue, Steve continues, \u201cthat looked pretty intense, Eds.\u201d\nEddie wants to say something\u2014 hell, he wants to fucking  shake Steve\u2019s hand, because he\u2019s never come that hard in his whole fucking life\u2014 but he can\u2019t. His throat goes thick and tight and he can\u2019t do it.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, okay,\u201d Steve says, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s responding to Eddie. Like Eddie actually did manage to say something, even though that isn\u2019t true. \u201cHere we go, dude, move your feet a little bit.\u201d\nSteve starts tugging him toward his bedroom door, gently but persistently. He hooks Eddie under his arms, leans Eddie\u2019s chest against his, keeps his thigh between Eddie\u2019s so that Eddie doesn\u2019t tip over.\u00a0\nWhich, like, is probably good\u2014 Eddie can\u2019t feel his feet. His knees bend and wobble like cooked spaghetti. There\u2019s a strange moment where his vision fades in and out, blurring around the edges, and then they\u2019re in Steve\u2019s room. It\u2019s a nightmare of blue and plaid. If Eddie was even five percent more in his body, he would give Steve shit. He will later.\u00a0\nIn this moment, giving Steve shit feels like an impossible task. An unachievable goal, because all he wants is for Steve to stroke down his back, pet his hair, kiss his face.\u00a0\nEddie feels fragile. Breakable. And still, somehow, turned on. He\u2019s heavy with the feeling, body turning to lead.\u00a0\nSteve tips him onto the bed and the sheets are worn down into softness, like Steve\u2019s had the same pair for a long time. Shamelessly, Eddie burrows into them, scrubbing his body across them like a bear rubbing against a tree. Or something.\nHe\u2019s still feeling weird. Obviously.\u00a0\n\u201cGet down here,\u201d Eddie says, the words coming out slurred, because Steve is just hovering at the side of the bed with his hands on his hips. There is a thoughtful frown on his face.\u00a0\nA couple fast blinks, like Eddie\u2019s startled him, and then Steve smiles.\nWhen Steve leans down, Eddie grapples his arms across Steve\u2019s bare shoulders and yanks. Steve collapses onto his chest with a startled  oof, and Eddie wheezes with Steve\u2019s weight. But having Steve on top of him brings Eddie back down into his body, just a little.\u00a0\nAbruptly, he realizes that Steve is still hard. Steve\u2019s not  doing  anything about it, isn\u2019t working his hips or sliding his hands over Eddie. Isn\u2019t pushing, isn\u2019t in any sort of rush. But Steve is hard and Eddie knows it, and suddenly Eddie is  desperate. \nHe\u2019s not even totally sure what he\u2019s desperate for, because nothing about\u2026 any of this has been expected. Nothing Steve has done was anything Eddie expected. Fuck, nothing  Eddie\u2019s  done was anything Eddie expected.\u00a0\nWho knew all it took was a good kiss from Steve Harrington to knock Eddie off balance? Who the fuck knew that Steve Harrington\u2019s tongue on his ear would make Eddie go belly-up, vulnerable and shaking and so fucking turned on he got  dizzy? Who fucking knew? Not Eddie. Certainly not fucking Eddie Munson, and isn\u2019t that a funny joke?\nEddie feels like he  should  have known. It\u2019s hysterical that he didn\u2019t. Eddie snickers into Steve\u2019s bare shoulder and squeezes Steve a little harder. He\u2019s too worldly to not have known; he\u2019s been too many places, done too many things with too many different types of people. How the fuck did Eddie not  know? \nHe feels stupid. He feels like a shook-up coke bottle, fizzing up until he pops. Steve twisted him off and he exploded, sticky and frothing, and now he\u2019s got to settle back down.\u00a0\nHe feels fucking  enlightened.\u00a0\n\u201cLemme blow you,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cCome on, Harrington, let me get you off.  Fuck, sweetheart, let me suck you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna say no?\u201d Steve asks, and Eddie can hear the way he\u2019s grinning. \u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d\n\u201cCan I\u2014 like, on the floor\u2014\u201d\nEddie\u2019s heart tumbles over itself, thudding loudly in his chest, and shit but he sounds fucking incoherent. He\u2019s panting, gasping even though Steve\u2019s not heavy on his chest.\u00a0\nBefore Eddie can say anything else\u2014 say something about Steve, on his back, hands in his own hair, Eddie on his knees in front of the bed, head between Steve\u2019s thighs\u2014 Steve is moving. He rolls off Eddie in a smooth rolling tumble, athletic and just\u2026 Eddie\u2019s not sure what to call it. It\u2019s almost like he poses, except that\u2019s not quite right. The word is too fake, too  cold, for what Steve does.\u00a0\nSteve lays back, bare chested and tan from the summer sun. He shines with sweat and the buttery lamp light. His stomach is relaxed, he\u2019s not flexing or faking, not trying to look more muscled than he is. He\u2019s just\u2026 on display, relaxed and playful, his knees crooked. Jeans still on.\u00a0\nDark lashes flutter at Eddie. Steve\u2019s lips are cherry red from kissing, and spread into a slick smile.\n Seduced,  Eddie thinks to himself, turning the word over in his mind with a strange, excited curiosity.  I\u2019m being seduced.\u00a0 \nHell, Steve\u2019s been seducing him this whole damn night. But it\u2019s more, somehow, watching Steve do it in the private safety of his bedroom. In the quiet comfort of his bed.\u00a0\nEddie pulls himself up until he\u2019s sitting. Steve doesn\u2019t look away.\nEddie tumbles onto the floor, hitting his knees hard. Steve doesn\u2019t look away.\nEddie wraps his hands around Steve\u2019s ankles and  tugs, pulling Steve to the edge of the bed. He throws Steve\u2019s calves over his shoulders. And still,  still,  Steve doesn\u2019t look away. He props himself up on his elbows and stares down at Eddie, eyes lidded low. Dark and playful but dangerous in a way that makes Eddie think of domesticated wolves.\u00a0\n What big teeth you have, Harrington, Eddie thinks, and then cackles to himself.\u00a0\nAbove him, Steve shakes his head and grins.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best laugh, man,\u201d Steve says, which startles Eddie for some reason.\u00a0\nPart of him thought Steve was going to say something like,  I\u2019m getting old up here, Munson, but of course Steve wouldn\u2019t. Steve\u2019s not the kind of guy to rush anyone into anything; not the kind of guy to make Eddie hurry up and blow him.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m taking your pants off,\u201d Eddie declares, because suddenly he can\u2019t wait another fucking moment. He needs to get his mouth around Steve now, now,  now. Needs that closeness, that vulnerability and trust from Steve. Needs to be the one to\u2026 like, fucking possess that trust. To hoard that closeness like a dragon hoarding gold.\u00a0\nHe needs Steve to keep looking at him.\n\u201cYeah, please,\u201d Steve responds, but Eddie is already attacking the button of Steve\u2019s jeans, already yanking the still-damp denim down Steve\u2019s thighs.\u00a0\nDimly, Eddie hears Steve huff a laugh but doesn\u2019t respond. He\u2019s too busy wrestling Steve\u2019s jeans off completely, flinging them over his shoulder and going for his underwear; they\u2019re black and tight, cupping Steve in a way that makes Eddie\u2019s mouth water.\u00a0\nSteve lifts his hips and Eddie hooks his fingers in the elastic and, just like that, Steve is naked. Naked and lounging, body lush and inviting. Well-earned muscle overlaid with a soft layer, like Steve has been drinking water and eating well. Healthy in a way that makes Eddie feel\u2026\u00a0\nGrateful, maybe. Wondrous.\nThose pitted scars on Steve\u2019s sides glimmer silver. Eddie wraps a hand around Steve\u2019s waist, covering them.\u00a0\nEddie meets Steve\u2019s dark eyes, watches Steve\u2019s lips part, and then lowers his head.\u00a0\nWhen he sucks the head of Steve\u2019s cock into his mouth, Steve goes boneless. His back bows down into the bed, elbows sliding out from under him. He grins up at the ceiling, smiling that lazy confident smile that Eddie likes so much. He doesn\u2019t get to see it often; these days, Steve seems to have a perpetual furrow between his eyebrows. Constant concern on his face.\nIt\u2019s nice, seeing it now.\u00a0\nEddie puts himself to work, inching his way down Steve\u2019s dick until it hits the back of his tongue. It\u2019s harder than he thought it would be, giving a blowjob, but in some ways it\u2019s easier, too.\u00a0\nA distant part of Eddie had been apprehensive of the taste, the smell. The feeling of a dick in his mouth. But he shouldn\u2019t have been. It\u2019s easy, doing this: Steve\u2019s skin is warm, and clean, and Eddie likes the stretch of his lips. The weight on his tongue.\u00a0\nIt does something funny to his head. Blanks him out like a VHS tape played too many times. Everything narrows down to the weight in his mouth and the soft, pleased noises Steve makes. Steve isn\u2019t loud but he\u2019s not quiet, either. He\u2019s just\u2026 genuine.\u00a0\nSteve moans when Eddie rubs his tongue down his dick, sighs when Eddie strokes over his stomach. One of Steve\u2019s hands creeps down and into Eddie\u2019s hair, holding firm and tight.\u00a0\nEddie hollows his cheeks and sucks, hard, and Steve\u2019s fingers tighten against his scalp until pain zings, electric, down Eddie\u2019s spine.\u00a0\nWhen Eddie moans, Steve does it again.\u00a0\nIt feels good enough that Eddie redoubles his efforts,  triples them, because Eddie\u2019s already come and he needs Steve to feel good, too. He wants Steve to shake and moan and feel the same way Eddie felt. Because otherwise it\u2019s not fair, otherwise Eddie hasn\u2019t done his job, and something about that almost makes him feel queasy.\u00a0\nCautiously, Steve starts to work his hips against Eddie\u2019s mouth. Eddie slides his hands under Steve\u2019s thighs and hoists him in, encouraging the movement.\u00a0\n\u201cBaby, fuck,\u201d Steve gasps.\nEddie moans. Spit drips down his chin. His lips are tingling with the friction of Steve\u2019s cock, the way it slides in and out. When Steve gives a particularly hard thrust, Eddie almost chokes. It should feel bad, should make him want to sputter and pull off of Steve\u2019s dick, but it doesn\u2019t. It  doesn\u2019t; instead, it makes Eddie gasp through his nose and moan. He shuffles forward until his chest is pressed flat against the mattress, his knees sliding half way under the bed.\nHe likes being down here, on the floor, looking up as Steve gasps and half-laughs his way through the blowjob. Steve is grinning, light and uncomplicated, his eyes on Eddie. His hand is still in Eddie\u2019s hair and gently guiding his head up and down.\u00a0\nEddie is surrounded, consumed, by Steve: Steve\u2019s legs across his shoulders, holding him down; Steve\u2019s dick in his mouth, heavy and warm; Steve\u2019s hand in his hair, pulling tight and strong.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s close and comforting, and Eddie fucking  burns with it. Each stroke of Steve against his tongue, each time Steve\u2019s hand clenches tighter in his hair, sends Eddie into dizzy, giddy spirals. He\u2019s panting around Steve\u2019s dick, feeling wet and sticky everywhere. Sweat in his armpits and behind his knees, come still slick around his own dick\u2014 which is hard again.\nImpossibly, Steve gets harder against his tongue, and another breathless laugh bursts out of Steve\u2019s chest. It\u2019s a light sound. Uncomplicated, like Steve is sometimes. Steve feels good, his body feels good, and so he\u2019s laughing. Smiling at Eddie.\u00a0\nFuck, but Eddie didn\u2019t know sex could be like this.\n\u201cGonna come, baby, fuck you\u2019re so good at this,\u201d Steve says, and pulls Eddie down by the hair.\nEddie gasps and chokes eagerly on Steve\u2019s dick. Next to his nose, Steve\u2019s thighs twitch and shake, his stomach flexing, and Eddie moans at the same time Steve does.\u00a0\n\u201cEddie, yeah, fuck\u2014 fuck, Eddie,  Eddie,\u201d Steve gasps, and Eddie sucks hard.\nHe bobs his head once, twice, and Steve\u2019s eyes roll back. He pulls Eddie in, heels shoving against Eddie\u2019s back, and then suddenly Eddie can taste him against his tongue. Hot and salty, a little slimy.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s gross. It\u2019s fucking  hot.\u00a0 \nOverwhelmed, Eddie sucks Steve harder, swallowing as much as he can and letting the rest drip down his chin.\u00a0\nGasping, and still half-laughing, Steve pulls Eddie off of his dick by the hair. Eddie goes with a strange noise\u2014 it\u2019s not a whine, except maybe it is, because it\u2019s high pitched and needy and Eddie wants so much to be back where he was. Surrounded by Steve, making Steve moan and giggle. Doing good work.\n\u201cThat was so fucking good, baby,\u201d Steve tells him. His bare stomach is heaving, in and out.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Eddie asks, and he sounds fucking destroyed. Like he just did ten rounds of combat and his hit points are low; all husky and desperate. \u201cYou liked it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve agrees. His eyes are dark and shining. Eddie can\u2019t look away from them. \u201cSeems like you did, too, babe.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt was alright,\u201d Eddie grins, shrugging.\u00a0\n\u201cJust alright?\u201d Steve asks.\nEddie gazes up at Steve, who\u2019s propped himself back up on his elbows, and lets himself beam. He smiles so wide his cheeks hurt.\u00a0\nSteve smiles back and shakes his head. \u201cYou are so\u2026\u201d Steve starts, but doesn\u2019t finish. Instead, Steve sits up, abs contracting and releasing effortlessly, and hunches over Eddie. His legs slide off Eddie\u2019s shoulders but don\u2019t leave Eddie completely; he tucks them around Eddie\u2019s waist instead, locking his ankles.\nEddie stares up at him, still kneeling by the bed, and licks his lips. Softly, Steve\u2019s hand comes down from Eddie\u2019s hair. He swipes his thumb across Eddie\u2019s chin, and the motion is embarrassingly slick. Steve\u2019s thumb digs in, hard, and Eddie feels himself gasp.\u00a0\nLike his open mouth is an invitation, Steve slides his thumb\u2014 now coated in come and spit\u2014 between Eddie\u2019s lips. Instinctively, thoughtlessly, Eddie licks it clean.\nIt tastes\u2026 fine. Not good, but not that bad, either.\u00a0\nThe taste isn\u2019t the point.\nThe point is Steve, Steve\u2019s thumb in his mouth, Steve leaning over him; and the point is Eddie, taking what Steve gives to him and wanting more. Always, always more.\u00a0\nCrashing and receding. Wanting and gorging and then growing hungry again.\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Steve says. His square jaw flexes. \u201cCome back up here.\u201d\nEddie stares at him, motionless, trying to process the words through the buzz in his ears. And then, all at once, Eddie throws himself up onto the bed, on top of Steve. Steve catches him with a barking laugh.\u00a0\nHe rolls Eddie onto the sheets, so quick and smooth it turns Eddie\u2019s head. Makes him feel like one of those struck-stupid cartoon characters. Big pink hearts whirling around him.\nHe used to glue himself in front of Uncle Wayne\u2019s tiny TV on Saturday mornings, hiding out from his parents back before he went to live with Wayne permanently. The pictures would glitch, cut in and out with bad signal, but he remembers the cartoons. A little cartoon bunny being kissed, and his heart leaping out from his chest. His cheeks glowing red, even though animals with fur can\u2019t blush.\u00a0\nWhen Steve presses him down and kisses him, Eddie feels just like that stupid fucking rabbit.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, doc,\u201d Eddie blurts against Steve\u2019s mouth. He can\u2019t help it.\u00a0\nSteve huffs, then sucks a kiss onto the base of Eddie\u2019s jaw. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a good way to respond to that,\u201d he tells Eddie. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a joke in there about  doc  and  cock rhyming, but I\u2019m not smart enough to find it.\u201d\nBefore Eddie can respond to  that\u2014  and Jesus, Harrington is right, if they could pin down that joke it would fucking  kill\u2014 before Eddie can say anything, Steve bites down hard on his neck. Like, so hard Eddie can feel the bruising start immediately.\u00a0\nJust like that, they\u2019re back at it: zero to ten to one-hundred miles per hour, Steve biting his way down his neck and across his collarbones. Tracking down to his nipples, and he fucking bites those, too; these sharp, tiny vampire bites that make Eddie thrust his chest up into Steve\u2019s mouth like a girl in a porno. Except he\u2019s not acting.\nShit,  shit, but he is really not acting.\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe you\u2019re hard again, Eds,\u201d Steve groans, Eddie\u2019s nipple still in his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s so fucking hot, baby.\u201d\nWhen Steve scrapes at it with his teeth, Eddie\u2019s legs kick out against the bed.\u00a0\n\u201cYou want me so bad,\u201d Steve says, and he\u2019s not teasing. He\u2019s not being mean. He sounds fucking baffled. \n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Eddie gasps. \u201cFucking\u2014 of course I do, Steve,  fuck.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd then Eddie can\u2019t talk anymore, because Steve is biting across his chest and he\u2019s biting  hard.  Leaving red marks that flush darker with every second that passes. It feels fucking  crazy, is what it feels like.\u00a0\nIt feels like Eddie\u2019s going out of his mind.\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t do anything but scrape his fingers down Steve\u2019s back. Eddie\u2019s knees are bent up, Steve laying between them, but his legs keep falling back down. His feet keep sliding because Eddie keeps trying to thrust his hips into Steve.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe notes all this in a vague, passive sort of way. It doesn\u2019t really matter. Nothing matters except for Steve Harrington touching him. Steve biting hard on his nipples, hands clawing down Eddie\u2019s sides. Leaving red marks everywhere. Red bruises and scrapes that Eddie is going to pinch and touch, alone in his bedroom, remembering this. Getting off to the memory.\u00a0\nSteve bites hard at the soft skin below his belly button and Eddie almost, like, yells. Partly because he\u2019s shocked and partly because it feels\u2026 it  feels.\u00a0 \nEddie can\u2019t tell if it feels good or bad, but he knows he wants more of it. More, more, more of it always.\u00a0\nSteve puts his hands on Eddie\u2019s jeans, rubbing over Eddie\u2019s cock and saying: \u201cI\u2019m gonna take your pants off, Eds, can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve still got them on\u2014\u201d\nAnd Eddie is responding: \u201cFuck off, take them off, take them  off, please, Steve I need you to\u2014\u201d\nJust like that, Steve is popping the button and yanking his jeans down. They get stuck on Eddie\u2019s bare feet for a moment but Steve gives a hard tug and they disappear onto Steve\u2019s floor. There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, where Steve draws back to stare at him with dark eyes, and then Steve reaches out. He tucks one finger into the elastic of Eddie\u2019s underwear and pulls back.\u00a0\nWhen he lets go, the elastic  snaps  back onto Eddie\u2019s skin. It\u2019s a sharp and bright feeling, and Eddie\u2019s dick throbs with it. Gets wetter than it already is\u2014 he\u2019s still sloppy from his first orgasm, but now he\u2019s, like, fucking soaked. It\u2019s all leaked through his underwear and he can  see  it, the white of his come and the big damp patch.\u00a0\nSteve can see it, too.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a mess,\u201d Steve says, and then he keeps going, like he can\u2019t help it. \u201cFuck, look at you, Eddie. Shit. You\u2019re all wet. You\u2019re fucking  soaking, baby.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie gasps, and then moans, and then gasps again because fuck, was that him? But he can\u2019t think about it too hard because his dick is still pulsing, and the pulsing is  good.  His dick has that too-tight feeling, familiar, and Eddie knows that he could fuck up into the thin air and his underwear and feel even better. Maybe even come like that. He\u2019s always been a little bit of a hair-trigger, but he\u2019s never minded. Not when it feels like  this.\u00a0 \nAnd he can go again, over and over, has spent whole nights working himself raw. Thrusting into his hand. Against his bed. The arm of the couch, a time or two. Just because he could. There were nights where he\u2019d come into the sheets and then into a sock and then all over his belly.\u00a0\n\u201cSometime soon you\u2019re going to fuck me,\u201d Steve says, and Eddie makes a keening noise that sounds a little bit like  yeah.  \u201cYou\u2019re gonna take all those rings off and fuck me with your fingers, get me ready, and then you\u2019re gonna fuck me with  this.\u201d And Steve clenches his hand around Eddie\u2019s cock, a little mean, but so good.\n\u201cYou want me to fuck you, sweetheart?\u201d Eddie says, mostly because he wants Steve to keep talking. He tries to sound suave, put together, but his voice cracks and breaks and he\u2019s mostly gasping for air. He sounds like he\u2019s running. His hips are twisting against Steve\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Steve groans, and then he\u2019s removing his hand and yanking Eddie\u2019s underwear down, throwing them off. \u201cI know that\u2019s not your thing, but I figure we can compromise.\u201d He bends down and sucks a bruise into the crease between Eddie\u2019s thigh and his dick, and Eddie\u2019s vision whites out before he can ask Steve what the fuck he means by  that.\u00a0 \n\u201cPlease, Steve,\u201d Eddie says again, because he can\u2019t say anything else.\u00a0\n\u201cYou like that?\u201d Steve asks, and Eddie gasps hard.\u00a0\nHe might not even need Steve to touch him, not if he keeps talking like this. Eddie\u2019s whole body rolls, up against Steve and then down against the sheets, and it\u2019s like his body is a live-wire. There\u2019s hardly any friction against his dick but he\u2019s rocking like he\u2019s fucking into something anyway and it feels fucking  amazing.\n\u201cYou like when I talk to you, Eds?\u201d But it\u2019s not really a question. Steve pinches at Eddie\u2019s thighs, viciously hard, leaving more bruises. It makes Eddie moan, and again it\u2019s high pitched but it\u2019s not embarrassing, because Steve so clearly likes it.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie says, voice shaking. \u201cYeah, sweetheart, I like when you talk to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Steve murmurs. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s good, \u2018cause I like to talk.\u201d He punctuates the sentence with a sharp bite, right next to the base of Eddie\u2019s cock. That place where the skin isn\u2019t quite stomach but isn\u2019t quite anything else.\u00a0\n\u201cGot a question for you,\u201d Steve continues. \u201cIt\u2019s been keeping me up at night, let me tell you.\u201d\n\u201cShoot,\u201d Eddie says, fisting one hand in Steve\u2019s hair and grabbing tight to the pillow beneath his own head with the other.\u00a0\n\u201cYou like blowjobs, Eds?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie sputters. \u201cOf course I like blowjobs\u2014\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t get to say anything else. He chokes on his own tongue because Steve puts his mouth on his dick, a long smooth motion that takes him almost all the way down. Eddie grasps at the pillow, twisting his fingers into the pillowcase and pulling. Without his permission, his body thrashes, like he\u2019s trying to get away even though that\u2019s the last thing he wants.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOh, shit, Steve,  honey, fuck\u2014\u201d\nSteve works his tongue. Sucks at the head. Eddie feels it when he presses against the slit of his dick, can feel Steve\u2019s teeth lightly catch against the crown. His fingers clench, hard, in Steve\u2019s hair.\nAn odd jerking motion, Steve moving his head back slightly, and then Steve grabs Eddie\u2019s hand and removes it from his hair.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Eddie gasps, because shit,  not everyone likes their hair pulled, Munson, and you just pulled it really fucking hard. \u201cSorry, Steve.\u201d\u00a0\nThe only response Eddie gets is a peaceable hum, which vibrates up his dick and through his stomach. It makes Eddie\u2019s legs spasm.\nFrom there, everything builds up fast, faster than Eddie can keep track of, never mind control. Steve slides his mouth up, then down, and Eddie writhes. Steve presses him down hard by his hips, that thick strength in his arms holding Eddie  tight, and Eddie revels in it. He bucks and thrusts just so he can feel Steve hold him down.\u00a0\nAll in all, it\u2019s only a minute, maybe two, before Eddie gets close again. Before he\u2019s whining and gasping and repeating Steve\u2019s name. His dick is throbbing, the skin too tight and too small, and Eddie can feel each pulse. When Steve pulls back and puts his mouth on Eddie\u2019s balls instead, Eddie fucking\u2026 there\u2019s a noise Eddie makes, and he can hear it from himself, but it\u2019s so high and strange that he can\u2019t put a word to it.\u00a0\n\u201cGonna come, Steve, I\u2019m\u2014 again\u2014\u201d\nIt\u2019s just that it feels so good, it feels so  good, and Steve Harrington is sucking him off, Steve Harrington is playing with his fucking balls and before Eddie knows it he\u2019s trying to cross his legs, trying to keep Steve where he is. He thrashes hard against the bed and buries his hands in his own hair, pulling hard. Dimly, he hears something that\u2019s almost a laugh.\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Eddie\u2019s eyes cross and his mouth drops open, his stomach flexing, and then that  tense  and  release  happens. Everything pulls tight and then lets go in pulsing, orgasmic waves, and before he knows it Eddie is coming wet and hot across Steve\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, fuck, oh  shit,\u201d Eddie moans, rocking himself back and forth.\nSteve puts his mouth back on Eddie\u2019s cock and sucks down the last few spurts, soothing him.\nIn the aftermath, Eddie\u2019s body shakes again, legs trembling and stomach heaving. Steve swipes his hand over his face, wiping off Eddie's come, then pulls himself up and lays down. He's a heavy weight that covers Eddie completely. Eddie hauls him closer, wrapping arms around Steve\u2019s waist and twining their legs together.\nThey lay there and breathe, fast at first but then slower, slower. Steve\u2019s breath against Eddie\u2019s neck is calming. Eddie trails his hands up Steve\u2019s back, over those smooth scars of his, and then brushes them back down.\nEddie closes his eyes and lets himself lose track of time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey glide in and out of sleep, stumble into dreams and then back out of them. Neither of them really passes out, or anything, but for a long stretch of time they lay there together, wrapped around each other like yarn in a bracelet.\u00a0\nAfter what might be hours and what might only be forty-five minutes, Steve slides off of Eddie. He worms close again immediately, though, so Eddie can\u2019t feel too bad about it. He lifts his arm so Steve can press into his side, nose tucked into Eddie\u2019s neck, and then settles it across Steve\u2019s shoulders.\nFrom where they\u2019re laying, Eddie can see out of Steve's window. The pool is bright and glowing against the night sky, an eerie blue, and in that strange glow he makes out their shirts and shoes, still crumpled on the pool deck. If he squints, Eddie can make out the shape of his black bandana.\nHe stares at it for a moment before he loses it. Eddie cackles, so hard he winds up snorting, and Steve jolts out of his weird almost-meditation.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Steve says, taken aback, and his tone is like,  why the fuck are you doing this. Steve gets that tone every time someone startles him, like he\u2019s trying to save face. He\u2019s seen Steve do it with the kids, with Robin, with Nancy. And now, with him.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s endearing.\nEddie snickers harder, shoulders shaking, and buries his mouth in the dip between Steve\u2019s pecs. \u201cFalse advertising.\u201d\n\u201cExplain,\u201d Steve drawls.\nAnd then Eddie\u2019s not laughing anymore.\n\u201cUh,\u201d he says.\nEddie hesitates, because how can he explain this? Explain flagging to Steve, and why he does it, and what it means? How can he explain to Steve that, for years, Eddie has made himself come to the  idea  of pain, to skin pink and hot and stinging? Rubbed himself until his boxers were wet to the image of teary eyes, to bruises on necks and wrists and hips, and never put together that he wants the pain to be  his?  How can he explain the misinterpretation of his own desire?\nBriefly, for a half of a half second, Eddie tries to make the fantasy\u2014 which has always been vague, always filled with faceless men\u2014 specific and clear. Solidifies the image in his mind until it\u2019s  Steve.\u00a0 \nHe imagines making Steve hurt. Imagines making Steve hurt enough tears well up in his eyes, making Steve\u2019s skin burn hot because Eddie\u2019s been hitting him. Giving Steve bruises, the kind that  ache.\u00a0 \nThe idea makes Eddie want to throw up. It makes him want to apologize and bury himself in Steve\u2019s neck. He\u2019s got the absurd urge to run his hands over Steve\u2019s body, check his flanks and his throat, like maybe Eddie\u2019s thoughts will have re-opened old wounds.\u00a0\nEddie had nightmares about those marks on Steve\u2019s body. He still does, sometimes.\u00a0\n Sado top, Eddie thinks to himself, queasy and baffled at his own audacity. He forces himself not to tremble because Steve is fine. Steve is fine.\u00a0\nEddie\u2019s been flagging as a sado top. What a fucking joke.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, hey, woah,\u201d Steve says, his voice close and gentle.\u00a0Eddie crashes back into his body, back into the present moment.\u00a0\nSteve is still holding him; their skin is still slick with sweat and come and spit. It\u2019s starting to get sticky. Eddie\u2019s throat is gloriously sore and he\u2019s got bruises on his thighs that throb so  sweetly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re alright, Eds, we\u2019re alright,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cShit, honey, you don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to. Quit making that face, alright? You\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart.\u201d\nAnd then Eddie thinks\u2014 why the fuck not? They\u2019ve got time. He\u2019s naked and still a little high and, before or above all that, he trusts Steve. Trusts him with his life. Trusts him at his back when there\u2019s monsters swarming and the sky is lit up blue and red. He can fucking trust Steve with this. This is nothing; small fish. A tiny secret that they\u2019ll laugh at together.\n\u201cSo, alright, this needs context,\u201d Eddie starts, and his voice shakes at the beginning but is sturdy by the end. He puts on his dungeon master voice; he needs the soothing shield of performance. \u201cYou know how I keep a black hanky in my back pocket\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, the gay bandanas or whatever,\u201d Steve says.\nEddie is so baffled he stops talking.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude, yours seemed pretty accurate.\u201d Beneath his cheek, Steve shrugs. All casual.\nBizarrely, Eddie feels\u2026 offended. Hurt. Even though two hours ago he wouldn\u2019t have felt either of those things.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, the bottom part was maybe a surprise, but it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just sex, you know? I wasn\u2019t totally sure about the masochism, but\u2026 I think we did pretty well for our first time.\u201d\nEddie pauses. His brow furrows. He tries to make sense of what Steve is saying, but he can\u2019t quite make his thoughts link up in his head.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He asks.\n\u201cYeah, man, Robin explained it to me,\u201d Steve says, and suddenly everything starts to make more sense. \u201cLeft pocket means bottom, black hanky is for S&amp;M.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Steve, the  right  pocket means bottom,\u201d Eddie corrects, feeling lightheaded. \u201cMine means I top.\u201d And that he thought he was a sadist, though maybe he\u2019s going to get out of explaining  that mental mixup. If he\u2019s very, very lucky.\nSteve was half-wrong, because Eddie wants to top Steve with a desperation that\u2019s bordering on pathetic, but Steve was half-right, too. Because Eddie loves the bruises throbbing on his thighs, the bite marks stinging on his neck and chest. And he  hates  the idea of hurting Steve.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOh, cool,\u201d Steve says, continuing the conversation, and Eddie forces himself to focus.\u00a0\nSteve relaxes contentedly against the sheets, like none of this is a big deal to him. \u201cI\u2019ve never, like, bottomed or whatever, but it seems fun. It was hot talking about it earlier.\u201d\u00a0\nMaybe it  isn\u2019t a big deal. How the fuck would Eddie know?\nEddie\u2019s always known Steve has more experience with sex than he does, experience enough to treat it with casual appreciation. Like sex is just something fun that Steve does with other people, or with himself. Special, sure, sometimes, but nothing scary. Nothing that Steve hides from or talks around or avoids. Nothing  shameful.\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s enthralling. The easy confidence Steve has slides through Steve and into Eddie, and Eddie tries to absorb it.\u00a0\nA cracking yawn half-breaks Steve\u2019s jaw, then, and Eddie glances at the clock. Almost three, and he has to leave early. Uncle Wayne\u2019s recruited him into helping start a garden; two weeks ago, Uncle Wayne had shown up with a raised plant bed and a bunch of seed packets. It\u2019s a little late for it, they\u2019re already a week into June, but it\u2019s not  impossible to start a garden this time of year. Just harder.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should sleep, sweetheart,\u201d Eddie says, and the pet name drops out of his mouth as easily as anything.\u00a0\nMaybe it should be awkward, but it\u2019s not. Steve  likes him: kissed him in front of all his friends, pulled him into his lap, laid with him on the floor face to face with their toes pressed together.\u00a0\nSteve's been, just... really good to him. Genuinely good, in a way that is vulnerable and genuine and patient.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Eddie sighs, overwhelmed and touched.\nFor the first time, Steve\u2019s cheeks flush and Eddie stares, awed.\u00a0\nSteve clears his throat and looks at Eddie in a way that\u2019s\u2026 not shy. Just cautious, maybe.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, by the way,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Eddie asks, baffled, because Steve wouldn\u2019t thank Eddie for sex or orgasms or whatever.\u00a0\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Steve trails off. He licks his lips and then twists. Leans forward until their mouths are pressed together, close-lipped and soft. \u201cFor not laughing at me. For being so sweet.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie pulls back a little, his heart feeling too big for his chest. Like it\u2019s about to burst out and burrow under Steve\u2019s skin, so Steve can keep it forever. \u201cWhy would I laugh at you?\u201d\nSteve hesitates, then shrugs. Eddie can feel it, the rise and fall of his shoulders from where he\u2019s tucked against Eddie\u2019s side. He keeps his eyes on Steve\u2019s face, careful, because something here is fragile. Something about  Steve is fragile, suddenly.\u00a0\nIn the blue nighttime, Steve\u2019s eyes are big and boundlessly dark. Eddie can\u2019t look away from him, from the sudden sheen on them. He reaches out and pulls Steve in hard, pressing their naked bodies together like maybe they could merge if he pulls hard enough.\u00a0\nIt would be nice to share a body with Steve. To feel him breathing, to feel his heart beating, and to know that he\u2019s safe in a visceral, bloody way.\nThat\u2019s a freak thought. The kind normal people probably don\u2019t have.\u00a0\nEddie lets himself think it anyway.\u00a0\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Steve finally says. \u201cSorry, I know you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNever,\u201d Eddie promises. \u201cAlright, Steve? Even if you, I don\u2019t know, ask the stupidest questions ever. I\u2019m not gonna laugh at you for, like,  expressing yourself.\u201d\u00a0\nThe other words are too big to say, right now, even if Eddie thinks he might mean them, so instead he finishes with: \u201cI like you a lot, sweetheart.\u201d\nSteve beams at him, big and shiny, like maybe he heard the other thing Eddie didn\u2019t say.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Steve tells him.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie grins, nuzzling into Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cYou faked weed virginity for me, man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBefore Eddie leaves, he shakes Steve awake. When Steve rolls over onto his back, eyes blinking open sleepily, Eddie pounces on top of him. Kisses him stupid. Kisses him over and over, with lips and tongue, until Steve laughs and pulls him down.\u00a0\nThey roll around between the sheets for a while, Steve still naked and Eddie fully-dressed.\u00a0\nEddie had crept downstairs in just his jeans twenty minutes ago, nervous because he is currently in possession of a fuckoff-amount of hickies and scratches. His jeans ride low and there are some incriminating finger-shaped bruises on his hips. But his shirt had still been out by the pool, along with his shoes and bandana and everything that had been in his pockets.\u00a0\nOnly Argyle was sleeping in the living room, everyone else bunked down in the many guest rooms at casa Harrington, so.\u00a0\nIt could have been worse.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie laughs into Steve\u2019s mouth. He pulls back but can\u2019t find the determination to break the kiss. He dives back, sliding his tongue between Steve\u2019s lips again.\u00a0\nSteve sucks on it. Kisses him and kisses him and kisses him.\n\u201cYou leaving?\u201d Steve murmurs, their lips still mashed together. Eddie can feel them against his skin: the open vowels of the word  you,  the lick of Steve\u2019s tongue on the first syllable of  leaving.\u00a0 \n\u201cFuck, never,\u201d Eddie blurts, and Steve laughs. Eddie huffs and shakes his head at himself, feeling young and giddy and stupid. \u201cBut yeah. Uncle Wayne\u2019s decided he wants to start a fucking garden, for whatever reason.\u201d\n\u201cA garden?\u201d Steve asks, pulling away with his eyebrows raised. His lips are red and slick. The sun is rising, coming in through the window in shades of gold, the new day turning Steve into something unreal. A Roman statue, or something; he has the nose for it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a crazy old man,\u201d Eddie dismisses. \u201cBut yeah. I have to go.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLemme walk you out,\u201d Steve says, pushing Eddie to the side and climbing out of bed.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s ass-naked, the span of his back broad, scars on display. His hair is greasy with sweat. He\u2019s got dark hair up his shins and thighs, spanning his crotch and belly. Eddie didn\u2019t get a good look at him last night, not really: it had been too dark by then.\u00a0\n\u201cShit, Steve,\u201d Eddie groans. \u201cPut some clothes on, you look too fuckin\u2019 good right now.\u201d\nTurning and looking over his shoulder, Steve grins. Raises his eyebrows. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI wanna lick you everywhere,\u201d Eddie says, and briefly debates just throwing all his clothes off again and fucking Steve on the floor. But then he glimpses the alarm clock and sees the time\u2014 8:20, fuck\u2014 and curses. \u201cBut I can\u2019t, fuck, damn this garden all the way to hell.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he growing?\u201d Steve asks, casually throwing on a sweatshirt and some tiny fucking green shorts that make Eddie want to push Steve down and climb on top of him. Maybe get Steve to pull his hair again.\n\u201cEds?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what? Sorry,\u201d Eddie responds. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just like, tomatoes. Nothing crazy. Come here so I can kiss you.\u201d\u00a0\nLaughing, Steve comes and wraps his arms around Eddie. His hands slide down Eddie\u2019s spine and tuck into his back pockets. Steve pulls him in by the ass and then they\u2019re kissing more. He isn\u2019t sure which one of them starts it, but after a moment they\u2019re swaying together, side to side, and breathing through their noses. Still kissing.\nEddie pulls away to cup Steve\u2019s jaw. Steve lets him do it, lets Eddie move his head. Scrape his fingers over Steve\u2019s stubble.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, I do not want to leave!\u201d Eddie explodes.\u00a0\nSteve tosses his head back and cackles.\nHe leaves anyway, of course, because Eddie\u2019s not a petulant child. He\u2019ll go, eat breakfast with Uncle Wayne and then help him plant his old-man garden. And then he\u2019ll come back, and Steve will cook them dinner, and they\u2019ll listen to records. Kiss on the couch. Maybe fuck on the couch.\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d Eddie presses.\nThey\u2019re standing in Steve's long driveway, the house behind them silent and sleeping. In the grass, crickets are chirping, coming awake as the sun rises.\u00a0\nGently, Steve steps forward and presses Eddie into the van. His back is against the driver\u2019s door, the handle digging into his spine.\u00a0\n\u201cPromise,\u201d Steve says.\nAnd, of course, then they have to kiss again.\nThey make out against the van for a while because Eddie feels like he\u2019ll just\u2026 melt and fall apart and  die  if he needs to leave Steve. Even just for half a day. Steve\u2019s hands find Eddie\u2019s hips again, holding him tight, pressing on the bruises already there. It makes Eddie gasp and giggle. He throws his head back, disconnecting their lips, and immediately Steve\u2019s mouth travels to his ear. Latches on.\u00a0\n\u201cNot fair, Harrington,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cOh, shit, not fair.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGet outta here, Munson,\u201d Steve tells him, biting a kiss onto his lips one more time before stepping back.\u00a0\nEddie pouts at him, even though Steve is right. The sun keeps creeping higher into the sky and Uncle Wayne has always been an early riser. \u201cKicking me out?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSooner you leave, the sooner you come back,\u201d Steve declares. His hands slip off of Eddie\u2019s waist. \u201cGo on, kid. Scram.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m older than you by two years,\u201d Eddie reminds him.  \u201cKid.\u201d \nSteve just grins at him, toothy and cheerful, and suddenly he looks younger. His hair is flopping into his eyes, the lines between his brow relaxed. \u201cI know, baby. It\u2019s sexy of you.\u201d\n\u201cTo be older?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStop  stalling, Edward Munson.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Edwin, actually,\u201d Eddie corrects.\nMouth dropping open, Steve stares at him for a second before he laughs. His head tips back, his throat exposed and long and golden. \u201cIs it really?\u201d\n\u201cReally, really,\u201d Eddie confirms.\u00a0\n\u201cNow I'm stalling,\u201d Steve sighs.\nEddie\u2019s mouth quirks without his permission. Automatically, he grabs a strand of his hair and pulls it across his face. Chews the end shyly.\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d he tells Steve, because they  are stalling, and any longer Eddie is going to get into trouble.\nUncle Wayne\u2019s really been cracking down lately, which Eddie gets, and is sometimes even grateful for.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not grateful for it  today,  shit.\u00a0\u00a0\nBehind them, the front door bangs open, shattering the morning quiet and the soft moment.\u00a0\nEddie leans his head back against his van and groans.\n\u201cHey! You leaving?\u201d Robin hollers down to them from Steve\u2019s front door, arms folded across her chest.\n\u201cYeah, Buckley!\u201d Eddie hollers back, and Steve winces. Eddie frowns at him apologetically but Steve just flaps his hands dismissively, taking a couple large steps back.\nGrumpily, Eddie finally turns and unlocks the door to the van, sliding in behind the wheel.\u00a0\nWhen Eddie rolls down the window to say goodbye to Steve for real, Steve is shaking his head and sighing. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna give me so much shit.\u201d\n\u201cWheeler, too,\u201d Eddie agrees.\n\u201cFuck, and Jonathan,\u201d Steve groans. \u201cI\u2019ll probably deserve it though.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie frowns. Because giving friends shit is fine, they all do it all the time, but something about the way Steve just said Jonathan\u2019s name\u2026 there was real dread, there. Just for a moment. And Eddie doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s just Steve, being self-deprecating like he sometimes is, or if there\u2019s really something to be worried about. Eddie doesn\u2019t know Jonathan Byers very well, after all.\n\u201cYou need me and I\u2019m here, sweetheart,\u201d Eddie says, because it\u2019s the only thing he  can say. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s true enough.\u00a0\nSteve stares at him for a moment and then leans in through the window. \u201cI know, Eds,\u201d Steve tells him. He presses a sweet kiss to Eddie\u2019s mouth and Eddie sighs helplessly.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cJust as long as you know.\u201d\u00a0\nFinally, Steve backs up, raising a hand and watching as Eddie pulls out. As he reverses, Eddie catches a glimpse of Robin leaping off the front porch and dashing over to Steve, arms waving, as Nancy and Jonathan Byers appear in the door behind her.\u00a0\nAll of them are grinning, even Steve.\n Especially Steve.\u00a0\nEddie cackles, tension dissolving into something cheerful and bright, and then flicks his stereo. There\u2019s a tape already in:  Kiss,  and immediately  I Was Made For Lovin\u2019 You comes blaring through his speakers.\u00a0\nTossing his head back, Eddie sings along and thinks about Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUncle Wayne is already awake when Eddie gets back, because of course he is. Eddie loves Uncle Wayne with his whole heart, is immeasurably grateful to the man, but fuck if Uncle Wayne doesn\u2019t  piss him off sometimes. Shit, but Eddie can never sneak anything past him.\u00a0\nEddie sits in the dirt driveway and drums his fingers against the wheel. Okay. Fine. Okay, he\u2019s just going to have to go in and brazen it out. There\u2019s nothing else for it.\nBesides, Uncle Wayne sat Eddie down when he was sixteen and, in the most awkward display of emotional competency Eddie has  ever  seen, told Eddie:  look, it\u2019s fine. You being the way you are. Alright? You don\u2019t have to keep sneaking that boy through your window.\u00a0 \nEddie hadn\u2019t even been sneaking him in for sex, was the thing. He\u2019d already started selling, and the guy had wanted ket for a party.\nBut Eddie hadn\u2019t corrected Uncle Wayne, because Uncle Wayne thinking he was a queer was actually better than what he really was, which was a drug dealer. And maybe he was kinda queer. Eddie at sixteen hadn\u2019t exactly been decided yet.\u00a0\nUncle Wayne found out about the drug dealing three months later anyway, and hadn\u2019t  that been a hell of a fight.\nAnd now here Eddie is, twenty years old with hickies down his neck and no way to hide them.\u00a0\n\u201cAw, fuck,\u201d Eddie sighs, and then climbs out of the van.\u00a0\nThe door slams behind him and he crashes up the trailer steps, lets himself in the door. Uncle Wayne is sitting on the couch, bowl of cereal in hand and one of his many mugs on the coffee table. He\u2019s watching the news.\nThey stare at each other for a minute, Uncle Wayne calm and unmoving, Eddie simultaneously frozen in place and vibrating out of his skin.\u00a0\n\u201cMilk\u2019s already out, if you want cereal,\u201d Uncle Wayne says, and just like that he can move again.\u00a0\nEddie rustles through the cabinets to find his Cheerios. He pours himself a bowl, studiously avoiding eye contact with Uncle Wayne. He thinks maybe he\u2019s about to chew right through his bottom lip.\u00a0\n\u201cSit down, boy, I\u2019m not gonna bite,\u201d Uncle Wayne tells him.\nEddie sits.\nHe clambers up next to Uncle Wayne on the couch, pretzeled and twisted so that he can hide his face in his knees if he needs to. He tries to focus on the news, on his cereal, but he keeps glancing at Uncle Wayne out of the corner of his eye.\n\u201cThought you were going to that Harrington kid\u2019s house,\u201d Uncle Wayne says after a while.\nA half-hysterical laugh bursts out of Eddie. \u201cI did,\u201d he cackles, and then shoves a spoon full of cereal into his mouth. He sort of chokes on it, but it\u2019s better than letting himself talk.\u00a0\n\u201cBig party?\u201d Uncle Wayne asks.\nWhen Eddie glances over at him, his brow is furrowed, the deep and strong lines of his face plain in the sunlight.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cNo, there were only five of us. Six including me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d Uncle Wayne says.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s so hot in the trailer, the sun beating in through the windows. It must be hot, because that\u2019s the only reason Eddie\u2019s cheeks are burning. Why his whole body feels like it\u2019s on fire with embarrassment. It\u2019s hot in the trailer, and if Uncle Wayne asks, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll say.\u00a0\nHe focuses on his cereal. He shovels it down, milk dripping from the corner of his mouth. Eddie swipes it away with the back of his hand and orders himself, frantically:  do not think about coming on Steve\u2019s face.\u00a0 \n\u201cI know you\u2019re grown, kid, so you don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d Uncle Wayne says, and the sentence is so out of left-field Eddie turns to look at him. Uncle Wayne\u2019s eyes are twinkling, the pale blue suddenly bright, suddenly playful. He looks like he did years ago, when he still swung Eddie around on his shoulders. Still chased him around in the yard.\nUncle Wayne is trying to hide his smile behind his coffee mug but it\u2019s not working.\u00a0\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Eddie says warily.\u00a0\n\u201cWho gave you all that?\u201d Uncle Wayne asks, gesturing at Eddie with his mug. His eyes track down Eddie\u2019s neck, linger on his dirty shirt, then come back to his neck. \u201cYou look like you lost a fight with an octopus.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie opens his mouth. Shuts it. Sticks another spoonful of cereal in it, just to buy time.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d Uncle Wayne says, his gruff voice gentle. \u201cBut\u2026 we used to tell each other things. You remember that?\u201d\u00a0\nAnd Eddie does remember. He remembers being eight, ten, twelve, and running up to Uncle Wayne every Christmas. Babbling his ear off. Biking down to the trailer with a baseball glove and a stack of books, pestering Uncle Wayne on his day off. Forcing Uncle Wayne to let him help with cars, with the A/C unit, with the squeaky door. The two of them talking and talking and talking.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen Eddie moved in permanently at thirteen years old, it seemed like divine intervention. A blessing. The best thing that ever happened to him.\nWhen did he start taking Uncle Wayne for granted?\n\u201cHey now, kid, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Uncle Wayne tells him, and Eddie quickly scrubs a hand across his cheek. It comes away wet, because he\u2019s crying.\nShit, he\u2019s always been such a crybaby.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Eddie blusters. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m crying.\u201d\nUncle Wayne starts, \u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2014\u201d\nBut Eddie cuts him off. \u201cI\u2019ve just been, like, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been such a piece of shit to you. And don\u2019t say I haven\u2019t been, okay, I know I have been\u2014 failing classes and not taking anything seriously and  selling drugs to minors  out of  your home, and you could\u2019ve gotten in so much trouble for that, but you\u2014\u201d\nEddie stops himself. He takes deep breaths, winding himself down, and scrubs his face again.\u00a0\n\u201cJust. Thanks,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cThank you for\u2026 keeping me. Even though I made it really hard.\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Uncle Wayne tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re my kid, Eddie. I don\u2019t tell you that enough, but you are. You\u2019re my boy, alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, alright,\u201d Eddie sniffs. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nThey sit in silence for a while. They eat their cereal.\nEddie chases the last three pieces around his bowl with his spoon, watching them spin through the milk. He scrubs his cheek against his shoulder, wiping off the last of his tears, and glances at Uncle Wayne again.\u00a0\nHe clears his throat. Smacks his lips. Reminds himself that he used to tell Uncle Wayne everything, and besides, Uncle Wayne told him it was fine years and years ago. This is no big deal.\n\u201cSo, you know. Uh.\u201d Eddie hesitates and then turns, fully, so that he\u2019s facing Uncle Wayne. He crosses his legs and sets his cereal bowl down.\u00a0\nUncle Wayne sets his mug down, turns to look at him. He\u2019s got that patient look on his face, the same one he wore when Eddie was nine and explaining DnD to him.\u00a0\n\u201cSteve Harrington,\u201d Eddie blurts.\nUncle Wayne blinks at him. He frowns. Scrubs a hand across his chin and blinks more.\n\u201cSteve Harrington,\u201d Uncle Wayne repeats. \u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0\nEddie fidgets. \u201cYou know him?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Course I know him,\u201d Uncle Wayne responds, still frowning. \u201cKnow his daddy, too.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie says, then hesitates.\u00a0\nUncle Wayne peers at him, his pale eyes piercing Eddie and holding him in place. \u201cHe good to you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he is,\u201d he says, because of course Steve is.\nDespite himself, Eddie flushes. It\u2019s embarrassing, how quickly his response came. His cheeks burn red and he knows it, but he can\u2019t keep it from happening. All he can do is think of Steve.\nSteve and his gentle, strong hands. His broad shoulders, his furrowed brow. The firm set to his mouth that\u2019s always there, even though he\u2019s quick to smile. The kindness that pours out of Steve, like he\u2019s so full of it it just spills out of him. The way he stands in front of Eddie, in front of the kids and Robin and Nancy, every time danger comes knocking. Comes howling at them with teeth.\u00a0\nHe thinks of Steve, blood down his chin, gaping wounds in his side. Steve wearing his vest. Steve holding him by the waist in the pool.\u00a0\nSteve, vulnerable in the dark, blushing when Eddie calls him  honey,  calls him  sweetheart.  The incredulous, honest way he\u2019d looked at Eddie, surrounded by friends in his living room, and said  don\u2019t you know? \n\u201cHe\u2019s really good to me, Uncle Wayne,\u201d Eddie promises. He ducks his head and grins. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m sweet. How fuckin\u2019 weird is that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou are sweet,\u201d Uncle Wayne tells him, his eyes soft. \u201cI\u2019m glad that boy knows it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s so\u2026 like, it\u2019s crazy, because he\u2019s  Steve, but he\u2019s so\u2026\u201d But Eddie can\u2019t figure out what he wants to say. Something about Steve being a jock, maybe. Something about how Steve acted three years ago, but then, Eddie didn\u2019t know Steve three years ago. None of it is really important anymore, is it?\u00a0\nAll Eddie knows is Steve now: Steve in the deep blue night, Steve under the red lights of hell. Steve wrapped around him in bed, kissing him with tongue. Holding him tight.\u00a0\n\u201cLet me just say this, then I\u2019ll drop it,\u201d Uncle Wayne says. His face is serious, lined and stern. He could be carved from stone.\nEddie gulps nervously and prepares to, like, defend Steve\u2019s honor.\n\u201cYou listen to me, Edwin, alright?\u201d Uncle Wayne says. \u201cYou\u2019re my boy. And if  your boy ever needs a place to stay, he\u2019s welcome here.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen Uncle Wayne pauses, Eddie stares at him incredulously. His heart is pounding, racing.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Steve, but I know his daddy. And if you say Steve\u2019s your sweetheart, then he is, and if that makes any trouble for  either one  of you, then you both come here. You come  home.  Got me?\u201d\nEddie feels his eyes well up again.\n\u201cYeah, Uncle Wayne,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cI got you.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd then everything boils over until Eddie is sobbing on the couch, hands over his eyes and Uncle Wayne\u2019s arm around his shoulders, just like when he was young.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m crying,\u201d he blubbers. \u201cI\u2019m, like, really happy. I\u2019m relieved!\u201d\n\u201cHush now,\u201d Uncle Wayne tells him, and pulls Eddie in tighter.\u00a0\nAnd then that\u2019s it: there\u2019s no interrogation, no yelling. Uncle Wayne lets Eddie cry it out, then makes him a cup of coffee. He doesn\u2019t say anything more about the way Eddie\u2019s been used as a chew toy. Doesn\u2019t do anything other than talk about where they\u2019re putting the garden, and how he got one of those raised beds to keep the plants in.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a tiny, tiny drop of truth in an ocean of lies. In the huge fucking wave of lies that threatens to drown Eddie every day: lies about his grades, about the bullying, about the drug deals, about the monsters and Chrissy and the hell dimension he\u2019d walked through.\nBut: he told Uncle Wayne about Steve, and it went alright. Maybe, some day, he can tell Uncle Wayne about the other stuff, too. Maybe it can be like it was when Eddie was a kid and all he ever needed was attention from his Uncle Wayne.\nOnce Eddie is a little steadier, Uncle Wayne takes him outside and hands Eddie a bag of dirt. Eddie wheezes and complains but carries it over anyway, Uncle Wayne right behind him.\nIt\u2019s June. It\u2019s warm. Eddie\u2019s got bruises down his neck and chest and thighs. He\u2019s going to see Steve Harrington later, and they\u2019re going to eat dinner and kiss and kiss and  kiss. He\u2019s got dirt on his hands. Tomato seeds in the pocket of his black jeans.\u00a0\nHe helps Uncle Wayne plant a garden."
