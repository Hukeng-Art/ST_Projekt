    "text": "For a while, Jaskier doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s cursed. It feels like free will, going back down that mountain, just as dangerous down as the way up, and alone this time, too. The descent is fast, maybe even reckless, but Jaskier\u2019s feeling numb and out-of-sorts anyways, Geralt\u2019s words simmering in his mind, and at the time it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s being pulled on by anything but his own desire to get away.\nIt\u2019s not until a day or two later, when he rounds a curve in the road and the bulk of the mountain is suddenly eclipsed by the tree line, that he feels completely free of it. He\u2019s hungry, he realizes. He could use a nap. Some things got lost in\u2014whatever that was, a primitive need to put distance between the hurt and that which is hurting you. But he feels much better now, he thinks, as he finds a log near the road and stretches his exhausted legs in front of him. Soon it will be like it all happened a long time ago.\n~\nJaskier forgets about it, because life returns to something like normal. Normal is walking the roads, town to town, finding inns where he can play for a meal and a place to sleep for the night. Normal is falling in with a group on the road, if he can find one, or walking with a dagger up his sleeve if he can\u2019t. Normal is hearing warnings about bandits haunting this road, rumors of Nilfgaardian soldiers on this one, and making extravagant detours around those places, just in case. It\u2019s spending his evenings at the inns in a tankard of ale, and spending his evenings on the road fireside, carefully darning the snags in his silks by firelight.\nHe hasn\u2019t written much new material, since it happened. But it feels like the words are pulling themselves together in his mind, the chords working themselves out before he even touches his lute. He isn\u2019t worried. In terms of new material, he\u2019s always been told that heartbreak is the best thing that can happen for a bard.\n~\nHe\u2019s playing a set at a tavern in backwoods Redania when it happens. One moment, he\u2019s working the crowd, all in poor spirits about some nearby drowners, into cheer with \u201cThe Fishmonger\u2019s Daughter,\u201d the next moment there\u2019s a sharp pull, like a hook, right behind his belly button. He stumbles from where he\u2019d been standing, one leg propped on a chair. The lute strings make a sharp, discordant noise.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jaskier says brightly. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d\nBut he finds he can\u2019t resume the song, even though his hands are tightly gripping the instrument\u2014it\u2019s his legs, pulling him forward, it\u2019s this sudden pressure in his head, all over, this mindless need to go. It\u2019s like being in a tight vise, squeezing everything out of him, even his breath.\n\u201cI\u2014intermission, everyone,\u201d he says, because what else can he do, when his legs are walking him out of the room? He\u2019s lucky that he hasn\u2019t taken a room in the village, has just the time to loop his pack onto his back, grab up his open lute case, which is sadly still mostly bereft of coin\u2014he\u2019d only just started.\nThere\u2019s grumbling now, around him, especially as he ricochets off of a couple bodies on his way to the door. He can\u2019t help it, this lack of control, but he can hear the disgruntled muttering, the boos.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019ve got the chorus from here on out,\u201d he says over his shoulder. \u201c\u2014Fishmonger\u2019s daughter, ba, ba, and repeat\u2014\u201d\nAt that point, the tavern\u2019s door has already slammed shut behind him.\nHis legs carry on, walking him west. He wasn\u2019t initially planning on that\u2014he was going to try north, which seemed safer\u2014but it seems the right way to go, now. The only way. As he keeps on, that terrible vise feeling slowly relents, the pressure easing up. A couple hours later, it\u2019s gone, and it\u2019s past midnight and the road is dark and he finally stumbles to the nearest clearing to sleep, and to not think, to very purposefully not think at all.\nWhen he wakes the next morning, he chalks it up to performance anxiety.\n\u201cEvery bard gets it from time to time,\u201d he tells himself, because talking aloud silences other thoughts. \u201cEven the most well-beloved. Especially those. As they say, even the sun gets a cloud sometimes.\u201d\nAnd then he can forget about it, mostly, because it doesn\u2019t happen again for weeks to come.\n~\nIn many ways, Jaskier is doing well. Better than well\u2014excellent. After holding off, he finally debuts \u201cHer Sweet Kiss,\u201d and as his travels continue, he has more than once heard its familiar notes being played by another instrument, from another bard, as he walks through another town. It is perhaps because of this that a letter somehow finds him, waiting at an inn in a backwater corner of Redania, from Oxenfurt, asking if he\u2019d want to come there and teach for a year. He also has had several memorable nights in beds shared by others, particularly one occupied by two lovely twins.\nJaskier should be happy by this\u2014he is. But his mind returns more than he\u2019d like to a time, several months before, when he still had a traveling companion. He thinks about the easy habit of unrolling his bedroll next to Geralt\u2019s. How Geralt patiently talked him through his different vials, the one time he\u2019d been so injured that Jaskier had had to lug him against his shoulder back to camp, and uncomplainingly let him unclothe him, clean the blood away. He thinks about those nights when Geralt would feed twigs into the fire while Jaskier would sit with the lute on his knee, fingering out a new composition.\nSometimes, for a diversion, Jaskier would ask Geralt for a word, any word, and he\u2019d try to make a tune to it. Geralt would do his typical glare, his typical silence, but sometimes he would unexpectedly throw out a word after a few minutes\u2014guts or purple or Roach\u2014nothing overly inspired, but still, he had.\nOther times, Jaskier would come up with most of the words himself, something like, Even if she can scratch the itch/ nothing in the world\u2019s worth a\u2014\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the word?\u201d Jaskier said, strumming his fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s a word, a perfect word\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019d laugh, because it only proved Geralt had been paying attention.\nBut.\n\nIf life could give me one blessing, it would be to take you off my hands. \n\nNot just the words themselves, painful as they were, but the delivery (Jaskier should know, as the performer): the pointed finger, the venom sunk into you, the way he\u2019d pivoted away afterward, a wordless dismissal.\nWhat else is a man to do with that? All along, the bedrolls side by side, the help after hunts, the nights of listening to Jaskier playing lute fireside\u2014Geralt must have been seething, stuck with a presence he\u2019d never wanted burdened with in the first place. They must have been words he\u2019d wanted to say for a very long time, built to their boiling point. Jaskier might not always be a reasonable man, but he\u2019s not so stupid as everyone assumes him to be. He\u2019d thought Geralt had come around, but that was just as likely as trips to the coast together, wasn\u2019t it?\nStupid, yes. But not anymore, he promises himself. He can be reasonable. He can stay gone.\n~\nIt happens again. It wakes him up from a deep sleep and, bleary-eyed and confused, forces him from the bed he\u2019d paid good coin for.\nIt happens another time\u2014this time, halfway up a woman\u2019s skirts behind the stable, and she laughs breathlessly, thinking he\u2019s not serious, when he suddenly extricates himself and takes several backward strides away.\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d she calls, when the distance continues to grow.\nAnd Jaskier tries to move his legs, to reverse course, and finds it\u2019s like they\u2019re made of lead, and his head is pounding as bad as mornings after drinking, and he can barely see\u2014\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d he says, trying valiantly to act as if this is in the plan. \u201cMy sweet, dear Adrianna\u2014\u201d\nBut he can\u2019t stop for her, his body wheeling him around the corner and marching him down the road, and he hears her voice calling pig\u2019s ass somewhere in the distance.\nAnd it happens again, only a few days later, the pressure, the vise-feeling, forcing him off the road and into a jerky lock-step through the woods, fighting it every step of the way, and when the feeling suddenly lifts away he finds himself so lost it takes him hours to find civilization again.\nHe is scared now, he can admit this to himself. He is scared of not knowing when it will happen, why it happens at all. He sleeps with his clothes on, with all of his belongings an easy reach away. The next large town he finds, in Temeria, he asks around until he finds the old woman, herbs hanging in bundles from her ceiling, who he thinks can help him.\n\u201cPayment first,\u201d the old woman croaks, holding out a hand, and he tries not to be aghast about how much money exits his bag for her palm. He only has enough to buy an hour.\nThen she makes him drink a terrible tea, filled with ingredients she won\u2019t divulge, and sit for a while as she feels over his head with her fingers.\nHe\u2019s just about lulled into sleep with that when she suddenly whistles through what teeth she has left.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some curse,\u201d she says.\n\u201cA curse?\u201d he says. \u201cOn me?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not a curse,\u201d she says, \u201cbut a wish. But a wish that may as well be a curse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe only looks at him.\n\u201cCould you, perhaps\u2014dear, dear woman\u2014be clearer in what that means?\u201d Jaskier finds his voice is rising, tries to tamp it down.\nShe thinks about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of why,\u201d she says, \u201cbut who.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2014\u201d he sputters. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Can you help me make it go away?\u201d\n\u201cThis is powerful stuff. Not something I can hope to act against.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doomed,\u201d Jaskier says. He feels hot and cold all over. \u201cYou may as well poison me and be done with it here. Someone wants me to walk my feet off, right to death, and the crone says\u2014beg your pardon\u2014that nothing can be done.\u201d\nThe woman lifts a hand. \u201cWell, maybe something can be\u2014\u201d\nBut Jaskier never knows the rest of that sentence, because he\u2019s suddenly lurched to his feet, the dregs of the tea spilling to the floor, and his feet moving themselves all on their own.\n\u201cHey, wait a second,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease, what\u2019s the something? What can be done?\u201d At this point he\u2019s clinging to the doorframe with his fingernails, trying to stay in the room with her. And when she only looks at him again, he says, \u201cNever mind, never mind. I paid for a full hour\u2014won\u2019t you give me the rest back? I\u2019ll need it.\u201d\nThe woman smiles and holds out her palm, still filled with his coin. \u201cSurely,\u201d she says. \u201cCome and take back what\u2019s yours.\u201d\nAnd Jaskier can only swear at her up and down three octaves when he makes a desperate grab and is immediately yanked the opposite direction, as if by a hand at the scruff of his neck, and his body is good for nothing but moving away, away, no matter what he wishes otherwise.\n~\nHe\u2019d tried to be safe\u2014as safe as he could be, all considering. He doesn\u2019t want to go any closer to the border, to Nilfgaard and its soldiers, than he has to. So on top of his worries about the sudden and unexpected moments that his body moves him senselessly from place to place, he\u2019s getting concerned about where his body won\u2019t let him go\u2014away from there. If anything, it seems to be dragging him closer and closer.\nThere comes a night, at a falling-apart tavern with the wind whistling through a hole in the eaves, that he sees them\u2014three Nilfgaardian soldiers. Cloaks obscure their armor, but he knows. He\u2019s only got a partial view of them, tucked next to a broad man on the table beside him, but he can hear them well enough as they speak to the barmaid.\nThey want to know if a bard\u2019s been through recently. Their hands sketch the air around how tall he is. Brown hair, they say. Flashy clothes. Carries a lute.\nJaskier hastily kicks his lute case beneath the table. The broad man beside him, nearly asleep, doesn\u2019t notice.\nHe\u2019s lucky that he hadn\u2019t played yet, turning over nearly the last of his coin for something nearly stew instead. He\u2019s lucky that his clothes haven\u2019t been so flashy recently, not after being forcibly blundered through muddy trails and all manner of vegetation. He\u2019s lucky that the barmaid didn\u2019t look closely at him, that the man beside him is nearly comatose. Still, his heart is jackrabbiting in his chest, and he waits only as long as to see the Nilfgaardians depart before he does so, too, his knees shaky, sticking close to shadows.\n~\nJaskier has to wonder how a humble bard could manage to accrue both a curse on his body and a headhunt from Nilfgaardian soldiers. He\u2019s not been without his enemies\u2014he thinks of the beds he\u2019s stolen into, taking the place of absent husband and wives. Surely there were those out there with grudges against him for this (even Geralt had witnessed this, once, yet another night when Jaskier had shoveled shit, he has since learned), and the coin to exact some kind of revenge, but somehow he can\u2019t see that anyone would\u2014not like this, in this way. But it seems there are no more answers, at least not the kind he could pay money for.\nHe aims himself north, avoids the road as much as possible. He makes camp beneath a large, dead oak, and is in better spirits the next day as he scuffs out the ashes of his fire. He even brings out his lute as he walks, and fiddles out a few different ditties as he goes\u2014nothing serious, but something to walk to. He can do this on his own, he knows. He just needs to get away from the soldiers, make his way to Oxenfurt, chain himself to a classroom wall there if he needs to, just to keep his body where it\u2019s supposed to be.\nIt\u2019s around sunset when he pushes his way through a bramble and then fumbles his grip on his lute, fingers suddenly grown loose.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he says. Because there\u2019s the large, dead oak, there\u2019s the fire he scuffed out this morning. It seems a particularly nasty trap of the world\u2019s making, putting him no further from danger, no closer to safety. He has walked all day only for his body to steer him in a circle back to where he began, with him none the wiser\u2014that he hasn\u2019t been in control, even when he thought he was.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t bother with a fire that night, or dinner. He lays very still on top of his bedroll and tries to run through a list of people he has known who would do this to him, and then a list of people he has known who would be willing and able to help him undo it, and is chilled in the morning to find both lists empty of names, answers.\n~\nA happy memory: the sharp edge of glass that went clear through the sole of his boot. Only because at the time, he\u2019d been walking along next to Roach, tuning the lute and telling Geralt a running list of who held grudges against who in Oxenfurt\u2019s faculty\u2014he would have done better to have a map to draw it all out, but Geralt, although not remarking, had his head tilted to the side like he was listening\u2014\n\u201c\u2014But she, of course, can\u2019t stand him, because he dismissed her last song cycle as trite, if you can believe\u2014fuck!\u201d\nAnd also because, at the time, Geralt immediately (and gratifyingly) leapt down from Roach, boots heavy on the dirt, and caught Jaskier by the arm as he hopped around on one foot and swore.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d Geralt said, not a question, because Jaskier had learned long since that witcher senses knew such things.\nAnd although Geralt\u2019s bedside manner was virtually nonexistent, he had sat Jaskier down on a nearby boulder, pulled off his boot\u2014thrown it over his shoulder\u2014and immediately started probing at the tender arch of Jaskier\u2019s foot.\n\u201c\u2014go green with rot and infection, eventually lose my whole leg\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Geralt grunted.\n\u201c\u2014the one-legged bard, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be known as, and it\u2019s not like I lost it even for a romantic reason\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pulling it out now,\u201d Geralt said, and then did. Jaskier yelped and then stopped talking, realizing there was something much better about watching Geralt knelt before him, rooting through his pack in concentration, his other hand cupping Jaskier\u2019s heel.\n\u201cWhy, Geralt,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Geralt, knowing better.\n\u201cBut I would say, if pressed, that it warms the heart to see how quickly you jump to the aid of your very best friend\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot your friend.\u201d\n\u201cYour closest fellow traveler\u2014hey, ow\u2014\u201d He reflexively tried to pull his foot back, but Geralt\u2019s grip was iron, keeping his foot in place as he rubs a salve of some kind over the broken skin, and there was just a brief flash of gold eyes as Geralt glanced up at him\u2014the message of stay put obvious\u2014before he returned to his work.\n\u201cOr, if you prefer, your most trusted compatriot, your loyal bard?\u201d Jaskier continued lightly, watching as Geralt made quick work of binding his foot, his expression one of complete concentration.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my anything,\u201d Geralt said shortly.\nWhy does this remain a happy memory for Jaskier, despite all the signs\u2014Geralt\u2019s dismissal of them as friends, as anything at all? Wasn\u2019t it just another moment in a long series: that Jaskier had caused another problem, however slight, that Geralt felt obligated against his will to fix?\nMaybe because he had been convinced that day, and for many days after, that Geralt\u2019s actions at the time had shown some kind of care, or concern\u2014like with the djinn, but without the accusation of shoveling shit. And also because, afterward, there was no Yennefer, but still just the two of them. Geralt had steadied him as he hopped on one foot over to Roach. Geralt had grabbed him around the waist and effortlessly boosted him up onto the horse. Geralt had efficiently swung up behind him, the bulk of him steady against Jaskier\u2019s back, pressing against his legs, one hand reaching around him for the reins.\n\u201cWhoo,\u201d Jaskier said, a little faintly. And then, \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different world up here on Roach, isn\u2019t it? Even the air seems a little thinner.\u201d Roach chuffed, her ears flicking back and forward again.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt said in his ear, the shut up implied. But maybe it\u2019s also because, in that moment, since Jaskier couldn\u2019t see him, he could imagine whatever he wanted, and not be proven wrong. So he imagined that Geralt\u2019s lips had quirked against his ear when he said it, a smile he never had for him in real life. He imagined he heard a warmth in Geralt\u2019s voice when he said it, a fond kind of exasperation\u2014he could have sworn to it. But\u2014he sees now\u2014 he must have never really heard it then, and wouldn\u2019t again.\n~\nJaskier does get one answer. He does find out who cursed him.\nFor days he\u2019d been camped just past a small village in Sodden, a small pinnacle of land that dropped off into cliffs on either side. There, he thought he might at least see someone\u2014bandits, Nilfgaardian soldiers, or whoever else\u2014 from above if they came for him. There, remaining rations and coin had been slowly running out. He\u2019s been mostly without a plan, too. He can\u2019t seem to move any further north\u2014toward safety, away from renegade Nilfgaard patrols. But the only other directions he seems to be able to go are closer to such a danger, and playing for money would likely alert Nilfgaard or any informants to his whereabouts, so he remains where he is, stuck, going nowhere.\nHe only has one plan, if it could be called that, and it is to try to find a way to contact Yennefer. The prospect does not excite him. He doesn\u2019t know if it can easily be done, or done at all, and there is no love lost between them. Yennefer could just as likely make him grovel and beg and then still not help him. But the witch\u2014the sorceress, Geralt had corrected him multiple times\u2014is the only person he can think of who might have the power to help him.\nIt happens again. He is eating a stale heel of bread when his body suddenly and urgently pulls him to his feet, and he is run at a frantic speed through the woods and along a cliff\u2019s edge. He is sick several times over, vomit down the front of his clothes, but nevertheless he is pulled like a helpless marionette until, suddenly, he isn\u2019t.\nHe doesn\u2019t have the energy to question it then. He has a brief, cold, miserable nap along the cliff\u2019s edge, and when he wakes he slowly tracks his way back to his camp\u2014expecting the same resistance, getting none. Apparently it is safe to return to where he was. When he gets back to his campsite, it appears undisturbed.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s expecting when he walks into the village. He\u2019s on the receiving end of several odd glances, probably because of the vomit all down his front, which puts him on edge\u2014he doesn\u2019t want the wrong set of eyes to notice him. However, most of the villagers are out, talking loudly and excitedly, many bristling with weapons, their attention pulled elsewhere.\nJaskier tugs on a man\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d\n\u201cWitcher,\u201d the man says, and spits. \u201cCame here demanding to be let through, but we gave him exactly the kind of welcome he deserves.\u201d\nJaskier knows, he already knows. But still he asks. \u201cWhite hair? Yellow eyes?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one. There he was, promising he wasn\u2019t going to harm any of us, but we knew better, Butcher of Blaviken that he is,\u201d says the man, who, along with his village, obviously hadn\u2019t heard \u201cToss a Coin\u201d come to these parts yet. \u201cBut he wanted something desperately, that was obvious. Nearly feral to get at something\u2014someone, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2014\u201d Jaskier says. He\u2019s starting to feel faint. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\n\u201cBack where he came from,\u201d the man says, and jerks his thumb north\u2014north, the direction that Jaskier can\u2019t go in recently, where his body won\u2019t let him go. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take no well, so we\u2019ll be waiting for him if he does choose to come back.\u201d\nJaskier turns away. They\u2019d all be killed, of course. Stupid, thinking a couple pitchforks, a crossbow, could stand against Geralt if Geralt had really wanted to do harm against them. The old habit to defend Geralt against the hatred of humans comes easily, but he doesn\u2019t voice it.\nHe walks back to his campsite, feeling each realization sink like a rock in his stomach. He remembers the first time it ever happened\u2014merrily singing \u201cThe Fishmonger\u2019s Daughter\u201d all those months ago\u2014a village plagued by drowners. And the other times since, at villages and waysides that two frequent travelers could, by chance, intersect at, each for their own reasons. There could be no coincidence that Geralt would come here and it would happen again.\nHe remembers what the old woman he\u2019d paid had said\u2014that it wasn\u2019t a question of why, but who. Was it Geralt who cursed him? Was it Geralt who wanted him so far away him from that, whenever opportunity brought them close together, he was forced elsewhere, beyond the possibility of encountering each other?\nHe wants to feel angry, but he only feels empty. Had he been that much of a pest, a nuisance, that Geralt couldn\u2019t have believed Jaskier would, without this, stay gone?\nWhatever reason had brought Geralt in this direction\u2014Jaskier would leave in the morning, so that Geralt could return and do what he needed without nearly running Jaskier off a cliff.\nHe slowly wrestles out of his soiled clothing. He realizes that\u2019s the only plan he\u2019s got. He can\u2019t ask Yennefer for help, after all\u2014she\u2019s probably the one Geralt asked to do this. Jaskier doubts she\u2019d undo something that benefits her just as much Geralt, in the end.\n~\nThere\u2019s a switchback trail that takes him down the cliffside early the next morning, nearly as treacherous as the descent down the mountain all those months ago. He has a few hours of peace.\nAfter that, it gets bad, and stays that way.\nIt happens again and again and again, an increased frequency that he can\u2019t make sense of, even if he wasn\u2019t exhausted. If he stops to eat, sleep, or relieve himself, he is quickly pulled on again, his feet stumbling over themselves, lurching him onward. Even when there\u2019s a stitch in his side, when he\u2019s crying for breath, when every muscle in his body is shaking and weak.\nWhy doesn\u2019t Geralt stop this? Doesn\u2019t he understand Jaskier is trying already to leave him be?\nHe is forced up rocky hillsides, his hands cut and bleeding from the scree, the footing so dubious that Roach would probably not be able to climb it swiftly, or at all. Along perilous outcroppings of rock, where his doublet catches a snag and he has no choice but to leave it behind, swinging ghostly in the breeze. Into circuitous routes that sometimes, as it did before, return him to places where he just was. His body forces him across cold rivers, shivering, as if to throw Geralt off his scent there. Fighting the pull of it seems dangerous when his body is already in danger, so he simply lets it happen, feeling like he is watching someone else\u2019s body attempt these hazards. In this way, two days pass\u2014but it doesn\u2019t seem to help. Geralt still seems close at his heels, no matter what he tries. He keeps on having to keep going.\nThis can\u2019t be what Geralt wants, he thinks hazily. He knows Geralt\u2014knows he wouldn\u2019t play with him like this, a cat with a mouse. He must not realize how he is driving Jaskier before him, like a fox flushed from its hole, and the trap is slowly tightening around him\u2014the territory more dangerous, the stakes even higher.\nOn the third day, his feet lead him past a group of traveling musicians, and in desperation he grabs at them\u2014he sees they are frightened by him, by his dirtied clothes, his unkempt appearance.\n\u201cA song for you to perform at your stops,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nHis feet are dancing beneath him; he feels like he\u2019s standing on hot coals, the longer he resists, screaming at him to move on.\nThe musicians take pity on him. It\u2019s not his best work\u2014he doesn\u2019t feel that he can leave too obvious of a communication for anyone else\u2019s ears\u2014but he hopes the message is clear:\n\nThe white wolf and his prey go round and round/Does he realize his prey will be run into the ground?\n\n\nIf not the wolf\u2019s teeth at his heels/His prey will be caught beneath an empire\u2019s wheels. \n\nIt seems, that night, that Geralt has heard his message. Jaskier sits, exhausted beyond measure, at a creek in the dark, resting his aching body in the cold water. He imagines Geralt stopping at one of the inns Jaskier passed by, hearing that scrap of song meant for him, or perhaps catching up with the musicians on the road and, upon listening, turning Roach in the opposite direction. He wishes for it, fervently. At that moment, he wishes to never see Geralt again, to never be within even ten miles of him.\nBut no\u2014with a gasp, he is pulled awake only moments after unrolling his bedroll, already shambling up to stand.\n\u201cNo, no no no,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s no use. He grabs onto a tree, wraps his arms around it. He holds on as hard as he can, his head swimming. His bedroll, his pack\u2014 his lute. They\u2019re still there, only a couple paces away, but they might as well be across the continent. He can only watch his arms shake with the strain until he can\u2019t resist the draw anymore, and he\u2019s off again, lurching away. He wants to cry in frustration, he wants to shout, but he knows now that soon enough he\u2019ll be gasping for breath, so he saves it while he can.\n~\nIt seems, if anything, that the song has only redoubled Geralt\u2019s efforts.\nThere isn\u2019t time anymore for him to stumble to a halt, or rest. At one point he falls, his legs giving out beneath him, and still he is forced to crawl on, the vise-feeling tightening, a stranglehold around him.\nSeveral times he passes out while walking, but when he comes to, he\u2019s still moving, still doggedly going forward. His eyes feel rubbed raw, his tongue bone-dry in his mouth, the last of his bread crumbling to dust in his mouth. His boots are peeling away from their soles; he walks right out of them.\nIt is mindless, the kind of instinctual need to run that a predator\u2019s quarry feels\u2014the need to get away. But he can\u2019t. It\u2019s Geralt, the White Wolf. Of course he can\u2019t get away.\n~\nA happy memory: one night, many months ago\u2014before the mountain, before all of this. A cold night, despite the fire, and both of their bedrolls pushed close together for warmth.\nSometime in the night, Jaskier woke, finding himself pleasantly warm: Geralt against his back, his arm across his waist. He was too drowsy to be surprised, or to comment on it. But when he leaned his head back, he saw Geralt was awake too: those handsome features traced by firelight, in much the same way his poet\u2019s heart wanted to trace those features with his fingers. He was awake, and looking right back at Jaskier.\n\u201cDid I\u2014wake you?\u201d Jaskier asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Geralt said. He didn\u2019t move to draw his arm back, or put inches between their bodies where there currently were none.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier said. He felt a yawn coming on but his hands are pinned by Geralt\u2019s arm, so he ended up turning his head into his shoulder\u2014Geralt\u2019s shoulder\u2014to muffle it.\nSomething else he had imagined: that he had seen Geralt\u2019s features soften in the firelight at that.\nJaskier was used to voicing his feelings to his lovers, but this was different. There was always that tender part in him that feared that Geralt didn\u2019t feel the same\u2014the tender part that ached, that whole way down the mountain\u2014and what did he have to pin it on? A listening ear, a foot bandaged, an arm around his waist as he slept. It wasn\u2019t enough for Jaskier to ever know for sure.\n\u201cGo to sleep, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt rumbled.\nThere was that part of Jaskier that yearned for Geralt to know how he felt. He hoped that Geralt could, somehow\u2014those witcher senses\u2014parse out his love, his lust, his devotion, all bursting forth in a flourish whenever he was around him. Rather than withering, they only seem to strengthen with time. There were moments, like then, when he was sure Geralt could sense it. That tender part in him waited to see what Geralt could do with that knowledge, which could be wielded against him as expertly as any weapon Geralt might use.\nAnd then, softer, \u201cJaskier, go to sleep.\u201d The arm cinched tighter. Jaskier slept.\n~\nJaskier\u2019s not sure what day it is the day he leaves the forest and sees the keep, standing high on the plain, the setting sun casting it red. The vise-feeling still simmers beneath his skin, softly burning, but it has lost its urgency, and for the first time in more hours than he can count, he is aware of his surroundings. As if from the end of a long tunnel, he sees a trickle of people walking through the door set into the wall around the castle. He sees a soldier turn, spot him, and wave a hand, high and insistent, over his head, gesturing him over. He discovers there\u2019s nothing pushing him forward now except for the desire for shelter. On quivering legs, he pushes himself forward, crossing the shorn fields to where the soldier stands.\n\u201cYou just made it,\u201d the soldier tells him. \u201cWe\u2019re barring the gates now.\u201d\nJaskier is too exhausted to ask. He must nod, he must be told next where to go. He doesn\u2019t remember. He leans his shoulder heavily against the wall within as he trudges further into the keep. His breath is rasping up from his throat, and he doesn\u2019t realize until someone lays a hand gently on his arm, gives him a waterskin. He drains it, find his head is still fuzzy, and a distant pain like a blanket over his whole body. He just wants to sleep.\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he asks.\nA voice at his elbow answers, but it\u2019s too hard to focus his eyes on any one image. \u201cLord Kosma\u2019s keep.\u201d\nAnother voice says, \u201cYou must have walked far to get here.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jaskier says. He pats over himself, feeling that he\u2019s all still there. His stomach pulses with hunger beneath his palm. His chin is covered over with bristles\u2014he can\u2019t remember, in all of this, the last time he used a razor.\n\u201cWill you be able to hold a weapon, son?\u201d The voice is brusque. Jaskier\u2019s swimming eyes try to find the speaker.\n\u201cA\u2026 weapon?\u201d\nThis is how he learns that Nilfgaardian soldiers are waiting at the southern border, that Lord Kosma\u2019s keep is all that\u2019s standing between them. The doors have been barred, the high walls packed shoulder to shoulder with Kosma\u2019s soldiers, able civilians, all that can keep them from being annihilated one and all.\nThis is how the trap around Jaskier has been sprung: that Geralt has pushed him to here, where he can go no further, where the other jaw of a pincer waits for him. He wonders in a detached way if he\u2019ll be recognized and captured, questioned for whatever reason Nilfgaard has been searching for him, or killed outright. Either way, death seems imminent.\n\u201cThis man can\u2019t hold a weapon,\u201d someone says. \u201cHe can barely stand upright. Put him in the banquet hall with the rest.\u201d\nA long time seems to pass. Around him, in the guttering light of the torches lining the banquet hall, people shift uneasily, crying and cursing. An elderly man sits quiet, mumbling to himself. A small girl pushes herself into her mother\u2019s arm, her sobs muffled. Outside, there\u2019s a slowly growing barrage of noise. The Nilfgaardians must be attacking them now. It is only a matter of time.\nThere\u2019s a sudden, unpleasant clenching that comes down around his entire body.\n\u201cAh, bollocks,\u201d Jaskier says, but without any real heart. He\u2019s been half-expecting this. He\u2019s propelled to his feet, pushed as if by a gale-force wind against the opposite side of the banquet hall\u2014the side furthest from Geralt, he guesses. But Geralt can\u2019t really be here, can he? They\u2019re all about to be slaughtered.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The voice is harsh; one of the few soldiers that is not on the walls, left behind to protect them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s scared,\u201d someone says. \u201cHe\u2019s running away.\u201d\n\u201cI am not running away,\u201d Jaskier says, as his body meanwhile repeatedly slams itself against the unmoving stone walls. His fingers scrabble uselessly at the rock, as if they could dig himself through the stone and out.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to escape,\u201d another voice chimes in.\nAnother, hysterically: \u201cHe\u2019s a spy! He\u2019s trying to go back to Nilfgaard now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Jaskier starts to say, and his voice chokes away. The vise twists tighter, tighter. It pushes him to his knees. There\u2019s a pain all over, as if from standing too close to a hot flame, but he can\u2019t move away from it. There\u2019s nowhere else to go.\nThe soldier snaps his fingers at two others standing by the doors. Together they drag Jaskier out of the banquet hall and up the stairs, where he won\u2019t be inciting further hysteria. His feet kick out beneath him, his arms twist.\n\u201cStop resisting,\u201d the guard says.\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014trying\u2014to,\u201d he gasps out, as his body jerks violently in their grasp, and he gets a blow across his face for his troubles.\nThey chain him to a bed on one of the upper floors, the chain looped around his wrists and one of the bedposts. They stand there for a moment, satisfied that their work seems to be holding, and then they leave. A bolt slides into place\u2014they have locked him in.\nJaskier can understand, now, the mindless need of a rabbit whose leg has been caught in a trap. How it could be driven to gnaw off its own leg if it means freedom. The bed is shuddering beneath him as his body throws itself away from the bedpost, again and again. The chains are rubbing his wrists raw, and still\u2014the vise-feeling is too much, driving his body to panic. There are loud sounds in the corridor outside\u2014screams, blades screeching against each other. The vise-feeling is so strong he feels like a dishrag, wrung impossibly taut. He feels like he could snap apart.\nThe bedpost suddenly gives way beneath him, sending him to the floor. He stumbles back up immediately, and drags the chain and the bedpost to the window. He watches as he wildly flings his caught hands out, sending the bedpost through the glass of the window, shattering around him. He watches as first one leg, then another, step onto the window\u2019s ledge. Vaguely, he can see motion beneath him\u2014flame, the writhing of armor, swords, from those fighting beneath him. His teeth are chattering. He can\u2019t stop.\nBehind him, the locked door suddenly, violently opens, splinters flying like sparks. There is Geralt, filling the doorway. It is amazing, nearly magic, to see Geralt after all these months, that he\u2019s remembered nothing wrong. He\u2019s got a sword tight in one hand, a slash of red against one cheek. His hair in disarray, snarled mouth\u2014he looks feral, a true wolf. His eyes snap to Jaskier\u2019s, and they are like flame from across the room, bright enough to burn.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d he says. \u201cGet out of the fucking window.\u201d\nA hysterical sound, almost a laugh, climbs Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cI would like to.\u201d\nGeralt takes one step into the room, and immediately Jaskier\u2019s legs cramp, wanting to take that one step forward, away from Geralt in the only possible direction\u2014out the window, a sure drop to death.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Jaskier moans. \u201cPlease\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nHe can\u2019t see anymore. It seems like Geralt\u2019s voice is further away. The voice is saying, \u201cJaskier, Jaskier,\u201d but the tone is all wrong\u2014sharp, but worried, powerless. It doesn\u2019t sound like Geralt at all.\nJaskier\u2019s legs buckle beneath him. He grasps onto the window frame with both hands. He knows he can\u2019t hold on forever, that he can only buy these few seconds, shaking in fear as his fingers unpeel themselves from their grip on the frame, one by one. But there is something in him, a hidden well of strength he\u2019s always had, and he funnels every last bit of himself into that thread of willpower, steeling himself against the curse, fighting it harder than he ever has. His heart, wanting him closer to Geralt. His body, forcing him further away. It\u2019s his last stand, he thinks. Geralt is saying something to him, but he can\u2019t hear it, not over the rush of noise in his ears.\nThen.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how he notices, but he does. He lifts his chin from where it\u2019s tucked into his chest, and it\u2019s like his head weighs more than a boulder, trembling on his neck. But he looks, because there\u2019s a crackling feeling like static, or lightning, in the air. A shift, like the drop in pressure before a storm. He looks over his shoulder\u2014another finger gives up its grip\u2014and sees Yennefer walking across the bedroom toward him. Her dress floats behind her, her purple eyes fixed on Jaskier.\nIs this what she\u2019s here for? A chance to gloat, before the end of it all? But her voice is gentle as she says, her voice echoing strangely in his ears, \u201cPoor little bard. You\u2019ve gone a long way, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe hasn\u2019t the strength anymore to answer. One of his hands wrenches itself entirely from the window frame, the chain pulling against his other wrist; he is listing forward into the void; it is all his body has the power to do. But Yennefer is closer, and her hand is incredibly soft as it comes down upon his forehead. After that, he doesn\u2019t know. All he sees is black.\n~\nHe wakes up to someone humming one of his songs.\nIt is an older song of his, not one he\u2019s circulated in his repertoire recently, about a siren who cries as she sings her prey to their watery sleep. He remembers Valdo Marx calling it melodramatic. Jaskier had always been proud of the particular transition into the second stanza\u2014\nJaskier feebly hums the next few notes, forcing his eyelids open.\n\u201cOh good,\u201d says a high, girlish voice. \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake.\u201d\nHe\u2019s in a high-ceilinged room, filled with sunlight from the open window. The bed is wide and white. Beside him, a girl is perched on a chair, regarding him with solemn green eyes. She looks somewhat familiar to him, but he isn\u2019t sure why.\n\u201cFinally?\u201d Jaskier repeats, his voice croaking.\n\u201cHere.\u201d She turns to the table next to the bed, and fills a cup from a pitcher before handing it to him. She continues to watch silently as he takes three large gulps, draining the cup.\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\nThe girl shrugs. \u201cYennefer brought us here. You needed time to rest.\u201d\nAt the mention of Yennefer, Jaskier remembers\u2014the window, the cool hand on his forehead. Geralt\u2019s eyes blazing at him from across the room.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Jaskier says faintly. After a moment, he hitches himself up onto his elbows, looks around the room again. The kind of furnishings befitting nobility. It has Yennefer all over it. He runs a hand over his chest, his shoulders, checking he\u2019s all still there. He might need a few good meals, now, but all feels in order. It\u2019s only when he touches his jaw, feels the smoothness of it, that it really sinks in\u2014the curse is gone. It wouldn\u2019t have let him stay still long enough to be shaved, before.\nThe girl stands up from her chair, leans over to refill his cup again. He watches as she does so, bemused.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have your acquaintance,\u201d he says, raising the cup to his lips.\n\u201cYou can call me Ciri,\u201d she says, and then pauses, as if to give him time to figure it out. The green eyes, the blonde hair\u2014Pavetta\u2019s face, he realizes, and promptly chokes on the water, sputtering it back into the glass.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the princess,\u201d he coughs out, and Ciri gives him the ghost of a smile.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re Geralt\u2019s bard,\u201d she says.\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI\u2019m not Geralt\u2019s anything, really.\u201d\nCiri doesn\u2019t reply, but cocks her head a little. Jaskier fiddles his fingers over the blanket, creasing it and smoothing it back over. \u201cIs he here then? Geralt?\u201d Even though he already knows the answer.\nCiri nods. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back again soon.\u201d\nJaskier moves to sit up further, and winces. He feels sore all over: his legs, his arms. He notices, on the hand holding his cup, healing cuts, ragged nails, red circles around his wrists where the chains were. The right side of his face gives a tender throb\u2014probably the place where the guard had hit him when dragging him upstairs at the keep.\n\u201cYennefer said you nearly walked yourself to death,\u201d Ciri says, her eyes round with the gravity of her words.\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say for sure.\u201d\n\u201cShe said you walked the skin off your feet. That you were horrible to look at, like a living corpse.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jaskier says again, faintly. \u201cThe sheets aren\u2019t a pool of blood, so I\u2019m assuming she put all that right.\u201d\n\u201cYennefer said all that\u2019s left now is for you to rest and feel better,\u201d Ciri says primly.\n\u201cAnd do you?\u201d A new, familiar voice rumbles. \u201cFeel better?\u201d\nGeralt had entered the room on silent feet. His hair looks freshly washed, neatly tied back, and he\u2019s wearing a loose black linen shirt. Despite the water, Jaskier\u2019s mouth seems to instantly go dry at the sight of him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m on the mend,\u201d he says. Geralt\u2019s eyes are looking at the bed\u2014more specifically, his hand on the bed, worrying the blanket between his fingers again. He quickly stops.\n\u201cCiri,\u201d Geralt says, still looking at Jaskier\u2019s hand. \u201cWe have some things we need to talk about.\u201d\nIt becomes clear that the we Geralt speaks of is himself and Jaskier as Ciri gives him another small smile and stands from her chair. A moment later, the door closes behind her. Geralt stays standing there, at the threshold.\nJaskier has never felt awkward in Geralt\u2019s presence before, always happy to fill in the silences. This feels different, the quiet unbroken. Finally, he blurts, \u201cYou found her, then. Your Child Surprise.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Geralt says. He takes a step further into the room.\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\nThere is a muscle moving in Geralt\u2019s jaw. Finally, he speaks. \u201cIt was me, Jaskier.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was? The curse?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cYes, I figured as much.\u201d\n\u201cIt was what I said, that day on the mountain,\u201d Geralt says. And then, like the words are being unwillingly dragged from him, \u201cIf life could give me one blessing, it would be to take you off my hands.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jaskier says, with an edge to his voice. \u201cI remember that just fine.\u201d\n\u201cThe djinn,\u201d Geralt says, with his characteristic scarcity of words. \u201cWhen I said those words, I didn\u2019t realize\u2014the djinn. Took it as a wish. Made the words into\u2014\u201d He makes an aborted hand gesture, glares murder at the bedspread. \u201cA curse.\u201d\nJaskier thinks back, as much as he doesn\u2019t want to, to that day on the mountain. Remembers Geralt spitting those words at him, and not long afterward, the uncontestable desire to get away, as quickly as possible. Heartbreak had masked its very origin, until now. The whole time, this whole mess, was never Yennefer, but the djinn, taking Jaskier off Geralt\u2019s hands whenever such a chance presented itself, forcing distance between them.\n\u201cOver the last few months, there were a few times we had near misses,\u201d Geralt goes on grudgingly. \u201cThat I would come to a place just as you left it. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. But then there was a bounty on your head, Nilfgaardians wanting to find you to find me.\u201d\nJaskier looks up. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of Ciri. They knew I had her,\u201d Geralt replies. \u201cI knew I had to find you first, and I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThat must have been\u2026 exasperating,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cI can normally track down what I\u2019m looking for very easily,\u201d Geralt agrees.\nJaskier thinks. \u201cSo\u2026 outside of Sodden\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI had tracked you to there,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cBut the villagers wouldn\u2019t let me through, so I had to double back around the cliffs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you heard my song?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cAt a traveler\u2019s rest. But you were too close to Nilfgaard by then for me to stop.\u201d\nJaskier closes his eyes. \u201cAnd all the days after?\u201d\n\u201cChased you across every cliff, forest, and river in all of Sodden,\u201d Geralt says, sounding exhausted. \u201cEven with your song, I had no idea what it was doing to you, to keep you ahead of me.\u201d\nIt seems like years ago, remembering the terrible vise-feeling, the stumbling and crawling, the dry heaves, or how his eyes rolled back in his head, taking him to something like sleep, as his body horribly shambled on.\n\u201cAnd you found me at the keep,\u201d Jaskier says. It is easier to talk to Geralt with his eyes still closed, without seeing his beautiful, remote face.\n\u201cBy then I\u2019d left Ciri with Yennefer,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cWhen I realized where you were, I was able to contact her to come help me. Without her, you would have\u2014\u201d\nJaskier, clinging to the window frame with nothing but his fingernails and his stubbornness. The steep drop below.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt says roughly. \u201cI nearly killed you.\u201d\nJaskier finally opens his eyes. \u201cOh, everyone deserves at least one crack at it,\u201d he says. His eyes skirt across Geralt. \u201cThe only real loss here was my doublet. Cost me two months of work\u2014real Redanian purple silkworms, if you believe it. And\u2014and my lute,\u201d he continues bravely. \u201cBeautiful, sexy girl that she was. If there was ever a tragedy\u2014some one-toothed hermit\u2019s firewood as we speak.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Geralt says. He steps further into the room, leans down, and grabs something from beneath Jaskier\u2019s bed. To his astonishment\u2014it\u2019s his lute case. He quickly opens it, his hands fervent over the familiar wood.\n\u201cBut\u2014she\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s perfect. How?\u201d\n\u201cI was tracking you, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt says. Of course he\u2019s imagining it\u2014the fondness in Geralt\u2019s voice? \u201cI went right through your abandoned campsite. I wouldn\u2019t just leave your lute behind.\u201d\nJaskier brushes a thumb over the strings, a light burst of sound. Geralt is standing so close now, right against the bed, but after all these months apart it feels too overwhelming, to meet that gold gaze head-on, so he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Jaskier agrees, still looking at his lute.\nHe senses that Geralt\u2019s about to say something else, but there\u2019s a light tap on the door, a formality he wouldn\u2019t have expected from Yennefer, who is the kind of witch\u2014sorceress, he reminds himself\u2014 who normally would stride right in. Surprisingly, the sight of her doesn\u2019t bring up the usual mix of animosity, jealousy. She gracefully sinks into the chair Ciri left, arranging her gray dress across her knees.\n\u201cWell, bard,\u201d she says. \u201cYou certainly led us on a merry chase.\u201d\n\u201cI live to surprise,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAnd I am surprised you lived,\u201d she answers, a smile quirking her lips.\n\u201cAll the thanks to you,\u201d he says, and one of her eyebrows ascends her forehead in disbelief.\n\u201cAre you hearing this, Geralt?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing it,\u201d he replies.\n\u201cAnd to what do I owe you?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cServitude? My undying devotion?\u201d\n\u201cI believe the latter is already directed elsewhere,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I have enough of the first. No, bard, nothing is owed.\u201d She sits back in her chair. \u201cOnly an end to the business of you and djinns.\u201d\n\u201cOh, to that I can emphatically agree.\u201d\n\u201cThis interlude aside,\u201d Yennefer says, waving her hand dismissively, \u201cour plan was to winter in Kaer Morhen. Nilfgaard still has a price on your head\u2026\u201d she trails off delicately.\nJaskier understands the unsaid offer. To travel with Geralt and Yennefer and Ciri to a place where he would be protected. But haven\u2019t the past few months been punishment enough? Having to see Geralt and Yennefer together would wear away any good feeling to the situation. No, he would have to be far away from that whole heartbreak in order to ever get over it\u2014and no djinn has to force him there.\n\u201cI received a letter from Oxenfurt, months ago,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIf not for this, it\u2019s where I would have been, anyways.\u201d\nHe feels, rather than sees, Geralt stiffen next to the bed.\n\u201cAnd your safety?\u201d Yennefer asks.\n\u201cI have plenty of acquaintances there,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAnd places to go aground if I need to. Really, I think it would be\u2014best for everyone.\u201d\nGeralt lets out a long, slow breath, like he\u2019s centering himself, or trying to.\nYennefer pauses, then says, \u201cWe can accompany you as far as there.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d Jaskier says, at the same time Geralt grits out, \u201cIf that\u2019s what Jaskier wants\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for your own wellbeing,\u201d Yennefer says. Her eyes are on Geralt as she says it, a strangely quelling look. \u201cSo it\u2019s settled.\u201d\n~\nTraveling with Geralt again is odd. Aside from Geralt and Roach\u2014who gave him a not-so-gentle shove on the shoulder with her nose when they were reunited\u2014there are now Ciri and Yennefer and their horses, too. Jaskier gets a horse as well, which he is grateful for\u2014his feet still feel too tender to walk far.\nThe arrangement has Geralt leading the procession of horses, then Ciri and Jaskier in the middle\u2014the two soft humans needing protection\u2014and the rear brought up by Yennefer. Jaskier is able to sing a little as they go, and entertain Ciri with scraps of stories. Sometimes Yennefer will laugh\u2014not always unpleasantly, or at him, although the time he was too engrossed in telling a story to see the branch coming at him at nose-height was definitely both\u2014and give some edifying remark meant for Ciri. Geralt says nothing.\nGeralt says nothing when they stop to eat, or rest the horses, or make camp for the night: three tents that Yennefer magics out of the air. Ciri and Geralt share one, as opposed to Yennefer and Geralt, but Jaskier can only assume they are keeping pretenses where they can. They are out in the wilderness, and Ciri is a child, and they will have time to share close quarters again once they\u2019re in Kaer Morhen. They are, at least, less maddeningly heartsick for each other. In fact, if Geralt\u2019s staring intensely at anyone during this journey, it\u2019s as Jaskier, not that Jaskier can figure out why.\nOr\u2014Jaskier does know, but he doesn\u2019t want to think about it too much. He remembers in their last conversation that Geralt had mentioned being aware he\u2019d several times been in places that Jaskier had recently vacated. Geralt had known they\u2019d been in proximity and had never tried to close that distance, to willingly seek him out. He\u2019d never tried to find Jaskier then, was happy to keep from seeing him until it became a necessity to do so. It can only mean that Geralt still bristles at the fact of Jaskier\u2019s company\u2014hadn\u2019t wanted it then or now. But it was Yennefer who forced them together this time, Jaskier defends himself, if only in his own thoughts. It hadn\u2019t been his idea at all. He\u2019s been set perfectly straight on the matter.\nIt goes on like this for days. The only time Geralt is not silent is when he says something in a low voice to Ciri, who he seems to slightly soften around. Once, looking for firewood, Jaskier stumbles across Yennefer and Geralt in some kind of lovers\u2019 quarrel\u2014they must be trying to be out of earshot of Ciri\u2014but as soon as they see him, Yennefer throws her hands up and walks away. Jaskier gets the sense his presence is only making things worse, more stifling. It will probably be better when they leave him at Oxenfurt. It will be better for him, too\u2014it already hurts enough, seeing how well-matched they are when they stand so close together. He is already missing Geralt, and Geralt isn\u2019t even gone\u2014he\u2019s in his heady presence for the first time in months.\nBut Geralt has said all he\u2019s needed to say to Jaskier, and that\u2019s that. So Jaskier steers a wide circle around him, converses with Ciri when he can, and sleeps hugging his lute, grateful that Geralt, if nothing else, saved it for him.\nOn the rainy day they cross the border into Redania, Yennefer calls up to Geralt, leading the way: \u201cTonight, Geralt, I want an inn.\u201d\nGeralt doesn\u2019t show by any outward sign that he\u2019s heard, but several hours later they are stabling their horses in a perfectly adequate town. Jaskier, in his enthusiasm to get out of the drizzle, leads the group of them to the inn, where the innkeeper is standing in the doorway.\n\u201cHello, there,\u201d he calls. \u201cDoes your fine establishment have any--?\u201d\nThe man gasps at the sight of Geralt, presumably scowling from under his cloak, and slams the door shut in their face. Yennefer must send a pulse of magic, because it promptly springs open again, hinges rattling.\n\u201c\u2014Rooms available?\u201d Jaskier continues brightly, as if nothing had happened. \u201cWe\u2019ll need three.\u201d\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Geralt growls, from behind him.\nJaskier gives him a look of confusion. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Geralt repeats menacingly, and the innkeeper hands the keys over with shaking hands as Yennefer exchanges the money.\nBut of course the past days have probably upset their usual arrangement. Jaskier presumes the both of them wanted the inn, if only for a way to more discretely scratch the itch while on the road. No wonder Geralt\u2019s been in such a mood. Jaskier\u2019s used to being left behind by them, though. At least he has Ciri now, and the knowledge he can get away from this nightmare in a few more days.\nJaskier walks up the stairs next to Ciri, who is wringing her hair dry with one hand, and is so sure that he\u2019s sharing a room with her that he\u2019s in the act of following her in when Yennefer holds up a hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re with Geralt,\u201d she says simply. And then closes the door in his face.\nJaskier and Geralt have shared plenty of rooms in their travels in the past, plenty of beds. This should be nothing out of the ordinary. He follows Geralt into the room and slings his pack down on the bed, sets his lute case on the chair. Steels himself. When he turns around, Geralt is leaning against the door, staring at him.\n\u201cLove the way you just\u2014\u201d Jaskier flexes his wrist, tries to affect unconcern\u2014\"Stand there at the threshold and brood.\u201d\n\u201cI want to do it again,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cI must have done it wrong.\u201d\n\u201cDo what, again?\u201d\n\u201cApologize,\u201d Geralt grunts, like the word has an unpleasant taste to it. It probably does\u2014he\u2019d probably rather fight three consecutive selkiemores.\n\u201cApologize?\u201d Jaskier repeats.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you mean, again?\u201d Jaskier cries, his voice higher.\n\u201cSo, fine then, I didn\u2019t do it right,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not coming with me. And normally I wouldn\u2019t have to ask.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not coming with you,\u201d Jaskier says, aghast. \u201cWhy would you want me to?\u201d\nGeralt stares at him, as if equally uncomprehending. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of those things I said on the mountain,\u201d he finally says. \u201cI was angry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe djinn, yes, I know,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cThe words themselves felt like you did mean them, though. Very much.\u201d\nGeralt lifts a shoulder and drops it. \u201cI\u2019ve said a lot of things I didn\u2019t mean. It never kept you from staying with me before.\u201d\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Jaskier says, blowing out a breath, \u201cis this an apology?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the reason for my problems, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cAnd it would not be a blessing to have you gone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Geralt says in a low voice. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI can see this whole scenario is foreign and uncomfortable to you, so we can wrap it up,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cApology accepted. Now come away from the door, please. You\u2019re reminding me of a prison warden.\u201d\nGeralt uncrosses his arms and steps closer. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come to Kaer Morhen with us?\u201d\n\u201cAh, well. The answer to that\u2014I\u2019m afraid\u2014is still no.\u201d\nJaskier turns away, trying to seem busy with unearthing his smallclothes from his pack, but Geralt is there at his shoulder, all but breathing down his neck. He turns back around.\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\n\u201cI presume you would like to know why. Well\u2014the answer is simple. I don\u2019t play second fiddle as well as I play the lute.\u201d\n\u201cSecond fid\u2014\u201d Geralt says, and then his scowl morphs into something else. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean Yennefer?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t mean Yennefer?\u201d Jaskier says, doing a passable imitation of Geralt\u2019s rougher voice. \u201cIt is quite the cozy little family you\u2019ve built with her, Geralt. I will wish you all well from afar.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there with Yennefer.\u201d\n\u201cOh ho ho ho, here we go\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJaskier, there\u2019s not. We both wanted it that way. The djinn, and her\u2014it wasn\u2019t real. I trust her, and need her help with Ciri. But I\u2019m not in love with her.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, well,\u201d Jaskier says. There are several loud thoughts banging around in his head at this revelation, but he chooses to ignore them. \u201cGood to know.\u201d\nGeralt is looking closely at him. Jaskier wonders if he\u2019s doing that thing\u2014sensing him, scenting him. He certainly seems like he\u2019s concentrating.\n\u201cWith you, things always moved\u2014slower,\u201d Geralt says, hesitating over the words.\n\u201cYes, whole empires have risen and fallen,\u201d Jaskier says blithely. Geralt\u2019s words register. \u201cWait\u2014with me?\u201d\n\u201cYou know that I do want you around for more than\u2026\u201d Geralt says, which answers nothing. He looks at Jaskier helplessly. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve\u2026 felt the same way.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014know,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cThe djinn brought Yennefer to me. And the djinn pushed you away. And none of it was what I really wanted,\u201d Geralt says, still speaking slowly. His hair is still faintly damp with rainwater. His head is slightly cocked to the side, to meet Jaskier\u2019s gaze, an almost entreating look. It feels like too much.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t try to find me after,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAll those times you could have tried to see me, to apologize, and you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI was giving you space afterward. I thought it would sort itself out, that I wouldn\u2019t have to\u2014\" Geralt winces\u2014\u201dApologize.\u201d\n\u201cSuch care for my heart!\u201d Jaskier says, because it is easier to stray into overdramatics. \u201cJust leaving me to nurse my heartbreak on my own.\u201d\n\u201cWas it that bad for you?\u201d Geralt\u2019s asking about the mountain, but there\u2019s something in Geralt\u2019s tone that leaves the you, too implied. He\u2019s asking about everything since, those months apart. Days and days and days of chasing him across the country. Sleepless nights. Jaskier remembers Geralt standing helpless in the doorway, Jaskier poised to jump and nothing he could do to stop it. Did he really think Jaskier\u2019s feelings could be so fickle, that he wouldn\u2019t care for long? Well, Jaskier can jump again.\n\u201cWell, look, if you must know what you did to it\u2014\u201d Jaskier says, a little worked up now, and mimes out for him exactly what Geralt did to his heart that day: stomping his foot a few times on the ground, twisting his heel into the imaginary heart for good emphasis, and then finishing it up by pretending to flip said heart onto the toe of his boot and giving it a good kick, tracing its high arc with his eyes, angling his head down and wincing exaggeratedly like he\u2019s watching the heart go tumbling down a cliff\u2019s face, catching every crevice and sharp point on the way\u2014\n\u201cThere,\u201d Jaskier says, breathing a little heavily, turning to look back at Geralt. \u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty good demonstration of the course of ev\u2014\u201d\nHe stops talking. It\u2019s not because anything has forced him to\u2014no djinn tumor on his throat, no hand over his mouth. But he turns back to Geralt and Geralt\u2014yes, he has a quirk to his lips, he\u2019s smiling, the bastard, he\u2019s really smiling at Jaskier, fondly, like he finds him amusing, and before Jaskier can think of anything to say, Geralt crosses the distance between them and pushes the fringe of Jaskier\u2019s hair back, lips meeting Jaskier\u2019s forehead. He stands there for a moment, arm hard around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders, and then he leans back, kissing Jaskier\u2019s eyes, his nose, his mouth.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOh.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s free hand comes up to Jaskier\u2019s jaw, turning Jaskier\u2019s face further into his kiss.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Geralt says, kissing down his throat.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this since\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt says, his voice deep, but he soothes away the command by licking a stripe across his collarbone.\nHis pack is swiped to the floor. Geralt backs Jaskier onto the bed, his hands heavy and urgent on Jaskier\u2019s body. His shoulders are broad beneath Jaskier\u2019s palms, his teeth teasing sharp against Jaskier\u2019s lips. It is overwhelming in all the best of ways.\nGeralt plants a knee between Jaskier\u2019s thighs, sits up to drag his shirt up over his head. Jaskier\u2019s hands go to the revealed skin, the thick bulk of his muscle, his fingers clenching into the meat of his back as Geralt lowers his head to the crook of Jaskier\u2019s neck and sucks.\n\u201cI want to have you,\u201d Geralt says, which is happily just what Jaskier wants, too. Some delirious time later, after Geralt\u2019s stripped his clothing from him, and picked him up like he\u2019s nothing, palmed his hips to turn him where he\u2019d like, Jaskier finds himself sitting naked between Geralt\u2019s powerful thighs, his back against Geralt\u2019s chest. His hair is tickling Jaskier\u2019s cheek, falling forward over Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. Otherwise, the rest of his body is bared to his sight.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Geralt says, even lower, a rumble that Jaskier can feel through his back. Geralt\u2019s hands rub up and down over Jaskier\u2019s thighs, scratch at his chest hair. He catches the lobe of Jaskier\u2019s ear in his lips as he brings a hand to Jaskier\u2019s cock, long since hard, and pumps it over the length, slowly.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Jaskier says, throwing his head back against Geralt\u2019s shoulder. He squirms his head there, his voice flying and breaking through at least three octaves, as Geralt continues to touch him, torturously slow, bringing him to the near edge and back again.\n\u201cWatch,\u201d Geralt says, tilting Jaskier\u2019s head forward, hooking his own chin over Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, and they both look as Jaskier\u2019s cockhead moves in and out of Geralt\u2019s fist, spurts wet. Jaskier\u2019s breath shudders at the sight.\nGeralt\u2019s other hand, slick with oil, sneaks down without Jaskier noticing, reaching further between his legs, pushing the slightest bit in, and Jaskier\u2019s body seems to go alight at that. He\u2019s deliciously stuck like that, played like an instrument between Geralt\u2019s hands, pushing further into Geralt\u2019s fist, and down again onto the breadth of his fingers. He spreads his legs as large as Geralt will let him, all of him open to Geralt for the taking. The whole time, Geralt\u2019s chest is working like a bellows against his back, and Jaskier can tell Geralt is near the edge himself, that he can probably smell how close Jaskier is, but he holds himself back.\n\u201cJas\u2026\u201d Geralt says, and curls his fingers a certain way, and, well. Jaskier is happy, now, to let his body take control of him, jerking in Geralt\u2019s arms as he comes hard against his stomach and chest, a blooming ache of orgasm that leaves him shivering all over. He moans as Geralt moves his hand slower over his cock, coaxing him through the last of it.\n\u201cGeralt,\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cI still want to have you,\u201d Geralt reminds him. Jaskier\u2019s manhandled around again, Geralt\u2019s hands ironsure against his skin, and he finds himself against the blanket, breathing hard into the coarseness of it. Geralt\u2019s still against his back, kissing down his spine, the slightest hint of bite. Jaskier woozily regards him over his shoulder, watching as Geralt pushes his fingers, slick with Jaskier\u2019s release, back into him. Geralt meets his eyes, and it\u2019s there\u2014the feralness in the golden eyes, but also the want for him, the desire. It makes Jaskier go boneless beneath him, watching as Geralt takes his cock in hand, slowly push in.\nGeralt\u2019s big. He wraps an arm around Jaskier\u2019s hips, tilts them up. Slowly, slowly, he takes him in inches. His free hand meanwhile move over Jaskier\u2019s skin, grounding touches, and his face is back in Jaskier\u2019s neck, pulling in deep breaths.\n\u201cIs it good?\u201d Jaskier gasps. There\u2019s no pain for him, not with Geralt\u2019s care in preparing him, only fullness, the leftover sweetness of orgasm. But for Geralt, he wants this. He wants him to want it again.\nGeralt doesn\u2019t answer, at least not in so many words. His hips snap forward, and then he\u2019s fucking in earnest, his hips pushing Jaskier up the bed. Jaskier has to grasp onto the headboard, gasping, pushing back against it for leverage. Geralt\u2019s hand grips his ass, pushes him wider, and it surprises a gasp from Jaskier\u2019s throat.\n\u201cGods, Geralt\u2014I\u2019m going to\u2014again\u2014\u201d Because yes, his cock is full again, grinding against the blankets every time Geralt thrusts in, a delicious kind of agony.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Geralt rasps, and his thrusts grow slower, long and deep, a languorous kind of fuck. Jaskier arches his back, pushes up from the headboard. Like this, he can turn his head to kiss Geralt\u2014which he does, sloppily, on the chin, and Geralt guides him back on the next thrust, kissing him full on the mouth. Like this, Geralt can lift his arm from his hips to sash across his chest, a firm grip that keeps their bodies close again\u2014no distance\u2014as Geralt goes deep and stays there, savoring the stretch. There are no words left for Jaskier to describe the pleasure in this, so he doesn\u2019t try, just moans every time Geralt grinds slow against that place inside him just right.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt says, on a great exhale, and then he pulls his hips back flush against him and comes, pressed deep, circling his hips, and Jaskier drops a hand to his cock and finishes himself off in two jerks, crying out. He pants, exhausted, as Geralt sill comes, slowly grinding the last of it into him. Geralt sighs against the knob of his back.\nThey fall forward onto the bed, Geralt\u2019s sweat-slick chest pressing him deeper. He\u2019s still inside Jaskier, which makes Jaskier wonder about witchers and how much time they need between, and he\u2019s also realizing that Geralt\u2019s grip on him is still strong, just this side of bruising. Even as he realizes it, Geralt\u2019s grip lets up, turns soft. He slips out, making Jaskier groan, and once again manhandles Jaskier\u2014this time onto his side, so he can see his face.\n\u201cMister witcher,\u201d Jaskier says, turned a little loopy, and points down. \u201cPut that thing back where you found it.\u201d\n\u201cLater, Jaskier,\u201d Geralt says. His hair is mussed, and he\u2019s smiling again, enough to show the edge of his teeth. Jaskier smirks back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll want to have you again,\u201d Geralt says, blunt. \u201cMany times.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll want to have you a few times, too,\u201d Jaskier says, his voice slurring a bit.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Geralt says, brushing his knuckles down Jaskier\u2019s side\u2014his ribs, the curve of his hips. \u201cCome to Kaer Morhen, then.\u201d\nJaskier knows how much Geralt leaves unsaid. He knows what Geralt really means, saying that.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Jaskier says, and falls asleep to Geralt\u2019s lips on his forehead again, like a blessing.\n~\nBreakfast the next morning, while Geralt is out in the stables, Yennefer comes to sit by him at the long table where he\u2019s eating.\n\u201cSeems everything has been sorted out between you two, then,\u201d she says briskly.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jaskier says, and only turning red a little.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cAnd thank the gods for it. More fodder for your songs, I assume? The white wolf and his--?\u201d\nCiri sits down then, and Yennefer breaks off.\n\u201cNot everything has to become a song,\u201d Jaskier says, breaking off a hunk of bread for Ciri, slathering it with butter.\n\u201cReally? Nothing from these past few weeks?\u201d\n\u201cA curse would make a good song,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cThe djinn, and the Nilfgaardians, and Geralt coming to save you. All of it.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Yennefer says, turning to look at Jaskier, her purple eyes intense. \u201cA curse broken by true love is definitely the stuff of songs.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jaskier begins, and stops. He remembers how he was able to fight the curse with the last of his strength, how, upon seeing Geralt, he was able to hold it off long enough for Yennefer to come. But it couldn\u2019t just be chalked up to true love. He returns her gaze, levelly. It was also broken by compassion, mercy. Goodness where he\u2019d expected none. It was Yennefer, too. \u201cTechnically, it wasn\u2019t a curse, anyways,\u201d he says. \u201cit was a wish.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe you should,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cWrite a song about it. Your songs have done wonders for Geralt\u2019s reputation, but I can\u2019t say much for mine. What\u2019s it called? \u2018Her Sweet Kiss?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOh, I love that one,\u201d Ciri breaks in.\n\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re inferring,\u201d Jaskier says brightly. \u201cAnd, dear Yennefer, if you\u2019re asking for a nice song about you, you only had to ask.\u201d Yennefer rolls her eyes, but she smiles as she turns to her breakfast.\nAfter they eat, they go out into the yard, where Geralt already has the horses saddled and ready. Geralt holds the horse\u2019s reins steady as Jaskier swings up, only a little gingerly, and seats himself.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll want to take the Merchant\u2019s Road to Novigrad\u2014\u201d Yennefer is saying.\n\u201cChange of plans,\u201d Geralt breaks in. He is looking up into Jaskier\u2019s face, and Jaskier is wondering how he\u2019d ever thought the face was expressionless, remote. He\u2019s looking harder, now, and sees all he needs to. \u201cWe\u2019ll not be going to Oxenfurt, after all.\u201d\nCiri is the only one who seems surprised by this, clapping her hands in eagerness.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have you there, too,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can have songs on those dreadfully cold nights, dances, even.\u201d\nGeralt shakes his head, leaps onto Roach. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a no,\u201d Jaskier whispers to Ciri.\n\u201cIt was a we\u2019ll see,\u201d Geralt says, more loudly.\nThat night, as they wait for a rabbit to roast, Jaskier plays a few bits on his lute, slowly retuning it. His fingers move easily over the strings.\n\u201cHey, here\u2019s a bit of a new one,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cTell me what you think.\u201d He strikes the opening chords.\n\nAnd though the road is long and the way is hard/even destiny could not separate a wolf and his\u2014\n\nJaskier does not know what will happen after Kaer Morhen. He doesn\u2019t know what will happen with Nilfgaard, the bounty on his head, Ciri\u2019s future\u2014all of their likely futures. Jaskier is only human. He does not know a lot.\nCiri claps a hand over her mouth, giggling, and Yennefer groans and leans back on her elbows.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a word,\u201d Jaskier says, winking at Ciri. \u201cA perfect word, on the tip of my tongue, if only I knew it\u2014\u201d\nGeralt is sitting silent close by him, poking the fire, his brow furrowed. Jaskier waits, gives him the time to work it out, figure out the missing word. Geralt doesn\u2019t know it yet, but then\u2014Jaskier sees the corner of his mouth soften, turns up\u2014like magic, he does."
