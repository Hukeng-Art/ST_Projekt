    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the course of the past months, after the Hyde and Goody and Crackstone and the blissful warm embrace of a (however brief) death, Wednesday comes to the realisation that her visions still don\u2019t understand the concept of  giving the whole picture. \u00a0\nAnd lately, to reasons that have still alluded her, no matter how many times she\u2019s sat up late thinking about it, they start to revolve around something  specific. Well, rather, someone.\u00a0\nMost of the time, they are mundane and asinine and make Wednesday want to rip her hair out when she\u2019s forced into the spine aching arch of a vision at the caf\u00e9 as she hands the new worker a fresh bill, to just then be shown that tomorrow Enid will find a similar ten dollar note flapping in the tire of someone\u2019s bike. Her powers will show the blonde smile wide, grabbing it and bouncing on the spot at her luck. Wednesday is at her typewriter and her neck will snap back to the ceiling, her pointer finger on the letter \u2018T\u2019, only to be frustratingly shown her best friend accidentally spilling scalding hot tea on her front as her bright blue eyes water at the edges in pain. \u00a0\nHer visions used to  mean  something, mean more than luck and stupid accidents, they used to revolve around things that were world ending- full of blood and high stakes and claws inside of flesh. She tries to brush away the pang of regret she has at her thoughts; if anything, maybe she should be thankful she\u2019s having visions of someone she enjoys the most amongst the very,  very  few she can already tolerate. \u00a0\nWednesday snaps back, pinkie hitting a wrong letter on the keys from the jarring movement as she grits her teeth in anger. \u00a0\nGrabbing her phone, like every time Enid is hurt in these visons, she slowly texts out to her friend; a warning. \u00a0\nAre you making tea?\u00a0\nThe bubbles of Enid\u2019s response are almost instantaneous. Wednesday narrows her eyes. Pathetic. But she\u00a0still tries to hide the flutter in her stomach at the eagerness of the other girl, how she\u2019s only ever like that with her.\u00a0\nwoah! Enid replies, and the brunette can almost see in her mind those wide, crystal eyes. how'd you know?\u00a0\nLucky guess.\u00a0\nAt the confused face emoji Enid sends back, Wednesday elaborates. \u00a0\nThat was a joke. Obliviously, my visions showed me that you\u2019re going to spill it down your front when you make it to the quad. It will burn. Severely.\u00a0\nWednesday detests that when she sends it, there is no satisfaction at the prospect of third degree burns, there is nothing  fun about Enid in pain, and Wednesday is absolutely baffled at the thought. She detests even more, though, the name Enid has for her that shows above her message. \u201cBestie\u201d it says, with a stupid, toe-curling pink heart emoji right next to it and a ghost emoji. If it was anyone else, Wednesday would have cracked their phone in half. But it\u2019s Enid, so it stays. \u00a0\n  thank you!!! you're the best x  \u00a0\nThe brunette tilts her head. Best at what? Wednesday briefly thinks. Friendship?  I am succeeding at high grades in friendship,  Wednesday thinks.  Which is both a normal and healthy thing to want. \u00a0\nThen another more glaring observation is hitting Wednesday as she types back, as quick as she can. Phone keyboards are entirely different to typewriters, she\u2019s starting to find. \u00a0\nWait, you don\u2019t drink tea.\u00a0\nWednesday watches the bubbles appear and reappear from Enid\u2019s indecisiveness Her lips tilt ever so slightly on a smirk; making Enid flustered will never tire or grow old. She has no time to self-evaluate how she remembers Enid doesn\u2019t drink tea, rather if she had the choice, the other girl would inject coffee into her veins. \u00a0\n  nope! it\u00a0was for you. you only drink it when you write, and you\u2019re writing, sooo  \u00a0\nWednesday does not blush when the text appears. She doesn\u2019t. She forces the blood back into her body and from her cheeks with a tiny, confused frown. Ever since the hug, ever since burying into that soft spot of Enid\u2019s shoulder and smelling that thick, rusty smell of blood and her shampoo and something entirely uniquely Enid, Wednesday has increasingly found it difficult, so bone challengingly  difficult , to not think about it. Maybe that\u2019s why her visions have manifested like this, she thinks. Maybe that\u2019s why Enid is even in her visions, because she won\u2019t leave her thoughts, even the safety and warmth of Wednesday\u2019s nightmares. \u00a0\nEnid is spilling into every tiny crevice of Wednesday\u2019s every thought; like a pill a person would take to sleep and fall into a thick unconsciousness that blankets over your mind, something insomniacs take to dream. Wednesday halts in her thoughts with a panicked stutter in her typing, because these musings are dangerous for an Addams; these musings, where you crave a sweet and painful unconsciousness with another on your mind, equals-\u00a0\nWednesday quickly snaps the carriage of the typewriter onto a new line, eyes widening at the revelation. Side effects of this sleeping pill may include: thinking about your werewolf best friend who mauled your somewhat but also absolutely not boyfriend for you and came back from it covered in thick, shining blood and hugged you so tightly you forgot what it felt like before it. \u00a0\nWednesday blinks at the blank line, lips parted softly. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHi!\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday finally looks up when Enid enters their room, there are two takeout drinks in her hand; one definitely coffee and the other tea. She can see from here the tea bag tag sway with the blonde\u2019s movement, and schools her features when she notices Enid made exactly what she likes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cGod, it\u2019s freezing out there!\u201d Wednesday hums noncommittedly as Enid places her tea down in front of her, looking up when the taller girl bounces on her toes. It\u2019s started snowing as Christmas break edges closer and closer, and even a werewolf can\u2019t escape the biting cold. Enid\u2019s nose is pink from the weather, pale skin flushed and pretty. There is melting snow on her school uniform. She almost looks like a corpse coming back to life; Wednesday\u2019s heart flutters at the thought. \u00a0\nWednesday doesn\u2019t answer; simply grabs the tea with a grateful hum and Enid is used to these silences, all too happy and wanting to fill them. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSo, you had another vision?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid asks eagerly, and Wednesday lets the scalding hot tea burn down her throat as she takes a sip. Just how she likes it. \u201cThey are becoming increasingly benign.\u201d She says flatly, and doesn\u2019t miss how Enid deflates with a pout; when her bottom lip juts out like that, Wednesday feels a thousand spiders swarm her lower stomach. Like they weaved their home in the pit of the organ and crawled the length of\u00a0the brunette\u2019s jugular, making her throat close up. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDamn, so I\u2019m not gonna find like, a hundred bucks on the street tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyebrow twitches, tilting her head. \u201cEnid, my prophetic visions are not a tool for you to benefit from.\u201d\u00a0\nThe other girl winces, clutching her coffee in two hands. \u201cI know! I-I know, it\u2019s just,\u201d Enid smiles shyly. From here, Wednesday can see her canines peeking out and is shoved into the memory of their hug, how much blood still dripped from the ivory blades when the blonde cuddled into her neck. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the subject of a psychic's visions before. It\u2019s kinda cool! You know?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday narrows her eyes, tries to ignore the flutter of those eight legs inside of her belly at Enid\u2019s smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fluke,\u201d Wednesday says simply, turning back to her typewriter as she takes a sip of her tea again. Scalding. That\u2019ll show the spiders. \u201cDon\u2019t get attached. It\u2019s unbecoming.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid softly smiles to her, knows much better by now, what Wednesday means by those words.  I don\u2019t want to disappoint you.  Wednesday never could. It\u2019s impossible now. After that hug, Enid hopes Wednesday knows just how much she means to her. She hopes Wednesday knows she wouldn\u2019t get covered in blood and entrails just for anyone; she covered her teeth in blood for her. She hopes Wednesday understands what that means. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo days later and the visions don\u2019t stop.\u00a0\nEnid is now used to the messages she receives in class from Wednesday. Even from in front of her, the brunette sneakily texts her under the desk that:  The quiz\u00a0our new teacher is handing you will give you a paper cut  and  Yoko is going to ask for the answer to number 42. You won\u2019t know it. It\u2019s Golden Dewdrop. And every time there is this insane, debilitating, swarm of butterflies in Enid\u2019s stomach at the messages that has her smiling and biting her lip. \u00a0\nBut then it\u2019s halfway through their new dissection assignment that Enid is afforded a full-blown  Wednesday vision. It happens just after she grabs the scalpel, stomach churning at the pig's heart that stares back at her. Enid gags, shaking her head as her blonde hair moves with the action. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYoko,\u201d She says, whimpering slightly as she holds out the scalpel to her friend. \u201cYou do it. I can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\nThe vampire smirks, snorting. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken down a  Hyde Enid, it\u2019s a pig's heart.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThat looks like it\u2019s still beating!\u201d Enid says, gesturing to the pinned open organ.\u00a0\n\u00a0It isn\u2019t, she\u2019s just dramatic and still squeamish at blood. Yoko sighs in resignation, and before she can rebut again, Enid is jumping slightly in her seat as suddenly, the flash of Wednesday seizing in front of her begins; thrust into an electrifying vision that has Enid\u2019s hairs standing up on end. From here, the blonde gasps worriedly at how  visceral this one is, because her best friend\u2019s neck snaps so quickly she\u2019s almost looking back at Enid from in front of her. Her eyes roll back, balls of white glaring to the ceiling as Enid stands up. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWednesday?\u201d She worryingly calls, and Xavier next to her catches the other girl's elbow in concern as her nails dig into the desk, one of the scalpel\u2019s trapped between her palm and the surface. By now, the rest of the class has paused at the commotion as the teacher tries to calm everyone down, and Enid worriedly bounces on her toes waiting for it to end. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, Wednesday?\u201d Enid grows increasingly worried, heart beating painfully in her chest in distress at how the brunette\u2019s eyes haven\u2019t rolled back, her neck still craned to the ceiling as she shakes. Enid reaches out from behind her, warm palm settling on her bicep as she squeezes. Tears sheen across her blue eyes. \u201cWednesday, can you hear me? Are you-\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday snaps back, chocolate obsidian eyes returning to normal as she almost  immediately turns in her seat. Her face is its usual stoic fa\u00e7ade, but her eyes are so wide and alarmed and shaken that it takes Enid by surprise as she parts her lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWed-\u201d\u00a0\nBefore the blonde can speak, her best friend is up and out of her chair rounding Enid\u2019s. She has no time to question anything, because Wednesday is grabbing the scalpel out of her hand with a quickness a werewolf couldn\u2019t even catch up to. Enid blinks back with wide blue eyes as Wednesday slams it on the table in front of her. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d Wednesday says, and Enid catches this tiny shake to her voice that her face isn\u2019t betraying. But her eyes are like windows, deep and worried as the other girls\u2019 eyebrows furrow in concern.\n\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d Wednesday tries to collect herself, clenching her jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t do this dissection.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Enid squeaks out, shaking her head quickly. Wednesday is oozing something that has the young werewolf\u2019s head spinning, something that feels like protection and equal parts fury; Enid is suspended by it. \u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday nods ever so slightly, schooling her features as she addresses Yoko looking to them from beneath her sunglasses. \u201cYou,\u201d The brunette says, making Yoko raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou are Xavier\u2019s partner now.\u201d\u00a0\nYoko snorts, resting her chin in her hand as she regards Wednesday. \u201cAnd do I get a say in this?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday tilts her head, swallowing back a nasty comment about vampires she has stored in her brain for situations like this.  You won\u2019t be able to say anything when I shove your mouth with garlic. But she refrains, only because Yoko is Enid\u2019s friend. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d She says, staring back as a tiny growl forms around the word. Enid looks between them with wide ocean eyes, ping ponging back and forth. \u201cThis is non-negotiable. Move, or you will be moved.\u201d\u00a0\nYoko finds this entire ordeal amusing, grinning with her fangs as she holds her hands up and gathers her books, sitting next to Xavier who raises an eyebrow in question.\u00a0\nWhen Wednesday settles, Enid blinks furiously to gather her bearings. Her heart is practically skyrocketing from her ribcage at Wednesday acting like that,  for her. \u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s voice then brings Enid from her thoughts, holding her pale hand out wordlessly as she stares at the pig's heart, lips spreading into a delighted smile.  Oh god,  Enid thinks.  That smile should be illegal. The way her lips spread against her teeth, how rare it is, how she has a dimple in her left cheek that is bigger than the other. Enid blushes as she stares into the side of Wednesday\u2019s face and commits that smile to memory, how wolfish and beautiful it is.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cScalpel.\u201d Wednesday demands, and Enid hurriedly hands it over, almost dropping it in her haste. \u00a0\nShe forces herself to look at Wednesday\u2019s cheek, not only because of the incision the brunette makes into the flesh, but because Enid finds she can\u2019t actually look away. Wednesday\u2019s smile turns back to stoic slowly, focusing on the task at hand. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThanks,\u201d Enid says softly, twisting her lips as she plays with her fingers to hide her lovesick smile. Wednesday frowns ever so slightly without looking away from the heart between them. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m confused on what I\u2019m receiving gratitude for.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid smiles, snorting. She nudges Wednesday with her elbow and because they\u2019re friends now, Enid doesn\u2019t fear of her reaction. Instead of being stabbed thirty-two times at the action, Wednesday simply looks to the touch and away again like she was hiding how it made her feel, trying to avoid Enid\u2019s gentle smile. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cFor knowing I hate this kinda stuff and doing it for me.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday makes a cut along an aorta, but at the words slips in her concentration. She nicks it too deep, and a spurt of laten pressured blood spits against Wednesday\u2019s cheek. She blinks once at the feeling, reaching up with her thumb and gathering it on the pad. Enid, for once, doesn\u2019t immediately gag at the sight when Wednesday puts it in her mouth and hums at the taste. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cType A.\u201d She demounts, and for some unknown reason Enid physically swoons at Wednesday\u2019s educated observation. What can Enid say, she\u2019s a sucker for nerds. \u201cI am not doing this project for you,\u201d Wednesday continues, cutting a piece of fat away. \u201cI had a vision.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d Enid says slowly in amusement, her pink lips spread across her face and Wednesday frowns softly at those spiders inside of her again. \u201cPretty hard to miss.\u201d\u00a0\nThe brunette\u2019s lips twitch on a ghost of a smile. She likes it when Enid is sarcastic. \u201cYou cut yourself deeply on the scalpel,\u201d Wednesday says deadpan, and watches how Enid gulps worriedly at the description. \u201cAlmost to the bone. You passed out at the amount of blood, hitting your head on the way down, leading to a concussion.\u201d \u00a0\nEnid parts her mouth\u00a0in shock as Wednesday retells the vision, watches how the other girl\u2019s eyebrows furrow under her dark bangs this slight amount at the memory. \u201cYour deterrence to anything macabre confuses me.\u201d Wednesday says, making Enid softly smile. Yeah, that\u2019ll never change. \u201cAnd as much as the idea of you covered in blood entices me,\u201d\u00a0\nEnid  flushes red, throat drying up as Wednesday steals all of the air inside of her lungs. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI abhor the kind where it is yours.\u201d She says simply, and her voice has pitched ever so slightly in softness. Enid feels goosebumps line her skin at how Wednesday said that as if that isn\u2019t the most  romantic thing an Addams could say, as if Enid wouldn\u2019t see through her words and right into the heart of what Wednesday is actually trying to convey.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou...do?\u201d The blonde says softly, slowly, biting her lip briefly as the other girl hums. Her scalpel is paused in it\u2019s cuts as Wednesday stares into the open organ, the gears in her brain working overdrive. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d She says simply, making Enid beam like a thousand suns just blinded her vision. Wednesday immediately turns to her, pushing the scalpel threateningly into Enid\u2019s side as the werewolf squeaks in surprise. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cUse this information against me, Enid, and I will not hesitate to make my vision come true.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods, still smiling, so wide her eyes crinkle at the edges. Wednesday\u2019s gaze softens, she\u2019s so devastatingly pretty \u2013 like the kaleidoscope of colours that bursts behind your eyes when your stabbed by a resurrected pilgrim. Yes. That feeling, Wednesday surmounts. The feeling of almost dying and being breathed back to life. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI promise,\u201d Enid says, leaning closer. Wednesday has to lean a little back with parted lips so the scalpel actually doesn\u2019t cut her. Yet Enid moving forward like that means everything, it means:  I trust you so much that I know you actually won\u2019t hurt me. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cBut this means you love me, right?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks quickly up from the tool in Enid\u2019s stomach with wide eyes; from behind the dark curtain of her hair, she knows her gaze must be love struck, must be dizzying and foolish like how her father gazes at her mother in some sick, gut churning display of devotion. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI would kill for you,\u201d Wednesday says, scalpel now loose in her grip but still hard against the plane of Enid\u2019s stomach. The other girl blushes fiercely. \u201cI would die for you.\u201d Wednesday continues, she can\u2019t stop the word vomit now that it\u2019s here. She thinks of their hug.  She thinks of their hug. \u00a0\nBut here Enid is, and in some divine way she knows what Wednesday means, without even having to ask as she grins. \u201cThat, in Addam\u2019s language, means yes.\u201d She says smugly, but her blue eyes are so soft around the edges that Wednesday blinks back to them in clarity. Yes, she thinks. Yes, it does. \u00a0\nEnid\u2019s gaze softens, moving closer and bringing Wednesday into a hug. Now, the scalpel is sharp against the werewolf\u2019s stomach, but neither pull away. Enid presses her smile into Wednesday\u2019s shoulder, canines peeking through from her happiness.\n\u00a0\u201cI love you too, Wednesday.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday blinks furiously behind her dark hair. Instead of holding back, her grip loosens on the scalpel, and she buries her chin and face just a little deeper into the crook of Enid\u2019s neck. Here, she can still smell the blood, the dirt, the panic at almost losing Enid and how much that made Wednesday realise she cares for her. \u00a0\nMaybe the visions were telling Wednesday something this whole time, screaming at her from that tiny part of her mind she tries to lock away. Maybe they were saying: love her. Love her. Before it\u2019s too late. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWednesday is confronted an hour later after class by Yoko, by her sharp teeth and knowing smile as she runs into her, rounding the corner of the building. Wednesday steps back, regarding the taller girl coldly as she hugs her books to her chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d The vampire starts, smirking. \u201cWhen were the rest of us going to hear about this new development?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday narrows her eyes in confusion, looking Yoko up and down with a tilt of her head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh, come on Addams,\u201d Yoko says, looking down to the smaller girl through her black glasses. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire, I can practically  hear your heartbeat when she\u2019s around.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday freezes up, and not the fun kind, not the brief spasm her muscles do before she fakes rigor mortis, when she slows her heart down until it\u2019s almost non-existent. It\u2019s the kind where if anything, it makes her heartbeat speed up , and the knowing smirk she is afforded from the other girl makes Wednesday want to stake Yoko through the heart and pin it to her murder board. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe only tell-tale sign that the words got to her is the tiny, almost unnoticeable, twitch to her right eyebrow. \u201cI resent that observation.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWell it\u2019s true,\u201d Yoko says, scoffing. \u201cYour heartbeat like, drowns out every other student when Enid is around.\u201d Wednesday says nothing to this, instead she clenches her jaw at Yoko\u2019s keen vampiric senses. Yes, her heart  does  elevate when Enid smiles to her, when she laughs, but that is for Wednesday to know and for her to  only, know. \u00a0\nBefore she can rebut, Yoko is kindly smiling to her, and Wednesday doesn\u2019t know what to do when on the receiving end of it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cJust, don\u2019t hurt her?\u201d She says, and Wednesday\u2019s eyes flash at the mere notion. \u201cShe\u2019s like, the last good person in the world, or whatever. And her heart is one giant green-flag.\u201d \u00a0\nWednesday stands a little straighter, because this whole conversation sounds like herself and Enid are  dating, and the daydream of that reality has Wednesday\u2019s heart soaring. When she answers, her dark eyes glint in warning. \u201cI would sooner let you turn me into a blood sucking parasite than hurt her.\u201d\u00a0\nYoko blinks back at the monotone, yet somehow passionate words, Wednesday utters. \u201cDamn,\u201d She whistles. \u201cBeing a vampire that bad?\u201d\u00a0\nAt this, Wednesday\u2019s face scrunches up in disgust, the most emotion Yoko has ever seen from her. \u201cThe idea of living forever exhausts me.\u201d She says, and okay, fair. \u201cBut I would endure an eternity of suffering if Enid remained unharmed.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd with that, Wednesday brushes past her and out of her eyesight. And Yoko is left to stand and blink in shock. Okay, so her friend is forever going to be safe with the goth psychic, that\u2019s reassuring.  But fuck  , she thinks, shaking her head in amusement,  that Addam\u2019s love is no joke. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe visions, these bright electrifying prophecies, don\u2019t even cease when Winter break starts. If anything, for Wednesday, her  Enid visions, as Thing so frustratingly calls them, persist even more and turn even more bright with clarity the closer the holiday edges towards them.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast night, she cracked her spine and exerted the whites of her eyes at a vision of Enid in the snow, because Wednesday reached out the stain glass window of their room to touch the falling snowflakes and carelessly thought she was safe . Thought indulging in this brief, icy feeling would be enough to distract her from her incessant and nagging thoughts of her best friend.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t. Wednesday watches in her vision as the blonde slip on the ice, right onto her wrist, wincing as pain shoots up the tendon and Enid tears up in the pillowy snow.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen, in the morning while showering, Wednesday reaches for the soap and when her fingertips caress the bar, her neck snaps to the ceiling. She sees Enid in the school\u2019s bathroom get shot in the eye with a malfunctioning liquid soap dispenser; the blonde flaps her hands around uselessly and whimpers as Yoko laughs at her friend\u2019s misfortune.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t stop. It seems every day Wednesday is saving Enid from increasingly interesting and weird ways to injure herself. Her texts are normal now, sometimes she\u2019s tempted to just stick by Enid\u2019s side every minute of the day as a preventative cause.\u00a0\u00a0\n You leave your essay on your desk tomorrow morning and fail. Don\u2019t forget it.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd,\u00a0\n This one is just confoundingly stupid. Wednesday texts, still utterly dumbfounded at this particular vision and her best friend\u2019s accident-prone body.\u00a0\u00a0\n You trip outside our room and break your nose, gushing the floor with blood.  Then, as an after-thought (that makes her eye twitch at how much it makes her feel like she  cares ) Wednesday adds:\u00a0\u00a0\n Tie your shoelaces triple knot today. \u00a0\nShe\u2019s always met with a multitude of love heart emojis that make her shiver, and a thousand thank you\u2019s from Enid\u2019s grateful typing fingers.\u00a0\u00a0\nBottom line, Wednesday\u2019s visions are still Enid Enid Enid; she hasn\u2019t had one normal episode not centred around her best friend. Wednesday turns to every book she can find, even so far as asking Xavier to check the Nightshade library on everything pertaining psychics and mediums and precognition. Nothing. There is nothing on Raven visions. The only thing close to mentioning something similar to Wednesday\u2019s dilemma, is a chapter in a book the brunette found in the school\u2019s library.\u00a0\u00a0\n The Psychic Phenomena \u2013 the arcane gift of premonition. \u00a0\nShe\u2019s there in the building now, sunken into the leather lounge across from Enid. The smell of old books, air conditioning, and stained wood floors overwhelms her; not as much as the blonde\u2019s perfume though. Sickening sweet, Wednesday can smell it from here. It makes her gag. It makes her swoon. It makes Wednesday yearn to hug her again.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnid, across the way on one of the desks, is getting last minute studying done before the holidays with Xavier and Yoko. And every so often when Wednesday looks up, she catches the other girl staring at her with those soft, azure eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnid never tries to hide it, she simply smiles and waves softly, looking back down to her books as she twirls a feathery pen in her hands and blows a bubble of her pink chewing gum, as pink as her cheeks.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday blinks back every time, cooling her face to remain unaffected. Her hands tighten around the pages in barely hidden affection; jaw clenching as her heart races in her chest. Thing on her shoulder, every time, waves back and signs kindly \u2013 and it makes Enid beam and knock her knees together in happiness.\u00a0\nWednesday is reminded of her other vision in the morning, when she pulled her long socks on and tied her shoes. At the touch of her knee, she was thrust into another premonition that starred the one and only Enid Sinclair. She quickly pulls out her and the other girl\u2019s messages, typing quickly before she forgets it.\u00a0\n Under the table, above your knee. Gum. A lot of it. \u00a0\nShe watches Enid receive the message, smile, send her a happy thumbs up from across the way and Wednesday quirks her eyebrow that she received it. Spiders, again, Wednesday realises.; curling into her chest and laying eggs when Enid bites her lip on a smile.\u00a0\nLooking back down to her book, Wednesday focuses on the words, swallowing those arachnids back into their home.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe novel states: \u201c If a seers premonitions begin to take a liking to certain subjects, be it animals or family members or world politics, these visions can be rooted in a desire to understand the unknown.\u201d \u00a0\nWednesday knows lots of things, thousands. She knows exactly how to skin a rabbit or load her father\u2019s shot gun; she knows the entire chemical makeup of a hornet. She knows Enid doesn\u2019t like tea, and takes her coffee with three sugars; she knows yesterday she heard someone comment on her best friend\u2019s face scar and almost flayed them alive with a burning intensity that lit her soul alight.\u00a0\n \u201cPsychics rely heavily on what they know amidst prophecies that they don\u2019t recognise \u2013 yet you must not construe fact with desire. If you see a future filled with fire, do not immediately assume water has left the earth. \u00a0\n Understand you are seeing a specific future that pertains to what you don\u2019t understand, and if a seers visions persist (can be months, weeks) with this certain object of desire, it\u2019s likely due to a mental, or emotional, block. This phenomenon has not been widely studied, and in turn, do not be alarmed if you are driven mad.\u201d \u00a0\nWednesday purses her lips ever so slightly at this. Driven mad. Enticing, but this small passage amongst a sea of books leaves Wednesday even more at a loss at what she\u2019s experiencing. Thing scrambles down to the small table in front of the younger girl, signing quickly and jaggedly as Wednesday leans forwards a little to read.\u00a0\u00a0\n Emotional block.  He says, tapping the letters of  her  name on the table.  Enid. \u00a0\nWednesday bites her tongue, tastes metal and sulphur and cherries from her lipstick. Snapping the book shut and shoving it into her bag to borrow, she answers with a dangerous monotone lilt to her voice.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDo you like having fingers, Thing?\u201d\u00a0\nThing flattens against the table, like a kicked puppy. Wednesday is thrust into the memory of a knife through his palm, of her terror, and she relents with a tiny, pained furrow of her brows at the reminder.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn apology, she opens her hand up for Thing to scurry amongst. He springs up to rest against her shoulder, tapping her in thanks.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen, without a second thought, she\u2019s beelining to Enid and the others table. Wednesday doesn\u2019t miss how the other girl brightens at her presence; it\u2019s still confusing to Wednesday to have someone in her life that doesn\u2019t immediately gag and scream at the sight of her. Wednesday also doesn\u2019t miss how her own heart clenches at the sight of Enid excited to see her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cXavier,\u201d She says, and Enid\u2019s eyes widen as she furrows her brow in question. Said boy across from her looks even more confused than her best friend. \u201cCome.\u201d Wednesday wordless says, spinning on her heel to the Fiction section. \u00a0\nHer choice in person is calculated. If she is to say this, if she is to  admit it out loud, Xavier will do. Wednesday will never admit it, staple her eyes open and make her watch Pitch Perfect and she still wouldn\u2019t, but her and Xavier are more alike than she is keen to admit.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen he follows, albeit extremely confused, he hikes up his bag on his shoulder, scratching his eyebrow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cUh, what\u2019s u-\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou once said there is nothing to like about me.\u201d Wednesday says straight to the point, and watches the taller boy stutter on an embarrassed laugh. They\u2019ve said their apologies, in their own way, but Xavier still cringes at the harsh words he said to her in the Nightshade\u2019s lair. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s fair, Wednesday thinks, she did after all send him to prison. Her lips tilt in mirth at the memory.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d He breathes out, pursing his lips. His hair is even longer now as he grows it out from the cold. \u201cDid I not...apologise for that already?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday narrows her eyes. \u201cNo, you did, but you were right.\u201d\u00a0\nXavier blinks in shock.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThere is little about me that is appealing to the average person.\u201d Wednesday says, without pause, without hesitation. \u00a0\nIf anything, her voice is painted with the notion that she is pleased with this fact, not before she elaborates with a thoughtful expression, the only emotion flashing past her face told in the furrow of her brows. She\u2019s looking a little to the left of Xavier, not meeting his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI am standoffish, rude, cunning. The very morals I have do not invoke the feelings of someone to be trusted.\u201d\u00a0\nXavier snorts, shoving his hand into his pant pocket and shrugging. \u201cEnid trusts you.\u201d\u00a0\nAgainst Wednesday\u2019s will, her better judgement, the words have her eyes softening, impossibly so.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d She hums, eyes flicking to over his shoulder. He follows her gaze, smiles knowingly at how Wednesday\u2019s dark eyes dilate when Enid\u2019s laugh punctures the bookshelves they are amongst. Yeah, he thinks, when he looks to them in this light, they work. Wednesday and Enid. Kinda weirdly poetic, he thinks. \u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s glinting eyes puncture Xavier again, looking to him piercingly from beneath her hair. For how short she is, the girl is frighteningly intimidating. \u201cI am telling you this because I wish to understand why.\u201d\u00a0\nXavier clears his throat, rocking on his heels. \u201cWhy...what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhy my visions are becoming increasingly confusing.\u201d Wednesday says, and a lightbulb flickers inside of Xavier's teenage boy brain. The brunette\u2019s neck tenses, like she was physically swallowing bile; as if the words biting from behind her teeth begging to be said were physically paining her. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhy Enid likes me,\u201d Wednesday settles on, blinking once from beneath her bangs. \u201cAnd why I am not detested by the mere fact.\u201d \u00a0\nHe smirks, shaking his head. He looks to her patiently, pointedly, as if Wednesday should be realising  herself just from what she said. Wednesday doesn\u2019t like how her unemotional stare doesn\u2019t even affect him anymore. He has a knowing smile on his face Wednesday loathes. She grits her teeth, jawline accentuated by her growing anger. Thing on her shoulder pats her to put her at ease.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWednesday...\u201d He says, his smile turning into a laugh at the other girl\u2019s expense. \u201cI think what you\u2019re experiencing is feelings.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks slightly away from Xavier's gaze, expression blank but eyes betraying exactly what she\u2019s feeling. He can see it. This is Wednesday Addam\u2019s blushing, without any actual colour staining her cheeks as they turn a sickly pale. Xavier leans against a bookshelf, both hands in his pockets as he kindly regards his friend.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cEnid likes everybody.\u201d He shrugs. At this, Wednesday feels a little prick of pain on her pin cushion heart. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cBut you\u2019re...I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re Wednesday.\u201d She looks back to him, head tilted in question. \u201c Everybody\u00a0sees it, she\u2019s different with you. She likes you because you\u2019re so hard  to like.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday internally preens. Good.\u00a0\u00a0\nXavier continues, seeing that ghost of a satisfied smile on the other girl\u2019s lips at his words. \u201cBut I think she likes you so much because, believe it or not Wednesday,\u201d He shrugs. \u201cShe knows you like her too. A lot.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks to him then, scrutinising the truth to his words, the twitch in his face muscles, the shift of his gaze. She can\u2019t tell that he\u2019s lying, so far, he looks like he\u2019s speaking with truth. This fact has Wednesday completely at a loss at what to do at the feelings in her chest, so she just blinks, the wires in her mind working double time to come to an understanding.\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, like she insinuated the other day when Enid hugged her with a scalpel to her stomach, Wednesday...loves her.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe revelation isn\u2019t as terrifying as she thought.\u00a0\u00a0\nXavier must notice Wednesday\u2019s internal dilemma, because he smirks and folds his arms. \u201cSo, are you gonna tell me what\u2019s up with your visions too?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday turns her head and narrows her eyes at him. Then, says simply;\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cLately, the only thing I see of my future, is Enid.\u201d \u00a0\nShe blanks. Tries to school her features. The words were so unintentionally loud, straight from her heart. Loud like an arrow in her shoulder. Loud like Enid\u2019s tired, blood-soaked breath in her ears as they hugged. Loud like the howl of her best friend to the moon.\u00a0\nXavier raises an eyebrow.  Huh. For the first time since meeting her, Wednesday seems awkward, but he can only tell by how her eyes shift away from his gaze across her despondent expression.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cLike, only having visions of her?\u201d He prods.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d The brunette clarifies, a tired almost inaudible sigh leaving her lips. Thankful, she\u2019s so fucking thankful for the distraction of how ear deafening her chest is becoming. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThey are always of her getting hurt, or tiny inconveniences to her day. I used to see visions of teeth, and claws. Now, only Enid...sometimes both.\u201d Wednesday says, a tiny tilt of her head as she recalls a memory. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThe other week, I envisioned her accidentally cutting me with her claws as I scared her entering the room.\u201d \u00a0\nWednesday's lips flick into a shadow of a smile, recalling that sharp stab of exhilarating pain that had her breath shortening in her chest in her vision, and no matter how many times Enid profusely apologised, Wednesday was unperturbed. She thought of Enid\u2019s aversion to blood, all things gore, and how the other girl didn\u2019t bat an eye at Wednesday\u2019s.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWednesday delivers this not with irritation, not with disdain touching her words, but rather the tone of a person who sounds a little wistful. Xavier huffs on a laugh.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cRight. So, your powers are...what?\u201d He says, raising an eyebrow. \u201cLetting you protect your werewolf girlfriend from tripping over her shoelaces? Giving you a paper cut?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyes flick quickly to the other boy\u2019s, jaw clenching as she glares to him. \u201cGirlfriend?\u201d\u00a0\n(Wednesday is trapped. There is a book next to her foot she keeps accidentally shuffling as she lets that  word  settle in her stomach. The spiders weave it into their web, permanently, they stick it to the underside of Wednesday\u2019s ribcage and form a safe, warm, beautiful cocoon around it.)\u00a0\nShe steps closer, making Xavier swallow harshly. Grabbing the lapels of his school jacket and shoving him hard against the bookshelf, Wednesday bores her eyes into his soul.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI was never here. Breathe a word of this to anyone,\u201d She threatens, \u201cand I will make balloon animals from your intestines.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\nBefore Xavier can answer, the object of Wednesday\u2019s visions peaks her head into the aisle of bookshelves with an excited smile. Before the brunette can even realise her eyes have done it, they\u2019re softening around the edges as Enid bounces into view. Blonde, multicoloured hair, pink lips. Blue eyes. As blue as the lips of a cadaver.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cMy wolf pack and Yoko\u2019s clan just started a snowball fight!\u201d Enid gleefully announces, bouncing on her toes, not even phased at the other girl threatening Xavier. \u00a0\nWednesday thinks of the tiny, thousands of snowflakes that will get caught in her hair, thinks of how they\u2019ll look like against Enid\u2019s freckles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWell? Come on, Wednesday! I  need  you on my team.\u201d She pleads, and before the smaller girl can react, she\u2019s being pulled by her hand and out the library doors by Enid\u2019s warm fingers; a sea of students follow, like fireflies to the commotion of all-out war.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday blinks when they make it to the freezing air of the quad, tilts her head as Enid immediately hauls their bodies to take cover behind an upturned table. Wednesday lets herself be rag dolled, knows if it was anyone else, she\u2019d bite their fingers off one by one. But, like every other time, it\u2019s Enid.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday was right, when she looks to the taller girl, there is snow stuck in her hair and it reminds her of the thick ash of fire as the school burned; the delightful and prickling sensation of being pierced with an arrow and almost shot. It\u2019s beautiful.  She\u2019s beautiful.\u00a0\nThen she realises, this is the exact image of Enid falling into the snow in her vision. Wednesday imperceptibly widens her eyes in worry, watching almost in slow motion how Enid jumps up from behind their cover to throw a snowball.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cEnid,\u201d She hisses. \u201cWait, yo-\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s call is cut off as the blonde is solidly socked in the chest, gasping as the force has her toppling on her feet. She tries to catch herself, but it\u2019s too late as Enid loses her footing. She squeals as Wednesday springs up from her crouched position, immediately holding out her arms to catch her best friend\u2019s falling body.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the ground is icy and Wednesday jumped up all too fast, and suddenly she is landing hard on her back with a grunt forced from her lungs as Enid\u2019s entire weight falls onto Wednesday\u2019s front. Lying on her back in the snow, the brunette blinks at the suffocating weight of a young werewolf on her lungs and thinks, blissfully, this is so much more lovely than the feeling of being buried alive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Enid says, scrambling to lean up and over Wednesday\u2019s body worriedly. \u00a0\nHer claws are out in panic, clenched in the snow by Wednesday\u2019s head. The brunette blinks back up to her, swallowing thickly, her face betraying nothing of her beating heart.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cAre you okay? Did I hurt you?\u201d Enid fires off, blue eyes sheening with concern. \u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyes flicker back and forth across the blonde\u2019s face as she regards the other girl. Wednesday suddenly sits up, back straight and spine stiff like a vampire awakening from its coffin slumber. Enid quickly scrambles back with wide eyes as the shorter girl turns her head to her.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey\u2019re sharing the same air, almost nose to nose, and the blonde blushes furiously at Wednesday\u2019s deep eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cFor a werewolf,\u201d The other girl says, brushing off snow from her uniform and her arms. \u201cYou have surprisingly pitiful reflexes.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid smiles shyly, sitting back on her haunches to give the other girl room. She was so close to her lips it shook her entire foundations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYeah, I get that a lot.\u201d She flushes, turning back to the snow and fully behind the table. Again, she wordlessly grabs Wednesday\u2019s hand to make her follow, and the brunette is finding that each time she does it, she expects a fury of being man handled to overwhelm her. It doesn\u2019t. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201c But,\u201d Enid gathers snow in her hands, undeterred by the cold from her werewolf heat as she grins; this glint of anticipation and competition in her gaze. \u201cI took down a Hyde, so I think it like, cancels out my clumsiness, right?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday hums distractedly, too preoccupied with the excitement that floods her at Enid\u2019s competitive side showing, how she makes snowballs and bounces on her haunches getting prepared to rain fire. Wednesday finds she\u2019s endeared, disgustingly in love, at the image of Enid with mischief in her eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThis is so fun. Yoko won\u2019t know what hit her!\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday watches, enraptured and kneeling next to Enid, as she hauls a snowball over the table and ducks back down; squealing in glee. Wednesday tilts her head, blinking, trying to focus on anything but the raging swarm inside of her.\u00a0\u00a0\nHm. So, this is love, Wednesday thinks. This is why shrike\u2019s impale their prey on thorns for their mates; this is why when Wednesday looks to Enid, she thinks if she could, she\u2019d dissect pig\u2019s hearts for her until the end of time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI fail to see how this constitutes as fun.\u201d Wednesday says, stoic as ever. \u201cLeaving razors inside them would be more effective. It\u2019s how Pugsly and I played.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid looks to her, snorting on a laugh. Wednesday\u2019s morbid comments don\u2019t get her anymore, she loves them, because it\u2019s so Wednesday; and because the way she actually means it makes Enid love her even more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d The blonde says, picking up a snowball and placing it in Wednesday\u2019s hands. The brunette looks down to it, heart stuttering in her chest at the warmth of Enid, and the freezing bite of the snow. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThink of it this way. This ,\u201d Enid holds up Wednesday\u2019s hand holding the snowball, grinning as she speaks the other girl\u2019s language. \u201cis a deadly, compact ball of frozen water. If thrown hard enough, by someone with murderous intent-\u201d Enid looks pointedly to Wednesday\u2019s concentrated look. \u201cfrom my guess, would show to have the same force of a deflated tennis ball.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s eyes widen in delight at the words. Her mouth doesn\u2019t twitch on a smile, but Enid knows she\u2019s glinting with barely hidden excitement at the prospect of maiming. Because her dark eyes somehow dilatate even wider when she looks up, and Enid is grinning back to her, canines and all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cBut like, don\u2019t actually blind someone.\u201d Enid says, panicking as she bites her lip nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting expelled a second time.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday tilts her head in disappointment; when a tiny sigh leaves her lips Enid swoons. Her breath comes out in a frozen wisp of cold, somehow bathing Enid in bone melting warmth when it hits her cheeks from their proximity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI make absolutely no promises.\u201d She deadpans, but the tiny lift at the edge of her lips tells Enid otherwise as she grins back to the brunette. \u00a0\nThen, Enid watches with wide baby blue eyes as the other girl springs up. Back straight, she dodges in coming snowballs by just moving slightly to the left, or right, and Enid laughs because it reminds her of Wednesday dancing to Goo Goo Muck  and how delightfully  Wednesday she was. She didn\u2019t care. She danced the way she wanted to, and Enid couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of her for a second. She wanted to jump in, dance stupidly with her, and she still regrets she didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the first wave finishes, and Wednesday has dodged every single one, the brunette just fires back an onslaught of unrelenting snowballs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe blonde sits behind and keeps making the ammunition, snorting on a laugh when Thing joins in and fist bumps her in greeting. She swears she hears someone scream in fear: \u201c Who the fuck invited Addams?!\u201d But Enid\u2019s too focused on Wednesday\u2019s wide, burgundy smile.\u00a0\u00a0\nHer teeth flash in glee; reaching back down for more snowballs as the blonde stares up at her in awe. She\u2019s beautiful, devastatingly. Her black hair against the snow is like ivory coal; and Enid is burning against the heat of her embers. Their hands brush in the exchange of snowballs and it\u2019s like Enid\u2019s entire body  explodes, making her gasp and blush crimson when Wednesday collapses back down next to her.\u00a0\nAnd Enid, poor, unsuspecting Enid Sinclair, is irrevocably unprepared for the next short second.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday Addams  laughs  ; chocolate brown eyes wide with excitement as she turns to Enid slumped against the fallen table of their barracks. Her smile is wolfish, punctured by the dimple in her left cheek that the blonde obsesses over every single day of her life. There\u2019s a snowflake on her eyelash, there\u2019s lipstick smeared just at the corner of her mouth at her exertion; Wednesday Addams  laughs because of Enid, and she can\u2019t say anything over the lump in her throat.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday laughing is rare, Enid knows this, because it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s ever heard it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is like finding your mate, this is the precious moment of finally shifting to protect the girl you love. This is like hand sewing a snood for a girl who hates all things remotely pertaining to gifts, but still wears it immediately when asked by a werewolf who doesn\u2019t think she deserves a love so unselfish.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is like finding jewels on a beach amongst an unfathomable number of grains of sand, something precious that was hidden, that was tucked away; like Wednesday finally allowing herself to laugh in the presence of someone who makes her so unbelievably fucking happy.\u00a0\u00a0\nHer laugh relaxes, into something tender; Wednesday looks up into the falling snow that blankets the earth and back down to the blonde. Enid can\u2019t focus, lips parted as a blush paints her cheeks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWoah, yeah,\u201d Enid says softly, blinking once, twice, absolutely, foolishly in love. \u201cYou need to always be on my team now.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s mouth has fallen back into its comfortable stoic position, but her lips still twitch in mirth at Enid\u2019s words. She hums, eyes narrowing in sudden thought. \u201cWe have always been a team, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s breath catches as she slowly smiles, giggling shyly. She gets the sudden urge to kiss her; she wanted to when they first hugged, but now it burns her fingertips with the feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d Enid says, flushed and happy because of Wednesday Addams. \u201cWe have. I guess after the Gates house, I thought you regretted asking me along as part of your, you know,\u201d Enid puts up quotations in the air with her fingers. \u201cTeam.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday tilts her head, chooses her next words carefully, because for all the times she doesn\u2019t let her emotions rule her, with Enid, they roam free.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cEnid,\u201d She says to get the other girl\u2019s attention. The blonde looks up with bated breath at her name on Wednesday\u2019s lips. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI...\u201d Wednesday starts, biting back a nervous breath she doesn\u2019t let show. \u201cI was not right to take advantage of your friendship back then.\u201d She lands on, and Enid softens. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes, it\u2019s true. You showed more cowardness than a mouse in a snake's jaw, begging for mercy.\u201d She deadpans, and Enid can\u2019t help but smile into a laugh at the analogy, and how Wednesday says it truthfully. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cBut when it mattered, with the Hyde,\u201d Wednesday continues, letting her brown eyes soften at the edges under her bangs. Enid looks back suspended, caught in the brunette\u2019s gaze as she forces the words from her lips. \u201cYou were the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid flushes, biting her lip as her heart goes erratic in her chest. Wednesday Addams, thinking  her as brave. The blonde is dizzy with love. \"You...really think so?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks down to her lips, then back up into her blue eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d She says, without a hint of hesitation, and Enid\u2019s breath catches in her throat when Wednesday blinks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI do not regret things easily.\u201d She says. Wednesday\u2019s palms are flat on the tops of her thighs as she tilts her head. Enid\u2019s heartbeat is so loud, like she just transformed and ran a mile in her wolf form. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cBut right now, I find I would regret, for the rest of my life, if I didn\u2019t kiss you.\u201d Wednesday says, as if she didn\u2019t just tilt Enid\u2019s entire soul onto its head, as if Enid doesn\u2019t melt into the very snow beneath them.\u00a0\nEnid, wide eyed and small and safe in Wednesday\u2019s gaze, nods in a daze. \u201cOkay,\u201d She says, smiling when she notices the brunette\u2019s eyes lose their edge to them, like she was scared of rejection.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWait, sorry. Yes.  Yes! \u201d Enid says again, eagerly, nodding her head so fast she gets dizzy. \u201cYou can kiss me. Like, always. All the time. Everyday. Right now. Tomorrow, even-\u201d\u00a0\nShe\u2019s cut off by those very lips, by the cold press of Wednesday\u2019s burgundy mouth that Enid squeaks into, that she absolutely  melts  at from the taste and the feeling of kissing her. Kissing her.  Kissing her.  This sensation is everything Enid has ever wanted in her life, her inner beast preens at the touch and submits all too willingly to the lips of Wednesday Addams. A hair of the brunette\u2019s bangs tickles Enid\u2019s eyelashes and then they\u2019re pulling back for air.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the kiss, glitter from Enid\u2019s eyeshadow has fallen on Wednesday\u2019s cheek, some of her peach lipstick has smeared the other girl\u2019s lips. The blonde giggles, apologetically reaching up and wiping it from the corner of her mouth with her thumb. Wednesday watches her movements carefully, doesn\u2019t even flinch when Enid leans back in and kisses the spot.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf anything, she melts into it, and Enid\u2019s eyes crinkle at the edges in happiness as her smile threatens to split her cheeks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d Enid nervously says, biting her bottom lip. Wednesday hyper fixates on the motion, eyes glued to the blonde\u2019s soft mouth she wants to kiss again. \u201cDoes this mean...we\u2019re a forever kind of team?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks up to her blue eyes, hums in agreement. \u201cYes,\u201d And she lets that previous word Xavier made her tie up in her ribcage unravel; the spider's concave around her bones and chitter to each other to let the cocoon free.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cGirlfriend\u2019s.\u201d Wednesday simply says, internally delights when the other girl just brightens impossibly more so and brings her into a spine crushing hug. Wednesday doesn\u2019t reciprocate, she merely finds her home in that soft spot of the blonde\u2019s neck. \u00a0\nEnid is warm hearted, knee weak; knows the other girl across from her is  it for her. Always has been, ever since they met. Wednesday, soul balmed; blinking into the hug at the emotions swelling her once dead heart.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd realising with a sudden relieving clarity, that despite her visions urging her, Wednesday isn\u2019t too late; she isn\u2019t too late in loving Enid Sinclair. She\u2019s perfectly on time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe holidays begin, biting and cold and  filled with Christmas cheer that Wednesday doesn\u2019t understand and frankly never, in her entire life, will.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the day before they\u2019re set to visit Wednesday\u2019s family for a week, the idea born from the brunette thinking her Dove visioned mother may have some answers on her premonitions that she could benefit from. And also from Wednesday  immediately shutting down the idea of Enid visiting her own parents, because: \u201cWhatever pathetic excuse of an apology they want to drown you in, Enid, you deserve better.\u201d And the blonde melted on the spot, couldn\u2019t really focus properly on dreading the holiday\u2019s when Wednesday gets protective like that.\u00a0\nAnd if Wednesday looked past her absolute disdain for Enid\u2019s family, she\u2019d be able to sooner take notice\u00a0of how her visions begin to finally slow down; almost to a grinding halt.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been an entire forty-five minutes of a horror movie both girls\u2019 have been watching and not  one distractive premonition has shaken Wednesday\u2019s core. It\u2019s simply been Enid snuggled into her side with her face in the crook of the brunette\u2019s in fear, for the better half of the movie.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe has a feeling it\u2019s connected, ever since Enid and Wednesday\u2019s kiss they have become infrequent and hazy; the blonde barely shows up in them now. But once in a while, she\u2019s afforded tiny glimpses that last barely two seconds. \u00a0\nEnid stubbing her toe, Enid burning her hair on her curling iron, Enid being chased by a squirrel she jokingly growled and barked\u00a0at, Enid pushing a pull door and smacking her forehead into it from the momentum.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd it\u2019s absolutely confounding Wednesday; because  what in hellspawns green earth could she be missing now?\u00a0 \u00a0\nThey\u2019re together, Wednesday admitted her desires, it should all be gone like the book insinuated. Like now, she even begrudgingly sometimes wears Enid\u2019s pastel hoodies when the blonde agrees to a horror night; so  what  is she overlooking? What  more  does her visions want her to reveal?\u00a0\nShe\u2019s bought jarringly out of her despondent and intense stare at their shared room\u2019s tv from Enid\u2019s high-pitched squealing, scrunching up the fabric of her hoodie Wednesday wears as she hides her face in her shoulder. \u00a0\nThey\u2019re sharing her pink, fluffy beanbag, sunken into each other in the small space as their elbows knock from their proximity, legs touching. Enid\u2019s fairy lights are on, there is a half-eaten bowl of popcorn on Enid\u2019s lap that\u2019s been strewn across the floor from the blonde's fright.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn the static filled screen, Jennifer Check is consuming a chicken's carcass on the floor of Needy Lesnicky's kitchen then vomiting black, vile blood all over her best friend. Although a campy horror, and definitely not her favourite, Wednesday settled for Jennifer's Body  when Enid whimpered at even the idea of one single scene from  Saw .\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday, used to the jump scare, simply looks down to the blonde and tries to ignore how much her body preens at being a shield against all things frightening to Enid. A werewolf, hiding into Wednesday\u2019s chest from a horror movie. Her lips twitch on a smile at the thought, at how sometimes, like now, she thinks maybe she took a knife to the stomach for Enid Sinclair and not for the so called greater good. \u00a0\nThing, atop Enid\u2019s shoulder, scurries to the floor and turns the volume down for his friend\u2019s sake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou said this wasn\u2019t scary!\u201d Enid exclaims, muffled by the fabric of Wednesday\u2019s clothes. The brunette turns her head, speaking as the other girls\u2019 blonde hair tickles her lips. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d She deadpans, and smirks internally as Enid pulls from her shoulder with a pout; her canines are a little sharper out of fear, and Wednesday is enamoured by it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI find it\u2019s a perfect commentary on teenage girls' boredom and hunger, and on men\u2019s desire to take advantage of us without understanding there are consequences.\u201d Wednesday insightfully says, and Enid softens in her look at how the other girl stares back to the screen and readjusts slightly.\u00a0\n(Enid notices she does it so the movement allows her to fall closer into Wednesday\u2019s side, right up against her ribs.)\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cMostly, I like that she cannibalises boys.\u201d Wednesday jokes stoically, and Enid snorts on a laugh and doesn\u2019t miss how the brunette\u2019s lips tilt a little to the left. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWell, she isn\u2019t special,\u201d Enid teases, folding her arms. \u201c I\u2019ve  done that.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday widens her eyes in absolute delight. \u201cYou\u2019ve eaten someone? Was it in wolf form, or human?\u201d She asks eagerly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNo! Ew! Wednesday!\u201d She squeals, gagging in disgust. Enid settles, shivering at the notion. Not even the other girl\u2019s dark, raven coloured hoodie she has on keeping her warm. \u201cIt was a joke.\u201d She says, smiling and rolling her eyes when Wednesday\u2019s face falls back into barely hidden disappointment.\u00a0\nEnid then winces in regret and mumbles. \u201cThe best I did was maul one.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday hums, eyes warm and pleased, a little bit love struck. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid shyly smiles, sinking further into the bean bag and Wednesday\u2019s side. They settle into comfortable silence, where Enid just opts to grab Wednesday\u2019s entire arm and put it over her eyes when Jennifer unhinges her jaw, tearing limbs and flesh. Wednesday lets her, unaffected at her arm now hanging in the air as a protective shield for the taller girl.\u00a0\u00a0\nEnid\u2019s multicoloured claws come out in stress, piercing Wednesday\u2019s arm and through her jumper, making her eyebrow furrow and neck twitch at the delightful feeling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOw.\u201d She says monotone, but her heart flutters inside of her chest at the sensation. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSorry!\u201d Enid flushes as she peaks over Wednesday\u2019s arm, immediately retracting them with an apologetic look thrown her way. Wednesday taps her nail against her thigh to quell how erratic her breathing has become, stomach churning at the thought. \u00a0\nWhen Enid settles, reaching for the popcorn from her lap, (such a large amount in her hand it\u2019s almost concerning) Wednesday\u2019s eyes widen and she immediately grabs the other girl\u2019s wrist, halting Enid\u2019s mouthful as the blonde blinks and pouts. Eyebrows furrowed; she shoots a questioning look to Wednesday\u2019s hold. \u00a0\nInfuriating, Wednesday thinks. She\u2019s adorable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d Enid tries to reach forward with her mouth open against Wednesday\u2019s grip to no avail, tongue peeking out to the handful of popcorn. When the brunette simply tugs her further from her mouth, Enid huffs. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m eating that, Wednesday.\u201d She whines out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d She deadpans, and then simply squeezes Enid\u2019s wrist a little making her drop the popcorn in her palm. The blonde squeaks at the action, jutting her bottom lip out in a pout. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cA vision.\u201d Wednesday explains, making Enid\u2019s face lose its pouting in favour of realisation. \u201cThis morning I saw you choke on the kernel. Please refrain from wolfing down like that.\u201d Wednesday tilts her head, narrowing her eyes in disdain. \u201cExcuse the unintentional pun.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid just giggles, nodding and winking as she plops a single piece of popcorn in her mouth this time. Wednesday follows the movement carefully, watching the other girl swallow with keen and worried eyes under her dark hair. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cAw, you\u2019re still having visions about me?\u201d Enid teases, making Wednesday repress an eyeroll. Enid knows if Wednesday was physically capable of it, she\u2019d be blushing right now. Looking back to the tv, the brunette elaborates.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes. But not as...\u201d She searches for the word, shifting her gaze from Enid and gluing to the screen. \u201cFrequently. If anything, they\u2019re almost completely gone.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid deflates into a disappointed pout, throwing another popcorn kernel into her mouth as a sudden thought occurs to her. Moving to face Wednesday directly, she widens her eyes and swallows the popcorn thickly. When she grabs to the brunette\u2019s hand in a vice like grip, worried and caring, Wednesday finds she\u2019s getting used to the way Enid shows her love. Physical touch is new, but it isn\u2019t scaring her as much as she thought. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWait,\u201d Enid says, ducking her head slightly as her blue eyes implore softly. \u201cThe visions don\u2019t hurt you, right?\u201d\u00a0\nHer voice does this little wobble, like if she found out this whole time Wednesday\u2019s visions were  harming her, she\u2019d cry on the spot. Wednesday looks from the movie, eyebrows softening at the edges at Enid\u2019s tone. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d She shakes her head a little, squeezes ever so gently back to Enid\u2019s hand in hers in her own way of saying  it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about me. And Enid releases this airy\u00a0sigh of relief that comes from somewhere deep from her werewolf, the part that would howl in discomfort at the thought of hurting the people she loves. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNot physically.\u201d Wednesday says, tilting her head. \u201cAlthough, I do wonder if a seer has ever died from a vision related death.\u201d Her eyes dilate in morbid curiosity as she leans a little closer to a very worried Enid. \u201cHow intensely do you think I\u2019d have to snap my neck during a vision to instantly sever my spine?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWednesday!\u201d The blonde squeaks out, face scrunched up in worry. Her blue eyes are a little shiny with sadness. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to  not think about you dying.\u201d Enid stresses; Wednesday notices her claws have come out in distress. Wednesday looks down to their hands, doesn\u2019t miss how nice it feels to be loved by her. \u00a0\nEnid\u2019s voice then pitches to something softer, something that sounds like the warm, visceral embrace of grief. \u201cI already almost lost you once.\u201d\u00a0\nThe brunette looks up, feels, right in her belly, that gut churning feeling of guilt; because those sapphire pools of blue are sad and yearning. It\u2019s an entirely new and foreign concept, it feels like when she drove Enid away from friendship, when it felt like she\u2019d never have any more sickening pastel colours to drown in because Wednesday realised, much, much too late, how being loved by Enid wasn\u2019t truly a concept she should have shy away from. \u00a0\nIntense? Yes. Overbearing? Yes. But like Enid said, somehow, they work, and ever since Wednesday was a child her mother taught her that no matter how precious and immortal a thing, never take its beauty for granted.\u00a0\nSo, Wednesday softens, squeezing their hands again. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She says stoically, but lets her voice turn a little gentler as Enid looks to her, bottom lip drawn into her mouth nervously. \u201cI would hazard a guess that the chance of vision related death is abysmally low.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid chuckles softly at how the other girl consoles her, how being loved by Wednesday Addams is a little like being strapped into a roller-coaster. You sign your life away, even with knowing the risks beforehand, and Enid realises more and more everyday how weirdly but wonderfully okay with it she is. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHa. Ha.\u201d Enid says dead pan, well, as best as she can when a smile is peaking through. She throws a piece of popcorn at Wednesday and snorts on a laugh when the other girl doesn\u2019t even blink as it bonks her on the forehead. \u201cSo funny.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday tilts her head, picking up the piece from her lap and eating it without even looking down to her hands. She narrows her eyes softly. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t sarcasm. Was my inflection not obvious enough?\u201d\u00a0\nEnid just shakes her head amusedly, supresses the urge to say \u201c What inflection??? \u201d as she falls back into Wednesday\u2019s side. \u00a0\nHer smile is wide, heart full, at how even though a lot has changed with her and Wednesday, the brunette\u2019s interesting and weird ways of making her feel better haven\u2019t. It\u2019s comforting. It\u2019s warm. Like the way Enid doesn\u2019t miss Wednesday\u2019s almost inaudible sigh of contentment when the blonde falls back into her space and up against her ribcage. \u00a0\nHere, Wednesday can almost feel the blonde\u2019s heart beat in her stomach.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s disorientating getting used to, Wednesday thinks. Used to less visions and more physical touch, but she shouldn\u2019t be surprised at how Enid never pushes her for more; she is content in what Wednesday gives her and ecstatic at the brunette\u2019s unique love language. \u00a0\nShe finds that fact endearing, how Enid  likes  Wednesday\u2019s differences. Maybe it\u2019s because the affection Wednesday  does show, is only ever reserved for Enid, and the blonde is very hyperaware of this. Almost proudly smug of it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDamn,\u201d At Enid\u2019s breathless voice, Wednesday is pulled from her thoughts. She looks to the other girl, tilting her head slightly at Enid\u2019s embarrassed laugh and her heated cheeks. \u201cThey\u2019re, um...really...g-going at it, huh?\u201d \u00a0\nPerplexed, Wednesday looks from Enid and back to the screen, blinking once.  Oh . The movie has rolled to the make out scene; of Jennifer and Needy lit up by the warm glow of a bedside lamp in her childhood bedroom. There are hands and body\u2019s moving, there is so much skin painted across the screen with planes of flesh and hands roaming. There is breathing, there are moans, there is tongue and fire and want. \u00a0\nWednesday blinks, looking back to Enid who\u2019s flushing and who\u2019s hands are suddenly clammy against the brunettes as she sinks further into the beanbag and the smaller girls\u2019 side. \u00a0\nBut Wednesday, unperturbed by the scene, is sitting up straighter with a sudden clarity overtaking her  entire body. \u00a0\nHere, with Enid\u2019s uncomfortable warm hand in hers and the knowledge that the blonde loves her,  loves her, despite Wednesday\u2019s differences, she realises why the still lingering visions of Enid are around. Why they haven\u2019t left yet; realises the one thing she hasn\u2019t really understood about herself right until this moment. is what\u2019s been clouding her mind with visions and blissful nightmares of the blonde in her hold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cEnid.\u201d She says, turning to the other girl who squeaks at being addressed. Enid sits up too, pink nose and pink cheeks to match. She is gorgeous, close to the hue of flesh and muscle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d She answers, crystal eyes flicking across every inch of Wednesday\u2019s face and the brunette finds she isn\u2019t annoyed at being studied like that, not when it\u2019s Enid.\u00a0\nThen Wednesday takes a breath, speaks her truth, and waits patiently for Enid to either accept it into her open palms, or throw it away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid nods eagerly, supportively, and at the cue Wednesday is shifting her eyes away in a nervousness she\u2019d only ever show to Enid Sinclair. She searches, looks for the right words in the static of a horror movie, but finds nothing. Instead, she looks into her chest, at the base of her once shielded heart, and unearths so many words she isn\u2019t prepared to find. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhen I think of-\u201d Wednesday grunts, clenching her jaw when her voice closes around the words. She frustratedly looks away, blowing an annoyed breath through her nose. Enid doesn\u2019t push, just looks softly towards her and sits patiently. \u00a0\nThe brunette tries again, this time, briefly meeting Enid\u2019s eyes. She finds nothing but kindness. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThe idea of so much of my-\u201d Wednesday\u2019s eyes flick to the screen then back, and Enid follows with a patient and attentive look. \u201cSkin, being seen by you, or touched, leaves me...adverse.\u201d \u00a0\nThen, a little quieter, because Wednesday tried to soften the blow of her words, but it still sounded like it came out wrong. Wednesday swallows, eyebrows a little furrowed as she strings the words she wants to say together, so she isn\u2019t misheard. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI hope you understand what I mean. I hope that doesn\u2019t bring you discomfort.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid immediately perks up, widening her eyes as she moves a little closer. Wednesday doesn\u2019t move back like she would have before, before their kiss. They sink into the puffy pink bean bag like two boats on the sea, destined to rock against each other's bows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh! No! It's okay, really,\u201d The blonde says comfortingly, in understanding, and Wednesday eases in her rigid disposition at her girlfriend\u2019s words and how warm her voice is. \u00a0\nOh. Yes. Girlfriend. She\u2019s still getting used to that one. The spiders in her abdomen crawl over each other in excitement as Wednesday thinks the term. This must be how it feels to have a stomach flip in deep affection, Wednesday thinks. Like cyanide curdling. Like fire on a tongue. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologise for not...being attracted to me in that way.\u201d Enid says shyly, a fierce blush painting her cheeks as she blinks owlishly back to her.  Curse her,  Wednesday thinks, curse her for her pretty eyes and sunshine smile; because when her hand is taken in by Enid\u2019s in support the brunette immediately softens.\u00a0\u00a0\nWednesday hums in thought, lets her eyes trace every feature of Enid\u2019s as she looks back to her beneath her dark hair.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI don't think I have articulated myself very well.\u201d She says blankly, and Enid tilts her head with a pretty, scrunched up look of confusion. Wednesday elaborates as she parts her lips. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOn the contrary, I am very attracted to you.\u201d She says, deadpan and truthful. Enid makes this tiny noise in the back of her throat like she was choking on air as her cheeks colour. \u201cI find you intelligent and strong. Alluring. Like one would find a car crash impossible to look away from.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid is blinking back to her in awe, the freckles across her nose and cheeks are a deep rouge that Wednesday finds herself glued to. The brunette opts to stare only at that, because her heart is fluttering dangerously inside of her ribcage at being so bare. \u00a0\nYes, she\u2019s evolving, but it is a terrifyingly shocking notion when you feel it actually happening.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI think I would be doing your emotions a disservice, Enid, if I didn\u2019t tell you I can\u2019t be with you like...\u201d Her dark eyes flicker to the movie rolling the end of the heated scene, then back to the tip of Enid\u2019s nose. \u201cThat.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid melts into an understanding smile, and Wednesday is finding it increasingly easy to talk to her; to know whatever she chooses to share with the werewolf will be met with nothing but open ears and a warm smile. She isn\u2019t throwing it away, Enid is holding this part of Wednesday delicately and kindly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d She says gently, shrugging a little and shifting her body to be closer to Wednesday. The brunette lets herself be jostled, likes that when their knees knock together it feels comfortable and easy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m happy to be with you any way you want, Wednesday.\u201d She says, and it feels like the moon just pulled the tides of Wednesday\u2019s lower belly. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cIf that means we only kiss, or even just hold hands and hug, then I\u2019m all  for it! You\u2019re still my girlfriend, that\u2019ll never change.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid smiles, does this little solidifying nod after her sentence, and Wednesday just stares back at her with melting pools of brown. She isn\u2019t smiling, her face is stoic, but the blonde is fluent in Wednesday idiosyncrasies and knows the way her eyes are sheening and glassy means her words hit her directly in the heart, and that she\u2019s endlessly thankful for how Enid loves her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d The blonde excitedly exclaims, making Wednesday blink at her outburst. \u201cI find you  very attractive, too.\u201d Enid teases, grinning shyly; her own words have her blushing.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe brunette hums, tilting her head for the other girl to elaborate. She has never cared for others' opinions, never thought twice about her own appearance other than the colours she dons herself in. But she is desperate to know Enid\u2019s, curious to know what angle of her face she likes the most.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlmost not expecting to be put on the spot, Enid shyly elaborates, playing with Wednesday\u2019s black and sharp nails. Wednesday looks to the touch and finds  this one to be at the top of the list of what she\u2019s okay with.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI find you hauntingly beautiful.  Enchanting , kinda like...\u201d Enid drags the word out, furrowing her brows in thought as she searches for a parallel her girlfriend would understand. \u00a0\n Oh, Girlfriend! Girlfriend! The reminder has Enid brightening, so much so Wednesday swears she sees a little lightbulb blink to life above her head, or Enid\u2019s metaphoric werewolf tail wagging in joy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cLike open heart surgery!\u201d She burst out, giggling when Wednesday widens her eyes from all the emotion that suddenly floods her at the words, how much desire for Enid takes over. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhen I look at you,\u201d Enid continues, even though the imagery she is conjuring up is making her a little ill. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m watching myself with my chest open, and you\u2019re poking at my heart. But like, really  really softly.\u201d Enid says, grinning as she winks. \u201cLoving pokes, I think.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday\u2019s lips part ever so slightly. Behind her dark hair her eyes flick to Enid\u2019s nose then to her cool, blue eyes, and she\u2019s suddenly hyper aware of how much she should not take advantage of Enid\u2019s love. Usually, she wouldn\u2019t care, wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at taking what would benefit her in the long run. Tyler, Xavier, Bianca, even Eugene. But she thinks of being a vampire or suffering endlessly if it meant her girlfriend was happy and knows with zero doubts, when it comes to Enid, there would be no hesitation in putting the other girl\u2019s needs before her own. Like Enid has just done for her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI am intolerable,\u201d Wednesday says, with an air of realisation, chocolate eyes dilated with desire. Enid across from her tilts her head. \u201cAnd yet, you...\u201d Wednesday shakes her head imperceptibly, bewildered at the fact she\u2019s about to utter. \u201cYou tolerate me. You love me.\u201d\u00a0\nEnid blushes, smiling and looking her lap bashfully. \u201cYeah,\u201d Enid sways their hands a bit, biting her lip. \u201cI do. And I wouldn\u2019t call it  tolerating,\u201d She teasingly says. \u201cMore like...loving despite flaws.\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday hums in agreement. Yes, loving despite flaws, because she loves Enid despite her nauseating colours and taste in music and sunny disposition. But she loves her  because of Enid\u2019s bravery and intellect and pension for protecting the people she cares about, filled with fire and brimstone and blood.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen Enid is holding tighter to her hands and Wednesday looks down to them, then back up with a confused look thrown her girlfriend\u2019s way at her brightening disposition.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, my turn!\u201d She says brightly, clicking to Thing on the floor and bouncing in her seat as a reanimated hand somehow perfectly communicates to Enid without saying any words. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou said after the movie, if I get through it, I picked our next activity.\u201d The blonde says, leaning a little closer and biting her lip in barely hidden giddiness. Wednesday moves her gaze to the tv, realises the end scene is playing, and hums.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d Wednesday easily agrees, never a person to go back on her word. But she panics a little when Enid\u2019s eyes sparkle in excitement. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYay!\u201d She exclaims, immediately reaching out and grabbing the pale pink and blue nail polishes Thing scurries over. Wednesday freezes, her bottom eyelid twitches in contempt. \u00a0\nThen Enid holds them up, smiling with her teeth. \u201cWhich colour?\u201d\u00a0\nWednesday looks to her girlfriend, back to the nail polishes, and thinks of loving despite flaws. Thinks of Enid, without a second thought and no hesitation, accepting who she is. Thinks of pig's hearts and bees and Enid in a suit amongst the insects for  her, even when back then, they barely knew the others heart.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cPink.\u201d Wednesday answers, choking around the word like she swallowed cotton candy. \u00a0\nAnd maybe it\u2019s all worth it, maybe understanding your girlfriend\u2019s interests despite the flaws and being there for her after she just sat through an hour of gore, means wearing bubble gum pink nail polish for the holidays. Maybe it\u2019s worth it for the absolute pure  euphoria  that crosses Enid\u2019s face in the moments after Wednesday grits the word out.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt could be, that the visions won\u2019t ever go, and Wednesday finds, suddenly desperate, that she doesn\u2019t want them to. She wants to be able to protect Enid in any way she can, every single day, in any motion a mortal body is allowed\u00a0to.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaybe this little permanent fixture of the blinding light that is Enid Sinclair, now in Wednesday\u2019s mind amongst the premonitions of gore and death and world ending artefacts, is exactly what her mother was trying to tell her.  Our psychic ability resides on the spectrum of who we are. \u00a0\nMaybe Ravens and Dove\u2019s aren\u2019t as different as Wednesday thought.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaybe darkness, every once and a while, needs a little light.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
