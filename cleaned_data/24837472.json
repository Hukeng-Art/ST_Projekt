    "text": "Twenty exams deep into his fifty-exam stack, Wei Wuxian can feel his eyes starting to droop. He looks down at the current problem he\u2019s grading, a calculation problem worth 40 points out of the entire 200 point exam.\u00a0\nIn shaky pencil;  Mr. Wei I\u2019m really sorry you have to grade this but I don\u2019t know what the question is even asking and I think I\u2019m just gonna give up now. Under that, an incredibly realistic rendering of the live action version of Sonic the Hedgehog.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian notes it down as another reason to talk to the professor about the difficulty of the exams, caps his grading pen, and stretches backward in his chair, feeling his vertebrae pop one by one. In the time he\u2019s spent hunched over the exams, the sun has dropped low on the horizon, and the last of the day\u2019s weak amber light streams in through the window, projecting warped shadows on the wall.\u00a0\nLan Zhan must have left a couple hours ago. He should be back soon.\u00a0\nJust as he\u2019s thinking about getting up to refill his coffee mug, his phone lights up.\u00a0\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n ???wei-xiong???\n\n\n 1 attachment from Nie Huaisang \n\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n pls tell me WHY this is hanging in the MUSEUM?? \n\n\n \ud83d\udc40 \ud83d\udc40 \ud83d\udc40\n\nCuriosity piqued, he clicks the attached picture, and it expands to fill his screen.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a beautifully inked portrait of a young man, night-dark hair cascading down to brush against white robes, face devastatingly handsome. Despite the stern set of his mouth, his golden eyes are creased gently, as if with fondness.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a small plaque to the right of the frame, and he zooms in to read it, hands abruptly sweaty.  Unknown artist, early 13th Century. Found in the home of the Yiling Patriarch.\u00a0 \nWith mounting horror, Wei Wuxian realizes exactly why it seems so familiar.\u00a0\n\n Wei Wuxian \n\n\n WHAT TH \n\n\n I DREW THAT \n\n\n OJDSKSDJLK;FF; \n\n\n WTF WTF WT FF\n\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n I KNEW THAT STYLE LOOKED FAMILIAR!!!!!\u00a0 \n\n\n and i dont think its urs anymore lol \n\n\n its like, what? a thousand years old?? \n\n\nthats basically \ud83c\udf1fpublic property\ud83c\udf1f\n\n\n Wei Wuxian \n\n\n THEY STOLE?????????MY ART?? \n\n\n FROM MY OWN HOME???\n\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n u rly shouldnt leave ur own possessions scattered around ur own home \n\n\n basically just asking for it wei-xiong \ud83d\ude14\u00a0 \n\n\n told u so many times to stop being so messy \n\n\n old habits die hard i guess!!\n\n\n Wei Wuxian \n\n\n HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME \n\n\n im being robbed!!!actually!!!\n\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n sorry\u00a0 \n\n\n i just got possessed by a museum curator \n\n\n askdlkkdsfkAHHAHAHA no rly im sorry\u00a0 \n\n\n like i feel bad for u but this is hilarious\n\n\n Wei Wuxian \n\n\n they just TOOK my painting?????? and were like \u201cthis is mine now\u201d???? \n\n\n and put it on display for PROFIT!! stolen goods!!\u00a0 \n\n\n wait \n\n\n LAN ZHAN IS THERE WITH YOU TOO\n\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n oh shit\n\n\n Calling Nie Huaisang\u2026 \n\n\n Wei Wuxian \n\n\n FUCK!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n HUAISANG!!!!!!! \n\n\n HELLO \n\n\n DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE\n\n\n Calling Nie Huaisang\u2026 \n\nJust as he\u2019s about to leap to his feet and start pacing, his friend picks up the call. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Wei Wuxian wails down the line in lieu of a greeting, \u201cWhy did you take so long to pick up\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a  museum,  I had to find someplace more private to talk\u2014\u201d\n\u201cActually I don\u2019t care! Just tell me Lan Zhan hasn\u2019t seen it, Huaisang, Nie-xiong,  please, you have to drag him out of there for me or I\u2019ll go into hiding again, I swear I\u2019ll do it\u2014\u201d\nOriginally, the three of them had planned to visit the new museum exhibit together, after Nie Huaisang had won a set of four tickets in an office raffle. Jiang Cheng had already begged off on account of his absolute lack of interest in art\u2014which was expected\u2014but then Wei Wuxian had to cancel as well, after his fellow TA had fallen sick and he had been assigned her portion of exam-grading at the last minute.\u00a0\nNie Huaisang had complained\u2014Wei-xiong, why an immortal would willingly choose to go through school again is beyond me, you\u2019re like ten times older than the university why are you grading papers for them, just don\u2019t do it  \u2014and Lan Zhan had worried\u2014Wei Ying, we do not have to go if you cannot make it, there will always be other exhibits\u2014but in the end, he had convinced them not to waste the tickets.\n\u201cJust go, Lan Zhan,\u201d he\u2019d said as he\u2019d practically hip-checked his roommate out the door, \u201cyou can tell me about your favorites when you come back! But don\u2019t have too much fun without me, okay, gege?\u201d\u00a0\nNow, he realizes that might have been a mistake.\u00a0\n\u201cWei-xiong, calm down! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s seen it yet. And even if he does see it, maybe he won\u2019t notice or something?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian\u2019s voice tears out of his throat in what could generously be called a screech. \u201cWhat do you mean he won\u2019t notice? IT\u2019S HIS OWN FACE\u2014and you don\u2019t  think? Do you not know where he is?!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d comes the sheepish reply, \u201cI had to pee ten minutes ago, and then there was a mishap when someone tried to barge into my stall, and then when I came out I couldn\u2019t find him but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s in the poetry section or something\u2026\u201d\nWei Wuxian puts his phone down for five seconds to scream into his hands, and then takes a deep breath to calm himself. \u201cOkay. Maybe this can work. Get back in there and find him, and then all you have to do is make sure he doesn\u2019t see it!\u201d Yes, this could work. This is fine. Wei Wuxian is definitely not freaking out. \u201cIt\u2019s one painting, how big can it be, maybe you could block it with your body or something when you pass by, or even better, maybe fake a qi deviation as a distraction! Lan Zhan\u2019s so good, he definitely wouldn\u2019t stop to look at art while someone is actively dying on the floor, maybe you could get some real blood for your eyes and mouth too, I can tell you how to make a talisman for that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI really hate to break it to you,\u201d Nie Huaisang\u2019s voice is tinny with distance and what sounds like a combination of pity and amusement. \u201cbut it\u2019s not just one painting.\u201d\nApparently, Nie Huaisang explains over the phone as Wei Wuxian\u2019s limbs slowly grow numb with horror, there is an entire section of the room covered with his yearning-induced artistic creations. A veritable wall of scrolls, plastered from floor to ceiling, of Lan Zhan, legs folded, soft gaze turned to a rabbit in his lap; Lan Zhan, hair loose and forehead bare, profile illuminated with candlelight; Lan Zhan, his scarred and muscular back turned to the viewer, waist-deep in water.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian thinks he might actually melt with embarrassment. He\u2019ll just turn into a little puddle and seep through the floorboards and the concrete skeleton of his apartment building, and when he makes it all the way into the earth he\u2019ll just stay there and hang out with the worms until he overcomes his immortality and dies and never has to feel this sort of humiliation ever again.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, Wei-xiong, if you think about, it, this is really just a great validation of your artistic prowess\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my god. Oh, god, I\u2019m begging you, just go in there and make sure he doesn\u2019t see it!\u201d\n\u201cI got your back, don\u2019t even worry!\u201d The sound of footsteps, as Nie Huaisang hurries back into the exhibit. \u201cSeriously though, these portraits are beautifully drawn, this is the best manifestation of pining horniness that I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014ah! There he is!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2014Huaisang\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I got this, he hasn\u2019t seen them yet, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Louder; \u201cWangji-xiong! Over here!\u201d A rustle of cloth, like he\u2019s waving his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s coming over! He\u2019s walking\u2014oh no.\u201d\nThe bottom of Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach drops out. He\u2019s going to become a puddle. He\u2019s going to join the water cycle.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, well, he\u2019s going over to the wall, but maybe he\u2019s just looking at the paintings right next to them? They\u2019re really colorful, really eye-catching, lots of flowers and birds\u2014nope, I was wrong, he\u2019s definitely looking at yours.\u201d\u00a0\nA long pause. Wei Wuxian makes a croaking noise. Dry like a desert, his throat. Nie Huaisang\u2019s words come to him as though through water, muffled and warbled and forcibly cheerful.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, but he doesn\u2019t know that you painted them, since he hasn\u2019t read the plaque yet! I can still\u2014ah, okay, he\u2019s reading the plaque. Okay. Well, umm, I\u2019ve...I\u2019ve never seen evidence that Wangji-xiong can  actually read! Maybe he\u2019s secretly illiterate!\u201d Nie Huaisang\u2019s voice is getting weaker by the second. \u201cOh, he\u2019s coming over now. Oh, wow, Wei-xiong, the look on his face is\u2014\u201d\nA deep voice, uncharacteristically urgent. \u201cWho are you calling? Is that Wei Ying?\u201d\nNie Huaisang squeaks, \u201cWho\u2019s Wei Ying? I mean\u2014uhh\u2014\u201d\nWei Wuxian hangs up.\u00a0\nThis can\u2019t be happening. He\u2019s dreaming. He fell asleep while grading, and he\u2019s going to wake up any second now, face-down and getting drool on some poor kid\u2019s midterm; and Lan Zhan will never have left for the museum, will be cooking dinner in the kitchen and blissfully unaware of how Wei Wuxian has, over the course of the last millennium or so, made countless sad-horny paintings of his beautiful eyes and bare brow and impressive musculature\u2014a dozen of which are now being displayed for public viewing for the entire city; he won\u2019t have seen the evidence of how Wei Wuxian has been pathetically, embarrassingly in love with him since they met as teenagers, years before they\u2019d even cultivated the golden cores that would grant them immortality into the modern age.\u00a0\nA  ding  from his phone. One new text message.\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Wei Ying?\u00a0 \n\n*****\n\n \u201cWei Ying.\u201d \n\n\n Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t want to turn around, at first, because it seems silly, over-optimistic; it seems too good to be true that Lan Zhan would be here, in the same city, standing on the same hard-packed earth as him, and not on the other side of the globe where they last saw each other. \n\n\n And yet, there he is. Even in the crush and bustle of the crowd, Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes find him immediately. He\u2019s as handsome as ever, no change in his appearance despite the decades that have passed. \n\n\n Wei Wuxian\u2019s face splits in a wide grin. He bounds forward.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cLan Zhan! Is that really you?\u201d \n\n\n He almost reaches out to hug him in greeting, before he remembers. His hands drop down, and Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes follow them. He looks...disappointed. Wei Wuxian decides not to think about it, and blathers on.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cWow, it\u2019s really\u2014I really missed\u2014I mean, wow, it\u2019s been so long. I\u2019m kind of surprised you managed to bump into me here, I\u2019ve been kinda staying off the grid since\u2014ever since\u2014\u201d He falters. The one thing he doesn\u2019t want to talk about, and somehow he\u2019s brought it up immediately. Typical.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cMn. Almost sixty-one years now. Wei Ying\u2014\u201d \n\n\n And Wei Wuxian braces himself for the onslaught; why did you leave, where have you been; who do you think you are, just disappearing like that; sixty years, and not a single word. Wei Wuxian, you really left a mess behind. Did you really believe you could do it. Did you really believe you could save them. Sixty years, Wei Wuxian, who do you think you are.\u00a0 \n\n\n The onslaught never comes.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201c\u2014I am very glad to see you.\u201d \n\n\n Wei Wuxian blinks, taken aback. \u201cOh. Oh, you are?\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cYes. Wei Ying, have you been well?\u201d Lan Zhan\u2019s eyes are intense as ever.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cYes! Yes, I\u2019ve been well, just travelling here and there, you know.\u201d Someone jostles him from behind as they pass, and Wei Wuxian stumbles forward a few steps\u2014Lan Zhan\u2019s hands shoot out to steady him. He feels his touch keenly, the heat of Lan Zhan\u2019s palm piercing even through the layers of his robes, like a brand. Like an ache. \u201cOh, thank you. Sorry, I\u2019m a little off-balance with all this stuff!\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n Lan Zhan eyes the pack of materials strapped to his back. \u201cAre you going somewhere? I will accompany you.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cI was going to do some painting...oh! Are you certain? You don\u2019t have to, Lan Zhan is such a busy person, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re here on business\u2014\u201d \n\n\n \u201cI am sure. I will join Wei Ying.\u201d His tone is firm.\u00a0 \n\n\n And that was that. \n\n\n He brings Lan Zhan to the local lake, a clear and gem-green stretch of water surrounded by hills. In the distance, mountain peaks rise high up into the sky and disappear behind wispy clouds.\u00a0 \n\n\n He usually paints quietly, but it feels wrong to make Lan Zhan sit there and watch in silence, so he starts chatting away about what he\u2019s been doing. Words come more easily than expected, and he\u2019s reminded of how...lonely he\u2019s been. It feels better now, with Lan Zhan at his side. \n\n\n When he\u2019s done with his landscape, he asks Lan Zhan if he likes it. \n\n\n \u201cYes,\u201d replies Lan Zhan, steady gaze unrelenting. \u201cAnything Wei Ying paints is beautiful.\u201d And then Wei Wuxian has to cough and turn away and pretend he isn\u2019t turning red. \n\n\n The day passes. Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t say anything about leaving, so neither does Wei Wuxian.\u00a0 \n\n\n The inn is nearly full that night, so they end up sharing a room, and over dinner Lan Zhan tells him everything that happened after he left. They don\u2019t talk about the Wens, for which he is glad\u2014but he gets to hear about his family, and what\u2019s left of his friends. The new changes in the cultivational world. The latest updates in Lan Zhan\u2019s own life. They sit across from each other at the table, and each time Lan Zhan pours him a fresh cup of tea and passes it back over, their fingers brush.\u00a0 \n\n\n Lan Zhan goes to bed at nine on the dot, just as he did when they were younger. His sleeping face is soft in the flickering candlelight. \n\n\n Wei Wuxian takes out his paper, his ink, his brush, and begins to draw.\u00a0 \n\n*****\nWei Wuxian must black out, somehow, because the next thing he knows, he\u2019s banging desperately at Jiang Cheng\u2019s front door.\nJust as he thinks he\u2019s about to start pawing and whimpering like a dog (ugh), the door slams open. Jiang Cheng stands in the foyer, arms crossed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot, Wei Wuxian, movie night with A-Jie isn\u2019t until  next Friday.\u201d\u00a0\nHe pauses to take in Wei Wuxian\u2019s ruffled appearance and wide eyes. One eyebrow ascends toward his hairline. \u201cWhy the hell were you making so much noise? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be at the museum?\u201d\nWei Wuxian collapses forward. \u201cOh, thank god, you\u2019re home. I didn\u2019t go, I had work\u2014it\u2019s not important\u2014Jiang Cheng, A-Cheng, please help me, I\u2019m really gonna die this time! I mean it!\u201d\nJiang Cheng staggers back against his sudden armful of squirming, anxiety-sweaty brother. \u201cWhat the fuck? What are you talking about? And stop being so weird, stand on your own damn legs.\u201d\n\u201cNooo, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, flailing violently. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, I can\u2019t go back and face him, I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d His breath hitches slightly. He admits that he was playing it up, just a little, because Jiang Cheng absolutely hates it when he gets dramatic, but now there\u2019s a real thread of hysteria starting to edge into his tone.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng must hear it too, because his brows draw tighter together. \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying,\u201d he huffs, even as he turns and heaves Wei Wuxian into his apartment.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian ignores that. If Jiang Cheng really hated him, he would have dropped him on the floor outside his door, instead of dragging him along. He also wouldn\u2019t have decided to move into the same city as him, into an apartment that was just a short ten minute walk from Wei Wuxian\u2019s own place. He\u2019s just a softie at heart.\u00a0\nOne explanation later, Wei Wuxian is no longer feeling as charitable.\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that you kicked up this whole fuss because of some paintings? You woke me up from my post-dinner nap because Lan Wangji found out you\u2019ve been drawing him?\u201d Jiang Cheng\u2019s cheeks are flushed, partly from exasperation, partly from amusement; he spent the second half of Wei Wuxian\u2019s frantic storytelling laughing at him, because he is Wei Wuxian\u2019s meanest brother.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you had dinner already?\u201d No wonder Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach feels so empty. There\u2019s a headache coming on, too.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, and you haven\u2019t? It\u2019s eight already\u2014wait, that\u2019s not the point! You\u2019re really embarrassed about this?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Wei Wuxian drags his palms down his face and then lets them drop on the table with a loud slap. \u201cHow am I supposed to look him in the eye now? There were like ten of them, A-Cheng, and he\u2019s gonna come home and ask me about it\u2014and I\u2014oh god, I can\u2019t even think about it, I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d He lets his head sink down, burying his face into the soft sleeves of his hoodie. This is nice. He\u2019ll just live here in the darkness and be soft and warm, and there will be no little brothers judging him for his life choices, and no Lan Zhans coming to ask why Wei Wuxian has made half-naked paintings of him.\u00a0\n\u201cSo? I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal. You made some old-ass paintings, they finally turned up, you can laugh about how you were pining for him even back in the day and then, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Jiang Cheng makes a gagging noise. \u201cYou can kiss about it, or whatever.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s head shoots up. \u201cKiss\u2014!\u201d His cheeks instantly flame up. \u201cJiang Cheng, what the hell!\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng glares back, cheeks also red. \u201cWhat, like you don\u2019t kiss? Stop acting all coy, it\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t all gross and sappy at home.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t!\u201d Wei Wuxian splutters. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even together, where did you even get that from, I\u2014\u201d\nJiang Cheng lifts his hand up. \u201cHold on, shut up, what? You aren\u2019t together?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut you started living together like a hundred years ago! You hold hands all the time, and I walked in on you practically cuddling on your couch last month, fucking gross.\u201d Jiang Cheng looks aghast, and also like he\u2019s this close to slapping him in the face. Wei Wuxian scooches back, just in case. \u201cYou\u2014you tell people that you\u2019re soulmates! I thought you got together ages ago! Everyone thinks so!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014Huaisang doesn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well. Nie Huaisang knows fucking everything. Wei Wuxian, you\u2019ve been obsessed with Lan Wangji since we were fifteen, how have you not sorted this out already?\u201d\nWei Wuxian wails into his fingers. The throbbing sensation in his head doubles. \u201cJiang Cheng, I never confessed! We\u2019re just friends! Everything is platonic and friendly!\u201d\nJiang Cheng groans. \u201cAnd here I was getting pissed because I thought you had some fucking secret wedding and didn\u2019t invite your fucking family, what the hell. Okay, then why don\u2019t you just be upfront? Now he knows that you\u2019re all weird and horny for him, and he\u2019s definitely all weird and horny for you, so get it over with and bang like everyone thinks you\u2019re doing. There, happy ending.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work! If I tell him he\u2019s gonna hate me, and then he\u2019ll move out and never talk to me again\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop being so dramatic, he\u2019s put up with your ass for this long\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and then I\u2019ll have to find another roommate, but I don\u2019t want someone who isn\u2019t Lan Zhan and I hate living alone, Jiang Cheng, you know that, and rent is so expensive now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust tell him you like him!\u201d Jiang Cheng\u2019s on his feet now, veins popping in his temples. \u201cJust grab him and say it. What\u2019s so hard about that?\nWei Wuxian\u2018s knuckles bleach as he clutches the ends of his sleeves.\u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s not gonna work! He doesn\u2019t like me back like that!\u201d\n\u201cAnd where did you hear that? Do you even see the way he stares at you? You\u2019re too scared to even\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m  not  scared! He\u2019s just\u2014so good\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat, does he think he\u2019s too good for you now? Did he say that? I\u2019ll fucking kill\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t! Stop it, Jiang Cheng, you know he wouldn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cThen why won\u2019t you try! Give me one reason why you think he doesn\u2019t feel the same\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s me!\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian lurches to his feet, his chair tumbling back. \u201cIt\u2019s me, fucking Wei Wuxian! What do I have to offer him? What good am I? All I do is run away! I can\u2019t even save the ones I\u2019m supposed to protect! I can\u2019t even be there when people need me! Maybe I tell him that I\u2014that\u2014but then what? You really think he\u2019d stay after that? Do you think he\u2019d really want me for me? Do you really fucking think anyone out there actually wants me?\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian\u2014\u201d\nHumiliatingly, he can feel tears starting to gather in his eyes. He may be a thousand years old, but he\u2019s still an easy crier. \u201cAnd then what if he does stay? If he fucking pities me so he stays as my friend, and we just live like that\u2014and he\u2019d just see me every day and be reminded of it, and\u2014and\u2014\u201d The tears are really coming now. He wipes at his face with his sleeves. \u201cWhen I think of that it makes me feel awful, Jiang Cheng, I don\u2019t want that to happen, I don\u2019t think I could stand living like that.\u201d\u00a0\nHis voice falters. \u201cI\u2019m scared, okay? You\u2019re right. Are you happy now? I\u2019m scared! I don\u2019t want him to leave.\u201d\nThe end of his sentence breaks on a sob. He sniffles into the silence.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng sighs. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0\nThe sound of Jiang Cheng\u2019s stupid purple slippers shuffling across the floor, and then a hand, tugging at Wei Wuxian\u2019s balled up fists, which are still scrubbing at his cheeks.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Wuxian, you\u2019re gonna rub your skin away like that. Stop.\u201d A firmer tug. \u201c A-Xian, stop.\u201d\nWhen he finally lifts his head, his brother is standing in front of him. He feels his lip wobble, like a child. \u201cI really really love him, Jiang Cheng.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d And then Wei Wuxian\u2019s head is pulled down onto a warm shoulder, and he\u2019s immediately wrapped into a hug. Wei Wuxian clings back. For all his acerbic personality, Jiang Cheng gives amazing hugs\u2014but they don\u2019t happen often, so he\u2019s gonna milk this one for as long as he can. Plus, he\u2019s still crying.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m only gonna say this once, so shut up and listen and don\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d Wei Wuxian nods into the warm shoulder, simultaneously smearing snot and tears all over the cloth. Jiang Cheng twitches slightly but continues on. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got this idea in your head that nobody will want you, or whatever, but I don\u2019t fucking care for it. You\u2019re stupider than I thought if you can\u2019t see your own worth.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a little noise of protest.\u00a0\n\u201cShut  up, A-Xian, what did I say? You\u2019re a fucking genius, so use your brain. Everyone has been watching you and Lan Wangji dance around each other since day fucking one. I\u2019ll bet my entire golden core that he feels the same. And\u2026and if I\u2019m wrong and he rejects you, then fuck him. I\u2019ll break his legs and you can come live with me, or whatever.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels a fresh surge of tears. \u201cLove you too, A-Cheng,\u201d he sniffles. He peeks one eye out and sees Jiang Cheng\u2019s neck, flushed pink.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Stop crying, crybaby, don\u2019t make me call jiejie.\u201d\u00a0\nThey stand there, Jiang Cheng patting his back gently, until Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach growls. He chuckles wetly. \u201cOops.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have dinner, did you.\u201d Jiang Cheng heaves out another deep sigh before finally letting go, and begins to move toward the kitchen. \u201cWell, you\u2019re here anyway. Eat something before you fall down, I\u2019m not gonna catch you this time.\u201d\u00a0\n*****\nWith his tears dried and belly full, Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t have an excuse to stay any longer, and Jiang Cheng kicks him out with one last hair ruffle and a succinct, \u201cJust talk to him, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0\nNight has well and truly fallen. Wei Wuxian drags his feet as he meanders from streetlight to streetlight, listening to the faraway rush of evening traffic, before he remembers his phone in his pocket. After he\u2019d received that last text message, he\u2019d immediately powered it down and shoved it away.\nThe screen glows softly as his phone turns back on. Immediately, a flood of notifications come through.\u00a0\n\n Nie Huaisang \n\n\n omg wei-xiong\u00a0 \n\n\n im so sorry i tried my best \n\n\n he left so fast i couldnt even talk to him or anything \n\n\n but i dont think hes that mad?????\u00a0\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Wei Ying, I\u2019m coming back now. \n\n\n I would like to talk to you.\u00a0\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Missed Call (1)\u00a0\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Where are you?\u00a0 \n\n\n You weren\u2019t at home when I returned.\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Missed Call (3)\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n It\u2019s getting late, Wei Ying. \n\n\n Will you be staying out tonight?\n\n\n Lan Zhan \n\n\n Please let me know when you see this.\n\nHe winces.\nWhen he finally arrives at his apartment, he spends a good five minutes just standing in front of the door. He\u2019s not scared or anything stupid like that\u2014he needs a moment, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s well past nine, anyway. Lan Zhan\u2019s probably sleeping already. He\u2019s being silly.\nWhen he finally pushes the front door open, the living room is empty and dark. Good. He\u2019ll just\u2014not sneak\u2014he\u2019s not sneaking in his own home, he\u2019s just putting his feet down more gingerly than he usually does, just trying to move as soundlessly and as fluidly as the alley cat that he sees outside sometimes. One careful little step, then another, and he\u2019s almost to his bedroom, and then all he\u2019ll have to do is close the door behind him and then in the morning he can leave through the window instead of the front door and avoid any\u2014\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d\u00a0\nFuck.\nLan Zhan stands in the entrance of his own room, door half-opened, back-lit with a golden glow.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian edges back. One step. Two steps.\n\u201cHey, Lan Zhan! Didn\u2019t realize you were still up, haha, sorry, I was trying to be really quiet so I wouldn\u2019t wake you up. I was at Jiang Cheng\u2019s just, y\u2019know, hanging out, haven\u2019t seen him in five days so I thought he might be getting lonely, but turns out he\u2019s fine! So I ate dinner there and then came back, and I guess you\u2019re back too! From the museum. Wish I could\u2019ve gone but work is work, can\u2019t help it. You must\u2019ve had fun though, even if I wasn\u2019t there, cause Nie-xiong\u2019s always interesting company! Uh, hope you didn\u2019t hear\u2014you probably didn\u2019t see anything weird\u2014\u201d\nShit, Lan Zhan is staring. Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice squeaks up another octave.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, of course you didn\u2019t, nothing weird about art, right?\u00a0 Um, um, you must be tired, it\u2019s really late, gege, way past your bedtime! I\u2019ll just let you go to sleep now, good night!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Wei Ying. At the museum\u2014I saw\u2014\u201d\nWei Wuxian diligently avoids eye contact. He read something online once, some psychology fact about how staring at people during a conversation will make them keep talking to fill the silence, and he knows it\u2019s true because every time Lan Zhan looks him in the eyes Wei Wuxian is this close to spilling out every single thought and emotion he\u2019s ever had.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s late, tell me your favorites in the morning, Lan Zhan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying, the paintings. I know you made them.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian\u2019s hand stops on his doorknob. His mouth opens without permission from his brain, because he's the worst. \u201cWhat paintings? I paint a lot, you mean the ones in my room?\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying, do not pretend. I know you talked to Nie Huaisang about it. There were paintings of me, in the museum. Many of them. The plaque said they were from your home. Some of them were...Wei Ying, why?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan\u2019s tone is weird. If he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say it sounded almost hopeful. But Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t a fool. He knows not to expect that.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying. Please.\u201d There\u2019s a hand on his elbow, turning him around, and then there it is. That fucking eye contact.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian is strong. He can do this.\n\u201cWei Ying. Do you\u2014\u201d\nHe crumbles.\u00a0\n\u201cI like you, okay! I like you, I love you, I\u2019ve been\u2014god\u2014I\u2019ve been pining after you for a thousand fucking years! I made those paintings because I\u2019m in love with you, because I missed you, because I wanted to see your face, I wanted to see you without your forehead ribbon and your billion layers of clothes. Because I wanna kiss you, that\u2019s why! There!\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan stands there, frozen. Eyes wide.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian is frozen, too, until he realizes what just came pouring out of his mouth, and then he whirls around, escapes into his room, and slams the door shut behind him.\u00a0\nHis knees buckle, and he slides down the wall. Damn it, he\u2019s ruined everything.\u00a0\nA gentle knock. From the other side of the door: \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\nHe ignores it. The knocking becomes more insistent. \u201cWei Ying! Please open the door.\u201d\nWei Wuxian buries his face in his hands, cheeks hot, and mumbles out from between his fingers, \u201cGo away, Lan Zhan! I\u2019m really embarrassed, don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay! Leave me alone.\u201d\nA pause, then the sound of footsteps, moving away from the door. Wei Wuxian thinks, well, this is it then, guess I\u2019ve ruined our friendship forever, and he has one hand over his phone screen\u2014ready to call Jiang Cheng and tell him to start prepping his apartment for Wei Wuxian to move in\u2014when the footsteps come back.\u00a0\nA thin sheaf of papers slides in under the door, right next to his legs. \u201cWei Ying. If you won\u2019t open the door, please at least read these.\u201d\nWei Wuxian eyes it suspiciously, then picks up the first page. He feels a hum under his fingers. It\u2019s old, magically reinforced. Without that, the paper would have crumbled away with age.\nHe reads the first line.\n\n Wei Ying, are you well? It has been sixteen years since we last met. I miss you.\u00a0 \n\nHe blinks, picks up the next paper.\u00a0\n\n The snow is getting heavier. I hope you are warm. \n\n\n I passed by a lotus pond today, and thought of you. Wei Ying, you are so good. You did not hear it enough. I regret not telling you.\u00a0 \n\n\n Wei Ying, where are you? Is it peaceful there? You were so sad, when I last saw you. I hope you are happier.\u00a0 \n\n\n The night is dark. I miss you still. Please let me know that you are safe.\u00a0 \n\n\n Wei Ying, I have finally found you again. Your paintings are beautiful. You are beautiful.\u00a0 \n\n\n You told me you want to see my home again. I will take you there. I will take you anywhere.\u00a0 \n\n\n Wei Ying, you are asleep on my shoulder. I would not mind spending the rest of eternity like this. \n\nPage after page of messages, inked carefully and neatly\u2014Wei Wuxian flips through them one by one, ears burning, until he reaches the last sheet.\nHe recognizes this stationery. It\u2019s from the pack he bought for Lan Zhan three days ago.\u00a0\n\n Wei Ying, you cooked dinner for me tonight. It was too spicy. I still wanted to kiss you.\u00a0 \n\nThe paper shakes in his hand. He puts it down gently, reverently, and finally finds his voice. \u201cLan Zhan? Did you...did you write all of these?\u201d\u00a0\nThe shadow on the other side of the door shifts. \u201cYes.\u201d A pause. \u201cThere are more. They wouldn\u2019t fit under the door.\u201d\n\u201cYou wrote to me all these years? You were thinking of me, this whole time?\u201d\n\u201cI was.\u201d\n\u201cThen. So you really...\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Lan Zhan sounds like he\u2019s smiling. \u201cI like you. I love you. I too have been pining for...a thousand fucking years, as you put it.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s heart jack-rabbits straight out of his chest. \u201cLan Zhan!! You\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cSo please, Wei Ying. Let me in. I can\u2019t kiss you through the door.\u201d\nIn an instant, Wei Wuxian is on his feet. He rips the door open and Lan Zhan is there, closer than he imagined, eyes intent. Wei Wuxian melts. He reaches out.\n\u201cGege, I like you so much I could die,\u201d he says, and then Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth is on his.\u00a0\n*****\nLater, as Lan Zhan moves between his thighs and sucks bruises into his neck, Wei Wuxian lets his mouth run.\n\u201cI could, I could paint us, Lan Zhan,\u201d he gasps, tightening his arms around Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou and me, like this, just\u2014ah!\u2014just let them put  that  in a museum, right next to everything else. Let them know you\u2019re taken\u2014\u201d\nLan Zhan bites at his shoulder. \u201cNo. Not for others\u2019 eyes.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian chuckles, eyes creasing, baby hairs plastered to his forehead. Lan Zhan gazes at him softly, then surges up to press kisses all over his laughing mouth.\u00a0\n\u201cSilly Lan Zhan, I was just joking! Okay, not in a museum\u2014ah, harder, harder! Then, what about just for your eyes? I could do that too.\u00a0 A special one just for you, fuck, big strong Lan Zhan and his delicate beauty~\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm. The real Wei Ying is better.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHa! You\u2019re right\u2014but imagine having a painting! Your poor little Wei Ying under you, legs over your shoulders\u2014mm\u2014gege, would you like that? Something to look at when I\u2019m not there?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Zhan hums. Thrusts in deeper.\n\u201cAh! That\u2019s not a no, is it?\u201d\n\u201c...It is not.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pulls him down for a long kiss. When Lan Zhan finally lets him up for air, he pants against his mouth and grins.\u00a0\n\u201cThen give me something worth painting, gege.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n\u201cThe key\u2019s under the mat, please hurry, I need to hand the exams over in half an hour!\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s frantic voice blares out from the phone Jiang Cheng has pressed between his ear and shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d he grouses, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have left all of them at home then, should you?\u201d The apartment door clicks open, and he strides in. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t seem to be home, which is good\u2014Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t particularly want to see the person who gave his brother all those hickeys, right now.\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, Jiang Cheng, you\u2019re the absolute best, I\u2019ll buy you dinner\u2014\u201d \n\u201cYeah, whatever. They\u2019re in your room, right?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s bed is unmade\u2014typical\u2014but just as he thought, there\u2019s a stack of papers on the desk next to the window, all of them marked up with red ink.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s just about to grab them all and leave when he sees something sticking out from the bottom of the stack. The quality of the paper is different, and the ink is dark and thick and all curved lines and shapes. Probably another one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s sketches, he thinks, and pulls it out without any further thought.\u00a0\nHe flips the paper over to see what it is.\n\u201cWhat the\u2014GOD DAMN IT, WEI WUXIAN, I DIDN\u2019T WANT TO SEE THAT! KEEP YOUR NASTY PAINTINGS SOMEWHERE ELSE!\u201d\u00a0"
