    "text": "\"I never said it was the same demon from last week,\" John Constantine countered with a careless gesture with his cigarette. Which was, of course, lit even though it went against all the spoken\u2014and unspoken\u2014rules for the Watchtower.\nBruce heaved a sigh and looked to the ceiling of the meeting room in search of strength. This fight disguised as a conversation had been going on for the better part of an hour and his patience was quickly running out. \"So you mean to say that this whole misunderstanding could have been avoided if you had simply been a little more forthcoming in your first\u2014\"\nHe was interrupted mid-sentence by the sudden appearance of Danny Phantom popping into visibility in front of them, heedless of the ongoing argument and with a wide smile on his face.\nBruce decidedly did not jump in surprise. Of course not. He did however notice with some satisfaction that John fumbled and dropped the cigarette in his hands.\nDanny didn't waste any time, or greeting, before grinning and holding out an envelope that was glowing slightly green.\n\"What's this?\" Bruce asked with a raised eyebrow as he looked down at the suspiciously fluorescent paper in Danny's hand.\nDanny simply kept on beaming and said unhelpfully, \"An invitation.\"\n\"To what?\" Bruce asked with narrowed eyes, having learnt the hard way to be wary of Danny and his \"innocence\" and ignoring the way the others on the team called him heartless for it. He knew better.\nDanny laughed, waving the paper in front of his face. \"Come on! Just open it.\"\nHe radiated innocent happiness, the very picture of harmlessness. Bruce didn't touch the envelope.\nTheir stalemate was broken as John leaned in to snatch the paper out of Danny's hand with a muttered, \"Oh, for crying out\u2026\"\nHe tore the envelope open and Bruce watched as he scanned the paper, and then leaned in closer as John's eyebrows climbed higher the further he read.\nBruce glanced down at the paper just as John spoke up in an incredulous voice, \"A coronation?\"\nAnd it was. An invitation to a coronation taking place next week. In the Ghost Zone.\n\"Yeah,\" Danny confirmed and Bruce looked up to catch his earlier grin dimming into something more hesitant, almost self-conscious. \"Will you come?\"\nA big part of Bruce wanted to immediately agree, to reassure him they would be there, but he wasn't well-versed enough in ghostly matters to know what he would be agreeing to, which was why he breathed a sigh of relief as John gave a lazy smile and said, \"Sure. We can't refuse an official invitation, after all.\"\nDanny gave a hesitant smile. \"So you're okay with it\u2026?\"\nThis question brought forth a confused expression on John's face. \"With what?\"\nDanny shrugged, eyes gliding down to look at the floor. \"The new ghost king and all.\"\nJohn scoffed. \"Well, considering the last one was a right dick, I would think this is an improvement.\"\nFor some reason, that comment made the grin return to Danny's face.\nBruce frowned as he tried to understand why Danny seemed to be so invested in this event, why he was so involved. Frustratingly, their young team member always tended to be quite tight-lipped about the goings-on in the Ghost Zone and Bruce felt like he didn't have enough information to make a good decision, but\u2014\nBut it didn't matter, did it? Regardless of why the new king wanted them to be there, and regardless of why Danny had been the one to deliver the invitation, Danny had come to them and asked them himself. Bruce looked into Danny's sparkling eyes and felt his resolve crumble.\nDamn it, he was weak.\nBruce allowed a small smile to grace his lips as he made a last-ditch effort to get some control of the situation, \"We can't all come.\"\n\"I know, and that's completely fine,\" Danny assured him, \"I just wanted someone from the Justice League to be there.\"\n\"Oh?\" John waved the invitation in the air. \"So this is your doing, then?\"\nDanny blushed green. \"Of course. Who else?\"\nBruce bit back the obvious \"the king\" and instead opted for his favorite approach; waiting and watching.\nDanny was clearly quite involved and as John had said; they couldn't really afford to get on the new king's bad side without even meeting him. Even so, ghosts as a whole weren't known for being very fond of humans. John must have had a similar thought as he said, \"Then I hope us being there will be alright for his royal highness.\"\nDanny blushed a deep green. \"Of course it will! I wouldn't have invited you otherwise.\"\n\"So you'll put in a good word for us, yeah?\" Constantine asked and Bruce was surprised to see that he seemed slightly worried, which immediately set off alarm bells in his own mind. John Constantine didn't get worried or scared for nothing.\nBut Danny broke the sudden tension with a laugh. \"I'll talk to the others. Nobody will bother you, I promise.\" He then perked up as if remembering something, \"Right! I'll also send someone to come pick you up before the ceremony.\"\nThat was something of a relief; Bruce had no idea how to get into the Infinite Realms by himself, even if he was fairly certain that John had his own way, but his methods tended to be\u2026 unpleasant. Even so, the idea of an unknown ghost coming to escort them wasn't very comforting, so Bruce raised an eyebrow even though it was hidden by his cowl and asked, \"You can't come and pick us up yourself?\"\nBruce watched as incredulity flitted across Danny's face before it settled into an almost guilty expression. \"Ah, no. I'm sorry, I won't have the time.\"\nBruce frowned. So he must be very involved in the event then. A part of him didn't like the fact that this was the first time he had heard about it if it affected Danny so much.\n\"Speaking of time, I really have to get going now,\" Danny said as he clapped his hands and rose up in the air. \"Loads to do, you know how it is.\"\nJohn folded the invitation and showed it back into the still glowing envelope before leveling a challenging look at Danny. \"We'll see you at the coronation, yeah? Don't be too busy and forget about us.\"\nDanny gave a big thumbs up and a, \"Wouldn't dream of it!\" before he popped out of visibility just as suddenly as he had arrived.\nThere was silence for a few seconds before John broke it with a heavy sigh as he reached into his coat and swapped the envelope for a hip flask, leaving the invitation safe in his breast pocket. \"Would it kill him to stay still and explain things for once in his life?\" He then grimaced and unscrewed his flask, no doubt regretting his choice of words.\nBruce didn't entirely blame him; Danny was lively enough to consistently make you forget he was dead. You would also think that a guy with ice-based powers would be a bit calmer, a bit cooler, but Danny always seemed dead-set on going against all expectations at every opportunity he could and he was usually so happy and warm that you forgot how cold he could be. He somehow always managed to embody both sides of the coin, always straddling the line without even trying.\nBut John had a point; Danny was notoriously bad at tolerating stifling and proper situations\u2014even if he wasn't the only supernaturally-aligned person in the room with those particular tendencies\u2014which made it all the more strange that he had somehow gotten quite involved in a royal coronation of all things. Enough so that he could invite personal guests. The last thing Bruce wanted was to be stranded in another dimension without anyone who really knew what was going on. \"How likely do we think it is that he'll actually show up?\"\n\"All ghosts are gonna be there,\" John said as if it was a fact and then patted his breast pocket now housing the invitation. \"Besides, he personally gave us the invitation.\"\n\"Wait,\" Bruce held up a hand to silence him, \"what do you mean all ghosts are gonna be there?\"\nHe understood that a coronation was a big deal, but surely you would invite a select few to such an event and not a whole dimension.\nJohn grimaced and took a swig from his flask, gesturing with it as he spoke, \"Look. This isn't just any coronation, and it's not for a kingdom or land in the Ghost Zone. This is for the realm itself. The high King of the whole fucking dimension.\"\n\"\u2026and we just got invited,\" Bruce concluded as his head tried to come up with a reasonable explanation to their invitation and Danny's apparent influence over the event.\nJohn gave a slightly manic laugh before muttering out, \"Apparently.\"\n\"What more do you know?\" Bruce asked gruffly. He might not know a whole lot about the Ghost Zone yet, but he would make sure to get as much info as he could about the situation before risking entering a whole other realm.\nJohn fiddled with his flask and continued, \"This is the first coronation in hundreds, if not thousands, of years. And apparently this new king is actually decent, in contrast to the last one. So, you know, kind of a big deal.\"\n\"What was wrong with the last king?\"\nJohn shrugged with an uneasy expression. \"He was a tyrant.\"\nBruce could tell there was more to the story and his silence must have spoken for him because John sighed and reluctantly continued, \"I don't know that much. The ghosts feared him and wouldn't even speak about him. He was revered as a god and from what I could gather, as powerful as one too.\"\nBruce frowned. That was indeed very troubling information, but there was one thing in particular that bothered him, \"If he was so powerful, then what happened to him?\"\n\"Defeated. In combat. By this guy.\" John patted his breast pocket that housed the invitation. \"The ghosts I have been talking to haven't been very forthcoming about the details.\"\nNot a good sign. It could be out of respect, but if the last king instilled obedience and silence through fear, who was to say that this new one wasn't the same? \"I'm starting to think that we shouldn't go to this coronation. We should make sure to gather information about this new player first, make sure he's not an active threat.\"\nDanny would no doubt be disappointed if they turned the invitation down, but Bruce was sure that he would understand. Eventually.\nJohn immediately shook his head. \"It would be very rude to refuse the invitation and we don't want to piss this guy off. The last king isn't the only god-status being this new guy has defeated. Besides, what little I've heard about him seems to be good things.\" John made a sound somewhere between a snort and a laugh. \"Some ghosts even call him the chosen one.\"\nBruce's frown deepened.\nSo the new king was creating a cult, then. Manipulating the masses to follow him blindly. It seemed to be very likely that he was controlling as well as frighteningly strong, which was a worrying combination. Bruce might not agree with John's somewhat optimistic view of the new king but he was starting to agree with the fact that they shouldn't decline the invitation; it was too good an opportunity to get more information about this supposed god-slaying king. He nodded towards John. \"When we go there we\u2014\"\nJohn raised both his hands in front of him, his flask held lopsided in his right, as he spoke over Bruce, \"No, there's no we. I don't want to get involved in whatever fucking insane shit is going on in the Infi\u2014\"\n\"You're going,\" Bruce cut him off bluntly. \"You're the only one who knows anything about this.\"\n\"What about our ghostly friend and the instigator to this whole incident? He probably knows more about this mess than I do!\"\n\"We can't count on him to provide intel before the event, you know how hard he is to pin down if he doesn't want you to find him.\"\nJohn groaned. \"So you're going there to gather intel? That's the plan? You don't think they'll notice that?\"\n\"I have to assess whether this new king is an active threat or not.\"\nJohn heaved a deep sigh, slumping in defeat. \"Anyone else joining us on this thrilling mission to the realm of the dead?\"\nBruce hesitated before shaking his head, \"We don't know the risks involved. We should keep the team as small as possible to avoid jeopardizing the whole League.\"\n\"You mean if we were to die?\" John asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Which, I should remind you, is a very real possibility.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Lovely,\" he muttered with a grimace, raising his flask high. \"It's a date, then. I'll bring the booze.\"\n\"You will be working,\" Bruce said in a disapproving tone of voice.\n\"I'm well aware,\" John said before taking a swig.\nTrue to his word, when the day came a portal tore itself into existence in Danny's usual spot in the Watchtower half an hour before the time for the coronation.\nBarry\u2014who had insisted on joining them when he heard where they were going, saying something about \"proving to everyone that ghosts aren't real\"\u2014jumped in surprise at its sudden appearance. Bruce simply sucked in a quiet breath and straightened up, eyes fixed on the portal and the being that didn't waste any time before stepping through.\nHe had expected a guard of some sort, a butler, a monster, a beast\u2014at the very least a ghost of some kind\u2014 but instead they got what looked to be an ordinary young woman with auburn hair, a green fancy dress, and a serious expression.\nShe couldn't be their escort\u2026 right?\nThe young woman stopped in front of them and looked the three of them over one after the other with startlingly calculating eyes. She raised an immaculate eyebrow and asked, \"Is that what you're wearing?\"\nBruce blinked.\nHe didn't want to admit it, but he really wasn't used to people being faced with Batman for the first time and not being at least slightly intimidated. This woman gave away absolutely nothing, and Bruce felt suddenly decidedly wrong-footed.\n\"Who are you?\" Barry asked in his hero costume topped with a bright yellow bowtie in a futile attempt to make it seem more festive and proper. Not that Bruce himself was much better in his black tie that was barely visible over his Batman-suit. Constantine was wearing his usual trench coat and hadn't even attempted to dress up for the coronation. Bruce had made the strategic decision not to fight the other man about it, not wanting to invite the barrage of criticism of his own fashion choices that would no doubt follow if he did.\nThe woman heaved a sigh, still not even slightly affected by being in the presence of three Justice League members\u2014or two heroes in full costume and one grumpy man in a trench coat\u2014before she crossed her arms over the shiny fabric of her dress that was, no doubt, a perfect fit for the occasion. \"I guess I'll take that as a yes. I'm Jasmine, but call me Jazz.\" It wasn't a suggestion. \"I'm Phantom's sister.\"\n\"...What?\" Bruce said at the same time as Barry asked, \"He has a sister?\"\nDid Danny send her here to meet them before their escort arrived to put them at ease?\nOn second thought; he had a nagging suspicion that Jazz wasn't a person who did anything she didn't want to do herself. A suspicion that was confirmed by what she said next.\n\"I wanted to meet you guys in person.\" She continued as if none of them had spoken, her calculating eyes seeming to catalog everything about them. Judging them. Weighting their worth.\nBruce had the sudden realization that this young woman was way scarier than some of the ghosts he had run into in the past. He didn't know what to do with that information.\nThankfully he was saved from coming up with anything to say by Barry giving a slightly forced laugh and a, \"Well, here we are!\" as he gestured to the three of them.\nConstantine, always too curious for his own good, narrowed his eyes at Jazz and asked, \"So. Are you dead as well\u2026?\"\nAnd that was a good question. Bruce didn't know enough about ghosts to tell for certain but he had thought that most of them at least glowed, or had something that made them different enough to single out, but if even John Constantine had to ask, then he guessed that some of them looked more like humans than he would have previously thought. Or been comfortable with.\nNo matter what the answer to John's question was, Jazz's voice was cold as death as she answered, \"You should know better than to ask that question.\"\nAnd John actually looked chastised. As if he was a kid caught swearing. Bruce never thought he would live to see the day. His respect for Jazz jumped up a few notches.\nShe let the silence fester for a long minute, eyes roaming from one to the other, before she gave a small nod and turned on her heel. \"We should go.\"\nBruce got the distinct feeling they had passed some sort of test.\n\"Wait,\" John said as he held up a hand to stop her. \"You're the escort?\"\nJazz raised an eyebrow. \"Yes? Is there a problem?\"\n\"No.\" John shook his head, but his hands fumbling with his packet of cigarettes betrayed his nervousness. \"No, it's just not what I was expecting.\"\n\"Who did you expect?\"\n\"A ghost?\" John asked and Bruce felt the breath catch in his throat. He had to give it to him; the man had some nerve to push it. An indirect question was still a question.\nShe shrugged easily, but her eyes were intent on John as she said, \"Sorry to disappoint,\" making it clear to everyone that she knew what he had done. And didn't approve.\n\"No, no, not at all.\"\nSo not a ghost then. If they could trust her. Which would be easier if he didn't see so much of himself in her. Nevertheless, he filed the information away for later analysis.\nJazz turned back towards the portal. \"We should go. We don't want to be late.\" She stepped through the tear in reality; her dark green dress blending with the neon green before disappearing from sight.\nThis time the three of them followed her without further comments.\nAs they stepped out the other side of the portal Bruce almost stumbled at the cheer noise that washed over them. It was a deafening roar of overlapping voices; innumerable people talking over each other as their voices weaved together into a din of pure sound.\nBruce looked around with wide eyes, taking in the countless countless ghosts surrounding them on all sides.\nHe hadn't even known this many ghosts existed, but here they were.\nThey were crowding in around the circular platform that Bruce and his three companions stepped out on; a select few standing on the platform itself, but a vast majority hovering in the air at different heights. The mass stretched out as far as the eye could see. Some were huge, some were tiny, and they were all ranging from humanoid to very much not.\nAll Bruce's earlier misgivings about them not being dressed appropriately flew out the window the moment he spotted the mismatched mess of beings that surrounded them, some of whom weren't even wearing anything that could generously be considered clothes.\nIt was, all in all, very overwhelming and alien in a way that not many things were anymore.\nHe had to consciously shake himself out of his momentary stupor and focus his eyes on Jazz as she walked on with sure steps across the polished ground. As the fact that the platform was mirror smooth beneath his feet registered Bruce almost expected to slip as he hurried after her, but despite how it looked it was surprisingly easy to walk on. The surface did, however, reflect everything and made the crowd seem\u2014impossibly\u2014bigger than it already was.\nIt also reflected the artificial lights and plants interspersed around the whole circular platform, making the whole thing shine.\nAs well as the castle that towered above it all.\nAs his eyes had landed on it, Bruce didn't know how it hadn't been the first thing he took in as they stepped through the portal. The thing was massive. At the base of the structure Bruce could make out the ominous ruin of what looked like a stone castle, but through its windows and cracks there had sprouted huge spires of twisting ice. The ice rose from the dark stone almost playfully as it in turn formed walls, towers, and windows.\nIntertwined through the whole thing were those same electrical wires and plants from the circular platform they were standing on and the lights shone through the whole structure, almost making it glow as the ice reflected the light in a dazzling display.\nIt reminded Bruce of new life growing from old stagnation; grass and plants growing through a skull on the forest floor; of life and moving on. It was something Bruce hadn't been expecting from the realm of the dead.\nHe was struck by the fact that despite all the ice, he wasn't cold. On the contrary; the plants and the lights gave the whole area a distinctly warm feeling.\nWarmth in cold. Life in death.\nIt was\u2026 nothing short of awe-inspiring.\n\"Wow,\" Barry breathed out from where he was walking next to him, head tipped back and slowly spinning to take it all in.\n\"Pretty, isn't it?\" Jazz asked with a knowing smile over her shoulder.\nBruce found himself blinking up at the structure rising high above them and before he could control his words and reaction, he had breathed out an honest, \"Yeah.\"\nBarry jumped in with a question, voice clearly aiming for casual but instead ending up as an equal mix between skeptical and absolutely-loosing-his-shit, \"Are all of these beings\u2026 ghosts?\"\nBarry finished his question with another side-long glance at the crowd surrounding them and Bruce had to admit that even if the ghosts currently occupying the platform were somewhat calmer than the ones surrounding it, they were still an intimidating bunch; a giant hairy monster with a prosthetic arm made of what looked like ice, a huge multi-armed warrior, a medieval queen with a wide berth around her, a robot with more weapons on him than Bruce would think appropriate for an occasion like this, and the list went on and on.\nNot to mention the fact that if they had places on what was clearly the middle stage or something similar, then they were probably guests of honor. Of strength.\nThe question still remained what Bruce and his two colleagues were doing here with them.\nNot picking up on the tension, or more likely not caring about it, Jazz shrugged and answered easily, \"Yes, they are all ghosts.\"\n\"But they look so\u2026\" Barry trailed off and waved his right hand in the air in a floundering motion before breathing out a heavy gust of air and landing on a simple, \"Weird.\"\nJazz raised an eyebrow as she sent Barry a judgmental stare. \"That's a bit rude, don't you think? Humans aren't the only beings that can die. Besides, ghosts are more than just dead people.\"\nBarry frowned. \"Now you're just shitting me. Isn't the whole deal with ghosts that they are people who have died?\"\nJazz turned her gaze to John, raising an expectant eyebrow, and John in turn sighed and said, \"Ghosts are imprints on ectoplasm. Emotions, feelings, beliefs, you name it. When someone dies they can turn into a ghost if there's enough ectoplasm around, but even a strong enough feeling, a belief or fear can latch on to ectoplasm around it and gain sentience, in a way.\"\nJazz gave him an appraising look and Bruce didn't think he imagined the respect in her voice as she said, \"Someone has been reading up.\"\n\"It's my job,\" John said casually, as if he hadn't spent the last week stressed out of his mind, reading everything he could get his hands on about the Infinite Realms, and even calling on several contacts to interrogate them.\nBruce wished he would take his job this seriously more often.\nBarry hummed, still looking somewhat skeptical, and asked, \"Is that why that last king, that Pariah Dark guy, was so strong? Because all the ghosts believed he was?\"\nJazz made a non-committal hand gesture and kept walking.\nBruce frowned. So this new king\u2026 could be a concept? He got stronger by people believing in him? He looked around at the countless ghosts gathered for the new king and frowned. That was a lot of strength.\nThey stopped in front of the only chairs in sight. Jazz gestured towards them. \"These are your seats.\"\nBruce hadn't even been expecting anything they could sit down on, what with ghosts' ability to fly and all. As he looked at the comfortable-looking chairs over he knew he didn't even have to count them; he was sure that there was a chair for every Justice League member, even if Danny knew that they wouldn't all be able to come, he would absolutely make sure they were all welcome.\nJohn looked down at the chairs and then frowned up at something in front of them. \"We're almost at the front.\"\nBruce followed his gaze and he couldn't believe that he had almost missed the throne standing in the middle of the platform, raised up slightly, and made from the same sparkling ice as the platform and the outer layer of the castle.\nHe blamed the overwhelming amount of new information he had gotten the last few minutes. It had nothing to do with his preoccupation with worrying about Danny. Of course not.\n\"Yes? You're Danny's personal guests,\" Jazz said as if that explained anything.\n\"Are you staying here?\" Bruce asked bluntly. It would be nice to have someone around who knew more about the customs and what was expected of them.\n\"No,\" Jazz said with a small shake of her head. \"I have to go and find Danny before the ceremony starts. Someone needs to make sure he's okay.\"\nBruce narrowed his eyes. Why wouldn't Danny be okay? Had something happened?\nHe was really starting to get the feeling that they were missing some crucial information. What if the king was forcing Danny to work for him? Was that the reason why nothing made sense? The need to find their teammate and make sure he was okay became almost overwhelming. Bruce pressed down on it as much as he could, but couldn't keep himself from asking, \"Do you know where Phantom is?\"\n\"He's getting ready,\" Jazz said vaguely.\nMaybe he had simply gotten nervous with these many ghosts around and was running a bit late. Bruce could hope. But, come to think of it, he had never seen Phantom in any other clothes than his usual jumpsuit, so what could he possibly have to do to get ready?\n\u2026Was Jazz lying to them?\nHe kept his voice carefully neutral as he pressed on, \"So he'll be here soon then?\"\n\"I mean, yes?\" Jazz answered with a sudden confusion on her face, her eyes jumping from Bruce, to John, to Barry and then back to Bruce again, and her gaze was back to being calculating as she took them in.\n\"You don't\u2014\" She cut herself off as a sudden grin spread across her face and it was somehow worse than the cold analytical expression. Much worse. \"Well. I know Danny can be scatterbrained, but this has to take the cake.\"\nDespite his best efforts, Bruce felt himself bristle at those harsh words aimed at his teammate and at the fact that she was clearly withholding information from them. He very much did not appreciate being on this side of it.\nHe had assumed that Jazz cared about Danny on the basis that she claimed to be his sister. But he, more than anyone, knew how fraught with fights, jealousy, and animosity sibling relationships could be.\nMaybe she was working with the king and they were both using Danny.\nThat assumption would also cast her carefree and casual way of interacting with them in a more sinister light; if she had the power of this new king backing her, then of course she wasn't intimidated by them.\nAnd wasn't that a far more likely conclusion that a young innocent woman somehow not being phased by interacting with three renowned heroes?\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Barry carefully asked, but Bruce could hear the anger in his voice\u2014Barry had never been very adept at hiding his true feelings.\nJazz, in what Bruce was beginning to think was typical of her, seemed unfazed by his tone of voice. \"I meant what I said. I need to go now, but maybe you can talk to some of the other guests here? They're all nice, I promise.\"\nAs if they could trust anything she was saying. But before any of them could ask any more questions, and with a last grin aimed at them, Jazz stepped though the throng of ghosts surrounding them, all of whom silently parted for her and then immediately closed behind her.\nAs if they respected her. Or, as if they feared her.\nWell fuck.\nAs soon as they were alone, Bruce, John, and Barry huddled together on the chairs while casting furtive glances at the ghosts surrounding them, suddenly feeling very out of their depth.\nDespite the very real possibility of her being aligned with the enemy, Jazz had provided a sense of security in the unfamiliar surroundings\u2014a fellow human who knew what was going on and how to act. Now, without her, they found themselves unmoored in a sea of unknowns. Bruce wasn't used to the feeling and found that he didn't like it one bit.\nBarry, obviously sharing this sentiment, heaved a deep sigh and said, \"A bit rude of Phantom to invite us here only to ditch us, don't you think?\"\n\"I'm sure there's a good reason,\" Bruce said with forced calm, not knowing if the others had picked up on Jazz's allegiance or not and unwilling to share his horrible realization if they hadn't. Barry didn't have the best poker face and it would only risk their safety if they were found to know too much before they had a plan of attack\u2014or at least a plan of escape from the realm.\nJohn scoffed. \"Well, the kid better be in some sort of trouble.\"\nBruce winced. He knew that John and Danny had something of a friendly rivalry going on, but right now it hit a bit too close to home. But then he noticed the way John kept looking around them as if searching for something, or someone, and he relaxed. John might have a bad habit of hiding his worry beneath a fa\u00e7ade of indifferent annoyance, but Bruce was very aware that it was there. At least Bruce wasn't alone in worrying about their missing teammate.\nAnd then there was Barry, who probably hadn't picked up on anything being wrong about the whole situation, at least not beyond the fact that he was in an entire dimension made up of individuals who claimed to be something he didn't believe in, but was still always thinking about his teammates and friends. \"Speaking of Phantom\u2026 Hey, John? Is it really true what you said to Jazz? About concepts and all that?\"\nJohn focused his attention back on the two humans in front of him and nodded. \"Sure.\"\nAnd then Bruce understood what Barry was getting at.\nIf ghosts could be born from a concept\u2026 Could Phantom be one of those ghosts? Bruce had been so sure their teammate was human\u2014had once been a human\u2014but after everything he had seen today he was no longer sure that it was so clear-cut, that it would be so obvious.\nBarry confirmed his suspicion on where the question had come from as he laughed and said, \"I bet that Phantom is the embodiment of stealing all the food from the communal fridge.\"\nJohn scoffed. \"More like the embodiment of being a pain in my ass.\"\nBruce huffed out what passed for a laugh from him, but privately he thought that if Phantom was the embodiment of anything, then it must be of heroism and helping people out.\nSilence descended over the three of them for a few seconds, but Barry had never been the best at staying idle. \"I wasn't expecting Phantom to have a human sister.\"\n\"I'm not sure she was,\" John said around a cigarette that had somehow found its way into the corner of his mouth.\n\"What?\" Barry frowned in confusion. \"His sister?\"\nJohn shook his head and clarified, \"Completely human. Something about her was\u2026not dead, but close to it. Touched by death more than your average human at least.\"\nBruce decided to break his silent brooding with a gruff, \"Well that's worrying.\"\nAnd it was. It complicated things even further. What if she wasn't simply in league with the king? What if she was somehow part ghost? Some sort of unholy amalgamation of human and ghost. Bruce shuddered at the mere thought.\nHe had enough experience with death and resurrections to not want any part in that.\nJohn chewed on his cigarette and sent another quick glance around them. \"I'm sure we can ask the little bugger about it when we meet him.\"\nBarry groaned and leaned back in his chair, far enough that the front feet lifted off the ground. \"If we meet him! I haven't seen a hint of him.\" He tilted back even further, teetering precariously on two legs. \"Maaan, I really hope this new king is cool with us being here. I don't wanna think about what will happen if all of these so-called ghosts suddenly decide that we are the enemy.\"\nBruce hesitated as he himself teetered between telling his teammate about his suspicions or not, but in the end his cautiousness\u2014not paranoia\u2014won out. So he said, \"It'll be fine. He wouldn't have invited us here otherwise. You should trust your teammate.\"\nBarry scoffed as he let the chair fall back to all four feet as he opened his mouth, no doubt to accuse Bruce of how hypocritical that statement was, but at that moment they could all hear a muttered, \"Why are there humans here?\" coming from behind them.\nBruce whipped around to look at the speaker who said human in the same way someone would say pest, and found a hovering green ghost with white hair that was matched by his long white cape. He had ridiculously small and square glasses that didn't completely hide the way he somehow managed to sneer in their direction without actually deigning to look directly at them.\nAnother ghost, this one hunched over and scribbling furiously in a book, said, \"Don't forget that the new king has strong bonds to the Human side. A fact he's never tried to hide.\"\nThis statement seemed to spark an avalanche of comments from all around them.\n\"I heard the master of time himself is part of the ceremony. I just don't understand why he didn't wish for a more elaborate celebration, I would have been happy to help.\"\nThe master of time sounded like someone important. So the king has friends in high places\u2014a quick glance to John and his pale face made him reassess his conclusion slightly\u2014very high places, then.\n\"Taking him out now would be too easy, but if he thinks this little ceremony will protect him from me, the greatest hunter in the Zone, then he's up for a painful reminder.\"\nSo he didn't even have control over his future subjects. That could eventually be used against him.\n\"As long as he doesn't think that this will make me forgive all the rules he has broken. Royalty or not, I have a cell with his name on it.\"\nSo he was even a criminal in his own kingdom. Bruce exchanged a look with a wide eyed Barry, who now seemed to be starting to really worry.\nAnother ghost huffed and crossed large arms over her chest. \"Now I guess he can make his own menu and stop trying to change mine!\"\nSo he was controlling.\n\"Man, I hope this doesn't make him a total loser. If he cancels next week's race through the park then me and Shadow will fucking wreck his precious castle. Last week he beat me up for disturbing a lame meeting he was at!\"\nAggressive. Violent.\n\"I just hope he doesn't turn into a big bully. After he destroyed the school gymnasium last week all the humans looked scared of him.\"\nThe alarm bells had multiplied into a whole symphony by this point.\nSo this king had been in the human world, had been destroying things, and they hadn't noticed?\nThat made him an active threat. Especially after everything else they had heard and seen since coming here. They really had made the right decision to come here and investigate. Now the only question was how to fight him. And how to safely get Danny out from under his thumb.\nBruce's thoughts were interrupted as a sudden hush descended over the gathered ghosts, rendering the platform and its surroundings eerily still and quiet. Deathly quiet.\nHe cast a quick last look around them in the vain hope of finally spotting Danny, having to push down on his disappointment when he didn't catch sight of him, and it was only thanks to him looking around that he caught sight of the giant doors to the castle swing open on completely silent hinges.\nSo it was finally time to see the king standing behind it all, the horrible being spreading fear and destruction and threatening one of his teammates.\nBruce was very well aware of the fact that he couldn't afford to start a fight here and now, but despite his best efforts to calm himself down he realized that he had grabbed one of his batarangs in a tight grip as he waited for the bastard king to finally show himself.\nSomething stirred in the relative darkness of the dark doorway and then, without any kind of preamble or announcement, a big procession exited the castle.\nIn the very front came a ghost that looked startlingly like a combination of an old man and a clock, and who was constantly shifting from old to young and back in a dizzying merging of forms. From next to him. Bruce could sense John tensing up at the sight of this being and realized that this might be the master of time the ghosts around them had been talking about. He made a mental note to ask John about it later.\nThe shifting ghost was followed by what looked to be a huge armor-clad knight, covered in blazing purple flames and with a sword that managed to look intimidating even at this distance. He looked to most likely be a guard of some kind.\nWho came next made Bruce pause. They looked like a couple of humans who were too young to be a part of this ceremony. They were both wearing suits; one of which was covered in flower-motifs and the other with visible cables that lit up the fabric with what must have been LEDs. Flowers and lights. So they must be the ones responsible for the decorations. Strange that they were a part of the procession itself, but still somewhat understandable.\nThen came Jazz and Bruce felt his attempt to categorize the people in the procession fly out the proverbial window. What role she had in the ceremony, Bruce couldn't tell, but he could tell that what he felt at the sight of her was anger. She had said that she was going to find Danny, but instead here she was; parading down from the castle.\nHe had feared that she wasn't really on Danny's side, but this all but confirmed it.\nShe was followed by, of all things, two eyeballs with capes. Bruce surrendered himself to the fact that he wouldn't be able to make sense of a ghostly procession with human terms and a human's understanding.\nAt that point the last individual of the procession exited the darkness of the doorway, and it was a small figure that looked strangely familiar. It took Bruce a few seconds to realize what he was looking at\u2014to put together the pieces and make his brain draw the obvious conclusion\u2014 and it wasn't really until John faintly said, \"Is that\u2026?\" that it clicked.\nThe last person in the procession was Danny.\nHuh.\nWhy was Danny\u2026?\nAnd there was no denying that it was their teammate; looking uncharacteristically serious, with his head held high, and his usual jumpsuit nowhere in sight. Instead he was decked out in a mismatch of different eras and styles that still, somehow, managed to look cohesive. All of it was topped by a cape that billowed behind him as he walked, the edges of which were covered in frost that was as thin and delicate as lace.\nAll in all he was as much a gathering of eras, cultures, and styles as the ghosts surrounding them was.\nBruce had never seen him look so ghostly, so obviously a part of this strange and alien realm, but on the other hand he had also never seen him look so confident. So sure of himself. As if he fit in\u2014body and soul.\nBut if Danny was the last person in the procession, then\u2026 Where was the king?\nOr who?\nBruce looked over the procession again, scanning over the ghosts\u2014and possible humans\u2014in the procession but his eyes didn't catch on any one of them. It was impossible to single one of them out as the supposed mighty warrior, manipulator, chosen one.\nBut then again, his human assumptions didn't really work here. Maybe the guard-looking ghost was the king. With his big sword and flames he could pass for the threatening and strong king Bruce had been imagining. Or maybe it was one of the eyeballs\u2014they might be stronger than he had first assumed. Or maybe one of the ghosts who looked like teenaged humans\u2014they had certainly spread their mark around the whole area with the plants and the lights.\nBruce's eyes jumped from one to the other, mind racing as he tried to figure out who the enemy was as the whole procession strode up to the throne. Then they stopped and\u2014\nAnd\u2014\nAnd Danny stepped up.\n\"Wait,\" Barry said faintly, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait.\"\nJohn looked pale as he breathed out, \"Oh fuck me.\"\n\"I\u2014\" Bruce's brain was stalling, bluescreening like it hadn't in a very long time. \"Why is he\u2026? No, he can't\u2014\"\nBarry let out a slightly hysterical laugh. \"I think he is.\"\nJohn angrily threw his cigarette to the ground. \"What the fuck?!\"\nBarry gave another strangled laugh. \"Hey, Bats? You were right. He did have a good reason to stand us up.\"\nThe first clear thought that Bruce's reeling mind managed to come up with was I can never let my children hear about this.They would never let him live it down.\nBruce really should have asked Danny for more details.\nAnd then he met Jazz's eyes from where she was standing next to the throne and she broke out into a knowing grin, laughter in her eyes.\nShe had known. And she had let them believe the worst, had let them worry.\nBruce gave her an acknowledging nod. Well played.\nDanny stopped in front of the throne and looked out over the gathering spread out in front of him. His eyes skimmed over the three League members, before stopping and doubling back. A blinding smile spread across his face as he gave the three of them a small nod.\nThe three of them all straightened up, smiled back, and waved.\nBruce spoke out of the corner of his mouth, \"Maybe we\u2026 don't mention this little misunderstanding.\"\nJohn said, \"Agreed,\" at the same time as Barry said, \"Bold of you to assume I have any shame.\"\nBruce sent him a glare and Barry rolled his eyes before huffing, \"Fine, fine. I won't spill that you almost called the CPS on him.\"\nBruce didn't deign that with an answer, but turned his attention back to the throne and the proceedings.\nWhat followed was a fairly long speech delivered by the child-man-elder ghost, who apparently might be the master of time itself, about the history of the realm and the responsibilities of its ruler and despite the way he spoke about events all out of chronological order, it still managed to make sense.\nAnd Bruce really did his best to listen, to take this opportunity to learn as much as he could about this dimension and its beings, but his thoughts kept returning to who it was that were taking on these responsibilities.\nHow could they have missed something this big?\nBruce mentally went over all his interactions with Danny and tried to find the barest hint of him being the goddamned crown prince of a whole realm, but came up with nothing. Did that mean that this was a very recent development?\n\u2026Or that it had been going on ever since before they met him the first time? Maybe nothing had changed and that was why they hadn't noticed it. Maybe it was old news to Danny and he hadn't thought it important enough to mention, which was a very troubling thought.\nAs the clock-ghost raised a flaming crown over Danny's head Bruce almost stepped up to stop it.\nThis didn't make any sense; Danny couldn't be ready for this. He was just a child.\nBut if the last few minutes had shown him anything it was that he didn't know everything, didn't even have all the pieces to begin to have an opinion.\nSo he stayed and watched and tried to learn. No more assumptions.\nDanny knelt down and the clock-ghost held the crown over Danny's head as he said, \"Crowned in fire, energy, death, and ice, the new king is chosen and born again.\"\nThe oversized crown touched the top of Danny's head and the flames immediately died down, leaving the crown a delicate deep blue color as if it was spun out of ice.\nDanny opened his eyes and gone was the familiar green, taken over completely by a deep blue that was spread over his whole eye; iris, sclera, and all.\n\"Armed with power and a sound mind, may your reign bring infinite prosperity and peace to the Realm.\"\nDanny raised his right hand and a ring was placed on his finger, a green glowing ring which instantly changed and deepened in color until it matched the crown. Until it matched his eyes.\nThe blue seemed to seep outwards from his eyes as it spread over his whole body; changing his familiar greenish tint into something a lot more blue.\nThe clock-ghost smiled down at Danny with unmistakable pride in his eyes as he gestured for Danny to rise up. Which he did. \"May your reign stretch long into the future.\" He turned to the gathered ghosts and raised his hands high. \"The king is dead! Long live the king!\"\nThe ghosts all around erupted into cheers. If he had thought the sound had been deafening before, it was nothing to the cacophony that now rose from the masses.\nIt was loud, it was jarring, but despite it all; Bruce felt nothing but joy and pride.\nHe knew that Danny's liveliness often made the Justice League forget that he was dead, but of course Danny had the power to make a whole kingdom, a whole dimension, forget they were as well.\nBut then again, this place was a part of Danny. As much as Danny was a part of it.\nBruce could see it clearly now in the way the ice shimmered with a familiar sheen, in the way Danny moved as if he knew his surroundings like the back of his hand. And in the way the ghosts around them didn't look upon Danny\u2014their new king\u2014with fear, but rather with hope, fondness, and love. Just like the members of the Justice League had come to do as well.\nStagnation changing into renewal and life.\nWarmth in cold.\nLife in death.\nAfter the ceremony was over, Danny flew over to where Bruce, John, and Barry were standing a bit to the side of the celebration taking place. On top of being unsure of their place there, they weren't completely sure if the food and drinks were safe for them to consume.\nDanny came to a stop in front of them with a billowing cape and a sparkling crown that was only overshadowed by his bright grin. His blue blue eyes seemed to sparkle with happiness.\nUp close Bruce could see that the new blue color of his skin seemed deeper at the tips of his fingers and ears. Almost like frostbite.\nJohn didn't waste any time before dipping low in an exaggerated bow to say, \"Well hello there, your majesty.\"\nDanny groaned. \"You're the worst.\"\nBarry stepped up and even before he opened his mouth, Bruce knew that he was about to break their agreement not to mention their mistake to Danny, so he sent him a nasty glare but was promptly ignored. The traitor. Bruce would make sure Barry got scheduled for the night shifts at the Watchtower for the next month straight.\nBarry, oblivious to his sealed fate, laughed and casually said, \"Way to spring this on us, dude!\" and punctuated his exclamation with a slap on the back of Danny's head, before promptly freezing in place. \"Am I still allowed to do that?\"\n\"No?\" Danny tried as he rubbed his head.\n\"Good try,\" John deadpanned. \"You still gotta work on your lies.\"\nWell, the cat was already out of the bag so Bruce crossed his arms over his chest, donned his most disapproving face, and sternly asked, \"Why didn't you tell us about this?\"\n\"Wait. I thought you knew?\" Danny said with a tilt to his head and an almost impossible amount of innocence in his expression. It was impossible to stay mad at him. Especially when he followed it up with a careful, hesitant, \"But if you didn't, why did you come?\"\n\"You asked us to!\" Barry exclaimed as he threw his arms up in exasperation.\n\"Aww!\" Danny exclaimed with a wide smile as he slapped his hands to his own cheeks.\n\"Don't aww me!\" Barry hissed.\nBruce cleared his throat to get their attention as he tried to get the conversation back on track, \"This is really something you should have made sure we knew about beforehand.\"\n\"Okay, in my defense, I really thought you guys knew,\" Danny said as he defensively crossed his arms over his chest. \"I mean, you know everything? You're the world's greatest detective? And the John Constantine?\"\nAll eyes turned to John who in turn raised his hands in front of him defensively. \"Hey, hey! I make a point of not getting involved in whatever clusterfuck is going on over here most of the time. It's not worth the headache.\"\nDanny kept up his frown for a second longer before snorting and letting his crossed arms fall to his sides. \"That's fair.\"\n\"Are you supposed to agree with that? It's your kingdom?\" Barry pointed out with an incredulous expression.\n\"I know,\" Danny groaned, scrubbing a hand down his face. \"Don't remind me.\"\nJohn's eyes immediately zeroed in on Danny's hand as he cleared his throat and carefully asked, \"Is that\u2014is that what I think it is?\"\nDanny frowned in confusion before looking down at his own hand and the dark blue ring now adorning it. Probably,\" he heaved a sigh with a grimace before clarifying, \"It's the ring of rage.\"\nThe name didn't mean anything to Bruce, but if the way John visibly paled and took a step backwards was anything to go by, it did mean a whole lot to his teammate. And anything that could make John Constantine flinch was worth taking seriously.\nJohn opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again, before managing, \"I thought it was dest\u2014\" He stopped, cleared his throat, tried again, \"Why do you have that? Do you know how dangerous that thing is? If it doesn't accept you, it could\u2014\"\nDanny didn't look surprised or worried at his words, instead he simply shrugged and said, \"The king needs a weapon.\"\nBarry raised an eyebrow and pointed out the obvious, \"That's not a weapon. It's a ring.\"\nInstead of responding, Danny raised his hand in front of him, closed his fist, and suddenly the ring seemed to\u2026 melt. It spread across the back of his fingers and Bruce blinked in surprise, fully expecting it to form into a great sword, a long spear, or even some new form of ghostly weapon he had never seen before.\nInstead it stopped at the edges of Danny's fingers before it seemed to solidify and it took Bruce a few seconds to recognize the shape of it. \"Is that a\u2026 brass knuckle?\"\nWell. That was anticlimactic.\nBut Danny didn't look disappointed; instead he gazed down at the weapon with a big smile. And on a second thought, considering how Danny fought, Bruce guessed that it was a fitting weapon.\nBarry looked from the knuckles to Danny with a confused frown. \"That's\u2026 neat?\"\n\"I know!\" Danny beamed and lowered his hand as the knuckles morphed back into an unassuming ring.\nJohn blinked owlishly as he breathed out, \"The ring accepted you\u2026\"\nWhich made Danny turn his attention to John with a worried expression. \"Are you okay?\"\n\"The crown of fire and the ring of rage\u2026\" John muttered, face still white. \"I've never heard of anyone being able to handle both and not go immediately insane\u2026\"\n\"It's not on fire anymore!\" Danny argued and underscored his point by waving at the very-much-not-on-fire-crown resting on his head.\nThis didn't seem to have the effect Danny wanted it to as John continued to look speechless.\nThere was a few awkward seconds of silence before Barry clapped his hands loudly to break it. \"Well, we're happy for you either way.\" He hesitated a moment before awkwardly adding, \"Both for the position, and the not going crazy part.\"\nBruce made the executive decision to ignore this for the time being\u2014and grill John on details later\u2014and focus on Danny and making sure he knew he had their support. Running a whole realm was bound to be a lot of work, especially for a teenager. So he nodded and said, \"Yes, we will support you in any way we can with your new duties.\"\n\"Thanks!\" Danny said with a genuinely pleased smile. \"I gotta admit, if I had any say in the matter I don't think I would have taken the position. But apparently that's not how it works.\" He rolled his eyes with a scoff. \"As if punching old crazies trying to take over the world is a good basis for a system of government.\"\nBarry held up a hand to stop him. \"Wait, wait, wait. You didn't want this?\"\n\"I mean\u2026 I didn't exactly want any of this,\" Danny said with a gesture towards himself and his undeniable ghostliness, \"but here we are.\"\nOkay. Maybe he wasn't as on board as Bruce had thought. Maybe he still needed saving. \"Do you need us to get you out?\"\nBarry nodded before adding, \"I would totally beat someone up for you if you asked.\"\nDanny gave a startled laugh. \"Thanks for the offer, but I already tried that angle, but the damned Observants always come back\u2026\" Danny pursed his lips in thought for a silent moment, hands fiddling with the ring on his finger. \"I'm not sure I would give it up, though. I have had some time to think about it and\u2026I know I'm not the best, but I'm willing to learn. Which really is more than I can say for some of the people wanting to get their hands on the crown. Besides, I have some great teachers.\"\nThat was\u2026 a lot to take in. But Bruce focused on the truly important part and said, \"I think you not wanting it makes you especially fit to have it.\"\nFor some reason, that made Danny laugh. \"Believe it or not, but someone else said almost exactly the same thing. But he's a very old man, so I don't know if you want to be compared to him.\"\nBruce smiled. \"That just means you have good people around you.\"\n\"You mean that you're good? Don't get so full of yourself!\" Danny laughed before turning to Barry with a raised eyebrow. \"Oh, I wanted to ask! So, do you believe in ghosts now?\"\n\"Eeeeh,\" Barry hedged, waving his hand in a so-so gesture. \"The jury is still out on that one.\nJohn\u2014apparently having regained some of his composure by now\u2014rolled his eyes at this, \"You are literally standing in the Infinite Realms. The realm of the dead.\"\nDanny raised a hand. \"I am the King of the dead.\"\nBarry waved them both off. \"All just fancy words.\"\nDanny laughed, bright and free, and the sound bounced off the ice around them until it seemed to come from all directions\u2014until it filled the whole space. As if the whole realm laughed with him. \"You're impossible!\"\nBarry held his hands up in a disarming gesture, but his wide smile was absolutely unrepentant as he said, \"Whatever you say, your majesty.\"\n\"Stoooop,\" Danny whined while burying his face in his hands.\nJohn raised an eyebrow, smirked, and asked, \"Is that an order, your majesty?\"\n\"You're never gonna let me live this down, are you?\"\nBruce shook his head with a solemn expression. \"Never.\""
