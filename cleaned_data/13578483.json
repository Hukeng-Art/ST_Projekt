    "text": "\nSakura couldn\u2019t say what possessed Naruto to do what he did, in the end.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trusting you.\u201d Is all Naruto said, white-faced and agonized, when Sakura had asked \n\nwhat the hell is that seal?\n\n\n\nHe slammed his palms to the seal, Sakura saw the white hair of Kaguya appearing overhead, and the blue glow of the seal overtook all her senses.\n\n\nThe next thing she knew, she was waking up in the bloody \n\nWarring States Period.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a long, awkward moment while the Senju and Uchiha stare at her, pausing in their battle at her rather dramatic entrance. There\u2019s a crater under her feet, smoking and boiling, and her chakra is \n\nstifling\n\n in it\u2019s intensity - because she\u2019d had the Strength of a Hundred active when Naruto pulled his shitty stunt, and for some reason, she can\u2019t put the damn thing away.\n\n\n\u201cHello.\u201d Sakura says pleasantly, still trying to figure out \n\nwhat the fuck.\n\n\n\nTime travel was the obvious, if bizarre, answer. \n\n\nNaruto had sent her back in time. \n\n\nFor some fucking reason.\n\n\nEven though he was the \n\nobvious choice\n\n for such a mission.\n\n\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Madara \n\nFucking\n\n Uchiha demands, gunbai in one hand and scythe in the other, and Sakura opens her mouth to answer, pauses, and then offers a shrug.\n\n\n\u201cJust an innocent traveller who got a little bit lost. Where am I again?\u201d She asks curiously.\n\n\nMadara twitches. Hashirama stares at her with a small, puzzled frown.\n\n\n\u201cThe Land of Fire. The Senju and Uchiha border.\u201d Tobirama says very, very flatly, clearly unamused.\n\n\nThere\u2019s an Uchiha who looks frighteningly similar to Sasuke just a few feet away from him, sword \n\nstill\n\n raised, though he looks uncertain. \n\n\n\u201cSenju and Uchiha?\u201d Sakura echoes, reaching up to scratch at a small bit of dried blood on her face. \n\n\n\nSasuke\u2019s blood,\n\n she reflects, remembering the way he\u2019d fallen just hours before.\n\n\nOr, well.\n\n\nYears in the future.\n\n\nApparently.\n\n\nHm.\n\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s strange. I was in the Land of Lightning a few seconds ago.\u201d Sakura muses.\n\n\nThe last stronghold against Kaguya and her Zetsu forces, which only churned out more and more numbers by the day, while theirs dwindled drastically.\n\n\nA war they were destined to lose.\n\n\nTeam Seven was one of the last standing group of any real strength left. Even the infinitely regenerating Hokage had fallen to Kaguya\u2019s disintegrating bones.\n\n\nKakashi had died two weeks ago.\n\n\nSasuke had died maybe two hours ago.\n\n\nNaruto was probably already dead.\n\n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 the only one left.\n\n\nSomehow.\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you end up here?\u201d Hashirama asks in a purely curious tone, and Sakura blinks, returning her attention to the present.\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d She questions, frowning. Madara shifts, teeth gritted.\n\n\n\u201cYou said you were in the Land of Lightning.\u201d Hashirama explains patiently. She\u2019d almost think his guard was down, were he not still touching the seal rolled up on his back. It was huge and bulky, not unlike the one Naruto sometimes chose to fight with.\n\n\nHer gaze lingers on it for a second before she hums thoughtfully. \n\n\n\u201cWell, honestly, I haven\u2019t the slightest clue.\u201d She admits with a smile.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Madara lashes out, Hashirama shouting something, and Sakura watches impassively as he approaches.\n\n\n\nGood, kill me. I\u2019m the only one left anyways,\n\n she thinks.\n\n\nUntil a beam of light slams down around her, so suddenly that even Madara slides to a stop, lowering into a defensive crouch with his gunbai at the ready.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I think.\u201d The Sage of Six Paths\u2019 voice echoes through the clearing, and the man appears at her side. Sakura blinks, looking at him incredulously. \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u201d Hashirama, sliding to a stop behind Madara, gapes. \u201cYou\u2019re-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d The Sage confirms, his ghostly hand settling without touch on her shoulder. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for my daughter and I to take our leave.\u201d\n\n\n\nYour what.\n\n\n\n\u201cDaughter?\u201d Hashirama echoes, blinking rapidly.\n\n\nIt\u2019s laughable at best. The Sage is very obviously alien. And Sakura has pink hair.\n\n\n\u201cYou have a limited supply now, daughter. We mustn\u2019t waste our time here.\u201d The Sage says quietly, his hand squeezing but still not \n\ntouching,\n\n and Sakura frowns at him.\n\n\n\u201cLimited supply?\u201d She wonders, and then blinks.\n\n\nHer chakra.\n\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\n\n...Frozen.\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t even flowing through her, even though it should be, since she still has the Strength of a Hundred apparently on the permanent setting, which she hadn\u2019t known was possible.\n\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go, now. We have work to do.\u201d The Sage says, and with a sweeping look across the battlefield, he frowns down to Madara and Hashirama. \u201cI am sorely disappointed in you. If you would only work together, you could achieve the most incredible things. You could make your dreams - and my own - a reality.\u201d\n\n\nHashirama gapes. Madara narrows his eyes.\n\n\nSakura tilts her head and looks at the Uchiha. \u201cAlso, your brother was about to die when I got here.\u201d She says idly, and Madara\u2019s head whips around to look at the Sasuke-Impersonator. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Perhaps you should rethink this strategy of protecting your family, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, war has a way of leading to casualties, incidentally.\u201d The Sage agrees mildly.\n\n\n\u201cSurprisingly enough.\u201d Sakura concurs.\n\n\n\u201cLet us depart.\u201d The Sage says firmly, and in the blink of an eye and the brush of foreign chakra, Sakura\u2019s suddenly in\u2026\n\n\n\u201cIs this Kamui?\u201d Sakura blinks at the disorienting black space.\n\n\n\u201cI thought we could use some privacy to speak alone.\u201d The Sage explains. \u201cI saw Naruto Uzumaki\u2019s last act. I latched onto your chakra at the last moment so that I might accompany you and guide your hand. A good idea it seems, as you\u2019ve been dropped in entirely foreign times.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was bullshitting Madara. That \n\nwas\n\n his brother fighting Tobirama, yes?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Izuna. One of many victims to the Curse of Hatred. But together, you and I might be able to stop things at the source now.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll I want to do is die,\n\n Sakura thinks.\n\n\nBut Naruto had said he trusted her.\n\n\nSo she looks at the Sage curiously, pushing away her grief and leaving numbness in its wake.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Sakura comes out of Kamui, years have passed.\n\n\nNot for her - but for them.\n\n\nIt\u2019s obvious because she\u2019s standing on a table in the middle of a room, with Hashirama, Madara, Izuna, Tobirama, and who she is pretty sure is Mito Uzumaki, all sitting at it and staring at her.\n\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d Sakura notes, blinking. \u201cAwkward.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d Hashirama proclaims, leaping to his feet so fast his chair tumbles, and he jabs a finger at her.\n\n\n\u201cMe.\u201d Sakura confirms with a nod.\n\n\n\u201cHow did y\nou get here?!\u201d Madara snarls and Sakura shrugs.\n\n\n\u201cHonestly? I have no idea.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the woman from the battle.\u201d Izuna cuts in, brows furrowed, and he\u2019s still alive, which is a good sign.\n\n\n\u201cQuite \npossibly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Sage\u2019s daughter.\u201d Tobirama says flatly, like he doesn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\nWho would, though, honestly?\n\n\nShe shrugs, neither confirming nor denying.\n\n\n\u201cUnlikely, as he\u2019s been dead for centuries.\u201d Mito notes, eyes narrowing.\n\n\n\u201cWell technically I haven\u2019t been alive for a good number of years either.\u201d Sakura can\u2019t help but muse. Even if they\u2019re on opposite ends of the spectrum in this case.\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re undead?\u201d Hashirama asks.\n\n\n\u201cPossibly?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat would explain why I can\u2019t sense you. Mito?\u201d Tobirama questions, and the woman inclines her head.\n\n\n\u201cThe same.\u201d She murmurs.\n\n\n\u201cAh. Well, I\u2019m definitely not alive.\u201d Sakura offers with a frown. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, she awkwardly climbs down from the table, dropping between Hashirama and Mito. \u201cSo. How many years has it been?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Madara snaps and Sakura shoots him a flat look.\n\n\nLike she\u2019d ask if she did.\n\n\n\u201cFour. We\u2019ve built a village together and named it Konohagakure.\u201d Hashirama says, a little bubbly, and Sakura smiles warmly.\n\n\n\u201cGood. The Sage would be proud.\u201d Assuming Madara doesn\u2019t go and try to destroy it all again. \u201cNice job.\u201d She walks over to the window and looks out at the tiny budding village. She can see the Nara district by the forests, which means the Yamanaka, Akimichi, and Sarutobi clans have already joined\u2026 \u201cYou should put a face on that mountain.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...What?\u201d Hashirama asks, stepping up beside her and looking out. \n\n\n\u201cYou know, for the Hokage. So the village knows they\u2019re always being looked over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cExactly what we need. Hashirama looming over us all for the end of time.\u201d Madara says flatly.\n\n\n\u201cMmm. Well, I probably came here for a reason. Any \n\nsage\n\n advice you need?\u201d Sakura asks, turning around and leaning against the window sill. \n\n\nMadara stares at her icily.\n\n\n\u201cWell. We were debating if we could possibly use the legendary bij\u016b to broker a peace treaty between the five Great Shinobi Nation-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sakura says very, very firmly.\n\n\nHashirama wilts visibly. \u201cNo?\u201d He asks, wounded.\n\n\n\u201cThe bij\u016b are my friends. Touch them and I will hurt you. They have minds and wills just like we do. They are made of chakra, but they are every bit as intelligent and \n\nfree\n\n as we are. Leave them alone.\u201d Sakura instructs.\n\n\n\u201cThe Ky\u016bbi destroyed two villages in the past month.\u201d Mito states coolly.\n\n\nSakura considers that for a moment.\n\n\n\u201c...I\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBad fox.\u201d Sakura scolds.\n\n\nKurama stares at her from where his head is resting on his paws. He blinks slowly, head tilting a bit. \u201cI can smell the Sage on you.\u201d He says slowly.\n\n\n\u201cAnd I can smell blood on you. \n\nBad.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey deserved it for sending hunting parties against me.\u201d Kurama snarls.\n\n\n\u201c...I\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeople are very complicated.\u201d Sakura tells the Sage inside Kamui, after she\u2019s done threatening every village in a fifty mile radius of each bij\u016b. Aside from Isobu, who is in the middle of a freakin\u2019 ocean right now.\n\n\n\u201cThey dislike what they do not understand. And worse yet, they try to enslave what goes against their basic natures.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m supposed to stop them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps you aren\u2019t. All we can do is the best that we can.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not enough?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen it is of no fault of your own, but of the people refusing to listen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou make it sound easy.\u201d Sakura sighs, rubbing her eyes. \n\n\n\u201cThis was never going to be easy, Haruno Sakura. All I can do is make it easier.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBy teleporting me from one time to another without explanation?\u201d She can\u2019t help but ask sarcastically.\n\n\n\u201cI said help, not do your job for you.\u201d The Sage counters dryly. \u201cYou were sent here for a reason. All I can do is assist you.\u201d\n\n\nSakura gives a frustrated sound.\n\n\n\u201cFine. Where to next, \n\nassistant?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Sage\u2019s eyes glimmer with amusement.\n\n\nSakura appears on a battlefield just in time to get impaled in the stomach. A sharp noise escapes her, a harsh gasp sounding \n\njust\n\n behind her, and she promptly punches her attacker so hard he flies a hundred yards and takes down twenty others with him. She yanks the sword free and her chakra actually moves for a second, sealing the wound behind it. \u201cThat,\u201d Sakura gestures with the bloodied sword, \u201cwas \n\nrude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Izuna asks from behind her, breathless with ill concealed fear. Sakura glances at him briefly, then brushes a palm again him. Chakra moves, and in seconds, his wounds are sealed. He stares at her, eyes wide. \u201cYou saved my life. Again. Why?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say your brother\u2019s mental health hinges unfairly on your continued survival. Try not to die.\u201d Sakura instructs, then turns towards him. \u201cI\u2019ve never used a sword before. Am I holding it right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFuck it.\u201d She drops the sword. \u201cKONOHA RETREAT!\u201d She bellows as loud as she can, and then slams her fist into the earth.\n\n\nThe battleground explodes.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow can a ghost be covered in blood?\u201d Izuna asks as he walks with her through the camp, watching her silently heal dozens of people with just a brush of her hand. They\u2019re all watching her with wide eyes, having seen the utter devastation she\u2019d wrought, only to turn around and heal with breathtaking ease. \n\n\n\u201cIt happened before I became a ghost. My best friend, an Uchiha, actually, died protecting me.\u201d Sakura says absently, deliberately not thinking about it. For her, it had only been maybe a day ago still.\n\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d He says, then pauses. \u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t see. How could anyone die with you anywhere nearby them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was out of chakra.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow does a person with no chakra become a ghost with chakra?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMagic.\u201d Sakura says blandly. \u201cNo idea. Still trying to figure out how this happened to me, actually. Pretty sure it was my other best friend\u2019s fault. Asshole.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Sage had two sons, not a daughter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re terrible at sticking to one subject. I\u2019m adopted.\u201d Sakura lies, healing a six year old with no business on a battlefield. The little girl smiles at her through a mouthful of bloody teeth. The smile of a shinobi. Sakura smiles warmly back. \u201cBesides,\u201d She adds, straightening up. \u201cTurns out there\u2019s not a lot of room for a bathtub in the afterlife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuna asks in confusion and Sakura shrugs, pointing at her blood streaked face.\n\n\n\u201cYou asked about the blood first. I\u2019m just trying to make sure we actually cover all your subjects of interest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow the hell did you do what you did to that battlefield?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery, very, \n\nvery\n\n good chakra control.\u201d Sakura explains with a nod.\n\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Izuna frowns softly, and without warning, his eyes flicker red. The Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan stares at her, eyeing her from head to toe, and he looks mildly frustrated before tucking the Sharingan away again. \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t like what you see?\u201d Sakura asks in some amusement.\n\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t see any chakra flow in you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I \n\nam\n\n a ghost.\u201d\n\n\nShe\u2019s not a ghost, but she\u2019s not sure what she actually \n\nis,\n\n so she\u2019s just going with it.\n\n\n\u201cUhg.\u201d Izuna offers in annoyance. \u201cWell, thank you for-\u201d He turns, and she\u2019s already gone.\n\n\n\u201cRude.\u201d Sakura accuses the Sage of Six Paths from within Kamui.\n\n\n\u201cGood work. On to the next task.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRude \n\nand \n\na slave driver.\u201d Sakura huffs, but folds her arms across her chest and waits.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo.\u201d Sakura says as she appears in the real world again.\n\n\nShe\u2019s disappointed to not see Hashirama or Madara, but instead Tobirama as Hokage and Izuna, surprisingly, at his side.\n\n\nTobirama\u2019s eyes narrow, and the red orbs glare fiercely at her. Izuna\u2019s eyes flicker red too, the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan activating. \u201cGet off my desk.\u201d\n\n\nSakura considers for a second.\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She decides, folding her legs under her and ignoring the rustling of the paperwork under her. She already knocked off a stack, apparently, because it\u2019s splayed across the floor. \u201cWhat happened to Hashirama and Madara?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey died.\u201d Izuna says coldly. Sakura tilts her head a bit, looking at him inquisitively. \u201cFor a ghost, you\u2019re surprisingly uninformed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t spend much time in this world, you know. You\u2019re not \n\nthat\n\n important.\u201d Sakura says chidingly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t kill each other in a horribly cataclysmic battle involving the Ky\u016bbi, did they? Because I meant what I said about the Ky\u016bbi being a friend, and I\u2019d be very offended on his behalf if that happened.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a moment where they stare at her.\n\n\nThe pen in Tobirama\u2019s hand breaks. Ink ruins even more of the paperwork than she had.\n\n\n\u201cThey fell in battle. Not with each other. Alongside each other.\u201d He says very, very frigidly.\n\n\n\u201cAh. Well.\u201d Sakura considers that for a moment, frowning thoughtfully.\n\n\nThat was\u2026 unexpected. Then again, Izuna \n\nhad\n\n been the trigger that sent Madara spiraling into madness to begin with.\n\n\nStill, that meant\u2026\n\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any freaky DNA babies did they?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nShe takes that as a no.\n\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d No Rinnegan then. Fascinating. \n\n\n\u201cYou still have blood all over you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, like I said, no bathtubs, unfortunately. Hey, what year is it?\u201d Sakura asks curiously, ignoring the angry twitching in Tobirama\u2019s temple. Izuna, on the flipside, actually seems to have calmed down.\n\n\nHe spouts off the year and Sakura frowns, propping an elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, thinking.\n\n\nThis is the year Tobirama is supposed to die.\n\n\n\u201cHm. Well. This\u2019ll be the last time we speak, Tobirama-sama, so listen well, will you?\u201d She asks, making her voice gentler but still severe. She feels oddly saddened by this fact. He frowns, looking at her with narrowed eyes still. \u201cWhatever you do, do \n\nnot\n\n restrict the Military Force to only Uchiha Clan members.\u201d She says, and Tobirama blinks at her, surprise clear in his red eyes. \u201cI know how you feel about the Clan. I understand you\u2019re merely trying to channel their skills and mindsets. However, by limiting the members to only the Uchiha Clan, you\u2019ll only end up ostracising them, inciting their Curse of Hatred against Konoha.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a moment of tense silence in the room.\n\n\n\u201cThe Curse of- no. What are you suggesting?\u201d Izuna demands sharply, fists clenching at his side. \u201cMy people would never go against Konoha. Not after everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps. Perhaps not.\u201d Sakura says mildly, frowning and tapping her fingers rhythmically against her chin. \u201cHowever, the risk is there. Wouldn\u2019t you rather simply avoid the risk all together, and spare the Uchiha Clan the hatred and distrust of Konoha\u2019s shinobi as a whole?\u201d She points out.\n\n\nTobirama\u2019s eyes narrow again. \u201cI do not believe the Uchiha Clan would turn against Konoha either.\u201d He says firmly, and gets a surprised glance from Izuna for that. \n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tobirama shoots him an irritated look. \u201cI took Kagami under my wing, didn\u2019t I? I made you my advisor, did I not? I have no prejudice against the Uchiha Clan. I simply understand the risks of their emotions, and this is my attempt at funneling that into a good cause. The Uchiha are uniquely capable of maintaining order over the shinobi forces due to their Sharingan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Sakura acknowledges. \u201cHowever, just as the Uchiha are uniquely capable of \n\ndetaining\n\n straying shinobi, the Inuzuka, for instance, are uniquely capable of \n\nfinding\n\n straying shinobi. And the Hy\u016bga are uniquely capable of identifying said shinobi when their in a large mass of innocent people, should they attempt to lose their trackers in a crowd. The Yamanaka are uniquely capable of \n\ninterrogating\n\n these shinobi straying from the path. The Hatake-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI understand your point.\u201d Tobirama cuts her off coolly. \u201cI will consider your proposal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d She smiles warmly at him. It feels bitter on her face. \n\n\nIf she can\u2019t stop the Massacre at the source, she\u2019ll simply have to find another way.\n\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ll listen to me, Tobirama-sama. This is the last piece of advice I can offer you, I suspect.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Tobirama asks smoothly, setting down the ruined remains of his broken pen.\n\n\nShe considers for a moment, and then sighs. \u201cBecause you won\u2019t live to see the end of this war, Tobirama-sama.\u201d She stands up, dropping from the desk, and doesn\u2019t turn to see their expressions. Her heart aches strangely in her chest. \n\n\nTime is flying past her now, and a decade has passed in a mere day and a half for her. \n\n\n\u201cOh, and Tobirama?\u201d She adds with a frown, before the Sage can pull her away now that her task is complete. She looks at him over her shoulder, frowning severely, and ignores the stricken expression Izuna wears. There\u2019s a vast difference between them now and the pair who had fought to the death in her life. \u201cWork with Danz\u014d with what time you have. Otherwise he\u2019ll fall into a darkness so deep he\u2019ll lose all sight of your teachings, and the meaning of the Will of Fire.\u201d\n\n\nTobirama stares at her intently before he gives a very, very shallow incline of his head. \u201cFarewell, shiry\u014d.\u201d He says, and that brings a small grin to her face.\n\n\n\nDead, vengeful spirit.\n\n\n\n\nWell, you aren\u2019t wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cFarewell, Tobirama-sama.\u201d\n\n\nKamui drags her away moments later.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing excellently.\u201d The Sage tells her as he gives her a few minutes to recover mentally.\n\n\n\u201cI feel like you\u2019re dragging me behind an out of control horse carriage.\u201d Sakura says flatly, lying on her back and staring up into the black abyss of Kamui\u2019s sky.\n\n\n\u201cWe have much ground to cover, and a limited amount of chakra to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo we?\u201d She questions idly. \u201cExactly what ground do I have to cover?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to save the world, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The Sage points out and Sakura frowns.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for \n\nnothing\n\n but the crazed whims of Naruto\u2019s desperation.\u201d\n\n\nThe Sage falls silent at that.\n\n\n\u201c...Then we must endure, as shinobi are wont to do, and use this to our advantage.\u201d\n\n\nSakura closes her eyes, exhaling through her nose. She\u2019s tired, but not physically. It\u2019s like her body has been frozen in time, but her mind still works at light speed. \n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She says, opening her eyes again. \u201cLet\u2019s save the world, shall we?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThis time, the jump is bigger than ever.\n\n\nShe opens her eyes to find Kamui dropping her onto a beach. \n\n\nA very nice, sunny beach.\n\n\nWhich is under siege.\n\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Sakura says, blinking. \n\n\nThere\u2019s red hair all around her. \n\n\nUzushio?\n\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\n\nNow that she thinks about it, is Kushina even in Konoha? She\u2019d have no reason to be, without the need for a new host for Kurama\u2026\n\n\nSakura looks at the smoke-seared sky, frowns deeper, and sighs.\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\n\nShe turns towards the village being systematically destroyed by Kumo and Kiri shinobi, and begins her search.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019d had Sasuke\u2019s splattered blood all over her when she first came to the past.\n\n\nNow, she\u2019s positively soaked in it.\n\n\nShe attacks relentlessly and without hesitation, carving and obliterating a bloody swathe through the masses swarming Uzushio. The village is cut off, surrounded on all sides, and she can sense Konoha shinobi in the distance, attempting to break through Kumo\u2019s forces to aid their ally village. \n\n\nTo her surprise, she finds Kushina relatively quickly. The girl is six, maybe seven, and shouting like mad as she uses chakra chains to destroy anyone who earns her ire. \n\n\nWhich is, really, everyone.\n\n\n\u201cYo!\u201d Sakura greets with a smile, channeling her inner Kakashi.\n\n\nKushina\u2019s chains falter, then whip out and pass straight through her. \u201cGet back!\u201d The girl shrieks.\n\n\n\u201cNope. Come with me. We need to secure an evacuation route.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cEvacuate where?!\u201d Kushina snarls, but her chains pull back a bit. Between the two girls, there\u2019s no one left to disturb their brief chat.\n\n\n\u201cTo Konoha. They\u2019re trapped at the border, behind a mass of Kumo shinobi. How do you like the idea of slaughtering them all and paving a way for Konoha\u2019s assistance?\u201d Sakura asks cheerfully.\n\n\nKushina\u2019s eyes glitter with rage.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShiry\u014d.\u201d A young(ish) Sandaime greets her as she and Kushina break through the Kumo swarm.\n\n\n\u201cHiruzen!\u201d Sakura cries out joyously, even if it feels weird and \n\nwrong\n\n to use his name like that. \u201cLovely to meet you. Tobirama-sama told me about you.\u201d She lies baldly. \u201cThis is Kushina-chan. She\u2019s awesome. Lots of murder in her. Very good potential for a Konoha shinobi. Kushina, say hi. Be nice. Stop glaring at me.\u201d Sakura instructs.\n\n\nThe red-haired girl glares at her.\n\n\n\u201cMaa, children these days. So rude.\u201d Sakura bemoans. Hiruzen tenses, staff rising. She turns and kicks out, slamming her foot into the chest of a charging Kumo nin.\n\n\nHe flies.\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t scream, his chest collapsed and all his ribs and sternum shattered. It\u2019ll be a quick death, but a painful one. \n\n\nHe probably deserves that.\n\n\n\u201cCome with us. We need to secure the island.\u201d Sakura offers a hand, not to take, but in an inviting gesture.\n\n\nAfter a long minute, Hiruzen glances at his teammates - who look like the Hokage\u2019s councillors, Sakura realizes belatedly - and nods curtly. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Hiruzen bellows, and the Konoha shinobi fall in. \n\n\nSakura and Kushina turn, leading them rapidly back to the island.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhen it\u2019s all over and the population of Uzushio has been collapsed to a mere five hundred or so, Sakura sits at a campfire across from Hiruzen and his teammates, with Kushina collapsed against her side and snoring. \n\n\nShe\u2019s honestly impressed. The girl can\u2019t be much higher than Genin in rank, yet she held out for almost the entire battle, using her chains relentlessly. \n\n\n\u201cTobirama-sensei told us about you, Shiry\u014d.\u201d Hiruzen says, smoking from his familiar, ever present pipe. \n\n\n\u201cHe claimed he could never sense you.\u201d Koharu adds with a frown. \u201cHe was the best sensor to ever come out of the Land of Fire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, he was, and will continue to be for some time.\u201d Sakura confirms, frowning thoughtfully. She lifts a knee to drape her arm over it, humming. \u201cI\u2019m apparently undead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cApparently?\u201d Homura echoes, eyes narrowing.\n\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cIt was a jutsu. It went wrong. We were desperate.\u201d She explains, waving a hand dismissively. \u201cThe Sage saved me. Took me under his hand. Now, we work together to pave the way for a better future.\u201d Sakura says, glancing consideringly at the snoozing Kushina.\n\n\nHiruzen takes that moment to prod her with his staff. Or, well, attempt to. It passes through her skull.\n\n\nShe frowns at him. \u201cRude.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was curious.\u201d Hiruzen says unapologetically. \u201cTobirama-sensei called you Shiry\u014d. A vengeful, dead ghost.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. He\u2019s probably onto something. Or, sorry, \n\nwas \n\nprobably onto something.\u201d Sakura amends awkwardly, frowning deeper in discomfort. \n\n\nTime is flying past her, and all she can do is be dragged along after it.\n\n\nSpeaking of\u2026\n\n\n\u201cI think my time here is about up.\u201d Sakura muses, glancing behind her and at the ruins of Uzushio. \u201cWhat will you do with them?\u201d She asks curiously.\n\n\n\u201cTake them in, of course. Uzushio has been our ally since before our founding.\u201d Hiruzen says firmly, exhaling a puff of smoke. \u201cShiry\u014d.\u201d He draws her attention back to him and she looks at him questioningly. \u201cWhy are you vengeful?\u201d\n\n\nShe blinks at the unexpected question. After a moment, she offers a small grin, bitter and angry. \u201cWell, Hiruzen-san, when you see the end of the world, feel the lives of everyone you\u2019ve ever known slip through your fingers like a hot knife through butter\u2026 you find a lot of reasons to seek vengeance.\u201d\n\n\nHis brow furrows and his teammates exchange a glance. \u201cThe end of the world?\u201d He echoes and she hums lightly, nodding her head. \n\n\n\u201cTell me, Hiruzen, have you ever heard the tale of the J\u016bbi?\u201d\n\n\nSilence reigns for a moment before he shakes his head, eyes narrowing in thought. \u201cI can\u2019t say I have.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cResearch it.\u201d Sakura suggests, rising to her feet and brushing drying blood flakes off her pants. It\u2019s a lost cause, really, but she can\u2019t help but try. \u201cThe Uchiha have better records than anyone gives them credit for. And so do the Senju, of course.\u201d She adds thoughtfully. \u201cInquire into it, Hiruzen-san. Then you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m trying to prevent from happening again - and why, I should reiterate,\u201d She adds dangerously, eyes narrowing, \u201cI \n\nwill\n\n protect the bij\u016b from any and all attempts to capture them. No matter who tries.\u201d\n\n\nThe threat sends the tension skyrocketing, but Sakura doesn\u2019t even really notice, flicking a small glob of blood off her shoulder. She feels a familiar prickling along her skin and nods her head politely at Hiruzen and his teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go. Give Kushina my appreciation, will you? She\u2019s a very skilled girl, this one. Take care of her.\u201d\n\n\nHiruzen studies her for a long minute, and just before Kamui swallows her whole, he nods. \u201cWe will.\u201d He promises.\n\n\nShe\u2019s gone an instant later.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nShe reappears just in time to feel Kakashi\u2019s chakra vanish alongside two mystery chakras. \n\n\nObito\u2019s chakra tickles her senses a short distance away, and with a sinking feeling, she turns to see a pile of rubble where a cave once stood.\n\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Sakura realizes, the bodies of Iwa shinobi sprinkling the ground around the cave in. \n\n\n\nWell, this is awkward,\n\n she muses, but after a moment, she steps towards the cave in. \n\n\nIt takes a simple touch of chakra, and the boulders are exploding, carefully directed upwards and \n\naway\n\n from the cave itself. Sakura hums lightly to herself as she sends boulder after boulder flying away, until finally, she finds her foot sinking into a pool of blood.\n\n\nTwo boulders later, and she\u2019s prying free the crushed body of one Obito Uchiha.\n\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Sakura repeats, looking down at the unconscious body of her once-foe.\n\n\n\nDefinitely awkward,\n\n she decides, before crouching down and pressing a hand to his chest.\n\n\nShe lets the Strength of a Hundred course through him, doing her work the easy way.\n\n\nThen she hefts the boy up, ignoring the way his arm remains limp and slightly smooshed, and hauls him off towards Konoha.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYo!\u201d She greets Hiruzen, smiling with her mouth and her eyes.\n\n\nHiruzen frowns at her, not at his desk but instead meeting her out on the balcony. \u201cI could sense you approaching. Of course, I didn\u2019t know it was \n\nyou.\n\n But I gathered from your strength.\u201d His gaze drifts over Obito, still unconscious and limp on her back.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually using chakra right now. I think I\u2019ve figured out this undead thing. So long as I\u2019m \n\nusing\n\n chakra, I\u2019m solid and can be sensed. But once I stop actively using it, I become unsensible and untouchable again.\u201d\n\n\nTo prove it, she stops channeling chakra.\n\n\nObito promptly falls straight through her. \n\n\nShe catches him with chakra infused arms and hauls him back up, just before he would\u2019ve hit the ground. \n\n\n\u201cFascinating.\u201d Hiruzen admits almost reluctantly, peering at her intently before his gaze flickers to Obito. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Obito Uchiha.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\n\nSakura blinks in surprise.\n\n\n\u201c...Did you just imply I beat the \n\nYellow Flash\n\n back to Konoha?\u201d She questions.\n\n\nHiruzen arches a brow.\n\n\nSakura does as well.\n\n\n\u201c...Huh. Okay, well anyways, I found this one trapped under a cave in, smashed by some boulders, missing a Sharingan, and his arm is probably beyond saving but they might be able to replace the bones with metal. I have no idea, I don\u2019t actually know how advanced medical science is nowadays. Good luck. Bye!\u201d Sakura sets Obito down and flickers away.\n\n\nShe has \n\none other thing\n\n to do before she goes back into Kamui.\n\n\nTwo weeks later, Jiraiya reports to Hiruzen about a mysterious woman matching Shiry\u014d\u2019s description threatening over a hundred villages if they dare to touch her precious bij\u016b.\n\n\n(Just in case they\u2019ve forgotten after all these years.)\n\n\nShe also innocently suggests Isobu leaves Kirigakure\u2019s area and heads back to the ocean for a decade or so.\n\n\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nThe next time she appears in the real world, it\u2019s almost unrecognizable.\n\n\nShe\u2019s changed \n\nso much,\n\n and now she can really, truly see it for herself. \n\n\n\u201c...Shiry\u014d?\u201d Minato Namikaze questions, staring at her blankly.\n\n\n\u201cHey, good guess.\u201d Sakura applauds, smiling at him warmly. There\u2019s a bundle in his arms, and Kushina\u2019s passed out on the sofa a few feet away. \u201cIs this your home?\u201d She asks curiously, and Minato numbly nods. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s a first for me. Usually I appear in the Hokage\u2019s office.\u201d She muses thoughtfully, stepping closer to him. Minato tenses, watching her warily, but doesn\u2019t move away as she leans in.\n\n\nNaruto Uzumaki\u2019s adorable, whisker-free face stares up at her.\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sakura says softly, her insides twisting painfully. \u201cOh, look at that.\u201d She whispers, reaching up. Minato leans away slightly and Sakura lowers her hand, but doesn\u2019t take her eyes off the tiny form, his familiar blue eyes staring back up at her curiously. \u201cNaruto.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Minato asks sharply, frowning at her. She shrugs idly.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. Also, pleasure to meet you, Minato-sama.\u201d Still, her gaze lingers on Naruto.\n\n\nHe can\u2019t be more than six months old.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a pleasure to meet you, as well. Kushina told me about you. And the Sandaime.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI get the feeling I\u2019m becoming something of a legend.\u201d Sakura notes distractedly. She wants so badly to touch the spot where his little whiskers used to be, but no longer are. \n\n\n\nKurama,\n\n she thinks, considering the tiny form thoughtfully.\n\n\n\u201cYou are.\u201d Minato confirms, his voice somewhat strained. \u201cWhy the interest in my son?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm? Oh, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d Sakura hums lightly. \u201cDo you believe in reincarnation, Minato-sama?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn rein- I\u2026 I suppose, yes.\u201d Minato says slowly, confused.\n\n\n\u201cThe Sage of Six Paths had two sons. Indra and Asura. For hundreds of years, they\u2019ve been reincarnated over and over again. The last time into the forms of Madara and Hashirama.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...The Sandaime says you\u2019re supposedly the Sage\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAdopted. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d Sa\nkura offers distractedly, frowning as Naruto\u2019s eyes become heavy-lidded and he wiggles slightly in Minato\u2019s arms. \u201cMinato-sama. Please\u2026 let me hold him? For just a moment?\u201d\n\n\nSilence fills the room before, very slowly, Minato shifts. Sakura moves to gently take the boy from him, channeling chakra through her arms. Naruto mewls softly in protest at the movement, but then looks up at her with wide eyes, seeming suddenly amazed.\n\n\n\u201cI can sense you now. I couldn\u2019t before.\u201d Minato murmurs in confusion. \u201cThose lines down your skin\u2026 it\u2019s a seal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeal?!\u201d Kushina cries suddenly, sitting bolt upright, and she blinks sleep from her eyes. \u201cWhy do I sense-\u201d She starts, then her gaze lands on Sakura.\n\n\nShe blinks.\n\n\nSakura offers a faint smile, gaze still locked on Naruto\u2019s. She can\u2019t drag it away even if she tries.\n\n\n\u201cShiry\u014d?\u201d Kushina asks breathlessly.\n\n\n\u201cKushina-chan.\u201d Sakura returns, smile widening, and she adjusts her grip on Naruto, shifting him onto one arm. She lifts the other hand, offering him a finger, which he gladly reaches up and snags in his tiny hands. \u201cAh, he takes after his mother. I can already tell he\u2019ll be excellent at taijutsu one day.\u201d Sakura says fondly.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Kushina asks in confusion. \u201cIs Konoha in danger?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that.\u201d Sakura denies, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m here because\u2026 well, actually I have no idea. I just showed up. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure it out soon enough.\u201d She muses, trying to recall any incidents around this time\u2026 \u201cHm.\u201d She wiggles her finger in Naruto\u2019s grip, shifting it just enough to poke him in the nose, and the tiny baby goes cross-eyed before giggling adorably.\n\n\n\nGod,\n\n Sakura thinks, her chest aching viciously. \n\nHe\u2019s so young. So alive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you \n\nhere?\u201d\n\n Minato echoes Kushina\u2019s earlier question, soft and uncertain, but with an undertone of \n\nHokage\n\n to his voice.\n\n\n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Sakura hesitates, biting her lip. \u201cI think it\u2019s because my time is almost up. The Sage is offering me closure.\u201d\n\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s only one task left she can think of.\n\n\nAnd she has no idea what\u2019s meant to happen to her after she\u2019s done.\n\n\n\u201cClosure? And\u2026 Naruto is giving you that?\u201d Minato asks slowly.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d She repeats for the umpteenth time, quiet and distracted as she uses her finger to play with Naruto. \u201cHow is Obito-kun?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Alive. His arm had to be removed, unfortunately, but he\u2019s still a shinobi - and a damn good one. One of our best. He\u2019ll probably be my successor, actually.\u201d Minato says with a frown.\n\n\n\u201cObito-kun the Hokage.\u201d Sakura muses, considering that.\n\n\n\nAnd to think, I almost didn\u2019t save his life.\n\n\n\n\u201cMinato-sama?\u201d She questions, and he grunts softly in response. \u201cCould you summon the Sandaime? I need to speak to you three about something.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Kushina?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Minato says before vanishing in a small flicker of yellow.\n\n\n\u201cWhy the fascination in my son?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMmm. Complicated. You\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShiry\u014d.\u201d Kushina half-growls.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer your questions, Kushina-chan. Not yet. But soon enough.\u201d\n\n\nShe falls silent, reluctant and irritated, but silent nonetheless. \n\n\nMinato returns a few short minutes later, the Sandaime at his side.\n\n\n\u201cShiry\u014d.\u201d Hiruzen greets in some surprise. She finally, and \n\nvery\n\n reluctantly, drags her gaze from Naruto, smiling at the two Hokage. \n\n\n\u201cHello again, Hiruzen-sama. Did you investigate the matter I told you to?\u201d\n\n\nHe blinks, eyes narrowing. \u201cAbout the J\u016bbi?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJ\u016bbi?\u201d Kushina echoes in confusion.\n\n\nMinato silently shifts, and Sakura reluctantly pulls her finger from Naruto\u2019s grip, offering the infant back to his father. Kushina relaxes slightly as he settles back into Minato\u2019s arms. \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow. Aren\u2019t there only nine bij\u016b?\u201d Minato questions, looking at Hiruzen with a frown.\n\n\n\u201cAre there?\u201d Sakura arches a brow.\n\n\n\u201c...I investigated.\u201d Hiruzen says at last. \u201cAnd I believe you.\u201d\n\n\nSakura smiles and bows her head. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all I can ask of you, Hiruzen-sama.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBelieve \n\nwhat?\u201d\n\n Kushina asks sharply, irritation coming back full force.\n\n\nHiruzen pauses for a moment, shifting his weight to one leg before grunting. \u201cSeveral hundred years ago, when the Sage of Six Paths walked the land, there was an evil monstrosity known as the J\u016bbi. It wreaked havoc on the land, until the Sage found a solution. He used his Rinnegan powers to split the J\u016bbi into nine separate entities instead of one massive one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe bij\u016b.\u201d Minato realizes aloud and Hiruzen nods.\n\n\n\u201cAnd it was heavily implied to me that Shiry\u014d here died fighting the J\u016bbi alongside the Sage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd two others.\u201d Sakura corrects, even if that\u2019s not \n\nreally\n\n accurate.\n\n\n\u201cThe Sage\u2019s sons?\u201d Minato questions, and Sakura\u2019s lips quirk slightly.\n\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t wrong.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re not quite right, either. \n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much about you left in recorded history, Shiry\u014d, but Tobirama-sensei kept as thorough notes as possible. His records indicate that you died following the death of a teammate and an ill-advised jutsu from the other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Sakura confirms, folding her arms across her chest and leaning back on one leg. \u201cIndra fell in battle, no matter how much I tried to save him - and Asura used an experimental jutsu to attempt to save my life. In the end, we both failed, and the Sage saved my spirit - but not my life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve implied repeatedly that you\u2019re on limited time.\u201d Hiruzen notes and Sakura confirms with a nod.\n\n\n\u201cHow limited, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Sakura pauses, pressing her lips together tightly. \u201cBut I highly suspect my time is almost up - for good this time.\u201d \n\n\n\u201c...What will happen to you?\u201d Hiruzen asks slowly and Sakura shrugs.\n\n\n\u201cNo idea!\u201d She says brightly, smiling. \u201cBut I hope I can finally move on. It\u2019s been fun, but rather tiring.\u201d She hasn\u2019t slept in five days of teleporting through time and space at the whims of the Sage. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve lost everything and everyone to the J\u016bbi. I have one last task to keep that creature from ever cursing this land again, and then\u2026 well, I hope I can join my friends and family in the afterlife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little grim.\u201d Ku\nshina blanches, frowning at her. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something worth keeping you around?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d Sakura admits freely, shaking her head. \u201cNot even remotely. Sorry. I\u2019ve done my part. I have one last thing to do, and then I\u2019ll be able to say for certain that the J\u016bbi will never return and do to this world again what it did the first time. I\u2019ve already stopped everything else.\u201d\n\n\nStopping Madara from going crazycakes and gaining the Rinnegan had been key to preventing the summoning of the J\u016bbi\u2019s corpse - but there was still \n\none thing\n\n left to deal with.\n\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d Sakura claps her hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve said my piece. I\u2019ve done my part. Hiruzen, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll meet again, unfortunately, but it was lovely knowing you. You\u2019re an excellent person, and a fantastic Hokage.\u201d Aside from the Uchiha thing.\n\n\nHiruzen blinks at her, startled.\n\n\n\u201cMinato,\u201d She turns to him next, smiling warmly. \u201cPleasure to meet you. I imagine I\u2019ll see you one last time before the end. Kushina-chan, brilliant as always, keep up the good work. Oh, and remind the countries that if someone steals a bij\u016b, I\u2019ll come and kill them all. Bye bye!\u201d Sakura waves cheerfully before Kamui drags her away.\n\n\nThe three of them stare at the space she\u2019d just been occupying, blinking.\n\n\nMinato slowly replays the conversation in his head.\n\n\n\u201c...Wait.\u201d He says, suddenly jerking Naruto. He thrusts the boy out and into the air, staring at the startled infant intently, and the boy looks back at him in utter confusion. \n\n\u201cREINCARNATION?!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more I want to do.\u201d Sakura says antsily, pacing in the dimension that is probably risky for them to linger in, now. Obito most likely has the Mangekyo if he\u2019s \u2018one of the best\u2019 shinobi in Konoha, and this is the same dimension that he uses.\n\n\n\u201cYes. But we are limited. I have enough chakra left to carry you one last time, Sakura, and then the rest is up to you.\u201d\n\n\nSakura chews her lip, thinking about Danz\u014d, who might still be evil, and Orochimaru, who definitely is still evil. \n\n\nShe thinks of the Ch\u016bnin Exams and Sasuke and the Curse Seal. She thinks of Naruto fighting Sasuke without the Ky\u016bbi to heal him and keep him alive.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this. Too much is being left to chance and hopes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy sons will persevere. And so must you, my daughter.\u201d The Sage reassures her calmly.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy to say. And I\u2019m not your daughter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou may as well be.\u201d He says and she snorts softly.\n\n\nBut she forces herself to stop pacing and take a deep breath, reminding herself.\n\n\n\nOne last thing, and then I can be free.\n\n\n\nFree to see Kakashi, Sasuke, and Naruto again. Tsunade and Shizune and Neji and Ino. Shikamaru and Hinata and the rest.\n\n\n\n...But\u2026 \n\n\n\nShe looks sharply at the Sage. \u201cWhen I finally die, what will happen to me? Will I go to the Pure World with the others? Or will I be trapped here? Or will they not be the same people in the Pure World as mine?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will ascend.\u201d The Sage reassures. \u201cAs for who they will be, it\u2019s complicated. We have rewritten time - but the Pure World transcends time and space. Their spirits will be there, and one day, when the new timeline\u2019s people pass into the light, the spirits were merge into one being. They will remember both lives.\u201d\n\n\nSakura chews her lip, digesting that, before nodding at the Sage.\n\n\nShe takes a deep breath.\n\n\n\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiles faintly at her. \u201cYes. Let us.\u201d He extends a hand, and Kamui drags her away.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIf she\u2019d thought the world was unrecognizable before, this was like coming to a different world entirely.\n\n\nShe reappears on top of the Hokage tower, and the first thing she notices is the Monument.\n\n\nThe Hokage Monument, which bares the face of Obito Uchiha beside Minato\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cWow. It really happened.\u201d She murmurs, and isn\u2019t \n\nthat\n\n surreal?\n\n\nArchvillain turned Hokage.\n\n\n\u201cBizarre.\u201d \n\n\nAfter a few minutes of consideration, she determines that the Sage had dropped her here for no reason other than to show her the changes they\u2019ve accomplished. \n\n\nHer real goal lies in the distant corners of the Land of Fire, down by the peninsula. \n\n\nWith a soft exhale, Sakura turns on her heel and flickers away, heading out and away from Konoha.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nKurama is, surprisingly, right where she left him last time.\n\n\nGive or take a few dozen miles.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d Kurama asks, opening one eye to peer at her. \n\n\n\u201cThe Sage and I have a task to complete, and I need your help, Kurama.\u201d Sakura explains quietly. \u201cWill you help me stop Kaguya from ever returning?\u201d\n\n\nHe blinks open both eyes, staring at her.\n\n\nAfter a moment, he sniffs her.\n\n\n\u201c...The Sage, you say?\u201d He asks slowly, and she nods. His eyes narrow and he exhales a warm gust against her. \u201cI can still smell him on you. Very well. Tell me. What does he want from me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI need your senses, Kurama. There\u2019s someone very important we need to hunt down.\u201d She says severely.\n\n\nHe eyes her before slowly grunting. \u201cClimb onto my back and tell me which way to search.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIn the end, she doesn\u2019t actually know where to start their search, which leads to something that admittedly probably looks both entertaining and terrifying from an outside perspective.\n\n\nShe galivants across the world atop Kurama\u2019s head.\n\n\nThe Land of Fire comes first, of course, and then the Land of Wind - then Rock, and it\u2019s on the way to Lightning that he senses it.\n\n\nA low growl escapes Kurama and he pounces, Sakura propelling off his head and landing right in front of a startled Black Zetsu.\n\n\nThey battle for days.\n\n\nKurama\u2019s power is incredible and \n\nridiculously\n\n destructive, but they\u2019re in an isolated part of the Land of Frost, and the damage is only to Black Zetsu and the earth itself. Sakura, as well, is hellbent on destroying as much as she can in an attempt to mow down the damned Kaguya remnant.\n\n\nIt\u2019s only thanks to a few barrier seals she\u2019d pilfered from Minato and Kushina when they weren\u2019t looking that they\u2019re able to keep Black Zetsu from escaping them all together.\n\n\nIn the end, after four days, they aren\u2019t even the ones to seal the deal.\n\n\nThe barrier vanishes without warning, but before Black Zetsu can move, gold chains whip out and slam into the ground surrounding them. A blue barrier fills the sky, and Kushina comes flying out with all the fury of a true Uzumaki. \n\n\nAt her heels is Minato, Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, and\u2026 herself. \n\n\n\nHuh.\n\n\n\nKakashi and Minato join Kushina in her battle charge, but Team Seven slides to a stop not far from Sakura. \u201cYo.\u201d Sakura greets her younger twin idly. \u201cWelcome to the fight. You\u2019re four days late.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBlame the Sage.\u201d Naruto complains. \n\n\n\u201cNARUTO! GET OVER HERE!\u201d Kushina bellows, and Naruto winces before lunging forward, Sasuke a step behind.\n\n\nMini Sakura hesitates, staring at her with wide eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the Strength of a Hundred.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Sakura blinks in genuine surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re a medic nin?\u201d She asks, because she hadn\u2019t honestly thought Tsunade would return to Konoha without the Hokage position needing to be filled.\n\n\n\u201cTsunade-shishou trained me.\u201d Mini Sakura confirms and Sakura smiles warmly at her.\n\n\n\u201cThen crack open that seal and let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHer chakra is almost depleted when the battle ends.\n\n\nThe tide turns drastically with the additional forces, and between Minato and Kushina\u2019s seals draining Black Zetsu\u2019s strength, it\u2019s a matter of \n\ncatching\n\n him and having Naruto and Sasuke plant their palms on him.\n\n\nIt takes nearly eight hours - but they do it.\n\n\nSakura slumps to the ground as the earth itself uproots, surrounding a wailing Black Zetsu and sending him floating up into the sky.\n\n\n\u201cGo team.\u201d Sakura proclaims, fist-bumping Kurama.\n\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Minato proclaims, glaring at her and pointing accusingly at the floating orb of earth, \u201cneed to explain that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, that was\u2026\u201d She pauses, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Sakura settles for.\n\n\n\u201cYou keep saying that, yet it explains nothing.\u201d Kushina bites out, stepping up alongside her husband. Naruto looks between the three of them, a little conflicted.\n\n\n\u201cUm. Didn\u2019t she just sort of save our lives?\u201d Naruto questions.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Sakura asks incredulously. Naruto silently presents his palm, the Sage\u2019s power seal on it. She gives it an irritated look. \u201cSo he spilled the beans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe told us about the J\u016bbi and some crazy chick named Kaguya.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, that thing was a piece of Kaguya and the J\u016bbi. One and the same. The J\u016bbi is Kaguya, Kaguya is the J\u016bbi, etc.\u201d Sakura explains, flapping a hand dismissively. \u201cBy killing off that piece of her, we made it so she can\u2019t reform.\u201d \n\n\nOr, at least, not with any help. A \n\nlot \n\nof help.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Kurama says dryly from where he\u2019s currently laying down, apparently content to go back to napping right then and there.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Kurama, by the way.\u201d Sakura adds, jabbing a thumb over her shoulder at the bij\u016b. \u201cHe helped me hunt Black Zetsu down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBlack Zetsu? That\u2019s what that thing was?\u201d Kushina asks, nose wrinkling. \n\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d Sakura grins wickedly. \u201cAnd now, you never will.\u201d She looks sideways at Team Seven, who appear to be seventeen or eighteen, and offers them a nod of appreciation.\n\n\nSasuke, to her surprise, is the one who returns it with a determined set of his jaw.\n\n\nNaruto looks mildly confused. \n\n\nMini Sakura just frowns at her.\n\n\n\u201cYou fight just like me. You use all the same powers as me.\u201d Mini Sakura accuses.\n\n\n\u201cDo I? What a coincidence.\u201d Sakura deflects with a smile. \n\n\nBut Minato, the genius that he is, goes stiff.\n\n\nHis eyes widen, and he glances between the two Sakura\u2019s before looking at his sons, lips parting in shock. \u201cIndra and Asura.\u201d He breathes out, and Sakura\u2019s smile widens. \u201cYou misled us.\u201d Minato realizes and Sakura gives a shrug. She\u2019s just lucky her hair is red with blood or it\u2019d be \n\nreally\n\n obvious.\n\n\n\u201cYes, well, who needs to know the truth? It\u2019ll just give them dangerous ideas. And look how badly it backfired to begin with.\u201d Sakura points out, and understanding further dawns on his expression, while the others just look confused. Or searching, in Sasuke and Kakashi\u2019s case.\n\n\nShe sees when the realization hits Kakashi next, but she\u2019s fairly confident her point has been made, for neither he nor Minato so much as breathe a word about \n\ntime travel.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so worried, Minato-sama.\u201d Sakura says mildly, her smile warming. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of everything. Just like I was meant to.\u201d She almost, \n\nalmost\n\n glances at Naruto - but he\u2019s not her Naruto, no matter how similar they look.\n\n\nHe isn\u2019t worn down \nby war, desperate from loss after loss. \n\n\nHe\u2019s young, innocent, and full of life.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the way it should be.\n\n\nSakura\u2019s skin tingles and she shifts slightly, making everyone tense, which she almost rolls her eyes at. \u201cMy time here is up, ladies and gentlemen. Do me a favor and take care of the world I\u2019m leaving you with.\u201d\n\n\nTo her surprise, it isn\u2019t Kamui that touches her skin, drawing her away.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a beam of light, warm and tingling, that makes her muscles relax involuntarily. She looks up at the sky, blinking at the bright light hitting her.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done well, my children.\u201d\n\n The Sage\u2019s voice echoes around them, and Kurama\u2019s ears perk in response. \n\n\u201cAll of you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHagoromo.\u201d Kurama murmurs reverently.\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Kushina-chan, Minato-sama. And good luck.\u201d Sakura says, smiling warmly at them.\n\n\nHer skin tingles, and after a moment, she realizes that it\u2019s flaking away - not like from Kaguya\u2019s bone strikes, but like she\u2019s an Edo Tensei being returned to the Pure World.\n\n\nShe looks at her hands, watching it happen for a moment, before looking back up at the Namikaze and Uzumaki woman. \u201cOh, and keep people\u2019s grubby fingers away from my bij\u016b.\u201d She says sternly.\n\n\nKushina cracks a small grin.\n\n\n\u201cBelieve it!\u201d Naruto cries out, and Sakura \n\nlaughs.\n\n\n\nThe sound echoes in the valley their battle had created.\n\n\nShe\u2019s gone moments later.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSakura opens her eyes to find Naruto leaning over her, tears in his eyes. \u201cYou did it.\u201d He breathes out, seizing her and hugging her tight. \u201cThank you, Sakura. Thank you.\u201d He whispers, clinging tightly.\n\n\nShe hugs him tightly back, half desperate for the reassurance that she \n\nfinally made it,\n\n and half wanting to punch him for stranding her through time like he had.\n\n\n\u201cGood job, Sakura.\u201d Sasuke\u2019s voice says mildly, and she lifts her head to see him standing a few feet away.\n\n\nThey\u2019re on a grassy hill, the sun shining high and warm above their heads, and Kakashi is lounging against a tree a few feet away, watching them warmly.\n\n\nSakura\u2019s eyes burn.\n\n\n\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d She chokes out.\n\n\nNot many people can claim they squeezed a hundred years into \n\ntwo weeks.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been the longest two weeks of her life.\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019re home now, Sakura-chan.\u201d Naruto smiles widely at her. \u201cAnd no one\u2019s taking any of us away. Now come on - I want you to meet my parents. They have some things to say to you.\u201d\n\n\nSakura lets him haul her to her feet, smiling all the way, and as Naruto half-drags and half-guides her away, Kakashi and Sasuke silently fall into step behind them.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been the longest two weeks of her life.\n\n\nBut it was worth every second.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, Naruto stares up at the sky with a constipated expression.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Dad?\u201d He asks tightly.\n\n\n\u201cHuh? What?\u201d Minato questions, still looking at the spot where the ghost woman had just been.\n\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d Naruto points upwards, and slowly, they all look straight up at the sky. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to explain \n\ntwo moons?\u201d\n\n"
