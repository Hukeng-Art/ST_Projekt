    "text": "\nIs this really my face?\n\n\nWell, of course it is, but\u2026\n\n\nIs there a filter on this camera?\n\n\nNope.\n\n\nWell\u2026 damn.\n\n\nI turned out good.\n\nJungkook stared into the screen of Seokjin\u2019s phone, one hand gripping the device tightly, the other smoothing across high cheekbones, tall nose, pale pink lips and then across to his sharp jawline. Though still boyish, his childish face had gone; there were no more chubby curves and stubborn baby fat \u2013 his face was all sharp lines and angles. There were some inconspicuous, fading, dull red pigments smattered across his lower cheek, evidence of his teenage, hormonal acne, but besides that his complexion was flawless. His gaze flickered up to his eyes, perhaps his only feature that looked virtually unchanged, doe-eyes with dark lashes, and yet the youthful innocence that used to shine in them was gone, and instead burned something a bit more cunning.\n\u201cHow old am I, again?\u201d Jungkook asked, his voice deeper, a maturity in his tone, handing the phone back to his friend and doctor.\n\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d Seokjin answered with a smile, telling him to just place it on the bed because he already had a clipboard in one hand, pen in the other.\nJungkook blinked up at his friend \u2013 he was so glad they were still friends \u2013 and noted the fine lines around his mouth. Seokjin still looked great though, definitely didn\u2019t look twenty-seven, but Jungkook being Jungkook couldn\u2019t let this opportunity pass. \u201cWow, hyung, you got old.\u201d\nSeokjin rolled his eyes with a scoff. \u201cOh right, you already were such a brat at seventeen. I wouldn\u2019t be making jabs at the person who\u2019s going to be treating you.\u201d As if to prove his point, he scribbled something down on the paper.\nJungkook laughed, wincing when he felt a sharp sting across his ribs. He breathed in sharply and scrunched his face up in pain.\n\u201cSorry, the painkillers will kick in soon,\u201d Seokjin said, noticing his discomfit; he was a doctor after all.\n\u201cAre you still with Namjoon-hyung?\u201d Jungkook asked to distract himself, glancing away from an ugly scratch up his arm.\nAt that, Seokjin\u2019s hand clenched and Jungkook swore he saw a flicker of hurt. \u201cNo.\u201d\nJungkook felt a pang of sympathy, and a whole lot of disbelief. They were always so happy together, everyone was so sure they were soulmates\u2026 but it had apparently been five years, and a lot could happen in that amount of time. \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d He felt like an asshole for asking, especially since he should have known not to \u2013 or shouldn\u2019t have had to.\nSeokjin sighed and sat down, hands clasped together. \u201cSo you really don\u2019t remember anything since seventeen?\u201d\nJungkook swallowed and tried to reminisce on something, but he really had no idea what he was trying to be thinking of. \u201cUh, no?\u201d\n\u201cYou just think you\u2019re in high school?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, grade eleven. I have a maths exam next week \u2013 or, I mean, I did. God, I wonder if I passed \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d Seokjin cut in but he was holding back a grin, Jungkook could tell. \u201cAnd yes, you passed, by the skin of your teeth.\u201d\n\u201cYou remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou made us throw a party for you, spoilt baby.\u201d\n\u201cAh, of course I did.\u201d\nSeokjin stood up and rubbed his forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really set in for you yet, Kook, but hey, that\u2019s okay,\u201d he said and gave him a reassuring smile, warm and caring, like an older brother or parent, \u201cmost people get their memories back eventually. You may not get all of them, but you\u2019ll at least get some, I\u2019m sure. Five years is not too bad. We\u2019re all here to help anyway.\u201d\nJungkook swallowed and nodded sheepishly, a bit embarrassed for acting so casual about the serious matter. He brought a hand up to his head and his fingers ghosted over the bandage, not daring to apply any pressure. He\u2019d woken up confused and drowsy in a hospital bed, wondering how he had got there when he was pretty sure he had fallen asleep over his school notebooks after pulling an all-nighter the day before. He thought maybe he had fainted or something. He had certainly not expected to be told by some kind but annoying nurses that no, he was not seventeen and he had been in a car accident.\nBut I can\u2019t even drive was the first thing that popped into his head, but then they started saying how the other driver \u2013 a drunk \u2013 was also conscious and recovering and that despite the damage to both cars neither had sustained major injuries. Jungkook felt all bitter when they had said that because fucking excuse you, I\u2019ve lost five years of my life, is that not major enough for you?\n\u201cAre we all still friends?\u201d Jungkook asked curiously, a feeling of dread building inside him as he thought about the five other people he had spent his teenage years with, hoping that they still were. He would be crushed if Seokjin told him he had a fight with someone and now they never talked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Seokjin replied with a laugh and Jungkook was instantly relieved. \u201cYou meet up with Taehyung quite often \u2013 he\u2019s a teacher, and Hoseok and his dance crew are touring currently but they\u2019ll be back late next month, Yoongi\u2019s a famous architect and Namjoon\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Seokjin trailed off with a sad curl to his lips.\n\nTheir breakup must have been really terrible, and it looks recent.\n\nJungkook took all the information in in awe. He felt pride swell in his chest for Hoseok because, as much as Jungkook had loved it, Hoseok was someone born to dance. He wasn\u2019t surprised in the slightest that Taehyung became a teacher after several university degree changes, no doubt he would be the kind, entertaining, handsome teacher that girls fawned over and boys wanted to be like with his unique sense of humour and sharp wit. Yoongi\u2019s occupation was unexpected but then again, he always had amazing ideas and could do anything if he put the time and effort in. And yes, of course, Namjoon in the justice system was so fitting.\n\u201cWhat am I?\u201d Jungkook asked, curious. He wondered if he had gotten successful too.\n\u201cYou own a lamb skewer store.\u201d\nJungkook couldn\u2019t help the grin that broke out on his face. \u201cReally? Holy shit, I can\u2019t believe it. I actually did it!\u201d\nSeokjin suddenly made a face and then his classic window cleaning laugh bellowed out into the room, high pitched at surprisingly equal intervals. \u201cAh, I can\u2019t believe you fell for it!\u201d\nJungkook felt his happiness deflate. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t own a lamb skewer store?\u201d\n\u201cI wish you did. Unfortunately, no,\u201d Seokjin wiped his eyes and stood up, straightening his jacket. \u201cYou\u2019re a lawyer too.\u201d\n\u201cA lawyer.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cStop joking.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you\u2019re not a lawyer yet but you\u2019ve just graduated from university with your law degree,\u201d Seokjin elaborated and then a flash of worry, coupled with a bit of amusement, crossed his features. \u201cOoh, I can\u2019t even begin to wonder how bad it would have been if you had clients already \u2013 a lawyer losing his memory, that cannot be good. And wow, you\u2019ve forgotten all your university years too, but I\u2019m sure the law stuff will come back naturally.\u201d\nJungkook\u2019s mind was spinning. What on earth would have possessed him to want to take up law? And what if his memories didn\u2019t come back and he had to go back to university? That would be torture \u2013 not that he could remember what it had been like but he was sure it must have been torture. He squeezed his eyes shut and took a few deep breaths. \u201cOkay. Okay, so\u2026 so, what now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m giving you some antibiotics and painkillers,\u201d Seokjin stood up and began writing on something again in his illegible doctor\u2019s scrawl. \u201cBut I think the best thing is to try settle back into your life and hopefully your memories will come back eventually. Just be patient. Oh, and you will have to talk to the authorities about pressing charges. You would have been more than capable of handling this if you hadn\u2019t forgotten your legal study. I\u2019ll call, uh, Namjoon and let him know \u2013 he\u2019ll make sure it all works out,\u201d Seokjin made a pained expression and Jungkook hated seeing his hyung like that.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I-I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Jungkook tried but Seokjin waved off his offer.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019re still friends, somewhat. Anyway, Jimin\u2019s coming to pick you up in five minutes so cheer up.\u201d Seokjin said as he glanced at his watch.\n\nJimin?\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Jungkook asked as a flash of a muscular nineteen year old boy in muscle tees and basketball shorts entered his mind. Not that Jimin\u2026 right?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember Jimin? Park Jimin?\u201d Seokjin frowned with pure shock and he counted something on his fingers. \u201cYou knew him at seventeen!\u201d he said in a tone almost accusatory.\nJungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cYes, yes, I remember. But why is he coming to pick me up?\u201d\nHe grimaced at the thought of the older. It wasn\u2019t that Jungkook didn\u2019t like Jimin, it was just that he was a bit annoying \u2013 he was always so touchy and clingy and always doing that annoying flirty smile and making his liking for Jungkook embarrassingly obvious, and shamelessly unaffected by it. Jimin was fun when he toned it back, when they chatted about Big Bang and did singing covers together or mucked around until two in the morning playing hide and seek with Taehyung, but other times Jungkook just didn\u2019t know how to act around him \u2013 torn between being nice because he was the younger of the two, or scoffing and asking Jimin to leave him alone.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Seokjin repeated and then he made a sound of realisation. \u201cAh. Right. Well\u2026 Jungkook, don\u2019t freak out, but\u2026 Jimin is your boyfriend.\u201d\nOkay, Seokjin and Namjoon broken up he could accept.\nAnd him studying law he could deal with.\nBut him dating Park Jimin? No fucking way. That, he could not swallow.\nJungkook sat up fast and then regretted it when his muscles screamed in protest and he almost started coughing from the way his ribs seemed to collapse into his body. \u201cW-What? Boyfriend? What?\u201d\n\u201cI said don\u2019t freak out!\u201d\n\u201cWhat! What?\u201d\n\u201cJust \u2013 relax for goodness sake, lie back down,\u201d Seokjin berated as he checked the tubes going into Jungkook\u2019s arm. He practically shoved the stubborn younger down back onto the pillows. For a doctor, he was unnecessarily rough. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dating for almost three years.\u201d\n\nThree years? With Park Jimin? \n\nJungkook\u2019s heart rate picked up and he was very close to thinking this was all some sort of weird dream and any second he was going to wake up because he always woke up when he was about to die in his dreams and dating Park Jimin was maybe the equivalent of that. Any second now he was going to wake up in his room, in his very seventeen year old body, and realise he needed to pass this damn maths test.\nWhen all that happened was Seokjin staring at him waiting for his response, he realised with dismay that this was very much reality.\n\u201cDid I lose some kind of bet?\u201d Jungkook whispered, horrified.\nSeokjin\u2019s expression twisted. \u201cDo not say that, and especially not to him. You love him, Jungkook, you\u2019re bloody whipped for him.\u201d\nJungkook blanched at the words. He never thought he\u2019d ever hear anyone say that. \u201cR-Really? Is this really the same Park Jimin? Did something happen? I mean \u2013 what \u2013 but I can\u2019t stand him \u2013 what\u2026\u201d\n\u201cLook, just, I explained to Jimin what happened. He\u2019s not going to make you kiss him or anything, just be nice to him or present day Jungkook, or future Jungkook for you, will come back and kick your fucking ass into the next century,\u201d Seokjin said with a huff but the warning was there \u2013 and obviously Jungkook couldn\u2019t exactly beat himself up but it was pretty clear he was going to regret it deeply.\nJungkook nodded like a child being scolded (and well, he was still a child, mentally). \u201cI\u2026 okay.\u201d\n\u201cBe nice. You love him.\u201d Seokjin stressed.\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making sure it gets through your thick head, because seventeen year old Jungkook was never that nice to Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! He was annoying.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that, geez,\u201d Seokjin sighed and he looked sincerely worried for Jungkook\u2019s sake. \u201cI\u2019m serious, if you fuck it up you\u2019re in for a world of pain when your memories come back.\u201d\nNow Jungkook didn\u2019t think this was exactly fair.\nHe didn\u2019t remember any particularly fond thoughts or have any romantic feelings for Jimin at all, but if Seokjin said so then he must. He pressed his lips together and crossed his arms (then remembered he couldn\u2019t because of the tubes) and rubbed his eyes instead. He wondered what Jimin would look like now, probably even more muscular than before, and maybe louder and more confident and a flirt. Did Jungkook really fall for a guy like that? And if so, what did that say about him, then?\nSeokjin nudged at a few items on the table beside the bed. \u201cThis is your phone and wallet \u2013 they\u2019re both pretty beat up, sorry. I think it\u2019s safe to say your phone is beyond repair,\u201d he held up an object with a shattered screen and a side completely crushed, \u201cbut your credit cards actually survived. Good thing you never carried around cash.\u201d\n\u201cLucky,\u201d Jungkook muttered flatly as he stared at the probably once beautiful device. This was the worst day of his life. His phone from the future (so to speak) was broken. Great. He picked up his wallet with weak hands and clutched it in his less scratched up one.\nSeokjin\u2019s phone beeped and he took a deep breath after glancing swiftly at the screen. \u201cJimin\u2019s here. I\u2019ll explain your injuries and medication to him. As for you \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cBe nice, I got it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that too, but also no sports, no exercising, no seeing if you can jump over the couch or blind-folded hide and seek bullshit \u2013 yes, you still act like that. Your ribs are bruised and you probably have a concussion. And if you hit your head again, God help me,\u201d Seokjin groaned as he headed for the door of the small, patient room they were in. He poked his head out, probably in case Jimin got lost or wandered into the wrong room.\nJungkook bit on his lip and then winced when he realised there was a painful cut right in the centre. He groaned in pain and misery for his situation. At least he would be out of this room soon. Jungkook loved the smell of soap but that sickly hospital stench of harsh chemicals and detergents was even a bit much for him. He glanced outside and wondered how much the world had changed \u2013 probably a lot, and yet, not enough.\nHis head slowly shifted to the side as he heard Seokjin greet someone friendlily.\n\u201cHi, hyung.\u201d A soft voice reached his ears and he couldn\u2019t see the speaker yet but he knew that was Jimin. His voice was exactly as he thought it would be \u2013 slightly pitched, gentle, sweet. He may find Jimin annoying but even he couldn\u2019t deny he had the most soothing voice out of his group of friends, when he wasn\u2019t whining or trying to get attention, that is.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Seokjin said quickly and shot Jungkook another warning look.\n\nYes, be nice, I\u2019m seventeen or twenty-two, not three.\n\nJungkook sort of expected to see that stocky boy walk in, maybe in loose shorts and a singlet with a backwards cap, but instead someone gracefully slim with an elegant aura walked in.\nJungkook felt something in his chest ache and he was quite certain it wasn\u2019t an injury.\nJimin \u2013 was this really Jimin? \u2013 was staring at the ground but his hair was a light, ashy blonde and his skin fairer than he remembered. He was wearing a soft looking sweater that was a few inches too long at the sleeves and fitted jeans that accentuated his trim legs. He had some shopping bag in one hand and was gripping it with white knuckles.\n\u201cJimin?\u201d Jungkook asked doubtfully.\nJimin finally lifted his head and their eyes met and Jungkook sort of expected to feel some sort of connection, but he didn\u2019t. Regardless, Jimin was shockingly gorgeous. His eyes were warm and kind, and his lips full. His face was slimmer too, but there was some slight chubbiness lingering on the top of his cheeks but they actually made him look\u2026 cute.\n\nHe had just called Park Jimin cute.\n\n\nHe must have hit his head hard.\n\n\u201cJungkookie.\u201d Jimin whispered and looked like he was going to rush forward and throw himself in his arms but then hesitated. He swallowed and turned to Seokjin for help.\n\u201cHere, sit down.\u201d Seokjin took control and lead Jimin to the chair. Jungkook noticed the way Jimin was wringing his hands with worry.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jimin asked, eyes filled with overflowing concern.\n\u201cUh, yes.\u201d Jungkook replied awkwardly. This was so strange. This guy was his boyfriend.\nJimin\u2019s gaze rested on his face for a few seconds before darting to his hands and Jungkook didn\u2019t miss the way his shoulders slumped, following the long, red, angry scratch. \u201cAre you still hurting?\u201d\n\u201cMy ribs hurt, but, yeah it\u2019s all good,\u201d Jungkook answered hastily. It was by no means \u2018all good.\u2019 He was going to give this drunk driver a piece of his mind when he saw him. Like it wasn\u2019t even evening, or the afternoon \u2013 it was freaking morning \u2013 who got drunk so early in the day? He noticed Seokjin glaring at him and then jerk his chin towards Jimin. Right. \u201cSorry, for\u2026 uh\u2026 I really don\u2019t remember us t-together\u2026 at all.\u201d\nJimin shrugged half-heartedly, evident sadness desperately trying to be hidden. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\nWell, no. It really isn\u2019t.\n\nJungkook didn\u2019t know what to say in response so he just nodded and looked at something else. He heard Seokjin begin to explain Jungkook\u2019s injuries and medication and Jimin listened attentively, eyes wide and teeth sinking into his bottom lip.\nJungkook didn\u2019t remember Jimin like this at all. Jimin was confident and overbearing \u2013 this Jimin was quiet and shy.\n\nThen again, you did lose your memory and he\u2019s probably worried sick about you.\n\nHe sighed as he drifted out of the conversation, hoping desperately that some part of his memory would hurry up and come back. He snapped out of it when Jimin stood up, papers and prescription in his hand.\n\u201cOkay, Kook, you can go now,\u201d Seokjin said and moved to the side of the bed to remove the tubes attached to him, then moved to help him off the bed.\nJungkook winced and flinched as he tried to twist his body and swing his legs off the bed, hot pain shooting up his arms, across his back, muscles wanting to give out. What sort of shitty painkillers did Seokjin give him? Was he really a doctor?\n\u201cHyung\u2026\u201d Jimin\u2019s thick voice cut through in an almost plea. He sounded so small and helpless. \u201cMaybe\u2026 maybe he should stay\u2026 he\u2019s in so much pain.\u201d\nSeokjin opened his mouth to reply but Jungkook cut in before he could stop himself.\n\u201cI can do it.\u201d He hissed in a tone harsher than he meant for. He didn\u2019t intend for the hard edge, it was just at that precise moment his wrist ached and the soreness came out in his voice. And maybe he was a little annoyed that Jimin would think he couldn\u2019t do it \u2013 Jimin was always babying him and thinking he couldn\u2019t do things for himself.\nJimin gulped. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cJungkook.\u201d Seokjin whispered under his breath and shot Jungkook an angry look. \u201cHe\u2019s just worried.\u201d\nJungkook gritted his teeth and ignored him. Seokjin helped him get his feet on the ground and take a few shaky steps. The first few were difficult but they progressively got easier. He realised that he must have gotten taller because he had a good few inches on Seokjin who was already quite tall. I wonder if I\u2019m taller than Namjoon as well.\nJungkook glanced at Jimin (who now looked even shorter than before) who was fumbling in the bag he brought. He pulled out some dark coloured clothes. \u201cI brought your jumper and some sweatpants. I figured you wouldn\u2019t want to walk out in that.\u201d\nJungkook looked down at his hospital gown and flushed. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Jimin handed it to him quickly and Seokjin pointed to the bathroom door. Jungkook walked slowly to it, eyes studying the jumper, glad his taste in clothes was still relatively the same.\n\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d Seokjin called after him. \u201cBecause Jimin can help you change.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Jungkook snapped with reddening cheeks, glad his back was to them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t already seen everything \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHyung!\u201d Jimin squeaked, embarrassed.\nJungkook was too, but it caught him by surprise that Jimin was. He was honestly expecting Jimin to have made some dirty joke. He stepped into the tiny bathroom and closed the door with a heavy sigh.\nThis was the worst day of his life.\nAnd then, Jungkook wanted to scream in frustration because he couldn\u2019t even be sure of that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe live together?\u201d Jungkook mumbled as Jimin\u2019s grip on the keys slipped for the second time and he had to bend down and pick them up again. He had been all jittery in the car and had tried to make conversation but it was too awkward between them.\nJungkook and Jimin had hung out together before but they actually never shared that much to each other (or at least, Jungkook didn\u2019t) so he honestly had no idea what to say. The fact that they were boyfriends didn\u2019t help. All he could think of were the games he felt like they played last weekend or that time they smeared ice cream on Yoongi and spent a good hour running away. But they were all five years ago topics. What was he supposed to say now?\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jimin replied and glanced at Jungkook quickly, lowering his gaze as soon as Jungkook looked at him.\n\nIs he always this nervous around me? What kind of relationship is this?\n\n\nI\u2019m not one of those overbearing, commanding, foul boyfriends, am I?\n\n\nHoly fuck I hope not.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to do it?\u201d Jungkook reached for the keys that were shaking in Jimin\u2019s hands. Honestly, it seemed like Jimin was the one who had just been in the accident.\n\u201cN-no.\u201d Jimin shook his head in humiliation, face red, and finally managed to put the key in and unlock the door. \u201cTaehyung lives a few doors down, and Yoongi and Hoseok two storeys up.\u201d\nJungkook glanced around the apartment hall and simply nodded. The complex looked quite new, or at least in very good condition, and it was modern and stylish. At twenty-two, he was lucky to be living somewhere so nice. Even if it was with Park Jimin. His boyfriend, apparently.\nNo, definitely. He was definitely his boyfriend.\nJimin opened the door and gestured for Jungkook to walk in first, perhaps in case he stumbled, and Jungkook couldn\u2019t deny he was shocked by their flat. It had a spacious living room and a decent sized kitchen and interesting artworks and photos were framed on the walls. He was momentarily impressed by the size of the television before glancing to the speakers and then the laptop on the table.\n\u201cOur bedroom is down there.\u201d Jimin pointed towards a door and then walked hastily to the kitchen to put down Jungkook\u2019s medication. Then he turned back to Jungkook, fingers knotting together.\n\u201cWe share a bed?\u201d Jungkook blurted before his common sense had time to kick in. Of course we do, we\u2019re boyfriends of almost 3 years. Then he felt heat prick up his neck when he thought of what they could have possibly done on that bed. We may have even had sex. Oh shit, what if we have? We probably, definitely have. I don\u2019t even remember my first time. Had it been with Jimin?\n\u201cWell, yes, but if you\u2019re not comfortable I can sleep on the couch.\u201d Jimin said with a soft smile. \u201cI know we weren\u2019t really that good of friends when you were seventeen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t stand you.\u201d Jungkook laughed before realising that this was not him being nice. \nJimin was staring at him with hurt all over his face and Jungkook didn\u2019t have to love, or even like, Jimin to feel like a complete shit. He had meant it to be like a light joke, but it obviously wouldn\u2019t be funny under these circumstances. If Jungkook \u2013 present/future Jungkook, that is \u2013 had said it, maybe Jimin would have seen the humour because present/future Jungkook has his memories and apparently was \u2018whipped\u2019 for Jimin. But seventeen year old Jungkook was not, and seventeen year old Jungkook felt this way currently.\nHe spoke in present tense for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry, Jimin, I\u2026\u201d Jungkook stood there awkwardly like the teenager he mentally was. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013 of course I can\u2019t not stand, wait, I don\u2019t can\u2019t stand, I mean, I can stand you \u2013\u201d\nHe really didn\u2019t think he was making anything better.\nJimin laughed, forced and strain. Fake, undeniably fake. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I understand. You should go lie down and get some more rest.\u201d\nJungkook wasn\u2019t really tired, but he figured anything would be better than rambling off again. He gave a tight smile and began his ungraceful walk to the bedroom, a definite limp in his step and a grimace of discomfit every now and then, at least the painkillers seemed to have finally kicked in.\nHe threw a quick glance back at Jimin in case he had been watching him wearily but found him hunched over the kitchen counter instead.\nJungkook felt that ache in his chest again, and wondered if that was present/future Jungkook trying to tell him something.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you so nervous around me?\u201d Jungkook asked as Jimin had woken him up to take his antibiotics and replace his bandages. He even brought him some food to fill his stomach. Jungkook couldn\u2019t deny that it was sort of nice to have someone pampering him. Hopefully, I pamper Jimin back too, right? Present/future Jungkook is a decent boyfriend, right?\n\u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d Jimin replied as he finished replacing the bandage around his head, and then cleaned the wound on his back (Jungkook hadn\u2019t even realised there was an injury on his back) and applied some cream to the scratches littered all over Jungkook\u2019s body, as well as the awful bruises practically covering up his torso, across his biceps and on his shoulders. They ranged from dark red and blue to black and yellow and Jungkook saw the way Jimin visibly paled when he saw them.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Jungkook murmured as Jimin\u2019s hand ghosted over them, eyes blinking rapidly. He wondered if maybe Jimin was all jumpy because he felt so bad for him, or thought that Jungkook was all fragile and would crumble into pieces if he spoke too loud or looked at him too long.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Jimin said as he squeezed some more cream onto his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026\u201d He breathed in sharply and simply turned his attention to the deep and wide graze on Jungkook\u2019s knee.\nJungkook was sitting shirtless on the edge of their bathtub, just in his boxers, as Jimin fussed over him. He wanted to say something to make it better, but he really wasn\u2019t good at comforting people. He wished he was, he hated seeing his friends upset, even Jimin.\n\u201cSorry for making you worry like this.\u201d Jungkook said finally.\nJimin did that shrug again, a weak, feeble movement.\n\u201cIt must have been scary to hear I got in an accident.\u201d Jungkook mumbled and then thought maybe that was a terribly timed thing to say.\n\u201cYeah, Seokjin called me.\u201d Jimin breathed and stopped, eyes scanning the cuts up Jungkook\u2019s leg, the purple, inflamed bruise across his shin, \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought I lost you for a second.\u201d Jimin sighed and said quieter, \u201cI guess I sort of did.\u201d\nJungkook stiffened and felt his body go all cold at his devastated voice, and then the other part was quite offended because it wasn\u2019t like Jungkook asked to lose his memory. This was just as frustrating for him as it must be for Jimin. He frowned and was about to retort something probably not very nice (he\u2019d apologize to Seokjin later) when Jimin looked up at him with watery eyes.\nHe looked like a kicked puppy.\n\u201cCan I give you a hug?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice was barely audible, and if it wasn\u2019t for the echo of the bathroom Jungkook probably wouldn\u2019t have heard it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re here, yet.\u201d He looked down like he was embarrassed for having to ask, and he probably was. Jungkook was his boyfriend and here Jimin was asking if he could give him a hug. Even friends did that.\n\u201cSure you can.\u201d Jungkook answered and Jimin smiled in relief before he leaned forward and lightly wrapped his arms around his shoulders, careful not to apply too much pressure. It was awkward and stiff at first, until suddenly Jimin buried his face in the crook of Jungkook\u2019s neck and let out a shuddery breath, like the kind when you were trying not to cry \u2013 the bad sort of crying too, the hiccups and uneven breathing and swollen eyes.\nJungkook brought his hands up and curled them around Jimin\u2019s waist. He wasn\u2019t as muscular as Jungkook remembered \u2013 Jimin\u2019s shirt was a thin material so it was easy to tell. He was still toned and his stomach flat but he felt like he had put on a bit of weight. He could feel Jimin\u2019s small frame trembling. Jungkook was an awful boyfriend, why didn\u2019t he think about how Jimin would be feeling? That Jimin would need some comfort?\nIt was strange, thinking of Jimin as his significant other. Jungkook didn\u2019t know how he felt about it.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jungkook said again because he honestly didn\u2019t know what else to say.\nJimin just reluctantly pulled away and gave him a smile.\nIt didn\u2019t touch his eyes.\nAnd Jungkook hated how familiar it felt.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook raised another mug of coffee to his lips and almost drank the whole thing in one go. He hated coffee when he was seventeen so he grimaced when Jimin automatically handed him one in the morning. \u201cTrust me,\u201d was what Jimin had said with a small laugh and Jungkook took one sip before he realised this was the most amazing thing ever. Now he knew why everyone was so obsessed with it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sort of a coffee addict.\u201d Jimin giggled as Jungkook walked to the coffee machine to make himself another.\n\u201cWow, that stuff is good.\u201d Jungkook licked his lips.\nJimin laughed, eyes turning into those crescents and dimples forming on his cheeks and Jungkook was momentarily stunned because Jimin has always had a pretty smile, Jungkook had seen some of the most composed people stumble over their words when Jimin smiled like that, but five years and it was still the same.\n\u201cSo how did we\u2026uh\u2026 get together?\u201d Jungkook began as Jimin was stacking his dirty dishes in the dishwasher. He had been up thinking about it for a good hour or so after Jimin had changed all his bandages and made sure he was feeling okay. He was hoping for something to come back, anything, but all he could think about was that really mean history teacher he had and winning at the school athletic carnival and how his parents kept bugging him to vacuum his room. Seventeen year old problems. He felt nothing romantic for Jimin when he woke up.\nJimin scratched his elbow and smiled faintly. \u201cYou asked me out.\u201d\n\u201cI did?\u201d\n\nOh smooth Jeon, fucking smooth.\n\nJimin\u2019s smile faltered and he turned back to the sink. \u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat age was I?\u201d Because Jungkook sure didn\u2019t think he was going to have done it soon.\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve been together almost three years, can\u2019t you do the math?\u201d Jimin chuckled and there was a mocking tone to his voice.\nJungkook felt annoyance rise up. It irked him so much when Jimin made fun of him. Okay, so he wasn\u2019t the smartest kid and Jimin had been the top student in the arts and in academics at his high school. Sometimes Jungkook felt like he was competing with Jimin all the time, and that he always had to show off how good he was at everything. \u201cWell, geez, I just can\u2019t believe it ever happened. You and me..\u201d\n\nFuck. Seventeen year old Jungkook has no filter.\n\nJimin looked at him in shock, the insult like a slap to the face. \u201cI was just teasing.\u201d Jimin defended, voice going quiet, and then cringed like he was scolding himself for having thought Jungkook would react differently. \u201cYou had just turned nineteen.\u201d\n\nI bet present/future Jungkook wants to kill me right now.\n\n\u201cAh, okay,\u201d Jungkook mumbled, embarrassed. He finished making his coffee and went back to the chairs at the kitchen counter. \u201cWere you surprised when I asked you?\u201d\nJimin brushed his hair back from his eyes before he washed his hands, gaze trained on the soapy suds running under the water. It was clear he didn\u2019t want to talk about this, not with teenage Jungkook, at least. \u201cMm.\u201d\nWhat did that mean? Jungkook kicked his foot into the counter with a light scowl. This sucks. This whole losing-your-memories only happened in those dramas, not in real life. And why him? Jungkook brought the warm drink to his lips and took a large sip.\n\u201cI have to go to work.\u201d Jimin started and his concern was back in his eyes. Jimin had sincere eyes \u2013 he could never lie to you with eyes like that, Jungkook had noticed. \u201cBut, my number is on the fridge so call me if you need anything. Namjoon is coming in an hour to talk to you about the charges and all. I dealt with the repairs for your car already.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Jungkook rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to press charges?\u201d Jimin asked curiously and Jungkook couldn\u2019t read his tone and it bothered him because he felt like he should.\n\u201cWell, I suppose he\u2019s already going to get charged with DUI,\u201d Jungkook started and tilted his head back to think. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Namjoon and whoever my attorney is. With the medical fees and the car repairs and all, probably.\u201d And my freaking memory, let\u2019s not forget that.\nJimin nodded before softly adding, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid. Only eighteen.\u201d\nJungkook raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jimin sighed, \u201cI just\u2026 go easy.\u201d\nJungkook just took another sip of coffee. A bitter feeling had formed inside of him, because why did Jimin have to be goddamn nice to everyone? The guy was drinking irresponsibly and driving recklessly, and maybe Jungkook didn\u2019t even remember the accident but whose fault was that again?\nJimin glanced at the clock on the wall and quickly pocketed his phone before coming up to Jungkook like he was going to do something, and then stepped away with a guilty expression.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook asked, suspicious.\n\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just, I usually kiss you goodbye.\u201d Jimin mumbled, cheeks flooding with pink. \u201cYou just look so normal right now. Like my Jungkook.\u201d\nJungkook felt like an intruder when Jimin said \u2018my Jungkook\u2019 in probably the most fond, affectionate tone he\u2019d ever heard him use; it was like seventeen year old him was not welcome.\u00a0 We\u2019re the same person, he wanted to say but his jaw was locked into place. And why was he getting so riled up about it? But he didn\u2019t want to kiss Jimin, no way. He couldn\u2019t even think about doing it.\n\u201cLook, I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be comfortable with that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was just habit.\u201d Jimin said with a small laugh, face red, and settled for a hesitant wave before beginning for the door.\nJungkook gripped the mug harder, feeling bad and responsible for Jimin\u2019s sad turn in mood. \u201cI really don\u2019t want it to be so weird between us, but it\u2019s just for me we\u2019re \u2013\u201d Just friends, is what he was going to say.\n\u201cYou hate me.\u201d Jimin interrupted and irritation was laced in his voice, not held back anymore. He pressed his lips together tiredly. \u201cI have those memories too, you know.\u201d\nJungkook internally winced. That hurt.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d Jungkook protested but he thought of that time last month (which was really last month five years ago) when he had yelled at Jimin to stop boasting and showing off, or scoffed at him for topping the performing arts and didn\u2019t even say congratulations or just the other day when he pushed Jimin away because he was too close again.\nJimin ran a hand through his hair and Jungkook suddenly thought he should gather Jimin up in his arms and say something, but the feeling was fleeting and gone before he could grasp it. \u201cI have to go to work.\" Jimin just said again and turned and walked away.\nJungkook stared into the empty space with a sigh. He didn\u2019t even know what Jimin did as a career \u2013 Seokjin hadn\u2019t told him. It probably just hadn\u2019t crossed Seokjin\u2019s mind that Jungkook would forget what Jimin did. Were they really such a great couple? Him and Jimin? He never thought he saw the compatibility.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bloody whipped for him.\u201d\n\nIf you say so, hyung.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook remembered something when he was waiting for Namjoon to arrive, a pen twirling around his thumb. He suddenly had memories of sitting in lectures and tutorials and typing furiously on his laptop. He remembered faces of the students in the graduating class with him and holy shit I graduated second in my cohort.\nHe was sitting stunned on the couch when Namjoon knocked on the door.\nJungkook answered it, still half dazed.\nKim Namjoon had always been a mentor for him, as well as a friend, and that was one of the reasons Jungkook went into law.\n\u201cHey kid,\u201d Namjoon grinned when he saw him and pulled him into a hug, \u201cI heard what happened to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 uh, yeah.\u201d Jungkook finished dumbly and opened the door wider to let Namjoon in. \u201cAre you handling my case?\u2019\n\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Namjoon said like it was obvious.\nAt least Jungkook knew it would all be taken care of well because Namjoon was a genius and could argue for anything he wanted. Did I just remember that? Or maybe that\u2019s just obvious information.\nThey both sat down and Jungkook was shown photos of the accident and the state of his poor, poor car and he almost damn near wailed. \u201cMy fucking car,\u201d Jungkook cussed. \u201cAsshole.\u201d\n\u201cGet over it.\u201d Namjoon rolled his eyes but he seemed to sympathise to some extent. \u201cSo, I checked up on the teenager and he\u2019s fine. I think the amount of alcohol in his system was more alarming than his injuries. You got the worst of it.\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d Jungkook swore again and then wondered why Namjoon hadn\u2019t reprimanded him.\nNamjoon noticed his curious glance and then laughed. \u201cYou usually swear a lot, Jungkook. Yoongi rubbed off on you.\u201d\n\u201cOh. It doesn\u2019t bother anyone?\u201d\n\u201cWell, Hoseok and Jimin don\u2019t swear much. Seokjin barely at all.\u201d Namjoon had tried to hide it but Jungkook picked up on the change in his voice when he spoke of his ex-boyfriend. \u201cYou dial it back depending who you\u2019re with.\u201d\nJungkook nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m guessing with you there are no bounds?\u201d\n\u201cJust wait until Yoongi is here.\u201d Namjoon laughed before flipping to a page. \u201cSo, look, this other kid is not your straight-laced student. He barely shows up at school, has gotten suspended a few times for swearing at the teachers or getting into fights, and he\u2019s got previous fines for DUIs and reckless driving. But he\u2019s also had a rough growing up from what I\u2019ve heard, negligent parents, bullied when he was younger, if you sympathise with that. I\u2019ve got enough to get you a pretty nice amount, but it\u2019s your choice how much you want to go for.\u201d\nJungkook scanned through the documents, sucking on his bottom lip. Jimin clearly wanted him to have some mercy and not go overboard with the charges, but Jungkook was the type of person who held grudges, and this one he would not be letting go of anytime soon. Then again, he did feel a bit bad for the boy\u2019s growing up.\nJungkook was about to suggest a relatively reasonable price when the image of Jimin\u2019s face all crumpled and broken when he saw Jungkook\u2019s battered body popped in his head. His eyes had been shining with unshed tears and he looked utterly distraught. And his voice when he said \u2018I thought I lost you for a second\u2019 and the way he rested his head in the crook of Jungkook\u2019s neck, like someone who wanted to break down and sob, seeking the comfort from someone who couldn\u2019t be remembered.\nSomething in Jungkook shifted and he felt his jaw clench and a surge of anger. Maybe seventeen year old Jungkook and present/future Jungkook had agreed on little so far, but this, this they could both settle happily on.\nJungkook didn\u2019t care what this kid had been through. He had sessions with the guidance counsellor, his own private therapy, he must have had opportunities to turn his life around, and driving so over the fucking limit he could have blacked out and killed people \u2013 children had been walking on those streets.\n\u201cAs much as you can possibly get.\u201d Jungkook snapped and his voice was stern and final.\n\u201cYou want to go that far?\u201d Namjoon asked, surprised and maybe a bit disapproving.\n\u201cYes, I want this fucking asshole to think twice before he touches another bottle of alcohol.\u201d Jungkook gritted his teeth.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get it done.\u201d Namjoon said as he packed up the files and rested them on his lap. He then faced Jungkook with a less serious face and one that was more brotherly. \u201cSo, how are you coping?\u201d\n\u201cPeachy.\u201d Jungkook groaned sarcastically as he rested his head back on the couch.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come back.\u201d Namjoon gave him a sympathetic smile and a pat on the shoulder. Jungkook noticed the slight frown lines forming on Namjoon\u2019s face and the darker rings under his eyes. He always got them around an exam or when he was studying for days on end without proper rest.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re overworking yourself, hyung,\u201d Jungkook said softly. That sparkle of youth and innocence had dwindled in Namjoon\u2019s warm eyes, and for a second he seemed like a stranger. Maybe he was assuming too much but Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure if he quite liked the way Namjoon turned out from five years ago. It made him nervous to think of how the others were. I hope Taehyung and Hoseok are still balls of sunshine, I think I\u2019m better off not getting my memories back if they aren\u2019t.\nNamjoon pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cJimin tells me that a lot, sometimes he stops by my practise to give me food or a drink.\u201d\nWell he knew that about Park Jimin hadn\u2019t changed. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get jealous, he\u2019s just looking out for me.\u201d Namjoon chuckled.\n\u201cI\u2019m not jealous.\u201d Jungkook deadpanned, and he really wasn\u2019t. Why would he care if Jimin visited Namjoon now and then? \u201cDo I usually get jealous?\u201d\nNamjoon seemed to have momentarily forgotten about Jungkook\u2019s memory loss and laughed. \u201cNot exactly, you just got all whiny about it until Jimin promised he\u2019d do it for you too once you started working.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Jungkook scrunched up his face because he couldn\u2019t imagine whining over such a thing. And to Jimin, in font of other people\u2026 what has happened to him these past five years\u2026 \u201cSo am I really in love with Jimin?\u201d\n\u201cOf fucking course, Jungkook, you talk our ears off about how adorable he is. I think you could even call it infatuation.\u201d Namjoon teased.\n\u201cAdorable\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I have to go.\u201d Namjoon stood up and brushed off his slacks for non-existent dust. He gave Jungkook an encouraging, supportive smile. \u201cJust give it time. You\u2019ll get it back surely \u2013 Jungkook wouldn\u2019t go down without a fight, definitely wouldn\u2019t leave your precious, perfect Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cGod, stop being so sappy.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m quoting words you\u2019ve said to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Jungkook muttered, all torn for his apparent feelings for Jimin. Could he really love someone that much to get so cheesy? Jungkook didn\u2019t talk about his feelings, and most certainly did not talk about other people like that, and especially not to other people, and in particular not about Jimin.\nNamjoon had a foot out the door when Jungkook mustered the courage to ask, \u201cWhat happened between you and Seokjin hyung?\u201d\nNamjoon didn\u2019t go all rigid like Seokjin had, but his posture changed, became almost pitiful. \u201cI chose work over him.\u201d\nJungkook felt a heavy weight form in his stomach. The answer was so simple, so straight forward and yet it made his body go numb. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I was saving this until you started working too but, I guess I may as well say it now,\u201d Namjoon ruffled Jungkook\u2019s unkempt hair with a regretful smile. \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Taehyung held up a hand, eyes practically dancing with amusement, \u201cyou think you\u2019re seventeen?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m seventeen \u2013 I just can\u2019t remember since then.\u201d Jungkook huffed indignantly as Taehyung threw his head back and laughed. Honestly, why was he finding it so funny? This was serious.\nYoongi had looked very sympathetic but it wasn\u2019t like he could do much to help, and then said in his sardonic tone, \u201cI don\u2019t think your mental age has changed all that much anyway.\u201d\nTaehyung settled back down and slung an arm around Jungkook. \u201cAw, poor baby.\u201d\nThey were sprawled around the coffee table, television playing a corny drama, and eating snacks as they talked. Apparently this was a weekly thing for them and because they all lived in the same apartment complex they took turns on whose place to meet at. Yoongi seemed to be the only one who was actually paying attention and knew what was going on, whilst Jimin was sort of blanked out.\n\u201cSo, what were we like back then?\u201d Taehyung asked curiously, pressing into Jungkook\u2019s side, trying to shove his face against Jungkook\u2019s.\nNope. Taehyung had not changed. \u201cWell, firstly, you haven\u2019t grown up at all, hyung,\u201d Jungkook quipped and Taehyung pouted but he seemed very pleased with the answer. \u201cTo me, we had just gone to the arcade and spent all our money on that shooting game.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit that was the best!\u201d Taehyung cheered and Yoongi hissed at him to quieten down. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do that anymore?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re grown adults.\u201d Yoongi muttered as he took a sip of his beer.\n\u201cAnd, Yoongi hyung grew up too much.\u201d Jungkook chuckled although Yoongi said stuff like that even back in his timeline so it wasn\u2019t actually all that much of a surprise.\nTaehyung threw popcorn at him and earned a cold, death glare back. \u201cAnd do you remember that time we ran away from Jimin and left him there?\u201d\nYes, of course Jungkook remembered that. Jimin had tagged along with them but didn\u2019t really find the games all that interesting \u2013 not that he was good anyway \u2013 so had wandered off to go buy some food, and Taehyung and Jungkook had decided to sneak away. Jimin had sat in the arcade for almost an hour wondering where they were. Jungkook had been so surprised he hadn\u2019t just given up and left.\n\u201cThat was so funny,\u201d Jungkook smirked, flashes of Jimin\u2019s confused, concerned expression as clear as day in his mind. Taehyung clutched his shoulder and began to laugh. Jungkook was about to, but then from the corner of his eye he saw Yoongi rub his hand up Jimin\u2019s back and Jimin shifted closer to his touch.\nJungkook felt something ugly simmer under his skin as he watched the two of them.\n\u201cYou guys made me really worried.\u201d Jimin murmured with a smile, but it wasn\u2019t quite as genuine as he perhaps wanted it to be.\n\u201cAw, Jiminie, you worry too much,\u201d Taehyung cooed and leaned across Jungkook to pinch Jimin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cLike that time Hoseok got the flu and you visited him every day, or when Jungkook pretended to be really angry at you for eating the last lamb skewer and you bought him another whole packet the next day!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t pretending,\u201d Jungkook added but his tone was light and joking. He had been sort of annoyed because he bought it himself and hadn\u2019t intended on sharing, and Jimin had taken it without even asking, but he hadn\u2019t meant to get as angry as he had. He turned to Jimin to see what he would say, maybe laugh it off and comment about Jungkook being mean to his hyung, but he was caught completely off guard when Jimin stood up briskly, eyes avoiding.\n\u201cI need to go to the bathroom,\u201d Jimin mumbled and Jungkook heard the crack in his voice, tight and strained.\nYoongi chewed on the inside of his cheek, shuffling out of Jimin\u2019s way. Taehyung looked clueless, mirroring Jungkook.\n\u201cDid I\u2026 What\u2026 Do we not make fun of each other anymore?\u201d Jungkook managed to say finally, really, really confused. Why was Jimin so sensitive? They were just kidding around.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Yoongi sighed and lowered the volume of the television, turning to stare at them with serious eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re usually hugging him and whenever you tease him you kiss him straight after and Jimin is reassured by that. Jimin thought you disliked him quite a lot for a long time \u2013 that hurts when he liked you as much as he did.\u201d\nJungkook ducked his head. \u201cBut I was just joking.\u201d\n\u201cI know. But you weren\u2019t always.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNamjoon and Seokjin\u2019s break up comes back to him in vivid, burning colour that Jungkook had to sit down and hold his head in his hands to process it all.\nThey fought \u2013 a lot.\nAnd Seokjin on several occasions showed up at their apartment in tears, searching for Jimin\u2019s comfort, which Jungkook came to realise was something all their friends did, something about his voice or smile or kind words made them feel instantly better.\n(\u201cIt\u2019s basically a step in dealing with grief \u2013 go see Park Jimin.\u201d Taehyung had declared one night when he showed up to their apartment door with bottles of alcohol and with every intention to drown away a crappy day at work.\nJungkook had stuttered and stupidly squeaked \u201cI\u2019m still a minor\u201d and Taehyung laughed so hard Jimin had to shove a piece of chocolate in his mouth to shut him up.\n\u201cBaby Kookie,\u201d Taehyung had cooed as he nuzzled up to Jimin who stroked his hair and listened to his incoherent rant which he somehow managed to decipher and comprehend. Jimin was kind-hearted and downright sweet, always searching for the positive and letting Taehyung vent. His tone was firm when it needed to be, but otherwise accepting and calm and gentle.\nJungkook felt like saying something too, have Jimin\u2019s attention on him instead, but when he opened his mouth nothing came out so he lamented in silence.)\nNamjoon was a busy lawyer and Seokjin was a doctor at a public hospital \u2013 they\u2019re time for each other was limited. Clients came first. Work came first. Their love life was put on the backburner and had been for quite some time.\nThey didn\u2019t break up because they stopped loving each other.\nThey just didn\u2019t have time to anymore.\nAlmost like they had forgotten how.\n\n\u201cI think\u2026 it\u2019s over.\u201d Seokjin murmured as Jimin rubbed his back up and down \u2013 this was the night before their break-up. \u201cFor real this time. I think we need some space apart to just rethink everything.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook could now recall the disbelief and disagreement he felt as he listened to Jimin console Seokjin.\n\n\n\u201cI think that might be a good idea, hyung. You haven\u2019t been happy and Namjoon-hyung is really stressed about this too. Maybe you both need a little distance to figure it out,\u201d Jimin pulled Seokjin closer as he cried into his sweater.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll tell him tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here for you.\u201d Jimin reassured him and Seokjin managed a chuckle, eyes sad.\n\n\nJungkook can also remember the argument he had with Jimin once Seokjin had left, voice low and accusatory. \u201cWhy would you say that? Why would you encourage him? You know how much they love each other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cKook, they\u2019re so muddled up with their feelings, they need to clear their head.\u201d Jimin replied as he headed for the bathroom and turning on the taps to fill the bath with water.\n\n\nJungkook had scowled, knowing too well how much Namjoon felt guilty over his crumbling relationship with Seokjin, he can\u2019t begin to imagine how broken his hyung would be tomorrow.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been with each other for five years \u2013 you\u2019re making them throw it all away!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making them do anything!\u201d Jimin hissed back and he looked furious. \u201cWhy are you so angry? I\u2019m just trying to help them.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook knew that, of course he knew that. He clenched his jaw as Jimin pulled off his sweater and walked past him to grab his towel. \n\n\nJimin took a deep breath, calming his voice. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that they keep going around in circles \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never said it was, Jungkook.\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes were narrowed and his face was burning with annoyance. \u201cIt\u2019s not our relationship, why are you being so difficult?\u201d\n\n\nJungkook knew he was going to regret this the second he opened his mouth. \u201cWell, what if it was? Would you just walk away and leave?\u201d\n\nJimin flinched before his gaze hardened. \u201cWe both know if either one of us was going to leave first, it would be you.\u201d Jungkook paled and not even a second later Jimin\u2019s hands flew to his mouth and his eyes widened with guilt and distress. \u201cN-no, no, Jungkook \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean that, I swear \u2013 baby, please\u2026\u201d\nEyes stinging, Jungkook turned around, breathing erratically as Jimin\u2019s words rang over and over in his ears.\n\nIt would be you. \n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair as he left the bathroom, with Jimin chasing after him, apologies spilling from his lips. \n\n\nArms wrapped around him from behind and Jimin\u2019s forehead rested against his back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. You can yell at me, just \u2013 fuck, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook could feel pain spreading through his chest, tears pricking his eyes. He was aware Jimin had insecurities, about himself and about the relationship, but Jungkook had thought he had quashed most of them by now \u2013 especially this one. Jungkook loved Jimin so much he didn\u2019t understand how it possible, or if it was even allowed to love someone to this extent.\n\n\n\u201cI would never leave you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jimin kissed his back and tightened his arms around him. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t, it was low of me to say that. I was just angry and tired, and that\u2019s not an excuse but\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook slowly faced Jimin who raised himself on his toes to press his lips against his, hands cupping his face and bringing him down to meet him, eyes fluttering closed. \n\n\nJimin sighed into the kiss, content, and Jungkook wanted to hear those sounds forever.\n\nSnapping out of his daze, Jungkook ran his hand over his lips as if he could still feel the guilt from that night, feel Jimin\u2019s body in his arms, apologies whispered into his skin. His chest felt tight and his eyes were slightly watery from the memory. He rubbed his neck as his gaze flickered to a framed photo on the shelf of Jimin holding a cat (whose cat Jungkook had no idea) and grinning brightly into the camera.\nThose words echoed in his head, clear and definite, stubborn but warm.\n\nI would never leave you.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nYawning. He was so tired. And he\u2019s late, stupid pet discussion again. Red light. Coffee. Damn, so fucking bright. Sunglasses? Where were the sunglasses? Probably in Jimin\u2019s car, shit. Ah well. Namjoon was probably already at the office overworking himself again. Seokjin. Finally, it\u2019s green. \n\n\nHopefully Jimin doesn\u2019t mind that he forgot to make more coffee before he left.\n\n\nWhat\u2026 is this fucker doing?\n\n\nShit, shit, shit \u2013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook jolted awake, breathing harsh and chest pounding as he propped himself up onto his elbows. His vision slowly cleared but his ears were ringing with the distinctive squeal of tyres skidding across bitumen, car horns honking and that crunch of metal followed by a sharp pain digging right into his ribs.\n\u201cOh fuck.\u201d Jungkook glanced down and realised he was bleeding through a bandage, a wound he knew had been carefully patched up last night. He must have jostled it in his sleep. As he threw the blanket off, he realised he had sweat running down his neck and his hands were clammy. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nHe hastily ran a hand through his hair, mouth dry.\n\nOf course, I remember the accident through a fucking nightmare.\n\n\nThank God, I sued that fucker.\n\nJungkook groaned as he walked to the bathroom, limp not as obvious as it had been yesterday. As he grabbed the first aid kit from under the sink he could hear Jimin in the kitchen and the tell-tale sound of coffee beans being grinded.\n\nCoffee.\n\nHe could almost taste the Americano on his tongue, right before the traffic light colour changed and that dull grey car came tearing through a red light. He could feel the condensation on the cup in his hand, the smooth plastic. He could smell the fuel and something charred and burnt. He could smell blood.\nJungkook felt a wave of nausea and before he could comprehend what was even happening with his body he bent over the side of the toilet \u2013 only just managing to reach it \u2013 and threw up the contents of his stomach.\nHe gagged and squeezed his eyes shut as he heaved, trying to block out that acidic taste and burn in his throat.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, Jungkook, are you okay?\u201d\nCool hands were immediately on his back and rubbing circles comfortingly. When he was sure he had finished, Jimin gently leaned him up against the sink before flushing the toilet. He left the room and returned a few seconds later with a damp washcloth which he used to wipe Jungkook\u2019s mouth, eyebrows drawn in concern and eyes searching.\n\u201cHere, do you want to wash your mouth out?\u201d Jimin went to help him but Jungkook decided this was enough pampering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He brushed off Jimin\u2019s hands and stood up, turning on the tap. He isn\u2019t used to having Jimin hovering around him like this, and he hated how he must seem so puny and vulnerable and he knew this wasn\u2019t the right time to be thinking about his pride but Jimin was probably going to never let this go. He never wanted to look weak in front of Jimin.\nJimin left the bathroom again to go throw the washcloth in the laundry and wash his hands.\nJungkook sighed and grabbed the first aid kit, heading back into the bedroom, feeling a bit pitiful for himself.\n\nThat stupid drunk kid can screw his own life up for all he cares, but don\u2019t go around messing with other people\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Jimin asked as he entered the room, staring at the stained red bandage and the grimace on Jungkook\u2019s face.\nJungkook did not need to owe Jimin anything else, thank you very much. \u201cNo, I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jimin hesitated, still looking fretful over his condition. \u201cAre you feeling sick?\u201d\n\u201cUh, no. I just remembered the accident and it triggered something\u2026.\u201d he trailed off and watched Jimin\u2019s expression change.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nJungkook scoffed before he could stop himself. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\nJimin glanced down but otherwise didn\u2019t react. \u201cYou\u2026 you were knocked unconscious, right? After the impact?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d Jungkook softened his tone as Jimin looked relieved, nodding to himself. Jungkook realised then just how small Jimin appeared \u2013 not really in stature or anything \u2013 just by the way the whole room seemed to swallow him up. He seemed so fragile. Jungkook went to grab his wrist but stopped himself last second. It had felt like a natural impulse, muscle memory perhaps.\n\u201cDo you remember anything else?\u201d Jimin whispered hopefully, waiting for an answer Jungkook couldn\u2019t yet give him.\n\u201cNot much,\u201d Jungkook replied, face betraying his nonchalance, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a bit muddled right now.\u201d\n\nGive me some time, geez.\n\nHe instantly felt guilty after thinking that. Jimin didn\u2019t deserve that.\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Jimin gave him a small, sad smile before swiftly leaving the room, shoulders sagging and disappointment clear on his face.\nJungkook sighed again as he began removing the bandage, Jimin\u2019s downcast expression imprinted behind his eyelids. He wondered how terrible it must have been for Jimin to get a call, hearing his boyfriend of three years had been in a car accident. He was probably on the verge of tears the whole way to the hospital, wanting to throw himself in Jungkook\u2019s arms and then realise he couldn\u2019t. His Jungkook was gone, and in his place was a teenager who disliked him.\nJungkook opened the first aid kit bitterly.\nBy the time he had finished changing the bandages and redoing the dressing, Jimin was slipping on his shoes, getting ready to leave for work.\nJungkook found out Jimin was a mildly famous contemporary dancer under a growing agency and he felt a mixture of awe and envy. It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t proud \u2013 grudgingly he admitted how amazing Jimin was at dancing \u2013 but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t a bit jealous. It had always been a bit competitive between the two of them, Jungkook didn\u2019t like the feeling that he had lost.\n\u201cBreakfast is on the counter.\u201d Jimin said as he tied up his laces, eyeing Jungkook with lingering concern. \u201cCall me if you need anything, my number \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIs on the fridge. I know.\u201d Jungkook interrupted without meaning to, but Jimin laughed lightly.\n\u201cShort-term memory is working, at least.\u201d\nJungkook felt a bit of annoyance rise up at the jab and was about to sarcastically retort when another voice rang in his hand, harsh and dangerous \u2013 he\u2019s just fucking teasing, close your goddamn mouth.\nHe gulped and did just that.\nJimin picked up his bag and walked towards him, his palm hovered around Jungkook\u2019s arm for a few seconds before hesitantly tracing a finger down a scratch on his forearm. The touch is light and only for a few seconds and yet it was a perfect semblance of Jimin\u2019s vulnerability. \u201cBe careful.\u201d\nJungkook frowned. Why did he need to be careful? He wasn\u2019t going anywhere today? He figured it probably didn\u2019t matter, Jimin was worried sick about him and he needed reassurance. Jungkook gave what he prayed was a comforting smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back?\u201d\n\u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d\nJimin wavered at the door and Jungkook knew he should be doing something right about now but he couldn\u2019t recognise what. Yesterday, Jimin had said he usually gave him a kiss goodbye.\n\nOh, that\u2019s too fast.\n\n\nI can\u2019t.\n\n\nBut he looks so unsettled.\n\nMustering up the courage, he grabbed Jimin\u2019s hand and squeezed it. His hand felt nice in his. Familiar. Belonging. \u201cGo.\u201d\n\nI'll still be here. I promise.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the next couple of days things gradually became a little calmer between them, both trying to accept what had happened and move on as normally as possible. It was still awkward most times, Jimin still seemed weary and cautious around him, but at least Jungkook somewhat learnt to keep his thoughts in his head.\nHe eventually began to remember snippets of information, most of them fleeting and without much context, it was hard to try piece fragments of random images and voices in his head. Some days it was exhausting and Jungkook was furious with everything and everyone \u2013 he took that out on Jimin with sharp words and a short temper. How Jimin put up with him he would never understand.\nOne memory that left him feeling extremely confused was one of Jimin in a dance studio. He wasn\u2019t crying, but he looked\u2026 broken. And Jungkook felt so much hurt seep through his body seeing him like that. This was then followed by blurry clips of Jimin dancing, Jimin curling into Jungkook\u2019s side as they sat on a cold couch, Jimin frowning at his reflection.\nJungkook wasn\u2019t sure if he should ask Jimin about it, if he was in a position to be able to.\nHe found it easier when he tried not to think about him and Jimin being in a romantic relationship, and just focused on being friends. Strangely, the thing that bothered Jungkook the most over time was surprisingly not the nature of their relationship, but Jimin\u2019s dramatic shift in character from the teenage boy he was envisioning.\nPast Jimin had been confident and boisterous and attention seeking, this Jimin was slightly shy and collected.\n\u201cYou\u2019re different from how I remember,\u201d Jungkook started one night as he cut up meat to put it on the grill on the table, Jimin pausing to blink up at him, \u201cyou\u2019re more\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 quiet.\u201d\n\nWas that the wrong adjective? I\u2019ve always been bad with vocabulary. I should have used the word \u2018mature\u2019\u2026 though that isn\u2019t what I want to convey either. \n\nJungkook licked his lips and hoped Jimin didn\u2019t take offense, even though he still thought Jimin was being a bit too sensitive sometimes.\n\u201cOh\u2026 I guess,\u201d he chewed on his lip as turned over some of the meat. \u201cI um\u2026 purposely tried to be loud back then.\u201d\nJungkook faltered. Really? \nSeeing the disbelief on Jungkook\u2019s face, Jimin glanced down and his cheeks tinted a bright shade of pink. Jungkook got the feeling that they had had this conversation before. \u201cYou were always so oblivious. I was trying to get you to see me. It was hard, because I was actually quite shy\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat.\n\nThe showing off, the over-affectionate comments, had they just been avenues to get Jungkook\u2019s attention?\n\nBullshit.\n\nJimin would always ruffle his hair and lick his lips in that lewd, overconfident way and how could that possibly be the actions of someone who wasn\u2019t naturally brazen \u2013\n\nWell actually\u2026\n\nNow that Jungkook thought about it, he could see slight discomfiture around Jimin\u2019s seemingly self-assured actions and seconds \u2013 split seconds \u2013 when his mask slipped and there he was \u2013 a slightly awkward, withdrawn boy crushing on someone who didn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings.\nBut there was something darker lingering in that image \u2013 teenage Jimin was withdrawn, present Jimin was simply introverted. A bad feeling settled in Jungkook\u2019s stomach and suddenly he felt the urge to smother Jimin in affection. Before he could do or say something stupid Jimin clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth.\n\u201cThe vegetables are cooked.\u201d He handed him a plate as he picked up his chopsticks, shaking Jungkook from his reverie.\nJungkook rubbed the back of his neck, imagining the stocky boy with messy hair and basketball shorts.\n\nHad he really known Park Jimin at all?\n\n\u201cSo you did all that annoying shit for me?\u201d Jungkook sputtered before his mental editor could delete the stupid sentence. Seokjin would have his head if he heard. Present/future Jungkook would probably section off his limbs.\nJimin slouched in his seat, expression pinched. \u201cI-I guess. It was stupid. I know.\u201d\nJungkook took a deep breath and tried to gentle his voice and choose milder words. \u201cLike, I mean, couldn\u2019t you see it was irritating me? It just makes \u2013 made me dislike you more.\u201d Nice save, Jeon. Totally not obvious. \nJimin was staring at his plate. \u201cYeah. It just seemed like the only way to get your attention.\u201d\nJungkook was half aware that he should stop right fucking now, but he couldn\u2019t hold himself back because he had wanted to know this for so long and was still trying to wrap his head around the fact they were together. \u201cSo boasting and showing off and fishing for compliments was the only way?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice was rougher and his grip on his chopsticks tightened. \u201cI was insecure \u2013 I didn\u2019t have the \u2013 I couldn\u2019t just\u2026\u201d He rubbed his temple and shot Jungkook a glare that was very un-Jimin-like but he probably deserved. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not talking about this with you.\u201d\nThere was something about the way he said it that made Jungkook flinch. \u201cWhy? Because we\u2019ve already talked about it before?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re not you! You already know why, a-and I never had to tell you because you already understood. Just \u2013 you\u2019ll remember soon enough. Can we please just leave it alone?\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck? \n\nJungkook scowled but Jimin didn\u2019t back down.\nThey ate in silence, and all the progress they had made suddenly seemed pointless.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou look better.\u201d Seokjin said as soon as he saw Jungkook, checking over his scars and making sure none were infected and were healing well.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jungkook answered flatly as he sat on the edge of the bed in Seokjin\u2019s clinic room. Looking better doesn\u2019t mean I am better. \n\u201cAnd your memory?\u201d Seokjin inquired as he typed on his computer.\nJungkook cleared his throat. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s getting there.\u201d\nHe saw images sometimes \u2013 glimpses of memories, and occasionally he\u2019d realise something that he was sure he hadn\u2019t been aware of before, for example, all his law study had come back and the other day he had found himself in a deep conversation with Namjoon about the outcome of a case, advanced legal terminology spilling out of his lips with ease.\nHe could recall events like Jimin once throwing the remote at the television screen because he accidently changed the channel to a horror movie and it unfortunately happened to be showing the worst part, or celebrating Namjoon\u2019s graduation and Seokjin\u2019s acceptance into medical school.\nHe remembered memories with Jimin in them too, it was impossible not to since it seemed like they had so many (three years worth!) \u2013 he recollected on a moment they had rolled around in bed listening to the rain, or the two of them making out secretly in the hallway whilst their friends were over and such. It had been bizarre when he first remembered them, and he almost felt like an intruder looking in to a private moment, but now it actually felt sort of normal and maybe a little nice. He wasn\u2019t going to lie, he had found himself staring at Jimin\u2019s lips maybe a little too long, imagining what they\u2019d feel like against his and if it was exactly like he recalled.\nIt was weird reminiscing those scenes, especially when present day Jimin went to hug him or kiss him and then remembered \u2013 he\u2019s not my Jungkook. \nThat image of Jimin huddled in the dance studio kept coming back, and each time he felt more and more pain and an urge to help him. Jungkook tried not to think about that too much.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Seokjin beamed. \u201cI was thinking \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI know what happened to you and Namjoon-hyung!\u201d\nJungkook groaned.\n\nExcuse me while I go set myself on fire.\n\nSeokjin blanched, glancing down and then composing himself a few seconds later. Jungkook didn\u2019t miss the hurt that he inflicted with those words, surely throwing salt on a scar that was still fresh. Seokjin swallowed and gave him a withering look. \u201cReally, Jungkook? Aish, such a child.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d He said meekly and Seokjin tutted but he didn\u2019t scold him further.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I really need to move on.\u201d Seokjin chuckled but it was strained and tight and so clearly forced.\nJungkook wiped his palms on his thighs. \u201cHave you thought about reconciling? Or\u2026 making up, whatever.\u201d\nHe saw Namjoon\u2019s dark circles and aged expression, and it was such a stark contrast to the beaming, life loving, knowledge hungry friend he thought he had. Present day Namjoon was barely a shadow of his past self.\nSeokjin smiled sadly. \u201cOf course.\u201d When Jungkook remained silent, waiting for him to elaborate, he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think trying again now would be a mistake. I feel like there\u2019s supposed to be a moment when I can miss him and not feel so defeated. I feel like it should be exciting again, the thought of going back to him shouldn\u2019t exhaust me, you know?\u201d\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know. \n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook said anyway and flipped his hair out of his eyes as a tension filled the room. \u201cBut what if that moment never comes?\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019re not meant to be.\u201d Seokjin turned back to his computer and resumed typing, voice heavy but laced with optimism. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kook, that\u2019s just how it is sometimes. You don\u2019t always end up with the person you think you will.\u201d\nJungkook glanced down and fidgeted, twisting his fingers together, elbows resting heavily on his knees. I guess that\u2019s true, I should know.\n\u201cHow are you and Jimin?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s voice was softer but curious.\n\u201cI\u2019m being nice, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so as he\u2019s patiently putting up with your teenage self for the second time.\u201d Seokjin quipped jokingly before becoming more serious, \u201cbut, seriously?\u201d\nJungkook rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t really know what else to say \u2013 they weren\u2019t fighting or avoiding each other so that was good, right? Sure, they had tense moments where their frustration ran high, but they were coping. It wasn\u2019t like Jungkook had much of a choice but to wait it out until his memories came back anyway \u2013 he had basically been thrust into a new life, into a stranger\u2019s relationship and forced to live. He couldn\u2019t make any decisions for himself when he didn\u2019t really know who he was. He couldn\u2019t just walk out and leave Jimin.\nNo, he definitely couldn\u2019t do that.\nSeokjin continued looking at the desktop but his tone changed, almost like he was trying to sound too casual. \u201cAnd is he eating well?\u201d\n\nEating? Where did that come from?\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook replied dumbly, that question seemed strangely out of the blue.\n\u201cIs he eating?\u201d Seokjin repeated and faced Jungkook with scrutinizing eyes like he was about to stare into his soul and pry the answer from his unconscious.\n\u201cUh\u2026 we eat dinner together, sometimes breakfast. Yeah, I think he\u2019s eating, I mean \u2013 I\u2019m not really watching to make sure the food is going into his mouth \u2013 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Jungkook cringed as Seokjin raised an eyebrow, undoubtedly judging his seventeen-year-old ass.\nSeokjin made a \u201chmm\u201d sound before turning back to his computer screen.\n\u201cWhy does it matter? Like, why would you ask that?\u201d Jungkook straightened his posture, suspicious. Is he thinking I\u2019m starving Jimin or something? I don\u2019t eat that much.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t remembered that yet, I see.\u201d Seokjin noted and suddenly that image of upset Jimin in the dance studio came flashing back, and the argument from the day before. Somewhere there was a connection that Jungkook couldn\u2019t put his finger on, buried somewhere in his mind which was still healing from the car accident. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should be the one to tell you about it.\u201d\nJungkook scowled. He hated things being hidden from him. How bad could it possibly be? \u201cWhy? I already know anyway! Like, present-future Jungkook knows! I\u2019m still him!\u201d\n\u201cWould you relax?\u201d Seokjin chuckled but his voice had a tense edge and it was strict, telling him to stop asking. \u201cJust\u2026 look after Jimin, please? I know your reeling from the accident too and this is also difficult for you, but don\u2019t forget that he\u2019s your boyfriend and how much you love him, even if you don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nSeokjin sounded desperate, demanding and pleading at the same time it stunned Jungkook. He thought about Jimin who was constantly treating his wounds, making sure he took his antibiotics, offering him the bed and always going out of his way to make him feel better. Even back in his timeline, so to speak, Park Jimin consistently put others before himself. Perhaps, in the moments he was selfish Jungkook hadn\u2019t been very nice about it.\n\nDid I hurt him before? Did I do something bad to him? Is this why they can\u2019t tell me?\n\nHis throat closed up and he was sure for a few seconds he felt something like tears prick his eyes. He couldn\u2019t possibly argue when Seokjin looked like that.\n\u201cO-Okay. I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe place was crowded.\nToo crowded.\nJungkook had his hands shoved deep in his pockets and elbows drawn tight into his body, face set in a probably intimidating expression, as his usual taciturn appearance did. Taehyung and Seokjin were avidly looking at the many different market stalls and buying items that \u2013 to be quite honest \u2013 they really didn\u2019t need, and both knew it.\n\n\u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have come. I should have said no like Yoongi. I should not have let Taehyung talk me into this.\n\nHe looked over his shoulder and furrowed his eyebrows.\n\nAnd where the heck is Jimin?\n\nHis gaze darted through the busy, buzzing crowd for the head of ashy blonde among the many brunettes. Jimin was the sort of person who would let people step in front of him like there was some sort of order to the crowd.\nHe strode over to Taehyung and Seokjin, feeling quite annoyed. Jungkook didn\u2019t like people brushing up against him from every direction, the half-hearted \u2018excuse me\u2019 and shoving and pushing. He hadn\u2019t expected the markets to be so popular. He\u2019d much rather be in bed, snuggled up and sound asleep under the blankets or, even better, having lazy, morning sex.\nJungkook flushed heavily at the unexpected thought.\n\nPresent/future Jungkook is not so pure.\n\n\nAnd would I be having sex with Jimin?\n\nHe almost wanted to cringe at the thought but before he could he had flashes of Jimin spread out and naked underneath him, skin sweaty and hair ruffled and mussed with sinful moans slipping out of his pretty, pink lips \u2013\nJungkook had to pinch himself hard in the forearm. Here was not the place to be remembering such dirty memories, or perhaps they were a result of his hyperactive imagination? Either way, did it matter? He just imagined fucking Park Jimin. He should be horrified. Except, Jungkook was actually kind of\u2026 turned on.\nSwallowing and shaking his head to clear his thoughts, he tapped Taehyung on the shoulder as he cooed at some crystals. \u201cHyung, I\u2019ve lost Jimin.\u201d\nTaehyung looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe left.\u201d Wrong words. \u201cI mean he\u2019s \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d Taehyung stammered, voice going hard and cold and Jungkook was momentarily dumbfounded at how fast his mood changed. \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 I meant that I don\u2019t know where he is! We lost him in the crowd!\u201d Jungkook sputtered back, a little offended that Taehyung would immediately assume it was something he did even if the odds were extremely likely.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Taehyung laughed lightly and Jungkook rolled his eyes. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll text him.\u201d\nWhilst Taehyung whipped his phone out and began typing on it, Jungkook\u2019s attention was caught by an ice-cream stall. He knew it was autumn and not exactly the best time for an ice cream, but he really felt like eating one.\n\u201cI\u2019m going over there.\u201d He told Seokjin who was now standing next to Taehyung.\nSeokjin just chuckled. \u201cSuch a kid.\u201d\n\u201cI have an excuse.\u201d Jungkook shot back much to Seokjin\u2019s amusement.\nThe line wasn\u2019t too long as expected \u2013 Jungkook hated lines. When it was his time to order he went with a classic flavour. He wasn\u2019t a big fan of ordering anything new or strange or exciting.\n\u201cVanilla, please. In a cone.\u201d Jungkook said as he fished out his wallet and pulling out a few notes.\nThe woman serving him pointed to a sign at their stall. \u201cYou can get another one for half price if you want.\u201d\nJungkook blinked and paused. He was sort of a sucker for deals like these. I guess I could get one for Taehyung? \n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Jungkook scanned the flavour options and amongst the many available options one in particular stood out for some reason. He may have even decided on it before he looked at the choices. \u201cChocolate caramel swirl.\u201d\n\nWait, isn\u2019t this a bit too sweet for Taehyung?\n\n\nWhy did I get that?\n\nHe paid and took the ice creams, feeling a bit conflicted and confused.\n\u201cJimin\u2019s coming.\u201d Taehyung said as he saw Jungkook approaching, raising at the eyebrow at the cones in both hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat two? Greedy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, idiot. Do you want this?\u201d He asked as he offered the other ice cream out.\nTaehyung looked at it, thoughtfully. \u201cWhat flavour is it?\u201d\n\u201cCaramel. Chocolate.\u201d\n\u201cNah. I\u2019m alright. But really, shouldn\u2019t you give it to Jimin?\u201d\nSeokjin\u2019s pleading expression popped back into his head.\n\nAh. Right.\n\nAs if on cue, Jimin cut through the crowd and appeared, relieved to finally have found them. \u201cSorry, thanks for waiting for me to catch up.\u201d\n\u201cKook got you an ice cream.\u201d Taehyung spoke before Jungkook could even open his mouth.\nHe shot Taehyung a look. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nJimin blinked up at him, eyes widening before they turned into crescents as he beamed, smile lighting up his whole face. \u201cOh. Thank you!\u201d\n\nWell, I can\u2019t say no now.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d Jungkook just muttered as he handed Jimin the other ice cream who took it with pink cheeks and surprised smile.\nJimin licked the ice cream and then stared at it for a few seconds, tongue tracing over his bottom lip quickly. Jungkook didn\u2019t mean to stare but the act was so simple and innocent yet he felt heat under his collar and for a second he let himself wonder what it would be like to kiss the ice cream off his lips and find the flavours in his mouth.\n\nStop. Stop, stop, stop. This is Park Jimin. You hate Park Jimin.\n\n\nBut I don\u2019t, really.\n\nJimin grinned softly and when he spoke his voice was thick with emotion. \u201cYou got my favourite flavour.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\n\u201cD-Did I?\u201d Jungkook scratched the back of his head, resisting the urge to scowl at the shit-eating grin on Taehyung\u2019s face. He felt weird warmness spreading across his chest and maybe, maybe his heart rate picked up. He\u2019s happy. \u201cIt was a good guess.\u201d\nAt that, Jimin\u2019s face fell.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou enjoyed today, right?\u201d Jimin sat down on the balcony of their apartment, eyes bright and cheeks rosy.\nJungkook looked wearily at the mug of dark coffee in his hand, body wanting and rejecting the drink. He certainly didn\u2019t want a repeat of what happened a few days ago but he was honestly craving for the taste of coffee. His gut wrenched whilst his mouth salivated.\n\u201cJungkook?\u201d\n\nJimin is talking, look up stupid.\n\nJungkook snapped, voice sharper than he anticipated. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nJimin hesitated, taken aback by his tone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Jungkook wiped his hands on his thighs and fiddled with the mug on the table.\n\u201cYou can tell me, Kook.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t mean to groan exasperatedly like Jimin was irritating him, even if he was a little. \u201cCan you not? I\u2019m just thinking about stuff.\u201d\nJimin sighed and he looked beat down and defeated and from somewhere deep inside Jungkook felt a sensation that may be panic, an urgency, which he quashed immediately.\n\u201cListen, I know this is challenging for you too, I think I forget that often, but I\u2019m trying to keep this as normal as possible for us \u2013 is that a mistake? I don\u2019t know how to help you if you don\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d Jimin mumbled quietly and glanced up apprehensively and Jungkook was momentarily raptured with the way his lashes cast shadows over his cheeks in the disappearing afternoon sun. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to tip toe around my boyfr \u2013 around you.\u201d Jungkook caught the word cut off with his lips, causing his stomach to plunge. \u201cI know you\u2019re seventeen right now, and I was never good at understanding you then. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nJungkook clenched his jaw and stared into the swirling hot liquid. \u201cAlright, whatever, just don\u2019t apologise. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\nJimin looked like he had been stung. \u201cWhat the hell, I\u2019m \u2013\u201d\n\u201cLike it\u2019s not your fault, so don\u2019t say sorry.\u201d Jungkook said firmly as he frowned into the sunset, trying to hide the heat prickling up his neck.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nHe grimaced and tried to lighten his voice. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m not good at this feeling stuff.\u201d\nJimin gave him a soft smile, seeming significantly more relaxed than before. \u201cYou\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\nThank God.\n\nThey sat in a nice silence, both more in their thoughts than their conversation at hand, one reminiscing and the other trying to remember. The same memories scattered \u2013 one with time and the other by trauma.\nThe sky was burning ochre and crimson when Jimin\u2019s glazed over eyes came back to the present and darted to the undrunk coffee. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you not going to drink that?\u201d\nJungkook turned his attention to the cold drink and pushed the mug away, heaving a sigh. \u201cSuppose not.\u201d\n\u201cIs something wrong with it?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Jungkook felt the walls coming up and with some reluctance pushed them down, recalling what they had just agreed on. \u201cIt reminds me of the accident.\u201d\nJimin faltered. \u201cOh. I-I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nHis mouth is suddenly moving fast, words tumbling out hastily in an attempt to erase that gloomy expression on Jimin\u2019s face. \u201cWell, how could you? It\u2019s fine, really, most of the crash is a blur and by the time I wake up I\u2019m in the hospital.\u201d\nHis words don\u2019t seem to reassure Jimin as much as he\u2019d hoped. Jimin made a weak sound and his fingers curled in his hair, like he was stressed. \u201cI should have \u2013 I made you late, you know. We were talking about pets again a-and I wanted a cat and you wanted a dog and\u2026 god, it was such a dumb conversation. It didn\u2019t even mean anything. So stupid.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Before he could process what he was doing, Jungkook leaned across and cupped Jimin\u2019s face, contact nice and familiar. He hated hearing Jimin talking like this, trying to take unnecessary blame, acting like he could have prevented this. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d\nJimin froze against his palm.\nJungkook leaned in until he could feel Jimin\u2019s breaths against his lips, just a little more \u2013 \n\u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d Jimin whispered, voice tight.\nWhat the fuck am I doing? \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to kiss me?\u201d\n\nYes.\n\nJungkook snapped back and his mouth twisted. \u201cWhat? No! I\u2026 It just felt like this is what I\u2019m supposed to do? I think?\u201d\nJimin broke away and stood up, skin flushed and voice shaky. \u201cI don\u2019t want that \u2013 don\u2019t want you like that.\u201d He bit his lip like he was about to come undone any second. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t sincere, don\u2019t bother, please.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to comfort you, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Jungkook raised himself on his feet, frustrated. Why did Jimin always have to be so difficult? Why was everything with him so complicated?\nThey were wrong words to say, and had Jungkook had his memories he probably would know why Jimin\u2019s face became sour but his bottom lip wobbled, why he looks conflicted and torn between being happy and angry. \u201cI don\u2019t want your affection like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, fine. I don\u2019t want to give you affection anyway.\u201d Jungkook huffed and then instantly regretted his words as Jimin flinched. It wouldn\u2019t be easy hearing such things from the person who is supposed to love you, trying to constantly differentiate\u00a0the characters, dissociating the words from the seventeen-year-old imposter and his actual boyfriend.\nJimin only glared at him before turning and walking back inside.\nJungkook\u00a0groaned as he pinched the bridge of his nose, eyebrows furrowed. Every time it felt like they took a few steps, they stumbled back a couple more. If this was how their communication was he didn't understand how they had managed to stay together so long. Their interactions were worse than when they had both been teenagers - at least then they had been friends and had fun, even if at times Jimin came on too strong and Jungkook wanted to push him away.\nNow,\u00a0Jimin was still frustrating even though he was quieter and refrained - how could he want to be with someone like that? And surely Jimin felt the same way towards Jungkook?\u00a0I couldn't possibly have changed that much in five years, right? Do I really love Jimin as much as everyone says I do?\nSomething significant must have happened between them during that time which forced the change in their relationship.\nHe needed to hurry up and remember, because right now they were just stuck.\nJungkook screamed inside his head, and he was pretty sure present/future Jungkook was screaming with frustration too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop. He really didn\u2019t. He was just going to get himself a glass of water before he went to bed, and had assumed Jimin would have gone to sleep by then. He felt bad making Jimin sleep on the couch \u2013 he had offered the bed numerous times \u2013 but Jimin insisted with his injuries he should take the bed.\nTheir awkward relationship was steadily improving, but every time Jimin looked at him with that longing gaze Jungkook felt all weird and out of place, and heat prickled up the back of his arms in something he was pretty sure was embarrassment.\nJungkook had just opened his bedroom door when Jimin\u2019s voice rang through the room, hushed but clear in the silence of the apartment.\n\u201cI\u2019m so scared, hyung,\u201d Jimin whispered and Jungkook slowly poked his head out to see Jimin sitting on the couch with his blanket wrapped around his petite frame, phone pressed to his ear. His back was to Jungkook and didn\u2019t seem to have heard his door open. \u201cWhat if\u2026 What if he never remembers?\u201d\n\nOh. They\u2019re talking about me.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel anything and it\u2019s been almost a month already,\u201d Jimin sniffled and Jungkook stared down at his feet guiltily.\nIt wasn\u2019t like he could do anything to speed up his recovery \u2013 he was trying. \nHe had memories, bits and pieces anyway.\nThe problem was that he didn\u2019t have the feelings.\nHe didn\u2019t love Jimin, not even a little.\nLike \u2013 sure, he liked Jimin \u2013 Jimin was kind and treated him well but Jungkook honestly couldn\u2019t fathom being anything more than that.\nHe would really like it if his nineteen year old pining Jungkook\u2019s feelings came back.\n\u201cWhat if he never remembers? What if his feelings have all gone? I liked Jungkook for years before he even looked twice at me, and I don\u2019t think I can go through that again,\u201d Jimin\u2019s hand clenched around his blanket and brought it up under his chin.\nThere was silence and Jungkook figured the person on the other end of the call must be speaking. He wondered who it was Jimin was talking to.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t stand the thought of being with me, hyung. You should have seen his face whenever I talk about things we did as a couple \u2013 he looks disgusted. I disgust him.\u201d\nJungkook swallowed and his grip on the doorknob tightened. That wasn\u2019t true. Jimin did not disgust him, it was just the idea of them doing so many romantic things when Jungkook felt nothing for the older astounded him. I really have to get a better poker face. \n\u201cHe won\u2019t fall in love with me again, hyung. Not like this.\u201d\nA pause and a shake of the head.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t like me. And sometimes I think maybe Jungkook fell in love with me unwillingly, you know? Because of all my\u2026\u201d Jimin trailed off but it was clear by his tone that whoever he was talking to knew the end of the sentence. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a good person underneath it all and I was desperate to be loved and \u2013 I know it\u2019s not like that anymore but\u2026\u201d\nJungkook poked his tongue into his cheek, feeling uncomfortable. A part of him wanted to love Jimin \u2013 he was supposed to love Jimin. But he couldn\u2019t, because he didn\u2019t. And what the hell was Jimin talking about? Unwillingly? What? Was he hypnotised?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this,\u201d Jimin wiped his eyes. \u201cSometimes he sounds just like him and I think maybe, maybe he\u2019s back\u2026 and every time it\u2019s not I almost want to hate him. I miss my Jungkook so much.\u201d A small sob echoed through the room and Jungkook saw Jimin\u2019s shoulders shake. \u201cI just want him back already.\u201d\nThe dull ache in Jungkook\u2019s chest became stronger and his body was thrumming with the urge to comfort Jimin. He looked so lost, abandoned, curled alone on the couch, tears streaming down his cheeks.\nJungkook wished present/future Jungkook would hurry up and come back too.\nThe call ended and Jungkook heard the device clatter onto the table and Jimin dived under the covers, body racking with sobs.\n\nDoes he do this every night?\n\n\nCry himself to sleep?\n\nJungkook felt a strange impulse take over and he walked towards Jimin, footsteps heavy but set. He had no idea what he was planning on doing but it seemed he didn\u2019t have to \u2013 his body moved on their own accord.\n\u201cJimin,\u201d he mumbled and Jimin turned his head to look at him, eyes wet, mouth falling open in surprise. He hastily wiped them away but new tears quickly replaced them.\n\u201cJ-Jungkook, n-not now,\u201d he tried to sink further into his blanket but Jungkook moved with a newfound stubbornness. He pulled the cover away and crouched down on the floor, leaning over Jimin\u2019s shivering frame. Jimin\u2019s eyes were rimmed with red and he was an absolute teary mess. Something akin to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over him and he furrowed his eyebrows, trying to pinpoint what it was. \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013 Kook \u2013 I\u2019m just a bit stressed \u2013\u201d\nJungkook placed a hand on Jimin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s gaze snapped up and he looked like he had stopped breathing. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Jungkook sighed and slipped an arm around Jimin\u2019s torso.\n\u201cJungkook \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jungkook said firmly and Jimin hesitantly shifted closer into his embrace, face pressing against his chest. \u201cJust\u2026 pretend.\u201d\nJimin wept into his shirt, and Jungkook usually didn\u2019t like people doing that because all he could think about was what if they get snot on me or I\u2019ll have to wash this shirt now but strangely all his body did in response was pull Jimin closer. Like instinct.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin cried, voice cracked and broken and raw.\nAnd twenty-two year old Jungkook must really love Jimin a lot if he didn\u2019t mind him wailing into his clean, white shirt.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook woke up to the sound of the alarm, groaning as he tried to lift a hand to silence it and then realising there was a heavy weight on his bicep. Disorientated and half asleep, after a few lazy attempts to dislodge whatever it was on his arm, he managed to roll his body and shut the alarm with his other hand. Half his body was now resting over this lump under the blankets, the very thing that was pinning his arm to the bed.\nOpening his sleepy eyes, he yawned and rolled onto his back, sunlight beaming through the gaps in the blinds slowly waking him up. A few seconds later he tilted his head and was stunned by ruffled, ashy blonde hair against his shoulder.\n\nWhy was Jimin here?\n\nJungkook panicked for exactly 2.5 seconds before the events of last night came rushing back \u2013 Jimin crying. Once he had calmed down, Jungkook felt helpless and lost as Jimin wiped his eyes and tried to compose himself. Jungkook couldn\u2019t leave him on the couch alone, not when he seemed so vulnerable.\nHe just couldn\u2019t.\nJungkook offered Jimin the bed and, he had been rather nervous and awkward sliding under the covers next to him, but something about the way Jimin fitted so perfectly against his body was oddly satisfying.\nEven weirder, Jungkook was not a cuddle-person in bed. He was a blanket hog and liked to spread out and take up as much space as physically possible, whilst Jimin was honestly a human koala \u2013 still, for some reason he didn\u2019t really mind.\nAnd also, Jimin smelt nice.\nJungkook blushed hard at that thought. That is such an awkward feature to notice.\nBut really, he smelt like vanilla and lavender and all things warm and soothing. Jungkook had been lulled to sleep, and the smell brought back a wave of nostalgia and memories of giggles and hushed whispers and promises of forever.\nMaybe ten minutes later, Jimin stirred. Jungkook realised Jimin was the type of person who woke up really, really slowly. He rubbed his eyes, made a soft moan in the back of his throat as he pressed his face into Jungkook\u2019s neck and \u2013\n\nOh fuck.\n\nJimin kissed him.\nJungkook tensed and his eyes went wide as Jimin sleepily clung closer to him. His knee brushed across Jungkook and the other realised with mortification that he had morning wood. And Jimin rubbing against him and making quite adorable sounds was certainly not helping.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Jimin mumbled, voice cracked and raspy. He raised his head lethargically, eyes still shut, and pressed another soft kiss against Jungkook\u2019s cheek.\nThis time, his body relaxed against Jimin\u2019s lips and he tilted his chin, gaze falling on those gorgeous, plump lips (he felt himself harden a little and the very, very dirty side of him \u2013 he was a horny teenager after all - wondered what it would look like stretched around his cock). Jimin\u2019s mouth moved down his jaw and kissed him again, close to Jungkook\u2019s own lips which had parted.\n\nThis is actually not such a bad way to wake up\u2026\n\n\u201cOh, my god,\u201d Jimin snapped back and Jungkook felt disappointment flood his body as his erection throbbed. Jimin was now wide awake and looking downright terrified. \u201cI\u2019m so \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise \u2013 I thought \u2013\u201d\n\u201cThought I was your Jungkook,\u201d Jungkook said in a tone that came out surprisingly bitter. He was frankly starting to get a bit annoyed with the whole \u2018my Jungkook\u2019 ordeal.\nJimin meekly looked down. \u201cY-yeah. Sorry.\u201d\nJungkook sat up and sighed, keeping the blanket over the lower half of his body. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Jimin squeaked out again, embarrassed, and slipped off the bed. Jungkook bit his lip as his gaze dropped down to his ass and \u2013 okay, Jeon, now is not the time. \u201cI should start getting ready for work. Um\u2026 thank you for last night.\u201d\nThey swept that incident under the rug.\nBut since then, Jimin slept in the bed with. It just sort of happened without neither of them explicitly saying it. Having Jimin nestled beside him was somewhat comforting and reassuring, and Jungkook found himself lying wide awake, mind racing with scattered memories and gluing them back together as he tried to recreate his past reality.\nHe was trying\u2026 he knew it really wasn\u2019t enough right now, but what more could he do?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t easy having so little control over his life.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy not recognising himself.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy still having blanks in his memory.\nSome days the frustration amounted and Jungkook wanted to pull his hair out, wanted to give up and cry. But he didn\u2019t, because Jeon Jungkook was not a quitter, and that was something that would never change.\nHe did need an outlet, though, and from the gym membership in his wallet and his significantly more bulked up body, that came from exerting himself physically. He hadn\u2019t been able to go since he was recovering, but once the final bandage was off \u2013 and staying off \u2013 and his bruises had faded, he couldn\u2019t have been there fast enough.\nThe strain of his muscles was familiar, the tiredness and ache if he pushed himself too much was also well-known. He did boxing too \u2013 the movements came back without a second thought and, before he even realised it himself, he was moving around the ring, hands in gloves, instructor giving him orders.\nJungkook let himself loose in those moments. Let himself admit how badly he wanted his life back.\nAnd he really did want to love Jimin. He just didn\u2019t know how.\nHe came back from the gym one morning, hair slicked with sweat, desperately in need of a shower, towel around his shoulders and muscle tee clinging to his body, to find all five of his friends in his apartment, Jimin sitting on the couch beside Taehyung and Yoongi. Seokjin and Namjoon were sitting on opposite sides of the room.\n\u201cUm. Hey?\u201d Jungkook questioned as he stepped through the door, dropping his bag on the ground at his feet, shooting Jimin an inquisitive look. \u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d\n\nWas there something on today? Crap, is it someone\u2019s birthday?\n\n\u201cWe just felt like coming to hang out with you two.\u201d Yoongi said nonchalantly.\n\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d Jungkook murmured and looked at Jimin who gave him a soft, slightly apologetic smile. Seokjin was facing them both and he seemed downright worried.\nJungkook grabbed his towel from around his neck and wiped his forehead. \u201cCan I go shower before we\u2026 just sit there?\u201d He was getting annoyed with the clothes sticking to his skin and the drops of sweat on the tips of his hair strands.\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Seokjin cleared his throat and began but Jimin cut him off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, go shower Jungkook.\u201d He brushed off Seokjin\u2019s protests. \u201cHe hates being sweaty after the gym.\u201d\nJungkook grinned gratefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nAs he passed, Taehyung suddenly piped up. His hyung was known to be amusing and funny, sometimes blurting out the most bizarre statements, but what he said next had everyone tensing.\n\u201cWow, remember when you used to be that ripped Jiminie?\u201d\nThere was a weird fizzle of tension and then it cracked and splintered, breaking from the pressure in the room. Seokjin cupped his mouth, Yoongi shot Taehyung a look and Namjoon\u2019s eyes flickered to Jungkook.\nBefore any of them could even utter a response Jungkook beat them unintentionally. He didn\u2019t know why his legs were carrying him back to Jimin or why he felt irritation in Taehyung\u2019s words.\n\u201cHyung, don\u2019t.\u201d His voice came out low and dangerous.\n\nI\u2019ve never spoken to Taehyung like that before.\n\nTaehyung blanched and then swallowed, looking to Jimin who was trying to calm the situation.\n\u201cEveryone, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m okay, why are you all reacting like this?\u201d he chuckled confusedly and looked guilty for causing the whole ordeal. Jungkook took Jimin\u2019s wrist, who swerved around unexpectedly, eyes softening instantly and glancing down at his hand. \u201cKook \u2013 I\u2019m alright. Seriously. Chill.\u201d\nTaehyung squeaked out an apology which went ignored by the youngest in the room.\nJungkook stared into Jimin\u2019s eyes, searching for something, maybe the truth and honesty in his words\u2026 and he found them. That image of Jimin and the dance studio tumbled to the forefront of his mind and he held Jimin\u2019s wrist a little tighter, suddenly scared that Jimin wasn\u2019t here even though he was right in front of him.\n\nHyung\u2026 hyung, look at me. Stay with me.\n\n\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin chuckled as he slipped his wrist out from his grip, cheeks dusted with the loveliest shade of red, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nJungkook blinked, shaken out of his stupor, half wondering how Jimin knew his desperate inner thought. What was that all about? He cleared his throat and ducked his head, fingers burning from the contact he initiated. \u201cUm, I\u2019m going to go shower.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\nJungkook swiftly left, not sparing a look at the others. As he was leaving he could hear their voices carrying from the room behind.\n\u201cWhy did you guys react like that? I\u2019m fine.\u201d That was Jimin.\n\u201cSorry! But you were so upset on the phone the other night I freaked out that maybe you were regressing!\u201d\n\u201cSeokjin-hyung \u2013\u201d\nNamjoon cut in. \u201cWe\u2019re just concerned about your health. Seokjin was really worried and called me and the others.\u201d\n\u201cGuys, I really am okay.\u201d\nYoongi spoke up. \u201cDoes Jungkook remember? He reacted like \u2013 well, like he normally would.\u201d\n\u201cOverprotective.\u201d Taehyung grumbled good-naturedly.\nJimin\u2019s reply was week and hesitant. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t talked about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNamjoon and Seokjin were quietly chatting when Jungkook walked briskly back into the room. It was the first time he had seen them together since the accident and, though they were not as comfortable or close as before, the atmosphere was civil and bordering towards casual and friendly. To anyone that would be good news, but to Jungkook he was silently waiting for one of them to lean over and peck the other on the cheek \u2013 a gesture they used to do so often.\nIt never happened.\nJungkook went to sit down beside Taehyung and Hoseok who were playing a game, swearing at each other and pressing furiously on the controllers, but from the corner of his eye saw Jimin glance up expectantly at him. He changed directions and went to Jimin, heart beating a little faster when their eyes met.\nHe still felt embarrassed about his outburst and response earlier, not even sure why he reacted the way he had.\n\u201cCan I sit here?\u201d Jungkook mumbled softly and Jimin\u2019s eyes lit up and it was, well, sort of endearing.\nJimin shuffled across, feet tucked under him and book in his hand. Yoongi was sitting on the floor at his feet and has leaned his head back and was resting it against Jimin\u2019s knees. Something dark simmered under Jungkook\u2019s skin and he shot the back of Yoongi\u2019s head a bitter scowl. Yoongi had always had a soft spot for Jimin and seeing them so close made his stomach clench.\n\nRelax. What is wrong with me?\n\nJungkook cleared his throat nervously. \u201cAbout earlier, um, if I made you uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stress,\u201d Jimin smiled, before chewing on his lip, \u201cI\u2019m in a good place, you already know that.\u201d There was a brief pause, a moment of hesitancy, before he scratched the back of his neck sheepishly. \u201cRight \u2013 you don\u2019t remember \u2013 but I am.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jungkook wasn\u2019t sure what they were talking about but he found his eyes running over Jimin\u2019s body, the tightness of his clothes, the colour in his cheeks for \u2013 for something. The fact that he didn\u2019t know what he was searching for made him on edge. \u201cOkay. Good. I was worried.\u201d\n\nHealthy. Jimin is healthy.\n\n\nAnd here.\n\nJimin gave a gentle grin before turning back to his book.\n\nWith me.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPork belly. Fuck, that\u2019s a lot of chilli. Hot. Water \u2013 no, not water \u2013 tea. Everyone is laughing\u2026 except Jimin. Jimin has been quieter than usual lately. Less annoying. Stressed, maybe? He looks tired. Pretty. Crescent eyes. Ew, Seokjin and Namjoon being lovey-dovey again. Food. Is that all Jimin ordered? He\u2019s not hungry? He danced a lot. \n\n\n\u201cI ate before.\u201d \n\n\nLiar.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook remembered later that night, lying wide awake, in the middle of one of his memory reminiscence. The events of that day must have shaken present/future Jungkook from the trauma, reeled him back to the now \u2013 teenage Jungkook needed answers and he was going to get them.\nThe knowledge tumbled back so abruptly, sharply, that it seemed that one second he had no recollection and the next he wondered how he ever forgot.\nHis body froze under the sheets, Jimin\u2019s warm body sleeping beside him, causing his head to jerk to the side and stare, stunned.\nSeventeen-year-old Jungkook hadn\u2019t realised that Jimin \u2013 loud, assured, charming \u2013 had a barely existent self-confidence, an even more distorted and skewed perception of self. On the outside he put up a great fa\u00e7ade, he had everyone fooled, but all along it was a shield, a guard, a way to protect his friends from his negative, damaging thoughts, meticulously created and perfected to draw the attention away from his nervous lip biting, his erratically tapping hand on his knee, pushing hair away to give himself time to think, to muster the strength to stay together, keep up the image.\nJimin didn\u2019t compete with Jungkook to put him down, prove he was better, but because Jungkook was golden, everything came easily to him. He was the best of the best, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, there was only space for one at the top and that was where Jungkook belonged \u2013 upon the praises and adulation and triumphs. Jimin never wanted to rub his achievements in Jungkook\u2019s face to upset him or undermine him, he just wanted to feel like he could compare, that he too could be admired.\nJimin thrived on the compliments, the encouragements from his peers, the attention. It was how he assured himself, whilst he desperately strived towards an unachievable goal \u2013 perfection.\nJimin didn\u2019t even know what perfection was.\nHe thought it meant steady, top grades, flawless dancing, unwavering kindness and courtesy. And then the obsession spread like a virus, morphed his every desire \u2013 perfection was charismatic, perfection was tall, perfection was a ripped body, perfection was skinny. He despised the baby fat on his cheeks, the tightness when he wore jeans. He hated everything.\nHe fasted and dieted, exercised until his muscles were screaming for rest \u2013 if his body wasn\u2019t sore and his stomach painfully empty, it wasn\u2019t right.\nSeeing Jimin like that killed Jungkook.\nHe missed the annoying Park Jimin, the one who drove him insane, made his temper flare like nobody else, and then he\u2019d turn into an innocent puppy and Jungkook was frustrated because how was he supposed to get pissed at someone who was so kind and sweet, who would never do anything out of meanness? How could he possibly hate Park Jimin when he\u2019d drop everything for someone \u2013 would drop everything for Jungkook?\n\nJimin was twenty when it all went down \u2013 struggling at the dance academy, struggling with his self-image, struggling with Jungkook. It was all too much a burden to carry without help, and Jimin \u2013 he always wanted to shoulder everything alone.\n\nWhen Jimin pulled away and withdrew himself Jungkook felt his absence to the core. After that, glimpses of Jimin and snippets of conversation were things to be held onto, genuine smiles were even more precious. Jungkook didn\u2019t realise he had been a bit too busy disliking Park Jimin that he hadn\u2019t realised he may have accidentally fallen in love with him in the process.\nJungkook reached for Jimin\u2019s waist under the blanket and sighed into the darkness. He had lost a lot of muscle from his high school days, but he was still lithe and toned \u2013 a dancer\u2019s body.\nAnd, above all, healthy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jungkook whispered, guilty and regretful, and wishing he\u2019d known earlier and never forgot it. It wasn\u2019t something he wanted to find out about twice.\n\u00a0He wondered if he should bring it up with Jimin later, but maybe some things were left unsaid - or spoken only once.\u00a0\nPresent/future Jungkook had reassured him countless times before, held him close and whispered in Jimin's ear, voice laced with adoration.\u00a0\"I love you the way you are, hyung.\"\nAnd Jimin would giggle, and believe him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf there were good points to losing one\u2019s memory, it would be rediscovering his talents. The warm feeling of satisfaction was something Jungkook was admittedly used to, but still loved it.\nHe flicked hair out of his eyes as he cracked an egg, movements quick and smooth.\nHe learnt he was good at cooking.\nLike, really good.\nPossibly, Seokjin good.\nHe sliced vegetables with clean precision, could fillet fish beautifully, reduce jus and enhance subtle flavours and get the perfect medium rare steak. It was one of those moments when Jungkook himself was honestly surprised at just how good he was at well, a lot of things, and yes, he was getting a bit big-headed, but he could cook. \nHe could have opened that lamb skewer restaurant for goddamn sure.\nBut he\u2019d realised he had an unexpected interest in law, and after speaking to Namjoon about it, had been confident in his decision to obtain that certain degree. There was enough injustice in the world already, and particularly how often the legal system failed people, he felt he needed to step up \u2013 do something more. He knew had a position waiting for him at Namjoon\u2019s law firm when he was ready.\nThe door opened and Jungkook raised his head. He had still been asleep when Jimin left for work, but Jungkook was determined to at least try and be the boyfriend Jimin once had, or still had \u2013 or has, whatever. Maybe it would prompt his feelings to come back. Maybe it would just make things easier between them. Either way, Jimin deserved it \u2013 Jungkook had seen him looking at a framed photo of him in the hallway, just standing and staring, before abruptly scooting away when he noticed Jungkook. Jimin must be terrified having the person he loved just brusquely detach, so close and so far.\nNo one deserved that.\n\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Jungkook mustered the courage to ask as casually as possible. He didn\u2019t normally take interest into Jimin\u2019s day but he\u2019d assumed his future self would.\nJimin looked worn out and tired, as he often did. He smiled warmly. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Rehearsal was long. We have a concert coming up so Kim-ssi is pushing us so hard.\u201d\n\nOh. Crap. I should have known that.\n\n\u201cWhen is it? The concert.\u201d Jungkook chewed on his lip as Jimin walked towards the bathroom.\nHe gave a shaky laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come, Jungkook, it\u2019s not really your thing.\u201d\nJungkook frowned as a pang of hurt formed in his chest. Granted, modern dance was not where his interest lay, but if Jimin was dancing he should go. He would go. He wanted to. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nJimin paused, giving him a long stare. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jungkook rubbed the back of his neck under Jimin\u2019s stunned glance. \u201cWouldn\u2019t \u2018your Jungkook\u2019 go?\u201d\nAt that, Jimin\u2019s gaze dropped and his whole form changed, from rigid and defensive to relaxed and fond. He was so in love Jungkook could see it almost radiating off of him \u2013 Jungkook felt like a devious homewrecker who broke up the clearly happy, in love couple.\n\u201cHe comes to all my performances.\u201d\nJungkook cleared his throat, cheeks feeling hot for some unknown reason. \u201cWell, then. I\u2019m going.\u201d\nJimin still seemed a bit perplexed, but undeniably pleased. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook bit on his tongue and kept his facial muscles under control as Jimin flipped through their photo album of the past few years, hoping it would jog his memory. Jungkook was giddy with happiness \u2013 though he kept it subdued \u2013 when he\u2019d see a photo and remember the circumstances, then a bit dejected if he couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, this is really good progress Jungkook!\u201d Jimin said happily as he flipped the pages, eyes dancing with excitement. They were sitting on the bed together, a small distance between them and awkward leaning over the photo album to look.\nThe next few photos were of the two of them.\nJungkook couldn\u2019t deny it.\nHe looked exactly like a man in love would.\nIn so many of them he wasn\u2019t even looking at the camera, but gazing at Jimin with a lovesick expression, mouth in a small crooked smile and arms wrapped around his waist. Jimin was smiling so much his eyes disappeared into crescents, mouth open in a giggle. It seemed like Jungkook liked coming up from behind Jimin and resting his chin on his shoulder.\nJungkook was hit with a wave of longing.\n\nI look so content.\n\nHis friends were all right \u2013 there was no mistaking. He was enamoured. Fucking besotted. Photos alone were enough to prove it.\n\u201cSorry \u2013 y-you probably don\u2019t want to see stuff like this\u2026\u201d Jimin went to turn the page but Jungkook stopped him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2026 it helps.\u201d\nJimin\u2019s cheeks went red and he chewed on his thumb as he glanced back down at the photos.\n\u201cWe seem happy.\u201d Jungkook said, throat feeling constricted suddenly. He hoped he wasn\u2019t about to start crying.\n\u201cYeah, we were.\u201d\n\nWe were.\n\nJungkook hated the sadness in Jimin\u2019s voice, and the conclusiveness there was to his words. Like they had broken up and it was over. But it wasn\u2019t, Jungkook would come back eventually, he had to.\nJimin slowly turned the page and they were bombarded with more images of them, curled on the couch, on a train to Busan, at the beach, with a few of their friends. Jungkook found himself aching to go back to the life he once had, the one he had built with Jimin. The situation was so cruel and unfair, he still had everything, he just didn\u2019t fit in anymore.\nJimin was chewing on his lip and his eyes were watery.\nJungkook knew he was trying not to cry.\nGod, he hated seeing Jimin cry. It unsettled something deep within him, like when his childhood dog passed away from old age, or his grandfather got a tumour (it had been benign, luckily). He raised his hand and brought it down across Jimin\u2019s back gently, rubbing up and down in a way he hoped was soothing.\nJimin blinked up at him, lips parted slightly from being startled, and Jungkook couldn\u2019t stop the thoughts rushing through his head, the urge to press his own mouth against Jimin\u2019s consuming his desires.\n\nWhat is happening right now?\n\nJimin said something which went utterly unregistered by Jungkook, who simply gave into the temptation, eyes half-lidded and \u2013\nKissed him.\n\nFuck.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t anything like Jungkook thought it would be. It wasn\u2019t awkward or messy or uncomfortable, in fact his lips slotted perfectly with Jimin who melted against him, mouth moving against his softly. His hand crept into Jungkook\u2019s hair and tangled with the strands at the nape of his neck, a tug he was acquainted with. Jimin\u2019s lips were slightly chapped but nice, and he tasted like vanilla and lingering chocolate. Jungkook swore he heard fireworks, or maybe they just went off inside his body, sparks making their way up under his skin and to the tips of his fingers which dug into Jimin\u2019s waist.\n\nI\u2019m kissing Park Jimin.\n\n\nHim, of all people. \n\nAs soon as the realisation dawned Jungkook barely had any time to register it because it was Jimin who pulled away fast, breath heavy and pupils dilated, backing away a few inches on the bed and creating much needed distance.\n\u201cW-What was that for?\u201d Jimin stuttered accusingly, stare imploring.\nJungkook didn\u2019t even fucking know why he did it. \u201cI wanted to?\u201d\n\u201cYou w-wanted to? What?\u201d Jimin hastily got off the bed and was running his hands through his hair like he always did when he was stressed.\n\u201cJimin \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just do that! You can\u2019t just \u2013 play with my feelings like \u2013 fuck, Jungkook\u2026\u201d Jimin bit harshly on his lip and looked away, body tense and eyes brimming with something more heartbreaking than tears.\nThose words hit Jungkook harder than he thought they would. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so affected, at the least annoyed and insulted, but instead something clawed at his chest and squeezed his heart and he felt like his stomach was in his mouth. Play with his feelings? He\u2019s heard that before \u2013 he hated it then, and he hated it now.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what came over me, but you just looked so upset and\u2026\u201d he trailed off because he watched Jimin\u2019s expression turn sour, a shift he was familiar with, and the reason as to why in the back of his mind.\nWhen Jimin spoke his voice was low and quiet, but shaking. \u201cSo you felt sorry for me? Is this because of the other day? I don\u2019t need your pity Jungkook.\u201d He rubbed his forehead and his knee buckled and Jungkook almost sprang up to grab him and just\u2026 just hold him. \u201cIs this what it takes? For me to be weak and you to feel guilty and sympathetic for me? Is this what it takes to make you \u2013 you love me?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 say that.\n\nJungkook exhaled deeply and it was bizarre how he knew what Jimin was referring to, like in that precise moment the knowledge came back. It wasn\u2019t like in the dramas \u2013 time didn\u2019t slow down and emotions didn\u2019t come bubbling within him \u2013 it was absent one second, and now it was there, it\u2019s return unfairly swift. Like how life often was.\nJungkook felt his shoulders slump, Jimin\u2019s words heavy. The timing of his amounting feelings with the unravelling of Jimin\u2019s illness, and how Jungkook\u2019s intentions always somehow came out wrong, particularly to someone like Jimin who doubted himself enough, had set their relationship up on rocky terms. He had wanted to hold back and wait, in case Jimin misunderstood \u2013 which he did \u2013 but it was painful seeing the person he adored hate himself in return. Jungkook couldn\u2019t stand how Jimin didn\u2019t see how amazing that he was. How he didn\u2019t realise his quirks, his supposed shortcomings, were really just beautiful features that made up his character and that Jungkook was smitten with everything that was Park Jimin.\nIt wasn\u2019t the regret or the pity, it never had been. Jungkook\u2019s feelings had already been decided, his courage had just been slow, and the illness faster. But it suddenly didn\u2019t feel like that detail mattered, or enough to be resaid. Jimin knew deep down, he had to have by now. Present/future Jungkook would have made sure of that.\nAnd seventeen-year-old Jungkook was sick of the past.\n\u201cDoes it really matter anymore, Jimin?\u201d\nJimin\u2019s breath hitched and he glanced at Jungkook as if he misheard, silent.\n\u201cDoes it matter how or why I fell in love with you? What\u2019s important is that I did, and I \u2013\u201d his voice cut off and his heart beat faster but the words slip out before he could stop himself, \u201c\u2013 I still do.\u201d\n\nOh. Well, fuck.\n\nJungkook swore his blood ran cold. He felt defenceless and exposed. His mind was scrambling to stutter out an excuse like at least that what everyone says, you know but his jaw had clicked shut and he was taken by the way Jimin\u2019s frown softened, briefly speechless.\nFinally he looked down at his feet, sniffling discreetly. \u201cYou\u2026 You sounded just like him.\u201d\n\nMy Jungkook.\n\nAnd he had never sounded so relieved to say those words.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHyung? Are you alright?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cY-Yeah, just give me a second.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook chewed on the inside of his cheek and squeezed his eyes shut, jaw clenching and lips pressed tightly together when he heard the sound of the toilet flushing, and then the tap running. After another minute, Jimin emerged meekly, skin pale and eyes pink and slightly watery. He had some water droplets left on his chin which he hadn\u2019t properly wiped off. Guilt was all over his face.\n\n\nJungkook was fed up with seeing it. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jimin gulped as Jungkook\u2019s stare darkened.\n\n\n\u201cCut the bullshit. You can fool Taehyung and Namjoon but I\u2019m not falling for it for a second.\u201d\n\n\nJimin cleared his throat and tried to walk past but was held in place by Jungkook\u2019s hand on his upper arm, grip firm and knuckles white \u2013 not due to how tightly he was holding him, but by the tension in his whole body.\n\n\n\u201cJungkook, let go of me right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know what you do, okay? You need help, you need to talk to someone who can give you proper advice -\u201d\n\n\nJimin snapped as his face went hot and red with humiliation. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe fuck you are.\u201d Jungkook shot back, voice low and harsher than he had intended. It was awful seeing Jimin like this, so skinny and fatigued and using more energy than he had. His health was declining rapidly and Jungkook had enough of sitting around waiting for something to change. He just wanted to see Jimin happy again, see him laughing and boasting and glowing with health. \u201cHyung, listen, please. You don\u2019t have to tell me about it but, for god\u2019s sake, tell someone. I can\u2019t see you like this anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m figuring it out.\u201d Jimin shrank in on himself, eyes downcast.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s throat closed up and he had to take a shuddery breath to compose himself. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d Jimin winced. \u201cEveryone says you\u2019re in love with me, you don\u2019t do this to someone you love.\u201d\n\n\nJimin blanched at his blatant words, shocked and angry to be called out like that, for Jungkook to say his feelings like they were nothing, like they didn\u2019t mean the world to him. \u201cThat\u2019s selfish.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d But Jungkook had always been selfish with Jimin \u2013 craving his attention and giving none in return, expecting his kind words despite his blunt responses, taking and taking and taking from Jimin. But Jungkook would give everything he had, return it all, if he could erase the insecurities in Jimin\u2019s head right now. He\u2019d earn Jimin\u2019s affections the proper way, the way he should have from the start.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d Jimin turned away. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say that.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook pulled Jimin closer and felt his own body almost cripple with pain at how underweight Jimin was, how frail he felt. \u201cFor me, hyung. Get some help. No one is going to think less of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Jimin spat.\n\n\nJungkook kept his expression maintained despite the harshness of his words. \u201cWhy \u2013 can\u2019t I? Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy would you?\u201d Jimin sighed as he pulled away from Jungkook\u2019s arms, looking sad for a completely different reason. A reason that would continue to underline their relationship despite the reassurances, the promises that Jungkook had fallen for Jimin far before he could ever even imagine, a time so obscure he would never be able to exactly pin point it. \n\n\n\u201cJimin hyung. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\n\nJimin walked past Jungkook, head low. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\n\n\nAt least it was a start.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you two are reconnecting.\u201d Namjoon said warmly as he sorted out a few files, desk freakishly neat and tidy and everything properly labelled. So classic Namjoon.\nNamjoon, Jungkook realised, was like a typical idealised high profile lawyer with expensive ties and designer watches, hair smoothed back and cunning, but honest. Jungkook wondered how he would ever be able to keep up in such a profession, yet he felt a simmering confidence low in his gut that he could, and would.\n\u201cAnd Jin would want me to ask if Jimin\u2019s eating well?\u201d\nJungkook nodded immediately. \u201cI\u2019m making sure of it.\u201d Since remembering Jimin\u2019s struggles he had become extra conscious at meal times, to the point he was fairly certain Jimin was getting uncomfortable but then he would giggle and smile and, well, Jungkook was happy worrying about him (even if he didn\u2019t need to).\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Namjoon replied, relieved as he turned on his laptop, at the same time reaching for the slightly cooled container of rice and kimchi, with some side pickles, that Jimin had told Jungkook to bring him. \u201cNeed to talk about anything?\u201d\nJungkook sat down across from Namjoon\u2019s desk and looked to the corner of the mahogany surface, feeling like there used to be a photo frame there before \u2013 a silver and green one with a wobbly stand.\nRight, Seokjin and Namjoon at a restaurant after Seokjin graduated from medical school.\nJungkook sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Seokjin-hyung?\u201d\nNamjoon swallowed a bite of food, but besides that his expression remained the same. \u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cBut. But hyung, you fucking love him, right? You love each other, haven\u2019t you figured it out yet \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s been months \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t getting back together.\u201d\nJungkook stopped. The fuck? Did he hear wrong? \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nNamjoon gave Jungkook his full attention, corners of his lips turned down but something almost relieved in his eyes. \u201cWe talked a lot this week, we met up the other day for coffee. We told each other everything \u2013 what we loved, what we hated, the habits that drove us mad, what we missed.\u201d\n\nThat sounded wonderful? Why did it end with them not together?\n\nJungkook frowned.\n\u201cWe care for each other deeply. Seokjin will always, always mean something special to me.\u201d Namjoon\u2019s voice wavered but there was an undertone of certainty that threaded the words together, stitched his emotional wounds shut. \u201cBut we realised that our relationship had changed, we changed, and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Seokjin is an amazing doctor, and his patients come first \u2013 that\u2019s a sacrifice you make when you choose that profession. He needs someone who\u2019ll understand that. Me? My clients need me for all sorts of support, I can\u2019t let them down, I can\u2019t afford to lose focus for their sake. We\u2019ve become the people we wanted to be, we like who we are, we just don\u2019t fit together anymore.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Jungkook was sure he did not like the person Namjoon had become \u2013 a workaholic \u2013 or so he thought, but maybe his dislike just stemmed from his broken relationship with Seokjin. It was Jungkook that was unhappy with it because he thought they were meant to be together, they were in love. And they had been, five years ago. They hadn\u2019t been in love for a while.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s okay.\u201d Namjoon chuckled as he leaned across and ruffled Jungkook\u2019s hair, much like he used to when Jungkook was still in school. \u201cWe grew up. You did too. It was actually seeing you and Jimin overcoming this whole accident thing that we realised. You\u2019ll always find your way back to Jimin, and well, he\u2019s never been able to see anyone else but you. You two are endgame. Seokjin and I\u2026 we thought we were.\u201d\nJungkook fought the bursts of delight at Namjoon\u2019s words when describing his relationship with Jimin, tried to look past how glad he was to hear them. You two are endgame. \u201cBut you were perfect for each other.\u201d\nNamjoon gave a sad smile. \u201cAnd then we weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d\nJungkook wondered if that was how life was, just a series of shifts in dynamics. The changes seemed gradual and slow, but there had already been a set point in time where the change had occurred, events unravelled and bonds were broken and feelings declined. Or it was just that moment of realisation that was always late, when one day someone simply woke up and knew that it was never going to be the same again, there was no going back, only a ceaseless ascent towards the future. The only thing they had for sure was their past.\nAnd Jungkook had lost that.\nNaturally he had been lost and confused, drifting, unknown. But he had one thing for certain, for absolute certain.\n\nHe\u2019s never been able to see anyone but you.\n\nHe still had Jimin.\nNamjoon changed. Seokjin changed. Jungkook changed. They all did \u2013 everything did, everyone does, but Jimin\u2019s affection had remained right where it was before, where it\u2019s always been. Where they\u2019ve always belonged.\n\u201cI should go, leave you to work.\u201d Jungkook finally got up and gave Namjoon a good-natured hit on the shoulder before leaving, telling him to go to sleep early. I should accept it too. Namjoon and Seokjin are happier as friends, and friendship is a precious thing, even more so when it\u2019s been overthrown by love.\nOn the way back he walked with his hands deep in his coat pockets, winter cold whipping his cheeks. He buried his nose into his scarf and quickened his steps, a bad feeling settling. Just as he rounded the corner to their apartment a car squealed past, going too fast and skidding slightly on the road. Jungkook and a few other pedestrians stopped as other cars furiously beeped their horns and drivers shouted heated profanities. No one had been hurt, and the speeding car recovered control quickly. The whole incident occurred in a space of maybe two seconds.\nBut Jungkook found himself cowered into a crouch on the footpath, hand flying to wrap around his ribs and he was so sure he physically felt the slam of something against him, a harsh impact on the back of his head, the sound of the airbag and shattered glass pressing against his cheek.\n\u201cSir, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cAre you hurt? Is something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cCan I call someone for you?\u201d\n\nFuck. \n\nJungkook was slightly out of it as he wobbled back onto his feet, brushing off strangers\u2019 concerns with a tight smile and embarrassed cringe as he hurried back to his apartment.\nIt wasn\u2019t until he closed the door and could see Jimin cooking in the kitchen that his heart rate slowed down and he could finally breathe properly. His palms splayed out across his thighs and he closed his eyes as he steadied himself. I\u2019m fucking fine, and Jimin is fine. \n\u201cJungkook?\u201d Jimin had walked to him in the time it took for him to gather himself together \u2013 five seconds, five years. Jimin put a hand on his forehead as if checking for a temperature. \u201cYou look pale. Are you feeling nauseous again?\u201d\nJungkook shook his head as he leaned into the cool touch. \u201cI\u2019m okay now.\u201d\nJimin scanned his face for a few more seconds before dropping his palm. \u201cGo shower. It\u2019ll make you feel better. Dinner\u2019s ready soon.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook murmured dumbly as he straightened, for a second yearning to run his hands through Jimin\u2019s hair and across his back. \u201cCan we\u2026 can we talk later?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Jimin asked, tilting his head, looking anxious.\nJungkook just wanted to hear his voice, he wasn\u2019t fussed. \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe habits seeped back into his life, muscle memory beating his thoughts and common sense, muddled urges and vague inclinations embedding themselves back into Jungkook\u2019s daily routine. Jimin was in a rush again \u2013 he was often running late \u2013 and was piling his dance clothes into his bag, brushing through his hair with his fingers.\n\u201cAnd Taehyung is coming over later to hang out, idiot called in sick just so he could come play that new game with you.\u201d Jimin rolled his eyes as Jungkook sipped from his mug of tea (he wasn\u2019t sure if he could stomach coffee anymore, which was a shame because he was craving it badly. He probably could, but after his brief melt down in the streets it wasn\u2019t worth the risk right now). \u201cCan you guys not trash the living room like last time?\u201d\nJungkook held back a smile. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t deal with the fact that I was better than him.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Jimin replied, slipping into his shoes without a backwards glance, which Jungkook realised he had been waiting for when it didn\u2019t come. \u201cSee you later \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWait, hyung.\u201d Jungkook was a few inches away when Jimin turned around.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cDrive safe.\u201d Jungkook felt miserable and protective when Jimin\u2019s eyes scanned him like the bruises and wounds were left on his skin. They\u2019d healed a while ago. A few white scars remained but they were barely noticeable. The gashes in their relationship were deeper. And still open.\nWithout so much as a second thought Jungkook leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to his temple, drawing back in shock half a second later.\nA moment of stunned silence followed.\nJimin coughed and glanced down, suddenly shy and emotional.\nJungkook paled and his palms sweated. \u201cSorry. I just \u2013 I \u2013 fuck. I know you hate when I just do stuff impulsively.\u201d\n\u201cN-No. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s okay. I know it doesn\u2019t mean anything, it\u2019s just like an instinct, right?\u201d Jimin forced a smile and left before Jungkook could stutter out a protest.\n\nBut it does mean something.\n\nThat hollow sensation in his chest when Jimin rushed away had to mean something.\n\nYou love him Jeon Jungkook.\n\nAnd maybe for the first time he didn\u2019t just think it could be true.\nHe felt it.\nIt kept happening \u2013 the random wishes to kiss Jimin.\nJungkook got better at holding them back for Jimin\u2019s comfort \u2013 he didn\u2019t need to be confused any further, and yet the more he suppressed the more distressed he felt. This sort of feeling he was very much acquainted with, and he loathed the reminder.\n\nIs this his nineteen-year-old pining Jungkook?\n\n\nMust have been the worst year of my life.\n\nJungkook swore he felt his present/future self smack him upside the head, add that to the demanding voice he heard, or sensed, or felt in his subconscious \u2013 one of those things, Jungkook isn\u2019t sure which one - that seemed a lot like the present/future version of himself.\n\nIt was the best. You got Park Jimin.\n\nThe kisses may have stopped, but Jungkook\u2019s already loose dialogue was another weakness.\nHe had been tired, guard especially down, when the alarm went off. It was who fucking knows o\u2019clock in the morning and Jimin had rehearsal from that awful hour because of his upcoming concert.\n\u201cJimin \u2013 alarm,\u201d Jungkook slurred sleepily as he shook Jimin\u2019s shoulder, the alarm on his side of the bed. He rolled over and pulled the duvet over his head, groaning into the pillow, \u201cbaby, turn it off.\u201d\nJimin stirred and slammed his hand down on the snooze button after a few unsuccessful attempts, mumbling groggily. \u201cMm, sorry.\u201d\nJungkook was fairly sure Jimin had been too tired to even notice his slip up. The term of endearment had rolled off his tongue so nicely he had wanted to say it again. He bit said tongue.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Hoseok, it\u2019s university holidays \u2013 \u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said no. There is no way on this earth that I\u2019d ever go on that roller coaster. No \u2013 no means no Kim Taehyung!\u201d\n\n\nYoongi was looking pale and nauseous. The last ride hadn\u2019t agreed with him so he was sitting the next one out. \u201cI\u2019ll wait with Hoseok.\u201d\n\n\nTaehyung groaned with exasperation as he faced the others. \u201cYou will right, Jungkook?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, course.\u201d Jungkook laughed as he eyed the main attraction of the amusement park and his heart beat faster with excitement. He loved the rush of adrenaline and flip in his stomach when he was in free fall. It was the best.\n\n\n\u201cJimin, will you?\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\nJungkook turned to face Jimin who was standing beside Yoongi, looking like he wanted to be anywhere but in this conversation. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Taehyung begged. \u201cDon\u2019t make us go by ourselves. We need you too!\u201d\n\n\nJungkook watched as hesitation filled Jimin\u2019s eyes, glancing up at the huge drop in the roller coaster. \u201cBut I hate heights and it\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJungkook will hold your hand.\u201d Taehyung teased and Jimin rolled his eyes, pink warming his cheeks.\n\n\nJungkook shoved his hands into his jacket pockets and then blanched when he realised just how it seemed. Jimin looked away awkwardly and Jungkook wanted to kick himself. He wouldn\u2019t mind holding Jimin\u2019s hand, to be quite honest. His own face flamed at the thought.\n\n\n\u201cFine, let\u2019s just \u2013 whatever.\u201d Jimin huffed.\n\n\nThe three of them lined up at the roller coaster and Jimin complained the entire time, nervously bouncing on his feet and chewing on his lip. By the time they got to the front of the line, Jimin was shaking with nerves.\n\n\n\u201cFuck, that\u2019s high.\u201d He gaped as he sat down beside Taehyung and Jungkook, pulling the restraints down and gripping onto it tightly, knuckles white.\n\n\nJungkook felt rather bad when he saw how terrified Jimin looked. \u201cHyung, if you want to back out, now would be the time.\u201d\n\n\nJimin looked at him and then shook his head stubbornly, lips pressed nervously together. \n\n\nThe ride started and, as many roller coasters do, began the slow ascent up the track. Taehyung was already cheering and Jungkook would be too if Jimin\u2019s tight expression wasn\u2019t in his periphery. \n\n\n\u201cI hate you, I hate you, I hate you Taehyung.\u201d Jimin repeated as he squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cWhat if the ride malfunctions \u2013 fuck, I hate you.\u201d\n\n\nTaehyung scoffed and laughed.\n\n\nJungkook could see they were almost at the top. He glanced hastily to Jimin and then decided to screw the weird feeling in the pit of his stomach. \u201cHyung.\u201d\n\n\nJimin opened his eyes, with supressed panic. \u201cMm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere.\u201d Jungkook opened his palm and Jimin stared at him silently, surprised. \u201cWe\u2019re about to plunge down in a few seconds.\u201d\n\n\nJimin squeaked and gripped his hand, clammy and sweaty but tight and Jungkook felt a warmness in his body that was better than the adrenaline kick. \n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go, please.\u201d Jimin pleaded as he shut his eyes again.\n\nJungkook chuckled. I won\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook chewed on his lip as he blankly stared at the cards in his hands. The numbers and colours and symbols were hardly recognised by his distracted mind, ears tuned in on the sound of harsh, pouring rain outside and eyes every few seconds going to the door.\n\u201cJungkook, it\u2019s your turn\u2026 Hey. Kook. What\u2019s \u2013 seriously, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Taehyung leaned across and flicked Jungkook on the forehead, effectively getting his attention.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your turn. Can you please focus? I want to win and I want you to witness it.\u201d\nYoongi snorted with scepticism.\nJungkook sighed, not really caring much about the card game they were playing \u2013 Uno, was it? He was also fairly certain Taehyung was secretly, or even unknowingly, breaking the rules as he played. It was strange, because Jungkook was competitive, anything that could possibly be a competition was a competition. There was no such thing as second place or second best, not for Jeon Jungkook.\nSomehow, this was the second most important thing on his mind.\nFirst was that Jimin hadn\u2019t returned home yet. And he was worried, because it was raining so much and it was late. Surely, dance practice would have finished by now? Jungkook gulped as the thought crept into his head that maybe Jimin was pushing himself too much again\u2026 what if he was in that dark headspace and needed him to pull him out\u2026 maybe he should go to the studio \u2013\n\u201cOi. Jungkook.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s sharp voice cut over Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nJungkook put his cards on his lap. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nYoongi cocked an eyebrow.\nJungkook gave in. \u201cJimin\u2019s just not back yet.\u201d\nA pause.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Taehyung and Yoongi said flatly.\n\u201cWhat does \u2013 why did you say it like that?\u201d He sputtered in response.\n\u201cSo typical.\u201d Yoongi laughed before Taehyung was joining in after shooting Jungkook a knowing look, but also seeming delighted at Jungkook\u2019s concern.\nJungkook flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s late, that\u2019s all! And I even made dinner and it\u2019s getting cold. It wouldn\u2019t taste good being microwaved and \u2013 shut the fuck up \u2013 it\u2019s raining too.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay, calm down.\u201d Taehyung chuckled, just as the door opened and a dishevelled Jimin hurriedly walked in, shivering from the cold. Thankfully, due to underground parking he wasn\u2019t drenched from the rain.\nJungkook was on his feet faster than his pride would have liked. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d His voice came out stricter than he anticipated but it was harsh with worry.\nJimin reached out and squeezed Jungkook\u2019s shoulder soothingly. \u201cSorry, we had to stay back and perfect one of the dances. It took longer than I thought or else I would have messaged you.\u201d He made a teasing smile. \u201cWere you worried about me Jungkookie?\u201d\nHe must have expected Jungkook to deny it because his smile had been fortified with defences but Jungkook\u2019s response caught him by surprise.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nTaehyung squealed and Yoongi grinned into his hand after rolling his eyes.\nPink travelled up Jimin\u2019s pale skin. \u201cOh. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I should have let you know.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I was being dramatic.\u201d Jungkook said hastily, a little embarrassed with his easy disclosure of feelings. He wanted to just melt into the floor. And take Taehyung and Yoongi with him. \u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019ll get you a jumper. Dinner is on the counter.\u201d\nJimin gave a soft thank you as Jungkook turned on his heels, suddenly very awkward with a weird fluttery sensation in his stomach. Taehyung grabbed his arm on his way to the bedroom, saying low and mischievously. \u201cNot just a jumper, Jungkookie, get him yours.\u201d\n\u201cFucking get lost.\u201d Jungkook snipped back and it just made Taehyung dissolve into another fit of giggles.\nLuckily Jimin hadn\u2019t heard and was busy unpacking his dance bag whilst talking to Yoongi. Eventually, Jungkook managed to persuade Taehyung to leave with withering stares and scowls, since he had found a certain joy in teasing Jungkook and embarrassing him. Yoongi left soon after.\nOnce it was the two of them they sat in a nice silence, occasionally talking about this and that. It was a comfortable quiet. Peaceful, but overflowing with warmth and affection and contentment, brimming with unspoken, unneeded words, and full of indescribable, unique understanding. Somehow through little actions and gentle smiles they were in tune with each other.\nJungkook knew he had been missing this since the accident. He was glad they finally found it again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe dynamics of their relationship was changing, that much Jungkook knew. It was scary and not at the same time.\nHis memories had gradually eased back, of course with a few sections remaining in the ruins of the accident. He found glancing at photos often helped, and some smells and sounds as they linked back to memories and feelings and in those rare moments he was there, the Jungkook who lived in a logical, linear timeline. The Jungkook who loved and had loved Jimin. The Jungkook he needed desperately to return to.\nHe felt closest to Jimin in the mornings, when they found themselves pressed against each other, Jimin smelling like\u2026 home. It was always followed by an urge to wrap him in his arms and press his nose against the nape of his neck.\nNaturally, his comfortableness with his role as Jimin\u2019s boyfriend was easier to accept. He found himself pushing boundaries of friendship and into something more romantic, despite their agreement to just be friends, at least until his feelings came back. Jungkook worried sometimes that there never would be a point in time when everything just clicked. Maybe this was reality. His so-called future was the past and it wasn\u2019t coming back. No matter how much they both wanted it to.\nMaybe Jeon Jungkook was gone. Or he was already here. The merging of identities was blurry and confusing. Was there a moment when it all came rushing back like in the dramas, or did he just have to accept that this was him, the him of now?\nAnd if so, could Jimin accept that?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been nicer to me lately.\u201d Jimin murmured as they walked in the night\u2019s chill, scarf wrapped snugly around his neck. Jungkook was weirdly craving a bubble tea and they figured it was a nice evening to walk instead of getting stuck in city traffic.\nJungkook was glad the cold froze his skin from reddening. \u201cCan\u2019t I be?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to think you have to do these things for me.\u201d Jimin started softly.\n\u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t want to do these things?\u201d Jungkook mumbled quietly, dark eyes imploring. He surprised himself by his sudden confidence in saying such words. Surprised himself with how much he meant them.\n\nAren\u2019t we cheesy.\n\nJimin blinked before smiling slowly, eyes a little dazed off but warm and lovely. \u201cYou said that to me before, last time I asked you about it. Three years ago.\u201d\nJungkook cringed. \u201cAh, sorry.\u201d\nBut the other just giggled softly, breath visible in the night. His smile was sweet and lovely. Everything about Jimin was lovely, Jungkook realised. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook sucked in a deep breath as he pushed the keys into the ignition. His hands were sweaty and his heart was racing. When his car had arrived, polished and looking good as new, he had been over the freaking moon. But now, as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat, he felt frozen. He twisted the keys and the car hummed to life, air-con flooding the car and the radio starting up to fill the tense silence.\nJungkook sighed as he moved his hands to the wheel.\nHe could do this, he\u2019s been driving for years now.\nOkay, so, he just had to press on the clutch and \u2013\n\u201cJungkook?\u201d\nJungkook wished he hadn\u2019t flinched the way he had, heart hammering suddenly and a sweat breaking out across his forehead.\nJimin was gazing at him with brimming concern. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cUh \u2013 I \u2013 no, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 \u201d Jungkook shut his mouth as Jimin reached across and cupped the side of his face.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all cold and clammy.\u201d Jimin whispered. \u201cAre you \u2013 is it because of the accident?\u201d\nJungkook glanced away, mouth dry as he heard the screeching of tyres and that horrifying crunch and the impact right on his ribs and \u2013 Jimin \u2013 he can\u2019t leave Jimin \u2013 \nHe can taste the blood in his mouth and the coffee and he remembered waking up in the hospital \u2013 remembered he knew who he was, exactly who he was, his mind racing with questions, that brief second of clarity before he went under. He turned to Jimin who still had a hand on his cheek.\n\u201cCome here.\u201d Jungkook stammered and pulled Jimin closer, drawing in his scent and feeling his body against his. Jimin let out a hitched breath of surprise but quickly relaxed, rubbing circles into his back. Jungkook buried his face in Jimin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for anything.\u201d Jimin murmured as he smoothed Jungkook\u2019s hair and melted in his hold. \u201cLet\u2019s go back inside.\u201d\nJungkook cut the engine and they walked back to the elevator, Jimin keeping a hand on his lower back and looking up at him with worry. Jungkook could feel the sweat clinging on his skin and despite how much he loved his car \u2013 sleek and new and reliable, with the right amount of flashiness to match his secretly cocky personality \u2013 the idea of driving made him dizzy.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you a hot chocolate, okay?\u201d Jimin said as cheerfully as possible and Jungkook nodded wordlessly.\nOnce they were back in the safety of their apartment, Jimin padded to the kitchen and began heating up the milk. Jungkook felt an urge to wrap his arms around him, and because he was feeling vulnerable, he did. Jimin fit perfectly in his arms, contoured to the planes of his body.\n\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d Jimin asked and Jungkook pressed his lips to Jimin\u2019s neck, not really a kiss, just there.\n\u201cLater.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou broke down in the street?\u201d Jimin gaped as Jungkook embarrassedly admitted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? How long have you been feeling this way?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not constant, it comes and goes. For the most part, I\u2019m fine. Trust me.\u201d Jungkook reassured him as Jimin clasped his hands together and stared at the table. \u201cIt\u2019s just sometimes I feel all panicky and remember the last few seconds before the accident and I freak out a bit. Like when I vomited, or just like today with the car.\u201d\nJimin nodded as he worried on his bottom lip. \u201cDo you need to speak to someone about it?\u201d\nJungkook reached across the table instinctively to warm Jimin\u2019s hand in his. For a brief second there was a tense silence as they both stared down at what he had done. A wave of longing, washed over with hesitance. For some reason Jungkook was fixated on Jimin\u2019s fourth finger and a thought passed his mind but he couldn\u2019t quite process it in time. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m okay. I promise.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jimin breathed as he locked his fingers with Jungkook, cheeks flushed and eyes still on their hands. \u201cBut if you need to, or something else happens, tell me, please.\u201d He sounded regretful and guilty \u2013 two emotions Jungkook didn\u2019t like seeing on Jimin.\n\u201cI will.\u201d Jungkook replied and when Jimin finally raised his gaze to meet his, Jungkook felt an indescribable urge to pick Jimin up and press him against the nearest surface, whisper sweet nothings into his skin. The feeling swirled in his gut with no signs of disappearing. \u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\nSay it, Jeon.\n\nJimin tilted his head, prompting him to go on.\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jungkook cleared his throat and gave a sheepish smile. \u201cI just remembered I need to do something.\u201d\nJimin giggled as he slipped his hand out of Jungkook\u2019s, the loss of warmth disappointing. Jungkook hastily got up as his chest tightened.\n\nWeak.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook watched on helplessly as Jimin sat in the corner of the studio, head nestled in his arms and frame so, so skinny. Jungkook hated the way the shirt hung off him, how weak and tired Jimin looked no matter how much he was trying by going to counselling and trying to eat at least one full meal a day. \n\n\nJungkook had been told since he was young that he was golden, a star pupil, a talent, and yet the person he wanted to comfort was breaking down across from him and he couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\n\nJimin had been getting better, but today was a bad day, with no particular reason why today was worse than yesterday.\n\n\n\u201cShould I get Hoseok-hyung?\u201d Jungkook walked forward and knelt beside Jimin.\n\n\nJimin shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jungkook sat down next to him and hesitantly wrapped an arm around Jimin\u2019s narrow shoulders, all hard angles and sharp corners. But still, it was Jimin and he was beautiful. Jungkook coaxed Jimin to lie against him, feeling relieved when his hyung shifted in his hold to get in a more comfortable position. Jungkook knew they couldn\u2019t stay like that for long \u2013 the worst thing with Jimin was letting him stay static and wallow in his demons. In a few minutes, he\u2019ll have to get up and do something, like go for a walk or drive or something.\n\n\nIf he could let himself forget about Jimin\u2019s current state, Jungkook could imagine what it would be like if this was a few months ago \u2013 Jimin was laughing and teasing and glowing. And occasionally flirting with Jungkook \u2013 which he missed. Jungkook wondered if he\u2019d just realised sooner, acted sooner, maybe he could have prevented the way Jimin broke down, and all his beliefs that Jungkook despised him.\n\n\n\u201cWant to go to the dog park? I\u2019ll go kidnap Yoongi or Seokjin\u2019s dog.\u201d Jungkook said and Jimin laughed, too quiet.\n\n\u201cYoongi-hyung and Seokjin-hyung,\u201d Jimin reprimanded with no real bite. \u201cAnd I want to stay here.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm, let\u2019s go in a few minutes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jimin whined.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll like it.\u201d Jungkook added and squeezed Jimin\u2019s shoulder, and pressed a kiss into his hair, something he\u2019d started doing recently. Something he\u2019d been holding himself back from doing for a while. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. We can get lamb skewers after.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo food.\u201d Jimin mumbled, and despite his words there was shame in his tone.\n\n\nJungkook rubbed his back. \u201cTwo bites.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, hyung. I would know, because I\u2019m beautiful too.\u201d\n\n\nThe small giggle he received was worth it.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a brat.\u201d Jimin huffed.\n\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Jungkook conceded, noticing the tiniest of rises in Jimin\u2019s mood. When Jimin glanced up for the barest of seconds to smile at him, his whole body warmed and pleasant shivers went down his spine. \n\n\nHe\u2019d really like to be able to hold Jimin like this, but for other reasons. \n\n\nBut for now, it was okay, just like this. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeokjin typed quickly on his laptop as Jungkook described his episodes. He didn\u2019t really want to go but Jimin insisted he at least let Seokjin know, and well, could he really refuse Jimin when he looked so worried and guilty. If this would ease his concerns then Jungkook would go anywhere.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry this has been happening, Kook. I should have talked to you more about it.\u201d Seokjin said apologetically. \u201cThis was all so overwhelming for you and we neglected you.\u201d\nJungkook sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, seriously. I knew you guys were there for me and that was enough.\u201d He himself had gotten swept up in the cognitive damage of his accident, and then his concerns all revolved around how he would fit back into his life and with Jimin. He didn\u2019t think much about his emotional scars, but he knew he had support if he needed it. They\u2019d all be there for him no matter how many times he\u2019d push them away.\nHe was incredibly lucky to have all of them.\nBut especially Jimin, Jungkook thought as his lips pulled up at the corners. Was he always this smitten? Somehow, he didn\u2019t quite mind.\n\u201cIf it gets worse, you have to let me know.\u201d Seokjin said firmly and Jungkook nodded exaggeratedly. That got him a scoff and an eye roll. He typed something else on his laptop before facing Jungkook with an expression of a friend rather than his doctor. \u201cBesides that, how have you been?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m better.\u201d Jungkook replied and for the first time he really meant it.\nSeokjin must have understood as much because he smiled warmly. \u201cAnd you and Jimin?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re good too.\u201d Jungkook picked at a loose thread on his ripped jeans. Everything about Jimin was endearing, he was honest and generous, quick to forgive, and easy to love. \u201cI think I understand what you mean now \u2013 about being whipped for him. I can see why I would be.\u201d\n\u00a0Seokjin fought the \u2018I told you so\u2019 that wanted to burst from his lips. \u201cAnd are you?\u201d\nJungkook bit his lip and brushed the hair away from his eyes when he glanced back up. \u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d\nSeokjin laughed with relief, looking significantly more relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you two are figuring it out. You guys belong together.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Namjoon said too.\u201d Jungkook murmured and Seokjin gave a sad smile. \u201cHe said that seeing us made him realise that\u2026 maybe it wasn\u2019t working out for you two.\u201d Jungkook can\u2019t fight the small twinge of guilt when he said those words.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Seokjin nodded, but rather than melancholic or dejected he just seemed reminiscent. In love with a memory, perhaps. \u201cIt was the way you and Jimin just clicked, how naturally you two fall into sync. Relationships aren\u2019t a competition, or should be compared, but I guess we saw what we used to be in you two, and realised we just weren\u2019t the same anymore.\u201d\nJungkook picked at that loose thread again. \u201cI\u2019m happy you two are still friends, at least.\u201d He was, he really was glad, even if he still felt like he was reeling. He didn\u2019t quite know why he was so affected by their breakup, why he felt sick to his stomach when the fact that they had officially called it quits sunk in. He didn\u2019t know why it\u2026 scared him.\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Seokjin smiled and this time it was full of optimism, that not every sad ending was necessarily a bad one.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd, when we announced to our parents we were together\u2026 do you remember that?\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about when we went to that amusement park?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that time you drank too much and threw up in Hoseok\u2019s car?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d\nJimin giggled as they sat on the couch, waiting for the advertisement break to end, blocking out ridiculous adverts and corny music by picking Jungkook\u2019s memory. There was relief all over Jimin\u2019s face, and his eyes were shining again like they used to \u2013 like they used to before all this mess. Sometime during a dramatic fight scene and an awkward confession, Jimin had leaned back into Jungkook\u2019s chest and was half on his lap. And Jungkook honestly didn\u2019t mind, if anything, he just wanted to pull Jimin closer and nuzzle into his neck (which he refrained from doing).\n\u201cOkay, how about when we went camping?\u201d Jimin tilted his head to at least get a side view of Jungkook.\n\u201cUm\u2026 not really?\u201d Jungkook worried on his lip as he strained to think of something which he could relate to the memory but came up blank. Images of campfires and tents he was certain he had just made up in a desperate attempt to conjure something.\nJimin just smiled, his body stayed relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve made heaps of progress.\u201d\nStill, Jungkook felt a heavy rock in his stomach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, really, I\u2019m not upset.\u201d Jimin turned and when he lifted his gaze they realised just how close they were, lips inches away. Jungkook could kiss him right now if he wanted to. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, please.\u201d He gave an apologetic smile before looking guilty. \u201cAnd if anything, I should say sorry. I\u2019ve been making you feel so shitty, putting so much emphasis on having feelings for me and your memories\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJimin\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I should have just been happy that you were alive and okay. God, I\u2019ve been so terrible, all I seemed to care about was your memory and I should have been helping you deal with trauma \u2013 I acted like I was the victim and it was your fault \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t \u2013\u201d Jungkook knew what Jimin was doing \u2013 falling into that self-blame he often did, too self-criticizing for his own good.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, I did, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m awful.\u201d\nJungkook frowned as Jimin glanced at his lap, gulping and looking remorseful. Sure, he had felt like he was blamed a few times, and he\u2019d been annoyed plenty, but he\u2019d never thought of faulting Jimin for it. Jimin looked after his medication and helped him recover, and he\u2019d been there if Jungkook needed to confide in him. \u201cYou helped me a lot. Don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\nJimin scratched his cheek, shoulder slumped. \u201cI should have been stronger for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou were.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYou did your best.\u201d Jungkook interrupted. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly make it easy, I was a jerk to you.\u201d\nJimin opened his mouth to protest but Jungkook cut him off.\n\u201cThere are no hard feelings. At all.\u201d He said firmly and reached around to curl a hand around Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cLet\u2019s just move on?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor my sake. It\u2019s too hard to hold a grudge against you.\u201d\nJimin choked out a laugh, face reddening.\nJungkook smiled and Jimin ducked his head under his gaze, suddenly shy.\u00a0 He wondered just how often he was able to make Jimin blush like this, or if it was just because of their current circumstances. He wondered how many times he\u2019d been able to cuddle up with him, have Jimin\u2019s complete attention. He realised abruptly that he was so terribly fond.\n\u201cI hope I can remember everything soon.\u201d\nJimin looked away when he replied, but his hand was resting on Jungkook\u2019s knee. \u201cIt\u2019s not your amnesia that scares me the most.\u201d\nJungkook paused, confused, but the television show had started back up again and Jimin had pulled his attention away.\n\nIsn\u2019t it?\n\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t the amnesia then what was it?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt was raining. Jungkook pulled Jimin closer into his side, feeling the knots in his stomach loosen now that he had him against him. Grounding him. Sometimes, Jimin drifted \u2013 not physically, but his mind went elsewhere, Jungkook tried not to think of where because he was sure it wouldn\u2019t be nice, and it took some coaxing to get him back to him. It scared Jungkook during his small episodes because that was when Jimin felt the worst about himself, was the most likely to rush to the bathroom or push away his plate or belittle himself as he stared at his reflection.\n\n\nJungkook felt utterly helpless when it had been Hoseok to comfort Jimin the first few times it happened. Afterwards, Jimin sought affection to reassure himself. He\u2019d go to the other hyungs first. He never picked Jungkook.\n\nDoes he think I\u2019ll disregard him?\u00a0\n\nJungkook wondered if he had ever snapped at him or offhandedly thrown a teasing insult at Jimin when he needed comfort. He felt like dirt knowing he probably had. He probably hadn\u2019t realised it either.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t deserve him, and now fate was making sure he never would.\n\n\n\u201cThanks for walking back with me. Do you want to come up?\u201d Jimin asked as he started up the apartment steps, water droplets on his eyelashes. \u201cJungkook?\u201d\n\n\nJungkook swallowed and nodded. He followed Jimin up silently as they entered the complex and then into Jimin\u2019s small apartment, two suitcases near the door, all ready to leave. His whole life packed away, ready to start over without Jungkook.\n\n\nJimin\u2019s parents convinced him to move back to Busan, and although he didn\u2019t really want to, he agreed to go back for a few months and see how it was. Of course, Jungkook knew how much his parents worried about Jimin, but he was afraid Jimin would go, and never come back \u2013 maybe return only to visit, and then they inevitably become strangers. Jungkook was running out of time.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been quieter than usual.\u201d Jimin murmured as he poured himself a glass of water and stood at the counter, wide eyes imploring. \u201cYou know\u2026 even though I\u2019m not always \u2013 like \u2013 feeling the best, I\u2026 I still want to be able to talk to you.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook bit his bottom lip as he brushed damp hair off his forehead.\n\n\nJimin seemed disappointed by his silence. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel sorry for me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jungkook whispered finally, voice low and quiet. \n\n\nJimin distracted himself by pouring Jungkook a glass of water too, passing it along the counter to him and narrowly avoiding eye contact. He sighed and glanced at his own cup. \u201cYou helped me so much these past few months, Jungkook-ah. Thank you. You really did a lot for me.\u201d\n\n\nJungkook\u2019s chest ached. But he had hurt Jimin a lot too \u2013 over and over with his careless words and rejected feelings, threw his kindness back in his face. It was only when the attention stopped that Jungkook saw Jimin for who he really was \u2013 insecure, worried and wanting some sort of recognition. He wasn\u2019t stuck up or a show off, and his clinginess with Jungkook was merely a crush \u2013 what was so wrong with that? He had been pushy and yeah, on a few occasions he had gotten incredibly annoying, but Jungkook didn\u2019t have to treat it like a joke, like Jimin was just a joke.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Jungkook said, but it wasn\u2019t. He should have done more, he should have been the one Jimin could rely on. He should have confessed whilst he still had the chance.\n\n\nJimin took a deep breath, a false smile gracing his features. \u201cWell, I should go shower since I\u2019m leaving early tomorrow. At least now you won\u2019t have me irritating you anymore, right?\u201d His voice was airy and light with practiced ease.\n\n\nJungkook winced. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 don\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, relax, I\u2019m kidding.\u201d Jimin giggled but he wasn\u2019t. Of course he wasn\u2019t. He stepped away from the counter and Jungkook caught the sad lilt at the end of his voice, the way his eyes dropped and he lingered for a beat longer, hoping for Jungkook to intervene. \u201cI\u2019ll see you. Night.\u201d\n\n\nSee me when? When will you come back?\n\n\nJungkook\u2019s throat squeezed as Jimin headed for his bathroom. In less than twelve hours, Jimin would be on the first train back to Busan. He could meet someone else, someone nicer, someone who wouldn\u2019t laugh at his feelings or take them for granted. Someone far better than Jungkook could ever be. He can\u2019t lose Jimin, not before he\u2019s ever even had the chance to have him.\n\n\n\u201cJimin-hyung.\u201d\n\n\nJimin paused and glanced over his shoulder. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\nI think I might be in love with you.\n\nJungkook swallowed the lump in his throat.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nJungkook woke up blearily, tiredness still behind his eyes but he managed to roll out of bed and stumble sleepily to the bathroom. He instinctively reached for the razor and shaving cream. It wasn\u2019t something he had been consciously used to when Jimin had first introduced him to the notion that yes, he had to shave now, but it was a habit he picked back up instantly.\nAfter he finished, he went done to the kitchen where Jimin was standing at the counter, sipping on tea whilst he scrolled through something on his phone. There was some desirous feeling swirling his stomach and seeing Jimin made it grow.\nJungkook didn\u2019t think much, he never did in the first few minutes after he had woken up, and pressed his face into Jimin\u2019s freshly shampooed hair. He always smelt nice, something Jungkook really appreciated. \u201cMorning, you.\u201d\nSurprisingly, Jimin hadn\u2019t flinched when Jungkook nuzzled into him, and it was only a few seconds later that he stiffened and then let Jungkook be, ignoring his astonishment. \u201cHey. Are you hungry?\u201d\nJungkook made a sound in the back of his throat as his mouth moved down Jimin\u2019s hair to the nape of his neck. Something about Jimin in the morning was irresistible, whether it was because his cheeks were still a bit puffy or hair ruffled, or he looked adorable still in his oversized pyjama shirt with his pants pooled slightly at the ankles.\nThis time Jungkook couldn\u2019t hold back the urges that had started to become stronger and stronger, only half aware of what he was doing. The less rational side of him simply thought why not? It\u2019s Jimin, my boyfriend. Whilst the other side of him let out a small, pathetic you\u2019re not his Jungkook.\nJungkook gripped Jimin\u2019s waist and brought him to his chest, letting his lips trail across his skin. Screw it.\nJimin gasped softly and his body was tense, but not unwilling. \u201cKook-ah, what are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d Jungkook murmured low and let his teeth drag over his neck, right where he knew Jimin liked it. As expected, Jimin melted at his touch and let out a small moan, tilting his neck to give him better access.\nJungkook sucked at the spot as Jimin\u2019s breath started to become ragged and uneven. His head lolled back onto Jungkook\u2019s broad shoulder as he began to lean into his chest, eyes shut and lips parted. Jungkook\u2019s hands slipped under Jimin\u2019s shirt and felt up the smooth, heated skin, soft and covering hard muscle.\u00a0\nJimin grabbed the back of Jungkook\u2019s head and twisted around to get a better view of him, forcing Jungkook to tear his lips away from the nice red blooming on Jimin\u2019s pale skin, met with his lips instead. He moaned into the kiss as small flashbacks of other scenes like these screened behind his eyelids, but he was still in this moment. His Jimin.\nHe trapped Jimin\u2019s lips and nibbled on it slightly, and after a brief tug which earned him a long moan he slipped his tongue into Jimin\u2019s mouth, meeting his and exploring the cavern eagerly. Sometime during this Jimin had turned all the way around to kiss him better, arms wrapped around his neck and hips pushed together. Jungkook groaned when Jimin sucked his tongue and tangled his hand through his hair, pulling him down to kiss him even deeper. Jungkook trailed his palm down Jimin\u2019s back as his hand wandered further\u00a0below and under the waistband of his pants -\n\u201cJungkook, wait.\u201d Jimin whispered against his lips as he caught his breath, but he didn\u2019t step away.\nJungkook stared at him, dazed. Jimin flushed and all Jungkook could focus on were his scarlet cheeks and fluttering eyelashes. He brought his hand to rest on the small of Jimin\u2019s back, wondering if he\u2019d overstepped a boundary.\n\u201cToo far?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just\u2026 we agreed that... we shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jimin was getting ready to reject this action again, and this time, Jungkook couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cI meant that.\u201d Jungkook said with confidence that surprised himself. \u201cAnd I meant each one before.\u201d\nJimin bit his lip.\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t just write this off. Don\u2019t just make assumptions about my intentions, or think they\u2019re disingenuous just because I\u2019m not\u2026 because I\u2019m not completely him.\u201d Jungkook muttered bitterly as Jimin looked up at him with wide eyes.\nFinally, he nodded and leaned forward to peck his cheek, a small gesture that made Jungkook\u2019s chest tighten. His lips pressed softly against his cheek and his nails lightly moved across Jungkook\u2019s neck down to his collarbones, sending a nice shudder through his body. When he finished, he gave him an apologetic smile that was still downright adorable and angelic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just been afraid that I was losing you.\u201d\n\u201cAs if I\u2019d let you.\u201d Jungkook replied dumbly, awestruck at how a smile can disarm him so easily.\nJimin looked somewhat dazed himself, but eventually ended the conversation with another charming smile and saying he needed to start getting ready for work.\nJungkook let him step out of his arms and felt the absence immediately. He wasn\u2019t sure what to call this moment of realisation.\nHe felt like he should know. He felt like he had been here before.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure if these were feelings coming back or him simply developing them again.\nJungkook thought it probably didn\u2019t even matter.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cJimin looked happy today.\u201d Taehyung commented as he settled down on the couch beside Jungkook, Yoongi on the floor next to Hoseok who had finally returned from his glamorous dance tour. When he found out about Jungkook\u2019s situation he was initially sympathetic and then later burst out laughing.\n\nI chose wonderful, wonderful friends.\n\nJungkook checked his phone for the time, noting Jimin would be finishing soon. Jimin had to stay late at the dance studio so he would be late to their weekly drama night. Today, it was at Taehyung\u2019s and his apartment looked like it had been professionally decorated. It was all very sleek and elegant. Expensive taste too.\n\u201cI know how to make him happy even without all my memories, you know.\u201d Jungkook grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m not as stressed out as other Jungkook.\u201d\nThis morning he had made Jimin laugh so much he was close to tears, and then he\u2019d gone to the dance studio with sparkling smiles in his eyes and giggles still repressed.\nTaehyung pondered. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not working or going to university so \u2013\u201d\n\u201cAnd, today I managed to cook this sweet potato dish I promised him I would make him ages ago.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, you have so much time because you\u2019re \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI make him laugh all the time, I bet present-future Jungkook couldn\u2019t do that!\u201d\nYoongi coughed and raised an eyebrow, judging hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you having a competition for Jimin with yourself?\u201d\nJungkook opened and closed his mouth wordlessly.\nTaehyung and Hoseok dissolved into a fit of giggles.\n\u201cHe really can do anything.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you both.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I told her it was probably nothing but she\u2019s convinced she saw a rat or something in the change rooms so now\u2026\u201d\nJimin\u2019s voice slowly faded out as Jungkook watched Jimin move around the bedroom in his pyjamas, face bare and fresh as he complained about something Jungkook was only half listening to.\nIt wasn\u2019t Jungkook\u2019s fault, Jimin just looked so adorable. And his hair was all mussy. It was hot.\nAnd Jungkook was also kind of tired, so there was that.\nJimin walked past Jungkook, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, for the nth time but on this occasion Jungkook leaned forward and grabbed Jimin by the waist, pulling his back against his chest and propping his chin on his shoulder to nose into Jimin\u2019s lightly scented hair.\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, hyung, but I\u2019m tired so can we please go to sleep now?\u201d Jungkook rasped and Jimin shivered in his arms, cheeks painted red.\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\n\u201cYes! Finally!\u201d He leaned back into the bed and pulled the covers out. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nJimin stared at him affectionately, with a roll of his eyes. \u201cSeriously, you are obsessed with sleep. Yoongi raised you well.\u201d\nJungkook scoffed as he pulled Jimin\u2019s body to his. \u201cOnly like sleeping when you\u2019re with me.\u201d\nJimin groaned embarrassedly into the pillow. \"You're lucky you're cute.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook shifted in his seat as he pulled on his tie, donning the outfit he had chosen from weeks ago apparently, according to Jimin. He wiped his palms on his slacks, wondering why he felt so nervous.\n\u201cDo you think he got the flowers?\u201d he mumbled more to himself than anything, fingers fidgeting in his lap.\n\u201cYes, Bohyung would have made sure Jimin got them. She\u2019s very reliable. Now, just relax.\u201d Hoseok laughed as he put down the event\u2019s program.\nIt was Jimin\u2019s dance performance today \u2013 a huge deal for him and his team at the studio, and to the public in general. This particular theatre was a very exclusive place to be able to perform in, the tickets were expensive, and as expected the event had sold out.\n\u201cYou know, Jimin\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d Seokjin supplied as he took in Jungkook\u2019s pale expression.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jungkook replied, and he knew Jimin would be fine, because it was Jimin and he always puts his all into every performance. Surprisingly, Jungkook was nervous for himself. His phone buzzed and he pulled it out of his pants pocket, and frowned at the text.\n\nGood luck! \n\nJungkook blinked. It was from Jimin\u2019s mother. Why was she texting him? Maybe she meant to text Jimin instead? Deciding to not worry about it now, he crossed his arms and waited for the performance to start. There was something kind of hard in his jacket pocket that was a bit uncomfortable. Everything was irritating him now \u2013 it was too crowded, and the audience was too loud and his chair was uncomfortable and \u2013\n\u201cUm\u2026 if you really want to check that Jimin got the flowers\u2026\u201d Hoseok mumbled worriedly but he drifted off as the lights begin to dim and the conversations came to an end.\nJungkook\u2019s heart beat faster and he sat up straighter, forgetting about that uncomfortable thing in his jacket pocket that he couldn\u2019t be bothered to check.\nAs a dancer when he was younger, he was in awe of the amazing choreographies and complex steps that the performers executed so effortlessly, but it was nothing compared to when Jimin came out. He was an obvious crowd favourite, clear by the way the excitement rose and people clapped enthusiastically after he flawlessly finished a sequence of fast, complicated moves. If teenage Jimin had been good, the Jimin now was excellent.\nIt wasn\u2019t just his moves, but his expressions, the way he looked so fragile and yet so strong, like he could topple over from the sheer lightness and grace of his movements, but he wouldn\u2019t break. And the look he had in his eyes when he faced the audience was \u2013 in love.\nJungkook was in love.\nAnd then he was suddenly hit with emotion which he can only describe as a storm of reminiscence and melancholy; he just felt deprived. Like Jimin hadn\u2019t really been his, and Jungkook hadn\u2019t been here. \nHe suddenly knew why Seokjin and Namjoon\u2019s breakup had thrown him off his axis, due to much of the same reasons they had felt it was time to call it quits. They had been utterly besotted with each other much like Jungkook and Jimin were, and something so incredible, so beautiful hadn\u2019t worked out - Jungkook was terrified that it could happen to them. That he could lose Jimin one day and think that he\u2019d be better off without him.\nSo after the first interval, Jungkook rushed backstage to find Jimin, about to get prepped for his next performance, bare faced with a bottle of water in his hand. The second their eyes met, Jimin smiled widely, surprised to see him but happy nonetheless.\n\u201cHey, what are you \u2013\u201d\nJungkook cut him off with a desperate kiss, pulling Jimin close and unable to hold back, needing him. Something about his frantic actions must have alarmed Jimin because he pulled back sharply.\n\u201cKook, what\u2019s wrong? Is it the trauma?\u201d Jimin shifted back and Jungkook tried to chase his lips but he angled his head away. \u201cDo you\u2026 do you remember everything?\u201d\nHe sounded so hopeful it hurt, staring at him with earnest eyes and searching for that hint of recognition.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jungkook replied honestly, and dropped his lips to Jimin\u2019s neck to the fading mark he had made a few days ago. He didn\u2019t know what these feelings were \u2013 if they were new or supressed from the accident \u2013 he didn\u2019t know anything except that they were there with a passion.\n\u201cBut I miss you.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice came out strangled and more vulnerable than he had intended, thick and wavering on the edge of tears. \u201cI miss you so much.\u201d\nJimin cupped his face, pressing their foreheads together, ignoring the makeup artist who called his name. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d He tilted his head up for another kiss. \u201cI\u2019ve always been here.\u201d\n\nI love you.\n\nAfter the interval, Jimin\u2019s dance soared even more than usual. And Jungkook knew what was in his jacket pocket, and the meaning behind Jimin\u2019s mother\u2019s text.\nIt was the reason for why he had been so nervous earlier.\nAnd he still was quite nervous, but that could wait.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second they got home they were all over each other, and all previous hesitations they both had were gone. Jungkook finally lets his urges go, pressing Jimin back into the surface of the mattress, ravishing his lips the way he\u2019d been wanting to for a while now, relishing the sounds Jimin made.\n\u201cJimin, baby,\u201d Jungkook whispered as he threw off his jacket and tie, eyes raking up Jimin\u2019s lithe body, so pretty against the dark bed covers. \u201cYou were amazing today.\u201d\nJimin just smiled, accepting the compliment, pulling Jungkook back down so he could start unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cYou say that all the time.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re amazing all the time.\u201d\nJimin laughed as he ran his fingers over the exposed skin, pupils blown and lips red. \u201cNo more talking.\u201d\nJungkook could do that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJungkook sighed into Jimin\u2019s hair as the other pulled up the covers, fresh from their shower and enjoying each other\u2019s presence, feeling connected again.\n\u201cI really missed you too.\u201d Jimin broke their silence, cheek pressed against Jungkook\u2019s chest.\nJungkook smiled as he continued drawing circles on Jimin\u2019s bare shoulder. There was just one last thing he needed to address, something that made his stomach clench worriedly. He wasn\u2019t sure why he felt so many qualms asking this, when he should know the answer \u2013 does know the answer. It was just that things wouldn\u2019t go back to the way they were before, at least not exactly, and he could accept that. He was totally okay with that \u2013 he had his life back, he had supportive friends and had Jimin.\nThe question was whether Jimin could accept that too.\n\u201cHyung\u2026 do you love me?\u201d\nJimin froze in his hold and Jungkook\u2019s mind raced with worst case scenarios. A few tense seconds ticked by before the other raised his head to stare at him, looking stunned by his question.\n\u201cOf course, I do.\u201d\nJungkook dropped his gaze. He needed to make sure. \u201cEven if I can\u2019t ever remember everything right now?\u201d\n\u201cEven if you never can.\u201d\n\u201cAnd even if I can never be your Jungkook?\u201d\nJimin\u2019s gaze softened and he kissed the back of Jungkook\u2019s hand. \u201cYou are my Jungkook.\u201d He gave a light chuckle to himself as his voice became tight and his eyes watery. \u201cI was stupid to have kept you so distant before \u2013 you\u2019re him, and I should have seen that. I love seventeen-year-old Jungkook as much as I love twenty-two-year-old Jungkook because it\u2019s all you \u2013 and I love you.\u201d\nJungkook felt his heart squeeze and he wanted to smother Jimin with affection.\n\u201cThank you for staying with me, even when it was weird.\u201d Jimin murmured.\nJungkook grinned. \u201cEvery version of me belongs to you.\u201d He thumbed away the tear on his cheek. Seventeen, nineteen or twenty-two \u2013 falling for Jimin was inevitable, a destiny he never wanted to change. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Jimin, I\u2019d fall in love with you again and again for the rest of my life if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d\n\nI want to marry you.\n\n\u00a0\u201cYou sap.\u201d Jimin giggled through quiet tears, fighting back a sob as he pressed his mouth to Jungkook\u2019s.\nThey stayed like that for a while, slow kisses shared between tears, damp eyelashes fluttering across cheeks.\n\u201cWhat scares you the most?\u201d Jungkook asked, remembering the conversation they had had before. \u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t my amnesia.\u201d\nJimin just smiled gently and closed his eyes as he cuddled up to Jungkook. \u201cNothing anymore.\u201d\nJungkook decided to take that answer how it was. He closed his eyes after one final kiss to Jimin\u2019s hair.\nHe still had blanks in his memories, and some lingering emotional trauma, and he\u2019d have to work hard to get back into the swing of being a lawyer. He still wasn\u2019t quite sure if his feelings came back or he fell in love with Jimin again, or \u2013 and it probably was \u2013 a combination of both.\nHe just knew he loved Jimin, and he had time to figure the rest out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
