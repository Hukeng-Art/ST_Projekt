    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Kyoshi market isn\u2019t massive, but it\u2019s bustling and filled with stalls and vendors and carts. Aang might have been overwhelmed if not for Katara and her shopping list. He doesn\u2019t even really wanna be shopping, but Katara had  asked  and Aang couldn\u2019t really refuse her even if he\u2019d rather be trying to ride the elephant koi instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a good price on\u2014 Aang?\u201d Katara turns and asks when he doesn\u2019t answer.\n\u00a0\nAang\u2019s staring at a stall run by an old woman. She\u2019s selling all manner of knitted goods: socks, hats, sweaters all in shades of creamy white and light brown.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like, young man?\u201d she asks. \u201cThis is the best mink-alpaca you can buy.\u201d Aang steps forward and picks up a hat in his hands, rubs the fiber between his fingers, squeezes. His expression is unreadable and that more than anything else has Katara wary.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere did you get this?!\u201d he demands, \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow, now, don\u2019t be bossy,\u201d the woman tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. I buy every few months from a young gentleman; their floating tea shop docks at the port every so often. He\u2019s a noisy thing but his fiber supply is impeccable; spins and knits like a dream.\u201d She frowns. \u201cAre you gonna buy that hat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t buy the hat, but Katara watches how Aang\u2019s eyes don\u2019t leave her stall until they\u2019re completely out of sight. It\u2019s only then that she asks,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...That  wasn\u2019t mink-alpaca,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt was sky bison fur. I\u2019d know it anywhere. At the temples, all the monks would have to take turns to brush the bison and sometimes the nuns would knit it up. It looked and felt just like that.\u201d Pleading grey eyes lock onto her. \u201cI know we\u2019ve got places to be, but I need to find that tea shop she was talking about. If there are bison\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen there might be more Air Nomads. Katara follows his train of thought, and isn\u2019t sure she likes where it goes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAang, it\u2019s been a really long time, though. What if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t want this to be what breaks his heart again. Not after the temple.\n\u00a0\nBut she also can\u2019t tell him no.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think we need to ask that lady a few more questions about that floating tea shop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a beautiful day, the sun is shining, and Zuko has a Bad Feeling about it.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got bad feelings a lot of the time and tries to be less shouty about them than he used to be; it tends to scare customers. They\u2019ve got a solid base of people in most of the local ports that know what he\u2019s like and won\u2019t get run off but newcomers\u2026 well, if Zuko scares off too many newcomers, then it\u2019s back to more proverbs and soothing tea with Uncle.\n\u00a0\nWell, he\u2019d be lying if he said that tea hadn\u2019t grown on him, but not the quiet blends that he ends up with when Uncle thinks he needs a time out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf Zuko\u2019s going to drink leaf juice, it\u2019s going to have some flavor, damnit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u00a0\nCrap, his face. Zuko fixes his expression to a marginally less surly one and scowls at Lieutenant Jee watching him from behind the counter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d is what Zuko was going to say, except that there\u2019s suddenly a loud  thump  that reverberates through the Jasmine Dragon, and then Zuko\u2019s flying out of the shop to see who  dares  to try and fire on them\u2014\n\u00a0\nAnd stops.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a bison.\n\u00a0\nNot that it\u2019s super unusual to see a bison these days, not for him, but Zuko hasn\u2019t planned on going back to the sanctuary for a few more days, since he received the all-clear hawk from Min yesterday, but he\u2019s not used to seeing one off the island. And this one is\u2026\n\u00a0\n Different .\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s bigger, and Zuko can pick out subtle differences in the shape of the tail and the brown arrow markings down the animal\u2019s back, but it\u2019s still  definitely  a sky bison.\n\u00a0\nA sky bison that  knows how to fly , considering the saddle and the people perched atop it. A kid wearing orange and yellow slides down to approach him but Zuko walks right past him to the bison. He doesn\u2019t think twice about pulling an orange out of his pocket and offering it to the animal, using the opportunity to check its teeth and general health.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d The girl still in the saddle calls down to him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko raises an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGiving him a treat so he\u2019ll let me check his feet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy would you\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nZuko picks up one of the six large feet without hesitation and peers closely at the pads, checks between toes, pulls out a few burrs; he scowls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s dirty.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boy looks like Zuko\u2019s just dumped a bucket of water on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dirty!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s dirty,\u201d Zuko insists and runs his hands through white fur to make a point; they catch in tangles. The boy in blue barks a startled laugh like he can\u2019t help himself. \u201cWho are you, anyway? How did you find\u2014\u201c\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Spirits, Zuko,   use your brain .\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYellow and orange, bald,  blue arrow tattoos.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nZuko feels the color drain out of his face, and he stares, frozen and cold, back at the Western Air Temple and seeing all the small bodies piled up against the wall. They\u2019d been wearing yellow, too.\n\u00a0\nAir Nomad child.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can find anything!\u201d The boy brags, not noticing how Zuko\u2019s turned into a statue. \u201cI\u2019m the Avatar, after all!\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko feels like he\u2019s drowning. He can\u2019t breathe, he can\u2019t think, all he can do is\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201c Uncle !\u201d He hollers at the top of his lungs and stomps his way back into the Jasmine Dragon, past the customers, all the way to the back of the shop where he can collapse on a floor cushion and bury his face in it. \u201cPlease go outside and\u2014 and\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nAnd do something. Anything. Deal with it so Zuko doesn\u2019t have to, because he had genuinely thought that he was over this. He\u2019d given up his death mission, accepted that he could never go home. Accepted that home wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d thought it was.\n\u00a0\nAnd now here was the Avatar, right on his doorstep, and Zuko cannot handle it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nToday is not going the way that Sokka had thought it would go. He thought that this would be a quick, in-and-out, sorry-for-your-trouble kind of trip, but thanks to Aang and his need to follow every butterfly, and Katara insisting on indulging that need, here they are.\n\u00a0\nThe tall, grouchy-looking kid with his dark hair tied up, and the  nasty fucking scar had stormed away roaring for his uncle and hadn\u2019t been seen since.\n\u00a0\nThe uncle, on the other hand, is giving Sokka a  vibe .\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t look like anybody special. Short, kinda stout and portly, mellow expression, and had brewed them a hell of a tea. Sokka doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in it but he  swears  that he can taste something that reminds him of the South Pole.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSalt.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSokka jumps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were staring into your teacup as if it held the secrets to the universe. The secret is salt. Just a bit with the cloudberries.\u201d The old man speaks carefully and Sokka narrows his eyes. He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, but I recognize the look of children from the poles.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSokka takes an appreciative sip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Katara asks, leaning forward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBlue clothing, dark skin and hair. The Southern tribe, I presume? And I couldn\u2019t miss your wolftail, young man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n Nobody  recognizes Sokka\u2019s wolftail. Ever.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho was that kid?\u201d Aang asks. \u201cHe looked a little...tense?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s one way to put it.  That kid  had looked freaked out of his mind. He\u2019d come out looking ready for a fight but the minute he\u2019d put eyes on Aang, he bailed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy nephew.\u201d The uncle doesn\u2019t name his nephew. He doesn\u2019t name himself, either.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is uh, a pretty interesting place to sell tea, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMan, the Water Tribes make a proper damn boat, with wood and sails and\u2014 Sokka stills. Uncle takes a sip of his own subtly salty tea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a Fire Nation ship.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is, isn't it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...You\u2019re Fire Nation?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAang spits out some tea, and Katara looks like she\u2019s going to be sick, but Mr. Uncle looks...pleased? Or smug, Sokka can\u2019t tell. The point is that he knows immediately that he\u2019s  right . Who the hell else would have gold eyes like that? And now that Sokka\u2019s looking, most of the staff look like they could be Fire Nation too. Salty and sea-soaked, possibly military...and definitely here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re also  definitely watching how the conversation unfolds, despite the presence of customers. Customers who don\u2019t seem at all uncomfortable with the fact that this is definitely a Fire Nation ship, despite the amazing tea. Guh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne can be many things,\u201d Mr. Uncle goes on, \u201cOne can be one thing, depending on your perspective. What is your perspective, young tribesman?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a bison!\u201d Aang pipes up, ignores the slap Sokka gives to his own forehead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe that you have a bison. You received a complimentary inspection of your bison by my nephew.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSneaky old teamaker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking for  other  bison,\u201d Katara interjects like she can make this make sense, which she  can\u2019t,  \u201cWe were at the market, and there was a lady selling clothes of sky bison fur. Aang was\u2014  we  were hoping that you\u2019d know where we could find them. She mentioned your nephew and\u2026well, if there are more sky bison, maybe there are more Air Nomads too. If there are, we have to find them!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSokka\u2019s not sure what does it, but Mr. Uncle\u2019s face goes serious and sad, and for a moment all he does is stare into his teacup. Aang looks like he\u2019s going to start talking again, but Sokka digs an elbow into his side.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWait. Listen. Don\u2019t say anything you can\u2019t take back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man says, \u201cI am but a simple teamaker. Certainly, if I knew any Air Nomads, I would send you to them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd that...doesn\u2019t say he hasn\u2019t  seen  any, Sokka notices. Which, remembering what they\u2019d seen at the last temple, might be for the best.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan your nephew help us, then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGolden eyes close in an almost flinch. Not quite, but nearly, and then a hand comes down to touch his shoulder, startling all of them but Mr. Uncle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere are no more Air Nomads,\u201d Angry Nephew says quietly. He looks rumpled and stressed and he needs to retie his hair, but he\u2019s noticeably calmer than he was before. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve checked. All but...all but the Southern Temple. There are no more Air Nomads. Only bison. Sorry that we couldn\u2019t be more helpful. Good luck on your mission.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s about the most polite way that Sokka\u2019s ever been told to get the hell out, and he knows for a fact that it\u2019s way too polite to get through Aang\u2019s hard head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut are you  sure ?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Angry Nephew flinches just like Mr. Uncle. Clenches his fists. Releases.\n\u00a0\nSokka tries really, really hard not to stare at his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d he growls, \u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve checked. No nomads. Only bison. Now,  please , be on your way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNephew\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201c No ,\u201d Angry Nephew says. Sokka has got to get an actual name for the guy before that moniker sticks. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. No.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Mr. Uncle replies gently. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAngry Nephew stomps back off, and Mr. Uncle turns to them and bows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cChatting with you has been a delight,\u201d he says. And then  winks . \u201cIf I were you, I would remain wherever you\u2019re camped for another night. The sunsets around here are lovely.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s an even more polite dismissal than the first, and one that they have no excuse not to listen to. Mr. Uncle doesn\u2019t charge them for the cloudberry tea and even waves to them as they climb up on Appa.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that was a waste of time,\u201d Katara mumbles at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSokka shakes his head, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it was?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Prince Zuko.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko managed to finish his shift without yelling too much or scalding everyone\u2019s leaves, but it was a near miss. Uncle finds him facedown on top of his bed, face buried in his pillow. He feels, more than sees, Uncle sit down, the mattress shifting under him, feels a hand brush the top of his head, carding gently through his hair. It\u2019s gotten long since he\u2019d cut it that first time, when they\u2019d made the decision to decommission the  Wani . He hasn\u2019t cut it since.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to help them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nUncle\u2019s so good at finding exactly the right questions that Zuko doesn\u2019t want to think about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t help them, you know that. They\u2019re looking for  people,  and I...I can\u2019t give him that.\u201d Zuko turns his head and peers out of his self-inflicted smothering. \u201cI\u2019m the  enemy  .  Our people  did that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you are not the enemy. You didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t know how to explain that it doesn\u2019t matter, that he knows full well that he\u2019s a hundred years too late but it still doesn\u2019t matter. He still feels the shame of it that it happened at all. Uncle calls it responsibility and says that it\u2019s a good thing. Jee calls it self-flagellation, and that it\u2019s a pain in the ass. All Zuko knows is that it  sucks. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd besides, they know we\u2019re Fire Nation.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLots of people know we\u2019re Fire Nation.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, but most of those people aren\u2019t the  spirits-damned Avatar  . Who\u2019s like...ten. Fire and steel, Uncle, he\u2019s a  kid. \u201d Zuko feels sick all over again. He hasn\u2019t thought about the Avatar in almost three years, but even before he\u2019d cast the mission aside and given up on ever going home, he\u2019d pictured the Avatar to be an old man, crafty and masterful and wise. Definitely not a child.\n\u00a0\nAnd that means that, if he ever sees him again, he cannot ever tell him about the temples.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEver.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll the more reason to consider it. You may not be able to give him his people back,\u201d Uncle continues, \u201cBut maybe you could show him the island.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe island that half their crew takes care of, keeping the bison fed and in good health and making sure the new calves (new, precious, absolutely adorable calves) are being parented well. They haven\u2019t had many bottle babies, but sometimes it\u2019s still necessary, and luckily they haven\u2019t had the need in several seasons, but that\u2019s what Min\u2019s messenger hawk correspondence is for.\n\u00a0\nZuko returns to smothering himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Uncle continues, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to get a closer look at the Avatar\u2019s bison? He looked awfully healthy. Bigger than the ones at the island?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was  dirty,  and you know it,\u201d Zuko grumbles. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like he wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t think that brushes exist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen, perhaps, maybe the boy would appreciate some guidance on proper care, to keep him from getting so dirty. It\u2019s a difficult life on the road.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not cute, Uncle,\u201d Zuko grumbles. Iroh chuckles and continues to smooth down dark hair. Zuko\u2019d given up years ago on pretending that he didn\u2019t find the gesture comforting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you could even see him fly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s a thought.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor some reason, none of the wild bison fly. None of them know whether it\u2019s because they were never taught, or whether it was frightened out of them generations ago, or if...if there\u2019s something wrong with them. All the information they\u2019d been able to find had said that sky bison were the first airbenders, and everyone knew that they could fly. But Mochi couldn\u2019t fly and the newest babies, Daifuku and Karaage and Omurice, couldn\u2019t fly. Not a single bit.\n\u00a0\nMaybe if Zuko could  see  it, it would help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUgh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d been got again and the slippery old dragon knew it, too.\n\u00a0\nBut it didn\u2019t mean that Zuko was happy about it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a beautiful morning, the sun is shining, and Sokka has a Bad Feeling about it.\n\u00a0\nHe trudges out of the tent and knows exactly where his bad feeling came from, because there\u2019s Angry Nephew with a bag over his shoulder, running a wooden brush through Appa\u2019s thick, white fur.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh spirits, Mr. Uncle was  right .\u201d He doesn\u2019t speak loudly but his voice carries anyway, because Angry Nephew gives an irritable twitch and turns his way. His hair is braided up the sides and tied up in the back to get it out of his face, and he\u2019s dressed in rusty browns that border suspiciously close to red.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t call him that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Sokka tells him, \u201cOnce you give me a name for him. For you, too, because in the nature of honesty, I\u2019ve been calling you Angry Nephew in my head since the second I met you.\u201d Angry Nephew glares and pinches the bridge of his nose like that\u2019s enough to ward off the headache Sokka\u2019s giving him.\n\u00a0\nSokka knows for a fact that it won\u2019t work; he\u2019s talented like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can call me Li,\u201d he says finally, \u201cAs for Uncle\u2026\u201d he sighs, \u201cOh, whatever. Just call him Uncle. He\u2019ll love it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhich is not entirely surprising, but Sokka\u2019ll take it; he doesn\u2019t have any uncles anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, uh, Li, what exactly are you doing here?\u201d Li has to be a made up name, too. Who the hell names their kid Li?\n\u00a0\nLi shifts his bag and scowls at the sky. Maybe that\u2019s the only expression his face knows how to make? Sokka tries really hard not to look at the scar. It\u2019s  gnarly  . He also tries very hard not to think about how something like that happens to a  Fire Nation kid .\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s you!\u201d Aang bounces out of his tent, perky and annoying, and Sokka relishes in poking his thumb towards Li with a smirk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cApparently his name is Li.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s  got to be a lie. Nobody twitches like that at the sound of their own name.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Li?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anywhere you need to be immediately, and you have a few days to spare, I thought I could show you the bison.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAaaaaand there Aang goes after another butterfly. Sokka can see it all over his face, and there Katara goes after him. Fuck it, he\u2019s not fighting it. It\u2019s not like they have anything important to do or anything, like finding Aang, and his sister, a waterbending teacher. No big whoop, time to chase some butterflies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnder  one  condition,\u201d Li continues firmly. Sokka\u2019s not sure the guy has ever had any fun in his life. \u201cI want to see your bison fly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA huge smile takes over Aang\u2019s whole face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee him fly? I think we can do better than that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t know if he likes flying. It\u2019s fascinating but also slightly horrifying because how does something  that huge  manage to get off the ground? But also because for all the years that he\u2019s cared for the bison they were able to rescue from the temples, he\u2019s never seen them so much as lift off an inch. He\u2019s also  positive that the Water Tribe boy is laughing at him, practically lounging in the saddle while Zuko clings (definitely not desperately) to the sides and tries not to die.\n\u00a0\nThis is some precarious bullshit and cannot possibly be safe.\n\u00a0\nZuko  never  thought that he\u2019d miss being on a boat but here they are.\n\u00a0\nThe Avatar\u2019s sky bison is named Appa, and Zuko spends the first twenty minutes of the trip anxiously pulling out the loose fur that he can reach, twisting the tufts of white in his hands out of habit, to keep it suitable for carding and, later, spinning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy,\u201d Zuko mumbles nervously to him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t drop us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSokka is  definitely  laughing at him, but Appa  is a good boy, and doesn\u2019t drop them.\n\u00a0\nEventually the uneventful flight settles him and Zuko allows himself to relax against the back of the saddle. Aang\u2019s up front and flying, steering by way of reins on Appa\u2019s horns, which leaves Zuko with the two Water Tribe children.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, uh, Fire Nation, huh?\u201d Sokka asks to break the silence, and catches Katara\u2019s elbow in his ribs for his trouble.\n\u00a0\n\u201c Sokka  !\u201d She hisses, \u201cDon't be  rude \u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Zuko interrupts even though his face says clearly that it\u2019s not fine at all, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s the truth. But we\u2019re banished.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich means\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko shrugs, scrubs a hand across his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBanished, exiled, whatever you want to call it. I had a...disagreement with someone powerful, and I paid for it.\u201d It\u2019s an old hurt but it\u2019s still sore and soft, and Zuko tries to keep it to himself. He manages to keep his hand off his scar. \u201cI understand that you likely have a bad impression of my people, but you have nothing to fear from me and my crew. We\u2019re just trying to make a living.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that why you were selling bison fur?\u201d Aang asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to spin, and it\u2019s easy to knit. It doesn\u2019t shrink when you wash it, it resists water, and it\u2019s warm,\u201d Zuko lists off his fingers, \u201cAnd currently, I have a monopoly on the market.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t mean anything, really, because he has no intention of trying to cheat people with his prices. It\u2019s supplementary income to help the tea shop. And it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have plenty of fiber to spare. \u201cStart heading south here,\u201d he tells the airbender up front, \u201cYou'll want to go towards the island that\u2019s ringed by the reef. You can\u2019t miss it, but don\u2019t go down until I give the okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt wouldn\u2019t do for them to get shot out of the sky before he\u2019s got the chance to remind his crew that they\u2019re friendlies.\n\u00a0\nThey get within sight of the watchtowers, and Zuko wraps his hands around his mouth to carry the sound and  howls , once, twice, then waits until an answering call is heard. He nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re good to land,\u201d he says. \u201cVisitors are not, uh, common.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo say the least, he thinks, and definitely not coming from the sky. He directs Aang where to land Appa and the moment those six feet hit the ground he\u2019s the first to scramble out of the saddle and bound over to where Min\u2019s already come down from the tower.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting you for a few more days yet, sir,\u201d the man says and isn\u2019t covert about staring behind Zuko to eye their visitors. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko nods once.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Avatar,\u201d he replies shortly, \u201cAnd the Avatar\u2019s bison. They wanted to see the island.\u201d Well, Aang and Katara wanted to see the island. Sokka just made smart remarks and roasted Zuko about his flight anxiety. \u201cHow\u2019s everything here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing of note, sir,\u201d which was definitely written in Min\u2019s last missive.\n\u00a0\nZuko nods sharply and turns back towards their visitors, returns to them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bison are this way,\u201d he says, and leads them to a massive cleared field that\u2019s surrounded entirely by thick forest. In the distance, there\u2019s a large wooden stable. \u201cWe try and keep everyone together most of the time, since that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to,\u201d he tells Aang, who\u2019s staring, wide-eyed, like he\u2019s never seen anything like this in his life, \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a secondary stable across the island for anyone who needs quarantine or medical, or for any precarious bottle babies who can\u2019t be introduced back into the herd yet.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Wow  ,\u201d Aang breathes, \u201cThis is ...wow  . \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you even get them all here?\u201d Katara asks and watches Zuko perch himself easily atop the tall fence. \u201cThis cannot have been a short trip. Did you just ride on one and the rest followed?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomething shifts in Zuko\u2019s expression and he very slowly shakes his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, uh,\u201d he mumbles without making eye contact, \u201cThey can\u2019t, uh, they can\u2019t fly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAang gapes in shock.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut they\u2019re  sky bison !\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Zuko grumbles. \u201cBut they don\u2019t, and they can\u2019t. I brought you here in the hopes that Appa could help them. As to your question,\u201d he nods to Katara, \u201cIt\u2019s not as complicated as you\u2019d think. They\u2019re excellent swimmers and take a long time to tire. All we did was keep someone that they would follow on the ship and let the rest follow, while we towed a raft for when they would wear out or for the babies. Hold on.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFrom atop his spot on the fence, Zuko lets out a high whistle, and almost immediately there\u2019s a thundering from a distance and without more warning than that there\u2019s a herd of sky bison trying their level best to knock him off.  With love. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, hey, settle down,\u201d he tells Karaage, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long. Pushy monsters.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe gives in to their determined and aggressive affection, and obligingly slides down to the ground where he\u2019s better able to pat noses, scratch ears and horns, and accept slobbery kisses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re friendly,\u201d he tells Aang. The kid looks like if he doesn\u2019t get to pet any of them, he might actually die. \u201cJust don\u2019t let them step on you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEven Sokka, who\u2019s been determined all day to not enjoy himself, ends up softening under the sheer amount of wholesomeness happening here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s Udon,\u201d Zuko gestures to the bison licking Aang on the head, \u201c Yes  , Mochi, I see you. Yes, you are a good girl,  now please stop eating my hair .\u201d He scritches her ears. \u201cMochi was the first one I found. Well, I guess maybe she found me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe goes quiet and considering, rubs his hands to the skin in Mochi\u2019s thick, furry ruff.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Aang decides to open his mouth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Li, what\u2019d you do to get exiled?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko freezes.\n\u00a0\nSokka and Katara go very, very still. They don\u2019t know the landmine that just got walked on but the look on the other boy\u2019s face says that it\u2019s  bad.  And there\u2019s Aang, still innocently petting Udon as if he hadn\u2019t just asked the rudest fucking question that Zuko\u2019s ever heard in his life. He\u2019s stunned speechless for a good thirty seconds, and then suddenly but not unexpectedly he\u2019s overcome with a wave of fury so potent he nearly starts steaming where he stands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the  fuck  makes you think you\u2019re entitled to something like that?!\u201d Zuko spits and recoils back away from the bison like he\u2019s been struck, all the way to where his spine hits the fence. He slips through and keeps going, backing away so as to not  burn anyone by accident  . He very easily feels like he could, lightheaded with rage and  pain  . \u201cHow  dare  you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dI\u2014 I didn\u2019t mean\u2014,\u201d Aang stammers. Clearly he doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s misstepped, but he\u2019s not  stupid , but Zuko doesn\u2019t want to hear it.\n\u00a0\nHe says so.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it from someone who slept for a hundred years while the world fell apart,\u201d he snarls, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it from somebody who can just  fly away  from all his problems. The rest of us can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEven the ones who could fly away...didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nZuko digs his nails hard into his palms and  does not spit fire but it\u2019s a near miss. His hands twinge but it\u2019s not enough to override the pain that that single question brought on, like inviting someone to dinner and being robbed at swordpoint instead.\n\u00a0\nHe has to get out of here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Zuko turns and bolts towards the second bison stable.\n\u00a0\nAang, face pale and guilty and shocked, makes a move to go after him, but Sokka grabs his shoulder and holds.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says softly, \u201cThat\u2019s probably a really bad idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to him?\u201d Min snaps on his approach, eyeing Zuko\u2019s hasty retreat and then focusing a hard look on their visitors. \u201cSeriously?\u201d He shifts his gaze from Katara, shaken but guiltless to Sokka, frustrated and equally innocent, to Aang. \u201cHe took a huge risk bringing you here and that\u2019s what you pull?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I pulled!\u201d Aang protests, \u201cI just asked a question!\u201d He chews on his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make him mad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNext time, kid, just fucking deck him one; it\u2019ll hurt him less,\u201d Min grumbles and rubs at his forehead. \u201cUgh. What a mess.\u201d He looks up. \u201cWhat did you think he meant when he said he was exiled? That this is some fun little field trip while he waits to not be grounded anymore, like a little kid who stole cookies? This thing is  permanent , and it\u2019s not something he needs badgered about. And if he won\u2019t say it, I will: if you\u2019re going to be disrespectful, you can leave. We won\u2019t have it here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSokka doesn\u2019t say what he\u2019s thinking, which is a solid protest of  but he   is   a kid . Li can\u2019t be much older than he is, and Sokka can\u2019t imagine being told that he\u2019s not allowed to go home. He\u2019s only now realizing what that means.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean, risk?\u201d Katara asks. Min waves his hands at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. The point is that you are guests of our hospitality, and guests are polite.  He  has worked way too fucking hard to get this island to where it is, and  we  have worked way too fucking hard on keeping that kid off a ledge, and  none of us  will see him messed with.\u201d That was outright threatening and Sokka swallows hard. Where the hell did these guys even come from? Sure as hell are  not  friendly neighborhood Fire Nation civilians.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMin\u2019s eyes are sharp, and he gives a tight smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust be happy that I\u2019m not Teruko,\u201d he says, like that means anything, but all of them are suddenly grateful that whoever this Teruko is, she\u2019s not here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I...can I go say sorry?\u201d Aang asks in a small voice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMin sighs, rubs his temples, lets out a deep exhale. Softens.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLater,\u201d he says finally. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be ready to hear it yet. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t find somebody to groom your dirty bison.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAppa\u2019s  not dirty !\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t want to go back out and see them again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe knows that it\u2019s shameful and childish to still be here nursing his injured pride (and heart, always his fucking  heart , every time) but he can\u2019t make himself go back out and pretend to be normal. How can he, when all he wants to do is scream at the top of his lungs and burn something to the ground?\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not safe around anybody when he gets like this.\n\u00a0\nUncle always says (and  Mom  always said, and that makes everything so much worse) that it\u2019s okay to be angry and feel whatever he needed to feel, as long as he knew when to walk away before he hurt someone who didn\u2018t deserve it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo he walked away, but he still hurts.\n\u00a0\nZuko slumps forward and buries his face in soft, white baby bison fur. Omurice is the littlest calf on the island, and still spends most of her time with her mother, but it\u2019s important that they get acclimated to being handled gently and often before they get too big. She doesn\u2019t protest to this in the slightest, leaning into where his fingers are determined to find all her good itchy spots and occasionally slipping her bits of rolled oats and diced potato-choke.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s embarrassed at his outburst. Uncle would have been able to get his point across without  shouting  all the time. Uncle would have been able to take the hit without flying off the handle.\n\u00a0\nUncle\u2019s not here, and Zuko is a poor fucking substitute.\n\u00a0\nHe hears footsteps behind him, suddenly, and can\u2019t lift his head to see who it is. He doesn\u2019t want to know and he doesn\u2019t want anyone to see him like this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u00a0\n...Shit. Okay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou trust too easily,\u201d Zuko says without looking away from Omurice. She lips at his hands and rumbles at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me, or Uncle, or\u2014 or anything. For all you know, I could be a murderer, or I could be working for the Fire Lord, and here you are falling right into my hands. Have you even  thought about that? Are you stupid?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Katara pipes up, \u201cYou\u2019d have to be a  really  good actor if that was the game you\u2019re playing. So detailed, even organizing a bison sanctuary  just  to sell your diabolical plan? That\u2019s some real dedication.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko can hear the smile in her voice without even seeing her, and he snaps his head up to glare at her, just in time to see Aang drop to a perfect 90\u00b0 bow, hands properly but awkwardly shaping the flame.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m  so sorry,\u201d the boy trips over himself to apologize, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude or make you mad. Sometimes I just...say stuff and I don\u2019t think about it. Monk Gyatso always said that I was good at finding the perfect thing that didn\u2019t want to be poked. I guess he was right. I\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Avatar is not only contrite but  sincere  . Zuko has heard a lot of false apologies in his life (Azula. Zhao. The vendors in the markets who pretend not to have wares to sell to him and his crew because of what\u2019s written constantly on his  face  . His  father,  right before he puts Zuko on the ground, because if Zuko were  better  he wouldn\u2019t need quite so much correction) but not a lot of real ones, and he\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s expected to do with it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2026thank you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMin hides a laugh behind a cough and a grin behind his hand; Zuko glares at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to  thank me ,\u201d Aang says, frowning like Zuko\u2019s said the wrong thing, as usual. \u201cAll you have to do is accept it or not. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\u00a0\n...That is not Zuko\u2019s experience of how apologies work, but okay.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...I accept,\u201d he mumbles eventually, tries to soothe his own nervous hands, right before he\u2019s tackled by the Avatar in a tight, unexpected hug. He definitely doesn\u2019t squeak in surprise, and he definitely doesn\u2019t enjoy it. Hugs are only normal when they come from  Uncle , otherwise they\u2019re weird as hell. Zuko very, very awkwardly pats Aang on the back and extracts himself out of his grip, scrubbing his hands through his hair and looking pointedly anywhere else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf it makes you feel validated,\u201d Sokka tells him, \u201cMin got Teruko to take a brush to Appa, and she might still be shouting about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI  told you he was dirty.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dirty!\u201d Aang protests, \u201cHe\u2019s...vintage! That\u2019s a thing, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko stares. Sokka stares. Katara stares. Min doubles over on himself and laughs until he cries.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAppa is so happy to socialize with other bison that Aang stands by the fence and openly sobs a little. He\u2019s such a good boy and so gentle with the baby calves, grooming them with soft licks and nudges, rubbing up on all the members of the herd that greet him, which is all of them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt first, they seem almost afraid of him, like they know somehow that he\u2019s different from them, but it\u2019s not long before they\u2019re communing and rumbling around, just like the bison at the temples used to. For a moment, Aang feels almost like he could be home, except that home had Monk Gyatso and the other kids and fruit pies and the island has Sokka and Katara and Li. Not substitutes, he thinks, but still good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLi\u2019s watching their interactions too. He\u2019d been tense at first, like he hadn\u2019t been sure that they\u2019d get along, but relaxed quickly upon the realization that this was a peaceful meeting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think that Appa can teach them?\u201d He asks. Aang furrows his brows and mulls it over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe? Bison get taught to fly and bend the air by their moms when they\u2019re little,\u201d he says, \u201cI know Appa\u2019s not their mom, but he still might be able to.\u201d Aang waves to Appa, big and wide. \u201cHey Appa! Yip-yip!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith an obliging rumble, Appa lifts himself off the ground with a rustle of wind and a gentle slap of his massive paddle tail. The other bison stare, unmoving, like statues. Appa floats over to Mochi, nuzzles her on the ear, and grumbles in her direction. He moves his legs like he\u2019s about to start swimming.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Mochi slaps her tail harder than necessary and floats, just the tiniest bit, off the ground.\n\u00a0\nAang\u2019s so happy he bursts into immediate, startled tears, and Li\u2026\n\u00a0\nLi rubs furiously at his eyes and complains about dust making his throat hurt and his eyes water, because it\u2019s  definitely dust and not tears making it hard for him to breathe.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo one calls him out on it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Zuko has in him when Aang and the others drop him back off at the Jasmine Dragon is a gruff goodbye, and he steadfastly doesn\u2019t watch the bison slowly turn into a little white dot against the sky before disappearing entirely. He sits on the deck and lets himself breathe, letting the rocking of the waves and the ritual noises of the night watch soothe him into something like calm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you have fun, Prince Zuko?\u201d\n\u00a0\nZuko doesn\u2019t even open his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep calling me that,\u201d he points out. \u201cJust Zuko, or nephew is fine. I\u2019m a pretty sad excuse for a prince these days.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUncle settles himself down next to him, and tilts his head up to watch the stars.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he replies. Zuko really doesn\u2019t have to open his eyes to know that Uncle is grinning at him. \u201cI think that being brave, and forthright, and doing the right things even when they\u2019re not the easy things are all things that good princes should aspire to be. The strongest dragon\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cAllows trespassers, for he does not fear them,\u201d Zuko finishes and opens his eyes solely to roll them. \u201cYou and your proverbs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019ll go to the grave before he admits it, but he kind of  likes  Uncle\u2019s proverbs. Not because they in any way make sense, and they\u2019re annoying as hell, but they\u2019re  Uncle . Annoying but in a good way, just like the man himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe groomed the Avatar\u2019s bison,\u201d he says absently. \u201cGot about four bags worth. Teruko said she was going to start the carding process as soon as it was done washing, spin it, and send it over.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do with it?\u201d Uncle asks, genuinely curious. Zuko\u2019s not an amazing spinner, but he\u2019s as proficient in the processing as anyone else involved should be expected to be. He\u2019s way better at using the fiber once it\u2019s been spun, primarily because he has no idea how to relax and constantly needs something to do with his hands. Knitting has been an unexpectedly good outlet for him.\n\u00a0\nZuko shrugs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho knows? I\u2019m not sure how much of a market there is on\u2014\u201c and here he snorts conspiratorially, delighting in the joke, \u201cDirty bison fur.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t tell the Avatar that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t; it\u2019s  definitely  the best mink-alpaca money can buy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUncle Iroh laughs and laughs and laughs, and Zuko lets the edges of his lips tilt up in a quiet, secretive smile, pleased with himself. They sit on the deck together underneath the stars, listening to the soft little crashes of water against the side of the boat and the constant whirring of machinery, until the moon rises high above them, and Zuko allows himself to be shuffled off to bed.\n\n\n\n\n"
