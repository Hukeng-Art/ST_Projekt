    "text": "Ladybug is sitting right behind him.  Marinette is sitting right behind him.\nPart of Adrien wants to turn around and announce to her \u201cI\u2019m Chat Noir!\u201d and part of him wants to keep playing this game with her. Not that she knows it\u2019s a game yet.\nIt\u2019s been a week, and she  hasn\u2019t  noticed. How hasn\u2019t she noticed?\nIf he\u2019s being fair, he\u2019s not sure how he didn\u2019t notice either. From her hair to her eyes to her voice, it should be obvious to anyone. Plagg had said it was part of the magic, and it was just weaker for him because he was used to being around miraculous. Or something like that. Adrien hadn\u2019t exactly been paying attention. He might have been thinking about Marinette\u2019s laugh.\nAdrien spins around in his seat when class ends. Marinette blinks at him in surprise. He\u2019d always wanted to know the classmate who could barely get a sentence out around him. She was so passionate and expressive around other people and everyone seemed to like her. He\u2019d been worried that she was scared of him.\nIf he hadn\u2019t noticed her crush, it was actually a miracle that he\u2019d figured out she was Ladybug.\n\u201cHey, Mari,\u201d he says, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cHave you finished the essay yet?\u201d\nShe scrunches up her nose as she closes her notebooks. \u201cI\u2019ve only got the first page written. But I might try to finish it tonight so I can just forget about it.\u201d\nAlya snorts. \u201cYeah right.\u201d\nMarinette elbows her. \u201cHey! I want a free weekend. I do not want to spend all Sunday night writing about  flower symbolism .\u201d\n\u201cGross,\u201d Nino says. \u201cThat\u2019s gross, dude.\u201d\nMarinette looks up from her backpack. She meets his eyes, and her eyes are such a gorgeous blue. Not that that\u2019s what he\u2019s focused on right now. They\u2019re having a conversation. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs your essay done yet?\u201d\nNino starts laughing and Adrien swats him away. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d he says. \u201cPhotoshoots and other homework and my dad getting home and everything. I\u2019ll do it tonight.\u201d\n\u201cNo way, man.\u201d Nino stands up. \u201cVideo games, tonight, six pm. I\u2019m challenging you and you better be online.\u201d\nAdrien shrugs. \u201cOkay, maybe I won\u2019t be doing the entire essay tonight.\u201d He smiles at Marinette. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely smarter than me.\u201d\nShe blushes a little. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\nAlya shakes her head and pulls Marinette to her feet. \u201cKeep telling yourself that. It\u2019s not going to stop being a lie.\u201d\nShe starts to protest, but Adrien agrees with Alya. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the smartest people I know, Marinette.\u201d\nHer smile is enough to keep him light on his toes for the rest of the day.\nMarinette is floating on clouds. If Cloud Nine is a legit thing then she is there.\nShe\u2019s not entirely sure what caused the change in her and Adrien\u2019s relationship, not that she\u2019s complaining. Sure, they\u2019d been getting closer. He\u2019d been over to play video games (and eat pastries) a few more times and she\u2019d been slowly dismantling her idealized image of him, but in her mind they were only tentative friends. They had exchanged numbers but didn\u2019t really text. They hung out in a group but not often by themselves. They would say hi to each other each morning, and most of the time that seemed to be the extent of the conversation.\nBut now. Now! Now Adrien actively seeks her out. He talks to her and  keeps talking to her. He had listened to her ramble about a problem she was having with one of her fabrics and not only paid attention, but gave her advice. He showed up a few times at the bakery just to say hi and grab something to eat. He texts her. He texts her for no reason at all.\nShe is on Cloud Nine, and that means at some point she is going to fall again, hard, but she can\u2019t really find it in herself to mind.\nSabine lets Adrien in with a smile, immediately handing him a plate of snacks. \u201cGo on up, she\u2019s just working on a project. Make sure she eats?\u201d\n\u201cSure thing, Sabine,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nThere\u2019s something so homey and comforting about the Dupain-Cheng home that makes him never want to leave. Something in the bright colors and smell of food cooking. In the smiles, the conversations, the laughter. The way Marinette\u2019s parents insist on him calling them by their first names, how they always seemed willing to listen, even though he\u2019s just some boy that their daughter is only now becoming friends with. How they trust him in their daughter\u2019s  room . Not that Adrien would ever do anything, but if movies and books were anything to go by, that was not something that usually happened.\nIt makes going back to his actual home like going from a warm and comfortable room to jumping into ice water.\nHe knocks on her trap door. \u201cMari?\u201d He imagines her kwami going into hiding as Marinette tries to make it look like she\u2019s the only one in her room. Or maybe not, maybe it\u2019s just Plagg who makes messes.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d she yells back.\nAdrien pushes the trapdoor open.\nMarinette is sitting at her desk, surrounded by fabrics. She pushes them away and smiles at him. \u201cHey, Adrien.\u201d\n\u201cHey there, princess,\u201d he says with a wink. He holds out the plate. \u201cYour mom wanted me to make sure you don\u2019t work yourself to death.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t react to the nickname or the wink, just rolls her eyes and says \u201cShe\u2019s overreacting\u201d as she takes the plate and puts it down on her desk. If it had been that easy, she would\u2019ve noticed the day he found out.\n\u201cSo what are you working on today?\u201d Adrien asks.\n\u201cPants,\u201d she says. She sticks out her tongue as she holds the fabric up to the light. She hmphs as the fabric slips.\nAdrien can\u2019t stop himself from smiling. It\u2019s little things like this that make his stomach flip.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nMarinette hopes he doesn\u2019t notice her slight falter when he calls her princess. When did he start calling her that?\nAdrien knows he\u2019s going to reach a point where he\u2019s just going to walk up to her and shout, \u201cI\u2019m Chat Noir and you\u2019re Ladybug and we are so oblivious!\u201d Plagg is sort of against the idea. He says that he should let Marinette figure it out for herself. But there\u2019s only so many hints that Adrien can drop.\nIt\u2019s a quiet night.\nLadybug loves these nights, when nothing is happening and she can just watch the world sparkle in the darkness. It\u2019s nice to have a patrol where she can just sit on a roof with Chat and enjoy his company.\nAnd lately, she\u2019s found that she truly does enjoy it. Some of her best nights are spent sitting on a rooftop with Chat, letting the conversation between them ebb and flow. He has a natural humor to him, which yes, includes puns, and a warm and inviting personality. Their conversations are intimate even though they only ever vaguely discuss their lives, and each night she\u2019s reminded of how she can trust Chat Noir with her life.\nLadybug watches the lights in the house across the street flick off.\nChat swears suddenly.\nShe blinks in surprise. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe literature homework,\u201d he says. \u201cI completely forgot about it!\u201d\nLadybug knows the feeling. There have been countless times where she\u2019s gotten too caught up in an idea or an akuma attack or just being Ladybug and didn\u2019t do her homework. \u201cDo you have time to do it when you get home?\u201d\nHe shrugs. \u201cWho knows. It\u2019s Shakespeare and there are questions I\u2019m supposed to answer, so it\u2019ll take longer than I\u2019d like. I mean, I love the Bard, but man he is wordy.\u201d He runs his hands through his hair, making his already messy look stand out at every angle.\n\nStrange, they were doing Shakespeare in school too. \u201cWhich play?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d Chat rubs the back of his neck. \u201cAny chance you know what the significance of the changeling boy is?\u201d\nShe stares at him for a moment. \u201c\u2026Actually, I think I do.\u201d\n Weird that our curriculum lines up like that,  she thinks.\nAdrien decides to go an even more direct route. Apparently, using nicknames and exact questions from their homework wasn\u2019t enough\u2014 although he really hadn\u2019t done the homework so at least he got something out of it.\nHe drops onto the roof next to Ladybug. \u201cHow are you tonight, Bugaboo?\u201d\nShe smiles and glances out to the Paris skyline. The city\u2019s lights make her eyes sparkle. \u201cI got to sleep all weekend. I haven\u2019t been this rested in months.\u201d\n\u201cRelatable,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that Ms. Mendeleiev was out today. I didn\u2019t really want to do anything in physics, and that means I have hours less homework than usual. Maybe I can actually get more than two hours of sleep tonight.\u201d\nLadybug nods. \u201cYeah that was definitely\u2014 Wait.\u201d She freezes. \u201cSay that name again.\u201d\n\u201cMs. Mendeleiv?\u201d Chat asks slowly. This is good. This is progress.\nShe takes a few slow breaths. \u201cShe teaches physics?\u201d\n\u201cWell, math and science, but physics is kind of her  thing .\u201d He debates whether or not he should say that it\u2019s also his thing or if that\u2019s too obvious. Although maybe he wants too obvious.\n\u201cDo\u2026do we go to the same school?\u201d she asks cautiously.\nChat stops himself from celebrating. Celebrating always waits until everything has been finished, and they\u2019re only part of the way there. But it\u2019s a good thing that she\u2019s asking this question and not just pretending that it didn\u2019t happen, right? \u201cI go to Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7oise Dupont.\u201d\nLadybug nods. \u201cRight,\u201d she says, her voice distant.\nHe wonders if she has any idea who he is yet.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nChat Noir has been in the same building as her this entire time?!\nHas she spoken to him? Have they been in the same classes? Are they friends? Does he know  who she is?! She needs a minute to process this. Or maybe a few days. Or a week. The rest of her life?\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nLadybug left shortly after her epiphany.\nAdrien can\u2019t blame her, even as he sneaks back into his room and faceplants onto his bed. \u201cYou sure I can\u2019t just tell her, Plagg?\u201d he mumbles into his pillow.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll build trust between you,\u201d Plagg says.\n\u201cYeah sure. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be thrilled that I kept the fact that I knew her secret identity from her for weeks.\u201d He rolls over. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just doing this to torment me.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just being overdramatic.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a week, and Marinette has decided to outright ignore the fact that her and Chat go to the same school. If she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll start questioning every single person in the building. And she really doesn\u2019t need that.\nBut maybe she\u2019s been overly focused on the fact that she doesn\u2019t actually know what color Chat\u2019s eyes are. That has never bothered her until now. His bright green eyes made him  him , they were distinguishing and playful and filled with life\u2026 What does he look like without such a drawing feature?\nShe\u2019s pushing away the idea that maybe that boy over there is Chat Noir because he definitely isn\u2019t standing right when she bumps into Adrien. Her stutter returns for half a second out of surprise. \u201cA-adrien! Sorry, I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, his gaze sliding off her. He\u2019s distracted.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d she asks hesitantly.\nAdrien blinks. \u201cYeah, of course. No harm done.\u201d He smiles, but it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. She hates how so few of his smiles do.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about me knocking into you,\u201d Marinette points out.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as being fine right now.\u201d\nHe stares at her for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he promises. \u201cThanks though, Mari. For caring.\u201d\nHer heart melts a little bit. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. She wants to shout that people are supposed to care. People are supposed to be worried about you and are supposed to love you and are supposed to want you to be okay! \u201cOf course,\u201d she says instead. \u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d\nThe word friends is bittersweet on her tongue.\nAdrien\u2019s been hoping that she\u2019ll bring it up. Or that hint at it. Or something.\nBut he understands that she needs time to process the idea that they likely know each other out of costume. He wants to give her the time to adjust that he\u2019d hadn\u2019t had. He\u2019d had the realization and then had been thrown into a party, forced to socialize and act normal for hours. When he\u2019d gotten home, he\u2019d sat down on his bed and stared at the wall.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Plagg had asked.\n\u201cMarinette is Ladybug,\u201d Adrien said after a minute.\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Plagg muttered. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d\n\u201cWeird.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be thrilled to hear that.\u201d\nAdrien had shaken his head. \u201cI\u2019m just getting used to the idea, Plagg. It\u2019s weird, but it also feels\u2026 It feels right.\u201d\n\u201cIt solves your girl problem,\u201d Plagg pointed out.\nAdrien had smiled and fallen backwards onto his back. \u201cYeah it does,\u201d he said. In his mind, Ladybug and Marinette\u2019s smiles became one.\nHe smiles to Marinette when she passes his desk to her seat. He can see the hint of Ladybug in the smile she returns.\n\u201cYou\u2019re happy tonight,\u201d Ladybug says to Chat.\nThere\u2019s something about him that\u2019s different tonight. More bounce in his step, an extra sparkle in his eye. She shoves away the part of herself that wonders how she can make him feel this way.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this girl,\u201d he says, swinging his legs over the edge of the roof.\n\u201cOh really?\u201d she teases. She tries to keep her voice light. He\u2019s never mentioned anyone before.\nChat smiles. It\u2019s one of his rare real smiles that reach his eyes and make the corners of them crinkle, except for this time his eyes are soft and yearning. \u201cShe\u2019s smart, and, and fun, and\u2026\u201d\nLadybug stifles a laugh. Count on Chat to make her laugh when she feels petty waves of jealousy growing inside her. \u201cPretty?\u201d\n\u201cBeautiful! She\u2019s got these eyes that just\u2014 And this hair! Wow! And her smile!\u201d He leans back on his hands, sighing dramatically.\n\u201cAmi. C\u2019est l\u2019amour,\u201d she says dutifully.\n\u201cBut she\u2019s the princess! To even have a chance, I\u2019d have to be a prince!\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got no genie to help me out in that corner.\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes. \u201cFinished, Al?\u201d\nChat laughs. \u201cMy Lady, when your own words fail you, quote someone else. She\u2019s just\u2026 Her laugh, Ladybug. I want to make her laugh everyday.\u201d\nHer stomach twists. \u201cYou really like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d she whispers.\nHe sighs. \u201cCan I be cliche?\u201d\nThe words are tight in her throat. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nHis smile is soft again. \u201cTo the moon and back.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Chat,\u201d she manages. \u201cYou deserve someone who makes you feel this way.\u201d\nHe looks at her for a long moment, and she wishes she could read him instead of just getting lost in green eyes. He turns away, letting his shoulders slump. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know I like her.\u201d\nLadybug frowns, and stubbornly ignores the hope that ignites in her because Chat is her friend and partner and she wants him to be happy. \u201cHow can she not?\u201d\nChat\u2019s smile is sad. She wants to wipe it from his face and never see it again. \u201cChat Noir and my civilian identity are pretty different people.\u201d\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t flirt with her?\u201d\nHe shakes his head. \u201cNot nearly as blatantly as I do with you, My Lady\u201d\nShe takes that and holds onto it tightly. A little part of Chat that is reserved only for her.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nIf he tells anyone he\u2019s in love, they\u2019ll just tell him he\u2019s too young. Look at Romeo and Juliet, they\u2019ll say. That\u2019s what they say to others. You don\u2019t actually know what love is, it\u2019s just lust.\nAdrien\u2019s argument is this: does anyone know what love really is? Can anyone really tell if love is true or not? And if someone makes him happy, does it really matter all that much?\nHe\u2019d fallen in love with Ladybug. The superhero who had stolen his heart the first time she caught him. He\u2019d fallen face first, hurtling toward the pavement, knowing she\u2019d reject him but loving her anyway. She was perfect. She was everything. She was idolized. Until she started revealing more of herself around him and he realized that he was wrong to do that. He didn\u2019t really know her. She was more than his idea of her in his mind, she was a person. He devoted himself to learning the real Ladybug, the one behind the mask, the human with flaws and mistakes who he still loved with all his heart.\nIf he dove into love with Ladybug, he hesitantly tested the waters with Marinette. He went in one step at a time, learning the patterns of her freckles and the way she giggles and how her eyebrows furrow when she\u2019s frustrated with a design. It was slow, it was difficult, and he hadn\u2019t even noticed until he was halfway in. The process of becoming friends had taken the longest, it was an hours long trip just to get to the water. And after all that, falling in love with her just took a little more time.\nFinding out that Ladybug and Marinette are one in the same changes everything and nothing. Adrien didn\u2019t know it was possible to love someone enough for two people, but he did nonetheless. If anything, finding out just assured him that he really does love her.\nYes, he loves the Ladybug parts of Marinette. But he also loves the parts of Marinette in Ladybug. He loves  her , as a whole, as one person. He loves how hard she sometimes has to fight to keep her temper, how she stands up for others, how much she genuinely cares. He loves when she\u2019s clumsy and when she\u2019s tumbling over Paris\u2019 rooftops. He\u2019s in love with this wild and wonderful and daring and loving girl who\u2019s taken him out of an empty house and shown him the entire world.\nShe\u2019s shown him the world. She\u2019s shown him every side of herself. Now, he wants to show her.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nMarinette isn\u2019t sure how she gets back to her room. Her legs feel week, her mind feels tired, and for some reason, she really wants to cry.\n\u201cTikki?\u201d she asks, leaning against the wall. \u201cDo you think Chat ever really loved me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Marinette,\u201d Tikki sighs, landing on her shoulder. \u201cThe silly cat is head over heals for you.\u201d\nMarinette covers her face with her hands. \u201cI thought he flirted with everyone, that he told everyone that he loved them. I never thought it could be  real .\u201d\n\u201cMari, it\u2019s not your fault for not noticing,\u201d Tikki says gently.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not that!\u201d She sinks to the floor. \u201cI was just too busy with Adrien to notice. And now\u2026 I\u2019ve fallen in love with the cat just as he\u2019s fallen out of love with me.\u201d\nTikki let\u2019s her wallow for a few minutes before saying, \u201cYou should talk to Chat about this.\u201d\nMarinette lifts her head. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else, Tikki. Didn\u2019t you hear? She makes him happy, I couldn\u2019t do that to him.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBesides, what am I going to say to him? I might be a little in love with you, but I\u2019m also in love with one of my friends? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d\n\u201cYou can be in love with more than one person,\u201d Tikki reminds her.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Marinette tugs the ribbons out of her hair. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019d never work! Chat isn\u2019t in love with Marinette, he\u2019s in love with Ladybug. This perfect, idealized, incredible version of me that doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d She throws the ribbons across the room. They flutter to the floor in an unsatisfying way.\n\u201cOf course she exists,\u201d Tikkis says sharpy. It\u2019s the harshest Marinette\u2019s ever heard the tiny kwami. \u201cMarinette, you\u2019re Ladybug, with or without the mask. That doesn\u2019t change just because you aren\u2019t transformed. Everything Ladybug is, minus her powers, is all you.\u201d\nMarinette shakes her head and rests her chin on her knees. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me, Tikki. Not really.\u201d\nAdrien is getting sick of waiting. He\u2019s sure there\u2019s some part of Marinette that knows the truth, he\u2019s just not reaching it. And Plagg is still being difficult.\nOf course, Plagg wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him if he just walked up to her and revealed himself. But the longer he waits, the more nervous he becomes. What if she\u2019s disappointed? What if she no longer likes him because he\u2019s Chat? What if this ruins everything?\n\nHe tells himself that he\u2019s overthinking everything, but the voices in his head are hard to ignore. So he just smiles at her and flirts slightly less subtly.\nWhen she figures out, he hopes she\u2019ll somehow let him know.\nAdrien is spinning around in her desk chair. He has a pen between his lips and is frowning in a way that makes Marinette\u2019s heart flutter. After the other day, she\u2019s more than a little relieved that it still flutters in the same way.\nThey\u2019re supposed to be working on a project, but during a break Adrien had gotten caught up in a puzzle Nino sent him and Marinette had a strike of inspiration. She tears her gaze away from Adrien and goes back to her sketch.\nShe makes some adjustments to the sleeves and detailings on the shirt. She\u2019s been saving up money for a while, she might have enough to get all the materials she needs. Maybe she can get some really nice fabric for the skirt. She starts daydreaming about fabrics and patterns as she works on the hem.\nMarinette isn\u2019t exactly sure how much time has passed before she feels Adrien\u2019s eyes on her, she just knows she\u2019s done three more sketches of the skirt and is starting to settle on a final design. She can feel herself blushing as she looks up to meet his gaze, mumbling, \u201cSorry.\u201d She\u2019s struck by how green his eyes are. She\u2019s spent hours staring at pictures of them, but the fact that there seems to have been almost no color editing done on them still surprises her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d At some point, he\u2019d spun around in the chair and is now resting his arms on the back of it. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re concentrating.\u201d\nMarinette blinks a few time, her blush deepening. \u201cOh.\u201d\nAdrien reaches forward and tucks a strand of hair behind her ear.\nShe tenses as he turns bright red.\n\u201cOh, sorry sorry I just\u2014!\u201d He laughs breathlessly. \u201cYour hair\u2014 Sorry sorry!\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s okay!\u201d she says quickly. She wonders how similar the shades of their blushes are. By how hot her face feels, she\u2019s guessing pretty close.\n\u201cNo, really, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He gives her what she\u2019s sure is supposed to be an apologetic look, but it comes out just looking worried.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be,\u201d Marinette promises. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, really.\u201d\nAdrien looks down at the floor. \u201cSo um, I think I have an idea for the presentation, although it might take a little bit more work.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s grateful for the abrupt change of subject. \u201cI bet we can handle it. What is it?\u201d\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nThere\u2019s something surreal about watching Marinette when she\u2019s in her zone. When she\u2019s concentrating her hardest but completely at ease. There\u2019s something loving and caring in her look, even when she\u2019s frustrated. She loves fashion and design so much, Adrien wonders how Chlo\u00e9 could ever tell her she wasn\u2019t an actual designer. The way her eyes light up when she\u2019s talking about an idea, how she bites her lip with she\u2019s hand sewing, her gasps of happiness when something is finally working out right.\nSomething about watching her doing something she loved so much made him undeniably happy. Of course, that meant he had to lose himself and do something like brush her hair back.\nStill, what Adrien wouldn\u2019t give to see Marinette like she is when she\u2019s working on a design every second of every day.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\n\u201cSorry I wasted so much of your time,\u201d Marinette says as Adrien packs up his things.\nHe frowns as he pulls his bag on. \u201cWasted my time?\u201d\nShe chews on her lip. \u201cWhen I was designing and you were doing nothing? We could\u2019ve gotten a lot more done.\u201d\nAdrien laughs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t waste my time, Mari. We were taking a break. Besides, I like watching you design.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d she asks in surprise.\nHis smile is so, so familiar. But she can\u2019t place it, because it\u2019s making her heart melt. \u201cYeah! I love hanging out with you, it\u2019s a lot of fun. I actually just like being around you in general. We should hang out together more often.\u201d\n\nMarinette nods. \u201cYeah we\u2014\u201d His words process. She runs them through her mind a few times. Then she runs everything that had happened through her head. \u201cWait, did you just flirt with me?\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s smile widens. \u201cHave been for the past few weeks but thanks for noticing.\u201d\nShe laughs nervously, blushing creeping into her cheeks. \u201cRight. Yup. Uh, why are you flirting with me?\u201d\n\nHe raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d he asks with a slight smirk.\nHer breath catches in her throat. \u201cI- I, uh, don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nAdrien is going to scream.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nHis smile softens again. He touches her arm as he turns to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, princess.\u201d\nMarinette waves goodbye in a daze.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill that girl,\u201d Plagg says as soon as they\u2019re alone.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nMarinette stands in the middle of the room, frozen in place.\nTikki floats in front of her face. \u201cMari?\u201d She waves her arms.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nAdrien buries his face in his hands. \u201cShe\u2019s so cute,\u201d he whispers.\nPlagg makes a gagging noise.\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nMarinette.exe has stopped working.\nAdrien is tired. He\u2019s tired of school, he\u2019s tired of modeling, he\u2019s tired of hiding, and he\u2019s tired of unreasonably long photoshoots. He wonders if there\u2019s any possible way that they can just use pictures of him while he\u2019s asleep, because he won\u2019t be standing for much longer.\nSchool plus fencing plus piano plus basketball plus Chinese plus modeling plus  saving Paris  plus general stress takes its toll. And he needs to pay up sometime soon, because his body is ready to give out. He\u2019s not asking for much, just a solid seven hours to sleep. At least.\nHe\u2019s tired of not knowing if Marinette knows. Before, he\u2019d been impatient and anxious. Now he just wants to wrap her up in a hug and say \u201cI love you so so much and I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t love me back, just let me love you and I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t get some rest soon, there\u2019s a very high possibility of him doing that. Exhaustion takes away his better judgement.\nHe pushes a plate of cheese towards Plagg as he stumbles into bed. His homework isn\u2019t completely done yet, the shoot ran late, and it\u2019s after two in the morning. He has another shoot in the morning before school. A little later in the morning, that is.\nAdrien always looks forward to patrol. He can just relax and be himself with Ladybug for a long period of time, usually with minimal akumas and fighting involved. But this week, this week patrol is all that\u2019s keeping him on his feet.\nHis schedule is stuffed with photoshoots and rehearsals and runways and meetings with his father and lessons. To know that he has this time to just forget about all of that and run across the rooftops is liberating. It lifts a weight from his shoulders and keeps his chin above water. The fact that Ladybug will be with him makes him float.\n\u201cLove is gross,\u201d Plagg says.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Adrien mumbles.\nPlagg is quiet for a few minutes as he eats his cheese. Adrien begins to drift off to sleep.\n\u201cAs much trouble as she\u2019s given you,\u201d Plagg says, \u201cI\u2019m glad you have her.\u201d\nAdrien smiles. \u201cSo am I.\u201d\nFor the past few days, Chat\u2019s been\u2026less than usual. Ladybug isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because of the girl he had mentioned or just life, but it\u2019s strange. Everything about him is just less. He\u2019s quieter. He flirts less, talks less, smirks less, even moves less.\nShe\u2019s starting to get a little worried.\nLadybug is sitting on one of the beams of the Eiffel Tower when he slinks up to her, blending into the fading light.\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d he says through a yawn.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks, offering her hand. He takes it, and she pulls him to sit next to her.\n\u201cJust tired.\u201d His eyes are dull, and she can see the exhaustion in his motions. \u201cSorry if I\u2019m not much help tonight, the shoot ran a lot later than expected. I was going to take a quick catnap after, but I didn\u2019t even have time to wipe off the makeup before I came here.\u201d\nThe first thing her mind latches onto is the word \u2018makeup\u2019. She can\u2019t see it in the dim light, but she can\u2019t help but wonder how it looks on him and if the makeup artist did him justice. The next word that catches is \u2018shoot\u2019. \u201cDid you say shoot?\u201d\nChat blinks slowly, and for a second, she thinks he might fall asleep on her. \u201cLooks like the cat\u2019s out of the bag,\u201d he says with a sing song lilt in his voice. A slow smirk spreads across his face.\nLadybug rolls her eyes. \u201cI will shove you off this Tower.\u201d\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t,\u201d he mumbles, leaning against her with his eyes closed. \u201cYou love me.\u201d He relaxes against her side and his breathing evens out.\nShe freezes for a few seconds. When she\u2019s sure he\u2019s asleep, she carefully moves her arm around him, holding him close so he doesn\u2019t fall. \u201cYeah I do,\u201d she murmurs as she looks out over Paris. \u201cI do love you, kitty.\u201d\n\u2014\u00ab\u00b7\u00bb\u2014\nLadybug shakes him awake when patrol is over. \u201cIt was a quiet night,\u201d she says with a small smile when he tries to apologize. \u201cJust promise you\u2019ll get some more sleep?\u201d\nChat promises, even if it\u2019s an empty one. She has this worried look on her face that tugs on his heartstrings.\n\u201cGood going, Romeo,\u201d Plagg says when he releases the transformation. \u201cYou fell asleep on top of her.\u201d\nAdrien is too tired to care. He\u2019s too tired to be excited or worried or even feel, really. \u201cWe were on the Eiffel Tower,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s romantic enough.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Plagg plops down on his pillow. \u201cGood slip of the tongue. Now she knows you do photoshoots.\u201d\n\u201cI just said shoots,\u201d Adrien argues. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll think\u2026film shoots or something. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m too tired for this Plagg, and don\u2019t we want her to know?\u201d\n\u201c You want her to know.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cShut up, Plagg. I know you do too.\u201d\nPlagg groans, but stops talking.\nAdrien isn\u2019t sure if he was dreaming or not, but when he wakes up, he remembers Plagg saying, \u201cShe loves you too, you know.\u201d\nAlya is ranting again.\nNot that this is unusual. The subject matter isn\u2019t new either. Ladybug and Chat Noir\u2019s civilian identities. Marinette\u2019s learned to hide any reaction she could possibly have to Ladybug and Chat Noir.\n\u201cI just want to know!\u201d Alya says, throwing out her arms. \u201cIs that too much to ask?!\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Nino says with a shrug. \u201cRespect their privacy.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cI\u2019m just curious!\u201d\n\u201cCuriosity killed the Chat,\u201d Adrien murmurs. His cheek is resting in his hand, and he looks like he\u2019s about to fall asleep any second.\nMarinette rolls her eyes.\n\u201cSatisfaction brought it back!\u201d Alya finishes.\nAdrien lifts his head. \u201cLet\u2019s not test that statement with the actual Chat Noir please.\u201d He yawns. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries, man,\u201d Nino says, ruffling Adrien\u2019s hair. \u201cWe aren\u2019t planning on it.\u201d\nAlya crosses her arms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can trust me with their identities!\u201d\n\nMarinette raises her eyebrows. \u201cAlya, you run a blog about them.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Alya presses a hand to her chest. \u201cI swear. Cross my heart and hope to die.\u201d\n\u201cBut they'd still be letting the cat out of the bag,\u201d Adrien says. He blinks slowly, a smirk spreading across his face.\nMarinette scoffs and shakes her head. His puns are awful, but at least this time they\u2019re not hundreds of feet above\u2014\nParis.\nHundreds of feet above Paris.\n\n \u201cLooks like the cat\u2019s out of the bag.\u201d \n\nThe lilting of his voice. His smirk. The cadence of the words. The way his left eyebrow had raised slightly. Even the blinking.\nHer eyes snap to Adrien\u2019s. He\u2019s staring at her, smirk frozen, eyes wide in surprise.\nMarinette looks down at her hands. His eyes are so green. They\u2019re the same green as Chat\u2019s. Which could be a coincidence.\nShe shuts her eyes. Chat\u2019s hair is longer and messier, but only just. Adrien calling her princess. Chat calling her princess when she was Ladybug. The homework. Ms. Mendeleiv.\nHis stare.\nAdrien Agreste is Chat Noir.\nLadybug is pacing around the roof when Chat shows up.\nMarinette hadn\u2019t said anything. She hadn\u2019t even looked at him. She knew. She had to.\nLadybug turns to him when he lands on the roof. She stares at him, mouth open like she wants to say something, no words coming out. He keeps a bit of a distance between them, because he doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do.\n\u201cThe cat\u2019s out of the bag,\u201d she finally whispers.\nChat steps closer, releasing his transformation. He catches Plagg in his hands as he pops out of the ring. \u201cMarinette,\u201d he says when the green light around him fades.\n\u201cChat Noir.\u201d She meets his eyes. She looks scared.\nLadybug hesitates before dropping her own transformation. A red kwami lands on her shoulder.\n\u201cLadybug.\u201d\n\u201cAdrien.\u201d\nThey\u2019re on a rooftop in Paris. They have all the air in the world. Why does it feel like they\u2019re suffocating?\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe all it took was a pun,\u201d Plagg mutters.\nAdrien laughs. He can\u2019t either. He honestly wasn\u2019t sure if it was ever going to happen. With that single comment, Adrien can breathe again. \u201cThis is Plagg,\u201d he says lifting his hands.\nMarinette motions to her own kwami. \u201cTikki.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cHow did I know?\u201d he asks. \u201cYour dress.\u201d\nShe frowns. \u201cMy dress? What do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cChlo\u00e9 said you weren\u2019t a designer. And you told me about it. Twice.\u201d\nShe closes her eyes. \u201cSo you\u2019ve known since\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSince Chlo\u00e9\u2019s party, yeah.\u201d He pauses before adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not saying anything sooner. I\u2026didn\u2019t know how.\u201d Plagg moves from his hands to the top of his head, nestling in his hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known how to either.\u201d\nAdrien smiles. \u201cYou would\u2019ve done it better than me.\u201d\nMarinette laughs breathlessly and shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s you.\u201d Her smile is hesitant, but it\u2019s so real.\nHe returns the smile. \u201cI am too.\u201d\n\u201cI should go,\u201d Adrien says.\nMarinette looks over at her clock. He\u2019s right, it\u2019s late, but she doesn\u2019t want him to. \u201cYou probably should.\u201d\nThey\u2019d finished the rest of their patrol by mostly standing in a slightly uneasy silence. It was strange seeing Adrien transform into Chat, how suddenly his posture and movements changed. Although surely it was somewhat similar for her. She knew she stood straighter and more confidently as Ladybug.\nMarinette had pulled him back to her house, dragging him through her trapdoor and shoving a cup of hot chocolate into his hands. Communication was key to every healthy relationship, and it had definitely been lacking in theirs.\nNow it was hours later and their hot chocolates have gone cold. Their conversation has gone from themselves to school to games to their families to their kwami and back to themselves. They\u2019ve finally reached the point they easily jumped to during patrol. And Marinette is relieved. She\u2019d been terrified that everything was going to change. At least she has this, their easy conversations and flowing banter.\nAdrien should really go. They\u2019re sitting on her bed, the trapdoor is just above him. Neither of them move.\nThere is one thing they haven\u2019t talked about.\nMarinette almost doesn\u2019t want to say anything. She doesn\u2019t want to get her hopes up like that. And she really shouldn\u2019t. But she has to know\u2026\n\u201cBefore you go,\u201d she says. Her voice sounds awful and weak. \u201cThe girl you were talking about that night\u2014\u201d She can\u2019t bring herself to say anything more.\nAdrien leans forward, brushing her bangs out of her eyes. \u201cI was talking about you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d she repeats. It sounds a little bit like a question, and it feels like one too.\n\u201cYou,\u201d he says firmly. He locks eyes with her. She should\u2019ve known him by his eyes, they stay the same brilliant green. \u201cIt was always you. Even when I thought it was someone else, it was still you.\u201d\n\u201cNot Ladybug?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d Adrien says. \u201cI\u2019m in love with all of you, Marinette. Ladybug included. If you weren\u2019t Ladybug, I\u2019d still love you just as much as I do now. You  are  Ladybug, maybe you don\u2019t see it, but I can see her when the mask is off. And I can see Marinette when the mask is on.\u201d\nMarinette leans closer. Their noses brush against each other. \u201cI\u2019m a little in love with all of you too, Adrien,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by a little, I mean I\u2019m absolutely in love with you. With you, with Chat, with all of you.\u201d She lets out a small laugh. \u201cWe made this really hard for ourselves, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\nAdrien nods. \u201cMaybe a little bit.\u201d His gaze drops. \u201cAny chance I can get a goodnight kiss before I leave?\u201d\nShe still doesn\u2019t want him to leave. She wants him here, next to her, like he always has been. She presses her lips to his to try and let him know.\nHis lips are soft and warm and she\u2019s imagined this kiss a thousand times, but it\u2019s different in every way possible. It\u2019s not their first kiss. It\u2019s not perfect. But it\u2019s real.\nAdrien presses the tips of their noses together when he pulls away.\n\u201cAlya\u2019s going to freak out,\u201d Marinette whispers.\n\u201cNino too,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think they were scheming together.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we tell them?\u201d\nMarinette shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. We could just hold hands and see what happens.\u201d\n\u201cBets will be exchanged,\u201d Adrien warns. \u201cI know for a fact that was happening.\u201d\n\u201cOh god.\u201d She buries her face in his neck. \u201cWas I really that obvious?\u201d\nHe laughs and hugs her tight. \u201cWas I?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Marinette admits. She pulls away. \u201cOne more kiss goodbye?\u201d\n\u201cIf we keep doing this, we\u2019ll be here until morning,\u201d Adrien says, but he\u2019s already leaning in.\nNeither of them would mind."
