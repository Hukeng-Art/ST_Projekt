    "text": "There are three well-known facts at Shield High:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt all starts when Bucky is honorably discharged from his unit in the army after losing his arm. Or maybe it starts when Natasha gets him a teaching job at her school. Or maybe it even starts when Steve comes home from his third tour and starts teaching at the same school a year after Bucky. It doesn\u2019t really matter how it starts, though. That\u2019s not the fun bit.\n\u00a0\nThe fun bit is how it plays out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis trip isn\u2019t mandatory,\u201d Bucky explains, waving the permission slips in the air at his class. \u201cBut it is recommended.  Highly recommended. I expect most of you to come. Any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHalf of his students are clearly not listening, eyes unfocused and fingers twitching. Bucky doesn\u2019t really care, all the information they need is on the sheets. No one puts up their hands or calls out so Bucky decides to drop it. There\u2019s still 15 minutes of class, but he hasn\u2019t got anything left planned for the lesson so he decides he\u2019ll let them go early.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, guys. Come grab a sheet off my desk, and you can go early. Provided you don\u2019t disrupt other classes.\u201d Bucky walks over to his desk, setting into his wheely chair and putting the permission slips down. There\u2019s a chorus of cheers and the kids jump to their feet, eager to leave the class.\n\u00a0\nOf course, that\u2019s when Steve pops his head in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBarnes, I need-\u201d He begins, but stops to stare at the loud students milling around the room. There are paper planes flying, and a couple of kids shouting over something, and it looks like chaos. Bucky stifles a grin.\n\u00a0\nThe students all turn at Steve\u2019s voice, dead silence washing over them as they cautiously look between Bucky and Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRogers,\u201d Bucky greets, voice stiff. There\u2019s the same old tension in the air there always is when Bucky and Steve have to talk on school grounds. The kids love it but pretend not to.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need a new whiteboard marker.\u201d Steve finally says, all eyes on him. He stands tall, back straight and jaw set, determined not to let the stares get to him.\n\u00a0\nBucky doesn\u2019t say anything, just meets his eyes and holds his ground. Usually people look away after only a couple of seconds, but not Steve. Nah, Steve\u2019s even worse than Bucky when it comes to being stubborn, and the whole school knows it.\n\u00a0\nThe problem is that Shield High isn\u2019t a big school. And so they are only two senior history teachers. So Bucky and Steve actually have to interact.\n\u00a0\nBucky still hasn\u2019t said anything, determined to make Steve uncomfortable, or at least shuffle on the spot. (He knows it\u2019s never gonna happen. The students, however, do not.)\n\u00a0\nStone-cold Terror Barnes, right here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem,\u201d Bucky eventually says. His voice is flat, an icy monotone. Steve doesn\u2019t so much as flinch. Bucky loves him for it.\n\u00a0\nThe whole class is still suspended in curiosity, waiting to see how this plays out. Bucky\u2019s not gonna disappoint.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I borrow one?\u201d Steve asks, hand still on the doorknob, only half his body in the class.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s still got his gaze fixed on Steve, not moving a fraction of an inch except to raise an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Steve spits. \u201cPlease, Barnes, may I borrow one of your markers?\u201d His tone changes to disgustingly sweet plea but there\u2019s still traces of his sneer on his face. Bucky relents and lobs a marker across the room to him. Without another word, Steve catches it and leaves the classroom.\n\u00a0\nThe door swings shut behind him and everyone looks at Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPermission slips.\u201d He says, and swivels in his chair to fiddle with the papers behind his desk. With his back to the classroom, no one tries to talk to him and he waits for everyone to leave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Barnes?\u201d A voice asks hesitantly. Bucky turns around to face her. It\u2019s Jay, one of his favourite students- not that he\u2019d let anyone know.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Jay?\u201d He prompts when she doesn\u2019t continue.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you coming on this trip?\u201d She asks, fidgeting with her form. She\u2019s nervous about something, but Bucky doesn\u2019t know what.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Are you?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. She\u2019s the kind of student he\u2019d expect to come with no hesitation, but he also knows there\u2019s something not-quite-right at home for her at the moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I- I think so,\u201d she nods. \u201cWill Mr Rogers?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAh. So that\u2019s what this is about. Mr Barnes and Mr Rogers being forced into a three day school trip together. Some kids will love it, others will be indifferent. Bucky didn\u2019t really think about the possibility of there being kids actually  uncomfortable with it. (They don\u2019t call him an asshole for nothing.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Mr Rogers is required to keep the student-teacher ratio balanced. Are you alright with that?\u201d Bucky forces a smile, tries to come across as friendly. It probably looks more like a grimace, but at least he\u2019s trying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill you be shouting at each other?\u201d Jay\u2019s not just nervous now. She looks worried, and Bucky\u2019s heart breaks a little for her. Bucky\u2019s, like, 90% sure her parents are on the verge of splitting up. He imagines that includes a lot of shouting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, no. We don\u2019t shout. He\u2019s an ass, but he\u2019s manageable. And if we upset you, let us know, okay? That\u2019s more important than him knowing he\u2019s wrong.\u201d Bucky wants to reach out, put a hand on her shoulder or something, but he still hasn\u2019t gotten the hang of casual touch since coming home. Plus, he doesn\u2019t want to make her more uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mr B,\u201d She says. Her eyes wander to something behind him, widening when they settle. Bucky turns around to see what she\u2019s looking at, and lets out a little huff of amusement when he spots it.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s his travel mug, the one Natasha got for him when he came out. He loves it, even if it is the biggest lie he knows.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s bright and rainbow, with big white print saying  \u201cNobody knows I\u2019m gay \u201d. Usually, he leaves it in the staffroom. Today he forgot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat alright with you?\u201d He asks, turning back to look at his student. Jay nods quickly, stuffing her folded permission slip into her pocket.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, of course, Mr B,\u201d she promises. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky watches her leave with a straight face, but can\u2019t help laughing when the door closes behind her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a small room between Bucky\u2019s room and Steve\u2019s, with a sink, microwave, and hotwater tap. It\u2019s the kitchen for the level but no one really uses it because the microwave is shitty and the sink occasionally leaks.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s the only one in there at lunch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks for the marker.\u201d Steve says with a shit-eating grin when Bucky walks in. Bucky knows that grin. It\u2019s not a good sign. He groans.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t actually need it?\u201d He guesses. Steve\u2019s laughter is all Bucky needs for an answer. \u201cYou\u2019re such an ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou love my ass,\u201d Steve counters lamely. He hops up onto the counter and reaches out his left hand to Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally the only reason I married you,\u201d Bucky agrees. He takes Steve\u2019s hand, fingers twisting the ring around his finger.\n\u00a0\n\"Yeah, I love you too.\u201d Steve laughs, dropping a kiss to Bucky\u2019s neck. Bucky\u2019s eyes drift closed and he laces his fingers with Steve\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hey. One of my kids is a bit nervous about spending a couple of days with us together as the only adults,\u201d Bucky says after a minute. He opens his eyes and looks at Steve. \u201cSo maybe we should tone it down a bit, just until we get back from the trip?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwo whole weeks of not barging into your class to shout at you?\u201d Steve pouts, but Bucky knows this man, knows he\u2019ll bring it down a notch if a kid doesn\u2019t feel good about it. \u201cThe damage it would do to our reputations.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d Bucky protests. \u201cI was a stone-cold terror before you started here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuddy, if I didn\u2019t turn up when I did, you would\u2019ve exposed yourself as a giant marshmallow in no time. I\u2019m surprised you lasted as long as you did,\u201d Steve snorts. It\u2019s unattractive and gross and the best sound Bucky\u2019s heard all day.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPick up Chinese on the way home,\u201d Bucky tells him, heading for the door. \u201cI\u2019m not cooking, and I\u2019d rather go without food than eat something you make.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsshole,\u201d Steve grumbles as Bucky leaves him to himself in the shitty kitchen. Bucky laughs and shuts the door behind him.\n\n\n\u00a0\nEveryone in Bucky\u2019s class hands in their permission slips by the end of the week and he\u2019s pleasantly surprised. He wasn\u2019t expecting everyone to come, to be honest. They\u2019re going down to DC to visit the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress, staying two nights in an EOC camp.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow many in your class are coming?\u201d Bucky asks Steve when it\u2019s just the two of them in his class.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly three haven\u2019t.\u201d Steve says, doodling flowers on Bucky\u2019s arm as he types up lesson plans. It\u2019s a little bit distracting but he likes having Steve this close, drawing on him like he\u2019s a piece of art.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll of my class is coming. You realise what this means, right?\u201d Bucky checks, glancing over at Steve from his laptop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUuh,\u201d Steve looks up from Bucky\u2019s arm for a moment before going back to the vine weaving from his wrist to his elbow. \u201cLotsa kids?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have 52 kids total if everyone comes. Even with three missing, there\u2019d only be one room left. We\u2019d have to share,\u201d Bucky explains.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe literally sleep in the same bed every night, Buck.\u201d Steve teases, but Bucky knows Steve gets what he means.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThese kids will get the best show of their lives.\u201d Bucky mutters under his breath, rotating his arm so his palm is facing up. Steve gets the hint and trails his hand down to rest in Bucky\u2019s, squeezing lightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is gonna be wonderful,\u201d he grins.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s after 5pm on a Friday night, so Bucky really isn\u2019t expecting the knock on the door. Steve doesn\u2019t have time to slip into the attached kitchen before the door is swinging open and Jay\u2019s calling out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Barnes? Can I talk to you?\u201d She asks, poking her head through the door as Steve dives under Bucky\u2019s desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI,\u201d she starts, but can\u2019t continue because her lip\u2019s wobbling and her hands are shaking. Bucky jumps to his feet and steers her to a chair. He pulls up a chair for himself and rubs her back, the same as he used to do for Steve when they were kids and he had trouble breathing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cDeep breaths.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt takes a minute, but eventually Jay\u2019s breathing evens out and she wipes her tears on the hem of her sleeve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen did you realise you were gay?\u201d She asks and Bucky clicks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He tells her, because it\u2019s the truth. It all started with Steve, but Bucky hardly has two memories without Steve anyway, so it\u2019s too hard to pinpoint when or how he realised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was about thirteen, I think,\u201d Bucky says. He knows he doesn\u2019t owe her any of this, but she\u2019s so upset and if there\u2019s a chance it might help her? He\u2019s gonna tell her. \u201cI\u2019d known my best friend since we were six and I\u2019d always known I loved him. Told everyone we were going to get married, be together forever, all that stuff. Adults told me I\u2019d grow out of it but I guess I just never did. Then we were teenagers and he kissed me and realised I was in love with him. It wasn\u2019t all easy, but it was okay because I had him\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat is so cute,\u201d Jay giggles, her laughter bubbling out. \u201cHow on earth did you get a reputation as an icy terror?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the arm.\u201d Bucky grins, relieved she\u2019s no longer crying. Yeah, he\u2019s good enough with kids to teach, but comforting a crying one? Way out of his depth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the eyes. And the murder strut,\u201d Jay corrects with a laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMurder strut? Honestly?\u201d Bucky snorts, swinging on his chair. \u201cThat sounds like something Natasha would say.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Romanov? Yeah, that\u2019s what she calls it,\u201d Jay grins. Her hair flops in her face and she pulls it back, tying it up in a ponytail. Her hair\u2019s about the same length as his and Bucky makes a mental note to get Steve to tie it up, see if it makes much of a difference.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe is so full of shit,\u201d Bucky laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know there was a rumour that you two were dating?\u201d Jay says nonchalantly, and Bucky can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s joking or not.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat,\u201d he says, because there\u2019s nothing else he can say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. When you started you were super close. And you\u2019d speak in Russian to each other. Plus people would mention seeing you together outside of work and\u2026 wow. Okay, it sounds stalker-ish when I say it out loud.\u201d Jay hums, pulling at the fray in the tear of her jeans.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNatasha\u2019s my sister. That is just so wrong,\u201d Bucky groans. It\u2019s kind of amusing too, though.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Romanov\u2019s your sister? What, next you\u2019ll be telling me you\u2019re married to Mr Rogers,\u201d Jay snorts. Bucky can\u2019t help the choked laugh that comes out. He can hear Steve laugh, too. Steve, Mr Rogers, Bucky\u2019s  husband  who is hiding under his desk while he chats to a kid about something they\u2019ve come way off track about.\n\u00a0\nJay doesn\u2019t hear Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Natasha\u2019s not my  sister -sister. But she\u2019s like family.\u201d Bucky explains weakly, getting to his feet and heading back to his desk. He can see the blue of Steve\u2019s shirt sticking out a bit- not enough for Jay to see, but enough for Bucky to swallow a smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMister B, are you happy?\u201d Jay asks in a rush of exhaled air. Bucky\u2019s in his chair now, feet tucked under his desk in Steve\u2019s lap (just to annoy the bastard) and hand hovering over his laptop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill I ever stop being scared of it?\u201d She continues, voice quiet and eyes misty. She\u2019s pulled her sleeves down to cover her hands again, and she looks so damn small it breaks Bucky\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says softly, \u201cyou will. You\u2019ll find someone who loves you more than anything else, and you will love them with everything you are. And when you love someone that much, there\u2019s no room left to be scared of something that feels so good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve squeezes his leg under the table and Jay wipes her eyes on her sleeve again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mr B. Have a good weekend, see you on Monday.\u201d She says through a smile. It\u2019s weak but not forced and Bucky returns it, hoping it\u2019s comforting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, you too. And Jay- if you ever need someone, I\u2019m here, alright?\u201d He says, fixing her with a  look . She nods a couple of times before answering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s up and wrapping himself around Bucky as soon as the door clicks shut and Bucky can\u2019t do anything but tuck his smile into Steve\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was so sappy, Buck.\u201d Steve laughs, but he clings just that much tighter to him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut your face or you\u2019re walking home.\u201d Bucky threatens. They both know it\u2019s hollow.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo of Steve\u2019s three students hand in their forms, the third one away for a fortnight for their parents' wedding. It\u2019s Tuesday, six days from the trip, and Bucky\u2019s actually getting quite excited. It\u2019s his fourth year here but this will be his first overnight trip.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s got marking to do, though, and he plans to have it done before the trip so he can just enjoy it for what it is. Tuesdays (and Thursdays) are Steve and Sam\u2019s gym nights, so Bucky makes use of his time alone to grade the essays from his sophomore class.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t realise how late it is until it\u2019s dark outside and Steve sends him a message saying he\u2019s on his way home. It\u2019s almost 7 and Bucky\u2019s still at the damn school. Gross.\n\u00a0\nThe school\u2019s not far from home, though, so he\u2019ll probably still beat Steve. With that thought in mind, Bucky packs up his work and races to his car. It\u2019s starting to rain and Bucky takes a moment to be grateful Sam\u2019s driving Steve home and the fool isn\u2019t out catching his death on his bike.\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s sitting in his car, telling Steve he\u2019s just on his own way home too when he sees her. He\u2019s not certain, but he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s Jay across the road, waiting by herself in the rain. He sighs and pulls out of his carpark, driving over to where she is.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay?\u201d He says, winding down the window. Yep, that\u2019s her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Hi, Mr B.\u201d She says, forcing a smile. Bucky can see she\u2019s shivering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNeed a lift?\u201d He offers. It\u2019s cold and dark and she\u2019s just a kid. He can\u2019t leave her out here alone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I- no thanks. My bus is only fifteen minutes away.\u201d She tells him, checking her phone for the time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. Come on, I\u2019ll drop you home,\u201d Bucky insists. Jay glances around the empty street and shakes her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll just wait, Mr B. Thanks for the offer though.\u201d She looks nervous and when it clicks, Bucky\u2019s so mad at himself for not even thinking about it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit. Sorry, Jay. I didn\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable. But it\u2019s so wet, please let me call Natasha. I know she\u2019s still inside, she wouldn\u2019t mind dropping you home. Or Maximoff. Or a taxi, I\u2019ll pay it for you-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, Mr B.\u201d Jay cuts in, another shiver wracking through her body. Bucky\u2019s reminded of Steve as a teen, waiting out in the cold for Bucky to finish sports practice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t wait out in the rain for quarter of an hour. You\u2019ll get sick,\u201d he says. Rain\u2019s getting inside his car but he can\u2019t bring himself to care, not with this child shivering in the dark. \u201cPlease let me drop you home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a gust of wind, carrying the rain and sleet straight into Jay\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She relents, opening the door and hopping in. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe car ride\u2019s a little bit awkward, but maybe that\u2019s just Bucky. He turns on the radio, fingers drumming on the steering wheel to the beat of the music.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs it safe for you to drive with only one arm?\u201d Jay asks suddenly, eyes widening with shock when she realises what she\u2019s said. Bucky laughs at the bluntness of her question.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. This car\u2019s an automatic. We picked it out after I lost the arm,\u201d he explains.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWere you in the army?\u201d Jay asks as she guides Bucky to her house. Bucky nods, not taking his eyes from the road.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Sergeant James Barnes,\u201d he confirms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThought so,\u201d Jay says with a small nod. Bucky catches it from the corner of his eye. He raises and eyebrow and glances at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot the sergeant bit,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen your dogtags.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe clearly hasn\u2019t seen Bucky\u2019s dogtags or she\u2019d realise he doesn\u2019t hate Steve. Not when that\u2019s the name he carries around his neck, resting over his heart. There\u2019s the matter of his ring, too. He keeps it on the chain because it\u2019s not like he has a left hand for it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe chain, anyway. Guessed they were dogtags.\u201d Jay continues, mainly to herself.\n\u00a0\nThey lapse back into silence again, save for the song on the radio. Bucky doesn\u2019t recognise but he likes it all the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s my street,\u201d He tells her as they pass his road. He can see his house with its lights off. He\u2019s still got a shot at beating Steve home. Jay looks down the road.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool,\u201d she says. \u201cRandom question, but do you hate Mr Wilson too?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky wasn\u2019t expecting that at all. \u201cNot really. Why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause everyone knows he and Mr Rogers are good friends, and since you hate Mr Rogers so much you might hate him too by default. I\u2019ve never seen you interact.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate Sam Wilson,\u201d Bucky says. It\u2019s the truth, really. He loves annoying the shit out of the guy, because it\u2019s just so  easy.\u00a0But he loves him, too. He\u2019s a good guy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. He\u2019s funny. Seems to think he could kick your ass,\u201d Jay grins. Bucky snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI may have one arm, but I\u2019d still take him any day. I\u2019d like to see his punk ass try.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJay lets out a sound of amusement, but then sits up straight, tension seeping back into her posture.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m coming up, but you can just drop me here,\u201d she tells him in a flat voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that? I can take you right up to the door, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Bucky offers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d Jay says, voice quiet again. \u201cBut if my parents see me being dropped home they will think I was out with people older than me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if they saw it was just me?\u201d Bucky suggests. Jay shakes her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat would probably be worse. They\u2019d think we\u2019re screwing for my grades.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky winces, because that\u2019s fucking harsh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry-\u201d Jay begins, but Bucky cuts her off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You do what you gotta do, okay? I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJay gives him one last fleeting smile before disappearing into the cold. Bucky watches her until she turns the corner, edging his car closer so he can still see her. It isn\u2019t until she enters a house down the next street that he drives away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tells Steve. Of course he does, Steve\u2019s his husband, his best friend, he\u2019d be able to tell Bucky\u2019s worried without even looking at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about Jay Boskur.\u201d Bucky says over dinner. Steve looks up at him but doesn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI dropped her home tonight, she was outside in the rain and I couldn\u2019t just leave her. But then she wouldn\u2019t let me turn onto her street in case her parents saw. She said they\u2019d think we were screwing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Steve mutters on an exhale. \u201cAnd after that conversation in your class the other day\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly. And she seemed so nervous to go home. From what I can tell, her parents aren't the best people to be around right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus.\u201d Steve repeats, dropping his head to his hands so he can run his fingers through his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s her birthday in three weeks. She\u2019ll legally be an adult then. I hope it\u2019s not bad enough for her to have to move out, but if it is, at least that option isn\u2019t too far away. She won\u2019t have to go through CPS and foster homes or any of that shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut she won\u2019t have financial support or a roof over her head,\u201d Steve points out. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous enough for a kid without throwing in her sexual identity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky falls quiet. Steve\u2019s right, of course he\u2019s right. Bucky hadn\u2019t thought too much about that, he always had enough money growing up. Steve, on the other hand, didn\u2019t. He spent so many dinners with the Barnes family so Sarah wouldn\u2019t have to cook, stayed over so she could work the night shifts. Bucky\u2019s always been aware of it, but it hasn\u2019t stuck with him the way it\u2019s stuck with Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCould she stay here?\u201d Steve suggests cautiously. \u201cOnly if she was comfortable, of course. But just a roof over her head, at least while she finishes school.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course we\u2019d offer, right?\u201d Bucky asks. \u201cOh, God, the poor kid.\u201d He doesn\u2019t realise until Steve\u2019s up and wrapping his arms around him, cradling Bucky\u2019s head with his oversized hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, Buck. I got you,\u201d he soothes. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be okay, I doubt it will even come to that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky nods, pulling Steve down to sit in his lap. \u201cI know,\u201d he sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you still feel like shit about it?\u201d Steve guesses, hooking his chin over Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. You know what would make me feel a bit better, though?\u201d Bucky murmurs, tightening his grip on Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMm, what\u2019s that?\u201d Steve hums.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you do the dishes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s heading for the lifts, aiming to make it to class before all his students. He\u2019s got a pile of textbooks awkwardly balanced on his arm and his hair\u2019s blowing in his face when the bell rings.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold the lift!\u201d He calls, trying to hurry but not wanting to drop the books.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold the lift,\u201d Steve parrots back. Bucky looks up in horror to see his husband frantically push a button, resulting in the lift doors shutting in slow motion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, you ableist piece of sh-\u201d Bucky shouts, starting to jog only for his books to clatter to the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, that was petty. You alright, Mr Barnes?\u201d Someone to his left asks. Bucky fixes them with his Death Glare(\u2122) and refuses to feel guilty about it when he realises it\u2019s just Sonya, one of his juniors.\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019fine.\u201d Bucky says, picking up his books. \u201cAnyone ever tell you Rogers is an ass?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir, this is my second year in one of your classes. Of course I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s an ass.\u201d Sonya snorts, handing Bucky one of his books.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bright kid. Get to class.\u201d He says, leaving her to call a lift back down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee you this afternoon.\u201d She calls, disappearing down the hallway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky needs to get back at Steve for the elevator incident. If he were serious about it, he\u2019d just make him sleep on the couch. But Bucky doesn\u2019t really care, and none of the student body would find out if that\u2019s all he did to retaliate. So it has to be something at school.\n\u00a0\nHe spends the rest of the morning trying to think of something but nothing comes to mind. He\u2019s tempted to set the fire alarm off in Steve\u2019s room to get the sprinklers going, but that would disrupt the kids\u2019 learning, and Bucky\u2019s only an asshole to Steve.\n\u00a0\nThe moment presents itself at interval when he passes Steve in the corridor. Steve doesn\u2019t notice him at first, engrossed in tying his shoelace. He\u2019s got a coffee resting on the windowsill next to him, branded with the logo from the cafe down the road. Without even hesitating, Bucky swipes the coffee and takes a big sip, staring straight at Steve as he does so.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Steve growls, standing back up when he realises what Bucky\u2019s doing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, but not enough sugar,\u201d Bucky shrugs. They both know Bucky doesn\u2019t even like sugar in coffee, but the kids don\u2019t, and that\u2019s what counts. Without another word Bucky turns away from Steve and continues down the hallway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSavage,\u201d someone whispers. (Bucky counts it as a win.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir alarm goes off at 6am on Monday and Bucky really doesn\u2019t want to get up. He\u2019s warm and soft and it\u2019s one of those rare mornings where he wakes up in the same position he fell asleep in: the back of his head tucked under Steve\u2019s chin, his husband\u2019s arms holding him close. (More often than not he\u2019s half off the bed, or the dog\u2019s in his face, or Steve\u2019s inadvertently got his foot shoved into Bucky\u2019s stomach.)\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, Steve has no problem getting up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorning, Buck,\u201d he yawns. Bucky can feel him sitting up behind him for a moment, and the bounce in the mattress as he gets out of bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna geddup,\u201d Bucky groans into his pillow. He can hear Steve laughing and the heavy sound of his footsteps before a hand drops to his hair, gently moving his face out of the pillow. Bucky blinks his eyes open to see Steve, right there. He smiles at Bucky softly before giving him a kiss and pulling away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cToo bad. Have a shower, you stink.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour face stinks,\u201d Bucky mutters as he sits up. Steve raises an eyebrow at him, because unlike Bucky he actually looks and smells  good when he wakes up. And he damn well knows it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get up now,\u201d Steve says as he opens up their bedroom door to let Spud in, \u201cyou\u2019ll be late. And you can\u2019t actually be late today, because we\u2019ve got the trip. You washing your hair?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up.\u201d Bucky insists, dropping a kiss to Spud\u2019s fur as she clambers onto their bed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m washing my hair. It\u2019s so gross you could probably make a Big Mac out of it.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRemind me to never touch you again. Or at least until you\u2019ve washed it.\u201d Steve laughs. He\u2019s already dressed in his running gear and Bucky sort of hates him for being a morning person.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou running in today?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep. You take ages when you wash your hair, so I doubt I\u2019ll see you before I leave. I\u2019ll put my bag in the car and feed Spud. Get in the damn shower.\u201d Steve says, kissing Bucky once more before leaving him alone in their room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou just touched me!\u201d Bucky calls after him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky arrives at the school just before 7am and manages to make it to the staff showers without being seen. It wouldn\u2019t really matter, except he\u2019s got Steve\u2019s bag and that might raise a few eyebrows because Mr Barnes  hates Mr Rogers.\n\u00a0\nThe bathroom (is it a bathroom when there\u2019s no bath?) is filled with steam when Bucky pushes the door open and he can hear a shower running. Steve\u2019s clothes are scrunched in a messy pile on a bench and he\u2019s humming off-key, loud enough for the sound to carry over the spray of the water.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGot your stuff, Stevie.\u201d Bucky calls, folding Steve\u2019s clothes in a neat pile and putting them in a bag.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome join me,\u201d Steve offers, his head poking out of the stall he\u2019s in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEw, no. We are not having shower sex at  school , Steve!\u201d Bucky exclaims, head snapping up from the clothes he was focussed on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can shower together  without  sex, Buck,\u201d Steve scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re an animal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t even pretend that\u2019s what you meant. I\u2019m going now, see you on the bus.\u201d Bucky laughs, turning to head out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuck! Wait,\u201d Steve calls. Bucky turns around to see him leaning out of the stall again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be surrounded by our students for the next three days. One last kiss?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTalk about high maintenance.\u201d Bucky sighs, but he crosses the room to kiss Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThree days of arguments and pranks,\u201d he whispers against Steve\u2019s lips. \u201cYou ready?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBring it on.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey manage to get the bus loaded and on the road by 9am, with Bucky at the back and Steve at the front (he'll get motion sickness in the back, always has since he was a kid).\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s pretty quiet on the bus, kids just chatting amongst themselves, so Bucky decides to put in his headphones. Unfortunately for him, his iPod\u2019s drained of battery so he just sits there with silent buds in his ears. He\u2019s about to take them out again, or maybe connect them to his phone when he hears the kids behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Barnes,\u201d a kid- Jake- \u00a0giggles from behind Bucky. This is Bucky\u2019s first year with him but he\u2019s heard from Steve the guy can be a little shit. So, since he\u2019s giggling, Bucky decides to give it a minute.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, he can\u2019t hear you. He\u2019s got his headphones in,\u201d one of Steve\u2019s kids says. Bucky thinks it might be Nathan but he doesn\u2019t look to see. \u201cWhat are you asking him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just wanted to see if he could hear us,\u201d Jake says, voice dropping to a whisper. \u201cAs cool as he is, I don\u2019t want him hearing everything we say.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool ?\u201d Nathan hisses. \u201cHe\u2019s not cool, he\u2019s terrifying. When he looks at me I just want to apologise and run away. Mr Rogers is the cool one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had Mr Barnes. He\u2019s a good teacher, even if he is terrifying.\u201d Jake insists. Bucky\u2019s a bit blown by his loyalty, they\u2019ve never talked about anything other than schoolwork.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou had Mr Rogers for two years but after a couple of months with Mr Barnes you\u2019ve switched sides?\u201d Nathan asks incredulously. \u201cTraitor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about sides, dumbass. They\u2019re both idiots when it comes to their ongoing fights. I\u2019m just saying that when you get past the Stone-Cold Terror thing Mr Barnes has going on he\u2019s not too bad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit. You have a crush on him.\u201d Nathan laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo! What the hell, man. He\u2019s like, a hundred! And scary!\u201d Jake splutters. Bucky has to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s probably, like, thirty-something. Second of all, you like scary guys. Guess that\u2019s why you like him more than Rogers, huh? Is Mr Rogers too pure for you, all that blond-hair-blue-eyes thing he\u2019s got going on?\u201d Nathan teases, and Bucky\u2019s starting to love this kid.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Rogers is cool too, he can be scary. You should\u2019ve seen him go off at Mr Rumlow for dress-coding Pip. That was brutal, I thought he was gonna explode.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOoh, I heard about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and did you know he\u2019s been arrested? I don\u2019t know what for but I\u2019m willing to bet he killed a serial killer or something.\u201d Jake continues. It\u2019s true that Steve\u2019s been arrested- they both have, back in the nineties at protests. But they weren\u2019t serious enough to stop them enlisting, and Bucky\u2019s almost forgotten it had even happened.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019d think someone so righteous wouldn\u2019t pick on an amputee. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d Nathan asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Barnes probably started it. I bet it was over some stupid misunderstanding and they\u2019re both assholes and won\u2019t back down,\u201d Jakes says with a theatrical sigh. Nathan laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think he comes home to his wife and complains about  That Idiot Barnes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s actually married.\u201d Jake confesses. \u201cHe never mentions his wife, no one\u2019s ever heard of her and he doesn\u2019t have any pictures. And whenever someone asks him about her he blushes and changes the subject. There\u2019s something fishy going on there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy God, you actually have conspiracy theories on Mr Rogers. This is ridiculous, Jake.\u201d Nathan groans.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re not conspiracy theories! They\u2019re just normal theories. Thoughts. Ideas. You know\u2026\u201d Jake mumbles. They fall silent for a minute and Bucky loses himself in watching the scenery change as they drive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think his rank was in the army?\u201d Jake asks after a minute.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo idea. Bet you got a million theories, right?\u201d Nathan sighs. Bucky\u2019s not sure, because he doesn\u2019t really know the kid and he can\u2019t even see him, but he thinks Nathan sounds amused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI literally have no idea. Do you think he outranked Mr Barnes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do you even know they both served? Mr Barnes could totally have lost his arm in a car crash or something.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, man. Just because you\u2019re ace doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t noticed their tight shirts. You can see the tags through them easily. Mr Rogers\u2019 ones are more easy to see, but Mr Barnes definitely has something,\u201d Jake says with a smile in his voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrust you to notice every detail of their chests. What happened to Mr Barnes being an old man, huh?\u201d Nathan goads.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s gay, too.\u201d Jake continues, ignoring Nathan\u2019s latest comment. \u201cHe had this coffee mug the other day, that rainbow one that says  Nobody Knows I\u2019m Gay. Best day of my life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude! Just because he\u2019s gay doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got a shot! He\u2019s your teacher!\u201d Nathan hisses, voice dropping right down. There\u2019s enough chatter in the bus for Bucky to have to strain to hear, but he still catches it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNate! Not like that! I just mean, you know. It\u2019s nice to know other people are gay. There\u2019s something comforting about it. Oh my God, I can crush on him  without  wanting to have a chance. He\u2019s an adult, I don\u2019t want him to be interested in me. That is so wrong. Ugh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you do have a crush on him!\u201d Nathan exclaims. It\u2019s still quiet, though. Bucky\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s the only one outside of the conversation who heard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crush. I just- he\u2019s really hot,\u201d Jake replies in a small voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are such a mess,\u201d Nathan laughs fondly. Bucky goes back to staring out the window, letting them chat away in private.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bus pulls up outside the Liberty Bell just after 11am and Nathan and Jake shoot out of their seats to get off the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoys! Slow down,\u201d Steve says, standing at the door of the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a  trip, Rogers. Let them have some fun.\u201d Bucky groans, grabbing his coat from the vacant seat next to him and standing up. \u201cNot everything has to be about rules and responsibility.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Steve sneers. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to know anything about responsibility.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, who shoved that stick up your ass?\u201d Bucky laughs. Dennis- the bus driver- watches on with a panicked expression. Bucky doesn\u2019t dare move, knowing he\u2019s a second away from melting into laughter, especially with Steve\u2019s face like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jay assures Dennis. \u201cThey\u2019re always like this. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDennis nods mutely and opens the bus door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bus is leaving in fifteen minutes,\u201d Steve shouts after the students. \u201cLook at the bell then get back in. We\u2019re having lunch in less than an hour.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDennis leaves the bus too, heading for the toilets, and suddenly Steve and Bucky are alone again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Steve asks, glancing out the window to make sure no one\u2019s watching them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo much,\u201d Bucky laughs. \"Jake and Nathan spent the first hour talking about us and how hot we are.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrust Jake to start that conversation,\u201d Steve snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d Bucky blurts. It just slipped out and he finds himself blushing like a thirteen year old with a crush on his best friend again, instead of a grown man with his damn husband.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Steve says softly. \u201cMe too. But it\u2019s not worth the risk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I know,\u201d Bucky nods. He\u2019d rather keep this up than kiss Steve right now. They\u2019re sharing a room tonight, they can make up for it then.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Buck,\u201d Steve says. Bucky looks up. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then he\u2019s off the bus before Bucky can reply.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re all big kids,\u201d Bucky says when they\u2019re all gathered around the visitor centre of Valley Forge National Park. \u00a0\u201cMr Rogers and I think you can manage yourselves. Go in groups of twos or threes, complete the quiz, take some photos, be back here by 2:30. Stick to the main paths, do not go far, and stay with your group. Any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen\u2019s lunch?\u201d A kid calls out from the crowd. Bucky laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLunch is whenever you like. Take your backpacks, find somewhere to eat, and tidy up after yourselves. Does everyone have either my number or Mr Rogers\u2019 number?\u201d Bucky asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d they chorus in bored tones.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee you at 2:30!\u201d Bucky dismisses, watching the students mill out the door to explore the park. They all collect their sheets from Steve and disappear. Bucky\u2019s willing to bet at least half have gone to have their lunch straight away. Usually he\u2019d want to keep a closer eye on them all but part of this trip is about self-management, and so he leaves them to it.\n\n\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s at the National Memorial Arch with about a third of the kids at 1:30 just chatting away. There\u2019s a group of girls scribbling down their answers in rapid-fire over by the sign post and Bucky wanders over to see what they\u2019re up to.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou girls have any questions?\u201d He asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d one of them says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bucky smiles. \u201cBut if I read that and it\u2019s all Hamilton quotes, you won\u2019t pass. Plagiarism is a thing, you know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir,\u201d she gasps dramatically, \u201cI would  never !\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cInstead of Hamilton, he promotes Charles Lee, makes him second in command- \u201d one of her friend reads out with a satisfied smirk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a general, wee.\u201d Bucky says in absolute deadpan before walking away and leaving them to their quiz.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoddamn.\u201d The first girl mutters, just loud enough for Bucky to hear.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSteve does one last round at 2pm to make sure everyone\u2019s making their way back to the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you two hate each other so much why are you on the trip together?\u201d Dennis asks when it\u2019s just the two of them. There are a couple of kids around, but they\u2019re mainly talking amongst themselves or already in the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only two history teachers with senior classes,\u201d Bucky explains with a shrug. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s not that serious. It doesn\u2019t affect our teaching.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever you say, Boss,\u201d Dennis sighs with a pat to Bucky\u2019s right shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m right. Fight me on it.\u201d Bucky mutters after him, too quiet to be overheard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, someone\u2019s argumental.\u201d Jay laughs, and okay, maybe he was only quiet enough for Dennis not to overhear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's argumentative,\u201d Bucky corrects absently. \u201cAnd that can be blamed on my-\u201d He hesitates, not wanting to tell her he has a husband, but not wanting to undermine his relationship with Steve- \u201cpartner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr B,\u201d Jay grins with a wink. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, you can say boyfriend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI regret telling you anything,\u201d Bucky groans as he heads onto the bus. Jay laughs as she follows him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon't worry, Mr B. Your secret is safe with me,\u201d she says from somewhere behind him. Bucky scoffs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's hardly a secret, buddy. Even Rogers knows.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that- that's not why he hates you, right?\u201d Jay asks, going from joking to serious in two seconds flat. Bucky turns around and puts his hand on her shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRogers doesn't hate my sexuality. As much as it pains me to say, he's not that bad a person. But don't tell anyone I said that, okay?\u201d Bucky says, meeting her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cToo late! You're on a crowded bus!\u201d Someone calls out and Bucky's head snaps round. He can't tell who said it but everyone's grinning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMotherfucking piece of goddamn shit.\u201d Bucky snarls. The kids just laugh harder.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone's accounted for by 2:40 and the bus is back on the road. It's disconcertingly quiet for a bus of 50 kids so Bucky doesn't put his headphones in and opts to stay alert. They've been driving for barely five minutes when Jake speaks up.\n\u00a0\n(Of course it's Jake.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Rogers!\u201d He calls down the bus. He has to speak up because he's right at the back behind Bucky and Steve's right up the front, but Steve hears him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou alright, Jake?\u201d Steve calls back, getting out of his seat to look down the aisle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Barnes said something nice about you when you were outside.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve's attention immediately snaps to Bucky, eyes wide and face clearly reading \u2018 Betrayal\u2019 .\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asks in a tone most people would use when they found out someone was talking shit behind their back, not defending them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was being really nice-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan it, Jake.\u201d Bucky snaps. \u201cI only said you don't hate me for being gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course I don't.\u201d Steve says, standing up straight and addressing the whole bus. \u201cIt's Barnes I have an issue with, not his sexuality. Any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA dozen hands shoot up but both Steve and Bucky ignore them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood talk,\u201d Steve concludes before sitting back down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTold you he's gay,\u201d Jake whispers from behind Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey arrive at the EOC Camp just after 5pm and unload the bus straight away so Dennis can shack up wherever he's staying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can choose your cabins, four to a room, one group of three. No sex or you  will  be sent home, don't test us. We're having pizza for dinner, any allergies and dietary requirements have been taken into consideration. Mr Barnes and I are at the end of the hallway so as long as you don't choose that room you're good.\u201d Steve says, sounding like a news reporter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you and Mr Barnes sharing a room?\u201d Someone calls out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere aren't enough rooms for us to have one each. Any  relevant questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone's quiet, sitting on their packs and just wanting to go inside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne more thing,\u201d Bucky adds. \u201cStay on the property. If you wander and get lost it's your own damn fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Steve scowls, as if he doesn't have the mouth of a sailor himself. Bucky rolls his eyes.\n\n\n\u00a0\nIt happens when Steve\u2019s out with a couple of the kids getting the pizzas. Almost everyone else is in the hall- the odd exception of tired kids just hanging out in their rooms.\n\u00a0\nSo yeah, there\u2019s Bucky with just over 40 kids and their music.\n\u00a0\nHe ignores it for the most part, opting to sit in the corner and read his book. He\u2019s keeping a vague eye on them but they\u2019re all 17 and 18, they don\u2019t need him babying them.\n\u00a0\nThen someone puts on that stupid Lady Gaga song- Bad Romance-, and honestly, how can he  not ?\n\u00a0\nSome of his students are up there already, doing that creepy dance the white things do. Joining in is obviously the only logical thing to do.\n\u00a0\nThey slow down when he makes his way across the room, as if they think he\u2019s going to turn the music off. Fair enough, he guesses. Natasha\u2019s murder strut, and all that.\n\u00a0\nInstead, Bucky makes his way to the front centre and joins in. There\u2019s a hesitation within the crowd, Lady Gaga keeping the room from falling into a silence. It doesn\u2019t last long, though. Someone starts clapping, and before he knows it everyone\u2019s watching him and cheering him along.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a lot harder to do with one hand, doesn\u2019t quite have the same effect, but no one seems to care. He carries out the dance, laughing with his students and he gets on the floor and moves his legs around. If he put more thought into it he might realise it isn\u2019t really the sort of dance a grown man should be doing in front of minors, but he hasn\u2019t put any thought into it and he\u2019s having fun. He\u2019s  happy.\n\u00a0\nBucky finds himself wanting more when the song fades off into another one- one he doesn\u2019t have a dance for. The kid with the iPod- Nathan, Bucky realises- scrambles to his feet and grabs the device from where it\u2019s plugged into the speakers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got another one for you, Mr Barnes!\u201d He calls, clicking something.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill I know it?\u201d Bucky asks, stretching his legs out to either side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d Nathan laughs, finally clicking play and coming to Bucky\u2019s left.\n\u00a0\nOf course it is.\n\u00a0\nBucky laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll the single ladies!\u201d Beyonce calls out, the room erupting into cheers and claps. Jay jumps up to flank Bucky on the right.\n\u00a0\nThey make it through the song flawlessly, despite Bucky having to point at the empty space where his left hand should be throughout the song. He doesn\u2019t let it bring him down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was fantastic,\u201d Jay gasps. She grins at Bucky, running a hand through her thick black hair. \u201cWhat next?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer question is met with two things: The main door opening, Steve and his crew arriving with pizza, and the opening bars to Candy Man.\n\u00a0\nBucky ignores Steve and starts clicking his fingers and and swaying his hips to the music. Steve knows this one, knows how to do it with Bucky and his missing arm.\n\u00a0\nNone of the kids know that, not yet.\n\u00a0\nSteve barely has to think before his pizzas are left on a table to the side and he shimmies up to Bucky, dropping to one knee and holding his hand out.\n\u00a0\nThey used to do this together in the army. Back at the bases with nothing to do between missions, dancing was Bucky\u2019s favourite pastime. And with Steve being absolutely useless, it was Bucky\u2019s job to make sure his guy could do something right.\n\u00a0\nThe Lindy Hop was not an easy one for Steve, but it\u2019s the one he enjoyed the most so they stuck with it. Any song they could fit it to, they would. It started out slow and frustratingly repetitive as Steve stepped on Bucky\u2019s toes and mistimed his pacing, but eventually he got the hang of it. Now he even leads, swinging Bucky over his back and dipping him.\n\u00a0\nBucky accepts Steve\u2019s hand, letting his husband swing him back and forth, their legs kicking out in time to the music. It\u2019s glorious, Steve whipping Bucky back and forth and flipping him over his back. Bucky\u2019s footwork is miles better than Steve\u2019s, but Steve still ain\u2019t half bad. He manages the song without tripping over, a massive improvement from their teenage years, and even their army years.\n\u00a0\nThe kids are clapping and cheering and laughing but Bucky tunes them out, focusing on the way his body moves seamlessly with Steve\u2019s, the grip of his fingers holding onto Steve\u2019s as he\u2019s twirled around, the warmth of Steve\u2019s breath on his face in brief passing. It\u2019s magic and Bucky can\u2019t get enough.\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, the song ends and something Bucky doesn\u2019t recognise replaces it. He pulls away from Steve, rapidly gaining awareness of their audience.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Bucky pants. He avoids Steve\u2019s eyes and pretends that was only for him to hear, not the entire student body. He knows they heard. Or at least some did, and one thing Bucky knows about teenagers is that they\u2019re fantastic at spreading gossip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Steve snaps. He reels away from Bucky to share out the pizzas.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the kids from their rooms,\u201d Bucky says to nobody in particular. He needn\u2019t have bothered though. The rooms are all empty, they must have all heard the laughing and joined to watch the dancing. Bucky takes the time to grab a sweater from his bag. It\u2019s big and blue and baggy, and originally Steve\u2019s, which is probably why he loves it so much. He effortlessly ties the left sleeve in knot and leaves their room to head back to the hall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Barnes?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s head snaps up and he finds himself looking at Jay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, you good?\u201d He asks. She nods and walks with him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Do you mind if I ask you something?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI might not answer, but you can ask away,\u201d Bucky shrugs. Jay nods again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you hate Mr Rogers so much?\u201d Bucky doesn\u2019t look at her, just keeps walking at her side. He shrugs again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. We started out fine, just mocking each other, but it sort of escalated. And now we\u2019re both too stubborn to back down, I guess,\u201d Bucky tells her. It\u2019s not really a lie, that is kinda how they got to where they are. But it\u2019s obviously not the full truth either. None of this is about hate, not in the slightest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you regret that it got this far?\u201d Jay asks, her voice lowering as they get closer to the hall. Bucky looks her in the eye and smiles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah. I can\u2019t imagine it being any different, and I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLights Out is at 10pm because they have a lot planned for the next day. Bucky's counting down the seconds, desperately wanting to go to bed to Steve but knowing he doesn't have an excuse until bed time is mandatory and all the kids are gone.\n\u00a0\nMost of them are in their rooms anyway, just a handful choosing to stay out in the hall chatting away and playing games. Steve's gone to bed in a \u201crage\u201d, claiming to need some space from Bucky. It's funny, and Bucky really does like it, but it's just the first day of this trip and he's ready to go back to bed where he knows Steve's waiting for him.\n\u00a0\nIt's good, it's easy, they've always been the type of couple to bicker relentlessly in company. But they don't often spend so many consecutive hours with company and Bucky is more than ready for some alone time with his husband.\n\u00a0\nAs if reading his mind, the clock strikes ten.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, guys. Bed time,\u201d Bucky says. A couple kids groan but they all head off without an issue. He follows them.down the hall, popping his head into each room to make sure everyone's in bed until he reaches his and Steve's room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Steve mumbles sleepily. He's in his sleeping bag, pushed right up against the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was being an adult,\u201d Bucky yawns. \u201cOne of us had to.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere isn\u2019t much room on the mattress but Bucky\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s spending the night on the other side of the room after a long day of arguing with Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you set an alarm?\u201d Bucky asks as he climbs into his sleeping bag. It\u2019s super warm and he pulls it up over his shoulders.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep,\u201d Steve says as he wraps his arms around Bucky and pulls him closer. There isn\u2019t enough room on the mattress to sleep without touching, but that\u2019s really not something Bucky\u2019s complaining about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool, thanks,\u201d Bucky hums, His eyes are closed and he can already feel himself drift off, despite the early hour. \u201cG\u2019night, Stevie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoodnight Buck,\u201d Steve whispers. Bucky falls asleep to the gentle press of Steve\u2019s lips in the back of his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky wakes up to the offensively loud blare of Steve\u2019s alarm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTurn it off,\u201d he grumbles. He\u2019s squished up against Steve, tucked into his sleeping bag. Steve\u2019s arms are around him and Bucky never wants to move again. Maybe they should sleep in sleeping bags every night, he\u2019s so comfortable and warm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re closer to it,\u201d Steve groans, pulling Bucky impossibly tighter in his arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd my only arm is under me. You turn it off,\u201d Bucky retorts. It\u2019s getting annoying and he really doesn\u2019t want to open his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Steve mutters, but he leans over and shuts it off anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Bucky asks, still not opening his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201c6,\u201d Steve says into Bucky\u2019s hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Stevie. We don\u2019t have to wake the kids up til after 7,\u201d Bucky whines. He could be  asleep .\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was planing on going for a run,\u201d Steve tells him without making a single effort to go for a run.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut,\u201d Bucky prompts when it\u2019s clear Steve\u2019s not getting up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I\u2019d rather just lie here with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a sap,\u201d Bucky says fondly, turning to face Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJoke\u2019s on you, you\u2019re stuck with me for life.\u201d Steve grins, kissing Bucky gently. \u201cUgh, how do I always forget you have the worst morning breath?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re such a sap,\u201d Bucky repeats as he pulls Steve in for another kiss.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteve heads for the showers at quarter-to-seven but Bucky stays in bed, soaking up the warmth Steve left behind. He must fall back to sleep because before he knows it, Steve\u2019s back in the room getting dressed with dripping hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should get up soon, Buck. The bus arrives in just over an hour. I\u2019m going to set up the breakfast.\u201d Steve says, pulling a jersey over his head. Bucky watches him through sleepy eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow about: no,\u201d Bucky offers. Steve rolls his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow about you do anyway?\u201d Steve laughs softly, crossing the small room to kiss Bucky on the forehead. \u201cC\u2019mon. If you get up now I\u2019ll plait your hair.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEver since Bucky saw Jay tie up her hair the other week Steve\u2019s been trying out different hairstyles on him. He\u2019s kinda rubbish at it but Bucky loves it all the same.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. I only have one hand so they\u2019d know it wasn\u2019t me who did it. Gotta be subtle, baby.\u201d Bucky mumbles, face still half smooshed in the pillow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood point. But you still gotta get up.\u201d Steve says, running his hand through Bucky\u2019s hair to get rid of the knots and tangles. As if that has ever helped Bucky wake up.\n\u00a0\nSteve seems to remember this after a minute and pulls his hand from Bucky\u2019s hair. Bucky lets out a small whine but Steve just laughs softly and leaves him alone in the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsshole.\u201d Bucky grumbles, even though there\u2019s no one to hear him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky actually can get up on time. He\u2019s not completely useless. He just prefers staying in bed.\n\u00a0\nBut he\u2019s got to sort out 50 teenagers, so he decides not to lay around for too much longer after Steve leaves, and heads to the showers before all the kids get up to use them. He\u2019s just drying off when he hears Steve knock on the doors down the hallway, rousing everyone from their sleep. Bucky\u2019s not jealous of that job in the slightest.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Bucky joins Steve in the kitchen, about half the kids are up and eating toast or cereal, inhaling enough coffee to put Bucky to shame.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid\u2019ya sleep well?\u201d Bucky asks the students as he passes them on his way to the coffee pots down the end.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike a baby,\u201d one of them replies.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou ever had a baby? They do not sleep well, let me tell you.\u201d Bucky mutters, pouring milk into his mug before downing the thing in one go.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have a baby?\u201d The kid asks, voice full of surprise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. And don\u2019t plan on it either.\u201d Bucky tells them, pouring himself another cup of coffee. Steve frowns at him, fitting him with his  I\u2019m Disappointed look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about you, Mr Rogers?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. And I\u2019m perfectly happy without being a dad.\u201d Steve says, snatching the coffee pots off Bucky. Bucky growls, but makes no move to stop him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bet you\u2019d be such a great dad,\u201d someone else sighs. \u201cWhat does your wife think?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this topic enough to both be sure we\u2019re happy without kids.\u201d Steve says reluctantly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business, really.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, come on, Rogers,\u201d Bucky teases. \u201cWe all want to hear about you and your beautiful Mrs Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMrs Rogers?\u201d Steve repeats with a wicked grin and a gleam in his eye. Bucky\u2019s face drops when he realises what he\u2019s said. \u201cMy  Mrs Rogers  is such a sweetheart, Barnes. She\u2019s the prettiest dame in all the world and I love my dearest  Mrs Rogers so goshdarm much.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Jake asks in a way too loud voice and messy bed hair. Nathan trails after him with a matching expression of confusion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Steve says, moving away from Bucky again. As soon as his back\u2019s turned, Bucky breaks into a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour boy Rogers over here,\u201d he says, jerking his chin in Steve\u2019s direction, \u201cwas just telling us about the love of his life.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour boy Rogers,\u201d Jake whispers to Nathan.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou and your love, you have it good?\u201d Bucky asks Steve with a leer. Steve spins around and grins at Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have the life I knew we would. My word is good,\u201d he sings, a tad off-key but beautiful all the same. \u201cHey there Delilah, I\u2019ve got so much left to say-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s what you do to me! Oh, it\u2019s what you do to me,\u201d Bucky cuts in with his  decent singing voice. The kids start tapping on the tables and singing along.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s what you do to me, oh, it\u2019s what you do to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA thousand miles seems pretty far, but they\u2019ve got plane and trains and and cars. I\u2019d walk to you if I had no other way. Our friends would all make fun of us and we\u2019ll just laugh along because we know that none of them have felt this way. Delilah, I can promise you that I can\u2019t remember the rest of the words,\u201d Steve trails off, just him left singing. Everyone\u2019s laughing and cheering and Bucky looks around their little audience.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you know that much of that song,\u201d Nathan laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s such a bad song.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed, huh?\u201d Jay adds. \u201cMr Barnes and Mr Rogers bonding over music.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not bonding,\u201d Bucky and Steve snap at the same time. Jay just raises an eyebrow at them, looking too much like Natasha for Bucky\u2019s liking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bus is leaving here in forty-five minutes. If you\u2019re not on it you\u2019re left behind and in a lot of trouble. Use the buddy-system if you have to, I don\u2019t care, just be on that bus.\u201d Bucky snaps, snatching Steve\u2019s honey toast off his plate as he passes him, stalking off to their room.\n\u00a0\nIf Steve put honey on it chances are he meant for Bucky to take it, anyway. Steve hates honey.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone makes it onto the bus on time and Bucky resumes his previous seat at the back of the bus. He doesn\u2019t bother with his headphones, not today. They\u2019re not driving for long enough, and even though he borrowed Steve\u2019s charger last night he can\u2019t be bothered with music at the moment anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Barnes?\u201d Jake asks, leaning over the back of the seat next to Bucky. Bucky looks at him but doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you met Mr Rogers\u2019s\u2026  wife ?\u201d The way he says \u201cwife\u201d is suspicious, except Bucky remembers his theory that Steve isn\u2019t married and he decides to play along.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Why would I?\u201d He says, tilting his head slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrue, true. Has he met your partner?\u201d Jake tries, clearly getting at something here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. They\u2019re acquainted. Where\u2019s this going?\u201d Bucky asks, narrowing his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJake, stop it. No one cares about your weird-ass theories.\u201d Nathan groans from his seat, throwing his arm across his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up, Nate.\u201d Jake hisses, grinning as he nudges his friend. \u201cMr Barnes, is Mr Rogers really married? Or is it a hoax?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDespite telling himself he wouldn\u2019t laugh, Bucky can\u2019t help the sound that escapes him. \u201cThis is the best thing I have ever heard,\u201d he says as he pretends to wipe a tear from his eye. \u201cStay golden.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky turns back to the window, ignoring Jake as he slumps back in his seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStay golden?\u201d He mutters to Nathan. \u201cWhat on earth is  that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt means I was right.\u201d Nathan sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe best part about this trip, Bucky decides, is the tour guides. They\u2019re met with a librarian when they step off the bus outside the Library of Congress just before 9.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d She greets, unnecessarily enthusiastic for such an early hour. Bucky squints through the sunlight, only pretending to listen. He\u2019s been here a few times before, he\u2019s not too fussed about the tour.\n\u00a0\nInstead Bucky lets his mind wander, thinking about sorting the dinner out for the kids. They get to wander around tonight, so long as they\u2019re back before it gets dark. They get ten dollars each for dinner and have to manage themselves. Bucky\u2019s pretty sure Steve got the cash out already but he\u2019ll have to check in with that later.\n\u00a0\nHe thinks of Spud and Nat, missing his dog even though he knows she\u2019s in good hands. She loves Lucky, too. She\u2019s probably having the time of her life with Nat and Clint. Bucky smiles to himself, thinking of the two dogs curled up in Lucky\u2019s bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr B.\u201d Jay whispers, nudging Bucky\u2019s side and pulling him out of his drifting thoughts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShh, listen,\u201d Bucky hushes. Jay rolls her eyes at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to listen to her if you can\u2019t pay attention either,\u201d Jay laughs under her breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the Jefferson Guided Tour and I can\u2019t get these stupid Hamilton songs out of my head,\u201d Bucky whispers in her ear. Jay snorts a laugh and covers it with a cough. Steve shoots them a  look .\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to behave ourselves here. Technically school groups have to have one adult to eight students, but Principle Fury pulled some strings and managed to convince the staff to give us a tour with one adult to 25 kids. Mainly because half of you are 18, but still. At least pretend to focus.\u201d Bucky tells her, nudging her to face the front again.\n\u00a0\nOnce he\u2019s satisfied Jay\u2019s paying enough attention, Bucky goes back to thinking about his dog.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Steve growls as soon as they\u2019re outside. \u201cYou acted like a child in there, constantly zoning out and fidgeting!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the tour was so boring!\u201d Bucky protests, shouldering past Steve and jogging down the steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNick Fury worked hard to make sure we could get that tour, and you completely embarrassed the whole school in there. I hope you\u2019re ashamed of yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNick Fury can kiss my ass,\u201d Bucky scoffs. Steve\u2019s just going overboard now, and while it\u2019s hilarious, the kids might pick up on it if he doesn\u2019t tone it down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJames!\u201d Steve gasps, grabbing Bucky\u2019s arm to stop him from running away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteven!\u201d Bucky hisses, twisting his arm out of Steve\u2019s grip. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve immediately drops Bucky\u2019s arm, but still follows him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are not finished here, Barnes.\u201d He warns, jabbing a finger in Bucky\u2019s direction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d Bucky spits back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a snack over on the grass. Follow Mr Barnes. At 11:30 we will walk over to the Smithsonian for the next part of our day.\u201d Steve calls out to the students. No one says anything and Bucky leads them over to the grass.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou enjoying this trip, Mr B?\u201d Jay asks, sitting next to Bucky in the shade and pulling out an apple from her bag.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDespite  some people ,\u201d Bucky glares at Steve, \u201cI am. But I am looking forward to going home tomorrow. How about you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fun. I always like trips. Do you miss your boyfriend?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky\u2019s eyes are still fixed on Steve, across the lawn laughing with Jake and Nathan and a bunch of other kids.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he sighs. \u201cAnd our dog.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJay\u2019s face lights up at that. \u201cWhat kind of dog do you have?\u201d She asks around a mouthful of apple.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s a Staffy Cross, total sweetheart,\u201d Bucky tells her with a small smile. Jay looks like she\u2019s about to say something but a girl Bucky\u2019s ashamed to admit he\u2019s never met flops down in her lap dramatically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Barnes,\u201d the girl asks. \u201cDo you have a favourite student?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Bucky says with a frown. It\u2019s a total lie, but she doesn\u2019t need to know. \u201cThat\u2019d be like you having a favourite teacher.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe all have favourite teachers,\u201d Jay laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHell yeah. Mr Wilson all the way.\u201d Jay\u2019s friend grins, holding her hand up for Jay to high-five. Jay ignores it, opting to plait braids into her hair instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSam\u2019s a chump,\u201d Bucky laughs, picking a handful of daisies for Jay to feed through the plaits. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s so clever.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s funny!\u201d The girl protests, grabbing Jay\u2019s abandoned apple and taking a bite.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s not Rumlow,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cThat guy\u2019s a jackass.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd a damn racist. He told me I\u2019d have to go home if I didn\u2019t sort out my hair. Said it\u2019s distracting to the class. He wanted me to cut it off.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re Pip?\u201d Bucky asks, and now that he\u2019s got a name to go with her face he thinks he does know who she is. Pip nods, jostling her hair from Jay\u2019s hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, I\u2019m sick of him. I\u2019m going to file a complaint when we get back.\u201d Bucky mutters under his breath. He\u2019s always been a dick to Bucky for being gay, and Bucky knows he\u2019d spout shit at Steve if he knew he was bi, too. Plus he sends girls out to \u201ccover up\u201d almost daily. Hearing about this, though? That\u2019s the last straw. This asshole shouldn\u2019t be allowed to work with kids if he\u2019s this intent on damaging their learning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Rogers hates him too,\u201d Jay offers, twisting a flower through Pip\u2019s curls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY\u2019know? I agree with Rogers on this one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d Jay and Pip say in unison.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna get away with this.\u201d Bucky promises. \u201cHe should\u2019ve been fired long ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI see how he\u2019s your favourite, Jayjay.\u201d Pip grins, reaching up to cup Jay\u2019s face. Jay blushes and Bucky looks away with a smile. Kids.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a half-hour walk from the Library of Congress to the National Museum of American History but fortunately it\u2019s a nice enough day and the kids all behave. Bucky\u2019s distinctly aware of Jay and Pip holding hands behind him as he leads the way and he doesn\u2019t even bother trying to hide his smile. He\u2019s happy for her, for them both.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIndependence Avenue. What a righteous name,\u201d Jay laughs as they make their way down the boulevard.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was originally called South B Street,\u201d Bucky tells them, looking over his shoulder as he walks. \u201cIt was renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931 when it was widened, and then again in 1934 to Independence Avenue.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy Independence?\u201d Pip asks with a slight frown.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Bucky counters. \u201cThere was talk of naming it Washington Avenue, but that was shut down. Probably a good thing, too. Everything here is named after him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, yeah, he was the first president.\u201d Jay points out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah yeah, whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe girls laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Rogers is handing out a list of questions for you to find answers for. Like before, complete them in groups or pairs, stick together, and try not to get lost. Mr Rogers and I will be floating from group to group. You can call us or text us if you need to, or report to the front desk and call us out on the speakers. If you do that as a joke, though, you will be in deep sh-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrouble.\u201d Steve butts in, flitting between the students with his questionnaires.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Bucky continues, ignoring Steve\u2019s interruption. \u201cAnd be back here by 4. That\u2019s four hours at this museum. There\u2019s a lot to do here, don\u2019t complain about being bored. There are cafes if you get hungry, plus you all have lunches. Don\u2019t eat them inside, it\u2019s a nice day and you can take breaks to have lunch out here. The staff know we\u2019re visiting so don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. And yes, there\u2019s free wifi.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a cheer from the students and Bucky waits for them to quieten down before dismissing them. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe should take a week off work, come stay down here and visit all the museums and monuments.\u201d Steve says once all the kids have disappeared inside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat is such a nerdy idea.\u201d Bucky laughs, leaning into Steve slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdmit it, you\u2019d love to.\u201d Steve grins, lacing their fingers and bring Bucky\u2019s hand to his lips to press a kiss to the back of it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything better,\u201d Bucky says. He can\u2019t even make it sound sarcastic, he really would love to do that with Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it, next holidays.\u201d Steve beams, dropping Bucky\u2019s hand and climbing the steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Bucky groans, but he\u2019s grinning. \u201cI love you so much, Stevie.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit, Buck, that\u2019s so gay!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call  me gay! You\u2019re the one who kissed me first!\u201d Bucky protests, following Steve up the steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes I can. You proposed, that\u2019s gayer.\u201d Steve argues.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and I regret it more and more with each passing day,\u201d Bucky mutters.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Steve insists. \u201cYou are gay, I\u2019m only bi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly bi? What the hell does that mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve just shrugs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Smithsonian is so much fun. Way better than the damn Library, that\u2019s for sure.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne day I\u2019m going to live in a museum.\u201d Bucky tells the kids in his group. It\u2019s Jay, Pip, Nathan, and Jake, and Bucky\u2019s having the time of his life. (Not that he\u2019s letting them know.) (They totally know.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re in the museum every day, won\u2019t that take away the magic?\u201d Jay points out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to crush the magic of a museum!\u201d Bucky dismisses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did it take us this long to realise you\u2019re not straight?\u201d Nathan laughs under his breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeats me, pal.\u201d Bucky grins, clapping him on the shoulder. Fuck his reputation, he\u2019s having a damn good time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bus arrives at 4:15 but they\u2019re not scheduled to leave until 4:30. Bucky\u2019s out the front, waiting for the last few kids to arrives, going over answers with some of the kids. They all seem to be having fun and there\u2019s a good mood in the air.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBarnes,\u201d Steve calls. \u201cDennis is here. Who are we missing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky looks down at the roll in his hand, simultaneously pleased they\u2019re only missing five kids and disappointed five kids still haven\u2019t returned 15 minutes after the deadline.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGroup C. You go put it on the speakers, I\u2019ll get everyone else sorted.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in front of students Steve does what Bucky tells him to do without arguing, and Bucky manages to get everyone on the bus with everything they brought with them in the morning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow was the museum?\u201d Dennis asks. Bucky stops at the driver seat to talk to him, not wanting to come off as rude.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d he grins. \u201cWay better than the library, that\u2019s for sure. How was your day?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDennis shrugs, as if that answers the question. Bucky just goes with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting on Rogers and five students, sorry.\u201d He says before heading to his seat at the back of the bus.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Steve to come running down the steps with the kids trailing behind him like a duck with her ducklings.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Steve huffs as he hops on the bus. Bucky checks his watch. 4:26. They\u2019re not late so Bucky doesn't comment on it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s nothing really to do, the kids are either in their rooms or out getting dinner, only a few sitting around in the hall. Bucky\u2019s in a chair but it\u2019s hard and plastic and he\u2019s not that comfortable. He really ought to get something decent on his phone but there\u2019s no internet here so it\u2019s not like he could do it now anyway. Instead, he sticks to Candy Crush.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBarnes, can you come here for a sec?\u201d Steve calls from the hallway. Bucky glances up at him then back down at his phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBusy,\u201d he lies. He\u2019s so bored.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long,\u201d Steve promises. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is really important.\u201d Bucky snaps, keeping his eyes glued to his phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing Candy Crush,\u201d Steve points out as he comes to stand over Bucky\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is more important than your little game.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFull offense, pal, but I don\u2019t exactly trust your judgement,\u201d Bucky snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust give me a hand then get back to it!\u201d Steve groans. There\u2019s only a handful of kids around but they\u2019re all pretending not to watch Steve and Bucky argue. It\u2019s wonderful.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, I don\u2019t exactly have an extra hand to spare. So do it yourself,\u201d Bucky mutters, swiping five candies to make a colour bomb. It gives him a high enough score to complete the level, though, so he gets up and follows Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis better be worth it,\u201d he growls as Steve leads him down the corridor to their room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou complain so much,\u201d Steve groans, opening the door to their room and letting Bucky go in first.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPshh,\u201d Bucky scoffs. \u201cMy guy, my buddy, my pal-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy Bucky,\u201d Steve interrupts, cutting Bucky off with a kiss.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky laughs, pulling away slightly. They\u2019re close enough for their noses to bump together and he\u2019s got his hand on the back of Steve\u2019s neck. \u201cCan\u2019t you wait, like, four hours?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve breaths, eyes flicking back to Bucky\u2019s lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf we come out looking like we\u2019ve been making out\u2026 They\u2019re teenagers, Steve. They\u2019re gonna notice.\u201d Bucky points out, his hand running up through Steve\u2019s hair. It\u2019s soft and falls through his fingers, longer than it\u2019s been in a while.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNoo,\u201d Steve whines, dropping his head to Bucky\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d Bucky says, cradling the back of Steve\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst part,\u201d Steve grumbles. He presses a kiss to Bucky\u2019s collarbone before pulling away with an exaggerated pout.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFour hours,\u201d Bucky promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re the only teachers on this trip,\u201d Steve admits when he comes to bed. \u201cImagine if we didn\u2019t even get the nights alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we could last three days without making out,\u201d Bucky laughs as Steve climbs on top of him. \u201cIt\u2019d suck, but it wouldn\u2019t actually kill us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d Steve snorts, planting his lips on Bucky\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo hickeys where I can\u2019t cover up,\u201d Bucky instructs. \u201cAlso, no sex on a school history trip.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo fun,\u201d Steve complains, but he moves down Bucky\u2019s body, mouth brushing over his ribs. Bucky jolts, fisting his hand in Steve\u2019s hair and pulling him up so their faces are together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you, Rogers. You know I\u2019m ticklish there!\u201d He gasps. Steve grins, looking so damn proud of himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just good like that,\u201d Steve grins. His eyes are bright and his hair\u2019s flopping over his forehead, and he\u2019s so damn beautiful Bucky\u2019s heart melts a tiny bit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known me for thirty years and we\u2019ve been together for over twenty. I think you kinda  have to know where my ticklish spots are by now.\u201d Bucky brings his hand up to Steve\u2019s face, softly tracing over his cheekbone and down his jaw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Steve whispers, pressing a kiss to Bucky\u2019s palm. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou stole my line,\u201d Bucky says weakly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you stole my heart,\u201d Steve replies. Bucky groans and rolls over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. Go sleep on the other bed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, Buck. Don\u2019t be like that.\u201d Steve laughs, getting up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was joking! Where are you going?\u201d Bucky asks, sitting up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Steve says with an amused smile. \u201cI\u2019m just getting the lights.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bucky says. The room drops into darkness and he can\u00a0just make out the vague shape of Steve hobbling back to their bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis mattress is tiny and shit, I slept awfully last night.\u201d He grumbles, climbing over Bucky to get in his sleeping bag.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSucks to be you. I slept so well,\u201d Bucky says as he shuffles closer to Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFigures. You had me pressed against the wall.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you complaining about me pressing you against a wall before,\u201d Bucky laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa ha. Your jokes are so funny.\u201d Steve deadpans. It\u2019s kind of lost in the way he pulls Bucky closer, though, and kisses his forehead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s alarm wakes them up again, but at 6:50 this time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go shower,\u201d Steve says, getting straight out of bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNooo,\u201d Bucky whines, but Steve\u2019s already gone. They\u2019re heading back today, and while Bucky\u2019s had a great time, he misses Spud. And privacy. (But mainly Spud.)\n\u00a0\nBucky must\u2019ve dozed off again because suddenly Steve\u2019s back, dripping wet and laughing at Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet up, loser,\u201d he laughs, chucking his towel at Bucky. Bucky scrunches his face as the wet fabric hits him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy does getting up suck so much?\u201d Bucky groans, flinging the towel to the floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re  weak . Come on, or you\u2019ll miss out on a shower.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucky manages to fit in a quick shower before it\u2019s time for Steve to get everyone up. They have to clean the place today, but all Bucky has to worry about is his and Steve\u2019s room, and he\u2019s fairly confident he can persuade Steve to do most of it. (It really only needs to be swept, anyway.)\n\u00a0\nHe decides to pack his bag now so he can spend longer zoning out over coffee without having to worry about Steve shouting at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, B, what time are we getting on the bus?\u201d Jay asks when Bucky finally makes it out into the hall for breakfast.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBus leaves at nine,\u201d he grunts. \u201cBut this place needs to be spotless for the next school to visit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAye aye, Captain,\u201d Jay says, and Bucky can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s more of a reflex than a voluntary motion, but his eyes flick to Steve.\n\u00a0\nJay notices. Of course she notices, these kids notice every damn interaction between Steve and Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBarnes is  not a captain,\u201d Steve laughs. Bucky doesn\u2019t say anything, just glares at Steve.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Jay asks with a raised eyebrow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Buck says at the same time as Steve says, \u201cSergeant Barnes vs Captain Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI outrank him,\u201d Steve adds, as if he needs to clarify.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck you. I lost my fucking arm, leave me alone.\u201d Bucky groans, standing up and moving his dishes to the sink.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook,\u201d Steve says, and oh God this is going to be good, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was your fault-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus Christ-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c-But maybe if you were good enough to make Captain you wouldn\u2019t have lost your arm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow has no one killed you yet?\u201d Bucky laughs. He\u2019s got to laugh, can\u2019t pretend it gets to him because it doesn\u2019t, and if he does that Steve will look irredeemable to the students. Steve\u2019s not that mean, and neither is Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I can actually defend myself,\u201d Steve snarks. \u201cUnlike some people here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWatch your damn back, Rogers.\u201d Bucky growls, stalking past him to make sure everyone\u2019s at least started packing up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d Steve calls after him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you wish it was!\u201d Bucky calls back, disappearing around the corner and breaking into a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr B, are you alright?\u201d Jay asks, jogging after him. Bucky spins on his heel to face her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jay. The arm\u2019s not a sensitive topic.\u201d (Anymore.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, good. But does he know that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky says softly. \u201cI know Steven G Rogers belongs in the pits of Hell, but that doesn't mean he\u2019s the devil himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJay blinks at him, unsure what to say. Bucky pats her on the shoulder before turning back around and heading down the hallway.\n\n\n\u00a0\nEverything\u2019s all tidied and clean and ready to go by 9, except Dennis doesn\u2019t arrive until quarter-past and Bucky can\u2019t help but be a bit annoyed with him. Their first tour doesn\u2019t start until ten so they won\u2019t be late or anything, but it\u2019s just rude, especially when Dennis doesn\u2019t mention it. Steve\u2019s frowning so hard it looks like his face is going to fall off and that in itself unsettles something within Bucky.\n\u00a0\nHe knows he\u2019s glaring, but fixes it on Steve because that way he can pass it off as leftover bitterness from their spat this morning. Steve looks up at him, catching his eye. Bucky tilts his head slightly towards Dennis and frowns harder. To anyone it will just look like he\u2019s scowling at Steve, but Bucky knows Steve gets him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get going,\u201d Steve calls out, and everyone piles their bags into the compartments under the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does the \u2018G\u2019 in  Steven G Rogers  stand for?\u201d Jake asks on the way to the Washington Monument. Bucky groans.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you even on about?\u201d He asks, not bothering to look at the kid.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou called Mr Rogers  Steven G Rogers to Jay before, back at the camp.\u201d Jake explains, leaning over the back of the seat next to Bucky. Nathan\u2019s probably rolling his eyes out of their sockets beside him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt stands for Gay because he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 loser,\u201d Bucky mutters.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon Barnes! You\u2019re gay, I\u2019m gay, even Nathan\u2019s-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not straight, buddy. Don\u2019t even.\u201d Jake laughs, losing focus for a minute. \u201cUs gays, we\u2019re the best,\u201d he continues, turning back to Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn right. Steven Goon Rogers. Steven Geezer Rogers.\u201d Bucky offers. \u201cSteven Goddamn Rogers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can hear you!\u201d Steve shouts from the front of the bus.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Bucky yells back. Jake laughs like nothing could possibly be better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey have a tour of the Washington Monument, which includes going in a crowded elevator (unfavourable) and visiting the two-part exhibition of Washington DC\u2019s history (extremely favourable).\n\u00a0\nBucky can do it, though. He\u2019s been doing it for years and it doesn\u2019t bother him too much anymore. He\u2019d just rather not.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s worth it, though, when he\u2019s 500 feet up looking out over the city. Washing DC fans out below him and Bucky wishes they didn\u2019t have to go up in two groups, wishes he could look over at Steve right now.  Next time  , he tells himself.  When you go on your holiday .\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Mr Barnes, this is what you were telling us about yesterday!\u201d Pip calls from across the room. \u201cYou were right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think I was l making it up?\u201d Bucky laughs, looking over her shoulder at the display on Independence Avenue.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, no. But\u2026 Maybe?\u201d Pip says with an almost-nervous laughter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Bucky replies drily. \u201cAppreciated.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are welcome, Ca- Sir. You\u2019re welcome, Sir.\u201d Pip stumbles. Jay laughs at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice save, moron.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSergeants are better than Captains, anyway,\u201d Bucky mutters, wandering off.\n\u00a0\n\n\nDennis isn\u2019t late this time, and Bucky\u2019s so relieved he could cry. He\u2019s Ready to go Home, with capital letters and all. Steve must be able to tell (who is Bucky kidding, of course Steve can tell) because he doesn\u2019t try pick a fight with Bucky, even when he trips over the steps to the bus and lets out a colourful string of swear words.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHer, Mr Barnes, we should play I-Spy,\u201d Jake grins, way too energetic for Bucky\u2019s old-man mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou go ahead, pal,\u201d he sighs, resting his head against the window. \u201cI\u2019m taking a nap.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe manages to sleep the rest of the way home.\n\n\n\u00a0\nEveryone\u2019s picked up by 5pm, leaving Steve and Bucky alone outside the entrance to the school.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe fucking made it,\u201d Steve sighs, leaning heavily into Bucky\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re not parents.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou and me both, buddy,\u201d Bucky laughs, wrapping his arm around Steve\u2019s back. \u201cYou carry the bags, I don\u2019t wanna let go of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve snorts ungracefully but does as he\u2019s told, leading Bucky back to their car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing we have to do tomorrow, though,\u201d Bucky says as Steve loads the car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve asks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTalk to Fury about Rumlow. It\u2019s been going on for too long, and if we team up together, we can\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI like the way you think,\u201d Steve grins, leaning in to kiss Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s something about the Principal's office that has always been daunting to Bucky. It originated\u00a0when he was a kid but he still can\u2019t seem to shake it. He spent a lot of time in the principal\u2019s office as a kid, being told off for starting fights or\u00a0finishing them.\n\u00a0\nJust like all those times all those years ago, Steve\u2019s sitting by his side as they face the principal together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Brock Rumlow in regards to his bias with the children.\u201d Steve says, not at all as uncomfortable as Bucky. Then again, he\u2019s never been one to shy away from trouble.\n\u00a0\nFury raises his eyebrow, a silent cue for them to continue.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoth Barnes and I have had multiple complaints throughout our time here about him, especially from our girls and people of colour. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware of this, but we both feel it necessary to bring it to your attention.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFury\u2019s frown deepens as Steve speaks, and by the time Steve\u2019s done Bucky\u2019s very glad Steve did the talking, and that Bucky\u2019s not on the receiving end of that face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call him down right now.\u201d Fury say, reaching for the phone on his desk.\n\u00a0\nThe three of them wait in awkward silence (although Bucky\u2019s probably the only one who feel awkward) for Rumlow to come down. Bucky sits in his seat, fiddling with the zip from his hoodie just for something to do.\n\u00a0\nRumlow\u2019s knock is loud and obtrusive, just like the man himself, and he doesn\u2019t wait for a response before barging in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNick.\u201d He greets, surprisingly friendly. He\u2019s smiling, too, which Bucky\u2019s never seen before.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Rumlow, please take a seat.\u201d Fury gestures to the spare seat on Steve\u2019s left, and Bucky internally sighs with relief that he\u2019s got Steve as a barrier. He can\u2019t  stand Brock Rumlow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d Rumlow asks, eyeing Steve and Bucky as he settles into the chair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve and James thought it was time to voice some concerns they\u2019ve felt for your students.\u201d Fury says, hands folded neatly on top of his desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy students? What about their students?\u201d Rumlow laughs, sharp and cruel. \u201cThese two can\u2019t even pretend to have it together for a single day, yet I\u2019m the one in trouble?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe relationship between Barnes and Rogers has nothing to do with this. It doesn\u2019t affect their teaching and I haven\u2019t had a single complaint about it from anyone. I have, however, received multiple complaints from your classes. You\u2019re a good teacher, but it would be irresponsible of me to ignore your behaviour for any longer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat behaviour?\u201d Rumlow scoffs. \u201cYou trust these two? Everyone at this school knows Rogers and Barnes can\u2019t agree on a damn thing-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhich is exactly why I realise I\u2019ve let this go on for too long. If both Rogers and Barnes agree on something enough to stand up for each other then I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t look into it.\u201d Fury cuts in, a fire in his eye to match his name. Rumlow seems to realise he\u2019s not getting out of this and sets his jaw, eyes flitting to the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRogers, Barnes. Thank you for your time. You may go.\u201d Fury dismisses, nodding to Steve and Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Bucky says, getting to his feet and stumbling out of the office. Steve doesn\u2019t say anything, just follows Bucky out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do I work at a school?\u201d Bucky mutters. \u201cI hate principals.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know. But it was the right thing to do,\u201d Steve sighs. Bucky wants to stay with him, calm down a bit with the comfort of his husband. Unfortunately, they\u2019re at school. Bucky nods to Steve before heading down the hallway and leaving him by Fury\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn email\u2019s sent out the next day saying Brock Rumlow\u2019s resigned and Luke Cage will be taking over his classes. Bucky breathes a sigh of relief.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteve's taken Spud out for a walk because despite the morning run the three of them went on, the dog had become restless again. Bucky would've gone with them but it had started to cloud over and his arm tingles when it rains, especially if he's exercising.\n\u00a0\nSo Bucky's alone in the house, just pottering about and enjoying the sound of the rain on the roof when the doorbell rings. He's not expecting anyone and the couple from next door only ever knock so he's \u00a0a bit confused as he makes his way to the door.\n\u00a0\nHe can't say he's not surprised when he opens the door to find Jay soaking wet and crying on his doorstep.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm s-sorry,\u201d she stammers. \u201cI had nowhere else to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome in, get out of the rain.\u201d Bucky says, waving her in and closing the door behind her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou pointed out your street and I recognised the car.\u201d Jay explains as Bucky leads her to the living room. There's drops running down her face but Bucky can't tell if they're tears or just from the rain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you like a tea or coffee?\u201d He offers, heading to the kitchen. It has an open plan layout so Bucky can still see her as he puts on the jug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTea, please,\u201d she says quietly. She's stopped shivering and just sits there on his couch, curled in on herself.\n\u00a0\nBucky doesn't say anything as the jugs boils, just waits for the ping and pours two mugs of tea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMilk and sugar?\u201d He asks, heading for the fridge.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoth. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky manages to bring both mugs to the couch without spilling anything and settles down next to Jay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asks gently. He doesn't want to pry, but she turned up on his doorstep crying in the rain so Bucky thinks he deserves at least some sort of explanation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI came out to my parents. It didn't go so well,\u201d Jay shrugs. She's still not looking at Bucky, hunched in on herself and cradling her tea in her hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit,\u201d Bucky mutters. \u201cWell, you can stay with us for as long as you need to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Mr B.\u201d Jay says, rubbing her face with her sleeve and finally looking him in the eye. \u201cWait- who's  us ?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe and my husband.\u201d Bucky says, the realisation that Jay doesn't know he's married to Steve suddenly dawning on him. This'll be fun.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're  married ?\u201d Jay exclaims, actually smiling a bit. \u201cHow did I not know you're married?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo left hand for a ring?\u201d Bucky shrugs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's hilarious,\u201d Jay deadpans. \u201cWhat's his name? Is he hot? How did you two meet? Wait, will he be okay with me here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe'll be fine, we've talked this over,\u201d Bucky assures her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow could you possibly have talked this over?\u201d Jay frowns, shifting uncomfortably. Shit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe's my husband, Jay. He notices when something's on my mind. I was just worried about you when you came out to me and talked to him about it. He said if you ever needed anywhere to stay I should offer you our spare room. Just if you needed it.\u201d Bucky's not sure what to say, because hearing it from Jay's mouth makes it feel a lot more creepy than intended. Luckily, Jay doesn't take it the wrong way.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's really sweet.\u201d She says, her eyes softening. She takes a sip from her tea, hiding a yawn behind the mug. \u201cSo. How did you meet?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone was kicking a dog, he saw red, shouted at them \u2018til he was blue, got punched until he was purple. I found him and patched him up. Rest is history, blah blah blah.\u201d Bucky says, waving his hand dismissively.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour first date was a back alley scrap?\u201d Jay laughs around another yawn.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Our first date was seven years after that. Who the hell dates when they're  six ?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jay gasps. \u201cYou're married to your childhood best friend. That is ridiculously cute. Mr B, how can someone so  soft look so scary and mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa ha, you're hilarious. Follow me, I'll show you the spare room.\u201d Bucky stands up, bringing his mug of tea with him. The rain is still pounding on the windows and Bucky smiles to himself, glad he's not caught out in that. Poor Steve. At least Spud will like it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo where's your husband now?\u201d Jay asks him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOut with our dog. He'll probably be home soon. Why, you desperate to meet him?\u201d Bucky snorts, pushing the door to the spare room open. It's simple, a double.bed in the corner, cream chest of drawers and a plain nightstand next to the bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou go all mushy when you talk about him,\u201d Jay shrugs. She toes her shoes off but doesn't move further into the room. \u201cHe offered me a place in his home without meeting me. He got beaten up for defending a stray. He sounds like a good guy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe best,\u201d Bucky confirms. He can feel his cheeks heating up but he doesn't give a damn. \u201cGet some rest, have a nap. I'll be in the other room if you need me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jay says, finally hopping onto the bed. \u201cThis means a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky just smiles at her.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoney, I'm ho-ome!\u201d Steve calls out in a shrill voice half an hour later.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, you're drenched. Decide to go for a swim?\u201d Bucky teases, kissing Steve hello. Spud pushes past them, her tail wagging happily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDry that dog before she gets the house all stinky.\u201d Steve says, running his hand through Bucky's hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo damn bossy.\u201d Bucky grins, leaning into the touch. \u201cYou got her wet, you dry her.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I wanna dry me.\u201d Steve whines, finally releasing Bucky and trailing after Spud.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy God, you're a baby.\u201d Bucky laughs, following Steve to the laundry. Spud\u2019s there waiting,her tongue hanging out of her mouth. She looks so happy it's impossible not to grin at the sight of her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho's a good girl?\u201d Steve coos, sitting on the ground with her and scratching behind her ears. Bucky watches them fondly from the doorway. \u201cYou are! Yes you are! You're so good and so smart, Spud. Nothing like Papa Bucky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuck a dick, Rogers.\u201d Bucky laughs from the doorway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's more your area of expertise,\u201d Steve shoots back. It's a total lie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou say that like you didn't wake me up this morning with your mouth on my dick.\u201d Bucky points out because, really, Steve?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d A third voice gasps and both Bucky and Steve spin around to see Jay standing there with her eyes wide and a hand over her mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat couldn't possibly have been a worse time.\u201d Bucky says, glancing between his shocked husband and horrified student. He was planning on telling Steve. In, like, one minute. He thought Jay would sleep for longer. Or be louder walking through the house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is my husband, Steve.\u201d Bucky continues lamely, gesturing from Steve to Jay. \u201cSteve, Jay is staying with us for an undefined length of time because her parents don't like that she's gay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr Rogers? You\u2019re  married  to  Mr Rogers ? This is some elaborate joke.\u201d Jay says, stumbling back with wide eyes. She hits the wall and stops moving, just standing there staring at them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, April Fools?\u201d Bucky tries. \u201cI\u2019m actually married to this asshole, surprise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll go make some coffee.\u201d Steve says, slipping past Bucky with a comforting squeeze to his shoulder. Spud goes to follow but gets distracted by the new person in her house and sits at Jay\u2019s feet, ears perked but patiently waiting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo ahead, pat her.\u201d Bucky says when Jay\u2019s eyes flit to the dog at her feet. Slowly, carefully, Jay slides down the wall and runs her hands across the short fur on Spud\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jay whispers, clinging tightly to Spud.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve and I have been best friends our whole lives and in love for most of it. People thought we meant it when we bickered at school, we didn\u2019t correct them. Things escalated and here we are.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou told Mr Rogers about me,\u201d Jay sobs. She\u2019s not crying, not tears, but it Breaks Bucky\u2019s heart all the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. I told my  husband  about a student I care about. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d Bucky says, no room in his voice for argument.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jay says, not looking at Bucky. Spud lays down and rolls over, showing Jay her tummy for scratches. Jay smiles at her and rubs her tummy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, some things are starting to make so much more sense now.\u201d Jay admits. \u201cThe dancing? That was suspicious.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky snorts. \u201cThat was a bit of a giveaway. But we couldn\u2019t just  not . Teaching Steve the Lindy Hop is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho else knows?\u201d Jay asks, still down on the floor with Spud.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNatasha. Sam Wilson. Fury, probably, but that\u2019s all. From the school, anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Okay,\u201d Jay says, letting out a deep breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Bucky says softly. \u201cLet\u2019s go into the other room.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to stay with us?\u201d Steve asks when they\u2019re all settled in the lounge. They\u2019re sharing a couch with Spud while Jay curls up in an armchair opposite them. Steve made her a cup of tea but Bucky\u2019s gone back to his coffee. \u201cYou can, you know that, right? Just because Buck and I don\u2019t hate each other doesn\u2019t mean you have to leave.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat makes, like, no sense.\u201d Bucky mutters into his mug. Steve very pointedly ignores him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to call Pip,\u201d Jay says, jumping on Steve\u2019s bandwagon and ignoring Bucky. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to her first but she lives across town, and I don\u2019t have any money and you\u2019re closer and I didn\u2019t really think about it-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bucky cuts in gently. \u201cJay, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here, it\u2019s much better than you being out in the rain alone, okay? Call Pip, use the spare room if you want.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJay nods, smiling weakly through fresh tears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispers as she slips out of the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s been through a storm today,\u201d Bucky sighs once the door shuts behind her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLiterally,\u201d Steve adds.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa, ha, Mr Funny-Man.\u201d Bucky teases, pulling Spud onto his lap so he can lay in her spot, head on Steve\u2019s thigh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo. We\u2019re no longer secretly married.\u201d Steve says after a moment of silence. Spud stretches out, laying her head on Bucky\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes we are. Only Jay knows. And Pip, I guess. But that\u2019s two people, not the entire student body.\u201d Bucky protests, bringing his hand to rest on Spud\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBucky, we\u2019ve been at this school for years. I know you know what the rumours are like.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s Jay and Pip. They\u2019re not bad,\u201d Bucky protests. Steve shakes his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good run. But maybe it wouldn\u2019t be too bad if the word got out\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteven Grant Rogers, are you backing down?\u201d Bucky mock-gasps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Steve says instantly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just tired of not being able to talk to you throughout the day, I\u2019m sick of people complaining about you to me because they think I want to hear it-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re clearly lying. No one ever complains about me.\u201d Bucky interrupts with a cocky grin. Steve flicks his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have to come out. And we are not going to stop the bickering because that was never exactly started in the first place. I\u2019m just saying we could stop acting so much and just be us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat does sound nice,\u201d Bucky agrees. Driving with Steve to work, grabbing lunch together. Closing the lift doors on each other and sneaking extra papers to mark into each other\u2019s piles. Nothing has to change, they just get to relax a bit more. \u201cWe could give it a try.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if worst comes to worst, we could pack up and move to DC. Or live in the mountains.\u201d Steve suggests, smiling wider. \u201cI vote DC, though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, you are such a nerd. You\u2019re a dork, an egg. Steven, you are-\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve cuts him off with a kiss. Bucky doesn\u2019t mind in the slightest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am coming back, loudly this time,\u201d Jay calls from behind the door. Steve sits back up with a soft chuckle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be talking about morning sex. That is not something I want to think about ever again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about DC, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Bucky assures her, sitting up slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, this is so weird.\u201d Jay says, scrunching up her face. \u201cSeeing you two together and not ripping each other to pieces. Am I honestly meant to believe you\u2019ve always been like this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess so? But you don\u2019t have to believe it. It won\u2019t change anything.\u201d Bucky shrugs, sitting up properly this time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPip will be here in about ten minutes,\u201d Jay says, changing the subject. \u201cThank you guys. It really means a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you thought to come here. And could recognise the car.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSteve gets the door when the doorbell rings because he\u2019s Pip\u2019s teacher, he\u2019s met Pip\u2019s mum for parent-teacher interviews.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou got everything?\u201d Bucky asks, standing with Jay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, didn\u2019t exactly have much.\u201d Jay points out with a sad smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, honey!\u201d Pip\u2019s mother coos, sweeping around the corning and gathering Jay in a hug. Jay hugs her back tight, clutching her like she\u2019s going to disappear any moment. Pip stands there awkwardly, a hand gently resting on Jay\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s got someone,\u201d Steve murmurs in Bucky\u2019s ear. Bucky nods, leaning into Steve\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Bucky agrees, blinking back tears. He\u2019s not going to cry, damn it.\n\u00a0\nExcept then Jay flings herself at Bucky, pulling him into a tight hug. She\u2019s fairly tall, head coming up to Bucky\u2019s nose, and he's thrown a bit off balance.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, B. I\u2019ll see you on Monday, I guess?\u201d She asks, pulling away from Bucky to look him in the eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t go blind or I go invisible,\u201d Bucky promises. He can feel tears prickling the back of his eyes but chooses to ignore them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mr Rogers,\u201d Jay adds, giving him a small wave before taking Pip\u2019s hand in her own and heading out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell are they doing living together?\u201d Pip hisses under her breath. Jay glances back at Bucky, looking for permission. He smiles at her and nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, let me tell you!\u201d She laughs, and the door shuts behind her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat a day,\u201d Steve sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey arrive around 8am on Monday morning together in Bucky\u2019s car. Bucky can\u2019t see anyone, but he doesn\u2019t doubt people are watching from the windows overlooking the carpark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre we really doing this?\u201d He asks, glancing over at Steve in the passenger seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe already let Jay tell Pip. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the whole school starts talking. Don\u2019t you wanna beat them to it?\u201d Steve\u2019s right, and the more Bucky thinks about it the more he wants to give it up. But now that\u2019s it\u2019s actually happening he can\u2019t help but feel a bit nervous.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. If you need me at any time I\u2019ll be just down the hall. Only, this time, you can actually come to me, okay?\u201d Steve soothes, resting his hand on Bucky\u2019s thigh. Bucky cover\u2019s Steve\u2019s hand with his own and smiles at his husband.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s get \u2018em.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn true high-school fashion, Bucky\u2019s classroom fills with hushed whispers as the students come in for first period. No one dares to say anything- not when Bucky refuses to crack a smile at any of them- but it\u2019s clear where their heads are all at.\n\u00a0\nBucky ignores them and teaches his lesson as usual. Really, nothing\u2019s changed.\n\u00a0\nSteve\u2019s in his room going over lesson plans at break time so Bucky brings him a coffee to keep him going.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s your morning going?\u201d He asks, perching himself on the edge of Steve\u2019s desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo many questions,\u201d Steve groans as he takes the coffee. \u201cWhy do they care so much?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBuddy, don\u2019t you start that now. We both know how much you loved them caring when they thought we hated each other.\u201d Bucky laughs, stealing the coffee back for a sip. He only bought the one, and while he could\u2019ve carried two, it\u2019s easier to just carry one.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do hate you.\u201d Steve grumbles, but his words are lost in the way he looks at Bucky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky smiles. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re interrupted by a knock on Steve\u2019s door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d Steve calls. Bucky flinches out of habit, ready to vault over Steve\u2019s desk, before he remember he doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s okay now.\n\u00a0\nThe door pushes open and Jake pokes his head through. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have a really important- holy  shit !\u201d\n\u00a0\nBucky glances at Steve with a raised eyebrow but doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNate! I told you, I  told you there was something going on with Mr Rogers\u2019 marriage!\u201d Jake calls over his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re right here.\u201d Steve says calmly. Jake\u2019s head snaps back around to him and he comes into the classroom, followed by Nathan.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but you never guessed it was  this .\u201d Nathan mutters, but he looks extremely amused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJake. You said you had a really important\u2026\u201d Steve prompts, leaning back in his swivelly chair. He takes a sip from his coffee and his wedding ring catches in the light.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally important history-related question. That was a lie. I just heard rumours that you arrived together today, and honestly, I died a little inside.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou got your answer. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Nathan sighs, grabbing Jake\u2019s hand and tugging him back towards the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo! I need more information!\u201d Jake protests.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLeave them  alone ! You don\u2019t want them knowing every aspect of your romantic life, so let them keep theirs private too.\u201d Nathan hisses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur romantic life is beautiful and the whole world should be obsessed with it.\u201d Jake scoffs, momentarily distracted enough for Nathan to push him out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsk Jay Boskur any questions you have!\u201d Bucky calls after them. Steve laughs into his coffee.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first mention of it I\u2019ve heard all day,\u201d Bucky admits when the door clicks shut again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cGod, my kids will hardly shut up, and all they know is I got a ride with you this morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMm, benefits of being a stone-cold terror.\u201d Bucky hums, getting to his feet. The bell\u2019s going to go soon, he has another class to teach. It\u2019s his senior class and he\u2019s actually kind of looking forward to it. These are the kids who\u2019ve seen him and Steve dance and sing together on the trip. They\u2019ve been here the longest, since Steve and Bucky even started.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee you in a couple of hours.\u201d Bucky says, heading to the door that leads to his classroom.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood fucking luck.\u201d Steve sighs, downing the last of his coffee.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBefore we get started,\u201d Bucky says to his class once they\u2019re all settled in. \u201cI will clarify something: today we are focusing on writing our essays. That means you don\u2019t need to talk to your peers, and it especially means you don\u2019t need to talk to your peers about my relationships with other teachers. Any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJake\u2019s hand shoots up. Of course it does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood. If you need help, I will help you. You may listen to music, spread out, do whatever it is you need to do to concentrate. Come write your name on the board if you\u2019re going to the library.\u201d Bucky instructs, ignoring Jake completely and opening up his laptop. A lot of students come up to write their name on the \u00a0board and Bucky knows less than half will actually go to the library, but if they chose to slack and their grade suffers because of it, it\u2019s their own damn fault.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMr B?\u201d Jay says quietly, coming up to Bucky\u2019s desk. She doesn\u2019t have her work with her so he guesses she\u2019s not going to be asking for help on her essay.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJay,\u201d he says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy does Jake keep asking me about you and Mr Rogers? Like, does he know about you? Does he know about me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll Jake knows is that me and Steve are married, and that you know more than anyone else. What you tell him is up to you.\u201d Bucky tells her quietly, glancing to where Jake\u2019s watching them from across the room.\n\u00a0\nJake catches his eye, bringing two fingers to his eyes then pointing them at Bucky, the universal sign for \u2018 I\u2019m watching you \u2019. Bucky flips him off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Jay asks with a frown. \u201cOne person finds out and three years of work is undone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s something we\u2019ve both wanted for a while. You just gave us an opening.\u201d Bucky admits. He enjoyed it, and he knows Steve did, too. But it was a little bit extreme and he\u2019s ready to live his life without wondering who\u2019s watching.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d He asks softly. Jay nods, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ve talked to my mum and she wants me to come home, but I don\u2019t think I want to. Pip\u2019s parents are letting me stay with them, and I\u2019ll be off to college soon. I guess it\u2019s a time for us both to step out and stop hiding, huh, B?\u201d Jay says with a smile. It\u2019s a tired smile, and she has bags under her eyes, but she looks happy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Jay.\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou know I\u2019m proud of you, right? What you\u2019ve just done- that isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt would've been a lot harder without you and Pip,\u201d Jay admits, eyes softening when she mentions her girlfriend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm glad you've got her. You keep her, yeah?\u201d Bucky grins, feeling the conversation coming to an end.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI plan on it,\u201d Jay promises.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d Bucky asks Steve at the end of the day. He's propped back against the car, soaking in the sunshine while he waits.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWeird.\u201d Steve says, his shadow falling over Bucky as he gets closer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood weird or bad weird?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Steve shrugs. \u201cToo many stares for my liking, but those will fade.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat's the good weird?\u201d Bucky asks, knowing exactly where this is going. There are people buzzing around, students and teachers alike, and Steve's pushing him up against their car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can kiss you in front of the whole school.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd he does, and it's wonderful, and Bucky doesn't give a shit."
