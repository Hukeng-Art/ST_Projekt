    "text": "Draco had always imagined that his soulmate would be his saving grace.\nEven when he was young, he\u2019d been under no illusions about what he was like \u2013 proud, yes, but not oblivious. He was spoiled and irritable and downright vindictive when angry, so he\u2019d always thought that it was lucky there was someone destined to love him regardless. Over the years several of these things changed (or were beaten out of him by the war), but the idea of a soulmate \u2013 someone who would love him in spite of the Mark on his arm and the many, many mistakes dotting his history \u2013 held fast.\nEven when the rest of the wizarding world ostracized him, Draco had always soothed himself with the promise that his soulmate was out there, waiting. One day he\u2019d meet someone or reconnect with someone and his string of fate would become visible to him, a thread connecting him to the person he was meant to love and who was meant to love him.\nThen, three months after he was officially released from Ministry custody, Draco attempts to make amends with Harry Potter and is told quite firmly that not only does Potter not want anything to do with him, but that he would also prefer that Draco stay away from him entirely.\nAt first, he doesn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d done all the right things \u2013 he\u2019d apologized after the war, been contrite and polite and had waved his metaphorical white flag. He\u2019d even been genuine about it. It isn\u2019t as though he\u2019s asking to be best friends. Still, though, Potter turns him away with a frown and eyes like steel, and Draco feels a sick lurch in his chest, in what feels like the core where his heart and magic meet.\nHe looks down, unable to meet Potter\u2019s eyes, trying to figure out what to say. It\u2019s at this moment when he realizes that there is a glossy red thread tied around his right pinky finger. He follows it with a growing sense of nausea only to find that the other end is tied to Potter\u2019s finger, turning grey and dead the closer it gets to his hand.\nHe stares, blank-faced. This moment was supposed to be like a fairy-tale, where Draco and his soulmate reconnect and then their soulbond snaps into place like fate. He has never even imagined that his moment of connection would be broken with an immediate rejection. The strange, sick feeling he\u2019d gotten \u2013 it had been the bond.\nHe can feel it, just like he\u2019d always been told he would. He can also feel where it\u2019s severed, cut at the wick.\nPotter looks down, appears to see nothing amiss, and then narrows his eyes like he thinks Draco\u2019s up to something. It occurs to him that Potter has no idea. He can\u2019t see the string, and doesn\u2019t have the faintest inkling that he is ensuring Draco a slow, agonizing death by rejecting their bond.\nDraco could say something. Should, even, for his own health; Potter has that notorious savior complex of his, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019d take it back, if it meant saving Draco\u2019s life. They could be friends, keep the bond platonic, and sustain it just enough to keep Draco alive.\nThe thing about that is that Draco will know for the rest of his days that given the choice, his soulmate wouldn\u2019t have chosen him. His one saving grace \u2013 the one thing that mattered enough for him to keep going, to keep bettering himself \u2013 would be a lie.\nHe knows that Potter, the one rejecting him and their bond, who doesn\u2019t even know\u2026 Potter will never feel a thing. He\u2019ll never know why. Draco will wither, but the bond that was broken before it could even touch Potter won\u2019t affect him.\nIt\u2019s rare, that Bonds are left one-sided like this. It takes a sharp, immediate rejection to break a bond before it\u2019s fully formed. If he leaves it like this now, it will stay broken and Potter will never know what he\u2019s done. Draco is forever changed, and will spend the rest of his days seeing Potter in this strange new light, knowing they could be perfect for one another, and Potter\u2026 will not.\nThe place where the bond is connected to his soul, the tug in his chest, feels leaden at the realization that if he speaks up, Potter will sacrifice his own happiness to tie himself to someone he hates. Neither of them would be happy. Draco would be unfulfilled and Potter would be miserable.\nMaybe before the bond Draco would have been selfish enough to say something.\n\u201cApologies, then,\u201d Draco says instead, stiffly. It comes out more pained than he would like. Then, he turns around and heads for the nearest floo out of the Ministry.\nIt\u2019s harder than it should be to say the words Malfoy Manor when it means that Potter will disappear from his sight.\n***\nDraco has a couple years. Soulmate rejections are slow deaths, and for the first couple months Draco\u2019s only symptoms are emotional. Immediate depression, mild anxiety. He\u2019s already familiar with those, anyway, and there is no one to tell even if he wanted to. No one to take care of him. His mother, father, and Vince are all dead. Pansy, Greg, and Theo are abroad with no intentions of ever returning to England. Blaise is married and, while he accepts his floo-calls, is typically far too busy with the business he\u2019s running with his wife in Germany. He lives in the Manor, drafty and huge as it is, alone. He misses Potter, which feels strangely natural, and spends a lot of time reliving the way that Potter had made him feel alive when they were \u201crivals\u201d during their Hogwarts days.\nHe goes to his Ministry check-ins and the job in the Ministry mailroom that was given to him as a rehabilitation requirement. He hears someone gossiping about how he looks about ready to kill himself.\nThe witch who says it claims she hopes he does sooner rather than later, because working next to a Death Eater gives her the creeps.\nThat one makes him put his head down in the middle of the day, thanking god they\u2019d put him in a cubicle more or less away from everyone else. His mail sorting waits half an hour while he stares at the red string tied around his pinky and tries to get his head on straight.\nThree months in, he runs into Hermione Granger \u2013 soon to be Weasley \u2013 in a muggle coffee shop. That\u2019s the only place he can go where he won\u2019t be refused service, and as a result he\u2019s gotten friendly with the muggle who serves his drinks. She\u2019s eighteen \u2013 only a few years younger than him \u2013 but he looks so much older now that when they meet she thinks he\u2019s closer to thirty than twenty. He doesn\u2019t remember looking so old only months before, but the bags under his eyes and the sallow tint to his skin that comes from underfeeding himself doesn\u2019t do him any favors. His lack of self-care isn\u2019t intentional. He\u2019s just tired.\nThe barista is holding out a straw for him when he hears a familiar voice say his name.\nHe turns to see Hermione Granger staring at him in disbelief, eyebrows furrowed. He can imagine she\u2019s surprised to see him in a muggle shop, but he finds that he can\u2019t bring himself to care. She\u2019s the least hostile of the Golden Trio, at least, so he nods at her in greeting. It\u2019s the best he can do.\n\u201cThanks, Mimi,\u201d he tells the barista, and she smiles at him as he unwraps his straw and slides it into his coffee. \u201cGoodbye, Granger,\u201d he adds in passing, and then is gone. She doesn\u2019t say anything else to him, but she watches him leave.\n***\nHe goes in for his next check in, wan and something close to lifeless, to find that Ronald Weasley is the new auror assigned to him. Weasley doesn\u2019t say anything at first, just glares and checks his wand as he is required to do. Draco doesn\u2019t say anything either, he just slumps in his chair and stares down at his string. He does that a lot as of late.\nWeasley marks off what he needs to \u2013 Draco doesn\u2019t know, they don\u2019t tell him \u2013 and then sets his clipboard down with a sharp thwap. It startles him out of his thoughts. \u201cSo my fianc\u00e9 tells me she saw you in muggle London. What were you doing?\u201d\nHe looks angry, suspicious. Draco suspects for a second that he was reassigned on purpose, that he asked to be in order to interrogate Draco.\n\u201cGetting coffee,\u201d Draco tells him honestly. There\u2019s no emotion to it. He blinks up at Weasley tiredly.\n\u201cWhy go to muggle London for coffee?\u201d Weasley asks him, gritting his teeth like he assumes Draco is avoiding the question. Draco sighs.\n\u201cI like iced coffee drinks,\u201d Draco says flatly. \u201cAnd there is one wizarding coffee shop in Diagon Alley, which wouldn\u2019t serve me water if I was dying of dehydration.\u201d\nWeasley doesn\u2019t look impressed. \u201cSo you\u2019re terrorizing muggle coffee people?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not terrorizing Mimi.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause in which Weasley just stares at him. Draco assumes he\u2019s confused. \u201cThe barista. Her name is Mimi.\u201d\nAnother long pause. \u201cHarry told me you tried to make nice with him. Does that have anything to do with making nice with muggles? Is this some kind of new leaf you\u2019re trying out?\u201d\nThe sound of Potter\u2019s name makes his chest throb. He glances down at his string. \u201cThere\u2019s no leaf. I\u2019m just trying to live my life.\u201d He sighs, a headache beginning to pound between his temples. \u201cWeasley, please. I\u2019m not up to anything except existing, and even that is starting to seem rather lackluster. There\u2019s nothing to interrogate, nothing I\u2019m hiding from you.\u201d Nothing except the red string of fate tying him to Weasley\u2019s best friend, of course, but that has no bearing on anyone except Draco. No one needs to know, especially not Weasley or his friends.\n\u201cI have an eye on you, Malfoy,\u201d he says, unmoved, and Draco shrugs listlessly.\nWeasley lets him leave.\n***\nThe depression doesn\u2019t get worse, per se, but it also doesn\u2019t get better. His days start to blur together, and every day he\u2019s more tired. He falls asleep in public and lies awake at night, and becomes more and more apathetic. He goes to work, is totally ignored by everyone he works with, and goes home to the Manor. There are days where he doesn\u2019t speak at all, not even in reply to his supervisor, Quinley. He gets away with this largely because they expect and even enjoy the idea that his spirit is broken, and so Quinley just nods and lets him reply in gestures when told to do (or not do) something.\nHe hasn\u2019t seen Granger again since the first time, but Weasley remains his check-in auror. Weasley doesn\u2019t even bother to glare anymore. He comes in with a blank expression and leaves with a conflicted one, getting more and more data every meeting, though Draco still has no idea what it is. The only person who talks to him with any intent (or kindness) is Mimi. No matter how exhausted, he can\u2019t stop himself from craving the sight of a friendly face.\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Mimi asks one day when he stops in. She asks it quietly, like she doesn\u2019t want to call attention to it, but he just shrugs. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost weight.\u201d She bites her lip when he just shrugs again.\nDraco makes to leave, but Mimi stops him.\n\u201cIf I give you one of our croissant sandwiches, will you stay for a bit and eat it?\u201d she asks gently, and Draco realizes she\u2019s worried he\u2019s starving himself. He gives her a small smile and agrees just to assuage her fears.\nTo be fair to Mimi, he really hasn\u2019t been eating much. He\u2019s not a very good cook, and all of the Manor\u2019s house elves have been requisitioned by the Ministry. He will sometimes grab lunch at work, and orders food for the Manor that he doesn\u2019t have to cook, but the end result is that his diet is limited and his appetite is nearly nonexistent.\nMimi continues to work while he eats, but it\u2019s nice that she keeps an eye on him. Her worry makes him smile a bit to himself. She waves at him when he leaves.\n***\nDraco doesn\u2019t seek Potter out, and never ventures into spaces where he spends his time. He doesn\u2019t know how his body will react to seeing Potter (how he will react) but he doesn\u2019t imagine it will be good.\nHe does, however, begin to see Weasley around regularly. Being his check-in auror, Weasley has also been stopping into to observe him while he works, which was something his previous auror had apparently been supposed to do and never had.\nAlong with Weasley\u2019s presence, Draco is also introduced to a new symptom of his broken bond: a constant feeling of cold that no warming charm will hit completely. He starts wearing cardigans and winter robes in September, when it barely warrants long sleeves.\nThe Manor is drafty and without house elves to keep the fires going, Draco finds himself falling asleep in front of his study fire more nights than not just because it\u2019s easier than trying to keep multiple rooms warm by himself. He keeps a quilt there now, made when his mother used quilting as a form of practice for fine magic. He remembers sitting with his head in her lap watching her needle re-thread, disappear, and reappear from one side of the fabric to the other.\nHe can feel her magic now, sometimes, when he has the quilt over his head and focuses. He\u2019s noticed that he\u2019s becoming more sensitive to magic as of late, and while he\u2019s sure that it\u2019s leading nowhere good, it\u2019s given him this one blessing.\nIt\u2019s been half a year. Draco sometimes finds himself playing with the string around his pinky like a nervous habit. Every now and again, he\u2019ll tug on it, but he never feels a tug back.\n***\nWeasley is waiting at his desk when Draco comes in one Friday morning. He tends to get there before everyone else, because he\u2019s rapidly turned into an insomniac and doing mindless repetitive work is the only thing he has going for him while he\u2019s spending his long hours awake. This said, it\u2019s somewhat impressive that Weasley is here before him.\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d Weasley says, and Draco remembers a time where he would have felt something more than a vague spark of huh. He would have been smug or proud or even irritated about Weasley coming to him for help once upon a time, but he doesn\u2019t have it in him.\nMaybe his coworkers are right \u2013 maybe his spirit is broken.\n\u201cWhat with?\u201d he says instead of voicing any of his thoughts. Weasley visibly startles. He\u2019d come in looking disgruntled, clearly expecting some kind of snark from Draco, but Draco doesn\u2019t have any to give. Besides, Weasley could literally get him thrown into Azkaban, and he only narrowly avoided that the first time with Potter\u2019s testimony at his trial.\nHe doubts Potter would give it again.\nWeasley shakes his surprise off. \u201cI ask this only because you work here in the mailroom and I trust you not to be one of the crazies trying to get into Harry\u2019s pants.\u201d\nDraco almost wants to laugh. He\u2019s never considered getting into Potter\u2019s pants, no, but for a split second he did have a moment where marrying the man seemed like a very real possibility, so Weasley really was batting a little too close to home.\nHe doesn\u2019t say any of that. \u201cPotter\u2019s getting fanmail, is he?\u201d Draco asks. He wouldn\u2019t know. He\u2019s not allowed to go anywhere near Potter\u2019s mail, which comes in such copious quantities that his supervisor\u2019s supervisor is assigned to his mail exclusively. Not even the Minister has a mailroom employee assigned only to his mail.\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting letters bordering on stalking and harassment,\u201d Weasley says flatly, unimpressed. \u201cWe can\u2019t exactly stop whoever they\u2019re coming from, and I don\u2019t trust the bint that\u2019s currently handling it considering that she\u2019s asked Harry out twice in the time he\u2019s worked in the auror office.\nDraco nods in understanding. \u201cAnd you think that I, the dog on the leash, have neither the motive nor the means to go against you.\u201d\nWeasley\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cThat response makes me wonder.\u201d\nDraco actually snorts. It might be the first emotion he\u2019s felt in months \u2013 a sharp, quick surge of incredulous humor. \u201cAuror Weasley,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI have no designs on your Potter. If you want me to handle his mail, I solemnly swear not to tamper with it.\u201d At least, he has no designs on Potter now. He might have, before Potter had severed their connection and left Draco for dead, but Draco has let his hopes die with his childish daydreams of true love.\nHe\u2019s not bitter, in spite of his own sharp phrasing. He\u2019s just aware is all.\nHe\u2019s mildly surprised himself when Weasley snorts in return. \u201cActually, I\u2019m asking you to tamper with it. I want all this creepy shit sorted out of his mail and fucking burned. I trust you\u2019ll find some pleasure in destroying Harry\u2019s love letters.\u201d\nWell. While not quite right and not for the reasons Weasley assumes, he\u2019s also not entirely wrong. Pleasure, no. Satisfaction? Perhaps.\nHe can\u2019t say no, anyroad. He knows how it works when a person with power over you asks you for a favor.\nLess than an hour later, Draco has an entire fucking bin of Potter\u2019s mail on his desk, and Weasley wasn\u2019t wrong. It is creepy. Draco\u2019s only been through fifteen envelopes so far and three of them have been love letters of the obsessive variety. Two of the three referenced other letters they\u2019ve sent him.\nHe puts a trace on letters with the same magical signature of the letters he\u2019s already pulled, and is able to eliminate another four letters total in the batch on his desk. He stares at what\u2019s left. It will take him all day to get through it, considering that unless they\u2019re sealed with official seals, he must open, read, and reseal everything that\u2019s left.\nThen he remembers why he\u2019s doing it.\nHe pictures Potter, the tightness of his face a striking contrast to his usual grins, and wonders how many of these letters have caused him to make that face again.\nHe\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s a decade-plus obsession or the soulbond that makes his chest tighten at the idea of Potter reading these sleazy, objectifying, often frightening letters. It seems like such a little thing, but if Draco is bothered just by reading them addressed to someone else\u2026\nHe stays an hour and a half late to finish Potter\u2019s mail for the day. Another small basket pops up as he\u2019s leaving.\nHe leaves it for tomorrow.\n***\nDraco is Potter\u2019s exclusive mail person for the next four months. He\u2019s not even sure Potter knows who\u2019s rifling through all his mail, and though part of him feels a sick lurch every time he thinks about how little he matters to his once-could-be-soulmate, he\u2019s also a little relieved by it.\nEven once his hands start shaking regularly, he still opens and reads and seals Potter\u2019s mail. There\u2019s something soothing about knowing Potter\u2019s schedule, what\u2019s going on in his life, all through the sharp strokes of Granger\u2019s pen, the invites, the inter-department notes about meetings and missions (what\u2019s not strictly confidential, anyway).\nWeasley comes in to check on him one day. When he arrives, there\u2019s a hurricane of mail around Draco\u2019s head. Fourteen letters neatly lined up mid-air are from the same person \u2013 the owner of three letters from the first day he\u2019d begun sorting Potter\u2019s mail. The writer is getting desperate. Draco doesn\u2019t know if she realizes her letters aren\u2019t being received. He also doesn\u2019t care.\n\u201cWeasley,\u201d Draco says, voice a little distant. He\u2019s focused on his task, but he\u2019s also not entirely in his head. He\u2019s felt floaty for days. This is the fifth major bout of illness he\u2019s had since the new year began in earnest. He wonders every now and again whether it\u2019s his broken bond making him more susceptible or the Manor\u2019s constant chill that\u2019s ruined his immune system, but the end result is the same and he doesn\u2019t quite care.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Weasley says, an eyebrow raised high into his fringe. He\u2019d begun using Draco\u2019s first name ages ago, the result of prolonged familiarity. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\nHe pauses, turning slowly. He looks up at Weasley through watery eyes. His fever has been kicking him in the ass, but his healer recommends that he stay away from Pepper-Up for a while. It\u2019s hard to abuse Pepper-Up, but he\u2019s found that it\u2019s not as effective as it should be for Draco, which his healer had shown concerns about at his last checkup.\nHe hasn\u2019t told anybody about the broken bond, though he\u2019s sure Healer Clearwater \u2013 the only healer at St. Mungo\u2019s willing to treat him - suspects. Without a letter about the circumstances, though, he can\u2019t get out of his mandatory work assignment, and so he soldiers on and wishes passively that his bond will finally put him in a coma sooner rather than later.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says once he realizes Weasley is just staring at him.\n\u201cSick?\u201d He nods. \u201cAgain?\u201d Another nod. Weasley sighs heavily. \u201cYou look like shit,\u201d he says again. \u201cI was going to go for lunch after stopping by here. Have you eaten?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco\u2019s not convinced he can keep anything down, and is about to say so when Weasley starts gesturing for him to stand. \u201cWeasley \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo, Draco. Shut up. We\u2019re going to get food and that\u2019s that.\u201d He mutters something under his breath about being unable to believe what he\u2019s doing, but Draco isn\u2019t particularly surprised. Weasley began acting as though he pitied Draco a month and a half into their working relationship, and now is a frequent observer of his unhealthy lifestyle and slow descent into hell. \u201cMerlin, can you move faster?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 no.\u201d\nHe knows that the place Weasley drags him to is wizarding, but doesn\u2019t argue. Let him find out what happens when a death eater walks into any establishment in wizarding London, he figures. Him and Granger, that is, he amends once Weasley leads him over to a booth where the almost-Weasley awaits.\nShe raises an eyebrow. \u201cRon. Malfoy.\u201d Draco nods at her in greeting like he had the day in the coffee shop, only the result this time is that he goes a little unsteady. Weasley grips his arm to keep him upright and makes an exasperated sound. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well, Malfoy,\u201d she says slowly once Draco gets himself sat and more or less stable.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Weasley agrees, nodding.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ill,\u201d Draco muttered, unsure of how to interact with these people in a semi-casual setting. Weasley is still technically his superior, but Granger is unknown territory. Best to treat her with the same deference he does Weasley, he figures.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve been ill,\u201d Granger says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re dying.\u201d She looks skeptically down at his hands, which tremble against the table top. He puts them down in his lap, out of sight.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very ill,\u201d he corrects, and doesn\u2019t acknowledge the fact that she\u2019s absolutely right.\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause in which Weasley and Granger share some sort of look, and then Granger says gently, \u201cThey have a soup that should be pretty easy on your stomach,\u201d and then orders it for him.\nDraco discovers that if surrounded by two-thirds of the Golden Trio, magical establishments will serve him. Who knew.\nThough lunch is awkward, he still feels comfortable enough in their presence \u2013 or tired enough to not care \u2013 to fall asleep.\nThey stay an extra half hour before waking him and returning with him to the Ministry. When they enter, the wards sizzle against his skin. For the first time, the magic sensitivity he\u2019s been developing hurts him, and he grits his teeth to keep from making a sound.\n***\nLunch with Weasley and Granger becomes a regular part of his week. He almost looks forward to it. After the second week, Granger attempts to get him to have real conversations with her, and his voice goes hoarse from how much more he\u2019s talking than usual.\nHe goes with Granger to the muggle coffee shop, and she watches him with a surprised expression as he talks to Mimi the barista, who welcomes him with a familiar greeting and a smile. Granger tells him she thinks he\u2019s changed, but he thinks he\u2019s been changed. He doesn\u2019t say it out loud, but he thinks it.\nWeasley stops in more and more to discuss the letters with him, because he apparently cares about Draco\u2019s opinion of Potter\u2019s stalkers. It\u2019s because of the frequency of his visits that Weasley is the first to realize when the bond starts eating his magic away.\nIt takes him several tries to incendio a pile of letters (larger than normal, thanks to Potter\u2019s recent success with a high-profile auror mission), and Weasley watches with his brows furrowed.\n\u201cHas that been happening a lot lately?\u201d he asks, and Draco shrugs. To be honest, even basic charms have been difficult for him lately. He\u2019s chalked it down to the exhaustion \u2013 the way his hands tremble, or the lack of sleep itself \u2013 but once Weasley says something, he realizes it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s not just a lack of control; it\u2019s a lack of magic. He can barely feel it \u2013 though he can feel the magic of others only too well.\nHe glances around at the letters stacked neatly on his desk. He\u2019d convinced himself he was too lazy and too tired to keep his floating organizational system up, but once brought to his attention, he sees what he\u2019s been denying.\n\u201cSorry, Weasley,\u201d Draco mutters. \u201cI\u2019m not well.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Weasley says. He incendios the next batch of letters, and the sparks of his magic make Draco hiss. Weasley just looks at him afterwards. \u201cYou\u2019ve been saying that a lot, lately. About time you go to a healer, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nDraco does.\n***\nHealer Clearwater looks at him with a very blank expression once he explains what\u2019s happening.\n\u201cThis entire past year?\u201d she asks. He nods. \u201cWhy come forward now?\u201d Her eyebrows are furrowed like Weasley\u2019s had been.\n\u201cI think my magic is going,\u201d he tells her, painfully honest. Her mouth drops open a little, and he has to swallow before continuing. \u201cIf it\u2019s not just the exhaustion, if it is a symptom of the bond\u2026 then I\u2019m going to need a note for my work assignment.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to work much longer if your magic is starting to deteriorate,\u201d she agrees, point-blank. \u201cIt\u2019s typically the turning point for bond rejection. You\u2019ll be housebound before Christmas.\u201d\nShe\u2019s giving him something like four months, he realizes, doing the math. Four months of having a real life. Four months before the clock really starts ticking down.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back when it starts to get to be too much,\u201d he tells her, and she purses her lips before nodding.\nShe stops him when he stands, ready to leave. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asks, and he\u2019s surprised to see that she looks almost upset. \u201cDo they know? Have you talked to them?\u201d\nHe wonders if she\u2019s remembering the twelve year old who\u2019d had a crush on her, who\u2019d slipped away from his friends to ask for her tutoring help in the library as a way to spend time with her. He\u2019d been spoilt and bratty, sure, but he\u2019d also been soft as a kid, and had spent weeks trying to charm her before she\u2019d gently told him that she was both too old for him and interested in someone else.\nPenelope is too kind to him, even now. He hasn\u2019t been that kid in a while now, and he has the Mark to prove it. He is a man who probably deserves this. \u201cHe\u2019s better off not knowing,\u201d Draco tells her, and slips out of the room.\nWhen he goes home that night, he lays down and covers himself in the quilt his mother made. The residual magic clinging to it makes his skin burn instead of comforts him, and he cries himself to sleep in front of the fire he barely managed to start with the quilt abandoned on the couch. He wakes up cold.\n***\nIn early September, Weasley invites him out for lunch, like he does every couple days. He almost declines, but there\u2019s something about the way Weasley invites him that seems shifty. He wants to know what\u2019s going on, and so he agrees with a dubious expression.\nHe carries a walking stick now. He pretends it\u2019s for fashion, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the clicking of the stick that alerts Potter and Granger when Weasley leads him to the table they normally share at The Camelia, Granger\u2019s favorite spot for lunch. Potter looks at Weasley in disbelief, but Draco doesn\u2019t say anything. Granger scoots down the booth and lets Draco take the aisle seat. Draco orders quietly, sits quietly, and shivers quietly as he is wont to do. Granger tries to drag him into conversation multiple times, but he dodges with one-word answers.\nHe feels both alive and dead, tortured and at ease, having Potter so close. With his hands in his lap, he tugs on his string, which \u2013 he\u2019s noticed with a feeling of pure agony \u2013 has begun to fade to a brownish-pink, like blood on cloth. Potter doesn\u2019t react. He likely can\u2019t even feel the string, though Draco can see where they connect.\nFinally, Hermione sighs and gives up on making him talk. Potter\u2019s been watching them interact (shooting incredulous looks at Weasley every few minutes) with a stony expression, but there\u2019s something that sparks in his bright eyes once Granger asks, \u201cWarming charm?\u201d\nPotter\u2019s eyes bore into him when he nods gratefully and sharpen when Granger\u2019s charm visibly hurts him, though Granger and Weasley have both learned not to ask. He\u2019s cold enough to accept every time she goes to renew the charm, even though the magic bites. The rest of lunch is awkward and passes quickly, but Draco keeps feeling Potter\u2019s eyes on him.\nPotter doesn\u2019t say anything when Weasley apparates him back to the Ministry, but he watches. Draco wonders what he sees.\n***\nDraco has a severe sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when he arrives at his cubicle the next day to find Harry Potter leaning against his desk. There is a stack of letters in his fist \u2013 stalker love letters that Draco has been waiting for Weasley to visit to burn. It\u2019s easier to just incendio in bulk instead of tear each letter apart by hand.\nPotter glares at him when he approaches, watching in peripheral as the string gets shorter and shorter as the distance between them disappears. \u201cYou\u2019re the bloke assigned to my mail?\u201d\nDraco doesn\u2019t bother to defend himself. He just nods. \u201cWeasley assigned me to it ages ago. Months ago.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s jaw clenches. Draco had thought, before yesterday, that he\u2019d almost forgotten what Potter looked like, but now he knows that he couldn\u2019t. The way Potter\u2019s dark hair would cover his scar if not for the way the lightning pattern darts down into his eyebrow and disrupts the hair growth there, or how square his jaw is, or how his bronze skin glows with the remains of his summer tan \u2013 these are all things that are seared into Draco\u2019s memory.\nThis is the soulmate he will never have.\n\u201cI hate knowing that someone goes through my mail,\u201d Potter tells him firmly, as though that affects Draco at all. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion of privacy.\u201d\nDraco sighs. He looks up at Potter with weary eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way. You\u2019re a public figure and your friend worries for you. He asked that I dispose of the stalker-letters and I rather fancy not pissing off the auror that determines whether or not I walk free, so I complied.\u201d\nPotter just stares at him for a long moment. \u201cWhat the bloody hell is wrong with you?\u201d he asks \u2013 barks, almost \u2013 and then to Draco\u2019s confusion he\u2019s shifting out of Draco\u2019s cubicle, spinning Draco\u2019s chair to face him in the process, and gestures wildly for Draco to sit down. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to collapse.\u201d\nDraco cautiously sits, and the strain in his legs eases. He sets his walking stick against the wall.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Potter asks once he\u2019s taken a deep breath and is able to speak without hollering. \u201cSomething feels off.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re asking instead of following me around,\u201d Draco says, and Potter\u2019s jaw clenches again. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re dying,\u201d he says, accusatory, much like Granger had that first lunch together.\nDraco, taken aback, just looks up at him with huge grey eyes. He probably looks haunted, is how he looks, but something in his expression must give him away because Potter\u2019s expression twists.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dying,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s not a question. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nHe sighs again, slumping a little in his chair. No point in pretenses. \u201cQuite.\u201d\nPotter leans against the wall opposite his cubicle. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cMy healer knows,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone else to tell, Potter.\u201d Potter scoffs, but Draco can\u2019t read if it\u2019s unimpressed or unhappy or something else.\n\u201cHermione and Ron seem to like you well enough,\u201d Potter tells him, sounding something close to huffy about it. He doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do with Draco\u2019s lack of fight. \u201cThey invite you to lunch and cast warming charms for you \u2013 which, what the hell is that about? Hermione kept your warming charms up the entire time we were at the restaurant yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cGranger and Weasley pity me,\u201d Draco replies frankly. He doesn\u2019t answer the question about the warming charms. Best not to give himself away. Potter\u2019s not Granger, but he\u2019s also not stupid, and if Draco gives him enough clues he\u2019s sure the man will figure out his condition. He\u2019s positive Granger has already, which means that if he figures it out he\u2019ll get a confirmation before too long.\nPotter surprises him with insightfulness at the exact wrong time. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with your magic, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he asks, and the hostility in his face and posture finally melts away. \u201cMerlin, what\u2019s happening to you?\u201d He looks lost.\nDraco feels his chest warm slightly at the hint of concern. Trust Potter to show it even to an old enemy. \u201cI\u2019m not up to anything this time, Potter,\u201d Draco tells him, probably too open. His voice sounds raw. \u201cI\u2019m just dying. Let it be.\u201d His over-sensitive skin feels a flare of Potter\u2019s magic. It\u2019s the first time in a long while that the touch of magic hasn\u2019t felt like fiendfire.\nThen he turns away and waits for Potter to leave.\nWhen he goes, his work seems duller and quieter than it ever had before.\n***\nWeasley stomps up to his front door that night. Draco knows he\u2019s coming before he would have even before he lost his magic \u2013 the wards are suffocating him more and more every day, and when the chime at Weasley\u2019s arrival hits him it knocks him breathless with pain.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dying?\u201d Weasley asks, a demand in his voice, when Draco opens the door. \u201cWhat the fuck, Malfoy? I knew you were sick but why wouldn\u2019t you tell us how bad it was?\u201d\nDraco coughs a little, his chest tight. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s getting ill again, but doesn\u2019t say anything.\nWeasley deflates when Draco just looks at him. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you say something?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asks, confused. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone would care.\u201d\nWeasley glares at him. \u201cBecause we\u2019re fucking friends, you berk. Of course I\u2019d care if you died \u2013 it shocks me, too, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019re so oblivious that you didn\u2019t even know!\u201d\nDraco just blinks at him for a long moment. \u201cYou consider me your friend.\u201d\nWeasley sighs. \u201cYeah, you git, in spite of everything, I do. I kind of felt bad for you at first, but once we started going to lunch together every week\u2026 did you really not know?\u201d Draco shrugged helplessly. \u201cWhy did you think we invited you out all the time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Draco says. \u201cTo keep an eye on me? Because you were suspicious of me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I kind of like you, idiot,\u201d Weasley tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of funny and usually thoughtful, and you\u2019re rarely a prick anymore.\u201d\nDraco takes a long breath in and lets it out slowly. He doesn\u2019t know how to respond. After a moment, he shrugs again awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the exhaustion,\u201d he tries, and Weasley presses his lips together. He can\u2019t tell if Weasley is smothering a laugh or an angry sound. \u201cWeasley\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDraco.\u201d\n\u201cRon,\u201d he corrects, still awkward, and then says softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. I didn\u2019t think it would matter.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d Ron asks, and Draco feels the last of his walls come down. He only has the one thing to hide now, and it\u2019s not like posturing or appearances will save him.\n\u201cA little over a year,\u201d he admits. Ron sucks in a sharp breath, and Draco silently leads him up to the study. It\u2019s freezing, to be honest; he\u2019s not good at building or stoking fires by hand, and he can\u2019t access his magic at all anymore. Before he can ask, Draco sits Ron down on the sofa he sleeps on and tells him the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s a rejected soulbond.\u201d\nRon takes that in.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, like Potter had earlier that day. Draco almost laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Draco.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he agrees, sitting down in an armchair. \u201cBut I can\u2019t change it. I was rejected quite thoroughly \u2013 no point in hoping they\u2019ll change their mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Ron asks, and when Draco raises an eyebrow with a wan smile, he clarifies, \u201cWhy did they reject you? Surely your soulmate wouldn\u2019t want you dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Draco says. Ron clearly notices his pronoun slip, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. \u201cHe cut the bond off before it could even form on his end. It\u2019s interesting, really \u2013 my string\u2026\u201d He raises his hand, wiggles his pinky. \u201cIt used to be red, and faded to grey on his end. My end is fading, too, now, though I\u2019m fairly sure that it\u2019s because of my health rather than a lack of feeling.\u201d\n\u201cYou should tell him,\u201d Ron says, appearing dumbfounded. \u201cBroken bonds are meant to be agony, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nDraco just looks at him for a minute. \u201cRon. It\u2019s over. I\u2019m in agony anyway.\u201d He stares into the weak fire he\u2019d managed to keep going. It gives off very little heat. \u201cI don\u2019t have much longer, anyway. My healer says I\u2019ll be bedridden by Christmas, and everyone knows that bond death comes quickly after that.\u201d\nRon swallows. Draco glances at him, noting with some surprise that Ron looks as though he might cry. He doesn\u2019t like that Ron\u2019s upset, but at the same time, he realizes that just isn\u2019t.\nHe\u2019s had a year to come to terms with this \u2013 a year of avoiding the problem \u2013 but now that he can\u2019t any longer, he\u2019s finding that there\u2019s something cathartic about being up front about it.\nThere\u2019s also something cathartic about being a part of Potter\u2019s life, even in a small capacity. Avoiding him worked fine, but having him around is surprisingly good for keeping Draco\u2019s head on straight. He\u2019s seen Potter and didn\u2019t fall apart or spill his secret. Maybe he misses what he never had, but he\u2019s still functioning. The fear of what would happen if they met is gone \u2013 he knows that in spite of the ache, he\u2019ll keep functioning.\nHe\u2019ll function until he can\u2019t.\nHe smiles thinly and stands. \u201cWould you like tea?\u201d It\u2019s one of the few things he knows how to make satisfactorily, and one of the few he can both stomach and enjoy nowadays.\nRon nods. They drink it in silence.\n***\nIn spite of everything, Draco finds himself genuinely shocked when he joins Ron and Hermione for lunch the next Monday only to see Harry Potter sitting at their table awkwardly yet again.\n\u201cHi, Malfoy,\u201d Potter greets him, a little stiff but not unfriendly.\nDraco pauses, and Ron turns a suspicious eye on him, so he kicks himself into gear and nods in greeting. \u201cPotter,\u201d he says aloud, coughs weakly, and takes his customary seat next to Hermione. Both she and Ron are staring at him like he\u2019s a zoo creature. He sighs. \u201cYes, we all know I\u2019m dying now. It\u2019s splendid. Can we stop acting like I\u2019m going to keel over on sight?\u201d\nHermione sighs. To her credit, she doesn\u2019t pretend for a second that wasn\u2019t what she was doing. \u201cYou should have told us.\u201d He figured that Ron would tell her and Potter the second he\u2019d returned home, and isn\u2019t surprised at all.\nHe sneezes. It\u2019s kind of pitiful the way it makes his whole body ache at the movement. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t figure it out ages ago,\u201d he says, wiping his nose with a handkerchief.\nPotter, to his surprise, just nods. \u201cIf I figured it out within five minutes of being alone with him, it\u2019s probably pretty obvious.\u201d\nHermione makes a face. \u201cThere\u2019s you being ill and you having a rejected soulbond, Draco. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Her irritation slips away. He\u2019s left only with the sight of her genuine sadness \u2013 the face of someone mourning. He\u2019s not even dead yet, nor does he think he\u2019s really someone to mourn\u2026 but for some reason, both her and Ron have made that same face.\nHe wonders if the gods are laughing at him, sitting here with his childhood rivals, his only friends.\n\u201cMy soulbond is my business,\u201d he tells her instead of voicing his self-deprication.\n\u201cMate, seeing you suffer is hard,\u201d Ron says, wincing when Potter looks at him like he\u2019s lost his mind. Draco winces a bit too at Potter\u2019s reaction, though he tries to hold it in. \u201cI thought it was kind of funny, at first \u2013 you had been so high and mighty \u2013 but\u2026\u201d\nDraco manages an eye roll. \u201cThanks ever so.\u201d\nRon huffs. \u201cYou know what I mean. Even if we still didn\u2019t get along, I wouldn\u2019t wish a rejected bond on anyone. That\u2019s a shitty way to go \u2013 it\u2019s like double the shit. You die and it\u2019s because of something that was supposed to make your life better.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re helping tremendously by reminding me how terrible my lot in life is, thanks again. Really piling it on with the comfort, Weasley.\u201d\nRon goes to argue with him \u2013 expand on his point, perhaps, though Draco has no interest in hearing it, but luckily their usual waiter stops by. He takes their order, smiling a little wider at Potter, and leaves.\nRon has lost the wind of his argument, but it still startles Draco that it\u2019s Potter who breaks the silence that follows.\n\u201cWhy are soulbonds such a big deal?\u201d he asks, and all three of them stare at him. \u201cWhat? I came from a muggle background and I don\u2019t research the hell out of things like you do, Herm. I get that having a soulmate is a good thing, but\u2026\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. What makes a rejected bond extra terrible?\u201d\nDraco doesn\u2019t think he can speak. When she glances at him, Hermione nods and answers for him. \u201cA soulmate isn\u2019t just a good thing, Harry. It\u2019s a permanent bond that seals two people together in literally destined love \u2013 it\u2019s the one person on the planet meant to compliment you and love you unconditionally. Rejected soulbonds really only happen when someone is rejected before it can fully form \u2013 like if you get hit on at the bar and shoot someone down immediately without talking to them or giving them a shot. Once it\u2019s in place, it\u2019s hardly ever severed because it\u2019s so strong.\u201d\n\u201cWizarding children are raised on soulmate stories,\u201d Ron adds, a little wistfully. Draco watches Hermione\u2019s expression, and feels faintly proud of her when she doesn\u2019t react. She and Ron aren\u2019t soulmates, he knows, though they\u2019ve decided their love is worth it. That can be a hard thing to reconcile in and of itself. \u201cThere are people who wait their entire lives to find their soulmates without dating or loving anyone else. To be rejected by someone who\u2019s supposed to love you more than anyone else in the world\u2026\u201d He glances at Draco, who looks away. He can\u2019t stand being pitied, though he understands it can\u2019t be helped.\n\u201cIt makes you feel like dying,\u201d Draco says, abrupt. He hadn\u2019t meant to start speaking, but now he can\u2019t stop and the words spill out like water. \u201cThe second you feel the bond sever, it makes you want to die. You can always feel it like a hole in your chest where your soul is supposed to be, but the rejecting partner\u2026 if you don\u2019t tell them, they\u2019ll never know. They won\u2019t feel it.\u201d He glances down at his pale hands, at the fading string. \u201cYou can see the fate string connecting you, but it turns grey on their finger. If they don\u2019t take it back and seal the bond, then your end of the string will eventually fade from red to grey, too, and you\u2019ll die. You\u2019ll get sick and grieve over them until you die, and you won\u2019t even be able to hold it against them because all you\u2019ll want is to be with them and make them happy.\u201d\nHe can\u2019t take his eyes off his rust-brown string.\n\u201cYou miss them, then?\u201d Potter asks, the words coming out like he didn\u2019t even make a conscious decision to say them \u2013 like they just slipped out.\nHe looks up and meets Potter\u2019s gaze. He can\u2019t imagine what his face looks like. \u201cI will grieve over him and our bond until they day I die,\u201d he says, unintentionally grave, and then he wrenches his gaze away and stands. He leans heavily on his cane as he nods his head to Ron and Hermione. \u201cI\u2019m headed back to the Ministry. I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t stop him, but he feels their eyes on his back until he leaves.\n***\nDraco can feel the bond tearing him down piece by piece. He\u2019d never thought there was a feeling worse than the pain he felt when he took the dark mark, but he was wrong. What he feels now is the literal rending of his soul into pieces, and he can\u2019t even put into words why he breaks down crying in the middle of the work day from the pain. He begs out of lunch dates to the point that both Ron and Hermione start visiting him instead of going out. He frequently has to jerk his head up and pretend that he wasn\u2019t on the verge of passing out before they\u2019d arrived. He thinks Hermione sees through him \u2013 that she knows he\u2019s getting worse \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t have proof, and she hasn\u2019t cornered him about it.\nThen, Potter starts visiting with them.\nThe first day he shows up, Draco doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s there at first. He greets Ron and Hermione tiredly and chats with Ron about one of Potter\u2019s frequent stalker writers before he sees a familiar head of messy hair. He zeros in on Potter, standing awkwardly outside of Draco\u2019s cubicle. His glasses are slipping down his nose. Draco hates that the sight of him almost makes him smile.\nDraco pauses then examines the area. There\u2019s not enough room for four grown adults, even if one of them is thin to the point of emaciation.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the lounge,\u201d he suggests instead of calling out Potter\u2019s loitering. \u201cWe can\u2019t all fit down here.\u201d\nIt occurs to him that this is the first time all day that he\u2019s felt well enough to wander out of his cubicle. He\u2019s sure that both Ron and Hermione have picked up on this, because Hermione lights up, looking hopeful.\nThey follow him out of the mail room, and it occurs to Draco that this will be the first time he\u2019s ever even stepped into the lounge. He avoids his coworkers with everything he\u2019s got, and they avoid him \u2013 he\u2019s never been tempted to visit. The free coffee wasn\u2019t worth it.\nWhen he opens the door and steps in, there are two of his coworkers sitting on a couch talking quietly. There\u2019s plenty of room for him and the golden trio, but at the sight of him, one of the women\u2019s faces screw up.\n\u201cWe\u2019re busy,\u201d she says. Her friend nods next to her, uncomfortable. Draco can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the animosity or his presence that makes her wince. \u201cWe\u2019re using the lounge.\u201d\nNormally, Draco would slink away and not respond, but his only two friends and his soulmate are standing behind him. He grits his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to disturb you \u2013 we just want to spend lunch together.\u201d\n\u201cSpend it elsewhere,\u201d the woman says. It comes out with a sneer. Draco realizes he doesn\u2019t even know her name, but she knows his \u2013 she seems to know all about him. \u201cNot that they\u2019d want to see your face anywhere else. Death eater.\u201d\nThe woman next to her takes a sharp breath, and Draco just stops breathing entirely. Humiliation burns through him, makes him wonder if this is the moment that the three behind him realize just who they\u2019ve been making friends with. What that says about them.\nThere\u2019s a long, ugly moment of silence, and then Potter speaks up from behind him. A hand gently comes up to push him to the side. He finds that when he\u2019s moved sideways, there\u2019s another hand on the opposite shoulder to keep him from toppling over. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hold up?\u201d Potter asks, voice very bland.\nIt\u2019s obvious he heard the exchange.\n\u201cMr. Potter,\u201d the woman says. \u201cWe\u2019re just \u2013\u201c\n\u201cChatting during your lunch break,\u201d he interrupts, moving Draco aside (gentle hands still on his shoulders) so he can move forward into the lounge. \u201cWhich is what we want to do. Glad we got that settled.\u201d\nHis eyes dare her to argue. She goes quiet, and Potter smiles a very satisfied smile, gesturing for Ron and Hermione to follow him inside. He leaves his other hand on Draco\u2019s shoulder the entire time. He shivers a little under Potter\u2019s touch, and a quiet warming charm lays over him. He doesn\u2019t see Potter\u2019s wand, but he knows the touch of his magic \u2013 warm, instead of biting.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says under his breath. Potter doesn\u2019t even listen, just leads Draco over to the empty table with four chairs, the perfect space for their little group.\nPotter doesn\u2019t sit next to him \u2013 once he\u2019s ensured that Draco is safely seated, he sits across from him. His expression is nearly impossible to read, but Draco doesn\u2019t try no matter how much he\u2019s dying to know what the man is thinking.\nAfter that day, Potter shows up for lunch regularly, and he doesn\u2019t get handsy with Draco again, necessarily, but he\u2019s also no longer afraid to steady Draco when he stumbles or nudge him awake when he nods off at lunch.\nHe also \u2013 and Draco has no clue how to explain this away \u2013 has begun to regularly cast Draco\u2019s warming charms instead of Hermione. Draco isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s realized that his magic doesn\u2019t hurt Draco, or if it\u2019s just easy for him to do quickly since he can perform wandless magic\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have an excuse for it. He\u2019s scared to get an answer about what they have or haven\u2019t noticed, and so he doesn\u2019t ask.\nLunch becomes Draco\u2019s favorite time of the day.\n***\nThey\u2019ve finally settled into a routine \u2013 with only a month left on the mental countdown until he\u2019s inevitably house-bound \u2013 when the day comes that both Ron and Hermione are too busy for lunch.\nHe has no expectations. He stays in his cubicle, trying to sort the Stalker 7 letters out of Potter\u2019s mail (Stalker 7 being the most presumptuous as well as the most persistent. Draco hates their letters with a passion). He\u2019s got a blinding headache, and he can no longer take pain potions to ease them. The magic in potions makes his stomach cramp so badly he cries, and he\u2019s too proud \u2013 or too scared \u2013 to ask for help.\nHe\u2019s afraid that if he takes his problems back to Healer Clearwater, she will tell him it\u2019s time to quit working, and the thought of being isolated in his huge, empty home (of being away from Potter, when he finally gets to be around him) terrifies him.\nHe has his head down, trying to block out the light and muffle the sound of his harsh breathing from anyone else in the office, when he hears a gentle knock behind him.\nHe looks up, hoping to Circe his whirlwind of emotions doesn\u2019t show on his face, to find Potter standing in the entrance to his cubicle with a conflicted expression. His posture, however, is non-threatening, asking for welcome rather than expecting it the way Ron\u2019s had been in the early days of their acquaintance.\n\u201cLunch?\u201d\nDraco looks up at him, eyes watering from the pain. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stand,\u201d he murmurs without consciously deciding to be honest, and Potter\u2019s expression goes from unsure to concerned in a heartbeat. He kneels in front of Draco, peering into his eyes. \u201cSorry, Potter. I\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re never feeling well,\u201d Potter says archly, still examining him. Draco wonders what he intends to find.\n\u201cNot when you\u2019re around,\u201d he grouses, the pain in his chest easing ever so slightly. It never goes away, but Potter\u2019s presence is like a balm. \u201cYou make my condition worse by proxy.\u201d He lets his mouth get away from him, too eager to push Potter away.\nTo his surprise, Potter just chuckles a little. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go get lunch. I\u2019ll carry you if I need to.\u201d\nDraco surprises himself by agreeing. His headache throbs when he nods his head. \u201cWhile I would love for the Ministry to see me being carried around like a prince by their savior, I\u2019d rather walk.\u201d\n\u201cBest let them think you\u2019re a strong and independent prince instead,\u201d Potter agrees affably. Draco tries to smile, but doesn\u2019t think that it comes out quite right. He opens his mouth to argue but thinks better of it. Potter seems to sense his agreement and stands, holding out a hand for Draco to take. With the other, he grabs Draco\u2019s cane and hands it to him.\nDraco takes his hand, and tries not to think about the string connecting them, even though he can see it shorten when they touch. For a moment, he thinks it glows red, but when he gives it a closer look, it\u2019s rusty-grey as usual.\nPotter takes him to a new place, a small diner that\u2019s out of the way and surprisingly pleasant. Draco\u2019s found that he likes places like this, little bustling cafes and restaurants that are so common in muggle London. When he steps in, the staff don\u2019t even seem to start at his presence, the way the staff at The Camellia have only recently stopped doing.\nPotter sits him down and orders for him, saying only trust me when Draco gives him a look. \u201cThanks for coming out with me,\u201d he says, as if he didn\u2019t come to fetch Draco himself. \u201cI was starving and Ron refused to look away from the case he\u2019s working on.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten all day,\u201d he answers with a shrug, trying to seem nonchalant. \u201cI figured that I might as well.\u201d\nPotter gives him a glance out of the corner of his eye, but doesn\u2019t argue, even though he\u2019s long since figured out how rarely Draco eats anyway. \u201cEven so. It\u2019s routine, coming to get you.\u201d He pauses, looking down at his menu and trying very hard not to stare Draco down. It\u2019s kind of endearing, but Draco would rather know what Potter has to say.\nHe raises an eyebrow. Potter makes a face. He waits, very patiently. Potter\u2019s not good at holding things in.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever come up to us?\u201d he asks finally, proving Draco right. \u201cDo you not want to have lunch with us? Are you just putting up with us because we ask?\u201d\nDraco wants to smile at how easily Potter slots himself into the we. We, this group that asks him to join and wants him around.\nHe doesn\u2019t smile. Instead, he\u2019s brutally honest. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just never sure of my welcome. Even now, months later\u2026 you told me you didn\u2019t want me around you. I wasn\u2019t going to impose on you when you\u2019re only putting up with me because your friends like me.\u201d Circe knows why they do, anyway.\nPotter turns red, and Draco isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s anger, shame\u2026 embarrassment? Luckily, Potter clears it up for him when he mutters, \u201cI was wrong.\u201d\nFor all that Draco started this conversation himself, he can\u2019t stop the way his chest clenches. He was wrong? The moment when Potter had severed their bond is the most poignant of his life \u2013 and now he\u2019s taking it back? Draco glances down toward his string, but it hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s still faded. The sight of it makes him take a deep breath before he can even look at Potter again.\nJudging by the expression on Potter\u2019s face, he\u2019s picked up on the gravity of the conversation \u2013 at least the gravity for Draco, who\u2019s sitting still except for the trembling of his hands (which never stop).\n\u201cYou were wrong,\u201d he says flatly. He doesn\u2019t know what else to say or how to respond.\nPotter looks vaguely ashamed of himself. \u201cI was. You tried to create a truce between us, and I was still angry enough about the war and our past that I blew you off. I didn\u2019t realize until you and Ron became closer that you were being genuine. I thought\u2026\u201d\nDraco finishes for him. \u201cYou thought I was trying to make nice in order to look good around others. To bolster my own reputation.\u201d\nPotter nods. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and I should have handled it better. I\u2019m sorry, Malfoy.\u201d Draco glances down at his string again. Yes, he probably should have. Things would be very different if he had. For a moment, Draco debates telling him \u2013 he can, can\u2019t he? Now that Potter has almost admitted to wanting him around, to liking him.\nHe doesn\u2019t. Instead, he gives Potter his best smile \u2013 a friendly one that hopefully doesn\u2019t look like a grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says gently. He wonders if it\u2019s his growth as a person or the bond that allows him to be so gentle. He\u2019d never been gentle before. \u201cWe\u2019ve all changed. You had every right to be angry, to never want to see me again. I\u2019m just glad we managed to reconcile after all.\u201d\nPotter looks up from his food, surprised, but he breaks out a relieved grin of his own. \u201cWe\u2019re okay, then?\u201d\nDraco thinks of his broken bond, of the way he\u2019s missed Potter and wanted him for over a year. Then, he meets Potter\u2019s gaze and nods. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHarry.\u201d\nPotter looks almost startled, but then his grin widens. \u201cDraco.\u201d\nReally, very little has changed, but Draco feels like his world has brightened ever so slightly.\nIf he must go out, at least he\u2019s managed to make his peace.\n***\nThings change after that.\nHarry greets him with a smile now and tends to walk next to him when they go from his cubicle to the floo. He likes to keep a hand on Draco\u2019s elbow to keep him steady, though Draco doesn\u2019t quite need that much support. He doesn\u2019t call him on it; the touch is reassuring.\nIt\u2019s clear that both Ron and Hermione are aware of the change \u2013 they sit together so that Harry can sit next to Draco. Draco asks about it at the end of one of their check-in meetings, and Ron only says \u201cHe always was obsessed with you,\u201d with an eye roll before giving him a lazy salute and leaving the room. Draco doesn\u2019t know what that means, but he just sighs. Apparently he\u2019d just have to put up with his could-be soulmate being his best friend.\nAnother new development is that, like Ron, Harry begins to come down and check in on him. He uses the stalker letters as an excuse \u2013 I was just wondering if so-and-so is still writing, but while I\u2019m here, you should tell me about your time abroad in France \u2013 but mostly he seems concerned about Draco\u2019s ever-ailing health.\nIt\u2019s strange. Before Ron, there had been no one to tell if he was having a bad day and no one to care about his death. Now, there are three people who are around to ask how he\u2019s doing. Harry Potter himself comes down and check\u2019s Draco\u2019s temperature. It\u2019s kind of flattering, but the rest of him hates how easily he\u2019s come to rely on Harry\u2019s presence just to feel like a person instead of a walking sore. It\u2019s unhealthy \u2013 he knows it is \u2013 but he can\u2019t quite stop. Loving Harry Potter is in his soul, and Harry is making it too easy.\nDraco remembers disliking him \u2013 at the very least, being green with envy at the sight of him. Even now, he doesn\u2019t know what for. The fame? The talent? His kindness? His ability to be whoever he wants to be and damn the consequences? But he doesn\u2019t feel envious of him any longer. He doesn\u2019t dislike him or think he\u2019s annoying. The bond didn\u2019t make him like Harry, but it allowed him to see all the ways they fit together. It made him aware of the yearning he felt just to be around him, a yearning that\u2019s haunted him since he was young.\nHe finds himself reaching out for Harry\u2019s arm, and leaning into his hand when he puts it on Draco\u2019s shoulder. He finds himself falling in love with his soulmate, and he can\u2019t make it stop.\nHis string of fate goes from a rust brown to a faded almost-grey.\nRon calls him out on the way he\u2019ll twirl it around his fingers sometimes. Draco\u2019s barely paying attention to the conversation; he has a fever again and he\u2019s half-convinced it\u2019ll kill him this time. Ron asks him at lunch one night what it\u2019s like to be able to see it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be red,\u201d he mutters, and the words come out half-choked. His looks up blearily. Hermione looks stricken, and next to him Harry has covered his hand to stop its fidgeting.\n\u201cIs it not?\u201d Ron asks, and Harry hisses, \u201cHe\u2019s told us before, Ron, it\u2019s grey!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Draco says slowly. He must be, if he can\u2019t pin down why he\u2019d said what he did in the first place. Normally, he tries to avoid telling them about the bond (about how much he aches, or how he\u2019s falling in love with a soulmate that doesn\u2019t want him, about how Harry\u2019s touch soothes the pain only for it to come back worse when he\u2019s gone like it\u2019s punishing him - )\n\u201cDraco?\u201d Hermione\u2019s gentle voice sounds like it\u2019s coming through a thick fog. \u201cHarry asked you a question.\u201d\nAll three of them are staring at him. At her prompting, Harry leans in to murmur, \u201cI said, do you want to go back to the office? Or go home? You don\u2019t look well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s becoming your catch phrase,\u201d he mutters, but he leans against Harry\u2019s side when his shake of the head makes him dizzy.\n\u201cWhat, that you don\u2019t look well?\u201d Ron snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s because you never do. Forgive us for worrying about you, your majesty.\u201d He looks over to Harry. \u201cMaybe you should take him home, though. I don\u2019t like the idea of taking him back to the office and leaving him there.\u201d\n\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d Draco says, going for exasperated and ending up at tired. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but\u2026 you don\u2019t need to take care of me.\u201d\nHermione shrugs, smiling wryly. \u201cThe way you can barely sit upright indicates otherwise.\u201d The smile slips off. \u201c\u2026 it\u2019s getting worse, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDraco shrugged. His shoulder rubbed up and down against Harry\u2019s. \u201cWe knew it would.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it easier,\u201d she says. She\u2019s wringing her hands in her lap, he can tell, though she\u2019s trying to hide it under the tabletop. Hermione\u2019s kind of fidgety, he\u2019s noticed, but so is Harry. It makes it easier to tell when something\u2019s bothering them. When Draco doesn\u2019t have any rebuttal for her, she sighs. \u201cYou really should go home, Draco. I\u2019m sure your supervisor will let you.\u201d\nDraco snorts. \u201cI bet you he won\u2019t.\u201d It comes out more bitter than he would have liked. When Hermione makes a face at him, he rolls his eyes. \u201cQuinley hates me. Rightly so \u2013 I think he\u2019s a prick and have no respect for his authority.\u201d He makes it as haughty as he can, and Hermione graciously doesn\u2019t mention Quinley\u2019s real motivation, nor does she mention that Draco hasn\u2019t talked back to Quinley once to justify his hatred. It\u2019s not worth it, and would likely leave him in auror custody again if Quinley reported his defiance.\nThey do a marvelous job of ignoring the dark-mark shaped elephant in the room, the four of them.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Harry volunteers, and then without waiting for a response he nudges Draco out of the booth. By \u2018nudges,\u2019 Draco of course means that he practically lifts him out, as a strong breeze could knock Draco over. He opens his mouth to argue, but Harry just raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cDo you really want to go back to sorting my mail?\u201d\n\u201cI was rather looking forward to what secret admirer 12 had to say this time,\u201d Draco mutters, but now that he\u2019s on his feet again he can admit he\u2019s feeling rather faint. Harry\u2019s presence makes the effects of the bond better, but he by no means cures them.\n(He could. Draco won\u2019t ever ask him to.)\n\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever she has to say is riveting,\u201d Harry snorts while he grabs the papers he\u2019d brought with him to lunch. He\u2019d never actually ended up reviewing them like he\u2019d meant to.\n\u201cLast time they begged for a couple strands of your hair so they could polyjuice into you and molest your gorgeous auror body.\u201d He makes air quotations with the hand not keeping him upright on his cane. Ron is startled into a laugh.\nThey say their goodbyes, and Harry leads him away with that fucking hand on his elbow, leading him to the nearest floo. Apparition has been too hard on him lately.\nIt\u2019s Harry\u2019s hand on his elbow that makes him privy to the way Draco\u2019s entire body shudders with pain when they break through the Ministry\u2019s wards. \u201cThat looked like it hurt,\u201d he says cautiously, pulling Draco to the side so he could check on him without blocking the floo. \u201cThe wards\u2026?\u201d\nDraco nods, even though it makes his head ache. \u201cIt only hurts when I pass through them. I\u2019m not the one that monitors them, so they don\u2019t bother me whenever I\u2019m in the building.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t affected my work thus far, anyway.\u201d\nSomething about what he says makes Harry narrow his eyes a little, but Harry doesn\u2019t ask; he just gestures for them to move forward toward the mail room. They walk down at Draco\u2019s pace, Harry patiently walking with him even though Draco is slow and somewhat shaky on his feet.\nAs it turned out, Quinley really doesn\u2019t argue when it\u2019s the savior himself asking for a half day off, and Harry gives him a very fake smile before shoving Draco out the door and back toward the floo.\n\u201cI hate the way he looks at you,\u201d Harry mutters. \u201cLike you\u2019re dirt beneath his shoe. Elitist prick.\u201d\nDraco glances over at him. There\u2019s a small voice in his head that wants to say that he is the dirt beneath Quinley\u2019s shoe, and he can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s the depression or his own belief. \u201cYou used to look at me that way,\u201d he says, going for conversational but falling flat.\nHarry doesn\u2019t even react. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve told you I was wrong for it.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco says agreeably. \u201cBut you also can\u2019t deny that I have brought that treatment upon myself.\u201d\nHarry pauses in the middle of the hall, face blank. \u201cYou\u2026 are you trying to convince me you deserve to be treated like hippogriff shit?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not entirely uncalled for,\u201d he clarifies slowly. \u201cPerhaps people deserve to be forgiven, but human behavior does not always align with ideal morality, and I have made a great many bad decisions.\u201d He looks down at his greying string, flexing his finger around his cane handle. \u201cI can\u2019t fault any of them \u2013 my coworkers, my soulmate. Their rejections make sense.\u201d\nDraco is growing sick of seeing the dark clouds that cross Harry\u2019s face without any idea of what thought prompts them. Agreement? Disagreement? He is normally good at reading people, but he realized very quickly that he can\u2019t read Harry Potter at all.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have this conversation here,\u201d Harry says, abrupt, and he leads Draco back toward the floos at a quicker pace. He half-struggles to keep up, but Harry doesn\u2019t stop this time, and Draco doesn\u2019t complain.\nHe doesn\u2019t expect Harry to go with him, but when Draco asks in confusion, Harry tells him curtly that it wouldn\u2019t do for Draco to collapse in his entryway and brain himself on the floor. He hasn\u2019t collapsed yet, but he also knows that Harry\u2019s concern isn\u2019t unwarranted, and so he sighs and lets Harry follow him into the floo.\n\u201cMalfoy Manor!\u201d Harry says, and they are swept away.\nThey emerge in the Manor, and though Draco tries to hide it, the wards immediately dig into his skin. He grits his teeth and forces a smile when Harry glances over at him. \u201cAre you going to help me upstairs, too?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you to bed, yeah,\u201d he answers, raising an eyebrow like he expects Draco to say I\u2019m actually going to do some work\u2026\nInstead, he just sighs. \u201cI sleep in the study.\u201d At the raised eyebrow he gets, Draco adds, \u201cIt\u2019s easier than keeping multiple fires lit over the course of the day.\u201d He doesn\u2019t question that (probably knowing exactly where the Malfoy house elves went), and just nods, letting Draco guide them toward the study.\nOnce he gets seated on the couch, Harry lights a fire, and the wards flicker with the foreign magic happening within its walls. His face screws up when the pain goes from a constant low-level prickling to a stab. It\u2019s not until he schools his face back to a neutral expression that Harry says, \u201cI knew it.\u201d\nDraco blinks over at him and thinks to himself that he\u2019s getting sick of Harry taking him by surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still tense, and the wards alerted you when I cast the incendio just now,\u201d he snaps, and Draco has to physically restrain the flinch. He knows that Harry isn\u2019t upset with him. \u201cYou said earlier that the wards at the Ministry don\u2019t bother you because you\u2019re not their keeper \u2013 that means that the Manor\u2019s wards are hurting you, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nThere are mice in the cellar. If his sensitivity to magic wasn\u2019t ramped up to eleven, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to feel that twitch in the wards, but every movement they make feels like a needle under his skin. The constant pressure of the wards makes a headache pound behind his temples. He can feel it growing now as they speak, and he grits his teeth at his own weakness.\nHarry\u2019s brow furrows when he doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cDraco. You don\u2019t need to lie to us about you being in pain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always in pain,\u201d he bites out, hating the way his voice comes out acidic like he\u2019s 16 again and Harry\u2019s getting to close to his secrets. In a way, he feels like a 16 year old, and he hates it; at 23, he shouldn\u2019t still be feeling like an overwhelmed child, should he? \u201cEverything hurts, Potter \u2013\u201c and he\u2019s on a roll, now, spitting out Harry\u2019s name like a curse and pitying himself even though he\u2019s tried so hard to be reasonable about everything \u2013 \u201cand I can\u2019t do anything to stop it. I\u2019m in pain so often now that I\u2019d rather be dead than remember that I\u2019m dying because my soulmate doesn\u2019t want me! I can\u2019t do magic! I can\u2019t move faster than a bloody turtle\u2019s pace and I feel so empty \u2013\u201c\nHarry tugs him close, tucking Draco\u2019s head into the crook of his neck without his permission, and Draco feels his mouth twist into a sob before he can control it.\nHe won\u2019t let himself cry, but he does let himself rest his head on his soulmate\u2019s shoulder and breathe for a long moment.\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d he mutters against Harry\u2019s robes.\nHarry surprises him by rubbing a hand up his back. The other is dangerously close to cupping the back of his neck. Draco tries very hard not to sink into his warmth, into the expectation that Harry is going to be here for him. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t need to apologize for being upset about this, right? Do you know how often I lashed out during the war, when it seemed like everything bad that could possibly happen to me did?\u201d He pulled away and grinned a little sheepishly. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a situation where we have to learn to control our tempers, but\u2026 it\u2019s okay to be upset. It\u2019s okay to need to rant about it sometimes.\u201d\nHis hands are still gentle on Draco\u2019s shoulders. Harry really is so touchy with Draco - he\u2019s tried to find some logical reason to explain it, but everything he\u2019s considered seems like him getting his hopes up and he refuses to fall into that trap.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re like this,\u201d Draco tells him lowly. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re nothing like I used to think you were.\u201d\nHarry gave him a crooked grin. \u201cPeople are like that. You\u2019re different than I thought, too.\u201d\n\u201cNot too different, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cSnarky, yes, and proud. But\u2026 in a lot of ways you\u2019re nothing like I thought. You don\u2019t give yourself enough credit for how much you\u2019ve changed since Hogwarts.\u201d He stood and cracked his neck. \u201cC\u2019mon. Why don\u2019t you stay at my place? The wards at Grimmauld shouldn\u2019t bother you once you\u2019re inside, right? It\u2019s too big for just me, anyway.\u201d Draco wants to snort. Imagine how I feel in the Manor, he wants to say.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Impose. Be so close to the one person he wants to be close to. He doesn\u2019t know how to finish the sentence, but Harry stops him before he can figure it out.\n\u201cYou can, and will,\u201d he says with a raised eyebrow. He gives Draco The Look until he sighs and nods in defeat. He wonders if Potter thinks him too easy. It doesn\u2019t matter; Draco is, for him.\n\u201cLet it be noted I\u2019m agreeing under duress.\u201d He gives Harry a pointed look.\n\u201cNoted. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n***\nHe all but moves into no.12 Grimmauld Place, and while on the surface he\u2019s incredibly unhappy about it, something within him settles a little bit at the proximity, like the dying is a little easier to bear.\nHarry\u2019s easy to live with. He\u2019s good at the chores that Draco is now too weak to do, and has so much magical energy that he can cover both his own and Draco\u2019s magical needs. The fires are always kept, their clothes cleaned, and Kreacher is there to feed him when he can\u2019t get out of bed after a long day at work.\nThey eat dinner together. Draco hates how domestic and cozy it makes him feel, like he\u2019s safe.\nDraco finds out that Harry is pretty good at wizarding chess, which they play often on their days off, when Draco is awake and needs something to do. Ron, apparently, is better, and sometimes he comes over to play as well.\nDraco works late one day early into their new arrangement, and when he gets home Harry is waiting in the living room for him with a book in hand.\n\u201cYou read?\u201d Draco asks, as teasing as he can be when his back hurts and his head is pounding and even the split-second of pain when he goes through the Grimmauld Place wards makes him want to vomit.\n\u201cCome here, you berk,\u201d Harry says, rolling his eyes, and Draco settles on the other end of the couch, folds his legs underneath his body \u2013 trying to ignore how frail he feels, how thin he is even compared to his naturally slender frame. Harry stretches out, stuffs his feet under Draco\u2019s shin, though he can\u2019t imagine that he gives off any warmth. Then, Harry summons a blanket for them both and begins to read.\nIt\u2019s a muggle novel about some shithead detective and his level-headed companion, and Draco enjoys being read to, though he often falls asleep (only to wake in his own bed the next morning).\nThey settle into a comfortable duo, going from a pretense of I\u2019m doing you a favor, I just want to help to I want you around. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here.\nDraco has missed living with another person. Living with Harry makes him remember why going home after work is a good thing and what it\u2019s like to have something to look forward to.\nOf course, it\u2019s once he settles into this pattern \u2013 once he starts to feel okay in spite of the cold, of the magic loss, the magic sensitivity, the exhaustion, the pain \u2013 that he collapses one day at work.\nThe woman who\u2019d tried to kick him out of the lounge \u2013 the woman who\u2019d once said that she wished he would kill himself \u2013 finds him in the hall, eyes closed, bleeding from where he\u2019d hit his head on the corner of a desk.\nHe has no idea what happens after that, but finds out later that it had taken half an hour for them to finally call a Healer and get him taken to St. Mungo\u2019s.\nWhen he wakes up, Healer Clearwater is standing over his bed. Hermione and Harry are sitting in visitor chairs off to the side. Hermione\u2019s eyes are red. Harry\u2019s are very green, and he looks like he\u2019s swinging back and forth between anger and sadness. Ron, he remembers, had an important meeting that afternoon, and hadn\u2019t even been planning to join them for lunch. That exhausts the list of people who would care about him being in the hospital.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Healer Clearwater tells him once she\u2019s sure he\u2019s lucid. He struggles through a heavy sigh and nods.\nHe leaves with a healer\u2019s note for permanent leave. Harry frog marches him to his bedroom at Grimmauld Place and snatches his leave note. He\u2019s the one who turns it into Quinley, and later recounts to him Quinley\u2019s very pained looking well wishes.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss that smarmy bastard,\u201d Draco sighs. Harry, who\u2019s lounging on the other side of the bed with the book he\u2019s been reading, snickers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a smarmy bastard.\u201d\n\u201cLike calls to like.\u201d\n\u201cStrange, because I hate him even though I\u2019m pretty fond of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be biased.\u201d\nThere is a moment where Harry just snickers at him. He smiles sleepily and hopes his expression isn\u2019t overly soft.\n***\nHe makes Harry go with him to the muggle caf\u00e9 he still visits, albeit less frequently than he had a year ago. It\u2019s only been a week since he was put on proverbial house arrest, and Draco is sick of his bedroom walls, lovely as they are. Harry had provided him with the old master bedroom, and the opulence reminded Draco of better days at the Manor. He refused to thank Harry for it, but he had said very quietly that he loved it, and Harry had squeezed his shoulder to show he\u2019d gotten the message.\nMimi is glad to see him. He\u2019s honestly wondered if she would still be working here, but he comes in during her usual hours anyway and is rewarded with her huge smile.\n\u201cYou brought another friend,\u201d she says once they\u2019ve exchanged greetings. There\u2019s no one else in the shop \u2013 it\u2019s late afternoon, between lunch and dinner rushes, and she chats with them while she makes their drinks. \u201cI thought the ginger one was the only one you had.\u201d\nDraco smiles dryly. He watches her try to avoid looking at the cane and back up at his face in worry, and it\u2019s almost amusing. \u201cSlander,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this is your idea of customer service, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nShe wrinkles her nose, making Harry laugh. \u201cThe ginger one? You\u2019ve brought Ron?\u201d\n\u201cThis is my favorite caf\u00e9! I\u2019m allowed to bring whoever I want.\u201d\nThey bicker as they wait, and by the time Mimi slides their drinks out with a charming grin, he\u2019s half-leaning against Harry to remain upright, but he\u2019s smiling.\nThey finish their coffee in the caf\u00e9, because Draco\u2019s hands shake too bad for him to carry his drink back to Grimmauld and Harry can\u2019t carry drinks and catch him if falls. He\u2019s not mad about it \u2013 he loves the warm colors and the way Mimi will stop to check on him every couple minutes to catch up. She rags on him about his absence lately, and he explains to her that he\u2019s been busy. He has, after all \u2013 he spends all of his time with the Golden Trio (as he can\u2019t stop calling them in his head) or at work.\n\u201cWho\u2019s the boy?\u201d she asks with arched eyebrows when Harry uses the restroom. \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\nDraco shrugs. His cheeks might have turned pink a year and a half ago, but now he stays as pale as ever. \u201cOld flame of a sort. He doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d\nMimi pouts, but her eyes are sad for him. \u201cHe should. You deserve good things,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Draco can\u2019t help but smile a little. His lips feel chapped, and he wonders how bad he looks, whether or not he\u2019s even presentable. He hasn\u2019t had the energy (or reason) to worry about his appearance in a long time. \u201cI could be a terrible person. You only see me for five minutes a week.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got an alright energy, Draco,\u201d she tells him knowingly. \u201cSometimes, you\u2019ve got to trust the energy.\u201d\nSomething about her surety makes him sad. \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d he says, and Harry comes up over her shoulder with a quick glance between them. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\nShe backs up a little to let Harry pass. \u201cYeah, ready,\u201d Harry agrees, and then he turns a smile on Mimi. \u201cThanks for the coffee. Have a good day.\u201d\n\u201cHave a good day, Mimi,\u201d Draco agrees gently, and she smiles warmly at them both, watching Harry help Draco stand. He hands Draco his walking stick and then carefully cups his elbow to help him get steady on his feet.\n\u201cFeel better!\u201d Mimi says as they leave, like she always does. He doesn\u2019t know how to tell her he\u2019s not going to get better. He wonders if she\u2019ll even realize he\u2019s stopped coming after he dies.\nHarry seems to pick up on his odd mood, but he chatters quietly as they make their way to a quiet space to apparates home anyway.\n***\nDraco tries not to become bitter the longer he\u2019s kept inside Grimmauld Place, but even his four-poster bed with its gauzy curtains and the open window into the back garden can\u2019t stop him from feeling sequestered away like a maiden with consumption from the eighteen hundreds.\nHe\u2019s good at not being bitter now \u2013 much better at it than he was in his teens, anyway - but it\u2019s not always easy. He\u2019s got plenty to feel sorry for himself about, and very little to look forward to.\nThe list is small. One is that Harry still reads to him and engages him in discussion about the book. Draco is the intellectual between them, but Harry\u2019s better at people, and always has interesting insights about the characters. He also likes it when Hermione and Ron come over for dinner, and when Blaise makes the time to floo-call him.\n(Blaise doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s sick. Harry thinks it\u2019s cruel not to tell him, but Draco doesn\u2019t care about Harry\u2019s opinion \u2013 not in this.)\nThere are other things, too \u2013 Harry can cook, and makes him dinner. He often visits on his lunch break, breaking up the monotony of Draco\u2019s day. He has a large bathtub to soak in, and Harry buys him fancy bath salts because Draco \u201clooks like the type\u201d (he is). Draco sometimes goes into the study and examines the Black family tree, looking at his parents\u2019 names. It\u2019s a place of solitude and calm for him that he hasn\u2019t had in a while.\nAt the end of the day, though, most of his happiness comes down to Harry. He gets used to living at Grimmauld Place, and prays he gets to stay here until the end. Harry would be well within his rights to hospitalize Draco if it came down to it, to not want a dying man living in his home, but he\u2019d rather die in bed.\nHe gets sick again, and wonders to himself \u2013 burning with fever and half-delirious \u2013 if the end is coming.\n***\nHarry calls Healer Clearwater to the house when, a week and a half after he gets sick again, Draco still finds himself spending most of his time dizzy and cold, a perpetual layer of sweat slicking his body.\nAfter her examination, Harry pulls her out of the room for her opinion, but Draco can still hear her tell him in a gentle voice that he\u2019s got a couple of weeks. If he\u2019s lucky. His immune system is weak, and his overall health is fading regardless. He has a hard time eating, his sleep patterns are unhealthy\u2026 his body is shutting down. Draco ponders that, calmer than he thought possible, and surprises himself by feeling relief. The guessing game is over \u2013 He can breathe at last.\nWhen Healer Clearwater comes in to break the news, she also tells him very quietly that Harry\u2019s not handling it well. Draco could have told her as much.\n\u201cHe really cares about you,\u201d she muses. \u201cYou had strong feelings about each other at Hogwarts, but I never imagined you\u2019d be so close one day. I probably shouldn\u2019t be surprised; your rivalry was legendary. Of course there\u2019s a lot of pent up emotion there.\u201d\nDraco huffs a weak laugh. It\u2019s really not funny. \u201cRon said the same thing. A pretty pair we make \u2013 the savior who wants to fix everyone, and the dying death eater who can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d\nPenelope reaches out to pat his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t need fixing anymore, Draco, but\u2026 let Harry take care of you while he can. I think he\u2019s going to take this pretty personally, like he failed you somehow.\u201d\nDraco sighs. His eyes kept fluttering shut, the exhaustion trying to drag him back into sleep. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the half of it, but he shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want him to blame himself.\u201d After a long beat, he opens his eyes again to see Penelope looking down at him with huge eyes, putting the clues together. Before she can say anything, he manages a small, knowing smile. \u201cHealer-patient confidentiality,\u201d he reminds her, and watches as her jaw tightens.\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t signed the paperwork forbidding me from sharing information that could save your life, I would walk right out there and tell him what you just said to me,\u201d she hisses, standing and crossing her arms. \u201cTotal privacy clause \u2013 what hippogriff shit.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t be angry,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI made a choice based on circumstances, and I intend to follow it through. I\u2019m okay, really, and he\u2019s better off.\u201d\n\u201cI disagree,\u201d she snaps, but after a moment she just takes a deep breath. \u201cIf I can\u2019t convince you out if it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 at least tell Weasley or Granger,\u201d she finishes. \u201cLet them help you. You\u2019re underestimating how much that man cares about you, and it\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Draco says dryly. \u201cHe rejected me.\u201d He yawns. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re okay now, and I\u2019m not going to make him feel like he has to choose between me and his future. I\u2019m at peace with it.\u201d\nHe can hear her foot tapping. \u201cAs your healer, I strongly advise against it.\u201d\n\u201cNoted. Thank you, Healer Clearwater.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re welcome, Draco.\u201d\nShe leaves again, and Draco lays alone in bed for several long minutes. He assumes that Harry is seeing Healer Clearwater out, but then several minutes turns into half an hour, and Draco finds himself drifting off, wondering distantly what Harry and his healer are talking about. He\u2019s not worried she\u2019ll spill his secrets, but he wouldn\u2019t put it past her to give him a hint, or recommend him to talk to someone that would steer him in the right direction.\nHe needn\u2019t worry. Harry wakes him he doesn\u2019t know how long after, his green eyes rubbed red and puffy.\n\u201cHave you been crying?\u201d he asks, voice a soft rasp with sleep and sickness. \u201cGryffindor.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re so calm about this,\u201d Harry manages to say thickly. \u201cSlytherin.\u201d\nHe sits on the edge of Draco\u2019s bed, and with a sigh Draco scoots back so Harry can lay down comfortably. Harry does, staying to his own side, but he does let a tear slip from his eye and down his nose. Draco watches him cry quietly. \u201cAre you really going to miss me that much?\u201d he asks after several minutes have passed.\n\u201cYou have such a hard time acknowledging that people care about you,\u201d Harry says, and his voice is thick with his tears. He hadn\u2019t been crying that hard, but Draco suddenly has a pit in his stomach telling him that Harry is trying to hide how upset he is. There is a suspicious wobbling to Harry\u2019s lower lip. His tears make his eyes so much greener.\n\u201cHistorically, very few people have,\u201d he shrugs as much as he can laying down. \u201cBut\u2026 oh, Harry. Stop crying.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so heartless,\u201d Harry laughs wetly. \u201cStop crying. I can\u2019t stop, you git. Look at you. We\u2019ve only just gotten to be friends.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not heartless; I\u2019m pragmatic. There\u2019s no point in crying over me.\u201d\n\u201cYou may be okay with this,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cBut Merlin, Draco, I\u2019ll miss you. I\u2019m sick of losing friends, and I hate seeing you suffer like this. I want to go flying with you and go out with our friends and be people, and I hate thinking that we\u2019ll never be able to do those things.\u201d\nHarry shifts a little closer, and Draco sighs before shifting onto his back and reaching over his own body to pull Harry into his side. Harry goes willingly, pressing his nose into Draco\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d Draco tells him, hesitantly \u2013 still debating whether or not to even say it. \u201c\u2026 all I wanted was to be your friend. From the time I was very young to about when I turned twelve, I had this stupid daydream that we would be best mates and save the world. I don\u2019t know. I wanted to be a hero and go on adventures and\u2026\u201d He shrugs, shifting Harry\u2019s head against his shoulder.\n\u201cYou were a prick and I\u2019m not going to apologize for turning down your shitty friendship in first year,\u201d Harry mumbles, and Draco snorts.\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d he continues pointedly. \u201cI always wanted to be your friend, and I wanted to be glamourous and have everyone love me\u2026 but it\u2019s better now. Just you and me. No adventures, just being people. I\u2019m\u2026 happy with this. I\u2019m glad we got our time.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a very long moment in which Harry stiffens against him, and Draco thinks that perhaps he\u2019s somehow angered him \u2013 maybe Draco\u2019s self-absorbed childish fantasies have pissed him off.\n\u201cI want more,\u201d Harry chokes instead, and Draco realizes he\u2019s not angry. Harry\u2019s still body begins shaking with sobs, and Draco is stunned into stillness of his own when Harry cups his hand around his neck and pulls him in so that they\u2019re wrapped around each other even tighter. Draco brings up a shaky hand to pet at his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to die \u2013 I want to do those things I said, and maybe even go on adventures like you wanted, but the good kind, where I take pictures of everything and you try to pretend you\u2019re not impressed by any of it even though you are. I want to\u2026 I want to see what you\u2019ll be like in a decade, and I want you to be healthy and happy like I haven\u2019t seen before Voldemort came back. I want all those things, and it\u2019s fucking shit because you\u2019re dying and none of it will ever happen!\u201d\n\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d\nBut at the sound of his name, Harry cries harder. He\u2019s an ugly crier, Draco thinks, but somehow the sound makes his own lower lip wobble with the effort it takes to keep himself from crying.\n\u201cStop,\u201d Draco sighs again, and he lets his hand card through Harry\u2019s hair gently, scratching at his scalp. \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t want you to cry.\u201d\n\u201cThen stop bloody dying,\u201d he snaps, but his voice cracks, and Draco closes his eyes to try and stop his own tears. He fails, and one slips down his cheek to land on Harry\u2019s hair.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die either,\u201d he whispers, and Harry\u2019s shoulders shake. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t want to give this up.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Harry says, and he sits up abruptly to look Draco in the face. \u201cDraco, your soulmate. So they were a fucking prick, so what? You don\u2019t have to be with them, right? Tell them, make them take it back, and then you can stay here with me \u2013 and Ron and Hermione, obviously.\u201d His cheeks are pink, but Draco can\u2019t tell it\u2019s because of the slip (can\u2019t even tell if it was really a slip or just thoughtless phrasing) or his tears. \u201cJust\u2026 make them heal your bond, and then don\u2019t die. This is avoidable, isn\u2019t it? If you can convince your soulmate to take back the rejection?\u201d\nWhat really kills him is the fact that he\u2026 can\u2019t think of a reason not to now except that if he tells, Harry will not only get to keep him, but that he\u2019ll also have to live with the fact that Draco lied to him about for almost two years. Draco wonders if he could handle telling Harry and having to live without him if Harry felt betrayed by him, or if Harry didn\u2019t want anything to do with him romantically.\nSome soulmate bonds are platonic. His feelings for Harry are anything but. That one fact shouldn\u2019t scare him so much, but it does. His fear of Harry\u2019s reaction \u2013 of the possibility of Harry abandoning him once he finds out the truth \u2013 keeps his mouth shut.\nWhen he doesn\u2019t respond right away, Harry grabs the hand that had fallen out of his hair. \u201cDraco, please. If you tell me who it is, I can bring them here for you, I could send a message \u2013 I\u2019ll help however I can.\u201d His voice dropped low at the end, gravelly. \u201cJust let me help you. If there\u2019s a way to fix this, let me do it.\u201d\nHarry has never asked him for this before. Ron and Hermione both have \u2013 Healer Clearwater has, too \u2013 but never Harry, not until the truth of Draco\u2019s mortality slapped him in the face.\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he says softly, unable to say no but too afraid to say yes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have long.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know soon,\u201d Draco sighs, and he manages a small, teary-eyed smile when Harry just nods emphatically and hangs his head. \u201cThank you, Harry.\u201d\nHarry huffs a wet laugh. \u201cFor what, caring about you?\u201d\nHe wants to tease, to make it a joke, but it\u2019s too honest when he replies with: \u201c\u2026 yes. For caring about me.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s quiet for a long time, but he doesn\u2019t let go of Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nHarry holds his hand until he falls asleep.\n***\nWhen he wakes up, the muggle clock Harry bought for him lets him know that he\u2019s lost almost a full day, and it\u2019s late afternoon. He hates thinking that he\u2019s losing what little time he has left, but the extra hours leave him feeling a little more awake \u2013 a little less frail \u2013 than usual.\nHe gets out of bed for the first time in days, the wood floor cool against his feet, and he slowly goes downstairs. Kreacher makes him tea, and he sits in Harry\u2019s living room (their living room) with the telly on. He\u2019s not a huge fan of any of the shows Harry\u2019s had him watch, but it\u2019s good background noise, and he curls up on the couch with his tea to relax to the sound of an angry muggle trying to teach other muggles to cook.\nThis is where Ron finds him an hour or so later. He comes through alone, making Draco wonder idly where Harry is if their shifts are over.\n\u201cWhat are you not doing in bed?\u201d Ron asks, eyebrows raised, when Draco startles him with a greeting.\n\u201cI woke up and was sick of laying around,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been in bed for ages and I didn\u2019t feel terrible when I woke up, so I got up.\u201d\nRon nods. \u201cMakes sense; I\u2019d be about ready to punch myself in the face if I was stuck in bed all the time. No fever?\u201d\n\u201cGuess not,\u201d Draco hums. \u201cHealer Clearwater gave me something last night when she stopped by and I feel alright now, so I figure it helped. Some variant on Pepper-Up, I think she said. Anyway, where\u2019s Harry?\u201d\nRon\u2019s face does something interesting when he mentions Healer Clearwater, but he doesn\u2019t comment on it. He figures Harry must have told Ron about the diagnosis. \u201cHe\u2019s working late tonight,\u201d he answers instead, and Draco nods. \u201cWe just got in a case \u2013 it\u2019s not especially bad\u00a0and nobody\u2019s dead, but the paperwork is a nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cPoor savior,\u201d Draco snorts. \u201cTrapped by paperwork.\u201d Ron\u2019s lips twitch upwards, and he comes to sit down on the couch next to Draco. He called for Kreacher to make something for an early dinner, and they eat there together, chatting and quietly watching the telly. Draco\u2019s kept the cooking show on, and while they eat they chat about magical ways to improve the show \u2013 ways magic makes cooking easier, or foods prevalent to the magical community that would make the recipes better.\nRon stays for several hours, and it\u2019s not until they\u2019ve eaten desert and Draco is beginning to nod off where he lays that Ron speaks up.\n\u201cYou know, I think the thing with you and Harry is interesting,\u201d Ron hums.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t ever picture us getting along?\u201d he asks, yawning.\nRon gives him a weird smile. \u201cI could, actually. Funnily enough, I always thought if you could sit down and work through your shit, you\u2019d be mates. I used to think I was the placeholder friend because he always seemed like he\u2019d rather be talking to or about you, even if he hid it with anger. He always was obsessed with you, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou do know that I\u2019m not going to steal your best friend.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know that now. I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d There was a long pause. Ron\u2019s expression was unreadable. \u201cWould it be so bad to tell him?\u201d\nFor a very long moment, Draco doesn\u2019t breathe. The silence in the room deafens him. He looks over to meet Ron\u2019s gaze with what must be fear plain on his face, but Ron doesn\u2019t react to it. He looks like he\u2019d expected it. Draco had been half asleep two minutes ago, but now he\u2019s wide awake.\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t turn you away,\u201d Ron says quietly.\nHe can\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d\n\u201cNot for sure,\u201d Ron shrugs. \u201cNot until just now. But I suspected. It made sense.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell him.\u201d\nThe look Ron gives him is almost pitying. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you that, Draco. Not if it would save your life. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t meddle in my life,\u201d he snaps, and he means to sound angry \u2013 but he\u2019s not angry, he\u2019s desperate, and it shows in his voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this decision for me!\u201d\n\u201cThis is life or death, Draco,\u201d Ron says evenly. \u201cI won\u2019t respect your privacy if it means keeping you alive.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your decision!\u201d\nRon leans forward toward his chair, his hands clasped in front him. He looks painfully earnest. \u201cBut it is his, and you\u2019re taking his ability to decide from him. I know you\u2019re scared, but he deserves to know, Draco, and I think you\u2019d be surprised by how much he\u2019d want to.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s fists are clenched. Why do people keep saying that? \u201cHe rejected me. I was going to die alone so he\u2019d never have to know. He told me he didn\u2019t want me.\u201d\n\u201cHe was angry. He judged you based on your past and he apologized for that. You can\u2019t hold it against him.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not, I just... I don\u2019t know how to tell him,\u201d Draco says, honest even though it kills him, and Ron\u2019s entire expression softens. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t say anything because I didn\u2019t want him to be with me out of obligation\u2026 but how do I explain that now? How do I explain I\u2019ve been his friend for months and haven\u2019t told him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to care more about you living than how long it took you to tell him,\u201d he answers. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it easier, but it\u2019s true. He needs to know.\u201d\nThe thing is, Draco knows he\u2019s right, but he also can\u2019t shake the idea that Harry would agree just to save his life. That had always been his fear, and it hasn\u2019t changed. He had a very clear vision of Harry, willing but more and more resentful every year of the soulmate he\u2019d been shackled to\u2026\nDraco had gotten so used to the idea that he\u2019d die from this that now it\u2019s more frightening to consider that he might have to live with it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to be with me out pity,\u201d Draco says, thinking back to the face Harry made while begging him not to die. Ron sits up straight, recognizing the change in tone. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want him to know.\u201d He looks down at his string, almost entirely grey now. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good thing going,\u201d he adds quietly. \u201cI want to tell him, I swear I do \u2013 I just don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d\nRon nods. \u201cYou don\u2019t have long, mate. If you\u2019re going to tell him \u2013 and I think you should \u2013 you need to do it soon.\u201d He reached over, patting the top of Draco\u2019s foot. \u201cPlease, Draco,\u201d he adds softly. \u201cHarry would be crushed if you died, but it wouldn\u2019t be a walk in the park for me or Herm, either.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a very long silence, and then Draco says, oddly gentle, \u201cYou changed my life, you know.\u201d He laughs like it surprises him. \u201cI hated you in school, you know, you and Hermione and Harry all. I thought you were arrogant and disrespectful and no matter how obsessed Harry and I were with each other, just the sound of your names would make me angry. Harry and I becoming friends I understand \u2013 maybe it was inevitable, with the bond and all \u2013 but you and I\u2026 I never could have predicted our friendship.\u201d\nRon pressed his lips together tightly, but then he snorts. His shoulders relax. \u201cMe fuckin\u2019 either, mate,\u201d he agrees, grinning. \u201cIt was kind of my fault though, wasn\u2019t it? You always looked so miserable and you never left your cubicle\u2026 it depressed me. I played it off like I was being the better person, but to be honest, I just felt bad for you.\u201d\nOnce upon a time, that wouldn\u2019t have sat well with him, but Draco\u2019s known for a long time that Ron\u2019s friendship had been borne out of pity. He\u2019s made his peace with it. \u201cYes, well, I only agreed because I was too tired to fight you,\u201d he retorts, and Ron shrugs. He knew, as well. \u201cEither way\u2026 I don\u2019t regret it,\u201d he admits, yawning again. \u201cI should probably thank you from dragging me out from my cubicle that first day. You brought me and Harry together, and allowed me to die with friends by my side. I always thought I\u2019d do it alone.\u201d Ron\u2019s little grin turns sad, recognizing his words as the beginning of a goodbye.\nThere\u2019s a long silence. When he speaks, it\u2019s nothing that Draco expects. \u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d\nDraco debates whether or not he wants to be honest, but Ron is asking because he already knows, and Draco is more than aware of that. \u201cHe\u2019s my soulmate.\u201d It hurts to say.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in love with your soulmate. Sometimes it\u2019s platonic.\u201d\nDraco sighs heavily. His head lolls to the side along the back of the sofa. He wishes he were in bed; he\u2019s so tired. \u201cHe\u2019s Harry Potter.\u201d His expression must give away the graveness of the statement, so Ron just nods like he understands.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re you,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s final.\nHarry is Harry, and Draco is Draco. They\u2019ve always been tied together, and Draco has probably wanted Harry before he knew he\u2019d been supposed to have him, though he can\u2019t pinpoint the when or why.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go,\u201d Ron tells him gently, and Draco nods. Ron helps him upstairs and back to bed, leading him up the stairs and past Walburga\u2019s portrait. He even tucks him in.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Draco whispers, but his eyes are already closing. He feels Ron squeeze his arm gently, but doesn\u2019t hear a response.\nHe drifts.\n***\nA week passes. Draco knows he\u2019s running out of time, but he can\u2019t make his mouth say what it needs to. When Hermione and Ron come over for dinner, Ron just looks at him, but Draco doesn\u2019t know what to tell him. He hasn\u2019t found the words.\nHarry reads to him. He can\u2019t stay awake very long anymore when he does, but Draco still likes to listen. He stops eating and he\u2019s generally so cold he doesn\u2019t get out of bed. The second he leaves his magically warmed blankets, he shivers and has to hug himself for warmth he just doesn\u2019t have. He can\u2019t leave Grimmauld, because the wards will probably stop his weak heart when he goes through them, and he has to ask Kreacher not to apparate into his room, as the residual magic makes his chest constrict too much.\nHe\u2019s dying. He\u2019d never really known what dying felt like \u2013 he thought he did, but he didn\u2019t. This is like nothing else. This final stretch is tearing him apart.\nHarry takes off from work, and starts spending almost all of his time at home, entertaining Draco or just taking care of him. He makes soup almost aggressively, because it\u2019s the only thing that Draco can keep down. He brushes Draco\u2019s hair \u2013 though Draco hasn\u2019t been vain enough to care in a long time \u2013 and opens his window to let the sunshine and fresh air in. When he\u2019s not actively grieving Draco, he acts as though nothing is wrong. For several days, Draco lives with a Harry Potter who not only seems to love him, but would do anything for him. It\u2019s not organic, but he can see the pieces shine through that are just naturally Harry \u2013 the kindness, the tendency to take care of people better than he does himself, the ability to smile even when everything else is going wrong.\nDraco loves him.\nThis is why, five days after Healer Clearwater\u2019s visit, he turns to Harry, who\u2019s lying next to him in bed and reading a horror novel aloud, and says, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\nHarry pauses, then lays the book on his lap. \u201cYou gonna give up all your secrets? I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t; it\u2019ll be morbid and depressing.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s lips quirk up into a tired smile (everything he does is tired. He misses having enough energy to leave his room). \u201cI don\u2019t have any secrets from you anymore. Well, except for the one.\u201d He\u2019s not trying to be cryptic \u2013 it\u2019s really just an offhand comment, but Harry\u2019s eyebrows go up. He coughs a little, nervously, but he forces himself to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you, but I need to.\u201d\nSomething serious and grave settles over Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything. If you\u2019re trying to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, give us closure or something, I don\u2019t want to hear it. I don\u2019t want you to talk like you\u2019re about to die.\u201d\n\u201cI am about to die,\u201d he says, exasperated. \u201cYou can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m not, and fuck you very much, I need to say this for me as much as you need to hear it. It\u2019s important. It could change everything.\u201d\nHarry visibly grows more upset. \u201cI don\u2019t want everything to change, though \u2013 I don\u2019t want your confession, especially if it's something bad. Whatever it is, you don\u2019t need to make things stressed now; I\u2019ll be happier not knowing. I want us to be happy right until\u2026\u201d He trailed off, swallowing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important, Potter,\u201d Draco huffs, struggling to sit. He coughs again \u2013 this time from the pressure in his chest and lingering pneumonia \u2013 and Harry softens, moving to push him back onto his pillow.\n\u201cMerlin, Draco, stop,\u201d he sighs. \u201cFine. If it\u2019s that important, tell me. I just don\u2019t want you to feel the need to tell me things just because you think it\u2019s the thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the thing to do,\u201d Draco disagrees. \u201cAnd this is something\u2026\u201d He swallows. He can\u2019t explain it, or explain himself.\nThere\u2019s a very long moment where Harry just looks to him, concerned and ever so slightly curious. Then, he just says it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyebrows furrow in confusion. \u201cWhat is?\u201d\nDraco doesn\u2019t answer him properly, but he feels his own expression weaken into something vulnerable and afraid. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. When it first happened, you seemed so angry, so offended I even spoke to you, that I figured\u2026 I figured it was better for us both if I didn\u2019t say anything. I thought it would be a bother for you, that you\u2019d feel obligated to \u2013 I just didn\u2019t want to make a bigger problem than there already was, and I felt\u2026 crushed. I didn\u2019t want to reveal that pain to you.\u201d\nRealization \u2013 and horror \u2013 is dawning on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cA bigger problem? Are you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d\nHe presses his lips together tightly, bottom lip wobbling, but after a minute he nods, his hair mused against his pillow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOnce we became friends, I didn\u2019t know how to tell you, and I didn\u2019t want you to feel obligated to me. I just wanted to be friends, to know what it was like to be around you. I wasn\u2019t trying to take advantage.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a storm brewing in Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou weren\u2019t trying to take advantage. You just became my friend, to torture me by letting me watch you die \u2013 you just wanted to\u2026 fuck, Draco.\u201d He hangs his head, pressing his palms against his eyes. \u201cI cannot believe you, you \u2013 you berk.\u201d He drops his hand, looking over with suspiciously glossy, wet eyes. \u201cWhen you said that it\u2019s me, you meant that I\u2019m your soulmate, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe nods, and Harry makes a low, angry sound. Draco squeezes his eyes shut, immediate regret hitting him, but then Harry brackets his face in both hands and turns his head so that when Draco opens his eyes, he\u2019s looking right up at Harry\u2019s devastated expression.\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who rejected you,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s not a question. \u201cFuck, that day when we ran into each other outside of Fortescue\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s when it happened, wasn\u2019t it? When the bond broke?\u201d\nHe swallows and nods. Harry\u2019s hands move with him, not leaving his pale, wan cheeks. \u201cIt didn\u2019t get a chance to form on your end,\u201d he says in a voice so low it\u2019s hardly audible. \u201cI felt this sick feeling in my chest and stomach, like a spell had hit me down to my magic core, but I didn\u2019t realize what happened until I looked down and saw the string.\u201d He glances down at it now, holding the hand up to follow where it goes, ash grey, from his pinky to Harry\u2019s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two years,\u201d Harry mutters, half to himself. He looks as crushed as Draco feels. \u201cAnd you wanted to suffer in silence instead of tell me.\u201d He meets Draco\u2019s gaze. \u201cI thought\u2026 you had to know I\u2019d take it back, didn\u2019t you? I wouldn\u2019t have let you get like this. I never would.\u201d\n\u201cBut I wanted you to want me,\u201d Draco explains, and it comes out a low, pained whine. \u201cRon\u2019s told you, hasn\u2019t he? Soulmates are like fairytales to wizards, Harry \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to have a soulmate who put up with me because he had to. I wanted to be loved, and after a while, I just loved you so much I couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He shuts his eyes again to slow the tears, but they slip out anyway, sliding hotly down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not good at vulnerability.\u201d\nHarry leans down, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cMerlin, Draco. I can\u2019t believe you. I\u2026\u201d He makes a soft sound himself. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of crying over you, Jesus \u2013 I take it back, Draco, okay? I take it back. I want you and I\u2019ve wanted you for months and I never said anything because I knew you had a soulmate you loved.\u201d Draco sobs aloud, and Harry shudders, too. \u201cI\u2019ll fix this,\u201d he chokes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so good together, haven\u2019t we? We can do it for real now that you\u2019ve finally told me; I can fix us and the bond and \u2013\u201c\nThere\u2019s a sharp, hot feeling in his chest. It\u2019s not exactly pleasant, but he feels complete for the first time in years.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Harry whispers, and when Draco looks up at him his eyes are tightly shut. He doesn\u2019t seem to care about the tears streaming down his face. For several minutes, neither of them say anything, but Draco reaches a hand up to wrap around Harry\u2019s neck and pull him closer.\nHe sees a flash of red on his hand and trembles, pulling his other hand up to clutch at Harry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hid it and never gave you a chance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I let my anger get the best of me back when you tried to fix things between us.\u201d He tosses his book to the foot of the bed and shifts so that his entire body is pressed against Draco\u2019s like it had been the night of Healer Clearwater\u2019s visit. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry that I did this to you.\u201d\nDraco takes a deep breath. \u201cTo be fair\u2026 with our history, you had every right not to want anything to do with me. You kept me out of Azkaban; you didn\u2019t owe me anything, your friendship or otherwise.\u201d\nThe response is a strong surge of feeling from their soulbond, and Draco gasps aloud at the strength of Harry\u2019s regret, affection, and a complicated emotion closest to relief. \u201cI can feel your emotions,\u201d Harry murmurs. He pulls away, and Draco brushes a lock of messy brown hair out of his face. Harry\u2019s face is so terribly open; Draco can see every emotion he feels just as easily as he feels it through their bond. \u201cDo you really love me?\u201d Harry asks, hesitant. \u201cThere was always something about you, but I didn\u2019t ever think we could get along like this. Do you think we can make this work?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Draco replies, halting. \u201cI used to think that we\u2019d never be able to put our differences aside, but once the bond was in place\u2026 even broken, I could feel it, all the ways we would work together and the ways I could love you if I had half a chance.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d Harry told him, and Draco nods. \u201cI could love you, too. So easily. I just need you to hang on a bit longer.\u201d He gives a slightly disbelieving laugh, like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s saying what he is. \u201cI\u2019ll be mad about you lying to me later, once you\u2019re better. The bond is complete now \u2013 will you get better?\u201d\nDraco swallows. \u201cThis far along\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I hope so.\u201d But he\u2019s still tired \u2013 his body still aches \u2013 and he\u2019s not sure if his magic can even come back now that it\u2019s been so thoroughly exhausted.\nHe wonders what a recovery would look like for him, and if he\u2019ll ever find out.\n\u201cWhen you get better,\u201d Harry says slowly, firmly, like he can will it into existence by saying it. \u201cWhen you get better, I\u2019ll be mad, but I\u2019m going to love you, Draco. I\u2019ll make it up to you for letting this happen, and then you\u2019ll make\u00a0it up to me for lying. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nDraco, surprising himself, finds it in him to smirk. \u201cQuid pro quo. Spoken like a Slytherin.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s startled little laugh is the best thing he\u2019s heard all week, and it gives him hope.\n***\nHe doesn\u2019t get better overnight. Harry hopes that he will, the absurd man, but Draco is just pleased that he wakes up the next day. And the next, and the next after that \u2013 long enough that the week after their bond is properly sealed, they call in Healer Clearwater only for her to burst into tears at the sight of him. She's not usually overly emotional, but Draco fancies that Healing probably takes a lot out of a person; life-or-death experiences are intense, and they've become something like friends as well. He'd probably cry from relief, too, if it were the other way around.\nPenelope comes to give him a hug, and she looks between them with knowing, reddened eyes. \u201cYou two fixed things?\u201d\nHarry nods. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I swear \u2013 when he told me, I took it back right away. I hadn\u2019t even meant to truly reject him in the first place; I had no idea.\u201d\nPenelope waves him off. \u201cNo one knows they\u2019re rejecting their soulmate. So long as you two have sorted things out, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d She turns to grin down at Draco, proud and relieved. \u201cI want you to know that I haven\u2019t lost a patient in my direct care yet, and I was terrified you\u2019d be the first.\u201d She squeezes his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not.\u201d \u00a0\nHe grins at her, still weak, but sitting upright in bed and feeling the best he has in months. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll live, then?\u201d\nShe nods. \u201cIf you\u2019ve allowed the bond to finish forming properly, so long as you take care of yourself the symptoms of bond death are totally reversible. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His smile freezes a little when he hears the word totally.\n\u201cEven my magic?\u201d he asks, and Harry\u2019s eyes widen. They\u2019d both thought and have been preparing for the eventuality that Draco\u2019s magic will never return. Draco\u2019s been struggling with the idea, but Penelope nods, looking unconcerned.\n\u201cYes, of course. Your magic is still present \u2013 your body and soul have just been too weak to sustain use of it. Your core shut down, but you\u2019re a magical being; there\u2019s no real damage, just dormancy.\u201d Draco\u2019s not ashamed to say that he almost cries again, and Penelope smiles gently. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Draco, and more importantly, you have a long life to live with your soulmate. You\u2019re lucky.\"\n\u201cThank you, Healer Clearwater,\u201d Harry says, and he beams at her. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes.\u201d I knew you when you were a snot-nosed kid; you can call me by my name. But you\u2019re welcome.\u201d She gives Draco\u2019s shoulder another squeeze, and pulls away. \u201cAt this point, you should be fine. Stay in bed and don\u2019t return to work until you can stay upright for more than an hour without fatigue, but other than that you shouldn\u2019t need to check in with me unless you\u2019d like to. It\u2019s an easy downhill journey now, Draco.\u201d\nThey say their goodbyes. Harry sees her out shortly thereafter, but when he comes back, he presses a hard, fast kiss to Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me, asshole,\u201d Harry tells him, still grinning so wide his face must ache. The feeling that\u2019s blooming from the bond is bright like the sun. \u201cYou and me, we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d\n***\nFour months later, Draco and Harry debut in the Prophet. It isn\u2019t their idea, but Draco has to admit that the photo Dennis Creevy gets of them isn\u2019t a bad one \u2013 he\u2019s wearing smart grey trousers and a navy sweater, fashionably muggle, and there\u2019s a healthy flush to his cheeks. Next to him, Harry squeezes his hand on repeat, looking the happiest he\u2019s ever appeared in the papers.\nThe article is suitably sensationalist, but the tone is friendly and the end result is that\u00a0some people begin (very slowly) to warm up to him.\u00a0With Harry at his side, he\u2019s offered an opportunity to take his NEWTS \u2013 an opportunity previously denied to him. He gets Os in Potions, Runes, and Charms, and Es in the rest, which is more than enough to get him a tentative apprenticeship offer as well. He gets permission from the Ministry to leave his job in the mailroom \u2013 with the flimsy excuse that he\u2019s showing evidence of rehabilitation.\nHe doesn\u2019t argue; he just takes the offer, and happily tells Quinley to go fuck himself like he\u2019s wanted to since he was forced to work under him.\u00a0The depression had messed him up something fierce and made it seem like there was no point in even responding to the insults or cruel statements, but since their bond healed, he's found himself bouncing back emotionally. He's sarcastic and irritable sometimes, but he's also largely playful and curious, and he feels more like himself than he has in ages.\nBlaise floo-calls him and tells him that he\u2019s glad Draco\u2019s feeling better. He never wanted to press, but apparently he\u2019s been worried for months that Draco wasn\u2019t well. It doesn\u2019t make up for his absence \u2013 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he cares about Draco in any way that matters \u2013 but it makes him feel better, and he thanks Blaise and says he\u2019s doing fine. He feels better after the conversation regardless.\nHis life doesn\u2019t miraculously become perfect, and he still gets spat on in public. There are days that Harry annoys the hell out of him, and days when he pisses Harry off \u2013 but their bond helps, and life wasn\u2019t perfect before the bond or even before the war. What he has instead is growth and a sense of contentment that changes a lot.\nHe heals, and when he goes to sleep at night, he follows the red string around his pinky to the man he loves, waiting for Draco to join him in bed.\nIt\u2019s enough.\n\u00a0"
