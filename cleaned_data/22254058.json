    "text": "i\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since Jaskier joined them on the road \u2013 them being Ciri and Geralt; since their group had exploded with liveliness and music and someone else to talk to other than Roach. In those two months, Ciri\u2019s quite sure Roach spoke to her than Geralt did. Don\u2019t get her wrong, she likes Geralt. But he\u2019s not exactly an easy conversationalist.\nStill, he always puts her first. The best bits of rabbit in her rabbit stew or new shoes from the shoemaker while he patches his own up with old strips of leather. So, it\u2019s no surprise when they get to the tavern\u2013their first tavern in a week\u2013 that Geralt throws Ciri the key to her room.\n\u2018Jaskier and I will share.\u2019\nCiri looks down at the key. \u2018Aren\u2019t there enough rooms?\u2019\n\u2018Not enough coin,\u2019 Geralt grunts. \u2018Go. Bathe. I have to discuss a vampire contract with the mayor.\u2019\nWhen Geralt gets back, covered in what Ciri is quite sure is intestines, they eat quietly in the corner of the inn. Jaskier plays his music, his hat out for coins. He sings well, Ciri has to admit, and there\u2019s an entrancing quality about the way he performs, luring all eyes to him. Even Geralt\u2019s eyes seem to wander back to Jaskier, lingering on him just long enough that Ciri manages to steal a few mouthfuls of ale.\n\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that,\u2019 Geralt mutters as Ciri slides the large stein back in place.\n\u2018Girls in Cintra drink at ten,\u2019 Ciri replies matter-of-factly.\n\u2018No, they don\u2019t.\u2019 Geralt takes another mouthful of ale before sliding it towards Ciri. \u2018Don\u2019t let Jaskier see.\u2019\n\u2018Stealth training?\u2019\nGeralt rolls his eyes. \u2018Sure.\u2019\nLater, as Ciri prepares for bed\u2013not that the lump of hay and blankets in the middle of the room should be called a bed\u2013she hears arguing through the wall. Jaskier\u2019s voice raises an octave as he whines Geralt\u2019s name, long and loudly. It\u2019s not uncommon, they\u2019ve got into more rows than Queen Calanthe had battles since the bard\u2019s joined them on the road, and some days they spend hours alternating between bickering and ignoring each other. Even now, with a warm meal in their guts and roof over their head, they still find something to argue about. Ciri shakes her head and pulls the blankets over her shoulder.\n\n\nii\n\nIt\u2019s a week later when Jaskier sneezes so loudly it spooks Roach. Geralt soothes her with a murmur, glaring at Jaskier.\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he sniffs. \u2018Spring. Flowers. Ugh. My head\u2019s a mess.\u2019\nBy the time they make camp, Jaskier is shivering and pallid.\n\u2018You\u2019re sick,\u2019 Geralt says.\n\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019\n\u2018You look horrible,\u2019 Ciri adds, trying to be helpful.\nJaskier rolls his eyes. \u2018Thank you. Really.\u2019\nGeralt presses a hand to Jaskier\u2019s forehead. \u2018Obviously not sick enough if you\u2019re still mouthing off.\u2019\nCiri notices the edge of Geralt\u2019s mouth twitch as he drops his hand. \u2018There\u2019s a stream nearby. Go cool off. I\u2019m getting dinner. Ciri, you\u2019re in charge.\u2019\n\u2018What!\u2019 Jaskier shrieks as Geralt begins to trudge off into the thick forest around them in search of their dinner. \u2018She\u2019s a child.\u2019\n\u2018A child who can raze a city with a scream,\u2019 Geralt responds. \u2018She\u2019s in charge.\u2019\nJaskier huffs, but there\u2019s no real intention behind it but gathers his things to bathe. \u2018First Roach is in charge, now a child.\u2019\nGeralt gets back before Jaskier and makes quick work of the rabbit they\u2019re eating for dinner. He pours a little water into a kettle and lets it boil for a long while before adding crushed up flowers and a few curiosities from his backpack. Ciri watches Geralt silently from across the camp, trying to figure out the flowers he\u2019s used and why, hoping he\u2019ll explain before she needs to ask, but then Jaskier is trudging back to camp, dressed in a clean tunic. Still sniffing and groaning. \u00a0\nHe falls on his bedroll with a moan. Geralt takes the kettle off the fire and pours the tea into Jaskier\u2019s stew bowl.\n\u2018Drink.\u2019\nJaskier makes a face. \u2018What kind of potion you trying to force into me now, Witcher?\u2019\nGeralt touches Jaskier\u2019s forehead again as the bard blows over the tea.\n\u2018You\u2019re burning. Drink it.\u2019\nJaskier takes a slow sip. \u2018Wow,\u2019 he blanches. \u2018This is disgusting.\u2019\nGeralt glowers and tips the cup back to Jaskier\u2019s mouth. \u2018All of it.\u2019\n\u2018Yeah all right,\u2019 Jaskier huffs. \u2018Don\u2019t Axii me into it.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not. I\u2019m forcing you.\u2019\nWith a sigh, Jaskier downs the rest of the tea. Geralt stays by Jaskier\u2019s side and suddenly they\u2019re speaking too low for Ciri to hear and Jaskier is looking at Geralt all dreamlike, and Geralt shoots an arm out to straighten him.\n\u2018What have you done to me-,\u2019 Jaskier slurs as he leans forward on Geralt\u2019s body, face resting in the crook of his neck. Geralt hesitates before gently moving him off. Jaskier murmurs something Ciri can\u2019t hear and Geralt replies something equally hushed and then Geralt places him down on the bedroll gently.\nJaskier smiles, briefly, and then he\u2019s asleep.\nGeralt turns back to the fire. His amber eyes flick towards Ciri.\n\u2018Holy rope, elderflower and thyme treat colds in humans,\u2019 he says. \u2018Honey makes it taste better and enough Alcohest makes sure they stay out long enough for the others to take effect.\u2019\nThen, he leans forward and spoons them both a generous helping of rabbit stew.\n\u00a0\niii\nCiri stays at camp with Jaskier and Roach\u2013and is in charge again\u2013while Geralt takes care of a werewolf nearby. The night is silent and still. There is no wind and yet a shiver runs up Ciri\u2019s spine. Jaskier lounges by the fire and picks at his lute.\n\u2018Where is he?\u2019 Ciri asks Jaskier. \u2018He should be back by now.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019ll be back when the job is done,\u2019 Jaskier says as he strums. \u2018No use going after him. You\u2019ll just get in the way. I know from experience.\u2019\n\u2018But I could help,\u2019 she says.\n\u2018You\u2019re more help here. Protecting me,\u2019 Jaskier says but not like he believes it. Ciri huffs and resists the urge to stamp her foot. She hates being treated like a child but acting like one is only going to ensure that continues. Jaskier gives her a meaningful look as if he sees right through her. \u2018He\u2019ll be back.\u2019\n\u2018But what if he\u2019s not.\u2019\n\u2018Then he\u2019s dead.\u2019 Jaskier plucks a chord.\nShe is asleep before Geralt gets back to camp but wakes at the sound of Jaskier rising, of the sound of crushed forest underneath his feet, of Roach\u2019s whinnies Geralt presses a hand to her side. \u00a0\n\nAre you okay?\n\n\nI\u2019m fine. Go back to sleep.\n\n\nLet me help you out of your armour.\n\n\nCiri-\n\n\nShe\u2019s asleep. She was worried about you.\n\n\nHm.\n\nCiri opens her eyes. The fire is banked but still burns lowly and in the dim light she can see the outlines of their bodies pressed close.\n\nYour eyes\u2013 \n\n\nThey\u2019ll wear off.\n\nGeralt moves slightly, obstructing her vision. Jaskier brings his arms up to Geralt's neck to unfasten the buckles of his armour, but then there\u2019s the sound of something wet \u2013 blood maybe? \u2013 and Geralt lets out a long, tired sigh.\n\nYou\u2019re really okay?\n\n\nNot my first werewolf, Jas. \n\nCiri\u2019s never heard call him Jas. It\u2019s so loose and easy, the name falls from his mouth so naturally that all at once Ciri feels uncomfortable listening in on a conversation not meant for her. She closes her eyes and makes a show of rolling over, but if they notice her, neither say anything.\n\u00a0\niv\n\nThe winter is bitingly cold. They\u2019re down to their last few coins. Work has been scarce. Coin scarcer. Last night they\u2019d all shared a room in a run-down tavern after Jaskier had agreed to sing for a roof over their head and old potatoes in their stomach. On the road, it\u2019s even worse. The land is covered in snow. Occasionally Geralt tracks a rabbit, but the meat is lean and barely feeds the three of them. Sometimes he\u2019ll come back empty-handed, muttering that the doe he\u2019d tracked was pregnant. They go to sleep hungry most nights.\nTheir empty stomachs lead to irritable heads. Geralt and Jaskier fight more often now. There are fewer bickers and more quarrels. In the longest one, they did not speak to each other for two days. Geralt remarked that it was the quietest it had been for a long time. Ciri had to agree.\nThey hear that Yennefer is in Oxenfurt and decide to change course. Despite the harshness of the winter, there will be coin to make in Oxenfurt from people who don\u2019t rely on the land. It\u2019s still a day\u2019s ride away, so they camp off the road. Jaskier finds an old cabbage on the remains of some poor bastard who\u2019s been mauled by wolves. A cabbage and eight marks.\nJaskier makes a stew out of the old cabbage. It\u2019s awful. They all know it is. Still, no one says a thing.\nIt\u2019s late at night when Ciri wakes to the movement of Geralt\u2019s bedroll. He walks away from camp to piss, adjusting Roach\u2019s blanket as he comes back. Ciri closes her eyes as his gaze sweeps over her.\n\u2018Jaskier.\u2019 A hushed whisper. Jaskier groans sleepily. \u2018It\u2019s freezing. Get over here.\u2019\n\u2018Mmkay.\u2019\nCiri hears the rustle of bodies and Jaskier\u2019s murmur of thanks before everything settles down again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nv\nYennefer\u2019s gone by the time they arrive in Oxenfurt (Of course she is Geralt mutters when he hears of the news) but the day isn\u2019t wasted: there\u2019s a couple of Drowners harassing the edges of the city, and Jaskier finds himself a spot at a local tavern.\n\u2018Coming then?\u2019 Geralt asks Ciri as they prepare to part ways.\n\u2018Geralt,\u2019 Jaskier says sternly. \u2018It\u2019s too dangerous.\u2019\n\u2018Never stopped you.\u2019\n\u2018I know but,\u2019 Jaskier hesitates and looks between Ciri and Geralt. \u2018Fine. I\u2019ll go put Roach away.\u2019\nCiri almost skips alongside Geralt as they make their way down to the shoreline. She\u2019s ordered to stay back on the shoreline and observe, keeping mind of Geralt\u2019s pack. The Drowners gracefully rise from the water, advancing on Geralt as he wades deeper. A flash of his sword and they fall. When he\u2019s sure they\u2019re all gone, he calls Ciri out into the shallows.\nCiri toes off her boots and hitches up her skirts as she wades out. Geralt has a dagger in one hand and the skull of a Drowner in the other, prying it open gruesomely.\n\u2018Drowner\u2019s brains,\u2019 he says as he fishes the organ out. It\u2019s not big \u2013 the size of Geralt\u2019s fist. \u2018Key ingredient for Swallow. Get them while you can. As soon as you run out, chances are you\u2019ll be fucked to find one.\u2019\nGeralt grabs another Drowner head and fishes out the brain and tongue before leading Ciri back towards the shoreline.\n\u2018Blood moss,\u2019 he points out as Ciri puts her shoes back on. \u2018Good for treating wounds. Staunches the bleeding.\u2019\nJaskier is singing when they enter the tavern. They\u2019re dry but no less stinking of seawater. But the stench is a mark of victory, evidence of a hard day\u2019s work done. When Geralt offers her a mouthful of his ale, she drinks it down greedily. There\u2019s not much to say for the taste \u2013 she doesn\u2019t really like beer. She likes what it represents.\nJaskier finishes his song and comes over to greet them, much to the disappointment of the gathering crowd. Immediately, his face screws up. \u00a0\n\u2018You both reek like a festering pond.\u2019\nGeralt shrugs. \u2018Drowner\u2019s smell.\u2019\n\u2018I have enough coin for two rooms upstairs. Go get cleaned up.\u2019 Then, he reaches down to grab Geralt\u2019s ale and takes a swig. \u2018And don\u2019t think I missed you giving the child your beer.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m thirteen!\u2019 Ciri says.\n\u2018She\u2019s thirteen.\u2019 Geralt reiterates.\nJaskier huffs, exasperated. \u2018Bathe. Both of you.\u2019\nGeralt rolls his eyes and finishes his beer as Jaskier sparks up another tune.\n\u2018Come on,\u2019 he mutters. \u2018We need to brush down Roach.\u2019\nThey eat dinner in the tavern while Jaskier plays away. Ciri\u2019s lost count of how much coin he\u2019s collected now. Geralt does a good job of pretending not to listen to him, but now and then he winces at the bard\u2019s lyrics. Most of the songs, after all, are about Geralt.\nCiri\u2019s about to excuse herself for a bath \u2013 the brine smell was fun for a while, but now she just feels sticky, when suddenly there\u2019s a commotion on the other side of the tavern. Lute string twinge. Someone cries out, \u2018Shut the fuck up, Witcher whore!\u2019\nGeralt rises to his feet immediately as Ciri cranes her neck to see the commotion. There\u2019s a group of drunk men on the other side of the room, all crowding around Jaskier.\n\u2018Now, now, fellas,\u2019 he tries to placate them. \u2018They\u2019re just, you know, the greatest hits. I can play others if you have a request.\u2019\nOne of the men sneers loudly. \u2018Sounds to me like you know how to wield his silver sword.\u2019\n\u2018Go to your room,\u2019 Geralt tells Ciri.\n\u2018But-.\u2019 Suddenly, Jaskier lets out a cry and Geralt is across the room in a flash. He catches the second fist flying towards Jaskier\u2019s face in one hand as his other uppercuts. The drunk man heaves, tips forward, and vomits out onto the floor.\nAnother comes at him and Geralt catches him by the collar. Jaskier finds Ciri and takes her by the shoulders.\n\u2018Come on, we should go upstairs.\u2019\nShe doesn\u2019t want to go upstairs. She wants to watch.\n\u2018Fuck you,\u2019 the drunken man wheezes as he fights against Geralt\u2019s grip. \u2018Get your filthy hands off me, Witcher.\u2019\nCiri watches as Geralt tosses the drunken man out the door and into the mud and shit by the horse posts. The crowd cheer drunk off ale and the action. The barmaid straightens out the rest of the crew, hauling the vomiting man to his feet and out the door. A few of the others spit at Geralt as they file out of the tavern.\nJaskier cradles a sore as the barmaid gives them another round, on the house. There\u2019s a foul mood prickling off Geralt; Ciri doesn\u2019t bother asking him for a sip, but she needs to know\u2013\n\u2018Why did they spit at you?\u2019\n\u2018Because they don\u2019t like me,\u2019 Geralt replies reluctantly. He pauses, clarifies. \u2018What I am.\u2019\n\u2018So they hurt Jaskier?\u2019 Ciri asks and catches Jaskier\u2019s wary glance at Geralt.\n\u2018Because they were too shit scared to fight me.\u2019\nShe turns to Jaskier now. \u2018Why did they call you the-,\u2019\n\u2018Okay, a lot of questions for tonight,\u2019 Jaskier cries suddenly with a nervous laugh. \u2018Would you look at the time. It\u2019s late. Time for bed.\u2019\nHe swallows another mouthful of his beer before sliding the stein towards Geralt and corrals Ciri from her seat. She\u2019s thirteen. She\u2019s been travelling with them long enough to know all the bad words and what they mean\u2013hell, half of all words Geralt speaks are the bad words. She knows what whore means. But she doesn\u2019t know why they\u2019d call Jaskier such a thing, especially when he can barely wield a dagger, let alone a silver sword of his own.\nJaskier sees Ciri to her room. His, of course, is next door. \u2018Best to get some rest. We\u2019re back on the road tomorrow if Yennefer doesn\u2019t show up.\u2019\n\u2018What about Geralt?\u2019\nJaskier shrugs. \u2018He\u2019s fine. Just drowning his feelings. Or whatever things Witchers have in place of them.\u2019\nEight months on the road with Geralt, now six with Jaskier, and she knows that Witcher\u2019s have feelings. Muted ones. Badly communicated ones. But feelings none-the-less. She hears Geralt comes up the stairs not thirty minutes later. His gate his staggered from the booze but she knows it\u2019s him. The walls of the tavern are thin, even if they keep their voices down low.\n\nWhat happened to not getting involved in the squabbles of men? \n\n\nSeems I do. All of the time. \n\nA pause.\n\nI should have killed him.\n\n\nNot in front of Ciri, Geralt. Ouch, it still stings. Be gentle.\n\n\nHm. I have a salve in my backpack. Take off your clothes.\n\n\nAlways the romantic. \n\nTheir hushed voices eventually die down like the flames in her fireplace and Ciri drifts to sleep.\n\u00a0\nvi\nIt\u2019s a cold spring morning when Ciri wakes up before both Jaskier and Geralt. Even Roach is still asleep, lying on her side underneath a tree, her reigns looped around one of the branches. Ciri wonders if even if she wasn\u2019t tethered, would she walk off?\nShuffling out of her bedroll, Ciri straightens out her clothing and casts an eye across the campsite. Geralt and Jaskier are sleeping against each other like they did that winter\u2019s night. Geralt\u2019s arm is draped over Jaskier\u2019s hip. The blanket\u2019s been tossed of Geralt during the night, revealing his bare chest. The early morning light catches his scars.\nShe leaves the campsite to relieve herself nearby. While early spring still kept some of the winter\u2019s bite, it hadn\u2019t been a particularly cold night.\nAnd then the words of the drunken fool come back to her, as fresh as the day they were spoken, despite it being almost a month ago. She recalls the late-night arguments, the heady look in Jaskier\u2019s eyes as he\u2019d succumbed to Geralt\u2019s tonic, the gentle words and touches she\u2019s brushed off as concern, and the unspoken agreement that whenever they\u2019re in a tavern, Ciri gets a room to herself and they share\u2013despite since their few days in Oxenfurt, their purses have been heavy with coin.\nWhen she gets back to camp, Geralt is awake. His armour his back on. His bedroll is packed away. The only evidence of Ciri having seen what she saw is the way Jaskier\u2019s body is peculiarly curled on his bedroll, like how scales of a fish slip perfectly against one another.\nGeralt nudges Jaskier with the toe of his boot. \u2018Up.\u2019\n\u00a0\nvii\nCiri quickly realises that Jaskier doesn\u2019t like Yennefer. He bristles at her tone and Yennefer revels in his annoyance. She\u2019s gorgeous and Jaskier\u2019s jealous. Even Ciri can see this as Yennefer welcomes Geralt into her lavish Ovenfurt apartment.\n\u2018Glad to have found you at home,\u2019 Jaskier mutters. \u2018For once.\u2019\n\u2018Been busy,\u2019 Yennefer shrugs. \u2018Drink?\u2019\nThey don\u2019t so much catch up as Yennefer tells Geralt exactly what she thinks, the moment she thinks it, whether he\u2019ll like it or not. And he doesn\u2019t like being told he\u2019ll have to travel to Skellige. At least, Ciri thinks, she\u2019ll get a straight answer out of Yennefer. She just as to get the witch alone.\nIt happens just after dinner. Geralt is outside brushing down Roach and Jaskier is letting himself turn into a prune in the bathtub upstairs. Ciri approaches Yennefer just as she finishes writing a letter and says, \u2018May I ask you something?\u2019\nYennefer raises an eyebrow. \u2018You just did.\u2019\nShe hesitates, unsure how to phrase it and worried about being rebuked. It\u2019s not her business, of course. Still.\n\u2018What are they to each other?\u2019\nYennefer\u2019s face cracks into a smile. \u2018Your guess is as good as mine, child.\u2019\n\u00a0\nviii\nThey run into trouble just outside of Brugge. A contract on a Griffin goes awry. It swoops down low and diverts its course at the last second. Geralt ducks and rolls. Jaskier doesn\u2019t.\nThe tear in the flesh of his back is deep, but Geralt says it\u2019s missed his spine. Still, it doesn\u2019t placate Ciri\u2019s worry as Jaskier screeches and cries in Geralt\u2019s arms until he finally, finally uses Axii to knock him out and take him back to camp.\nJaskier bleeds all over Geralt\u2019s bedroll as Geralt makes fast work of stitching up the wound. It doesn\u2019t take long. Ciri helps by giving Geralt things as he needs them \u2013 a warm cloth, a hot needle, blood moss, salve to rub on the bloody stitches that now run jaggedly down three inches of Jaskier\u2019s left shoulder. Eventually, he rolls Jaskier up into the sleeping bag and drinks a long guzzle of whatever liquid is in his flask. Then, he hands it to Ciri.\n\u2018Here.\u2019\nCiri takes the flask apprehensively. It mustn\u2019t be potions because Geralt\u2019s eyes are clear and amber and wild.\n\u2018It\u2019s a Redanian spirit. It\u2019ll help you sleep.\u2019\nAnything to get the sound of Jaskier\u2019s scream out of her head. Ciri takes a long gulp and it burns all the way down. She coughs as Geralt takes his flask back.\n\u2018Will he be okay?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019ll be fine. The cut wasn\u2019t as deep as I\u2019d feared.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s not going to die?\u2019 she looks down at the bedroll. It\u2019s stained with blood.\n\u2018Not if I can help it.\u2019\nJaskier groans a little between them and begins to stir. Geralt\u2019s eyes light up as me makes a hand signal and then Jaskier is peaceful again.\n\u2018Axii,\u2019 he explains to her unspoken question. \u2018Manipulates the mind. Calms down humans and beasts alike. In battle, it could make a Manticore fight alongside you. Like this,\u2019 he motions to Jaskier. \u2018You can use it to take away the pain.\u2019\nHe takes another sip from his flask and looks to Ciri. \u2018You good?\u2019\nCiri nods apprehensively. \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018Get some rest. We need to get him to Brugge tomorrow.\u2019\nCiri slides into her bedroll. They haven\u2019t eaten tonight, but it\u2019s no matter. She couldn\u2019t stomach it anyway and the spirits feel warm and heavy in her belly.\nIt\u2019s not a long way to Brugge and Jaskier rides on Roach, pressed against Geralt\u2019s chest. When they arrive, Geralt manages to negotiate for two rooms at the local Inn. If the Innkeeper feels sorry for Jaskier, the bloodied and unconscious mess in Geralt\u2019s arms, he certainly doesn\u2019t reduce his price. Occasionally he stirs, but Geralt does something to silence him again, feeds him a little potion, casts magic on him.\n\u2018It\u2019s easier this way,\u2019 he says to Ciri\u2019s silent question.\nJaskier wakes up in the late afternoon, groaning. Ciri\u2019s immediately by his side.\n\u2018You\u2019re awake.\u2019\n\u2018Am I?\u2019 Jaskier mutters. \u2018Ah, fuck, my shoulder.\u2019\n\u2018The Griffon snared you.\u2019\nJaskier groans and adjusts against the hay mattress. \u2018Yes, of course, that beast.\u2019 His eyes search the room. \u2018Geralt?\u2019\n\u2018With Roach downstairs,\u2019 she says. \u2018He told me to give you water if you woke up, do you want some?\u2019\n\u2018Not just yet, thank you, Ciri.\u2019\nCiri sits by his bedside as Jaskier shifts and tries to get comfortable.\n\u2018He was worried about you, you know,\u2019 she says after a long while. \u2018I could tell.\u2019\nJaskier lets out a half-laugh. \u2018Good, maybe he\u2019ll treat me a little better,\u2019 but there\u2019s no real malice in it.\nWhen Geralt appears at the doorway ten minutes later, Ciri feels it best that she leave them alone. Closing the door behind her, she hears Jakier\u2019s loud moan as he\u2019s shifted on the bed.\n\nFuck, Geralt, my head. What did you Axii me into brain trauma?\n\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\n\nCiri knows she should keep going. It\u2019s wrong to listen in on them like this. Geralt probably knows. But she can\u2019t make herself move.\nYou need to eat. You\u2019ve been out almost a day. Steps come toward the door. Ciri panics. She's going to get caught listening in, she's going to-\n\nWait. Stay here a moment. I\u2019m not hungry.\n\nThe boots stop. Turn. Walk back to the bed.\nSit down\u00a0Jaskier again. There's a shuffle. Ciri presumes Geralt sits.\n\nMy one thought when that Griffin swooped was that I was going to die without telling you that I love you. \n\n\nYour one thought when the Griffin swooped should have been to duck and roll. \n\n\nI\u2019m trying to do a thing here.\n\n\nI can see that. \n\n\nYou\u2019ve always been a man of few words, I get it. I don\u2019t expect you to tell me it back, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to hear it. \n\n\nJaskier\u2013\n\n\nI almost died, Geralt. Let me tell you I love you.\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t almost die.\n\n\nI was slashed open by a Griffin. I thought it had torn my arm off!\n\n\nAt worst, it\u2019s a deep scratch. \n\n\nYou\u2019re ridiculous! \n\nThen Ciri hears nothing and then a moan and perhaps Geralt is moving Jaskier again\u2013\n\nOh for god\u2019s sake, get in the bed, Geralt. \n\n\nCiri?\n\n\nShe\u2019s downstairs. Probably playing Gwent. Leave her. Get in the bed.\n\nThe sound of boots hitting the floor, not in movement but to be discarded is followed by the sound of Geralt\u2019s swords being thrown to the ground, then what Ciri presumes is his breastplate.\nSuddenly a game of Gwent doesn\u2019t sound like such a bad idea.\nix\n\u00a0\nThey arrive at the village an hour before the bandits descend.\nRumour has it they ride with a dragon. The alderman promises Geralt a tidy sum if he can dispatch them. Geralt accepts, and Ciri feels Jaskier\u2019s hand on her shoulder.\n\u2018This won\u2019t take long,\u2019 Geralt says as the stableboy secures Roach.\n\u2018Is it really a dragon?\u2019 Ciri asks. She can hear horses, the cry of men, growing closer. The villagers usher the children inside the Inn.\nGeralt hums. It\u2019s not really an answer. \u2018Get inside. Now.\u2019\nJaskier leads her inside the crowded Inn as Geralt slicks up his sword with oil and waits. Jaskier closes the door to the Inn, bars it with a table and a stool and ushers Ciri away from the window. She can hear them now, the bandits. The clash of steel and swords and the cry of a mighty beast. Perhaps there really is a dragon.\u00a0\nJaskier pushes Ciri down behind the bar and presses his body against her. He smells like sweat and dirt, and Ciri remembers they\u2019ve spent the past six nights camping and they\u2019d all thought getting to this village would lead to some relief. His body is warm where it is pressed against Ciri, but she can\u2019t ignore the chattering of his jaw.\n\u2018He\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 Ciri takes his hand gently.\nJaskier swallows nervously. Laughs a little. \u2018You know I\u2019m supposed to be the one comforting you.\u2019\nJaskier has no special powers except for the ones he holds over the Witcher, which he wields fairly and rarely ever abuses. Ciri wonders if he\u2019s aware he has the powers at all: if he knows that the Witcher bends to his whims easier than others, that his words turn his hard gazes soft.\nOutside, a cry. A scream of pain. Ciri tries to block out the noise and buries her head into Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. A hand comes up to smooth over her hair as Jaskier hums low in his throat like a parent would soothe a child, and while Ciri may be coming up to her fourteenth birthday, warmth blooms deep in her stomach and she relaxes into his embrace. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s a long while later when the door to the Inn swings open. The building is dark, the sun is dipping below the horizon and the air is hot with sour beer and perspiration. Jaskier looks over the bar and cries, \u2018Geralt!\u2019\nThey escape from behind the bar, sweeping out onto the street to survey the damage. He lays a hand on the alderman\u2019s shoulder, and the man startles at the sight of him.\n\u2018My coin,\u2019 he demands.\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 the Alderman splutters. \u2018I\u2019ll get you what is owed.\u2019\nCiri watches as Jaskier expertly weaves his way between them, his hands pressing to Geralt\u2019s chest.\n\u2018We\u2019ll collect the coin in a moment, let me check you\u2019re okay,\u2019 he says and the Alderman scampers out the door. Someone lights a torch and the light hits Geralt\u2019s face, bloodied and sweat-soaked and \u2013\n\u2018Your eyes,\u2019 Ciri stammers. \u2018Your face.\u2019\nGeralt opens his mouth to respond, but then Jaskier says, \u2018Geralt, your side.\u2019\n\u2018Arrow,\u2019 he grunts and Ciri sees the small hole in his armour. \u2018It\u2019s not deep.\u2019\nCiri can\u2019t stop looking at his face, at the bright veins against his pale skin, the darkness that envelops his eyes. She knows that his potions make him stronger, knows that there are side effects\u2013\nJaskier\u2019s not scared as his hands map over his body, and Ciri knows \u2013 knows \u2013 there\u2019s no reason to be scared of him, but she can\u2019t help the reaction of her body, can\u2019t stop the clenching of her stomach, because even though she knows this is the same Geralt who calls Jaskier over to cuddle in the middle of the night when he thinks she\u2019s asleep, the same Geralt who slips her beer when Jaskier isn\u2019t looking, he doesn\u2019t look like the same Geralt.\n\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 Geralt says as he gently brushes him off. \u2018I need a bath.\u2019\nAnd then he looks at Ciri \u2013 but looks is a loose word because it\u2019s only with the tilt of his chin that Ciri realises his blown-out gaze has fallen to her.\n\u2018Ciri.\u2019 He adds her name for benefit. \u2018You good?\u2019\nShe swallows down the cotton that coats her mouth. \u2018Yeah.\u2019\nGeralt nods in satisfaction and then takes the stairs to their room. Just the one room tonight \u2013 the Inn is small and putting up a number of families made homeless by the very same bandits Geralt\u2019s just decimated.\nCiri sticks close to Jaskier, watches as he arranges for Geralt\u2019s bath \u2013 the man just mowed down twenty bandits and a wyvern, if you could give him an ale as you prepare it, he\u2019ll be much obliged \u2013 and chases Geralt\u2019s coin \u2013 the Witcher took down a dragon, is that not worth giving his steed a little extra care?\u00a0 - and then to the stableman \u2013 the white mare would do us fine if it pleases you. I understand from the Witcher she is a war prize unless previously claimed \u2013 and then finally to the Innkeeper, who gives them a free meal each and takes a hot plate up to Geralt who Jaskier assures is still in the bath, and it\u2019s really best to leave him.\nJaskier is eating a boiled potato when Ciri says, \u2018Jaskier, um,\u2019 she looks at the bubbles rising in Jaskier\u2019s beer. \u2018His\u2026 face.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, what about it?\u2019 Jaskier asks as he takes a long sip of his beer.\u2019\n\u2018I mean his eyes.\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 Jaskier smiles a little. \u2018His Witcher face can be a little scary, I know. It\u2019s probably gone by now. Finish your meal. How good is this mutton? At least, I think it\u2019s mutton. Whatever it is, it\u2019s better than the rabbit from a few nights ago, right?\u2019\nJaskier tries to make small talk over dinner, but Ciri can\u2019t focus. She eats quietly and then Jaskier says, \u2018Well, I think these folks deserve a little music, don\u2019t you?\u2019 A pause. \u2018You should get some rest, Ciri, it\u2019s been a long day.\u2019\nShe follows Jaskier up to the room to retrieve his lute. Geralt is sitting by the fire, hair dripping, with a half-drunk stein as he grinds flowers into a paste.\n\u2018You look better,\u2019 Jaskier says with a smile and grabs his lute from the corner, where it rests with Grealt\u2019s swords. \u2018Thought I\u2019d give these people something to be happy about.\u2019\n\u2018Thought you\u2019d pull your weight, more like,\u2019 Geralt says but there\u2019s no bite in it. Jaskier ruffles his hair in response, and Geralt half-heartedly tries to reach out and swipe at him, but Jaskier is surprisingly quick when he wants to be.\n\u2018Back later,\u2019 he says fleetingly. \u2018Be good.'\nCiri lingers by the doorway as Geralt raises his beer to her as an invitation.\nShe hesitates. His eyes are bright amber again.\n\u2018You good?\u2019 he asks.\nShe nods. \u2018Your eyes. They\u2019re back to normal.\u2019\nHe lowers the beer, runs a hand over his face. \u2018Sorry if they scared you.\u2019\n\u2018Do they hurt?\u2019\n\u2018Not really.\u2019\nShe takes a step forward, settles by the fire. Geralt doesn\u2019t move. His hair drips wet patches onto his cream linen shirt.\n\u2018Did it hurt?\u2019 she says. \u2018To\u2026\u2019\nHe looks to the fire and a muscle in his jawline twinges. \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\nHe takes a small amount of salve from the bowl and places it on a small wound in his side. It\u2019s red and oozing blood onto Geralt\u2019s dark pants. \u2018You were afraid of me today.\u2019\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t-,\u2019\nHe gives her a look. Don\u2019t lie.\n\u2018I\u2019d never seen you like that,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was afraid for a moment. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t have to be sorry,\u2019 he replies. \u2018Fear is a natural instinct. You should question everything you encounter, even if it wears the skin of someone you know.\u2019\nA shiver runs down her spine. \u2018But Jaskier-,\u2019\n\u2018Jaskier moves first, speaks first but he thinks later,\u2019 Geralt replies. \u2018Jaskier has the survival instincts of someone who has never been in fear for their life. Learn many things from Jaskier, but not that.'\nA long silence settles between them. Geralt gently moves the stein towards Ciri.\n\u2018Drink it,\u2019 he mutters.\nShe grabs it and sips gingerly. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about him?\u2019 she asks after a long moment.\nGeralt lets out a loose sigh and throws another log into the flames.\u00a0\u2018Often.\u2019\n\u00a0\nx\n\u00a0\n\u2018You\u2019re being ridiculous, stop moving,\u2019 Jaskier tells him.\n\u2018Leave it, Jaskier,\u2019 Geralt snaps back.\nCiri sits by the fire, silently watching the commotion.\n\u2018Come on, don\u2019t you trust me?\u2019 Jaskier brandishes the blade like a threat. Geralt looks at him apprehensively.\n\u2018We\u2019re three days away from a village,\u2019 Geralt brushes him off. \u2018I\u2019ll see to it then.\u2019\n\u2018Or I can do it now,\u2019 Jaskier insists. \u2018Come on, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even recognise you.\u2019\nIt\u2019s probably been a month since Geralt shaved and his beard is almost three inches long, and all white. It makes him look older, that\u2019s for sure. Fearsome, Ciri thinks.\nUnkempt, Jaskier corrects.\n\u2018You don\u2019t trust me?\u2019\n\u2018With a blade? No.\u2019 Geralt replies. \u2018With my life? Also no.\u2019\nJaskier turns back to Ciri. \u2018Cirilla, tell Geralt he\u2019s being needlessly irritating and that I am an expert barber. Didn\u2019t I cut your hair last week?\u2019\n\u2018You did cut my hair last week,\u2019 Ciri replies evenly.\n\u2018And didn\u2019t I do a good job?\u2019\n\u2018It was adequate,\u2019 she considers. \u2018My hair is long. All one length.\u2019\n\u2018And I braided it so well,\u2019 Jaskier adds. \u2018It looked so sweet.\u2019\nGeralt takes the momentary lapse in concentration to snatch the razor from Jaskier\u2019s hand. Jaskier cries out a little but then the drama settles down, and they go to sleep.\nIn the morning, Ciri wakes up to find Geralt packing up the camp. The sun has crested the horizon but not the canopy of the forest, and mist hangs around them. Jaskier is still sleeping in his bedroll, back turned to the fire. Geralt turns to stir the fire back up for breakfast. His hair is damp around his shoulders, and his face is fresh and shaved clean.\n\u00a0\nxi\n\nThe pain isn\u2019t blinding. Seriously, if Jaskier can handle being sliced by a Griffin and Geralt can take down eight Drowners simultaneously, then she can handle this. The ache is nothing compared to their pain.\nCiri takes another drink from her waterskin, mouth try and fuzzy. Ahead, Jaskier is strumming on his lute, trying to compose a new song about lubberkins since Geralt has explained how a lubberkin was created over the fire last night. Ciri can\u2019t fathom the amount of pain something so little must endure becoming a botchling. Geralt is unsure if they even feel pain. Inflict it, sure. But feel? The jury\u2019s out.\nMuscle ripples through her stomach, eliciting a sharp gasp. Above her, Geralt looks down from Roach. It\u2019s the middle of the day and they haven\u2019t stopped for lunch yet. She feels strangely weak, despite having a decent breakfast at the last campsite.\nGeralt eyes her suspiciously and she almost snaps at him to mind his own business. Jaskier\u2019s lute twinges out of tune and Geralt stops the horse.\n\u2018Lunch,\u2019 he says, gaze still fixed on her. He\u2019s suspicious, and Ciri thinks a question sits on the edge of his tongue. Perhaps the ground will crack and swallow her whole.\nThey\u2019re collecting kindling for the small fire when Jaskier and Ciri stumble upon a stream, only a few hundred metres off the side of the road. Jaskier brings back clean water for Roach and Geralt steals a few cups of water to boil the eggs.\n\u2018I need to-,\u2019\nThey both turn to her.\n\u2018I, um-,\u2019\nJaskier frowns. \u2018Is everything okay, Ciri?\u2019\n\u2018I just have to\u2026,\u2019 she clears her throat. \u2018I\u2019m going to the stream to wash my hands. I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, good idea, I\u2019ll come with you,\u2019 Jaskier grins and steps forward. Geralt shoots out an arm, holding him back.\n\u2018Jaskier, help me with this,\u2019 though it\u2019s not immediately clear what this is, he nods at Ciri to continue.\nJaskier protests but Ciri can\u2019t hear Geralt\u2019s reply as she disappears into the scrubland.\nThe water is cool as she washes out the bloody rag into the stream, watching the flow of the water take the stain away. Quickly, she tears another strip from her petticoat and wraps the cotton into a ball. It\u2019s not a sustainable solution; eventually, she\u2019ll have no petticoat left. But she also has no money, and she can\u2019t ask Geralt for the money without him asking what\u2019s it for, and Jaskier would be even worse \u2013\n\u2018Ciri?\u2019 It\u2019s Jaskier. A branch snaps. \u2018Ciri?\u2019\nShit. \u2018I\u2019m coming!\u2019\nShe stuffs the cotton against herself and scrambles back to camp.\n\u00a0\n---\n\nThey cross the border between Temeria and Redania that afternoon and Jaskier breathes a sigh of relief.\n\u2018Ah, home!\u2019 he sighs, though the muddy road on the other side of the invisible border looks just the same as this side.\nCiri thinks of her home further south and wonders what the castle looks like now; if the village around is still standing. Nilfgaardians take no prisoners, that much she knows. If anyone knows what her Kingdom looks like now, it\u2019s Geralt, but she hasn\u2019t the heart to ask him.\nGeralt\u2019s also been watching her all afternoon. Not constantly, and not to be rude, but more than he used to. Sometimes she looks up to see him watching her and knows that he sees her watching him watching her, but then his gaze lazily turns back to the road, or to Jaskier, or to the sky. She finds it strange he doesn\u2019t try to hide that he\u2019s watching her.\nAnother ripple of pain.\n\u2018You\u2019re injured.\u2019\nCiri jumps. Roach has slowed, so now they\u2019re walking pace-by-pace, the steady sway of the mare beside her. Geralt is looking down at her, all amber eyes and his mouth a thin, tight line. \u00a0\n\u2018No, I\u2019m fine.\u2019\nRoach stops. Geralt dismounts.\n\u2018She\u2019s a smoother ride,\u2019 he says and holds out a hand.\nCiri looks between his hand and Roach\u2019s saddle. Ahead, Jaskier is deep in the third verse trying to rhyme something with hand. Sand? Land? \nCiri looks at the animal nervously. Roach is a tricky mare and Ciri\u2019s still getting to know her quirks. \u2018Will she let me?\u2019\n\u2018If I wish,\u2019 he says. \u2018You\u2019re obviously in pain.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\u2018So you admit it.\u2019\n\u2018Huh?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re in pain.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019\nGeralt looks at her like he\u2019s not going to go around in circles like this, not when he\u2019s quickly reaching his daily speaking quota and he may have to tell Jaskier off before the day is done yet.\nWith a sigh, Ciri takes Geralt\u2019s gloved hand and hoists herself up into Roach\u2019s saddle. The leather is warm and feels like butter between her thighs, but then something like lead settles into her stomach when she realises there are but a few layers between her and an accident that certainly will not come out of leather. Awkwardly she shoves the tattered hem of her petticoat between her thighs.\nGeralt spurs the mare on and they begin to catch up to Jaskier, who has continued on, engrossed in song. They ride in silence for a long while, Geralt holding Roach\u2019s reigns until finally, he says, \u2018There\u2019s no honour in it, Ciri.\u2019\n\u2018In what?\u2019 she squeaks. Her face is hot.\n\u2018Your pain is no less valid than anyone else\u2019s.\u2019\nA deep shame settles over her. \u2018How can you say that?\u2019 she seethes. \u2018Jaskier was attacked by a Griffin. You\u2019ve got hundreds of scars.\u2019\n\u2018Dozens,\u2019 he corrects.\nCiri wonders how he would know \u2013 perhaps someone had counted then all, numbered each scar that littered his entire body. A lute string twinges as if in answer.\n\u2018Pain is communication, Ciri. Your body tells you what it needs.\u2019 Geralt is about to say something else, but then Roach sneezes and the noise makes Jaskier turn.\n\u2018You let Ciri ride Roach!\u2019 cries Jaskier. He\u2019s stopped in his tracks now, letting them catch up. Geralt nudges his shoulder to keep moving as they pass.\n\u2018She\u2019s feeling unwell,\u2019 Geralt answers.\n\u2018She\u2019s feeling unwell,\u2019 he imitates badly as he scampers to catch up. \u2018I\u2019m sorry Ciri, I mean no offence, but I had to walk when I was getting blisters on blisters.\u2019\n\nYour pain is no less valid than anyone else\u2019s.\n\n\u2018Ignore him,\u2019 Geralt tells Ciri. \u2018He\u2019ll tire himself out. And he refused to wear the appropriate shoes.\u2019\n\u2018And that time when I fell down a flight of stairs and sprained my ankle.\u2019\n\u2018He was drunk,\u2019 Geralt tells Ciri, again.\n\u2018And that time you made me walk through a rushing river.\u2019\n\u2018He hadn\u2019t had a bath for three days.\u2019 Again, to Ciri. \u2018It was the lesser of two evils.\u2019\n\u2018Neither had you!\u2019\n\u2018Leather is uncomfortable when wet.\u2019\nJaskier groans in frustration and stamps forward a few paces before kicking at a rock.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nThey arrive at the town a few hours later and stop outside the Inn. Geralt helps Ciri dismount Roach and as she does so, presses a few coins into her hand. Behind him, Jaskier is checking out contracts on the local notice board.\n\u2018Geralt!\u2019 he calls. \u2018There\u2019s a notice here to take care of a moonwraith! You could do that!\u2019\nGeralt ignores him and crowds in close to Ciri. \u2018Buy what you need. The apothecary should help,\u2019 he tells her. \u2018Be back at the Inn by sundown.\u2019\n\u2018Geralt! Moonwraith!\u2019 Jaskier insists.\nGeralt sighs and turns to Jaskier. \u2018Yes, Jas, I can hear you.\u2019 A hand pushes Ciri gently on her way. \u2018I\u2019ll distract him for a bit, lest he pesters you.\u2019\n\u00a0\nLater, when Ciri is fed and dressed and in bed, she hears Jaskier on the other side of the wall.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Ciri, Geralt?\n\nHis tone is frank. To the point.\n\nNothing. \n\n\nDon\u2019t make me the idiot. You let her ride Roach.\n\nA pause. \n\nDrop it, Jaskier. \n\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you more concerned? Humans are fragile you know, one little sniffle and then whump, we\u2019re out. Like a candle. Extinguished.\n\n\nWatch I don\u2019t extinguish you.\n\n\nYou should have said \u2018watch I don\u2019t blow you out\u2019, that would have been funnier. I could have responded in a witty, dirty fashion, you know, as I do. As you like.\n\n\nHm.\n\n\nSeriously, you\u2019re not going to tell me? \n\n\nShe\u2019s a thirteen-year-old girl, Jaskier. Work it out for yourself. \n\nA pause. Ciri\u2019s face feels hot.\n\nIsn\u2019t there\u2026 like a potion or something that could help her?\n\n\nSurprisingly, they don\u2019t cover menstruation potions at Kaer Morhen. \n\n\nMaybe we ask Yennefer to talk to her. You know, woman-on-woman.\n\n\nGreat idea. Yennefer had her uterus ripped out when she was sixteen and pines to be with child. \n\n\nFuck.\n\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to her about it.\n\n\nGreat, so now we have to deal with emotional scarring. \n\n\nShe\u2019s not a child, Jaskier. It\u2019s likely not her first time. \n\n\nBut we should be there. To support her. You know, give her the birds and the bees talk.\n\n\nYou do that. \n\n\nUgh, Geralt!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nxii\n\nTwo weeks later and they\u2019ve killed too many Drowners to count, a moonwraith and a cured a Striga. The Striga cure is particularly hard on Geralt. He spends two days recovering from his injuries and the sheer exhaustion of fighting a Striga all night. Their rooms are paid for in town, and though there\u2019s enough coin for three \u2013 seeing as it\u2019s not their coin \u2013 Jaskier and Geralt still insist (perhaps insist is too hard of a word here, rather they try to fall into it naturally without arousing suspicion) on sharing. Ciri supposes it\u2019s perhaps the only time they get to themselves, without her.\nShe is na\u00efve perhaps, but she is not dumb. Cintra had sheltered her from the harshness of everyday life, yes, but she knew what love was. She\u2019d seen it between her grandmother and Eist, her mother and father.\nGeralt and Jaskier are obviously in love.\nAt first, she had thought it was simply a brotherly bond, a deep friendship and she supposes it she was right for a while. Perhaps it had been, and she does not know when things changed, only that they did change. And now they\u2019re very obviously in love.\nAnd it\u2019s not that they\u2019re trying to hide it from her, but Ciri can tell they\u2019re careful how they act. Occasionally, they speak in their own kind of language full of hidden meanings, cast loaded glances to each other, seem to agree on something \u2013 like whether to make camp or to tell Ciri to go to bed \u2013 telepathically. They\u2019re not exactly finishing each other\u2019s sentences, but Jaskier can decode Geralt\u2019s monotonous grunts and hums as an agreement or disagreement to his question, even when they sound exactly the same.\nShe watches as Jaskier gives Geralt the deer leg he can\u2019t finish, and in return, Geralt buys him a little polish for his lute in the next town. They are small things. She still hears their whispered conversations through the too-thin walls of the Inn (seriously, they must know she can hear them)\u2013\n\nGeralt, you absolute brute, I only bought that shirt last month, you fucking barbarian. You\u2019ve ruined it!\n\nGeralt\u2019s laughter rolls across the floorboards, uncharacteristically loud and joyful.\n\nSeriously. I hope you\u2019re happy with yourself.\n\n\nGet over here, Jaskier. \n\n\nFuck you. \n\n\nThat was the goal.\n\nShe almost can\u2019t look at them the next morning as they set out on the road. Today, Jaskier\u2019s wearing a green tunic with tan pants. She knows the tan shirt that goes with it, and normally Jaskier is prudent to match his clothing.\nThe thing is, Jaskier can mend his own clothes. He\u2019s done it countless times. Even mended some of Ciri\u2019s or Geralt\u2019s cotton tunics when they get in a pinch. So Ciri wonders exactly what state the shirt had to have been for it to not be resuscitated. And that is where she gets an idea.\nBeing on the road is mostly boring. Jaskier and Geralt tease each other to pass the time. Ciri thinks it\u2019s time she joined in.\n\u2018Jaskier, your pants don\u2019t match your shirt.\u2019 It\u2019s an innocent observation.\nJaskier turns to her. \u2018Hmm?\u2019\nGeralt pretends he\u2019s not listening, but Ciri sees the slight motion of his head towards the conversation.\n\u2018Why aren\u2019t you wearing the shirt that came with the pants?\u2019 she clarifies. \u2018You got them made together, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\nJaskier laughs nervously. \u2018Ah, I think I\u2019m, um, going to try a new style. Besides, that shirt got\u2026 um, caught on a nail. Ripped terribly.\u2019\n\u2018Really?\u2019 Ciri hums. \u2018And you couldn\u2019t fix it? You fixed a hole in my coat recently, don\u2019t you remember.\u2019\n\u2018Well, no,\u2019 Jaskier laughs nervously. \u2018Geralt, you were there. Tell her how it got ruined. You know, by the nail.\u2019\nGeralt looks like he\u2019s biting back a grin. \u2018Jaskier\u2019s shirt got caught on a nail. It ripped.\u2019\nShe eyes them both suspiciously. \u2018So that\u2019s what all that commotion was last night then.\u2019\n\u2018C-commotion?\u2019 Jaskier clears his throat.\n\u2018Yes, when you tore your shirt, I heard you yell so loudly.\u2019\nGeralt snorts.\n\u2018Yes well,\u2019 Jaskier mutters. His face, against the emerald silks of his shirt, is bright red. \u2018I was quite upset. Clothes like that cost a lot of coin. The nail should have never been there in the first place.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps the nail should have been hammered further into the wall,\u2019 suggest Geralt.\nJaskier chokes on something. Air, maybe. \u2018Perhaps the nail should learn not to get caught on things so that those things rip.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps the shirt should be more careful around nails,\u2019 Geralt replies. \u2018Perhaps the shirt could have taken itself off, rather than letting the nail rip it.\u2019\n\u2018The shirt will not make that mistake again,\u2019 Jaskier squawks.\n\u2018The shirt should have expected a nail after it arrived at the Inn,\u2019 Geralt says. \u2018Inns have nails. They\u2019re made of wood.\u2019\n\u2018Well, this particular nail won\u2019t be tearing any more shirts any time soon,\u2019 Jaskier huffs and stalks forward. Geralt sighs and looks to Ciri.\n\u2018You started that.\u2019\n\u2018I just commented on his choice of clothes,\u2019 Ciri shrugs.\nGeralt gives her a stern look and finally, Ciri thinks she\u2019s starting to figure out his looks. This one says you know exactly what you did.\n\u00a0\nxiii\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t need to listen through the wall to hear Geralt and Jaskier bicker because they\u2019re right here, standing over her\n\nDid you secure another few days here? \n\n\nYes. Two more nights. \n\n\nWhat if she\u2019s not well after that? \n\nA hand on her forehead.\n\nGeralt, she\u2019s hot again. \n\n\nFuck. \n\nA while later-\n\u2018Ciri?\u2019\nIt\u2019s Geralt by her bedside.\nShe groans weakly.\n\u2018Drink the tea,\u2019 he insists and then something luke-warm is at her lips and she drinks as much of it as she can. Her body is cold, slick with sweat. \u2018How do you feel?\u2019\n\u2018Awful,\u2019 she grits out.\n\u2018The fever\u2019s broken,\u2019 he says. \u2018Take another sip.\u2019\nShe finishes the small cup. It tastes awful, like weeds and dirt and a mouthful of horsehair.\nHer hand escapes from between the blankets to find Geralt\u2019s hand, but instead, she feels his stubble, the scar of his cheek.\n\u2018Is that the same thing you gave Jaskier that time?\u2019 she mutters.\nHe chuckles gently. Touches her hand. \u2018Similar.\u2019\n\u2018Where is he?\u2019\n\u2018Downstairs. Performing,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018He\u2019ll be back in a little while.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 she groans. \u2018I know I\u2019m keeping you here.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re not a burden, Ciri,\u2019 he insists. \u2018We do not journey onward until you\u2019re fit to do so.\u2019\nShe opens her eyes, but it takes so much effort, and Geralt is all bleary anyway, so she closes them again.\n\u2018Am I close to death?\u2019 she asks gently. \u2018Be honest.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll be fine, Ciri,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s very dramatic. Jaskier is a bad influence on you.\u2019\nShe laughs, coughs a little and eases her hand down. Geralt covers it with his own.\n\u2018I was thinking,\u2019 he continues. \u2018When you\u2019re better, we travel north. Winter is coming and we should go back to Kaer Morhen, it\u2019s only a week to the base of the mountains and two days after that.\u2019\nShe smiles weakly. \u2018You grew up there?\u2019\nCiri feels his thumb ghost over her knuckles. \u2018Didn\u2019t have much of a childhood, but it\u2019s the only place that feels like home.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d like to go,\u2019 she says. \u2018When I\u2019m better.\u2019\nGeralt squeezes her fingers. \u2018When you\u2019re better.\u2019\nxiv\nCiri listens as Geralt and Jaskier talk lowly by the fire. There\u2019s a map of the continent drawn between their legs, and Geralt\u2019s finger is hovering between Belhaven and Toussaint.\n\nI\u2019ll meet you in Visima; do not wait longer than a week\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not there-\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be there.\n\n\nBut otherwise-\n\n\nThen head north to Kaer Morhen. I wrote ahead to expect us. \n\n\nUs? \n\nThe word lingers between them. Ciri looks up from her sketchbook, where she\u2019s trying to capture the slope of their bodies and the fondness of their gaze on paper.\nThe annual bardic tournament is less than a month away, this year held in Beauclair and Jaskier has a title to defend. It would besmirch his name not to attend but Geralt has rather pressing business for a man named Vesemir on Skellige, so when they arrive in Brugge, they all agree to part ways. \u00a0\n\u2018Need to get some supplies,\u2019 he tells the two of them as they eat a late lunch in the Inn. \u2018Be back later. Stay out of trouble.\u2019\nJaskier decides a little practice won\u2019t do him any harm and sets up to play in the Inn. Ciri sits and listens, but eventually pulls out her notebook to sketch the way Jaskier leans over his instrument, the way he cradles it in his hands. She\u2019s supposed to be practising her Nilfgaardian because Jaskier speaks it fluently and it\u2019ll most likely get her out of trouble at one time or another, but there\u2019s a bitterness of learning the language of the conquerors, of those who slaughtered her kin, so her sentences trail off and become sketches of Roach, doe-eyed with long eyelashes.\nGeralt slides into the seat beside her, unnoticed, and takes a glimpse at the notebook.\n\u2018That\u2019s good,\u2019 he says and glances up to Jaskier. Ciri shuts her notebook quickly, startled at the sudden intrusion.\nGeralt tuts at her obvious surprise.\n\u2018I know, I need to stay alert,\u2019 she says at his dissatisfaction. \u2018But how do I know you\u2019re not a doppler in disguise.\u2019\nGeralt rolls his eyes. \u2018How could I prove such a thing?\u2019\n\u2018Exactly what a doppler would say,\u2019 she replies matter-of-factly. \u2018Gwent?\u2019\nGeralt shrugs and takes out his deck of cards.\n\u2018Ah-ha!\u2019 Ciri cries. \u2018A doppler wouldn\u2019t have your deck of cards, would they? Unless they took your clothes and you\u2019re lying naked somewhere.\u2019\n\u2018A charming thought,\u2019 Jaskier says as he crosses the floor and Ciri doesn\u2019t miss the way Geralt\u2019s cheeks go just a little pink. A doppler wouldn\u2019t blush, she thinks. Sure, they\u2019d have the memories to recognise Jaskier, but surely not the feelings to blush.\nThe other man nudges Ciri over. \u2018I ordered dinner. Get everything you need?\u2019\n\u2018Almost,\u2019 Geralt replies as he draws ten cards from his deck. Ciri does the same. She\u2019s not got as complex a deck as Geralt\u2019s, but she\u2019s still managed to beat him a few times when he has a bad hand. Jaskier watches as he waits for the food, slightly bored. Geralt wins the first round, Ciri the second, and then the game is promptly forgotten as dinner is set in front of them. It\u2019s nice, she thinks, just to spend time playing games for once. Geralt is in good spirits when Jaskier goes to play again, and suddenly the night is late and Ciri\u2019s eyes feel heavy at the table.\n\u2018Ciri,\u2019 Geralt nudges her gently. Had she dozed off? \u2018Come. Off to bed.\u2019\nShe lets him take her by the elbow and heads up the stairs, his heavy gate on the stairs behind her.\nShe lingers by the doorway. Downstairs, Jaskier is still playing.\n\u2018Can I go with him?\u2019 she asks as they arrive at their rooms. Geralt, looking for the key in his pocket, raises an eyebrow. \u2018For protection.\u2019\nThe muscles twitch in his jawline. \u2018Jaskier will be fine.\u2019\n\u2018But-,\u2019\n\u2018He knows how to look after himself,\u2019 Geralt assures. \u2018He\u2019ll be fine, Ciri. It\u2019s only for six weeks.\u2019\nSix weeks.\n\u2018But I could protect him, you know I\u2019m stronger than him,\u2019 she says. \u2018You know how easy he gets into trouble!\u2019\nGeralt pauses at the door, looking like he\u2019s biting back a grin. \u2018I know you are,\u2019 he replies. \u2018But it\u2019s not a good idea to get separated. Jaskier will find his way back. Unsurprisingly, danger seems to find him when our paths cross. Otherwise, he is sensible.\u2019\nThis does little to calm her worries, but then Geralt gets his door open and says, \u2018Goodnight, Ciri,\u2019 and slips in. She sighs, feeling weary herself, and unlocks her own room. It\u2019s small but the bed is plush and welcoming. A while later, in a drowsy haze, she hears the door beside her room open.\n\nOh good, you\u2019re still awake. I looked up and you were gone and I didn\u2019t realise it was so late. Is Ciri in bed?\n\n\nYes. You\u2019re being loud. Get in bed. \n\n\nJust let me wash my face.\n\n\nI have something for you.\n\n\nOh, really? A gift?\n\n\nHm.\n\nJaskier\u2019s laugh is brilliant.\n\nReally? What is it? \n\nA pause.\n\nOh, Geralt. \n\n\nPut it on. I had it charmed; it\u2019ll provide a little protection. I\u2019ll be able to find you if you lose your way.\n\n\nHow creepily romantic of you, Geralt. I love it, and I love you.\n\n\nGlad you like it. \n\n\nIt makes me feel like I\u2019m yours. Would you wear something of mine too? \n\n\nLike what? \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nxv\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe entire conversation might have been a fever dream had it not been that the following morning, Jaskier comes down to breakfast wearing a thin silver chain with a small pendant resting on his chest. Ciri thinks she sees the etching of a wolf, but she can\u2019t be sure as it disappears beneath his collar. Geralt steps in from the stable not to long after and they eat, pay and leave, riding until midday until they arrive at a fork in the road.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Jaskier swallows nervously. \u2018Take care then.\u2019\nCiri hugs him tightly. \u2018Good luck. I\u2019m going to miss you.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be back before you know it,\u2019 he smiles. \u2018I\u2019ll be waiting for you with the prize money in Visima, and we\u2019ll have a wonderful feast to celebrate.\u2019 He pushes her hair behind her ears, cups her cheeks. \u2018Look after Geralt for me, okay? You\u2019re in charge.\u2019\nGeralt approaches with Jaskier\u2019s things in his arms. Ciri turns to her white mare, scratching her nose in a fond goodbye.\n\u2018Stay out of trouble, bard,\u2019 Geralt says as he fixes the pack to the horse\u2019s saddle.\n\u2018I\u2019ll do my best,\u2019 he assures.\nThey hug briefly, more like a handshake than a hug, and Ciri\u2019s about to say something because Jaskier certainly cannot leave without even kissing Geralt goodbye, that certainly won\u2019t do, and she\u2019s done playing these games where they all think she doesn\u2019t know. But then Jaskier\u2019s hand dives into the pocket of his jacket and he hands Geralt something and mutters, \u2018As you said last night.\u2019\nGeralt examines the small lute pick between his fingers. It\u2019s threaded by a small piece of twine. Carefully, Geralt takes off his sword and wraps the pick around the sheath. A wordless conversation takes place between them. Jaskier smiles.\n\u2018See you soon, I\u2019m off to sing your praises,\u2019 he says and then he urges the mare to the left of the fork. Ciri and Geralt head to the right.\n\u00a0\nThe four weeks in Skellige are brutal. The weather is poor and the people poorer. Geralt curses Vesemir\u2019s name when they meet the Priestesses of Freya and they ask him to take care of a rather pressing Siren problem.\n\u2018God damn Sirens,\u2019 Geralt mutters as he drops the head at the base of the temple. \u2018No more games. Give me what is for Vesemir and I\u2019ll get off this godforsaken rock.\u2019\nThe Priestesses examine the Siren trophy with some disgust but eventually hand over a small box.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Ciri asks as they prepare immediately to head back to the mainland. They have barely two weeks to meet Jaskier in Visima, lest he continues north without them, and Ciri knows they\u2019re both keen to reunite with the bard. It\u2019s early afternoon when they board the boat back to the mainland, only arriving in Hamm close to nightfall.\nThey\u2019re halfway through their dinner when someone strums on a lute. Ciri curses as she nurses a sizeable headache.\n\u2018Bed,\u2019 Geralt says as he finishes off his ale hastily. \u2018We\u2019ll make for Visima tomorrow.\u2019\nA musician stands atop a small stage, dressed colourfully. \u2018My first song is not my own,\u2019 he grins. \u2018But the winning composition of Master Bard, Jaskier, from the bardic tournament not two weeks ago. It\u2019s the song everyone\u2019s been singing on the streets of Beauclair since.\u2019\nCiri looks to Geralt, a great grin on her face. \u2018He won!\u2019\n\u00a0\nxvi\n\u00a0\nThey meet Jaskier in the Old Dogge. He\u2019s dressed in a fine cerulean ensemble with a fresh haircut. \u00a0\n\u2018There you are!\u2019 he cries as Geralt and Ciri step into the tavern. Ciri launches into his arms and Jaskier spins her. \u2018Ah, all this week I\u2019ve been drowning myself in ale hoping to make the time speed up to be reunited with you again, but now here you are!\u2019\nJaskier puts Ciri down as Geralt crowds close to him. Ciri watches as Jaskier smiles and raises his hand as if to caress Geralt\u2019s cheek \u2013 are they going to kiss? She hopes so \u2013 and Geralt\u2019s gaze does the thing where it goes all soft. Jaskier\u2019s hand passes Geralt\u2019s ear and keeps going to reach behind Geralt head entirely. He unloops the pick from Geralt\u2019s scabbard.\n\u2018You still have it!\u2019 he announces joyously, hanging the pick between them. \u2018Ah, I thought for sure you\u2019d lose it.\u2019\n\u2018And yours?\u2019\nThen he opens his jerkin slightly to reveal the pendant. \u2018Almost got it stolen by a mugger in a not-so-nice corner of Beauclair, but his hand got all burnt when he touched it. How strange, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\n\u2018Very,\u2019 agrees Geralt.\n\u00a0\nxvii\n\u00a0\nThey all agree to go set out for Kaer Morhen and stay at least the winter, if not into the spring. Ciri looks forward to staying somewhere constant, especially if it means not sleeping on the road. Jaskier says Geralt feels it like a call home, something deep in his guts that niggles at him. As they walk the cold earth along the path to the mountains, Geralt tells them it\u2019s been a few years since he\u2019s been back, a few years since he\u2019s seen another Witcher but if they\u2019re alive, most of them will go back to Kaer Morhen.\nCiri rides the white mare and Geralt and Jaskier trail behind, talking lowly. Talking may be too liberal a word as, as far as she can hear, Geralt is simply grunting responses to Jaskier\u2019s full sentences, whipping Jaskier up into an argument that is almost his own making.\nThe argument peaks as they set up camp a few hundred metres off the road in a forest clearing.\nGeralt is pitching the tent while Jaskier skins the rabbit, talking as the blade carves off the fur. \u2018All I\u2019m saying is we can go down to Rivia, you know, check out your neighbourhood. Then we have a straight run north, Vengerberg in the middle for a respite.\u2019\n\u2018Kaer Morhen is two weeks ride from Vengerberg,\u2019 Geralt corrects. \u2018And we don\u2019t ride south to go north. We\u2019re going through Redania and we\u2019ll rest at Ard Carraigh.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s that far north?\u2019 Jaskier bristles.\n\u2018Two further days from there.\u2019\n\u2018I thought Redania was your home,\u2019 says Ciri.\nAcross the fire, his mouth twitches. \u2018Yes, well, there\u2019s a fondness in visiting every so often, I suppose. Normally I am contented just to look on from afar.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019ll have to pass through to get to Flotsam,\u2019 Geralt says.\n\u2018I know, I know,\u2019 he mutters. \u2018I\u2019ll invest in a cloak with a hood. Geralt, we\u2019ll dye your hair. No one will know it\u2019s us.\u2019\nCiri grins at the idea.\n\u2018I\u2019m not dying my hair. Write ahead.\u2019\n\u2018I most certainly will not!\u2019\nGeralt huffs. \u2018Why pay coin when we can get a room for free?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d rather pitch a tent than spend any time staying with my family,\u2019 he says. \u2018I won\u2019t entertain this for another second!\u2019\nHe stands up like that\u2019s the end of it. Ciri looks to Geralt who just gives her a loaded glance back as Jaskier gathers his things to bathe in the nearby creek.\nIt takes them a week\u2019s hard riding to reach the foothills of the mountains. Flotsam rests between them, a city born on trade of the natural pass. It\u2019s been an otherwise uneventful ride otherwise, but as soon as they pass a marker with the word LETTENHOVE etched into it, Jaskier says, \u2018Surely, we can go around.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019re staying,\u2019 Geralt says.\n\u2018Geralt!\u2019\nThe township is sizable, Ciri thinks, as they ride into the square. As usual, all eyes turn to them. Someone shouts, \u2018Julian Alfred Pankratz, as I live and breathe!\u2019\n\u2018Oh no,\u2019 mutters Jaskier. He shoots a pleading look to Geralt.\n\u2018Seriously Geralt, if we turn around right now, I\u2019ll do anything,\u2019 he pauses. \u2019Anything you want me to.\u2019\nThere\u2019s a twinge of a smile as Geralt rides ahead. \u2018You already do.\u2019\nJaskier squeaks indignantly. \u2018Geralt of Rivia-,\u2019 he starts but then someone is pushing from the crowd, calling Jaskier\u2019s name.\n\u2018Julian! I thought that was you!\u2019 says the man. He\u2019s wearing fine clothing with a small dagger at his hip. His hair is dark like Jaskier\u2019s, but littered with grey. He opens his arms wide as if expecting an embrace. \u2018Cousin!\u2019\n\u2018Erm, yes, hello,\u2019 Julian mutters awkwardly. Ciri hangs back with Geralt, who hasn\u2019t dismounted Roach yet. \u2018Ferrant, how lovely to see you.\u2019\nIf Ferrant picks up on the unenthusiastic tone, he doesn\u2019t respond in-kind. \u2018You should have written ahead!\u2019 he says joyously. \u2018No matter, you know we always have room for you and your,\u2019 finally, Ferrant\u2019s gaze settles on them. \u2018Um, travelling companions.\u2019\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 Jaskier mutters. \u2018This is Geralt of Rivia-,\u2019\n\u2018The Witcher!\u2019 Ferrant says. \u2018You have not been home in so long, cousin, but your songs make their way to us, so it feels like you\u2019re always around.\u2019\nJaskier doesn\u2019t perk up the compliment like he usually would, Ciri notices. \u2018Ah, yes, of course. And this is Fiona, his daughter.\u2019 It\u2019s an easy lie. They look similar enough.\n\u2018My lady!\u2019 Ferrant smiles. \u2018Come. You must be tired and the horses will need watering. We\u2019ll have a feast tonight, catch up on old times.\u2019\nFerrant leads the way, and Ciri doesn\u2019t miss the withering look Jaskier shoots Geralt as they are led to Ferrant\u2019s home. Ciri expects a modest house, but suddenly the township falls away and a large castle looms. A drawbridge lowers.\n\u2018Is\u2026 Jaskier rich?\u2019 she looks at Geralt apprehensively.\n\u2018No,\u2019 Geralt mutters as they\u2019re led through the castle gates. \u2018Definitely not.\u2019\n\u2018Then what-,\u2019 she looks at the castle around them, \u2018Is all this?\u2019\n\u2018I have no idea,\u2019\nA stableboy takes the horses as Ferrant shows them to their quarters: three well-sized rooms.\n\u2018I\u2019ll take my leave,\u2019 says Ferrant graciously. \u2018Bathe, rest. I have a feast to prepare.\u2019\nImmediately, Geralt crowds Jaskier.\n\u2018Explain,\u2019 he demands.\n\u2018Well, you see,\u2019 Jaskier squirms under Geralt\u2019s hard gaze. \u2018My\u2026 father, well, he\u2019s the Viscount. Of Lettenhove. And my cousin, Ferrant, whom you\u2019ve just met is the, um, Royal Instigator. For the King.\u2019\nGeralt massages the bridge of his nose. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019\n\u2018Well, I tried but you wouldn\u2019t see reason. Now you understand why I said we should have just passed through Rivia!\u2019 Jaskier raises his hands in exasperation. \u2018Now we must go through this whole song and dance, and yes, there will probably be dancing. The only thing my cousin loves more than stringing up a criminal is a jig.\u2019\nGeralt sighs, but Ciri\u2019s not sure exactly what\u2019s the problem. They\u2019ve been travelling for three days, now she has a bed, a bath, good food and apparently there will be a party in honour of Jaskier\u2019s return.\n\u2018And don\u2019t even start on my mother while I\u2019m not married yet,\u2019 he mutters. \u2018And prepared to be interrogated within an inch of your life by my sisters-,\u2019\n\u2018Sisters?\u2019 Ciri repeats.\n\u2018Three of them, to be exact,\u2019 Jaskier helpfully supplies. \u2018And these walls are thinner than they seem Geralt, so don\u2019t even think we\u2019re going to-,\u2019\nJaskier cuts himself off. Ciri stifles the urge to giggle.\u00a0\n\u2018Right,\u2019 he huffs and turns on his heel, heading into his bedroom. \u2018The bath water is warming. If we are to stay here, then I\u2019ll at least have to make myself presentable. You should both do the same.\u2019\nThe walls are, indeed, very thin.\n\nIt\u2019s really not to late to leave, Geralt. The ground may be cold to sleep on, but it\u2019s a kind mistress compared to the night we\u2019re about to have!\n\n\nGet in the bath, Jaskier.\n\nSeriously, a muffled noise. She hears clothing drop to the floor. You don\u2019t know my family.\n\nDidn\u2019t even know you had a family. \n\n\nReally? Thought I was abandoned at birth? Oh sorry, touchy subject. \n\nWater sloshes in the tub.\n\nFree bed. Free bath. Free food. \n\n\nNothing in this world is free Geralt. We will suffer my family in payment.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll suffer mine for winter.\n\n\nI thought Witchers had no family.\n\n\nThey don\u2019t. But they are the closest I have, I suppose \u2013 if they are still alive. \n\n\nAnd you have us \u2013 we\u2019re you\u2019re family too.\n\nA pause.\n\nDidn\u2019t think I\u2019d have one. Didn\u2019t need one. \n\nAnd then he says something Ciri can\u2019t hear, though her ear is almost pressed against the wood of the door and Jaskier cries, \u2018Ah Geralt, you\u2019re so romantic!\u2019\nShe peels away from the door with a shake of her head and goes to get changed.\nJaskier\u2019s mother is an older plump woman, who kisses her son on both cheeks when he enters the dining hall. A large pig is roasting on the spit. It smells divine.\n\u2018Mama, this is Geralt, the Witcher, and Fiona, his daughter,\u2019 Jaskier says. Ciri wonders if it makes sense to introduce them like that; she knows that Witcher\u2019s cannot have children. Does it create more suspicion than assurance? She\u2019s unsure.\nGeralt, however, is the picture of civility. He looks uncomfortable stuffed into his silks and cottons, swords not strapped to his body, but Ciri assumes he\u2019s got a dagger stashed somewhere. His light hair is clean and brushed so it falls softly around his shoulders.\n\u2018Pleasure, Viscountess,\u2019 he says warmly. Ciri gives a small curtsey.\nJaskier takes Geralt by the arm. \u2018Very well done,\u2019 he purrs as they sit down.\nThey\u2019re introduced to people throughout the night: Jaskier\u2019s sisters, Agata, Nadia and Halina, the Viscount, and then, of course, Ferrant asks Jaskier to perform and Ciri encourages him to do so.\n\u2018All right,\u2019 Jaskier accepts eventually when he\u2019s eaten and drunk his fill. He returns to get his lute, and that\u2019s when Jaskier\u2019s sisters descend on them.\nNadia is the leader of the three; beautiful with doe-like eyes the same cornflower blue and long dark hair. Her dress is cut revealingly low and Ciri watches as Geralt\u2019s eyes slowly slip south as she leans forward.\n\u2018My brother sings of your conquests,\u2019 she purrs gently. Geralt swallows his mouthful of pork and Ciri takes the moment of distraction to swipe a potato from his plate and his half-drunk stein of ale. \u2018But I must admit, he doesn\u2019t do you justice to your dashing looks.\u2019\n\u2018Told him I\u2019d cut his balls off if he did,\u2019 Geralt mutters and reaches for his ale, only to find it\u2019s not there. \u2018Child.\u2019\nCiri takes her final mouthful before Geralt snatches back his stein, empty. With a huff, he gets up from the table to find another glass. Nadia watches him go, a forlorn look in his eye. Across the room, Jaskier is starting on a fast-paced jig and Ferrant pulls Halina onto the dancefloor.\n\u2018So, child, your father-,\u2019\n\u2018Fathers,\u2019 Ciri corrects. There\u2019s a moment of silence where Ciri thinks that Nadia believes she misheard. \u2018You must specify which, seeing as one is your brother.\u2019\nNadia swallows thickly, her eyes glancing across to Jaskier. \u2018I see.\u2019\nGeralt comes back a bit later, a fresh stein in his hand. He sits beside her. \u2018The stable boy has been staring at you for the last ten minutes.\u2019\n\u2018I know,\u2019 she glowers. \u2018The same look Nadia gave you.\u2019\nGeralt laughs at this. \u2018I thought you would chase her off.\u2019\nCiri looks over to the stable boy. Geralt nudges her gently.\n\u2018Go.\u2019\n\u00a0\nxviii\n\u00a0\nThe mountains loom but provide no shelter from the freezing wind that whips down the passage and assaults their faces. Jaskier trudges through the deep snow, looking back every now and then to ensure Ciri\u2019s keeping up. Ahead, Geralt leads the way with Roach walking beside him. Suddenly, he stops.\n\u2018Melitele\u2019s tits, Geralt, are we there yet?\u2019 Jaskier cries over the howling wind. Ciri crowds by his side, seeking his warmth and feels his arm around her shoulders.\nGeralt looks around, whistles through his thumb and forefinger and waits.\n\u2018Geralt!\u2019 Jaskier calls again. \u2018Do you have any idea where you\u2019re going? Fuck, I can\u2019t feel my toes.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m cold,\u2019 Ciri complains.\nGeralt stalks forward a few more paces, and whistles again. Ciri feels her heart sink. What if there\u2019s no one at Kaer Morhen to receive the letter? What if they don\u2019t want to let them in? She\u2019s about to tell Geralt so when she hears the protesting groan of metal-on-metal.\n\u2018Come on, not far,\u2019 Geralt grits out and they continue through a bend in the road, and suddenly a gate comes into view. The wind dies down. Ciri can see a man wearing black waiting at the open gate.\n\u2018Geralt! You old fuck!\u2019 Laughter. \u2018You\u2019re late!\u2019\n\u2018Nice to see you too, Lambert,\u2019 Geralt grins and they embrace briefly. \u2018This is Jaskier, the bard, and Ciri.\u2019\n\u2018The child surprise,\u2019 Lambert finishes with a sly grin. \u2018Right, come on, there\u2019s time for introductions later. You look like your dick\u2019s about to fall off from frostbite.\u2019\nThey follow Lambert into the compound. Ciri sticks close to Jaskier as Geralt and Lambert tie-up Roach. It\u2019s not as cold in the compound, though snow drifts down gently from the darkened sky. Eventually, Geralt and Lambert lead them through a maze of stone staircases and halls.\n\u2018Eskel?\u2019 Geralt asks.\n\u2018Got here last week,\u2019 Lambert replies. \u2018He\u2019s hunting. Vesemir is locked in his study, as usual. Working on something. Who the fuck knows what?\u2019\nCiri jumps as they walk past a fireplace and Lambert makes it spark to life.\n\u2018What curious creatures you\u2019ve brought back with you,\u2019 Lambert smiles, his bronze gaze wolfish as it dances over Jaskier and Ciri. \u2018These are your rooms. Prepared as requested.\u2019\nCiri takes note of three things as she\u2019s shown to her room and told to get some rest \u2013 that the bed is wonderful and plush, and warm, the beautiful and vast view of the mountains from her window, and the soft words of Geralt and Jaskier next door muffled by the stone wall.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u2018Ciri.\u2019 There\u2019s a hand on her forehead. She wakes, slowly. It\u2019s warm and dark. Jaskier is sitting on her bedside, dressed and well-rested. Slowly, reality comes back to her. \u2018Come on, it\u2019s almost dinner time.\u2019\n\u2018I slept all afternoon?\u2019\n\u2018You weren\u2019t the only one,\u2019 Jaskier chuckles. \u2018Geralt passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow.\u2019\nCiri rolls out of bed, feeling groggy, and washes her face before following Jaskier down to the kitchen. Raucous of laughter and the scent of roasted meat drift up from below. The Witchers are drinking ale while a deer cooks over the flame. Ciri feels her stomach cramp, hungry. There\u2019s a basket of bread rolls, a bowl of boiled potatoes, carrots, and beets. Jaskier touches between her shoulder blades reassuringly.\n\u2018So, Geralt\u2019 Lambert says as they sit down to eat. \u2018You\u2019ve bought quite the group this winter. Not quite the lone wolf the songs make you out to be.\u2019\n\u2018Lambert,\u2019 Vesemir says lowly. \u2018Behave.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, we have esteemed company,\u2019 Eskel continues.\nLambert grins across the table at Geralt, who glowers back. Jaskier is silent beside him, tucking into his soup.\n\u2018Ciri,\u2019 Vesemir pulls her attention. \u2018Perhaps you can join me in the courtyard tomorrow. Geralt tells us you\u2019ve got quite the lungs on you.\u2019\n\u2018Do you know why?\u2019 she asks.\nVesemir smiles kindly. \u2018I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve been in our libraries ever since I heard about you, but I\u2019ve yet to find anything.\u2019\n\u2018Ciri needs training,\u2019 Geralt says. \u2018Combat training. Control training.\u2019\n\u2018Combat?\u2019 Jaskier squeaks quietly.\n\u2018Aye, she can learn what she wants while she\u2019s here,\u2019 Vesemir nods.\nCiri buzzes with excitement. Finally, she\u2019s going to be taught how to punch and kick and, \u2018Will you teach me how to use a sword?\u2019\n\u2018Oh Melitele, help me,\u2019 Jaskier groans.\nGeralt smirks over the lip of his stein.\n\u00a0\nxix\n\u00a0\nLambert gives her a wooden sword and Ciri tests its weight in her palm. A few metres away, near a storage shed, Geralt watches with his arms over his chest.\n\u2018Sword up, Ciri,\u2019 Lambert says.\nCiri takes the position.\nOnly to be immediately knocked to the ground when Lambert\u2019s foot sweeps under hers.\n\u2018That\u2019s not fair,\u2019 she groans.\n\u2018First lesson, girl, fighting isn\u2019t fair,\u2019 he says. \u2018Geralt may be easy on you, but I won\u2019t be.\u2019\nGeralt isn\u2019t easy on her at all, she thinks, but she\u2019s not about to tell Lambert that.\nThey train for most of the afternoon until Ciri is dirty and sweaty and hungry and Geralt says, \u2018That\u2019s enough.\u2019\n\u2018Come on, that was just the warm-up,\u2019 Lambert protests.\nGeralt grabs a stray sword from the armoury fixed to the wall and Ciri scampers away. The grin on Lambert\u2019s face is absolutely feral.\n\u2018Volunteering yourself, then?\u2019 Lambert grins as he paces around Geralt.\nGeralt launches, but Lambert dodges the swing easily. Ciri watches from the corner as Jaskier comes down the stairs to join her.\n\u2018What foolishness are they up to now?\u2019 he mutters but joins her on the log seat to watch.\n\u2018Getting slow, Geralt?\u2019 taunts Lambert. Their swords clash. Geralt lands a punch on Lambert\u2019s jawline. Not hard enough to break, but just enough to make him stumble backwards.\nThey fight for another hour. Jaskier yawns and goes back inside to continue composing, but Ciri stays, watching enraptured as the Witcher\u2019s fight, goad, parry, dodge, time after time. When both of them are tired, they break with a small laugh.\n\u2018Ciri, come. To the baths,\u2019 Lambert says.\nThey travel deep into the keep until they come to a room carved into the side of the mountain with two thermal hot springs. The air is damp and warm. Geralt points her to a bath behind a small screen, as the other men meet in the larger bath.\nCiri strips down, sinks into the murky water and leans back. Over the splashing of the water, she can hear Geralt and Lambert on the other side of the room.\n\nThat kid\u2019s got a lot of fire in her.\n\n\nAs I told you.\n\n\nAnd the bard? \n\n\nWhat about him?\n\n\nOh, don\u2019t play stupid with me, Geralt. You think I didn\u2019t feel that enchanted amulet fucking loaded with spells the moment you walked through the gate. \n\n\nGets himself into trouble. \n\n\nSeems like a lot of effort for an ordinary bard.\n\n\nHe\u2019s not an ordinary bard. Won the Bardic competition twice.\n\nIt\u2019s Lambert\u2019s turn to groan.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that these walls are thin and while Vesemir\u2019s hearing may not be what it used to be, there\u2019s nothing wrong with mine. Just tell your bard to stop flaunting his vocal range in the late hours of the night. \n\n\nLambert.\n\n\nOr gag him. I don\u2019t know what you two are into. \n\nLater, as Jaskier prepares to sing after dinner, Ciri watches Geralt turn as red as the beet soup they had for dinner as Jaskier runs through the scales.\n\u00a0\nxx\n\u00a0\nVesemir is making her read these huge dusty old tomes in the library. Sometimes he falls asleep and Ciri can escape into the courtyard to find Eskel or Lambert, or sometimes Jaskier, and together they\u2019ll practice swordplay, or archery or simply compose a funny limerick. But she\u2019s careful not to run into Geralt. He\u2019s strangely strict about her studies with Vesemir and has told the old man, on more than one occasion, not to fall asleep while tutoring her.\nThe sound of Jaskier\u2019s lute in the courtyard and his gentle, melodic voice, make Vesemir look up from his tome. Ciri follows him to the window, thinking he\u2019s about to close it so they can focus, when, curiously, he peers out into the courtyard. Ciri does the same, craning her body. She can see Jaskier reclining on a pile of hay, lute in hand. Geralt walks past him to pull arrows out of a dummy and as he does so, let\u2019s his fingers ghost over the crown of Jaskier\u2019s head.\nVesemir sighs and leans back from the window.\n\u2018Geralt has always been a perplexing man,\u2019 Vesemir states. \u2018I\u2019m pleased he\u2019s found someone he can be himself around.\u2019\nCiri\u2019s not sure that\u2019s entirely true by the way the two of them have been skirting around her for the last year, but she\u2019s not about to tell Vesemir that.\nThe old man regards her seriously. \u2018And I\u2019m glad they found you,\u2019 he says. \u2018Come, back to work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxxi\n\u00a0\nSpring comes to Kaer Morhen slowly. Ciri doesn\u2019t want to leave, and Geralt doesn\u2019t suggest it until the snow from the mountains melt. Eskel leaves the day before, riding towards Vengerberg.\n\u2018Goodbye, little wolf cub,\u2019 Eskel smiles as he saddles up his horse. \u2018Watch over Geralt for us. See you next year, unless our Paths cross beforehand.\u2019\nShe\u2019s sad to watch Eskel go; they\u2019d spend hours in the studies practising signs and magic, trying to harness the strength of Ciri\u2019s power. And while they definitely haven\u2019t mastered it, she understands her limits better. Under Lambert, her swordplay has increased dramatically, but not to the point that Geralt or Lambert will let her wield a real sword. Maybe next year.\nThey stop in Ard Carraigh and Jaskier sings for coin and a room. The concert goes well. It\u2019s spring and more people are out, defrosted from the chill of winter, and music flows easily into the early morning, as does the ale. Ciri goes to bed, leaving Geralt and Jaskier downstairs. It\u2019s only half of an hour later when he descends into the revelry once again to get a glass of water from the rainwater tank outside when she sees two figures pressed against each other in the stairwell. It\u2019s not an unusual sight, except that it\u2019s clearly Jaskier and Geralt tied up in each other. Geralt\u2019s mouth is on Jaskier\u2019s neck, his hands in his doublet.\nCiri stands at the top of the stairs. Finally. \nGeralt is obviously drunk as he rumbles into Jaskier\u2019s skin, pulling at his doublet. A button pops. Jaskier laughs gently, eyes sliding up towards their room.\n\u2018Geralt, come on, not a few more steps,\u2019 he slurs. \u2018Oh shit.\u2019\nJaskier nudges Geralt off him. \u2018Geralt. Geralt. Your child of surprise is watching us!\u2019\nGeralt pauses his kisses, glances up to Ciri and laughs gently before pulling Jaskier\u2019s face back towards him.\n\u2018She knows.\u2019\n\u2018What?\u2019 Jaskier splutters, reeling back as Geralt tries to kiss him again. \u2018What do you mean she knows? How long have you known that she knows? Why didn\u2019t I know that you know that she knows?\u2019\nGeralt frowns, struggling to keep up. Ciri huffs, descending the stairs and pushing past them.\n\u2018Of course, I know!\u2019 she says. Neither Jaskier or Geralt have made an effort to untangle from each other. \u2018Now that it\u2019s out in the open, in the most respectful way possible \u2013 get a room and keep it down.\u2019\nGeralt laughs as Ciri trudges down to the Inn to get a glass of water.\n\u2018Geralt!\u2019 she hears Jaskier protest, but then the door to their room closes.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\n\u2018So,\u2019 Jaskier says that morning at breakfast. \u2018You know.\u2019\nGeralt rolls his eyes at the theatrics. \u2018Julian.\u2019\nCiri swallows a piece of bread. \u2018I think most people know.\u2019\n\u2018Most people?\u2019 Jaskier repeats nervously and glances at Geralt.\n\u2018Yennefer knows,\u2019 Ciri says. \u2018Lambert definitely knows, I heard him tease Geralt at Kaer Morhen. Eskel. Vesemir.And definitely your sister Nadia knows because I told her off for coming onto Geralt while you were singing. Oh and that Innkeeper at Brugge that one time definitely knew. I feel like I\u2019m the last to know.\u2019\nJaskier sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \u2018To be honest, it\u2019s not like it was a secret, it just took us a while to get here, I suppose it was always difficult to describe.\u2019\n\u2018You had enough on your plate, Ciri,\u2019 Geralt helps. \u2018Than to consider our problems.\u2019\n\u2018But it\u2019s not a problem,\u2019 Ciri emphasises. \u2018It\u2019s nice that my dads are in love.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, well, at least-,\u2019 Jaskier pauses, chokes a little. \u2018Dads?\u2019\n\u2018Love?\u2019 repeats Geralt, only to receive an elbow in the ribs from Jaskier. He catches it with a chuckle and shoves the other man off.\n\u2018Come on,\u2019 he stands and grabs their saddlebags. \u2018We need to get going, the sun is at half-morning already.\u2019\nJaskier gives Geralt a withering look that isn\u2019t really that withering. \u2018Where to now?\u2019"
