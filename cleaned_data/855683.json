    "text": "Besides mealtimes and full moons and Christmas (he\u2019s only experienced one, but he knows he likes it,) Stiles\u2019 favorite time is the mornings. Mornings when there\u2019s nothing to do but sleep and cuddle, in particular. \nStiles cuddles with Derek, who is his favorite person, no besides about it.\n\u201cStop squirming,\u201d Derek mutters, eyes still closed, face still pushed into the pillow with all of the small dots on the fabric that Stiles picked out. \n\u201cI\u2019m not squirming, I\u2019m stretching.\u201d Stiles\u2019 human body gets so much stiffer than his fox body. He thinks it might have something to do with size, but one way or the other, it feels really good to push his toes down to the bottom of the bed and twist his back one way and another like he\u2019s a giant rubber band. \nDerek\u2019s arm, pinned underneath Stiles\u2019 lower back, suddenly levers upwards, hooking Stiles in and pulling him over to lie on top of his chest. Derek\u2019s other arm comes up to join its fellow in pinning Stiles down, and then Stiles can\u2019t move, but man, is he ever comfortable.\nWell, okay, maybe his head is at sort of a weird angle, but he doesn\u2019t really mind because it\u2019s also on top of Derek\u2019s muscles. Stiles has been mostly sort of human for a while now, and he knows for a fact that Derek\u2019s muscles are some of the best out there. The same goes for his face. And everything else. \nStiles kisses the spot over Derek\u2019s heart. He knows from his research that emotions are actually from a combination of different structures in the brain, plus a few hormones here and there that combine into a feelings cocktail, and the heart has very little to do with feeling love at all; but the heart is symbolically linked to love, and easier to kiss than Derek\u2019s hypothalamus, so the heart it is.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep,\u201d Derek grumbles, but his hand shifts up to cup the back of Stiles\u2019 head anyway. \n\u201cSo was I,\u201d Stiles widens his eyes innocently, \u201cbut then you were all distractingly attractive.\u201d\nDerek sighs heavily, but he strokes searching fingers down Stiles\u2019 spine anyway. Stiles will never understand this human habit of acting one way when you feel another. \n\u201cDo you want to have sex?\u201d Stiles asks. \nDerek rolls his eyes, but he pulls Stiles\u2019 face up for a long, searching kiss anyway.\nSex with Derek is the best. Stiles may be biased, because Derek is the only person he\u2019s ever had sex with (his time being fully fox is too blurry for him to tell) but he\u2019s pretty sure that nobody in the whole world could make him feel the way he does with Derek. When they\u2019re in bed, (or the living room couch, or back porch, or forest floor,) it\u2019s like the whole world narrows down to nothing but the comforting weight of their bodies pressed against each other, and Derek\u2019s hands sliding over Stiles\u2019 skin, and the heavy, thumping rhythm they make together. \nIt\u2019s funny. Stiles has been learning about this new world for months now, and he knows that Derek fulfills a type. Stubble, tragic past, a house deep in the woods, and a leather jacket from time to time are all factors that coalesce into a sort of bad boy image. (It doesn\u2019t make sense to Stiles that much, because why would where Derek lives or what he looks like or what he wears have anything to do with his personality, but that\u2019s one of those human things Stiles might never get.) The point is, humans that look at Derek would never believe that he has a secret smile he only ever shows when he and Stiles have the covers pulled up over their heads, or that he asks for reassurance that Stiles is okay at least three times before they do anything, even if Stiles is the one topping (that also doesn\u2019t make sense, because sometimes Stiles is \u201ctopping\u201d but he isn\u2019t actually on top of Derek?) or that he milks the afterglow as though it\u2019s just as good as the sex itself, twisting his limbs through Stiles\u2019 until they\u2019re one great big pretzel of bodies. \nBut Stiles isn\u2019t going to tell anybody. The time he has with Derek is for nobody else. \nDerek, between Stiles\u2019 legs, moves his hand just so-\nStiles shudders and gasps. Derek\u2019s fingers still. \n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cFine, great,\u201d Stiles bats at the top of Derek\u2019s head, \u201ckeep going, please, pleasepleaseplease.\u201d\n\u201cMmm...\u201d\n\u201cAh! Oh, uh-huh, yes, woah-\u201d\nAll of those temple-bound monks would have reached nirvana far earlier if they had this, the perfect meeting of bodies, fitting together like merging galaxies, like divine movement.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nDerek blinks. \u201cNothing, I just... felt like calling your name.\u201d\n\u201cOohh. Okay, carry on then. I\u2019m good with- oh, with that, yes, very good with that. Here, let me just-\u201d\n\u201cHoly...\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What? Holy what?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, just keep going.\u201d \n\u201cWith this?\u201d\nDerek gasps sharply. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Stiles.\u201d\nDerek moves and clenches, grips first here, then there, and Stiles is caught up in tectonic movements, powerless to escape, and unwilling to anyway.\n\u201cDerek! Ah- ah- I love y- oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek rumbles contentedly, \u201clove you too.\u201d\nStiles smiles down at Derek, splayed across the bedspread, covered in sweat and... other things. Stiles is getting very good at sex, and Derek, judging from the way he can\u2019t form words yet, thinks so too. Lightly kissing the edge of Derek\u2019s open, panting mouth, Stiles thinks he could stay here and never need anything else. Derek is basically his world, it would be nice to just be locked away with him and never have to deal with anything else. \nThere\u2019s a knock on the front door. \nDerek groans. \u201cIsaac.\u201d\nWerewolf hearing being what it is, Isaac replies from the front stoop, \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in five minutes. Hold on.\u201d\n\u201cOh, gross,\u201d Isaac moans from the front door. \nThe nose of a werewolf is both a gift and a curse, Stiles muses as they hurriedly shuffle into the shower. \nAfter a swift and vigorous session with the loofah (this fluffy clustering of porous almost-fabric used to clean one\u2019s body,) and a hurried redressing that involves a lot of sneaky wearing of each other\u2019s clothing (for some reason Stiles isn\u2019t supposed to mention this. It makes Derek uncomfortable,) Derek opens the door, and Stiles plasters an innocent smile on his face. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the day,\u201d Isaac grumbles, like that\u2019s supposed to mean anything. \nIsaac is there to figure out paperwork for emancipation, so he doesn\u2019t need to stay with a foster family. He and Derek huddle over the makeshift coffee table and talk paperwork. Derek doesn\u2019t mention it much, but he has some experience with the foster system, even if it\u2019s only in how to avoid it. \nStiles likes to think about that part of Derek\u2019s life about as much as Derek likes to talk about it. His memories of the place they used to live in are shaky, half in fog, but he knows that the old house was meant to hold far more people than their new, thimble-sized cottage does. He also knows that the old house couldn\u2019t have always been the creaking old contortion of wooden beams and dust it was, that once it must have smelled like cooking food and laughter and maybe a few slammed doors. He knows the flames that separated those two places left marks on Derek that werewolf healing couldn\u2019t fade away. \nInterrupting talk of dealing with social workers for a moment, Stiles swoops in behind Derek to hug him around the shoulders. Hard.\n\u201cHi Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cHello. Sorry. The urge struck me.\u201d Stiles presses a kiss to the side of Derek\u2019s neck, (just because he knows it riles Derek up,) then skips off to the other side of the room, where he busies himself with a library book from the stack near the door. He\u2019s read it before, that\u2019s why they\u2019re returning it, but Stiles can\u2019t help but think the author is trying to hide something behind their words, and he wants to find out what it is.\nHis reading is interrupted by Derek kissing his forehead, one hand on Stiles\u2019 shoulder, the other on the doorknob.\n\u201cIsaac and I have to run down to the Sheriff\u2019s office. Paperwork. Be back soon.\u201d\nThen he\u2019s gone, and Stiles is draped over a secondhand armchair sideways, trying and failing to return to his book. He keeps getting distracted by looking out the window, towards the empty road outside, and if he manages to read a sentence or two, he keeps glancing up to share a thought with Derek, who isn\u2019t there.\nBefore Stiles was quite human, Derek had tried to lock Stiles up in his car, while he stayed outside. Stiles knows now that it had been because Derek was worried he would freeze under the vastly open night sky, but then and now, he just feels abandoned. \nFoxes are solitary creatures. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what happened to that. \nTheir house is tiny, but it seems to echo, cavernous and empty, like a stretch of woods after a plague of loggers. Stiles wanders from room to room to room (there are only three) then outside, then back inside, then he opens the book again, but the words are stale, so then he fishes a bag of chips out of one of the cabinets, then he eats it, and then he does nothing in particular. \nWhat do humans do all day?\nFinally, the front door reopens, and Stiles pounces. They have sex right in the half open doorway, Derek breathlessly thanking his god that they have no neighbors, and that he dropped Isaac off at the McCall\u2019s before showing up.\nXXXXX\nSummer is drawing closer, and Stiles is excited. He\u2019s going to make Derek take him to the beach, (even though Derek complains about the long drive out to the coast,) and he\u2019s going to try getting a tan, and he\u2019s going to watch the forest change through new eyes. No longer will he just blindly notice the plentiful food, he\u2019ll be able to look up and down and around, soak in the fruitful weight of the trees, the hopeful stumbles of cubs and kits, the endless greening of the air, and understand it like he didn\u2019t before. \nWait. Stiles stops in his tracks. \nDerek snuffles at Stiles\u2019 ear. What?\nNudging back at Derek\u2019s massive, black furred head with his own small, red one, Stiles explains, this is my second summer. Or, almost summer. \n\nAlright?\n\n\nSoooo, this past spring was my first spring, and the same goes for winter and fall, which means that I was born in the summer, which means that I get cake, since I\u2019m a year old. \n\nWhuffing in amusement, Derek bats at Stiles\u2019 flank. Stiles stumbles slightly, and startles a ladybug out from underneath a leaf. He watches her flit upwards in amazement. What tiny wings under such a vibrant shell. \n\nSo you want cake?\n\n\nAnd also, you know, I wanna celebrate living for a year or whatever. It\u2019s a pretty fatal world we live in. \n\nDerek pauses, before adding seriously, yes it is, and licking the side of Stiles\u2019 face. \nStiles doesn\u2019t want Derek thinking about death, he doesn\u2019t want Derek ever thinking about death, so he ducks down into a play stance, then leaps up to gnaw at Derek\u2019s ear, saying, does this mean I\u2019m mature now?\nTheir play chase lasts only as long as it takes for Derek to outrun Stiles (which is to say, not very long,) but it gets Stiles\u2019 blood pumping, and when they both switch back into human form, and Derek\u2019s chest is pressed up against Stiles\u2019 as they lie on the forest floor, Stiles can tell that Derek\u2019s heart is beating just as fast. \nHe lies back, watches the clouds, and waits for their heartbeats to sync up. Derek nuzzles at Stiles\u2019 neck, scenting it. \n\u201cWhat do I smell like today?\u201d It\u2019s an ongoing question. Stiles apparently smells different every day. \n\u201cSweat.\u201d\n\u201cEven I can tell that. Come on, what do I pay you for?\u201d\nStiles can almost feel Derek rolling his eyes. \n\u201cPine. Detergent\u2013\u2013 the laundromat stuff. Fake cheese. Cumin? What were you doing with cumin?\u201d\n\u201cExploring.\u201d\nDerek shakes his head against Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cCumin. Isaac, a bit. And me.\u201d Derek lips at the tendon that leads up Stiles\u2019 neck. (He should look up if there\u2019s a word for that.)\nTurnabout is fair play, so Stiles pulls Derek\u2019s hand to his mouth and starts biting at his fingers. It\u2019s partially because it always feels nice to gnaw on something, (it keeps his teeth in shape,) and partially (mostly) because he knows Derek takes it sexually. \nDerek bites a mark into Stiles\u2019 neck. Stiles sucks Derek\u2019s entire index finger into his mouth. Derek\u2019s hips buck. Stiles\u2019 buck right back. \n(Mating season for foxes ended in March. Mating season for humans never ends.)\nXXXXX\nTime continues to pass, and Stiles notices it. Humans mark their time in such steady increments: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries. \nThere are words for even more time than that, but millennia and eons have nothing to do with him and Derek. \nWith the movement of time, Stiles\u2019 hair grows, and when his hair reaches his chin, Derek volunteers to cut it back down. Stiles isn\u2019t sure what the point is, it\u2019s just going to keep growing, but it seems important to Derek, so Stiles lets Derek sit him on a stool in the bathroom, cradle his head between two warm palms, and pull a razor across his skull, sweeping a hand over it after each swipe of the razor. When Stiles\u2019 first haircut is over, he is a warm blob of boneless muscle, still buzzing from the razor and Derek\u2019s touch.\nStiles lets himself fall backwards on the stool, and unsurprisingly, Derek catches him, acting as a chair back. Derek\u2019s blueish greenish eyes blink down at him. \n\u201cI can see your eyes,\u201d Derek comments, brushing a finger over Stiles\u2019 bared forehead. \nNuzzling his head backwards against Derek\u2019s stomach, (with his new buzzcut, the movement almost tickles,) Stiles grins. \u201cRight back atcha.\u201d\nDerek cards his fingers through the stubble on Stiles\u2019 hair, brushing out a few stray hairs. They tickle Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cBefore I forget: I\u2019m going back down to the station today.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek answers mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s just to fix something with Isaac\u2019s paperwork. Isaac gets nervous in the station, so I\u2019m dealing with it.\u201d\nStiles hadn\u2019t known that about Isaac. He knows very little about him, actually. Isaac just illicits a general sense of approval, like how he feels about chocolate and people who don\u2019t lie.\nOnce Stiles and Derek reach the station, Stiles is baffled as to why Isaac doesn\u2019t like it. Or, well, it\u2019s probably something to do with the prosecution of his dad, but Stiles personally finds the station comforting. The officers meander back and forth to each other, chatting like friends and the whole place smells like coffee. The emblem of the sheriff\u2019s department hangs on the back wall. It reads \u201cServe and Protect,\u201d and Stiles thinks that isn\u2019t a bad motto at all. \nRealizing his side is suddenly cold, Stiles turns to see Derek following a bearded deputy into one of the offices. Derek gives him a small wave, then the office door closes behind him. Stiles should have been keeping better track of Derek. There aren\u2019t even windows looking into the office.\nNearby, one of the deputies sets down a stack of papers loudly and Stiles jumps at the abrupt noise. She glances up at him and he smiles wanly, tensing in preparation for a slew of questions about who he is and why he\u2019s there and why he doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate and how about you follow me to this jail cell here, sir? \nThe deputy scrubs a hand over her nose and opens a file. Maybe she hasn\u2019t noticed him yet. \nAs unobtrusively as possible, Stiles walks over to the waiting area (a glorified word for two chairs and a potted plant in a corner.) The open plan of the station feels much bigger than it did when he walked in, and it seems like he\u2019s taking longer to reach his seat than it should. \nStiles sits and tries to look at something that isn\u2019t one of the strangers milling around in the bullpen of desks, then he taps his feet against the floor, then he drums the tips of his fingers on his knee, then he tries to find a comfortable position in the linoleum chair. \nHe has his knees almost to his ears when he sees a pair of shoes stop in front of him. He looks up to see a face attached to the body attached to the shoes. It\u2019s a tannish, reddish, faintly amused face, with wrinkles that probably come from making that faintly amused expression a lot. \n\u201cYou all right there kid?\u201d the face asks. \nStiles tries to look innocent. \u201cYes. These chairs are uncomfortable.\u201d\nThe face nods knowingly. \u201cMurder on the back. I\u2019ve been trying to get them replaced for years, but there never seems to be room in the budget for new chairs. Are you waiting for someone?\u201d\n\u201cWh- um, yeah. Derek.\u201d Stiles replies.\nThe face tilts to the side in confusion. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an officer Derek.\u201d\nOf course the officer would be confused. Stiles doesn\u2019t know how to talk to people who aren\u2019t Derek. What is he even doing here?\n\u201cI mean, um, Derek Hale. He\u2019s talking to, uh,\u201d Stiles gestures at his chin, \u201cbeard guy.\u201d\nThe face chuckles. \u201cBeard guy. I\u2019m sure Dave will appreciate that. He\u2019s proud of the damn thing for some reason.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes flick to the office door. Still closed. What in the hell are they doing in there?\nThe officer looks at Stiles again. His eyebrows come together. That probably isn\u2019t good. \n\u201cYou want some coffee, kid?\u201d\nOh. Stiles blinks up at the officer. He doesn\u2019t look like someone about to arrest him for being an impostor. Mostly he looks slightly worried.\n\u201cCome on. The coffee\u2019s bad, but it ain\u2019t poisonous,\u201d the guy says, making his way to a table in the back that bears a coffee machine like an offering to the gods. \nStiles finds himself following, not entirely sure why. The officer moves like someone used to people trailing behind him. He doesn\u2019t look back at Stiles as he walks towards the coffee machine, already confident that Stiles will follow. Which Stiles does. Because coffee. Derek never lets him have coffee.\nThe officer pours a cup of what might be motor oil that\u2019s been mistaken for coffee, and hands it to Stiles in a styrofoam cup. Wrapping both hands around it, Stiles cradles it against his chest. It quiets the butterflies in his stomach somewhat, even if Derek is still hidden away in the office, unreachable. \nTaking a sip of his own coffee, the officer winces. \u201cUrgh. I regret it every time.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do you drink it?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me,\u201d the officer admonishes gently. \u201cYou look like a college kid, you know how important coffee is to a man. Don\u2019t you all inject it straight into your veins or something?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. That\u2019s like, supremely gross. And dangerous.\u201d\nThe officer shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve seen kids do weirder stuff.\u201d\nStiles feels the oddest need to protest that he isn\u2019t a kid, but then the officer might ask how old he is, and Stiles can\u2019t really answer that. Plus he\u2019s pretty sure cops can smell lies. \nThat would actually be pretty cool. Technically, Derek can hear them, but being able to smell them would probably be way more reliable than listening for a shaky heartbeat. Stiles would watch a TV show about a cop that smells lies in a second. \nNodding at the office door, the officer says, \u201cHale is a good guy.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says, because he does.\n\u201cNot many folks would just help a kid like Isaac out like that. I\u2019m glad to see he\u2019s making friends after, well, you know.\u201d The officer clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cAnyway, how do you know Derek?\u201d\nStiles realizes the officer is trying to make small talk. It\u2019s kind of funny how bad at it he is. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, we\u2019re, boyfriends? I guess?\u201d Derek would wince at the word, Stiles knows. He thinks it sounds juvenile, which, well, yeah. But what else can Stiles say? Mate? Humans don\u2019t really throw that word around, Stiles knows this after the incident in the grocery store. \n\u201cOh,\u201d the officer\u2019s eyebrows raise. \u201cHuh. Well, I mean, that\u2019s good. For you. And him. Did not see that coming.\u201d The last sentence is a little under his breath. Humans are so bad at figuring Derek out.\n\u201cLydia Martin says he\u2019s out of my league,\u201d Stiles blurts out, he doesn\u2019t know why. She\u2019d said it more than a month ago, but her words must have just stuck with him, and decided that now would be a good time to dislodge from his brain and fall out of his mouth. \nThe officer snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t believe in leagues, kid. My wife was way out of my league, but we still had a nice ten years of happy marriage. The key,\u201d he lowers his voice conspiratorially, \u201cis to be so awesome that they never notice how much more attractive they are than you.\u201d\nStiles snorts. \n\u201cLaugh all you want, kid. But trust me, that little bit of wisdom got me far.\u201d The officer finishes his coffee and tosses it in the tiny wastebasket at his feet. \u201cWell, my break is over and- look at that timing, seems like Dave is done talking to your boyfriend.\u201d\nStiles hadn\u2019t even noticed the office door open, but sure enough, there\u2019s Derek, a big yellow envelope in his hands, standing in the bullpen and casting his gaze around for Stiles. Stiles gives a little wave, and Derek starts walking over, maneuvering around the cramped maze of desks, chairs and filing cabinets. \nThe officer holds out a hand. Stiles has to look at it for a second before he realizes he\u2019s supposed to shake it. \n\u201cI\u2019m Sheriff Stilinski, by the way,\u201d he says, \u201cand you ever need anything, you call me up, son.\u201d\nStiles nods. \u201cAlright, uh, dad.\u201d That seems like the appropriate way to answer.\nThe sheriff blinks, looking a little nonplussed, but then Derek has a hand on Stiles\u2019 shoulder, and he\u2019s giving the sheriff a wave and a smile as they walk out. \n\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles says as they slide into the car, \u201cwas that John Stilinski?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nStiles looks back at the station, as though he could make out the figure of the friendly sheriff through the wall. \u201cThe one whose name I used to make my name?\u201d\n\u201cThe same. He\u2019s not a bad guy,\u201d Derek replies. Coming from him, that\u2019s high praise.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles agrees, \u201che\u2019s not.\u201d\nXXXXX\nIsaac is officially emancipated at almost the exact time he finishes sophomore year. He gets a tiny apartment on the edge of town that he shares with two roommates; art students at the community college. Derek is weird about it, and when Stiles asks, he says that traditionally, a pack lives all together, but he and Isaac aren\u2019t really close enough for Derek to ask that Isaac move in. \nStiles doesn\u2019t claim to know Isaac any better than Derek, and he\u2019s alright with the tiny, makeshift pack the three of them make, but he can\u2019t help but wonder when they\u2019ll move on from making do with what the universe throws at them, to thriving simply because they can. If for no other reason than because Derek deserves to have something nice. Stiles doesn\u2019t quite know what a \u201cnormal\u201d life would be like, but Derek had one once, he should have one again. If only Stiles knew how to get one. Google doesn\u2019t have an answer for him on this.\nFor now, they go home and eat possibly undercooked spaghetti off of paper plates, then sit on the grass outside to watch the sun go down -with summer slowness- behind the trees. When the crickets are singing with the enthusiasm of an off key opera singer, Stiles rolls over until he\u2019s on top of Derek, and they enjoy the freedom of warm weather to undress as much as they please outside.\nAround midnight, Stiles shifts into his fox form and sprawls across Derek\u2019s lap. He\u2019s warmer this way, and it also feels nice to be back in his natural state. The world gets a lot simpler when he\u2019s a fox. He can enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\n\nRub my tummy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so spoiled.\u201d\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m expecting you to rub my tummy. Now, please. \n\nDerek sighs and obliges. It\u2019s impossible to explain what makes tummy rubs so nice, but Stiles can easily say that he loves Derek, like, thirty-seven times more when tummy rub time comes around. \n\u201cA girl at the grocery store asked me where I got my pet fox the other day,\u201d Derek comments.\n\nI resent that. \n\n\u201cI know you aren\u2019t a pet.\u201d Derek shrugs. \u201cI told her that wild animals aren\u2019t toys, and that she should look around Deaton\u2019s clinic for a nice dog or something.\u201d\n\nIn my experience, the best pets are wolves. \n\nDerek flicks Stiles\u2019 ear lightly. \u201cI resent that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true though! They feed you, give you a roof, offer up sex whenever you want it...\n\nLaughing lightly, Derek leans back on one hand to look up at the stars that sprinkle the sky like salt. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nStiles used to have to coax the words out of Derek with as much care and delicacy as one treats a newborn kit, and even now, Derek is not free with words of endearment, but now and then, they drop from his lips like ripe fruit falling from a branch, and Stiles thinks that at least they\u2019re doing something right.\nXXXXX\nCriminal Minds is a fascinating show. Also, it is eleven o\u2019clock at night, Stiles has been watching it nonstop for five hours, and he\u2019s home alone. It doesn\u2019t even matter where Derek is, just that he isn\u2019t here, and Stiles is almost certain that there is a murderer outside of the house. It\u2019s a suspicion that\u2019s been growing as the night goes on. At first he thought it was just the shifting of the trees outside, or one of the deer that occasionally wanders through their yard, looking for a garden to rampage, but he\u2019s seeing shadows now, coming in through the windows and sneaking across the floor. There\u2019s definitely a person out there, and Stiles isn\u2019t going to delude himself into thinking he or she doesn\u2019t want to cram him into a murder basement for torture and then death.\nStiles pauses the video again and sidles up to the window, peeking through their poor excuse for curtains. The guy\u2019s good at hiding, but Stiles knows he\u2019s lurking out there somewhere, a knife and duct tape at the ready. It\u2019s funny, (in the sense that it isn\u2019t funny at all,) that Stiles doesn\u2019t consider himself afraid of the dark. It\u2019s just the absence of the sun, what harm is there in that? But he sees now, it\u2019s what lurks in the dark that has humans afraid and running for the light switch. It\u2019s the lack of sight, the sense that you could turn around and find something there that wasn\u2019t before. It\u2019s the sense of teetering on uncertainty, never quite sure that what you\u2019re seeing is real. \nNight was so much easier when he was mostly nocturnal.\nThere\u2019s a cracking noise outside and Stiles leaps away from the window. He feels like the guy in the first three minutes of the episode of Criminal Minds he was watching. Everybody knows what happens to the guy in the first three minutes of a police procedural show. \nWell Stiles isn\u2019t going to make the mistakes that guy made. He hightails it for the telephone, an old plastic thing with a tangled, corkscrewing cord connecting the handset to the base. He pauses, a finger hovering over the numbers. Who does he call? Derek doesn\u2019t have a cellphone (we only ever talk to each other, Stiles, and we\u2019re always together. What\u2019s the point?) and 911 doesn\u2019t quite seem right, (Stiles is pretty sure you\u2019re supposed to already be bleeding by the time you call 911,) so what does he do?\nWho else is there? \nStiles doubles back to his computer. There is exactly one person, and it\u2019s actually sort of perfect, because if anybody knows how to deal with a murderer in a backyard, it\u2019s a sheriff. It doesn\u2019t take long to look up Sheriff Stilinski\u2019s number, (google is a useful tool,) then punch the numbers into the telephone.\nAfter entering the number, Stiles looks at the telephone. Nothing happens. He punches the numbers in again. \nHe googles how to dial a telephone. \nOnce he reads the eHow article, he shakes his head at himself, lifts the receiver, then dials in the numbers again, gratified to hear a tinny dial tone reaching his ears this time. \nBoop-bee-boopboop-boop-boop-boop....\nBoooooooop.... boooooooop.... booooooop......\n\u201cThis\u2019s John. Wazzit?\u201d\n\u201cSheriff Stilinski?\u201d\n\u201cYes. S\u2019the middle of the night, n\u2019I\u2019m not on shift. Better be important.\u201d\nStiles falters for a second. But police officers are meant to protect and serve, right? \n\u201cThis is Stiles. There\u2019s a murderer outside of my house.\u201d\nA loud sigh on the other side of the line. \u201cFirst, if there\u2019s a murderer call 911, second, what the hell is a Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cUm, well, I\u2019m a person, mostly, um, I mean, I\u2019m a person, and you said \u2018if you ever need me, you call me up, son,\u2019 so I figured if there\u2019s a murderer outside of my house then I should probably call you up son. Thing is, I\u2019m not like, super one hundred percent sure there\u2019s a murderer, more like seventy percent, so I figure I\u2019ve got to play it safe because I don\u2019t want to be murdered in my bed, but I don\u2019t want to call out, I don\u2019t know, a SWAT team for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s voice says. \u201cI remember you. Okay,\u201d there\u2019s a rustling noise on the other end of the line, like he\u2019s moving, \u201cwhere are you and why do you think there\u2019s a murderer?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m at my house. And I can hear things moving outside.\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh. Sure. What kind of things and where is your house?\u201d\n\u201cRustling things, and, um, I don\u2019t know, the woods?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cYou don\u2019t know your own address?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s Derek\u2019s address,\u201d Stiles flounders around the living room, like maybe he\u2019ll find the address sloshed across a wall in red paint somewhere.\n\u201cOh, the Hale house. I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes. Hang tight, kid.\u201d The line goes dead.\nStiles stares at the phone for a few minutes before figuring out he\u2019s supposed to set it down in its cradle. He\u2019s voluntarily invited a human into their home. He should be more worried about this, but even though the sheriff is practically a stranger, and Stiles doesn\u2019t have Derek\u2019s comforting presence by his side, there\u2019s something about the sheriff; he exudes a reassuring presence. Somebody could bottle it and make a fortune. \nThree knocks sound from the front door, each one efficient and clear in its meaning. Stiles recognizes it from the dozen repeats of \u201cpolice! open up!\u201d he\u2019s heard in the past few hours.\nAfter a quick peek through the spy hole, Stiles lets the sheriff in. He\u2019s wearing jeans, a flannel shirt, and a coffee mug. \n\u201cAlright kid,\u201d he pauses to take a swig of coffee, \u201ctell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nStiles blinks. \u201cThere were a bunch of rustles and shadows from around the house, but I guess I haven\u2019t really heard anything in the last ten minutes.\u201d\nThe sheriff raises an eyebrow. \u201cSure. Alright, I\u2019ll sweep the perimeter, but I don\u2019t think there will be anything.\u201d\n\u201cBecause the murderer would have seen you drive up?\u201d\n\u201cSure, kid.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles calls just before the sheriff goes back into the dark, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have your gun?\u201d\nThe sheriff waves vaguely at Stiles as he steps out onto the lawn. \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d\nStiles watches out the windows as the sheriff\u2019s flashlight beam sweeps over the backyard: the overgrown grass, the trees, the few random leftovers of construction scattered around, the rectangle of concrete that serves as their driveway. He finishes his circuit sooner than Stiles thought he would, and Stiles opens the door for him just as the sheriff turns off his flashlight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Does this mean the sheriff is going now? Stiles doesn\u2019t want that. \nThe sheriff\u2019s eyes flicker over Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cBeacon Hills is a pretty safe area, you really don\u2019t have to worry about murderers wandering around in the woods.\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m new.\u201d\nTilting his head to the side, the sheriff notes, \u201cyes, I guess you are. We don\u2019t get a lot of people coming into Beacon Hills.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice here.\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cIt kind of smells like beets.\u201d\nThe sheriff squints at Stiles for a second for a second before a bark of laughter escapes his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that before.\u201d\n\u201cIt does.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe so.\u201d\nGlancing back at his car, the sheriff says, \u201cwell, unless you also want me to check your closet for monsters, I guess I should get going.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles bursts out.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said wait.\u201d\n\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I. Funny thing. Um, just, maybe you should check on my closet. Or you know, if you want some more coffee, I think we have coffee. No coffee machine though, we do this weird thing with filters because Derek can\u2019t man up and buy a coffee machine. Don\u2019t let that put you off, though, because our coffee is top notch. Top. Notch.\u201d\nThe sheriff looks at Stiles skeptically, then steps inside. \u201cYou\u2019re an odd duck, Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cSo they tell me. They usually don\u2019t say \u201cduck,\u201d though.\u201d\nThe sheriff does check in the closet, glancing around the single square foot of space with coats piled in a lump on the floor before closing the door on it. Stiles fiddles fruitlessly in the kitchen until the sheriff waves a hand, saying \u201cdon\u2019t bother,\u201d and moving to settle on the couch. \nStiles joins him, and they sit in silence for a moment, before the sheriff asks, \u201care you afraid of the dark, Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles answers honestly.\n\u201cBecause in my experience, it\u2019s only people who have been spooked by something that start hearing things outside.\u201d\nStiles glances at his laptop, the screen of which shows a frozen frame of Criminal Minds, mid-shootout. The sheriff follows his gaze, and sighs heavily. \u201cThese stupid shows. You should know better than watching these in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know.\u201d The sheriff makes some sort of illustrative hand gesture that makes no sense. \u201cOr maybe you don\u2019t. Watching cop shows makes everybody jumpy. Didn\u2019t your parents ever warn you about that?\u201d\n\u201cUm, they, uh, died. When I was young,\u201d Stiles replies awkwardly. It\u2019s technically true. Should he be looking more fraught with distress? He barely remembers the fox that birthed him, but a human would probably show some sorrow when talking about their dead parents, right? He tries to look sorrowful.\nApparently his sad face comes off a bit too strong, because the next thing he knows, he\u2019s getting the life hugged out of him by two big reassuring sheriff arms. \n\u201cHey now, hey.\u201d A hand aggressively rubs circles over Stiles\u2019 back. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I- when my- when my wife passed away, I was a mess for a long time. It\u2019s alright to feel a little lost.\u201d\nStiles doesn\u2019t know what to say to that, so he keeps his nose awkwardly squished against the sheriff\u2019s collarbone.\n\u201cI get it, I get it. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in this unfamiliar new world, and sometimes you barely even know how to handle it, but you have to trust me, you\u2019ll find a way. There will always be people to help you.\u201d\nStiles does know what to say to that. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\nXXXXX\nStiles doesn\u2019t know how it happened. He really doesn\u2019t. One minute he\u2019s inviting the sheriff over to check for murderers, the next, he and Derek are invited over for barbecue at the sheriff\u2019s house. After that, it\u2019s out for fishing. After that, it\u2019s bowling because the sheriff\u2019s team is short a member. (The sheriff is terrible at bowling. Stiles thinks he might just do it because he\u2019s lonely in that big house of his.)\nDerek is wary of the sheriff. It has something to do with having been hauled in for questioning once or twice, and also something to do with the way the sheriff pulled Derek aside at their first barbecue, pointed a single, resolute index finger in his face, and declared that if he was trying to take advantage of the confused, sheltered new kid in town, he would have another thing coming. Derek assured the sheriff that he had no intention of doing such a thing, but the sheriff remained suspicious of him for a few weeks after that. Apparently Stiles and Derek look different enough in age that the Sheriff suspected something fishy. \nStiles thinks he loves the sheriff. Except in a very, very different way than he loves Derek. The barest idea of doing... that with the sheriff turns Stiles\u2019 stomach, but he doesn\u2019t mind the friendly arm that will get slung around his shoulder, or the ruffling of his nonexistent hair. When the sheriff stops by before he has to go on his shift, not for any particular reason, just to make sure they\u2019re doing alright, and Stiles feels warm, like he\u2019s swaddled up in blankets; he thinks that\u2019s a certain kind of love. Derek might love the sheriff too, but he\u2019s much worse at admitting such things. At the very least, Stiles can tell that Derek is a little jealous. He also wants fondly exasperated \u201ckiddos\u201d and \u201csons,\u201d but he and the sheriff aren\u2019t quite there yet. Not everybody can have Stiles\u2019 unrivaled magnetism.\nHe and the sheriff talk about different things than he and Derek do:\n\u201cPeoplewatching?\u201d\n\u201cPeoplewatching,\u201d the sheriff confirms.\nStiles takes another bite of curly fries (which goes onto his list of favorite things, definitely,) and turns in his squeaky diner seat to face the street. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s on.\u201d\nThe sheriff points surreptitiously at a couple walking along the other side of the street. \u201cHe\u2019s cheating.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you possibly know that, you\u2019re just being dramatic.\u201d\n\u201cFine, maybe a little,\u201d the sheriff allows, \u201cbut he is definitely less into her than she is into him. It\u2019s all in the body language.\u201d The sheriff takes a sip of coke. \u201cYou have to watch the body language, Stiles, it tells you everything. A person\u2019s chest always points towards what they consider the most important thing around them.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Stiles watches the couple pass the hardware store, and realizes yes, the guy isn\u2019t angled towards the girl at all, while she has her chest pointed at him like a honing beacon. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. For them, I mean.\u201d\nThe sheriff shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re young. Plenty of time to get their hearts broken and explore the world of dating.\u201d\nStiles winces slightly. That sounds stressful. Is there somebody he can thank for Derek?\nAfter he swallows a bite of his hamburger, the sheriff continues, \u201cand that kid. The one hanging around with the pack of skaters who think they\u2019re too cool for school-\u201d\n\u201cSchool\u2019s out, it\u2019s summer.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, kid,\u201d the sheriff explains smoothly. \u201cBut, uh, that kid doesn\u2019t really want to be a part of that group. Keeps checking his phone, leaning against that light post while everybody else is comparing their skateboards.\u201d The sheriff sighs and shakes his head. \u201cBack in the nineties, everybody was saying skateboards were just a fad. Now they\u2019re the bane of police officers everywhere.\u201d \n\u201cHmm,\u201d Stiles answers absentmindedly, watching the kid in the distance shifting away from the crowd he\u2019s surrounded by, trying to create his own little island away from the madness.\n\u201cSon, don\u2019t ever take up skateboarding.\u201d\n\u201cKay dad,\u201d Stiles replies. \nThe sheriff makes an odd sort of noise, and Stiles glances up. \u201cWhat is it? Are you choking?\u201d\nHe shakes his head, \u201cno, no. It\u2019s nothing, kid.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles eyes the meal on the sheriff\u2019s plate. There isn\u2019t a green thing on it. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not healthy.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, first my doctor, now you?\u201d\n\u201cYour doctor says you shouldn\u2019t be eating this?\u201d Stiles exclaims, reaching for the plate. \u201cThen why are you eating it?\u201d\n\u201cIt tastes good, and I\u2019m a man of simple pleasures.\u201d The sheriff blithely slides his plate back towards himself. \n\u201cWho won\u2019t live much longer, at this rate,\u201d Stiles mutters darkly, watching the sheriff imbibe more fat and carbs.\n\u201c\u2018at\u2019s morbid,\u201d the sheriff points out around his food.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles shoots back defiantly. \nXXXXX\nThe full moon comes especially bright and low and fat this month, but the Hale pack still does what it always does. Stiles and Derek spend the day enjoying Derek\u2019s moon-fueled libido, then Isaac pops up around nightfall, either dropped off by his roommate, or showing up on foot because the roommate is either unwilling to drive or his truck has broken down again. They stand around until the moon pokes its head over the horizon, washing cool white light over the gray grass, then Derek shifts to his massive wolf form, easy as water flowing downwards, Stiles follows suit, then Isaac shifts as well. \nStiles and Derek spend a fair amount of time prancing aimlessly around the woods in their spare time, so they run ahead (Stiles often giving up on keeping pace with Derek and settling for perching on his back as he bounds through the trees,) while Isaac sniffs around unfamiliar sections of forest. His wolf form, small and thin, is ghostlike as it flits around underneath the moon, paws almost hovering above the ground in their hesitancy. He looks like an inverted version of Derek, petite and pale while Derek resembles a furry black horse. \nPerched between Derek\u2019s heaving shoulder blades, Stiles twists his head to look at Isaac, sniffing delicately at a patch of moss hugging a tree some ten yards away. He wonders what the sheriff would pick up from observing Isaac. As far as Stiles knows, the sheriff\u2019s experience with Isaac extends only to the prosecuting of Mr. Lahey, who had been put behind bars in record time a few months ago. If the sheriff were with them now, watching Isaac hang back, cautiously explore his surroundings, flinch at the hoot of an owl dozens of feet above him, he would think- he would think-\nHe would think Derek and Stiles aren\u2019t doing their jobs. This polite, perfunctory relationship they have with Isaac is not what pack is. When was the last time Stiles spoke anything more than small talk with Isaac?\nStiles watches Isaac carefully for the rest of the night, slotting a plan into place all the while.\nStiles invites Isaac to his birthday party. He has to put together a birthday party to invite Isaac to first, but that\u2019s not exactly a chore, and he gets the feeling Isaac will balk if Stiles just pulls him into a crushing hug and demands that they be family, so a birthday party it is. The sheriff declines his invitation, explaining that a bunch of kids won\u2019t want to hang out with an old cop like me, but Stiles gets Lydia and Scott to come. Derek\u2019s a given, of course. Isaac gives a tentative yes, pending his ability to get a ride. \nStiles makes Derek go pick Isaac up in the camaro, and puts up neon green streamers in the living room while he\u2019s gone without any major incidents. He\u2019s actually quite proud of himself. He picked out the whole color scheme on his own. Sure, the colors don\u2019t match, but he picked all of them, which is a step in the right direction. \nSpinning the stack of sparkling party hats in his hands, Stiles smiles. This will be a good day. \nIt\u2019s actually kind of an awkward day. The only other person who will deign to wear a party hat is Derek, and that\u2019s just because he loves Stiles, so he has to. Lydia refuses any kind of birthday themed pastry, citing a diet (\u201cit\u2019s a lemon sugar cleanse, Stiles,\u201d) and Isaac spends most of the party glued to Scott\u2019s side. Stiles makes it work though: an hour in, he pulls out a DVD he had rented on his very own (okay, the sheriff helped) from the video rental place that still limps along downtown. It\u2019s some silly thing from the 80s with terrible effects, but it\u2019s about a werewolf who plays basketball, so Stiles thinks they\u2019ll enjoy it anyway. Stiles\u2019 prediction proves true when nobody can resist watching it, even as they all cringe at the poor man\u2019s chewbacca costume that the lead actor has to wear.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Derek murmurs into Stiles\u2019 ear.\nDragging Derek\u2019s arm around his shoulders, Stiles retorts, \u201cyeah, yeah, but do I know how to throw a party or do I know how to throw a party?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes.\n\u201cWell, do I?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how to throw a party.\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah I do!\u201d\n\u201cSshh!\u201d\n\u201cSorry Lydia.\u201d\nStiles directs his gaze back to his laptop screen, but he can\u2019t help but watch Isaac out of the corner of his eye. He\u2019s sitting next to Scott, of course, they\u2019ve been best friends since forever, (although Stiles can\u2019t help but side-eye Scott for being so oblivious about the whole Mr. Lahey being a child abusing douchenozzle thing.) But Stiles thinks it\u2019s probably not normal to keep scooting slightly closer to your best friend throughout a movie, so carefully that they don\u2019t notice, until you\u2019re pressed all up against their side and leaning your head on their shoulder, even though you\u2019re too tall for it to be comfortable at all.\nTrying his very best to withhold an evil grin, Stiles leans back against Derek\u2019s shoulder. He has something to talk to Isaac about.\n\u201cSoooo,\u201d Stiles drawls after Scott and Lydia are gone, \u201cScott, huh?\u201d\nIsaac pauses in his quest to remove all of the dirty paper plates and utensils from the coffee table. He leapt to cleaning duty without anybody asking, a reflex, and it makes Stiles sort of sad. \n\u201cWhat about Scott?\u201d\nStiles waggles his eyebrows. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says suggestively, channelling his best impression of a gossipy middle school girl. It\u2019s a damn good impression, he thinks, even if he\u2019s never met one in real life. \nIsaac almost drops his handful of frosting covered napkins. \u201cIs it that obvious? Shit. Shit, I, uh,\u201d he moves his laden arms fruitlessly for a moment, before looking helplessly at Stiles. \u201cDo you think he knows?\u201d\nOh yeah, look at them go, having a real conversation. \u201cProbably not,\u201d Stiles replies slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s nice and all, but kind of as dumb as a brick that got dropped on the head as a child.\u201d\nSighing, Isaac dumps his handful of party supplies into the overloaded trash bin. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nStiles waits for Isaac to say something else, but he seems about done.\n\u201cSo, uh, you gonna ask him out?\u201d Stiles asks. \nIsaac looks at Stiles with big blue eyes that question Stiles\u2019 sanity. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWho knows? He could say yes.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dating Allison Argent,\u201d Isaac points out, a trace of bitterness in his tone as he rips one of the streamers off of the wall, scotch tape easily pulling free.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure high school relationships don\u2019t last forever,\u201d Stiles offers, taking the streamer from Isaac\u2019s hands. He fears for its safety.\nIsaac rolls his eyes. \u201cTry telling Scott that. He and Allison are forever.\u201d\nStiles flounders for a second. He\u2019s supposed to be having a fun, pack-brotherly chat with Isaac. It\u2019s getting kind of not fun. \u201cBut hey, haven\u2019t you two known each other for longer?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Isaac snaps. \u201cYes we have, and I\u2019ve been in love with him for almost that entire time, but I\u2019m never going to tell him because he is straight and in love with a girl he\u2019s known for less than a year and not once, in the entire time I\u2019ve known him, has he looked at me like that at all.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Stiles asks before he can stop himself.\nIsaac grits his jaw. \u201cLike I\u2019m perfect.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m just the sidekick. I\u2019m fine with that anyway. Which is why,\u201d he looks Stiles straight in the eye, \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to say anything to anyone.\u201d\nIsaac leaves fairly quickly after that. Stiles assesses the situation: pro- he got Isaac to actually look him in the eyes. That hasn\u2019t ever happened before. Con- Isaac is sort of ticked off at him and seems pretty determined to keep himself to himself. \nStiles is going to need a better strategy. \nDerek comes up behind Stiles and slips his arms around his waist. \u201cI\u2019m pretending I didn\u2019t hear any of that?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Stiles leans back against Derek\u2019s chest. \u201cUgh, I just want us to be one big happy pack.\u201d\n\u201cWe will be,\u201d Derek says into Stiles\u2019 hair, mouth moving against the strands he cut himself. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you could make it happen through sheer force of will.\u201d\nStiles chuckles lightly, pressing his forehead up against the cool glass of the window. Derek exhales and buries his nose into Stiles\u2019 neck.\n\u201cHey, what do I smell like?\u201d\n\u201cSugar,\u201d Derek notes quietly, softly rubbing his nose up and down the side of Stiles\u2019 neck, \u201csweat-\u201d\n\u201cAlways with the sweat.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone smells like sweat.\u201d Derek\u2019s thumb idly rubs along the bottom of Stiles\u2019 ribcage before adding, \u201cturnips. Yes, turnips,\u201d he says before Stiles can question it, \u201cand, and time.\u201d\nWerewolves can\u2019t smell time, Stiles knows that. They may have good noses, but even werewolves can\u2019t smell abstract concepts. Yet Stiles doesn\u2019t need the voice of the sheriff in his head saying \u201cdowncast eyes, clenched shoulders, hands gripping too tight\u201d to tell him that Derek doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. So Stiles lets Derek hang onto him, and doesn\u2019t ask what has him so scared. It\u2019s Derek. Stiles will learn what it is eventually. \nBesides, what\u2019s so different now than from a year ago? Near as Stiles can tell, everything has gotten better. \nOkay, maybe he runs a little slower in his fox form than he used to, but whatever. \nXXXXX\n\u201cI\u2019m going to regret this, I know it,\u201d the sheriff says as they walk into his garage, \u201cbut no however-old-you-are is not going to know how to drive a car on my watch. Kids these days always take forever to get their licenses, and you are not going to be one of those kids, mister.\u201d\nFlicking on the garage lights, the sheriff descends the short set of stairs leading into the garage and positions himself at one end of a bulky, canvas covered shape parked on the cement floor. \u201cGo around the back, would you?\u201d\nStiles does, and together they tug the canvas off of what turns out to be a giant box of a car, pale blue with a fifth tire fastened to the back end. \nThe sheriff scrubs a hand over his hair, determinedly looking at a little scratch on the hood. \u201cIt was my wife\u2019s. Not the best starter car, but I\u2019m sure as hell not illegally teaching a kid without a learner\u2019s permit how to drive in my cruiser.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Stiles says, because it is. Here\u2019s a car with some personality. \n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d the sheriff corrects. \u201cA piece like this is always gonna be a she. Now come on, let\u2019s go find an empty parking lot.\u201d\nDriving is harder than Stiles thought it would be, though the sheriff assures him that most of the problem is that he\u2019s driving a manual transmission, whatever that means. It\u2019s also sort of terrifying to be solely in charge of a rolling bulk of who knows how many tons of metal. But with the sheriff directing his hand on the driveshaft, and his stern, matter-of-fact instructions, Stiles manages to weave the jeep in and out of parking spaces without any major injuries. \n\u201cNot bad,\u201d the sheriff notes approvingly when Stiles centers the jeep perfectly in between the two painted white lines for the first time. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a total disaster.\u201d\n\u201cStory of my life,\u201d Stiles snorts as he painstakingly switches into reverse to duck back out of the spot. \nThe sheriff makes a skeptical noise. \u201cYou do fine, kid. Even if you\u2019re a little different, you do fine.\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cI guess. I\u2019m doing better than I was three months ago, at least.\u201d\nThe sheriff allows a minute of silence before asking, \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Stiles turns the steering wheel a little further than he has to and frantically overcorrects. \u201cI used to be really bad about being left alone.\u201d\nMaking an understanding noise, the sheriff pats Stiles\u2019 arm. He still doesn\u2019t know much about Stiles\u2019 past. As far as Stiles can tell, he assumes that Stiles had a sheltered childhood, then his parents died, then he went on to have a lukewarm relationship with the foster care system until he turned 18, met Derek, and settled down with him to live off of the Hale life insurance money. Stiles doesn\u2019t come off as a dynamic, can-do kind of guy in that story, but he also doesn\u2019t come off as a magical shape-shifting forest animal, so he figures it\u2019s alright. The sheriff treats him with respect anyway, despite automatically thinking \u201cabuse\u201d when Stiles accidentally shows off how awkwardly he fits into the human world. \n\u201cThat\u2019s common with people who were in your situation, Stiles. I\u2019m glad it passed.\u201d\nStiles tries not to make a lying, lying, I\u2019m lying face and says, \u201cI\u2019m glad too. It was hard, freaking out any time Derek left the vicinity.\u201d\nHumming in agreement, the sheriff says, \u201cswitch gears,\u201d and then, \u201cyeah, nobody should ever tie themselves up with only one person. You have to have people, plural.\u201d\n\u201cLike I\u2019ve got you and Derek.\u201d And Isaac, he adds mentally, if all goes well.\n\u201cRight.\u201d The sheriff smiles. \u201cExactly right.\u201d\nXXXXX\nDerek goes out grocery shopping (with heart-healthy additions to the shopping list for when the sheriff comes over,) and Stiles stays home. He even does it voluntarily. Why yes he is proud of himself. \nStiles walks into the backyard and stretches his arms way above his head, then brings them down to touch his toes, reveling in the pleasant stretch. He\u2019s going for a run. It\u2019s a thing humans do, morning runs, and he\u2019s going to give it a shot. He\u2019s also going to do it in a nonhuman form, but hey, baby steps. Stripping down to bare skin, Stiles prepares to switch bodies. Not much prep is needed; he just has to believe really hard that he\u2019s a fox, and then he is one. \nOkay, fox. Fox. Foxy foxy fox fox. \nStiles blinks down at his bare toes. Come on. He closes his eyes, breathes in through his nose, out through the mouth. Red fur, the ground closer to his line of sight, chasing rodents through the underbrush- \nthere.\nShould it really be so difficult to revert to his natural state?\nStiles reaches a paw up to scratch behind his ear, then takes off into the forest. He takes up the fox equivalent of a moderate jog as he navigates the familiar patches of trees behind the house, then further out, past the old creek and one of the hollow trees where he and Derek used to stay, back in the construction days. \nIt\u2019s peaceful, early enough that the shadows are long and there\u2019s still dew on the plant life. The morning birds are hooting and chirruping at each other, the deer are lightly crunching over fallen twigs, the fox is digging with determined fervor at the base of-\nWait. Stiles turns his head, sniffing with his long snout and looking for- there! A flash of red fur, jumping up and down as its paws scrabble at the dirt below. \nStiles prances over, his tail wagging behind him. Foxes are rare around here, it\u2019s nice to see one of his red-furred buddies around.\nThe other fox notices him quickly, and growls lightly, crouching over the tunnel it\u2019s dug to some terrified mole\u2019s cave. \nI\u2019m not going to take your food, Stiles says, but the fox doesn\u2019t hear him, or can\u2019t understand. He takes a small step forward, and the fox growls again, baring tiny, sharp teeth. \nStiles knows when he isn\u2019t wanted. He backs off, wondering when he became so strange to other foxes they wouldn\u2019t let him near. \nA half-hour of fox-jogging later, he\u2019s feeling normal again, just in time for a wolf to careen out of the bushes, leap over him, and dash off into the distance, sending the bracken under its feet flying. Once he picks himself off the ground, Stiles balances up on his back legs to see the wolf better.\nIt\u2019s Isaac. Makes sense, they\u2019re near to his apartment, and there are exactly two wolves hanging around the preserve. Stiles follows the wolf, lagging far behind, but managing to keep him in his sights. He really is getting slower. \nWhen Isaac gives up on running to dig his claws into a tree trunk and tear into it like it had killed his firstborn, Stiles manages to catch up. \nIsaac, he calls, hoping that he can communicate with more werewolves than Derek. \nIsaac looks up in confusion. Apparently he can. W-what?\n\nIt\u2019s Stiles. Are you okay?\n\n\nFine. \n\n\nNo you\u2019re not. Humans, man. Never saying what they\u2019re really feeling.You have clothing scraps on you. You shifted unexpectedly, which means either you were attacked, or you\u2019ve got some kind of emotional turmoil going-\n\nOkay, okay. If wolves could roll their eyes, Isaac would be doing so right now. Anybody ever tell you you\u2019re really nosy?\n\nI prefer \u201ccurious.\u201d Also, I conveniently don\u2019t really care about being polite. \n\n\nObviously. \n\nSee, I would be offended by that, if I cared about politeness. Anyways, Stiles settles onto the ground, propping his head up on his paws and looking at Isaac with big eyes. Story time. What\u2019s eating you?\nWhat do you think? Isaac retorts snippily.\n\nScott?\n\nHuffing a great breath of air out of his nostrils, Isaac rips another chunk of bark off of a poor redwood. Scott. \n\nWhat now?\n\n\nNothing I didn\u2019t already know.\n\n\nEnough to make you upset. Come on, vent to me. Papa Stiles will listen. \n\n\nDon\u2019t call yourself that, it\u2019s weird.\n\n\nPapa Hale?\n\n\nWeirder. \n\nCome onnnn, Stiles whines, what is pack for if not listening to your grievances and things?\nScott and Allison are back together, Isaac explains quickly, like saying the words faster give them less effect. \n\nThey were apart?\n\n\nBriefly. I think they get off on being the Ross and Rachel of BHHS. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know what that means. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. Another chunk of bark gone. It just means that I got my hopes up like an idiot, because for a week, Scott thought he and Allison were never getting back together. Then they did, which, of course they would, Stiles is starting to worry about the health of the tree, which is basically getting skinned, I just got a week of Scott and Isaac time like we used to have before she came along, then had it ripped away from me, like the universe was saying \u201coh yeah, that\u2019s enough of that, we just wanted to remind you what it could be like if he loved you the way he loves Allison.\u201d\n\nEasy, buddy, easy. It\u2019s going to be alright.\n\nFuck you. You found your true fucking love before you were even sentient, and he loved you back. Me, I found mine in kindergarten, and he never even noticed, even though he\u2019s been my entire social life for as long as I can remember. Isaac rubs a paw past his eye. Maybe Derek has a hot younger sister or something. I could make that work.\nStiles dares to come a little closer. Isaac looks about done with the vicious use of claws, and Stiles thinks he might actually have some helpful advice this time. Isaac, I think you and I need to have a talk about having people, not person. \nIsaac scoffs at first, but Stiles makes him come to Saturday night dinner with the sheriff anyway. Isaac is going to socialize with people he isn\u2019t infatuated with, or Stiles\u2019 name isn\u2019t Stiles. Well, technically Stiles\u2019 name isn\u2019t actually Stiles, but Stiles still invites Isaac to pack dinners, and makes the sheriff bring Isaac as his plus one to bowling, and sends Isaac off on a run with Derek once a week, whether they need it or not.\nHe can tell it makes Derek happy, this new effort to bring Isaac into the fold. He\u2019s delightfully awkward with Isaac, unsure of what mixture of gruffness and affection to show. Derek is hesitant to display open affection with anyone other than Stiles, (which Stiles is starting to think is more of a Derek thing than a human thing,) so his interactions with Isaac are good-intentioned, but clumsy. But Stiles knows that something is going right when Derek starts to perk up when Isaac approaches the front door, and really knows it when Derek takes Isaac out to get a car of his own. \nIt\u2019s a secondhand toyota, Isaac wouldn\u2019t let Derek get him something too fancy, but it\u2019s clean, and functional, and it means Isaac can get around town quickly for the first time. Between the toyota, the camaro, and the jeep that Stiles occasionally has custody over, the driveway to their house can be downright crowded. \n\u201cYou guys really need to get real dishes,\u201d Isaac points out as they empty the settings of the dinner table into the trash, \u201cit\u2019s getting too bachelor pad for me, and I live with art students.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m going to agree with Isaac on that one,\u201d the sheriff says, holding a stained paper cup gingerly between two fingers. \n\u201cBut real dishes mean real dishwashing,\u201d Stiles objects. \nThe sheriff raises a don\u2019t-you-question-me-on-this-son eyebrow. \u201cYou have a sink.\u201d\n\u201cWe also have a trashcan,\u201d Derek hefts the can in question. \u201cIt works.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad for the environment.\u201d Isaac points a long, accusing finger at it. \nStiles can see Derek\u2019s resolve falter. \u201cThat\u2019s, um, true, but-\u201d\n\u201cAnd dishware is more sanitary, since you can wash it. You can\u2019t wash paper plates,\u201d Isaac continues, seeing a crack in Derek\u2019s defenses and aiming for it. \u201cCome on, if you can spend three hours washing the camaro-\u201d\n\u201cFine, fine. Smartass.\u201d\nThey get real dishes. Derek gets them in Isaac\u2019s favorite color, (blue,) and in the space of a day, their kitchen approximation suddenly looks like a real kitchen. This is why Stiles laughs at anybody who doesn\u2019t think Derek is a giant teddy bear. \nXXXXX\n\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d\n\u201cResearch.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my thing,\u201d Stiles protests playfully, poking Derek\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cWell now it\u2019s my thing.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Stiles says knowingly, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to impersonate me. Lemme see.\u201d He reaches a hand for the laptop. \n\u201cNo.\u201d Derek holds the laptop out of Stiles\u2019 reach. \n\u201cDereeekkkkk.\u201d\n\u201cStiiiiillleess.\u201d\n\u201cYou are so annoying, oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cA guy can\u2019t look something up in secret?\u201d\n\u201cIs it porn? It\u2019s porn, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes, gesturing at how Stiles, in his quest for the laptop, has ended up straddled over Derek\u2019s lap. \u201cI have you for that. Anyway, it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, fine.\u201d Stiles wriggles a little in Derek\u2019s lap. He wears pants most of the time now, but he can still tell when Derek is interested. \u201cCan the research wait for a little bit, though?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Derek asks, feigning innocence.\nBy the time Stiles is done with him, there\u2019s no way Derek is innocent. \nThe surprise turns out to be a visit to the coast, so Stiles can see the ocean for the first time. It\u2019s the largest thing he\u2019s ever seen, and watching the immeasurable amounts of water roll over each other fills him with both terror and euphoria.\nA few weeks later, they pack up the jeep (more space,) and Derek takes him all the way down to LA. It\u2019s the most people Stiles has ever seen gathered into one place, and standing in the bustle, the hollering of street vendors and the drawling chatter of women with small dogs, Stiles feels like dancing, then going somewhere quiet with clean air. \nHis wish is granted when, a few weeks after they return from LA, Derek drags him out to sequoia national park to see the world\u2019s largest trees. This trip is Stiles\u2019 favorite, because when night falls, he and Derek sneak out of their cabin, change into their other bodies, (it still takes Stiles a minute, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with that,) and chase each other around the massive bases of the towering trees, losing each other, then finding each other again, listening to the groaning of the swaying sequoia branches all the while. \nIt\u2019s when Derek suggests they take a road trip to the grand canyon (they can\u2019t fly, Stiles can\u2019t get a passport,) that Stiles starts to wonder what\u2019s going on. It hasn\u2019t just been the trips to new places, it\u2019s also been, \u201clet\u2019s go for lebanese food, you\u2019ll want to try it,\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s go swimming. I\u2019ll teach you,\u201d and \u201chave you ever tried painting? I think you would like it. Acrylics, maybe,\u201d and, \u201cjust come on, Stiles, if you don\u2019t like it, at least you\u2019ll have experienced it. I just want you to try new things. No regrets, you know?\u201d\nStiles asks Derek what\u2019s going on while they\u2019re mini-golfing (kind of fun.) He asks again after a disastrous attempt at making souvlaki (not to Stiles\u2019 taste.) Again at the amusement park (nauseating.) While getting henna tattoos. Assembling IKEA furniture. Playing World of Warcraft. Making out at Beacon Hills\u2019 prime \u201cparking\u201d spot. Kiwis. Roller blading. Murals. Museums. Kayaking. \nHe never gets a satisfactory answer. But there are worse fates than having your Derek insistent on a slew of inventive dates. Stiles just can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s something he isn\u2019t understanding, either a human mannerism going over his head, or some quirk entirely Derek\u2019s own. \nXXXXX\nHis second birthday shows up entirely unexpectedly. Derek says this is an aging thing: \u201ctime goes faster the longer you experience it,\u201d he said, an odd tilt to his voice. It makes sense. The last year passed in a blur of fist bumps with Isaac (fine, they\u2019re lame, but they\u2019re our thing,) chats with the sheriff, (I\u2019m telling you, communication is the key to any relationship, Stiles. You have to sit him down and ask him what\u2019s wrong, no buts about it,) the occasional blur of Scott (hey dude!) and Lydia (hello Stiles,) and everything else with Derek. \nNo matter Derek\u2019s occasional weirdness, Stiles is finding that this humanity thing is starting to work out for him. Isaac is starting to make noises about art students not being great roommates, \u201cI mean, there\u2019s paint everywhere, if only I knew some people who wouldn\u2019t mind a third person hanging around the house...\u201d and Stiles can walk around downtown and not feel like there are eyes on him everywhere, screaming impostor impostor impostor. Not to mention, this time in preparation for the party, Stiles picks out a color scheme that makes sense, double checks Lydia\u2019s current diet to make sure they have some sort of desert for her that\u2019s as carb/sugar/fat free as she wants, and gets the sheriff to come, no ifs, ands or buts about it. \nStiles experiences a brief moment of panic when Scott turns up with a pretty, dark-haired girl who turns out to be the infamous Allison, but Isaac seems alright about it, and Allison is unerringly nice to everyone. Stiles has to grudgingly admit that she and Scott go together well. \n\u201cHarris is a dick,\u201d Scott confides over his glass, \u201cthat\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\u201cScott!\u201d Allison exclaims in exasperation.\nIsaac shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s not lying.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dick and he doesn\u2019t know a thing about chemistry,\u201d Lydia adds. \u201cThat\u2019s why I took it over the summer at BHCC.\u201d\nStiles hums in sympathy. \u201cGlad I never had to deal with him.\u201d\nScott snorts. \u201cWell you never had to deal with any asshole teachers-\u201d\nStiles kicks him under the table and casts a pointed gaze at the sheriff, who\u2019s mostly concerned with sitting in the most comfortable chair and eating cake. \nDerek, noting Stiles\u2019 distress, quickly picks up the thread of the conversation again. \u201cThe chem teacher before Harris was a pothead.\u201d\nThe conversation turns towards the various proclivities of teachers, real or imagined, and Stiles breathes a sigh of relief. He doesn\u2019t think the sheriff would cast him aside if he knew the truth, but he doesn\u2019t want the sheriff looking at him differently, or feeling like he has to cover up for Stiles not technically existing in the eyes of the federal government. It hurts to lie though. Stiles compensates by trying not to think about it. \nThey don\u2019t have AC, so when it gets too stuffy in the little living room, the party moves out into the backyard so they can lounge in the cooler evening air. It\u2019s been an unusually cool summer, and Lydia blames global warming. Stiles doesn\u2019t quite understand it, but it has to do with increased precipitation or something. Impending climate crisis or not, between the cool breeze at his front, and Derek\u2019s warmth pressed against his back, Stiles is in a pretty comfortable place, temperature-wise.\nDerek has been pretty clingy and quiet throughout the party. He isn\u2019t the best in large groups, but normally he doesn\u2019t stick to Stiles\u2019 side like a disoriented kid hanging onto his favorite stuffed animal. \nThe sheriff appears from the kitchen then, bearing a cake with candles flaming on top, and rumbling out the slow beginnings of the happy birthday song. Everybody else joins in, and Stiles sings along too, because why the hell not. \nThe cake-bearing procession stops in front of Stiles, and he smiles at his friends. \u201cThanks, you guys! I mean, I picked out the cake myself, but that was some top-notch singing you did there, really prime.\u201d\nThey\u2019re still looking expectantly at him. \n\u201cShould I be giving a speech or something?\u201d\n\u201cBlow out the candles, Stiles,\u201d the sheriff prompts gently.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Stiles leans forward and gusts his breath over each of the twenty-two candles. Last year, he hadn\u2019t even known birthday cakes required candles; now he\u2019s upgraded to not knowing they need to be blown out. Not bad. \nThe cake gets set down and chopped up with one of the knives the sheriff bequeathed to them for christmas, and all the while the party guests make cracks about Stiles\u2019 age. This is part of the ritual, he supposes. \n\u201cSomebody\u2019s getting ancient,\u201d Scott nudges Stiles\u2019 shoulder, \u201cmight want to start looking into Bodox.\u201d\n\u201cBotox, sweetie,\u201d Allison corrects, kissing Scott\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cBotox.\u201d\nIsaac smirks. \u201cIf I still worked at the graveyard, I could have gotten you a plot on a discount, you need to be getting one soon, right?\u201d\nStiles tugs on one of Isaac\u2019s curls while the sheriff shakes his head. \u201cTwenty-two. They grow up so fast.\u201d\nStiles smiles nervously. He\u2019d basically picked his age out of a hat. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Blink and maybe I\u2019ll be as old as you!\u201d\nDerek mutely cuts another piece of cake and hands it off to Lydia, who forgets her diet for a moment in favor of an icing flower. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Allison says, with the suddenness of somebody just realizing something, \u201cI don\u2019t think I caught your name. I\u2019m so bad with them.\u201d She sticks a hand out at Derek, who shakes it. \n\u201cDerek Hale.\u201d\n\u201cAllison Argent.\u201d\nThe knife, which had been separating the \u201cHap\u201d from the \u201cpy Birthday,\u201d freezes as Derek\u2019s entire body tenses up. Allison\u2019s jaw tightens, and Stiles thinks Derek just might be squeezing the hell out of her hand. \n\u201cArgent?\u201d Derek asks, sounding like each syllable is being cut out of him. \n\u201cYes.\u201d\nDerek releases her hand. \u201cBut you\u2019re familiar with our situation?\u201d\nShe smiles blithely, but her eyes are hard and understanding. \u201cMore or less. I\u2019m just here for the party.\u201d\nNodding slowly, Derek returns to cutting the cake. \u201cGood. Have this piece.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m missing something here,\u201d the sheriff mutters. Stiles pretends not to have heard him. \nThe cake is eaten and the drinks drunk and conversation made and a lackluster game of truth or dare attempted, when Stiles looks up and realizes Derek had left. At first, he thinks Derek\u2019s just stepped out to the other room, the party getting to be a bit too much for him, but then it\u2019s late at night, and everybody\u2019s gone but Isaac and the sheriff, and by then it\u2019s very clear that Derek is gone. Gone gone. \n\u201cHe\u2019s probably just gone for a walk,\u201d Stiles reassures the sheriff as he ushers him out the door. \u201cNothing to be worried about. We\u2019re still on for Tuesday, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The sheriff pulls Stiles in for a quick hug, (Stilinski hugs are the best,) but his brows are still furrowed when he turns to walk out to his car.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Isaac asks in a soft tone, \u201cdo you think he\u2019s out on a run for some reason?\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cHis car\u2019s still here,\u201d keep your heartbeat slow, don\u2019t freak Isaac out, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon. Go get some sleep, don\u2019t you have work tomorrow?\u201d\nIsaac makes a face. \u201cYeah I do. See you later, man.\u201d He claps Stiles on the back and leaves as well. \nStiles waits until Isaac and the sheriff\u2019s headlights disappear around the corner before making a beeline for the backyard, stripping his clothes off as he goes. If Derek went out for a run without even telling Stiles, something must have really upset him, and an upset Derek is one that needs a shoulder to cry on. Specifically, Stiles\u2019 shoulder.\nIt takes a frustratingly long time for him to manage the shift, but manage it he does, and soon he\u2019s speeding out into the woods, with his fox eyes, suited to darkness, scanning the surroundings with hawklike vigilance for any glimpse of moving black fur. Derek could be lost, or too emotional to change back, or caught under a fallen rock. He could have a paw caught in a bear trap, or have eaten some poisonous berries, or have been caught by a duct tape and knife wielding murderer. \nStiles knows its irrational, Derek\u2019s known these woods almost his entire life, but Derek\u2019s life has been marked so many tragedies and incidents of dramatic irony that misfortune seems inevitable. \nGod, his whole family is dead. \nStiles\u2019 stomach turns at the idea of just losing Derek, what if the sheriff and Isaac and Lydia and Scott were gone too? He\u2019d be all alone.\nAn owl hoots loudly above him and Stiles\u2019 speed increases another notch as he careens through the trees, looking for anything that signals Derek\u2019s passage. He doesn\u2019t know where Derek is. He doesn\u2019t know where Derek is, and he doesn\u2019t know where he is, either. It\u2019s late, so late, and the familiar old moon is just a sliver in the sky, a wicked curving smile that casts no light, so all Stiles has to go by are old, old scent trails for his insensitive nose, or the black kaleidoscope of shadows criss-crossing over each other, making it hard to tell what is solid and what isn\u2019t, what\u2019s an illusion and what is actually an upheld claw, reaching towards him-\nThe ground disappears, and Stiles is drenched and freezing, barely able to breathe, being buffeted to and fro by the robust little current rushing through the creek bed. He coughs, wishing for his human body and the ability to just stand, but he can\u2019t pull himself together enough to change forms, he\u2019s helpless and lost, his vision regularly getting blurred out by a new wave of water. \nBlindly, Stiles reaches out a paw, feeling for anything solid. He needs to find Derek, Derek will not be in a creek. There\u2019s a touch of something against his paw, but it moves away quickly, just a twig getting pushed downstream. He needs to find Derek. The soft give of mud under his feet, just enough to give him bearing. He needs to find Derek. \nAir. Land. \nStiles heaves and coughs on the bank for a moment, then two, before rousing himself again. He\u2019s here for a reason, isn\u2019t he? Would the sheriff just wheeze and stand around if he was searching for a missing person? No. Would Isaac just loiter around and hope that somebody else figures his problems out for him? No.\nStiles starts running again. If Derek is really in a funk, he has the ability to go far, and the further away he gets from their home, the more variables there are over where he went. How in the hell will Stiles find him? He can track, but only tiny rodents to their holes ten feet away, he doesn\u2019t have werewolf super smell, or-\nHe has a pack member who does. \nFiguring now is as good a time as any to experiment, Stiles raises his not-quite-a-voice as loud as he can, and hollers Isaaaac! Isaac!\nNothing. Again. Isaac! Come here! SOS and stuff!\n\nIsaac!\n\nHow far can his internal voice carry? A mile? It probably won\u2019t be enough, but Stiles has to try.\n\nIsaac!\n\nWhat? Isaac\u2019s pale form looms out of the shadows. \n\nAh! Oh my god! \n\n\nWhat?\n\n\nGive me a heart attack, why don\u2019t you? What are you doing here?\n\n\nLooking for Derek. You didn\u2019t honestly think I was going home, did you?\n\nStiles wishes he could laugh disbelievingly in this form, he really does. I could have used you a lot earlier, Lahey. \n\nWell I could have used you just letting me follow you in the first place, instead of kicking me out. \n\n\nFair point. \n\n\nDamn right it\u2019s a fair point. Now let\u2019s go find our Alpha. \n\nThe search is much easier with Isaac\u2019s nose leading the way. Stiles suspects that if Isaac hadn\u2019t had to drive his car home first, Isaac would have beaten him to Derek long since. But for now, they follow the path Isaac\u2019s nose takes them through, down into a fern-lined canyon filled with spiderwebs, then back out, through a grove of old-growth redwoods and around an impressive sinkhole Stiles never knew existed in the preserve. \nThey find Derek at the base of a dead tree, struck silver by lightning. He doesn\u2019t look good. \nHe\u2019s in his wolf form, dirt mucking up each of his paws, his fur wild, and he\u2019s curled in on himself, emitting low, pained whines with each breath. \nDerek! Stiles rushes down the slope to the tree, his four paws almost tangling with each other in their rush to reach him. Are you hurt?\nDerek, far gone, just whines lowly and pulls Stiles in with a paw. His body warmth feels good- Stiles is still dripping wet from his dip in the creek.\nI don\u2019t smell blood, Isaac noses carefully around Derek\u2019s form. He might just be upset. \nAbout what? Derek! Stiles is useless like this, too tiny to do anything. He shifts human. If Isaac is weirded out by the nudity, he doesn\u2019t show it. Cradling Derek\u2019s head in his two hands, Stiles cranes his head around to look him in an eye. \n\u201cDerek, you\u2019re freaking me out, and that isn\u2019t very nice. You wouldn\u2019t like me when I\u2019m freaked out. Just, come on. It\u2019s just me.\u201d He shoots a meaningful glance at Isaac, who pointedly retreats a distance away.\nDerek snorts and buries his nose into Stiles\u2019 stomach. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, man. Come on. I love you and I\u2019m worried.\u201d Let\u2019s see Derek try to ignore that. \n\nIt\u2019s nothing. \n\n\u201cYou always say that.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll calm down. Don\u2019t worry about me.\n\n\u201cHave you met me? I\u2019m going to worry about you one way or the other, and if you don\u2019t tell me what crawled up your butt, then I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStiles...\n\n\u201cYou owe money to the mafia?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fine. Nothing like that.\n\n\u201cYou secretly have a second family with four kids?\u201d\n\nNo, I-\n\n\u201cThis whole time, you\u2019ve been planning on selling me into the Indonesian slave trade?\u201d\nYou caught me, Derek replies dryly.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles\u2019 mouth quirks up. \u201cYou sending me away forever?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of pensive quiet, then Derek shifts back into human form so he can wrap his arms around Stiles\u2019 neck and press his face into Stiles\u2019 hair. Used to being manhandled like a favorite stuffed animal, Stiles lets himself be moved into position. \n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect, you know that?\u201d Derek whispers into Stiles\u2019 hair. He still has trouble looking Stiles in the eye when he says these things.\nStiles smiles into Derek\u2019s neck. \u201cSay stuff like that, you\u2019re bound to be proven wrong somehow.\u201d\nChuckling bitterly into Stiles\u2019 hair, Derek says bluntly, \u201cfox lifespans run around two to four years.\u201d\n\u201cWh-\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m upset.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m dying?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t want to process this information. \u201cEveryone\u2019s dying.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s arms tighten, a blanket of muscle around Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how much the magic did to you, maybe you\u2019ll live to be one hundred, but with my luck-\u201d he shakes his head, his stubble catching against Stiles\u2019 hair, \u201cyou know what happened to my family. Everything good goes away eventually. Sooner rather than later, in my case.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles breathes, before leaning up to catch Derek\u2019s mouth in a kiss. Long ago, years ago now, Derek had taught him how to kiss properly, how to take a brush of mouths to an expression of emotion, to a way of projecting feeling. Derek is a better kisser than Stiles, but Stiles determinedly pours all of the reassurance he has into the kiss, trying to say it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here, without saying the words, because Derek has always appreciated action over words anyway.\nDerek exhales shakily, and then it\u2019s as though the dam is broken, because he\u2019s saying, \u201cand you were so undernourished when you were a kit, and you\u2019re undersized even now, so your fox form is... isn\u2019t the hardiest, and it seems like one wrong move, and,\u201d he makes a short hand gesture in lieu of words. Stiles gets his meaning. \nDeath. It isn\u2019t something Stiles cares to dwell on. It makes him feel sick and getting worked up about it doesn\u2019t seem to have a point. Stiles reaches out to clasp Derek\u2019s still outstretched hand in his. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he bumps his forehead against Derek\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m here now, and I\u2019m alive.\u201d Stiles pulls Derek\u2019s hand over to his heart, so he can feel the evidence of Stiles\u2019 life beating under his hand. \u201cMaybe that won\u2019t always be the, you know, the case, but either way, there\u2019s not much we can do about death. Might as well enjoy ourselves in the mean time, you know?\u201d\nThe corner of Derek\u2019s mouth twitches, and he tilts his head up to briefly push their lips together. \nA loud growl reverberates through the forest, and they both look up, startled. \n\u201cIsaac? was that you?\u201d Derek calls out.\nIsaac trots up from the opposite direction of the noise. No...\nStiles gets to his feet, and climbs up the slope just enough to glimpse a pair of headlights bouncing their way towards them. \n\u201cSome kind of vehicle,\u201d he relays back to Isaac and Derek, \u201csomething offroad, I guess.\u201d\nDerek looks between his and Stiles\u2019 naked bodies and shifts back into his wolf form. Stiles jogs back to them as quietly as he can, and oh, now is not the time to have trouble shifting (shifting dysfunction?) not when there\u2019s some unknown party speeding towards them in the middle of the night, out where no one can hear them scream-\n\u201cAh-hah!\u201d a familiar voice calls in triumph. \u201cI knew there was something going on!\u201d\nStiles looks up the slope, grimacing, to where the sheriff is seated in the driver\u2019s seat of an ATV with \u201cOfficial California Parks Vehicle\u201d emblazoned on the side. \n\u201cStiles? Are you naked?\u201d The sheriff\u2019s satisfaction looks to be quickly dissolving into horror.\nStiles\u2019 hands fly to his crotch. \u201cTechnically, yes. Is that a stolen ATV?\u201d\n\u201cRequisitioned. Technically,\u201d the sheriff hedges. \u201cStiles, what\u2019s going on? Are you alright? I thought you looked shifty tonight but- holy shit!\u201d \nHe\u2019s noticed the wolves lurking just behind Stiles. \n\u201cStiles, hold still,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s hand slowly reaches towards his hip, where Stiles knows a police-issue handgun hangs.\n\u201cNo, dad, don\u2019t freak out-\u201d\n\u201cThere are two wolves behind you, I want you to very slowly move towards me-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually fine-\u201d\n\u201cStiles, move!\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t dangerous!\u201d\n\u201cDo you know how many animal attacks we had last year, Stiles? Come towards me!\u201d\n\u201cSeriously, it\u2019s-\u201d\nIsaac shifts back into his human form, holding his palms up. \n\u201cAh! Holy shit!\u201d the sheriff yelps, his gun jerking in his hand. \n\u201cSorry, sheriff,\u201d Isaac says ruefully. \u201cBut it\u2019s about time you knew what was going on.\u201d\nStiles could kill him. \nIsaac jerks his head at Derek. \u201cCould you?\u201d\nRumbling in dissatisfaction, Derek becomes human again, crossing his arms over his chest. \nThe sheriff points his gaze carefully over all of their heads. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some explanations, or maybe some time to detox from whatever hallucinogens were in that birthday cake.\u201d\n\u201cAh, well, there is an explanation,\u201d Stiles explains carefully, \u201csee, funny story-\u201d\nIt takes about an hour to assure the sheriff of his sanity, and another forty five minutes for the ATV to take them back to the house, but by the time Isaac is asleep on the couch in a pair of Derek\u2019s old sweats, and the sheriff\u2019s on his third cup of coffee, it looks like they might all be alright. If it weren\u2019t past midnight, a new day started, Stiles would say it was all a pretty good birthday present.\nStiles should have remembered that his life is no longer as simple as it was when he was a fox. Easy resolutions are not so forthcoming, and happy endings don\u2019t come when you want them to. \nIt\u2019s a full moon the next time he shifts. There was a time when he could flit between forms like breathing, but now if he wants to switch, he really needs to mean it. But it\u2019s fine, whatever. Just his body betraying him. \nThe moon is bright and clear, no clouds to disturb its reign over the night sky, and the Hale pack is getting ready for a run. Isaac and Derek are talking about their mutual appreciation for Top Gear, while Stiles and the sheriff finish off the bowl of strawberries while they sit on the back porch. \nDerek looks up at the sky. \u201cAbout time?\u201d he half-asks Stiles.\nStiles nods, standing. \u201cYou may want to avert your eyes,\u201d he tells the sheriff as he strips his shirt off. \u201cVery dangerous nudity about to happen.\u201d\nTwo minutes or so later, Stiles has wrangled his fox form into being. He stretches his legs, flicks his tail, shakes his head, and woah, dizzy. \n\u201cIs that normal?\u201d he hears the sheriff ask. Isaac and Derek are both missing human mouths, but they come up to nudge his sides and whine at him. What are they even doing, Stiles just feels overhot and like the earth is slipping sideways, what does he need two wolves breathing on him for?\nSomeone says \u201che\u2019s falling!\u201d and what do you know, Stiles is on the ground and everything is going black. \nSomeone says \u201che\u2019s waking up!\u201d and Stiles blearily looks up to see fluorescent lights and Dr Deaton\u2019s placid face gazing at him. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d he says calmly, \u201ccan you understand me?\u201d\nYes, Stiles says, and he hears Derek relay it to Deaton. \n\u201cYou\u2019re very sick,\u201d Deaton says, measuring out his words carefully to ensure that Stiles understands what he\u2019s hearing. \u201cYou have a high fever and you\u2019ve been coughing up blood. I think you caught some sort of infection the last time you were in your fox form, then the illness incubated in your fox form while you were human, and now that you\u2019ve returned to your fox body, it has hit hard.\u201d He clears his throat, and that might just be the most emotion Stiles has ever seen Dr Deaton show. \u201cThis means it\u2019s too late for antivirals or antibiotics to do any good.\u201d\nThe words don\u2019t quite register until Stiles looks over to Derek, Isaac, and the sheriff standing against the wall of the examination wall. The sheriff\u2019s lips are pursed, his arms crossed. He looks like he\u2019s trying not to show any emotion at all. Isaac looks angry as he messes with the strings of his sweatshirt. \nDerek is crying openly, and it\u2019s the most terrifying thing Stiles has ever seen. \nHey, hey don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t, Stiles pleads, it\u2019s going to be okay. \nDerek shakes his head, a heavy knowledge in his eyes. \u201cYou must have caught it while you were out looking for me. Your fur was drenched when you showed up, I should have realized-\u201d\nStop it, don\u2019t you dare. Stiles orders. This... this is bad enough as it is without you beating yourself up like a masochistic idiot.\nA noise, half a sob and half a laugh, bursts out of Derek\u2019s throat, and even he looks startled by it. \u201cI was worried about old age, and then you just get sick.\u201d\nThe sheriff grips Derek\u2019s shoulder, steadying him, then directs his gaze at Deaton. \u201cYou never gave a prognosis.\u201d\n\u201cI give him about a day,\u201d Deaton pronounces solemnly, \u201cit isn\u2019t exact, but barring a miracle-\u201d he shrugs. It\u2019s explanation enough. \nStiles feels numb as he\u2019s gathered up in Derek\u2019s arms and ferried out of the clinic. He\u2019s never felt so small. How had this happened so suddenly? All of his words of reassurance to Derek not a few weeks before already seem so naive and pointless. \nStiles tries returning to his human form, of course, but he can\u2019t seem to find the energy, or the will, or the magic to do it. It seems about right that he\u2019ll be born and die a fox. Circle of life and all of that.\nHe never watched Lion King. Looks like he never will.\nThe sheriff and Isaac stay, of course. The four of them crowd onto the tiny living room couch together, Stiles on Derek\u2019s lap, from which he has no plans to move from again. \nNobody knows what to say. Small talk is too trivial, and nobody is wild about the idea of moaning and wailing over his deathbed just yet. Isaac puts on some music to fill the silence, and then they mostly sit. \nDerek\u2019s hand rests over Stiles\u2019 ribs, feeling him breathe, then feeling the vibrations of his ribs when coughs wrack his body. Stiles\u2019 head hurts so much, and the light in the room starts to stab at his eyes, until he closes them and presses his face into Derek\u2019s stomach. \nAn old memory, a fox memory, floats to the top of his brain. Sleeping on Derek\u2019s stomach, feeling warm and safe and no longer alone for once. Thinking good, and that this is where he will stay. \nThen he remembers nights counting the stars when they no longer had a roof over their head, nights spent enjoying their new bed once they had a real roof. The first time he kissed Derek, and the little thrill that came with it, the first time he understood what it meant to kiss Derek. \nThe first conversations he\u2019d had with the sheriff, the sense of everything will be alright that came with them. \nRealizing Isaac needed help, and thinking I will be the one to help.\nStiles doesn\u2019t want to go. God, he doesn\u2019t want to go.\nPulling himself up from his place in Derek\u2019s lap, Stiles props himself upright, paws braced on Derek\u2019s shoulders, and licks the side of his face. His head whirls with the movement, but it\u2019s worth it to see a fond smile cross Derek\u2019s face. \nCan we go outside? Stiles asks. He\u2019s had enough of stuffy rooms that stink of sorrow. \n\u201cYeah.\u201d Derek stands, holding Stiles against his shoulder. \u201cStiles wants to go outside,\u201d he tells the sheriff, who nods and follows Isaac and Derek out the back door.\nThey settle down underneath one of the big pines in the backyard, Derek\u2019s back to the trunk, Stiles\u2019 back to Derek\u2019s stomach. The sheriff sits to Derek\u2019s left, and puts a hand over one of Stiles\u2019 paws, while Isaac situates himself to the right, with a thumb stroking slowly over Stiles\u2019 tail. It\u2019s like they\u2019re posing for a family portrait or something, and that makes Stiles unbearably sad. \nThe sheriff, of all people, breaks the silence with a series of dry disbelieving chuckles.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says to Derek and Isaac\u2019s dubious faces, \u201cI was just... taking it all in.\u201d\nDerek and Isaac nod. Stiles bats his paw over the sheriff\u2019s hand. The sheriff raises an eyebrow at it. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. Son, a month ago, I would have guessed maybe drugs, not secretly a fox. Now I\u2019m entangled in some sort of paranormal drama.\u201d\n\nBut everything turned out better than expected, eh dad? At least I\u2019m not selling meth?\n\nDerek relays the message, word for word, and the corner of the sheriff\u2019s mouth twitches up. \u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any to tell you you don\u2019t actually have to call me dad whenever I say son.\u201d\n\nI know. \n\nClearing his throat, Derek tells the sheriff, \u201che knows.\u201d\nThe sheriff sniffs suddenly, eyes blinking rapidly. \u201cGood lord, this is going to be a tough day.\u201d\nAs always, the sheriff is right. Stiles starts coughing up blood not long after their talk. It burns his throat, and makes his mouth taste bad. Derek sends Isaac for a bowl of water, which he dutifully fetches. \nSetting the bowl down in front of Stiles, Isaac asks softly, \u201cwho am I supposed to bug about proper cooking now?\u201d\nDerek, Stiles replies, trying to muster up the strength to lift his head enough to reach the water bowl.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not as much fun, he\u2019ll just growl at me.\u201d\n\nGrowling makes him happy. You wouldn\u2019t take that away from him, would you?\n\nNoticing Stiles\u2019 distress, Isaac gently reaches under Stiles\u2019 shoulders, pulling him close enough to lower his head into the water bowl, lapping up the clear liquid. It feels glacial on his tongue. The fever talking, probably. \nBy mid-afternoon, Stiles can barely move, and he\u2019s starting to feel very very tired. He can practically hear the last few grains of sand moving through his metaphorical hourglass. \nDerek, he calls. Derek\u2019s around here somewhere, isn\u2019t he?\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \nOh, Derek\u2019s all around. That\u2019s what. What is. Happening. \n\nYou... I am tired. \n\nSomething wet falls onto Stiles\u2019 face. Stiles wonders if it steams from the heat of his skin. \n\u201cHang on for just a little longer, Stiles. Please.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t say no to you.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re confusing me with you,\u201d Derek remarks wryly, rubbing a thumb over the bridge of Stiles\u2019 snout. \n\nI love you. \n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Derek replies immediately. It might be the first time he\u2019s said it in front of other people, but Stiles is confusing firsts and lasts, and everything with everything else. He\u2019s just too hot. \n\nTilt my head up. \n\n Careful fingers tuck under Stiles\u2019 chin and life upwards so Stiles can see Derek\u2019s face. \n\nSmile for me. \n\nDerek does. It isn\u2019t the best of his smiles, but Stiles can\u2019t fault him for trying. \nYou have to keep doing that okay? Stiles insists, because this, this is important. Because, because you have people. You have to smile for Isaac and the sheriff.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says softly. His hands are so soft on Stiles\u2019 fur, they hold him like a cradle. Derek is lying. \n Derek isn\u2019t going to smile, Stiles realizes, he isn\u2019t even going to try. \nThat will not stand. \nIsaac has his arms crossed over his chest, already retreating into himself. The sheriff\u2019s eyes are on the ground, his brow furrowed. He\u2019s trying so hard to be stoic. \nThis will not stand. \nStiles wants them to be alright. He wants them to be happy. He wants to watch them be happy, be there to struggle through the confusions of humanity with them. They taught him how to be human, it\u2019s only fair. \nStiles would give anything to be human right now. He may have been born a fox, and he may always be a bit fox, but he does not want to die one. \n(For the sake of bowling with the sheriff, and talking to Isaac when he\u2019s feeling quiet, for mornings waking up next to Derek, for doing what he\u2019s afraid of, for learning, for loving.)\nHe does not want to die a fox. \nHe will not. \n\u201cWhat- what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u201cI don- holy-\u201d\n\u201cGive him space, give him space!\u201d\nEverything is pink, which Stiles was not expecting. Pink dust, flying everywhere, shimmering when it catches in the sunlight, and stinking like magic. It\u2019s coming from his pores, out of his mouth, his ears, his eyes. Everything is magic, and Stiles is drowning in it, he is being broken down into his composite parts and put together anew.\nXXXXX\nIt clears his mouth first, and he gasps, breathes in the air, clear and sweet, smelling like the forest and his pack. Then his ears are free, and he can hear the overlapping murmurs of the pack, caught up in fear and excitement. Then his eyes are free, and he can see his hands, pale and five-fingered, splayed across the grass below. \nHe remembers, long ago, (just after he was first doused in glimmering pink dust in Deaton\u2019s office,) how easy it had been to turn his little black tipped paws into human hands, like they had been secreted away underneath his skin the whole time, just waiting to be freed. \nHe can\u2019t go back, he\u2019s sure of it. A choice was made, a pact between Stiles and the magic in exchange for a small miracle. One that didn\u2019t come cheap. \nStiles has been cut off at the roots, the earliest, most original part of him taken away.\nYet, looking around at Derek, Isaac, and the sheriff, each staring at him in shock, Stiles cannot regret his choice. He would make it again, and again, and again for them. \nDerek has the strangest expression on his face, like he isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s seeing is real. Stiles knows just what to do about that.\n\u201cHey Derek, what do I smell like?\u201d\nDerek blinks in shock, then inhales. Then his face cracks open into a wide grin. A real one. One that Stiles wouldn\u2019t see erased for anything.\n\u201cStiles. You smell like Stiles.\u201d"
