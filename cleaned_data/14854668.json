Is one nipple always perky from the cold and the other one is normal. Is that the real reason he froze himself. So his nipples would match. Dial 1800 to place your vote. </p>\n<p>i should really go to bed</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>hi i'm on some really gnarly meds that wont let me sleep and it's been three days so I think my sense of humour\u2019s abandoned all logic so if this is bad then i'm sorry??? I really am but my grip on the waking world was tenuous at best and now i genuinely feel like a balloon only barely attached to my head so please forgive me just this once</p>\n<p>due to last chapter's poll my eyes have been opened not only to the details of icyhot's icyhot nipnops, but to the idea that the carpet matches the drapes, which i will go so far as to extend to the rest of his body. leg hair, arm hair, underarm hair....half and half, baby.</p>\n<p>this week i ask: of the 1A boys, who's gonna be the first to lose their v-card? </p>\n<p>AU in which someone (probably kirishima) figures out that Bakugou's a lot less cranky after getting dicked down, so whenever he starts acting up somebody hauls him off to fuck him quiet</p>\n<p>todoroki keeps accusing him of being pissy just because he wont admit he wants to fuck<br>bakudeku hate sex<br>bakugou enjoying himself immensely until he figures out that a) pretending to be cranky doesnt work with iida because iida just gives him a stress ball, which is a problem because b) iida has a size 12 shoe</p>\n<p>The Adventures of Bakuhoe.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>JustAPassingStranger: Can you imagine lida trying to stop midoriya by standing in front of him so he cant go past.. and midoriya... just??

Because i can and the image has cleaned my soul and mowed the lawn</p>\n<p>a little wholesome content this time.</p>\n<p>mcdonalds features a lot in this fic. partly that's because i find the image of deku with happy meals hilarious, but also because there's a mcdonalds near my old high school and we used to go there to hang out when we saved up enough money. it was also the only place that would deliver to us after class lol. i passed a lot of my high school life with shitty burgers and not-shitty friends. mcdonalds is nostalgic for me, so i write about it here too.</p>\n<p>a dear friend of mine told me she made friends with a boy in college who spent a lot of time with her and frequently complained that the girl he liked only thought of him as a friend:</p>\n<p>her: you should tell her how you feel! be honest so she can give you a proper answer<br>him: how?<br>her: well i think you should just come out and say it. tell her 'i like you'.<br>him: okay. i like you.<br>her: yeah! just like that!</p>\n<p>so if you're judging deku for being the way he is, just know there are people like this who exist.</p>\n<p>i just love to imagine todoroki being a Rich Bitch when it comes to bakugou.....oh you have new nikes? yeah i didn't like the feel of the new jordans so i bought 50% of the company and asked them to change the design,,,,,, but let's be real i'm sure todoroki probably owns and lives in at least 3 pairs of crocs</p>\n<p>anyway i think there's one chapter left! maybe two if i think of something else to write. see y'all next time!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://dailykrumbs.tumblr.com/post/176874493531/kacchans-part-time-this-was-based-of-an-old-joke\" rel=\"nofollow\">coffee or tea?</a>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>things that make my dog happy:</p>\n<p>- human friends<br>- chicken<br>- car rides<br>- when you refill her water bowl just when she was getting thirsty<br>- walks<br>- my blanket<br>- digging up the plants and then acting sad when you call her a bad dog but then doing it again the next day<br>- butt scratches<br>- that fat old dog down the street<br>- when you shake the broom at her and say 'rrrrr'</p>\n<p>ambition pushes you to do great things, but recently i've been learning that it's nice to love little things too.</p>\n<p>anyway, here's the end to a slightly crazy fic. i don't really have any favoured pairings in bnha, so the conclusion was kind of decided on a whim haha. thank you so much for reading this far (some even from the very beginning!) and especially thank you to the people who took time out of their day to leave a comment. seeing a familiar username makes me feel like i'm getting to know you a little bit, even though i don't know what you look like. writing this has been a blast so thanks for letting me talk nonsense and bully iida.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>you might see me around sometime, i don't know. maybe the adventures of Bakuhoe will speak to me.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>surprise! bet you thought you'd seen the last of me lol</p>\n<p>uhm, sorry for the sudden addition. a lot of people mentioned that they expected this to go down the todobakudeku route. most people were really nice about it, and i thought it was an interesting idea so i decided to try writing that version to see how it would go. i know this addition is kind of pointless, but i'm amused that it's kind of like a visual novel. ch7 is how i originally planned it to go but i guess you can choose whichever one you like better. </p>\n<p>please don't take this as serious shipping fic, though. first and foremost this was a silly story i made up to make some people laugh. the pairings are just for fun. i dont actually have any ships (in bnha or in general) so don't think too hard about it! i was just hoping this update would be an interesting take on how the fic could have gone. i hope you don't mind the lack of definitive ending. </p>\n<p>leave a comment if you like! at the time of writing i haven't actually replied to last chapter's comments but i'll get to that soon. </p>\n<p>ok see you guys i should probably go to bed lol have a good week!</p>\n<p>EDIT: i made a twitter! come say hi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/supercrunched\" rel=\"nofollow\">right here!</a></p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>three years. three years this has been bothering me. over time it faded to the back of my mind but some nights i snap awake and wonder 'what if'. what if i'd properly leaned into the visual novel element. what if i'd done better foreshadowing so i could explore all the pairing options i wanted. what if we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars. my questions have mostly been answered. i've finished the wretched work i set myself all that time ago. </p>\n<p>i can finally rest in peace.</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThose two are acting kinda weird,\u201d Midoriya says, a spoonful of rapidly-cooling curry rice halfway to his lips.\nTenya looks over his shoulder. Bakugou and Todoroki appear to be engaged in a wrestling match, right there in the middle of the cafeteria. Or an attempted homicide, maybe. Bakugou has his hands wrapped around Todoroki\u2019s throat, grip admirably tight even though he\u2019s being repeatedly kicked in the ribs. Neither of them seem to have made it to the actual food.\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure that qualifies as weird,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cWeird  objectively, yes, but not weird specifically for them.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what they\u2019re fighting about now,\u201d Uraraka adds from where she\u2019s sitting on Midoriya\u2019s right. Slyly, she steals the banana pudding cup off of Midoriya\u2019s tray, replacing it with half her portion of tonkatsu. Midoriya doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cMust be something good. It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve gotten into an actual fist fight, it\u2019s kind of refreshing.\u201d\nTenya begs to differ. Seeing two top students from a prestigious school making a spectacle of themselves is both distasteful and alarming, and the only reason he\u2019s not going over there to break the fight up is because this is the third time it\u2019s happened this month. And also because he doesn\u2019t want Bakugou to bite him again. \u201cIt\u2019s unsightly.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fun to watch. Like having lunch and a show!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange?\u201d Midoriya turns to Tenya, spoon still hovering in front of his face but, unfortunately, forgotten. Uraraka takes a cherry tomato off his plate while he isn\u2019t looking. \u201cWell, maybe not for Kacchan, but since when do you see Todoroki get this riled up about  anything?\u201d \n\u201cYesterday,\u201d says Tenya. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t finish your soda, and Todoroki and Bakugou argued over who got to have it. Bakugou would have flipped a table if Aizawa hadn\u2019t come into homeroom and made you throw it away.\u201d\n\u201cI think they\u2019re fighting about chairs,\u201d Uraraka says, squinting at the disaster from afar. The tables around the two have long since vacated, bystanders preferring to watch the impromptu match from a distance. Bakugou\u2019s got Todoroki in a headlock, now, and Todoroki appears to be trying to suplex him. \u201cLike, my lip-reading\u2019s not the best, but that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d\n\u201cSee?\u201d Midoriya gestures helplessly with his curry rice. \u201cWhy would anybody fight over  chairs? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s not enough seating space. The cafeteria\u2019s huge, this doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nTenya purses his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t say either of them made any sense to begin with, but I suppose it  is  odd for Todoroki to be acting so\u2026Bakugou-esque.\u201d\nUraraka\u2019s eyes sparkle as she leans forward to watch. Her hair almost falls into her leftover curry, and Tenya absently reaches across the table to brush it away. \u201cThey\u2019re laying claim to their territory! Establishing dominance! Each trying their best to be the alpha male!\u201d\nTenya considers informing her that they\u2019re not wild animals, but decides that she may not be wrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that they\u2019re fighting about chairs. They could be fighting about anything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, they fight about  everything  ,\u201d Midoriya says. His spoon finally makes it to its destination, even though it\u2019s no doubt cold by now. Eyebrows furrowed like he\u2019s deep in contemplation, he chews his food and hums. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Todoroki act like that. And as angry as Kacchan is all the time, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him  assault  anyone. Except, y\u2019know, me. But that\u2019s in the past, he\u2019s nice to me now. Kinda. I\u2019d have thought he\u2019s calmed down a little, right?\u201d\n\u201cHe clearly hasn\u2019t,\u201d Tenya says, watching Uraraka scrape the bottom of her dishonestly-gained pudding. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019s even more of a menace than he was at the start of the year. His aggression hasn\u2019t faded, it\u2019s just been redirected.\u201d\n\u201cBut  only towards Todoroki,\u201d Midoriya says. He\u2019s muttering it under his breath, almost, so much so that Tenya has to lean close to hear him. \u201cAnd Todoroki\u2019s retaliating. They obviously bring something out in each other.\u201d\n\u201cMurder?\u201d\n\u201cSpirit. A  spark.\u201d \n\u201cAn explosion, maybe,\u201d says Tenya unhappily. \u201cMidoriya, you\u2019ve got that look you always have whenever you\u2019re about to do something ill-advised. Should I be worried?\u201d\nMidoriya flaps a hand at him as though there weren\u2019t legitimate reason for Tenya to be concerned. \u201cWhen do I ever do anything ill-advised?\u201d\n\u201cWhat  are  you gonna do?\u201d Uraraka chimes in right before Tenya can bring out a bulleted list of all the ridiculous things Midoriya has ever done.  Goading Todoroki into using his fire powers and then getting both arms broken  is around the top, along with  association with Bakugou in general . \u201cThis is a little different from the usual villain problem. Punching stuff won\u2019t help, probably.\u201d\nTapping his spoon against his mouth, Midoriya shrugs and goes back to his lunch. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to punch them, they\u2019re already punching each other. I just think they\u2019re acting out of character,\u201d he says, and then blinks. \u201cWhere\u2019d my pudding go?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d Uraraka says suddenly, putting her arm around Midoriya\u2019s shoulders and making him turn slightly pink. \u201cUnravel the mystery, Izuku, you can do it!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mystery to unravel,\u201d Tenya says, feeling like a mother scolding her troublesome and perpetually sticky young children. \u201cBakugou and Todoroki are only behaving how they always behave. Don\u2019t go meddling, Midoriya, you know how you get when you fixate on something.\u201d\nMidoriya and Uraraka wrinkle their noses at him in unison. It\u2019s unbearably cute, but Tenya manages not to shield his eyes in an obvious fashion. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t gonna do anything crazy,\u201d says Midoriya irritably. Tries to, anyway; on him it just sounds petulant. \u201cRelax, I\u2019m not  completely  dumb.\u201d\n\u201cAnything involving Bakugou is sure to cause trouble,\u201d Tenya replies. Somewhere in the background, Todoroki stabs Bakugou with a plastic fork. \u201cBakugou, Todoroki and you together sound like  disaster.\u201d \n\u201cI think that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration,\u201d Uraraka says, forgetting for the moment that Tenya generally tends to be right about these things.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku, predictably, doesn\u2019t listen.\nNot  obviously,  of course. He\u2019s only watching. And thinking. Iida can\u2019t nag at him for  thinking, seeing as that\u2019s literally what he keeps saying everyone needs to do more often.\nAnyway. Present Mic is saying something about past participles that Izuku can\u2019t really find it in himself to pay attention to, not when Kacchan is sitting right in front of him, the little hair whorl at the back of his head hypnotizing in its spiraly-ness. Izuku can see Kacchan\u2019s laser-focused expression in the reflection of the window. He\u2019s always been good at English. Had even offered to tutor Izuku once, although he\u2019d managed to make it sound more like an insult than an act of kindness.\nIzuku had declined, of course, because he has  some survival instinct, no matter what Iida says. He doesn\u2019t really trust Kacchan around his notebooks anymore, anyway, even if he\u2019d never dare say that out loud.\nBut the offer was weird. Kacchan\u2019s  behaviour  is weird. He keeps  doing  things. For Izuku, specifically, even though he makes sure to complain about it endlessly. \u00a0He\u2019d bought him a lollipop yesterday. And keeps holding doors open, and he insists on carrying Izuku\u2019s bag on the way to school, which makes no sense considering Izuku has, you know.  A strengthening  quirk.\nKacchan highlights something in his textbook and taps his pen against his desk. He has a lot of trouble sitting still, this guy. Has ever since they were little kids, back when Kacchan would come barreling into Izuku\u2019s house every afternoon demanding they go on some crazy toddler adventure. He\u2019d tried to do things for Izuku back then too, little things that Izuku had trouble doing himself. Tying his shoelaces. Opening juice boxes. Remembering the way home from the playground.\nAnd then that had turned into unpleasantness, until even that just\u2026stopped.\nThe thing is, though, Izuku can remember when Kacchan stopped talking to him. Being rescued from that sludge monster by a loser like Izuku had bruised his pride and he\u2019d cut himself off, which sort of made sense, in a weird Kacchan way.\nBut the  favours . The favours are inexplicable, and more than a little suspicious. He might be trying to form a truce, or he might be trying lull Izuku into a false sense of security so he can break into his house and steal his kidneys.\nIt\u2019s, well. Sort of nice. The truce, not the kidney-stealing. By no means are they friends, but it\u2019s good to know that they can hold a civil conversation without beating the shit out of each other. Or Kacchan beating the shit out of Izuku, anyway.\nSpeaking of which. Kacchan\u2019s caught Izuku\u2019s eye in the reflection of the window, and he\u2019s staring right back.\nIzuku flinches and whips his gaze back to the blackboard. Kacchan\u2019s still looking at him and it actually feels like there are pinpricks poking into the side of his skull, because Kacchan is obviously the one person in the universe capable of glaring literal daggers instead of metaphorical ones. He doesn\u2019t seem  too  angry, though. Mostly he just looks confused, unsure whether or not to maintain eye contact when Izuku surreptitiously glances back the window\u2019s direction.\n Smooth, Izuku.  Taking a deep breath, Izuku tries his level best to melt off his chair and into the cracks between the tiles, except Kacchan\u2019s sort of right in front of him and he\u2019s still  watching  him, god help him. This is it. This is the end of their fledgling friendship, and also maybe the end of Izuku\u2019s life. Kacchan\u2019s going to punch him after class. Izuku should really text his mother now to tell her he loves her.\nHe risks another glance. Kacchan\u2019s looking over his shoulder but not at Izuku, thank the Buddha. Instead he\u2019s\u2026smiling? Smirking, more like, at some corner of the classroom. He looks really smug, although that might just be Kacchan\u2019s face and wow Izuku should really stop staring before Kacchan catches him again, just, just  turn around, Izuku, for god\u2019s sake.\nWho\u2019s Kacchan looking at, anyway? Sneakily (he hopes), Izuku follows his gaze to the very back of the classroom.\n Oh. Todoroki. Right.\nThere\u2019s the other part of the puzzle. Kacchan\u2019s got a real problem with Todoroki lately, but nobody knows  why. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve had a big fight, or anything. They just bicker a lot and occasionally scuffle. He\u2019d kind of assumed it would be a natural consequence on Kacchan\u2019s part, after what happened at the tournament, but Todoroki doesn\u2019t seem like the type to hold a grudge.\nNot that Izuku would really know. Todoroki mainly keeps to himself, even if he can be a pretty good conversationalist. Izuku doesn\u2019t have a lifetime of experience with Todoroki, so it\u2019s understandably a little harder to figure out what makes him tick. Daddy issues, probably. An odd sense of humour, and an unhealthy appreciation for cola. Who answers  cola  when someone asks about his favourite food anyway? Who, for that matter, gets into an argument over who gets to finish someone else\u2019s leftover Pepsi?\nTodoroki, that\u2019s who. And Kacchan, but Kacchan could get into an argument about anything.\nMaybe they get along in that respect, Izuku thinks, resting his chin in his palm and letting his thoughts wander. They\u2019re both competitive and absurdly talented, and they\u2019ve already proven to be a good match in terms of skill. Hell, they could even be  friends if they\u2019d just stop acting like children.\nThe sunlight streaming through the classroom window makes Kacchan\u2019s blond hair glow angelically, even though he\u2019s hunched over his desk like a gargoyle. He keeps sneaking glances at Todoroki, clearly willing him to look around. Slowly, he tears a bit of paper out of his notebook and crumples it into a ball, tossing it in Todoroki\u2019s direction when Present Mic\u2019s back is turned. It sails across the class like a mini grenade and bounces off the side of Todoroki\u2019s head. Todoroki looks up, eyes narrowed like a testy housecat, and Kacchan flips him the bird.\nIzuku sighs. They fight so often it wouldn\u2019t even surprise him if they  enjoyed it. Maybe this is their way of bonding. Like pigtail-pulling, only bloodier.\nAlmost like schoolyard kids with a crush.\n\u2026wait.\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Izuku. \u201c Oh.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d says Kacchan, which, yeah, okay, that\u2019s fair because Izuku kind of  is  standing up in the middle of class for no good reason while Present Mic is trying to teach.\n\u201cUhm,\u201d says Izuku, because that\u2019s better than saying  I know you have a crush on Todoroki. \nPresent Mic clears his throat. Izuku supposes it\u2019s meant to be a polite way of attracting attention, but given that this is Present Mic, it sounds like someone is hacking a spitwad directly into his ear. \u201cDid you have something to share with the class, Midoriya?\u201d\nIzuku thinks about his life choices. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026very passionate about this topic.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says Present Mic dryly. He waves a piece of chalk in Izuku\u2019s direction, and Izuku takes this as permission to sit down. Or to maybe take a flying leap out the window, except that would mean sidling past Kacchan and he\u2019d kind of rather not do that right now. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that when I\u2019m assigning you homework for today. Now open your textbooks to chapter thirty-six, we\u2019re going to be doing the exercises on the second-to-last page.\u201d\nForget chapter thirty-six. Izuku\u2019s fine with melting into the tiles and staring at the back of Kacchan\u2019s head after all, even if it means a less than stellar grade. Kacchan\u2019s staring at his reflection in the window. Todoroki\u2019s staring at him too, probably, because Izuku can feel the hairs rise on the back of his neck. Damn it, why are they so in sync?\nHe knows why. He knows because these two are a sad combination of  emotionally constipated  and  really obvious, and it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019s going to be the only one who knows for a long time because it\u2019s not like either of these boys are in a position to sit down and talk about their feelings like adults.\nUnless they\u2019re already dating. Which would be kind of bizarre.\nProbably not. Izuku may not know a lot about romance, but he\u2019s never seen a pair of lovers look at each other like  that. Kacchan seems like he kind of wants to pin Todoroki down and do terrible things to him, except not in the fun way. The distinctly not-fun way. The way that results in broken bones and too many trips to the hospital.\nExcept it  could  be in the fun way, maybe, if they\u2019d get over themselves and admit it.\nThe sooner the better, too. The mental image is starting to make Izuku a little uncomfortable.\nHesitantly, he reaches into his backpack and tugs out a yellow notebook. It\u2019s new, one of those 100-yen ones that he\u2019d never got around to using, and he\u2019s been wondering what to do with it for a while.\nWell. This is  kind of like hero observation, right?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve figured it out,\u201d says Midoriya, brandishing a bright yellow notebook as he comes running over to the front of the class.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d says Iida.\nOchako shushes him. Midorya\u2019s expression is focused and bright, words tumbling over themselves in an effort to be heard instead of trying to disappear back down his throat. He doesn\u2019t stutter, and Ochako puts her hands in her lap and gives him the most encouraging smile she has in her arsenal. \u201cWhat did you figure out?\u201d\n\u201cWhy they\u2019re fighting so often \u2013 Kacchan and Todoroki, I mean, it\u2019s because they have, well, that\u2019s \u2013 ah.\u201d He cuts himself off suddenly, peeking over his shoulder to check for eavesdroppers. Nobody appears to listening in, but he drops his voice to a whisper anyway, flipping open his notebook for Ochako and Iida to look at. \u201cSee? There\u2019s something going on between them.\u201d\nIida squints, adjusting his glasses like that\u2019s going to make Midoriya\u2019s chicken scrawl any more discernible. \u201c Stunted emotional development ,\u201d he reads aloud, and then frowns. \u201cI think anyone could have told you that.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Midoriya gestures vaguely and flips a few more pages. His freckles are more noticeable than they were at the start of the year, because it\u2019s getting so hot out recently. \u201cI meant it might explain their lack of communication, since \u2013 okay, look, you know that dumb thing kids do sometimes when they like someone? Picking fights and stuff?\u201d\nOchako taps a finger against her chin. \u201cLike bullying for attention, you mean?\u201d\n\u201cExactly! And Kacchan\u2019s, well, no offense, he  is  kind of a bully. I don\u2019t think he knows how to, uh,\u201d Midoriya wrings his free hand, clearly unwilling to speak bluntly even about the boy who\u2019s been tormenting him for the past ten years. Bakugou doesn\u2019t deserve Midoriya in his life, honestly. \u201cKacchan doesn\u2019t really understand how to communicate with people in a healthy way,\u201d he finally settles on. \u201cLike, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s actually good friends with Kirishima, but he keeps making fun of him, you know?\u201d\n\u201cSo you think Bakugou wants to befriend Todoroki, but doesn\u2019t know how?\u201d Iida says.\n\u201cIactuallymaybesortofthinkit\u2019sacrush.\u201d\nMost of the other students have filed out of the classroom by now. Aizawa\u2019s long-gone, seeing as he never spends more time around his students than he absolutely has to. Bakugou and Todoroki had both milled around for a bit, glancing once or twice in the trio\u2019s direction, but even they had wandered off after a few minutes. The only ones left are Shouji and Kouda, and they\u2019re already halfway out the door.\nOchako is glad for this, because the noise Iida makes is probably loud enough to qualify him as the new Present Mic.\n\u201cWhat do you  mean  a crush\u2014\u201d he manages right before Ochako can slap a hand over his mouth. He continues trying to speak, even though it\u2019s muffled, and the sensation against her palm makes her grimace. \u201cMmph!  Hmmph! \u201d\nPoor Midoriya\u2019s curled in on himself, notebook held protectively in front of his face and eyes peeking out over the top. Ochako turns her pained expression into a smile. \u201cOh? What makes you say that?\u201d\nMidoriya clears his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hunch,\u201d he says quietly, relaxing slightly when Iida stops his inarticulate protests. Ochako releases him, and Midoriya continues. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Kacchan\u2019s been acting weird lately? I mean, he\u2019s being  nice  to me. Or trying to, he still yells at me sometimes, but he hasn\u2019t told me to kill myself in, like, a month. And right before that happened, he started fighting with Todoroki. Almost right after the sports festival, in fact, when they both sparred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how does that connect to Bakugou having a,\u201d Ochako stops. She can\u2019t bring herself to say it. \u201cTo having feelings?\u201d\n\u201cI  think,\u201d Midoriya says, voice gaining a little confidence, \u201cthat Kacchan\u2019s never really felt challenged before. So when he fought Todoroki, he might, have, uhm, well, gotten attached. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend, so I\u2019m guessing the aggression is kind of his way of getting Todoroki to notice him.\u201d\nIida looks a little lost. \u201cAnd what does that have to do with you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s probably just because I\u2019m friends with Todoroki,\u201d Midoriya says flippantly. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think Todoroki\u2019s the type of guy to date his friend\u2019s bully, you know? So Kacchan kind of has to be nicer to me if he wants Todoroki to like him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014Midoriya,\u201d Iida says patiently, like he\u2019s talking to a well-meaning puppy who doesn\u2019t understand that humans don\u2019t like dog treats in their cereal. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re reaching? Just a little bit? Looking for meaning in places where it doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\u201cI think what Iida\u2019s trying to say,\u201d Ochako interrupts, \u201cis that maybe you\u2019re reading too much into it. How do you know for sure that\u2019s how Bakugou feels? Given that he\u2019s mean to  everyone , I\u2019m saying.\u201d\nMidoriya considers this. \u201cI think,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cthe key is that he really does pay a lot of attention to Todoroki. I mean, back in middle school, Kacchan used to keep to himself most of the time. When he wasn\u2019t picking on me, anyway. Now he\u2019s got more friends, granted, but don\u2019t you think he\u2019s been fixated on Todoroki lately? And being more aggressive with him than he is with anyone else?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that just mean he hates him?\u201d Iida asks.\n\u201cYeah, I thought so too, but they\u2019re together, like, every time I look at them. I mean it. Like, Todoroki\u2019ll be coming over to me to chat, right, and Kacchan just barges in and picks a fight. Or, Todoroki\u2019ll say he wants to have lunch together, and then Kacchan\u2019ll show up out of nowhere and drag him away. It\u2019s almost like he thinks he has to protect Todoroki from me, or something.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got it the wrong way around,\u201d Iida starts to say.\nOchako slaps a hand over his mouth for the second time that day. \u201cI think Iida\u2019s  trying  to say,\u201d she says, also for the second time that day, \u201cis that that\u2019s a really stunning observation, Midoriya! I wouldn\u2019t have expected anything less!\u201d\nIida squints at her over the hand covering half his face.  That\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to say at all, says his expression.\n Oh, I know, Ochako smiles back beatifically. \u201cSo what are you planning to do?\u201d\nMidoriya takes another look at his yellow notebook, mouth curved up into a pleased little smile as he peruses his hasty notes. \u201cI think that Kacchan could use some help. And I  know  you guys said not to meddle too much, but I promise I won\u2019t get super involved. Maybe the two of them just need a little push in the right direction.\u201d\n\u201cOff a cliff, maybe,\u201d says Ochako.\nIida manages to pull his face away from Ochako\u2019s hand, and he speaks before she can shush him again. \u201c Why?  Even  if  Bakugou likes Todoroki that way, why do you suddenly want to play matchmaker?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone deserves to be happy, even Kacchan,\u201d Midoriya says absently. \u201cBesides, it might make him a little nicer to be around. Todoroki\u2019s been a positive influence on him, at least where I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki\u2019s just as guilty as Bakugou!\u201d Iida sputters. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who starts half the fights!\u201d\nOchako pats his arm. \u201cWell, look at it this way. If Deku-kun\u2019s right, then getting them together should settle them down quite a bit.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Iida says immediately.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d Humming thoughtfully, Midoriya jots something down in his notebook and closes it with a decisive  snap. Stuffing it into his backpack, he shoulders it and shimmies his way between their desks to get to the door. \u201cAlright. I\u2019m going to start planning this as soon as I get my homework out of the way. Man, this is going to go great!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOchako watches him go fondly. So young, so pure . \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s having fun.\u201d\nIida stares at her. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cEncourage him! I\u2019m all for getting the two troublemakers to settle down, but let\u2019s be serious,\u201d Iida says, pushing his glasses back up the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe all know Bakugou\u2019s crush isn\u2019t on  Todoroki.\u201d \n\u201cWell, Midoriya\u2019s probably too humble for his own good,\u201d Ochako agrees. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s better like this.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it makes him happy,\u201d Ochako says, gathering her things and packing them haphazardly into her new orange backpack. Iida\u2019s stuff is already in his satchel, slung over his shoulder and ready to go. She leaves the classroom, and he follows. \u201cI mean, you know how much he likes helping people.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Iida frowns, footsteps echoing a little as they walk down the empty corridor together. \u201cI just don\u2019t want this whole situation to bring him unnecessary grief. Midoriya attracts trouble, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he has us!\u201d Ochako chirrups. \u201cIf either of those guys gives him any trouble, I\u2019ll float them up to the ceiling and leave them there for an hour, that\u2019ll teach \u2018em.\u201d\nIida gives her a crooked smile despite himself. The doors to the main entrance of the school slide open noiselessly for them, and Ochako squints in the afternoon sunlight with a smile of her own. \u201cYour methods seem a little Draconian, Uraraka.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Skipping over a crack in the pavement, Ochako waves goodbye as she and Iida part ways; Iida lives fairly close to the city centre, but Ochako\u2019s own place is a little closer to the edge of town. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ruin his plans, Iida, I\u2019m not afraid to float you to the ceiling too.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you,\u201d Iida calls to her retreating back. \u201cBut I still think this is more trouble than it\u2019s worth!\u201d\nOchako begs to differ. Whistling tunelessly as she goes, she adjusts the straps of her backpack and makes her way to the train station. Her travel card jingles against her keychain as she tugs it out of her blazer pocket, and a woman\u2019s soothing voice sounds over the intercom as she waits for the next train home.\nThat\u2019s not all of it, anyway. Ochako doesn\u2019t care how nice Bakugou\u2019s trying to be; there\u2019s no way in  hell  he\u2019s getting his hands on poor Midoriya. And, well. She wouldn\u2019t really wish Bakugou on anyone, but she supposes Todoroki might as well have him.\nShe grins and gets on the train.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you like to have lunch with me today?\u201d Izuku asks as non-threateningly as he can.\nKacchan stares at him. Really stares, which makes sweat bead at the back of Izuku\u2019s neck, and then turns to look over his shoulder as if Izuku would be this nervous about asking to hang out with someone else. Nobody\u2019s behind him. Class hasn\u2019t started yet, so everyone\u2019s still milling around and chatting in their cliques. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cLunch. With me. Today,\u201d says Izuku intelligently.\nKacchan continues staring. He doesn\u2019t immediately strangle him, though, which Izuku takes as a plus. \u201cUh. Yeah, whatever.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d says Izuku with probably more cheer than necessary because at this point he\u2019s just glad to be alive. \u201cI have to see, uhm, Present Mic for a little bit first, though. About yesterday\u2019s homework. Maybe you can wait for me at the cafeteria?\u201d\nKacchan snorts, which should be inelegant but somehow still sounds kind of intimidating. \u201cGrammar too hard for you? Give it here, I\u2019ll explain it so your dumb weenie brain can understand.\u201d\n\u201cNo need for that!\u201d Izuku says, maybe a little shrill. Sero gives him the side eye and Izuku tries not to blush. \u201cI mean, uh. I need him to grade last week\u2019s essay, too. I ended up redoing it since I wasn\u2019t happy with the first one.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nerd,\u201d says Kacchan. He doesn\u2019t say it too venomously, though, which must mean he\u2019s in a good mood. \u201cI may as well come with you so I don\u2019t have to wait for your ass.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell I-- I was hoping you could go ahead and save us a seat.\u201d Nice save, Izuku! \u201cElse we won\u2019t get to sit at the big table by the window that you like. You know that one always fills up first.\u201d\nKacchan\u2019s eyebrows go up. \u201cHow did you kn\u2014\u201d he starts, and then stops and clears his throat. \u201cGod, fine, whatever. You have fifteen minutes, don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d Izuku beams. Kacchan rolls his eyes and turns around so he\u2019s facing the front of the class. It\u2019s just about time for Aizawa to come in for homeroom, so Iida\u2019s herding everyone back to their seats, simultaneously delivering his Thursday lecture about the importance of properly sharpened pencils. Kacchan doesn\u2019t try to engage him again so Izuku picks up a (perfectly sharpened) pencil and opens his bag, looking for his trusty yellow dollar-store notebook so he can flip to its most recent page.\n\nAsk Todoroki: check.\n\n\nAsk Kacchan: check (I never want to do that again).\n\nAizawa wanders in about\u00a0five minutes before the bell rings with a pillow under each arm. \u201cI should convert this desk into a bed one day,\u201d he says in lieu of a greeting. \u201cBut I don't feel like going to Ikea. Open your textbooks to whatever page we were on last. Iida?\u201d\n\u201cWhich textbook, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWhichever. Just shut up and read something, all of you, so I can take a nap.\u201d\nIzuku decides to do his English revision, seeing as he did sort of zone out of yesterday\u2019s lesson, and actually ends up getting a decent amount of studying done before the next class. He also manages to focus all the way until lunch, even though his secret notebook greets him with banana-yellow cheer every time he opens his bag.\nHe\u2019s just finishing up some Biology notes when the school bell rings, and Kacchan, on the dot, turns around to tell him to hurry his dumb ass up and not keep him waiting for too long.\n\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d Izuku says sincerely, and then makes a big show of taking his English homework out of its folder. Kacchan nods and saunters off, both hands in his pockets, and someone taps Izuku on the shoulder. He turns.\n\u201cLunch?\u201d says Todoroki hopefully.\nIzuku relaxes immediately. \u201cYes, we\u2019re still on as soon as I\u2019m done at the staff room. You know where to wait, right?\u201d\n\u201cBig table near the window,\u201d Todoroki says obediently. Izuku smiles. \u201cDo you want me to get your food for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. Just save me a seat, I\u2019ll join you later.\u201d\nTodoroki nods. Izuku gently prompts him to go, so he wanders out the door by himself, looking back once as if to make sure that Izuku hasn\u2019t suddenly disappeared. Izuku waves, and Todoroki waves back before retreating into the corridor and hopefully straight to the cafeteria where he\u2019ll eventually complete phase two of Izuku\u2019s incredible master plan.\nIzuku stuffs his homework back into his bag and quietly follows.\nStealth, unfortunately, isn\u2019t really his strong suit, especially after he bumps into Hitoshi who is, for some reason, hanging out beside a locker with a juice box in hand. \u201cHey.\u201d\nIzuku shushes him. \u201cWe\u2019re being discreet.\u201d\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. But I\u2019m trying to make some friends get along.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Are you coming to lunch?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Izuku says, plastered to the wall. \u201cBut in case someone asks, I\u2019m not breaking any rules. Go on without me, I have a mission to see through.\u201d\nThe mission does not involve Present Mic in any way. It does, however, involve blending in with the lunch rush (the students, not the guy) and tailing Kacchan and Todoroki into the cafeteria undetected. He ends up hiding behind a pillar, trying not to feel too self-conscious, too far away to hear what\u2019s going on at the designated table but hopefully close enough to watch the romance unfold.\nKacchan\u2019s already there, unsurprisingly, two portions of fried rice on his tray and expression sour enough to scare away anyone who dares sit next to him. He doesn\u2019t touch his food. The sun glints off the big glass window and he opens it almost absent-mindedly, summer breeze ruffling his hair and making it look softer than it probably is.\nTodoroki arriving on the scene, Izuku jots down on his palm so he can put it in his notebook later. Torodoki is also carrying two plates, and he stops dead when his planned seat turns out to be occupied.\nThis is it, Deku thinks, and holds his breath.\nTodoroki and Kacchan make eye contact. Slowly, and very deliberately, Todoroki sets his tray down.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn hindsight, maybe Izuku should have expected the bloodshed.\nUraraka was right, though. It is pretty entertaining. And the cafeteria table doesn\u2019t so much as crack when Kacchan suplexes Todoroki right onto it, although it is maybe a waste of the four portions of fried rice that end up on the ceiling. The trays turn out to be remarkably sturdy too. Kacchan\u2019s skull is maybe a bit less so, but then again not everyone remains quite so spirited in the face of repeated blunt force trauma.\nIzuku puts his face in his hands. Alright, okay. Maybe he didn\u2019t think this through.\n\"Wow,\" says Hitoshi, chewing on the straw of his juicebox. Izuku didn\u2019t even hear him follow. \"They're really going at it. D'you think they'll die this time?\"\n\"If they kill each other, Iida will kill me,\"\u00a0Izuku says.\n\"That would be a shame.\"\n\"Debatable.\" Taking a deep breath,\u00a0Izuku sidles out from behind the safety of his pillar, squeezing his way through the crowd of onlookers and stepping into the carnage against his better judgement. \u201cGuys? Uh, guys? Do you want to, uh, maybe consider, like,\u00a0not\u00a0crippling each other? Just a thought?\u201d\nThey pause. Kacchan is trying to give Todoroki a wedgie and Todoroki is just about to elbow Kacchan in the groin. \u201cDeku, where the fuck have you been?\u201d\n\u201cI told you I would be late,\u201d Izuku says weakly. \u201cI was hoping you wouldn\u2019t kill each other in the meantime.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were having lunch with me,\u201d Todoroki says. Izuku tries not to look at the raw betrayal on his face.\n\u201cYeah, what gives, Deku?\u201d Kacchan snarls. \u201cYou said lunch. You didn\u2019t say you were inviting the discount Harvey Dent.\u201d\n\u201cIzuku likes spending time with me, you belligerent dandelion.\u201d\n\u201cTry saying that again with my foot in your mouth\u2014,\u201d\n\u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t working,\u201d says Izuku, wringing his hands. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t fight. Kacchan, don\u2019t put your foot in Todoroki\u2019s mouth. He\u2019s my friend, I\u2019d like him alive.\u201d\nKacchan sneers. \u201cOh sure, I forgot he was extra special\u00a0to you. I'll be real nice to him, okay? I'll only maim him a little bit.\u201d\nJesus. Kacchan was fine in class, but the spite in his voice makes the crowd of onlookers take a collective step back. The hand not attempting to injure Todoroki is balled into a tight fist which Izuku\u2019s almost afraid might explode; he's genuinely angry the way he hasn't been since they were in middle school and Izuku first dared to call himself a potential hero.\nIzuku blinks. And then revelation hits him like All Might\u2019s fist to the face.\n\nOh my god, he\u2019s jealous.\n\n\u201cY-yes!\u201d Izuku says, grasping at the single thread and pulling. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right, Todoroki is my friend. Isn\u2019t that right, Todoroki?\u201d\nTodoroki looks a little lost. \u201cIzuku?\u201d\nKacchan\u2019s face has slackened. Picking up steam, Izuku gestures with his hands, face breaking out in a sincere, if slightly panicked, smile. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re one of my best buddies, yeah?\" he continues, not so much pushing buttons as he is slamming his hands on the controls and hoping something lights up. \"You're a great guy, Todoroki. Like a brother to me.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s jaw drops. Izuku mentally apologises for being so heavy-handed.\u00a0\n\"Uhm,\" he says.\nKacchan, on the other hand, looks positively delighted. \u201cA brother, huh.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Izuku chirps as Todoroki sits down on a slightly singed chair. \u201cJust like Iida and Uraraka, except she\u2019s a girl.\u201d\nKacchan turns his predatory smile on Todoroki. \u201cLucky you. Must be nice being Deku\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\u201cAt least he likes me,\u201d Todoroki snaps weakly. \u201cHe barely tolerates you.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan\u2019s also my friend,\u201d says Izuku honestly. \u201cEven if we\u2019re not as close as we used to be. Things weren\u2019t so great for a while, I guess, cause he used to be kind of a dick, but we did grow up together so he\u2019s basically family.\u201d\nKacchan\u2019s eyes narrow into slits. Deku regrets having been quite so blunt.\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cFamily. How touching.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d says Izuku.\n\u00a0They ignore him, of course, because Kacchan\u2019s more interested in tackling Todoroki around the middle and sending them both right out the open window. Somebody cheers. Izuku has a brief moment of panic before he remembers that the cafeteria\u2019s only on the first floor.\nHe pokes his head out to check. Kacchan and Todoroki are rolling around in a flowerbed, pulling each other\u2019s hair like a couple of children. Todoroki stuffs a handful of leaves in Kacchan\u2019s mouth, and Kacchan bites his fingers.\nIzuku leaves them there. \u201cThere goes Plan A,\u201d he mumbles, tugging a pen out of his pocket so he can jot notes on his palm. \u201cBut they have a chronic need to one-up each other just like peacocks trying to show off.\u201d\nMission semi-successful, he decides, and goes back to the classroom to try and clean fried rice off his shoes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTenya typically spends the last fifteen minutes of lunch break organizing his notes, while Uraraka and Midoriya typically spend their fifteen minutes distracting him.\nMidoriya\u2019s dragged someone\u2019s chair over so he can lie down on Tenya\u2019s desk and whine, cheek pressed to his Maths notebook and hair splayed all over the place. Tenya sort of wants his book back, but Midoriya does look very comfortable and Tenya decides not to ask him to move.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure things out soon,\u201d says Uraraka sympathetically. She\u2019s braiding little sections of Midoriya\u2019s hair, but he either doesn\u2019t mind or hasn\u2019t noticed.\nMidoriya pouts. He probably thinks he\u2019s scowling. \u201cI thought for sure my plan would work. They didn\u2019t even try to get along. I mean, I\u2019m not expecting them to be best friends right away, but I thought they might at least pretend to be civilized for an hour.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised,\u201d Tenya says, not unkindly. \u201cAll they ever do is fight over yo\u2014\u201d\nUraraka throws some eraser dust at him. \u201cDon\u2019t give up, Deku-kun. You just have to change your angle.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they need a nice, calm environment,\u201d Tenya suggests. \u201cHave either of them ever considered knitting?\u201d\nMidoriya makes a face and sits up. \u201cI bet Kacchan would be weirdly good at it and knit himself some knuckledusters or something.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably impossible, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not intrigued.\u201d\n\u201cThere has to be some way to just make them stop fighting,\u201d Uraraka says, resting her chin on the back of her hand. \u201cLike, they don\u2019t fight in class. Or where the teachers can see them, so they won\u2019t get in trouble. Maybe you should make them go on a date in front of Mr Aizawa so they have to behave themselves.\u201d\nTenya experiences a mild spike in his heartrate. \u201cDo not involve Mr Aizawa.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Midoriya protests as though he wasn\u2019t just seriously considering it. \u201cNone of the teachers will be interested, anyway, since those two are kind of hard to deal with. Lunch Rush wouldn\u2019t give me any fried rice today. He said it was because I came too late, but I think he\u2019s holding me responsible for Kacchan and Todoroki, which doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cIt kind of does,\u201d Tenya says. Uraraka throws more eraser dust at him.\u00a0\n\"The teachers will get involved eventually, I bet,\" Uraraka snorts while Tenya frowns and tries to clean little grey eraser bits off his sleeve. \"One day Mr Aizawa's going to get tired of them fighting all the time and throw them in detention. Or juvie. Then they'll have to get along, unless Bakugou sneaks his knitting needles in.\"\n\"Did we decide that he knits now?\" Tenya asks.\n\"They'll turn into a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde,\" Uraraka continues, clearly determined to see this narrative to the end. \"Former hero trainees, forced into a whirlwind romance steeped in violence and intrigue.\"\nMirodiya hums contemplatively. \"That does sound exciting.\"\n\"And extreme,\" Tenya adds. \"I'm going to have to point out that neither of them is going to appreciate you throwing them in jail just so they can't punch each other.\"\n\u201cNobody's going to go to jail, Iida. Except me, once I get out of school and eat a whole bakery.\"\n\"Hungry?\" Uraraka pats his arm.\n\"Yes. I can't believe I have to starve until I get home,\u201d Midoriya huffs, and then yelps when a dollar-store packet of dorayaki hits him in the back of the head.\nBakugou, from the other end of the class, lowers his arm and scowls. There\u2019s a twig sticking out of his hair. \u201cStop skipping meals, dumbass,\u201d he says, and Tenya wonders privately if Bakugou has a secondary hearing quirk.\n\u201cThanks?\u201d Midoriya calls back. The dorayaki is red bean flavoured, puffy plastic packaging going flat when Midoriya tears open one end. It\u2019s small and a little floppy, and Midoriya stares at it for a long second before putting the little bag down. \"Hmm.\"\n\u201cHurry up and eat,\u201d Bakugou snaps, although the rest of the class pays his outburst no attention. \u201cFour-eyes won\u2019t let you have it once the bell rings.\u201d\nMidoriya turns to him and smiles. It\u2019s a very wide smile, close-lipped and eyes bright with adventure, and Tenya is suddenly and inexplicably reminded of those deep-sea fish that are mostly just a bright light and some teeth.\u00a0\u201cOh, maybe later,\" he says. \"I prefer to eat these when they\u2019re warm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey're innocent words. Innocent, and yet Iida's spine tingles as a chair scrapes across the floor, Todoroki materializing on Uraraka\u2019s left with one hand held out and green stains on the back of his blazer. \u201cI can do it.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s leapt over a table. Sero screams, and the blond menace comes skidding to a halt so he can shoulder Todoroki out of the way. \u201cNo. Give it here.\u201d\n\u201cMe,\u201d Todoroki says, waving his hand in Midoriya\u2019s face. It\u2019s his left hand, Tenya realises. The one with the fire quirk.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u00a0Tenya slowly pushes his glasses back up his nose. \u201cYou're not suggesting what I think you're suggesting, are you? You aren't supposed to use your quirks in school. Not without explicit permission from a teacher.\u201d\nMidoriya tilts his head even though Tenya\u00a0knows\u00a0this is not news to him. \u201cOh! You\u2019re right, Iida. Never mind, guys, I\u2019ll go see if Lunch Rush will let me borrow a microwave real quick.\u201d\n\u201cFuck microwaves,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cYou won\u2019t get back in time. I said give it here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kacchan,\u201d Midoriya says placatingly. \u201cI don't want you to get all messy.\u00a0Anyway, I\u2019m pretty sure food won\u2019t taste any good unless you heat it up evenly. You know, kind of like Todoroki does? \u201d\nThe class goes silent. Uraraka puts both hands over her mouth. \u201cOh no.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodoroki\u2019s hand closes over the room-temperature dorayaki, fingers leaving faint dents on its spongy skin. \u201cMy quirk is better than a microwave,\u201d he says quietly.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d Iida says, hands clenched into fists on his desk. \u201cDon\u2019t break the rules right in front of me. Don\u2019t make me report you to Mr Aizawa, don\u2019t make me send you to detention.\u201d\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d says Bakugou resolutely, pinching the dorayaki\u2019s other end. \u201cMicrowaves are just lots of tiny explosions.\u201d\n\u201cNo they\u2019re not,\u201d says Yaoyorozu.\n\u201cDetention,\u201dsays Tenya.\nMidoriya turns to look at him with big green eyes that speak of innocence and deception. Almost in slow-motion, Tenya watches his mouth form around the words, casual but just loud enough for the whole class to hear.\n\u201cI wonder who could do it better?\u201d\nAn angler fish, Tenya thinks dimly. That's what the little sea monster was called.\nThe dorayaki explodes, and 1-A dissolves into chaos.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe might still have red bean in his hair, but it was worth it.\nCommunity service is maybe not the punishment Izuku expected. He supposes it doesn\u2019t matter, though.\u00a0 The important thing is that they're all on neutral territory and that Miss Midnight is keeping a distant eye on them, so Todoroki and Kacchan can't start another brawl without a face full of knockout gas for their troubles. It\u2019s just as Uraraka said; now that there\u2019s no avenue for violence, Kacchan and Todoroki have to behave themselves.\nThe fact that Izuku has to join them in picking up trash around campus at 4pm on a Wednesday, though, is necessary collateral damage.\u00a0He\u2019s also going to have to apologise to Iida. The pain on his face as he\u2019d sentenced them to detention is going to haunt Izuku\u2019s conscience for years.\nThe problem now is that the courtyard is kind of massive. It's nice that they're not all standing in each other's pockets, but that of course means Kacchan and Todoroki have decided to stay as far away from each other as humanly possible without straying out of Miss Midnight's sight. Todoroki's poking around the feature fountain, and Kacchan's aggressively sweeping leaves out of the flowerbeds and flipping Todoroki the bird whenever Midnight isn't looking.\u00a0\n\"There has to be some way to get them together,\" Izuku mutters to himself as he picks litter out of the stairwell. There are a lot of snack packets. \"They'll never get along if they won't even stand next to each other.\"\n\"I could make them do it,\" says a voice somewhere to his upper left. Izuku tilts his head back to see an unkempt purple head hanging over the stair railing, watching him intently. \"Would that help?\"\n\"Oh, hey, Hitoshi. Do you have after school-stuff too?\"\n\u00a0\"No.\"\n\u00a0\"We can't just make\u00a0them do it,\" Izuku muses. \"That wouldn't help in the long run, it wouldn't really make them like each other. It has to happen organically. Oh, ew, this still has jell-o in it.\"\n\u00a0\"You could handcuff them together.\"\n\u00a0\"Where would I get handcuffs?\"\n\u00a0\"I know a place,\" says Hitoshi.\n\u00a0\"One of them would lose an arm, anyway. You know, like how they say animals will chew their leg off if they get trapped.\" Miss Midnight is busy bullying Todoroki, so Izuku deems it safe to put down his trash bag and stretch. Hitoshi drifts a little closer. \"Actually, that might just be an myth, I don't know if animals really do that.\"\n\u00a0\"They do,\" says Hitoshi.\n\"I wish they could just see how much they have in common,\" Izuku sighs. Midnight clears her throat at him from across the courtyard, so he aborts the break and goes back to looking busy before she can give him more work to do. \"There's really no need for those two to fight all the time. Wow, nobody's cleaned under the stairs before, huh? It's full of cardboard boxes and junk-- oh, hello.\"\nHe nudges the topmost box with the tip of his finger. A pair of luminous yellow eyes peer over the top, and a white paw bats his hand away.\nGingerly, Izuku reaches into the box and lifts its tenant with both hands. It's a large tom cat with one brown ear and another ear that was probably also brown, although Izuku will never know because the ear is no longer attached to the cat. Its nose may no longer be attached either. It's hard to tell, because there's a spot on its face that could maybe be a nose, but also sort of looks like somebody drew it on with pink marker. Its owner allows itself to be held by the armpits, unassuming paws no doubt hiding tiny razors at the ready.\nIt's the ugliest cat Izuku has ever seen.\u00a0\n\"It's perfect,\" says Izuku.\u00a0\n\"It sure is,\" says Hitoshi longingly. He's migrated off the stairs so he can look over Izuku's shoulder, sleepy purple eyes following the pendulum swing of a balding feline tail.\u00a0\n\"This\u00a0is what they have in common.\"\n\"Cats?\"\n\"Heroism. I mean, this cat is helpless, right?\"\nHitoshi looks doubtful. \"I think it's probably been in a few fights.\"\n\"No, yeah, I know, this particular cat kind of looks like a thug, but I mean cats in general. They're helpless. So what are heroes supposed to do when a helpless person is in trouble? They have to save them.\" Izuku grins, the cogs of a plan whirring slowly to life in his head, and he looks over his shoulder to make sure nobody's watching. Miss Midnight seems to have caught Kacchan in the act of flipping Todoroki off, and is now lecturing them both. Perfect. \"Okay. Let's engineer a little crisis, and let the hero instincts kick in.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe leaves Hitoshi lurking in the stairwell and tucks the ugly cat into the jacket of his P.E. uniform, wincing only a little bit when it hooks its claws into his t shirt. \"You're smelly,\" he tells it as he sprints away from the building to find a tree. There's a fairly big one with a smooth trunk and no convenient branches. \"Take a shower once in a while, huh?\"\nThe cat grumbles at him in a voice like a small rusty chainsaw. Still hidden and holding onto his charge with one arm, Izuku conjures up the mental image of an egg in a microwave and makes the three-metre leap onto the very top of the tree. The cat tries to shred his chest upon landing, but Izuku's been through worse, and he grabs onto a branch and shimmies into the foliage so he can unearth the cat and plant it on the most conspicuous branch he can find. \"Sorry, kitty. Don't worry, Todoroki and Kacchan will rescue you soon.\"\nHe\u00a0wiggles backwards and prepares to jump out of the tree.\nThe hell-cat digs its claws into the tender skin of his forearm.\n\"Ow,\" says Izuku.\n\u00a0Mrow,\u00a0says the cat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA rivulet of blood trickles down his arm and into the leafy abyss. Izuku breathes out. \"Maybe,\" he says slowly, \"I should have picked another cat.\"\nVery gently, he squeezes the cat\u2019s paw between his fingers and pries it away from his arm, wincing at the tiny gouges it leaves in its wake. \u201cPlease let go of me,\u201d he whispers into the cat\u2019s remaining ear. \u201cI know how this looks but I promise it\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d\nThe cat does not oblige. He could wait until it decides to take mercy and release him, which....yeah, okay, that's not going to happen any time soon because it's just decided to attack him with the other paw and ow, okay, Izuku may have broken every bone in his body and cleared a beach full of trash with his bare hands but he did\u00a0not\u00a0expect this to be one of the most painful experiences in his life.\nAlright, abort mission. He needs to get out of this tree before the others see him because that\u2019s just going to defeat the purpose of this whole operation. Then he he has to decide whether he wants to start over, or maybe switch to a smaller decoy who\u2019s not going to put up so much of a fight.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d asks Kacchan, because Kacchan ruins everything.\nIzuku considers his options. Technically, the cat\u2019s in the tree. Izuku is also in the tree. They both need help getting down. The cat has kind of morphed into the villain in this situation instead of the victim, but the point is that all the major parts of the puzzle are present, so Izuku has what he needs.\nHis pride is, unfortunately, also going to be collateral damage.\nI\u2019m a top UA student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a living legend and I\u2019m in a tree being mauled by a cat who may or may not have a real nose,\u00a0Izuku thinks, and then bites the bullet. \u201cSo I, uh, might be stuck.\u201d\n\"How?\" Todoroki says, coming over to stand at the foot of the tree. He's genuinely confused, bless him. Izuku decides not to tell him the truth.\n\u00a0\"I saw this cat here so I climbed up to rescue it but now I can't get down.\"\n\u00a0Neither of them laugh at him, which is nice (Miss Midnight does, but Izuku's used to that). Instead Kacchan pinches the bridge of his nose in a way that's strangely reminiscent of Iida. \"I swear to god, Deku.\"\n\"Don't be rude,\" Todoroki says. \"He did his best.\"\n\"He's like a fucking toddler. A grown-ass toddler who can punch stuff but can't win a fight against a tree. I don't know why your mother lets you out of the house,\u00a0Deku.\"\n\"My hands are full of cat,\" Izuku says weakly. \"I can jump but I don't want to spook it.\"\u00a0\nKacchan throws his hands up. \"Who cares? It's a fucking cat.\"\n\"Izuku cares, because he's kind and wants to help.\"\n\u00a0\"Nobody asked you, you red and white candy cane wannabe.\"\n\"It's blood orange.\"\n\u00a0\"It's fucking red, you pretentious ass.\"\n\"I'll help you, Izuku,\" Todoroki says, turning away and ignoring Kacchan completely. \"Don't be afraid, I'll climb up and get you.\"\n\"Fuck that,\" says Kacchan, shouldering him aside so he can look up at the tree himself. \"Just stay still and I'll blast myself up there.\"\nTodoroki gives him the stink face. \"Really? You know explosions aren't always the answer, right? Are you trying to save Izuku or blow him up?\"\u00a0\n\"He'll live. It'll be a hell of a lot faster than waiting for you to learn how to climb a tree.\"\n\"I know how to climb a tree.\"\n\"Your repressed ass had never seen a skipping rope until last week.\"\n\"I had a weird childhood.\"\n\"Uh huh. Say, pretend the tree is your daddy issues, maybe that'll help you get over it.\"\n\"Guys,\" says Izuku because it's starting to feel like he's lost a fair amount of blood. \"I would like to be able to go home today. Or at least call my mom and tell her I live here now.\"\n\u201cYou could work together,\u201d says Miss Midnight, perched on the edge of the fountain and making absolutely no move to help. Izuku nods his head vigorously in agreement. \u201cThis is good hero training, even if it\u2019s a little disorganized.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cI\u2019ll make ice stairs and rescue Izuku, and Bakugou can wait here and watch.\u201d\n\u201cThe hell I will,\u201d says Kacchan. \u201cYou can handle the cat.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the cat. I want Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cI love teenage boys,\u201d says Miss Midnight. \u201cEverything turns into a dick-measuring contest one way or another. It\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised they let you near minors,\u201d says Kacchan.\nIce crackles in the warm air as it shoots out of Todoroki's hand, propelling him slowly upwards until he's eye-to-eye with Izuku. \"I'm here to save you,\" he says, somewhat unecessarily. \"Just give me a second to balance on this so I can carry you down.\"\n\"You really don't have to,\" Izuku tells him. The cat narrows its eyes as if it's wondering whether to maul Todoroki next. \"Uhm, by the way, Kacchan's coming up here and he doesn't look too happy.\"\nTodoroki says something awful under his breath. Izuku covers the cat's ear.\n\"Deku,\" Kacchan bellows from halfway up the frozen monolith, fingernails digging into its solid surface and Nikes somehow helping him cling to its side like some sort of horrifying bipedal spider. \"Don't you fucking dare\u00a0leave that tree with him.\"\n\"Get off my ice tower,\" Todoroki snaps, kicking at Bakugou's head the moment it's within reach.\u00a0\nKacchan grabs an ankle and pulls. \"How 'bout you take your ice tower and sit on it?\"\n\"Can't we all just get along?\" Izuku says, wincing as Todoroki leaves a shoeprint on Kacchan's forehead. Kacchan's fists spark, and a large crack splits the tower around the middle. \"Oh my god, be careful, you're gonna fall.\"\n\"Do a flip,\" says Miss Midnight.\nKacchan turns his head to tell her something that's definitely going to get him in more trouble. He doesn't get to, though, because he's drowned out by a noise like a gunshot as the crack widens and Todoroki's structure fails.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tower topples. It happens almost in slow motion, shards of luminescent ice falling like hail as Kacchan and Todoroki plummet to the unforgiving ground. What's left over is a meter of solid ice that crashes into the tree that Izuku's in, fracturing its trunk down the middle, both halves swaying until they succumb to the pull of gravity. The cat clings to his face and yowls.\u00a0\nThis is it,\u00a0Izuku thinks, one eye obscured by cat fur and the other barely registering Kacchan scrambling up to run towards him. A pale hand closes around his leg and brings him back to the ground. I could land on my own, but I won't. This is how they'll learn to work together in the face of emergency.\nLeaves whip around his face and a twig snaps in his grip. Their branch falls sideways, and Izuku forces himself to ignore the way his body instinctively tries to land on its feet. Todoroki dives with both arms out to catch him, but Kacchan explodes him out of the way. Or maybe, just maybe, today is the day I die.\nThe cat senses that this cause is lost and leaps way to fend for itself. Izuku, lost in a coffin of foliage, shuts his eyes and bids goodbye to his mother.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeath is soft and smells like perfume and leather. Izuku takes stock of his physical being and notes that the afterlife looks a lot like a high school campus.\u00a0\n\"That could have gone better,\" says Midnight, one arm under Izuku's knees and the other wrapped securely around his back. Her hair tickles his forehead, and he becomes acutely aware of how little material she has on. \"I'm afraid you boys have a lot to learn, but at least I found a cute stray. Maybe I should take him home.\"\nShe is not talking about the cat, Izuku realises, because the cat has landed safely in Hitoshi's arms and it rubbing its ugly head against the underside of his chin.\u00a0Face burning crimson, Izuku stares at the sky and wonders if falling from Midnight's arms could kill him if he tried really hard.\n\"Izuku,\" says Todoroki weakly from the crook of Kacchan's elbow. Defeated, Kacchan releases him, and they both slump into the dirt and leaves as Izuku wriggles around so he doesn't look quite so much like a nubile blushing bride.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Can I keep this cat?\" says Hitoshi.\n\"If you like,\" says Midnight.\u00a0\nMew,\u00a0says the cat.\nSilently, Izuku puts his face in his hands and tries not to pass out or cry.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak to Midoriya today,\u201d Iida tells Ochako when she comes into class.\nShe believes him, to be fair. There\u2019s no doubt in her mind that Iida had spent all morning giving himself a pep-talk in the mirror, debating internally about his duties as class president versus his duties as a friend. Had probably reminded himself multiple times, as he\u2019d tied his tie, that Midoriya had broken their trust when he\u2019d broken the rules, and worked himself up into a state of righteous indignation strong enough to withstand the effect of Midoriya\u2019s inevitable pouting.\nShe believes him. But she really isn\u2019t surprised when Midoriya gives them puppy eyes and Iida crumbles immediately.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Midoriya says very sincerely as Iida screams quietly into his hands. \u201cI had a plan, but I needed us all to get into detention. I know that must have been really hard for you.\u201d\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d Ochako asks. The scratches all over Midoriya\u2019s face suggest that it didn\u2019t.\nTrue enough, Midoriya shakes his head ruefully. He pulls up a chair and parks himself between their desks so they\u2019re all at eye level. \u201cI tried to engineer a little situation so they\u2019d have to work together. They couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d He turns his sad, scuffed puppy face to Iida. \u201cWhich I feel really bad about. I put you in that crappy position and it didn\u2019t even work out. I really am sorry.\u201d\nIida\u2019s face contorts. Overwhelmed, he decides to look at the ceiling instead. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do anything like that again.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. I forgive you.\u201d\nMidoriya lights up exponentially. \u201cI was so worried you\u2019d be mad at me! And I really wanted to hang out, too, since we couldn\u2019t have lunch together yesterday. I missed you.\u201d\nIida makes a strangled noise. Ochako doesn\u2019t blame him at all.\n\u201cHow did you get hurt?\u201d she says because Iida looks like he\u2019s actually going to burst into tears. \u201cWas it Bakugou?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d says Midoriya quickly. \u201cBut no, it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d\nShe gasps. \u201c Todoroki?\u201d \n\u201cNo! It was my own fault, promise. Collateral damage. But now I\u2019m out of ideas,\u201d He sighs, deflating so he can rest his chin on the table. \u201cThis may be harder than anticipated. Just throwing them together won\u2019t work. I\u2019m going to need to rethink my strategy and come up with something more sophisticated if I want them to get over their awkwardness. Really get in their heads, you know?\u201d\n\u201cThat might be hard. They  are  very stupid,\u201d Ochako says.\nMidoriya doesn\u2019t explicitly agree, but he does grin. \u201cTodoroki\u2019s kind of a mystery, but you\u2019d think I\u2019d know how to deal with Kacchan after having known him for so long.\u201d\n\u201cNobody knows how to deal with Bakugou. I don\u2019t think even his parents know. I bet he was born and they had to call an exorcist instead of a midwife.\u201d\n\u201cKirishima knows,\u201d says Iida helpfully. He\u2019s still staring at the ceiling, so he doesn\u2019t notice the meaningful look Ochako gives him. \u201cI think Kirishima may be the only person Bakugou hasn\u2019t tried to punch yet. Although, that may only be because Bakugou knows he\u2019ll hurt himself.\u201d\n\u201cKirishima,\u201d Midoriya says with awe.\n\u201cWait,\u201d says Iida, abruptly realizing what he\u2019s done. \u201cForget I said that. I didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOf  course! I was missing the most obvious clue all along.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\nThe chair scrapes as Midoriya scrambles to his feet and back to his desk. \u201cThanks, Iida!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Iida sighs.\nThis time, Ochako doesn\u2019t even try not to laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku thanks the Buddha that Kirishima is, out of all of their classmates, probably the easiest one to approach.\n\u201cCan I ask you a favour?\u201d he says, tugging on Kirishima\u2019s sleeve as the other boy is rooting around in his backpack for lunch money.\nKirishima smiles at him. Izuku smiles back on reflex, and marvels at Kirishima\u2019s ability to look friendly even with a mouth full of crooked shark teeth. \u201cSure thing, my man. What d\u2019you need?\u201d\nIzuku clutches his yellow notebook to his chest and glances at Kaminari and Ashido. \u201cIt\u2019s, uhm, it\u2019s a little private.\u201d\n\u201cOh? Okay, go on without me, guys,\u201d he says and waves the others off with promises to meet them in the cafeteria as soon as he can. \u201cSounds spicy,\u201d he says, waggling his eyebrows ridiculously. \u201cAre we doing something top secret?\u201d\n\u201cA little bit,\u201d Izuku replies. Kirishima\u2019s not actually that tall up close, he notes. A lot of his silhouette is really just hair. \u201cMaybe I should start from the beginning. It\u2019s about,\u201d he says, and then pauses because the skin on the back of his neck is starting to prickle in a very specific way. \u201cUhm, by any chance is Kacchan behind me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d says Kirishima cheerfully. \u201cYour instincts are killer!\u201d\n\u201cFunny you should say that,\u201d Izuku croaks, shoving the incriminating notebook into his blazer. He can actually  feel  Kacchan breathing down on him and the proximity makes little tendrils of horror work their way up his spine. \u201cHey, Kacchan. Did you need something?\u201d\n\u201cBakugou\u2019s just waiting to go to lunch with me and the squad,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cWhat did you say you needed help with, by the way?\u201d\n\u201cI just...wanted to know if you had an extra thousand yen, is all. I forgot my wallet and Iida and Uraraka are out of cash.\u201d\nA crumpled-up bill is shoved into the back of his collar. Izuku almost shrieks. \u201cStupid Deku,\u201d grumbles Kacchan from behind him. Without warning, he appears in Izuku\u2019s periphery, a large bruise on his chin and suspicious green stains on his blazer. \u201cYou\u2019d forget your stupid freckles if they weren\u2019t stuck to your face.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d probably look better without them,\u201d Izuku says weakly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dumb.\u201d\n\u201cUhm, okay.\u201d The money is starting to make its merry way into his shirt, and Izuku contorts a little painfully to get it out. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll pay you back tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust shut up and take the money,\u201d Kacchan snaps, and then scowls when Kirishima laughs. \u201cYou shut up too. Come on, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. But hey,\u201d he says, clapping Izuku on the shoulder. \u201cI know a man has his pride and all, but you don\u2019t need to be ashamed of asking for money when you really need it, alright?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh. Oh, yeah, sure.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Kacchan tsks and snatches Kirishima by the wrist, dragging him away from Izuku and out the door to join the others at the cafeteria. Izuku, unnecessary money in one hand and notebook falling out of his blazer, watches them go and sighs.\nThat was a bit too close. He\u2019d forgotten that getting Kirishima alone would be difficult without Kacchan getting suspicious, because they\u2019re always together and Kacchan is unfortunately even sharper than Kirishima\u2019s hair. And there\u2019s no guarantee Kirishima won\u2019t spill the beans, come to think of it. He\u2019s a nice guy, but he doesn\u2019t always think before he talks. Having him in on the plan may turn out to be a liability in the long run, because Kacchan has a short temper and Izuku does not have a hardening quirk to save him.\nOkay. Covert operations, then. Humming to himself, he turns around to hide his notebook back in his bag, considering and discarding scenarios in his head.\nKacchan tolerates Kirishima\u2019s existence. Probably even enjoys his existence, so Izuku needs to find out what it is about Kirishima that\u2019s so effective. Has to be discreet, because Kirishima can\u2019t know about the ultimate goal of getting Kacchan and Todoroki together. But he can ask about Kirishima and Kacchan\u2019s friendship, try to understand how their relationship works. It might be too late for Izuku to get along with Kacchan personally, but maybe the information will be of some use to Todoroki.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomeone taps him on the shoulder. A thousand yen bill is held in front of his nose. Izuku blinks, and then goes a little cross-eyed as Todoroki tries to press the note against his forehead.\n\u201cI heard you needed money,\u201d is all he says. He has a black eye. It\u2019s the one without the scar, so the overall effect is kind of raccoon-ish.\nIzuku peels the note off his face and frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t actually need\u2014 I mean, Kacchan gave me some. Thank you, though.\u201d\n\u201cTake mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with two thousand yen?\u201d\nNose scrunched, Todoroki plucks Kacchan\u2019s money out of Izuku\u2019s hand and throws it into the trash. It\u2019s immediately picked up by Kaminari, who pockets it and sprints for the door. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHey! What do you mean, no ?\u201d Izuku says, too taken aback to properly scold him. \u201cDid you actually just throw money away for no reason?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take money from strange men.\u201d\n\u201cIt was  Kacchan,\u201d says Izuku. \u201cWhom I have known my whole life, might I add.\u201d\nThis seems to displease Todoroki instead of reassuring him. \u201cHe\u2019s still strange. Use my money. And you don\u2019t have to give it back.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t just not pay you back.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a present. It\u2019s bad manners to give back presents.\u201d\nIt feels like the conversation is escaping from him a little bit. Still, Todoroki looks so serious that Izuku can\u2019t find it in him to argue. \u201cOh my god. I-- okay. Alright, I will use your money. Just so you know, you\u2019re also really strange.\u201d\nTodoroki nods. There\u2019s no discernible change in his expression, but his steps do seem to be strangely bouncy as he leaves the classroom to go to lunch.\nIzuku looks at the money in his hands. The money that he certainly doesn\u2019t need, seeing as he got his allowance last week, but Todoroki had seemed adamant about not returning it. Just like Kacchan, in fact. He should have known that they would compete over being generous.\nShrugging, he goes to lunch, and decides to use the money to buy Iida some orange juice.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Goal: Get Kirishima to talk about his friendship with Kacchan (in progress) \n\n\u00a0\n\n Attempt 1: \u00a0Join their group for lunch \n\n\n Result: Kacchan sat between us, couldn\u2019t get Kirishima alone. \n\n\u00a0\n\n Attempt 2: Talk to him after school \n\n\n Result: Kacchan tagged along. He said we were too stupid to navigate by ourselves (rude). Todoroki came too for some reason even though he lives on the other side of town. \n\n\u00a0\n\n Attempt 3: Pick Kirishima as my bio lab partner this week (try to get Kacchan and Todoroki to sit together?) \n\n\n Result: Kacchan and Todoroki started another fight before we could even get to the lab. I asked Kirishima after they settled down but he\u2019d already picked Kaminari. \n\n\n Addendum: I think Kacchan told me to be his partner but I couldn\u2019t hear him very well because Todoroki was trying to strangle him. I\u2019m with Ojiro, though. He\u2019s good at lab work! \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku sighs and shuts his notebook. A week\u2019s gone by with no results, which is especially frustrating because Kirishima is his one ray of hope in this project right now. He\u2019d been worried about how to finagle information out of him without telling him the whole plan, but that\u2019s not going to be an issue if he can\u2019t even get a chance to  talk to the guy.\n\u201cRough day?\u201d says Hitoshi from inside a supply cupboard.\nIzuku tucks his book under his arm and opens the door. \u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201d\n\u201cLooking for bleach,\u201d Hitoshi says, holding up a bright orange bottle. The school bell rang about ten minutes ago, so they\u2019ve just missed the daily stampede for the exit. \u201cAren\u2019t you going home?\u201d\n\u201cI am, I just wanted to avoid the crowd.\u201d And, how. The corridor leading to the main door looks massive when it\u2019s deserted like this. Their footsteps echo across the polished floors as Hitoshi emerges from the closet with both arms full. Izuku very kindly doesn\u2019t make a joke about him coming out. \u201cYou remember those two friends I was trying to set up?\u201d\n\u201cNot having much luck?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku sighs again. He\u2019s been sighing a lot lately. Maybe this is why Iida has such a great lung capacity, actually. It\u2019s not from running, just exasperation. \u201cThere was another guy I was hoping to ask for advice, but getting him alone is proving to be really difficult. I mean, it\u2019s great that he always has company, but this needs to stay private. I\u2019m not even sure I can tell him all the details.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it gets out? That won\u2019t go over well for me, plus it\u2019ll ruin the plan.\u201d\n\u201cI could make him keep it a secret,\u201d says Hitoshi. \u201cI could make him forget what he heard. It\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. That might just freak him out,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cThanks, though.\u201d\nHitoshi remains thoughtfully quiet for a second, and only speaks up again when they\u2019re about to exit the building and go their separate ways. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just text him?\u201d\nIzuku stops in his tracks. \u201cOh my god. That\u2019s all I had to do. You\u2019re a  genius .\u201d\n\u201cI try.\u201d\n\u201cGreat! I just have to ask for his phone number tomorrow and we\u2019re golden.\u201d\nHitoshi nods, bleach bottles wobbling in his arms as he digs around in his pocket for his metro card. \u201cGood luck. Tell me how it goes.\u201d\n\u201cI will!\u201d Izuku says, and, excitement mounting, runs all the way home so he can barrel through the front door and terrify his mother.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCupid smiles on him the next day, because Kacchan, for once, wakes up a little late and doesn\u2019t walk Izuku to school like he\u2019s insisted on doing lately. Kirishima gets to class just a little after Izuku\u2019s said hello to Iida and Uraraka, and Izuku, sensing an opportunity, makes a beeline for the door.\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d he chirps before Kirishima even has a chance to sit down. \u201cHey, uhm, I\u2019m sorry if this is a little weird, but I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\nKirishima drops his backpack on his desk. \u201cSure, bro.\u201d\n\u201cCould I have your number?\u201d\nKirishima blinks at him. Izuku smiles back, tilting his head a little when the information isn\u2019t immediately forthcoming. \u201cKirishima?\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d says Kirishima abruptly. \u201cI mean, yeah, sure, uh, you gonna write this down?\u201d\nHe rattles off the number so Izuku can key it into his phone. There isn\u2019t a rock emoji, so Izuku picks the star that most closely resembles Kirishima\u2019s hairstyle and saves it next to his name. \u201cGreat! Thank you!\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Kirishima beams back. \u201cYou seem pumped.\u201d\n\u201cI am!\u201d Izuku says, although he can\u2019t elaborate on why. Kacchan comes sprinting through the door twenty seconds before the bell rings, giving Izuku a particularly evil look as though it\u2019s somehow his fault that the alarm clock didn\u2019t go off or whatever. Izuku doesn\u2019t let if faze him. He gives Kirishima another smile and manages, just barely, to focus on the rest of the school day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe good mood stays until later that night when Izuku texts Kirishima hello. He receives a reply in less than a minute. Kirishima texts with bad spelling and a lot of exclamation marks, it turns out.\n\u201cHow am I going to ask him about Kacchan without being weird?\u201d Izuku muses aloud in the solitude of his bedroom. The All Might poster above his bed doesn\u2019t answer. Rolling over, Izuku kicks his feet in the air and hums. \u201cI can\u2019t just bring it up out of the blue, especially since Kirishima and I aren\u2019t even that close. I\u2019ve never even texted him. Maybe I should try having a normal conversation first?\u201d\nHis phone buzzes. It\u2019s not Kirishima, though. It\u2019s a picture of the cat from the other day, now clean but unfortunately still ugly. It\u2019s cuddled next to a chewed-up plush toy on what must be Hitoshi\u2019s bed. It\u2019s such a nice picture that Izuku doesn\u2019t even ask how Hitoshi got his number.\n He looks happy,  Izuku texts back, which is partially a lie because the cat\u2019s weird face is about as emotive as a cardboard box.  By the way, you were right, it was easier to just text him. \nHitoshi just texts back a thumbs up. Izuku, yellow notebook in hand, grins to himself and sets about turning Kirishima into an ally.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re big on texting,\u201d says Kirishima three days later.\nIzuku makes a questioning noise. His attention is on Todoroki, because earlier he\u2019d tried to slip a 1000-yen bill into his back pocket and Todoroki had choked on his yoghurt. Iida had had to do the Heimlich. Todoroki\u2019s still a little red, which might be leftover adrenaline or it might be the fact that Kacchan had seen what happened and immediately come over to pick a fight. \u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d leave him alone for at least ten minutes, Torodoki  did  almost just choke to death. Also, sorry, what was that?\u201d\n\u201cI said you\u2019re big on texting,\u201d Kirishima repeats. Izuku turns to look up at him, and then suddenly remembers how aggressively he\u2019s been pursuing a chance to talk.\n\u201cOh no. I made you uncomfortable, didn\u2019t I,\u201d he says half to himself, hands coming up on their own accord to plaster themselves to his cheeks. \u201cI am  so sorry, I swear I\u2019m not trying to be annoying on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cNo way, bro!\u201d Kirishima says loudly enough to make Kaminari give them the side eye. He doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t mind spending time with you and stuff. You\u2019re rad.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure? Oh gosh. I\u2019ve been so focused on trying to talk to you that I didn\u2019t even notice how much I was pestering you.\u201d\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s totally cool!\u201d Kirishima scratches the back of his neck awkwardly. Izuku hates himself a little bit. \u201cUh, well, we have time now. What did you wanna talk about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I ain\u2019t gonna judge.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to ask about your relationship with Kacchan,\u201d says Izuku, feeling his ears turn warm. Kirishima\u2019s mouth turns into a little round \u2018o\u2019 of surprise. Eye contact is suddenly difficult, so Izuku shuffles his feet and looks at the floor. \u201cI know that\u2019s a little weird. I just, I notice he seems to like you. And you\u2019re together all the time, so I just wanted to, I dunno. Ask.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a second of silence. Izuku chances a glance up; Kirishima\u2019s face is doing something very complicated, contorting in a way that looks like he\u2019s torn between shock, epiphany, and tears.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku says immediately. \u201cI sound like a stalker. Forget I said anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Eyes clenched shut, Kirishima reaches up and puts both hands on Izuku\u2019s shoulders. It\u2019s like being squeezed by a heavy and very sentimental python. \u201cNo, I get what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Midoriya, man, you\u2019re a brave guy. I know it isn\u2019t easy to put yourself out there like that.\u201d\nIzuku supposes he has a point. Kacchan is a bit like Bloody Mary, after all\u2014 keep talking about him and eventually he shows up. \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d\nKirishima nods. \u201cI\u2019m super flattered. And, listen, I just want you to know that Bakugou and I are friends, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku says. It\u2019s kind of the reason he\u2019s been so pushy in the first place.\n\u201c Just  friends. Promise.\u201d\n\u201cUhm, okay. Gotcha.\u201d\nKirishima wipes his eyes. Must have hay fever or something. \u201cOh, man. You\u2019re cute as hell, dude. I did not expect this. I mean, I had a little suspicion, but still.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I said anything,\u201d Izuku says, bemused but still a little embarrassed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll back off on bothering you, promise.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d Kirishima\u2019s grip tightens on his shoulders, and he leans forward so that Izuku is forced to maintain eye contact. Somewhere in the background, Todoroki and Bakugou\u2019s argument screeches to a halt. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bother. And I can\u2019t give you an answer right now, but this isn\u2019t going to change our friendship. We\u2019re bros to the end.\u201d\n\u201cGood to know.\u201d The classroom\u2019s deathly silence almost feels like it\u2019s sucking him into a vortex of social awkwardness. Hairs rise on the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t expect an immediate answer, I just wanted to, uhm, put it out there. So you can think about it and get back to me. Or something.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a man\u2019s man,\u201d says Kirishima earnestly.\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d The bell rings, and Izuku wants to cry with relief when Mr Aizawa comes in and tells them to get their asses back to their seats so they can start homeroom. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch?\u201d\nKirishima wipes his eyes again. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world, bro.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIida says lunch that afternoon is supposed to be curry, which is slightly ruined by the fact that Todoroki and Kacchan have not stopped staring at Izuku all day.\nThey hadn\u2019t overheard, though, thankfully. Izuku knows this because Kacchan turns around after homeroom, slams his hands on Izuku\u2019s table and demands to know what he\u2019d said to Kirishima.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Izuku squeaks before Yaoyorozu tells them to be quiet and get ready for class.\nIzuku\u2019s desk cracks under Kacchan\u2019s fingertips. Izuku gulps. Maybe he should move today. There\u2019s an empty seat between him and Yaoyorozu that he could use. It may have had an occupant once, but whoever it was has been replaced by a glue stick and a couple of grapes. Nobody\u2019s really mentioned it yet, but someone does keep replacing the grapes every few days.\nHe manages to escape at lunch, because Uraraka, bless her, drags him to their usual table and parks him right between Iida and herself. Kirishima tags along. He brings Kaminari, who apparently feels the weight of Kacchan\u2019s evil eye all the way across the cafeteria because he tries to vacate the seat before Kirishima pulls him back down to stay. He doesn\u2019t seem happy about it. Izuku is, if only because Kaminari blocks him from Kacchan\u2019s view a little bit.\nThe last seat is taken by a boy from 1-B that Izuku doesn\u2019t know. Captain Redundancy, Kacchan had called him once. He\u2019s got crazy thick eyelashes and spikey hair, and he pounces on Kirishima\u2019s back and steals one of his potatoes.\n\u201cBro!\u201d says Kirishima, lighting up immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t stick your fingers in my food, bro, that\u2019s nasty.\u201d\n\u201cNah, bro,\u201d says Captain Redundancy. \u201cMy fingers are steel, bro, germs don\u2019t stick to \u2018em.\u201d\n Tetsutetsu,  right. The one with the similar quirk to Kirishima\u2019s.\nIida coughs. \u201cThat is most certainly not how germs work.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s strong, he\u2019ll live.\u201d Tetsu waves a hand flippantly and sits down, one arm wound tight around Kirishima\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLine\u2019s too long, I\u2019m gonna wait \u2018til it thins out. Hope they still have potatoes, though. Potatoes are the best part.\u201d\n\u201cTake some of mine,\u201d says Kirishima immediately, spearing one with a fork and holding it in front of Tetsu\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo bro of mine is gonna go without potatoes.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, bro. You tried the protein shake recipe I sent you yet?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. I haven\u2019t been lifting a lot lately.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not, bro? You need to keep your strength up.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who gives me strength, bro.\u201d\n\u201c Bro.\u201d \nUraraka puts her face in her hands. \u201cWhy are boys like this?\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could tell you,\u201d says Kaminari.\nIzuku, however, is more preoccupied by the strong hand that still rests on Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. Kirishima leans into the touch absently, feeding Tetsu potatoes in between bites of his own meal. \u201cYou guys get along really well, huh?\u201d says Izuku.\nTetsu speaks with his mouth full. \u201cOf course. We\u2019re best bros.\u201d\n\u201cWe even have the same birthday,\u201d says Kirishima proudly. \u201cOctober 16th.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re Libras. Li bros.\u201d \n\u201cFascinating,\u201d says Izuku, leaning forward a little as the beginnings of an idea starts to form in his mind. \u201cAnd you\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we just said,\u201d says Tetsu.\n\u201cDo you spend a lot of time together?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d says Kirishima. \u201cWe have the same hobbies, we do lots of stuff together. Right, bro?\u201d\n\u201cRight, bro. You gave me some of my best broments.\u201d\n\u201cBro.\u201d\n\u201c Bro.  Sleepover tonight?  \u201d \n\u201cHell yeah. But you have to promise not to slap my ass in front of my grandma again, bro. It ain\u2019t good to surprise her at her age.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, bro. You just have such a sweet ass, it\u2019s like you sat in sugar.\u201d\nKirishima blinks, and then shakes his head at Izuku, alarmed. \u201cIt was a friendship butt pat! We\u2019re, like, totally platonic.\u201d\n\u201cBrotonic,\u201d says Tetsu.\n\u201cNothing you need to worry about,\u201d adds Kirishima.\n\u201cWhy would I be worried?\u201d says Izuku. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re close.\u201d\nKirishima melts back against Tetsu\u2019s side. \u201cYou get it!\u201d\n\u201cI sure do,\u201d says Izuku, not noticing the way Iida goes rigid beside him. Uraraka, on his other side, puts a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh. \u201cPlatonic soulmates. You two sound like a match made in heaven.\u201d\n\u201cWe sure are,\u201d says Kirishima, feeding Tetsu more curry. \u201cDude.  Brotatoes.\u201d \n\u201cBro.\u201d\n\u201c Bro.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d says Iida.\n\u201cPlease do it,\u201d says Uraraka.\nIzuku\u2019s going to need another notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBakugou?\u201d\n\u201cPower bottom.\u201d\n\u201cBut a prude.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, really?\u201d\nAshido leans forward and steeples her fingers in front of her mouth. \u201cBear with me. I know he looks like he\u2019d throw a hissy fit if you didn\u2019t let him top, but a guy like that would want you to work for him. That being said, have you noticed he\u2019s like a cat? Anyone who wanted to touch him would have to coax him into it first.\u201d\nHagakure\u2019s uniform bobs, which probably means she\u2019s nodding her head. Understandably it\u2019s a little hard to tell sometimes, with her. \u201cI get that. But Midoriya\u2019s already passed that hurdle, right? Would he really need to do the extra coaxing?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, we are talking about Bakugou,\u201d says Tsuyu. \u201cDating him just means he wouldn\u2019t explode you. I think he\u2019d still make you jump through hoops.\u201d\n\u201cBut would Midoriya do that, though? He seems so sweet, I can\u2019t imagine him initiating things,\u201d Hagakure points out.\nAshido snorts. \u201cAre you kidding? I bet he\u2019s a freak.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d Koda glances in their direction, so Ashido lowers her voice to a stage whisper. \u201cHave you seen how he gets when he\u2019s interested in something? I bet you anything he\u2019s got a little black book of crazy sex stuff he wants to try the moment he gets into a relationship.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d write down the results and compare them so he only has the best toys and stuff,\u201d says Tsuyu. \u201cAnd he would try everything.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d be good at it,\u201d Aoyama chips in. \u201cA brain like that and a strengthening quirk? Oh, yeah. Super cute as a bottom, but he\u2019d make a fantastic top. What do you think, Jirou?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a lesbian.\u201d\n\u201cBah.\u201d Flipping his hair, Aoyama steals a look across the room at Midoriya, who is pouting sweetly at a History textbook. He does that a lot when he thinks, they\u2019ve noticed. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t judge that little green book by its cover. He and Bakugou would be an interesting pair, once he convinces Bakugou to stop being pissy.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Hagakure, leaning forward to (probably) mirror Ashido\u2019s pose. \u201cWhat about when you pair him up with Todoroki? Todoroki is a top if I\u2019ve ever seen one. Anyone would bottom for him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d bottom for him,\u201d says Aoyama.\n\u201cYou\u2019d bottom for anyone,\u201d says Jirou.\nTsuyu hums. \u201cGood point. I can see them switching it up every now and then, but I can\u2019t decide if Todoroki would be as kinky as Midoriya or kind of vanilla.\u201d\n\u201cKinky,\u201d says Yaoyorozu, who had been sitting next to Jirou and pretending not to listen up till now. \u201cHe\u2019s worse than he looks. You should hear him swear.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, that\u2019s like the opposite of Kirishima. He\u2019s a lot nicer than he looks, right?\u201d says Ashido. \u201cAnd he\u2019s honestly pretty cute if you ignore the hair.\u201d\n\u201cThe bigger the hair, the closer to god,\u201d Aoyama says. \u201cBut he probably would be cute with it down. I wonder what he looks like in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYou would,\u201d says Tsuyu.\n\u201cOkay, weird question,\u201d says Hagakure suddenly. \u201cWhat about Iida?\u201d\n\u201cVanilla,\u201d the others say in unison.\n\u201cBut husband material,\u201d adds Aoyama.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cBut what if you pair super vanilla with super kinky? I mean, Iida and Midori\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d says Uraraka. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nAshido\u2019s mouth snaps shut. Uraraka\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t reach her eyes and Jirou, not very subtly, holds on tight to her chair.\nTsuyu clears her throat. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nYaoyorozu studiously avoids Uraraka\u2019s eyes. \u201cClass stuff.\u201d\n\u201cNeed any help?\u201d Uraraka perches on the edge of Ashido\u2019s desk, expression bright and hands folded neatly in her lap. Aoyama edges his seat away from her. \u201cYou should involve Iida, if it\u2019s class stuff. Should I call him?\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cSay, Ochako,\u201d says Hagakure cheerfully. Tsuyu would kick her in the shin, if she could find it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your ideal kind of guy?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Hmm. I\u2019d want someone sincere, and nice.\u201d\nAshido brightens up somewhat. \u201cWhat about his looks?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I dunno. I like muscles, though.\u201d\n\u201cThat describes most of the guys here,\u201d Hagakure says. \u201cWhich I would be happier about if they weren\u2019t, y\u2019know. Teenage boys.\u201d\n\u201cLesbian,\u201d says Jirou pointedly.\n\u201cNice and has muscles,\u201d says Tsuyu. \u201cThat kind of sounds like\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Aoyama, suddenly. He points to the back of the class, and the rest of them swivel around like a pack of superpowered meerkats. \u201cLook at that. Look at Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d says Yaoyorozu. Bakugou\u2019s standing at Todoroki\u2019 desk, hands in his pockets but arms tensed as though he\u2019s clenching his fists. Todoroki\u2019s shoulders are hanging out somewhere around his eyebrows. Neither of them are making eye contact. \u201cNot again. It\u2019s too early for another fight.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not fighting,\u201d says Aoyama, horrified. \u201cI think they\u2019re just talking.\u201d\nAshido leans forward to watch. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. Bakugou\u2019s been standing there for, like, ten minutes, and they haven\u2019t punched each other once.\u201d\n\u201cIs Mr Aizawa hiding somewhere?\u201d says Hagakure.\n\u201cNo, Iida would have seen him. He\u2019s physically incapable of ignoring authority,\u201d says Yaoyorozu.\n\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cThis is unnatural.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re not gonna fight,\u201d says Ashido, voice hushed. As they watch, Bakugou nods stiffly and shuffles back to his own seat. Todoroki stays where he is and grinds his teeth, but doesn\u2019t do anything more dramatic than that. \u201cBakugou\u2019s just going to go get his gauntlets. He\u2019ll come back and start yelling any minute now, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\nBakugou does not come back. He stays at his seat and frowns at his own reflection in the window. Aoyama gasps, and Jirou puts a comforting arm around his shoulder.\nThe spiky blond hair on Bakugou\u2019s head remains unpulled by Todoroki\u2019s fist no matter how long Tsuyu stares at it, so she turns away and focuses instead on Ashido\u2019s indiscreet dry-heaving. She\u2019s starting to feel a little light-headed herself.\n\u00a0\u201cHuh,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s it? Why aren\u2019t you as shook as the rest of us?\u201d Aoyama manages from the safety of Jirou\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0Uraraka blinks, and then smiles. \u201cNo reason. I just have a feeling this might start to make more sense soon.\u201d\n\u00a0Privately, Tsuyu disagrees. Then again, she doesn\u2019t get to think about it too hard, because all she can focus on is her intense feeling of vertigo until Iida starts his Monday lecture about good hygiene and the world finally starts to feel more normal again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not losing sight of your original goal,\u201d says Iida.\nIzuku flaps a hand at him and scribbles a little in his notebook. It\u2019s a pink one, this time, because, it\u2019s the closest thing to red that he\u2019d been able to find. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t approve of my project.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t. But I especially don\u2019t approve of leaving things half-done.\u201d They\u2019re sitting side-by-side, squeezed together on Izuku\u2019s chair so they can both see what he\u2019s writing. Izuku, perched on the very edge, leans into Iida\u2019s shoulder so he doesn\u2019t fall off.\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving anything half-done,\u201d he assures him. The page feels reassuringly smooth under his fingertips. He loves new stationary. \u201cCall it a side quest. I foresee this one being a lot more straightforward than the master plan.\u201d\n\u201cThe master plan of emotional manipulation.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cGod help us if you ever decide to become a villain,\u201d Iida sighs. Izuku snorts. The day Izuku turns to villainy is the day Kacchan suddenly decides he loves him.\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s pretty simple once you think about it. Kirishima and Tetsu are like the opposite of Kacchan and Todoroki; they get along great but they only see each other platonically. Therefore, all I really have to do is get them each alone and try introduce the idea of romance. Subtly,\u201d he adds, and underlines that for good measure. \u201cI already came on too strong at first. It would be weird if I just started following Tetsu around and pointing out how nice Kirishima\u2019s smile is. \u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI promise you that Kirishima would not be surprised if you did.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, they already compliment each other all the time,\u201d Izuku says wistfully. \u201cThey have a great relationship. I hope Kacchan and Todoroki end up like that someday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Iida says, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know if either of them swing that way. Kirishima and Tetsu, I mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cA bond like theirs transcends gender,\u201d Izuku says sagely, looking around his desk for his eraser. Iida points it out from behind Izuku\u2019s pencil sharpener. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ll find out for certain once I get them together.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got that backwards,\u201d says Iida, glancing up when the bell rings to signify the end of their lunch hour. Some stragglers make it through the class door a second later, and Iida rises with some difficulty to herd them back to their seats. \u201cI\u2019d tell you not to get into trouble, but thankfully these two are a bit less insane.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cSidequest,\u201d Izuku reminds him. He shuffles sideways so he can sit properly in his chair, and then frowns. \u201cHang on. You know you didn\u2019t say that about Kacchan and Todoroki. About which way they swing. You didn\u2019t question it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cCall it a hunch,\u201d says Iida. Izuku doesn\u2019t know why he rolls his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt least Kirishima\u2019s easier to deal with than Kacchan.\nIzuku drops hints. A lot of hints, actually, both to Kirishima and to Tetsu. Neither of them really seems to notice, but Izuku takes comfort in the fact that at least he doesn\u2019t have to worry about them trying to murder each other, or him, when he least expects it.\n\u201cTetsu\u2019s a good-looking guy,\u201d he says to Kirishima one day as they\u2019re waiting for Tetsu after school.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really cute too,\u201d says Kirishima earnestly.\n\u201cI hear Kirishima\u2019s great with kids,\u201d he tries again when he and Tetsu run into each other in the hallway.\n\u201cI promise you he\u2019ll make a great dad someday,\u201d says Tetsu, clapping him on the back.\n\u201cYou\u2019d work perfectly as a pair,\u201d he says meaningfully while they\u2019re waiting in line at the cafeteria.\n\u201cWay ahead of you,\u201d says Kirishima. \u201cWe\u2019re making a hero team when we graduate.\u201d\n\u201cThe He-Broes,\u201d says Tetsu. \u201cOr She-Broes, for girl members.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any girl members,\u201d says Kirishima, leaning into Tetsu\u2019s side. \u201cOr any other members.\u201d\n\u201cNot that we didn\u2019t try,\u201d says Tetsu, intertwining his fingers with Kirishima\u2019s. \u201cBut nobody else wanted to join.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d says Izuku, smiling into his lunch tray.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTenya feels them coming before he actually sees them.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not trying to rob me,\u201d he says mildly as Bakugou backs him up into a locker. School doesn\u2019t\u00a0 start for a good half hour, so nobody else has made it to the academic building. \u201cI\u2019d have to report you, and you\u2019ve already done detention once this month.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not robbing you,\u201d says Todoroki, although he has the good sense to tug Bakugou back by the shirt. \u201cWe just wanted to ask you something.\u201d\n\u201cLike what the fuck is going on with Deku,\u201d says Bakugou.\nTenya pushes his glasses up his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific. Midoriya does a lot of questionable things.\u201d\n\u201cI want to know why he has a notebook with Kirishima\u2019s name scrawled all over it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pink,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cYou must know, since you\u2019re with him all the time,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cAnd Uraraka was no damned help.\u201d\n\u201cShe laughed at us for ten minutes and wouldn\u2019t say why,\u201d Todoroki adds sullenly.\nTenya could probably guess why. \u201cIs there any reason you can\u2019t just ask Midoriya yourself?\u201d\nBakugou makes a face and breaks eye contact. Neither of them answer, and Tenya pinches the bridge of his nose because there are times when dealing with his classmates makes him physically feel himself ageing, and this is one of them. \u201cYou\u2019re like children.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll break your glasses.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever been kicked by a foot going seventy kilometres an hour?\u201d says Tenya mildly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t threaten Iida, you idiot.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me an idiot, my grades are better than yours\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cBecause you cheat off Izuku, I bet, and even then there are two people better than you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoys,\u201d says Tenya, very patiently, he thinks. \u201cI\u2019d sincerely like to help, but I really do think it\u2019s best that I don\u2019t get involved.\u201d\n\u201cBest for who?\u201d says Bakugou.\n\u201cWhom,\u201d says Tenya. \u201cAlso, me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re our only hope,\u201d Todoroki says in a manner that he probably thinks is imploring. His expression doesn\u2019t actually change, but Tenya appreciates the sentiment. \u201cWe just want to know what\u2019s going on with Izuku and Kirishima. Please.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a second of silence. Todoroki kicks Bakugou in the back of the knee.\n\u201c\u2026please,\u201d mutters Bakugou like it\u2019s hurting him.\nTenya\u2019s heartstrings twinge despite himself. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not whatever you\u2019re thinking. You would benefit from being more open and communicative, though. A lot of problems would be solved if people were more straightforward. And perhaps more observant,\u201d he adds as an afterthought.\nTodoroki and Bakugou share a brief look that does not reassure Tenya in the slightest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer anything,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cBut thanks, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank him,\u201d Bakugou rolls his eyes. \u201cYou and the baby-faced hyena are no help. Come on, you, we\u2019re gonna go investigating.\u201d\nTenya sighs. There is no point in encouraging open and honest dialogue between a glacier and a Molotov cocktail of bottled-up emotions. \u201cDon\u2019t involve Kirishima in your petty feud.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not petty,\u201d says Todoroki as Bakugou physically drags him away. \u201cBut we\u2019ll try.\u201d\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t,\u201d says Bakugou, which Tenya about expected, really.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t wanna come along, man?\u201d Kirishima asks, brows turned up like he\u2019s genuinely disappointed that Izuku doesn\u2019t want McDonald\u2019s. Which is understandable, actually. Izuku\u2019s usually always up for McDonalds, but they stopped giving out hero pens with their Happy Meals last month and Izuku isn\u2019t interested in collecting Hello Kitty merchandise.\n\u201cNo thanks, I don\u2019t want to third wheel,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSuit yourself, man,\u201d Tetsu shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ll be getting stickers without you.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll show you tomorrow,\u201d Kirishima says, throwing an arm around Tetsu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut we should probably get going before the work rush starts. Wanna share a McFlurry, bro?\u2019\n\u201cOnly if it\u2019s Oreo.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean Bro-reo?\u201d\n\u201cBro.\u201d\n\u201cBro.\u201d\nIzuku waves them off. The smile drops off his face once they\u2019re out of sight, and then his shoulders slump in defeat. \u201cI\u2019m getting nowhere.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up now.\u201d\nIzuku looks up. \u201cHitoshi? Is that you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says an air vent.\nIzuku squints, and can just make out a pair of purple eyes behind the grate. \u201cHow the heck did you get up there?\u201d\n\u201cDismantled an AC unit.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSo I could map out the air vents. They run all over the school. Neat, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Izuku says. There\u2019s a shuffling noise, and then a thump. \u201cAre you okay up there?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems I might be stuck.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, let me go find a ladder.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. There\u2019s one in the janitor\u2019s closet down the hall.\u201d\nHitoshi waits patiently for Izuku to poke around the supply cupboard until he can find what he needs. He carries it back over one shoulder, leans it against the wall and hopes it won\u2019t fall over while he\u2019s climbing up. \u201cCrap, this thing\u2019s screwed on.\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d A screwdriver pokes out from between the grills. Close up, Hitoshi\u2019s face is more clearly visible in the darkness, hair a little dusty from crawling around in the ceiling. \u201cSorry. I can\u2019t get at the screws from in here.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Izuku says. It\u2019s a flathead. A perfect fit.\n\u201cIs your project not going as well as you\u2019d like?\u201d\nA quick look around confirms that there\u2019s nobody in the corridor, everyone having gone home for the day. It\u2019s lucky that he keeps running into Hitoshi when school is deserted, Izuku thinks. \u201cThey\u2019re fun to be around, so I guess I can\u2019t complain about that. But subtlety isn\u2019t working on them.\u201d\n\u201cSubtlety? You were just going to ask Kirishima for some help with talking to Bakugou, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, at first, but I think he needs some help too. He\u2019s a great match for that friend of his, but I don\u2019t know how to make them see each other romantically. I\u2019ve tried pointing out what great boyfriends they would make. It isn\u2019t working.\u201d\nA little plaster comes loose along with the first screw. Izuku hands it to Hitoshi to hold on to. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised being subtle didn\u2019t work,\u201d says Hitoshi flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t know them but they seem like meatheads.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re very nice meatheads,\u201d Izuku says, smiling. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to come on too strong and freak them out. Plus, they\u2019ve got a great dynamic going on already. I\u2019d feel terrible if I made it weird for them, you know? Like, if I suggested they date each other when before they\u2019re ready, then that might make them feel awkward.\u00a0 Here, another screw.\u201d\n\u201cA great dynamic,\u201d Hitoshi muses. \u201cYour first subjects didn\u2019t get along at all.\u201d\n\u201cNope. Still don\u2019t, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re still using the same approach?\u201d\nIzuku frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t think I am. The first time around I tried to get them to spend time together. I also tried to get them to work together, as heroes, but I didn\u2019t factor in how competitive they can get for no reason.\u201d\n\u201cAnd subjects B?\u201d\n\u201cAlready spend all their time together, they just need a push in the right direction.\u201d\n\u201cSo they\u2019re fundamentally different. Your approach should be fundamentally different as well.\u201d\nThe third screw comes away, leaving the grate hanging precariously by one corner. \u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d\n\u201cYou tried to get subjects A together by making them spend time together, which is something they wouldn\u2019t do on their own,\u201d Hitoshi says, counting off his fingers. \u201cSubjects B already do that, so the same approach won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t been using the same approach, though.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been complimenting them, and I saw you send them off to McDonalds together. You\u2019re trying to push them together, but that\u2019s redundant because they do that all the time. You\u2019re not helping them change their dynamic. \u00a0Also, I thought you loved McDonalds.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got all the hero Happy Meal toys,\u201d Izuku says before gripping the screwdriver between his teeth. The grate comes off with an accompanying shower of plaster, and Hitoshi snakes an arm out to take the screwdriver back. \u201cHmm. When you put it like that, I guess I haven\u2019t varied my methods much.\u201d\n\u201cYou know them better than I do,\u201d Hitoshi says, poking his head out as Izuku leaps off the ladder. \u201cHowever, I would take comfort in the idea that their relationship is solid. It will likely stay that way even if you say accidentally say something awkward.\u201d\n\u201cThey are very stable,\u201d Izuku hums. Hitoshi shimmies halfway out of the vent, and Izuku holds both arms out to catch him. \u201cShould we put the grate back?\u201d\n\u201cLeave it open,\u201d Hitoshi says, falling neatly out of the ceiling and into Izuku\u2019s arms. \u201cI might need access later. I\u2019ll put the ladder back.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Releasing Hitoshi, Izuku picks his backpack up from where he\u2019d left it next to a locker. \u201cThanks for the talk, Hitoshi. I\u2019m gonna go rethink my angle like you said.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries. Sorry for getting plaster all over you. Wow, this thing is heavy.\u201d\n\u201cStrengthening quirk,\u201d Izuku grins. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\nHitoshi grunts at him and ambles off with the ladder dragging behind. The scrape of metal makes Izuku wince, but the cogs in his mind whir to life, and he\u2019s so lost in thought he almost walks right into a disassembled air conditioner on his way to the school entrance.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGuess what,\u201d says Ochako, hanging off Midoriya\u2019s back and only feeling slightly guilty when he yelps.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me like that!\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking,\u201d Ochako points out. \u201cYou were doing the Midoriya face.\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\nOchako puts her hand on her chin and furrows her brow. \u201cAssuming the height of All Might\u2019s hair is zero point five meters, remove that from his total height of two point five metres, that would mean I need to gain forty centimeters to reach him. My current daily calcium intake is one thousand two hundred milligrams, which can be safely increased to up to three thousand, which could give me a growth spurt of up to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, stop, I get it,\u201d Midoriya says, covering his face with both forearms like a kitten. \u201cI know I\u2019m embarrassing, you don\u2019t have to call me short while you\u2019re at it. Also, All Might\u2019s height is two hundred and twenty centimeters without the hair.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cute,\u201d Ochako says, gleefully watching Midoriya\u2019s ears turn red. \u201cBut you should probably pay attention to what\u2019s around you. Which is incidentally what I wanted to tell you about.\u201d\nCuriosity wins. Midoriya peeks at her from behind his arms, and Ochako leans their heads together so they won\u2019t be overheard. Everyone\u2019s busy getting ready for homeroom, though, so nobody really pays them attention except Bakugou, who shoots her a truly poisonous look. She gives him a sunny smile and leans in even closer.\n\u201cHave you been watching Bakugou and Todoroki recently? Maybe noticed anything different?\u201d\nMidoriya frowns. \u201cI\u2019ve been a little distracted. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Ochako grins, drumming on the table in excitement. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint: when was the last time you saw them fight?\u201d\n\u201cSome time last week,\u201d Midoriya says slowly. \u201cBut the frequency seems to have gone down, come to think of it.\u201d\nOchako claps her hands. \u201cI saw them talking the other day. Just talking, at, like, a normal volume.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says Midoriya. It\u2019s impressive how quickly he changes gears; the pinkness has gone from his cheeks, leaving only freckles behind. \u201cSo their hostility has decreased. Interesting.\u00a0 Could it be that the plan worked after all? Maybe their inability to co-operate as heroes has made them realise the need to get over themselves.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing the Midoriya face again,\u201d Ochako says helpfully. He doesn\u2019t hear her, though, so she laughs, ruffles his hair, and makes sure to give Bakugou an extra smug smile as she makes her way back to her seat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cA fundamental difference to my approach,\u201d says Izuku to his All Might alarm clock. It doesn\u2019t answer him. Izuku would be rather surprised if it did, to be honest, but at this point the help would not go unappreciated.\nThe pillow makes a pomf noise when he flops back onto it, hair still wet from the shower and stomach full from dinner. He has homework to do. Doesn\u2019t feel like looking at it, though, so he\u2019ll put if off until later and probably stay up way past midnight. \u201cKacchan and Todoroki are starting to get along. Having them spend time together may be a workable solution. But, their relationship is only at level one. Kirishima and Tetsu are at level eight. Maybe they\u2019d need a different kind of push.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been hinting at romance, though,\u201d he sighs, rolling over to pout at the wall. It doesn\u2019t answer him either. \u201cI keep saying Kirishima\u2019s handsome, you\u2019d think Tetsu would have gotten the message by now.\u201d\nExcept that their relationship is already bordering on homoerotic, so Tetsu probably thought Kirishima was beautiful to begin with. Hitoshi\u2019s right. They\u2019re so used to complimenting each other that nothing Izuku says could surprise them. Izuku had called them soulmates and neither of them batted an eye.\nWhat can he do, then? Get them both naked and lock them in a room? No, that would be criminal. Have them take a bath together? They probably already do that. Give one roses and pretend it\u2019s from the other? Possible, but Tetsu had mentioned having a pollen allergy or something.\n\u201cWhy did I think this would be the easy side quest?\u201d Izuku makes a face as he runs his fingers through his bangs. He should have dried his hair. He\u2019s left a damp spot on the pillowcase that\u2019s going to seep into the pillow and give him acne, or something. He doesn\u2019t need acne. The freckles are already bad enough.\nHe sits up, grumbling like a grandpa, and then gets briefly spooked when his foot nudges something solid and smooth. It\u2019s a shoebox. Nikes, of course, stuffed haphazardly under his bed and half-wrapped in a plastic bag because the box had had All Might on it and he hadn\u2019t wanted to throw it away. He\u2019s never worn the shoes, either. They\u2019ve been sitting on a special shelf in his cupboard ever since his mother bought them as a gift for getting into UA.\nThe plastic bag goes in the trash and the box goes onto the shelf as a stand for the shoes. They look like a store display, and All Might and the Nike logo stare at him from the one clean shelf in a nest of tacky size M shirts.\n\u201cJust do it,\u201d he says, and then lights up when inspiration strikes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKirishima!\u201d Izuku says way too loudly for a Friday morning.\nKirishima pauses with a Pocky stick in his mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCan you follow me to the locker right now immediately! I, uh, need help carrying something.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a strengthening quirk?\u201d asks Kirishima.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t,\u201d says Bakugou, tackling him to the ground.\nIzuku takes advantage of the chaos to hook his fingers into Kirishima\u2019s collar and drag him out of the room, checking furtively over his shoulder that they\u2019re not being followed. \u201cListen, I have something to say to you and it\u2019s very important.\u201d\nKirishima clears his throat. They come to a stop outside of the lockers, where the last of the morning rush is making its way to class. \u201cI\u2019ve been preparing myself for this. Lay it on me, man. I\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should date Tetsu,\u201d Izuku says in a rush.\nKirishima stares at him. \u201cWhat,\u201d he says, which, okay, that\u2019s fair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect for each other,\u201d Izuku presses on, taking Kirishima\u2019s larger hand in his. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a couple so compatible. If you want to stay friends, that\u2019s absolutely fine, but have you ever considered romance? You could be married someday. You\u2019d be the ultimate power couple.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Kirishima says a little plaintively. \u201cThis is kind of out of left field, dude. What about you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about,\u201d Kirishima gestures vaguely with the hand that\u2019s not being held captive by Izuku. \u201cYou know, us? Isn\u2019t that what this whole thing was about? You joining the squad? If Tetsu and I get together, what happens to you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Izuku says earnestly. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be friends, right? We\u2019ll see each other all the time. But you and Tetsu, you make each other so happy. Everyone can see that. The decision is yours, of course, but I just thought I\u2019d tell you what I think, because it looks like you guys haven\u2019t considered the idea of being together. And you\u2019re a great person, so all I want is for you to be happy, and Tetsu can do that better than anyone else, and \u2014 why are you crying?\u201d\n\u201cEvery day you become more of a man,\u201d says Kirishima, wrapping both arms around Izuku\u2019s shoulders so he can sob into his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re the bravest man I know, Midoriya. So selfless. So pure.\u201d\nMystified, Izuku pats him. \u201cThere, there, there\u2019s no need to cry. But, look, just think about it, okay?\u201d\nKirishima gives him a truly terrific sniffle. He pulls away, though, scrubbing at his face with the sleeve of his blazer. His nose is blotchy and red. \u201cYou really think I should date Tetsu?\u201d\n\u201cYes! At the very least, give it a shot.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. Tetsu\u2019s my bro, you know?\u201d\n\u201cHe could be your bro and more!\u201d Izuku says, gesturing wide. \u201cYou could have a bromance. That\u2019s a romance between bros.\u201d\n\u201cI guess?\u201d\n\u201cAnd Tetsu\u2019s super handsome!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a knockout.\u201d\n\u201cHe thinks you are too,\u201d Izuku continues. \u201cAnd he\u2019s manly, and, and, he shares all of your hobbies, and you can celebrate your birthday together, and your family already likes him.\u201d\n\u201cThey love him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so do you! Platonically, at the moment, but maybe also romantically at some point. The point is, he\u2019s basically the ideal boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cNot to be heteronormative,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that, like, mad gay?\u201d\nIzuku pauses. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m really committed to the macho aesthetic.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Izuku. \u201cOkay, sure. But consider this. You\u2019re a man. Tetsu\u2019s a man.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s twice the men. Double the manliness.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s even better than the standard amount of manliness,\u201d Kirishima says, eyes sparkling as the possibilities dawn on him. \u201cAnd we can smooch.\u201d\n\u201cAll you want!\u201d Izuku beams. \u00a0\u201cHave you ever wanted to smooch Tetsu?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Kirishima shrugs as though Izuku had just asked if Kacchan had anger issues. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you ask him to smooch?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he says no?\u201d Kirishima deflates. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want to be my bro anymore?\u201d\n\u201cYou both seem very comfortable in your masculinity,\u201d Izuku reasons. \u201cToo comfortable, maybe. Would he really get upset if you told him you liked him more than he thought you did?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Kirishima. \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t. Our bond is stronger than rock. Stronger than steel!\u201d\n\u201cSo just,\u201d Izuku says, squeezing Kirishima\u2019s face in a moment of passion and giving him unflattering fish lips. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\n\u201cAre you quoting the Nike slogan at me?\u201d\n\u201cYou can be best friends and boyfriends! You can be soulmates!\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d says Kirishima, eyes still glistening with unshed tears and hope. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give this a shot. For your sake, I\u2019m gonna go ask Tetsu out, like a man.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Izuku cries. Kirishima shouts in tandem, and they stand there in the corridor hyping each other up and riding the endorphin high until the bell for homeroom rings and they have to sprint back to class so Aizawa doesn\u2019t give them detention.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBro!\u201d roars Kirishima much later, bursting into the 1-B classroom and startling Monoma into dropping his lunch money. \u201cBro, where are you? I need to ask you something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, bro,\u201d Tetsu says, standing up. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Are we going to the cafeteria?\u201d\n\u201cCome with me for a sec,\u201d Kirishima says, and drags Tetsu by the hand into the boys\u2019 bathroom. Nobody\u2019s in there right now, and Tetsu scratches the back of his neck and leans against the sink.\n\u201cI know we haven\u2019t actually established any boundaries in our relationship but I dunno if I can help you pee, man.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, bro,\u201d says Kirishima, a fire in his eyes and fingers tangling themselves in Tetsu\u2019s blazer. \u201cI wanna erase all boundaries with you, bro.\u201d\n\u201cBro?\u201d\n\u201cI wanna make you my boyfriend. My significant other. My significant bruh-ther.\u201d\n\u201cBro,\u201d Tetsu says in awe, wrapping his arms around Kirishima\u2019s waist. \u201cAre you for real? You wanna date?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Nothing has to change, bro. We\u2019ll still be best buds, but we can totally bang.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god. You\u2019re super hot, I\u2019m super hot, that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\u201cRight? Midoriya suggested it.\u201d\n\u201cRight on, Midoriya. But wait,\u201d Tetsu says, frowning deeply. \u201cIsn\u2019t being boyfriends totally gay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, bro,\u201d says Kirishima, bouncing in excitement. \u201cBut I thought about it, bro. Listen. What if,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat if, we just say no homo when we\u2019re about to make out?\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d says Tetsu in relief. \u201cGreat idea, bro. That\u2019s okay then.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re dating?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah we are.\u201d\n\u201cNice,\u201d says Kirishima, reaching up to tangle his fingers gently in Tetsu\u2019s hair. Tetsu\u2019s arms tighten around him, and Kirishima nuzzles his new boyfriend\u2019s nose with delight.\n\u201cNo homo,\u201d he says, leaning closer to press his lips against the corner of Tetsu\u2019s mouth. \u201cFull bromo.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA little green book of secrets. That\u2019s what they\u2019d called him.\nToru rests her chin on her hands and stares hard at the back of Midoriya\u2019s fluffy head. The whole invisibility thing can be annoying sometimes, but it does come with a few perks; her body image issues tend to be pretty straightforward, for one, considering\u00a0 her body doesn\u2019t actually have an image. She doesn\u2019t need to wear makeup (she\u2019d tried, once, but then she\u2019d just looked like a floating pair of lips). And she can stare at pretty much anyone without them noticing. Like now. Midoriya has no idea he\u2019s being watched.\nThen again, Midoriya\u2019s not always the most observant. Bakugou and Todoroki are living proof of that.\n\u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d says Ashido, gesturing for emphasis, \u201cthat size is one of the cornerstones of a successful dick down.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no problems that can\u2019t be solved with a little ingenuity,\u201d Aoyama retorts. \u201cThe toy industry has come a long way, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cYou should reconsider your heteronormative views on sex, Ashido. Dicks aren\u2019t everything,\u201d says Jirou loftily.\nAshido rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d take you seriously if you weren\u2019t trying not to laugh. Anyway, you know I\u2019m talking specifically about people in possession of a pocket rocket.\u201d\n\u201cI will pay you to never say that again.\u201d\n\u201cPocket rocket,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cWomb raider, love lance, manaconda, cocktopus\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRumpleforeskin\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d Aoyama cuts in, \u201cyou don\u2019t win a battle based on brute strength alone. A successful warrior is someone with ingenuity and creativity.\u201d\n\u201cLike Midoriya,\u201d says Toru.\nAoyama looks over his shoulder, and then brightens up. \u201cActually, that\u2019s a great example. That boy hasn\u2019t hit his growth spurt yet, but I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t let that stop him from having a great time.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure he hasn\u2019t hit his growth spurt?\u201d Ashido hums. She looks like she wants to put her feet on Jirou\u2019s desk, but aborts the movement because Iida will no doubt give her an earful. \u201cMidoriya is full of surprises.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s compact!\u201d says Toru. \u201cDense but powerful.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an absolutely terrible mental image that you\u2019re giving me,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s deficient,\u201d Aoyama waves a delicate hand. \u201cI\u2019m saying he\u2019s probably proportionate. He\u2019s only, what, a hundred and sixty centimeters? Now, if he were built like, say, Iida\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOr Koda,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cOr Satou,\u201d says Ashido.\n\u201cOr Shoji,\u201d says Toru.\nAoyama pauses. \u201cNow there\u2019s an idea. He can turn his extra arms into anything, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a freak,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cBut Midoriya has the energy of someone, y\u2019know, gifted,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cAlthough I do see what you\u2019re saying, he\u2019s pretty petite.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s thick,\u201d says Toru, looking away to observe Midoriya closely. He\u2019s perched on the corner of Iida\u2019s chair, dwarfed but not overshadowed, laughing about something he\u2019s just said. Uraraka hasn\u2019t arrived yet, which is the only reason they\u2019re having this conversation. \u201cLike, overall.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a valid point, actually,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cThickness is where it\u2019s really at.\u201d\n\u201cBut we all agree that Midoriya would know what he\u2019s doing, if you give him a little practice,\u201d Aoyama says. \u201cWe just need to figure out what his strong suit is. Thickness or length, or creativity.\u201d\n\u201cThickness, I\u2019m sure,\u201d says Toru.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing that,\u201d says Aoyama.\n\u201cJust look at him!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that doesn\u2019t prove anything, not until you check for certain.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, thickness!\u201d says Toru with gusto. \u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d says Midoriya from across the class.\nJirou smacks Toru on the arm. \u201cGood going, dummy. Try talking louder next time, maybe you can fill in for Present Mic.\u201d\nToru wonders if it would be prudent to take all her clothes off and flee. Midoriya makes a little huffy noise as he gets off the chair and ambles over, expression cheerful and slightly confused. \u201cDid you call me? What are you guys talking about?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d says Ashido.\n\u201cOjiro\u2019s tail,\u201d says Jirou.\nMidoriya\u2019s eyebrows furrow, and he glances in Ojiro\u2019s direction. \u201cWell, I guess it is pretty thick. If you compare it to your average animal tail, I mean. \u201d\nAoyama grins. \u201cWe just wanted your opinion on things, since you\u2019re analytical. Which d\u2019you think if more important, thickness or length?\u201d\nToru discreetly kicks his shin, but it\u2019s too late now. Ashido\u2019s already pulling up a chair for him. \u201cI say thickness, myself. I just think it gives you better grip,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly muscle, as far as I know,\u201d Midoriya says, perching on the edge of the seat. He\u2019s still a little unsure, but he relaxes slowly as thoughts come to him. \u201cI think his build means he utilises power over reach.\u201d\n\u201cHe excels at close contact situations,\u201d Jirou agrees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fairly flexible, though,\u201d Midoriya points out. \u201cHis tail is completely prehensile. At least, I think it is. The last time I saw him spar, he got pinned. That surprised me, actually, since martial arts are supposed to be his strong suit.\u201d\n\u201cOh, really? I didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d says Ashido, fighting to keep a straight face. \u201cI just can\u2019t picture him going down.\u201d\nAoyama reaches across the desk and pats her on the shoulder. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be too hard on him, he\u2019s probably just a little stiff.\u201d\n\u201cHe had such a great winning streak,\u201d sighs Ashido. \u201cD\u2019you think he just couldn\u2019t keep it up?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should see if he\u2019s doing okay,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cAsk him deep, penetrating questions, and all that. Really pump him for answers.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just one spar,\u201d Midoriya says, a little mystified. Toru, with no fear of being seen, stuffs her fist against her mouth to keep from giggling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need to go to that extent. Although, I guess it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re so invested in his progress.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t do anything drastic,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll think about our actions long and hard.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. What brought this on, anyway?\u201d Midoriya asks, head sweetly tilted. \u201cAnd why\u2019d you need me?\u2019\nJirou points in Toru\u2019s direction. \u201cHagakure\u2019s really interested in Ojiro\u2019s tail.\u201d\n\u201cHey! I am not!\u201d\n\u201cShe sure is,\u201d says Aoyama, ignoring her. \u201cWon\u2019t stop talking about it. We just wanted the opinion of the expert hero observer.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Midoriya, scratching his cheek awkwardly. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m any sort of expert.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, you\u2019ve been a great help,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cToru really wanted to hear what you had to say.\u201d\nToru pinches her, glad that nobody can see how warm her face is getting. \u201cStop bullying me!\u201d\n\u201cSorry for interrupting you, Midoriya,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cYou were chatting with Iida, right? We won\u2019t keep you any longer.\u201d\n\u201cUhm, okay,\u201d Midoriya says, chair scraping as he stands. \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t say anything more worthwhile, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d says Jirou seriously. \u201cRest assured, your opinion made a vas deferens.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nToru whines the moment Midoriya\u2019s out of earshot. \u201cWhy did you tell him I was interested in Ojiro\u2019s tail, of all things? He\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m some sort of weirdo!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the idiot who went and got his attention,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for yelling in class.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d\n\u201cThere, there, Midoriya\u2019s very unassuming,\u201d Aoyama says cajolingly. \u201cHe knows what it\u2019s like to be interested in quirks, I doubt he\u2019ll think it\u2019s weird. In fact he\u2019ll forget about it by lunchtime.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me,\u201d grumbles Toru.\n\u201cI\u2019m not laughing,\u201d Aoyama says, and then giggles.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pout,\u201d Ashido says, grinning wide. \u201cThat was a close call. It\u2019s a shame we never did get our answer, though. I guess we\u2019ll just have to hear second hand from whichever lucky person manages to seduce Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI volunteer,\u201d says Aoyama.\n\u201cHe\u2019s out of your league,\u201d Jirou snorts.\n\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Aoyama sighs. \u201cA man can dream, though. I live my life in the hope of being gently cradled in those burly arms.\u201d\n\u201cHe does have nice arms,\u201d says Ashido. \u201cBut his heart\u2019s his biggest muscle.\u201d\n\u201cKind of like Ojiro\u2019s tail,\u201d Jirou says, and Toru kicks her too for good measure.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Tenya. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t even said anything yet,\u201d says Uraraka, putting her backpack down on her desk.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Tenya, pointing at Midoriya\u2019s face. Midoriya\u2019s happy, freckled face. \u201cI know that look. He\u2019s got another terrible idea in that fluffy head of his and I already know I\u2019m against it.\u201d\n\u201cBut Iida,\u201d Mirodiya says, clutching his sleeve. Uraraka clutches his other sleeve, because she likes to make him suffer. \u201cShe likes his tail.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about Hagakure,\u201d Midoriya says as though this is somehow obvious. \u201cI was chatting with her and the others this morning. They wanted my opinion on Ojiro\u2019s tail, because Hagakure\u2019s obsessed with it, apparently.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the kind of information you should be spreading,\u201d says Tenya, going slightly pink.\n\u201cShe\u2019s worried about his performance, that\u2019s all. I mentioned that he lost his last sparring match against Shoji. They were all concerned, I guess, but they singled out Hagakure specifically. Asked some really specific questions about length and thickness and how that would affect his performance in close contact.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of conversation was this, exactly?\u201d asks Uraraka, eyes narrowing.\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d says Midoriya urgently, shaking Tenya\u2019s arm, \u201cthat she obviously likes him. Why else would she be so thorough?\u201d\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cEven if she feels that way,\u201d says Tenya, willing himself not to crumble when Midoriya looks at him imploringly, \u201cwhich you\u2019re not sure about, might I add, that doesn\u2019t mean she would want you to meddle. Also, I\u2019m not sure if you remember that you have a strengthening quirk but I can no longer feel my right arm.\u201d\nMidoriya lets go hastily (Uraraka does not). \u201cOkay, but, have you considered the fact that they opportunity is literally right there and it would be a crime not to help them out?\u201d\n\u201cYou keep saying that!\u201d Tenya complains. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken on two similar projects already and now you\u2019re eyeing these two. You\u2019ve gone mad with power, Midoriya.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s eyes glint in a way that makes Tenya nervous. \u201cOh, but I haven\u2019t. I said my last side quest would be easy, remember?\u201d\n\u201cNo way,\u201d says Uraraka gleefully. \u201cDid you get Kirishima and Tetsu together?\u201d\n\u201cI did, before the weekend, and they\u2019re the happiest couple I\u2019ve ever seen. And now that I\u2019ve finished that task, I\u2019m ready to move on to the next.\u201d\nTenya\u2019s kind of impressed despite himself. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a week or so since you started, I thought.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t doubt Deku-kun,\u201d Uraraka grins. \u201cHe\u2019s unstoppable when he puts his mind to something.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I want to help them,\u201d Midoriya says, fixing Tenya with his dewy green stare. \u201cLike a hero should.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to get in the way of hero work, are you?\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cThat would be uncharitable,\u201d says Midoriya. \u201cThat would be downright villainous.\u201d\n\u201cI would never!\u201d Tenya protests. \u201cBut I\u2019m really not sure that this counts as hero work\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s doing it so responsibly,\u201d Uraraka adds. \u201cSystematically.\u201d\n\u201cGetting one couple out of the way before moving onto the next,\u201d Midoriya agrees. \u201cFormulating a plan of attack to help those in romantic need.\u201d\n\u201cNo lovers left behind.\u201d\n\u201cAnd submitting all my homework on time while I\u2019m at it.\u201d\n\u201cAll of your homework?\u201d asks Tenya. \u201cNo late assignments? No staff complaints?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d says Midoriya, popping the \u2018p\u2019. \u201cAnd I got a 97 on our last modern literature essay.\u201d\n\u201cThat was your weakest subject,\u201d says Tenya. \u201cWell done!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great example, isn\u2019t he?\u201d says Uraraka.\nTenya nods enthusiastically, glasses slipping down his nose. \u201cYour attitude is admirable, Midoriya! Why, if the rest of us had half of your drive and initiative, we\u2019d all graduate early.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Midoriya beams. \u201cSo I\u2019ll get to work on Hagakure and Ojiro as soon as I collect some more notes.\u201d\n\u201cWait, that isn\u2019t what I meant\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSee you later, Iida,\u201d Midoriya beams, getting up to skip gaily back to his seat. \u201cI can hear Mr Aizawa\u2019s sleeping bag squeaking outside, I should go get ready for homeroom.\u00a0 Thanks for giving me your blessing.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cJust let it go,\u201d Uraraka says, patting him gently on the shoulder. \u201cYou know he\u2019d do it whether or not you said no.\u201d\n\u201cI take it back,\u201d Tenya says slowly. \u201cEvery single one of Midoriya\u2019s problems are in some way his own fault. If the rest of us tried to be like him we\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d says Uraraka. From the back of the class, Todoroki throws a paper airplane at Bakugou\u2019s head. Bakugou, without breaking eye contact, puts it in his mouth, chews, and swallows. \u201cBut it\u2019s Deku. Someone up there is looking out for him, even through his poor life choices.\u201d\nTenya wishes he could say the same for himself. Uraraka finally lets go of his arm, and Tenya wonders if Mr Aizawa will let him skip homeroom so he can run to the store for some aspirin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the love of Tetsu\u2019s life is standing in line for cheese snacks.\nSomething thumps him on the back of the head. It feels kind of like a fist, and while Tetsu is no stranger to being punched he does tend to shrug off any impact smaller than a car crash, so he waits until the second punch before he actually looks up. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cHey, asshole. Where\u2019s your other, stupider half?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s Brodoroki and Bakubro. Or would Brokugou be better?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m neither of those things,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cAnd I sure as hell ain\u2019t your bro.\u201d\n\u201cKirishima,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m Tetsu,\u201d says Tetsu.\nBakugou squeezes his eyes shut and counts to five. \u201cOkay, I take it back. You\u2019re clearly the stupider half.\u201d\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\nBakugou breathes out very loudly. Todoroki takes a seat opposite Tetsu. Kaminari, who is the only other person at the lunch table, silently gets up and walks away. \u201cYou spend a lot of time around Kirishima.\u201d\n\u201cNot enough, man. I\u2019d spend every minute with him if I could.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d says Bakugou, turning a chair around so he can sit on it backwards. It\u2019s pretty cool-looking. Tetsu should try that one day. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\u201cSeventh in line at the snack stand,\u201d Tetsu says immediately, because he hasn\u2019t actually taken his eyes off his man ever since they tragically parted twelve minutes ago. \u201cBut someone\u2019s trying to buy sixteen cake pops. Why not just get a whole cake slice?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be occupied for a while,\u201d says Bakugou to Todoroki. \u201cWe can use this idiot in the meantime. Listen, I want to know what Kirishima\u2019s deal is.\u201d\nTetsu perks up. He likes talking about Kirishima. \u201cWell he\u2019s handsome, and manly, and kind\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, you fucking fool. I mean his connection to Deku. They\u2019ve been attached at the hip all this week, I want to know what the fuck is going on.\u201d\nTetsu frowns. \u201cWho\u2019s Deku?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d says Torodoki.\n\u201cNo way, his first name is Deku?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Izuku,\u201d says Todoroki while Bakugou clenches his fists. \u201cWhich is not the point. What is the relationship between Kirishima and Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re bros. We\u2019re all bros, in fact. We went to McDonalds together and Midoriya gave Kiri the Crimson Riot pen from his Happy Meal because he already had one. I\u2019d say they\u2019re pretty tight.\u201d\n\u201cFucking Deku,\u201d says Bakugou.\n\u201cDon\u2019t jump to conclusions, he doesn\u2019t need two pens. It might not mean anything,\u201d says Todoroki quietly. \u201cWhen did this friendship start?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a week ago, after Midoriya asked for Kiri\u2019s number.\u201d\nThe table cracks a little under Bakugou\u2019s grip. \u201cHe did, did he? \u2018Might not mean anything\u2019 my ass.\u201d\n\u201cLet him finish,\u201d says Todoroki.\nTetsu scratches his ear. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s big on texting, Kiri said. It\u2019s cool, though. He\u2019s real supportive, and he really gets Kiri, y\u2019know? I mean, not as much as I do, obviously, but he\u2019s the one who suggested the whole dating thing. It never would have crossed Kiri\u2019s mind if Midoriya hadn\u2019t brought it up, but Midoriya said he knew it would make Kiri happy\u2014 hey, Brodoroki, I didn\u2019t know you could make steam. You\u2019re like a one man sauna!\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re taunting us,\u201d says Bakugou, dropping the large chunk of high-pressure laminate he\u2019s somehow managed to break off. \u201cYou better fucking not be, troglodyte.\u201d\nTetsu blinks. \u201cIt\u2019s Tetsu.\u201d\nTodoroki grabs the back of Bakugou\u2019s shirt just as he lunges across the table. \u201cLeave it, it\u2019s not worth the suspension,\u201d he says with an uncomfortably straight face. \u201cCome on, we have to have a discussion in private.\u201d\nHe drags Bakugou away kicking and snarling like a wild animal. Tetsu deactivates his quirk and watches them go, frown only dissipating when Kirishima puts a hand on his shoulder and offers him a view of the snack haul. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d says Tetsu, opening his mouth so Kirishima can feed him a chip. \u201cYour friends seem to really care about you, though. Bakubro was super mean to me. And he might have threatened me, so I think that means I just got the shovel talk.\u201d\n\u201cThe shovel talk? Really? That\u2019s weird,\u201d Kirishima says, plopping down next to him. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually told them we were dating.\u201d\n\u201cMust have figured it out themselves,\u201d Tetsu says, kissing his cheek. \u201cAll your friends are so smart. They asked a lot about Midoriya, too, for some reason.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah that makes sense. They\u2019re both basically obsessed with him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s why they fight all the time, but it\u2019s nice they came together just to look out for me. I\u2019m so happy they care,\u201d Kirishima sighs. \u201cWant some of my brotein shake? It\u2019s strawberry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks. Why wouldn\u2019t they care about you? You\u2019re basically perfect and the most valuable human being in existence.\u201d\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Kirishima says, clearly delighted. \u201cThat\u2019s you, babe.\u201d\n\u201cBabe,\u201d says Tetsu, heart soaring. \u201cThat\u2019s even better than bro.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d says Kirishima, shyly leaning into his side. \u201cI just thought about it last night.\u201d\n\u201cMan, we\u2019re so in love.\u201d\n\u201cWe sure are,\u201d says Kirishima. \u201cBy the way, what happened to our table?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am in so much trouble,\u201d Toru says, plastering herself onto Aoyama\u2019s desk the moment she steps through the classroom door two days later.\nAoyama\u2019s got one shoe off and is painting his toenails purple. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d says Toru dramatically. \u201cIt\u2019s,\u201d she says, and then lowers her voice to a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya.\u201d\nAoyama pauses. The fourth toe on his right foot remains half-naked, and he raises one eyebrow and sits back. \u201cWhat\u2019s Midoriya? He can\u2019t be causing you trouble, he\u2019s an angel.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014did you see him yesterday? He followed me around all of lunch, and you know what he talked about? Ojiro.\u201d\nThe acrid smell of nail polish lessens when he puts the brush back in the bottle, and Aoyama wiggles his toes as they dry. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why! It\u2019s because you and the idiot brigade told him I was obsessed with Ojiro\u2019s tail, and now he\u2019s probably trying to be supportive because he thinks I\u2019m some kind of tail fetishist. Or, or, he figured out what we were talking about earlier and he\u2019s trying to catch me out, oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cNow why would he be trying to catch you out specifically?\u201d Aoyama says, scooching over so Toru can share his chair. Toru bristles at the knowledge that he\u2019s not taking this as seriously as he should be.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m the weakest link? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not good at coming up with excuses on the fly. I\u2019m useless, I\u2019ll let it slip.\u201d\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d says Aoyama. \u201cYou\u2019re not useless, you\u2019re great. You have that something about you, that je ne sais quoi.\u201d\n\u201cWill you stop speaking French?\u201d\n\u201cI am French.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re part white and you\u2019ve been to France once.\u201d\nAoyama harrumphs. \u201cFrance is a state of being and I have the soul of a chain-smoking fashionable Parisian. Anyway, you\u2019re jumping to the worst conclusion. Maybe Midoriya\u2019s just trying to hang out with you, you know how he is with his aggressive friendship.\u201d\nToru wrinkles her nose. \u201cWhy keep talking about Ojiro?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he thinks you like his fighting style?\u201d Aoyama offers. \u201cWhich is our fault, granted, but it\u2019s harmless. Maybe he\u2019s trying to find something you have in common, is all. Hell, maybe he\u2019s interested in Ojiro.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he likes Ojiro?\u201d \n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t mean it like that, but go off, I guess.\u201d His toenails appear to be dry, so he gets to work on a clear top coat. \u201cHey, maybe he just likes you.\u201d\nToru gasps. Aoyama flaps a hand at her and tells her to quiet down. \u201cI was only joking, Midoriya\u2019s nice to everyone.\u201d\n\u201cBut yesterday he asked me what I looked for in a guy,\u201d Toru whispers. \u201cThe only other person who\u2019s ever asked me that was Kaminari.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aoyama says, looking thoughtful. \u201cWell, maybe he does like you. Wait a week and see if his behaviour seems suspicious. You know what this means, right?\u201d\n\u201cThat I should start making plans for Valentine\u2019s day?\u201d Toru says, turning pink (probably).\n\u201cIt means,\u201d says Aoyama. \u201cThat you might be the one to finally answer the question that\u2019s been plaguing us all year.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\nAoyama comes closer. \u201cWhat does his dick look like?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Toru yelps and pushes him away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to find that out.\u201d\n\u201cFind what out?\u201d asks Ashido, stepping through the door with Jirou behind her. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Iida yelling at you for painting your nails in class?\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019d come to his house at night and paint his pink if he bothered me,\u201d Aoyama says breezily. \u201cHagakure\u2019s going to be the one to look at Midoriya\u2019s dick.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\n\u201cOh, are you gonna spy on him?\u201d Ashido says, perching on the edge of the table. \u201cBecause that\u2019s a little illegal.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks Midoriya likes her.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said that,\u201d Toru retorts. \u201cAnd you also said he might like Ojiro.\u201d\n\u201cOjiro\u2019s a good catch,\u201d says Ashido.\n\u201cIf he dates Ojiro then we can just ask him,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cNo, Ojiro\u2019s a gentleman, he wouldn\u2019t kiss and tell,\u201d says Aoyama.\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Toru whines, clutching Ashido\u2019s leg. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m being serious here. I\u2019m scared he\u2019s suspicious that we\u2019ve been talking about him or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d says Ashido. \u201cWe talk about all the guys, and I\u2019m pretty sure they talk about us.\u201d\n\u201cThey better not be,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cI\u2019m off-limits, and so\u2019s Momo.\u201d\nAoyama snorts. \u201cMaybe he thinks Hagakure\u2019s got the hots for Ojiro and he\u2019s trying to bring them together.\u201d\n\u201cShe does love his big strong tail,\u201d Ashido says, fluttering her lashes.\nToru smacks Ashido\u2019s thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb! What am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cSeduce him,\u201d says Ashido, matter of fact. \u201cFind our answers once and for all, but don\u2019t be too obvious about it. Don\u2019t make him suspect you have ulterior motives.\u201d\n\u201cAlternatively, be super upfront about your ulterior motives,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cTell him you wanna smash and be done with it, that way he knows what he\u2019s in for.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, ask if you can take photos,\u201d Aoyama suggests. \u201cOr at least bring a measuring tape or something.\u201d\nToru puts her face in her hands. \u201cWhy did I think you guys would be helpful?\u201d\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d says Aoyama, patting her on the shoulder. Unlike the others, he has the decency not to laugh at her too loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking things. Like I said, he probably just wants to be friends with you. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he had a chart somewhere with friendship meters drawn on them. He probably just thinks he hasn\u2019t filled your positivity quota yet.\u201d\n\u201cOr he likes you,\u201d says Jirou. \u201cOr Ojiro.\u201d\n\u201cOr both,\u201d says Ashido helpfully. \u201cPolyamoury\u2019s great, as long as it\u2019s transparent and consensual.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Hagakure\u2019s the most transparent one of us all,\u201d says Jirou.\n\u201cI hate you guys,\u201d says Toru with feeling.\n\u201cAw, we\u2019re only kidding around,\u201d says Aoyama. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t mean it.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d says Toru morosely.\n\u201cReally,\u201d says Aoyama, clapping her on the shoulder. \u201cExcept for one part.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d\n\u201cI really, really want to see Mirodiya\u2019s dick.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re heroes,\u201d says Todoroki in a quiet, measured voice. \u201cWe\u2019d never make it past first year if they knew.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Bakugou growls, tossing a pebble up and down in his hands. Caresses it, as though he\u2019s trying to memorise its consistency. \u201cAre you saying it\u2019s not worth it?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Todoroki replies. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is we can\u2019t get caught.\u201d\nSilently, Koda shuts the door and decides he\u2019ll go find another bathroom to use.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou smell happy,\u201d says Hitoshi.\nIzuku checks the air vents, a supply cupboard, and the inside of a locker before it occurs to him that Hitoshi\u2019s just sitting on the hallway floor, juice box in one hand and a familiar ugly cat on his lap. \u201cOh, hey. How\u2019d you smuggle that in here?\u201d\n\u201cSame way I smuggle everything,\u201d says Hitoshi. \u201cI still haven\u2019t named him. I can\u2019t decide between Nospurratu or Chairman Meow. Or Paul, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cPaul is a nice name, I guess,\u201d Izuku says, reaching out to pet it and then aborting when it hisses. \u201cStill haven\u2019t forgiven me, huh?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t bite,\u201d says Hitoshi, which Izuku doubts. \u201cHow\u2019s life?\u201d\n\u201cOh! I wanted to tell you that your approach was flawless,\u201d Izuku gushes, parking himself on the floor right next to Hitoshi and out of the cat\u2019s reach. \u201cLiterally all I had to do was be upfront about what I thought of their relationship, and it worked. They\u2019re dating now. They\u2019re the sappiest couple I\u2019ve ever seen, it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d says Hitoshi. The cat, noting the approval in its master\u2019s voice, flashes its claws at Izuku in warning. \u201cBack to the main mission?\u201d\n\u201cWell, not exactly,\u201d Izuku grins. \u201cAnother case has presented itself.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cA girl from our class seems to really like one of the boys. I\u2019m not super close friends with either of them, but it\u2019s so obvious I can\u2019t not help.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a busy man,\u201d says Hitoshi. The cat, suddenly all big yellow eyes and one-eared affection, rolls over for its belly to be scratched. \u201cPlan?\u201d\n\u201cIn the works,\u201d says Izuku. Maybe he\u2019s still riding the high from Kirishima and Tetsu\u2019s union, but he\u2019s feeling a little proud of himself as he digs a blue notebook out of his backpack. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching them. It\u2019s only been a couple days, and to be honest watching the girl is a little, well, difficult. But, I have a couple of preliminary observations. They don\u2019t interact much more than regular classmates do, and they\u2019re both fairly normal compared to the other subjects.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Hitoshi hums. \u201cWhat does that mean for you?\u201d\n\u201cIt means,\u201d Izuku says, opening the notebook, \u201cthat they\u2019ve got the most straightforward relationship we\u2019ve seen so far. They\u2019re average, healthy students with a casual friendship. One likes the other, but is too shy to say it. They don\u2019t spend enough time together for those feelings to develop beyond a crush. Honestly, they\u2019re just high schoolers. It\u2019s kind of refreshing.\u201d\n\u201cYour analytical skills are pretty awe-inspiring,\u201d says Hitoshi. The cat flicks its ear in annoyance.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s only because you pointed out that I should be looking at the fundamentals of these relationships,\u201d says Izuku, scratching the back of his neck bashfully. \u201cI thought pretty hard about it, it was good advice.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to help,\u201d says Shinsou. \u201cAs always, I could just make them like each other.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that won\u2019t last,\u201d Izuku says, putting his notebook away. \u201cAnyway it would be really cute to watch them fall in love. Kind of like being in a shoujo manga, you know?\u201d\n\u201cWould that make you the protagonist?\u201d\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m just a side character,\u201d Izuku shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m really not the protagonist type.\u201d\nHitoshi side-eyes him, although he doesn\u2019t say why. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Might be useful to talk to the girl, find out how she feels. I have to tread lightly, I think. Don\u2019t want her getting spooked. There\u2019s a very real danger of screwing up their relationship, unlike Kirishima and Tetsu.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Hitoshi. \u201cLet me know if you need to bounce ideas off me. Cat-kun and I are willing to listen.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think your cat wants to talk about my problems,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cIt hates me. Maybe you should name it after Kacchan, come to think of it. Call it Catsuki. Or, actually, don\u2019t. He\u2019ll know I came up with that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll warm up to you,\u201d Hitoshi says, using the cat\u2019s paw to pat Izuku on the knee. Its claws come out and leave scratches on his pants. \u201cEventually. A long, long time from now.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Izuku snorts, and sits there trying to coax it into playing until Hitoshi puts it in Izuku\u2019s lap in a moment of bad judgement, and it pees on him.\n\u201cI did not think he would do that,\u201d Hitoshi says, staring at the wet patch on Izuku\u2019s leg. \u201cHe\u2019s house trained, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cHe knew what he was doing,\u201d Izuku scowls. The cat\u2019s tail swishes as it stalks back to Hitoshi, pausing to look over its shoulder with the most smug expression Izuku has ever seen on a cat. \u201cAlright, demon, you\u2019ve made your point.\u201d\nMrow, says the cat, and Izuku decides it\u2019s probably time to go home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said we\u2019d be able to cut through anything. We\u2019ve been here for half an hour, what\u2019s the hold up?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d says Bakugou, lifting his welding mask. \u201cThis chainsaw fucking sucks. Who\u2019d you even get it from?\u201d\n\u201cHitoshi,\u201d says Todoroki.\nTetsu oohs appreciatively at the next shower of sparks. \u201cNot that this isn\u2019t fun,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cBut I kind of need to pee. Is this gonna take much longer?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a break, then Bakugou can tie you up again after you\u2019re done peeing?\u201d says Eijirou.\n\u201cStop using your quirks,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cI need both legs attached to my body,\u201d says Eijirou.\n\u201cWhy did you even come here if you\u2019re going to be uncooperative?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Eijirou says. \u201cBakugou found me after school and said \u2018hey does this rag smell like chloroform to you\u2019 and I woke up here.\u201d\n\u201cI came because Brodoroki said you and Kiri would be here,\u201d Tetsu says. \u201cI did think it was kind of weird that you guys wanted to hang out in a basement, though.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, fuck it,\u201d Bakugou says, dropping the chainsaw on the floor. It makes a worrying screechy noise against the tiles and then dies. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working. Do we have a plan B?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cI tried at the last minute to get some bleach but for some reason the school\u2019s all out.\u201d\n\u201cFuck. We\u2019re going to have to keep them here while we come up with something else.\u201d\n\u201cCan I go to the bathroom?\u201d asks Tetsu.\n\u201cFine. Make it quick.\u201d\nTetsu snaps the duct tape binding his wrists and stands, stretching out his arms with a satisfied noise. \u201cThanks. See you in a second. You guys want anything from the vending machine on my way back?\u201d\n\u201cCoke,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cPepsi,\u201d says Bakugou.\n\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d says Eijirou, blowing a hands-free kiss to his boyfriend as he jogs up the basement stairs. \u201cBy the way, why am I here?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why,\u201d Bakugou scowls. The welding mask perched on his head casts intimidating shadows on his face, and Eijirou wonders if he should try doing something similar with his hero costume. \u201cYou make a move on Deku, you die. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\nEijirou considers this. \u201cWhat counts as making a move on Midoriya, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cDating him, you fuck.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2026why am I here, then?\u201d\nBakugou stares at him. Really stares, which wouldn\u2019t normally bother Eijirou except this time Todoroki\u2019s standing next to him and their expressions are so alike it\u2019s disconcerting. \u201cYou are dating Midoriya,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cYou will no longer be dating \u00a0Midoriya once you are dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Eijirou, relaxing. \u201cAlright, there\u2019s your problem. I\u2019m not dating Midoriya, I\u2019m dating Tetsu.\u201d\n\u201cWhat,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d says Bakugou.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never dated Midoriya. I mean, I think he might have liked me at one point,\u201d Eijirou says a little bashfully, \u201cbut pretty soon after we started hanging out, Midoriya convinced me that me and Tetsu would make a great couple. He was right, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Bakugou says, sounding more outraged than angry. \u201cTetsu? Since when?\u201d\n\u201cSince a couple weeks ago. You haven\u2019t noticed? We\u2019re so lovey dovey.\u201d\n\u201cYou act exactly the same.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we make out now.\u201d\nBakugou and Todoroki share a very long look. Eijirou doesn\u2019t try to decipher their silent conversation because this seems like the kind of thing they need to work out themselves. \u201cMy heart belongs to Tetsu,\u201d he adds, though, just in case they didn\u2019t get it. \u201cMidoriya was our wingman. Right, babe?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d says Tetsu, clomping down the stairs. \u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d\n\u201cHow our relationship started. They thought I was dating Midoriya, isn\u2019t that nuts?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s dumb,\u201d says Tetsu. \u201cWhy would they think that?\u201d\nBakugou reaches for the chainsaw again, but Todoroki grabs him by the back of the shirt. \u201cSo neither of you are interested in Midoriya?\u201d he says, tugging Bakugou backwards. \u201cAre you certain you\u2019re telling us the truth and this isn\u2019t some elaborate ploy to get out of having your legs disassembled?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tetsu says. \u201cAlso when I got to the vending machine I realised I didn\u2019t have enough change for cola so I just got you guys milk.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re way too stupid to pull off a ploy,\u201d Bakugou says, yanking the mask off and throwing it over his shoulder. \u201cAll of this was a waste of time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that you guys like him so much,\u201d Eijirou says, scooching over so Tetsu can join him on the floor. \u201cBut you\u2019re not gonna get anywhere like that, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your fucking advice,\u201d Bakugou snaps.\n\u201cLet him finish.\u201d Todoroki takes the strawberry milk and hands the chocolate one to Bakugou. \u201cWhat do you propose we do, then?\u201d\n\u201cWell the main problem that I can see is how hostile you guys are to each other,\u201d Eijirou says sincerely.\n\u201cWhich is crazy considering how much you have in common,\u201d says Tetsu.\n\u201cWe\u2019re nothing alike,\u201d say Bakugou and Torodoki at the same time.\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d Eijirou continues, \u201cthat you\u2019re dealing with Midoriya, who hates it when people are mean to each other. He can see that you\u2019re competing over him, which is totally not what he stands for, you know?\u201d\n\u201cIt would kill him if he thought he was the reason you guys were enemies,\u201d says Tetsu.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Eijirou nods along. \u201cSo instead of\u2014sorry, my arms are falling asleep. Do you mind if I break out of this duct tape? Thanks. So, instead of fighting all the time, you should show him that you guys can get along. Then he\u2019ll know that if he picks one of you, the other one won\u2019t go berserk and blow up the school like so much dollar-store dorayaki.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be a problem,\u201d Todoroki mutters around his straw. \u201cBakugou\u2019s a sore loser.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019s picking your half-and-half dairy substitute ass?\u201d Bakugou slurps chocolate milk angrily at him. \u201cFucking whatever. So, what, we just have to pretend to coexist until Deku decides who to date?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d venture to say you should try to be friends,\u201d Tetsu says, wrapping an arm around Eijirou because he doesn\u2019t like to go more than a minute without cuddling. \"Midoriya\u2019s perceptive. He won\u2019t even consider it if he thinks you\u2019ll end up hating each other again. Look at us, we're inseparable, and Midoriya loves spending time with us. He seeks out harmony, man. He's like a little baby bunny that just wants to belong to a loving family.\u201d\nBakugou rolls his eyes. \u201cRight, sure. So you want me to spend my evenings cozying up to Scarface Mcgee? I\u2019m going to lose my savings feeding him because he\u2019s only ever had cold soba and crackers.\u201d\n\u201cMy allowance could buy you,\u201d says Todoroki.\nBakugou throws his empty milk carton at him. \u201cFine. Play nice in front of Deku, I can do that. Come on, you\u2019re gonna tell me all about yourself so I can impress Deku with how well I know you.\u201d\n\u201cNot if I get to know you first,\u201d Todoroki says, a fire in his eyes.\n\u201cHow nice,\u201d says Eijirou, watching them go. \u201cI thought they\u2019d never see eye to eye, but they\u2019re finally starting to get along.\u201d\n\u201cI hope things work out for them, however it turns out,\u201d Tetsu sighs, running his fingers through Eijirou\u2019s hair and planting a kiss on his forehead. \u201cHey, look, free chainsaw!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d says Midoriya after school, \u201cthat the first high school romance shoujo manga was probably written in the early sixties?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d says Ochako. \u201cAre you a fan of shoujo?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d says Midoriya. \u201cBut I have borrowed and read 57 assorted volumes this week. But did you also know that reciprocal liking is a valid psychological phenomenon? A 1984 experiment by Gold, Ryckman and Mosley showed that male participants showed an increased interested in female\u00a0 confederates who made eye contact, leaned in and listen attentively despite disagreeing on important issues.\u201d\n\u201cOkay?\u201d says Ochako.\n\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d asks Iida.\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that the trope about liking someone because you think they like you is very plausible,\u201d Mirodiya grins. \u201cFurthermore, feelings can come from odd places. Adrenaline and cortisol are released when you\u2019re stressed, but also when you\u2019re attracted to someone. Sometimes people mistake fear, nerves or even embarrassment for lust.\u201d\nIida\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cAnd what are you planning to do with that information?\u201d\n\u201cNothing yet,\u201d Mirodiya says sweetly. \u201cI just thought it was really interesting. Lots of shoujo plots make sense when you think about them scientifically. I always thought the big doki dokis in the background were far-fetched, but apparently they\u2019re not. It's all just love and adrenaline.\u201d\nIida doesn\u2019t look convinced, which Ochako doesn\u2019t really blame him for. \u201cAre you gonna spook them and hope they fall in love?\u201d she asks because they're probably thinking the same thing. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about, you know, project 3, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, them. And no, I\u2019m not that mean,\u201d Midoriya says.\n\u201cYou were seriously considering getting Bakugou and Todoroki arrested so they\u2019d have to get along,\u201d says Iida.\n\u201cThat was Uraraka,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be honest, those two would rise to the top of the juvie food chain immediately. It\u2019s not like they\u2019d suffer together, they\u2019d just be less supervised. Which would backfire, I think. But my point here is that when you break attraction down into its components, it looks pretty simple. Love is formulaic.\u201d\nIida sighs, and Ochako can\u2019t help but pat him sympathetically. \u201cI\u2019ve said this before, Midoriya, but you\u2019re an imp in the guise of a cherub.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m helping,\u201d Midoriya says, feigning hurt. Ochako giggles. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do anything drastic, relax. This is, like, the one regular couple we\u2019ve seen. No bro-ing, no trying to stab each other in the hallways. I want to protect that innocence. This operation is strictly vanilla, scout\u2019s honour.\u201d\n\u201cYou were never a scout,\u201d says Ochako. \u201cYou just liked the uniform and wore it every day for a week until Bakugou teased you and you cried.\u201d\n\u201cI was six!\u201d Midoriya says, turning a little pink. \u201cWho even told you that?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother, the last time Iida and I came over.\u201d\nMidoriya puts his face in his hands. \u201cFine, I had weird taste in clothes back then, okay? Don\u2019t laugh at me, it\u2019s not like I still run around in silly outfits now.\u201d\nOchako puts a palm over Iida\u2019s mouth before he can say anything. \u201cSo is this why you\u2019ve been on a shoujo binge? Do you want any recommendations? There\u2019s this one I really like about a high schooler trying to make her best friend see her as a girl, instead of just a martial arts rival.\u201d\n\u201cI still have a couple volumes of Ouran to get through,\u201d Mirodiya says, throwing his backpack over his shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019ve given me a great idea. Ojiro? Ojiro!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku chases him all the way to the school gym, karate gi folded over one arm and school satchel bouncing against his hip. \u201cOjiro! Do you have a minute?\u201d\nOjiro stops and waits obligingly for Izuku to catch up, tail swishing in greeting. \u201cYes? What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to ask if you could maybe do me a favour,\u201d Izuku says, skidding to a stop. \u201cWould you like a sparring partner?\u201d\n\u201cSure. Wanna come with?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not me,\u201d Izuku says and rubs the back of his neck. \u201cI was actually wondering if you\u2019d be willing to train with Hagakure. Hand-to-hand combat is one of her weak points, so she needs the practice. The other day she was telling me how good she thought you were, so it just occurred to me that you would be the ideal sparring partner. You could help her improve.\u201d Which isn\u2019t even a lie, come to think of it. Hagakure\u2019s decent, but not amazing at martial arts, and she had very explicitly said how much she liked Ojiro\u2019s tail work.\nOjiro\u2019s eyebrows furrow. The tip of his tail curls almost into a question mark, kind of like a curious cat\u2019s. Interesting. \u201cOh. Why isn\u2019t she asking me this herself?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s shy. She got really embarrassed the first time we talked about it, so I don\u2019t think she has the nerve to bring it up. Sorry. I know it\u2019s not really any of my business. I just thought it was worth checking to see if you were up for it.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so. I could always use a partner, since I normally just ask whoever\u2019s at the gym,\u201d Ojiro says, looking slightly pleased. \u201cDid she really say she liked my fighting?\u201d\n\u201cEssentially, yeah,\u201d Izuku says, choosing not to bring up the fact that it was technically Ashido and the others who spearheaded that conversation. \u201cAh, man, she\u2019s gonna be really mad at me for butting in, though.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have to tell her you asked me on her behalf,\u201d Ojiro says thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her tomorrow after school and see if she\u2019s interested. Maybe once she gets comfortable I can tell her it was your idea.\u201d\n\u201cSure!\u201d Izuku beams. \u201cThanks, Ojiro, this is really nice of you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, no worries. See you tomorrow, I guess. I\u2019ll tell you how it goes.\u201d\nIzuku waves goodbye and lets Ojiro go, watching his tail drift from side to side. Seems like he\u2019s in a good mood. Izuku is too, for completely different reasons, but Uraraka and Iida have probably already gone home for the day. He\u2019ll tell them about it tomorrow, he figures, almost skipping to the door.\nHe decides to take the scenic route home. It\u2019s a nice day, and it\u2019s made even nicer when he passes by McDonalds and sees Bakugou showing Todoroki the joys of french fries dipped in ice cream.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGoal: Get Ojiro and Hagakure to spend time alone, preferably in situations that will stimulate mild adrenaline and cortisol production.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAttempt 1: Hagakure agreed to sparring. I went to use the weights so I could keep an eye on them.\n\n\nResult: They were awkward at first, but it turned into a good session (I learned a few things myself)! Agreed to do it again sometime soon.\n\n\nAddendum: Hagakure asked if she could strip, but Ojiro said \u2018absolutely not\u2019. Try to convince him to say yes next time?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAttempt 2: Rain. Stole Hagakure\u2019s umbrella so they\u2019d have to share.\n\n\nResult: Unsuccessful. Yaoyorozu made her a new one. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAttempt 3: Put a gecko in Hagakure\u2019s blazer pocket while she was busy sparring with Ojiro\n\n\nResult: She kept it.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy a gecko?\u201d asks Hitoshi.\nIzuku shrugs. \u201cI thought it would scare her and Ojiro would come to the rescue. He seemed more afraid of it than she was, though. She named it Tailman Two and took it home with her.\u201d\nHitoshi makes a thoughtful noise and feeds Izuku a chicken nugget. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about adrenaline and cortisol?\n\u201cYour brain makes it when you\u2019re attracted to someone,\u201d Izuku says with his mouth full. \u201cYou know how they say your heartbeat speeds up when you see someone you like? Stress hormones.\u201d\n\u201cHence the training.\u201d\n\u201cPlus she needs it. They\u2019re about five sessions in, it\u2019s going well.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. So you\u2019re trying to get the chemical reaction first and hoping the romance comes after?\u201d\n\u201cPeople who experience mild traumas together often fall in love. It\u2019s plausible. Feelings are complicated.\u201d\n\u201cYour thought process is intimidating,\u201d Hitoshi says, raising his eyebrows.\n\u201cStop it, you\u2019re making me blush.\u201d Smothering a fry in ketchup, Izuku pops it in his mouth and thinks. \u201cI should step up my game. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned from Kirishima and Tetsu, it\u2019s that sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to just go for it. I don\u2019t want to freak them out, though.\u201d\n\u201cYou could simulate a near-death situation and see if that works.\u201d\n\u201cI literally just said I don\u2019t want to scare them,\u201d Izuku snorts. \u201cThere are less lethal ways to stress them out. Like shyness. Did you know Ojiro gets shy?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve only spoken to him to brainwash him.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I remember. Well, he does. Especially when you compliment him, it\u2019s really cute. They both are. Hagakure\u2019s really bubbly and Ojiro\u2019s tail wags when he\u2019s happy, although I don\u2019t think he\u2019s noticed that. Maybe I should plant the idea in his head that Hagakure likes him. But not explicitly, that would be mean.\u201d\n\u201cAnd would get you in trouble,\u201d Hitoshi says and steals some of Izuku\u2019s milkshake.\n\u201cBut she should be the one to say it. I don\u2019t think it would be convincing if it came from me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d offer to help with that, but that would be the least convincing option of all. How will you get her to open up?\u201d\n\u201cI considered asking her friends for advice, but they\u2019ll tell her everything. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any way for me to convince her to confess to him.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t actually have to say anything to him, technically,\u201d Hitoshi gestures with the last nugget. \u201cHe just has to hear her.\u201d\n\u201cIntriguing,\u201d Izuku says, leaning back in his chair. \u201cTell me your thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna need another box of nuggets first.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Izuku laughs, and makes sure to get extra barbecue sauce because he knows that one is Hitoshi\u2019s favourite.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKirishima\u2019s hair smells like Old Spice and gel. It\u2019s a nice smell, Tetsu thinks, even if the spikes are a little too stiff for him to comfortably rest his cheek against.\nBakugou hasn\u2019t stopped jiggling his leg since he sat down. Todoroki is, by comparison, completely rigid, back straight and hands in his lap like a red and white adolescent statue. Kaminari\u2019s next to them, picking at the lid of his yoghurt and eyeing them like he\u2019s not sure if he should run. It\u2019s a weird group. It\u2019s even weirder because Iida keeps coming by to tell Tetsu to go back to his own class, but school hasn\u2019t actually started yet so there\u2019s no reason to stop sharing Kirishima\u2019s seat.\nMidoriya comes in about five minutes later, looking pretty cheerful and only perking up more when he spots Todoroki and Bakugou not ripping each other\u2019s hair out. Tetsu waves him over to sit down, and Midoriya glances around the table before he makes himself comfortable on his own chair, which Todoroki and Bakugou had insisted be kept empty. \u201cHello. Funny seeing you here, Tetsu.\u201d\n\u201cI just thought I\u2019d walk my boyfriend to school,\u201d Tetsu says.\n\u201cGet lost, Calamari,\u201d Bakugou says flatly. Kaminari nods, chugs his yoghurt, and abruptly vacates his seat to hang out with someone else.\n\u201cYou two seem to be in a good mood,\u201d Midoriya says cautiously. Bakugou bristles, and Kirishima clears his throat so Midoriya doesn\u2019t notice Todoroki elbowing Bakugou\u2019s side.\n\u201cWe were all just hanging out,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cHow\u2019s your week been?\u201d\n\u201cGreat, actually,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cWhat were you guys chatting about?\u201d\n\u201cBrokugou bought the new Doom,\u201d Tetsu says. It\u2019s a detail Bakugou had mentioned in passing, so he\u2019s kind of proud of himself for remembering. \u201cHe was just inviting us and Brodoroki to come over and play sometime. Right guys?\u201d\nMirodiya zeroes in on them immediately. Todoroki, if possible, sits up even straighter. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked video games, Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cUhm,\u201d says Todoroki.\nBakugou rolls his eyes so naturally that Tetsu wants to applaud. \u201cRaspberry Ripple over here\u2019s not allowed to play anything above PG 13. He\u2019s been bugging me to show him good games ever since he added me on Steam.\u201d\n\u201cHe means violent games,\u201d Todoroki says, taking the hint. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason people say video games are a corrupting influence.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your gaming experience is based solely on farming sims.\u201d\n\u201cStardew is a good game,\u201d Todoroki sniffs.\n\u201cChrist, shut up,\u201d Bakugou tells him. \u201cWhat about it, Deku, you want in?\u201d\nMidoriya blinks. \u201cUhm, sure, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea! You should all spend some quality time together, really cement that friendship,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cTetsu and I won\u2019t be able to join you, though.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even picked a day yet,\u201d says Todoroki\u2019s mouth. His eyes say thank you.\nTetsu flaps a hand at him dismissively. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, Kiri and I have very busy weekends. All free days for the foreseeable future are gonna be spent making out.\u201d\n\u201cNo homo,\u201d says Kirishima, making Midoriya giggle. \u201cYou guys go ahead, tell us how it goes.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Midoriya says, smile morphing into something less confused and more organic. His teeth are very white, and his freckles shift a little when he happily wrinkles his nose. \u201cThe three of us hanging out for the first time ever. I guess it\u2019s a date.\u201d\nSilently, Bakugou and Todoroki melt in their seats. Kirishima hides a smile in Tetsu\u2019s chest. Unseen by Midoriya, Tetsu flashes the hopeful romantics a thumbs up and mentally wishes them good luck.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake a walk with me?\u201d Midoriya asks sweetly, and Toru chokes on her tea.\nIt\u2019s only room temperature (and from a bottle), thankfully, so it doesn\u2019t burn while she hacks up an invisible lung. Midoriya pats her on the back way too hard, but it distracts her from the liquid in her windpipe and she manages eventually to get her breathing back under control.\n\u201cSure, where to?\u201d she chirps as if she hadn\u2019t just almost died. Midoriya still looks concerned, but he jerks his thumb towards the door. 1-A is empty save for all the blazers hung on the backs of the chairs. Everyone else is clearing heading to the cafeteria for lunch, but Midoriya turns right instead of left outside the classroom.\n\u201cWhere are you two off two?\u201d asks Iida, breaking away from the lunch rush to stand in front of them. Toru wishes she didn\u2019t have to crane her neck so much to look at him.\n\u201cJust out for a walk,\u201d says Midoriya innocently.\nIida raises an eyebrow. \u201cReally. Would you like some company?\u201d\n\u201cNo thank you,\u201d says Midoriya. \u201cWe\u2019re bonding. I appreciate the offer, though.\u201d\n\u201cJust the two of you?\u201d says Iida. His tone suggests that he doesn\u2019t approve. This isn\u2019t new to Toru, though, since Iida disapproves of her and her friends a lot. \u201cNobody else?\u201d\nMidoriya seems unfazed. \u201cYes, just us two. We\u2019re going to wander around and chat.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather do that in the cafeteria? You shouldn\u2019t skip lunch.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything terrible to her, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe may have different definitions of terrible.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI know, I know. Sorry, Iida, but you\u2019re kind of in the way.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not budging,\u201d Iida says, folding his arms. His very muscular, very intimidating arms. His arms that are attached to a very large torso that does a pretty good job of taking up more of the corridor than it logically should, and Toru turns to Midoriya to suggest that they save the bonding for another time.\nMidoriya just shrugs. \u201cHave it your way,\u201d he says, and picks Iida up like a sack of potatoes.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Iida splutters into Midoriya\u2019s back and scrambles for balance once he\u2019s deposited next to the lockers and out of the way. His shirt\u2019s come untucked and his glasses are crooked. Somebody whistles. \u201cYou are not supposed to use your quirk without permission!\u201d\nMidoriya flexes his arm. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\nIida\u2019s too flabbergasted to reply. Toru is too, but Midoriya takes her by the shoulder and gently leads her down the corridor and further into the academic building. Toru glances at his biceps a couple of times but can\u2019t quite find it in her to ask him to flex some more. \u201cI, uhm, what was that about?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, Iida\u2019s just a big worrywart. He thinks I\u2019m a corrupting influence.\u201d\nToru thinks of big green eyes and sun-kissed freckles. \u201cI don\u2019t see how. Did you want to talk about something?\u201d\n\u201cOh, right. I hope this isn\u2019t too out of left field,\u201d Midoriya says a little hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about our conversation from the other day, you remember? With Ashido and Aoyama and Jirou, during homeroom? When I overheard you?\u201d\nToru feels her heart stop for the second time that afternoon. Thank god he can\u2019t see her face right now. \u201cOh, that?\u201d she says a little shrilly. \u201cThat, I, you know, it was just a stupid chat, we weren\u2019t being serious about any of it. How much did you hear?\u201d\n\u201cThe important parts, I guess? It was interesting, though. I didn\u2019t know you guys were so curious.\u201d\n\u201cW-well, I guess, I mean, we probably shouldn\u2019t have dragged you into it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho else would you have asked?\u201d Midoriya chuckles. He\u2019s got a nice laugh. Like sunshine and dandelions and protein powder. \u201cLike, it\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s a valid question. Not something I\u2019d think to ask myself, but I can see why you\u2019d want to know.\u201d\nToru coughs. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not offended? You\u2019re not singling me out because I\u2019m the weakest link and you know I\u2019ll incriminate myself?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Toru says, wringing her hands. \u201cI, uhm, what are we talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou wanted to know if girth or length were more important, right? After thinking about it, I can say that girth is probably more valuable,\u201d Midoriya says. Toru glances at his zipper. \u201cGives you more power and control.\u201d\n\u201cOh! Is, uhm, is that important for you?\u201d\nMidoriya raises his eyebrows. \u201cWell, of course it is. You don\u2019t think so?\u201d\n\u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Toru says. Midoriya nods.\n\u201cRight, makes sense that you wouldn\u2019t, you\u2019re built differently. I guess you\u2019ll understand better if you see for yourself.\u201d\n\u201cCan I?\u201d Toru squeaks. Holy shit. I have to call Aoyama and tell him to find some measuring tape.\nMidoriya nods again. \u201cWell, sure. I mean, I\u2019m only making this conclusion myself because I\u2019ve practiced with Ojiro a couple of times. It was a good experience, actually. Even if he does always end up getting me on my back.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Toru whispers. Midoriya just tilts his head at her like he hasn\u2019t proven all of Aoyama\u2019s weird fantasies right. \u201cYou and Ojiro? Oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cIs that really so weird?\u201d\n\u201cNo! No, he\u2019s a great guy! Absolutely amazing!\u201d\n\u201cI think so too,\u201d Midoriya smiles. He comes to a stop outside the music room and leans against the door. Nobody else is around. The sounds of chatter from the cafeteria float up through the open corridor windows, but their little corner is private. Toru, acutely aware of the way Midoriya\u2019s pants clings to his hips, swallows and wishes she\u2019d brought a camera. \u201cBut that\u2019s not all I wanted to talk about.\u201d\nToru might pass out. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya says quietly. \u201cI actually wanted to ask you how you feel about Ojiro. What do you think of him?\u201d\n\u201cLike, as a person?\u201d Toru manages to say. \u201cUhm, I don\u2019t know him that well. We\u2019ve only just become friends, and we\u2019ve sparred a few times in the gym. He seems really nice, I think? And, uhm, he\u2019s sweet and he works hard and he seems like he\u2019d make a really great boyfriend.\u201d\nMidoriya lights up. \u201cYou think?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Toru says, relieved that this seems to be the right answer. \u201cHe\u2019s, like, ideal. He seems like he\u2019d never forget an anniversary and he may not be romantic, I don\u2019t know, but he\u2019s sensitive and patient. And cute, too.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s cute?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Toru says, which isn\u2019t a lie. Ojiro\u2019s got great pecs.\nMidoriya\u2019s smile almost reaches his ears. \u201cI see. I\u2019m really, really happy to hear that. I think he\u2019d be a great match for you too.\u201d\n\u201cHe would! I\u2014 wait, what?\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d says Midoriya earnestly, bouncing a little in excitement. \u201cAs a partner?\u201d\n\u201cLike a sparring partner?\u201d\n\u201cThat too,\u201d Midoriya giggles. \u201cBut I meant romantically. I figured you were interested when you started the whole tail analysis thing, and I know it\u2019s none of my business, which is why Iida keeps nagging me, but I just really wanted to help out.\u201d\n\u201cTail analysis,\u201d Toru repeats. \u201cBecause we were talking about his tail. Which is what you heard us talking about.\u201d\n\u201cMhm. I thought it was really nice that you worry about him so much.\u201d\nOh. \u201cI, okay, I see why you would think that, but I\u2019m not actually in the habit of analysing quirks the way you do.\u201d\n\u201cI know! Which is why it\u2019s significant, right?\u201d\nToru puts her hands up to stop him. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve got the wrong idea. We weren\u2019t actually talking about his tail.\u201d\nMidoriya blinks. \u201cYou weren\u2019t? Then what were you talking about?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026his tail, you\u2019re right, you got me.\u201d\nMidoriya relaxes. \u201cRight. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s mutual since he keeps talking about you, about how much you\u2019ve improved and how gung-ho you are and that one time a ladybug landed in your hair but you didn\u2019t notice and he didn\u2019t have the heart to tell you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo wonder my dad laughed at me! Wait, he talks about me?\u201d\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m so stoked to hear such nice things about him from you.\u201d\nToru sighs. \u201cRight. I just said a lot of really embarrassing stuff for no reason, didn't I.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s for no reason,\u201d Midoriya says slyly.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he probably heard you.\u201d Enthusiastically, Midoriya slides open the music room\u2019s door. Ojiro\u2019s perched on an overturned bongo drum near the entrance, face bright red and tail curled up behind him like it\u2019s trying to hide. Toru\u2019s heart tries to escape her body via her throat.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she whispers, also for the second time that day. \u201cOjiro? You were here the whole time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Midoriya says, not sounding sorry at all. \u201cI might have orchestrated some of that. I\u2019ll just go ahead and leave you two alone.\u201d\n\u201cNo don\u2019t leave me here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you really mean all that?\u201d Ojiro stammers before Toru can drag Midoriya back by the sleeve. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m cute?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is happening,\u201d Toru whimpers, covering her face with her hands and wishing she couldn\u2019t still see through her eyelids.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOjiro stands and very intently studies the floor. \u201cMidoriya asked me to wait for him here. I heard him outside but I also heard my name so I got curious and listened in and then I overheard all of that and\u2014\u201d he stops, and covers his own face with his hands, mirroring Toru. \u201cI had no idea. No wonder he was so insistent I spar with you.\u201d\n\u201cThat was his idea?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to!\u201d Ojiro protests. \u201cI\u2014I mean it didn\u2019t occur to me at all that he was trying to set us up but you\u2019re really nice and cheerful and I\u2019ve honestly always thought you were pretty great so when he said you liked my fighting I was kind of happy and I went along with it without thinking?\u201d\nToru screams quietly into her palms. \u201cYou like me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ojiro says helplessly. \u201cBut you\u2019re blushing and it\u2019s really cute.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you even tell?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just can,\u201d Ojiro shrugs. He\u2019s red all the way down his neck, Toru notes absently. \u201cI always could. Maybe that means you\u2019re,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI dunno. Special, or something.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Everything smells like flowers, and there should be a classroom behind Ojiro but right now it just looks like a lot of sparkles and blank paper. \u201cAm I having a seizure?\u201d\n\u201cIt kind of feels like that, huh?\u201d Ojiro laughs nervously. \u201cMy heart\u2019s pumping like crazy.\u201d\n\u201cMine too.\u201d It\u2019s so loud she\u2019s pretty certain Ojiro can hear it, in fact. \u201cI think my stomach\u2019s trying to fly away. I can\u2019t believe you just told me you like me.\u201d\n\u201cI only said it because you said you liked me!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t! I just said you were the ideal boyfriend!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing! Arguably it\u2019s even worse! It\u2019s the same as saying you want me to be your boyfriend!\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re right, it is worse,\u201d Toru whines. \u201cCan you please just do me a favour and forget I ever existed?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Ojiro straightens his shoulders and looks her in the eyes. In the actual eyes, somehow, not just the general direction of her face. \u201cBut that\u2019s neither here nor there. I, uhm. I should take responsibility for this and, uhm,\u201d he says, looking very determined and also very embarrassed, which is weirdly endearing. \u201cI would like to take you out to dinner tonight if you\u2019re free.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Toru numbly. \u201cI, uhm, okay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Ojiro, tail wagging hesitantly. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes your shirt actually say \u2018pants\u2019?\u201d asks Kacchan in disbelief.\nIzuku looks down at his chest. \u201cOh, yeah, I got it on sale. Cool, right?\u201d\nKacchan pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that stupid thing in my house. Go home and change.\u201d\n\u201cI just got here and you\u2019re sending me back?\u201d\n\u201cYou live down the street.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so far away,\u201d Izuku complains. \u201cJust let me in.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come, the shirt can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just take it off, then.\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes and sidles past Kacchan to get into the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here. Do you still have that big hole in the living from when you blasted yourself through the wall?\u201d\n\u201cWe patched that up,\u201d Kacchan says, face oddly blank. \u201cGo upstairs, Half-and-half is already here.\u201d\nIzuku takes the stairs up two at a time, bare feet thumping on the wood. Kacchan\u2019s house is largely the same as he remembers it, still tidy but marked with little reminders of their growing up. Scratches on furniture and burns that never quite scrubbed out, and cabinets that had to be rearranged every year to cover up Kacchan\u2019s noisy accidents. The hallway\u2019s bright yellow now, instead of cream, but underneath the new paint job there\u2019s a badly-drawn\u00a0 All Might in permanent marker because six-year-old Kacchan had decided that the house needed better d\u00e9cor.\nIzuku hesitantly turns the knob to Kacchan\u2019s room. \u201cHey, Todoroki. Wow, it\u2019s cold in here.\u201d\n\u201cAnti-summer measures,\u201d Kacchan says, kicking the door shut behind him as Izuku makes himself comfortable on the floor. Todoroki\u2019s in a soft grey button-down and jeans, leaning against the foot of Kacchan\u2019s bed with lordly composure.\n\u201cHow are you okay wearing a tank top?\u201d Izuku says, baffled.\n\u201cI\u2019m tough. You want food or something?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like a drink,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cI was asking Deku. You can go get your own,\u201d Kacchan replies.\nTodoroki scoffs. \u201cYou know, the first time I came here I was expecting to find Bakugou living in a dumpster. I thought that might explain his personality.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, then,\u201d Kacchan says, flipping him off.\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you hang out here often?\u201d Izuku says before Kacchan can start dragging Todoroki across the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty far for you to travel, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a nice house, though. Cosy.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan\u2019s parents have good taste,\u201d Izuku says, choosing not to mention that Kacchan\u2019s \u2018cosy\u2019 house is about five times the size of Izuku\u2019s apartment. \u201cWell, they would, obviously, being designers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve met them,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cThey\u2019re wasted on him.\u201d\n\u201cDo me a favour and keep your daddy issues at home,\u201d says Bakugou, starting up the TV. It\u2019s an old flat screen, and he hooks it up to his laptop and hands Izuku a controller. \u201cPlay the tutorial or whatever. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nThey watch the intro and Izuku fumbles through the murder of a few hapless demons until Kacchan returns with snacks and some mugs. \u201cTea or coffee?\u201d\n\u201cTea,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cWrong, it\u2019s coffee,\u201d Kacchan says. Izuku snorts and immediately gets himself killed.\n\u201cAw, I thought I was starting to get the hang of it,\u201d he says sadly to the loading screen. \u201cDoom\u2019s very you, though, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s violent and tacky,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s asking you to stay. Here, Deku, milk and three sugars for your diabetic ass.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku says, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s iced? Kacchan, your room\u2019s already freezing.\u201d\n\u201cWear one of my hoodies,\u201d Kacchan says immediately, reaching for a conveniently folded square of cloth at the end of his bed. It\u2019s black and looks way too big for Izuku.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Todoroki urgently. \u201cWear mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a hoodie,\u201d Izuku points out.\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not,\u201d Todoroki says, obviously crestfallen. \u201cBecause my quirk\u2014 my quirk! My left side is warm. Sit next to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate using your left side,\u201d Kacchan says.\n\u201cYes. Now it\u2019s finally good for something,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit with him, Deku, there\u2019s no sense warming yourself on just one side. Take the hoodie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my arm around you, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just turn the AC down?\u201d Izuku says.\n\u201cNo,\u201d say Kacchan and Todoroki at the same time.\nIzuku rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a mad dash for the remote before Izuku can even put his coffee down. The air conditioning gets colder, then warmer, then colder again, and Kacchan and Todoroki wrestle on the floor and bump into furniture until Kacchan\u2019s mother comes in and yells at them to stop wasting electricity.\nIt\u2019s a lot more comfortable after that. Izuku sips his coffee while Todoroki lies face-down on the floor and Kacchan tries to pull him out the door by his ankle. \u201cThis game\u2019s soundtrack is pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you liked pop,\u201d Kacchan grunts. Todoroki kicks lazily at his shins. He reminds Izuku of a housecat who won\u2019t get off its owner\u2019s laptop, and Izuku turns away so they don\u2019t see him smile.\n\u201cThis is good too. Is it only single player, though? I don\u2019t want to hog the controller.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll watch,\u201d says Todoroki, making a soft skidding noise as he slides across the floor.\n\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says, exiting the game. \u201cDo you have more controllers? Let\u2019s play something else with co-op.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s that dumb cooking game Half-and-half likes,\u201d Kacchan says, dropping Todoroki\u2019s leg. \u201cThe one where you fight a giant meatball?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fight him, you feed him,\u201d Todoroki says, sitting upright. \u201cThe maps change so you have to work together.\u201d\n\u201cTogether, huh,\u201d Izuku says, eyeing the Wii in the corner. \u201cHey, Kacchan, do you still have Mario Kart? You used to be so good at that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good at Mario Kart too,\u201d says Todoroki quickly. \u201cI could beat him.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cYou\u2019re on, candy ass.\u201d\nIzuku grins. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for some friendly competition. Best two out of three?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not friendly. It doesn\u2019t end at three games, either.\nIzuku\u2019s coffee cup sits forgotten on the floor, melted ice leaving rings of condensation that drip down the sides and onto the floor. They\u2019ve eaten six packets of chips between them. Kacchan won\u2019t stop screaming at the screen, and Todoroki\u2019s threatened to ice his bedroom more than once.\n\u201cGet out of my fucking face, Yoshi,\u201d Kacchan barks, jerking around wildly as he steers. Todoroki grumbles something under his breath and leans forward, bangs falling into his eyes as his little Yoshi sprite takes a corner.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser, and then I\u2019m going to kill you for picking him.\u201d\nIzuku whines, firmly in fifth place and driving a cute pink car because for some reason they\u2019d bullied him into using Princess Peach. \u201cNo, I missed a power up! Peach! Peach, why can\u2019t you drift?\u201d\n\u201cShe can drift, you just suck ass\u2014 did you just fucking banana peel me you dickbag asshole?\u201d\nYoshi takes first place. Todoroki pumps both fists in the air while Kacchan hollers at the scoreboard. \u201cCheap trick! I would have won if you hadn\u2019t killed me off at the last second!\u201d\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d Todoroki retorts, tossing his head. \u201cFour-three. I am the superior racer.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you and fuck your Smedley references,\u201d Kacchan hoots angrily. \u201cAgain! We\u2019re not stopping until I\u2019ve obliterated you!\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even won once,\u201d Izuku sighs. He\u2019s not terribly bothered, though. Kacchan and Todoroki are vibrating with energy, focused on each other and the game and rage-eating their way through all of Kacchan\u2019s pantry. Todoroki\u2019s animated in a way Izuku never usually seen him, and Kacchan\u2019s mother\u2019s already come in twice to tell him to stop screeching but he clearly hasn\u2019t listened. Izuku couldn\u2019t get them more hyped up on adrenaline if he threw them into a sudden death match against All Might.\nThe next map loads and Izuku almost forgets to drive. Kacchan\u2019s knee is pressed against Todoroki\u2019s, although neither of them have noticed. He\u2019s never seen them touch before. Hit each other, yeah, but not like this, casually and without intention to hurt. Not like they\u2019re friends.\n\u201cOut of my way! How does my entire ass taste, Deku?\u201d\n\u201cLast place just means I can blue shell you, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, you better not.\u201d\n\u201cDo it, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI will kick your ass, stay away from that power up\u2014son of a bitch.\u201d\nTodoroki snorts as Bowser goes careening off a cliff. Yoshi, once again, takes first place. \u201cHow does my ass taste?\u201d\nKacchan tackles him. Todoroki goes rolling onto his back and both controllers clatter on the floor, and Izuku scrambles to rescue them before they can get destroyed. Kacchan\u2019s got Todoroki in a headlock. Todoroki manages to pull Kacchan\u2019s shirt over his head, blinding him for long enough to shove him over and jam an elbow in his sternum.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted you to work off your aggression,\u201d Izuku sighs, and then yelps when they knock over his coffee cup. \u201cMy All Might socks!\u201d\n\u201cFuck your All Might socks,\u201d Kacchan wheezes. \u201cWash them later.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee stains! My mom got these for me!\u201d\nThey ignore him. Izuku, feet wet and All Might dyed brunet, feels the first spikes of irritation he\u2019s had in a long time.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he says, yanking Todoroki bodily off of Kacchan and tossing him onto the bed. Todoroki bounces on the mattress and lands on his back. \u201cCan you two morons stop trying to cripple each other every other day?\u201d\nTodoroki blinks, either from the shock of being thrown or from the shock of being called a moron. \u201cMidoriya?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you Midoriya me,\u201d Izuku replies hotly. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like children! Every little thing sends you two into these ridiculous pissbaby fights. Normal people don\u2019t behave like this!\u201d\nPissbaby, Todoroki mouths as Kacchan gets to his feet. \u201cChill, Deku. Is this about the socks?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Maybe! That\u2019s not the point!\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you tell me to chill, you big dumb meathead. You\u2019re the least chill person on the planet. I thought maybe you and Todoroki were finally learning to coexist but you can\u2019t go an hour without breaking something.\u201d\n\u201cWe are getting along,\u201d Todoroki says, wounded. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really trying to hurt each other this time.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Deku,\u201d Kacchan snaps. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with him voluntarily for your sake, because you\u2019re so insistent that everybody holds hands and get along. I feed him. I have him in my house after school. I binge-watched all his favourite TV shows. We\u2019re acting like best fucking friends over here. What the hell else do we have to do to prove that? Do I have to make out with him in front of you so your stupid green head understands we don\u2019t hate each other?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Izuku.\nKacchan\u2019s mouth clicks shut. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really meant that,\u201d Todoroki says after a second.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes. \u201cA girl kissed him on the cheek once and he cried because he thought she\u2019d given him cooties.\u201d\n\u201cI was seven,\u201d Kacchan says, throwing his hands up.\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t changed! All you know how to do is study and punch things. You\u2019re afraid to let Todoroki know he\u2019s important to you. Even the thought of physical affection scares you!\u201d\nTodoroki clears his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think kissing me really has anything to do with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am not scared,\u201d Kacchan says quietly.\nIzuku looks him in the eye. \u201cChicken.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Kacchan roars, stomping over to his double bed and grabbing Todoroki by the collar. \u201cI\u2019ll show you who\u2019s fucking scared of physical affection! Come here, you!\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPucker up, Shortcake,\u201d Kacchan growls and kisses Todoroki full on the mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMario Kart music continues to play from the TV. Sunlight streams through the window, and Izuku\u2019s spilled iced coffee sits in a murky puddle that will no doubt stain the floorboards forever. Torodoki\u2019s hands, which had been pressed to Kacchan\u2019s chest to push him away, slowly relax and migrate up to rest on Kacchan\u2019s jaw. Izuku counts ten seconds before they break apart and come up for air.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Kacchan says.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki says, and kisses him again.\nForgotten in the background, wet socks and all, Izuku cheers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you did it,\u201d says Uraraka, patting Izuku on the back and making him glance shyly away. \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped the fighting for good. I believed in you from the very start, I want you to know that.\u201d\n\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Iida says. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t like the idea of you meddling like that, I have to say everything worked out exactly how you wanted. Well done, Midoriya.\u201d\nIzuku leans back happily in his seat. The morning sun is refreshingly bright, and 1A\u2019s pre-homeroom chatter in the background is soothing. Everyone\u2019s milling about in their cliques. Kirishima\u2019s talking to Tetsu at the door, since Iida had nagged them both about intruding into the wrong classes. Hagakure\u2019s surrounded by her friends. Izuku can\u2019t quite tell, of course, but she seems to be distracted, glancing to the back of the class in Ojiro\u2019s direction. His tail swishes lazily back and forth, speeding up just a bit whenever she looks his way.\nKacchan\u2019s in Todoroki\u2019s lap. He\u2019s using him as a chair, more accurately, because Todoroki had decided that morning to sit in Kacchan\u2019s seat instead of his own. He\u2019s almost completely blocked from view, face pressed between Kacchan\u2019s shoulder blades and arms dangling limply at his sides while Kacchan plays candy crush on Todoroki\u2019s phone.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cDie, then,\u201d says Kacchan.\n\u201cSo romantic,\u201d Izuku sighs.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s an improvement,\u201d Iida says. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see Kaminari again. He came in, took one look at them and then walked back out.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably just having some trouble processing it,\u201d Uraraka says, patting Iida on the arm. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s a little weirded out. They were assaulting each other just a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now they\u2019re in love!\u201d Izuku says, clapping his hands together gleefully. \u201cOr like. Or lust. Maybe lust, actually. They kissed for a really long time. I think they forgot I was there. I mean I left after a couple of minutes, but I could have sworn I saw Kacchan\u2019s shirt get tossed out the window when I was going home.\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cDo not,\u201d says Iida.\n\u201cAnd now everything is perfect,\u201d says Izuku. \u201cI love love.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing the lord\u2019s work, Deku-kun,\u201d Uraraka says seriously. \u201cMaybe you can start a matchmaking service if you ever get tired of being a hero.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, Midoriya is never going to get tired of being a hero,\u201d says Iida. \u201cSecondly, how do you really think that\u2019s going to work out? Nobody\u2019s going to care about the matchmaking. They\u2019ll just use it as an excuse to spend an hour alone with him.\u201d\n\u201cIf he gets paid for it, at least everyone\u2019s happy,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cThanks, Iida, but I really don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to want to pay to hang out with me. I\u2019m not sure that many people would even do it for free,\u201d Izuku says, not understanding why Iida sighs so loudly. \u201cI guess helping people find love is kind of like hero work, though. Do we know any love-based heroes?\u201d\nUraraka tilts her head. \u201cMiss Midnight\u2019s the closest one I can think of, but I\u2019m not sure her whole theme counts as love, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Izuku hums in response. Iida nods, and Izuku\u2019s gaze drifts down to Uraraka\u2019s hand still resting comfortably on his arm. She\u2019s got such cute fingers, like a cat\u2019s. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve been meaning to say this for a while, but don\u2019t you think you and Iida would make a great couple?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cI just haven\u2019t asked him out yet. It was never really the right time.\u201d\nIida splutters. \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re underage, and we have school and hero work to worry about, you know, the idea of romance at all is highly inappropriate, I don\u2019t think, I mean, such an idea is, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d Uraraka tells him. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you ice cream and I promise I\u2019ll ask for permission before holding your hand, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Iida meekly.\nIzuku puts his chin in his hands as Iida tries to disappear slowly into his collar. \u201cI love love.\u201d\nA crumpled-up piece of paper bounces off his forehead. Izuku looks up and sees Kacchan waving him over from the window seat. Todoroki\u2019s still trapped under him, but seems fairly comfortable with his hands resting on Kacchan\u2019s lap. \u201cHah! Oi, Deku, I just beat Raspberry Delight\u2019s high score. Come watch me obliterate him some more.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Midoriya,\u201d says Todoroki, muffled. \u201cI\u2019m better than he is, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll be showing him is your defeat,\u201d Kacchan says and then squirms. \u201cPoke me all you want, bastard, I\u2019m not ticklish.\u201d\nIzuku grins and gets to his feet to join them. \u201cAlright, but I wanna play too. I\u2019m gonna have to warn you though, I\u2019m very good at Candy Crush.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay, Jirou. You and Yaomomo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre already dating.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku says, flashing her a thumbs up. She grins and saunters off to join the crowd of students stampeding off to lunch, one hand holding a soda bottle and the other sneaking comfortably into Yaoyorozu\u2019s blazer pocket. Uraraka goes to Iida\u2019s desk, and Iida, red-faced, offers her his arm so they can go to the cafeteria together.\nIzuku lets them go. They probably want some privacy. Besides, he\u2019s already got lunch plans.\nHe finds Hitoshi in the courtyard by the fountain, very intently studying a pigeon wing on the ground. There\u2019s no bird attached. Just the wing, for some reason, with none of the feathers out of place.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but imagine,\u201d he says when Izuku comes up behind him, \u201cthat the pigeon must have dropped its wing like a lizard drops its tail when you startle it.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a lot better than imagining what must have happened to that poor bird.\u201d\n\u201cEaten, probably. Why leave the wing though?\u201d\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t like wings,\u201d Izuku says good naturedly. \u201cThey\u2019re not easy to eat. Fun when you fry them, though. Or barbecue them.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that this is where I first met Paul?\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019re calling him?\u201d Izuku asks, plopping bonelessly onto the stone edge of the fountain. The sound of running water almost makes him want to take a dip. Maybe he\u2019ll go to the pool on the weekend. \u201cOh, the tree\u2019s growing back. There\u2019s a little shoot coming out of the trunk, that\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\u201cThat tree is a survivor,\u201d Hitoshi says, sitting down next to him. \u201cIf I got blown up and then crushed by a solid block of ice, I wouldn\u2019t be growing any limbs back.\u201d\n\u201cHumans don\u2019t usually do that, I think.\u201d\n\u201cNot with that attitude. Lunch?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve actually got something to do today.\u201d Stretching his arms over his head, Izuku tilts his face up to catch some sunlight. \u201cBy the way, Project 1 was a great success. Kacchan and Todoroki like each other now. They kissed a few days ago while we were at Kacchan\u2019s place. It was really satisfying. Like when you\u2019re reading a story and wondering if the main characters will ever fall in love even though you know they\u2019d be perfect for each other, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call either of them the main character,\u201d Hitoshi says, inspecting his nails. \u201cThose two owe me some money. Congratulations, though. You\u2019re three for three. Any other projects you have your eye on now?\u201d\n\u201cNot right now, no,\u201d Izuku says. A flyaway lock of hair falls across Hitoshi\u2019s forehead, and Izuku nudges at a pebble with the tip of his shoe. \u201cThanks, by the way. I couldn\u2019t have done any of this without you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Hitoshi says.\nIzuku meets his gaze. The bags under Hitoshi\u2019s eyes had always worried him at first, but now they remind Izuku less of sleepless nights, and more of secret books read under the covers long after his mother had told him to go to bed. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s this Korean restaurant that\u2019s just opened up near my place. I hear their kimchi soup is to die for.\u201d\n\u201cI like kimchi,\u201d says Hitoshi.\nIzuku knows. \u201cWould you like to go with me sometime? My treat. A proper thank-you for all the advice.\u201d\nHitoshi regards him quietly. \u201cIs this a date?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like,\u201d Izuku says, a little shy.\nHitoshi smiles. It\u2019s a small thing, barely there, but just enough to make his eyes crinkle a little at the corners. \u201cI think I\u2019d like it to be.\u201d\n\u201cI think I would too.\u201d\n\u201cWe do have a lot in common.\u201d\n\u201cLike fluffy hair?\u201d\n\u201cAmong other things.\u201d Hitoshi deliberates for a second, and then slowly reaches out to place his hand over Izuku\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m free on Saturday. I\u2019ll buy dessert.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Izuku says. He squeezes Hitoshi\u2019s fingers and stands, not even trying to keep the goofy grin off his face. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at half past noon at my house. I\u2019ll text you the address. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Izuku says, stirring more sugar into his tea. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t think it would work out as well as it did, but everything seems to be perfect for now.\u201d\nAll Might sits on the loveseat across from him, suit hanging off his shoulders and jacket pooling around his waist. It\u2019s a grey and orange pinstripe, which should be weird but somehow works. That may just be Izuku\u2019s hero-worship talking, though. All Might\u2019s one third the size that he normally is and Izuku still thinks he looks great.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some impressive analytical work on your part, young man,\u201d All Might tells him, making Izuku preen. \u201cI suppose that helping your friends find their happiness is heroic in its own right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Izuku says and nearly spills his tea. \u201cAnd Hagakure and Ojiro are so cute, and Tetsu and Kirishima are really nice and supportive, and Todoroki and Kacch\u2014uhm, Bakugou, they\u2019ve stopped fighting!\u201d\n\u201cThat was starting to become an issue.\u201d Delicately, All Might bites into a sandwich, chewing slowly so as not to upset his injured stomach. Teachers bustle around in the background, but nobody bothers their little corner of the staff room. \u201cMy. It\u2019s only been a month since we had lunch together. When I asked what you\u2019d been up to I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be this busy.\u201d\n\u201cA hero\u2019s work is never done,\u201d Izuku says seriously. All Might snorts, and Izuku makes sad eyes at the cupcakes. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s happy, and that makes me happy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Midoriya,\u201d All Might says, giving him the banana one. Izuku peels off the wrapper and immediately gets frosting on his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a good hero. I\u2019m glad I picked you.\u201d\nIzuku kicks his feet happily and eats his lunch. Saturday seems like it\u2019s too far away, but for now he\u2019s content on a leather sofa with the person he\u2019d always wanted to be. All Might leans against the arm rest, relaxed and unguarded the way he can\u2019t be when he steps out from behind their four walls.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t mind. Without his quirk, without his persona, All Might\u2019s still always going to be a hero. Maybe one day Izuku will be too. That\u2019s a long way away, though. In the meantime, this is good.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Izuku says, sipping his tea. \u201cHave I mentioned my mother is single?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes your shirt actually say \u2018pants\u2019?\u201d asks Kacchan in disbelief.\nIzuku looks down at his chest. \u201cOh, yeah, I got it on sale. Cool, right?\u201d\nKacchan pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that stupid thing in my house. Go home and change.\u201d\n\u201cI just got here and you\u2019re sending me back?\u201d\n\u201cYou live down the street.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so far away,\u201d Izuku complains. \u201cJust let me in.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come, the shirt can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just take it off, then.\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes and sidles past Kacchan to get into the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here. Do you still have that big hole in the living from when you blasted yourself through the wall?\u201d\n\u201cWe patched that up,\u201d Kacchan says, face oddly blank. \u201cGo upstairs, Half-and-half is already here.\u201d\nIzuku takes the stairs up two at a time, socked feet thumping on the wood. Kacchan\u2019s house is largely the same as he remembers it, still tidy but marked with little reminders of their growing up. Scratches on furniture and burns that never quite scrubbed out, and cabinets that had to be rearranged every year to cover up Kacchan\u2019s noisy accidents. The hallway\u2019s bright yellow now, instead of cream, but underneath the new paint job there\u2019s a badly-drawn\u00a0 All Might in permanent marker because six-year-old Kacchan had decided that the house needed better d\u00e9cor.\nIzuku hesitantly turns the knob to Kacchan\u2019s room. \u201cHey, Todoroki. Wow, it\u2019s cold in here.\u201d\n\u201cAnti-summer measures,\u201d Kacchan says, kicking the door shut behind him as Izuku makes himself comfortable on the floor. Todoroki\u2019s in a soft grey button-down and jeans, leaning against the foot of Kacchan\u2019s bed with lordly composure.\n\u201cHow are you okay wearing a tank top?\u201d Izuku says, baffled.\n\u201cI\u2019m tough. You want food or something?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like a drink,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cI was asking Deku. You can go get your own,\u201d Kacchan replies.\nTodoroki scoffs. \u201cYou know, the first time I came here I was expecting to find Bakugou living in a dumpster. I thought that might explain his personality.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, then,\u201d Kacchan says, flipping him off.\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you hang out here often?\u201d Izuku says before Kacchan can start dragging Todoroki across the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty far for you to travel, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a nice house, though. Cosy.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan\u2019s parents have good taste,\u201d Izuku says, choosing not to mention that Kacchan\u2019s \u2018cosy\u2019 house is about five times the size of Izuku\u2019s apartment. \u201cWell, they would, obviously, being designers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve met them,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cThey\u2019re wasted on him.\u201d\n\u201cDo me a favour and keep your daddy issues at home,\u201d says Bakugou, starting up the TV. It\u2019s an old flat screen, and he hooks it up to his laptop and hands Izuku a controller. \u201cPlay the tutorial or whatever. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nThey watch the intro and Izuku fumbles through the murder of a few hapless demons until Kacchan returns with snacks and some mugs. \u201cTea or coffee?\u201d\n\u201cTea,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cWrong, it\u2019s coffee,\u201d Kacchan says. Izuku snorts and immediately gets himself killed.\n\u201cAw, I thought I was starting to get the hang of it,\u201d he says sadly to the loading screen. \u201cDoom\u2019s very you, though, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s violent and tacky,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s asking you to stay. Here, Deku, milk and three sugars for your diabetic ass.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku says, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s iced? Kacchan, your room\u2019s already freezing.\u201d\n\u201cWear one of my hoodies,\u201d Kacchan says immediately, reaching for a conveniently folded square of cloth at the end of his bed. It\u2019s black and looks way too big for Izuku.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Todoroki urgently. \u201cWear mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a hoodie,\u201d Izuku points out.\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not,\u201d Todoroki says, obviously crestfallen. \u201cBecause my quirk\u2014 my quirk! My left side is warm. Sit next to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate using your left side,\u201d Kacchan says.\n\u201cYes. Now it\u2019s finally good for something,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit with him, Deku, there\u2019s no sense warming yourself on just one side. Take the hoodie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my arm around you, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just turn the AC down?\u201d Izuku says.\n\u201cNo,\u201d say Kacchan and Todoroki at the same time.\nIzuku rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a mad dash for the remote before Izuku can even put his coffee down. The air conditioning gets colder, then warmer, then colder again, and Kacchan and Todoroki wrestle on the floor and bump into furniture until Kacchan\u2019s mother comes in and yells at them to stop wasting electricity.\nIt\u2019s a lot more comfortable after that. Izuku sips his coffee while Todoroki lies face-down on the floor and Kacchan tries to pull him out the door by his ankle. \u201cThis game\u2019s soundtrack is pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you liked pop,\u201d Kacchan grunts. Todoroki kicks lazily at his shins. He reminds Izuku of a housecat who won\u2019t get off its owner\u2019s laptop, and Izuku turns away so they don\u2019t see him smile.\n\u201cThis is good too. Is it only single player, though? I don\u2019t want to hog the controller.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll watch,\u201d says Todoroki, making a soft skidding noise as he slides across the floor.\n\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says, exiting the game. \u201cDo you have more controllers? Let\u2019s play something else with co-op.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s that dumb cooking game Half-and-half likes,\u201d Kacchan says, dropping Todoroki\u2019s leg. \u201cThe one where you fight a giant meatball?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fight him, you feed him,\u201d Todoroki says, sitting upright. \u201cThe maps change so you have to work together.\u201d\n\u201cTogether, huh,\u201d Izuku says, eyeing the Wii in the corner. \u201cHey, Kacchan, do you still have Mario Kart? You used to be so good at that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good at Mario Kart too,\u201d says Todoroki quickly. \u201cI could beat him.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cYou\u2019re on, candy ass.\u201d\nIzuku grins. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for some friendly competition. Best two out of three?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not friendly. It doesn\u2019t end at three games, either.\nIzuku\u2019s coffee cup sits forgotten on the floor, melted ice leaving rings of condensation that drip down the sides and onto the floor. They\u2019ve eaten six packets of chips between them. Kacchan won\u2019t stop screaming at the screen, and Todoroki\u2019s threatened to ice his bedroom more than once.\n\u201cGet out of my fucking face, Yoshi,\u201d Kacchan barks, jerking around wildly as he steers. Todoroki grumbles something under his breath and leans forward, bangs falling into his eyes as his little Yoshi sprite takes a corner.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser, and then I\u2019m going to kill you for picking him.\u201d\nIzuku whines, firmly in fifth place and driving a cute pink car because for some reason they\u2019d bullied him into using Princess Peach. \u201cNo, I missed a power up! Peach! Peach, why can\u2019t you drift?\u201d\n\u201cShe can drift, you just suck ass\u2014 did you just fucking banana peel me you dickbag asshole?\u201d\nYoshi takes first place. Todoroki pumps both fists in the air while Kacchan hollers at the scoreboard. \u201cCheap trick! I would have won if you hadn\u2019t killed me off at the last second!\u201d\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d Todoroki retorts, tossing his head. \u201cFour-three. I am the superior racer.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you and fuck your Smedley references,\u201d Kacchan hoots angrily. \u201cAgain! We\u2019re not stopping until I\u2019ve obliterated you!\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even won once,\u201d Izuku sighs. He\u2019s not terribly bothered, though. Kacchan and Todoroki are vibrating with energy, focused on each other and the game and rage-eating their way through all of Kacchan\u2019s pantry. Todoroki\u2019s animated in a way Izuku never usually seen him, and Kacchan\u2019s mother\u2019s already come in twice to tell him to stop screeching but he clearly hasn\u2019t listened. Izuku couldn\u2019t get them more hyped up on adrenaline if he threw them into a sudden death match against All Might.\nThe next map loads and Izuku almost forgets to drive. Kacchan\u2019s knee is pressed against Todoroki\u2019s, although neither of them have noticed. He\u2019s never seen them touch before. Hit each other, yeah, but not like this, casually and without intention to hurt. Not like they\u2019re friends.\n\u201cOut of my way! How does my entire ass taste, Deku?\u201d\n\u201cLast place just means I can blue shell you, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, you better not.\u201d\n\u201cDo it, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI will kick your ass, stay away from that power up\u2014son of a bitch.\u201d\nTodoroki snorts as Bowser goes careening off a cliff. Yoshi, once again, takes first place. \u201cHow does my ass taste?\u201d\nKacchan tackles him. Todoroki goes rolling onto his back and both controllers clatter on the floor, and Izuku scrambles to rescue them before they can get destroyed. Kacchan\u2019s got Todoroki in a headlock. Todoroki manages to pull Kacchan\u2019s shirt over his head, blinding him for long enough to shove him over and jam an elbow in his sternum.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted you to work off your aggression,\u201d Izuku sighs, and then yelps when they knock over his coffee cup. \u201cMy All Might socks!\u201d\n\u201cFuck your All Might socks,\u201d Kacchan wheezes. \u201cWash them later.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee stains! My mom got these for me!\u201d\nThey ignore him. Izuku, feet wet and All Might dyed brunet, feels the first spikes of irritation he\u2019s had in a long time.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he says, yanking Todoroki bodily off of Kacchan and tossing him onto the bed. Todoroki bounces on the mattress and lands on his back. \u201cCan you two morons stop trying to cripple each other every other day?\u201d\nTodoroki blinks, either from the shock of being thrown or from the shock of being called a moron. \u201cMidoriya?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you Midoriya me,\u201d Izuku replies hotly. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like children! Every little thing sends you two into these ridiculous pissbaby fights. Normal people don\u2019t behave like this!\u201d\nPissbaby, Todoroki mouths as Kacchan gets to his feet. \u201cChill, Deku. Is this about the socks?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Maybe! That\u2019s not the point!\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you tell me to chill, you big dumb meathead. You\u2019re the least chill person on the planet. I thought maybe you and Todoroki were finally learning to coexist but you can\u2019t go an hour without breaking something.\u201d\n\u201cWe are getting along,\u201d Todoroki says, wounded. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really trying to hurt each other this time.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Deku,\u201d Kacchan snaps. \u201cWhy do you think I invited his dumb ass over here in the first place? Have you ever in your life seen me willingly hang around anyone I don\u2019t want to?\u201d\n\u201cYou hang around me,\u201d says Izuku.\nKacchan puts his face in his hands and screams. Todoroki clambers off the bed and stands there for a second before awkwardly patting Kacchan on the back. \u201cMidoriya, do you think I hate you? Because I don\u2019t. I think you\u2019re great.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you either, you absolute dumbass,\u201d Kacchan says, which Izuku somehow doesn\u2019t find convincing. \u201cUse your dumb green head.\u201d\n\u201cI like him more,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cFuck you, no you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll prove it. Mariokart, one more round.\u201d\n\u201cNot Mario. Arm wrestling.\u201d\n\u201cJuggling.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck? When did you learn to juggle?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot to do as a kid.\u201d\n\u201cGuys,\u201d says Izuku, righteous fury having fizzled somewhat into righteous indignation. \u201cI have no doubt that you would find a way to compete over literally anything on earth but maybe let\u2019s not start that again right now.\u201d\nKacchan looks away from Todoroki to scowl at Izuku\u2019s feet. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll clean Deku\u2019s stupid socks. Whoever gets the stains out fastest wins.\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d says Todoroki, reaching out with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ll grab him, you get his feet.\u201d\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Izuku says again, and then yelps when Todoroki picks him up around the middle. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t want you to rescue my socks but do you even know what you\u2019re fighting about?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so heavy?\u201d Todoroki grunts in his ear.\n\u201cMuscle is a lot denser than it looks and I have been working out a little more recently because I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on Ojiro and\u2014I mean, you do know I can get my socks off on my own?\u201d\n\u201cShould have known the pretty boy was useless,\u201d Kacchan snorts, grabbing Izuku by the ankles and lifting. \u201cWhat the fuck? You are heavy. Hey, take your shirt off and show me your gains.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku says, planting his wet sock in Kacchan\u2019s face. \u201cPut me down, I\u2019m not a ragdoll! And quit pulling before you break my legs!\u201d\n\u201cYou break your own legs every month anyway!\u201d Kacchan retorts, soldiering through Izuku\u2019s gross feet trying to push him away. \u201cWould you fucking stay still?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d Izuku says and wriggles until Todoroki\u2019s clutching his armpits instead of around the waist. Todoroki grunts. Izuku\u2019s shirt is bunched up so it looks like a ridiculous blue crop top, and Kacchan lets go of one leg and sticks a finger into Izuku\u2019s bellybutton.\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019re ripped,\u201d Kacchan says begrudgingly. Todoroki makes a noise of appreciation and Izuku headbutts him under the chin. All three of them go toppling onto the floor.\nThe door opens. Kacchan\u2019s mother pokes her head in to see what all the fuss is about, and then snorts when she notices the pile of tangled limbs and outrage. \u201cOh. I thought you idiots were fighting again, but it looks like you\u2019ve sorted out your differences. Izuku, honey, you\u2019re looking good.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku huffs.\n\u201cYou kids need anything? Some snacks? Condoms?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell I assume there\u2019s a reason my stupid son invited his childhood crush over for the first time in years,\u201d Mrs Bakugou says, and then shuts the door quickly to avoid the wet sock Kacchan throws at her. \u201cOh, sorry. Do you like Todoroki now? You do stare at his ass a lot.\u201d\n\u201cMom, get out!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I blame you, he\u2019s a handsome kid.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Mrs Bakugou\u2019s mother,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cI am not afraid to fight you,\u201d Kacchan says. His mother cackles and shuts the door before he can scramble out from under Izuku\u2019s legs, so he ends up just faceplanting into the floorboards and screeching. Izuku stares at the back of Kacchan\u2019s neck and tries to figure out why it\u2019s getting so red.\n\u201cWe should have gone with juggling,\u201d says Todoroki.\nIzuku removes his head from Todoroki\u2019s stomach. \u201cTodoroki is your childhood crush? I thought you\u00a0 just met this year.\u201d\nTodoroki frowns at him. Kacchan\u2019s face is still pressed against the floor, but Izuku can distinctly imagine the expression he\u2019s making. \u201cI know the innocent Bambi thing is sort of your aesthetic, but I will not hesitate to hit you if you\u2019re mocking me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not mocking you!\u201d Izuku says. \u201cYour mom\u2019s right, Todoroki is good looking. It\u2019s not weird that you would like him.\u201d\nTodoroki picks at his jeans. \u201cYou think I\u2019m good looking? Wait. Bakugou likes me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I hate you,\u201d Kacchan says, lifting his head off the floor. \u201cAnd don\u2019t listen to my lunatic mother, alright? This is what I get for telling her anything, I swear to god. I\u2019m gonna tape over all her dumb fucking soap operas tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWait, but who\u2019s your childhood crush?\u201d\nKacchan sits up and stares at him. \u201cDeku. You cannot seriously be this fucking stupid.\u201d\nIzuku makes a face. \u201cDon\u2019t call me stupid.\u201d\n\u201cYou are stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI am not!\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d says Todoroki apologetically. \u201cI hate to say this, but you are a little bit dense.\u201d\n\u201cYou too?\u201d Izuku says, slightly hurt. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re ganging up on me.\u201d\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Kacchan says flatly. \u201cThere is one person in this room whom I have known since childhood.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d asks Izuku.\n\u201cSo who could that woman have been talking about?\u201d\nIzuku sits up and adjusts his shirt. \u201cBut you like Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cWhat in the flying fuck gave you that idea?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for weeks!\u201d Izuku cries. \u201cYou spend all of your time looking at each other or competing over something petty and childish. You can\u2019t keep your hands off each other. Last week I saw you on a date in McDonalds!\u201d\n\u201cThat was not a date!\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cWe spent the whole time talking about you!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki says, looking him in the eyes. \u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Izuku says, flustered.\nTodoroki opens his mouth, and then shuts it again. Sighing, he turns to Kacchan. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it. You\u2019d better get over here if you don\u2019t want to be left out.\u201d\n\u201cFuck that,\u201d Kacchan says, scrambling over to shove Todoroki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI call right.\u201d\n\u201cGuys?\u201d says Izuku.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Kacchan says, and presses his lips to Izuku\u2019s cheek. Todoroki kisses his other side, and Izuku goes rigid as they draw back and stare at him expectantly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis face is going to catch fire, and then he\u2019ll have to become the next Endeavour. \u201cUhm?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you understood,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cI thought you knew how I felt and you just didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cJesus Christ. I should have known. Deku wouldn\u2019t notice a come-on if you sat in his bed with your dick out.\u201d\n\u201cI would be very alarmed if you sat in my bed with your dick out,\u201d Izuku says shrilly. A voice in his head (that sounds like Iida\u2019s) points out that many events of the past month suddenly make a lot of sense. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god? Is this real?\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s having an aneurysm,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cHe has to pick.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want his heart to stop? He can pick later. Give him a minute to calm down.\u201d\n\u201cFuck that, I\u2019ve been waiting for ages. I\u2019m kissing him.\u201d\n\u201cFine. How are we going to do this? One of us has to go first.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him longer.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re also an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cI was an asshole. I\u2019m nice to him now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not capable of being nice. He thinks I\u2019m handsome.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Deku, I\u2019m better looking than he is, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re both very attractive,\u201d Izuku says, and then puts his face in his hands. His skin still tingles where they kissed him. Todoroki\u2019s lips are cool and smooth, and Kacchan\u2019s are warm and in need of a chapstick. \u201cToo attractive. Why me? I don\u2019t understand. I\u2014Kacchan hates me, and Todoroki, you\u2019re, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re out of my league. Is this why Iida keeps rolling his eyes at me? Was I the last one to know?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kacchan says. \u201cNow will you hurry up and pick one of us?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Izuku whimpers. \u201cYou\u2019re both\u2014this is crazy!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cUs both?\u201d\n\u201cGreedy,\u201d says Kacchan, looking Todoroki up and down. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not ugly, even if you do have a stupid colour palette.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I could tolerate you, even if you do look like an angry dandelion,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d says Izuku.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pick,\u201d says Kacchan. \u201cSo we will.\u201d\n\u201cWe pick you,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m going to be the one to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have my kids,\u201d says Kacchan.\n\u201cHow?\u201d says Izuku.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d says Todoroki, gently taking Izuku\u2019s hand away from his face. \u201cIida was right. Maybe we should learn to communicate better.\u201d\n\u201cNot our fault Deku\u2019s dense as a brick wall.\u201d\n\u201cI think that may be partly due to lack of self-esteem which is at least slightly your fault\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRock paper scissors,\u201d Kacchan interrupts. \u201cWinner gets his first kiss.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already had my first kiss,\u201d says Izuku. \u201cRemember that girl in kindergarten?\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d says Kacchan. \u201cWhere does she live?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cI suppose it doesn\u2019t matter now. I\u2019ll let you go first if Izuku sits in my lap.\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d says Kacchan, locking eyes with Izuku. He\u2019s very intense, Izuku thinks numbly. And actually kind of handsome. And his palms are very rough and for some reason he smells like caramel, which is probably the nitroglycerin. A pair of arms snake around his waist and, okay, maybe Izuku should pay better attention to his surroundings because Todoroki is behind him and pressing his mouth to the shell of Izuku\u2019s ear.\nHe shivers.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Kacchan. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess this works,\u201d Uraraka says, not looking very happy even as she says it. \u201cIt\u2019s better than just Bakugou, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve finally stopped fighting,\u201d Iida says, consolingly patting her on the arm. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not going to be cruel and say I told you so, Midoriya, because at least your other attempts worked out the way you wanted.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku says, going red. Todoroki\u2019s arm tightens around his shoulders, and Kacchan, who\u2019s sitting in Todoroki\u2019s lap with his feet resting on Izuku\u2019s knees, clears another level of Candy Crush.\nIzuku picks shyly at Kacchan\u2019s hem. The morning sun is refreshingly bright, and 1A\u2019s pre-homeroom chatter in the background is soothing. Everyone\u2019s milling about in their cliques. Kirishima\u2019s talking to Tetsu at the door, since Iida had nagged them both about intruding into the wrong classes. Hagakure\u2019s surrounded by her friends. Izuku can\u2019t quite tell, of course, but she seems to be distracted, glancing to the back of the class in Ojiro\u2019s direction. His tail swishes lazily back and forth, speeding up just a bit whenever she looks his way.\nIzuku\u2019s gaze drifts down to Iida\u2019s hand still resting comfortably on Uraraka\u2019s arm. He\u2019s got such big hands. Strong and safe. \u201cBy the way, Iida, I\u2019ve been meaning to say this for a while, but don\u2019t you think you and Uraraka would make a great couple?\u201d\n\u201cWe would,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cI just haven\u2019t asked him out yet. It was never really the right time.\u201d\nIida splutters. \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019re underage, and we have school and hero work to worry about, you know, the idea of romance at all is highly inappropriate, I don\u2019t think, I mean, such an idea is, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d Uraraka tells him. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you ice cream and I promise I\u2019ll ask for permission before holding your hand, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Iida meekly.\n\u201cCalled it,\u201d says Kacchan without looking up.\n\u201cI thought they were already together,\u201d says Todoroki, frowning.\nIzuku puts his chin in his hands as Iida tries to disappear slowly into his collar. \u201cI love love.\u201d\n\u201cGuess what I love,\u201d says Todoroki, nudging him. \u201cGo on. Guess.\u201d\n\u201cCold soba and crying over your lack of a father figure,\u201d says Kacchan.\nTodoroki calmly pushes him off his lap. The phone clatters to the floor and Kacchan lands on his behind. Iida sighs, and Kacchan does something pretty impressive with his legs to topple Todoroki\u2019s chair sideways.\nIzuku puts his face in his hands. Todoroki and Kacchan roll into someone\u2019s desk, and Uraraka picks up the phone to set about ruining Kacchan\u2019s winning streak.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on,\u201d Iida says quietly to Izuku. \u201cBut I can\u2019t truthfully say I mind.\u201d\n\u201cJoin the club,\u201d Izuku says his idiots scuffle on the floor. Everyone else ignores them. Izuku\u2019s learnt enough from watching Ojiro that they\u2019re not actually trying to hurt each other this time. He figures it\u2019s safe to ignore them too. \u201cHonestly? Just go with it. I think everything will work out just fine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay, Jirou. You and Yaomomo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre already dating.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku says, flashing her a thumbs up. She grins and saunters off to join the crowd of students stampeding off to lunch, one hand holding a soda bottle and the other sneaking comfortably into Yaoyorozu\u2019s blazer pocket. Uraraka goes to Iida\u2019s desk, and Iida, red-faced, offers her his arm so they can go to the cafeteria together.\nIzuku lets them go. They probably want some privacy. Kacchan and Todoroki wait for him by the door, but Izuku tells them to go on without him. He\u2019s already got lunch plans.\nHe finds Hitoshi in the courtyard by the fountain, very intently studying a pigeon wing on the ground. There\u2019s no bird attached. Just the wing, for some reason, with none of the feathers out of place.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but imagine,\u201d he says when Izuku comes up behind him, \u201cthat the pigeon must have dropped its wing like a lizard drops its tail when you startle it.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a lot better than imagining what must have happened to that poor bird.\u201d\n\u201cEaten, probably. Why leave the wing though?\u201d\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t like wings,\u201d Izuku says good naturedly. \u201cThey\u2019re not easy to eat. Fun when you fry them, though. Or barbecue them.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that this is where I first met Paul?\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019re calling him?\u201d Izuku asks, plopping bonelessly onto the stone edge of the fountain. The sound of running water almost makes him want to take a dip. Maybe he\u2019ll go to the pool on the weekend. \u201cOh, the tree\u2019s growing back. There\u2019s a little shoot coming out of the trunk, that\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\u201cThat tree is a survivor,\u201d Hitoshi says, sitting down next to him. \u201cIf I got blown up and then crushed by a solid block of ice, I wouldn\u2019t be growing any limbs back.\u201d\n\u201cHumans don\u2019t usually do that, I think.\u201d\n\u201cNot with that attitude. Lunch?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve actually got something to do today.\u201d Stretching his arms over his head, Izuku tilts his face up to catch some sunlight. \u201cBy the way, did you know that Todoroki and Kacchan apparently had a crush on me the whole time I was trying to set them up?\u201d\nHitoshi snorts. \u201cEverybody knew. You\u2019re the only person on the planet who didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cFigures,\u201d Izuku says, punching Hitoshi\u2019s shoulder when he laughs. \u201cWell, they told me. Finally. And also called me stupid a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYou probably deserved it,\u201d Hitoshi says. Izuku punches him again. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too upset about it, though. I take it to mean that you\u2019re happy with the way things turned out.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I am,\u201d Izuku says, nudging at the pebble with his shoe. \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring things out, but I think right now it fits. We fit. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\nHitoshi nods sagely. The bags under his eyes had always worried Izuku, but now they remind him less of restless nights and more of sleepovers spent binge-watching cartoons with your best friend. \u201cThere\u2019s this Korean restaurant that\u2019s just opened up near my place. I hear their kimchi soup is to die for.\u201d\n\u201cI like kimchi,\u201d says Hitoshi.\nIzuku knows. \u201cWould you like to go with me sometime? My treat. A proper thank-you for all the advice, even though you know I had the wrong idea. Bastard.\u201d\nHitoshi grins. \u201cWil your boyfriends mind?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to tail us to the restaurant and try to spy on us from another table. You game?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Hitoshi. His teeth are very white. Izuku thinks he should smile more. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk very loudly about how much fun we\u2019re having and how much we have in common.\u201d\n\u201cLike fluffy hair?\u201d\n\u201cAmong other things.\u201d Hitoshi fluffs up the top of Izuku\u2019s head, and Izuku giggles and bats him away. \u201cI\u2019m free on Saturday. I\u2019d buy dessert, but your bodyguards might actually beat me up. They already look kind of pissed.\u201d\n\u201cI told them they didn\u2019t have to follow me,\u201d Izuku sighs. He pats Hitoshi on the back and stands, laughing out loud when a white paw emerges from inside Hitoshi\u2019s blazer. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at half past noon at my house. I\u2019ll text you the address. Paul can come too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Izuku says, stirring more sugar into his tea. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t think it would work out as well as it did, but everything seems to be perfect for now.\u201d\nAll Might sits on the loveseat across from him, suit hanging off his shoulders and jacket pooling around his waist. It\u2019s a grey and orange pinstripe, which should be weird but somehow works. That may just be Izuku\u2019s hero-worship talking, though. All Might\u2019s one third the size that he normally is and Izuku still thinks he looks great.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some impressive analytical work on your part, young man,\u201d All Might tells him, making Izuku preen. \u201cI suppose that helping your friends find their happiness is heroic in its own right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Izuku says and nearly spills his tea. \u201cAnd Hagakure and Ojiro are so cute, and Tetsu and Kirishima are really nice and supportive, and Todoroki and Kacch\u2014uhm, Bakugou, they\u2019ve stopped fighting. Kind of. They\u2019re not actually drawing blood anymore, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThat was starting to become an issue.\u201d Delicately, All Might bites into a sandwich, chewing slowly so as not to upset his injured stomach. Teachers bustle around in the background, but nobody bothers their little corner of the staff room. \u201cMy. It\u2019s only been a month since we had lunch together. When I asked what you\u2019d been up to I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be this busy.\u201d\n\u201cIt sort of just happened,\u201d Izuku says and scratches the back of his neck. All Might smiles and offers him a banana cupcake. \u201cI mean, the thing with Kacchan and Todoroki. I was a little afraid to tell you, but I\u2019m kind of happy. They make me happy.\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve to be happy,\u201d All Might says, delighting Izuku. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Midoriya. You\u2019re not hard to love, and I\u2019m not surprised that you\u2019ve attracted the attention of those boys. You\u2019re going to make a good hero. I\u2019m glad I picked you.\u201d\nIzuku kicks his feet and eats his lunch. It\u2019s weird not having two warm bodies pressed against his sides, but for now he\u2019s content on a leather sofa with the person he\u2019d always wanted to be. All Might leans against the arm rest, relaxed and unguarded the way he can\u2019t be when he steps out from behind their four walls.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t mind. Without his quirk, without his persona, All Might\u2019s still always going to be a hero. Maybe one day Izuku will be too. That\u2019s a long way away, though. In the meantime, this is good.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Izuku says, sipping his tea. \u201cHave I mentioned my mother is single?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes your shirt actually say \u2018pants\u2019?\u201d asks Kacchan in disbelief.\nIzuku looks down at his chest. \u201cOh, yeah, I got it on sale. Cool, right?\u201d\nKacchan pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that stupid thing in my house. Go home and change.\u201d\n\u201cI just got here and you\u2019re sending me back?\u201d\n\u201cYou live down the street.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so far away,\u201d Izuku complains. \u201cJust let me in.\u201d\n\u201cYou can come, the shirt can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just take it off, then.\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes and sidles past Kacchan to get into the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here. Do you still have that big hole in the living from when you blasted yourself through the wall?\u201d\n\u201cWe patched that up,\u201d Kacchan says, face oddly blank. \u201cGo upstairs, Half-and-half is already here.\u201d\nIzuku takes the stairs up two at a time, bare feet thumping on the wood. Kacchan\u2019s house is largely the same as he remembers it, still tidy but marked with little reminders of their growing up. Scratches on furniture and burns that never quite scrubbed out, and cabinets that had to be rearranged every year to cover up Kacchan\u2019s noisy accidents. The hallway\u2019s bright yellow now, instead of cream, but underneath the new paint job there\u2019s a badly-drawn\u00a0 All Might in permanent marker because six-year-old Kacchan had decided that the house needed better d\u00e9cor.\nIzuku hesitantly turns the knob to Kacchan\u2019s room. \u201cHey, Todoroki. Wow, it\u2019s cold in here.\u201d\n\u201cAnti-summer measures,\u201d Kacchan says, kicking the door shut behind him as Izuku makes himself comfortable on the floor. Todoroki\u2019s in a soft grey button-down and jeans, leaning against the foot of Kacchan\u2019s bed with lordly composure.\n\u201cHow are you okay wearing a tank top?\u201d Izuku says, baffled.\n\u201cI\u2019m tough. You want food or something?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like a drink,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cI was asking Deku. You can go get your own,\u201d Kacchan replies.\nTodoroki scoffs. \u201cYou know, the first time I came here I was expecting to find Bakugou living in a dumpster. I thought that might explain his personality.\u201d\n\u201cGo home, then,\u201d Kacchan says, flipping him off.\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you hang out here often?\u201d Izuku says before Kacchan can start dragging Todoroki across the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty far for you to travel, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a nice house, though. Cosy.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan\u2019s parents have good taste,\u201d Izuku says, choosing not to mention that Kacchan\u2019s \u2018cosy\u2019 house is about five times the size of Izuku\u2019s apartment. \u201cWell, they would, obviously, being designers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve met them,\u201d Todoroki says. \u201cThey\u2019re wasted on him.\u201d\n\u201cDo me a favour and keep your daddy issues at home,\u201d says Bakugou, starting up the TV. It\u2019s an old flat screen, and he hooks it up to his laptop and hands Izuku a controller. \u201cPlay the tutorial or whatever. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nThey watch the intro and Izuku fumbles through the murder of a few hapless demons until Kacchan returns with snacks and some mugs. \u201cTea or coffee?\u201d\n\u201cTea,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cWrong, it\u2019s coffee,\u201d Kacchan says. Izuku snorts and immediately gets himself killed.\n\u201cAw, I thought I was starting to get the hang of it,\u201d he says sadly to the loading screen. \u201cDoom\u2019s very you, though, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s violent and tacky,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s asking you to stay. Here, Deku, milk and three sugars for your diabetic ass.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku says, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s iced? Kacchan, your room\u2019s already freezing.\u201d\n\u201cWear one of my hoodies,\u201d Kacchan says immediately, reaching for a conveniently folded square of cloth at the end of his bed. It\u2019s black and looks way too big for Izuku.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Todoroki urgently. \u201cWear mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a hoodie,\u201d Izuku points out.\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not,\u201d Todoroki says, obviously crestfallen. \u201cBecause my quirk\u2014 my quirk! My left side is warm. Sit next to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate using your left side,\u201d Kacchan says.\n\u201cYes. Now it\u2019s finally good for something,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit with him, Deku, there\u2019s no sense warming yourself on just one side. Take the hoodie.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my arm around you, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just turn the AC down?\u201d Izuku says.\n\u201cNo,\u201d say Kacchan and Todoroki at the same time.\nIzuku rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a mad dash for the remote before Izuku can even put his coffee down. The air conditioning gets colder, then warmer, then colder again, and Kacchan and Todoroki wrestle on the floor and bump into furniture until Kacchan\u2019s mother comes in and yells at them to stop wasting electricity.\nIt\u2019s a lot more comfortable after that. Izuku sips his coffee while Todoroki lies face-down on the floor and Kacchan tries to pull him out the door by his ankle. \u201cThis game\u2019s soundtrack is pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you liked pop,\u201d Kacchan grunts. Todoroki kicks lazily at his shins. He reminds Izuku of a housecat who won\u2019t get off its owner\u2019s laptop, and Izuku turns away so they don\u2019t see him smile.\n\u201cThis is good too. Is it only single player, though? I don\u2019t want to hog the controller.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll watch,\u201d says Todoroki, making a soft skidding noise as he slides across the floor.\n\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says, exiting the game. \u201cDo you have more controllers? Let\u2019s play something else with co-op.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s that dumb cooking game Half-and-half likes,\u201d Kacchan says, dropping Todoroki\u2019s leg. \u201cThe one where you fight a giant meatball?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fight him, you feed him,\u201d Todoroki says, sitting upright. \u201cThe maps change so you have to work together.\u201d\n\u201cTogether, huh,\u201d Izuku says, eyeing the Wii in the corner. \u201cHey, Kacchan, do you still have Mario Kart? You used to be so good at that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good at Mario Kart too,\u201d says Todoroki quickly. \u201cI could beat him.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell,\u201d says Bakugou. \u201cYou\u2019re on, candy ass.\u201d\nIzuku grins. \u201cI\u2019m in the mood for some friendly competition. Best two out of three?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not friendly. It doesn\u2019t end at three games, either.\nIzuku\u2019s coffee cup sits forgotten on the floor, melted ice leaving rings of condensation that drip down the sides and onto the floor. They\u2019ve eaten six packets of chips between them. Kacchan won\u2019t stop screaming at the screen, and Todoroki\u2019s threatened to ice his bedroom more than once.\n\u201cGet out of my\u00a0fucking face, Yoshi,\u201d Kacchan barks, jerking around wildly as he steers. Todoroki grumbles something under his breath and leans forward, bangs falling into his eyes as his little Yoshi sprite takes a corner.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Bowser, and then I\u2019m going to kill you for picking him.\u201d\nIzuku whines, firmly in fifth place and driving a cute pink car because for some reason they\u2019d bullied him into using Princess Peach. \u201cNo, I missed a power up! Peach! Peach, why can\u2019t you drift?\u201d\n\u201cShe can drift, you just suck ass\u2014\u00a0did you just fucking banana peel me you dickbag asshole?\u201d\nYoshi takes first place. Todoroki pumps both fists in the air while Kacchan hollers at the scoreboard. \u201cCheap trick! I would have won if you hadn\u2019t killed me off at the last second!\u201d\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d Todoroki retorts, tossing his head. \u201cFour-three. I am the superior racer.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you and fuck your Smedley references,\u201d Kacchan hoots angrily. \u201cAgain! We\u2019re not stopping until I\u2019ve obliterated you!\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even won once,\u201d Izuku sighs. He\u2019s not terribly bothered, though. Kacchan and Todoroki are vibrating with energy, focused on each other and the game and rage-eating their way through all of Kacchan\u2019s pantry. Todoroki\u2019s animated in a way Izuku never usually seen him, and Kacchan\u2019s mother\u2019s already come in twice to tell him to stop screeching but he clearly hasn\u2019t listened. Izuku couldn\u2019t get them more hyped up on adrenaline if he threw them into a sudden death match against All Might.\nThe next map loads and Izuku almost forgets to drive. Kacchan\u2019s knee is pressed against Todoroki\u2019s, although neither of them have noticed. He\u2019s never seen them touch before. Hit each other, yeah, but not like this, casually and without intention to hurt. Not like they\u2019re\u00a0friends.\n\u201cOut of my way! How does my entire ass taste, Deku?\u201d\n\u201cLast place just means I can blue shell you, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck, you better not.\u201d\n\u201cDo it, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI will\u00a0kick your ass,\u00a0stay\u00a0away\u00a0from that power up\u2014son of a bitch.\u201d\nTodoroki snorts as Bowser goes careening off a cliff. Yoshi, once again, takes first place. \u201cHow does\u00a0my\u00a0ass taste?\u201d\nKacchan tackles him. Todoroki goes rolling onto his back and both controllers clatter on the floor, and Izuku scrambles to rescue them before they can get destroyed. Kacchan\u2019s got Todoroki in a headlock. Todoroki manages to pull Kacchan\u2019s shirt over his head, blinding him for long enough to shove him over and jam an elbow in his sternum.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how I wanted you to work off your aggression,\u201d Izuku sighs, and then yelps when they knock over his coffee cup. \u201cMy All Might socks!\u201d\n\u201cFuck your All Might socks,\u201d Kacchan wheezes. \u201cWash them later.\u201d\n\u201cCoffee stains! My mom got these for me!\u201d\nThey ignore him. Izuku, feet wet and All Might dyed brunet, feels the first spikes of irritation he\u2019s had in a long time.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d\u00a0he says, yanking Todoroki bodily off of Kacchan and tossing him onto the bed. Todoroki bounces on the mattress and lands on his back. \u201cCan you two morons stop trying to cripple each other every other day?\u201d\nTodoroki blinks, either from the shock of being thrown or from the shock of being called a moron. \u201cMidoriya?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you\u00a0Midoriya\u00a0me,\u201d Izuku replies hotly. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like children! Every little thing sends you two into these ridiculous pissbaby fights. Normal people don\u2019t behave like this!\u201d\nPissbaby,\u00a0Todoroki mouths as Kacchan gets to his feet. \u201cChill, Deku. Is this about the socks?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Maybe! That\u2019s not the point!\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t\u00a0you\u00a0tell me to chill, you big dumb meathead. You\u2019re the least chill person on the planet. I thought maybe you and Todoroki were finally learning to coexist but you can\u2019t go an hour without breaking something.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u00a0are\u00a0getting along,\u201d Todoroki says, wounded. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really trying to hurt each other this time.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Deku,\u201d Kacchan snaps. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging out with him voluntarily for\u00a0your\u00a0sake, because you\u2019re so insistent that everybody holds hands and get along. I feed him. I have him in my house after school. I binge-watched all his favourite TV shows. We\u2019re acting like\u00a0best fucking friends\u00a0over here. What the hell else do we have to do to prove that? Do I have to make out with him in front of you so your stupid green head understands we don\u2019t hate each other?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Izuku.\nKacchan\u2019s mouth clicks shut. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really meant that,\u201d Todoroki says after a second.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes. \u201cA girl kissed him on the cheek once and he cried because he thought she\u2019d given him cooties.\u201d\n\u201cI was\u00a0seven,\u201d\u00a0Kacchan says, throwing his hands up.\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t changed! All you know how to do is study and punch things. You\u2019re afraid to let Todoroki know he\u2019s important to you. Even the thought of physical affection scares you!\u201d\nTodoroki clears his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think kissing me really has anything to do with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am not scared,\u201d Kacchan says quietly.\nIzuku looks him in the eye. \u201cChicken.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Kacchan roars, stomping over to his double bed and grabbing Todoroki by the collar. \u201cI\u2019ll show\u00a0you\u00a0who\u2019s fucking scared of physical affection! Come here, you!\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d says Todoroki. \u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPucker up, Shortcake,\u201d Kacchan growls and kisses Todoroki full on the mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMario Kart music continues to play from the TV. Sunlight streams through the window, and Izuku\u2019s spilled iced coffee sits in a murky puddle that will no doubt stain the floorboards forever. Torodoki\u2019s hands, which had been pressed to Kacchan\u2019s chest to push him away, slowly relax and migrate up to rest on Kacchan\u2019s jaw. Izuku counts ten seconds before they break apart and come up for air.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Kacchan says.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki says, and kisses him again.\nForgotten in the background, wet socks and all, Izuku cheers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you did it,\u201d says Uraraka, patting Izuku on the back and making him glance shyly away. \u201cYou\u2019ve stopped the fighting for good. I believed in you from the very start, I want you to know that.\u201d\n\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Iida says. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t like the idea of you meddling like that, I have to say everything worked out exactly how you wanted. Well done, Midoriya.\u201d\nIzuku leans back happily in his seat. The morning sun is refreshingly bright, and 1A\u2019s pre-homeroom chatter in the background is soothing. Everyone\u2019s milling about in their cliques. Kirishima\u2019s talking to Tetsu at the door, since Iida had nagged them both about intruding into the wrong classes. Hagakure\u2019s surrounded by her friends. Izuku can\u2019t quite tell, of course, but she seems to be distracted, glancing to the back of the class in Ojiro\u2019s direction. His tail swishes lazily back and forth, speeding up just a bit whenever she looks his way.\nKacchan\u2019s in Todoroki\u2019s lap. He\u2019s using him as a chair, more accurately, because Todoroki had decided that morning to sit in Kacchan\u2019s seat instead of his own. He\u2019s almost completely blocked from view, face pressed between Kacchan\u2019s shoulder blades and arms dangling limply at his sides while Kacchan plays candy crush on Todoroki\u2019s phone.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d says Todoroki.\n\u201cDie, then,\u201d says Kacchan.\n\u201cSo romantic,\u201d Izuku sighs.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s an improvement,\u201d Iida says. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see Kaminari again. He came in, took one look at them and then walked back out.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably just having some trouble processing it,\u201d Uraraka says, patting Iida on the arm. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s a little weirded out. They\u00a0were\u00a0assaulting each other just a month ago.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now they\u2019re in love!\u201d Izuku says, clapping his hands together gleefully. \u201cOr like. Or lust. Maybe lust, actually. They kissed for a really long time. I think they forgot I was there. I mean I left after a couple of minutes, but I could have sworn I saw Kacchan\u2019s shirt get tossed out the window when I was going home.\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cDo not,\u201d says Iida.\n\u201cAnd now everything is perfect,\u201d says Izuku. \u201cI love love.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing the lord\u2019s work, Deku-kun,\u201d Uraraka says seriously. \u201cMaybe you can start a matchmaking service if you ever get tired of being a hero.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, Midoriya is never going to get tired of being a hero,\u201d says Iida. \u201cSecondly, how do you really think that\u2019s going to work out? Nobody\u2019s going to care about the matchmaking. They\u2019ll just use it as an excuse to spend an hour alone with him.\u201d\n\u201cIf he gets paid for it, at least everyone\u2019s happy,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cThanks, Iida, but I really don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to want to pay to hang out with me. I\u2019m not sure that many people would even do it for free,\u201d Izuku says, not understanding why Iida sighs so loudly. \u201cI guess helping people find love is kind of like hero work, though. Do we know any love-based heroes?\u201d\nUraraka tilts her head. \u201cMiss Midnight\u2019s the closest one I can think of, but I\u2019m not sure her whole theme counts as\u00a0love, exactly.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Izuku hums in response. Iida nods, and Izuku\u2019s gaze drifts down to Uraraka\u2019s hand still resting comfortably on his arm. She\u2019s got such cute fingers, like a cat\u2019s. And Iida\u2019s hands are so big. Strong and safe, completely relaxed. Idly, Izuku wonders when the two of them got close enough to share casual touch. \u201cHey. Thanks. For humouring me, I guess. I know this whole thing was kind of silly to begin with.\u201d\nUraraka furrows her brows. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t silly, Deku-kun. You got three whole couples together in a month. You did well.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Izuku says, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cAlthough I think I might have given Iida a stress ulcer.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the people in this class are contributing to my stress ulcer,\u201d Iida says, pushing up his glasses. \u201cIs something bothering you, Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d be happier about this,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cYou were all smiles just a minute ago.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku says, glancing at her hand on Iida\u2019s arm again. He is happy. Mostly. \u201cI just, I dunno. Don\u2019t mind me. You guys are great. I, uhm. I don\u2019t know if I ever told you this, but you two are the first real friends I\u2019ve made in, like, ever. I never used to have any back in middle school. And you\u2019ve always been super nice to me even though you didn\u2019t have to be. I know I\u2019m nothing special. But I\u2019m really lucky to have you two.\u201d\nUraraka\u2019s expression crumples. She lets go of Iida and reaches out like she\u2019s not sure if she wants to take Izuku\u2019s hand or leave him be. \u201cOh, Deku-kun. You\u2019re way too hard on yourself.\u201d\nIida sighs. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cNo, this has been going on long enough,\u201d Iida says. \u201cMidoriya. Do you want to know the real reason Bakugou and Todoroki have been fighting every day for so long? It\u2019s because of you. They\u2019ve been fighting over you.\u201d\nIzuku frowns. \u201cI made them fight?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to say they both like you,\u201d Uraraka says kindly. \u201cOr used to, anyway, until you got them to like each other. Bakugou started being nicer to you because he had a crush on you. Todoroki was trying to keep him away from you because he wanted to be your boyfriend instead.\u201d\nIzuku parses this. His face goes very warm very quickly. \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\u201cYes way,\u201d says Iida. \u201cI know you have terrible self-esteem, but think about it. They try so hard to impress you. They follow you around and keep trying to do things for you. They\u2019re like puppies falling all over each other to get your attention.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Izuku says. Whines, really, putting his face in his hands. \u201cOh my god, why? That can\u2019t be true.\u201d\n\u201cDeku-kun,\u201d Uraraka says, tugging one hand away so she can look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about you to like.\u201d\n\u201cLike what? I\u2019m plain and short and I took forever to learn how to use my quirk and I talk to myself and I\u2019m kind of a nerd and-\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d says Iida. \u201cAll Might chose you for a reason. People are drawn to you for a reason.\u201d\n\u201cBut- but why did you encourage me? If you thought they liked me, why\u2019d you let me set them up?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Bakugou doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d Uraraka says hotly. \u201cNot after being so mean to you. Not after he helped make you think nobody would like you. And Todoroki, well. He\u2019s nice, but if anyone\u2019s going to date Bakugou, it might as well be him.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d asks Iida.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d asks Uraraka.\n\u201cJust a hunch,\u201d says Iida mildly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding Midoriya\u2019s hand for a while now.\u201d\nUraraka goes beet red and lets go. \u201cYou-! Shut up, Iida! Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t crumple the second he gives you the doe eyes.\u201d\nIida\u2019s ears go pink, which is fascinating considering his expression doesn\u2019t actually change. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou do! You said you wouldn\u2019t speak to him again after he got himself put in detention and then what did you do?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he was sorry!\u201d\n\u201cHe said he missed you and you almost cried!\u201d\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Izuku squeaks. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d\n\u201cIida likes you,\u201d says Uraraka.\n\u201cUraraka likes you,\u201d says Iida.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Izuku.\nIida pinches the bridge of his nose. Izuku\u2019s heart is thumping hard, threatening to beat right out of his ribcage and go running for cover. \u201cAlright. Fine,\u201d Iida says. \u201cI will admit that I find Midoriya, uhm. Attractive. But that doesn\u2019t mean anything, necessarily!\u201d\n\u201cDang it. Me too. You don\u2019t have to say it back, though, Deku-kun,\u201d Uraraka says, nervously tucking her hair behind her ear. Her blush spreads across her nose and cheeks like a sunburn. She\u2019s so pretty. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested, that\u2019s totally okay. We don\u2019t have to talk about it again. Anyway, I wouldn\u2019t want to make it awkward. It\u2019s not like you have to choose between us, you know?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d says Iida. His hand-choppy thing is oddly subdued. \u201cI mean, Uraraka\u2019s very attractive too, and maybe you don\u2019t like boys, which is perfectly alright, of course-\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d asks Uraraka.\n\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Izuku blurts out without thinking. \u201cYou both are.\u201d\nIida runs his hand through his hair. He\u2019s just trying to get it out of his hair, Izuku knows, but he can\u2019t help but watch. Uraraka fiddles with the end of her tie. \u201cDo you want,\u201d she starts and then stops. \u201cDo you guys want to go out for ice cream after school? On a date?\u201d\n\u201cAll three of us?\u201d Izuku says hesitantly.\nIida splutters. \u201cExcuse me.\u00a0We\u2019re underage, and we have school and hero work to worry about, you know, the idea of romance at all is highly inappropriate, I don\u2019t think, I mean, such an idea is, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d Uraraka says, smiling crookedly. \u201cI promise me and Deku-kun will ask permission before holding your hand.\u201d\n\u201cYou do have two hands,\u201d Izuku says, heart fluttering. His cheeks hurt from smiling right now. He probably looks ridiculous. \u201cUhm. Are you guys sure about this? You\u2019d make a great couple even without me, and I seriously wouldn\u2019t mind at all if-\u201d\n\u201cDeku-kun,\u201d says Uraraka. \u201cIzuku. It\u2019s okay. We can, uhm. We\u2019ll take it slow. Right, Iida?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d says Iida, trying to disappear into his collar. \u201cI- yes. This is fine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Izuku says, hiding a smile in his hands. His heart feels warm and light. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay, Jirou. You and Yaomomo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre already dating.\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Izuku says, flashing her a thumbs up. She grins and saunters off to join the crowd of students stampeding off to lunch, one hand holding a soda bottle and the other sneaking comfortably into Yaoyorozu\u2019s blazer pocket. Uraraka wanders over to Izuku\u2019s desk. \u201cYou wanna have lunch?\u201d\n\u201cI have plans today,\u201d Izuku says, feeling giddy and shy. \u201cBut I\u2019ll see you right after.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She goes to find Iida, and Iida, red-faced, offers her his arm so they can go to the cafeteria together.\nIzuku watches them go. Kacchan and Todoroki wait for him by the door, but Izuku tells them to go on without him. He\u2019s already got lunch plans.\nHe finds Hitoshi in the courtyard by the fountain, very intently studying a pigeon wing on the ground. There\u2019s no bird attached. Just the wing, for some reason, with none of the feathers out of place.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but imagine,\u201d he says when Izuku comes up behind him, \u201cthat the pigeon must have dropped its wing like a lizard drops its tail when you startle it.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a lot better than imagining what must have happened to that poor bird.\u201d\n\u201cEaten, probably. Why leave the wing though?\u201d\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t like wings,\u201d Izuku says good naturedly. \u201cThey\u2019re not easy to eat. Fun when you fry them, though. Or barbecue them.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that this is where I first met Paul?\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you\u2019re calling him?\u201d Izuku asks, plopping bonelessly onto the stone edge of the fountain. The sound of running water almost makes him want to take a dip. Maybe he\u2019ll go to the pool on the weekend. \u201cOh, the tree\u2019s growing back. There\u2019s a little shoot coming out of the trunk, that\u2019s so cute.\u201d\n\u201cThat tree is a survivor,\u201d Hitoshi says, sitting down next to him. \u201cIf I got blown up and then crushed by a solid block of ice, I wouldn\u2019t be growing any limbs back.\u201d\n\u201cHumans don\u2019t usually do that, I think.\u201d\n\u201cNot with that attitude. Lunch?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve actually got something to do today.\u201d Stretching his arms over his head, Izuku tilts his face up to catch some sunlight.\u00a0\u201cBy the way, Project 1 was a great success. Kacchan and Todoroki like each other now. They kissed a few days ago while we were at Kacchan\u2019s place. It was really satisfying. Like when you\u2019re reading a story and wondering if the main characters will ever fall in love even though you\u00a0know\u00a0they\u2019d be perfect for each other, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call either of\u00a0them\u00a0the main character,\u201d Hitoshi says, inspecting his nails. \u201cThose two owe me some money. I have to ask, though. You\u2019re aware they\u2019re kind of head over heels for you, right?\u201d\nIzuku punches his arm. \u201cPeople keep saying that. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cReally? I would have assumed they would have confessed to you. Maybe right after fighting over something stupid like who gets to wash your socks.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s silly,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cAnyway, uhm. I\u2019m about to go on a date with someone else.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cIida and Uraraka.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d Hitoshi says, scratching his chin. \u201cI knew those two would end up together somehow. This is a great development.\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d says Izuku, looking up. The bags under Hitoshi\u2019s eyes had always worried Izuku, but now they remind him less of restless nights and more of sleepovers spent binge-watching cartoons with your best friend. \u201cSay. There\u2019s this Korean restaurant that\u2019s just opened up near my place. I hear their kimchi soup is to die for.\u201d\n\u201cI like kimchi,\u201d says Hitoshi.\nIzuku knows. \u201cWould you like to go with me sometime? My treat. A proper thank-you for all the advice, even though you know I had the wrong idea. Bastard.\u201d\nHitoshi grins. \u201cWill your new lovers mind?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call them that,\u201d Izuku says, gently kicking his ankle. \u201cBut, no. They won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll buy dessert.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d He pats Hitoshi on the back and stands, laughing out loud when a white paw emerges from inside Hitoshi\u2019s blazer. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at half past noon at my house. I\u2019ll text you the address. Paul can come too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Izuku says, stirring more sugar into his tea. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t think it would work out as well as it did, but everything seems to be perfect for now.\u201d\nAll Might sits on the loveseat across from him, suit hanging off his shoulders and jacket pooling around his waist. It\u2019s a grey and orange pinstripe, which should be weird but somehow works. That may just be Izuku\u2019s hero-worship talking, though. All Might\u2019s one third the size that he normally is and Izuku still thinks he looks great.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some impressive analytical work on your part, young man,\u201d All Might tells him, making Izuku preen. \u201cI suppose that helping your friends find their happiness is heroic in its own right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said!\u201d Izuku says and nearly spills his tea. \u201cAnd Hagakure and Ojiro are so cute, and Tetsu and Kirishima are really nice and supportive, and Todoroki and Kacch\u2014uhm, Bakugou, they\u2019ve stopped fighting. Kind of. They\u2019re not actually drawing blood anymore, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u00a0was\u00a0starting to become an issue.\u201d Delicately, All Might bites into a sandwich, chewing slowly so as not to upset his injured stomach. Teachers bustle around in the background, but nobody bothers their little corner of the staff room. \u201cMy. It\u2019s only been a month since we had lunch together. When I asked what you\u2019d been up to I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be\u00a0this\u00a0busy.\u201d\n\u201cIt all sort of just happened,\u201d Izuku says and scratches the back of his neck. All Might smiles and offers him a banana cupcake. \u201cEspecially the thing with Iida and Uraraka. I was a little afraid to tell you, but I\u2019m kind of happy. They make me happy.\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve to be happy,\u201d All Might says, delighting Izuku. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Midoriya. You\u2019re not hard to love. You\u2019re going to make a good hero. I\u2019m glad I picked you.\u201d\nIzuku kicks his feet and eats his lunch. He\u2019s nervous and excited for how his future will turn out, but for now he\u2019s content on a leather sofa with the person he\u2019d always wanted to be. All Might leans against the arm rest, relaxed and unguarded the way he can\u2019t be when he steps out from behind their four walls.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t mind. Without his quirk, without his persona, All Might\u2019s still always going to be a hero. Maybe one day Izuku will be too. That\u2019s a long way away, though. In the meantime, this is good.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Izuku says, sipping his tea. \u201cHave I mentioned my mother is single?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
