    "text": "Shota Aizawa, being a teacher for 6 years, was used to seeing his students out in the real world occasionally. Mostly, they\u2019d exchange a wave or depending on their level of fear of him, run in the opposite direction. Sometimes, a student would come up to him and chat. None of these encounters were ever shocking or surprising to him. That is, until 2 a.m at a 24-hour grocery store, during summer break. Of course, if anyone was to give him a surprising encounter, he knew it would be from his 3-A class. The class who over the last three years had forged bonds due to shared trauma, villain attacks, and a general lack of personal boundaries. If he had to take a guess, he would have thought at 2 a.m he would have run into Tokoyami, his son Hitoshi, or even a member of the self-proclaimed Bakasquad who would probably be getting snacks. So, seeing his Number One Problem Child out so late was already a little unsettling. Then he looked at him and he realized, this could NOT have been his problem child. The person was lost in their own world, listening to music while dancing down the aisle, stopping occasionally to put something in their cart. This in itself was a little strange, as his Problem Child, otherwise known as Izuku Midoriya, was a rather shy and guarded person.\nOver the last three years, he\u2019d physically changed, growing about an inch taller than Shota himself, and losing his previous scrawny frame. He resembled a pro hero more than a student, something Shota thought many in his 3-A class deserved after their hard work, even if he hadn\u2019t said that out loud. Even with all his physical changes, he still stayed shy with others. So, seeing him so open was surprising, yet it was the least surprising thing about the scene in front of him.\nMidoriya was wearing black rimmed glasses, which Shota was unaware that he needed. He was in a black shirt that had its sleeves cut practically all the way to the bottom of the shirt, showing his arms and the multitude of scars that ran down them. There were scars that Shota recognized as being cause by his own quirk, but there were also scars he\u2019d never seen before. Shota was too far away to see them clearly, but anytime Midoriya moved his arms, his ribs were exposed and it looked like more scarring was on his torso. The scars, from what he could make out, looked old and healed over. Shota wracked his brain trying to think of a time when Midoriya could have gotten those scars before, yet he couldn\u2019t come up with anything. The other shocking thing, was that scars weren\u2019t the only thing that was on Midoriya\u2019s skin. There were multiple tattoos as well. He couldn\u2019t make out exact words or details, but he could see black and color running down one arm making up a half sleeve, stopping just above his elbow. There was also color that seemed to be on his torso, near the scars on his ribs. Shota himself had two small tattoos, so he was not opposed to seeing them on another person, but he was concerned on how different the person in front of him was to his student. At this point, he was beginning to think that Midoriya had a brother, whom he just didn\u2019t talk about.\nHe seemed to come out of his shock and thoughts as Midoriya turned the corner and left the aisle, not once looking at him or acknowledging his gawking. The Midoriya he knew had much better situational awareness, so maybe it WAS a brother. Forgetting about his own shopping, he left his cart and followed after his could-be-student. He next found him, headphones now slung over his shoulder, talking animatedly to the cashier, who was scanning his items. Unfortunately, Shota was too far away to hear their conversation. Instead, he listened to the hum of the refrigeration cooler next to him.\nThe could-be-student left after a few moments, taking his two bags with him, with Shota still following behind him. No longer in the well-lit store, it was easier for the underground hero to stalk after him. Shota didn\u2019t remember Midoriya\u2019s address, but he had a vague remembrance of the place from the home visit they did to tell the parents about the dorm construction. He didn\u2019t remember the apartment being on the sketchier part of town, but alas, they walked farther away from the nice parts of town, and more towards the area that he patrolled at night.\nHe heard a phone start ringing, and quickly reached for his own, but the person in front of him did the same. Shuffling the bags into one hand.\n\u201cHello?\u201d A concerned tone took to what Shota recognized as Midoriya\u2019s voice. Shota listened attentively, wishing he could hear the other side of the conversation. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay Pumpkin, you aren\u2019t bothering me. Tell me what\u2019s wrong, did something happen? Are you okay?\u201d The voice was gentle, comforting, calming. For a few minutes, all he heard was the person\u2019s occasional sound of acknowledgment, probably so the other person would know he was still listening. \u201cYou\u2019re okay now, it was just a dream. I\u2019m okay. You don\u2019t have to worry. If it would make you feel better, do you want to go get ice cream tomorrow? I\u2019m sure Toshi wouldn\u2019t mind bringing you, we can bribe him with going to the cat caf\u00e9 too. Then, you\u2019ll be able to see that I\u2019m perfectly fine. Does that make you feel better? Okay good, I\u2019m glad. Is there something else?\u201d The figure started moving again towards a slightly rundown apartment building. Shota had a sinking feeling that he knew who this person was talking to. He was confident that it was his own daughter, Eri. He was now even more curious because from the conversation he\u2019d been hearing. It didn\u2019t sound like this is the first time his daughter had called his student in the middle of the night. He was even more concerned that neither his 9 year old nor his student had talked to him about these late night calls before. \u201cI know it looked bad, but I\u2019m okay. Your dad is too. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s done with his patrol by now, you can give him a call you know. Or if you don\u2019t want to do that, why don\u2019t you go get in bed with Toshi, he\u2019ll protect you from all the bad dreams. If not, I\u2019ll beat him up for you.\u201d He took on a teasing tone, and Shota was now 100% sure that it was Eri on the phone. He was beginning to feel guilty for taking time stalking his now confirmed student instead of getting home. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Pumpkin, I don\u2019t think your dads would like that-\u201d\nThe conversation was immediately cut off from Shota\u2019s ears by the apartment complex door shutting behind Midoriya. Shota was now very concerned, confused, and curious as to what Midoriya was telling his 9-year-old daughter he wouldn\u2019t like.\nPart of him wondered if it was Midoriya that told Eri not to talk to anyone about these late night conversations. He tried to push the growing concern out of his mind, because he knew that to Eri, Midoriya was her hero. She thought the sun rose and set over the boy, and he knew that Midoriya loved Eri like a little sister, similarly to Mirio. Both boys had watched Eri and taken her out multiple times. She had even stayed with Mirio and Tamaki while Shota, Hizashi, and the students went on overnight trips. There weren\u2019t many things that Shota thought Eri could ask them for that he wouldn\u2019t like.\nHe turned away from the apartment complex and started making his way to his own home. There were too many things that weren\u2019t adding up for him. Too many of his world views had been altered in such a short period of time for him to think clearly. The first thing he was going to solve was what Eri asked Midoriya. Then he would worry about the 180-degree difference in the Midoriya that he just seen and the one at school.\nOnce he was finally at home, he immediately went to Eri\u2019s room, seeing that she was still in her bed, her cell phone still next to her, and she was clutching a stuffed unicorn that Midoriya had given her.\n\u201cEri?\u201d He kept his voice low as to not alarm the rest of the house. \u201cI know you\u2019re not sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d A small voice asked out from the darkness.\n\u201cYou were just talking to Midoriya, weren\u2019t you?\u201d He made his way into the room, turning on the small lamp next to Eri\u2019s bed and took a seat next to her while he asked. He saw the shock sweep over her face and she glanced to her phone.\n\u201cDid he tell you?\u201d There was a tone of betrayal in her voice that Shota hadn\u2019t heard before.\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. I saw him while I was finishing up patrol and overheard him talking to you. He didn\u2019t know I was there at all. He didn\u2019t tell me you called him.\u201d He saw her visibly relax at his words. It seemed that it wasn\u2019t Midoriya that wanted to keep these calls secret after all. \u201cDid you have a nightmare?\u201d She looked down and nodded slowly. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d She hesitated before clutching the unicorn again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. \u2018Zuku helped. I know it wasn\u2019t real. He\u2019s still okay, I know that now.\u201d Her voice was small, but there was a definite tone about it. Like she was still trying to convince herself of that fact.\n\u201cYou know, you can talk to me about your nightmares too.\u201d Shota reached out and pet her head, comforting her. She nodded, but didn\u2019t respond. \u201cYou asked Midoriya for something and he said I wouldn\u2019t like that, what did you ask for?\u201d The question that burned on the tip of his tongue finally came out.\n\u201cI wanted Toshi and I to have a movie night and spend the night at \u2018Zuku\u2019s like I do with Mirio, but he always says you wouldn\u2019t like if I stayed over.\u201d Sadness laced her voice as she spoke. Shota sat back, confused. Why hasn\u2019t Midoriya ever asked him about this? Of course, he would question it now, seeing as he apparently didn\u2019t know Midoriya at all, but before tonight, he couldn\u2019t think of a reason why he would have been against it.\nEspecially with Hitoshi joining them. He remembered Mrs. Midoriya being a very kind woman, he couldn\u2019t see her being opposed to it either.\n\u201cHow about I talk to him about it? Maybe we can work something out while we\u2019re on break, and maybe you and Hitoshi can do that. That\u2019s not a yes, but we can talk about it, okay?\u201d He tried not to get her hopes up all the way, but he saw a sparkle hit her eyes and she launched herself at him.\n\u201cYou mean it!?\u201d She squealed happily and he was sure everyone in the house was woken up by it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it, no promises. If anything, maybe we\u2019ll just have Midoriya stay the night here and have a movie night. That could work too, right?\u201d She answered with an eager nod to her head. \u201cNow, one last question before you\u2019re going back to sleep. How often are you calling Midoriya this late at night?\u201d Suddenly she pulled back into herself and looked away.\n\u201cI call whenever I have a nightmare.\u201d She finally answered. Shota knew about the nightmares. She was in therapy, and after all that she went through, it was to be expected, but her calling every time she had one, was not expected. \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t mind. Sometimes it\u2019s so I can make sure that he\u2019s still here. Especially after I see fights where he gets hurt, I dream that he doesn\u2019t get back up. Or, I dream about when he rescued me and in the dream I use my quirk too much and he disappears. Other times it's because I know that he understands what it\u2019s like to be hurt.\u201d She finished her justification looking down at the scars on her arms caused by Overhaul. It only brought more questions to Shota\u2019s head.\n\n'I know that he understands what it\u2019s like to be hurt.'\n\nHe wanted to think that the scars he\u2019d earned were due to his quirk, but he now knew that there were other scars on Midoriya\u2019s body. He once again felt like he didn\u2019t know his student at all.\nAs much as he wanted to press these issues, he knew he needed to keep his word to Eri.\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll talk more about this in the morning, for now, you need to go back to sleep. If you have another nightmare, you can come get me, okay?\u201d She nodded and began to get more comfortable, still clutching the stuffed unicorn.\n\u201cYou promise to talk to \u2018Zuku about the movie night?\u201d She asked once she was settled in. Shota nodded his head.\n\u201cI will. Sweet dreams.\u201d He flipped the light and made his way out of the room. A small, \u2018you too\u2019 followed after him.\nHe stood in the hall, unsure of what his next move was. It wasn\u2019t much later than when Eri called him. Should HE call Midoriya? How inappropriate was it to call a student at \u2013Shota looked down at his phone- 3:14 a.m? He sighed loudly.\n\u201cYou good over there?\u201d A tired voice came from behind him, and Shota instantly knew his next move.\n\u201cHitoshi, why are you awake?\u201d Shota asked the purple haired insomniac that stood like a zombie behind him.\n\u201cI could hear you talking to Eri.\u201d He said simply, walking away from the hallway connecting everyone\u2019s room and toward the kitchen. Shota followed after him.\n\u201cSo, you know I have questions.\u201d He sat at the breakfast bar and watched Hitoshi fiddle with the coffee maker.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re also aware that I can\u2019t answer most of them.\u201d Hitoshi was far too similar in personality to himself. Both were blunt, always had a generally bored demeanor, but both fiercely protective of the ones that they loved. Shota knew that Midoriya and Hitoshi had a close friendship, with Midoriya being the first friend that Hitoshi made when he\u2019d been transferred to 1-A.\n\u201cWhy does he think I wouldn\u2019t let you and Eri spend the night?\u201d He asked first, watching Hitoshi grab two coffee cups from the cabinet.\n\u201cCan\u2019t answer that.\u201d He said simply.\n\u201cWhy has he never told me about the late night phone calls?\u201d\n\u201cEri asked him not to, but her therapist knows. Of course, her therapist can\u2019t tell you anything. But, \u2018Zu has never been bothered by them before, and from what I know, they are becoming less frequent.\u201d Shota felt slightly better knowing that at least some adult knew.\n\u201cYou knew about the calls?\u201d He questioned. Hitoshi hummed and began pouring coffee into each cup.\n\u201cI\u2019m the one that gave her his number.\u201d He told him honestly. Not offering an explanation as to why he also kept the secret. Though, Shota figured it was also because Eri had asked him not to tell.\n\u201cWhen I saw Midoriya tonight, he seemed VERY different. Any comments on that?\u201d He accepted the coffee that was handed to him and took a small drink.\n\u201cNope.\u201d Hitoshi made a move to sit next to him.\n\u201cI thought at first it was maybe his brother.\u201d Shota mused. Hitoshi snorted and smiled.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna die when he hears that. Not sure if it\u2019s gonna be from embarrassment or from laughter though.\u201d Shota rolled his eyes. Knowing the school version of Midoriya, his guess was embarrassment. \u201cNow I have a few questions for you.\u201d Hitoshi moved to look Shota in the eye more, and Shota saw a slight hint of distrust pointed at him. \u201cDid he see you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I saw it at the store, and followed him\u201d Shota felt no need to be dishonest.\n\u201cWhy did you follow him?\u201d\n\u201cHe was too different. It\u2019s very concerning to see someone you know be that different to his regular self.\u201d The slight distrust in Hitoshi\u2019s eyes grew and Shota felt like there was a lot that he didn\u2019t know. Why was his son being like this to him?\n\u201cAnd seeing him like however you did, what does that make you think about him now?\u201d He quickly noticed that Hitoshi didn\u2019t directly say specific changes, it made Shota think that maybe, there were even more changes that he didn\u2019t see.\n\u201cIt makes me think I need to have a long talk with him. Especially, if my children are going to be around him. I\u2019m not going to say that he\u2019s lying, but it seems that there are things that he isn\u2019t being honest about. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re showing such distrust right now, but however you\u2019re feeling is how I\u2019m feeling towards him. He was a completely different person. Plus, why was he out this late? Why was he going into a shady apartment and not his own? Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know he wore glasses. A lot of things aren\u2019t adding up, you have to understand that Hitoshi.\u201d He recognized that his voice was becoming slightly angry as he talked, but he felt justified in it. Especially, with the hostility coming off his son.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in his medical file.\u201d Hitoshi\u2019s hands were both around the cup of coffee, holding it tightly. His voice was short and quiet. \u201cHe\u2019s far sighted. Last year, when his costume changed to include his goggles, it wasn\u2019t because his walls create so much dust that he needed to shield his eyes. They are prescription. It\u2019s because he\u2019s far sighted. It\u2019s not super bad, but the more tired he gets, the more he has to wear them. It\u2019s in his medical file. It\u2019s also on his support item list. It says, prescription goggles.\u201d There was a low tone to Hitoshi\u2019s voice. It was almost accusatory. Shota sat back for a moment, trying to think about when Midoriya\u2019s hero suit had changed, or when he signed the change request. He honestly couldn\u2019t remember, but even that seemed like a small answer to a much larger problem.\n\u201cOkay. That doesn\u2019t justify everything else. What about the tattoos? Any of those in his medical file too? What about the change in personality? The late night calls with Eri? Telling her that I wouldn\u2019t like if she asked me if you guys could go over? How am I supposed to put trust in someone who not only do I not know, but also who is putting words into my mouth and thoughts into my daughters head?\u201d He was being snappy, he knew. He couldn\u2019t make himself care. Hitoshi\u2019s eyes snapped to his and he saw anger. It was the kind of anger he hadn\u2019t seen directed at him before. It was the kind of anger he\u2019d only seen directed at villains. Shota couldn\u2019t stop the hurt feeling that washed over him. Hitoshi\u2019s gaze slightly lessened. He turned away and quickly drank the rest of his coffee.\n\u201cDad. I love you. You will forever be the person who gave me a home, a family, love, kindness, who taught me to be a hero. I will never not love or be appreciative to you. But you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re wrong about Izuku, whatever you\u2019re thinking. You have saved so many people, but you failed him. At first, I thought maybe you didn\u2019t see all the signs, but then you picked them up with everyone else. You made your way through the A class and helped everyone you found. I waited for you to help him. I waited so freaking long. I thought, \u2018Of course he will, he has to see it.\u2019 But, you never did. So, I waited for All Might, because they are apparently so close, yeah right! So, instead, I started dropping hints, even when \u2018Zu asked me not to. Then I left a message to the counselor. Then I just straight up told All Might that he wasn\u2019t okay, because I know if it had to be an adult, that All Might was the closest person he\u2019d trust at the time. Still, NOTHING. The whole time, HE consoled ME about it, said how it was okay. How people should be focusing on REAL problems. So, the first time Eri called him crying about her nightmare, he came over, so she could see that he was okay, and wasn\u2019t hurt. He did it because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought that she would feel like him. She asked him not to tell you, but he immediately told her therapist. Then he called back after the next session and made sure that the therapist knew again. Then he asked Eri if they\u2019d talked about it. Because he MADE SURE that no one would do to her like they did to him. You are so good with everyone EXCEPT HIM and I DON\u2019T get it. You call him Problem Child anytime you talk to him, but you don\u2019t do that with anyone else. All Might would rather let him kill himself than step in. Of course, you\u2019ve never seen his tattoos, our uniforms all cover it, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s walking around shirtless everywhere. He put them there because he\u2019s professional. You\u2019ve never asked about his background. You never asked him about his life. Did you expect him to tell you every time he stubbed his toe when all adults around him ever do when he comes to them is ask what he did wrong?\u201d Hitoshi\u2019s long, angry loud rant finally petered out and Shota sat shocked, confused, guilty, and a slew of other emotions he wasn\u2019t quite able to distinguish. He didn\u2019t have a response to give Hitoshi, and maybe that was part of the problem. He couldn\u2019t even justify his previous actions, because he couldn\u2019t remember seeing any signs that warranted Midoriya needing help. But, the angry tears now streaming down Hitoshi\u2019s face pushed him off his chair to embrace his son. Hitoshi cried and brought his fist clenched hands to his own face as Shota embraced him. He peaked in the hallways and saw a confused Hizashi with a teary eyed Eri gripping the bottom of his shirt.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it better.\u201d Shota told him. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what that would entail, but his son was hurting and he had to try. Hitoshi shook his head.\n\u201cSometimes, there is too much damage for something to be mended. Sometimes the heroes don\u2019t save everyone.\u201d He backed away and glanced to Eri, opening his arms to her. She ran into his arms and hugged him. Shota stood helpless and shocked. Eri did her best to wipe away Hitoshi\u2019s tears.\n\u201cTomorrow, \u2018Zuku said we\u2019re gonna go for ice cream and that we were gonna bribe you by going to the cat caf\u00e9. So, don\u2019t be sad. If you call, I know he\u2019ll tell you that he loves you and not to cry.\u201d She hugged him tightly, her feet still off the ground while clutched in his arms. He nodded to her. Shota made eye contact with Hizashi who was looking more and more distressed by the minute. Both of their eyes widened when they heard the word, \u2018love\u2019. Was there even more that they hadn\u2019t noticed?\nEri moved one of her hands down to her pocket and pulled out her small phone. Pressing it to her ear while Hitoshi still cradled her.\n\u201cHi again \u2018Zuku.\u201d She said calmly. Hitoshi looked up at her, finally noticing her actions and seemed to have a small glint of hope in his eyes. Both children clearly forgetting Shota and Hizashi still standing there. Hizashi made his way over to Shota, moving around the kids. Shota grabbed his hand like a life line. \u201cNo, not another nightmare. Yeah, Dad is home now. Hitoshi is upset and I think he needs \u2018Zuku magic.\u201d Hitoshi sniffed his nose trying to clear the tears and set Eri down, taking the phone from her.\n\u201cI feel like I should be offended that you answer my sister\u2019s calls in the middle of the night but I\u2019ve gone to voicemail In the middle of the day before.\u201d Shota knew he was trying to be joking and lighten his own mood, but the tears that still escaped made it difficult.\nHizashi looked from the kids to Shota.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked him. This seemed to break the spell that the kids were under and they both looked at their parents.\n\u201cSorry, no, I\u2019m okay. It\u2019s a long story. I think-\u201c He paused and looked at each of his parents before sighing. \u201c-I think you should come over.\u201d Hizashi looked at Shota who nodded. He didn\u2019t think anyone was going to be able to sleep any longer tonight anyway. Hitoshi moved the phone from his face and suddenly Midoriya\u2019s voice filled the room.\n\u201cRight now? What\u2019s happening over there? Eri said Aizawa was home now. Is he okay? Is he hurt? Do you need me to bring anything? Where is Mic? Is he okay? You and Eri said that you were okay, but are you sure? Toshi, what is HAPPENING over there? I\u2019m freaking out right now.\u201d His worried and stressed voice made Shota feel worse than he did before. From what he gathered from Hitoshi earlier, Shota and all the other teachers had somehow failed Midoriya in some way and yet he was still fretting over their well-being.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine, Midoriya.\u201d Shota answered for Hitoshi. Silence filled the other line.\n\u201cSensei?\u201d The voice resembled more of the small reserved voice that he was used to.\n\u201cYes. You\u2019re on speaker. We\u2019re all here, all safe. If you want to come over and your mother allows it, then you may.\u201d Shota realized that he must have said something wrong when both Eri and Hitoshi looked at him quickly with panic. The other side of the line was met was silent for a moment.\n\u201cPlease come over \u2018Zuku, I want to go to the kitty caf\u00e9 for breakfast!\u201d Eri told him, her voice was reassuring. Hitoshi looked upset again. Shota looked at Hizashi, once again lost. Hizashi seemed to be in the same and equally confused state.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you need me to bring anything?\u201d Midoriya answered after a few moments longer of silence. Both Eri and Hitoshi seemed to breathe a little easier.\n\u201cBring your, \u2018It\u2019s been an emotional day\u2019 kit.\u201d Hitoshi told him, sparing a single glance at his parents again. There was nervous laughter that spilled out of the phone. Eri was slightly nodding.\n\u201cIs it for you\u2026 or will I need it?\u201d They could all hear sounds indicating that Midoriya was moving around.\n\u201cYou, me, Eri, I think Dad and Pops too.\u201d Hitoshi moved to sit on the couch, Eri following behind him. He leaned his head on the back of the couch and closed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk about you. I spilled the beans that every adult you\u2019ve ever met has failed you. Dad saw you at the store tonight and followed you home. Eri spilled the beans about you understand being hurt and about her late night calls. I spilled about your previous late night visits. Oh, I\u2019m also pretty sure Eri also outted us, and pop\u2019s is just, along for the ride at this point.\u201d A large sigh was heard, followed by more silence. Eri seemed to take a second to process and then her face morphed into terror.\n\u201cI\u2019M SO SORRY!\u201d She shrieked into the phone. Hitoshi, the closest to her, winced.\n\u201cShota? What\u2019s all this about? You followed Midoriya home?\u201d Hizashi whispered to him, concerned.\n\u201cFor 3:30 in the morning, you guys seemed to have accomplished a lot of things.\u201d Midoriya finally answered. The sarcasm in his voice held a slightly light tone. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I should have had better situational awareness, I honestly wasn\u2019t paying attention. Eri, it\u2019s okay. The calls, the visits, the outing, it\u2019s all okay. You don\u2019t have to worry about that stuff. You don\u2019t have to keep those things a secret either. Just like Mindy says, even the strongest heroes get nightmares and need help. Letting people know about this isn\u2019t going to change their opinion of you. Hitoshi, is that what has you upset? You know you don\u2019t have to worry about that, especially not this late at night. Everything is okay now. I\u2019m okay, you\u2019re okay, we\u2019re okay. I\u2019m on my way now though. I\u2019ll be there in 15 minutes. Okay?\u201d His tone was light and kind and Shota could see both of his children visibly relax at the voice and reassurance.\n\u201cShould we be concerned that Midoriya is on a first name bases with Eri\u2019s therapist?\u201d Hizashi whispered again and Shota gave a sort of shrug indicating that he had no idea anymore.\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be here. Wait, did you get the good stuff?\u201d Hitoshi smiled a wicked smile.\n\u201cPsh, duh. I thought Aizawa would like some too and figured Mic and Eri would have the hot chocolate.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s small laugh made Hitoshi smile at Shota with a mimic of his own devious smile, while Eri clapped and ran to the kitchen pulling out 5 cups. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m leaving now. I\u2019ll see you in a few.\u201d With that, the phone line clicked.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s, \u2018the good stuff\u2019?\u201d Hizashi asked, feeling like that was the only question that was safe at the moment.\n\u201cCoffee.\u201d Hitoshi answered simply, making his way into the kitchen, to dump and clean the current pot that was there.\n\u201cOh. Why didn\u2019t he think I\u2019d want coffee too?\u201d Hizashi pondered, slightly to himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called, \u2018Devil Mountain\u2019. It has more caffeine than any other cup in the world. It\u2019s technically considered deadly.\u201d Hitoshi answered his pondering while he scrubbed the coffee pot in the sink. Shota was immediately intrigued.\n\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ll just do the hot chocolate then.\u201d Hizashi confirmed laughing lightly.\nEri opened the fridge and then turned to look curiously at Shota.\n\u201cDid you get milk at the store?\u201d She asked. Shota\u2019s shoulders dropped and he suddenly remembered the forgotten cart at the store.\nHitoshi looked up and pulled out his own phone, pressing it to his ear.\n\u201cYeah, sorry, can you grab milk from the convenience store on the way here?\u201d He looked up to Hizashi and Shota. \u201cDo you guys need anything else?\u201d Both of them shook their head. Shota felt a slight bit of embarrassment burn in his chest. \u201cNo, that\u2019s all. Okay, thanks, bye.\u201d He hung up the phone, turning to Eri. \u201cHe\u2019ll grab it.\u201d Then went back to rinsing the coffee pot. Eri gave a nod and sat at the breakfast bar in the seat Shota had previously occupied.\nAn awkward silence fell over the group.\n\u201cSo, you and Midoriya, huh?\u201d Hizashi asked, trying to break the silence. Hitoshi, now finished with the pot, nodded.\n\u201cYeah, since end of first year.\u201d He answered, shocking his parents that he\u2019d been in a relationship for a year and a half and they didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cIt was romantic! \u2018Zuku gave him flowers and chocolates.\u201d Eri told them happily. Smiling brightly. Hitoshi\u2019s cheeks pinked.\n\u201cQuiet. The chocolates were mostly for you, and you don\u2019t know what romance is, you're nine.\u201d Hitoshi teased and Eri stuck out her tongue at him. Shota suddenly realized that his children also had a life that he didn\u2019t know anything about. He fought hard against the feeling of wanting to cry.\n\u201cWas Eri there, when he asked you out?\u201d Hizashi, seemed reserved but happily interested in the story.\n\u201cYeah, I chaperoned! Plus, \u2018Zuku said that he needed my blessing to ask out Toshi.\u201d Her smile seemed to lift the tension in Hitoshi and Hizashi, and only furthered it in Shota. \u201cIt was during one of the times we went to the cat cafe we\u2019re going to tomorrow! We got there first and the worker directed us to this table that already had drinks and muffins waiting for us. Then \u2018Zuku got there and his arms were behind his back hiding the flowers and chocolate, but he said a bunch of nice things to Toshi and then right when he said, \u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d He gave and showed him the flowers and chocolates! Toshi was so shocked! All he could do was nod.\u201d Eri began laughing at the memory and Hitoshi\u2019s face became even more embarrassed, but a sappy smile filled his face.\n\u201cIdiot didn\u2019t even mumble during it.\u201d He said fondly. Hizashi looked ecstatic.\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S SO CUTE!\u201d He yelled and on reflex everyone covered their ears. \u201cOh, sorry! That\u2019s so cute!\u201d He said again, this time quieter.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dork. He could have just asked, he didn\u2019t need a big show.\u201d Shota could see how happy Hitoshi was in that moment and he wondered how many things that he had apparently been blind to see.\n\u201cWhat about other dates? What did you do for them?\u201d Hizashi asked him.\nThe next several minutes went by where Hitoshi and Eri told funny scenes or dates that they\u2019d gone on. Eri being a frequent companion. Shota recognized some of the trips and places that Hitoshi had asked if he could go to with Midoriya. The Zoo, the aquarium, dinners, skating rinks. He now realized that when Hitoshi asked, he never said it was with anyone other than Midoriya.\n\n'Can I go out with Midoriya to the Zoo Friday?'\n\n\n'Can I go with Midoriya to dinner Saturday?'\n\n\n'Can I stay at Midoriya's this weekend?'\n\nThough he wasn\u2019t explicitly saying they were dates, he also wasn\u2019t hiding it. The guilt and grief only continued to grow.\nFinally, a knock at the door brought the stories to a close. Eri ran to go open it.\n\u201c\u2019Zuku!\u201d She exclaimed from the door. A few seconds later, Midoriya walked into the kitchen, a duffel on one side, with a plastic bag from the convenience store, and carrying Eri in the other arm.\n\u201cUh, hey.\u201d He raised the bag with the milk in it and a type of awkward greeting that Shota wasn\u2019t used to. He was wearing his glasses still and the same grey sweat pants, but a hoodie was over top what Shota assumed was the same black cut off shirt. He set the duffel down on the chair and the plastic bag on the counter. With Eri still in his arms he walked over to Hitoshi, who was back to looking upset.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Hitoshi said simply and Midoriya shook his head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Come here.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s smile was bright and loving and a similar smile to what Shota was used to seeing in class. He tugged Hitoshi to his other side, Eri continuing to sit on his forearm and grip around his neck. Hitoshi leaned in and Shota was instantly reminded of how he himself would curl into Hizashi after a bad day. Making his body as small as possible, and being cuddled into the hug.\nHizashi started loudly making awing noises and the pair broke their hug, Midoriya even setting Eri down.\n\u201cAizawa Sensei, Mic Sensei.\u201d Midoriya greeted them both with an awkward head nod.\n\u201cYou can leave off the Sensei, Midoriya.\u201d Shota told him. Midoriya just nodded in understanding. An awkward moment of silence filled the room again.\n\u201cI brought the coffee.\u201d Midoriya said breaking the silence. He moved to his duffel, opening and pulling out a black bag that indeed was titled, \u2018Devil Mountain\u2019. Hitoshi smiled, taking the bag.\nThe next several minutes were spent in silence. Eri and Hizashi made hot chocolate while Hitoshi made coffee. Midoriya and Shota both stood behind the breakfast bar.\nMidoriya seemed to be rolling around a small square in his hand. Shota recognized it as a fidget cube. He wondered if that was the cause of the lack of nervous mumbles in his class. Suddenly, Midoriya stopped and started to pull off his hoodie.\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s kind of hot with this on.\u201d He announced to Shota\u2019s questioning eyes. Once off, Shota indeed recognized the black shirt as the one he\u2019d been previously wearing. His tattoos and scars now once again on display. He didn\u2019t seem to mind and neither Eri nor Hitoshi seemed shocked at the sight of them. Hizashi however gave a similar reaction to Shota\u2019s first look, his mouth hanging slightly open.\n\u201cYou have tattoos!\u201d He announced, like none of them had eyes. Midoriya took a second and then went slightly pink.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d never seem them, sorry for shocking you!\u201d It made Shota once again question if Midoriya had actually ever hid them, or if Hitoshi was right, and he\u2019d just never paid attention.\n\u201cThis one is my favorite!\u201d Eri said before pulling the back of his shirt and turning Deku around so that his shoulder was exposed. It showed a black and grey explosion with \u2018SMASH\u2019 written over it, done in an old comic book style. With the shirt pulled back, Shota could see more of the scars he\u2019d seen at the store. Said tattoo seemed to be covering a scar. From the looks of them, they looked like they\u2019d been caused by fire. Once again, neither Eri nor Hitoshi seemed to blink twice at them.\n\n'I know that he understands what it\u2019s like to be hurt'\n\nSuddenly, Shota felt very nauseous. Hizashi gave a short gasp before covering it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool.\u201d He finally said, but Shota could tell he was forcing the enthusiasm into his voice.\n\u201cA memorial to all the One for All users!\u201d Eri announced happily. Before quickly covering her mouth. Midoriya and Hitoshi both looked at her with wide eyes.\n\u201cThe One for All users?\u201d Hizashi asked, feeling confused at the reaction of the three kids.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Eri whispered out, her eyes filling with tears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, no harm done. You didn\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re totally okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Midoriya calmed her down, but something still wasn\u2019t adding up. Hitoshi went back to filling three mugs up with coffee, seemingly trying to ignore the situation all together.\n\u201cIs One for All like All for One?\u201d Shota asked, feeling that Hizashi wasn\u2019t going to be answered. Midoriya looked up from Eri, who still seemed down.\n\u201cNope. Totally different.\u201d He smiled and went back to telling Eri quietly that she was okay. Shota realized that he wasn\u2019t going to get a further explanation at this time.\n\u201cCoffee and hot chocolate is ready\u201d Hitoshi handed a mug to each person. Silence once again filled the room as they walked to the living room and sat around the coffee table.\nHizashi and Shota sat on the couch while Eri and the both boys sat on the floor around the coffee table, ignoring the third seat on the couch and other two chairs completely.\n\u201cSo, you two are dating. Eri and Hitoshi were telling us all about your dates before you got here.\u201d Hizashi finally broke the silence again. Shota couldn\u2019t be more glad for him in this moment. He didn\u2019t know how to start this conversation.\n\u201cYeah, we are.\u201d Midoriya said, taking a drink of his coffee. He offered no other explanation as he tucked himself into Hitoshi\u2019s side.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Shota asked. Midoriya met his eyes for a moment before looking away, exactly like in class. Shota was starting to think that the open person dancing down the store aisle was made up.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we had to.\u201d Midoriya answered simply. Shota and Hizashi both exchanged a glance at each other.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re his parents.\u201d Shota said, thinking that was a good enough reason for him to know.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Midoriya looked at both of them slightly tilting his head to the side, genuinely confused. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with either of you.\u201d Hizashi\u2019s mouth fell open once again. Shota tried to tell himself that Midoriya wasn\u2019t trying to have an attitude, but it was fairly difficult to not be upset.\n\u201cBut you told Eri! And got her permission!\u201d Hizashi tried again with what both of them believed to be good reasoning.\n\u201cShe was there when it happened. She comes with us to some of our dates, so of course I got her permission, I didn\u2019t want to do something that would make her uncomfortable. Plus, me going out with Toshi alone would take time away that he could be with her. Their relationship was still fairly new. I wanted her to know that she had control and say over the things that were happening in her life. Toshi doesn\u2019t miss family events because of our dates, nor would we ever do anything at school, so we couldn\u2019t make either of you uncomfortable. So, I didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with you.\u201d While Midoriya explained his reasoning, Hizashi started to sink back down into his seat. Midoriya looked to Hitoshi for conformation.\n\u201cNormal people tell others about that stuff.\u201d Hitoshi told him, patting his knee. Eri giggled beside them, obviously in on the joke. Midoriya nodded, seemingly collecting this new information.\n\u201cOh. I see, my mistake then. I apologize. I am dating your son, I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d Midoriya smiled at both of them. Shota began to realize why Iida and Midoriya got along so well.\n\u201cUh, yeah Little Listener, that\u2019s okay.\u201d Hizashi rubbed the back of his neck. Clearly confused on the whole situation.\nThey lapsed into another uncomfortable silence.\n\u201cThe coffee is good.\u201d Shota said motioning to his cup.\n\u201cYeah, I have to special order it. It\u2019s the strongest in the world.\u201d Midoriya said, unknowingly confirming Hitoshi\u2019s previous statement.\n\u201cWhy not just drink regular coffee?\u201d Hizashi asked him.\n\u201cOh, my metabolism is a lot faster than other peoples. When I activate my quirk, it speeds up even more. This has equates to about 6 cups of regular coffee. If I were to run from back to my apartment, I would burn the whole thing off.\u201d Midoriya explained to them both. \u201cPlus, Toshi seems to like it.\u201d With that, Hitoshi raised his cup agreeing silently.\n\u201cTo insomniacs around the world.\u201d\n\u201cHere Here!\u201d Midoriya giggled beside him, clinking their glasses together. Hitoshi smiled and Eri laughed.\n\u201cAre you an insomniac too, Midoriya?\u201d Shota asked him, breaking their happy bubble. Shota couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing him tired during class or up around the common area after curfew while they were at the dorms.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Midoriya simply replied, once again giving no further explanation.\n\u201cCan we go back to your metabolism? How much do you have to eat in a day?\u201d Hizashi ask leaning forward, clearly fascinated.\n\u201cRight now since we\u2019re on break, I\u2019m not doing my usual training schedule, so around 5000 calories. But during school and when I\u2019m training, usually around 15000-20000 calories.\u201d Hizashi\u2019s eyes got wide. Shota tried to wrack his brain to remember a time when Midoriya was eating aside from meals he ate with his classmates, which definitely didn\u2019t equal 20000 calories.\nHe was starting to see what Hitoshi meant when he said he was missing everything.\n\u201cThat\u2019s so much! How do you do it!?\u201d Hizashi\u2019s voice was beginning to get louder and Midoriya instantly leaned back away from the sound.\n\u201cI eat a similar nutrition bar to Fatgum and Momo. I eat one in between each class and after every meal. Usually, around 2000 calories come from food and then each bar is around 1500 calories.\u201d Shota was also starting to see that Midoriya was an honest person. Any question that needed an explanation, he gave one but if some didn\u2019t need one he never seemed to offer up extra information,. He was also starting to feel bad about having basically called him a liar to Hitoshi earlier.\n\u201cHow did you figure all this out?\u201d Shota question, hoping he\u2019d find out that it wasn\u2019t something he should have known.\n\u201cWhen I did my internship with Grand Torino. He was concerned how weak and faint I felt and how I was break my bones anytime I used my quirk.\u201d Shota knew had come back from a three day internship and suddenly he wasn\u2019t breaking his bones before, but he hadn\u2019t questioned it. Just figuring that he\u2019d gotten control.\n\u201cYou broke your bones, because you weren\u2019t eating enough?\u201d This was something he should have known.\n\u201cYeah! It was one of the main reasons. The quirk is also really powerful, so there definitely still could have been damage done, but since my metabolism is so fast anytime I use my quirk, my vitamins rapidly deplete, including my calcium. Basically, without getting enough nutrients, it\u2019s like hitting someone with osteoporosis with a truck. The bars I have are different than Momo and Fatgum because while they need the calories, they thrive more from an increase in lipids, while I mostly need carbs and vitamins.\u201d Midoriya seemed happy to talk about it, not seeing anything wrong with the fact that their negligence as teachers when he first came caused him so much pain.\n\u201cDoes Recovery Girl know?\u201d Shota questioned again. Midoriya nodded.\n\u201cYeah, after my internship, we ran a bunch of tests to figure out exactly how everything depleted.\u201d He confirmed another thing being in a file that the teachers could have seen.\n\u201cHey, are those new glasses?\u201d Hitoshi suddenly questioned. Staring at Midoriya face with confusion.\n\u201cOh! Yeah. I just got them yesterday. I had to call Mei to make to adjustment when we come back next term. Apparently, they got a little worse. Seems like they\u2019ll be a permanent feature on my face now.\u201d Midoriya took them off and showed them to Hitoshi, explaining everything.\n\u201cYou just got new glasses a few months ago, should they have changed that fast?\u201d Hitoshi sounded like a worried boyfriend, and if it were another situation, Shota would have thought that was cute.\n\u201cFor me, yeah. Apparently, the eyes are hard to recover from malnutrition, but also slow to show problems. The doctor thinking they are closer to what they\u2019ll be in the long run. He said they looked mostly healthy again. Years from now, I might have to have corrective surgery so that I don\u2019t lose permanent vision, but for now, we\u2019re okay.\u201d Midoriya brightly at Hitoshi and bumped his shoulder, showing him he was okay. Hitoshi nodded again.\n\u201cWait, you lost vision because you were using your quirk without eating enough?\u201d Hizashi sounded devastated. They should have picked up on it faster. In fact, they didn\u2019t pick up on it at all.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure I would have needed them when I was older anyway. My parents both had reading glasses.\" Midoriya\u2019s words didn\u2019t make Shota or Hizashi feel better.Shota glanced at Hitoshi whose face gave a clear, \u2018This is what I was talking about.\u2019 Nausea instantly came back and acid began to burn his throat.\n\u201cYou said, \u2018had\u2019 reading glasses, as in past tense.\u201d Shota said slowly. Fighting the urge to throw up and remembering the pointed looks he\u2019d gotten when mentioning Midoriya\u2019s mother.\n\u201cYeah, they both did.\u201d Midoriya seemed confused when answering.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know your mom died.\u201d Hitoshi said gently, putting his hand over Midoriya\u2019s.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Was all Midoriya responded with. Eri looked down as well, obviously the news wasn\u2019t news to her.\nShota looked at Hizashi, panicked, confused, upset, and Hizashi returned each emotion. Throwing another devastated look on top of it.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Shota finally managed after a few seconds.\n\u201cNear the end of first year.\u201d Midoriya said quietly. He closed in on himself even more. Eri got up and ran back to the kitchen grabbing Midoriya\u2019s duffel. She opened it and handing a white tiger stuffed animal to Midoriya, a large hoodie to Hitoshi, a pink blanket for herself, and handing over a larger green blanket to Hizashi and Shota. Hizashi took it, clearly confused. Hitoshi quickly pulled on the hoodie, putting his nose to it and inhaling. Midoriya latched onto the stuffed animal. Eri wrapped herself into blanket.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the, \u2018It\u2019s been an emotional day\u201d kit. Usually we have movies and pizza too.\u201d Eri explained. Both adults nodded and draped the blanket over themselves. Shota did have to admit, it was a very comforting blanket. It seemed to be weighted, but still breathed. He was going to have to ask where Midoriya got this. If he wasn\u2019t completely awake from the coffee and emotionally charged talk, he\u2019s sure he would have been out.\n\u201cWho do you live with? Why didn\u2019t you tell us? How?\u201d Hizashi\u2019s mind seemed to be reeling.\n\u201cI live by myself. I told All Might, I thought he\u2019d told the staff. It\u2019s why I was late coming back by three days from break. After that, I didn\u2019t really want to talk about it. I figured no one wanted to upset me. It was a car accident on her way to work.\u201d Midoriya leaned farther into Hitoshi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s late, but I\u2019m sorry for your lose.\u201d Shota\u2019s voice was small. \u201cWe weren\u2019t made aware of the situation. Have you been living by yourself since then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I got emancipated when I was 16. Thank you for your condolences; I have a lot of mixed emotions about the whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cWho did you live with until you got emancipated?\u201d Shota questioned again. Knowing that Midoriya didn\u2019t turn 16 until the middle of second year.\n\u201cMyself.\u201d His answer made both adults look down, upset with themselves, the staff, the world.\n\u201cHow did you get an apartment before you were emancipated without a guardian signature? How did you get money?\u201d It\u2019s like every answer just raised more questions for Shota.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. To either. My mom had a life insurance policy, so when I got emancipated I was able to access it. Which is how I have money now. Plus, I do odd jobs here and there. For the 6 months before that, anytime we\u2019d have a break from the dorms, I\u2019d either sneak back into the dorms, stay the night with a friend, or stay in the park or beach.\u201d Midoriya seemed to be uncomfortable, but still answered. He hugged the tiger tighter.\nShota had missed the signs. One of his first years was going through a great lose and was homeless, and he hadn\u2019t noticed.\nHitoshi was right. He\u2019d failed his student.\n\u201cDid All Might know?\u201d Hizashi asked softly. It was almost a whisper, something Shota hadn\u2019t heard him speak that quietly for years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. He never asked where I was going to live.\u201d Midoriya seemed to untangle from Hitoshi and started to stand up. \u201cCan I take a break?\u201d He asked them. They both nodded. \u201cCan I use the balcony?\u201d He asked again. Once again, they both nodded. Midoriya reached into the duffel and pulled out a small black case and quietly went out to the balcony. All four people inside watched him take out a cigarette and grip the railing as he smoked. Once again, neither of his kids seemed surprised.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he smoked.\u201d Hizashi said quietly.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s tried to quit a few times. But it never sticks.\u201d Hitoshi told them, watching as Midoriya seemed to be trying to relax. Hizashi looked at Shota, before untangling himself from under the blanket. Shota watched him walk to the small oyster table near the door and reach into one of the decorative urns, pulling out a packet of cigarettes before walking out. Midoriya turned out to look at him, but Hizashi just pulled a cigarette out and walked to the railing, not speaking. The action seemed to calm Midoriya down and they both stood, smoking in silence.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know pops smoked.\u201d Hitoshi said, staring out at the two of them.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s tried to quit a few times, but it never sticks.\u201d Shota said, echoing Hitoshi\u2019s answers. The other nodded silently, seeming to understand. Eri looked back from the window to Shota.\n\u201cIs that why \u2018Zuku smells like home?\u201d She asked innocently, but her question seemed to throw Shota for a loop. It made Shota feel like he had forgotten about one of his children, but he guessed in a way, he had. Midoriya seemed to be a part of his family, even without his knowledge.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He told her honestly. She yawned just as both men were walking back in. Midoriya sat back down and Eri crawled over putting her head in his lap. He immediately began combing his fingers through her hair, making her close her eyes instantly. It was another moment Shota wished he could see when there wasn\u2019t so much tension in the air.\n\u201cYou seem to have quite a number of scars, Midoriya.\u201d Shota tried to keep his tone empathetic. \u201cEri said, you also knew what it was like to be hurt.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s hand still in Eri\u2019s hair for a moment.\n\u201cYeah. Eri and I clearly have different situations, but yeah, when I was younger, I got hurt a lot.\u201d He spoke slowly, and seeming guarded.\n\u201cHow did you get hurt?\u201d Shota asked directly, hoping he wouldn\u2019t find a way to dodge the question. Midoriya looked to Hitoshi who nodded at him. Almost as if he was giving him permission or maybe to reassure him it was okay, at this point Shota didn\u2019t know anything.\n\u201cI got bullied a lot when I was younger. My dad didn\u2019t really like me that much and sometimes my mom would get mad. I apparently look a lot like my father.\u201d Again, his answer was soft and slow.\nAfter knowing Todoroki\u2019s story, he knew exactly how much a mother could do when a father\u2019s look alike was around.\n\u201cWhen did the bullying stop?\u201d Hizashi asked, speaking for the first time since coming back into the apartment.\n\u201cBeginning of first year.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind, showing us the scars?\u201d Shota wasn\u2019t sure why he asked, he honestly wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know. Midoriya thought for a few moments before nodding that he would show them. Eri sat up, eyes filled with concern. Both parents were aware how much she hated her own scars, they weren\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react to seeing her heroes.\nThough, Shota figured that she\u2019d already seen them at least once. Midoriya stood up and pulled off the black cut off. His the half sleeve stopped at his shoulder where a scar stared. It was a straight line two inches long, thin, and raised. Shota took off the blanket, walking slowly to Midoriya. He seemed nervous to be standing eye to eye with his teacher, but Shota tried to focus on the scars instead.\nHis ribs were tattooed with a quote about heroics, Shota didn\u2019t stop to read it, instead focusing on the on the red healed burn marks on his side and the small hand prints the look as though they were burned into the tops of this chest. Three lined scars, like the one on the top of his shoulder, were placed randomly on his torso. Shota turned his gently. His back was worse by far. Two long gashes, stretched him shoulder to hip. More line scars. A burn scar was on his lower back, opposite hip to gash marks. Another slightly larger hand print was on the back of his ribs. A multitude of thin ovals burn scar were on the back of both biceps, only barely noticeable through the tattoo covering one of the biceps. Shota knew they were probably finger prints.\n\u201cIs this all of them?\u201d Shota ask quietly. Midoriya still turned away from him, shook his head. \u201cCan you show me the rest?\u201d Midoriya turned to look at Eri. She seemed to understand and she got up.\n\u201cCall me back in when you\u2019re done, okay?\u201d She gripped his hand and he nodded to her. Shota saw her walk towards the hallway. Once she was out of sight, Midoriya slowly step out of his grey sweatpants. Leaving him only in a pair of briefs. He turned back around, folding his arms over his chest. Clearly uncomfortable with being almost naked. Shota saw more lined scars on his thighs. One thigh had another tattoo, covering a scar that Shota couldn\u2019t make out, though he realized it was probably the point of the tattooes. Once again Shota turned him back around slowly. Seeing two more hand prints around his ankles, the hands were small, but he thought they looked smaller than the rest. Several more gash scars went over the back of his thighs.\n\u201cYou can put your pants back on.\u201d Shota told him. The room the deathly quiet. Midoriya put his pants back on quickly. \u201cEri, you can come back.\u201d Eri quickly walked back out and hugged Midoriya. Her hand tracing one of the lined scars on his torso. He pet her head before stepping back, reaching for his shirt that Hitoshi had.\n\u201cHow did you get those?\u201d Shota asked him, sitting back on the couch, putting the green blanket back over himself, needed all the comfort he could get. Midoriya sat back down, hugging the tiger, while both Eri and Hitoshi seemingly leaned into him.\n\u201cThe larger burns are from my dad, the long scars are from my mom and dad, the smaller line scars are from my mom or kids at school, and the hand prints are from a kid at school.\u201d Hitoshi was scowling at the table, clearly upset for Midoriya. Eri closed her eyes and rest her head against Midoriya, he wrapped a protective arm around her and pulled her closed.\n\u201cWhere is your father now?\u201d Shota could tell Hizashi was angry and trying to hide it.\n\u201cPretty sure he\u2019s in jail in America. He walked out when I was 5 and went to America for, \u2018work\u2019. Turns out work was robbing banks and burning security guards.\u201d Shota and Hizashi both let a shocked sigh. This kid. He\u2019d been through so much. Too much.\n\u201cWhat about the bullies? They were punished, right?\u201d Hizashi almost sounded hopefully, like he was asking whatever God was above to let this kid get something.\n\u201cNo. No one really cared. I was just the quirkless kid. People could do whatever they wanted.\u201d There was a brokenness to his voice that Shota hadn\u2019t heard before.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, quirkless?\u201d Shota leaned forward, confused. He knew the kid had a quirk. He\u2019d seen it many times. Once again, Midoriya seemed to look to Hitoshi, who again nodded. He then looked to Eri who gave him a smile.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get my quirk until during the UA entrance exam when I was 14.\u201d Shota thought his mind was going to explode. Hizashi opened his mouth, but only an undistinguishable sound came out. Midoriya took that as a sign to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s called One for All. That\u2019s the actual name of my quirk. It\u2019s passed down from person to person. I\u2019m the 9th holder. I told you before that it wasn\u2019t like All for One, and while that\u2019s true, it\u2019s not the whole story. All for One had a quirkless brother who he gave a stock piling strength enhancing quirk to. His brother did actually have a quirk it turns out, the quirk was the ability to pass down a quirk to someone else. That\u2019s how One for All was born. It remembers quirk of the users who had it before. Technically, I have 7 quirks that fall under the umbrella into one, I\u2019ve just only unlocked three.\u201d Both adults sat on the couch stunned. Hizashi seemed to recover faster.\n\u201cWhy only 7, I thought you were the 9th?\u201d He asked. Midoriya nodded his head.\n\u201cThe previous user and I were both quirkless.\u201d\nShota thought back to the tattoo that Eri said was a tribute. It said, \u2018Smash\u2019. Just like-\n\u201cAll Might gave it to you.\u201d Shota didn\u2019t question. He knew. Hizashi looked from Midoriya to Shota and back again. Midoriya only nodded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. Please don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice was soft, but there was an urgency underneath it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the League always targets you.\u201d Shota\u2019s voice was nothing more than a whisper now. It\u2019s like all the pieces were making sense. They all fit together to form a much different picture of Midoriya than what Shota previously had.\nHe\u2019d missed all the signs. If only he\u2019d asked questions. Reached out. Anything. Of course, Midoriya was shy in front of adults, no adult seemed to have cared before. He was reserved with his peers, previously he\u2019d been bullied. He started trying to think about all his interactions with Midoriya since meeting him.\nHe remembered his first, when he told Midoriya that he didn\u2019t think he had it in him to be a hero because he had no control, when really, he\u2019d never had time to learn. He thought about Bakagou\u2019s violent reaction to him having a quirk. His brain stilled. Midoriya had hand prints, which looked like a child made them.\nHitoshi hated Bakagou.\nEri wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room as him.\nThey came from the same school.\nIn training simulations, Bakagou always went after him with such extreme force.\nFor what seemed him the millionth time, Shota felt nauseous. He\u2019d made them partners on so many occasions. He\u2019d ignored when Midoriya seemed like he didn\u2019t want to work with him. When Bakagou would go after him instead of their real target. When Bakagou broke Midoriya\u2019s nose during the first final first year.\nHe ignored all the signs.\nShota looked to Hitoshi again, catching his eyes. Hitoshi looked away, almost ashamed. Shota felt like he was breaking.\n\u201cHe was your bully. You aren\u2019t rivals at all.\u201d Shota spoke and his voice cracked. The tears that he\u2019d tried to hold back earlier filled his eyes. Midoriya seemed to understand his jump in his train of thought.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, he\u2019s better now. At least, he\u2019s better with other people, and he can work with me without trying to kill me anymore. He knows, about One for All. For a long time, he was the only one that knew. He knew I didn\u2019t have a quirk, and then after we fought at Ground Beta, All Might thought it was best to let him in on the secret.\u201d Midoriya told him. Hitoshi clenched his fists and Hizashi looked a little confused before sitting up straighter.\n\u201cBakagou? Bakagou is the one that made those hand prints?\u201d He was angry again. Shota wish that he wasn\u2019t devastated enough that he could feel angry again too.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve made peace with it. My therapist and I have talked at nausea about Katsuki and our relationship.\u201d Shota didn\u2019t know when Midoriya had stopped calling Bakagou by the nickname he had for him.\n\u201cYou see a therapist?\u201d Hizashi questioned. Midoriya nodded. Eri perked up.\n\u201cHe sees Mindy!\u201d She said smiling before laying her head back down in Midoriya\u2019s lap. Hizashi nodded his head, now understand why he was on a first name bases with the woman.\n\u201cI mean, do you blame me? I\u2019m a little messed up in the head.\u201d Midoriya laughed a little and Hitoshi bumped his shoulder and laughed a little too.\n\u201cNo no, I think it\u2019s a good thing. Not because I think you\u2019re messed up either. I just think it\u2019s good to talk about things with someone. You\u2019ve been though-\u201c Hizashi seemed to paused for a moment \u201c-a lot\u201d he finished. Midoriya laughed again.\n\u201cYeah, life has been hard. But it\u2019s really okay.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not okay. None of it is okay. You shouldn\u2019t have been seeing a therapist now. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait months for figure out your quirk. Teachers, adults, students, they should have picked up on the distress that was constantly around you. They should have helped. Someone should have acknowledged your moms passing, you shouldn\u2019t have had to share a giant secret with a person who left permanent marks all over you. I hate when you say it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s NOT okay. They should have noticed.\u201d Hitoshi leaned away from Midoriya, he glared at the table, and his tone filled with anger.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right. We should have noticed.\u201d Shota\u2019s eyes went from Hitoshi to Midoriya. \u201cWe should have noticed and we didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry for failing you.\u201d Midoriya smiled softly and looked into his lap at Eri\u2019s head and the white tiger.\n\u201cYeah. Someone should have noticed and they didn\u2019t. I learned the first time I met All Might that heroes weren\u2019t what I thought they were and that they sometimes do the wrong thing. The first thing he ever did was save me, then tell me that someone whose quirkless couldn\u2019t be a hero, which is something else after you learn that he\u2019s quirkless too. Then I tried to save my bully and suddenly I was worthy to be a hero. So many bad things happened to me at UA. I\u2019ve fought too many people. I\u2019ve given it my all and mostly all I hear is that I didn\u2019t do it right, I gave too much, or I didn\u2019t give enough. Mindy has made me realize a lot of things about my life and the people in it. Even about All Might, who is an amazing hero and mentor, and someone I care deeply about, but he\u2019s also self-centered, emotionally manipulative, and boarding on emotionally abusive. Someone should have saved me, especially since I go to school with literal heroes, but no one did. So, I saved myself. I\u2019m 17, I\u2019m about to graduate and have my hero license, I already have offers from agencies to be a sidekick, legally, I\u2019m an adult, and I have my own place. Yeah, it\u2019s in a crappy neighborhood, but I knew it was okay, because it\u2019s in Eraserhead\u2019s patrol area and I know that you\u2019re a good hero. You both are. I know you\u2019re good with your kids and with all the other students. I have a great boyfriend and Eri who is little a little sister to me. I have friends. I\u2019m not always in a great mood and some days are really hard. I don\u2019t sleep a ton because of nightmares or stress, but I\u2019m getting better. I\u2019m living life. So, it\u2019s okay. People slip through the cracks sometimes. The system isn\u2019t perfect.\u201d Midoriya help a small smile the whole time he spoke. His tone was never callas or malicious. He spoke in facts and didn\u2019t hold anything back. Shota wasn\u2019t sure when he started crying or when Hizashi started crying either. \u201cI think we all need another break.\u201d Eri picked herself off of Midoriya\u2019s lap slowly. Her eyes were on the ground, lost in thought. Hitoshi still glared at the table. Midoriya leaned over and kissed the side of Hitoshi\u2019s head before standing and walking outside lighting another cigarette.\n\u201cDad, Papa, can I ask you a question?\u201d Eri\u2019s voice was small and she didn\u2019t look up from the spot on the ground or wait for either of them answer before continuing. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone notice?\u201d Her question was innocent. She was both too young to understand the world and yet she\u2019d already had too many things happen to her, making her understand far too much of it. Shota leaned forward and cried into his hands, unable to answer. Hizashi stood up and again walked outside with Midoriya. Again, neither saying a word. Glancing up, Shota could see how Hizashi cried and how his hands shook while he smoked.\n\u201cSometimes heroes don\u2019t save everyone.\u201d Hitoshi answered for Shota. Eri wrapped herself in the pink blanket more. The room was silent other than the muffled cries of Shota and the soft breathing of both his kids."
