    "text": "\ngeorgenotfound: im starting at my new high school today\n\n\nHe stared at his phone for a moment, before dropping his hand by the side. He didn\u2019t expect his best friend to be awake yet; it was barely six thirty AM where he lived. George glanced at the alarm clock next to his bed, which read the same time.\u00a0\n\n\nEven after three weeks in Florida, George\u2019s jetlag hadn\u2019t fully left. He kept falling asleep at odd times during the day, and thus sleeping far too late into the evening. Although it had mostly evened out, his increasingly tense anxiety had haunted him all week, making him wake up earlier than usual.\u00a0\n\n\nHe checked his phone again, hoping for a reply, but the red dot next to his friend\u2019s name signaled that he hadn\u2019t been online in nearly eight hours. Definitely still asleep, then.\n\n\nSleepily, George dragged himself out of bed and to the bathroom. He glanced in the mirror and grimaced-- his hair was fluffed up in a tousled mess on one side, and stuck too flat to the other. Just what he wanted, a bad hair day to start off the school year. He tried to tug a comb through it and gave up halfway through-- he might just straighten it and be done with that.\n\n\nHis phone buzzed suddenly, left behind on his bed. George eagerly crossed the room to snatch it up.\u00a0\n\n\nDream had replied.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: you nervous?\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: a little tbh. i don\u2019t know anyone so :/\n\n\ndreamwastaken: im sure its going to go well!! someone there is bound to be your friend\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i hope\n\n\ndreamwastaken: if i was there i would be your friend &lt;3\n\n\nGeorge stared down at the last emoticon and pressed his hand to his face to try and stop his silly blushing. It was just two little squares of text. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u00a0\n\n\nHe and Dream had been friends for nearly five years, ever since George had randomly joined a Discord chat with him in it. They had hit it off almost immediately, and soon began private messaging after that. Slowly, they both opened up to each other slightly; Dream was hesitant to share details of his private life, and so was George. But Dream had talked George through nearly every big event in his life: from awkward middle school crushes, to editing term papers due in half an hour, to his parents\u2019 messy divorce halfway through secondary school. Now, he supposed, it was Dream\u2019s turn to help him through starting at a new school.\u00a0\n\n\nHe took a quick glance at the time; his school started in exactly forty-five minutes. Enough time to fix his bad hair and eat a quick breakfast. The school was about a ten minute drive with no traffic, and George hardly wanted to be late on his first day. He still needed to pick up his schedule from the administrator\u2019s office and sort out textbooks and locate all his classrooms and\u2026\n\n\nGeorge swallowed hard and left his room. His mother was already in the tiny kitchen; there was a kettle set to boil and a box of cereal out on the counter. She knew about George\u2019s disappointment of moving to America; when he found out about the move due to her new job, he had been quite angry with her.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge was quick to go talk to Dream, but only briefly mentioned the details of the situation. He didn\u2019t know where Dream lived, and Dream didn\u2019t know where George lived. So George had only told him that he was being forced to move to a new school, and that he was feeling awfully about it. Dream had done his best to listen and support George as he talked, and slowly, most of George\u2019s anger leached away. His mother was doing his best to make their new home positive, and George had grown to appreciate that endlessly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFirst day!\u201d His mother cheered. She ruffled George\u2019s hair with one hand, and set down a milk jug with the other. \u201cAre you excited?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge fought down the same spike of anxiety that happened every time he thought about starting at a new school. Everything he knew about American schools was based off films and television, and they were all needlessly dramatic and over the top. He wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.\u00a0\n\n\nVaguely, he missed his friends back in Brighton. Back there, he had a niche group of people who were all interested in the same things as he was. Their group had formed as mostly a group of outcasts\u2014 as many groups did, at first\u2014 but eventually got to know each other.\n\n\nThey had promised to keep in touch with George as he left, but neither George nor them really understood the effort it took to keep up that many online friendships. They had worked better in person anyway, and slowly, they drew apart. For the last few weeks, the only person George had been actively talking to was Dream.\u00a0\n\n\nIt tended to go like that quite often.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t entirely true, but his mother took it as such. \u201cYou\u2019ll drive me there?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge gave her a thumbs-up. He checked his phone again under the table and sent a message back:\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: still nervous.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: don\u2019t stress. it\u2019ll go great. plus i\u2019ll be here if you need to talk!\n\n\nHis mother looked over at him and tsked. \u201cNo phones at the table, please.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge gave her his best innocent look and texted Dream again:\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: my mum keeps bugging me to put my phone away at the table\n\n\ndreamwastaken: breaking the rules.. wow\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: you know me :)\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d his mother repeated, sounding a tad more irritated. \u201cWhat did I just say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d George said, not sorry at all, and shoveled a few more spoonfuls of cereal down. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave in five minutes?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShe nodded. George went to go rinse out his cereal bowl and dropped it in the sink. His backpack had been sitting in his closet, primed and ready, for the last few days. It was the type of thing that made his nervousness a little easier, having things prepared. Now, he slung it onto his back and looked into the mirror.\n\n\nA tuft of his hair stood up, and George flattened it down. Within a few seconds, it sprung up again. George sighed and gave up on it. He resolved himself to an awkward rest of the day.\u00a0\n\n\nHis mother dropped him off at the administrator\u2019s office fifteen minutes later, and George stepped out into the Florida sun. Even though it was barely seven AM, the air was already thick and humid with heat. George felt as though he was breathing in steam. How did anyone deal with it?\u00a0\n\n\nHe checked his phone again for the time and saw that he had about fifteen minutes before the first bell rang. Briefly, George cursed the fact that schools in America started so early. He could already tell that the early start was going to make his mornings hell.\u00a0\n\n\nTentatively, George introduced himself to the secretary at the front desk as George (the new kid), and then patiently waited as she sorted through file cabinets to find his schedule and a school map. She laid both on the desk in front of herself and briefly pointed out the various wings. George was slightly shocked at how big it was; in Brighton, less than five hundred students went to his school. Here at Lakeside High School, right on the outskirts of Orlando, there were over a thousand students.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll start off in American History, in room C103, and then you\u2019ll have physics in room A207,\u201d the receptionist explained. \u201cYou can ask another student for help if you need it, I\u2019m sure everyone at Lakeside will be happy to help you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George echoed. He couldn\u2019t imagine anyone being particularly thrilled to help out the dumb new kid. \u201cUh, where is the C Wing again?\u201d\n\n\nShe pointed down the hall to the outdoors. \u201cThe buildings that are painted orange. That\u2019s the history wing. You\u2019ll find that the school is easy to get around.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George repeated. He was colorblind, but he helpfully didn\u2019t mention that. Still, he took his schedule, folded it up, stuck it in his back pocket, and made his way towards the stretch of buildings that the receptionist had mentioned.\u00a0\n\n\nAmerican History, of course, was when the real trouble started.\n\n\nThere was no seating chart scrawled up on the board, instead the words \u201csit anywhere you please!\u201d George took advantage of this, being one of the first students to arrive, and placed himself firmly in the back of the room. His plan was to draw the least attention to himself, and the back right corner seemed like the best place to do that.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately, as the clock ticked closer to the start of the school day, the seats around him slowly filled with kids. George had awfully overestimated his ability to go unnoticed, because evidently everyone wanted a seat in the back. The newcomers were rowdy and loud, and they seemed to all know each other. George wanted to shrink into the corner and turn invisible. Of course, nothing ever went his way.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re new here, right?\u201d\n\n\nSome of the talking stopped, and attention turned to him. George busied himself with taking out his notebooks and pretended not to hear.\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the guy said, bracing an arm on the back of his chair to turn and look at him. \u201cAre you new here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said, already feeling uncomfortable with the amount of attention on him. He wished they would just leave him alone. \u201cI\u2019m George.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI love your accent,\u201d someone else said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said, feeling more uncomfortable. He felt his face go hot and stared at his desk. There went his chances of making it through the day without having to interact with anyone.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you from Britain?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d George said. He wished the bell would ring. \u201cI just moved.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you move? Was it weird? How long was the flight? Are you\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, shut it, Skeppy,\u201d someone else said, and neatly butted into their conversation. \u201cPlease ignore my friend, he\u2019s an asshole. Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Sapnap.\u201d\n\n\nThe friend smacked Sapnap\u2019s arm in mock annoyance. Sapnap pushed him back playfully before holding out his hand. George stared at it for a moment, before slowly reaching out and shaking it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a weird name,\u201d George said.\u00a0\n\n\nFor a second Sapnap stared at him, and George abruptly realized that you shouldn\u2019t say that to strangers, but then Sapnap grinned toothily.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know, right? It\u2019s okay, though. At least it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said. Sapnap didn\u2019t seem too bothered by George\u2019s comment. He was certainly interesting-- his level of energy for this early in the morning was astronomical. Thankfully, he had also seemingly caught onto George\u2019s hesitation, and leaned back from him. The rest of Sapnap\u2019s friends had mostly left George alone, and went back to talking among each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf you are new here, you\u2019ll need a guide.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge gave him a skeptical look, but nodded slowly. Sapnap, apparently, took that as an \u2018enthusiastic yes\u201d and began explaining the intricacies of Lakeside High School to George. He had gotten halfway through his elaborate description of the teachers George should and should not interact with (Mrs. Rovai, she teaches Honors Spanish 3, if you have her then good luck\u2014) when the bell rang.\n\n\nTheir teacher entered; she had frizzy hair tied back, wore jeans and a chunky-knit sweater, and upon seeing Sapnap in the back corner, noticeably sighed. George\u2019s eyes flickered between Sapnap and the teacher, and he realized that he had just unwittingly made friends with one of the school troublemakers.\n\n\nOf course that was his luck.\n\n\nThe rest of his classes ran quite smoothly. A few more people tried to introduce themselves to him, but George shied away uncomfortably. The guy Sapnap had pushed away from him\u2014 Skeppy\u2014 was in George\u2019s physics class, and there were some other recognizable faces in English who had sat next to him in history. The only class he didn\u2019t have with anyone he recognized was pre calculus, his last class before lunch. One teacher asked George to introduce himself, which sent panic spiking through George\u2019s stomach as the entire class turned to look at him, but that feeling dissolved soon after.\n\n\nBefore he knew it, lunch arrived. George shouldered his backpack and realized that he didn\u2019t know where to go-- he had no friends, he barely knew anyone\u2019s names. Was it true that people ate lunch in the bathroom stalls? Did lunch tables actually split up into dramatically different cliques? What was he supposed to do if he couldn\u2019t find a place to sit?\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\nGeorge turned, and Sapnap was there. He caught George\u2019s elbow and steered him towards a table out in the open, by the grassy courtyard.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI figured you don\u2019t know anyone yet, so you can sit with us,\u201d Sapnap explained. \u201cYou looked a little lost, so I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014 okay,\u201d George stammered. He didn\u2019t really mind; he was grateful for Sapnap\u2019s cautious friendship, and it was nice to hopefully have a familiar face around.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll meet everyone in our group,\u201d Sapnap continued, taking no note of George\u2019s nervousness. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Skeppy, Bad, Ponk, Alyssa, and I think Clay should be there any second\u2014 we all sit together at lunch, so now you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking: \u201cJust like that?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sapnap said, like it was obvious. \u201cYou\u2019re new, and you seem nice, so why not be friends?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d George said, and ducked his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap shoulder-checked him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go sit down.\u201d\n\n\nOn their way, Sapnap explained that most people called the courtyard the Green, namely for the wide stretches of grass and overarching trees. The sun was high overhead, but most of the table Sapnap headed towards was nicely shaded. A girl shuffled aside to give George more room as he sat down.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re George, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t recognize whoever said it but nodded nonetheless. \n\n\n\u201cThe whole school is talking about you,\u201d someone else chimed in.\u00a0\n\n\nGreat. Just what he wanted. George scratched his ear uncomfortably.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe should probably introduce ourselves,\u201d someone else said, and there was a chorus of agreements. Name flickered by, and George attached them to people\u2019s faces; Skeppy, the same guy from his physics class; Alyssa, who had moved aside to let him sit; Ponk, who gave him a friendly hello; Bad, eagerly sitting forward; and Sapnap, who George had already met. They all seemed very bright and shiny and freshly minted\u2014 and they all seemed to know each other quite well, as if they had been friends for years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCuriously, he saw that no one had lunch, and no one was eating. He tentatively asked why.\n\n\n\u201cThe cafeteria food sucks,\u201d Alyssa interjected, \u201cSo none of us ever eat there. Are you a junior?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d George said. He hoped he was a junior, at least\u2014 he had been put into third year classes, and so he assumed that was the right year to be in.\n\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d someone cheered. \u201cWe can go off campus for lunches.\u201d\n\n\nUpon noticing George\u2019s confusion, Alyssa added, \u201cUpperclassmen can leave campus at lunch. And Bad just got his license, so he can drive us all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d someone else said\u2014 George assumed that he was Bad, since Alyssa had just mentioned him\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not technically supposed to drive people until I\u2019m eighteen, so\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one listens to that,\u201d Ponk said dryly. \u201cYou can drive us until I get my license next.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNuh uh,\u201d Skeppy said indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ll be next. I\u2019ve already got my permit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Alyssa said loftily. The table laughed. Skeppy rolled his eyes, but played along.\u00a0\n\n\nA teacher passed their table, and quickly, Sapnap pulled the white bandana off his head. George had noticed it before, back in history class\u2014 just a simple white band tied around his head. It made him look a little childish but also a little badass.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUniform violation, Sapnap,\u201d the teacher said pointedly, and gave him a warning glance. Sapnap gave him a classic troublemaker smile, and as soon as the teacher was out of eyesight, tied the bandana back on.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe Mr. Davis lets you get away with that,\u201d Ponk grumbled. \u201cYou two must be best friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Sapnap proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten detention yet. Mr. Davis is on my side.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt a little bit lost. There was so much happening and so many people were talking, faces and names and voices he didn\u2019t know. Vaguely, he wished that Dream was there-- Dream would likely be great in social situations, George just knew. And he would feel so much more comfortable if he had a best friend to talk with that he trusted.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d someone said, and the entire table rearranged so that the last person could sit. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge was shuffled to the side and saw the last person drop down. Instantly he could tell that this person was the \u201cleader\u201d of the group\u2014 George had a lot of experience with handling uncomfortable social situations, and as a result he had gotten quite good at analysing group dynamics. It was clear that everyone really liked whoever this new person was.\u00a0\n\n\nThe guy glanced around the table, and his gaze landed on George. He gave him a dismissive up and down. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d George said, feeling like he was under scrutiny again. \u201cI\u2019m George.\u201d\n\n\nThe guy\u2019s eyes flicked over him again, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m Clay.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThere was an odd tension in the air for a moment. George wasn\u2019t quite sure why.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in my math class,\u201d Clay said. \u201cNew kid, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge nodded. It was weird; Clay gave him a sense of deja vu, like he had already met him.\u00a0\n\n\nClay gave him another appraising look. \u201cSee you around.\u201d\n\n\nWithout another word, he turned and promptly joined Ponk and Alyssa\u2019s conversation, happening at the other end of the table. George stared curiously after him for a moment.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him,\u201d Bad said under his breath. \u201cHe\u2019s not great with new people.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d George said, \u201cMe either.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, then.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge gave Sapnap a reluctantly pleased smile, and joined the conversation. They were talking about some teacher or another, and even if he couldn\u2019t contribute anything, he still listened. The group made future plans about where they were going to eat next, and debated whether to go to Mexican place down the street or just get burgers and shakes, and graciously included George in their discussion. Before he knew it, the warning bell rang, signaling that they had five minutes to get to their next class.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your next class?\u201d Clay asked.\n\n\n\u201cI have computer science,\u201d George said. He didn\u2019t know why he suddenly felt so flustered. Clay was just another person; George didn\u2019t feel like this whenever he talked with Sapnap, or Skeppy, or anyone else in the group.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d Clay slung his backpack over his shoulder. \u201cHave fun.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge gave him a thumbs up and then instantly regretted it; that was such an awkward, clumsy thing to do. He turned to leave; he wasn\u2019t sure how far the classroom was (it was in the D Wing, and George had no clue where that was).\u00a0\n\n\nAlmost out of earshot, he heard Sapnap mutter to Clay: \u201cLeave him alone, he\u2019s new.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClay\u2019s response was inaudible, but an odd feeling surfaced in George\u2019s chest. He couldn\u2019t place a name to the emotion, and decided to ignore it. He had two more hours in the school day, and then he could go home and relax. George was an introvert; he wasn\u2019t built for this much social interaction.\n\n\nThe last two classes passed in a breeze; computer science trickled by, and George\u2019s last class was Spanish (he had already taken two years of it in Brighton, but still had to take one more to graduate). Before he knew it, the day was over.\n\n\nExcept Sapnap cornered him after class, struck up a conversation, and before George knew it, nearly forty five minutes had passed. Even though George was still awkwardly quiet and still, Sapnap had no problem filling the silence and bouncing off of George\u2019s short responses. Their conversation flowed so easily that George couldn\u2019t believe he had only met him a few hours before. They listened to the same music and watched the same TV shows. They were even interested in the same content creators online, and Sapnap played Minecraft too.\u00a0\n\n\nOn his walk home, George replayed the events of the day in his head. He felt quite proud of himself, if he was being honest\u2014 things had gone much better than he expected. He had made friends, and even if they were the apparent troublemakers of campus, they seemed to like him.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge pulled out his phone, and to his delight, saw that Dream had texted him almost an hour ago. Quickly, he scrolled through his texts:\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: hello!!\n\n\ndreamwastaken: have you finished classes yet\n\n\ndreamwastaken: omg tell me how everything went\n\n\nGeorge grinned down at his phone fondly. It wasn\u2019t often that Dream triple texted him, and it was usually whenever Dream was excited about something beyond measure. Already, he felt better about his day.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: it honestly wasn\u2019t that bad. i made friends with a few people\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yay i knew u would\n\n\ndreamwastaken: don\u2019t replace me tho\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: of course not you\u2019ll always be my best friend\n\n\ndreamwastaken: :)) &lt;3\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: &lt;33\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: anyway my classes aren't that interesting. i'm in pre calculus and i don't understand anything\n\n\ndreamwastaken: precalc sucks. i\u2019m rooting for you\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: aren\u2019t you some sort of math whiz?\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i\u2019m only good at math though. put me in a history class and i\u2019ll forget everything\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: mood, i\u2019m in american history and i have no clue what\u2019s going on\n\n\ndreamwastaken: all u really need to know is that america wins wars, there\u2019s nothing else to it\n\n\nGeorge snorted. The lump behind his began to dissolve, dislodging all of the stress from earlier that day. Dream always made him feel like this: happy, relaxed, and content. No matter how things at school went, or how many friends he had tentatively made there, he would always have Dream. That was enough for him.\n\n\nFor the past four days, George had been slowly making friends with everyone who sat at the lunch table. It had gone spectacularly well, to the point where George was convinced that all the films and television shows were lying about the intensity of American high schools. Of course there were some obvious cliques\u2014 some were emo, some were jocks, and some more were preps\u2014 but overall, everyone had been very kind. There was no bullying and no social hierarchy. Classes hadn\u2019t started picking up in pace yet (but George worried that the weekend would change things), and so far it was mostly icebreakers and introductory lectures. The first week had gone so well that, astonishingly, George had begun looking forward to school.\u00a0\n\n\nThe one thing he didn\u2019t look forward to was the weather.\n\n\nFlorida was bitterly humid, and rainstorms seemed to come out of nowhere. No one had umbrellas, and when George asked about it, the entire group laughed. Apparently umbrellas weren\u2019t a thing in Florida\u2014 if anyone used one, they were relentlessly teased. Clay had laughed when George pulled his hood up to keep dry, and George flushed pink.\u00a0\n\n\nIn response, George told them about how cold Brighton could get and how it snowed in the winter. Last year, it had snowed so much that George and his friends had had a mock snowball fight. Logically, it wasn\u2019t much snow\u2014 the dustings were barely two inches, and usually melted within the week\u2014 but no one had experienced snow before, and they ate his stories up with wide eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that winters are below freezing,\u201d Bad argued, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been below fifty degrees here.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge was quickly learning the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit. He\u2019d looked at his phone one morning, seen seventy degrees on the weather update, and nearly fainted. Seventy degrees in Celsius wasn\u2019t even a fathomable temperature. Seventy degrees Fahrenheit, comparatively, was a cool summer day.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cHow have you guys never seen snow before?\u201d George asked in disbelief.\n\n\n\u201cHow have you never seen a hurricane before?\u201d challenged Clay.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d George muttered, and Clay laughed.\n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t know why he liked making Clay laugh. It made a strange feeling of pride swell in his stomach. Which was odd, because making someone laugh wasn\u2019t a competition.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky hurricane season was light this year,\u201d Ponk interjected. \u201cOrlando doesn\u2019t get hit that bad, but we still get plenty of storms.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI hate your storms,\u201d George said. \u201cRain shouldn\u2019t be warm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCold rain,\u201d Bad said, shuddering. \u201cIcky.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge gave up on them; in Florida, stepping outside during a rainstorm felt the same as taking a lukewarm shower. It was just what they were used to.\n\n\nApart from their constant friendly bickering, George actually felt happy talking with everyone. He still wasn\u2019t sure why they had accepted him so wholeheartedly into their group, with open arms. It was kind of them, and George appreciated it more than he could possibly say. When he had asked Sapnap about it on the first day, Sapnap had just waved it off. Still, George resolved to say thank you at some point. It had made the transition from Britain to Florida so much easier.\u00a0\n\n\nFriday afternoon arrived in a flash. George headed to their usual lunch spot after precalculus\u2014 Clay was also in his fourth period math class\u2014 but Clay was the type of person to stay after class and talk with the teacher for a few minutes. More than once, George had heard a teacher compliment Clay on his \u201cwork ethic\u201d and wonder why he hung out with such \u201crowdy\u201d friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey, George,\u201d Bad said, and beckoned him over. \u201cWe\u2019re debating where to eat today. Pizza or Mexican?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPizza,\u201d George said automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou and Clay are going to get along great,\u201d Ponk said offhandedly. \u201cHe always chooses pizza.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of Clay,\u201d Sapnap said, looking around, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was talking to the teacher when I left,\u201d George offered. \u201cSo any second?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Clay said, neatly sliding in. \u201cWhere are we eating? Domino\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs always,\u201d Bad said, \u201cGeorge voted for pizza too, he\u2019s your new best friend.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d Clay said sarcastically. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a lot more than that.\u201d\n\n\nOuch.\u00a0\n\n\nThat probably wasn\u2019t meant to be rude, probably meant as a lighthearted jab at how new George was to Lakeside High, but it still stung slightly. George was already uncomfortable with how quickly they had accepted him in\u2014 he worried that if he messed up in any way, they would drop him just as easily.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Brighton, most of his friends had been similar outcasts, and that was why they had bonded together. He had talked to Dream so much more then, because he was the one person who really, really cared about him. Here, it seemed like this friend group could have their pick of friends; everyone seemed to admire them. Yet they had somehow picked George, and taken him under their wing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre we ready to go?\u201d Bad asked. George jolted himself out of his thoughts. No one seemed to take anything seriously. Clay probably meant no harm by saying that. Dream probably would have laughed at it, too.\n\n\nEveryone nodded in agreement, and they swarmed as one toward the student parking lot. It was open only to the upperclassmen\u2014 which made sense, as you had to be seventeen in order to get your license. Bad fumbled for his car keys and unlocked a dark minivan. It wasn\u2019t his, but his father\u2019s, and Bad made everyone promise to leave it without a single scratch. It was big enough to fit everyone, if three people squeezed in the backseat. Luckily Alyssa was a good sport about taking the middle seat, and most of the fast food places were less than a five minute drive from campus regardless.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge settled into the middle row, across from Skeppy and directly behind Bad. He leaned against the window and pulled out his phone. With a jolt of excitement he saw that Dream was online, and had just sent him a text.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: would u rather have time travel or telekinesis\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: both but telekinesis would be better. besides, time travel can go wrong in so many ways. i don\u2019t want to accidentally change the entire world\n\n\ndreamwastaken: hm. fair\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: ok ok i have a good one\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: would you rather: read out loud everything u read or sing everything u say\n\n\ndreamwastaken: dumb question but easy. singing\n\n\ndreamwastaken: would u rather be a reverse mermaid or reverse centaur\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: what the hell\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: answer the question!!\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: reverse centaur probably. i don\u2019t think i could deal with being a fish\n\n\nGeorge smiled, and Sapnap peered over at his phone. \u201cWho are you texting?\u201d\n\n\nHeart jumping, George turned his phone off and turned it away from Sapnap\u2019s prying eyes. \u201cNo one.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re just like Clay. I swear, he probably has a hidden girlfriend we don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEven if I did,\u201d Clay said amusedly, not looking up from his phone, \u201cI\u2019d never tell.\u201d\n\n\nSkeppy rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah. We know.\u201d He kicked the back of the front seat (Clay had immediately claimed shotgun) and Clay huffed a small laugh.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge glanced down at his phone again; Dream hadn\u2019t responded in a few minutes, and he was probably in the middle of something then. He shut his phone off and turned to neatly slide into Sapnap and Ponk\u2019s conversation.\u00a0\n\n\nBad pulled into the Domino\u2019s parking lot a few seconds later, and Sapnap checked the time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThirty five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cClay, you wanna order?\u201d\n\n\nClay nodded and went up to the cashier. The girl behind the counter laughed, said something back, and twisted a strand of hair around her finger. Clay responded casually and leaned across the counter, the beginning of a careless smirk tugging at the edge of his lips. George glanced curiously at them before turning away. He wasn\u2019t sure why his stomach felt weird.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in ten minutes,\u201d Clay said, upon returning to the table. \u201cShe gave me a twenty percent discount, how nice of her.\u201d\n\n\nPonk coughed into his elbow. The cough sounded suspiciously like because you were flirting.\u00a0\n\n\nClay rolled his eyes and pushed Ponk\u2019s shoulder lightly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t, but okay.\u201d\n\n\nPonk scoffed. \u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nConversation flowed easily after that, and Clay settled in by interjecting something that made everybody laugh. George laughed too, but if you had asked him what was so funny, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen the pizza arrived, everyone eagerly dug in. Skeppy stole half of the cinnamon twists, before pushing the rest at George and demanding that he try them (good, but too sweet and greasy for his taste). He reached for another slice of pizza instead, and laughed at Skeppy\u2019s mock-hurt expression.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d Clay said conversationally, \u201cDo you have Domino\u2019s in Britain?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d George said, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been a Pizza Hut person.\u201d\n\n\nClay grinned and punched the air. \u201cFinally. Everyone here has terrible taste.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast food,\u201d Sapnap muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be good.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI have standards,\u201d Clay declared, \u201cAnd Pizza Hut lives up to them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re lying,\u201d Ponk said. \u201cIt tastes like cardboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\nGeorge took another sip of his drink and stayed quiet. As the days passed, George was getting better at reading the group dynamics. Clearly, everyone looked up to and respected Clay the most. It wasn\u2019t hard to see why\u2014 he was easygoing and social, and got along well with almost everyone. The rest of the school admired him as well. So far he and George hadn\u2019t talked much, but George secretly hoped that would change.\u00a0\n\n\nHistorically, George hadn\u2019t gotten along well with the \u201cpopular\u201d kids at school; he was quiet, and often ignored, and the popular kids were often rowdy, loud, and conceited. So far Clay didn\u2019t seem like that, though\u2014 he seemed genuinely down to earth. George appreciated that.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Alyssa said, and checked her watch, \u201cWe have to go soon, we have less than ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShotgun!\u201d Ponk called quickly.\n\n\nClay rolled his eyes, but generously conceded the front seat to Ponk as they left the restaurant. George mentally prepared himself for his next two classes, easily the two most boring classes in his day, even though he liked learning computer science. It was always worse after lunch, too, when everyone in the class was loud and hyperactive right after a break.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBuckle your seatbelts!\u201d Bad said, before he even started the car.\u00a0\n\n\nAlyssa gave a thumbs up once everyone was firmly belted in place, and slowly Bad pulled out of the parking lot. They made it back to school with a few minutes to spare and then all split up their separate ways\u2014 Sapnap and Clay had science together, fifth period, but George had no one in his last two classes.\n\n\nComputer science passed in a daze, and so did Spanish. George stared at the clock\u2014 it dragged on slowly, and each minute seemed to take hours. The teacher was scribbling something on the board, something about verb tenses and vocabulary, but George\u2019s thoughts couldn\u2019t stay focused. He still took notes, but none of the information stuck in his head. He kept wanting to text Dream, but the very first day, his Spanish teacher had said, in no uncertain terms, that any phone use in her class would be an immediate detention.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, after an exhausting hour, the Friday bell rang. The classroom erupted into excited chatter. As soon as George left the room, he immediately checked his phone. Dream hadn\u2019t sent him anything past their dumb little \u201cwould you rather\u201d earlier, so George just sent a friendly hello and a brief complaint about how boring school was.\u00a0\n\n\nHe made his way to his locker and took out his textbooks; teachers had just begun assigning homework for over the weekend. George would need to carry home his textbooks if he wanted to get any work done.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Sapnap said, neatly interrupting George\u2019s thoughts. \u201cDo you want to come bowling with us?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBowling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and waved a hand absentmindedly. \u201cThere\u2019s a bowling alley a few blocks from here and we usually go on Friday afternoons. You in?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge ducked his head and admitted sheepishly, \u201cI\u2019ve never been bowling.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap blinked, and then his smile became broader. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you. Come on, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d George said, doubtful. He closed his locker and zipped up his backpack, mentally wincing at the weight of it. \u201cI\u2019m probably not very good\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap didn\u2019t give him a chance to overthink it, because he grabbed George\u2019s hand and yanked him along. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a ball and you throw it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know what bowling is,\u201d George said petulantly. \u201cI\u2019ve just never done it.\u201d\n\n\nNo matter what George said, Sapnap waved it off and continued describing what bowling was, as if George were a six year old who had never heard of it before. He certainly made it sound much more exciting than bowling actually was\u2014 wasn\u2019t bowling just throwing a ball with three holes and trying to knock over pins?\u00a0\n\n\nThe bowling alley was around the back of the mall parking lot, a wide stretch of concrete that bordered dozens of stores. Luckily for them, the mall was a fifteen minute walk from Lakeside High\u2014 a sweltering, sweaty walk if it was hot, but other than that, a manageable distance.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to Sapnap, \u201cBowling Fridays\u201d were a thing for their friend group\u2014 a sort of tradition that George was now invited to join in on. They had started ever since Skeppy first scored the job at the bowling alley, and thus got them everything for free.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t tell his manager,\u201d Sapnap said quickly, \u201cThe employee discounts on the nachos are great and I\u2019m not paying full price for them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d George said, still confused, and then Sapnap tugged him inside.\u00a0\n\n\nThe bowling alley was riotous and loud and full of brightly colored flashing lights, each lighting up different sections of the ceiling. At one end of the massive room was an arcade, full of ticket games and first person shooter games, and on the other end was a tiny restaurant area. In between cut ten lengthy bowling aisles, each one with its own seating section. At the farthest bowling alley, George could recognize a few faces, sitting on arranged sofas and chairs. Backpacks were piled to the side and subsequently ignored. Someone\u2019s half-drunk slushie was in the middle of the table, accompanied by two enormous buckets of popcorn, and there was a plate of greasy looking nachos that made Sapnap\u2019s eyes light up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome over here,\u201d Sapnap beckoned, before they went to go meet his friends, \u201cYou need to get some bowling shoes.\u201d\n\n\nDid people actually wear bowling shoes? \u201cI thought those were a joke.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t scratch up the floors, see?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis makes no sense,\u201d George muttered, but followed Sapnap to the front desk anyway. The poor employee had been forced into a red and white striped hat, and a shirt with the bowling alley\u2019s name plastered across it. He handed Sapnap a pair of shoes without having to ask, and then found a pair when George told him his shoe size. Bowling shoes in hand, Sapnap pulled George onwards.\u00a0\n\n\nThere was a chorus of hellos as they arrived, and George found himself plonked down on one of the sofas. Almost everyone was there\u2014 Alyssa and Clay were still missing, but Bad assured George that they would be there soon.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore sitting down, Sapnap quickly entered his and George\u2019s names into the bowling system, a tiny screen in the center of the table that showed everyone\u2019s scores. The first thing Sapnap did was enter his name and George\u2019s name into the bowling system, and the second, reach for a handful of nachos.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThese are so fucking good,\u201d Sapnap said, mouth full of cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and tortilla chips. \u201cGeorge, you have to try them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d Bad said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it PG-13 here, there are kids present.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d\n\n\nBad jerked his thumb in George\u2019s direction. \u201cThis one.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes. He was about to turn seventeen in two months\u2014 his birthday was the first of November\u2014 and he was hardly a child.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the game starting?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlyssa had just arrived, and slung her backpack off with a huff of displeasure. Apparently everyone was carrying home their textbooks that day, too\u2014 George\u2019s back wasn\u2019t the only one aching.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as Clay gets here,\u201d Bad said. \u201cAny second now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Clay said on cue, and dropped into the open seat next to George. \u201cI\u2019m not too late, am I?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRight on time,\u201d Sapnap said. \u201cWhoever\u2019s up first, go and show George how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt oddly nervous for a moment, and conspicuously aware of Clay next to him. Again, he wished that Dream were there; he would make George so much more comfortable.\u00a0\n\n\nSkeppy went first, and picked a bowling ball at random from a rack of them. He managed to knock over most of the pins except for two, and then managed to hit both of those pins on his second throw. He pumped his fist in the air in excitement and his laughter was infectious\u2014 George found himself leaning forwards and watching each person as they took their turn. No one took the game seriously-- which was good, because George was surely horrible at it.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir conversation started at school, and people mentioned the amount of homework they had over the weekend and how awful Mrs. Laeger was (she taught physics, apparently, and was a nightmare) and then somehow, less than fifteen minutes later, they were debating over whether Shrek was a good movie or whether the Bee Movie was better.\n\n\n\u201cThe Bee Movie,\u201d Sapnap said indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me that some ogre has contributed more to society than Barry B. Benson?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut Shrek has an objectively better plot,\u201d Alyssa argued. \u201cNo way a human actually falls in love with a bee.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThen how can a human fall in love with an ogre\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nBad shushed them as Clay\u2019s name flashed across the screen, beckoning him up for his turn. Everyone obligingly went quiet and watched as Clay hefted three different bowling balls. He compared their weights before settling on one the same shade as his hoodie, a dark yellow.\n\n\nEveryone waited with bated breath, and then that breath was let out simultaneously as all ten pins toppled over. There were muttered curses and praise from everyone as Clay turned around, without even seeing his score.\n\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Bad complained. \u201cHow on earth do you always do that?\u201d\n\n\nClay grinned easily. \u201cIt\u2019s all natural talent.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap punched his arm as he sat down, and Clay propped the same arm up on him. \u201cI\u2019m convinced you cheat somehow.\u201d To George he added, \u201cHe always gets a strike or a spare. That means all ten pins knocked over in your turn. None of us have any idea how he does it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d George nodded, even though he didn\u2019t entirely understand the rules of the game yet. To be fair, he didn\u2019t even know that bowling had rules until an hour ago.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that lucky bowling ball,\u201d Sapnap mumbled. \u201cI just need to get the same one as him.\u201d He wriggled his way out from under Clay\u2019s arm as his name popped up across the screen. Instead of dropping his arm, Clay just moved over and leaned against George.\n\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 what?\u201d\n\n\nClay raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re part of our group, right?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge ducked his head. \u201cI guess.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlus you\u2019re shorter than Sap, so this is easier.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that short,\u201d George muttered. \u201cI\u2019m five seven.\u201d\n\n\nBad laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s tiny. You\u2019re so tiny, it\u2019s adorable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tiny.\u201d\n\n\nClay reached over with his other hand and ruffled George\u2019s hair. \u201cOkay, shortie.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge put his face in his hands and mortifyingly, felt himself blush. He hated that this happened whenever he was mildly embarrassed.\u00a0\n\n\nHe looked up and hoped that the flashing lights and colors were too chaotic for anyone to pay much attention to him. Fortunately, they were\u2014 everyone\u2019s attention had moved on from how tall George was to Bad\u2019s turn at bowling. Sapnap retook his seat as Bad stood up, hitting the button for bumpers.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing with bumpers?\u201d Clay said disbelievingly. \u201cThat\u2019s such a baby move.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI like the bumpers,\u201d Bad insisted. \u201cThey\u2019re for learning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re for people who are bad at bowling,\u201d Clay said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re strategic,\u201d argued Bad. \u201cYou can bounce the ball off them.\u201d\n\n\nClay threw his hands into the air. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible at this.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m learning\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t learn by using bumpers\u2014\u201d\n\n\nBad threw the ball recklessly, and true to his words, it ricocheted multiple times off the bumpers, before knocking over half the pins. Ponk gave him a mocking round of applause, and Bad took a gracious bow.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s done,\u201d he proclaimed, and sat back down. Clay rolled his eyes and raised a hand to flip him off. Bad gaped, affronted, and exclaimed language!\n\n\nOnce Bad\u2019s turn had ended, George\u2019s name was the next to flash across the screen. Clay moved his arm so he could get up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGo George!\u201d Alyssa cheered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d Ponk said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you fail,\u201d Sapnap added. Bad swatted his arm.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo bumpers or else it\u2019s cheating,\u201d called Clay, and Sapnap playfully flipped him off. George picked up one of the bowling balls\u2014 it was much heavier than everyone made it seem\u2014 and carefully lined up his shot. He wasn\u2019t really expecting anything of it, but the ball flew down the lane. It was nearly dead center, and knocked down nine of the pins. The last pin wobbled dangerously, before steadying to many groans of displeasure behind him.\n\n\n\u201cThat was so good!\u201d Alyssa exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re great at this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBeginner\u2019s luck,\u201d Clay said dismissively, and reached for another handful of popcorn.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d Bad said admiringly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never bowled before?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shook his head. He felt vaguely proud of himself. \u201cIs bowling a competitive thing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot unless you\u2019re Clay,\u201d Sapnap said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tryhard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAm not,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m better than all of you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Skeppy said cheerfully.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d\n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t help it; he laughed. He liked Sapnap\u2019s infectious humor and Alyssa\u2019s kind cheer. He liked Bad\u2019s relentless enthusiasm, Skeppy\u2019s hyperactive laugh, and Ponk\u2019s dry sarcasm. He liked Clay\u2019s nonchalant humor and his playful arrogance.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was such a fun afternoon, and he was getting to know this friend group so well. It was only a week into his junior year at Lakeside High, and things were already looking up.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was so content that, at the end of the night, he nearly forgot to check if Dream had sent him anything.\n\n\nOctober dawned hot and humid over Orlando, and upon waking up, George immediately decided that going outside that day would be hell. It was supposed to be autumn, for fucks sake, and it was nearly ninety degrees. Was it like this every day? How was anyone supposed to function?\n\n\nHe woke up at six forty five (as the semester continued, George\u2019s morning alarm got progressively later and later) and immediately checked his phone. There were two new messages from Dream, and George\u2019s heart always did a funny little flip whenever he saw that notification.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: good morning!!\n\n\n sent 4:12 AM \n\n\nGeorge yawned and scrubbed a hand over his face. He had gone to sleep at midnight last night, finishing the final questions on his physics homework, and he was exhausted nearly seven hours later. George couldn\u2019t fathom waking up at four in the morning for something.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: why were you awake at 4 am\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i couldn\u2019t sleep\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: fair\n\n\ndreamwastaken: also i finished that plugin we were working on! whenever you\u2019re free we should try it\n\n\nTwo weeks ago Dream had mentioned that he wanted to create a plugin for Minecraft\u2014 they both played, after all, and had played since they were kids\u2014 that allowed one player to have a compass that pointed to another player. It could be pretty interesting for hide and seek, or even a manhunt-style game.\u00a0\n\n\nThey were both learning coding from the ground up\u2014 Dream had tentatively mentioned being interested in it, and George had readily agreed\u2014 meaning that their projects always messed up much more than worked. George had worked on the plug in whenever he was free from school, which was rarely, but apparently Dream had finished it.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: that\u2019s so exciting! i\u2019m free after school today, 4pm ish\n\n\ndreamwastaken: works for me :) it\u2019ll be fun\n\n\nGeorge put his phone away and rushed to get ready for class. He had been on good terms with his history teacher lately, and he wasn\u2019t about to break that streak. He also desperately needed his coffee fix; Dream hated it, and always made fun of him whenever George mentioned needing caffeine. Still, George couldn\u2019t live without it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDrive me in five minutes?\u201d he shouted, and his mum made a muffled note of acknowledgement through her closed bedroom door. George popped a toaster waffle into his mouth and packed up his backpack quickly. He looked at the time and winced; he really should be waking up earlier. He was going to be late if he kept this up.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d his mother said. She grabbed her car keys off the kitchen counter and beckoned to George, who slid into the car. He bolted out as soon as she pulled up to the curb, barely making it in time for the warning bell to ring. He dashed straight to American History\u2014 after a month, George practically knew the school like the back of his hand, even if the buildings were color coded. He slid into his seat right as the second bell rang and class started. Sapnap gave him a fist bump for being on time, and George heaved a breath as he took out his notebook.\n\n\nBy far, American History was his favorite class\u2014 not because of subject material, but because most of the friend group was in his class. They had great conversations in the back of the room, though Sapnap distracted him too much for George to get any work done. George was fairly sure that the teacher regretted allowing all of them to sit together. He was also fairly sure that the teacher now thought of him as one of the troublemakers, too.\n\n\nIt was true, though: somehow Sapnap had started dragging him into school pranks. The other day, Sapnap had begun his crusade to change every clock in the school to the wrong time. He had completed all of the ones in the science wing but needed George to help him with it, and reluctantly, George agreed.\u00a0They were halfway through the entire school, at that point.\n\n\nSapnap\u2019s pranks weren\u2019t always that harmless\u2014 apparently last year Sapnap had set off illegal fireworks outside during a school-wide assembly, and had almost gotten suspended for it. It was still a legendary tale throughout Orlando High, and Sapnap still got congratulated for it almost six months later.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand how cool it was,\u201d Bad had said, even though his tone said he disapproved of all of Sapnap\u2019s antics, \u201cIt was right as the seniors were about to get their academic awards, and then all of a sudden, boom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe would\u2019ve gotten expelled for that at my old school,\u201d George had said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis is Florida,\u201d Bad had said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the school knows how to expel people.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge had rolled his eyes. The more he learned about Lakeside High, the more he liked it. Everyone was carefree and friendly\u2014 much different to the rigid rules of his private school in Brighton. They all seemed to not take things seriously, and to just have fun. Already, George felt like he was more like himself in America than he ever was in Britain.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir teacher scrawled a lesson plan on the whiteboard. Sapnap continued whispering to George\u2014 something about switching the locks on people\u2019s lockers\u2014 when their teacher turned to him.\n\n\n\u201cSapnap,\u201d the history teacher said, unamusedly, \u201cQuiet in the back row.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap mimed zipping his lips and locking them, and then dramatically tossed the key away. \u201cI\u2019ll be quiet from now on, Mrs. Carter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I say about talking?\u201d she shot back. She also gave George a warning look too, who sighed\u2014 he had barely spoken in her class ever. Still, he didn\u2019t mind being lumped in with Sapnap. At least Sapnap was funny to be around, and a great friend.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other thing with being \u201clumped in\u201d with Sapnap is that George had somehow managed to gather a reputation at Lakeside High School for being \"cool\" and \"mysterious.\" It was quite the opposite of how George thought of himself (geeky and weird). Apparently, as Ponk informed him, people liked his accent, and they liked that he was from Britain. And, according to Alyssa, people found him attractive.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge could understand the accent, but attractive? That was incomprehensible. George didn\u2019t even find himself attractive, so how could someone else?\u00a0\n\n\nBut as the days climbed on, George did notice how other people acted around him: one blonde girl giggled nervously and tucked her hair behind her ears, another person said hi to him in the hallway in a bright, cheery voice, and another person tried to strike up a conversation before realizing George just\u2026 wasn\u2019t interested. It made him feel all weird and jelly-like on the inside\u2014 not because he was interested in them, but because he couldn\u2019t quite understand why they would try and talk to him when he didn\u2019t even know their names.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because you are attractive,\u201d Alyssa explained after school, as best as she could. Her tone was matter-of-fact. \u201cAlso, the accent makes you so much more interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said, somewhat sourly. Alyssa laughed and nudged him with her shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cNot that you\u2019re not interesting in the first place,\u201d she corrected. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know you at all, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said slowly, contemplating it. \u201cI guess.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThink of it this way,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cYou\u2019ve found people interesting before, and wanted to be their friend, right?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s thoughts strayed to Dream first, and then surprisingly, Clay after. He supposed it was true\u2014 he could understand the desire to befriend people who he found interesting.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like that, except instead of wanting to be friends, they want to date you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWeird,\u201d George said, frowning. What was the appeal of wanting to date someone you barely knew?\n\n\nAfter, George politely diverted their conversation to something that was more comfortable, and graciously, Alyssa allowed it. He actually really enjoyed talking to her; she was really nice and a great conversationalist. George hoped that he would get to know her better; he had a feeling that they could be really good friends.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir conversation continued until George realized that it had been nearly an hour after the final bell, and he needed to get home. Alyssa waved goodbye, and they went their separate ways.\n\n\nThe next day at school, the choking humidity of Florida was nearly painful. It felt as if he were breathing in literal steam\u2014 it\u00a0 was so much worse than the day before. The temperature, too, seemed to have only gone up. Even though George\u2019s walk to school was mostly shaded, he still longed to be inside, where the cool air conditioning made everything better.\n\n\nHe grimaced, turned on his phone, and sent a quick text to Dream. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: it\u2019s so humid where i live right now oh my god\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: its always like that for me lmao. it\u2019s hell\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: my hair is such a mess\n\n\ndreamwastaken: don\u2019t say thattt i\u2019m sure u look cute\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: stop im blushing\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: goal achieved :)\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes. Dream was such an idiot sometimes. He didn\u2019t even know what George looked like, but he never failed to compliment him.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge pocketed his phone as the warning bell rang; the passing period between third and fourth period was five minutes longer, so people could grab a snack if they wanted in between classes. He still had a few minutes before he had to actually be at precalculus, but George didn\u2019t want to be late.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a sigh, he recalled that his homework from the night before had been practically incomprehensible. George had never been good at mathematics\u2014 even though computer science was one of his strong suits, math had always been awful for him. As the semester progressed, the topics they studied became more and more complex. George realized that he would only become more confused if he didn\u2019t understand the basics now.\u00a0\n\n\nClay was already in the classroom, scrolling through something on his phone. He had his feet kicked up on the chair in front of him, and his chair tilted back slightly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d George said, and slid into his chair. Clay gave him a wry hello, but barely any other acknowledgement. For some reason, George felt disappointed at that little response.\n\n\nWhy was he disappointed?\n\n\nThirty minutes in, after their teacher had finished the lecture for the day, a worksheet was passed out for them to complete by the end of class. It didn\u2019t seem that hard for Clay, who immediately pulled out his graphing calculator and began working on it. George looked down at the questions and tried to find a good place to start\u2014 they had started off easy in the semester, refreshing everyone who had just taken Algebra II. Still, he barely understood what was on the page.\n\n\nHe did his best and made it through about half of it, though he was fairly sure all of the answers were wrong. He felt more frustrated as time passed, and eventually muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t get this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMath isn\u2019t that hard,\u201d Clay said, and leaned over to look at George\u2019s worksheet. \u201cYou\u2019re just messing up somewhere. Let me see your work.\u201d\n\n\nHe held out a hand and obligingly, George passed over his worksheet. Clay hummed absently as he flipped through it, and he traced his finger down the page as his eyes skimmed down it. He propped his chin up with one hand and moved onto the next page. The sunlight streamed through the back windows, illuminating Clay in golden light. It made him look graceful, ethereal. George quite liked looking at him, actually.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t realize he was staring until Clay looked over at him and raised an eyebrow questioningly. George flushed and ducked his head, quickly looking away.\n\n\nFinally, Clay turned to him. \u201cYou\u2019re confusing irrational numbers with complex numbers,\u201d he explained simply. \u201cComplex ones have i in them, see\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHe turned George\u2019s work over and scrawled a few numbers down, and then went through the steps for multiplying and solving them. Amazingly, George followed along, though he was a little bit distracted by how close Clay was to him. It was so much easier to understand when it was explained slowly and methodically; George couldn\u2019t fathom why teachers didn\u2019t teach like this.\n\n\n\u201cDoes that make more sense?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said. Why was he feeling so flustered? He coughed lightly and tried to clear his throat. \u201cIt does. Thanks, I really appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you ever need more help, I\u2019ll give it,\u201d Clay said. \n\n\nFor a quick moment, George really admired his competency\u2014 it was attractive to be not just good, but confident with everything.\u00a0He thought he quite liked Clay\u2019s confidence. \n\n\nGeorge took his worksheet back and glanced quickly over the problems he would have to redo. It wouldn\u2019t take that long, hopefully, and now that he had some concrete instructions it might be easier. Clay\u2019s numbers were carelessly written across the back. His handwriting was really nice\u2014 not perfectly neat or anything, but the kind of handwriting that one wanted to look at.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d George repeated. Clay gave him a small smile, more of an arrogant smirk than anything else, and suddenly George felt his heart drop into his stomach.\n\n\nMaybe there was a reason why he liked looking at Clay so much.\n\n\nWell, fuck.\u00a0\n\n\nAs soon as school ended, George texted Dream in a panic.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: code red help i need your advice\n\n\nDream\u2019s response came almost instantly.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: what do u need?\n\n\nGeorge started typing, and then frowned and deleted it. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how to put it into words. Eventually he just gritted his teeth and sent it.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i met this guy. and he\u2019s cute. like REALLY cute. but he\u2019s also super popular and i'm kind of intimidated by him??\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i get so nervous around him and i feel like you would have good advice on what to do\u00a0\n\n\n dreamwastaken is typing\u2026 \n\n\n dreamwastaken is typing\u2026 \n\n\nThe three dots popped up, fell, and then appeared again. George stood up and paced in circles around his room. Dream had been typing for nearly two minutes, which felt like ages. Finally his response came.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: idk\n\n\nGeorge huffed.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: thats not very helpful :(\n\n\ndreamwastaken: maybe just tell him everything u just told me.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: im too shy thats terrifying\n\n\ndreamwastaken: idk what to tell u.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: ugh maybe he\u2019ll just realize im super cute and fall in love w me first\n\n\nDream\u2019s reply took ages to come. George was starting to wonder if his phone or computer had died, or if his wifi had given out, when he responded.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: haha yeah\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i gtg\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: are you okay?\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yeah lmao. i just have chores\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: ok!! have fun with that\u00a0\n\n\n dreamwastaken is offline. \n\n\nWell, that had been spectacularly unhelpful. George rolled over and smashed his face into his pillow. He had really been hoping that Dream\u2019s advice would be helpful in tackling the problem.\n\n\nGeorge scrolled through their conversation again, frowned, and then again. The more he read it the more upset Dream seemed. There was no way he would be doing chores at eight PM on a Wednesday night. And he\u2019d never mentioned being forced to do chores before. So why would Dream lie to him like that?\n\n\nWhat had he done to make Dream so upset?\n\n\nGeorge stared at his phone for another moment. A sick feeling of alarm swooped through his stomach, like vertigo at the edge of a cliff. \n\n\nDream knew that George wasn\u2019t straight\u2014 they had a long conversation about it at two in the morning years ago, and George was incredibly relieved that his best friend was so accepting of him. Clearly Dream wasn\u2019t upset about George liking a boy.\u00a0So what was he upset about?\n\n\nHe knew that his thoughts were going in circles, that they were leading him nowhere, but he worried so much about Dream that it was ridiculous. He didn\u2019t want to lose his best friend.\n\n\nHe started typing something out\u2014 he wasn\u2019t sure what he even wanted to say. Maybe an apology? Maybe a question?\u00a0\n\n\nHe deleted it just as quickly. It was probably just exhaustion or stress, and everything would go back to normal the next morning.\n\n\nHopefully.\n\n\nThe morning arrived. Things, stubbornly, did not go back to normal.\n\n\nWell, they did, but not in the regular sense. Dream and George sent each other good morning texts, and George felt some of his stress fade away. He didn\u2019t seem upset or worried, and when George tentatively asked him about his texts last night, Dream just said that he was tired and not really thinking straight. It was perfectly explanatory. George felt somewhat foolish for having worried so much over it.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge shouldered his backpack on the way to school and shuddered at the weight of it. All of his homework plus two textbooks were shoved inside. At the beginning of the semester he had made a silent promise to himself to make sure that he never forgot an assignment (that had been a common occurrence for him back in Brighton) and so far, he was making good on that promise. It had stolen a few hours of sleep from him, and ten years off his spine, but his grades were high and stayed that way.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d Sapnap said, as soon as George opened his locker.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cStress,\u201d George muttered, and hoped that explained it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou need to relax more,\u201d Sapnap said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting burgers at lunch, are you coming?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap grinned. \u201cPerfect.\u201d They turned down the hallway together, but then Sapnap stopped abruptly.\n\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said nonchalantly, \u201cDo you have the American History homework done?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge gave Sapnap a skeptical look. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\nSapnap grimaced. \u201cI may have just realized that I didn\u2019t finish it last night.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you copy my homework.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap frowned and pouted. \u201cI\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d When George didn\u2019t immediately cave, Sapnap gave him pure puppy-dog eyes. \u201cPlease?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge huffed, and unzipped his backpack to give Sapnap his answers. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap flashed him a smile. The two of them settled against the lockers as Sapnap furiously scribbled down as much as he could before the bell rang. George stared absentmindedly at the lockers down the hall and the rowdy students chatting with each other.\n\n\nWithout meaning to, George\u2019s eyes strayed to Clay, down the hall. He was chatting easily with some girl that George didn\u2019t recognize. He was leaning against his locker, an easy grin on his face, and reached up to a run a hand through his hair carelessly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Sapnap gushed. \u201cI owe you one, seriously.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t respond for a moment, too caught up in looking at Clay, and Sapnap raised an eyebrow and followed his gaze.\n\n\n\u201cLooking at Clay again?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d George said, too loudly. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeems like you are.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s ears turned pink. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Sapnap said, sing-song.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d George insisted.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap shrugged, but a devious smile was still on his face. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge scowled. Sure, Clay was attractive: tall, tanned, and freckled. Sure, he was stubbornly good at everything, and incredibly confident too. And sure, he was magnetic\u2014 drawing George closer every time. He may have felt comfortable telling Dream about his crush, but he didn't know if he wanted to tell Sapnap, too.\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Sapnap urged, oblivious to George's thoughts, \u201cWe\u2019ll be late.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge let himself be tugged down the hallway towards history, but he couldn\u2019t stop replaying Sapnap\u2019s words in his head. They took their seats in the back of the class and passed their worksheets up to the front; still, George heard his words on repeat.\n\n\nThe thing with George is that he rarely did things halfway. The last time he had a crush, it had pretty much consumed his entire thoughts until he abruptly got over it one day. He couldn\u2019t help it. It was the type of thing that just happened, and he never understood why other people were able to fall in and out of attraction as easily as they did. For him, romance had always been a hundred percent or zero. There was nothing wrong with having a crush, George understood that was entirely normal, but it was a lot of energy expended on something that would never happen.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only person who really understood was Dream, who shared the same thing. They had talked about it when Dream was dating his last girlfriend, and George realized that other people experienced the same thing as he did. It was relieving and wonderful to hear.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe that was why George was so hesitant to confess to Sapnap\u2014 because Sapnap might not understand what crushes were like for him.\n\n\nAmerican History passed in a daze, the English, then Physics, and before he knew it, pre calculus arrived. George took his usual seat, right in the back middle, and Clay sat next to him. He studiously kept his eyes on the seat in front of him, not looking at Clay.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPlease pass your homework to the front,\u201d the teacher called. George passed his homework up\u2014 he had done it much slower this time, actually taking the time to multiply everything correctly and show all his work, and he was fairly sure he had gotten most of the work correct.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDid you understand it more?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe homework,\u201d Clay gestured. \u201cDid it make more sense?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d George said. \u201cYeah. Yes. I got it.\u201d\n\n\nThe smallest hint of a smile appeared at the corner of Clay\u2019s mouth. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt the tips of his ears go red. Why did that always happen when he was embarrassed?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI might need more help on this, too,\u201d George blurted. \u201cPolynomials.\u201d\n\n\nWhat? Immediately, George wished he could take the words back. He understood polynomials. It was possibly the one thing in precalculus that he knew how to do. Why was he asking for help?\u00a0\n\n\nClay shrugged. \u201cI can help you when we split into partners.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge wanted to facepalm. Why was he so bad at this?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clay said, as soon as the teacher allowed them to split up into pairs to work, \u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge had dug himself into a hole. He flustered for an answer, and then finally said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how to multiply them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Clay said, \u201cHere, I can show you.\u201d He moved his chair closer to George\u2019s desk, and George mentally reminded himself to breathe. He watched Clay\u2019s hand as he scrawled down variables and numbers, fingers long and slender. He looked at the pleased, self-assured smile that appeared when George got the right answer after Clay\u2019s tutelage. He tried his best to ignore the distracting presence of Clay right next to him.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd as much as George tried, he didn\u2019t recall a single thing from class that afternoon.\u00a0\n\n\nHe breathed a long, low sigh of relief as the bell rang, and class ended. Clay waved a slight goodbye as he headed down the hallway towards his locker. George pulled out his phone and texted Dream as he headed towards the student parking lot.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: this crush is becoming a problem\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: u would like him too i bet\n\n\nAs soon as he sent it, George saw Dream\u2019s profile picture turn green, a sign that he was online. The read text button appeared just under George\u2019s latest messages. Then just as quickly, Dream went offline again.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge stared at it, brow furrowed, and his stomach twisted in an uncomfortable knot. What had just happened?\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe, George reasoned, he was just in some place where he couldn\u2019t text easily, like in the middle of class or talking with his friends. Dream would probably reply soon when he had time to actually send something back.\u00a0\n\n\nHe approached Bad's car, and asked, \u201cWhere are we going today?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFive Guys,\u201d Skeppy said excitedly. \u201cThe best burger place in Florida.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap smacked him. \u201cDon\u2019t disrespect Shake Shack like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShake Shack has better shakes,\u201d Skeppy allowed, \u201cBut the burgers at Five Guys are better.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap rolled his eyes, but conceded the point. George checked his phone again; he didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Dream\u2019s reaction was so unlike him that it made George slightly worried. He would probably check in later after school, and maybe they could do something together\u2014 just the two of them, like things used to be. Play Minecraft, go on a server, something that was relaxing.\u00a0\n\n\nNow that George thought about it, the more he realized that he and Dream had talked much less this past month. George had been so busy with new friends, with new classes, with a new place, that he hadn\u2019t spent as much time talking with him. Versus two months ago, before school started up, George spent nearly all of his time texting.\u00a0\n\n\nIt made him sort of lonely, sort of wistful, and George resolved to talk to Dream more. It would be nice for them to have another deep talk, the sort that only happened at two in the morning.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cClay,\u201d Ponk called, and startled George out of his thoughts. \u201cHurry up.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge glanced up; Clay seemed distracted, and he looked at his phone, brow furrowed, before seemingly shaking himself out of it and hopping in the car. The drive to the burger place was quiet, interspersed with Bad\u2019s and Skeppy\u2019s conversation from the front seat. When they arrived, everyone placed their orders and then moved outside to a picnic table.\u00a0\n\n\nPonk frowned at Clay. \u201cNot getting anything?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Clay said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m just not that hungry. I'll steal someone\u2019s fries, though, pass them over.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlyssa slid over her fries agreeably, and Clay took a decent handful. Still, George caught Sapnap\u2019s confused glance over at his friend. Apparently Clay\u2019s downcast mood wasn\u2019t usual.\n\n\nThey finished their burgers and fries, and Ponk gathered up their trash to toss away. George ate the last few cajun fries left in the basket, before following everyone as they left the restaurant. Bad was the last, and was probably using the restroom.\u00a0\n\n\nAs George was waiting for Bad to come out of the building, he saw Sapnap catch Clay by his shirtsleeve and drag him around the corner. George knew he shouldn\u2019t listen to their conversation, that it was probably wrong to do so, but their voices filtered through to him regardless.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sapnap said, voice muffled. He sounded concerned. George stared at the restaurant and willed Bad to come outside so they could leave.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Clay said, sounding much more bitter than George had ever heard him act before. \u201cIt\u2019s something personal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cParents again?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Clay said. Slightly dismissive. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out on my own.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201d Bad said, and closed the door behind him. \u201cIs everyone ready to leave?\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa gestured. \u201cClay and Sap are talking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTell them to hurry up,\u201d Ponk said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late to fifth period.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Bad huffed, and rounded the corner. He reappeared two seconds later with both Clay and Sapnap in tow. George tried not to stare at Clay, but couldn\u2019t help it\u2014 he looked tired, more so than usual, but not upset in any way. It was like he had pulled a mask back on over his actual feelings.\n\n\nQuickly everyone hopped into the car. This time, Sapnap stole the front seat before Clay could manage to call shotgun, and instead Clay sat in the middle row, to the left of George.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge tried not to stare, but for some reason, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like Clay\u2019s bad mood was caused by him. It was ridiculous\u2014 George had done nothing of the sort. But the thought still resided at the edge of his mind.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter school, George zipped his backpack up and out of habit, checked his phone. To his delight, he saw that Dream had texted him back.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: lmao maybe\n\n\nHis response didn\u2019t make any sense until George read what he had sent earlier: u would like him too i bet. George wasn\u2019t sure how to respond, but before he could figure something out, Dream sent him another message.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i\u2019m tired. ignore me\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: sleep well :(\n\n\ndreamwastaken: sure\n\n\ndreamwastaken: &lt;3\n\n\nGeorge looked at the little emoticon and wondered why it had almost felt like an afterthought, as if Dream wasn\u2019t planning to send that in the first place.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: &lt;3\n\n\nHe sent one back cautiously, and Dream \u201cliked\u201d the message. It made George breathe easier; he hated whenever people were upset with him. It made him feel like he had done something wrong, even if he knew he hadn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge pulled out his math homework, knowing that it was going to take the longest out of any of his assignments for the night. He looked through the three pages of questions that their teacher had assigned them (that much math should be made illegal, in George\u2019s opinion) and slowly began working through the first one.\u00a0\n\n\nHe kept thinking back to that class; how Clay looked, right in the back of the classroom, where the sun streamed in through the windows. It made his hair look dusty blonde instead of darker, and made his eyes glow when the sunlight struck them.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge gave himself a minute shake, and tried to focus. He needed to stop thinking about Clay. And yet, he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next morning, George approached Sapnap\u2019s locker and sighed.\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he admitted, against his better judgement. \u201cI do have a crush.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap wrapped an arm around George\u2019s shoulders and gave him an affectionate squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer in denial, finally.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes and ducked out from Sapnap\u2019s arm. \u201cNow what do I do?\u201d\n\n\nSapnap pondered that for a moment. \u201cNow you win him over!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d George said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s so helpful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLuckily I can help you,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cBecause everyone\u2019s had a crush on Clay at some point, so I have lots of experience. He\u2019s pretty much everyone\u2019s dream boy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEveryone?\u201d George repeated, feeling a little pale.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sapnap amended, \u201cAt least lots of people. He\u2019s the most popular guy in school, you know? He\u2019s never dated anyone though, always comes up with excuses and stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d George said, dimming slightly. \u201cWonderful to know.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis sarcasm wasn\u2019t lost on Sapnap, who rolled his eyes. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, I think you have a decent chance. You\u2019ve really caught his attention, you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sapnap waited until George closed his locker, and then moved down the hallway towards his own. \u201cHe usually doesn\u2019t get along well with people outside of our group, but he talks about you a lot.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge stared at his friend. \u201cHe talks about me? Wait, wait, what does he say?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d Sapnap said, shrugging loftily. \u201cPinkie promise, you know?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t complain; his best friend was also very big on privacy, and George respected that no matter what. It was nice to hear that he possibly had a chance, though.\u00a0\n\n\nThe thing was that Clay was popular\u2014 very popular. Popular enough that he could have had his choice of where to sit at lunch, or what friends to hang out with. Nearly everyone wanted to be his friend, but for some reason, he chose to sit with Sapnap and all their friends. George didn\u2019t know how he could compete with everyone else.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe compete was the wrong word\u2014 stand out? Earn his trust?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWill you help me?\u201d George found himself asking. Sapnap looked at him for a moment before breaking into a grin.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can,\u201d Sapnap promised. \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m your official wingman.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge breathed a sigh of release. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I know.\u201d Sapnap shut his locker with a slam and turned down the hallway. \u201cFirst things first\u2014 can you hold these for me?\u201d\n\n\nHe shoved a binder and a folder full of loose papers into George\u2019s arms. Bewildered, George took them. He glanced down and then back at Sapnap. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with these?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Sapnap said, strolling down the hallway. \u201cI have a plan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour plan sounds like it sucks,\u201d George said, and rushed to catch up.\n\n\nClay was at his locker, staring at it with a tiny divot between his brows. He looked spaced out, but turned as Sapnap and George approached.\n\n\nJust then, Sapnap stuck his foot out, and tripped George. George barely caught himself, but he let go of all of Sapnap\u2019s papers to do so. They went flying, and Clay\u2019s mouth opened in surprise.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d George hissed, and cursed under his breath. He began grabbing loose papers that had fluttered everywhere. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause Clay is helping you clean up,\u201d Sapnap said quietly, but George could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cClassic high school cliche.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are the worst,\u201d George muttered, and quickly silenced himself as Clay approached with a handful of worksheets.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d George said, going red, and fumbled for an excuse. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014 clumsy.\u201d\n\n\nClay gave a nonchalant shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He tapped the papers into a neat stack, and then handed them to George. \u201cHappens to everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said breathlessly.\u00a0\n\n\nClay shrugged. Sapnap grinned. George sighed.\n\n\nIt was going to be a long week.\u00a0\n\n\nThat night, George opened his computer, intending to begin his English essay, before looking down at his phone again in distraction.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was debating asking Dream something, ever since he had realized how little they had been talking recently. They had discussed it once before, very briefly, when George mentioned that he was moving to a different school. Dream had asked where, and George said East Coast\u2014 in theory, the truth. \u00a0He knew it was likely close to where Dream lived; he had some sense of Dream\u2019s timezone, from his good morning and goodnight texts, but he didn\u2019t know exactly where. \n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t control where his mum\u2019s job took them\u2014 but George still felt like he had invaded Dream\u2019s privacy in some way. Dream had gone radio dark for a few days after that. Hesitantly, George had checked in. Their conversation went something like this:\n\n\n georgenotfound: we don\u2019t have to meet up \n\n\n dreamwastaken: i know. sorry for being overdramatic about it and ghosting you \n\n\n dreamwastaken: it just feels weird \n\n\n georgenotfound: i won\u2019t bring it up again if it\u2019s that big a deal to you \n\n\n dreamwastaken: its not that big a deal honestly it\u2019s just.. i feel like i keep these parts of my lives so separate? i have you and then i have my irl friends. i like to keep it that way \n\n\n georgenotfound: i get that \n\n\n georgenotfound: so drop the meeting up topic? \n\n\n dreamwastaken: for now, yeah \n\n\nGeorge hadn\u2019t pressed since then. It was true, what Dream said about keeping parts of his lives separated; his friends back in Brighton knew that he had an internet friend who he was pretty close to, but it felt odd to say that Dream was his best friend as opposed to someone in real life. He guessed that it was the same for Dream as well.\n\n\nStill, George had been living in Florida for nearly three and a half months already. He hadn\u2019t asked since, but now that he had thought about it, it wouldn\u2019t leave his mind. He gritted his teeth and willed himself to just say it\u2014 what was the worst that could happen? Dream would say no? That wasn\u2019t so bad. Besides, they hadn't been talking as much recently. Maybe Dream would be more open to it this time.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: this might come out of the blue\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: but would you ever rethink the meeting up thing?\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: it\u2019s okay if not\n\n\nHe put his phone to the side and firmly directed his attention away from it. He felt shaky, and wasn\u2019t entirely sure why\u2014 he had always assumed that he and Dream were going to meet up at some point in their lives, so why not now?\n\n\nGeorge finally resolved to start working on his essay, which desperately needed to be written. They had just started reading Fahrenheit 451 in class (which should have been called Celsius 232, in George\u2019s opinion) and the teacher had assigned them to write an analysis of the first three chapters. It wasn\u2019t the best book George had read, but it was certainly better than the lengthy Dickens novels that he had been forced to read back in Brighton. He had gotten a few sentences in when his phone buzzed.\n\n\nGeorge snatched it up in excitement, and then his heart fell.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: this probably isn\u2019t what you want to hear but i\u2019m not ready for that\n\n\ndreamwastaken: sorry\n\n\nIt was what George had been expecting, after all. He didn\u2019t feel that disappointed about it. He had assumed what Dream\u2019s answer would be.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: that\u2019s cool! don\u2019t worry about it\n\n\ndreamwastaken: thanks\n\n\ndreamwastaken: sorry again\n\n\nDream was the kind of person who really valued his privacy. It had taken a while before they had even started private messaging each other, anyway, and it had taken another few months before Dream begrudgingly shared more details about his life. George never pushed\u2014 people were ready with different things at different times, of course\u2014 but at some point, he really would like to meet him.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: its okay, i don\u2019t mind\n\n\nGeorge looked back at his English essay and typed out another sentence, before giving up and closing his computer in frustration. He just wasn\u2019t in the mood to write an essay just then, and he didn\u2019t think he could bring himself to focus.\n\n\nInstead, George hopped on Minecraft, and loaded the survival multiplayer he and Dream had created a few days ago. Within a few minutes, he lost himself in the game\u2014 but he couldn\u2019t forget Dream\u2019s hesitancy, and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be any less upset.\u00a0 \n\n\nIt had been one week and so far, Sapnap was the worst possible wingman in the world.\n\n\nGeorge secretly thought that Sapnap had watched one absurdly cliche, classic high school chick flick and then was basing all of his flirting knowledge off of that. So far, he had a. made George trip and fall, scattering papers all over, and now Clay probably thought of George as the biggest klutz of all time, and b. wrote an obviously fake love letter and demanded that George slip it through the slats of Clay\u2019s locker. George promised he would do it, and then as soon as Sapnap\u2019s back was turned, ran the letter through the paper shredder. He had standards, and writing anonymous love letters wasn\u2019t the way to go.\u00a0\n\n\nBut despite having Sapnap on his side, and slight hope that things might go well, George still found himself sinking lower. Dream had been in a mood all week, ever since George had mentioned that he had a crush. And George didn\u2019t know what to do about it.\n\n\nThe day after talking to Sapnap confessing his crush, he had texted Dream again. This time, Dream was slightly more active, but George could tell that something was wrong.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i need dating advice\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: how do i get someone to like me back\n\n\nAgain, it had taken Dream forever to respond, even though George had seen that he was online. The same three dots popped up and vanished. George had been about to shut his phone off in frustration when he saw Dream\u2019s message.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: just be yourself\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: that\u2019s terrible advice\n\n\ndreamwastaken: then go ask someone else.\n\n\nHis message had been uncharacteristically snappy, and again, George found himself wondering what he had done wrong. There must have been something he said, or something he did wrong.\u00a0\n\n\nBut also, George reasoned, it could just be stress from school, or a frustrating project that he was working on, or an argument with his parents. Dream tended to have family arguments come up often, and he was always in an odd mood after them. George was probably assuming the worst. He considered asking Dream about it, but if Dream wasn\u2019t feeling up to sharing, George didn\u2019t want to pressure him.\n\n\nHe looked back at their recent messages and decided to shut his phone off. Dream would come to him when he was ready; he always did. George needed to focus on other things, like his homework and social life, and everything would even itself out soon.\n\n\nUpon waking up for the next morning at school, George found himself added into a groupchat between Clay and Sapnap. The first message was from Sapnap, who mentioned a movie that he wanted to see that weekend, and asked if Clay and George would come with him. George looked at the text and facepalmed. Sapnap was as far from subtle as he could get.\n\n\nThe next message was from Clay, and it said sure. what time?\n\n\nSapnap and Clay had debated times back and forth for a bit and then eventually settled on that night, eight thirty. George sighed and realized that Sapnap was going to make George go through with this no matter what.\u00a0\n\n\nSo he sent back, sounds great. that works for me :)\n\n\nThe next thing he did was check his messages with Dream, who hadn\u2019t responded. George frowned and sent him a quick message.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: good morning! just checking in to see if you\u2019re ok &lt;3\n\n\nHe shut his phone off; Dream hadn\u2019t been online for seven hours, and he was probably still sleeping. George didn\u2019t know the exact time of Dream\u2019s school schedule, but he figured it was pretty similar to his. After all, most public schools started around seven and ended around two, that was probably what Dream\u2019s classes were like as well.\u00a0\n\n\nLunchtime arrived, and to his great pleasure, George saw that Dream had sent him a message. On the drive to Chipotle (pizza had been vetoed by nearly everyone in the group except for him and Clay, which should be a crime against humanity) George read it.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i\u2019m good, there\u2019s just been a lot going on recently\n\n\ndreamwastaken: thank you, i love u :(\n\n\nIt made George smile Dream always made him smile, regardless of where he was or what he was doing. And recently, Dream had been extra\u2014 well, George wasn\u2019t sure what the word for it was, but Dream had been saying nice things recently. More of his texts recently had read i love u or had that little heart emoticon George loved seeing. It made George feel fluttery and warm on the inside, like he was a cat sprawled out in a patch of sunlight.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge ate his chips and guac and considered texting something back, but decided to leave it until after school. He wanted advice from Dream on what to do during a date (George was hopelessly awful at pretty much everything), and would probably ask later in the day. He didn\u2019t want to add any additional stress onto whatever Dream was going through, but George still really valued his thoughts and opinions if Dream was open to sharing them.\u00a0\n\n\nHe turned his phone off and set it to the side; he had just realized that the conversation topic had switched completely in the few seconds he was on his phone. Now they were talking about the pros and cons to watching Parks and Rec versus Brooklyn 99. George, who had seen both of them and had a clear favorite, staunchly supported Parks and Rec.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore long, it was time for them to leave again. The rest of the school day passed quickly, with nothing of importance to note, but George\u2019s stomach swarmed with anxiety about the upcoming movie that night. He didn\u2019t know what Sapnap had planned as wingman, but George was going to lose it if it was something embarrassing.\n\n\nFortunately, George realized exactly what Sapnap had planned, ten minutes after school ended. Both Clay and Sapnap were talking by George\u2019s locker when he arrived, and George slid his backpack off his shoulders with a thud. He spun his combination into the lock, swung it open, and then paused.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap dramatically checked his phone, and then looked back up at Clay and George.\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d he said, sounding not entirely upset at all. \u201cI suddenly won\u2019t be able to go to the movie tonight. I forgot I have a family dinner to be at.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe can put it off another day,\u201d Clay started, but Sapnap cut him off.\n\n\n\u201cI bought the tickets online, they\u2019re already paid for. You two should just go by yourself.\u201d\n\n\nClay looked to George, who gave him a half shrug that he hoped didn\u2019t come off as too eager or desperate. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d George said. Just two friends going to see a movie together. That was totally cool. That was something normal American kids did, right?\n\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIt\u2019s within walking distance, so I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d George said. Sapnap gave him a thumbs up in the background. \u201cEight thirty?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEight thirty,\u201d Clay confirmed.\u00a0\n\n\nThe second Clay was out of earshot, George turned to Sapnap and accused, \u201cYou\u2019re lying about the family dinner.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sapnap said, with a bright smile. \u201cBut now you get to go see a movie all alone with your crush, so don\u2019t you dare complain.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shoved him. \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your favorite,\u201d Sapnap said, unconcerned. \u201cOkay. Now let\u2019s go through every possible way for you to get with him tonight.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d George said, feeling his cheeks flame. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to do that. It\u2019ll just be a quiet, normal movie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClay and George sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Sapnap,\u201d George said, and determinedly refused to think about it.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge stared in the mirror and tried not to feel nervous.\n\n\nWell, he wasn\u2019t exactly nervous\u2014 nervousness for him came with a sinking feeling of anxiety, as if the day was going to be awful. The feeling writhing in his stomach was lighter, more friendly\u2014 George thought it was anticipation. He had a good feeling about this night. George thought that it was going to go well.\n\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t want to get his expectations up, and then dash them when things didn\u2019t go according to plan. He texted Dream with jittery fingers.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: dream im so nervous i think i\u2019m going on a date tonight\n\n\nDream\u2019s response was much faster than usual.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: good luck!\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: what if we kiss\n\n\ndreamwastaken: then u kiss him back\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: wskjgjkwkjsghk\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: im so nervous. i hope it goes well\n\n\nAnother few minutes, and then:\n\n\ndreamwastaken: im sure it will :)\n\n\nReluctantly, George smiled and shut his phone off. It was bad taste to be on your phone during a date\u2014 even if Clay and him weren\u2019t on a date. Just two boys going to the movies together. Just two boys going to the movies together as purely platonic friends.\u00a0\n\n\nThe likelihood of Clay feeling the same towards him was slim to none. Still, George could hope. He reminded himself to set his expectations low\u2014 low expectations meant that anything exceeded them, and he would never be disappointed if things went badly.\u00a0\n\n\nHe looked in the mirror again and took a deep, steadying breath. George was just wearing dark jeans and a plain shirt, since no one wore anything fancy to the movie theatre; thankfully, it was cooler than usual outside, in the high fifties (or fifteen degrees in Celsius, as George thought of it).\u00a0\n\n\nHe made it to the theatre fifteen minutes early, even though that was almost too early for a movie, especially with trailers beforehand. To his surprise, though, Clay was already there. on a bench outside. He was texting someone when George first saw him, but slipped his phone away as soon as George greeted him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d George said, as he approached. \u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Clay said in response. \u201cI hate being late to things.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge nodded in agreement; he and Clay were pretty similar in a lot of ways, and wanting to be on time was one of them. It was funny, because both of them were horrible at being early to things. George couldn\u2019t think of a single time where they had both been on time to something.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d Clay gestured, and George followed. The ticket attendant scanned them through, and they had a small, friendly discussion about what to get. George hesitantly brought up buying just one large tub of popcorn for \u201csaving money purposes\u201d and Clay readily agreed. Their conversation was nice, flowing easily from topic to topic, but it felt oddly surface level. It almost felt as if Clay was holding himself back in some way, like he wasn\u2019t letting himself invest fully in the conversation. For some reason, it reminded George of Dream when they had first begun to talk.\u00a0\n\n\nIt confused George; once George really got to know someone, he was really open about his interests and passions, and loud about how important they were to him. On the other hand, Clay was more restrained and quiet, and definitely seemed distracted. More than once, he looked at his phone, which made George\u2019s heart sink slightly. No one checked their phone on a date unless they didn\u2019t like their date.\n\n\nGeorge tried to stop himself from reading into everything. Maybe Clay had an important conversation with someone, maybe he had a parent to respond to\u2014 there were a dozen explanations that weren\u2019t any of George\u2019s business. Still, it made him feel worse.\u00a0\n\n\nThe movie started after around ten trailers for movies, and George settled the popcorn bucket in between them. His heart pounded unreasonably fast. He did his best not to look over at Clay, and just act normal.\n\n\nSapnap had chosen some cheesy action movie, filled with expensive CGI and dramatic shots of car chases. George wasn\u2019t following the plot at all, more distracted with Clay next to him. He felt incredibly hot and swallowed more popcorn to try and ignore the feeling. It didn\u2019t quite work.\u00a0\n\n\nTo his dismay, nothing really happened for the first thirty minutes. Their hands didn\u2019t meet while reaching for popcorn at the same time. Clay didn\u2019t yawn and stretch his arm to put around George. For all their polite, friendly conversation earlier, he was now distant and closed off.\u00a0\n\n\nThen halfway through the movie, Clay turned to him and whispered, \u201cThis is such a bad movie. Why did Sapnap choose this?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d George whispered back. \u201cDo you actually care about this?\u201d\n\n\nClay laughed. \u201cHell no. I\u2019m not even a movie person, to be honest.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave,\u201d George said, feeling bold all of a sudden. \u201cGo somewhere and just talk.\u201d\n\n\nClay turned and appraised him for a moment. \u201cGo where?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe park?\u201d George offered.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fenced off after ten,\u201d Clay said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe can hop it,\u201d George said.\u00a0\n\n\nClay looked at him again, and then grinned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t strike me as a rule breaker.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe you just don\u2019t know me well enough,\u201d George said. Clay raised an eyebrow, barely visible in the dark theatre, and George felt emboldened. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\nClay stood up and offered George his hand, and when George took it, tugged him out of the theatre. They hit the hallway and blinked at the bright lights. Quickly, George realized he was still holding Clay\u2019s hand, and dropped it. Clay pulled his phone out and typed out another text, then twisted his lips and put it away.\u00a0\n\n\nThe walk to the park was silent, but not uncomfortably so. It was almost ten thirty, late enough that there were no cars on the street and no people on the sidewalks. One of the perks of living in the suburbs was that Friday nights were quiet, versus loud when you were living in a city.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge looked at the simple chain-link fence surrounding the park, then took a deep breath and began climbing. Clay stared at him for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cThis is a terrible idea,\u201d he huffed, but clambered to reach the top of the fence with George. George offered him a hand, and Clay took it, warm and sturdy. He pulled Clay up to the top and they sat there for a moment, looking at the darkened park below them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSometimes bad ideas are the best,\u201d George said. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve had many of them in my life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Clay said. \u201cAnd how many of those have turned out good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVery few,\u201d George laughed. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been pretty terrible.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge looked down at the drop, as if calculating how far it was, and then let himself fall. He landed with a thud, and reached out for the fence to steady himself. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\nInstead of jumping, Clay clambered down a few feet and then let himself down slowly. The earth was soft beneath his feet, and George reached out with a hand to steady him slightly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow that they were in the park, George looked around blankly. Now what?\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the playground,\u201d Clay said. Clearly, he knew this park better than George did. He started off in the general direction of it, and George matched his pace. \u201cI used to play there all the time as a kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you lived in Florida your whole life?\u201d George asked. Clay nodded.\n\n\n\u201cI was born in Miami, but then I moved to Orlando when I was just a baby. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been out of the state.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne day you should go to Brighton,\u201d George offered. \u201cI think you would like it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Clay said, looking amused. \u201cWith your snow and cold weather?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold all the time,\u201d George said. It was true; Brighton got quite hot in the summers as well. \u201cYou get used to it, especially if you\u2019ve grown up there.\u201d\n\n\nClay hummed, and didn\u2019t say anything in response. The playground appeared in the background; it was lit up by a few yellow street lights, and slightly obscured by mist, but grew clearer as they approached. When they reached it, George reached the monkey bars and clambered up to the top. The metal was slick with condensation below his fingertips, and slightly slippery to hold onto.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on up,\u201d George called. Clay made no move towards it, and George paused for an uncomfortable second. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like heights,\u201d Clay admitted slowly, looking up at the monkey bars as if he were a little queasy.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge blinked. \u201cHeights aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d\n\n\nClay shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 falling. What if you fall?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t fall,\u201d George said. \u201cCome up here and test it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019re fucking with me,\u201d Clay said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming up there.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\n\n\nClay stared, then gritted his teeth and began to climb up to George. He faltered in his steps more than once, but swung his legs up until he was sitting on top of the monkey bars, a few feet away. He looked obviously uncomfortable, and George wanted to make him relax more.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to fall,\u201d George said, and then winced. He shouldn\u2019t say that to someone who was scared of heights. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get up and get down. I do this all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll the time?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d George amended. \u201cYou don\u2019t really have that much time for playing once you grow up.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Clay said. George laughed. \u201cComputer science is kicking my ass right now, I\u2019m so far behind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou code?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning,\u201d Clay said. \u201cSlowly, but still.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d George surprised himself by saying. He usually didn\u2019t tell people he liked coding, or that he wanted to be a programmer when he grew up. None of his friends wanted to do that, back in Brighton, so he had kept it mostly to himself. \u201cI\u2019m learning Java.\u201d\n\n\nClay hummed and nodded. \u201cGood program to learn.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge agreed with him; it was easy, and the more he worked on it in his free time, the better he got at it. He shifted so his legs swung over the side; they were easily fifteen feet up, which wasn\u2019t an impossible drop, but he could understand Clay\u2019s hesitation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Sapnap ditched us,\u201d Clay said. It almost came out of the blue. \u201cHe\u2019s such an asshole sometimes.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge huffed a small laugh. \u201cHe probably would\u2019ve made us watch the entire movie.\u201d\n\n\nClay nodded in agreement, and then his mood dimmed somewhat. His voice was low when he admitted, \u201cI was kind of looking forward to hanging out with him, though.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge suddenly felt quite awkward. \u201cSorry that I\u2019m here instead.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Clay waved a hand in dismissal. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s one of my best friends. We\u2019ve known each other since we were kids, you know? We met in first grade.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat year is first grade?\u201d George asked. He didn\u2019t know the age of American grades versus British grades.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI was five,\u201d Clay said, as if he had to recount the years. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge made the connection in his head\u2014 first grade in America was the same as year two in the UK. \u201cIt must be nice to have a friend like him for so long.\u201d He tried not to feel lonesome; George had never had a friendship last that long. The closest thing he had to that was Dream, who he had been talking to for four years.\n\n\nClay nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s always been my best friend, so it\u2019s a little weird to see the two of you catch on so quickly. I feel like I haven\u2019t had time alone with him in so long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d George said again, feeling a little sick. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstep, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m an introvert, and he pretty much kidnapped me into being his friend. I don\u2019t have control over it at this point.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClay laughed dryly. \u201cI know. You\u2019re not overstepping, honestly, it\u2019s actually nice to have you in the group.\u201d He gave George a smile\u2014 not one of the cocky, self-assured smiles he gave others, but a softer, realer one. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get to know you.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt himself smiling in response. \u201cSame for you. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFriends,\u201d Clay muttered. George\u2019s heart jumped; had he said something wrong? But Clay didn\u2019t look upset, and instead just looked to the sky. This night, the stars were obscured by mist, and could barely be seen through the glare of the street lights. Still, George looked up with him; there was a blinking light crossing through the sky, probably from an airplane. It tracked across the sky, vanished through a cloud, and then reappeared once more.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clay said, breaking the silence, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite colour?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou said we\u2019re friends,\u201d Clay said. \u201cBut how can we be friends if I don\u2019t know your favorite colour?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge laughed. \u201cI\u2019m colorblind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said, \u201cI pretty much only see yellow and blue, so those are my favorite colours.\u201d\n\n\nClay glanced down at the hoodie he was wearing. \u201cSo you can\u2019t see green?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt just looks yellow,\u201d George said, looking at the hoodie. \u201cHonestly, it doesn\u2019t bother me much. Everyone always makes this big deal out of it, but I can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d\n\n\nClay rolled his eyes. \u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite colour?\u201d George asked in return.\n\n\n\u201cGreen,\u201d Clay answered instantly. \u201cAlways has been.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and then Clay broke it again. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d George said thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe mac and cheese, if it\u2019s made well. My mum makes it sometimes, it\u2019s great. You?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPizza,\u201d Clay said, \u201cOr banana pudding, probably.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge smiled. Clay reminded him of Dream sometimes, especially now\u2014 Dream liked banana pudding too, George had teased him about it several times.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Clay said, shifting on the monkey bars so he was sitting more firmly. George didn\u2019t miss how his knuckles went white as he moved, gripping tightly so he didn\u2019t fall. \u201cYou ask a question now.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge hummed and tried to think of something. Finally, he asked, \u201cAre you a cat or dog person?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEasy answer,\u201d Clay said. \u201cCats all the way. I have a cat named Patches.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge nodded. \u201cMe too. Not having a cat part, but I\u2019ve always wanted one.\u201d He looked down and sighed. \u201cI was pretty close to convincing my mom to get one, but then we ended up moving, and it just wasn\u2019t possible anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Clay offered, almost hesitantly, \u201cYou could come over and meet Patches sometime. I think she would like you.\u201d\n\n\nAgainst his will, George\u2019s heart fluttered, and he tried not to smile. This night was going better than he could have possibly imagined, and now Clay had literally invited him over. He tried his best not to be awkward and said, \u201cSomeday, sure.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThere was comfortable, peaceful silence between them for a second, and then Clay checked his phone for the millionth time that night.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s midnight,\u201d he said in surprise.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d George said. They\u2019d been talking for over an hour. He hadn\u2019t realized how quickly the time had passed. \u201cShould we go?\u201d\n\n\nClay grimaced. \u201cProbably. My dad will worry if I\u2019m not back soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge tried not to feel disappointed about the sudden end to his night. It had already exceeded his incredibly low expectations, and he had something to look forward to. He was feeling much more positive about Clay potentially liking him back. He didn\u2019t want to do anything rash to ruin the nice bubble of the night, like confessing stupidly, so instead he stayed quiet. Carefully, he measured the jump down from the monkey bars, and then jumped.\u00a0\n\n\nIt sent jolts up through his legs, but he landed comfortably. He turned to look back up at Clay, who was still sitting there, frozen.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you get down?\u201d Clay said, and tried to laugh to play off his obvious discomfort. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t jump.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge looked at the monkey bars, and the way he had gotten up. \u201cIf you scoot to the end, you can land on the steps down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Clay breathed, and slowly made his way over.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a long drop once you\u2019re there, you can do it.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, Clay lowered himself off, and then hopped the much shorter distance down the ground. He looked back up at the monkey bars and shuddered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPretend I\u2019m not afraid of heights,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins my whole \u201ccool kid\u201d aesthetic.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge smiled reluctantly. \u201cI think it makes you more real.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReal?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said. \u201cSometimes I feel like you\u2019re so good at everything that you can\u2019t possibly be real.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGood at everything?\u201d Clay said, his tone almost teasing, like he was inviting George to continue.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMath, coding, making friends\u2026\u201d George said, though there were many more examples he wouldn\u2019t dare say out loud. He felt his cheeks go hot and thanked God that it was too dark to see if he was blushing or not. \u201cAll of that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Clay said, and his tone was definitely teasing now, and if George didn\u2019t know better, he would say it sounded flirty. \u201cMaking friends?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh, sure,\u201d George said, awkward and clumsy, and instantly, the mood changed. Clay retreated slightly, and George felt a sickening feeling as he realized that Clay had just gone back to the closed off, detached person he had been at the beginning of the night. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe should go,\u201d Clay said abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d George stammered. George didn\u2019t know what had changed, or what he had done to make Clay retreat like that. The sickening feeling in his stomach only grew. \u201cLet\u2019s head out.\u201d\n\n\nThe fence was easier to hop this time around, and clinked in the darkness as they clambered over unsteadily. As they walked back, the suburban streets were quiet, enough that they ended up walking along the dotted white line in the center. The air was soft and misty, but not rainy, and streetlights cut through it in waves of yellow. Before long, Clay and George approached the turn off for George\u2019s house. He was disheartened in more ways than one. It was peacefully quiet; he didn\u2019t want to lose that.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d George said.\n\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d Clay said. It almost sounded regretful\u2014 if George didn\u2019t know better, he would say disappointed. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nWithout another word, they continued their separate ways. George kept walking, and his mind replayed the events of the night over and over. Despite the lack of\u2014 well, anything romantic, except for that last conversation in the park\u2014 it had gone surprisingly well. Out of habit, George checked his phone, and realized he had a few missed texts from Dream.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: are you done with your date yet\n\n\n\nsent: over an hour ago\n\n\n\ndreamwastaken: george its been forever\u00a0\n\n\n\nsent: seventeen minutes ago\n\n\n\ndreamwastaken: if u blow me off\u2026 i swear.. i am accepting new best friend applications\n\n\n\nsent: three minutes ago\n\n\n\nGeorge smiled down at his phone and tapped out a quick response.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: you are so needy. the absolute worst\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i know you\u2019re lying you love me\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: \u2026. i can leave\n\n\ndreamwastaken: no come on im joking :(\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i\u2019m aware &lt;3\n\n\ndreamwastaken: doing anything rn\n\n\ndreamwastaken: besides ur date haha\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i might get on minecraft tbh. do you wanna try that plugin from forever ago?\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yes of course i\u2019ll get on in a few minutes\n\n\nGeorge unlocked the door to his house and immediately headed upstairs, ignoring his mum watching some soap opera in the background. He booted up Minecraft and could already hear his computer overheating\u2014 he really should begin investing in getting a new one.\u00a0\n\n\nStill, as Dream entered the server and immediately started playing, George couldn\u2019t help but think of Clay. For some reason he wished that Clay was playing Minecraft with him, though that felt weird to think. He really liked Clay, always wanted to be with him, and that made George\u2019s stomach do uncomfortable turns in his gut.\n\n\nDream had always been enough for him. So why did George suddenly feel like he wasn\u2019t?\n\n\n George, as it turned out, was not prepared for Halloween.\n\n\n Halloween in Britain was not a big thing. He had heard about it, of course, and the length some people went to, but it was always a back-of-the-mind thing. Rarely anyone went trick-or-treating where he lived, and no one dressed up in elaborate costumes. America, however, did not function like that.\u00a0\n\n\nThe entire school, seemingly overnight, was decked out in what seemed to be orange and black decorations, even though it was just yellow for George. Streamers were draped over everyone\u2019s lockers, and bulletin boards were filled with pumpkin stickers and bats. Festive autumn leaves were scattered throughout the hallways. Classroom doorways were plastered with signs that read \u201ctrick or treat\u201d or \u201cHappy Halloween\u201d. Even fake candles were lit up and down the hallways, complete with fake cobwebs and plastic spiders dangling from them.\n\n\nThere were still a few days until the actual holiday, George thought, tearing strings of cobweb off his locker irritably so he could open it. Why was the entire school overreacting now?\n\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d Bad said, approaching from behind him. \u201cWhy the bad mood?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a bad mood,\u201d George said, \u201cThese stupid decorations are everywhere.\u201d\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t entirely true\u2014 he was in somewhat of a bad mood. Even after that night talking with Clay, nothing more had happened between them. They hadn\u2019t texted, hadn\u2019t hung out together, and George was more and more confused by the day. He knew that immediately getting together was unrealistic, but a tiny part of him had secretly hoped that things would be that easy.\n\n\nAnd Dream had been oddly silent the past few weeks: interacting with George less, offline more and more, and although George didn\u2019t want to admit it, he desperately missed him. He had always relied on Dream to talk through things, and seeing Dream draw away was painful.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just not in the Halloween spirit,\u201d Bad said, drawing him out of his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to our party, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cParty?\u201d\n\n\nBad\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about our Halloween party?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d George said, and felt something sick rise in his stomach. He tried to push it down; it was understandable that there were things he had been excluded from. Everyone had closer friends and better people to be with. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday,\u201d Bad said, completely oblivious to George\u2019s inner workings. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not much of a party person,\u201d George said. \n\n\nBad beamed. \u201cGood, because by party we actually mean go trick or treating for six hours, steal a ton of candy from children, and then eat it all while watching horror movies. And you\u2019re definitely coming.\u201d\n\n\nThe pit of anxiety in George\u2019s stomach began to dissolve slightly. Carefully, he confessed, \u201cI\u2019ve never gone trick or treating,\u201d and watched as Bad gaped.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIs Halloween not a thing in Britain?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d George said, \u201cI know all about it, of course, but I\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d he gestured with a hand, \u201cDone any of this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing out,\u201d Bad declared. \u201cHalloween is the most fun time of the year! It\u2019s my favorite day, personally.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said, and gestured. \u201cLike this is fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a downer,\u201d Bad said, but his voice was tinged with amusement. \u201cHave you decided on a costume?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where I would go to get a costume,\u201d George said, \u201cSo no.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou and I are going costume shopping tomorrow, then,\u201d Bad promised. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d George said, and Bad rolled his eyes and laughed.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other thing about Halloween was that a booth by the leadership classroom had opened up, complete with paper cutouts of bats and owls and pumpkins. George walked by it every day on his way to Spanish, and after staring at it in confusion for a few days, finally caved and asked Ponk what it was for.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCandy grams,\u201d Ponk said, like it was obvious. \u201cLakeside High does this at every holiday, Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, you name it. It\u2019s just a little message you can send to people.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSeems dumb,\u201d George said vaguely.\u00a0\n\n\nPonk waved a hand. \u201cYeah. You can send them anonymously too, all of that, it\u2019s just two dollars. It\u2019s some fundraising thing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes everyone send them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBad sends them out to all of us,\u201d Ponk said. \u201cNo one else in our group does, but practically the entire school sends them. You\u2019ll see. It\u2019s even worse at Christmas.\u201d\n\n\nOh, God. If this was how the school reacted for Halloween, he could hardly wait to see how they acted around Christmastime. \n\n\nGeorge considered the booth for a moment and the miniature candy grams on it. Would it be worth it to write one?\n\n\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d he muttered, and dug two dollars out of his pocket. What was the harm, anyway? You could send them anonymously, after all, and maybe he would get lucky and get one in return. \n\n\nHe sat there for a moment, trying to figure out what to say, before carefully writing it down in his nicest handwriting. It looked completely different from his usual messy scrawl, which was good, because George didn't want to be completely embarrassed. He handed the message back to the person manning the booth. She smiled and put it on the stack of candy grams, set to be delivered on the last school day before Halloween\u2014 the thirtieth of October.\u00a0\n\n\nThe rest of the school day passed in absolute boredom. In math, Clay and George had paired again for in-class assignments. George was certainly much better at precalculus now that Clay was helping him with it. They didn\u2019t mention that night in the park, and George didn\u2019t bring it up. Instead, things had gone back to the way they were before\u2014 polite, cool, and somewhat distant. It scratched at the back of George\u2019s mind uncomfortably. He wanted to change it, but he didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nLunch passed as usual, then computer science, and then Spanish, and then he was heading home, with tentative plans to go costume shopping with Bad the next day. Despite the negative start to the day, it was actually looking up.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore he knew it, Friday morning was upon them. It was the thirtieth of October, one day before Halloween. For some reason Lakeside High School didn\u2019t allow costumes unless it was actually the thirty-first (which George had heard both Clay and Sapnap complain at long about), but the hallways positively buzzed with excitement.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge actually felt somewhat excited as well. Most of his bad mood had melted away after talking with Dream until one AM the night before, and the incessant enthusiasm about Halloween had put him in more of a holiday mood. He went to his locker first, unlocking it to dump a textbook in, and then was promptly surrounded by the entire friend group.\n\n\nAlyssa rubbed her hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s almost Halloween!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s on a Saturday,\u201d Sapnap gloated. \u201cThe best day for Halloween.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI still haven\u2019t picked out my costume,\u201d Skeppy mourned. \u201cIt all depends on this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d George asked curiously.\n\n\n\u201cWhoever gets a higher grade on our English test picks the costume for us,\u201d Bad cut in. \u201cI\u2019ve got it in the bag. Skeppy, your costume is going to be incredible.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think Skeppy might have gotten a higher grade,\u201d Ponk said amiably.\n\n\n\u201cI studied all week for it,\u201d Skeppy declared. \u201cI know I\u2019m winning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll find out right after lunch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of lunch\u2014\u201d\n\n\nA chorus of groans echoed from the group. \u201cCandy grams.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d Bad exclaimed. \u201cI bought one for all of you guys, it\u2019ll be so fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI hate candy grams,\u201d Alyssa said despondently. \u201cStupid popularity contest.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge frowned. \u201cI thought they were just for fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey are just for fun,\u201d Ponk explained, \u201cBut they also get passed out right before lunch, and everyone who gets them brags about it. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of paper and a Halloween candy, right?\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa exchanged wry glances with Ponk. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very ominous,\u201d George said dryly, and slammed his locker closed.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore he knew it, fourth period rolled around: precalculus, with Clay. Clay flashed George a grin as he entered the classroom and took his seat. George returned it, and settled back in his seat.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo minutes in, the candy grams struck.\u00a0\n\n\nThe teacher sighed and allowed the teacher\u2019s assistant in to deliver them. There were a few given to a girl in the front row, and two given to a boy in the back of the room, and then surprisingly, two for George. He didn\u2019t look at them yet but put them in the mesh pocket of his backpack for later.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir teacher resumed the lecture, got as far as ten minutes in, before they were interrupted again. By the end of the class, to George\u2019s extreme surprise, he had actually gotten seven candy grams, which was six more than he expected. Most of them were cute notes scrawled in glittery gel pen from girls around the school, and, flustered, George put those away as soon as possible. The last one was clearly from Bad\u2014 George remembered Bad saying that he had given candy grams to all of his friends.\n\n\nClay, on the other hand, had been positively flooded with candy grams. It didn\u2019t help that George was sitting right next to him, too\u2014 their precalculus class was constantly disrupted with different TA\u2019s coming in to gift candy grams to Clay. Every time it happened, the poor deliverer had to squeeze all the way down the desk row to drop them on Clay\u2019s desk. George wasn\u2019t sure how anyone was supposed to get work done with the classroom constantly being interrupted.\n\n\n\u201cIf you get any more of those, I\u2019m going to make you sit in the hallway,\u201d their teacher had threatened. Clay gave an award-winning grin and held up both hands as if to say, can\u2019t help it.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge tried to ignore the envious looks directed towards Clay from almost every other person in the room. Clay sighed audibly as he packed up his backpack, and then took another gaze at the mess of candy on his desk and scowled.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHold these for me,\u201d Clay said, and dumped about a dozen candy grams into George\u2019s arms. \u201cI hate these, I always get so many.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMust suck,\u201d George said. He didn\u2019t even realize how sarcastic he sounded until Clay rolled his eyes and laughed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just all from people I don\u2019t even talk to. It\u2019s just annoying to get these and then have people expect something in return. Like\u2014\u201d he plucked a random one from George\u2019s hands, and opened it, \u201cI don\u2019t even know who Lucy is. I couldn\u2019t pick her out of a lineup. So why did she send me one?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause she likes you,\u201d George said reasonably. \u201cObviously.\u201d\n\n\nClay sighed, ripped the paper note off, and tossed it in the recycling. He reached for another candy gram and did the same. \u201cMakes no sense, but sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot even going to read them?\u201d George said. Clay paused.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Clay said. \u201cThere\u2019s too many.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d George said, and watched forlornly as whatever candy gram he had sent to Clay in stupid, teenager hopefulness disappeared under a wave of similar, boring, unimportant messages.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCatch,\u201d Clay said. George stuck his hand out, and somehow perfectly caught the piece of candy Clay had tossed him.\n\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d George said, wrinkling his nose. He flicked the candy back at him. \u201cI hate Snickers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite, then?\u201d Clay gestured to the mess of candy on his desk. \u201cTake as many as you like, I can\u2019t possibly eat them all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReese\u2019s,\u201d George said, and unwrapped one from the pile. \u201cChocolate and peanut butter? Perfect.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSnickers are chocolate and peanut,\u201d Clay pointed out.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but the texture is all off,\u201d George argued. \u201cPlus the caramel ruins it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClay shrugged. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t like Almond Joys, we can still be friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood thing we\u2019re still friends,\u201d George said, and ignored how his heart twisted at the words.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Clay said, and beckoned. \u201cEveryone\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge nodded quickly, shouldered his backpack, and followed him. \n\n\nIt was true, what Alyssa had said about the candy grams being a popularity contest; everywhere he went, he saw people flicking through the messages people had written to them. People gathered in tiny clusters in the hallways, laughing and talking, and slowly, George began to leech off of them. He was excited\u2014 tomorrow was going to go well. He just knew it. \n\n\nGeorge and Clay slung their backpacks off at the lunch table, and Skeppy shuffled over to give them a place to sit. \n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Ponk said, looking at Clay. \u201cHow many did you get?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEnough to share.\u201d Clay tossed a chocolate bar at the back of Sapnap\u2019s head, who winced and scowled in Clay\u2019s direction. \u201cEat up, everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d Alyssa sighed, and swiped a Kit-Kat from the mess in the middle of their lunch table. As everyone divided up the spoils of war, Clay methodically tore off the messages attached to them until they were all balled up for the recycling. \n\n\n\u201cSave all the peanut butter cups for George,\u201d Clay said offhandedly, \u201cThey\u2019re his favorite.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge flushed and looked down. Sapnap kicked him under the table and George kicked back. \n\n\nEveryone seemed giddy and excited, talking over Halloween and their costumes and their plans for trick-or-treating and most of all, how much candy they were going to buy the next day when it was half-off. Before he knew it, the warning bell had rung. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to head to physics,\u201d Clay said, and pushed himself up from the table. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys all after school.\u201d\n\n\nThere was a chorus of goodbyes, and then Clay vanished into the crowd of students. A few heads turned as he passed, but Clay took no note of them. George watched him walk away and then turned back to the table.\n\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t seem too bad,\u201d George said thoughtfully. \u201cThe whole candy grams thing. You really made it sound ominous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just because Clay is the nicest person to walk the planet,\u201d Bad said affectionately. \u201cHe would never brag about things like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Sapnap said dryly. \n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bad insisted. \u201cAt least, not while I\u2019m around.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou need to hang out with Clay more,\u201d Sapnap laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s such an asshole.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you said that,\u201d Alyssa said, half seriously. \n\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Sapnap challenged. \u201cHe\u2019ll just say it back.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou guys are so dumb,\u201d Ponk sighed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re all going to be late if you don\u2019t hurry up.\u201d \n\n\nGeorge looked at the time and blanched; the warning bell had rung nearly four minutes ago, and he was certainly going to be late to computer science, which was halfway across school. Hurriedly, he packed up his backpack and waved goodbye to everyone; he would see them all tomorrow night regardless. \n\n\nAfter school ended, George began his slow walk home. Sapnap joined him for the first few blocks as they left campus. They talked for a bit about Halloween; Sapnap still hadn\u2019t decided on his costume, even though Halloween was tomorrow. George\u2019s costume was a secret\u2014 he had picked it out with Bad a few days ago, flicking through the racks of costumes at Party City downtown.\n\n\n\u201cThat was nice,\u201d he said offhandedly.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClay at lunch,\u201d Sapnap said, with a devilish grin. \u201cYou two seem to be getting along well.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd you never told me about your movie date,\u201d Sapnap said excitedly. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cClay probably told you already,\u201d George said. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe told me you guys ditched the movie,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cWhich first, rude, but second, what happened after?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d George said, \u201cWe went to the park. It was nice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Sapnap teased.\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d George said, \u201cIf something had happened, you would know about it.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Sapnap said skeptically.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d George insisted. \u201cAnd nothing did happen. We sat and talked for a few hours and then went home.\u201d \n\n\nSapnap nodded approvingly. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start. Maybe I should trick you two into being alone together again.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so bad at this,\u201d George mumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst wingman in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Sapnap said affectionately. \u201cI\u2019m helping you out here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said skeptically, and Sapnap laughed.\n\n\nThey reached the turn off for George\u2019s street, and George waved a goodbye to Sapnap and turned down. Sapnap called after him:\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming tomorrow, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d George called back.\n\n\n\u201cYou promise?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI promise!\u201d\n\n\nSapnap flashed him a bright smile, visible even from that distance. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d He tapped two fingers to his temple in a sarcastic salute, and then vanished from eyesight. \n\n\nGeorge thought about Dream yet again. He wondered if Dream was doing anything for Halloween, or if he was planning to sit at home and pass candy out. He suddenly realized that he hadn\u2019t talked much to Dream in the past week; he had spent so much time talking with Clay, Sapnap, and everyone else that he had barely texted Dream much at all. George felt guilty about it; he loved his friends at school, but far more than that, he loved Dream. In the spur of the moment, George texted him:\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: this is sappy but you\u2019re my best friend and im glad you are\n\n\nGeorge worried that he would ignore it; Dream had been more distant lately, upset over something that he wouldn't talk about or hint at, and George didn\u2019t know if he was in the mood to talk. But it only took a few seconds for Dream to reply.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: thanks, i really appreciate that\n\n\ndreamwastaken: its been a rough week lmao\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: hopefully i can make it better\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: minecraft?\n\n\ndreamwastaken: okay :) \n\n\nGeorge hurried his step and unlocked his front door; if Dream was already on their server, he didn\u2019t want to miss a single minute of it. His phone buzzed again, and George read it:\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i\u2019ve kinda missed this\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: me too\n\n\nHe saw Dream typing something, the three dots rising and falling, until he stopped typing altogether. George waited for the message to come through, but it never did.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge booted up Minecraft, closed his bedroom door, and settled into his desk chair. He would spend tonight with Dream, and tomorrow with Clay and the rest of his friends. \n\n\nIt was going to go great. George would make sure of it. \n\n\nThe next day, George awoke to two different messages. One was from Dream, and George read it quickly and responded:\n\n\ndreamwastaken: happy halloween best friend\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: also good morning! hope u slept lots\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i slept ten hours so i won\u2019t be tired for next week, im getting all my sleep in now\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: and happy halloween too!!\u00a0\n\n\nThe next message was a group text that he had just been added to a few hours earlier: Ponk was reminding them all that they were meeting in front of his house at seven, and they should bring some sort of bag for when they go trick-or-treating. Skeppy added that they should bring pillowcases; they were planning to go through the expensive area of the suburbs, where all the old, rich people gave out full candy bars by the handful.\u00a0\n\n\nBad texted as well: and bring pajamas too, we\u2019re having a sleepover!\u00a0\n\n\nDid people still have sleepovers in high school? George had assumed they were just a childish thing, but apparently not. \n\n\nHe ended up walking to Ponk\u2019s house as the night arrived. It wasn\u2019t far, just a few blocks away, and there was still sunlight at seven PM. Enough of it shone through the scattered clouds to make the entire neighborhood golden. \n\n\nNearly all of the houses were decorated, too, speckled with yellowish ghosts or black giant spiders. One house had set up fake gravestones over their front lawn, complete with skeletal hands reaching up out of the ground. Another house had a massive black cauldron in front, filled with fog that poured down the sides.\n\n\nAlready, there were dozens of kids walking around too, clutching onto their parents\u2019 hands excitedly. They were all dressed up as tiny pumpkins or bats or owls\u2014 there was one in a tiny princess costume, and another dressed as a mini elephant\u2014 each going up and knocking on doors, demanding candy.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge hurried his step; he was supposed to have been at Ponk\u2019s five minutes ago, and he hated being late. He was sure he would be the latest; he had been staring at all the decorations on his way. When he arrived, though, he found that he wasn\u2019t the last person there. Everyone was sitting on the stairs to Ponk\u2019s porch, and George waved shyly as he approached.\n\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d Alyssa exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d George said, and looked to Ponk. \u201cI brought pajamas, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, you can leave them inside\u2014\u201d Ponk gestured to the front porch\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ll come back here after we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\nQuickly, George opened the front door and looked inside\u2014 there was a wide sofa near the front that seemed to have everyone\u2019s clothes laid out there. He dropped his stuff off and came back outside. Still, Clay and Sapnap hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and they were the only two people missing.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge took in everyone\u2019s costumes, caught sight of Bad, and laughed. Both Skeppy and Bad were in bright yellow duck onesies. He mimicked taking a picture of them, and Bad pulled the hood of his onesie down over his face and grumbled.\n\n\n\u201cI was going to be a devil,\u201d he said, downcast. \u201cI was so close, too! I lost the bet by one point.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think you look great,\u201d Skeppy said cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re in matching costumes!\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa, standing next to Ponk, smiled. She was dressed in black and yellow stripes, and had a headband with two dangly pom poms on it. On her back was a tiny pair of yellow wings. \u201cI like the ducks. They\u2019re cute.\u201d\n\n\nPonk nodded along in agreement; he was in a cheap suit, with the shirt underneath halfway unbuttoned to show a Superman logo. His hair was slicked back and he had a pair of glasses on his nose\u2014 clearly, Clark Kent.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge wasn\u2019t too sure about his costume, but after nearly an hour of flicking through costumes with Bad had convinced him. He was in a blue astronaut jumpsuit, with NASA printed in red and white across his chest. The belted part was silver and reflective, and Bad had convinced him to buy a pair of white \u201cclout goggles\u201d to go along with it. George thought they looked stupid, but Bad was so enthusiastic that he didn\u2019t really mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting on Sapnap and Clay,\u201d Ponk said, and sat down on the front porch. \u201cThey take forever, I bet they\u2019re fighting over each other\u2019s costumes.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNah, they probably just don\u2019t have costumes and are trying to come up with something last minute,\u201d Alyssa said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cProbably a mix of both,\u201d George said, and everyone laughed.\u00a0\n\n\nIt took another five minutes for Clay and Sapnap to arrive, and George could hear their bickering from all the way down the street. Neither of them seemed to be in a costume, and Alyssa shot a smug glance at Ponk, that seemed to say told you.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge frowned as Sapnap came closer. \u201cWhat are you dressed up as?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an e-boy,\u201d Sapnap said, and pointed to his shoes. \u201cSee? Checkered vans.\u201d\n\n\nClay rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the dumbest costume I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u2019 Sapnap countered. \u201cThen what\u2019s your costume?\u201d\n\n\nClay pointed to the tiny halo on his head. \u201cAn angel.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d Sapnap said, clearly not impressed. \u201cHow could I have gotten that wrong?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Clay said, acting supremely unaffected. \u201cMust be how stupid you are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am not stupid,\u201d Sapnap said indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d Ponk butted in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Palm Hills, the richest neighborhood in Orlando. Everyone who lives there is ridiculously stacked and gives out the best candy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this old rich couple who lives there,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cThey give out three full-size candy bars. To everyone.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d George said, not having any basis on how much candy people gave out. \u201cCool.\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa shoulder-checked him. \u201cYou\u2019ll see when we go,\u201d she assured. \u201cThis is going to be the best Halloween ever.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge grinned; there were moments when he was incredibly grateful that he had made such amazing friends, and this was one of them.\u00a0\n\n\nThe hike to Palm Hills was around twenty minutes long, but the time passed by like the wind. On the way, they stopped at every single house to ring the doorbell and demand trick-or-treat. The first house, George was almost too nervous to go up on his own, but by the tenth, George had no qualms about asking for candy from complete strangers.\u00a0\n\n\nEverywhere they went, adults opened the doors and passed out dozens of candies. George\u2019s pillowcase was nearly halfway full only an hour into trick-or-treating. He and Ponk made a game out of finding the worst possible costume (George was staunch on someone who had painted their body to look like the Kool-Aid man, while Ponk was insistent that an adult dressed as a sexy minion was worse).\u00a0\n\n\nMore than one adult asked why there were a bunch of teenagers out trick-or-treating when it was supposed to be a kid\u2019s holiday. Still, Clay assured him that all teenagers got judged for going trick-or-treating past age 13, and the important thing was to just not care about it. Halloween was supposed to be a fun holiday, and there was no age limit on having fun.\n\n\nBefore he knew it, the sun had dipped low in the sky, and the moon had risen until it was nearly directly overhead. The streets were almost empty by then, illuminated with spooky Halloween decorations. Their pillowcases were filled to the brim with candy, and on the walk back to Ponk\u2019s house, everyone started trading their candies with one another. Voices rang out:\n\n\n\u201cDoes anyone want my Three Musketeers?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOoh, Skeppy, I\u2019ll trade you for three peanut butter cups.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo one wants your Almond Joys, Clay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you two Snickers for one king size Kit-Kat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Bad said, rummaging through his bag and passing it over. Tentatively, George joined in with the discussion. He wasn\u2019t a sweets person in particular, but if people wanted something, George was happy to give it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d Clay said, looking through his bag, \u201cDo you have any M&amp;Ms?\u201d\n\n\nWithout a second thought, George passed them over. Clay gave him a small smile. George felt his heart skip a beat in his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you want anything in return?\u201d Clay asked, and then as if answering his own question, dropped two peanut butter cups in George\u2019s bag.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George mumbled. He thanked God that it was too dark for anyone to see him blush.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore long they arrived back at Ponk\u2019s house. At this point, most of the lights in houses were off, and the only people who were still out were teenagers, the same age as them. Most of the little kids had probably gone to sleep at that point.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Skeppy said, clapping his hands together as soon as they went inside. \u201cEveryone better have brought pajamas, because we\u2019re pulling an all-nighter here.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe group slowly broke up into chunks\u2014 Skeppy and Bad immediately headed down the hall with pillowcases full of candy, Alyssa disappeared into a side bathroom, and Ponk headed to what George assumed was the kitchen.\u00a0\n\n\nQuickly, George asked where a bathroom was for him to change. Ponk gestured down the hall and George closed one of the doors behind him. Hastily, he changed into a comfortable pair of sweatpants and a sleep shirt. He quite liked his NASA jumpsuit, but it wasn\u2019t comfortable enough to sit and watch a movie in; so he folded it up and dropped it back in the front where his pajamas had been. When he emerged back to the living room, everyone else had changed into pajamas too. Skeppy and Bad were still in their duck onesies (presumably incredibly comfortable), and Alyssa had her own Cookie Monster onesie that was bright blue.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge took one of the free spots on the sofa, which was only occupied by Sapnap. Everyone had made a big pile of candy in the center of the floor, and Ponk tossed George a Reese\u2019s peanut butter cup. \n\n\n\u201cBets on who\u2019s going to fall asleep first?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d Clay said immediately. Before George even had a chance to respond, the entire room laughed, full of agreement.\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d George protested. He had pulled several all-nighters before\u2014 he was an expert at them. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay awake.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Clay said teasingly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it through the first movie and then crash.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge huffed. \u201cNo I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll make it through at least two.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap snorted. \u201cSure you will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d George said, flushing. \u201cI\u2019ll stay awake the whole night, just you watch.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Alyssa said loudly, breaking up their ribbing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start picking a movie. No bloodshed please.\u201d \n\n\nThe conversation obediently quieted down, though George still felt the heat in his face. In front of Alyssa were about a dozen different DVDs, sprawled over the floor, and she held up different horror movies and made people vote on how much they wanted to see them. Stereotypical horror movies were shot down quickly\u2014 no one wants to watch Hereditary, Clay\u2014 but some of the best ones still rose to the top.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFinal votes,\u201d Alyssa said, and held up two different DVDs. \u201cScream or The Conjuring. Vote now or forever hold your peace.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t vote for Scream is dead to me,\u201d Clay called out, and tore open another Hershey's bar.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cVote for The Conjuring and I\u2019ll pay you five bucks,\u201d Skeppy said quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nClay tossed an Almond Joy at the back of Skeppy\u2019s duck onesie. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs too!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Alyssa called, \u201cBreak it up. Who\u2019s voting for Scream?\u201d\n\n\nFour hands went up. Alyssa glared at Sapnap. \u201cYou can only use one hand.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap shrugged and kept both hands up. Alyssa rolled her eyes but asked who was voting for The Conjuring\u2014 again, three votes. George didn\u2019t know what to vote for\u2014 he hadn\u2019t seen either of them, and was just judging based off of the movie covers.\n\n\n\u201cGeorge?\u201d Alyssa prompted. \u201cYou haven\u2019t voted yet.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cScream,\u201d Clay said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cConjuring,\u201d Skeppy said, and added, \u201cFive dollars!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d George said, pretending to consider it, \u201cFive dollars is a pretty tempting offer\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Clay said, drawing out the vowels. \u201cGeorgie, please vote Scream. Please.\u201d\n\n\nGeorgie. His heart skipped a beat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d George sighed, and tried not to show how flustered that nickname had made him. \u201cScream.\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa groaned good-naturedly, but put the DVD in regardless. As the title screen flashed across the television, Sapnap leaned over and whispered in George\u2019s ear, \u201cYou\u2019re so whipped.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d George muttered, and sank lower into the sofa.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge wasn\u2019t one for horror movies, especially not genuinely scary movies, but he found more fun in making fun of the plot holes and character decisions than in watching the movie itself. Everyone readily agreed with his criticisms, and even Clay laughed at one of George\u2019s muttered comments despite how much he had wanted to watch the movie.\u00a0\n\n\nThe movie ended, and as the credits rolled across the screen, Ponk flicked the lights on. George blinked the spots out of his eyes, and sympathized with everyone else\u2019s groans of displeasure.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting water,\u201d Clay said, and hoisted himself up off the floor. \u201cAnyone want anything?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shook his head, and Clay nodded and left the room. Slowly, everyone untangled themselves\u2014 Sapnap had practically sunk into the sofa, underneath a fluffy blanket, and Skeppy and Bad were sitting right next to each other on the floor. Alyssa yawned and pushed herself up from one of the beanbags. George stretched out, fingers and toes tingling from being in the same position for so long.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNext movie?\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cAnyone have any ideas?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s watch a kid movie,\u201d Sapnap suggested. \u201cI vote Hocus Pocus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNightmare Before Christmas,\u201d Ponk said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMonster\u2019s Inc.,\u201d Bad said.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a Halloween movie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNeither was Scream!\u201d\n\n\nGeorge sat back and enjoyed the bickering. He grabbed another piece of candy from their massive pile in the middle of the floor and relished the sweet taste of chocolate in his mouth.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the middle of the argument, Clay came back. \u201cGeorge,\u201d he said, and gestured, \u201cMove over.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge blinked, and then abruptly scooted over so there was room for Clay to sit on the sofa, right next to where George had been sitting. It put George in between Clay and Sapnap, and he uncomfortably realized that he was too close to Clay for comfort. Every molecule in his body was buzzing, all frantic wiring, and he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright everyone,\u201d Alyssa called again, and held up two DVDs. \u201cWe\u2019re voting between Nightmare Before Christmas or Hocus Pocus.\u201d\n\n\nPeople called out their votes, and George busied himself with breaking off another piece of chocolate. He was achingly aware of the inch of space between him and Clay\u2014 close enough that George could just reach out and touch. So close.\n\n\n\u201cGeorge, what are you voting for?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever Clay votes,\u201d George said without thinking.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap snorted, and then unsuccessfully tried to pass it off as choking on what he was eating.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSimp,\u201d Ponk called. George scowled at him and tossed a pillow in his direction. He couldn\u2019t believe he had said that out loud. Ponk laughed and threw the pillow back.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Clay said, sounding unbothered, \u201cI vote Nightmare Before Christmas.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s five votes for Nightmare Before Christmas,\u201d Alyssa said, and looked to Sapnap diplomatically. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch Hocus Pocus next, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all missing out,\u201d Sapnap insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo are we ready to start?\u201d Alyssa said, neatly cutting off Sapnap\u2019s complaints. \n\n\nAs soon as everyone agreed, Skeppy pushed himself up and flicked the lights off, and Ponk pressed play. Slowly, everyone returned back to the positions they had been in before, curled up against each other, laughing and talking. The opening credits rolled out, and George found himself caught between Clay and Sapnap, wanting to relax but not quite sure how when he was so on edge.\u00a0\n\n\nSlowly, George let himself rest against the sofa, and then all of a sudden, he and Clay had somehow ended up pressed against each other. He didn\u2019t know how it happened. It started with his head resting on Clay\u2019s shoulder as the movie progressed, and then George pulled his legs up to the sofa for comfort, and then he just leaned against Clay further. So Clay relaxed into the corner of the sofa, accidentally pulling George closer, and then that was how they stayed.\u00a0\n\n\nThe movie went on\u2014 George had seen Nightmare Before Christmas when he was a kid, and he already knew the plot and the songs. The time was getting closer and closer to one AM, the night was drifting away, and George was comfortable and quiet and relaxed, and his eyelids felt so heavy.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t even realize he had dozed off until something shifted next to him, and he was jolted into half awareness- that stage perfectly in between being blessedly asleep and awake. He didn\u2019t want to open his eyes, but he could tell from the hushed voices around him that it must be late into the night.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAw,\u201d Bad whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s so cute.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSomeone shifted, and George realized that he had fallen asleep on someone; he could feel their chest rising and falling as they breathed. There was an arm rested around his shoulders, comforting and warm, and their other hand was threading through George\u2019s hair, smoothing it down and playing with it.\n\n\n\u201cWhen are you going to say something?\u201d Sapnap whispered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou should.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d someone else muttered. Vaguely, George recognized Clay\u2019s voice.\n\n\nGeorge heard everything through a watery filter, half asleep. He was warm and tired, and whoever he was sleeping on was calming, and before he knew it, George was about to drift off again.\u00a0\n\n\nHe heard Sapnap\u2019s voice say something, words that were shapeless and didn\u2019t quite make sense, and then Clay\u2019s voice again. George made a sleepy, small stretch, and curled up.\u00a0\n\n\nThe combination of sweet candy and comfortable pajamas and body heat was soothing and wonderful, and George fell asleep again to the sound of Clay\u2019s muffled voice. \n\n\nThe next school day, there was a surprise.\n\n\nGeorge opened his locker and confetti fluttered out, falling to the floor in multicolored pieces and covering everything in glitter. He stepped back in shock and blinked down at the mess at his feet.\n\n\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d multiple voices cheered at the same time, and George jolted like he was given an electric shock.\n\n\n\u201cYou really thought we were going to forget your birthday?\u201d Alyssa said cheerfully. \u201cToday is George Day!\u201d\n\n\nGeorge took a birthday cone from Ponk and stared at it for a moment. \u201cMy birthday was yesterday.\u201d\n\n\nPonk rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, and we said happy birthday then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut we couldn\u2019t do a full on birthday party because there wasn\u2019t enough time,\u201d Bad said, \u201cSo we\u2019re celebrating today!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have to put on a birthday cone,\u201d Clay interjected. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re all wearing one.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes and did his best not to grin as he put the stupid little birthday cone on his head. He looked at everyone else and laughed; they all had equally dumb birthday cones on, in shades of glittery blue. George felt so happy that he thought he was going to burst.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd we have birthday cake for you at lunch,\u201d Sapnap added.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou guys are ridiculous,\u201d George said, laughing, and let himself get pulled along for the ride.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge assumed it would be awkward for him to have a birthday cone on, in the classes that none of his friends were in. To his surprise, however, half the school seemed to have been roped into wearing one. George knew that Skeppy had brought a ton of extra cones, but surely not this many. George wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because they actually cared and wanted to celebrate his birthday, or because they had just seen everyone else do it and went along with it, but either way, it made him stand out less.\n\n\nThen right before precalculus, a girl cornered him outside the doorway.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, George!\u201d she said brightly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said. He felt slightly uncomfortable. Clearly she knew who he was, but George didn\u2019t evne know her name.\n\n\n\u201cAre you doing anything for it?\u201d\n\n\nWhy was she talking to him? \u201cMaybe, with my friends.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d she said. She was very peppy. \u201cWould you want to get lunch sometime this week?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLunch?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d she said, still brightly, almost uncomfortably so, \u201cIt would be nice to get to know you.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt rather strained; he wished that class would start so he could escape the conversation. It was clear that she was flirting with him, but George didn\u2019t care, as rude as that sounded. He liked to be with his friends, with Clay, and with Dream, and he didn\u2019t understand why he would be interested in someone he didn\u2019t even know.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he started awkwardly, \u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t even know you\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe was abruptly cut off as Clay arrived, thankfully right on time. \u201cHey, George.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d George said, almost sighing in relief. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Clay said nonchalantly. \u201cShould we go inside?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge turned to go and abruptly realized that the girl he had been talking to had vanished somewhere. He felt uneasy about it, but he had wanted to escape from the conversation badly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Clay commented, almost as an afterthought. \u201cThat was a little harsh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHarsh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou just turned her down like that,\u201d Clay said, and gestured to the outdoor hallway.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d George said, flushing. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be harsh.\u201d\n\n\nClay shrugged. \u201cI get it. It\u2019s hard to let people down easy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said sarcastically. \u201cI bet you do it all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJeez,\u201d Clay raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo need to be rude.\u201d\n\n\nAgain, George felt like he was missing part of the conversation there, and he suddenly felt uncomfortable for turning the tables on Clay. \u201cSorry,\u201d he tried. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\n\nClay let his chair tilt back and waited for George to finish his sentence.\n\n\nFinally, George said, \u201cI\u2019ve just never had someone be interested in me like that before. At least not as bold.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClay hummed. \u201cThat\u2019s surprising.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Clay continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a girlfriend before? Or boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shook his head. He wasn\u2019t sure why Clay was asking about that. \n\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked,\u201d he responded.\n\n\nClay raised an eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. You\u2019re the whole package, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe whole package?\u201d George repeated, confused.\n\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Clay nodded. \u201cThe personality, the looks, the accent, the sense of humor\u2026 all of that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of that?\u201d George repeated.\u00a0\n\n\nFor once, Clay looked slightly flustered, the same way George always felt on the inside. He opened his mouth to respond, and the bell rang in the same breath. Quickly, Clay turned and pulled out his notebook. George looked at him for a moment. For some reason, he felt like he had won some sort of contest\u2014 though what contest, George wasn\u2019t sure.\n\n\nThe rest of his birthday was fairly unremarkable, except for the fact that almost the entire school body swarmed their lunch table hoping for a slice of the sheet cake Bad had ordered. It was chocolate with vanilla frosting and those delicious, fake piped flowers on top, and George was given the first celebratory slice for his birthday. The remainder of it was doled out among their friends. Everyone who sat at their table got an entire slice, and then Bad generously donated the rest of the cake to everyone around them who wanted a slice. George took a bite and tried to stop himself from smiling; it was such a great day.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your birthday wish?\u201d Alyssa prompted. \u201cYou get seventeen wishes, for being seventeen.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works,\u201d Ponk said, but Alyssa swatted his arm.\n\n\nGeorge raised his hands in a placating gesture. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to say. They don\u2019t come true if I say them out loud.\u201d\u00a0He also certainly didn\u2019t want to tell his birthday wishes in front of everyone, knowing what he was wishing for. \n\n\nThere was a chorus of well-natured groans, and Skeppy said indignantly, \u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not cheating,\u201d Clay said, \u201cHe\u2019s right, it won\u2019t come true if he says it out loud. You have to do it over birthday candles.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI would have made you blow out candles,\u201d Bad said despondently, \u201cBut we\u2019re not allowed to light things on fire while on school campus.\u201d He shot an accusatory glance at Sapnap. \u201cI wonder why that rule was put in place.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap had the grace to look guilty. \u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t mean to get it outlawed for the entire student body.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou set off fireworks on campus,\u201d Clay said amusedly. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn my defense,\u201d Sapnap said, holding up his hands, \u201cIt was hilarious.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe entire table laughed. George took another bite of birthday cake as the conversation kept moving.\u00a0\n\n\nSuddenly, Clay shifted so he was sitting next to George. \u201cYou have frosting here,\u201d Clay said, and didn\u2019t wait for George to get it himself. Instead, he swiped his finger across George\u2019s cheek, and then stuck that finger in his mouth, sucking off the frosting. George watched the way his throat clicked as he swallowed and was fairly certain that he had just gone bright red.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d George said. Stammered, slightly. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\nClay hummed. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge ate another bite of cake and tried to swallow past the sudden dry feeling in his throat. He tried to remind himself how to breathe and sucked in a slow, steady breath. Now was not the time to fall head over heels in love, George.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately, as casual as George tried to be, Sapnap caught onto him fairly quickly. After school had ended, he cornered George by the Green as George was about to walk home.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Sapnap urged. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked him out yet?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d George said, glancing around quickly to make sure no one was going to overhear them. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the right moment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never going to be a right moment if you keep waiting,\u201d Sapnap said crossly.\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes. That much was true, but he still naively hoped there would be a moment where it was going to be obvious. Where the stars would align, and both he and Clay would know that it was a perfect moment for things to happen. Unfortunately, George highly doubted there was going to be a moment like that.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d George sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap shrugged as if to say I always am. George rolled his eyes. Sapnap was such an idiot sometimes.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he got home that afternoon, his mother had his own birthday celebration all laid out for him, complete with two fancy cupcakes in the fridge and a tiny pile of presents on the kitchen table. She had taken the night off of work to celebrate his birthday with him, and she made George blow out one candle (seventeen candles on one cupcake were too much to hope for).\u00a0\n\n\nHe went to sleep that night, with a brand new computer monitor and a new designer hoodie hung in the closet, and stared at the ceiling. It was such a difference to his last birthday, where his friends knew that he had just turned a year older, but didn\u2019t put in the same amount of effort. Where the entire school didn\u2019t come and say happy birthday, where the weather was dim and rainy instead of light and sunny. \n\n\nIt was such a good day that George didn\u2019t even want to fall asleep, because then it would be over. He wanted to cling to this feeling forever.\n\n\nThe next day, their precalculus teacher passed back their unit tests from the week before Halloween. She placed them face-down on everyone\u2019s desk, which was always a bad sign, and George turned his over hesitantly. He was sure that there were going to be countless red marks over his, signalling all he had done wrong. But to his extreme surprise, he had nearly gotten a ninety-five\u2014 his highest grade in the entire year so far.\n\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d Clay said, looking over. \u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said. \u201cWhat did you get?\u201d\n\n\nClay laughed. \u201cNot my best, but it\u2019s okay.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spent so much time tutoring me in class that you\u2019re not even focusing on the lectures anymore,\u201d George laughed. \n\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Clay said, half-seriously. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just need to study more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe could study together,\u201d George blurted suddenly.\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe could work together on things,\u201d George said. \u201cOur own small study group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Clay admitted. \u201cTonight?\u201d\n\n\nWow, George thought. That had gone much better than expected.\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy house,\u201d Clay said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been there before, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d George admitted. \n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Clay blinked. \u201cI\u2019ll send you my address. You can meet my cat, too, remember?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge remembered that faint comment from the last time they had talked, perched on top of a kid\u2019s playground. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Clay said, and smiled. \u201cTonight at seven.\u201d \n\n\nThat night at six fifty five (George had been careful to time it, so he wasn\u2019t absurdly late or awkwardly early) George knocked cautiously at Clay\u2019s door. It was a wide, light blue building down one of the quiet strees in their neighborhood. With two stories and white balconies, it was nearly straight out of a movie set. \n\n\nThere was no answer, and George shuffled uncomfortably. He was certainly at the right house, unless Clay had given him the wrong address, and he tried to listen for faint sounds coming through the door. He was debating whether to text Clay or not when the door swung open.\n\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Clay said, and George echoed it back. \u201cCome in?\u201d \n\n\nHe closed the door behind George and immediately headed over to a staircase in the corner; slowly, George followed him upstairs. He could hear muted conversation coming from another room and the clink of silverware. \n\n\nOn the second floor, various family photos lined the hallway; pictures of school portraits, someone\u2019s graduation, a piano recital. George pointed to a blond kid\u2019s kindergarten portrait and asked amusedly, \u201cIs that baby you?\u201d\n\n\nClay turned around to see and then flushed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was an ugly child.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI think you were pretty cute,\u201d George said. \n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Clay said, embarrassed. \u201cAt least I look better now.\u201d\n\n\nYeah, George wanted to agree, with wavy blond hair, those bright eyes, a jawline sharp enough to cut glass, that easygoing smile\u2014 \n\n\nGeorge forcibly directed his thoughts away. He was here to study, not do much else. He wasn\u2019t here to wax poetry about Clay\u2019s looks. \n\n\nThere was a small seating area, right next to the stairs, with a circular table and two armchairs. George dropped his backpack to one of them; as soon as he did, he heard a faint meow coming from a different room. Paws pattered on the floor, and eventually a tiny, tawny head poked out from around a door. \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Patches,\u201d Clay said, noticing George\u2019s curious glance. Upon hearing her name, Patches approached and began twisting through Clay\u2019s legs, winding around and around. \u201cShe\u2019s a menace.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge bent down and offered his hand to Patches, who eagerly rubbed against it and meowed sharply when George didn\u2019t immediately pet her. George smiled and carefully scratched under her chin and behind her ears, and soon Patches was purring louder than a tractor.\n\n\n\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Clay noted. \u201cShe\u2019s usually not this friendly to new people.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d George said, straightening up, \u201cYou two must have a lot in common.\u201d\n\n\nClay huffed a short breath and picked up Patches, who meowed in indignation. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt somewhat uneasy. \u201cJust that it takes you a while to open up.\u201d\n\n\nClay raised an eyebrow. \u201cNot that we both like you?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s heart skipped a beat and he tried to act nonchalant. He could feel his face burning. \u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a question or a statement. Either way, there was silence between them for a moment. George shuffled awkwardly and achingly wished that he had just said nothing.\n\n\nFinally, Clay shrugged. Patches wriggled in his arms and meowed again, and Clay obediently turned and put her down. She immediately turned to George, twining around his feet, demanding to be pet.\n\n\n\u201cShould we go study?\u201d Clay offered. George nodded. The moment between them dissipated. George was absurdly thankful for that. \n\n\nClay disappeared into another room and came back with his precalculus textbook; George had made the right decision to not bring his own. \u201cWhere should we start?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe homework for tomorrow,\u201d George decided. \u201cI still haven\u2019t done mine.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Clay said, with obvious trepidation, \u201cI hate derivatives. Should we start working on it?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge grimaced. \u201cNo better time than now.\u201d \n\n\nFor the first time, George saw Clay get frustrated over not understanding something. He had always been so competent and intelligent that George somehow assumed that he understood everything without trying. Now, studying with him, George saw a different side of him: someone who ruthlessly attempted, through trial and error, to perfect something, and wouldn\u2019t quit until it was perfected. For some reason, it only made Clay more likable. Far more than George admired competence, he liked dedication. \n\n\nGeorge found himself staring at Clay as he scrawled down different answers and graphs, at the way he leaned back in his chair in satisfaction when he got a question right, at the way he bit his lip when he was in intense thought.\n\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s okay to get a problem wrong, right?\u201d George said, almost laughing. \n\n\n\u201cNot according to my parents,\u201d Clay muttered, and then stopped short, as if just realizing what he had said. He looked as if he wanted to take the words back, but they had already been spoken.\n\n\nUncomfortably, George asked, \u201cAre they really strict about grades?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d \n\n\nHe looked down at his problem and then abruptly pushed it back over to George. \u201cCheck my work for me.\u201d\n\n\nHe was back to being the distant, closed off version of Clay that George had gotten to know very well. Obediently, George glanced through it and checked Clay\u2019s calculations against his own. \n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d George said hesitantly, not looking up from Clay\u2019s homework, \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world to get bad grades. It\u2019s all a learning experience.\u201d \n\n\nClay didn\u2019t look convinced, so George continued. \u201cEspecially back in the UK, my grades were absolute shit, and it never mattered much.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice and all for you, but your parents probably didn\u2019t ground you for a month for not getting perfect grades.\u201d\n\n\nClay\u2019s tone was matter of fact. George hesitated, awkwardly stuck between wanting to convince him otherwise or just let him speak. He felt like it would be worse to mention that he only lived with his mother, that his father had been out of the picture for a while, especially when Clay seemed to simmer with frustration.\n\n\nSlowly, he said, \u201cIs it hard having those expectations?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Clay said. He laughed dryly. \u201cWe got into a huge argument last year, about my future, how I wasn\u2019t living up to potential, all that. It got really bad one night and I ended up crashing on Sapnap\u2019s couch for two weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d George said. He didn\u2019t know what else to say. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d\n\n\nClay shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt still sucks though,\u201d George said. Quietly: \u201cAre things\u2026 better now?\u201d\n\n\nClay looked down at their math homework, and his fingers tapped an unsteady beat on the table. \u201cKind of.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt a little lost. He opened his mouth to say something\u2014 he wasn\u2019t sure what\u2014 but Clay cut him off.\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even telling you this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d George said hastily. He knew what the need to vent felt like, and he knew that it was better to talk about things than to hold them in. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t keep my mouth shut around you,\u201d Clay muttered, but it was lighthearted. \n\n\n\u201cI guess I bring out the best in you,\u201d George said lightly.\n\n\nClay huffed. \u201cThat, you do.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not\u2026 the closest,\u201d George said, not sure where he was going with this, \u201cBut in all seriousness, I\u2019ll listen to you whenever.\u201d \n\n\nClay smiled wryly. \u201cThanks. I might take you up on that offer sometime.\u201d \n\n\nSilence fell between them, broken only by the sound of Patches\u2019 purring; she had taken occupancy on George\u2019s lap and refused to move.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get back to studying,\u201d Clay offered. \u201cIs my answer right?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge glanced down at the papers; he had completely forgot about them. \n\n\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d he said, slightly embarrassed, and checked the work again quickly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d \n\n\nClay smiled again, a mix of his arrogant, talented one and his softer, quieter one, and George felt his heart skip a beat.\n\n\n\u201cNext question,\u201d he said hurriedly, and flicked through the textbook. \u201cGraph the tangent line of this equation\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThey completed one question, then the next, and before he knew it, they had both completed their homework and were a hundred percent sure every question was correct. The hours passed away, trickling down like sand in an hourglass, and the sun dipped below the horizon in shades of blue. \n\n\nAt some point, George yawned widely, mind fuzzy with variables and graphs and derivatives. Clay glanced over at him. \n\n\n\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d George lied, and then yawned again. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost ten thirty,\u201d Clay realized, looking at the time. \u201cWe have school tomorrow, we should probably pack up for tonight.\u201d\n\n\nWith a start, George looked at the time; he hadn\u2019t realized how late it had gotten. That tended to happen when he was with Clay. \n\n\nWith a regretful sigh, he began to pack his things up, and was forced to dislodge Patches, who had been sleeping on his lap in blessed peace. Clay glanced down at her and laughed; she was looking at George with hurt in her eyes, as expressive as cats could get. \n\n\n\u201cWe should do this again,\u201d George said hopefully. \u201cThis was really helpful.\u201d\n\n\nTo his surprise, Clay actually seemed open to it, and his eyes were light. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d George said stupidly, and then realized he was just repeating himself. \n\n\n\u201cNext week?\u201d Clay offered. \u201cSame time?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019ll come over then.\u201d \n\n\nHe zipped his backpack shut and slung it onto his back, wincing at the weight. Clay opened the door for him, and the muggy, humid Floridian air drifted inside. He could hear crickets chirping in the dark, could see the way the yellow street lights illuminated the road. \n\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d George said. He didn\u2019t really want to leave.\n\n\nClay paused too. \n\n\nThen his eyes flickered down to George\u2019s lips. \n\n\nGeorge paused.\n\n\nIt was so quiet.\n\n\nClay was so close.\n\n\nThen Patches, twining between both of their legs, meowed loudly. The moment shattered. Clay looked down at her and huffed. She meowed again, demanding and needy, and Clay let her jump into his arms, taking a practiced step backward.\n\n\n\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d Clay said. \n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d George said, heart racing.\n\n\nTime felt syrupy, like it was made of molasses. The door closed behind him. George swatted away a buzzing mosquito from his ear and couldn\u2019t stop the triumphant smile from spreading across his face. \n\n\nDream hadn\u2019t been online in a few hours, but George texted him anyway. He felt so nervous that his hands were trembling\u2014 less nervousness, and more a rush of adrenaline. George was fairly positive that Clay liked him back. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i really think my crush likes me back \n\n\nWithin a few minutes, his phone buzzed.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yay \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: he\u2019s talking to me so much more its really nice!!\n\n\ndreamwastaken: good for you!\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i could also be overestimating it but i really think its looking up for me\n\n\ndreamwastaken: thats great\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i know :))\n\n\nDream didn\u2019t respond for another few minutes, and George checked his phone; three dots rose and fell, rose and fell again, before Dream\u2019s message came through.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i really hope everything goes well for you\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i hope you\u2019re happy \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: awww thats so sweet &lt;3\n\n\ndreamwastaken: seriously though. you\u2019re my best friend and if you\u2019re happy, im happy\n\n\nAn odd sort of fondness rose in his chest, light and flowing. George couldn\u2019t place a name to it, but for half a second, it reminded him of how he felt around Clay. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i love u!!\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i love you :(\n\n\nGeorge stared at the little emoticon Dream had sent. It dimmed his excitement somewhat. It seemed almost\u2026 resigned.\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t quite know what to make of it.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: ugh i feel so sick \n\n\nGeorge yawned, eyes bleary from sleep, and read Dream\u2019s message again. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: :(\n\n\ndreamwastaken: is it worth it going to school honestly\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: probably not, if you\u2019re feeling really bad\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i think i might go honestly \n\n\ndreamwastaken: it can\u2019t be that bad \n\n\ndreamwastaken: ok i\u2019ll go \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: you sure??\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yeah its just like. seven hours or whatever right?\n\n\ndreamwastaken: ill just chug a bottle of dayquil and suffer through it\n\n\nGeorge raised an eyebrow cynically and turned his phone off; Dream was free to make all the worst life decisions he could, and George was rarely able to convince him out of things. \n\n\nGeorge himself wished that he didn\u2019t have to go to school that morning; he had gone to sleep an hour too late, trying desperately to finish his physics homework before Friday morning arrived, and now was exhausted. His physics homework still wasn\u2019t done\u2014 George would have to steal Skeppy\u2019s answers before class started. \n\n\nHe yawned again, long and wide like a cat, and scrubbed the sleep from his eyes. He was going to chug two cups of coffee and then seize the day. He could do this. \n\n\n\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d Sapnap said, the second George stepped foot on campus. George yawned again and raised a middle finger. \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have the physics homework done, do you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Sapnap proclaimed. \u201cSkeppy does, though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d George sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll copy it all down in first period.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you can stay awake that long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running on caffeine and sheer willpower at this point,\u201d George said. \u201cI can do anything.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Sapnap said dryly, and they headed on their way to class\n\n\nThankfully, Skeppy glady donated his homework for George to frantically copy during their shared history class. He tried not to be too conspicious about it, changing word choices and changing the answers to certain problems so his cheating wasn\u2019t obvious. He was sure that half of it was wrong, but it was better to get completion points than no points at all. \n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said, flashing Skeppy a quick smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d Mrs. Carter called, \u201cQuiet in the back row.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge ducked his head and focused back on his notes. He could feel his eyelids drooping, but every time he was close to falling asleep, Sapnap kicked his chair and jolted him awake. Fortunately he hit his second wave around two hours later, and the faint fuzziness behind his temples faded. George was looking forward to an hour of talking to Clay in precalculus, but when he walked in, he saw that Clay\u2019s seat was noticably empty. \n\n\nGeorge stared at it a second in confusion, before pushing it from his mind. He was able to focus on the lecture much more, now that he wasn\u2019t constantly distracted with Clay\u2019s presence. The class wasn\u2019t nearly as enjoyable without Clay\u2019s muttered comments and quick laughs, though. \n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Clay?\u201d he asked at lunch, as everyone loaded into Bad\u2019s minivan. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in math with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d Sapnap said. \u201cHe texted me this morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAw,\u201d Bad said, \u201cThat sucks. Is he okay?\u201d\n\n\nSapnap waved a hand dismissively. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll go over after school and check in, just in case.\u201d \n\n\nWith that, the conversation moved on. George joined in, interjecting comments every so often when he had something funny to say, but his mind was somewhere else. He had half a mind to text Clay and ask if he was okay. \n\n\nIt was a strange coincidence, he thought with a frown. Both Dream and Clay were sick on the same day. What were the odds of that?\n\n\nBefore he could change his mind, he sent a quick text to Clay.\n\n\ngeorge: hey, i heard you\u2019re sick, hope you feel better soon\n\n\ngeorge: btw i took precalc notes for you if you want them\n\n\nClay didn\u2019t respond immediately, but by the end of lunch, his phone buzzed in his back pocket.\n\n\nclay: thanks :) can you text them to me after school?\n\n\nGeorge sent back a quick yes. It was a dry conversation, but George was still glad he had checked in. He hoped that Clay\u2019s parents weren\u2019t too hard on him for missing school, but there wasn\u2019t much you could do when you were sick. \n\n\nAfter suffering through an entire hour of Spanish, the final bell rang. It was a blessing; he had two days to catch up on sleep, and would probably take a six hour nap after going bowling with everyone.\n\n\nGeorge checked his phone. Dream had sent him a few messages about two hours ago, right after the bell had rang for fifth period:\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i had the craziest fucking day\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i got all ready to go to school and everything and then just crashed \n\n\ndreamwastaken: like legitimately i passed out in the bathroom\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: are you okay??? holy shit\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yes im fine\n\n\ndreamwastaken: parents are a bit upset though but what can you do \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: oh my god im so glad you\u2019re okay thats scary\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: please dont chug any more dayquil\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i wont, i promise\n\n\ndreamwastaken: its so cute that you care abt me so much\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: oh shut up \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: i hate u\n\n\ndreamwastaken: aww i love you too\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes. Dream was so lovably dumb. Of course he would be the type to push himself to try and keep acting normal and then eventually collapse because of it. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: take care of urself okay\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i will. \n\n\ngeorgenotfound: &lt;3\n\n\nAfter seeing Dream go offline again, George headed straight to the bowling alley. Ponk had texted the group chat, seeing as they hadn\u2019t gone in a few weeks due to Skeppy\u2019s work schedule, and everyone readily agreed that it was time to go again. \n\n\nThis was the sixth time George had gone bowling with everyone, and he was steadily getting better and better as time passed. He had learned to deeply appreciate the nachos there (Sapnap was absolutely right about how good they were). At this point, the bowling alley employees recognized him as part of the group, and didn\u2019t even hesitate before giving him the correct pair of bowling shoes.\n\n\n\u201cWhen are we starting?\u201d George said when he arrived. His backpack went forgotten in the corner, piled among the other ones. He entered his name into the bowling system and then took a seat next to Bad, who affectionately ruffled his hair. \n\n\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re all ready,\u201d Alyssa said cheerfully. Without another minute of waiting, Sapnap stepped up to the alley and took his first swing.\n\n\nOver six weeks of bowling, George had actually gotten quite good at it. He wasn\u2019t the most competitive person per se, but he did enjoy being talented at something. Thus, three rounds later, when George had knocked over his third spare in a row, an invigorated sense of pride swelled in his chest.\n\n\n\u201cNice!\u201d Skeppy said appreciatively. \u201cThat was great, George.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge went back to his seat and pulled the plate of nachos towards himself to an affronted gasp from Sapnap. Without Clay there, George was in the lead with points, racking them up turn after turn.\n\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cYou\u2019re taking over Clay\u2019s reign.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Clay that,\u201d George said, \u201cI want to revel in this as long as I can.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap gave George a mocking bow. \u201cOf course, your highness.\u201d \n\n\nGeorge laughed. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d \n\n\nIt made him feel vaguely proud of himself. He wished that Clay were there to see it.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBy the time Thanksgiving rolled around, George was truly and deeply tired of school.\n\n\nThere were no decorations in the hallway like there were for Halloween, no elaborate candy grams to pass out, but the entire school was excited. As soon as Friday hit, there would be an entire week-long break where they could just do nothing. \n\n\nGeorge personally didn\u2019t have much to look forward to; Thanksgiving was an American holiday, and he had never celebrated. \n\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have Thanksgiving in the UK?\u201d Skeppy asked curiously, right after George said that. Ponk swatted his arm. \n\n\n\u201cOf course they don\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just for America.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not doing anything for it?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shook his head. \u201cJust relaxing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Sapnap sighed, \u201cThat must be so nice. My parents always drag me to be with my grandparents and I have to dress up for it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat must be nice,\u201d George said. \u201cDon\u2019t you have big dinners and such?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bad said dreamily. \u201cPumpkin pie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy aunt\u2019s stuffing,\u201d Sapnap fantasized.\n\n\n\u201cApple pie,\u201d Alyssa chimed in. \n\n\nGeorge found himself nodding along; he had seen enough television to know about Thanksgiving and all of the classic American foods associated with it. He had just never experienced it himself.\n\n\n\u201cWe should do a Friendsgiving thing,\u201d Ponk suggested. \n\n\n\u201cFriendsgiving?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, where all your friends get together and have dinner together,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cWe can get pie, and have fun\u2014 it\u2019ll be George\u2019s first Thanksgiving, after all!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d come to Friendsgiving with us, right?\u201d Clay asked, and nudged George\u2019s side. \n\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d George said uncertainly, but not able to say no to him, \u201cIf it\u2019s not any trouble for you guys\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d Clay said, without sparing another thought. \u201cWho\u2019s house are we going to? What day?\u201d\n\n\nBefore he even knew it, they had made plans for \u201cFriendsgiving.\u201d George didn\u2019t even know that was a thing ten minutes ago, but now he was accepted into their plans without hesitation. Everyone equally wanted to give George the classic \u201cThanksgiving\u201d experience\u2014 and George didn\u2019t know what that entailed\u2014 but that excitement dimmed slightly when Bad reminded them that no one knew how to cook. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Sapnap assured them. \u201cWe can just order pie or something from a bakery. You\u2019ll still get to eat pumpkin pie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that much,\u201d George said, but his comments were swept away and ignored. \n\n\n\u201cThe Sunday after Thanksgiving,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cThat works for everyone?\u201d \n\n\nThere was enthusiastic support for that, and then the conversation shifted. A quick breeze blew through the courtyard, and George reveled in the fresh breath of air. \n\n\nThe weather had changed over the last few weeks, although there wasn\u2019t an obvious division between seasons like there was in Brighton. The rain had started picking up as winter approached, this time slightly cooler than the warm, summery rain. The temperature had dipped from the nineties to averaging around the mid seventies. It wasn\u2019t nearly cold enough to wear a coat, but George brought a hoodie to school most days with the sleeves rolled up due to the air conditioning inside.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first time he wore a Supreme hoodie, he got so much shit for it from Sapnap\u2014 apparently, George hadn\u2019t been pegged as a \u201chypebeast.\u201d Honestly, George didn\u2019t care much about the designer brand or the label, he just thought it was an interesting design. For the next few days though, people complimented him on his apparent \u201cincredible taste.\u201d George rather thought he liked it.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore he knew it, teachers were beginning to discuss finals, and what they had to study to pass them. In the beginning of American History, his teacher said that they were starting their final unit, and that if they wanted to get good grades, they should begin studying now. Sapnap rolled his eyes, but for the first time in the semester, began taking actual notes rather than doodling all day.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI hate finals,\u201d George said despondently at lunch one day, the Friday before the start of their Thanksgiving break. \u201cI wish teachers would stop talking about them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in a few weeks,\u201d Alyssa said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ponk sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re assigning us so much homework now, I barely have any free time.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cHow are we supposed to get anything done if there\u2019s homework every night?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou never do your homework anyway,\u201d George pointed out. \u201cYou always copy mine.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap shushed him as a teacher walked by; again, Sapnap pulled off his white headband quickly they walked by, and stuffed it back on the second the teacher was out of eyesight. George laughed. It was such a familiar sight at this point that he barely blinked.\n\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sapnap said falsely, \u201cWhat were you saying about me being a model student again?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Skeppy said, and flicked a balled-up straw wrapper at Sapnap\u2019s forehead. The entire table dissolved into laughter, and George glanced around, feeling oddly and happily at home.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd we have a week long vacation after this!\u201d Bad said cheerfully. \u201cChin up, George.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said faintly\u2014 he was looking forward to a break from school. Still, the biggest stress on his mind wasn\u2019t finals. \n\n\nHe was planning to ask out Clay today. \n\n\nIt was shaping up to be a good day, with startlingly good weather, with no rain on the horizon for miles. He and Clay had been getting along well, recently, enough that George was fairly confident that Clay was interested in him back. Sapnap had been eagerly encouraging him recently, feeding George different words of confidence. At this point, George almost wanted to get it over with if only so Sapnap would stop bothering him.\u00a0\n\n\nThe idea stayed in his mind throughout the entire day, slowly getting louder and louder, until George felt anxious just from thinking about the end of the school day. The minutes flew by faster than light, ticking one after the other, and before he knew it, the final bell had rung. George quickly deposited the contents of his locker into his backpack, ready to not look at them for the next week, and headed to their usual lunch table. \n\n\nOnly Sapnap was there so far, and George and him chatted easily for a few moments. Sapnap complained loudly and at length about their history teacher (apparently his latest report card had been not-so-pleasing).\u00a0Clay joined them a few minutes after school had ended, an easy smile on his face and the sleeves of his hoodie rolled up. \n\n\nSapnap shot George a significant look, and George kicked him under the table. Sapnap winced, but then played it off easily.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, there was a lull in the conversation, and George seized the chance. \u201cClay,\u201d he said quickly, and tugged on the arm of his hoodie, \u201cCould I talk to you for a second?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nClay glanced at Sapnap, and then appraised George for a moment. \u201cSure.\u201d \n\n\nHe followed George as he led him behind one of the school buildings. Most everyone was gone, deserting school the second the break had begun; it was only them. George\u2019s heart fluttered in a panicky, anxious pace, and he tried forcefully to calm it down.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clay said, and leaned against the wall. \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d\n\n\nCome on, George. Come on. His heart was pounding through his ears, making it the only sound he could hear.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Finally, he said, \u201cI really like you.\u201d He rushed the words out like they burned him. \u201cLike like you.\u201d\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t look at Clay\u2019s reaction and continued, \u201cSo I was wondering, if you wanted, we could go out sometime? If you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s stomach felt like jelly, and he was ready to bet that his cheeks were hot enough to fry eggs on. He risked a glance up at Clay, who was staring at him, lips slightly parted. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment.\u00a0\n\n\nThen, awfully, Clay took a step back.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said politely, tactfully, \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s heart skipped twenty beats at once. \n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He took a step back. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\nClay\u2019s glance flickered down to the ground, and he didn\u2019t say anything. George felt like everything had just spiraled out of control.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe can just ignore this,\u201d George tried, \u201cPretend it never happened.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine, it\u2019s just,\u201d Clay fumbled for the right words, and said, \u201cI\u2019m interested in someone else.\u201d\n\n\nOh. \n\n\n\nOh.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d George said, impressed with the evenness of his voice. \u201cOkay, cool.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Clay said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s cool,\u201d George said, grasping for something to say, anything. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Great. Good luck. With them. Great. Cool.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Clay said again, and he truly did look sorry. George stared at the ground and furiously blinked the tears in his eyes away. He wouldn\u2019t cry in front of him. He wouldn\u2019t cry at all. Shit, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n\n\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Clay said, and reached out. \u201cWait, George, please\u2014\u201d\n\n\nGeorge left.\u00a0\n\n\nHe turned on his heel and left. The very act felt cowardly. He was just running away from everything again, wasn\u2019t he? George ignored that feeling, and all the other feelings, and balled them up deep down where he couldn\u2019t reach them. His face was hot and wet and he knew that he was crying, which made it all the more pitiful and embarrassing.\u00a0\n\n\nHow could things have gone so badly? So awfully wrong? Had George just misinterpreted everything that had happened between them, everything that was said?\u00a0\n\n\nHe made it back home in a daze, and ignored his mother\u2019s worried question about what had happened. George went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on his face until the puffiness faded from his eyes, and until the redness in his skin vanished. He looked at himself in the mirror briefly and then turned away. He didn\u2019t want to see himself right then. He didn\u2019t want to do anything. \n\n\nHe just wanted to redo the day, hit rewind, and change it. He could have avoided all of the humiliation and embarrassment if he just hadn\u2019t said anything. If he had just stayed silent. Why couldn\u2019t he stay silent? Why had he bothered to test his luck? \n\n\nHe returned to his bedroom and closed the door behind him. For a moment he stared at his computer across the room and considered booting up Minecraft, but he didn\u2019t have the energy to do that.\n\n\nWhat he really wanted was\u2014\n\n\nHe wanted to talk to Dream.\u00a0\n\n\nHe really, desperately, wanted his best friend. He wished that he could meet Dream in person. He wished he could just give Dream a hug or see him or get to know who he was behind the screen. He wanted to have Dream tell him that everything would be okay, and that it would all work out.\u00a0\n\n\nFumbling for his phone, George texted him.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: this is the worst day\n\n\nDream\u2019s response was almost instant, and George read it.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: tell me about it :/\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i wish i could just go to sleep and wake up and find out today was just an awful dream\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: me too\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: want to talk about it?\n\n\nDream didn\u2019t respond for a long time, but George saw that he was still online. The green dot by Dream\u2019s name never wavered, and with a sigh, George put his phone down by his side. He still felt like crying, but shoved that feeling down.\u00a0\n\n\nHis phone buzzed.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i turned someone down today and it made them cry.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i felt so awful about it and i didn\u2019t know what to do in the moment because i hate making people unhappy but the guy is so nice and sweet to literally everyone. i wish i could\u2019ve just said yes but i don\u2019t want to lead him on\n\n\ndreamwastaken: and it sucks because i tried, i tried so hard to like him, i did everything right and flirted and we had fun conversations, i guess, but it just wasn\u2019t the same\n\n\nGeorge froze.\n\n\nEverything in his body paused as his brain ran through the odds of everything, tying together loose connections and running through every last possibility. Slowly, everything pointed toward the same conclusion. There was no way all of this was a lucky coincidence\u2026 but there was no way it was real.\n\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be true. It couldn\u2019t.\n\n\nAbruptly, he realized Dream had sent him another message, and picked his phone up to read it.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i also told him i was interested in someone else. which is like. the worst possible thing to say. i don\u2019t know why i said it.\u00a0\n\n\nWith shaking fingers, and suddenly incredibly nervous, George typed out:\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: are you interested in someone else?\n\n\ndreamwastaken: yeah.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: it\u2019s complicated.\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: idk if i want to talk more about it.\n\n\nGeorge felt his heart drop from his throat to his gut. More things began lining up in his mind, funny coincidences and things that George had dismissed as impossible scenarios, purely out of luck. The time Dream was sick at the same time as Clay, the same sleepless nights, the same classes\u2026 even their schedules matched up perfectly, down to even the smallest passing period\u2026\u00a0\n\n\nHe had been staring at his phone for too long. \n\n\nHe needed to say something back. Dream wanted an answer. He wanted George to respond. George tried typing out something, and then deleted it. He tried again and then stopped.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat were the odds he would move to the exact same place as his online best friend?\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: that\u2019s okay\n\n\nGeorge waited with bated breath for Dream to respond.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i love you :( &lt;3\n\n\ndreamwastaken: did u want to talk about your day?\n\n\nThe restless anxiety and rejection churned in George\u2019s stomach, before being replaced by a heavy pit of dread. He felt as if his limbs were made of lead. He barely wanted to move, let alone talk about his day.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: not ready yet\n\n\ndreamwastaken: whenever you are, i\u2019m here &lt;3\n\n\nGeorge stared at the little emoticon and tried to muster up the same energy he usually felt\u2014 fluttering cheer, fondness, anything. But all he felt was that sick pit of dread, sinking lower in his gut.\n\n\nGeorge turned his phone off, laid down on his bed, and cried.\n\n\nHe cried for a long time.\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Sapnap shouted, loud enough that George winced through the line, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a red light and my mum is driving me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d Sapnap urged. \u201cSkeppy\u2019s yelling at me for my music taste and I need you here to defend me.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge laughed. \u201cGive me five minutes, okay?\u201d\n\n\nIn response, Sapnap hung up. George looked at the call log, and in the next instant his happy mood instantly slid away. Truth be told, he was not five minutes away. He was pretty much there, just around the corner, and he could see Alyssa\u2019s house from where he was standing. He was still deciding whether he wanted to go or not.\n\n\nIt was the Sunday after Thanksgiving and the next day they were all going to be forced to go back to school. George\u2019s terrible, horrible, no good very bad day had happened a week and a half ago\u2014 the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving break. He hadn\u2019t seen Clay since\u2014 hadn\u2019t seen anyone from the friend group since.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t purposely avoiding them. He still texted in their group chat and dealt with Sapnap\u2019s various rantings, but he had debated long and hard about whether he should come to their planned Friendsgiving event.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had spent the last week trying to come to terms with everything that had happened, and trying to find various ways to deny it. But the harder he fought, the less viable it seemed. There was no way of getting around it.\n\n\nClay was Dream. Dream was Clay. \n\n\nThe odds of him moving to the exact same place as his online best friend were astronomically low. It should have been impossible\u2014 a wild shot in the dark. Yet somehow it had happened anyway.\n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t know if Clay knew about it, or even how Clay would react to having George there. George\u2019s mind spun in terrible circles-- did Clay know? Did he know who George was? Did he know that George knew?\u00a0\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t know. If he knew, and had rejected George\u2014 if he knew\u2014\n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t bear the thought of ruining two of his best friendships in the same day. \n\n\nEven worse, he couldn\u2019t bear thinking about the reactions of his other friends. He didn\u2019t know whether they knew about it. Truth be told, he didn\u2019t want to find out. Even though they had been wonderful and accepting, regardless of how new George was, he worried that they were going to choose Clay over him.\n\n\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t, honestly? The more George thought about it, the more sick he felt. Clay\u2019s\u2014 Dream\u2019s\u2014 personality was undeniably more sociable and funny. He was more popular and interesting than George could ever hope to be. He was certainly smarter, too\u2014 he understood almost everything without even having to try much. George, by comparison, wasn\u2019t really worth anything.\u00a0\n\n\nClay had been a part of their friend group for years and years. He had been Sapnap\u2019s best friend since they were five, for fuck\u2019s sake. And as much as Sapnap tried to help him, George knew that if it came down to it, everyone would choose Clay over him.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge stared at Alyssa\u2019s house and tried to build up the resolve to walk inside. His fingers tapped against his side, and furiously, George tried to still them. He was already there. He had agreed to come a week ago. Everyone was waiting on him. Everyone was waiting inside. They all wanted him to be there. So why couldn\u2019t he move? Why couldn\u2019t he just get up and go?\n\n\nHe glared determinedly at the ground, and finally forced himself to move, only a few minutes after Sapnap had called him. He had been in plenty of awkward situations before; what was one more? All he had to do was act normal. Breathe. He could do this.\u00a0\n\n\nHe knocked on the door, and it swung open.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d\n\n\nEveryone\u2019s hellos blended into a mishmash of voices, and Bad affectionately pulled him closer and ruffled his hair. George shoved him back and Bad put a hand to his heart, mock offended. They were all congregated in Alyssa's kitchen, a sleek, marble covered place. Various appetizers were displayed on the counter, and Sapnap\u2019s music (he really did have terrible taste) was playing in the background. He could hear Skeppy and Sapnap arguing from the other room over who deserved to have the aux cord. \n\n\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d George said, wincing slightly. \u201cMy mum is a slow driver.\u201d\n\n\nThankfully, everyone easily accepted his lie. George took a seat at Alyssa\u2019s counter, right next to Ponk, and kept his stare on the ground. He was achingly aware of Clay, sitting barely ten feet away. George didn\u2019t want to look at him, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He was magnetic. He was pulling George in, no matter how much George tried to resist it. He was fighting a losing battle.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge couldn\u2019t stop staring at him.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was mentally assigning a face to the name of the guy he\u2019d been texting for years, his best friend, everything feeling so recognizable at once\u2014 blond hair, green eyes, a smattering of freckles. The shape of his nose and his jawline. Even his voice lined up, and matched perfectly with what George had always assumed Dream would sound like. It all made so, so much sense.\u00a0\n\n\nClay\u2014 Dream\u2014 caught him staring, twenty painful minutes in, and raised an eyebrow. \u201cGeorge?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d George muttered. He looked down and listened to everyone\u2019s conversations. Clay hummed and turned away. George didn\u2019t know how he could act so unbothered, so incredibly nonchalant, when the entire situation was eating George up on the inside like acid. He didn't know how Clay could try and pretend like everything was normal.\n\n\nSo when Clay wasn\u2019t looking, George continued to take in the furrowed brow of concentration on Clay\u2019s face, the lazy, floppy hoodie he always wore, and abruptly realized there was no air in his lungs and felt like he was drowning. He coughed and turned away, trying to regain some semblance of normalcy.\n\n\n\u201cSapnap,\u201d Skeppy announced, \u201cWe need to talk about your music taste. This is an intervention.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sapnap said indignantly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolute shit,\u201d Ponk said. \n\n\n\u201cLanguage!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Clay laughed. \u201cEveryone knows it.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap huffed and crossed his arms. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just rude.\u201d\n\n\nPonk and Alyssa shared a skeptical glance. \u201cAre we wrong?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cEven George agrees with me,\u201d Clay said, and gestured to him, \u201cRight?\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat was he playing at?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said uncertainly. \n\n\n\u201cI thought you were on my side,\u201d Sapnap whined dramatically. \u201cI just want your support.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt as if he were caught between a rock and a hard place. He glanced quickly from Clay to Sapnap and didn\u2019t quite know what to say. \n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he tried, hoping that was enough to put them at ease. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Clay implored, turning those awful, smirking puppy-dog eyes on him, \u201cGeorgie, please\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d George snapped. \n\n\nThe room quieted. \n\n\nGeorge\u2019s stomach turned. The silence was awful and tense. The only sound was Sapnap\u2019s shitty music playing through the speakers, and George couldn\u2019t handle it anymore. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom,\u201d he said quickly, and tried to escape the suffocating awkwardness. His heart was pounding through his ears. Wordlessly, he went down the hall and locked the door behind him. He ran the water, hoping the white noise would help to clear his mind. \n\n\nFor a moment, he felt awfully, bitterly angry. Why the fuck was Clay\u2014 Dream\u2014 like this? He had seemed so obviously interested in George, had checked off every box, had practically flirted with him, and then suddenly turned him down after leading him on for so long. Now he was back to acting like his old, arrogant self\u2014 back to acting like nothing mattered\u2014 what was wrong with him?\n\nThere was a tentative knock on the door, and then Sapnap\u2019s voice filtered through.\n\n\u201cGeorge?\u201d Sapnap asked quietly. \u201cCome help me pick out the next playlist.\u201d \n\n\nGeorge blinked hard, feeling his eyes stinging, and then sucked in a deep breath and opened the door. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nSapnap caught the back of George\u2019s shirt and tugged. \u201cI want to talk. Come on.\u201d\n\n\nObediently, George followed Sapnap down the hallway, leaving the rest of the group behind. Sapnap stopped once they were distant enough and then fixed George with a firm look. \n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d George said mulishly. \u201cWhy, did Clay tell you anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sapnap said, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t. But clearly something has, and you\u2019re not telling me what.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge crossed his arms and pushed down the bitterness. Sapnap was his friend, and he deserved to know. \n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked him out, and he rejected me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, George wanted to add, Clay has actually been my best friend since I was twelve, and he has no idea.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap\u2019s gaze turned from questioning to shocked, and George quickly looked away. He didn\u2019t want any pity. He just wanted everything to straighten out, to go back to normal.\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Sapnap said, as if he didn\u2019t believe it himself. \u201cHe turned you down?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d George snapped. Wasn\u2019t that what he just said?\n\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Sapnap said, and held his hands out. \u201cSorry for pushing. I\u2019m just\u2026 really?\u201d Sapnap looked a little bit lost. \u201cI was sure he was going to say yes.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge glared.\u00a0\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAs soon as he said it, all of the irritation and frustration leached out of him, and was replaced with the same awful, heavy dread he had felt a few days earlier. Sapnap didn\u2019t deserve his bad mood, and shouldn\u2019t have to put up with how awful he was feeling. All Sapnap had done was do his best to help George along and work things out with him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d George said faintly, into the silence. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be upset.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap gave George a small, apologetic smile. \u201cIt sucks. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nYou don\u2019t know the half of it, George wanted to say. He almost wanted to laugh. It was stupidly, incredibly obvious. It had been obvious for so long.\u00a0\n\n\nThe same questions resurfaced. Did Dream know? Did he know that he and George were friends in real life? Had Dream kept the secret from him, or was he just as clueless as George had been?\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge felt sick. The Dream he knew online was secretive and cared deeply about his privacy, and now it felt as if George had just ripped that to shreds. It felt as if George had just ripped down all the walls and trampled over Dream\u2019s boundaries.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to take a walk?\u201d Sapnap said, lending an escape. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of fresh air in here.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge laughed, wet and choked. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap nodded, and gestured with his hand. \u201cLet me just go tell everyone else we\u2019ll be off, one moment.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap raced around the corner where everyone else was, and his voice echoed faintly. George pressed his palms to his cheeks and blinked furiously; he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been crying. Quickly, he wiped away his tears and tried to clear his mind.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Sapnap said, returning. \u201cLet\u2019s go get a drink somewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot an actual drink,\u201d George said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Sapnap said, and dragged him out into the afternoon daylight.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap pushed him into the closest Starbucks they found and promised to pay for his drink. George rolled his eyes but obligingly sat down at one of the booths. Before long, Sapnap settled in front of him with an iced latte for George and a chocolate frappuccino for himself.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Sapnap said, and sucked the whipped cream off the top of his drink, \u201cTell me everything.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge sighed, opened his mouth to try and find the right words, and ended up spilling everything to Sapnap.\n\n\nHe carefully didn\u2019t mention Dream, and didn\u2019t mention how he had actually known Clay for years. He kept that to himself, knowing that Dream wouldn\u2019t want his privacy to be exposed like that. Still, he told Sapnap everything\u2014 exactly what he had said to ask Clay out, what Clay had said, how the entire situation had ended, how awful everything felt, the way he had tried to avoid him after but couldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sapnap said quietly, eyes wide, after George had practically talked himself hoarse. \u201cSo there\u2019s a third person?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said. \u201cAnd I have no idea who.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sapnap repeated. He looked down at the table in confusion. \u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t think of anyone else.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge twisted his lips. It wasn\u2019t what he really wanted to hear, but it was what he expected. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Sapnap gestured expressively. \u201cClay\u2019s never mentioned another person. Ever. He usually doesn\u2019t even talk with people outside of our group. The only person he\u2019s talked about recently is you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George muttered. Hearing that stung more, somehow.\u00a0\n\n\nHe also resonated with what Sapnap was saying. If Clay was interested in another person, surely Dream would talk to George about it if he felt like he couldn\u2019t talk to his best friend in person? Surely he trusted \"georgenotfound\" enough to confide in him?\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWas there any hope that he might change his mind?\u201d Sapnap asked.\n\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d George said. \u201cHe was nice about it. But it was a pretty obvious no.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge felt his eyes growing prickly again and blinked furiously; he was in public. He hated crying. He wasn\u2019t going to cry again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just start moving on,\u201d George sighed. \u201cIt sucks.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap looked a little lost at what to do for comfort, but gingerly patted George\u2019s arm. For some reason that made George laugh slightly. Sapnap gave him a small smile, and George glanced back down to the table and tried to breathe through the awful rejection dwelling in his chest.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShould we head back?\u201d Sapnap asked after a few moments of silence. Both of their drinks were empty at that point, and George chased the last bits of coffee with his straw before answering.\n\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d George sighed. \u201cI feel better. A little bit.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Sapnap said.\u00a0\n\n\nHe gave George a smile, and suddenly George blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap laughed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I forced you to join our group.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George agreed, eyes stinging, \u201cI never would\u2019ve had a year as great as this without you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap wrapped an arm around George and squeezed him tight, and George laughed and allowed himself to get pulled into the hug. \u201cMe either.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge blinked the wetness out of his eyes and gestured to the sidewalk. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, releasing a slow breath. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWhen they got back, Sapnap marched inside without knocking\u2014 Alyssa had left the door unlocked for them to return. Everyone was seated at the dining table (Alyssa had insisted on it being unnecessarily formal, complete with fancy plates and silverware, though nearly everyone was in jeans or sweatpants). The conversation quieted as they walked in and took the last remaining seats open\u2014 noticeably, on the opposite side of the table from Clay. George wasn\u2019t sure whether that was intentional or not. \n\n\n\u201cWe were waiting for you guys, you took forever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Sapnap said, with an elaborate shrug. \u201cSometimes you just have to go get a Starbucks drink, and you can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get me anything?\u201d Bad teased.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge was extremely grateful for both Sapnap\u2019s lying skills, as well as everyone else\u2019s tactfulness. He risked a glance at the other side of the table, where Clay was sitting. Clay was turned slightly away from the table, typing something on his phone, tongue in cheek, and he seemed to type and retype it multiple times before finally hitting send. As if on cue, George felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.\n\n\nThat basically confirmed it, then, ripping away the last shreds of doubt from George\u2019s hands. George slowly evened his breathing; there was no point in panicking if Dream didn\u2019t know, and so far, he had given no signs of knowing. Clay\u2014 Dream\u2014 wouldn\u2019t have texted him so obviously unless he had no idea who George really was.\n\n\nGeorge resisted the urge to take his phone out of his pocket and read what Clay had just sent him. His phone buzzed four more times, which made George even more curious.\u00a0\n\n\nClay turned his phone off and put it in his pocket. His fingers tapped on the table in an unsteady beat, and he made no obvious effort to join in on their conversation. He laughed along with their jokes, but halfheartedly, and he seemed distanced, much more so than usual. More than once, George caught Sapnap sending Clay a confused, worried look, but said nothing.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally Clay said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go. My dad wants me back.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Bad complained. \n\n\nClay gave one of his trademark, easygoing smiles, and shrugged lightly. It didn\u2019t quite hide his odd mood. \u201cCan\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs everything good at home?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Clay said, and waved a hand. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just getting late.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only five\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe just wants me back,\u201d Clay repeated, voice flinty. There was an awkward silence for a moment. George didn\u2019t dare look up from the tablecloth. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Alyssa asked, concerned.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\u00a0Clay got up and checked his phone again. \u201cHave fun, guys.\u201d \n\n\nAfter he left, Skeppy frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d he commented. Bad hummed in agreement. George said nothing. \n\n\nHe knew Clay was lying.\n\n\nSapnap also said nothing, though George noticed the furtive look sent his way. George swallowed hard, felt the hard outline of his phone in his pocket, and reminded himself that patience was a virtue.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge spent the rest of the night in a quiet daze. He took note of everyone\u2019s comments, took note of their inside jokes and laughs, but found it difficult to join in himself. Through the whole night, Sapnap sat at his side and did his best to try and bring George out of his shell. \n\n\nIt took another hour before everyone mutually agreed to disband and see each other at school the next day. George took the shortest route home that he could, cutting through parks and backyards. The second he shut his front door behind him, he practically ripped his phone out of his pocket and fumbled to unlock it. He opened up the messenger app, and stopped dead in his tracks the second he read Dream's messages.\n\n\ndreamwastaken: hey\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while and it\u2019s probably unexpected for you\n\n\ndreamwastaken: but i want to meet you. in person\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i have wanted to, for a while now, but i wasn\u2019t ready\n\n\ndreamwastaken: but i think i\u2019m ready now.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge stared at his phone. His heart leapt into his throat, and he felt the same fluttering, panicky feeling rise in his chest. Dream wanted to meet him, in person. Dream wanted to know who he was, and more importantly, he trusted George enough to finally meet him.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge pressed a hand to his mouth, not sure whether he was smiling or frowning. He didn\u2019t know whether he was happy or upset, but anything he was feeling right then was tinged with some sort of contentment.\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe it was time to actually set the records straight, once and for all. Finally have everything work out, and put everything to rest.\u00a0\n\n\nHesitantly, he typed out:\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: when are you free?\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: when are you free?\n\n\nGeorge looked at his recent texts again with Dream and tried to quell the frantic pace of his heart. Dream had responded within a few minutes to his text, and eventually the two of them had landed on a perfect time to meet in person for the first time. \n\n\nIt was late in the day on Friday, nearly five in the afternoon, and Dream had picked out a quiet cafe down the block from the movie theater they had been to together. It was nestled between the community park and one of the main boulevards. At this time, the coffee shop would be nearly deserted. It might just be the two of them.\n\n\nGeorge was only a few blocks away from the cafe, and his hands were shaking from where he scrolled through his recent texts with Dream obsessively. He was so anxious that he wasn\u2019t sure how he would handle this. For the entirety of the week before, George had been replaying scenarios in his head, trying to figure out how Clay would respond to him. What would he say when they first met? Would he be disappointed? Would he be excited? \n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t know.\n\n\nHe was almost thirty minutes early to their designated meeting time, which only made things more awkward. Would it be bad if he showed up that early? Would Clay take one look at him and turn around to leave? \n\n\nGeorge kept walking, put his phone in his pocket, and stared at the pavement passing beneath his feet. Vaguely, he wanted to order a coffee just to have something to do with his hands when he got to the cafe, but he abruptly realized that caffeine would only make him more jittery. He slowed his step briefly and tried to calm his nerves. \n\n\nFor the last week, George had been watching Clay as cautiously as he knew how, to see if there was any flash of recognition in his eyes, or if he had no idea. All their interactions had been polite and distanced ever since Friendsgiving. They barely exchanged glances anymore in precalculus, and they certainly didn\u2019t go and study together. Both he and Clay seemed to have mutually decided to forget that anything had ever happened.\u00a0It was sad and distant. \n\n\nGeorge didn\u2019t know whether everyone in their friend group knew what had happened\u2014 if they had picked up on George\u2019s and Clay\u2019s sudden reluctance to be together, or if they were oblivious to the tension. If they did notice, they hadn\u2019t commented on it.\u00a0\n\n\nEven though he had been upset and angry the week before, over the week\u2019s time, all of George\u2019s unhappiness had slowly faded away. Unfortunately, it had been replaced with increasing levels of anticipation, racking up day after day. Last night, George had been unable to sleep, staring up at the ceiling, reading back through his and Dream\u2019s texts over and over. He was counting down the hours, but whether in anxiety or excitement, he couldn\u2019t tell.\u00a0\n\n\nThere was one block until the cafe. George checked his phone again. Dream was online, but he hadn\u2019t said anything. Was he on his way right now? Was he obsessively reading through his texts the same way George had been doing? Was he sitting there, waiting for someone else to walk in, nervously anticipating who it was? George didn\u2019t know.\n\n\nHe nervously wiped his hands on his jeans and swung the cafe door open. His eyes scanned the room, and realized\u2014\u00a0\n\n\nClay was already there.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was sitting in one of the back booths, fingers tapping rapidly on the table, knee bouncing up and down. He kept looking down at his phone and then up at the windows in nervous anticipation.\u00a0\n\n\nAll of a sudden, it seemed so very real. Was he actually going to do this?\n\n\nGeorge start to walk over, but he didn\u2019t know what he was going to say, or what he was going to do, but then he steeled himself, and Clay glanced up at him in clear confusion, head tilted to the side, and then\u2014\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d George said. Shyly: \u201cDream, right?\u201d\n\n\nDream stared at him for a long, long moment before saying quietly, almost voiceless, \u201cGeorge?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d George said again, and a flustered smile spread across his face. He slid into the opposite side of the booth and tried to hide how shaky his hands were. Dream\u2019s eyes flicked over his face, and George knew that he was probably doing the same thing George had done when he first figured it out: putting together a face to the name online, matching together every piece of information. \n\n\nFinally, Dream looked away.\n\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d he said slowly, hesitantly, as if confirming it, and George nodded once. \u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge nodded again, and Dream looked at him again, mouth parted, and finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s you. Of course it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d George said, and his cheeks hurt from smiling.\n\n\nDream shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. I\u2019m literally\u2014\u201d\n\n\nGeorge resisted the urge to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo, I absolutely am.\u201d Dream\u2019s glance flickered over him, again and again, and he smiled\u2014 not Clay\u2019s usual cocky grin, but Dream\u2019s honest and hopeful one. It made George\u2019s heart do a happy little flip in his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014 did you\u2014 how long have you known?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt took me so long to figure out,\u201d George mumbled, feeling his cheeks go red. \u201cI\u2019ve only known for a few weeks. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until you were ready\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWeeks?\u201d Dream echoed, looking flustered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSince you turned me down,\u201d George admitted. Dream had the grace to look slightly sheepish.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf it makes you feel better,\u201d he said, \u201cI turned you down for you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThat gave George pause. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\nDream opened his mouth, closed it again, like he was trying to find the right words to say. Eventually, he seemed to bite the bullet and rushed out, \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you. Georgenotfound. For so long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d George said. He felt a jolt in his stomach, like he had missed a step going down the stairs. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\nDream nodded and ducked his head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh God,\u201d George said, and put his hands over his face, as if that would stop how red his face was going. \u201cSo the whole time I\u2019ve been asking you for relationship advice\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou were asking me about me,\u201d Dream realized, completing George\u2019s sentence. \u201cAnd the whole time I was jealous. Of myself!\u201d\n\n\nThey shared a glance for a moment, eager, earnest, and hopeful, and then broke into laughter. The whole situation was so unrealistic and so incredible. It had gone better than George could have ever imagined.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShould we\u2014 should we order something?\u201d Dream said after a moment. He appeared just as ruffled as George felt. \u201cA drink or something?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like coffee,\u201d George blurted out. He didn\u2019t know why he said it, but it made Dream\u2019s cheeks turn pink. George didn\u2019t think that was from the air conditioning. \u201cI can get something for you. Hot chocolate?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeppermint,\u201d Dream said. \u201cThe only good hot chocolate flavour.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCinnamon is better, you\u2019re so wrong,\u201d George argued back, and all of a sudden, it was that easy. Their bickering turned into a friendly debate over the merits of tea versus coffee, and then it merged into a conversation about their latest game in Minecraft and ways to improve. George sketched out a plugin they could code where one person could control the mobs in the game, and the other person had to survive. Dream laughed and started naming all of the ways he would easily win and George rolled his eyes, countering every one of his escape ideas with some of his own.\u00a0\n\n\nThey left the cafe at one point, once they had thoroughly exhausted themselves of sitting still, and started walking down towards the same park they had been in before. This time there was no need to hop the fence. The sun was gentle overhead, about to dip below the horizon, and the sky was clear. Dream and George walked around the length of the park, still talking the entire time, and eventually arrived back at the same playground they were at before.\n\n\n\u201cWant to climb it again?\u201d George said playfully. Dream laughed.\n\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re here to catch me,\u201d he said, teasing. George\u2019s heart jumped.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on, then,\u201d George said, beckoning him up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDream stared at the monkey bars for a second, before apparently steeling himself and climbing up after George. George offered him a hand and Dream gripped it tightly, pulling himself up to sit next to George.\u00a0He was tense for a moment, white knuckled, and then relaxed as soon as it became apparent that he wasn\u2019t going to fall. \n\n\nThey looked out over the park for a moment; yellow sunlight cut through trees in dappled patches, and sparrows chirped songs from the trees. An elderly couple walked together down one of the paths, another young woman jogged through with a dog running next to her. George realized suddenly that Dream had never let go of his hand, and had instead just linked his fingers through George\u2019s. It made him feel fluttery and radiant in the best way.\u00a0\n\n\nHe turned and saw that Dream was looking at him again, eyes still wide with amazement.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Dream said quickly, and looked away George caught him staring. \u201cI\u2019m just still trying to believe it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d George said. \u201cMe too, in a way.\u201d\n\n\nDream opened his mouth, seemed to fumble for words, and then said, \u201cHow did I not figure it out? It makes so much sense now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHindsight is twenty twenty,\u201d George said agreeably. Dream rolled his eyes and shoulder-checked him lightly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said. \u201cI do.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSilence fell over them again, comfortable and calming. Dream\u2019s thumb circled the back of George\u2019s hands almost unconsciously, while George was hyper aware of every movement he made.\u00a0It sent tingly, electric shocks spiking across George\u2019s nerves.\n\n\n\u201cSorry about everything at Friendsgiving,\u201d Dream blurted suddenly. George cocked his head at him curiously. \n\n\n\u201cI just\u2014\u201d Dream held up a hand, as if looking for an answer. \u201cI just thought that if I acted like normal, everything would go back to normal.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cI guess that didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d George said, feeling a bit lost. He did remember what Dream had said then, and how awkwardly George had reacted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, and I didn\u2019t know if you knew, and I was so on edge.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRegardless,\u201d Dream said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for pushing your boundaries like that.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d George said again, and at Dream\u2019s skeptical glance, squeezed his hand tighter and repeated it. \u201cEverything worked out, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Dream said softly, and looked at him again. \u201cI guess it did.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou are such a sap,\u201d George said, rolling his eyes. \n\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Dream said, slightly embarrassed. He shifted on the monkey bars and froze for a quick second as his hand slipped.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d George said, and reached a hand out to steady him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fall.\u201d\n\n\nDream huffed. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, stop leaning over the edge,\u201d George laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s scarier if you look over.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dream said thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better to confront your fears.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very good at doing that,\u201d George said.\n\n\n\u201cI think you are,\u201d Dream said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMhm?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThere was a heavy, weighted silence between them. George looked down at the park again and relished the feel of Dream\u2019s hand in his.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d George said slowly, \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d\n\n\nDream\u2019s brow furrowed slightly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge felt timid, almost scared saying it, but he gestured between the two of them with his free hand. \u201cWhat happens with us?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Dream said in recognition. Quietly, he continued, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d George breathed. There was a stirring in his stomach, something that set all of his hairs on edge. \n\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Dream fumbled, and gestured with his free hand, \u201cIf you wanted to\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to?\u201d George prompted. He knew it was probably teasing, but he kind of enjoyed making Dream speechless. Dream had done it to him so many times, and it was fun to have the tables turned.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to date,\u201d Dream said quickly. \u201cUs. Together.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d George teased. Dream huffed impatiently and rolled his eyes, but George caught the flush of color high on his cheekbones.\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, more firmly. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen yes,\u201d George said, trying not to smile again and failing miserably, \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe sun was starting to dip, sinking lower and lower in the sky. The horizon was beginning to bleach, fading into a softer, gentler blue. George could see the fiery yellow of the sun casting long shadows over the park. It made Dream\u2019s hair lighter, and silhouetted him from the back. George couldn\u2019t stop looking at him, couldn\u2019t stop thinking, Dream, Dream, Dream.\n\n\n\u201cA date,\u201d Dream said.\n\n\n\u201cAn actual one,\u201d George agreed.\n\n\nThere was another comfortable moment of silence. George swung his legs off the edge of the monkey bars, feet dangling down, and slowly, Dream moved so that he was doing the same, even though it likely made his heart race. George felt a fierce jolt of pride and happiness in his stomach.\u00a0He squeezed Dream\u2019s hand again and Dream squeezed back. \n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d George said, \u201cAbout this date.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe could see a movie again.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge grinned. \u201cA good one this time.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd definitely without Sapnap there,\u201d Dream added. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe could go to an arcade,\u201d George said. \u201cYou can win me one of those giant stuffed animals.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOr another cafe,\u201d Dream said, \u201cAnd you can buy my drink for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOr we could just do this,\u201d George said softly. \u201cAnything works.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou know, they say anywhere is a date if you\u2019re with the right person.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d George said lightly. \u201cAnd am I that right person?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Dream said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d George said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re the right person too.\u201d\n\n\nDream glanced over at him, still holding George\u2019s hand, electricity radiating from every place they touched, and impulsively, George leaned in and kissed him.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the best kiss in the entire world\u2014 it wasn\u2019t kissing dramatically in the rain, or any other life changing event\u2014 but it was wonderful. Slowly, tentatively, as if they were both figuring it out together, Dream\u2019s free hand came up and cupped his cheek gently. When they finally separated, sharing the same breath, George couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling.\n\n\nGeorge was learning many things about himself that day; surprisingly, how forward and direct he could be, and how different that was from just a year before. A year ago he couldn\u2019t have possibly considered flirting with his crush, and being bold enough to ask him out, and he couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined having everything work out so perfectly. \n\n\nDream brought out all the best parts of him, it seemed.\u00a0\n\n\nDream leaned in and kissed him again, and George didn\u2019t miss how Dream\u2019s grip on his hand tightened slightly as he swayed, ten feet above the ground. George wanted to keep kissing him, but he kept smiling, and Dream kept smiling too, and George still couldn\u2019t believe how wonderfully everything had gone.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a minute, or ten, or an hour, or an eternity later, George dropped down from the playground. The turf underneath his feet gave slightly under his weight, and George reached out to steady himself. He looked back up at Dream and was hit with a major sense of deja vu.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to help me down again,\u201d Dream said, yet again. \u201cI\u2019m not jumping.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would catch you,\u201d George said seriously.\n\n\nDream laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re five and a half feet tall, no you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m five seven,\u201d George corrected automatically, and then glared at Dream, though he was still smiling. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re stupidly tall.\u201d\n\n\nStill, he watched and waited as Dream clambered down awkwardly, finally looking so much more comfortable on the ground.\u00a0Wordlessly, George reached out, and Dream linked their fingers together again. \n\n\nSlowly, they walked back towards George\u2019s house. It was much closer than Dream\u2019s, only a few blocks away, and their conversation flowed from one thing to the next, faster than George could keep track, but somehow they were always on the same wavelength. Before long, George reached the front porch of his house, and he unlocked the door with trepidation. The lights were on in the background, a sign that his mother was home, but she was nowhere in sight.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Dream said. He said it slowly, because it was an unspoken truth that saying those words would mean an end to the night.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d George agreed. He didn\u2019t want to close the door just yet. He didn\u2019t want the night to end. Dream seemed equally reluctant, right on the edge of George\u2019s porch. Night had fallen, at that point, and George could hear the crickets chirping quietly in the background. Everything seemed fuzzy and hazy, tinted rose-gold at the edges.\u00a0\n\n\nDream broke the silence. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he said, and gave George another honest, genuine smile. George echoed it back, and finally closed the door behind him.\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t wait to see him again.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me,\u201d Sapnap said indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d George said, and didn\u2019t even bother to hide his smile.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sapnap said, and his mouth fell open. He stared at George with wide eyes. \u201cReally? Really?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said smugly. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYears?\u201d Sapnap squeaked.\n\n\n\u201cFour of them,\u201d George declared.\n\n\nSapnap sat down with a thud. \u201cI\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d George said, \u201cI\u2019m losing my mind too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re together now?\u201d Sapnap demanded. \u201cEverything worked out?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George sighed, and found some satisfaction in the way Sapnap\u2019s eyes went as wide as dinner plates. \u201cWe\u2019re dating.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap took only a moment to register it before pumping his fist in the air in excitement. \u201cI\u2019m literally the greatest!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI doubt that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI orchestrated this whole thing,\u201d Sapnap declared. \u201cI was your wingman! I made this happen!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou really didn\u2019t,\u201d George muttered, but allowed himself to get swept up in Sapnap\u2019s enthusiasm. George was certainly happy about it, but his excitement had dimmed from the giddy, jittery exhilaration to a quiet, soothing certainty over the last few days.\n\n\n\u201cYou can say whatever you want,\u201d Sapnap said cheerfully, \u201cBut just know this is an absolute win for me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge tried not to laugh at Sapnap\u2019s antics. After a moment, Sapnap quieted down a bit. \u201cSeriously, though,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you guys.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d George said. \n\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d he insisted, \u201cBoth of you were so miserable when he turned you down, and you both seem so happy now. So clearly something worked out, because I haven\u2019t seen Clay look this happy in months.\u201d\n\n\nThat sentence made George\u2019s heart do giddy, twirling jumps in his chest. It was an odd badge of pride he wore, to make someone happy, and George liked making Dream happy. He liked seeing the slight dimples that formed when he smiled, the way his face lit up when he and George talked.\u00a0His eyes crinkled at the corners in the most beautiful way. \n\n\nAlso,\u201d Sapnap added mischievously, \u201cThe entire friend group is going to lose their shit as soon as you announce it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d George said curiously. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\nSapnap raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been pretty low key about it, right?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap stared at him for a moment in obvious disbelief, before shaking his head in dismissal. George thought he heard Sapnap mutter idiot under his breath, and George laughed and turned away.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge wasn\u2019t sure how everyone would react when Dream and George actually broke the news to them. He supposed he would find out the next morning, at lunch\u2014 he hadn\u2019t seen anyone bar Sapnap over the weekend. Both he and Dream had planned to tell them on Monday during lunch, and they would drop the ball on them then.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd the next morning, the lunch table reacted exactly as Sapnap had predicted they would\u2014 explosively.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he and Dream approached from precalculus (holding hands, George would add) the first person to notice had been Alyssa, who shouted incoherently and pointed to them. Her voice was excited and drew people\u2019s attention, and then everyone at the entire table broke into broad smiles.\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d Ponk shouted. \u201cFinally!\u201d\n\n\nSkeppy groaned and turned to Bad. \u201cHow much money do I owe you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne hundred dollars,\u201d Bad proclaimed gleefully. \u201cPay up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou guys bet on us?\u201d George asked. He and Dream took a seat next to each other, and Ponk scooted over so that they could both fit.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Skeppy said mournfully. \u201cAnd if you two had waited one week, I would be the one with a hundred dollars.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy condolences,\u201d Dream said sarcastically. \u201cNext time I\u2019ll make sure to check in with you guys before I get into a relationship.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d Alyssa asked, leaning forward in excitement. \u201cYou guys are dating?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes but felt himself go pink. \u201cYeah. We are.\u201d\n\n\nThe table dissolved into raucous cheering, and then quickly turned into good-natured ribbing on how long it took and how they could tell that George had been crushing on him\u2014\n\n\n\u201cSince the first few weeks,\u201d Alyssa declared proudly, and nudged George. \u201cI\u2019m an expert on crushes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWh\u2014 how?\u201d George spluttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know then. How can you\u2014\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa grinned slyly and turned away. \u201cLike I said. I\u2019m an expert.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI knew as soon as Halloween happened,\u201d Ponk said. \u201cWhen you fell asleep on each other.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI did not fall asleep on him,\u201d Dream said instantly, \u201cHe fell asleep on me. It was gross and not at all cute.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was adorable,\u201d Bad sighed. \u201cYou two are so cute.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sapnap said, cutting all their talking off, \u201cI was the one who knew the entire time, so I\u2019m winning here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d Skeppy said dubiously. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d George sighed regretfully, and confirmed, \u201cHe actually did know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was George\u2019s wingman,\u201d Sapnap said gleefully. The entire table groaned at once.\n\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Alyssa said in disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst wingman in the entire world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said!\u201d Dream agreed.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap rolled his eyes. \u201cYou guys just don\u2019t understand my genius.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat genius?\u201d George asked, and the entire table laughed. George looked to Dream, who squeezed his hand tightly. Dream grinned and for a second, it was just the two of them, in their own little world.\n\n\n\u201cAlright, break it up,\u201d Sapnap called, flapping his hands at them. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it PG-13, here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even doing anything,\u201d Dream muttered. His face flushed pink, the most uncomposed George had ever seen him in front of the entire group. \u201cWe\u2019re just holding hands.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Sapnap said, like it was obvious, \u201cAnd we all know where that leads, so\u2026\u201d\n\n\nDream laughed and reached over George to hit Sapnap\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, Sapnap, shut up,\u201d Skeppy called. \u201cLet them have their fun.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge laughed at their antics, and resolved himself to another half hour of it. It really was wonderful to see how happy everyone was for him and Dream. And clearly, Dream was happy about it too. He was joking along with everyone else and untroubled; not for the first time, George felt like he was living his best life.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir first \u201cdate\u201d came a few days later, right before finals struck. Dream had chosen the location, and George didn\u2019t know where he was taking him. Surprisingly, George had actually called Alyssa in a panic for what to do. Instead of laughing at him, she demanded that he put her on FaceTime and then methodically go through his entire closet. He supposed it was a little stereotypical of him to ask her, but Alyssa genuinely seemed excited to help him with it.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually he settled on a pair of black jeans and slightly nicer shoes than his everyday ones. Dream had told him that they weren\u2019t going to a restaurant, which seemed too stiff for both of them, so Alyssa assured George that a plain shirt and a \u201cnice\u201d jacket would be enough.\n\n\n\u201cJust be calm about it,\u201d she soothed him. \u201cEverything is going to go great, and you know it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d George said faintly. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd if you panic you can always text me,\u201d Alyssa promised. \u201cI\u2019m here for you!\u201d\n\n\nGeorge smiled reluctantly and checked the time; he still had fifteen minutes before Dream was due to arrive. He waved goodbye and hung up. He went into the kitchen, where his mother was waiting.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou look great,\u201d she said, and then reached a hand up to flatten down his hair. George immediately protested\u2014 he had spent so long in front of the mirror trying to style it so it was \u201cartfully messy,\u201d as Alyssa had put it. His mum was ruining all of his hard work.\u00a0\n\n\nThe doorbell rang suddenly, and George\u2019s heart jumped. He checked the time; Dream was a few minutes early, which was probably a good sign. This was the first time Dream and his mum were meeting, and George desperately hoped that they would make a good impression.\n\n\nGeorge unlocked the door. Dream was waiting outside, looking slightly nervous, but broke into the cool, confident version of himself as soon as George\u2019s mum came into view.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d Dream said, and held out a hand, \u201cI\u2019m Clay. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too,\u201d George\u2019s mother said politely, and shook his hand. George slowly released a tense breath through his teeth. So far, it looked like things were going well. Quickly, George ducked into his bedroom and grabbed his wallet, phone, and keys. As soon as Dream and his mum were done talking, George wanted to leave as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he emerged, Dream was still chatting easily, and if he was nervous, he didn\u2019t show it at all.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge checked the time, anxious to escape. \u201cMum, it\u2019s almost six, we should be going.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d She reached a hand out and smoothed down his hair one last time. \u201cYou go have fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d George said, and protectively touched his hair again, hoping she hadn\u2019t messed it up.\n\n\nThen his mum pointed a warning finger at Dream, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll treat him nicely, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt was less of a question and more of a demand, and Dream quickly said, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I always do.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge rolled his eyes and tried to duck out as hastily as possible. He was sure that his face was bright red. His mother waved them both goodbye and closed the door behind them.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSorry about my mum,\u201d George muttered, halfway down the sidewalk. \u201cShe\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\n\nDream shrugged. \u201cI like her.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d George said, \u201cYou have to say that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe really cares about you,\u201d Dream said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge shook his head fondly, and reached out to link his fingers through Dream\u2019s. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Dream said mysteriously. He reached his car\u2014 he had just gotten his license a few weeks ago, and was driving his father\u2019s grey Sedan\u2014 and unlocked it. George hopped in the passenger seat and relinked their hands over the console. Dream opened the GPS and set course for somewhere, and he mentioned that it would take around half an hour to get there. George scrolled through his own phone and picked a playlist for them to listen to.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen Dream pulled into the parking lot, George read the plaque on the outside of the building.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe Orlando Science Observatory?\u201d George said curiously.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a planetarium,\u201d Dream said. His voice was confident and nonchalant, but George heard the slight edge of uncertainty beneath it. \u201cI thought it would be nice for us to go.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThey walked up to the entrance and passed through the wide double doors; the interior of the lobby was incredible, large and domed, and in the centre of the room was a massive pendulum, swinging back and forth. Different hallways branched off, each with an obvious theme; there was a deep blue one, with the phases of the moon patterned over the archway. Another gave way to the various planets in the solar system, with miniature models of each hung up in a row; the third was cheery yellow and gold, clearly with an exhibit on the sun.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWoah,\u201d George said breathlessly, looking up at the ceiling, almost unable to form words. He hadn\u2019t been to a museum in so long, and he had never been to a planetarium before, least of all one like this. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d\n\n\nIf he had looked to the right, he would have seen Dream positively glow with pleasure. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d George said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a planetarium before, how did you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou told me,\u201d Dream said tentatively. \u201cA while ago, actually.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d George tried to remember it and came up with a small, one-off text that he had sent, so many months ago. He couldn\u2019t believe that Dream had remembered it after almost a year. \u201cThat was so long ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to take you here,\u201d Dream said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSince I said that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d The puzzle pieces finally clicked together in George\u2019s head, and he turned to Dream. \u201cYou had a crush on me for that long?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nColor flushed Dream\u2019s cheekbones, and he ducked his head. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think you did,\u201d George teased. \u201cYou like me.\u201d\n\n\nDream shook his head. \u201cI think you have the wrong person.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d George said triumphantly, \u201cYou like me. You love m\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Dream said, and tugged George along, neatly silencing him and ending the conversation. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late to the film.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThey ended up making it to the actual planetarium with a few minutes to spare, even though it was in the opposite wing of the museum. They settled into their seats, which were tilted back slightly so they could see the entirety of the domed ceiling. Eventually the theatre darkened, and the ceiling began to be speckled with stars, wide galaxies in all shades of blue, and George squeezed Dream\u2019s hand tight next to him. He leaned back further, let his eyes glaze over with indoor stars, and let the movie sweep him away.\n\n\nDream dropped him off at the door to his house a few hours later. George\u2019s mother must have been waiting for him to return, because the front lights flicked on, and she opened it as soon as George reached the front door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing him back in one piece,\u201d she said kindly to Dream, who was standing politely at the front porch.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d Dream said diplomatically. George\u2019s mum raised an eyebrow, but overall seemed mostly pleased. George ducked his head and wanted to escape inside to avoid the eventual shovel talk his mother would have to give Dream.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d George asked hesitantly, as soon as the door closed behind him. \u201cDo you approve?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGeorge, honey,\u201d his mother said, and wrapped him up in a hug so tight George could barely breathe. \u201cYou look so happy lately. He makes you happy, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s eyes suddenly felt wet, and he blinked away tears. He loved his mother to death, and even though her new job had been busy and demanding recently, he always cared about what she had to say. Even though it didn\u2019t particularly matter whether she liked Dream, at least not to George, it was still wonderful to hear.\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she said, and smoothed down George\u2019s \u201cartfully messy\u201d hair. \u201cGo get some sleep, kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid,\u201d George grumbled, as he turned away towards his room. \u201cI\u2019m an adult.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll believe you next year,\u201d she called affectionately.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge brushed his teeth, changed into a comfortable pair of pajamas, and flicked the lights off. He clambered into bed and then checked his phone. Dream was online, and George sent him a quick text.\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: im gonna go to sleep soon\n\n\ndreamwastaken: well i am going to stay up\n\n\nGeorge smiled foolishly and typed out a response.\u00a0\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: we have finals in like 2 days you need your beauty rest\n\n\ndreamwastaken: what if i told you i\u2019m studying\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: \u2026 i might actually believe you\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: but u should go to sleep, i\u2019m sleeping too\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: i will\u00a0\n\n\ndreamwastaken: goodnight!! &lt;3\n\n\ngeorgenotfound: &lt;33\n\n\nGeorge shut his phone off and stared at the ceiling in the darkness. Soft nighttime light filtered through the curtains on his window. He couldn\u2019t quite place a name to the light, hopeful feeling inside of him, but he liked it. He wanted to keep the memory of this night close to him, clutched to his heart.\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\nGeorge marched out of his final class, fairly certain that he had scored above an eighty percent on his Spanish exam, and thrilled that the first semester of his junior year was over. The hallways were filled with students who had all completed their last final, and everyone was raucous and enthusiastic about the start of winter break. George went to his locker and thankfully, dumped all of his textbooks in there\u2014 he wouldn\u2019t need any of them until January. For now, he had three weeks to do absolutely nothing except relax.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge found Dream waiting outside of his sixth period class. \n\n\n\u201cFinished?\u201d he called, and Dream turned. Every time he saw George, Dream always gave him this little smile\u2014 probably unnoticeable to anyone else, but George relished the look of it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFinally done,\u201d Dream said, relieved. \u201cI probably screwed up my essay, but at least it\u2019s over. How was your Spanish final?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI forgot so much vocabulary,\u201d George groaned. \u201cI\u2019m sure I got at least a B, though. I guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Dream said conversationally, \u201cAny plans for winter break?\u201d\n\n\nGeorge pretended to think. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe hanging out with my boyfriend and playing Minecraft all day.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDream huffed a small laugh, and grabbed George\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on then, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\n\nThe lunch table by the courtyard was nearly filled; everyone was there except for Dream and George. Sapnap was saying something wildly, gesturing with his hands, and George caught snatches of his words as he arrived at the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSpring semester is where I shine,\u201d Sapnap was saying, rubbing his hands together. \u201cYou thought I was bad now? Oh, I can\u2019t wait for my senior prank.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a junior,\u201d Ponk said dryly.\u00a0\n\n\nSapnap grinned roguishly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t get suspended,\u201d Bad said anxiously.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Sapnap said confidently. \u201cI\u2019m too good for that. Remember that time I stole the entire school supply of\u2014\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge stopped listening to their conversation so he could have plausible deniability, and instead turned to Dream. \u201cAre we doing anything tonight?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think everyone wants to have a movie night,\u201d Dream said vaguely.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAt Ponk\u2019s house,\u201d Alyssa jumped in. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the end of the semester.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCelebrating us failing all our finals?\u201d George said dryly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlyssa waved his comment off. \u201cYou two have to come, it\u2019s mandatory.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOnly if we\u2019re watching a good movie,\u201d Dream said.\n\n\nAlyssa\u2019s smile was positively devilish. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll be watching a good movie,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cWhy do I not believe that,\u201d George sighed.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be watching all the sappiest rom-coms,\u201d Alyssa continued.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d George mused, and turned to Dream, \u201cMaybe we have something else to do, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\nDream pretended to ponder with him. \u201cYeah, didn\u2019t we have plans?\u201d\n\n\nAlyssa laughed, and shook her head fondly. \u201cYou guys are such idiots. We\u2019ll watch a good movie, and we\u2019ll count your vote as one.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNot fair,\u201d Dream said, \u201cWe deserve separate votes.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAlyssa scoffed. \u201cWhen you end up voting separately, we\u2019ll consider it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nLater that night, George and Dream arrived at Ponk\u2019s house together. They claimed one of the beanbag chairs in the corner and curled up together; George ended up resting his head on Dream\u2019s chest, while one of Dream\u2019s hands threaded gently through his hair. The other one of his hands was holding onto George\u2019s, right over his stomach. Bad mimed taking a picture of them and George turned away, holding a hand out and hiding his face in mock embarrassment.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching High School Musical,\u201d Skeppy announced, \u201cAnd no one\u2019s allowed to argue.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo one was planning on arguing anyway,\u201d Ponk said. Alyssa sat up excitedly and rubbed her hands together; apparently, this was one of her favorite movies. Skeppy inserted the DVD and reached for the remote to press play.\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge looked around and took in everyone\u2019s faces, bright and shiny and happy. Alyssa was singing along dramatically to the music onscreen, knowing the lyrics perfectly and acting along, while Sapnap laughed hysterically at her from the corner. Ponk was sitting on one end of the sofa, a bowl of popcorn in between his legs, and Skeppy was methodically throwing M&amp;Ms into the air and trying to catch them in his mouth. At one point, he gave up and started tossing them towards Bad, who was somehow even worse at catching them. Dream chuckled quietly at them, and George laughed too. It was such a wonderful night.\n\n\nHe had Dream, and he had Clay, who had ended up being one and the same. He had Sapnap and Bad and Ponk and Alyssa and Skeppy, some of the best friends he\u2019d had in his entire life. He had one winter break ahead of him, to be shared with his friends. He had an entire spring semester, and one prom. He had so much to look forward to, and so much behind him.\n\n\nYeah, George thought privately. It was going to be a good year.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
