    "text": "\nbreath\n\n[breth]\u00a0\n\nnoun\n1. the\u00a0air\u00a0inhaled\u00a0and\u00a0exhaled\u00a0in\u00a0respiration.\n2. respiration,\u00a0especially\u00a0as\u00a0necessary\u00a0to\u00a0life.\n3. life;\u00a0vitality.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi thinks that it's far too early for such bullshit. Honestly, it's not even ten in the morning, he should be in bed right now, not getting dressed to meet a customer. Yoongi's customers know that business doesn't start until noon, so why even bother? But of course, Yoongi also knows that in this particular case he doesn't really have a choice.\nAs a drug lord, Yoongi knows the rules:\n-you don't ask questions;\n-whatever the client wants, you sell it;\n-you don't do loans;\n-you don't fall in love with a customer's whore.\nThose rules applied even harder when the client is Wen Gao.\nWen Gao is a fucking asshole, one of the worst humans that ever stepped on planet Earth, but he's got money. It happens when you're one of the most influential arms dealer of the country. Besides, isn't Gao one of his best clients? He might be scum, but he's rich scum.\nSo Yoongi makes an effort in looking at least decent, going as far as to wash his face with cold water and even comb his hair. With his fingers because no one has time to actually use a brush. Does he even own a brush? He might need to check.\nYoongi finds a white t-shirt scattered on the floor and since it doesn't smell bad he decides that's good enough for the day. He shrugs on a pair of jeans and finds his leather jacket and calls it a day. Gao might be rich scum but he's not rich scum that Yoongi needs to impress.\nAs he leaves his comfortably dark room he's welcomed with way too much light. Yoongi sighs and rubs his fingers on his eyes, trying to get accustomed to the sudden brightness. Seokjin must have done something with the shutters as they're all up, letting the sunlight hit the penthouse.\n\u201cFucking windows.\u201d Yoongi mutters, making his way to the kitchen counter \u201cFucking penthouse basically made of fucking glass.\u201d\nYoongi finds some coffee still in the jug from the night before and decides that he's too lazy to actually make fresh one, so he fills a mug and shoves it rather brutally in the microwave.\nHe checks his phone. Five minutes to ten. So fucking early. The microwave starts beeping and Yoongi takes the warm cup of coffee, taking a generous sip and sighing contently. Now he can start thinking of business.\nThe intercom suddenly rings, startling Yoongi who almost loses his grip on his precious mug. After a muttered curse, the man goes to the intercom and answers it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSir, Wen Gao is here for you.\u201d\nYoongi frowns at the voice. It's thursday, so it must be Mike at the lobby, right? Then why is his voice so different? No, wait, Mike works in the afternoon, so this must be...\n\u201cLet him in, Nate.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\nGao is early. Yoongi hates people who are early, it's absolutely inconsiderate.\nHe leans with his back to his desk and waits for Gao to arrive, drinking his coffee slowly and savouring the taste. This was going to be a long day and he had just started.\nAfter a few minutes, someone knocks on the door and Yoongi goes to open it.\nWen Gao is a middle aged man who is very close to be considered a senior citizen, a belly that is large because of too many beers and too much food, small black eyes and a few hair left, grey, that he still refuses to just cut off even though they make him look ridiculous. All in all, Wen Gao looks absolutely mundane, if not hideous. But his suit is hand-made, his shoes italian, his rolex heavy and his bank account fatter than him.\n\u201cMin! It's good to see you!\u201d the man exclaims, making his way inside the penthouse as Yoongi stands beck to let him in.\n\u201cGao, it's good to see you too.\u201d Yoongi makes to close the door but Gao stops him.\n\u201cI brought someone with me, I hope it's not an inconvenience.\u201d he explains \u201cHe was looking for a place to smoke, a balcony or something.\u201d\nYoongi nods.\n\u201cHe can smoke here.\u201d he says \u201cI don't mind.\u201d\n\u201cI'll go fetch him, then.\u201d\nYoongi goes to his couch and sits heavily, stopping himself from yawning loudly. Why would he bring someone else and not even tell him beforehand? Asshole.\nGao comes back a few moments later, an arm snaked around someone's waist, and he closes the door.\nYoongi doesn't look at them as he searches for his own pack of cigarettes in the pockets of his jacket. When he finds it he takes one out and puts it between his lips, lighting it up immediately and letting out a lungful of smoke.\n\u201cPlease, sit. Can I offer you anything?\u201d Yoongi asks, gesturing for the two armchairs in front of the couch.\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Gao says as he sits down \u201cPeach, do you want something?\u201d\nPeach? At that, Yoongi decides to spare a glance at whoever it is Gao brought with him. He ends up staring. \u201cPeach\u201d, if that's his real name, is a boy. Short but build, small hands with expensive rings adorning his fingers and the prettiest face Yoongi has ever seen on a boy.\nThis must be Gao's new toy.\nPeach doesn't speak, there's a cigarette hanging from his lips, he looks at Yoongi's lighter.\n\u201cNeed a light?\u201d he asks, lifting his lighter up.\nPeach leans down to it, Yoongi can now see how full and plump his lips look, how pretty his eyes are under the heavy kohl. Fuck, he's not just pretty, the kid is a work of art. And he shouts \u201cexpensive\u201d from every pore.\nYoongi click the lighter and the flame comes out, lighting up Peach's cigarette. The boy holds his gaze for a second, locks of pink hair covering messily his brow, then he stands back straight and goes to sit on the arm rest, next to Gao. The man holds an arm around his waist, a gesture that looks so possessive it's almost hilarious.\n\u201cHe's new.\u201d Gao says \u201cGot him a few days ago.\u201d\nYoongi hums. \u201cDoes he speak?\u201d\n\u201cOnly when I ask him to.\u201d Gao's smile is wry \u201cPeach, say hello to mister Min.\u201d\nPeach smiles, it doesn't reach his eyes.\n\u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d he says, voice light and sweet.\n\u201cBe respectful, Peach, you can't just call him Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cIt's fine, don't really care.\u201d Yoongi inhales some smoke \u201cYou brought him here to brag?\u201d\nGao lets out a small laugh \u201cI'm showing him off. After all, I take pride in him. He's a korean like you. Isn't he a beauty?\u201d\nPeach cocks his head to the side.\n\u201cI guess he is.\u201d Yoongi concedes.\nGao nods.\n\u201cYou're no fun, Min.\u201d\n\u201cI've been told that.\u201d Yoongi sits back more comfortably \u201cShould we get down to business? I'm busy today.\u201d\nGao's face turns serious.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d he says as he slips a hand in the pocket of his tailored jacket, taking a piece of paper out and putting it on the small coffee table in front of him \u201cHere's my order for the week.\u201d\nYoongi takes the paper and unfolds it, eyeing it for a few seconds.\n\u201cThere's more stuff than usual.\u201d he says \u201cYou want more Valium than last week. Heroin's the same as usual. Morphine?\u201d Yoongi looks up at Gao.\n\u201cI have a man that's been shot pretty badly.\u201d Gao says \u201cWe patched him up, but the pain makes him useless and I need him active.\u201d\nYoongi shrugs. \u201cDon't get pissed if he turns into a fucking junkie later on.\u201d\n\u201cI sure hope he becomes a junkie.\u201d Gao licks his lips \u201cJunkies are easy to order around, you have too much leverage on them, they become puppets.\u201d\nYoongi can't say Gao's completely wrong.\n\u201cYou'll get your stuff tomorrow night, usual place.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cUsual hour.\u201d\n\u201cPayment's method?\u201d\n\u201cSame as always, don't leave tracks.\u201d\n\u201cWhen do I ever?\u201d\nYoongi wants to say that he can name a few instances, but decides to stay quiet.\n\u201cActually, Min, I didn't bring Peach here just to show him off.\u201d\nYoongi arches an eyebrow and shifts his attention on the boy. He looks way too at ease, sitting on that arm rest like he owns it, eyes confidently staring at him. At least he's using one of the ashtrays he found on the coffee table instead of letting the ash fall on the ground.\n\u201cFrom next week, Peach will be the one who places the orders.\u201d\nYoongi frowns. Gao was going to send his fucking boy toy to place drug orders?\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI'll be real busy starting tomorrow.\u201d Gao clears his voice, his hand sliding up and down Peach's side, lifting his t-shirt a little and showing tanned skin \u201cThere's a huge deal coming. A massive order of weapons for really special customers. It will last for a while, it's a partnership that will take all of my time and attention. Can't waste time placing orders.\u201d\n\u201cWhy him? Why not one of your men?\u201d\nAt that, Gao actually laughs genuinely, Peach smiling a little as well.\n\u201cFuck, Min, you can't trust men like mine to deal with drugs. Most of them are fucking junkies! But Peach, here... he doesn't like drugs. Not the heavy ones. And he doesn't know the coding we use. Don't worry, Min, Peach will just bring the order to you, then Alec will come and take the drugs at usual. He knows how to deal with them, how to bring them where they need to be... but I wouldn't trust him with the order. It's easy to change something so that he orders more and keeps some for him.\u201d\nYoongi realizes that Gao is right. Once the order is placed no one would actually know if someone had added something. That's the thing about being able to not leave tracks, things are fucking easy to bend at someone's will. The important part was that little piece of paper, not the actual merch.\n\u201cFine.\u201d Yoongi says, smoke coming out of his nostrils \u201cI'll inform the lobby to let him in, he'll have to give them a picture.\u201d\n\u201cI love taking pictures.\u201d Peach says, his cigarette burns out and he stomps it in the ashtray.\nYoongi sighs. \u201cIs Peach even his name?\u201d\nGao smirks.\n\u201cIt is now. We should go, shouldn't we? We took too much time from mister Min anyway.\u201d Gao stands up and Yoongi follows suit, Peach standing up as well, straightening his shirt down \u201cYou've been very good, baby. Do you want a reward?\u201d\nPeach makes a sound that very much resembles a purr.\n\u201cI want new rings.\u201d\n\u201cI'll buy an entire jewelry if that's what you want.\u201d Gao turns to Yoongi \u201cI guess I'll see you once I find some time. In the meantime, enjoy Peach's presence.\u201d\nYoongi finds it wise to not say that he will. It's clear that Gao really likes this new one. The previous one was cute as well, well behaved and quiet, but Gao never gave him this much attention. Yoongi knows better than making one of his best clients jealous.\nYoongi guides them to the exit, opening the door for them. Peach turns around before they disappear outside.\n\u201cI'll see you soon, Yoongi.\u201d he says with an amused smile.\nYoongi nods and bids his goodbyes, closing the door and waiting for a few seconds before sighing.\nIt's not even half past ten but he already wants to crawl back to bed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe're getting a new stash of opiates next week. Heroin mostly, hydrocodone too.\u201d Namjoon crosses his legs \u201cPills are coming soon as well. Seokjin will take care of 'em.\u201d\n\u201cCosts?\u201d Yoongi asks.\n\u201cNot more than usual.\u201d\n\u201cGood, we lost a client last week, don't want to lose incomes.\u201d\n\u201cWhich client?\u201d\n\u201cWasn't it Alvarez?\u201d Hoseok chimes in the conversation, filling a glass with water from Yoongi's kitchen \u201cOwner of those clubs.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it's him.\u201d Yoongi sniffs \u201cHe got shot.\u201d\n\u201cTough shit.\u201d Namjoon says.\n\u201cKinda asked for it. The idiot tried to get his hands on the woman of a mob boss.\u201d\n\u201cDefinetely asked for it, then.\u201d Namjoon stands up from the chair and ruffles his blond hair \u201cThere should be no loss, though, I've been checking. We're going steady as ever.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Yoongi lets out a breath \u201cThen we're done for today. What time is it?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost time to order some fucking take out.\u201d Hoseok says \u201cI'm fucking starving.\u201d\n\u201cI'm feeling italian.\u201d Namjoon gives Yoongi a look \u201cItalian?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yoongi takes his jacket off and tosses it without a care on the floor, smoothing the t-shirt with the palm of his hands.\nHoseok calls the usual italian restaurant and the three men sit on the couch together, lazily looking at whatever bad tv-show that was on in that moment without really paying attention as they wait for their food.\n\u201cWhat's this story that Gao bought some fresh meat?\u201d Hoseok asks.\n\u201cYeah, it's his new toy.\u201d Yoongi answers, scratching his knee \u201cGao calls him peach.\u201d\n\u201cPeach? The fuck?\u201d Namjoon shakes his head \u201cIs he cute?\u201d\n\u201cCute?\u201d Yoongi smiles \u201cThat kid's probably the prettiest thing I've ever laid my eyes on. You should see him, he's a fucking masterpiece. All perfect lips and smiles, he's dangerous as hell. Can't be older than twenty.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d Hoseok chuckles \u201cGao, that old sick fuck, always taking 'em young. He probably can't even get it up with all the shit he snorts.\u201d\nNamjoon lets out a low laugh, quiet and pleasurable as always.\n\u201cFucking Gao, thinks he's a hot blooded american when he's chinese. He's fucking asian like us, thinks he's better than us because he thinks he can fool people into believing he wasn't born in Chengdu.\u201d Yoongi shakes his head \u201cThat man can't even hide his fucking accent.\u201d\n\u201cHe tries to sound like he's from Texas.\u201d Namjoon says \u201cHe sounds like a chinese trying too hard to sound like he's not from China.\u201d\n\u201cIf he can't get it up with that kid then he's really a finished man.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cWonder what happened to the last one. What was his name again?\u201d\n\u201cDon't know.\u201d Namjoon replies \u201cDon't want to know what happened to him either.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise of agreement. \u201cPeach will be placing the orders from now on, Gao's too busy with a new deal.\u201d\n\u201cIs it big?\u201d\n\u201cApparently.\u201d Yoongi looks at Namjoon \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt's always good to keep tabs on our client's affairs. We don't wanna deal with broke assholes if something goes bad. Still, if he's sending a new toy it means he's reliable. Or that Gao trusts him, at least.\u201d\nThere's silence for a while, the buzzing of the tv keeping them distracted, before Hoseok speaks.\n\u201cWell, would you look at us.\u201d he murmurs \u201cThree strapping young lads, talking about a client's bitch whilst waiting for cheap italian food. Aren't we living the dream? God bless America.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe week goes by and Yoongi doesn't have to bark orders too much, doesn't have to threaten anyone and doesn't have to break teeth. Which means that it has been a good week.\nThursday arrives and with it Peach arrives as well.\nIt's four in the afternoon when the intercom buzzes and Mike informs him that \u201cGao's man is here\u201d, so Yoongi instructs him to let him through.\nWhen he opens the door he doesn't expect to be greeted with a flash of white teeth and a bright smile.\n\u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d Peach immediately gets inside, not bothering waiting for Yoongi to step back and he almost bounces his way to the couch.\n\u201cSomeone's taking liberties.\u201d Yoongi says, no real bite in his words.\n\u201cI always do.\u201d he says, pulling his pink hair back from his forehead \u201cThat's why everyone likes me.\u201d\n\u201cI don't.\u201d\n\u201cYou'll learn to.\u201d\nYoongi sighs.\n\u201cDo you want anything? Something to drink?\u201d\n\u201cTea!\u201d Peach exclaims rather cheerfully \u201cDo you have tea?\u201d\nYoongi nods and goes to the kitchen, starts the boiler and waits for the water to be ready.\nHe gives Peach a quick look, the boy still sitting on the couch with his legs crossed and an amused smile stretching his lips.\n\u201cGao said you're korean.\u201d\nThe boy nods. \u201cI was born in Busan. Apparently.\u201d\n\u201cApparently?\u201d\nHe shrugs. \u201cDon't remeber much from those times.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak korean?\u201d\n\u201cNot even a word. I probably used to, though. Can't remember.\u201d\nYoongi decides not to inquire.\n\u201cDo you speak korean, Yoongi?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Yoongi takes the boiler and fills a mug with hot water, preparing the boy's tea \u201cI was born and raised there.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't have an accent.\u201d\n\u201cHad to make it disappear.\u201d\nPeach doesn't ask other questions, Yoongi goes to him and hands him the mug, the boy mutters a thank you and keeps the cup between his hands with a content smile.\nAs Yoongi sits on one of the armchairs, he realizes that Peach isn't just a pretty boy, he's fucking beautiful. Crazily enough, there's a sort of naive aura around him.\n\u201cThe order.\u201d Peach takes a piece of paper from the back pocket of his ripped jeans and tosses it on the coffee table, sipping blissfully at his tea.\nYoongi takes it and examines it. It doesn't look like someone tried to change anything, the handwriting is definetely Gao's and Yoongi would recognize that deep blue ink everywhere. The order is real and untouched, the coding message they use for the products is spotless.\n\u201cGood. Tell Alec that it's the usual spot and usual time.\u201d\nPeach nods, then he frowns. \u201cDo I... do I leave now, or...?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I ain't kickin you out.\u201d Yoongi replies \u201cFinish your tea or whatever.\u201d\nPeach seems to relax visibly at his words, and he slumps deeper in the couch.\n\u201cGood, 'cause I'm bored out of my mind when owner isn't home.\u201d\nThe boy's words are processed rather slowly by Yoongi's brain. When he does understand what he has just said, however, Yoongi tries his best to not let his discomfort show.\n\u201cOwner?\u201d Yoongi asks.\n\u201cThat's what he wants me to call him.\u201d Peach replies, completely unfazed.\n\nThat's creepy. That's fucking creepy.\n\n\u201cWhat's your name, kid?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, Peach.\u201d he pouts, as if he couldn't get any cuter \u201cAlso, don't call me kid. I might not look like it, but I'm twenty two.\u201d\nHe looks way younger.\n\u201cPeach isn't your real name.\u201d\n\u201cIt's the name I have now.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not calling you peach when you're here.\u201d Yoongi says, voice firm. That's the voice he uses with his men when they fuck up. The boy in front of him doesn't even flinch. \u201cWhat's your real name? I'll call you with that when we're alone.\u201d\nThe pink haired boy stays quiet for what feels like minutes, the tea in his mug slowly cooling down. He holds his gaze with no trace of fear or intimidation. Then, he finally speaks.\n\u201cJimin.\u201d\nYoongi nods.\n\u201cThat's a name I can use.\u201d\nJimin tilts his head.\n\u201cOwner says you're dangerous. One of the most dangerous men he's ever met. You don't look dangerous.\u201d Jimin drinks some tea \u201cWhich is probably what makes you dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't look like you're scared of me.\u201d\n\u201cShould I?\u201d\nYoongi considers it for a while.\n\u201cNo.\u201d he finally says.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jimin looks around himself \u201cI like this place. Owner's house is bigger, but not much light comes in. Shutters are almost always down.\u201d\nYoongi makes a mental note to always leave the shutters up and the windows wide open when Jimin is here. He doesn't know why and he decides to not dwell on it.\n\u201cI should go now.\u201d Jimin says, gulping down the rest of his tea \u201cI want to go check a new shop, I like the clothes there. I know where the exit is.\u201d\nYoongi stands up to walk him to the door anyway. \u201cI'll see you next thursday, Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Jimin opens the door and, before he steps out, he says \u201cYou're cute, Yoongi, but you need to get some sun on your skin, you look like a ghost.\u201d\nThen he leaves, smile on his lips and lightness in his steps.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm too old for this shit, Yoons.\u201d Seokjin whines, his head lolling and his body slumped on the sofa.\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Yoongi asks, not really listening and staring at the orders on his laptop.\n\u201cYes. My joints hurt. My back hurts. Hell, even my kidneys hurt.\u201d\nYoongi hums.\n\u201cToo much fatigue. Lifting those packages is so tiring.\u201d\n\u201cJin, you don't even lift a single gram of those boxes, the\nworkers do, you just look at them.\u201d\nSeokjin snaps his eyes open, staring at Yoongi as if he had just spat on his dog.\n\u201cMin Yoongi, I feel their fatigue, I sense it, and therefore it is my fatigue too! Hell, yesterday Shane had in his arms so much cocaine, it must have been so heavy.\u201d he sighs \u201cI felt a crack in my spine just by looking at him.\u201d\nYoongi chuckles and Jin seems satisfied, so he goes back to closing his eyes and resting on Yoongi's couch.\n\u201cI've seen Peach last thursday.\u201d Jin suddenly says.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, as he was leaving the building. He introduced himself to me, he was so cute.\u201d Jin sighs \u201cAbsolutely adorable.\u201d\nYoongi hums.\n\u201cHis name ain't Peach, you know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat's his real name?\u201d\n\u201cJimin.\u201d\n\u201cThat's a nice name. He's too cute for his own good, all pretty smiles and perfect face.\u201d Jin smile falls quickly \u201cSuch a shame, really.\u201d\nYoongi lifts his eyes from his desktop and focuses on Jin. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt's a shame that a boy as sweet as him is Gao's.\u201d Jin's voice is low \u201cA shit like Gao doesn't deserve him.\u201d\nYoongi frowns. Sure, Gao is an old man who has more blood on his hands than Yoongi can even imagine, but he seems to treasure Jimin.\n\u201cIt looks like he takes good care of him, though.\u201d Yoongi says and Jin's lips turn down, his expression one of disgust.\n\u201cFor now.\u201d he mutters \u201cI know some real dark shit about Gao.\u201d\n\u201cWhat shit?\u201d\nJin turns to look at him. \u201cDo you know what happened to his last toy?\u201d\nYoongi shrugs.\n\u201cGao's toys are under contract, right?\u201d he asks, Jin nods \u201cThen the contract expired. I'm guessing.\u201d\nJin sends him a sad look as he takes a deep breath.\n\u201cNo, the contract didn't expire. But in a way, it did.\u201d the man shifts his attention to the ceiling \u201cGao broke his last toy.\u201d\nYoongi ignores the shiver down his spine. He already knows what Jin means, but he finds himself asking the question anyway.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe broke him.\u201d Jin repeats \u201cGao killed the last one with a bullet in the skull.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThursday comes, the weather starts getting chiller, winter slowly making its way through. When Yoongi opens the door for Jimin, the boy looks almost ethereal, a relaxed smile on his lips and a soft looking huge sweater keeping him warm.\n\u201cHello Yoongi!\u201d Jimin comes inside and immediately goes straight for the couch \u201cCan I smoke?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yoongi replies and he decides to sit on the couch as well, keeping a discreet distance from Jimin.\nHe's not wearing make up today. Yoongi decides he looks better without it.\nJimin takes two cigarettes and offers one to Yoongi, who takes it and lights it up, doing the same for Jimin.\n\u201cHere's the order.\u201d Jimin says, giving him the usual piece of paper. Yoongi reads it for a few seconds.\n\u201cStill morphine?\u201d\nJimin nods.\n\u201cThe guy that was shot is already addicted. Is it possible? To get addicted so quickly?\u201d\n\u201cWith morphine? Yes.\u201d Yoongi replies, sliding the piece of paper in his pocket \u201cMorphine is one of the worst. You link it with the loss of pain so when you don't take it your brain reminds you that you should be in pain.\u201d\nJimin nods.\n\u201cI don't like drugs.\u201d he says, breathing out some smoke \u201cNot the really hard ones. They're scary.\u201d\n\u201cThey are.\u201d Yoongi agrees.\n\u201cOwner uses the drug to keep his men loyal. Turns them into junkies. I'm surrounded by zombies there.\u201d Jimin sighs \u201cIt's so boring when owner isn't home. That's why I'm happy when I come here, at least I have an excuse to go out and do something. And you're not a zombie.\u201d Jimin looks at him \u201cDo you take drugs?\u201d\nYoongi snorts. \u201cI'm not fucking stupid kid, I'm clean of that shit.\u201d\nJimin smiles softly, features lighting up. He looks frail. He looks easy to break. Yoongi remembers Jin's words.\n\u201cHow is Gao? I mean with you, how does he treat you?\u201d\nJimin lets some ash fall in the ashtray before he answers.\n\u201cHe spoils the fuck out of me. I guess he treats me well. It's not bad, probably the best job I ever had. He gives me so much money I almost don't know what to do with it, I can buy whatever I want.\u201d\nYoongi hums and guesses that that's probably all a guy like Jimin actually needs. The boy looks like he really enjoys owning expensive stuff, Yoongi can't exactly blame him.\n\u201cBesides, Owner can barely get it up.\u201d\nYoongi chokes on a lungful of smoke under Jimin's amused look.\n\u201cShit.\u201d Yoongi croaks and Jimin giggles.\n\u201cToo much information?\u201d\n\u201cA little, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it's true. I'm not surprised, with all the shit he takes. Heroin especially. He either can't get it up and, when he can, he can barely keep it up. So, yeah, it's one of the best jobs I ever had.\u201d\nYoongi concedes him a smile. Well, Jimin clearly doesn't have a problem in admitting that Gao is disgusting.\n\u201cI hate it when he snorts cocaine off me, though. That shit makes him hard as wood.\u201d\nYoongi frowns at his words, sitting a little straighter on the couch.\n\u201cOff you?\u201d\nJimin nods, stomping the cigarette in the ashtray.\n\u201cHe likes to snort it from my thighs. Owner loves it, really, he even takes pictures of the coke's stripes before he snorts them. Don't really blame him, I got nice legs.\u201d\nYoongi didn't realize he was holding his breath until he inhales and his throat hurts.\n\u201cI don't like it when you call him owner.\u201d he says \u201cIt's creepy.\u201d\nJimin shrugs. \u201cIt's what he wants me to call him.\u201d\n\u201cDon't call him that when you're here. Really, it's gonna give me fucking nightmares.\u201d\nJimin looks at him for a few seconds, his gaze heavy with something that Yoongi can't recognize.\n\u201cThen what should I call him?\u201d\n\u201cCall him with his name or whatever.\u201d\nThe moment Yoongi says it Jimin visibly stiffens and now Yoongi knows what it is he saw in his eyes: fear.\n\u201cI can't call him with his name, Yoongi.\u201d Jimin whispers.\nYoongi gulps and nods. That was stupid of him. He's forgetting one thing: if Jimin calls Gao \u201cowner\u201d, it's because Gao literally owns him.\n\u201cNo, you're right. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay. It's not like I enjoy calling him owner.\u201d Jimin grimaces \u201cDon't... tell him I said that.\u201d\n\u201cI won't. I won't tell him a single thing you tell me when you're here.\u201d Yoongi smiles when he sees Jimin relaxing \u201cStill, there's no way I'll hear the word \u201cowner\u201d one more time. Pick a nickname or something.\u201d\nJimin squints his eyes, clearly giving it some thought.\n\u201cHow do you call an older person in korean? Just... a plain, mundane older person.\u201d\nYoongi can feel the corner of his mouth curling up in a satisfied smile.\n\u201cAjussi.\u201d he replies.\n\u201cThat's how I'll call him when I'm with you, then. Ajussi.\u201d he says it as if he's tasting the way the word is on his tongue \u201cI like it. I like spending time with you.\u201d\nYoongi arches an eyebrow. \u201cYou like spending time with a druglord?\u201d\n\u201cYou're nice. And kind.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't know me, Jimin. Kind is not a word that people use when they talk about me.\u201d\nYoongi almost feels shame if he thinks that Jimin finds him \u201ckind\u201d. Yoongi is a criminal, Yoongi has done things so shady and dark that sometimes they still haunt him in his sleep. Just like Gao, Yoongi has blood on his hands and broken families on his conscience.\nAnd yet, Jimin just smiles and this time it's different. This time his smile is real and warm, his eyes turn into crescents, almost disappearing and he looks like a kid.\n\u201cYoongi, trust me, you're kind.\u201d Jimin stands up \u201cI should go, the driver's waiting for me.\u201d\nYoongi walks with him to the door and opens it for him, Jimin slips out his penthouse still wearing that smile.\n\u201cI'll see you next thursday, Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi nods, Jimin leaves.\nWhen Yoongi closes the door behind the boy, the penthouse suddenly looks too big for him alone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll the stashes were dispatched.\u201d Taehyung says, his head resting on Jungkook's lap and his legs sprawled all over his couch. Yoongi feels like he bought a couch that is way too comfortable since everyone feels entitled to just use it as they want.\n\u201cNo problems?\u201d Yoongi asks, going through some papers.\n\u201cJust a guy. What was his name again?\u201d Taehyung asks Jungkook.\n\u201cMiles.\u201d the boy replies, rubbing circles with his thumb on Taehyung's wrist \u201cHe's late with a payment. Didn't have enough money.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he buy?\u201d Yoongi asks.\nJungkook shrugs. \u201cNothing big, just some pills. He swore he'll pay the total amount next time.\u201d\n\u201cHow much money does he owe us?\u201d\n\u201cA hundred bucks.\u201d\nYoongi nods.\n\u201cGive him a week, if next time he's still short of money break a finger or something.\u201d\nJungkook makes a military salute. \u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d\n\u201cKookie likes breaking fingers.\u201d Taehyung says rather cheerfully.\n\u201cNo, I don't.\u201d Jungkook retorts with a pout \u201cBut you hate it, so someone has to do it.\u201d\nTaehyung coos at him, pinching Jungkook's cheek and making the younger boy blush.\nYoongi sighs. Taehyung and Jungkook are his best runners, but sometimes he wishes they weren't. They're young and stupidly in love, the fear that Jungkook will do something stupid or rushed is always in the back of his mind, distracting him more than he likes to admit.\nYoongi likes those two, he'd go as far as to say that he considers them his younger brothers. He doesn't like having them in the streets, but he has no choice. Taehyung is pretty enough to not raise suspicions on the streets, Jungkook is young enough to not earn a policeman's attention.\n\u201cOh, more importantly!\u201d Taehyung looks at Yoongi \u201cWe met Jimin last thursday!\u201d\nYoongi raises an eyebrow. Goddamn, Jimin had one hell of a timing if everyone managed to meet him as he's leaving.\n\u201cGood for you.\u201d\n\u201cDidn't it feel like he was buying time?\u201d Taehyung asks Jungkook \u201cLike he was stalling.\u201d\nThe younger boy nods. \u201cHe was leaning on his car, smoking. The driver was clearly impatient and wanted to leave, but Jimin was ignoring him. When he saw us he asked if we knew you and when we said that we did he started talking to us. Told us his name and everything.\u201d Jungkook pauses \u201cHe's funny, isn't he?\u201d\nTaehyung vigorously nods.\n\u201cHe's funny and adorable. So cute.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone seems to find him adorable.\u201d Yoongi mutters.\n\u201cThat's because he is. He's... charming?\u201d Tae looks up at Jungkook \u201cDefinetely charming.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise that could be either of irritation or agreement. He doesn't know, he decides he also doesn't care.\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d Jungkook asks \u201cI'm curious. He's Gao's new toy and he's reliable enough that Gao trusts him with the order placement. So how is he?\u201d\nYoongi lifts his eyes from the files he was examinating and looks at Jungkook for a few seconds.\n\u201cHe's... noisy.\u201d\nTaehyung frowns \u201cNoisy?\u201d\n\u201cHe speaks a lot.\u201d Yoongi pauses \u201cI think he's bored. Or lonely. Probably both.\u201d\nTaehyung hums, tapping his fingers on his knees.\n\u201cI think he's the kind of person who gets attached to people real quick. Especially if they treat him nicely.\u201d he says and Jungkook starts combing his hair with his fingers \u201cWhich is bad enough as it is, but with Gao... shit, I'm worried.\u201d\nYoongi sighs. \u201cYou don't know him, being worried is useless.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do know him, we spoke.\u201d Tae retorts \u201cAnd I relate to him. I was like him once.\u201d\nYoongi lowers his gaze. That's true, Tae was exactly like Jimin. For sale.\n\u201cBefore Kookie found me I was exactly like him.\u201d he continues, Jungkook smiles at him \u201cAnd I know for a fact that if he doesn't try to get out of the business quickly he'll end up in the streets. He's too spoiled to survive in the streets. I don't blame him, I mean, I was spoiled too. But my employers and stuff weren't like Gao, it was easier for me.\nAt that, Yoongi looks back at Taehyung, curiosity lighting up inside of him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cOh, right, you don't know.\u201d Jungkook says \u201cGao tried to buy Taehyung. Right?\u201d\nTaehyung nods.\n\u201cI was... fifteen, maybe. I remember I was really fucking young, I had a sugar daddy back then and we were in Toronto for a gala. I was walking around when Gao approached me and asked me if he could put me under contract for a year. Told him I already had a contract, he tried to convince me saying he was going to pay me way more than my current owner did.\u201d Taehyung grimaces and shifts uncomfortably on the couch \u201cI remember how weird I felt when he said owner. He said it like he truly meant it. That's when my sugar daddy came and said that no fucking way he was going to give me up. Later that evening he told me that, in the future, if I was in need of another sugar daddy it would have been wise not to choose Gao. \u201cAnyone is better than that sick fuck\u201d, he said.\u201d\nYoongi lets the silence linger for a few moments, processing Taehyung's story.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nTae sighs. \u201cThey say he's a sadistic motherfucker. The dangerous kind of sadistic motherfucker. Has Jimin told you how long does the contract last?\u201d\nYoongi nods.\n\u201cThree years.\u201d\nTaehyung makes a face at that.\n\u201cThree years is a long fucking time, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was kind of ridiculous of how quickly Jimin became friends with everyone. In the span of three weeks, Jimin manages to befriend Mike, the ever stone faced man of the reception, Seokjin who wouldn't stop repeating that he wanted to adopt Jimin, both Hoseok and Namjoon and, of course, Taehyung and Jungkook, who apparently just couldn't stop talking about him because \u201cJimin is just too cute, who could resist him?\u201d.\nThe worst part is that Yoongi agrees with them. Jimin is cute and adorable, but that's not just it. There's much more to Jimin, so much more that Yoongi can't even possibly imagine. He knows it. He sees it in the way Jimin's smile falls whenever he thinks Yoongi isn't looking at him, in how his eyes darken at the mention of Gao, in the way his jaw clenches painfully everytime there's a loud noise coming from the street. Yoongi knows it but he doesn't say anything. Not when Jimin always greets him with that smile and light in his eyes and tells him that he's happy to see him. He just can't do that.\n\u00a0\nBut then another thursday comes and Jimin's smile when Yoongi opens the door for him isn't as bright as usual.\n\u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d he says, as he always does, and comes inside \u201cIt's cold as fuck outside.\u201d\nYoongi sees that Jimin is wearing a black coat and a huge scarf surrounds his neck and almost covers half of his face.\n\u201cHaven't gone out today.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cHow cold?\u201d\n\u201cSo cold.\u201d Jimin whines, sitting on the couch and unbottoning his coat \u201cI love winter, but it's seriously cold. Where can I put the coat?\u201d\nYoongi gestures to the sofa. \u201cJust leave it there.\u201d\nJimin takes off his coat and drops it on the couch next to him, doing the same with his scarf. He's wearing another soft looking jumper, this one has a turtleneck that covers him up to his chin, making him look even smaller.\nYoongi sits next to him, still keeping a distance, as Jimin looks for the order in his jean's pockets. He takes the folded piece of paper and gives it to Yoongi. That's when he notices that Jimin is holding the hems of the sleeves of his jumper with his fingers, covering them almost completely. He's not wearing any rings either.\n\u201cAre you that cold? I can turn the heater on, if you want.\u201d\nJimin frowns.\n\u201cNo, I'm good.\u201d\n\u201cYou're covering your hands.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jimin smiles and it looks so horribly forced that Yoongi has to shut down the wave of concern that hits him \u201cAjussi doesn't like them.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn't like what?\u201d\n\u201cMy hands.\u201d\nYoongi lets a few moments of silence go by.\n\u201cHe doesn't like your hands.\u201d he repeats and Jimin shrugs.\n\u201cHe says my fingers are too short. Doesn't wanna see 'em. He's in a better mood if I cover them, it's becoming a habit.\u201d\nThat's disgusting, Yoongi thinks, that's fucking disgusting.\n\u201cThere's more valium than usual.\u201d Yoongi says instead, trying to move from the subject as quickly as possible.\nJimin hums, taking a cigarette and lighting it up, exhaling a lungful of smoke.\n\u201cDon't know why, ajussi doesn't really speak about business with me that much. Only when he's high. I think the valium is more for personal use, though. Most of his men are actual junkies who live off heroin, valium doesn't do shit to them.\u201d\nYoongi makes a mental note to ask Gao, whenever he'll hear from him again, as to why there's a sudden request for more valium. It's probably nothing, but Yoongi likes to know what's going on when it comes to his merch.\n\u201cHow does one become a druglord, exactly?\u201d Jimin asks.\n\u201cDon't know about the others, mine is one hell of a long story.\u201d\n\u201cWill you tell me this story?\u201d\nYoongi considers it for a few seconds.\n\u201cNot today, no.\u201d he stands up and goes for the kitchen \u201cSince it's so cold, do you want some hot chocolate?\u201d\nThe excited shrill squeal and loud clapping that Jimin makes is enough of an answer so Yoongi starts warming up some milk in a kettle.\n\u201cYou're a mind reader, Yoongi.\u201d Jimin says \u201cI've been eyeing this coffee shop that's close to your place and looks amazing. I've been craving hot chocolate.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don't you go?\u201d Yoongi asks \u201cDo you want marshmallows in it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d Jimin replies \u201cAnd I can't go because ajussi doesn't like me going out alone, says it's dangerous. And taking a hot chocolate with my driver or one of the personal guards is like a nightmare, they don't like speaking and they never smile. So boring.\u201d\n\u201cI don't smile either.\u201d\n\u201cYou do sometimes. I mean, it's more like a grin, but I'll take what I can get.\u201d\nYoongi scoffs. Once the chocolate is ready, he pours it in two mugs and tosses in his two marshmallows and way more than two in Jimin's. He's about to ask Jimin if he also wants sugar when he turns around and the words die on his tongue.\nJimin is still sitting on his bed and Yoongi can only see his back as the boy is silently rubbing on his shoulder and the turtleneck of his jumper slides down to reaveal the tanned skin of his neck, showing the bruises. Yoongi imagines that he shouldn't be surprised. He really shouldn't, hell, what the fuck was he expecting? But there's something about them that unsettles him. Maybe it's because they're so fucking red, swollen. Maybe it's because they don't look like someone choked Jimin with his fingers but with a rope.\n\u201cWhat happened to your neck?\u201d Yoongi asks the question before he even realizes that the words slipped out of his mouth.\nJimin stops moving altogether, Yoongi wonders if he's even breathing. Slowly, the boy turns around and looks at him, expression blank and lips pressed in a firm line.\n\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d\nYoongi tears his gaze away from Jimin and takes the mugs in his hands, going back to the couch and placing them both on the coffee table.\n\u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cIt's not the first time shit like this happens and it ain't going to be the last, so no.\u201d Jimin's voice is cold \u201cNo, Yoongi, I don't want to talk about it.\u201d\nYoongi nods and whispers an \u201cokay\u201d before he takes his mug and blows on the hot chocolate, taking a small sip. Jimin does the same, sweater paws still covering his fingers that are warming up around the cup.\nThe silence is tense and heavy and Yoongi feels like an ass. He should've just stayed quiet. Jimin probably wore that turtleneck because he didn't want people to notice, so why the hell did he have to bring it up?\nJimin stares at his chocolate before sighing.\n\u201cI used to like being choked during sex.\u201d he says \u201cIt's... I don't know, there's something about having someone's hands on your neck, having someone else being in control of your breathing, I always found it hot.\u201d Jimin wets his lips nervously \u201cSo when ajussi said he was going to choke me I was almost excited. The moment he got that fucking rope out of the drawer I thought \u201cI'd better get a lungful, 'cause I ain't going to breathe for a while\u201d. It hurt like a bitch. I think I passed out at some point.\u201d\nRage, Yoongi thinks, is something that doesn't really feel right with him. Rage is useless and dangerous, it clouds your sense of judgement, it makes you take rushed decisions. In his line of work, rage is something that has to be avoided at all costs, even when your workers fuck up something or a client is way too fucking late with payment. And yet, there it is. Pure rage. It's a feeling so new to him that at first it scares him. It's almost hot in his chest, almost burning him. That's also the moment he realizes that he's made a mistake in letting Jimin in. He should've never asked for Jimin's real name, Yoongi should've kept calling him Peach, he should've kept him an object that belongs to another man. Instead, Yoongi made him human. And now he's dealing with the consequences.\n\u201cI'm always at the penthouse in the afternoon.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cThere might be customers but I'm always here. And if you're bored, or maybe just passing by, you can drop by. Whenever you want, you don't have to tell me before. So... yeah, even if you just want to talk, I'm always here in the afternoon.\u201d\nJimin stares at him, hot chocolate untouched, his fingers curling up around it.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cBecause I feel like I'm the only person who will listen to you.\u201d\nJimin takes a deep breath before his eyes fall on his chocolate and a small smile lights up his face.\n\u201cWhy the hell did you put so many marshmallows?\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin's presence is warm and comforting in the most unsettling way.\nYoongi knows the rules. And because he knows them he also knows when he's about to break one.\nJimin is sitting on the couch, legs close to his chest and a book that he brought from Gao's house open on his knees. He reads silently, twisting locks of pink hair between his fingers. He looks peaceful. This has been happening for a while, Jimin suddenly showing at the penthouse and claiming that Gao isn't home and he's so bored and he hates reading when there's no one in the same room. And Yoongi lets him in, makes him tea and keeps working, letting Jimin enjoy the safety of his home.\nYoongi thinks that if Jimin finds him kind and safe enough to let his guard down like this, he clearly never met an actual kind person in his whole life.\n\u201cSeokjin told me a joke that was so shit I feel like I need to share it with you.\u201d Yoongi suddenly says, breaking the silence.\nJimin looks up from his book and gives him a small smile.\n\u201cWhat joke?\u201d\n\u201cIt's so fucking bad, I swear.\u201d Yoongi clears his voice \u201cWhat do you give a cannibal who's late for dinner?\u201d\nJimin shrugs.\n\u201cA cold shoulder.\u201d\nJimin bursts out laughing immediately under Yoongi's incredulous eyes.\n\u201cWait, you like that?\u201d\n\u201cIt's so funny!\u201d Jimin says in between fits of laughter, hiding his mouth with the palm of his hand, his eyes disappearing into crescents, crinkling at the corners, cheeks dusted with pink \u201cMy pride hurts, but it's so funny!\u201d\nYoongi hides his smile by covering his mouth with his hand, enjoying the miracle that is Jimin's laughter, letting the sound mark itself with fire in his brain.\nHe knows he's breaking one of the rules. He decides that he doesn't care.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanna go somewhere.\u201d Jimin mumbles, a lollipop in his mouth \u201cI'm so bored.\u201d\nYoongi arches an eyebrow and leans back on the chair behind his desk.\n\u201cSorry if I'm too boring.\u201d\n\u201cNot you, you're fine.\u201d Jimin sighs, pouting ever so slightly \u201cI'm always bored. Ajussi is always out and when he's home is in such a fucking mood. Can't say anything to him, he gets pissy over everything and lately he's even more annoyed when I tell him I want to go out.\u201d\nYoongi clenches his jaw. It sounds to him like Gao has put a goddamn leash on Jimin.\n\u201dIf you wanna buy clothes do it online, he says. It's not the same.\u201d\n\u201cIsn't it?\u201d Yoongi asks \u201cI hate going out shopping. It's a waste of time.\u201d\nJimin shoots him a smirk.\n\u201cI like to show off when I go shopping, 'cause I'm pretty.\u201d\nYoongi smiles. \u201cSomeone's confident.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn't I be?\u201d\nYoongi huffs a laugh.\n\u201cNo, you should.\u201d he takes a deep breath before leaning with his elbows on the desk \u201cYou said you wanted to go to that coffee shop.\u201d Jimin nods \u201cLet's go.\u201d\nJimin seems to slowly process the words before his eyes widen almost comically.\n\u201cWhat, like now?\u201d\nYoongi shrugs. \u201cYou said you wanted to go.\u201d\n\u201cI did, but-\u201d Jimin bites his lips \u201cI mean, the driver is downstairs and he won't let me go alone with you. And he'll tell Ajussi.\u201d\n\u201cGao doesn't need to know, we'll go with my car. It's in the garage in the basement level, the driver won't even know we got out.\u201d\nAt that Jimin beams, smiling so brightly that Yoongi wonders if a person could be blinded by the sight.\n\u201cLet's go.\u201d Jimin says, standing from the couch and taking his coat, putting it on hastily.\n\u00a0\nAs they make their way to the elevator, Jimin does nothing but giggling excitedly, fidgeting with the hems of his coat and almost jumping on the spot, lollipop hanging between his lips.\n\u201cYou need to chill.\u201d Yoongi says.\n\u201cIt almost feels like we're spies.\u201d\n\u201cSpies?\u201d\nJimin nods before resting his chin on Yoongi's shoulder and looking up at him through his lashes.\n\u201cI'm telling you, I'm gonna try every single cake they have.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I'll make you pay for them.\u201d\n\u201cI thought that was obvious, I'm the one who's taking you out.\u201d Yoongi mumbles, finally the elevator reaches their level and the doors open.\nJimin smiles. \u201cIt almost feels like a date.\u201d\nYoongi looks at the floor, his hands curling into fists inside the pockets of his jacket.\n\u201cExcept that it's not.\u201d Jimin says, hopping inside the elevator and gesturing for Yoongi to come in.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the whole ride Jimin sits on the passenger seat with his legs close to his chest, humming to whatever song they're playing on the radio, staring outside the car window with a blissful smile stretching his lips.\nYoongi realizes that it doesn't take much to make Jimin happy. Yoongi wonders why Gao doesn't try harder. And then he thinks that Gao doesn't deserve Jimin's happiness.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTrue to his words, Jimin orders a slice of all the seven cakes the cofee shop has to order.\nWith an ecstatic smile, he places them all in front of him and then sits in his boot, biting on his nails.\n\u201cWhich one should I eat first?\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cYou're seriously going to eat them all?\u201d\n\u201cOf course and you're going to help me.\u201d Jimin pushes a plate towards Yoongi, who's sitting in front of him \u201cThat's the carrot cake, tell me if it's good. I'll try the chocolate one.\u201d\nYoongi looks at the slice of cake with his nose scrunched up.\n\u201cI don't like sweet things.\u201d\nJimin smirks before taking a bite of the chocolate cake.\n\u201cThen what are you doing here with me?\u201d he asks before he closes his eyes \u201cShit, this tastes amazing.\u201d\nYoongi dips his fork in the carrot cake and starts munching on it. It is good, that's for sure, but he's not going to give Jimin that satisfaction.\n\u201cI'm here 'cause you wanted to be here.\u201d\n\u201cSo you're doing it all for me?\u201d Jimin asks as he moves on to the next cake, one that looks like it has been dipped into red coloring \u201cAdmit it, you wanted to get out as well.\u201d\n\u201cNot this time, no.\u201d Yoongi says, pushing the plate back to the boy \u201cGive me the one with the strawberries.\u201d\nJimin complies, handing him another plate.\nThey don't speak for a while, Jimin too busy munching happily on the cakes, buzzing with excitement and even doing a little happy dance when he tastes the mint cake, closing his hands into tiny fists and almost jumping on his seat when he gets a bite of the raspberry cheesecake.\nYoongi takes occasional small bites, preferring to just enjoy the little show that Jimin is putting up, smiling softly at the boy.\nAfter a while, Jimin looks out of the window, finishing his sponge cake and he hums.\n\u201cShe's really pretty.\u201d he says and Yoongi follows his gaze. There's a girl just outside the shop, talking on the phone with someone, petite and with soft features, blond hair falling in waves on her shoulders.\n\u201cShe'd make good money.\u201d Jimin says, tilting his head to the side \u201cWith the right customer she'd be rich.\u201d\nYoongi frowns.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cIt's a thing I do. I try to guess whether people that I see on the street would survive doing my job.\u201d Jimin narrows his eyes \u201cThat guy over there is full twink material, he'd find a sugar daddy in a matter of seconds at the right party.\u201d\nYoongi lets a few seconds go by, his coffee has turned cold in his mug.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks and Jimin shrugs, still looking outside.\n\u201cMakes me feel like I'm similar to them. Less weird, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou're not weird.\u201d\nJimin turns around and slumps back on the tiny couch, smiling a little.\n\u201cAren't I?\u201d he whispers \u201cI'm an escort, Yoongi. And that's the nice word for \u201cpersonal slut\u201d. That's weird.\u201d\n\u201cYour job is, you're not.\u201d\nJimin giggles.\n\u201cYou, on the other hand...\u201d the boy says \u201cYou'd make real cash.\u201d\nYoongi arches an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cFace like yours but with your personality? People would kill to have you.\u201d Jimin says before diving back into one of the cakes.\nYoongi stares at him, taking in the happy tingle in Jimin's eyes, the way the corners of his lips are constantly curled up in a smile and he realizes that this is the first time he's seen Jimin looking this relaxed.\nHe's young. And he likes reading and coffee shops and terrible jokes, there's an innocence in everything he does that should be so unnatural coming from someone like him and yet there he is.\nJimin doesn't belong to the world he's currently living in.\n\u201cJust ask.\u201d\nYoongi furrows.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nJimin looks at him, chewing on a bite of ginger cake, before he speaks again.\n\u201cYou want to know how I ended up here, right?\u201d Jimin puts the fork down and crosses his arms \u201cI can see it in your eyes.\u201d\nYoongi takes a deep breath, dropping his gaze and settling his attention on the cold cup of coffee.\n\u201cI don't have a problem talking about it, you know?\u201d Jimin says \u201cAfter all, I don't remember.\u201d\nYoongi looks up at that, gazing at Jimin.\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI can't remember of how it started.\u201d he replies, lifting his legs and holding his knees close to his chest \u201cDon't know why, everything is kind of blurred. Was I sold? Kidnapped? Abandoned? I don't know, I just know that at some point I was twelve and I was getting fucked in an alley. I remember that I have, or maybe had, parents, but I can't remember their faces or their names. I feel like...\u201d Jimin squints his eyes \u201cI feel like maybe I removed it. People do that, don't they? They block out memories if they're too shitty. Maybe that's what I did.\u201d\n\u201cJimin-\u201d\n\u201cI remember that I didn't stay in the streets for long.\u201d he continues \u201cA guy saw me and said I looked too pretty to be there. He said he was going to give me food, and clothes and money. And I believed him, 'cause you know, sleeping in the streets is kinda shit. So I guess I started off as a prostitute in this brothel, we were all kids. I was the jewel of that place, 'cause american pedos apparently have a thing for asians. I already knew what I wanted: money. Money meant getting away, you know? So I always went for the rich ones, I have an eye for those. Then I turned sixteen and I found my first sugar daddy. He was this middle aged guy from Indiana, disgustingly rich, he spoiled the fuck out of me.\u201d Jimin pauses to get with his fork another piece of chocolate cake \u201cBut the greedy asshole never gave actual money, just let me use his credit card, so when I turned eighteen and he decided he had enough of me I was broke and, well... kind of useless. I don't know how to do most of things, I just know sex. So that's exactly what I did. No fucking way I was getting back in the streets, I wasn't stupid, I knew that I couldn't survive again like that. I went for porn instead.\u201d he shrugs \u201cYou don't earn much and you definetely don't get to cum much, but at least I had a job. So years go by, and life is shitty, porn is boring, sugar daddies literally last no more than three months 'cause, apparently, I'm too expensive and then I meet ajussi.\u201d\nYoongi worries his bottom lip, waiting for Jimin to start speaking again.\n\u201cThere was a party.\u201d he says \u201cThat kind of party, you know. Where rich men want to either fuck or get fucked. I was invited as well, so I went looking for a new daddy or something, and it was him who approached me first. Covered me with praises and compliments, saying how good I looked and how better I was than all the others so finally he starts talking about business. I told him I already knew what a sugar daddy was and that's when he said that he wasn't going to be my daddy, he was going to own me. He was going to put me under a contract, pay me for my services with so much money that I was going to get tired of it, that there were going to be rules and shit. I didn't think he was that serious back then, i just thought that this chinese old man had a god complex or something. So I agreed. And here I am.\u201d\nJimin stops talking and starts looking out of the window instead, staring at people walking by, following their steps with his gaze.\nThe coffee shop is quiet, voices buzzing around them, white noise in the background as Yoongi takes in Jimin's words. He realizes he doesn't know what to say. It doesn't look like Jimin wants to be comforted, nor is he looking for Yoongi's pity. It just looked like he wanted someone to listen to him, so that's exactly what Yoongi did.\n\u201cI feel like-\u201d Jimin says suddenly, licking his lips, still looking at the street \u201cI feel like you and I are similar.\u201d\n\u201cSimilar.\u201d\n\u201cYes. We both made choices that we might or might not regret and ended up here. In this kind of world.\u201d Jimin looks at him \u201cWe're just doing what we gotta do in order to survive.\u201d\nYoongi lowers his gaze, nodding a little and taking his cup of coffee, now definetely cold and he takes a sip.\n\u201cWe're similar, but there's huge difference between us.\u201d Yoongi says, not daring to look at Jimin.\n\u201cWhat difference?\u201d\n\u201cThe difference is that you don't belong in this kind of world. You belong somewhere better.\u201d\nRather than see, Yoongi can feel Jimin's smile, can sense the warmth that radiates from it on his skin.\n\u201cNo, I don't.\u201d Jimin mutters, before standing up \u201cWe need to go back.\u201d\nYoongi doesn't tell him that they can stay a little more if Jimin wants. He doesn't, but he wants to.\n\u00a0\nThe ride back to Yoongi's penthouse is silent, no words are exchanged. Even in the elevator, both of them don't speak nor they share looks. As the doors open Jimin quickly slides out the elevator, turning around just for a second.\n\u201cThank you for today.\u201d he says \u201cI'll see you next thursday.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi massages his temples as he lets out a long breath.\n\u201cPlease, Hoseok, tell me again what happened so that I can understand what the fuck went wrong.\u201d\nHoseok grimaces, sitting on the armchair in front of Yoongi.\n\u201cListen, it wasn't pretty.\u201d he says \u201cI got this call from Taehyung saying that Kook was about to murder this guy so I went and stopped him. That's all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that's not all.\u201d Yoongi snarls \u201cThat can't be all, 'cause Jungkook ain't a fucking idiot and he doesn't try and kill clients with no reason.\u201d\nHoseok sighs. \u201cIt's not Kookie's fault. Nor Taehyung's and he asked me not to tell you but I guess I don't have a choice.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right you don't.\u201d\n\u201cClient's name is Blanchard, that junkie who lives off oxycodone. Tae and Kook went for the dispatchment, as usual, but this time the guy had no money. So they told him that he wasn't getting the stuff, he knows the rules, he should be glad they're not breaking fingers and shit. That's when the guy lost it and took out this knife. He tried to stab Taehyung.\u201d\n\u201cShit. Is he okay?\u201d Yoongi asks, his stomach dropping from the wave of concern.\n\u201cYeah, he was quick enough to dodge the knife, just a nasty cut on his cheek. Won't even leave a scar, probably.\u201d Hoseok sighs and shakes his head \u201cBut shit, Yoongi, when Tae called me and said that he needed help I wasn't expecting to see Jungkook almost gauging the eyes out of that junkie's head. He was fucking livid and he might be a kid but he's strong, I had a hard time shoving him off Blanchard. And when he saw Taehyung he-\u201d Hoseok shoots Yoongi a sad look \u201cJungkook started fucking crying. It took us a whole hour to calm him down. The fucking brat almost kills someone and then starts crying because Taehyung has some blood on his face.\u201d\nYoongi closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.\n\u201cI hate when this shit happens.\u201d he whispers \u201cThey're okay, yeah?\u201d\nHoseok nods. \u201cTae was worried you'd get angry at Kook, that's why he didn't want me to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not angry, what the fuck?\u201d Yoongi shakes his head \u201cI'm not angry, I'm worried. They're kids, I fucking hate having them on the streets. Tell them to get the week off, yeah? The other runners will cover their areas. And tell Blanchard that if he fucking dares to show his face again I'll personally kill him.\u201d\n\u201cCan you believe that it's only monday?\u201d\nYoongi concedes a small laugh at that, taking a cigarette and lighting it up. He offers one to Hoseok, who accepts it and starts smoking with him in silence.\n\u201cRemember when we were runners?\u201d Hoseok asks.\n\u201cHow could I forget?\u201d Yoongi looks at the smoke floating above him \u201cThose were some shitty years.\u201d\n\u201cI remember that time a junkie pointed a fucking gun at me. What was his name again?\u201d\n\u201cCan't remember.\u201d\n\u201cI've never seen you move that fast in my entire life.\u201d Hoseok chuckles \u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking back then, trying to take him down when you didn't have a weapon?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn't thinking.\u201d Yoongi taps the cigarette and ash falls in the ashtray \u201cI saw a gun pointed at your head so I just moved.\u201d\nHoseok smiles.\n\u201cYou're impulsive, you've always have been. Not when it comes to business, no. But you act without thinking when it involves the people you love. Which is why I'm worried.\u201d\nYoongi frowns. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cYou and Jimin.\u201d Hoseok shakes his head \u201cYou know the rules, Yoons.\u201d\nYoongi keeps his gaze steady on Hoseok but doesn't find it in itself to say anything.\n\u201cYou're not going to deny it?\u201d the man asks him, his voice careful.\n\u201cWhat's there to deny?\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, you're my friend.\u201d the younger man leans on his elbows , almost whispering \u201cMy best friend. We've known each other for ages, you're my brother. I'd die for you, and I know you'd do the same.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I would.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know that, no matter what, you'll always have me. Always. I'll be by your side, I'll help you and the same goes for Namjoon and the others.\u201d he pauses for a second \u201cBut I have to say this: what the fuck are you doing?\u201d\nYoongi snorts. He takes a drag of his cigarette, blowing out a cloud of smoke and letting a few moments of silence go by.\n\u201cThis is stupid.\u201d he says \u201cWhat, can't I be nice to the kid without people making a huge deal out of it?\u201d\n\u201cThat's the point.\u201d Hoseok hisses \u201cIt is a huge fucking deal. I'm worried about you both, but mostly about him. What are you trying to do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Yoongi replies.\n\u201cAre you trying to make him fall in love with you or some shit?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201c'Cause that's exactly what's gonna happen if you keep being that nice to him.\u201d\n\u201cJimin is not a fucking idiot, he knows his boundaries. He knows he's under a contract and he's well aware of what he can and can't do.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Hoseok shakes his head \u201cNo, Jimin is a kid who's under contract with a fucking psycopath who tried to choke him with a goddamn rope, you told me that! Yoongi, you need to understand something: Jimin lives in two worlds. In one he's Gao's whore, everything is shit, he's lonely and he's treated like a piece of garbage. In the other world there's you. You make him tea, you take him to coffee shops, you call him by his real name. Those are the only two worlds he knows.\u201d Yoongi can see in Hoseok's eyes a deep sadness that he can't bring himself to ignore \u201cIn one world he's an object, in the other one he's human. Which one do you think he prefers?\u201d\n\u201cThen what the fuck am I supposed to do, Hoseok?\u201d\n\u201cYou know the rules. You don't fall in love with a client's whore.\u201d\nYoongi looks down at his hands, cigarette burned to the filter, smoke itching at his eyes. Yoongi knows the rules, that's why he also knows he's already broke one. But he can't tell that to Hoseok. He'd understand, hell, Hoseok probably already knows, otherwise they wouldn't be having that conversation. But there's a difference between being aware of feeling and admitting them, a line that Yoongi does not want to surpass.\nSo all Yoongi can say is: \u201cHe's not just a client's whore.\u201d\nThe silence that follows his words is long and tense, broken only by their breaths and the ticking of the grandfather's clock in the other room.\n\u201cI know he's not.\u201d Hoseok finally says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoongi dreads next thursday and at the same time he finds himself checking the hour every few minutes. Jimin is late.\nHe's never late.\nYoongi decides to kill some time by going through some documents that he still hasn't checked, making sure that everything is going steady, that the next stash will arrive in time and this time without mysterious losses that Yoongi has decided to ignore until now because he's too lazy to actually care. Then finally someone is knocking on the door and Yoongi stands up from his chair and basically sprints to open the door.\nThe thing that unsettles him the most once he lays his eyes on Jimin is that the boy looks as he usually does. His hair is still pink and perfectly styled, his eyes always a little droopy and horribly pretty, his lips still stretched in that smile he has.\n\u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d\nHe even sounds the same, a voice so light that all the world would stop just so that it could listen to it just a little more. Jimin is the same as usual except for the map of cuts and bruises on his face.\n\u201cGet inside.\u201d Yoongi hears his voice and almost doesn't recognize it \u201cNow.\u201d\nJimin shakes his head and fishes from his jacket the usual piece of paper.\n\u201cI can't stay long, I just came to bring you the order.\u201d\nYoongi snatches the paper from Jimin's hands and drops it on the floor.\n\u201cI don't give a shit about the order, get inside.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi-\u201d\n\u201cInside, Jimin.\u201d\nWhen he sees that Jimin is still not going to make his way inside, Yoongi grabs his wrist and pulls him inside the penthouse, shutting the door close and dragging Jimin to the couch.\n\u201cSit.\u201d he says and the boy obeys, so Yoongi goes to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator.\nHe'll have to thank Namjoon for his obsession with whiskey on the rocks since he has far too much ice in the house. He fills a bowl with ice cubes, takes a cloth that is hanging on the oven and he empties the ice on it, knotting together the edges of the cloth.\nHe makes his way back to Jimin and sits in front of him on the couch, almost shoving the icepack on his face.\n\u201cOuch.\u201d Jimin pouts, taking the cloth and pressing it carefully over his swollen lips.\n\u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt's not as bad as it looks.\u201d\n\u201cDon't bullshit me.\u201d\n\u201cI'm fine.\u201d\nYoongi sighs. \u201cNo, you're not.\u201d\nJimin grimaces when he moves the icebag to his black eye, hissing a little.\n\u201cHurts like a bitch.\u201d \u201che mutters \u201cBut honestly, it could've been worse.\u201d\n\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d\n\u201cIn fact, no.\u201d Jimin smiles \u201cIt's supposed to make me feel better. 'Cause it really could've been worse. It's not the first time it happens anyway, so it's fine.\u201d\nFine.\nJimin keeps saying that word. Never in his life had Yoongi despised a word more than now.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks, looking at the cut on Jimin's cheeckbone. Probably caused by that fucking ring Gao always wears on his index finger. If it leaves a scar, Yoongi might act without thinking.\n\u201cI broke a glass.\u201d Jimin answers, voice flat and steady.\n\u201cA glass.\u201d Yoongi repeats and the boy nods.\n\u201cA really expensive glass, apparently. A client bought it for him as a present or something, don't remember, I was too busy getting punched in the face to actually listen to him.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d Yoongi takes a deep breath \u201cShit, Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay!\u201d the boy gives him a cheerful smile \u201cI just got ajussi in, like, the worst mood possible so-\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi snaps \u201cSo what? Being in a shitty mood doesn't excuse what he's done to you!\u201d\n\u201cIt could've been worst, Yoongi.\u201d Jimin says, pronouncing every word with a severity that Yoongi doesn't understand at first. Then he does.\nIt could've been worst. Gao could've done much more. Gao still can do worst and that's exactly what Jimin is telling him. That he probably will do even worst things in the future and that Yoongi needs to be ready to face them. Jimin is. Jimin is ready to face them all because he knows that there will be more.\nYoongi takes the cloth full of ice from Jimin's hands and starts dabbing it on the swollen wounds, Jimin's gaze steady on his eyes.\n\u201cI was born in Daegu and I lived there for fifteen years.\u201d Yoongi says, voice low, almost as if he's telling a secret \u201cIt's a city I will love forever.\u201d\nJimin grins. \u201cIs it beautiful?\u201d\nYoongi smiles at the memories.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d he replies \u201cThere's this botanical garden and it's the most amazing thing. There's a bridge there and I remember sneaking out of my house to go there when I was five years old. I'd threw rocks at the pond for hours. And every spring and autumn there's the Seokjeondaeje, a ceremony where we honor Confucius, a chinese philosopher. I loved it, I loved the music they play and the dance they perform. I love Daegu.\u201d\nJimin tilts his head to the side.\n\u201cThen why did you leave?\u201d\n\u201c'Cause I was an angsty teenager who dreamed of glory and fame.\u201d Yoongi shrugs \u201cI wanted to make music, it was stupid. So one day I just left, I didn't even tell my parents, I ran away. I was in America, broke, didn't know a single fucking word of english so I didn't last long. I'd be dead under a bridge right now if it weren't for Namjoon. He found me and he was talking to me in english and I was so pissed 'cause I couldn't understand shit and then he switched to korean. I almost cried, I swear to God. He said he could find me a job, and a place to stay which was ridiculous considering he's younger than me and he was shorter than me back then but I still believed him.\u201d\n\u201cMy cheek feels numb.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Yoongi drops the icepack on the coffee table.\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked me however does one become a druglord, right?\u201d Yoongi asks and Jimin nods \u201cI started off as a runner. You know, they give you drugs and you drop them where they tell you, get the money, give the money to the people in charge. Back then it was me, Namjoon and Hoseok. Seokjin was in charge of giving us the drugs and the areas we had to scan. It was so shitty, really, but it was our job and we were good at it. I was seventeen when it changed for me. Namjoon was late so we went looking for him and I found him in a pool of his own blood with this junkie who was high as fuck still sitting next to Joons, too stoned to do anything but staying there with the knife still in his hand. I just-\u201d Yoongi frowns \u201cI don't even remember what happened. I saw red. So I killed him.\u201d\nJimin's eyes widen but he doesn't flinch nor he looks scared or surprised.\n\u201cKilled him.\u201d he repeats.\n\u201cIt wasn't on purpose.\u201d Yoongi fishes two cigarettes out of his pocket and gives Jimin one, lighting them up \u201cI wasn't even myself in that moment. All I know is that I thought Namjoon was dead because of that junkie so I wanted to make him pay. When I came back to myself he was dead. But Namjoon was alive, by some miracle, so I bought him back to the base and we patched him up. By the following day everyone knew I killed someone. Runners don't kill, you know? Sure, they threaten and break fingers but they don't kill. That's when the old boss found out about me.\u201d\nJimin frowns, crossing his legs on the couch, cigarette burning between his fingers.\n\u201cOld boss?\u201d\n\u201cHis name's Lutz. He's this old guy who looks a lot like Santa Claus before gaining weight.\u201d Yoongi smiles \u201cHe called me in his office, said that a runner who kills to avenge a brother should be honored. He was like a mentor to me, taught me how the business really worked, how to survive as a druglord without getting caught. He never said it with his words but I knew that he was teaching me so that I could take his place. The moment I turned twenty he left, leaving a note that said \u201chave fun kid\u201d.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\nYoongi shrugs. \u201cProbably in an island somewhere surrounded by hot women.\u201d he answers \u201cSo yeah, that's how I became a druglord. First thing I've done was promoting Namjoon, Hoseok and Seokjin. Namjoon's kind of a genius, he handles the money, Hoseok takes care of the runners, Seokjin is the one who keeps an eye on the stashes we receive and makes the orders.\u201d\nJimin nods pensive, taking in the information, before the smile is back on his face.\n\u201cWhat about Tae and Kookie?\u201d\n\u201cNamjoon found Jungkook starving in an alley and Jungkook found Taehyung in a shitty brothel.\u201d\nJimin blinks and his lips part slightly, but he doesn't say anything.\n\u201cI made them runners 'cause they're young and smart but I fucking hate having 'em on the street. Can't really do anything about it though, I keep them safe in any way I can.\u201d\nJimin hums and they both fall in a comfortable silence, a curtain of smoke hovering above their heads.\n\u201cI don't exactly have a place to go back to.\u201d Jimin says suddenly, looking at his hands \u201cLike, I know I was born in Busan but I don't remember much of it, only the sea, so I don't feel like I belong there. But you have a city you care about. Don't you ever think of going back there?\u201d\n\u201cEveryday.\u201d Yoongi replies immediately \u201cEvery fucking day.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don't you?\u201d Jimin asks, his voice small and almost a whisper.\nYoongi looks at him for a few seconds, his eyes scanning Jimin's injuries.\n\u201cI have things I need to take care of.\u201d he finally says \u201cBesides, without me here Tae and Kook would get killed in a second, those two are a pain in the ass.\u201d\nJimin giggles and Yoongi could drown in the sound.\n\u201cI have a house in Daegu.\u201d he says before he can stop himself \u201cI bought it three years ago.\u201d\nJimin frowns, exhaling smoke from his mouth.\n\u201cIt's a nice house.\u201d Yoongi continues \u201cNot as big as the penthouse, but it's nice. And it's in my favorite part of Daegu, near Suseong lake. You'd like it there.\u201d\nJimin smiles softly. \u201cWould I?\u201d\n\u201cAnd it ain't so far from Busan either, you know?\u201d Yoongi knows he's rambling at this point \u201cIt doesn't take long with a train, so-\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to see Daegu, Yoongi?\u201d\nMaybe it's the way Jimin says those words, with a voice so tense and hopeful that Yoongi can feel his heart swell in his chest, or maybe it's the look in his eyes, full of expectations and fear. Maybe it's just that Yoongi loves Jimin so much that it scares him, so he says:\n\u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d\nJimin draws in a sharp breath and his face screws up before he lowers his head. Yoongi can see in the boy's tense shoulders how he's trying not to cry, not to break in front of him and the thought that he's the cause of this could kill him. This could actually kill him.\n\u201cJimini.\u201d He tries \u201cListen to me, I-\u201d\n\u201cThree years.\u201d Jimin interrupts him, lifting his head and staring at him with red eyes \u201cCan you wait for me for three years? Then you'll show me Daegu, and you'll take me to Busan, just... three years. Can you do that for me?\u201d\nThe weight of the contract that keeps Jimin locked away from him should be enough for Yoongi to know that he can't promise something like that. And, in a way, he knows. And yet.\n\u201cI can do that for you.\u201d he says.\nJimin lets out a shaky breath and abruptly stands up, dropping the burnt out cigarette in the ashtray.\n\u201cI'll see you next thursday, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe weeks go by and, somehow, everything seems to go well. Jimin doesn't show with more bruises, the cuts heal and leave no scars, but Yoongi thinks Jimin is losing weight. He's not sure, the boy keeps wearing oversized furry sweaters that make it hard for him to be sure. He realizes that's probably the point.\nTaehyung and Jungkook go back to their job and they keep spending their evenings in Yoongi's penthouse.\nDuring one of those nights, Yoongi speaks to Junkook privately.\n\u201cWhat you've done was fucking stupid.\u201d he tells the boy \u201cYou could've got killed.\u201d\nJungkook looks at his feet and he looks like a kid who's getting an earful from his dad.\n\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d\nAt that, Jungkook looks at him, eyes sharp and too mature on his face.\n\u201cI wasn't.\u201d he replies, words spoken firmly \u201cI wasn't fucking thinking, Yoongi.\u201d\nAnd before Yoongi knows what he's doing, he's hugging Jungkook and even though that kid is larger and taller than him it feels right.\n\u201cI know you weren't.\u201d Yoongi whispers and he swears that he hears Jungkook sobbing but he doesn't say anything.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother thursday comes, the doorbell rings, Yoongi goes to open the door with tea already brewing in the kitchen.\nThe moment he opens the door, Yoongi's smile disappears.\n\u201cMin.\u201d Gao greets him with a grin \u201cIt's good to see you again!\u201d\nYoongi looks at the man and then at Jimin, standing quietly next to him, eyes fixated on the floor.\n\u201cIt's been a while, Gao.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cPlease, come in. Both of you.\u201d\nYoongi steps aside and Gao puts his hand on the back of Jimin's neck, squeezing it lightly and Yoongi can see how hard Jimin is trying not to recoil at the touch.\nGao sits on the usual armchair, dragging Jimin on his lap as if he were a pet, hand still clutched around his neck.\n\u201cHow's it going, Gao?\u201d Yoongi asks.\n\u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d Gao nods \u201cMy deal is going smoothly and... Peach, darling, why aren't you saying hi to Min?\u201d\nJimin reluctantly lifts his eyes to meet Yoongi's and he forces a smile.\n\u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cThat's better.\u201d Gao says \u201cNow, the adults need to talk, so why don't you go buy something for yourself, mh? Something nice.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nGao's grips gets tighter, Jimin stiffens, eyes blown wide with fear.\n\u201cYes what?\u201d\n\u201cYes, owner.\u201d\nGod, that fucking word. Yoongi forgot about it, he forgot of how fucking twisted it sounded.\n\u201cVery well, Peach. I'll see you home, go now.\u201d\nJimin stands up quickly, clearly eager to get away from Gao's lock on his neck and out of that house.\n\u201cBye, Yoongi.\u201d he whispers, quickly exiting the penthouse and closing the door behind him.\nGao takes from his inside pocket the usual piece of paper.\n\u201cHere's the order.\u201d he says, handing it to Yoongi \u201cHas Peach been doing a good enough job?\u201d\nYoongi nods, not bothering to look at the order.\n\u201cHe's reliable.\u201d he replies \u201cHe's never late, so he makes a decent job.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he does, I've trained him well.\u201d Gao clears his voice \u201cAlthough soon he won't need to place the orders anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Yoongi asks and curses himself for how quick he was to ask Gao.\n\u201cWell, I told you Min. My deal is going smoothly.\u201d the man says with pride \u201cSoon enough the deal will be done, I'll be richer than I am now and with more time to kill. I'll begin placing the orders again, as it should be.\u201d\nShit, that's not good.\n\u201cGood for you.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cI forgot to ask you, do you want anything to drink?\u201d\nGao waves a hand at him dismissevely.\n\u201cNah, I'm good.\u201d the man licks his lips \u201cWhat do you think of Peach?\u201d\nYoongi ignores the wave of nausea that hits him, suddenly the air he's breathing is too thick.\n\u201cThere's not much to think.\u201d he says, keeping his voice as flat as possible.\n\u201cIsn't there?\u201d Gao frowns \u201cDon't you ever wonder of how it would feel?\u201d\n\u201cHow what feels? I'm not good with riddles.\u201d\n\u201cHow fucking him would feel.\u201d\nYoongi feels his own blood run cold as the words wash over him, the sheer disgust that seems to take over his mind for a moment, making his thoughts blank, just white noise in his head.\n\u201cSurely, you gave it a thought.\u201d Gao continues \u201cEveryone does. I don't blame them. One look at him and the first thing that goes through your mind is \u201chow would he look like on his knees for me?\u201d. And I'll tell you, Min, he looks gorgeus.\u201d\nYoongi keeps quiet.\n\u201cNo? You never thought about it? I ain't buying that, Min, you look like you don't feel anything but you're just a man.\u201d Gao smiles \u201cDo you want me to tell you how it feels?\u201d\nYoongi wants to kill him. It would be easy, he reckons, Gao is so old and out of shape that the piece of shit wouldn't even see it coming.\n\u201cHe's a fucking tease, you know?\u201d Gao chuckles \u201cOh, he loves showing you how pretty he can be. And he mewls like the best slut but he's tight like a fucking virgin.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a test?\u201d Yoongi says, keeping his voice under control and yet he knows it's shaking with rage \u201cOr some kind of twisted kink of yours?\u201d\nGao's smile drops and the man leans on his elbows.\n\u201cLet me tell you something, Min.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, enlighten me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I buy something I like that something to stay mine.\u201d he says \u201cWhen I buy something, I own it.\u201d\n\u201cYou put him under a contract, I'd say that the ownership was made quite obvious.\u201d Yoongi says, squinting his eyes \u201cWhat is it, Gao? You think your toy ain't loyal?\u201d\n\u201cI think that you're walking on a thin layer of ice, Min.\u201d Gao pauses for a second \u201cThe thing is, I can't do anything about it, can I? It's not like I can hurt you to make you realize that Peach belongs to me, your little soldiers would have me hanging by the balls the moment I touch you.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cThat's why I'm warning you, Min. I can't get my hands on you, but I can get my hands on him.\u201d\nYoongi wonders if the sound of his heart hammering in his chest can be heard in the room.\n\u201cI don't like ruining my things.\u201d Gao sighs \u201cBut when I have to teach my things lessons then I have no choice, do I?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not fucking him.\u201d\n\u201cLike, for example, I have to teach him to be careful if he breaks a glass.\u201d\n\u201cI am not fucking him.\u201d Yoongi hisses.\nGao lets the silence linger for a while before he starts rubbing at his temples. \u201cI know you aren't. But I also know you want to. So this is just me reminding you that you might have leverage on me because of your position, but I have leverage on you as well.\u201d\nGao stands up, fixing his tailored jacket on his frame.\n\u201cAnd I think I'm the one with the upper hand in this situation.\u201d Gao smiles \u201cEnjoy your thursdays, Min.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYoongi doesn't know for how long he stays still on the couch, staring at the armchair, Gao's words echoing in his head, the threat a weight on his shoulders that could crash him on the floor. All he knows is that his hands are shaking and he can't seem to make them stop.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you sitting so far away?\u201d\nYoongi looks up from the book on his lap to Jimin, who's currently looking at him with a frown sitting cross legged on the couch with a cigarette dangling between his lips.\n\u201cI'm sitting on the armchair.\u201d Yoongi replies.\n\u201cExactly. You usually sit on the couch with me unless you're working.\u201d Jimin pouts \u201cWhy aren't you sitting with me?\u201d\nYoongi shrugs.\n\u201cNo reason.\u201d\nGao is the fucking reason. The man's words are still echoing in Yoongi's head, the heavy weight of the threat keeping him frozen on the spot, unable to breath freely. The sole idea of getting close to Jimin is, right now, absolutely frightening and he hates himself for being so weak against a man that he could easily destroy under any other circumstance.\n\u201cBut I'm cold.\u201d Jimin whines.\n\u201cGet a blanket.\u201d\n\u201cI don't want a blanket, I want you.\u201d\nYoongi sighs.\n\u201cYoongi, please. Pretty please. I really want you here.\u201d\n\u201cJimin.\u201d Yoongi snaps, his voice way harder that he wanted \u201cStop it.\u201d\nJimin freezes, holding his breath, for what feels like ages before he narrows his eyes and looks at Yoongi with curiosity burning in his gaze.\n\u201cYou never use that voice with me, what's wrong?\u201d the boy asks.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage.\u201d\n\u201cIs it because of ajussi?\u201d\nYoongi flinches and he shifts in his armchair.\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d\n\u201cIt is because of him, isn't it? Fuck.\u201d Jimin shakes his head \u201cWhat did he tell you? Has he said anything about me?\u201d\nYoongi doesn't answer.\n\u201cHe did.\u201d Jimin worries his bottom lip, staring at Yoongi \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\u201cListen-\u201d\n\u201cNo, wait. I don't wanna know.\u201d Jimin closes his eyes, breathing deeply \u201cHe thinks we're fucking, you know?\u201d\nYoongi stares at his hands, unable to look at Jimin's face.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d he finally says.\n\u201cHe didn't tell me specifically, but I know he thinks we are.\u201d the boy ruffles his hair \u201cHe's impossible lately, he's always in such a shitty mood. He got even more rough when he fucks me.\u201d\nYoongi decides that he really, really doesn't want to know more than he already does. They stay in silence for minutes, the loud ticking of the grandfather's clock echoing in the quiet room.\n\u201cIt's my fault if I'm in this situation, you know?\u201d Jimin whispers \u201cIt's my fault.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, it's not your fucking fault.\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Jimin sighs \u201cI'm a spoiled little thing, Yoongi. I'm so fucking spoiled, I can't do anything by myself and I love being cared for. It's so fucking pathetic but shit, I bask in the attention, I keen at praises and the moment someone is even remotely nice to me I get so fucking dependent on that person. I'm... I'm not proud of it, but it's how I am and I should've known that sooner or later I wasn't gonna be so lucky with my employers. So now that I'm here, so fucking dependent on a man that really despises me I can blame no one but me but there's nothing I can do about it.\u201d when Jimin looks at him again, Yoongi can see fear in his eyes \u201cHe'd kill me if he had enough reasons. I know he would. I can see it in his eyes.\u201d\nYoongi forces himself to swallow, to keep his hands steady and his voice as firm as possible.\n\u201cNo, he wouldn't.\u201d he says and he knows he's lying \u201cHe cares about his things too much.\u201d\n\u201cJust like he cared about his last toy?\u201d\nAt that Yoongi shuts his mouth closed.\n\u201cYou think I don't know?\u201d Jimin lets out a shaky laughter \u201cTwo of his men told me, they love reminding me that I'll probably end up like that boy too. I know what happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cI know too.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cJin told me Gao shot him.\u201d\nJimin clenches his jaw. \u201cDid he also tell you how?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cAjussi shot him in the head whilst he was fucking him.\u201d\nYoongi feels like he's going to be sick.\n\u201cThey even showed me pictures.\u201d Jimin drops the burnt out cigarette in the ashtray \u201cIt was the most eerie shit I've ever seen in my life, and I worked in a fucking brothel for pedos.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn't you tell me?\u201d\nJimin looks at him for a second before dropping his gaze again.\n\u201cWhat good would telling you have done? It's not like you can do something about it. It's my fault if I'm in this situation, I don't know what I was thinking when I signed that fucking contract.\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn't have known.\u201d\n\u201cThat's the fucking point, Yoongi!\u201d Jimin shouts and his skin flushes red \u201cEveryone knows about ajussi! Everyone knows that he's fucking twisted and I still went for it 'cause I thought that he meant what he said, that I was better, I believed him when he said that I was something precious that had to be treasured!\u201d\n\u201cThat's because you are!\u201d Yoongi screams and he stands up, the book resting on his lap drops on the floor and Yoongi walks to the couch \u201cYou are precious and better than most of the people that are breathing in this very fucking moment!\u201d\nYoongi kneels in front of Jimin and he takes his hand, holding them tightly. \u201cJimin, it's not your fault. It's not your fault if you want to be praised, it's not your fault if you need someone to care for you.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi-\u201d\n\u201cShit, if I could I...\u201d\nYoongi can feel the taste of the words he wants to say on his tongue and yet he stays quiet. He just enjoys the sound of them in his own head.\nIf I could, it's such a nice sound, If I could I'd love you.\nJimin stares at him with an unreadable expression, breathing coming out in soft puffs. The boy holds Yoongi's hands back, squeezing them lightly.\n\u201cWould you take care of me?\u201d Jimin asks in a whisper.\n\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d\nSlowly, Jimin nods.\n\u201cThen I'll take care of you.\u201d Yoongi forces a smiles \u201cI promise I'll take care of you.\u201d\nJimin looks like he's about to say something but all he does is opening his mouth just to close it agin the next second, looking at Yoongi as if he's lost and can't even recognize him. Suddenly, he lets go of Yoongi's hands and stands up, taking his coat and scarf.\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d he says.\n\u201cJimin, listen to me-\n\u201cI really have to go.\u201d the boy sprints to the exit and leaves the penthouse, not even closing the door, disappearing behind the wall.\nYoongi stares at the empty couch before he finds it in himself to stand up and actually close the door Jimin left open. Once he does, though, he can't move once more, staring at the wood in front of him, breathing slowly.\nIt's not Jimin's fault if they're in this situation, it's Yoongi's. He knows it. Hoseok is right, Yoongi made him human and Jimin found comfort inside Yoongi's heart. So it's really just his own fault.\nThe loud knocking on the door is what breaks Yoongi from his train of thoughts.\nYoongi opens the door and he has barely mere seconds to process what it's happening. He can see for a moment Jimin, eyes red with tears and then all he can feel is the touch of the boy's fingers on his face and the way Jimin's lips meet his almost brutally.\nThere are a few seconds where none of them move, they stand frozen. Then Jimin closes his eyes and the way his lips move on Yoongi's is careful and soft, Jimin tastes of smoke and something sweet and Yoongi's already intoxicated.\nThen Jimin pulls away from him with a loud gasp and his eyes are blown wide, his lips tremble.\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d he says \u201cOh God, I'm so sorry.\u201d\nAnd then he's gone so quickly that for a moment Yoongi wonders if he dreamed about this.\nHe didn't.\nThat's probably what hurts the most.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNamjoon is talking to him about the latest incomes and the spike the business had lately and Yoongi is not listening. Which is not good because Yoongi needs to listen, this is an empire he's running, he can't slack off.\nYet, his mind is not cooperating.\nWhere Jimin touched him it burns. The feeling of his lips is still there, the memory of his taste haunts him.\nJimin had never touched him before that day. Never.\n\u201cYoongi!\u201d Namjoon clicks his fingers in front of his eyes and Yoongi brings his attention on his friend.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhere the fuck are you, man?\u201d Namjoon sighs \u201cWere you listening to me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Yoongi admits \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d he sighs \u201cI'm tired. That's all.\u201d\nJudging from the way his eyebrow arches Namjoon clearly doesn't buy it, but he doesn't push the question further. He knows that Yoongi sometimes needs his space and his own time.\n\u201cListen, don't worry about these.\u201d he says, gesturing towards the papers scattered on the desk, numbers and words overlapping each other \u201cI'll take care of everything. I always do, if you need some time off I won't blame you.\u201d\nYoongi grimaces. \u201cI don't need time off.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you do. You're only human, brother.\u201d Namjoon sits more comfortably on the chair \u201cIt wasn't important anyway, nothing urgent that we need to review. So let's just chill okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Yoongi nods \u201cYeah, let's do that.\u201d\nNamjoon hums with a content smile stretching his lips, dimples just below his cheeks.\nYoongi remembers when it was just Namjoon, Hoseok and him and they were young and scared but they had each other and they used to sneak out the base and run around for hours, getting lost in the city, stealing cheap food from the food trucks on the streets. Suddenly, he misses those days even though they were horrible.\n\u201cJoons.\u201d\n\u201cMh?\u201d\n\u201cDid you look into Gao's new deal in the end?\u201d\nNamjoon nods.\n\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d he says, his voice more quiet this time \u201cAnd I can tell you that it's fucking huge.\u201d\nThat peaks Yoongi's interest. \u201cHow huge?\u201d\n\u201cEnough to make it impossible for me to actually find real infos about it.\u201d Namjoon scratches his neck \u201cEverything is real fucking secret. No one knows shit. They just know that it's this huge order of weapons that comes from some foreigners, they don't even know where they're from.\u201d\nYoongi leans over the desk and, automatically, Namjoon does as well even though they're alone.\n\u201cI need to ask you a favor.\u201d Yoongi says.\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cI need you to find dirt on Gao.\u201d\nAt that Namjoon snorts. \u201cYoons, everything about Gao is dirty.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don't get it.\u201d Yoongi shakes his head and taps on the table with his index finger \u201cI neel real dirt. Dirt with proofs. Real proofs. Stuff that gives me leverage over him.\u201d\n\u201cThat ain't going to be easy.\u201d\n\u201cListen, during these years as our customer Gao left so many fucking tracks so many times when he paid us.\u201d Yoongi insists \u201cHe's not fucking careful when it comes to where his money goes, why should he be careful about the rest? I'm sure that the fucker thinks that whatever he does he's still untouchable.\u201d\n\u201cThat's because he is.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn't need to know that we know. He just needs to think that he's not so safe anymore.\u201d\nNamjoon frowns.\n\u201cWhat are you trying to do, brother?\u201d he asks \u201cIs this about Jimin?\u201d\nWhen Yoongi doesn't answer, Namjoon sighs. \u201cWhat the fuck, Yoongi?\u201d\n\u201cI just need something, Joons. Something big or shitty enough to give me something, anything, to use against him.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you want to blackmail Wen fucking Gao?\u201d\n\u201cIf it's necessary then yes.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d Namjoon takes a deep breath \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Yoongi begins \u201cJimin can't wait three years.\u201d\nNamjoon opens his mouth to say something but Yoongi stops him before he can even start.\n\u201cNamjoon, it's not just because Jimin can't take it, it's because he probably won't see the end of those three years.\u201d\n\u201cYoons.\u201d Namjoon presses his lips together \u201cHave you ever thought that maybe, just maybe, Jimin is using you? That he seduced you or something just to get out of this?\u201d\nYes. He thought about it. He thought about it so many times that Yoongi lost count. But then, every single time he had those doubts, he remember the way Jimin smiles at him sometimes, of how his eyes light up whenever Yoongi talks to him and of the way his eyes follow his movements as if he's witnessing a god walking.\n\u201cHe's not.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cAnd even if he is, I don't care.\u201d\nNamjoon looks at him for a full minute, eyes intense as they try to understand what Yoongi's thinking, what he's not telling him. In the end, he sighs.\n\u201cI'll do my best.\u201d he says \u201cI know some people who might have something. And most importantly, Gao has so many fucking enemies, I'm sure someone is willing to snitch on him with enough money.\u201d\nYoongi hums.\n\u201cIf the money doesn't work then cohertion will.\u201d the man says \u201cI'm serious, Namjoon. I don't care if you need to break bones, I need information.\u201d\n\u201cI get it.\u201d Namjoon takes a deep breath, shaking his head \u201cBut it might take a while.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know that you know. I know you're patient, you know how this stuff works. But you just told me that Jimin might not resist much so this is why I'm telling you. So that you warn him.\u201d\nYoongi swallows the feeling of dread that threatens to eat him alive and manages to nod.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d he croaks \u201cOkay.\u201d\nNamjoon sighs loudly and throws his head back, staring at the ceiling.\n\u201cI really hope you know what you're doing brother.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe days go by and none of them mention the kiss. Yoongi doesn't because he's terrified, Jimin probably has even more reasons.\nThe days go by and Jimin, at some point, stopped smiling.\nYoongi notices during one afternoon: Jimin is sitting on the couch as usual, a book open on his lap. Usually, Jimin would be reading with a soft, careless smile but this time he's just staring at the wall, book forgotten, eyes tired and lips pressed firmly together.\n\u201cJimin?\u201d\nThe boy trains his gaze on Yoongi.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cPeachy.\u201d\nYoongi gulps. \u201cI mean it, are you okay?\u201d\nJimin snorts, shaking his head and staring at Yoongi like he's something unbelievable.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Jimin repeats with so much venom that Yoongi freezes \u201cNo, Yoongi, I'm not fucking okay.\u201d\nA heavy silence falls after those words and Jimin looks back on that goddamn wall. Yoongi hates it. He hates the silence, he hates the fact that Jimin is so stressed and tired that he used that voice with him, he hates that Jimin feels the need to put a barrier between them to defend himself. He hates it.\nAfter a while, Jimin takes a deep breath.\n\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d he whispers \u201cI shouldn't get mad at you, you were just worried.\u201d\nYoongi goes to sit from his desk to the couch next to Jimin, their knees brushing together.\n\u201cIt's fine, Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not.\u201d the boy retorts weakly \u201cBut it's not your fault if I'm like this, so I'm sorry. It's just... he's been in a bad mood lately. He's always in a bad mood lately. I swear, I'm always fucking holding my breath and tiptoeing around him so that he doesn't fucking snap at me.\u201d Jimin glances at him \u201cI don't think the deal is going so well.\u201d\nYoongi frowns.\n\u201cLast time he was here he said it was going great.\u201d he says and Jimin shakes his head.\n\u201cI'm pretty sure something went wrong. That some issue came up and everything got more complicated. So of course he's always in a shitty mood.\u201d\n\u201cIs it okay that you're here?\u201d\nJimin shrugs. \u201cHe's never home, just during the night. But he makes the best use out of those few hours.\u201d\nYoongi doesn't want to ask, he doesn't want to know, but there's that part of him that it's so fucking concerned that pushes him to inquire.\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\nJimin lets out a shaky breath, massaging his neck.\n\u201cNothing physical, actually. He just... says stuff to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d\nJimin's expression twists into something awful, something like shame and sorrow and loathe and Yoongi hates it. God, he hates it.\n\u201cYou know that nothing he says it's true, right?\u201d Yoongi murmurs, trying to catch Jimin's gaze \u201cNothing. You need to keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Jimin sniffles \u201cBut it feels real.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin is, once again, late. It happens a lot lately and Yoongi tries not to worry, he really does, but it's impossible.\nSo when the doorbell finally rings Yoongi lets out a sigh of relief and goes to open for Jimin.\n\u201cHello.\u201d Jimin says, voice tight.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Yoongi steps aside and Jimin enters \u201cYou're late.\u201d\n\u201cSomething came up.\u201d the boy replies as he takes off his coat and drops it on the couch.\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Yoongi asks, closing the door.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Jimin takes out of his jeans pocket the usual piece of paper \u201cOrder.\u201d\nYoongi takes the paper, keeping his eyes on Jimin. He doesn't look good. He's tense, he keeps looking around, his lips chapped and God, his skin is ashen.\n\u201cJimin.\u201d Yoongi tries \u201cAre you sure you're-\u201d\n\u201cCan I use the toilet?\u201d Jimin interrupts him \u201cI need to take a piss.\u201d\nYoongi slowly nods.\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\nJimin takes off, walking quickly to the toilet.\nOnce Yoongi is alone he goes to the kitchen and starts the fire under the kettle so that he can make some tea. He goes back to the couch, sitting heavily and he decides to check the new order.\n\u201cWhy does he need so much fucking valium?\u201d Yoongi murmurs \u201cAnd enough with the goddamn morphine.\u201d\nThe minutes pass and Jimin still hasn't come back from the toilet. Yoongi wonders if he should just let him be but there's a voice in the back of his head that screams at him that something's wrong, that Jimin looks way too on the edge, so he stands up and walks to the toilet.\nThe door's closed and Yoongi knocks twice.\n\u201cEverything alright there?\u201d he asks, he gets no response \u201cYou've been in there for a while.\u201d\nThere's silence for a while before Yoongi can faintly hear Jimin's sobbing and immediately Yoongi opens the door.\nJimin is on his knees, clutching tightly the hems of the toilet, face pale and wet with tears.\n\u201cShit, what's wrong?\u201d Yoongi asks.\nJimin opens his mouth to answer but suddenly he bends over the toilet, retching violently and Yoongi is immediately by his side. He moves Jimin's hair from his damp forehead as the boy vomits, body shaking and the stench of bile filling the bathroom.\n\u201cIt's okay, just let it out.\u201d Yoongi says, rubbing at his back \u201cShit, if you were sick you could've just said so. Why did you come if you felt so bad?\u201d\nJimin whimpers and he shakes his head.\n\u201cI'm n-not... fuck.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay, why don't you get up? Can you do that?\u201d\nAgain, Jimin shakes his head.\n\u201cWell, you can't stay like this, at least try to sit down, yeah? With your back against the wall, until you feel better.\u201d\nJimin doesn't move so Yoongi takes the matter in his own hands and carefully pulls Jimin away from the toilet. Yoongi is met with no resistance whatsoever so he keeps pushing him until his back is against the cool tiles of the wall and he's sitting down.\n\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d\nJimin blinks a few times before lifting his eyes until they meet Yoongi's.\n\u201cI'm kinky, you know?\u201d\nYoongi knits his eyebrows. Jimin's voice is awfully void of emotion and his eyes are far too hazy.\n\u201cJimin, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cI have so many kinks.\u201d he says \u201cSo many. I feel like it's a natural thing when you do my job for so many years. Or maybe not. I don't know. But seriously, Yoongi, so much nasty shit turns me on, it's ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cJimin-\u201d\n\u201cGunplay is one of them. I fucking love it. There's something about it that just... maybe it's the way a gun feels against your temple when you're being fucked, the weight of it. Even if you know it's not loaded it just feels so fucking good, you know how dangerous that thing can be, the power it has over a human being, so fuck I love it.\u201d\nYoongi holds his breath and he can barely make out what Jimin is telling him because the boy is shaking so much, and his voice is weak even though he's speaking too fast, words overlapping each other, barely taking a breath between every sentence.\n\u201cAnd he's in such a shitty mood! Such a fucking bad mood, he's so angry at me so I thought that maybe if I made him happy he'd calm down! Just for a while! I thought \u201cmake him happy Jimin, so that he lets you breath for a while\u201d. And so I told him!\u201d Jimin stares at him, eyes blown wide, breath coming out short \u201cI told him Yoongi! I told him that I really like gunplay and you should've seen the look on his fucking face. He was fucking ecstatic and I thought I made it, you know? I thought that he was going to be happy.\u201d finally, he pauses \u201cI fucked up so bad. I should've never... what was I thinking? At this point I think I'm just looking for it, I'm fucking asking for it, what was I expecting?!\u201d\n\u201cJimin, I need you to calm down.\u201d Yoongi takes a deep breath \u201cYou need to tell me what happened, but you have to calm down.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what he kept saying?\u201d Jimin continues and it doesn't look like he heard a word of what Yoongi said \u201cImagine it's him\u201d.\nYoongi's blood runs cold and he feels his entire body freezing.\n\u201dYou want that, don't you? You want him to fuck you. So imagine it's him\u201d. Jimin tilts his head to the side -\u201dImagine that it's him fucking you now. I should've never told him. It was even loaded, what was I thinking?\u201d\n\u201cJimin!\u201d Yoongi shouts and finally, finally, Jimin's eyes focus on him \u201cJimin, what did he do?\u201d\n\u201cHe used a gun.\u201d\nThe words linger in the air and Yoongi can't understand what he's trying to tell him.\n\u201cIt was loaded. And he used a gun.\u201d\n\u201cI don't-\u201d\n\u201cHe fucked me open with it.\u201d a pause \u201cI can even remember the model. 45 ACP Smith and Wesson. He told me. I couldn't even move because he had his finger on the trigger and he kept saying that if I tried to move he would have shot me and he said is this how you wanna die? With a bullet up your ass?, I couldn't move. I was frozen, I was so fucking scared and it hurt and I couldn't even speak 'cause I was so terrified. It was loaded and I just let it happen and it hurt so fucking bad-\u201d\nJimin stops talking abruptly when he notices Yoongi's hands trying to reach his face.\n\u201cIt's me.\u201d Yoongi tries, not moving any further \u201cIt's just me.\u201d\nYoongi sees the moment Jimin breaks. His face screws up and he chokes on a sob, raising a hand and clutching at Yoongi's sweater, trying to pull him closer.\nYoongi lets Jimin snake his arms around his waist and he lets him hide his face on his chest, holding him lightly so that if he wants to pull back he'll meet no resistance. He lets him cry whilst he caresses his hair and he forces himself not to break as well because Jimin needs him now and he can't be weak.\nThey stay on that floor for what feels like hours until Jimin's body isn't shaking so much and his sobs quiet down.\n\u201cI'll get you out of there.\u201d Yoongi whispers but the words seem too loud in the quiet \u201cI swear it.\u201d\nSilence again.\n\u201cJimin, I'm so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cCan I...\u201d Jimin gulps \u201cCan I stay here tonight? He's away for two days. Or was it three? I can't remember. But can i stay?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, don't make me go back there.\u201d\n\u201cYou're staying here tonight.\u201d Yoongi sighs \u201cYou're staying here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes Yoongi a lot of coaxing and soothing in order to convince Jimin to stand up so that he can sleep for a while.\nYoongi manages to drag Jimin to his bed and he lays there with his eyes closed whilst Yoongi tucks him in.\n\u201cDo you need anything? You should drink some water.\u201d\nJimin opens his eyes.\n\u201cCan you call Tae?\u201d\nYoongi nods. \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe moment Taehyung and Jungkook arrive at the penthouse, Yoongi is quickly kicked out of his room so that Tae and Jimin can be alone.\nYoongi is sitting on his armchair, a cigarette burning between his fingers, and Jungkook is sprawled over the couch, gaze fixed on the ceiling.\nYoongi knows they're running out of time. He had hoped that maybe they would've had more days, maybe even weeks, but clearly that wasn't the case. This whole situation was getting out of hand too quickly and Yoongi feels powerless, which is pretty insane considering that power is all he ever had.\n\u201cWe could cut his balls.\u201d\nYoongi blinks a few times and then he looks at Jungkook.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cI said that maybe we could cut his balls.\u201d he repeats, unfazed \u201cOr better, we could shoot him in the balls. Or we could fuck him with a gun and then shoot him in the balls.\u201d\n\u201cShit, kid...\u201d\n\u201cHanging him by the balls sounds nice too.\u201d Jungkook sighs \u201cSo many ideas, so little balls.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why everyone is actually scared of you?\u201d Yoongi asks \u201c'Cause I never understood how someone could be scared of you but now I do.\u201d\nJungkook frowns.\n\u201cLike you don't wanna do the same.\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cIn fact, I don't.\u201d Yoongi takes a lungful of smoke.\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage kid. Doesn't mean I don't wanna hurt him. Shit...\u201d Yoongi shakes his head \u201cI'd fucking torture him 'till he turns into a weeping mess, 'till his fucking bladder gives up on him, 'till he shits himself and then I'd make him eat his own shit. But I ain't getting near his balls. That's just wrong.\u201d\nJungkook slowly raises himself so that he's sitting up, staring at Yoongi with a blank expression.\n\u201cAnd you say I'm scary?\u201d\nYoongi rolls his eyes and in that moment Taehyung starts coming down the stairs, sighing heavily.\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d Jungkook asks.\nTaehyung doesn't answer, he just pats on Jungkook's leg so that the boy makes space for him on the couch and he sits down.\n\u201cSo.\u201d he starts \u201cHe's not good. Like, at all. But he's coping better than I expected.\u201d\nYoongi allows himself to sigh in relief. If Taehyung said that Jimin was holding himself together than Yoongi trusted him.\n\u201cCrazily enough, the good news is that Jimin isn't exactly new to this kind of treatment so he knows what to do in order not to just... crumble down.\u201d\n\u201cTreatment?\u201d Jungkook frowns.\n\u201cRape.\u201d Taehyung says \u201cYoongi, he's not good.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don't. You think you do, but you don't.\u201d Taehyung shakes his head \u201cThis kind of shit fucks you up, okay? And Jimin is going through a lot, there's not just the physical abuse, there's the mental one. Gao is fucking him up in the head and he can't stay there. You gotta do something.\u201d\n\u201cI'm working on it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, work faster then. I don't know how, but you gotta work faster, 'cause there is no way Jimin will be able to put up with this shit for much longer. He's tired, he's fucking drained and he can't take this anymore.\u201d Taehyung sighs \u201cThe thing is, this situation has two bad scenarios in store for us. In the first one, Gao kills him. In the second one Jimin kills himself. And trust me Yoongi, he could. I can see it in his eyes that he's considering it, he's too fucking gone.\u201d\nYoongi takes in the words, let them sink in and when his mind finally processes them he knows his hands are shaking.\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d he asks \u201cI mean now. What do I do now?\u201d\nTaehyung shrugs. \u201cJust spoil him. Let him rest. Don't leave him alone.\u201d the boy stands up and Jungkook does as well, following him \u201cThread carefully. He's frail as glass right now.\u201d\nYoongi nods. \u201cThank you Taehyung.\u201d\nTaehyung smiles at that, sympathetically, but he still smiles and then he makes his way out of the penthouse with Jungkook.\nAfter taking a few steading breaths, Yoongi starts climbing up the stairs to join Jimin in his bedroom.\nHe slowly opens the door and the room is dimly lit only by the bedside lamp.\nWhen he approaches the bed, Yoongi sees that Jimin is asleep, curled up on his side, hair falling messily over his forehead and his face peaceful and relaxed in a way that Yoongi hasn't seen in a long time.\nYoongi quietly sits down on the free side of the bed, careful as to not wake the boy up, his back against the headboard.\nYoongi is stuck. He's fucking stuck and it feels disgusting, not knowing what to do is absolutely sickening.\nWhat was Jimin thinking when he signed that contract? How desperate was he to think that working for a man like Gao could be a good idea?\nWithout realizing, his hand moves to Jimin's hair, smoothing them out, stroking the locks carelessly. A soft sigh and Jimin opens his eyes.\n\u201cDid I wake you up?\u201d Yoongi asks and Jimin nods \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay.\u201d\n\u201cYou should sleep.\u201d\n\u201cDon't want to.\u201d\n\u201cYou should really-\u201d\n\u201cI'm scared of what I'll dream.\u201d Jimin interrupts him \u201cI don't like being this weak. I've never been this weak or helpless before.\u201d a short pause \u201cI hate him for making me so weak.\u201d\n\u201cI hate him for many other reasons.\u201d Yoongi whispers, he wants to keep the room as quiet as possible \u201cBut really kid, you need to sleep.\u201d\nJimin hums before looking up at Yoongi.\n\u201cSleep with me? Please.\u201d\nYoongi should say no. In a moment of clarity, he realizes that they're both too far gone to actually think that taking precautions at this point would change anything. They should've taken them way before, now it's too late.\nSo Yoongi lifts the covers of the duvet and slips under them, laying on the bed next to Jimin.\nThey stay in silence for a long time after that, Yoongi's hand find its way to Jimin's hair again and their breaths mix together in the room.\nThen Jimin slowly drags himself closer to Yoongi until he gathers enough courage to put his head on the other man's chest, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. Yoongi holds him closer, his fingers now caressing softly the boy's neck.\n\u201cYou-\u201d Jimin starts \u201cYou think you're responsible for this.\u201d\nYoongi gulps.\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. The thing is, Yoongi, that you've given me a taste of what being happy would feel like.\u201d Jimin sighs \u201cAnd now I'm addicted.\u201d\nYoongi lets a few moments of silence linger on, the words he wants to say are heavy on his tongue.\n\u201cI'm sorry. Hoseok warned me that this could happen and I knew the risks. But I just couldn't help myself.\u201d\nJimin lifts his head just a bit, enough to look at him in the eyes.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI told you.\u201d he murmurs, Jimin's breath breaks on his neck and it's wonderful \u201cI want you to be happy. There were moments when you were happy, even if just a bit, like that time I took you to the coffee shop and you looked carefree in the car. I got addicted to those moments and I wanted to give you more of those.\u201d\nJimin lays down again.\n\u201cYou did.\u201d he says \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n\u201cI'm getting you out of there. I'll find a way, I've got Namjoon working on it.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds impossible.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want Jimin?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cFrom life. What do you want from it?\u201d\nThis time, the silence is long and heavy, so tense that Yoongi has trouble breathing. When Jimin finally speaks his voice is so low that Yoongi almost can't hear him.\n\u201cI spent my whole life surviving. Breathing. That's all I've been doing. I'm only breathing. I can't do just that forever, I want to live. I want freedom.\u201d\nYoongi nods and he closes his eyes, Jimin's body warm against his, the smell of cigarettes and expensive perfume makes its way inside Yoongi's brain.\n\u201cI'll give you freedom and more if that's what you want.\u201d Yoongi stirs a little, getting more comfortable and snaking his arm around Jimin's waist \u201cYou said he's away for three days?\u201d\n\u201cHe'll be back on Sunday from Thai.\u201d Jimin replies, his voice thick with sleep.\n\u201cStay here until Saturday then.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cYou hate it there.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Jimin replies \u201cOkay. I'll stay.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201c'm tired.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nAnd just like that Jimin's asleep, breath slow, body limp.\nYoongi falls asleep shortly after.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he wakes up the next morning it is to an empty bed, warmth gone, only a note scribbled quickly on a piece of paper left.\n\u00a0\nSorry, that's all that's written there.\n\u00a0\nYoongi cries for the first time in what feels like years.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJin stares at him for a long time before he takes a deep breath and stands up from the arm chair, walking in circles around the room.\n\u201cYou know what's the crazy part?\u201d the man asks Yoongi \u201cThat right now the only solution that comes to my mind is to literally to kidnap Jimin.\u201d\nYoongi nods. \u201cDon't think I haven't considered it.\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell, Yoons.\u201d Jin shakes his head \u201cA fucking gun.\u201d\n\u201cI'm so fucking worried.\u201d Yoongi sighs \u201cI swear to god, I've never been more worried in my life. He just left like that, I have no idea of what he's doing.\u201d\n\u201cCan't you call him?\u201d\nYoongi shakes his head.\n\u201cHe doesn't have a phone, Gao took it away from him the moment he signed that fucking contract.\u201d\nSeokjin stops dead in his tracks and looks back at Yoongi.\n\u201cThis whole story started because of that contract.\u201d he says \u201cCan't we do anything about it?\u201d\nYoongi scoffs.\n\u201cLike what, burn it?\u201d\n\u201cIf that contract disappears Jimin is free.\u201d\n\u201cThe contract won't disappear.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jin agrees \u201cBut it can be replaced.\u201d\nYoongi frowns, looking at the older man.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nJin doesn't answer him for a long time, standing still in the middle of the room, his eyes focused on the ground, eyebrows knitted together and lips slightly agape. Yoongi knew better than try and take some answers out of his friend in this moment, when Seokjin started thinking like that it was hard to get him out of his trance.\n\u201cI need to talk to Namjoon.\u201d he finally says, after another minute of silence \u201cRight now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi stands up from the armchair and tries to follow Seokjin, who's already taking his coat and shrugging it on \u201cJin, talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cNot now.\u201d he replies \u201cLet me speak with Namjoon first, then we'll talk.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cYoongi.\u201d Jin says sternly, staring at him with his eyes narrowed \u201cI am not going to give you false hopes, so let me speak with Namjoon first.\u201d\nYoongi sighs.\n\u201cYou have a plan.\u201d\n\u201cA poor attempt at one, yes.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Yoongi nods \u201cOkay, talk with Namjoon.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe concern Yoongi has for Jimin quickly turns into dread. Since last thursday he hasn't heard from the boy. Usually Jimin would drop at his house in the afternoon, especially on saturdays, but this time he hasn't. Will he even come on thursday for the usual drop off? At this point, Yoongi doesn't know.\nWhat if he doesn't come back ever again.\nThe moment that thought manages to get inside his head, dread turns into panic.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut then monday comes and there's a knock on his door. When Yoongi opens it he only has time to see a blur of pink hair before Jimin is throwing his arms around Yoongi's neck, holding him so tightly that it hurts.\n\u201cYou're back.\u201d Yoongi mutters, hugging Jimin back and closing his eyes in relief \u201cGod, you're back.\u201d\n\u201cGet me out of there.\u201d\nYoongi tilts his head a little, trying to get a look at Jimin's face, but the boy has his forehead against his shoulder.\n\u201cI told you I would, it's just going to take time.\u201d\n\u201cNo, please. Now.\u201d\n\u201cJimin.\u201d\n\u201cI can't stay there!\u201d the boy screams and lets go of Yoongi, shoving him away.\nYoongi stumbles back before he gets a hold of his balance again and now he can finally see Jimin's face. Pale doesn't even begin to describe how ashen his skin is, but that's not what worries him the most: the new bruises do.\n\u201cFucking shit, Jimin.\u201d Yoongi hisses as he gets closer to Jimin, gripping his chin and checking the wounds. These are far worse than those he had last time, these look fucking ferocious. His bottom lip is split open, there are yeloowish marks round his left eye and Yoongi can see more bruises down his neck and he's sure as hell that the rest of Jimin's body doesn't look any better \u201cWhat the fuck did he do?\u201d\n\u201cHe found out that I spent the night here.\u201d Jimin says and he shakes his head \u201cYoongi, I don't give a fuck about the injuries, I don't give a fuck that he hit me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI told you!\u201d Jimin screams again, rage coloring his cheeks \u201cI told you that it could be worse and it's worst now, so much worst!\u201d\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\n\u201cNo! No, it's not the hitting!\u201d Jimin closes his eyes and takes a deep breath \u201cHe drugged me!\u201d\nYoongi lets the words sink in before he gets a hold of Jimin's wrist and pulls him away from the still open door. \u201cOkay, you go sit down on that fucking couch.\u201d Jimin follows the order and Yoongi closes the door, taking a deep breath before he joins the boy on the sofa.\n\u201cI'm sorry I pushed you.\u201d Jimin mutters, staring at his hands.\n\u201cI don't care about that, tell me what happened. What do you mean he drugged you?\u201d\nJimin's body stiffens, his face twisting into disgust. It's the first time Yoongi sees this kind of reaction in him, this rage.\n\u201cThe fucking prick.\u201d the boy hisses with venom in his voice \u201cHe put Valium in my wine, I'm sure he did. I was fucking out of it, dunno how much he used, but I was out of it, too relaxed. Next thing I know I was tied up on the bed and the asshole was sitting next to me with a spoon and a lighter.\u201d\nYoongi clenches his jaw and tires to swallow, but his mouth feels too dry.\n\u201cYou're too feisty lately, that's what he said. Did Min fuck you so good that now you think you can do what you want? Has he been spoiling you? That means I have to train you again.\u201d Jimin starts fumbling in the pockets of his coat before he manages to find his pack of cigarettes and he takes one out of it, putting it betweent his lips and trying to light it up with the lighter, failing \u201cLight it for me, will you? My hands are shaking.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Yoongi takes the lighter from Jimin's hands and click it, getting the flame on the edge of the cigarette. The boy takes a lungful and blows smoke out.\n\u201cI begged him. Really, I fucking begged him to stop, told him I would never do it again, he didn't fucking listen. He took the siringe and drugged me.\u201d\n\u201cHeroin?\u201d Yoongi asks \u201cHe used heroin?\u201d\nJimin nods. \u201cI don't even know what- It felt so fucking good, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn't supposed to like it. Fuck, I didn't, I was scared out of my mind, but it felt better than anything I've ever experienced.\u201d\n\u201cI know, Jimin.\u201d\n\u201cThat shit is scary.\u201d Jimin takes a drag of the cigarette, tipping nervously his fingers on his knee \u201cI don't even know how much time I was out, a moment I was there, the other I was fucking floating. It felt like minutes, but I guess it wasn't.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was a couple of hours.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d Jimin shakes his head \u201cI forgot about it all for a moment. I wasn't even there, I felt absolutely nothing, saw nothing. I was so- content. No worries. No fear. No pain. It was fucking bliss.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, heroin does that to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut then it stopped working.\u201d Jimin lowers his gaze \u201cI don't know what happened. Dunno if he fucked me or just got off on it. Guess the latter. I came to myself and I was naked with his cum dried on my chest.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cThis happened last night. He wasn't home, I knew that. He had this flight to Honk Kong, he's staying there for like three days. He just fucking left me there, the fucking piece of shit.\u201d a short silence follows \u201cI shouldn't be here. They'll tell him, I wasn't so subtle when I left. They'll thell him and this time he'll fucking kill me.\u201d\n\u201cYou're not going back there. You're staying here and this time you're staying for real. Until he comes back from Hong Kong.\u201d Yoongi looks at him \u201cYou hear me? No leaving at the crack ass of dawn with just a fucking note, okay? You're staying and we figure something out.\u201d\nJimin doesn't answer him for a while. He licks at his bottom lip, flinching a little at the pain and then he manages to nod.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Yoongi slumps back on the couch and his hand finds its way to hold Jimin's \u201cFucking hell, Jiminie.\u201d\n\u201cJiminie?\u201d the boy asks.\n\u201cNickname. Just came out.\u201d\n\u201cI like it.\u201d Jimin lays back on the couch next to Yoongi \u201cI'm sorry I left like that the other time. I wasn't really myself.\u201d\n\u201cIt's okay. It's good to see you so angry, though. Last time you were just-\u201d\n\u201cPathetic?\u201d\n\u201cTired.\u201d Yoongi squeezes his hand \u201cNever pathetic.\u201d\nThey stay quiet for a while, Yoongi finds solace in the sound of Jimin's breathing and in the warmth of his skin.\n\u201cHow does it work with Heroin?\u201d Jimin asks \u201cLike, am I going to get hooked on it? I don't know how it works.\u201d\nYoongi shakes his head.\n\u201cNah, as long as you don't take it again soon you ain't getting addicted. That's why it's dangerous, you don't feel the lack of it at first, you don't miss it, so you just go for it again cuz you think you're safe. That you're strong, you're not getting addicted. The moment you feel the abstinence then you're addicted and you're fucked, but that's not gonna happen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he gives it to me again?\u201d\nYoongi doesn't answer. He can't give him false hopes, he can't lie and say that he's not going back to that house.\n\u201cI want to run away, Yoongi. But he'd find me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like he's actually going to kill me soon.\u201d Jimin closes his eyes \u201cHis men keep saying he will. That he's getting tired of me.\u201d\n\u201cHe's pissed because he knows you don't belong to him.\u201d\n\u201cThat's true, I don't.\u201d Jimin turns his head to look at Yoongi \u201cDo I belong to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou belong to yourself.\u201d\nJimin hums. \u201cBut I wouldn't mind belonging to you.\u201d\nYoongi smiles a little and he shakes his head. \u201cDon't go cheesy on me.\u201d Jimin giggles softly \u201cHave you eaten anything since last night?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWe're ordering food. Namjoon, Hoseok and I always get food from this italian restaurant, it's not bad.\u201d\n\u201cI like italian.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Go and get a shower and wear something of mine. Just... try to relax, okay?\u201d\nJimin nods. \u201cCan we pretend for a while?\u201d\n\u201cPretend?\u201d\n\u201cThat we're normal. Just for today.\u201d\n\u201cWe can do whatever you want today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPretending, Yoongi finds out, is nice.\nIt's nice to pretend they're somewhat a normal couple, eating cheap italian food sitting on the floor, looking at an old movie on tv, with Jimin wearing a pair of his sweats and one of his huge black hoodies, pink hair wavy after the shower, skin no longer ashen but sunkissed.\nIt's nice to pretend.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you ever seen Detroit in september?\u201d\nYoongi looks down at Jimin, resting his head on his chest with his arms snaked around his waist, legs tangled together under the blankets, the lights in the room are dimmed low and it's quiet.\n\u201cNo. I've been to Detroit like once, but it was in November.\u201d Yoongi replies, fingers lazily massaging Jimin's scalp.\n\u201cIt's beautiful in september. Summer hasn't really ended in Detroit when it's september.\u201d\n\u201cI'll take you there.\u201d\n\u201cYou like making promises.\u201d\n\u201cPromises are like goals.\u201d Yoongi murmurs \u201cIf I set a goal I tend to reach it.\u201d\nJimin hums.\n\u201cWhere else do you want to go?\u201d\n\u201cJapan. In spring. I want to see the cherry blossoms.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll go there as well.\u201d\n\u201cI've never been on a ferris wheel.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll do that too.\u201d\n\u201cWill you kiss me on the ferris wheel once we're on top?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so fucking cheesy?\u201d\n\u201cI want to do all those clich\u00e9d things couples do.\u201d\n\u201cThen I'll kiss you on a ferris wheel too.\u201d Yoongi laughs quietly \u201cYou're demanding.\u201d\n\u201cI'm spoiled.\u201d\n\u201cI'll fucking spoil you rotten.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know me so well.\u201d Jimin sighs \u201cHow about we stop pretending for now.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt hurts.\u201d\n\u201cThen let's stop.\u201d a pause \u201cWhat do you want to do tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cDon't know.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to go to that coffee shop again?\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201c'm tired.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise of agreement and closes his eyes, slowly drifting off.\n\u00a0\nWhen he wakes up it's because of a foreing weight on his lap and breathing fanning his cheeks. Yoongi slowly opens his eyes and he sees in the darkness of the room Jimin straddling his lap, mouth agape, staring down at him.\n\u201cJimin? What are you-\u201d\n\u201cThere's something else I want.\u201d Jimin says \u201cAnd I want it now.\u201d\nYoongi, still heavy with sleep, just frowns. The moment Jimin drags his hips down Yoongi gasps, hands going immediately to Jimin's waist.\n\u201cWait, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think I'm doing?\u201d Jimin grinds his ass on Yoongi's hips again, this time deliberately slowly \u201cDon't you want me?\u201d\n\u201cJimin.\u201d the air around him is suddenly way too hot \u201cListen to me-\u201d\n\u201cI'll make you feel so good, Yoongi.\u201d Jimin closes his eyes, his hips moving faster \u201cAnd I know you'd fill me up so good. Stretching me open.\u201d\nYoongi tries to speak but all that comes out of his mouth is a choked off moan as he feels himself hardening under Jimin, the friction almost too good.\n\u201cFuck, Yoongi, I want you in my mouth.\u201d Jimin sighs, throwing his head back and letting his hands wander on Yoongi's chest \u201cWant you inside me, I- ah- I want you to make me cry, fuck. You've been so good to me, Yoongi, you deserve this. Tell me I've been good, shit, tell me I'm good.\u201d\n\u201cJimin, please-\u201d\n\u201cI want you to love me Yoongi.\u201d\nThat's enough. Yoongi pulls himself up and cups Jimin's face, swiping his thumbs over his cheeks.\n\u201cStop this. Now. Hey, look at me.\u201d Yoongi's voice is firm and Jimin drags his eyes to him \u201cStop this. It's not gonna happen like this, you hear me?\u201d\nJimin halts his movements, frowning at the older man.\n\u201cI thought-\u201d Jimin gulps \u201cDon't you want me?\u201d\nYoongi sighs. \u201cI'll want you when you want me as well.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\u201cJimin, I'm not having you because you think I diserve a fucking reward. I'm not fucking you because you think you need to pay me back for what I've done for you!\u201d Yoongi wets his lips \u201cJimin, you're not for sale when you're with me.\u201d\n\u201cI- I'm sorry, I-\u201d the boy's voice breaks \u201cI don't know what-\u201d\n\u201cDon't cry. Don't fucking cry.\u201d Yoongi takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down \u201cPlease, don't cry. You're gonna get through this, you're going to be fine, you're going to be happy, I fucking swear to you, I'll make you happy. Just don't cry.\u201d\nJimin lets out a ragged breath before he slowly nods, biting the inside of his cheeks.\n\u201cYou say you want me to love you.\u201d Yoongi says and Jimin nods again \u201cI do. I thought it was obvious.\u201d\nJimin smiles weakly. \u201cIt ain't obvious until you say it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd just like that you made another promise.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201d Jimin sighs. He closes his eyes and lets his fingertips graze Yoongi's face \u201cI love you. So much.\u201d\n\u201cIt's gonna be okay. I know it. If everything goes to shit I'll just kidnap you, how about that.\u201d\nJimin giggles at that, eyes disappearing in crescents. \u201cThat doesn't sound so bad.\u201d\n\u201cI know right? We could be the gay version of Bonnie and Clyde.\u201d\n\u201cChasing the american dream whilst running away from a chinese sick fuck?\u201d Jimin shakes his head \u201cThat's not how the Bonnie and Clyde concept works.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Yoongi kisses Jimin's wrist \u201cWe'll make it work.\u201d\n\u201cSo many promises.\u201d\n\u201cThat's all I really have to give you right now.\u201d\n\u201cThat's the problem. You give too much. You give me too much, I don't give you anything.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, you don't have to give me anything. Now, can you please lie down and try to get some sleep?\u201d\n\u201cSuch an old man.\u201d\n\u201cShush.\u201d\nJimin just pushes Yoongi down until he's laying with his back on the bed and decides to just lie down on him, tangling together their legs again and setting his face next to Yoongi's.\n\u201cYou ain't exactly a feather, y'know?\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d\nYoongi chuckles, his fingers caressing the space between Jimin's shoulder blazes. \u201cWhy the fuck do you smell so good?\u201d\n\u201cI'm a miracle.\u201d\n\u201c's that so?\u201d\n\u201cYou're supposed to say yes, Jimin, you are.\u201d\n\u201cAin't gonna happen.\u201d\n\u201cYou smell good too, though.\u201d a pause \u201cI really like your hands.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going to just spit compliments now?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. You have nice lips.\u201d\n\u201cNice doesn't even begin to describe how good my lips look.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine, you've got the best lips, you happy now?\u201d\nJimin hums. \u201cYou're pretty.\u201d\n\u201cPretty? I'm the pretty one, seriously?\u201d\n\u201cPretty boy.\u201d\n\u201cDon't you dare.\u201d\n\u201cTwink material, really.\u201d\n\u201cI'll make you sleep on the couch, Jiminie.\u201d\n\u201cI want something else. Now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt's gonna be cheesy.\u201d\n\u201cJust say it.\u201d\nJimin lifts his head a little, eyes almost pleading. \u201cKiss me?\u201d\nYoongi sighs. \u201cWhy do you even have to ask?\u201d\nThe thing about kissing Jimin is that it's familiar, it always has been. He tastes of cigarettes and promises that he doesn't want to break, he tastes of freedom and danger. Yoongi is intoxicated. He always has been.\nAnd this time it's not desperate, nor hurried or hungry. It's slow and deep, careful and interrupted only by whispered I love yous, with Jimin's hands clutching at his shirt to pull him impossibly closer, Yoongi's hand that always find their ways to Jimin's hair. It's like breathing, only better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin wakes up with the sound of Yoongi's urgent voice. He lazily opens an eye and he sees the older man sitting at the edge of the bed, back to him.\n\u201cSay it again.\u201d Yoongi says, there's silence for a while and Jimin realizes that Yoongi is speaking with someone on the phone \u201cAre you serious? Shit. Shit, Namjoon.\u201d\nJimin frowns and stirs a little, then he drags his body closer to Yoongi, who notices he's awake and sends him a quick look \u201cWhat do you mean when? Right fucking now, that's when. No fucking way we're wasting any more time. Get to it, tell the others.\u201d another pause \u201cOkay. Thank you, Joons, thank you.\u201d\nYoongi ends the call and turns to Jimin.\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Jimin says and Yoongi smiles.\nJimin looks a little too adorable in the morning, that's for sure, and that's also a sight he could get used to real quick.\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Yoongi wets his lips \u201cI have news but I'm not sure you'll like them.\u201d\n\u201cWhere's my good morning kiss?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cI am needy, Min Yoongi.\u201d\nYoongi rolls his eyes but still leans in to quickly peck Jimin's lips, the boy hums.\n\u201cThat's better. Now what are these news?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. You're leaving right now and going back to Gao's place.\u201d\nYoongi sees the moment Jimin's smile drops from his face, eyes immediately flooding with worry.\n\u201cWhy? What did I do, what's wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou did nothing, everything's fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou said I could stay, don't make me go there.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me, okay? I don't want you to go back, but we don't have a choice. It's better this way.\u201d\n\u201cYoongi, please-\u201d\n\u201cJimin, the moment Gao comes back in two days you have to tell him something.\u201d Yoongi speaks over him \u201cYou gotta tell him I want to see you both immediately. Both of you. He doesn't even get to have time to put his fucking luggage down, you tell him to haul his ass here.\u201d\nJimin frowns. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I'm getting you out of there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if it doesn't work?\u201d\nYoongi sighs, rubbing his temples. \u201cWhat if you stop repeating that, Hoseok?\u201d\nHoseok rolls his eyes and sits heavily on the couch. \u201cI'm worried.\u201d\n\u201cWe all are.\u201d Jin says \u201cBut it will work.\u201d\n\u201cAnd hey, if it doesn't work-\u201d Jungkook smiles \u201cWe just fucking kill him and then get the fuck out of the country real quick.\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely a bad plan.\u201d Taehyung concedes, propping his chin on Jungkook's shoulder.\n\u201cIt's a shit plan.\u201d Namjoon sighs \u201cBut we ain't gonna need it.\u201d\n\u201cI sure fucking hope so.\u201d Yoongi mutters as he lights up the nth cigarette of the day \u201cThey're late. You said his plane landed three hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cHe's probably gonna make us wait, the pretentious shit.\u201d Namjoon massages his neck \u201cBut he'll come. Trust me, he loves challenges.\u201d\nSeokjin takes a deep breath. \u201cIf it doesn't work we kill him for real.\u201d\nYoongi arches an eyebrow. \u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cFine by me.\u201d Jungkook says and before Yoongi can remind him that he's a fucking kid and he should just shut up when it comes to murder, the intercom buzzes.\nNamjoon takes a deep breath and walks to it, pressing the button to answer. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cGao and his man are here to see mister Min.\u201d the metallic voice says.\n\u201cLet them in.\u201d Namjoon turns around \u201cIt's time people.\u201d\nWaiting seems like a torture, the minutes feel like hours but finally there's a knock on the door.\nHoseok stands up from the sofa and walks to stand just behind Yoongi, so does Seokjin. Taehyung and Jungkook stand where they are, next to each other, and Namjoon opens the door.\nGao walks in with a smug smile on his face and his arm around Jimin's waist.\nThe old man sends a glance at Namjoon as he closes the door behind them. \u201cMin. You invite us over and you don't even open the door for us? What happened to your mann-\u201d\n\u201cHello, Jimin.\u201d Yoongi says, interrupting Gao.\nJimin's eyes widen at the use of his real name, but he still clears his voice \u201cHello, Yoongi.\u201d\n\u201cGao.\u201d Yoongi makes a gesture at him to come over as he sits behind the desk \u201cBoth of you, come sit.\u201d\n\u201cYou've got the whole gang, I see.\u201d Gao says as he walks over to Yoongi, dragging Jimin with him.\nThey both sit down on the two leather chairs set in front of the desk, Jimin sending questions with his eyes to Yoongi.\nYoongi takes a drag of his cigarette, blowing the smoke in Gao's direction.\n\u201cHow are you doing, Jimin?\u201d\nGao's mouth twitches, but he says nothing.\n\u201cI'm-\u201d Jimin gulps \u201cI'm good, thank you.\u201d\nGao's hand goes to the nape of Jimin's neck, squeezing it, Jimin clenches his jaw.\n\u201cAnd Gao, tell me, how was your trip?\u201d Yoongi asks, he sees Namjoon settling behind Gao \u201cHong Kong, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a good trip. Business.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. Your deal. Is it going well?\u201d\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\nYoongi hums. \u201cWhy are you trying to bullshit me, Gao?\u201d\nThe man says nothing for a while, sending quick looks at the two men behind Yoongi and then he starts looking around.\n\u201cI'm confused as to what you want, Min.\u201d he spots Taehyung and he smirks \u201cOh. Don't I know you?\u201d\nTaehyung arches an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou're a pretty little thing, hard to forget.\u201d Gao licks his lips \u201cI'm pretty sure I tried to buy you. I saw you changed your job.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Taehyung replies.\n\u201cNot for sale anymore?\u201d\n\u201cHe isn't.\u201d Jungkook says, voice dangerously low, and Gao laughs.\n\u201cLook at that child, he found himself a sex doll.\u201d Gao's grip on Jimin's neck tightens and the boy's face twists in pain \u201cAren't they the best?\u201d\nJungkook stiffens but doesn't make any move, he's smarter than that.\n\u201cHow about we get down to business, Min.\u201d the man turns to Yoongi \u201cWhy the fuck am I here?\u201d\n\u201cIt's simple, really.\u201d Yoongi raises a hand and Seokjin moves, taking from the drawer of the desk a paper and handing it over Gao, who starts scanning it with a frown.\n\u201cThe fuck is this?\u201d\n\u201cCan't you read?\u201d Yoongi asks \u201cThat's a contract.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that. What for?\u201d\nYoongi tilts his chin to Jimin \u201cFor him.\u201d\nSilence falls in the room, Gao reads the contract with more attention and Yoongi glances at Jimin, the boy staring at him confused.\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Gao asks, setting his eyes on Yoongi.\n\u201cI'm buying him. From you.\u201d\n\u201cBuying him.\u201d\n\u201cIsn't that what you did? I'm new to the business. I'm putting him under my contract. You'll sign that piece of paper and hand Jimin over.\u201d Yoongi smiles \u201cI'll pay you, of course.\u201d\nGao drops the paper on the desk with dismay. \u201cAin't gonna happen. Really, Min, if you wanna fuck him that much just say so.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about your deal, Gao. Why isn't it going well?\u201d\n\u201cMy deal is going great.\u201d\n\u201cIs it because you tried selling them cheap ass weapons saying that it was actually the good stuff?\u201d Yoongi clicks his tongue \u201cThat's a shitty move.\u201d\nGao squints his eyes. \u201cYou think you can win because of this? Seriously, Min, do you even know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cI ain't winning with that.\u201d Yoongi glances at Hoseok and the man takes out of the breast pocket of his jacket an envelope, dropping it in front of Gao \u201cI'm winning with this.\u201d\nGao levels his gaze for a few moments before he lets go of Jimin's neck and takes the envelope in his hands, opening it and frowning at the content. Then his expression shifts to recognition and all the color drains from his face.\n\u201cHow-\u201d\n\u201cYou really should stop taking pictures of the people you fuck.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cEspecially if you shot one in the head. And more especially if the other one is a child.\u201d\nGao glares at him.\n\u201cWhat's her name again?\u201d Yoongi asks Namjoon \u201cVanida?\u201d\n\u201cVanida.\u201d Namjoon confirms.\n\u201cTwelve years old.\u201d Yoongi shakes his head \u201cThat's not really good, Gao.\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking-\u201d\n\u201cI heard that the market for Thai children is hot right now. Damn, Gao, I knew you liked them young, but child prostitution?\u201d Yoongi grimaces \u201cThat's just fucking nasty.\u201d\n\u201cHow-\u201d\n\u201cJust as nasty as using a gun to fuck someone unwillingly.\u201d\n\u201cTell me how-\u201d\n\u201cLoyalty is important in our business, Gao.\u201d Yoongi sits more comfortably on his chair \u201cLoyalty is all we have. I have loyal men, as you can see. You? Not so much. See, that's the problem with using drugs to keep your men on your side. There's always a druglord somewhere who can give them more.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you gonna do, uh?!\u201d Gao exclaims \u201cGo to the police?! I own those fucking pigs.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if you're still going to own a few corrupt policemen when an anonimous men drops these photos to them. I mean, you're in the photos Gao. Your face is there. You're fucking dumb, seriously, and also just plain sick.\u201d Yoongi shrugs \u201cSo, how about we sign that contrack and get this over with?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Min. You just got yourself in neck-deep shit.\u201d Gao grabs Jimin by the arm and stands up.\nYoongi stands up as well and slams his hand on the table hard enough to make Jimin jump.\n\u201cSit the fuck down, you sick fat cunt.\u201d Yoongi hisses \u201cI'm not fucking done.\u201d\nJungkook smoothly moves the hem of his jacket to the side, showing the gun in his belt and Gao stops moving.\n\u201cSee, plan B is just straight up killing you and, honestly, I like this carpet.\u201d Yoongi sits back on the chair \u201cSo how about you get your fat ass on that chair?\u201d\nSeconds go by and no one moves, Jimin has his gaze trained on Yoongi, the tension clear in his stiff expression. Finally, Gao sits down and so does Jimin as he's dragged down on the chair.\n\u201cHere's the deal.\u201d Yoongi sighs \u201cYou sign the contract, you get the money, I get Jimin, we part ways and we part ways for good. No more drugs from me. And you don't make a fucking move, Gao, 'cause I got so many copies of those photos I could just open an art gallery.\u201d\nGao is breathing hard now, somehow his hand is once again on Jimin's neck and Yoongi's getting tired of it really quickly.\n\u201cIf you kill me my men will be cutting your throat before you even realize you're dead.\u201d Gao hisses.\n\u201cYou mean the same men who sold you for morphine and speedball?\u201d Yoongi rolls his eyes \u201cI'm fucking pissing my pants, Gao. Don't you get it? You got nothing on me but I got everything on you.\u201d\nGao opens his mouth to speak but stays quiet when he hears Jimin muttering something under his breath.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Gao asks \u201cYou got something to say, you fucking slut? If it weren't for your greedy ass we wouldn't be here, you know? Oh, you just couldn't help wanting his cock up your-\u201d\n\u201c-me.\u201d Jimin whispers, eyes set on Yoongi.\n\u201cSpeak louder, you pathetic-\u201d\n\u201cLet go of me.\u201d Jimin says, voice clear and steady, as he turns to look at Gao \u201cGet your fucking hands off me. Was that loud enough?\u201d\nGao's face screws up in anger and he moves. The slap on Jimin's face echoes in the room and is hard enough to have the boy falling off the chair and on the floor.\nJungkook's gun is out in a moment, so is Hoseok's but is Namjoon who gets his hands on Gao. He gets the rope he had been keeping in the pocket of his jacket out and quickly puts it around Gao's neck, pulling at it until the men is choking and twisting in his chair.\n\u201cNow, that-\u201d Yoongi stands up \u201cThat was a dumb fucking move, Gao.\u201d\nTaehyung is at Jimin's side, helping him up. Namjoon lets go slightly of the rope and Gao starts breathing again, coughing.\n\u201cI know you like choking people with ropes until they pass out.\u201d Yoongi goes around the desk until he's standing in front of Gao \u201cThat doesn't sound pleasant. Shall we try? Or maybe you feel like signing the contract?\u201d\nGao spits at his feet. \u201cFuck you you goddamn-\u201d.\nHis words are cut short as Namjoon pulls the hems of the rope again.\n\u201cIt's not such a bad deal, I don't see where the problem is.\u201d Yoongi stirs his neck \u201cYou walk out of here with no police biting your ass and everyone's happy. Hell, you even walk out of here with your cock still attached to your body, which is something considering how much Jungkook wants to cut it off. He's a reckless one, you know. Can't seem to control him. Are you fainting on me?\u201d\nNamjoon rolls his eyes and again he looses the rope. \u201cHe's got a shitty stamina.\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d Jimin mutters and Taehyung snorts.\nGao, chest heaving and eyes bloodshot, stares at Yoongi.\n\u201cYou made up your mind, yet? 'Cause I got time, you know? Hell, I could ask Jimin if he wants to take a round, I'm sure he'd love choking you until you pass out. Or beating the shit out of you. Or drugging you.\u201d Yoongi raises his eyebrows \u201cThat's actually not a bad idea. I mean, I got drugs. What's your favorite? Coke? We can make you overdose on that shit.\u201d\n\u201c-ing.\u201d\nYoongi frowns. \u201cI'm sorry, what was that? Speak louder, you pathetic cunt.\u201d\n\u201cI'm-\u201d Gao gulps \u201cI'm signing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat wonderful news.\u201d Seokjin says with a bright smile, already moving towards Gao with a fountain pen in his hand \u201cI truly dislike violence, I'm more of a business man. Here.\u201d He holds the pen to Gao as the man sizes him up, fingers twitching.\nNamjoon quickly tugs at the rope. \u201cYou even think about laying a fucking finger on him, this rope is gonna be the last of your problems.\u201d\nJust like that, Gao takes the pen and Jin's smile only widens.\n\u201cSign here.\u201d he says, pointing at the paper \u201cAnd here. Last one, here. Very well.\u201d Jin takes the contract and smiles at Jungkook \u201cLooks like his cock stays attached to his body, I'm afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d the boy says.\nJin hums, moving again behind the desk and taking from underneath it a suitcase. He walks back to Gao and drops it unceremoniously at his feet.\n\u201cI'm gonna take a wild guess and say that the money in there is far more than the money you gave Jimin.\u201d Yoongi says \u201cThat wasn't too hard, was it?\u201d\nGao glares at Yoongi but doesn't say anything.\n\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d Yoongi waves a hand dismissevely \u201cUnless someone has something to say. Jimin?\u201d\nJimin looks at Gao with his lips curled down in disgust.\n\u201cGot nothing to say to someone who's got a tiny dick and doesn't know how to use it.\u201d\nYoongi smirks.\n\u201cActually, I have something to say.\u201d Hoseok clears his voice \u201cYour accent is fucking shit.\u201d\n\u201cI'll escort him outside.\u201d Jin says \u201cJoons, you're coming with me? Don't really feel like walking the garbage alone.\u201d\nNamjoon grips Gao's neck and drags him up from the chair, pushing him to the door and finally they exit the room.\nA tense silence follows, where no one dares to move, until Hoseok claps his hands together making everyone jump. \u201cWell this was fun.\u201d\n\u201cHilarious, truly.\u201d Taehyung mutters.\n\u201cHow about we get out of here, uh?\u201d Hoseok claps on Yoongi's shoulder as he moves past \u201cLet's give the lovebirds some alone time.\u201d\nTaehyung leaves a sloppy kiss on Jimin's cheek and he holds his hand out to Jungkook, who grabs it and kisses the palm with a smile on his face. \u201cI really wanted to cut his cock off.\u201d\n\u201cNext time, babe.\u201d\nThey leave the penthouse, leaving Jimin and Yoongi alone.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Yoongi asks, taking the contract in his hands and looking at it.\n\u201cYeah, I'm-\u201d Jimin takes a deep breath \u201cGod, you guys are fucking crazy.\u201d\nYoongi hums.\n\u201cSo what happens next? I mean, Gao could still come back, he's not gonna let this slide and-\u201d\n\u201cYou think we didn't take precautions?\u201d Yoongi interrupts him \u201cWe already sent the pictures to the police, there's gonna be a raid at his house soon. Fucker thinks he has his ass covered because he can shut close the mouths of a handful of policemen. I basically own the fucking establishment and he thinks he has the upper hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe contract.\u201d\nYoongi looks at Jimin for a few seconds before he rips the piece of paper in shreds. \u201cWhat contract?\u201d\nJimin frowns. \u201cI don't understand.\u201d\n\u201cI'm not him, I'm not gonna own you. I just had to make Gao's contract useless, and I did. So no more contracts. I gave you the thing you wanted the most. You're free.\u201d Yoongi leans on the desk \u201cWhat do you want to do with your freedom?\u201d\nJimin, still shaken up by the events, stutters for a while before he manages to speak. \u201cI want to dye my hair.\u201d\nYoongi knits his eyebrows. \u201cYou want to do what?\u201d\n\u201cI hate this fucking color. He's the one who chose it for me, I can't fucking stand it.\u201d\nYoongi nods. \u201cOkay, what else?\u201d\n\u201cI want to eat a burger. The fucker didn't let me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cI want to see Daegu.\u201d\nYoongi smiles. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cI want to go to Busan. And to Japan. And I want to show you Detroit in september.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cI- I want to be free with you.\u201d Jimin trains his gaze on Yoongi \u201cIf you want me to.\u201d\n\u201cThought that was obvious.\u201d Yoongi grumbles and Jimin giggles, tension slowly easing away.\n\u201cIs it over?\u201d he asks \u201cLike, for real?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, it's better if we go away for a while. A long while.\u201d Yoongi nods \u201cBut it's over.\u201d\n\u201cI won't have to go back there?\u201d\n\u201cNever again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho knew that destroying an empire was going to be so easy?\u201d\nYoongi hums, taking a sip of his coffee from the the paper cup and he puts the phone to his right ear. \u201cWell, Gao made a poor fucking excuse of an empire since it went done so quickly.\u201d\nOn the other side of the phone, Namjoon laughs at this. \u201cYeah, well, that happens when you're charged with murder, illegal smuggling of weapons and underage prostitution.\u201d\n\u201cTold you he was gonna leave tracks.\u201d\n\u201cYou did.\u201d Yoongi hears the sound of sheets shuffling so he guesses Namjoon is in bed \u201cWhere are you two?\u201d\n\u201cWe arrived in Busan a few hours ago.\u201d Yoongi sighs \u201cIt's so fucking cold, Joons.\u201d\n\u201cJimin's with you?\u201d\n\u201cBuying some sickeningly sweet drink for himself.\u201d he replies \u201cWe're going to see the beach, then all those things tourists see. I'm already tired.\u201d\n\u201cYou're so fake, I know you're actually loving it.\u201d\nYoongi makes a noise at that, but he doesn't deny it. \u201cEverything's okay there, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou left everything in good hands, Yoons. Don't worry about it.\u201d Namjoon chuckles \u201cJin complains a lot because now he has more work to do, but that's what Jin does. Tae and Jungkook are as gross as ever and I feel like Jungkook is turning more and more into a psycopath.\u201d\n\u201cHasn't he always been?\u201d\n\u201cHoseok is having the time of his life, as usual. So, really, don't worry about us and just enjoy your trip. What's after Busan?\u201d\n\u201cDaegu.\u201d\n\u201cHome sweet home.\u201d\n\u201cI guess. Then it's Japan, then I don't even know. I guess I'll just take him wherever he wants. He keeps mentioning Detroit, so I guess there's that.\u201d Yoongi sends a glance at the coffee shop and he sees that Jimin is finishing paying for his drink \u201cI gotta go now, but you keep me updated.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Say hi to Jimin for me.\u201d\n\u201cWill do.\u201d Yoongi ends the call and Jimin comes out of the shop, pulling back his black hair from his face and smiling brightly at Yoongi.\n\u201cWhat's up with you, grumpy?\u201d\n\u201c's cold.\u201d Yoongi mutters, reaching for Jimin's hand and holding it \u201cToo fucking cold.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, you're sour as fuck today.\u201d\n\u201cShush.\u201d\n\u201cYou're lucky I like sour food.\u201d\n\u201cJimin.\u201d\n\u201cLet's go to the beach, yeah?\u201d the boy says as he starts walking down the street, dragging Yoongi with him \u201cI really want to see it again, if it's as pretty as I remember.\u201d\nYoongi holds up his scarf until it covers almost half of his face. \u201cIt's gonna be even colder there.\u201d\nJimin decides to ignore him as he happily walks, looking around and commenting the pretty scenery, the gardens they pass by and almost everything he sets his eyes on.\nYoongi walks behind him, smiling under the scarf, loving the color on Jimin's cheeks and the way his nose reddened from the cold air, black hair framing messily his face.\n\u00a0\n\nWhy black though?\n\n\nBecause that way we match, Yoongi.\n\n\nWhat the actual-\n\n\nIt's cute, Yoongi.\n\n\u00a0\nThey reach the beach after an hour of walking around, there's only a few people strolling down the shore, some kids running excitedely with their feet bare on the damp sand.\n\u201cIt's beautiful.\u201d Jimin says smiling and Yoongi nods.\n\u201cYeah, I remember coming here in summer once with my family. It's still beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWill we meet your family in Daegu?\u201d\nYoongi snorts. \u201cYeah, right. Hey parents, I know I've been missing for almost a decade and you probably thought I was dead but hey, I'm still kicking and guess what? I have a boyfriend, he used to be a prostitute and a porn star and then an high class sugar baby. Then I bought him from a sadistic motherfucker. Oh, and I'm a druglord, it's good to have the whole gang back.\u201d he shakes his head \u201cDon't think it's the kind of reunion they want.\u201d\nJimin hums and props his chin on Yoongi's shoulder, snaking his arms around the man's waist. \u201cOh, shit, you really are cold.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you thought I was faking it?\u201d\nJimin shrugs. \u201cThought that maybe you just wanted an excuse to get back to the hotel.\u201d\nYoongi tilts his head to get a look on Jimin's face. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\nThe boy wiggles his eyebrows and Yoongi rolls his eyes. \u201cYah.\u201d\nJimin giggles. \u201cI like it when you say it. Yah. It's a funny word. You should teach me more korean, hyung.\u201d\n\u201cI regret teaching you even a single word.\u201d\n\u201c's that so, oppa?\u201d\n\u201cI swear to god, Park Jimin.\u201d\nJimin laughs and he leaves a kiss on Yoongi's cheek, holding him a little stronger and nuzzling his hair.\nThey stay quiet, eyes set on the sea before Jimin chuckles again.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Jimin sighs \u201cI'm just getting used to happiness.\u201d\nYoongi hums and he intertwines his fingers with Jimin's. \u201cFeels good, uh?\u201d\n\u201cFeels fucking amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0"
