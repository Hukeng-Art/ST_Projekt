    "text": "They stay that way for a long time, Catra\u2019s face tucked into Adora\u2019s shoulder, Adora gently cradling Catra\u2019s head. Adora is careful not to hug Catra too hard or make her feel restrained, anticipating the moment that Catra will start to pull away \u2014 but Catra doesn\u2019t. She hangs on so tightly it hurts, her claws digging through Adora\u2019s jacket and into her back, latching into her like she did when she was a kitten and didn\u2019t know how much her claws could hurt. Adora tries not to wince, tries not to move a single muscle, worried that if she does the spell will break and Catra will struggle away, appalled at having shown weakness.\n\u00a0\nBut Catra doesn\u2019t let go. And so neither does Adora.\n\u00a0\nAt some point Glimmer and Bow slip away to give them their privacy \u2014 Adora is dimly aware of them moving in and out of the room, having hushed conversations with Entrapta. Finally, Bow comes over and crouches down next to Adora.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe cleared out the boxes in the brig and set up a cot,\u201d he says, as quietly as possible. \u201cDo you want to try moving Catra in there?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora flinches a little bit at him calling it the brig \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want Catra to feel like a prisoner \u2014 but she also knows it\u2019s more or less the same as all the other rooms on the ship, and it\u2019s warm and dark and private. Catra will be comfortable there.\n\u00a0\nIf Catra heard Bow, she doesn\u2019t show it. Adora gives Bow a slight nod, then cautiously shifts to bring some life back into her legs that have long since fallen asleep. \u201cHey, Catra?\u201d she whispers, as gently as possible. Catra doesn\u2019t respond or move. Adora almost wonders if she\u2019s fallen asleep, except that her grip on Adora hasn\u2019t relaxed at all. Adora tries again. \u201cCatra,\u201d she breathes. \u201cBow and Glimmer set up a bed for you. Do you want to go there so you can rest?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a long moment, Catra still doesn\u2019t respond \u2014 then finally, Adora feels her nod into the crook of her neck. \u201cOkay,\u201d whispers Catra, muffled by the fabric of Adora\u2019s jacket. But she still doesn\u2019t move, and her arms still don\u2019t loosen. Adora gives her a moment, then decides to take charge. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry you, okay?\u201d she says, running a hand gently over the back of Catra\u2019s head in an attempt to rouse her. Catra\u2019s only response is another faint nod into her shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d says Bow, but Adora shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve got her.\u201d Carefully, she shifts Catra in her arms, slipping one arm behind Catra\u2019s knees and the other around the small of her back. Catra still doesn\u2019t let go. Her head stays buried in Adora\u2019s shoulder, like it\u2019s the last safe place in the world.\n\u00a0\nAdora lifts Catra as gently as she can, wobbling a bit on her numb legs as she stands. It\u2019s more difficult than she anticipated \u2014 her limbs are weakened by the deep, burning ache that she\u2019s come to understand as a side effect of She-Ra\u2019s healing powers. Her skin is always whole again, her wounds gone without a trace, when she shifts back after even the hardest-won battles \u2014 but she can always still feel a dull ghost of them weighing on her bones. Sometimes, she thinks it would be easier if they would stay.\n\u00a0\nBow hovers nearby, ready to help if needed, but Adora gets her footing and stubbornly grips Catra to her chest as she staggers past him.\n\u00a0\nThe brig is dark, but faintly lit by the soft glow of the First Ones\u2019 tech that studs the wall. It\u2019s the smallest room on the ship, but Adora thinks that\u2019s a good thing \u2014 it feels cozy, safe. She lowers Catra onto the cot, her muscles screaming, waving Bow away once she\u2019s made it. He backs respectfully out of the room and shuts the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Adora murmurs to Catra, and only then does Catra start to hesitantly unfold, extricating herself from Adora\u2019s arms. Adora winces as her claws slide free from her back. Catra looks around the dim room, blinking as if it\u2019s too bright. Her eyes are unfocused, confused. Her movements are sluggish. Adora feels a pang of sympathy \u2014 if her body is sore, Catra must be feeling it ten times more after the beating she took. The memory of Catra\u2019s broken body lying still on the cold floor of Prime\u2019s ship flashes back into her mind, and she swallows the lump in her throat.\n\u00a0\nCatra hasn\u2019t been in her life for a long time, but she hadn\u2019t known how unbearable it would be to lose her for good until that moment.\n\u00a0\nThen Catra\u2019s nails sink into the mattress, and her whole body goes rigid. She looks up at Adora, her pupils shrinking to pinpricks, her fur bristling, and Adora recognizes the first signs of panic.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCatra, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Adora instinctively tries to soothe her, reaching out a comforting hand.\n\u00a0\nCatra\u2019s face crumples and she recoils away from Adora as if she\u2019s seen a ghost. \u201cNo.\u201d It comes out like a sob \u2014 there\u2019s no anger in her voice, just fear and despair. Catra tries to get up off the bed but her legs are too weak to support her, dumping her unkindly to the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCatra!\u201d Adora yelps, reaching again to help her, but Catra scrambles backwards, wedging herself against the wall like a cornered animal, breathing hard. Her tail is bushy. Adora hasn\u2019t seen her like that since they were small children, before Catra learned to hide her vulnerability behind a mask of indifference.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet out of my head,\u201d Catra whimpers. \u201cJust leave me alone. Don\u2019t you have enough already?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt takes Adora a moment to understand.\n\u00a0\nThen she gets it, and her blood turns to ice.\n\u00a0\nCatra curls up into a ball and sobs, her claws tearing at her head as if the pain will wake her up, as if she can rip the ghost of Horde Prime out of her mind. Adora launches forward, grabbing Catra\u2019s wrists and wrestling them away from her head. \u201cCatra, no, this is real. It\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe now, I\u2019m here \u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nCatra thrashes, slashing blindly at her, howling. \u201cJust get it over with,\u201d she wails. \u201cPlease. I told you, she\u2019s not coming back, just let me go. Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora has never heard Catra plead like that. She resolves in that moment that she\u2019s going to kill Horde Prime with her own hands, and she\u2019s going to enjoy it.\n\u00a0\nAdora throws herself bodily on top of Catra, tackling her to floor. She gets her flailing hands pinned, but not before taking a claw to the face. Catra squeezes her eyes shut, turning her face desperately away, her chest still heaving with sobs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCatra.\u201d Adora speaks as firmly as she can. \u201cCatra. Stop. This isn\u2019t a Horde Prime mind trick. I\u2019m really here. And you\u2019re being a major pain in my ass right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra opens her eyes, looking up at Adora\u2019s face in confusion. Adora cracks a weak grin. \u201cI came back for you, dumbass. I saved you. And you can bet I\u2019m never going to let you live it down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra hesitates. Then she shakes her head slowly, eyes unfocused with tears. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t come back for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, tough luck, because I did. So can you please stop with the scratching and just lie down on the stupid bed and rest?\u201d Catra isn\u2019t fighting her anymore, but there\u2019s still distrust in her eyes. Adora tries another tact. \u201cAlso, can I just say that Horde Prime is a major loser? I thought he\u2019d be like, a scarier Hordak, but at least Hordak knew when to shut up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra actually laughs, the same strained chuckle from when she was tottering on the edge of the platform, fighting with everything she had against Prime\u2019s control. Her body has gone limp underneath Adora. Adora carefully lets Catra\u2019s hands go and flops down beside her. \u201cWould fake Adora say that?\u201d she says smugly. She wants to hold Catra and comfort her, but she figures that gentle touches aren\u2019t what Catra needs right now. They would remind her too much of Prime\u2019s possessive gestures.\n\u00a0\nCatra lies still for a long time, the only sound her ragged breathing. Then, finally, she rolls her head to the side, scanning Adora\u2019s face incredulously. \u201cIt\u2019s really you,\u201d she whispers hoarsely. \u201cYou came back for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Adora responds simply.\n\u00a0\nAdora helps her sit up. Catra\u2019s muscles are still tense, but her fur has smoothed \u2014 her eyes scan the room as if searching for any inconsistencies that would give away the illusion. She looks down at her own body. Then her hand goes to the back of her neck \u2014 her ears flatten as she feels the chip still clamped onto her spine. Her claws scrabble at her skin, her clothes, tearing into herself, drawing blood \u2014 it all happens so fast Adora barely has time to react.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCatra, stop! Stop it!\u201d Once again, Adora has to wrestle Catra\u2019s claws away, but she\u2019s already managed to open a few slashes in her own flesh, the red blooming across the snowy white of her uniform. Adora keeps Catra\u2019s wrists in a tight grip as she struggles. \u201cLet go,\u201d hisses Catra, straining against her, but Adora doesn\u2019t relent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d Adora commands. She waits for a long moment until Catra finally does. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go, but you have to promise you won\u2019t hurt yourself again. Catra, promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe figures that will get through to her, and it does. After a moment, Catra retracts her claws and nods. She tugs weakly against Adora\u2019s hands, but Adora doesn\u2019t let go just yet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake it off,\u201d Catra pleads quietly, and Adora understands.\n\u00a0\nShe lets go of Catra\u2019s hands, which curl into fists against the floor, and moves around to Catra\u2019s back. She runs her hands over the white uniform covering Catra\u2019s back, searching for some kind of zipper or closure, but it all seems to be made in one seamless piece of smooth, glossy fabric. Of course Prime wouldn\u2019t make it easy to remove. Catra feels Adora fumbling around, and the hackles on her neck rise as she suddenly shouts. \u201cTake it off! Adora, please, take it off!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora can\u2019t bear the desperation in her voice. Without hesitation, she grips the edges of the uniform and pulls as hard as she can. The fabric is stiff and heavy, but clearly not designed with the protection of the wearer in mind, and it comes apart in Adora\u2019s hands surprisingly easily \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s another burst of She-Ra\u2019s strength. Adora rips the uniform all the way down, exposing Catra\u2019s shivering back, then helps her struggle out of it.\n\u00a0\nFree of the uniform, Catra finally seems to relax. Her muscles go slack as she leans back against Adora\u2019s chest, breathing steadily now. She looks so small, Adora thinks. In her mind, Catra has been so big for so long \u2014 a looming shadow of rage and spite and darkness, its shape so unfamiliar to her.\n\u00a0\nBut this shape \u2014 Catra\u2019s narrow, curled up form \u2014 this shape she knows better than anything.\n\u00a0\nAnd then with a shock, Adora realizes that she\u2019s staring at Catra\u2019s naked body, and that she probably shouldn\u2019t be doing that. She looks away, grabbing the shredded uniform and crushing it up into a ball.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to throw this out the airlock,\u201d she announces, and she feels the slightest rumble of Catra\u2019s chuckle in response. Adora carefully extricates herself from Catra and stands up, still averting her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got some extra clothes, I\u2019ll bring them to you. Do you need water? I\u2019ll bring water too.\u201d With that, Adora rushes out.\n\u00a0\nShe practically sprints through the ship \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want to leave Catra alone for more than a moment. She bursts into the bigger bunkroom where they\u2019ve all been sleeping, and catches Bow and Glimmer cuddling on Bow\u2019s bed. Glimmer\u2019s head snaps straight up from where it had been nestled on Bow\u2019s shoulder, blushing furiously.\n\u00a0\nAdora doesn\u2019t have time to get into whatever that is. She gives them a quick, knowing smirk, then raids her bag of clothes, pulling out a clean gray top and matching shorts. They look just like the standard-issue ones she had once worn in the Horde; she had the Bright Moon tailors make them to her specifications. The familiarity had brought her comfort, and she figures they will for Catra too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d asks Bow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Adora responds. \u201cHey, this ship has an incinerator, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s right outside the cargo hold. What \u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nBut Adora\u2019s already off. As she rushes out of the bunkroom, she feels something soft hit her head, and realizes Glimmer has thrown a blanket at her. \u201cTake this too,\u201d Glimmer shouts after her.\n\u00a0\nAdora finds the incinerator, a small square door in the hallway intended for garbage, and shoves the Horde uniform inside. She closes the door, imagining the white fabric going up in flames, burning away to a crisp, and with it every trace of Prime\u2019s cruel, lingering touch. When she\u2019s satisfied that the garment is definitely destroyed, Adora sprints back to Catra\u2019s room, stopping only briefly in the galley to grab a bottle of water.\n\u00a0\nWhen she steps back into the brig, she finds Catra on the bed, curled up into tight ball. The brig is right next to the engine room and so it\u2019s one of the warmest places on the ship, but Catra is shivering. Her head shoots up at the sound of the door, eyes wide with terror.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s me,\u201d Adora soothes. She crosses to the bed and lays the clothes out next to Catra. Seeing her eye the bottle of water, Adora hands it to her, then waits as Catra drinks greedily. She resists the urge to try and help her as Catra slips on the clothes with clumsy, shaking fingers. The last thing Catra needs right now is for Adora to act possessive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Adora ventures.\n\u00a0\nCatra sighs, laying her head back down on the mattress. \u201cLike shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora nods in sympathy. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. Magic or not, the healing process sucks. You should try to sleep, it\u2019s really the only thing that helps.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have some other magical power that would keep me from dreaming,\u201d grumbles Catra.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s still shivering, but she looks calmer than she has since she woke up. The scratches she left on herself aren\u2019t deep and have stopped bleeding, so they\u2019ll probably be fine without treatment. Adora gently draws the blanket over her and starts to stand up, intending to give Catra some privacy so she can sleep. But Catra\u2019s hand closes on Adora\u2019s wrist before she can pull it back, hanging on tight. Her eyes meet Adora\u2019s. Where before they were dim and unfocused, now they are clear and piercing. She holds Adora\u2019s gaze unrelentingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you come back for me?\u201d she demands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI \u2014\u201c Adora\u2019s voice trails off in the silence. Catra doesn\u2019t let go. The only sound is the soft, muffled humming of the ship\u2019s engines as it moves through space, away from Horde Prime. \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d She trails off again.\n\u00a0\nWhat is she supposed to say?\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause\u2026you\u2019re Catra,\u201d she finishes weakly.\n\u00a0\nCatra flinches. Her hand slips from Adora\u2019s and she rolls away, so small under the blanket that she almost disappears. Adora listens to the ship\u2019s beating heart in the silence, not sure what else to say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should sleep,\u201d says Adora, once it\u2019s become clear that Catra isn\u2019t going to answer.\n\u00a0\nCatra doesn\u2019t respond. Doesn\u2019t even move. \u201cI won\u2019t be far,\u201d Adora adds. \u201cIf you need anything, just call for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStill nothing. Adora\u2019s heart is pounding. She doesn\u2019t want to leave Catra alone. She doesn\u2019t want to let her out of her sight ever again. She wants to lie down on the mattress next to her and pull her against her chest and stroke her hair until she falls asleep, she wants to be there if Catra has a nightmare or tries to hurt herself again, she wants to wrap Catra in her arms and absorb her into her chest where she\u2019ll be safe and never feel pain or fear again.\n\u00a0\nBut she can\u2019t. She\u2019s never been able to do that for Catra, as much as she\u2019s wanted to. And every time she tried, it just made things worse.\n\u00a0\nAdora stands and leaves the room, pressing the panel to close the door behind her. She walks far enough away that Catra will be able to hear her footsteps retreating, then slips her shoes off and tiptoes back as quietly as she can. She lowers herself to the ground and leans against the door, listening as hard as she can for any sound of distress within.\n\u00a0\nIf Catra needs anything, she\u2019ll be there.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s not leaving her again.\n\u00a0\nThe ship rumbles and creaks as it moves through space, away from Horde Prime.\n\u00a0\n*****\n\u00a0\nCatra stays in the room for a long time. She doesn\u2019t sleep, much. When she does, she sees horrible things. She sees the inside of a tank full of green fluid, the sea of glowing clone eyes in the darkness, the cruel twist of Prime\u2019s lips as he rips through her mind. She feels the breathing tube crammed down her throat, Prime\u2019s unyielding grip holding her head steady as the chip is planted, the searing full body pain followed by the terrifying numbness.\n\u00a0\nBut as horrible as it is, the worst thing she sees is Adora\u2019s face, over and over, eyes bright and glowing with hope, all reaching hands and awkward smiles.\n\u00a0\nThere isn\u2019t a window in Catra\u2019s room, but even if there was, there\u2019s no day or night to make sense of the passage of time. There hasn\u2019t been for a while. How long has she been in space? How long was she under Prime\u2019s control? How long since Adora carried her to safety? It\u2019s all melting together, a mix of cold emptiness and feverish dreams. Catra thrashes from side to side in the bed, kicks the blanket onto the floor, grips her head, but she doesn\u2019t cry out. She knows that if she does, Adora will come to help her. And she can\u2019t bear to see Adora\u2019s stupid, hopeful face again.\n\u00a0\nAfter a while (Catra has no idea how long), Adora comes back to check on her. Catra pretends to be asleep. She hears Adora set another water bottle on the ground beside the bed, feels her pull the blanket back over her. She\u2019s angry at that, the familiarity of it all when she should be glaring at Catra through the bars of a prison cell. But she doesn\u2019t stir. She can\u2019t look Adora in the eyes again.\n\u00a0\nAdora keeps coming back to check on her, and Catra feigns sleep every time. She doesn\u2019t touch the water bottle even though her dry throat aches, because then Adora would know that she had been awake. But eventually, she slips into shallow dreams again \u2014 the green fluid, Prime\u2019s smirk, the pain, his voice \u2014 and that\u2019s when Adora happens to check in on her again. At the sound of the door Catra sits bolt upright, her heart pounding out of her chest and a terrified scream bursting from her mouth before she can choke it down. And just like that, her cover\u2019s blown. And Adora\u2019s looking at her with that same stupid, hopeful look, like Catra hasn\u2019t spent years trying to burn her and everything she loved.\n\u00a0\nAnd she can\u2019t stand it.\n\u00a0\nSo Catra does what she always does. She retreats behind her walls, lashes out, needles Adora where she knows it stings the most. It\u2019s what she is. She\u2019s an animal, nothing more than base instincts and rotten heart, just as everyone has always said she was. She\u2019s poison, she\u2019s fire, she\u2019s broken glass, and all she knows how to do is hurt and be hurt in turn.\n\u00a0\nAdora leaves, angry, and something in Catra, some small childish piece that somehow hasn\u2019t been completely stamped out, wants to call after her, wants to run after her into the bright hallway.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t. She stays in the dark.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t know how to leave it.\n\u00a0\n*******\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until Adora is staring down at her coldly and offering her the choice to go, to leave them all behind, to never see her again, that Catra finally realizes that she can\u2019t do it.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s spent years alone, empty, angry. Her rage was the only fire that warmed her, but now she\u2019s just cold. Her bones are aching with it. And she can\u2019t do it for a moment longer.\n\u00a0\nShe reaches for Adora.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n********\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should have seen me,\u201d Bow is saying. \u201cThere were two coming from behind, and one cutting me off in front, and I was like PEW! WHOA! BARREL ROLL! And I totally dodged them, it was dope.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you only hit three asteroids on the way,\u201d smirks Glimmer. \u201cJust, smashed straight through them. It was almost impressive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine, you can drive next time then,\u201d huffs Bow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could have been depressurized and died instantly, but Darla\u2019s shielding held up perfectly!\u201d chirps Entrapta. \u201cOhhh, I\u2019m so proud of her!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora\u2019s face is brimming with excitement as she watches Catra take another bite of the bun. \u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d she urges, her eyes glowing with anticipation for Catra\u2019s reaction.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026good,\u201d mutters Catra. Then, seeing Glimmer shoot her a reproachful look, she adds, \u201cReally good. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora\u2019s face falls a little with disappointment. \u201cJust good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, Sparkles isn\u2019t exactly a five-star chef,\u201d smirks Catra, earning herself an elbow in the ribs from Glimmer. \u201cWhat? I said it was good!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just thought you\u2019d have a bigger reaction than that,\u201d mumbles Adora. \u201cThe first time I tried real food outside of ration bars, it blew my mind. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra raises an eyebrow. \u201cAdora, you know I\u2019ve had food besides ration bars before, right? There was a ton of contraband in the Fright Zone if you knew where to find it. You were the only one square enough to not even try.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBow and Glimmer laugh, and Catra feels a little flicker of warmth. She\u2019s not used to people laughing at her. Not in a good way, anyway. Adora flushes, embarrassed. \u201cAre you kidding?\" she mutters. \"I\u2019ve been waiting for years for you to join the Rebellion so I could see you try real food. And you\u2019ve been eating it the whole time?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJust like that, the flicker of warmth vanishes, and all that\u2019s left is a surge of crushing cold. Bow makes another joke, but his voice sounds muffled and far away. She feels like she\u2019s drowning. Without a word, she stands and leaves the circle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCatra\u2026?\u201d Adora\u2019s voice is the only one that pierces the roaring in her ears, but she doesn\u2019t turn back. She can hear Glimmer murmur something, and she knows she\u2019s telling Adora to give her space.\n\u00a0\nAs soon as she\u2019s out of the room, her legs get weak. She\u2019s almost made it back to her room when they give out altogether, and she stumbles against the wall. It feels like her lungs are being constricted by the heavy pressure on her chest; it feels like all the blood has been drained from her body. She slides down the wall to the floor, gasping for breath, and then her gasps turn to wracking sobs, so deep and heaving that they\u2019re almost soundless.\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting years for you to join the Rebellion\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d said it so casually, like it had really been that simple. Like Catra could have just chosen to walk away from the ceaseless misery of the Fright Zone any time she wanted, chosen to eat good food and be with Adora and be happy. And she could have, couldn\u2019t she? Every sleepless night, every torment inflicted by Shadow Weaver or Hordak, every rage-filled breakdown clawing at the walls and her bed and her own body. It had all been pointless. It was all just wasted time. She could have walked away from her pride and her rage and her need to destroy. Instead she\u2019d let herself be consumed by it until there was nothing good left in her and the world was burning around her.\n\u00a0\nWhat if it's too late?\n\u00a0\nThe pressure in her chest has settled in her stomach; it makes her feel like she\u2019s going to throw up. She\u2019s retching with every breath, but nothing comes up, just more sobs. She lets them come.\n\u00a0\nShe cries until she's empty. Her eyes ache and her body is sore and heavy; she lies there, too exhausted to move. She hears someone coming around the bend in the hall, and she tenses \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want Adora to see her like that. But it\u2019s not Adora.\n\u00a0\nEntrapta\u2019s eyes are fixed on her tracker pad \u2014 she almost steps on Catra before noticing her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she says brightly. \u201cI was just on my way to see how Darla\u2019s reboot is going.\u201d Then she notices Catra\u2019s tear-streaked face and her eyes widen. \u201cOh. Um. Are you\u2026all right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra doesn\u2019t answer right away. Entrapta fidgets, clearly incredibly uncomfortable with the situation. \u201cDo you need medical attention? I\u2019ll just, uh, go get someone\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEntrapta,\u201d says Catra at last, raising her head. \u201cHow\u2019d you do it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEntrapta cocks her head quizzically. \u201cHow\u2019d I do what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d \u2014\u201c Catra swallows, her throat raw. \u201c\u2026how\u2019d you get them to forgive you? How did you forgive yourself?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEntrapta considers the question, playing with the ends of her pigtails. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admits. \u201cAdora and Bow came to rescue me even after I messed with the Runestones. Even after I made robots to hurt them. Even when my portal machine almost destroyed reality.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra flinches and looks away, curling in on herself, shivering. Entrapta sees the reaction and panics \u2014 she does the first thing she can think of and lunges for Catra\u2019s hand, holding it in an awkward grip. Catra\u2019s teary eyes meet hers, shocked. Entrapta looks shocked too, then she decides that she needs to commit and squeezes Catra\u2019s hand a little more firmly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think they came back for me because they believed that I could be better,\u201d she says, clearly choosing each word as carefully as she can. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t leave me, even when I asked them to. So I decided I wanted to be the person they thought I was. At first, I didn\u2019t know how. I kept messing it up. But they didn\u2019t give up on me. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve given up on you, either. I think you just have to\u2026keep trying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a long moment of silence, Entrapta doing her best to hold Catra\u2019s gaze even though it\u2019s clearly killing her. She doesn\u2019t let go until Catra gives her a small, wavering smile, and squeezes her hand slightly in return. Satisfied that her gesture was successful, Entrapta extricates herself and steps back. Catra watches her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come a really long way,\u201d murmurs Catra.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you!\u201d says Entrapta proudly. \u201cI learned the hand thing from Bow, it seems to really comfort people.\u201d She sizes Catra up, then nods decisively. \u201cYou need new clothes. I\u2019ll make you some. A spacesuit, too. Do you want your helmet to have ears? I\u2019m giving it ears.\u201d With that, Entrapta shoots off down the hall, jabbering happily into her voice recorder about \"another successful emotional connection!\"\n\u00a0\nCatra is too tired to stand. But her chest doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. The sick feeling in her stomach has abated. She feels numb, sore, heavy\u2026but also\u2026better, somehow.\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in a long time, she thinks she can see a way forward.\n\u00a0\nHer eyes drift closed and she falls asleep, not fifteen feet from the door to her room. She\u2019s sleeping so heavily that she doesn\u2019t even wake up when Adora finds her some time later and lifts her in her arms, but when she lays her carefully on the bed, she stirs, her eyes cracking open drowsily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Adora,\u201d she mutters.\n\u00a0\nAdora grins that stupid, dopey grin. Idiot. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m okay. Really tired, though. I think I need to sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora nods and starts to pull away, then stops. Catra\u2019s hand is wrapped around hers \u2014 gentle, claws retracted, but firm. She doesn\u2019t say anything, doesn\u2019t even meet Adora\u2019s eyes, but she doesn\u2019t let go, either.\n\u00a0\nAdora takes a risk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Catra?\u201d she whispers at last. \u201cIs\u2026is it okay if I sleep in here tonight? I think Bow and Glimmer are making out in the bunkroom and I don\u2019t want to go back there.\u201d Catra chuckles, a low rumble, almost a purr. Adora smiles. She likes making Catra laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you want,\u201d Catra murmurs. Adora stands up, triumphant.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get another blanket. I can take the floor.\u201d She\u2019s heading for the door when Catra\u2019s voice stops her.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAdora.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\nAdora looks back questioningly. Catra\u2019s looking at her now, her blue and gold eyes bright in the dim room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d Catra says at last. \u201cThe bed is huge.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nWow.\n\n\u00a0\nSlowly, carefully, Adora lowers herself onto the bed beside Catra. She lies stiffly on her side facing Catra, but they don\u2019t touch. She stares at Catra, eyes wide, as if she\u2019ll move too quickly and scare Catra away. After a tense beat, the corner of Catra\u2019s mouth curls up in a small smirk, baring one pointed fang.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake your stupid ponytail out, dummy,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose all your hair before you\u2019re thirty if you keep sleeping with it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora glares at her, but relaxes, yanking out her hair elastic and slipping it around her wrist. Her hair falls around her face, messy and sweaty. She shoots Catra a there, happy now? look.\n\u00a0\nShe looks tired, too. Catra holds her gaze. She blinks slowly, wondering if Adora even remembers what that means.\n\u00a0\nAdora reaches out suddenly, and brushes the short bangs framing Catra\u2019s face. Catra jumps a little at the unexpected touch \u2014 Adora quickly withdraws her hand, self-conscious. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI just\u2026I like it. The hair.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra rolls her eyes, trying to be nonchalant. \u201cI guess that\u2019s one thing I should thank Prime for, at least. Giving me a nice haircut.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Adora sounds horrified at the thought. \u201cI just meant \u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdora. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Catra curls towards Adora, just a little, still not touching her. \u201cIt was just a joke. I\u2019m glad you like it. It feels\u2026lighter.\u201d They\u2019re holding each other\u2019s eyes, unwavering, neither wanting to be the first to look away. Not sure what to say next. Then\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d whispers Catra in the silence. \u201cFor saving me. Thanks for coming back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdora\u2019s eyes widen in shock. She\u2019s so dumb. Every emotion she feels written across her face, easy for anyone to read. Maybe Catra could learn to be a little more like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you,\u201d Adora whispers back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be better,\u201d says Catra, squeezing her eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019ve hurt you a lot. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not going to do it again. But I know sorry doesn\u2019t fix everything. And if you ever want me to go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatra feels the mattress shift as Adora shuffles closer, close enough that Catra can feel her breath on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d she says. \u201cI want you here. With me. I really missed you, Catra.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat's when Catra bridges the gap. It\u2019s not much \u2014 a slight brush of her tail on Adora\u2019s leg. Light enough that it could\u2019ve been accident. But she doesn\u2019t move it. She leaves it there, an unspoken request, until Adora gets the point.\n\u00a0\nAdora slides closer and curls around Catra, draping an arm around her, pulling her close. Catra tucks her head under Adora\u2019s chin, nestling into the warmth of her chest. The embrace is a little awkward, not as easy and careless as it had been when they were children. But it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a start.\n\u00a0\nCatra can\u2019t keep her eyes open anymore. And as she drifts off into the deepest sleep she\u2019s had in years, Adora can feel the soft, creaky buzz of Catra\u2019s purr vibrating against her chest. She can\u2019t believe this is happening. But she\u2019s too tired to question it. She buries her face in Catra\u2019s hair and lets her purring lull her to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe ship moves quietly, peacefully, through space, on its way home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
