    "text": "\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clint had gotten off on the wrong floor on his way to the kitchen and spent the past hour wandering around the lab floor when he walked by an occupied lab. Tony\u2019s occupied lab. \u201cYou know, when I said you could help out more, this isn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d This sentence from Tony caught Clint\u2019s attention. With the door half-open, he could see that Tony was on the phone with someone and he did not look happy with whoever it was.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s Tony talking to?\u201d Natasha asked, startling Clint as she snuck up behind him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo clue.\u201d He shrugged.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 There was a small pause before Tony\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhat I said- I didn\u2019t say you could skip school! I do not need another call from May complaining about you getting detentions because you leave whenever you feel like it!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho\u2019s May?\u201d Clint asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 It was Natasha\u2019s turn to shrug. \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bruce came upon the scene and looked at the spies in confusion. \u201cWhat are you two doing standing outside Tony\u2019s lab?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I know about the detentions! I\u2019m Tony Stark. You think I wouldn\u2019t notice you were skipping school?\u201d Tony snapped. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSkipping school?\u201d Clint looked to the other two. \u201cWhy is Tony talking to a child?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood question,\u201d Steve voiced, causing the rest of the Avengers to turn to look at the new arrival. \u201cWhat\u2019s everyone doing out here? We\u2019re supposed to be having a team meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clint shushed him. \u201cTony\u2019s on the phone.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMore important than your life?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cYou\u2019re my responsibility. How are you supposed to go to a good college when you keep skipping school? When I was your age, I was already going to MIT.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cYes, the MIT thing again! This is your future! You deserve to have a good future.\u201d he snapped. A deep breath followed by a sigh and then, \u201cLook, kid, I gotta go. Just stay in school and don't do anything I would do, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Steve, Clint, and Natasha all looked at each other. \u201cYou don\u2019t think-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI do think.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are we thinking?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGreetings, friends! Why are you all standing in the hallway?\u201d bellowed Thor, walking up behind them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 The others let out exclamations of fright, having been startled by the god. Except for Natasha, who never got startled by anything anymore. \u201cThor!\u201d Clint hissed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI just asked you a similar question, did I not?\u201d Thor questioned.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be discreet. You can\u2019t yell when you\u2019re being discreet!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s this about discretion?\u201d Tony asked, once again startling the group. \u201cGeez, what\u2019s with you guys? You\u2019re\u2026 jumpy, this evening.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d Clint explained hurriedly, \u201cWe were doing absolutely nothing- ow!\u201d He yelped as Natasha elbowed him in the ribs.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Steve jumped in to save them from this quickly derailing conversation. \u201cI came to get everyone for a team meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnother one?\u201d Tony let out a drawn out sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. I have things to do.\u201d He then walked ahead of them toward the elevators.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Once he was out of earshot, Natasha turned to Clint with an expression of annoyance. \u201cAnd you call yourself a spy.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell sorry,\u201d Clint muttered back, \u201cI didn\u2019t see you coming up with a better excuse.\u201d\n\n\n********\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cShow me your blueprints, kid. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Tony said to Peter as he cleared off a workbench by using his arm to sweep all of the items off of the surface and onto the floor.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t really know, Mr. Stark. I didn\u2019t really have a plan yet.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell, I have plenty of options for you in my old files you can look at. See if any speak to you.\u201d He flicked an electronic file off of his tablet and onto the holographic screen in front of them. \u201cPick one and I\u2019ll talk you through it.\u201d It would seem Tony was more excited about this venture than Peter was. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUh,\u201d Peter mumbled awkwardly, \u201cThis is great and all, Mr. Stark, but I think I should probably come up with my own idea instead of just making one of yours.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cNo problem, kid, but you better come up with something fast. It\u2019s due in a week and you haven\u2019t even started.\u201d Tony began pulling out all of his tools, or rather picking them up from where he threw them on the floor moments earlier.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHow do you know when my science fair is? I never even told you.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTony smiled mischievously. \u201cThe same way I know about the detentions.\u201d He leaned in close to Peter\u2019s face. \u201cI know everything.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cActually, Boss only knows because your Aunt May called him asking if he would help you with your science project, Peter.\u201d FRIDAY stated helpfully.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTony glared at the ceiling. \u201cKeep this up, FRIDAY, and you\u2019ll be getting reprogrammed later.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Boss. I thought you programmed me specifically to backtalk.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cMoving on.\u201d Tony turned to Peter. \u201cNow back to your project.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nOnce again, Clint had found himself roaming the halls of the Tower and he stumbled upon this scene. He watched as the two interacted- science terms being used seamlessly as if they were actual English- and was slapped in the face by a realization, or rather a theory. \u201cNo way!\u201d he gasped. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nClint watched them for several more minutes as they started to make plans for some kind of robot. Or, at least it looked like a robot. Clint was not an expert in these sorts of things.\n\n\n~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 One week later, all of the Avengers, minus Tony as he was out on \u201cbusiness\u201d, sat in the main living area flipping through random channels. Or more accurately Clint, Natasha, and Steve were fighting over what to watch. In the case of Clint and Natasha, literally fighting. In the case of Steve, disapproving stares and pleas for them to just decide already. Bruce didn\u2019t care what they would watch as he was busy reading anyway, while Thor was more entertained by the fight happening on the living room floor than anything on TV. All in all, a normal day in the Tower. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive the remote, bird brain!\u201d Natasha growled as she attempted to dislocate his elbow to retrieve the device from him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever!\u201d Clint yelled back dramatically, clutching the remote to his chest and rolling away from her.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 The squabbling continued for a few more moments before Steve interjected. \u201cStop! Is that\u2026 Is that Tony?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bruce looked up from the book in time to see a glimpse of Tony\u2019s face before the channel flipped to a nature documentary. \u201cWait, that was him. Turn it back for a second.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clint and Natasha both immediately froze. Clint was on the floor as Natasha stood over him, twisting his arm uncomfortably behind his back to try and make him drop the remote. Clint, in turn, was reaching over his head with his free arm, trying his best to poke her eyes out. At Steve and Bruce\u2019s requests, they stopped and stayed like that for a minute. Clint clicked the button on the remote, changing it back to the previous channel.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c-Stark was spotted today at Midtown School of Science and Technology attending their science fair,\u201d the reporter informed. It flashed to a clip of Tony walking through the school\u2019s gymnasium past the various projects as he examined them. \u201cNo one knows exactly why Stark was in attendance, but some speculate he was looking for potential recruits for Stark Industries due to the falling number of employees.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know why he was there!\u201d Clint blurted, relaxing but making no move to try and get out of Natasha\u2019s grip.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clint said nothing after that, prompting Natasha to ask, \u201cAre you going to tell us why he was there or make us wait in suspense some more?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clint was still staring intently at the TV as the camera panned over the many projects. \u201cThere!\u201d he said, pausing the TV. \u201cThat kid! I saw him in Tony\u2019s lab last week. Tony was helping him make his project.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy would Tony help some random kid with his science project?\u201d Steve asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s weird even for Tony,\u201d Natasha agreed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember that phone conversation we heard a few weeks ago? Where Tony was talking to a kid about skipping school? I think this is that kid. In the lab he mentioned the same detentions again. It\u2019s gotta be him!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo\u2026 Tony\u2019s been working with some random kid why exactly?\u201d Bruce asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy would he not?\u201d Thor asked, genuinely confused. \u201cHe is spreading his knowledge to this Midgardian child. That is a very noble cause!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThor, an adult man spending too much time with a random child is considered stalking, so it\u2019s not exactly noble so much as it is creepy and concerning,\u201d Steve explained.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what if it\u2019s not a random child?\u201d Clint declared, waving his free arm to emphasize his point.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Natasha looked down at him, puzzled. \u201cExplain.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeemingly random kid comes out of nowhere that Tony is suddenly investing a lot of time and effort into? Does that not ring any bells for any of you?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 They all look at him blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeriously? Random kid who would have born when Tony was in his twenties or thirties, back when he was still a playboy\u2026 Tony suddenly not only spends time with this kid but lectures him about school and college? Getting any hints now?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Their brows furrowed. Steve looked at Clint as he crossed his arms in his somewhat signature thinking pose. \u201cYou\u2019re not saying he\u2019s-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Natasha stated. \u201cI had to do deep research when I went undercover as his assistant. I would know if he had a secret kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot if Tony didn\u2019t know either.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha looked at him and deadpanned, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell, you may not believe me now, but just wait until I gather more evidence. Then you\u2019ll have to believe me.\u201d Clint attempted to cross his arms, which didn\u2019t work very well as his right arm was still pinned to his back.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cAlright, you go do that.\u201d Natasha then dropped her hold on him, causing him to all but flop face-first onto the floor. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, voice muffled by the carpet, \u201cMy hand was starting to fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\n*******\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPeter was late, and currently freaking out about being late. Tony had asked him to come to the Tower after school for a suit upgrade, but Peter had been held up because some guy had thought it was a good idea to steal an old lady\u2019s purse. Peter had, of course, helped, but now he was late for the meeting at Avenger\u2019s Tower. Hence his current running through the halls barely looking where he was going. As it turned out, this was a mistake as he ran face-first into another person.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOh my god, are you okay?\u201d the brick wall of a person asked Peter. When Peter looked up to see who it was, he was stunned to see it was none other than Steve \u201cCaptain America\u201d Rogers himself.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter began to ramble as he often did when faced with strangers, nervousness, or embarrassment. Or in this case all three. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to run into you. Did I hurt you? Of course I didn\u2019t hurt you. What am I talking about, you\u2019re Captain America.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSteve decided now would be a good time to intervene, worried the kid would talk his ear off for the next two hours or pass out from forgetting to breathe. \u201cDeep breaths, kid. It\u2019s alright. I\u2019m fine. Are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter looked vaguely surprised that Captain America was actually still talking to him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m stronger than I look.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHe chuckled. It was then he noticed who the kid actually was. Deciding to play it cool, he asked, \u201cSo what are you doing up here?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOh, uh\u2026 I\u2019m part of the Stark Internship. Mr. Stark told me to meet him in his lab to work on something.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cStark Internship, huh?\u201d What kind of a child calls their father by their last name? Mr. Stark? Obviously this kid doesn\u2019t know who Tony is to him. Or he\u2019s lying. It was probably the latter, considering how nervous the kid looked. \u201cWell you\u2019re on the wrong floor for that. His lab is a few floors down. Ask FRIDAY and she\u2019ll help you get there.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cIt is? Oh. Thanks,\u201d Peter said, running back towards the elevator. At the end of the hallway, he suddenly turned and ran back. \u201cBy the way, could I have an autograph?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSteve gave a short laugh. \u201cSure, kid. Got a pen and something for me to sign?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPeter shrugged off his backpack and began digging through it, careful to not let Steve see the Spider-Man suit. After a minute he pulled out a notebook and a pen.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSteve flipped to a blank page. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cPeter. Peter Parker.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHe then proceeded to write a short but sweet message before signing his name and drawing a quick shield next to it. Closing the notebook, he handed it to the boy. \u201cHere you go, kid.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThank you so much, Mr. Rogers,\u201d Peter grabbed the notebook back and sprinted back towards the elevator, even more late than before. Several pencils and loose papers flew out of the still open backpack behind him. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Steve trailed off as the kid was no longer close enough to hear him.\n\n\n~~~~\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natasha was waiting for the elevator to get to her floor when it stopped on another floor to pick up more people. The doors opened to reveal the doe-eyed teenager that Tony seemed to be taking under his wing. His shock and awe at seeing her standing in the elevator was quite obvious. Peter was so shocked to be meeting not one but two Avengers that he almost forgot to step into the elevator. It was only when the doors started to close and Natasha stuck out an arm to hold them open that he remembered what he was supposed to be doing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhat floor are you going to?\u201d Natasha asked, trying to be polite as well as ascertain whether or not this bumbling child was a threat.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d That was an unexpected answer, even for Natasha. \u201cWhatever floor Mr. Stark\u2019s lab is on.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThat would be floor 31,\u201d FRIDAY said, automatically lighting the proper button.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe two lapsed into silence after that; Natasha because she was trying to read him and Peter because \u2018OH MY GOD IT\u2019S BLACK WIDOW I\u2019M STANDING NEXT TO BLACK WIDOW!\u2019\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPeter desperately wished he was meeting her as Spider-Man instead of himself. That way he could have a conversation about superhero things, maybe even challenge her to an agility competition or something. He had heard that she was amazing at acrobatics but he was curious to see how that measured up to his powers. As it was, he was just some dorky kid standing in an elevator with the Black Widow, staring at her like some sort of creeper. He needed to say something. Anything. \u201cSo\u2026 I like your\u2026 outfit?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha glanced down at her worn out, faded, arguably gross work-out sweats before looking back up at Peter. \u201cThanks,\u201d she stated. They fell back into silence for a few moments before Natasha asked, \u201cYou said you were going to Tony\u2019s lab, right?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Peter trailed off, then realized he should probably elaborate. \u201cI\u2019m a part of the Stark Internship. I\u2019m here so he can teach me about...stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha just stared at him. \u201cI see.\u201d There were definitely physical similarities between Tony and this kid. The brown eyes and brown hair were a start, even if Tony\u2019s was darker than his. They also both used similar hand gestures- flippant and jerky in their crazed genius. The kid was a lot more awkward than Tony had ever been. Then again, growing up in the spotlight made people more confident and outgoing. When everyone was watching every single move you made, you had to make it look like you meant to do that or they\u2019d eat you alive.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMaybe Clint was onto something. Maybe this kid was Tony\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Natasha asked as they reached the 31st floor. She\u2019d have to look into this kid later, see what she could find on him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s Peter,\u201d he said, \u201cSorry, gotta go. Bye.\u201d He ran out of the elevator and disappeared down the hallway.\n\n\n~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBruce had been enjoying the quiet of his lab, working on his latest project when he heard a crash in the room next door. Looking up, he was just in time to see a kid barreling into Tony\u2019s lab. Said kid began looking around the vacant room in confusion. Bruce stepped away from the lab table and approached the glass wall. He tapped on the wall to get the boy\u2019s attention. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked in confused politeness.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe kid almost gave himself whiplash with how fast he spun around. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re Dr. Bruce Banner! There\u2019s a picture of you in my physics class!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBruce was even more confused now. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou did a lot of work on anti-electron collisions! It\u2019s so cool! I\u2019ve read all about you, but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually meeting you!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThanks?\u201d Bruce didn\u2019t think he could get much more confused. He was soon to be proven wrong. \u201cWhat are you doing in Tony\u2019s lab?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m part of the Stark Internship. Mr. Stark asked me to meet him at his lab.\u201d By this point Peter was getting a bit tired of repeating his story. And he wondered if he was even in the right lab. After all, how was Mr. Stark hoping to work on the suit and keep his identity secret when his lab had glass walls into another lab where someone else was working?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTony\u2019s not here,\u201d Bruce told him. \u201cHe went out a while ago and I have no idea when he\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOh.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t know what else to say. Instead he just stood there awkwardly for a minute, trying not to stare at another one of his idols.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBruce also didn\u2019t know what to do. On one hand, he had no clue when Tony would be back and he didn\u2019t want the poor kid sitting there for hours waiting for him. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t know what else to suggest the kid should do.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nLuckily both of them were saved by Tony\u2019s voice out of nowhere declaring \u201cI am Ironman.\u201d Bruce looked around, confused. It wasn\u2019t the first time Tony had used the intercom system to prank someone, but that was the most random thing to say. Tony\u2019s voice continued to repeat the phrase. \u201cI am Ironman. I am Ironman.\u201d Somewhat embarrassed, Peter pulled his phone out and Bruce realized that it was a ringtone. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter answered.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhere are you, kid? You were supposed to be here an hour ago.\u201d Tony asked. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhere am I? I\u2019m in your lab. You\u2019re the one that isn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure I would know if I wasn\u2019t in my own lab.\u201d It was then it dawned on him. \u201cYou\u2019re in the one downstairs, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou have more than one lab?\u201d Peter sounded shocked. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYes?\u201d Tony wasn\u2019t exactly sure why he was surprised at this point. \u201cHave you met me?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell then where are you?\u201d Peter asked, starting to sound dangerously like a kid complaining to a parent.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou\u2019re in my tinkering lab. I\u2019m on the 39th floor in my work lab. Take the elevator up and you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOkay, Mr. Stark. I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d With that Peter ran out of the lab, barely sparing the time to wave at Bruce. \u201cNice to meet you. Bye.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBruce blinked as he watched the kid dash out of the area. He had to admit the kid had a lot of energy. Too much energy. A Tony Stark amount of energy. \u201cHmm,\u201d he mused as he turned and went back to work.\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis time when Peter got into the elevator, it was empty. After only two floors though, it stopped and in walked the God of Thunder himself. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cGreetings, young one,\u201d Thor spoke.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUh, hi.\u201d It was hard not to be intimidated by Thor. He was giant and loud and one of the coolest Avengers. So Peter was awed, yes, but also intimidated. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhere are you headed this fine afternoon?\u201d asked Thor pleasantly.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThe 39th floor. To Mr. Stark\u2019s lab.\u201d Peter answered. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI do not have a specific destination. I merely enjoy riding in this wondrous contraption. It is amazing, is it not?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYeah, elevators are pretty cool.\u201d Peter was as awkward as ever, but something about the Asgardian was likeable and made him feel slightly less out of place.The elevator dinged and it was his floor. Peter waved awkwardly and left. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHave a marvelous day, young one! It was an honor to meet you!\u201d Thor yelled after him as the doors closed.\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha had called everyone into a secret meeting in the communal kitchen. Steve, Thor, and Bruce were all there. No one knew exactly where Clint was, but they didn\u2019t have time to wait for him. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Steve asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cBecause I saw the kid today,\u201d Natasha began. \u201cI met him, figured out his name, and looked into him.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWait, you met him too?\u201d Bruce asked. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou too, Bruce?\u201d Steve said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI, too, met the young one today. He was quite nice,\u201d Thor told them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha gave him a look. \u201cNot the point, Thor. Anyway, I looked into his background to see who his parents were.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cAnd?\u201d Steve prompted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cNothing. I couldn\u2019t get to any of it and the stuff that I could was redacted beyond repair. I think someone\u2019s trying to cover up the identity of his parents.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBruce\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAre you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nNatasha nodded. \u201cI think Clint was right.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nA sudden crash from the vents above was their only warning before Clint could be heard yelling, \u201cI was right?!\u201d He landed in a painful heap on top of the counter before he groaned. \u201cI knew it!\u201d\n\n\n*******\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSeveral months passed. School got out, and over the summer Peter had more time to visit Avengers Tower. Sometimes it was to work on the suit, but more and more often it was just to work on something random with Tony. The other Avengers also saw him more and more often, and they did their best to try and get to know him. None of them mentioned his possible father-son relationship with Tony, however. Mainly because they feared that if Peter didn\u2019t actually know about it, they didn\u2019t want to be the ones to accidentally reveal it to him. At least, no one mentioned it until now.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSteve glanced at the calendar- Tony said that having a wall calendar when you had smartphones and FRIDAY was pointless but Steve liked having a physical thing to write events on- to see that it was nearing Father\u2019s Day. He wondered if Peter was going to get Tony anything. If he did, it would prove that Peter knew and they could stop tip-toeing around the issue. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Steve decided to confide with the others. \u201cDo you think Peter is going to get Tony a gift for Father\u2019s Day?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything about it,\u201d Clint answered.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaybe we should ask?\u201d Steve pondered.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike that won\u2019t sound like it came out of nowhere.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve been making awkward small talk with the kid for the better part of six months and one of us just suddenly asks him a really personal question like that? Yeah, totally normal.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt has not been awkward.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe ask him about the weather, Steve,\u201d Clint pointed out. \u201cThe \n\nweather\n\n. It\u2019s pretty awkward.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell how do you propose we ask him?\u201d Bruce asked, trying to steer the conversation back on track.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWe could just gently start dropping hints,\u201d Steve suggested.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHints? Have you met the kid? He\u2019s thicker than a 2 by 4. He\u2019d never notice,\u201d Natasha quipped, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to ask him we have to do it outright.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cBut who\u2019s going to do it?\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI vote Steve should do it. The kid looks up to him. Anyway, he was the one who wanted to know,\u201d Clint said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one he looks up to. I think he likes Bruce more than me. Bruce should do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cDo you realize how bad I am with people? The kid has a crush on Natasha.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cEvery time the kid gets within ten feet of me, he loses the ability to speak. He feels most comfortable around Clint. So he\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nEveryone turned to Clint. \u201cUh,\u201d he said, \u201cThor could do it?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cClint\u2019s doing it,\u201d Natasha repeated. And that was the end of that.\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nClint walked around the corner into the living room, trying to look casual while rehearsing his lines in his head. Peter was sitting on the couch, studying. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cSo,\u201d Clint started, walking over to lean on the back of the couch. \u201cHow are things going with Tony?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Peter looked equal parts confused and awkward.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou know the 18th is coming up in a few days\u2026\u201d Clint trailed off to wait for a reaction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Now Peter was really confused. He wracked his brain for why that date would be important but found nothing. \u201cUh, yeah. The 18th,\u201d he finally said, hoping Clint would clarify.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cAre you planning on getting Tony anything?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to get Tony something?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell, I guess you don\u2019t \n\nhave\n\n to. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019d appreciate the gesture.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPeter immediately felt bad. What had he forgotten? Had he forgotten his birthday? That had to be it! What else could it be? He had to figure out what to get him. He couldn\u2019t just \n\nnot\n\n get him something. \u201cWhat would- uh- What do you think Mr. Stark would like? Any suggestions?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nClint looked startled by the question. \u201cPfft! Uh, I don\u2019t know. You know him better than I do.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI do?\u201d Peter looked like a deer in the headlights. Was he supposed to know Tony better than he did? Oh god, what had he done wrong?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nClint noticed the look and immediately tried to make the situation better. \u201cI\u2019m sure anything you get him will be fine. With something like this, it only matters that you got him something.\u201d He knows his own kids weren\u2019t exactly creative in the gift department. The last few Father\u2019s Days he\u2019d gotten a mug that said \u2018World\u2019s Greatest Dad\u2019 (homemade no less), a new drill set, and some arrows from the local sporting goods store along with a few handwritten cards with hand-drawn pictures of him fighting various creative foes- including tentacled aliens. \u201cMaybe get him something cheap with a homemade card? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nPeter looked even more befuddled than before. \u201cWait, how old do you think I am?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe archer had had quite enough of this conversation. His people skills had been used up for the day. It was time to excuse himself before he said something stupid(er). \u201cWell, I should go. I have\u2026 errands to run. I\u2019ll see you around, kid.\u201d With that, he got up from the couch and nearly bolted from the room. Once he was out of earshot, he let out a sigh of relief. \u201cNailed it.\u201d\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTony hummed along with the music as he worked on improving the efficiency of the repulsors in his suit. He glanced up as FRIDAY suddenly turned down the music to see Peter standing awkwardly in the entrance to his lab, holding a small package.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHey kid,\u201d he greeted, \u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOh, um. This is for you.\u201d He thrust the package at Tony as if he were embarrassed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like being handed things,\u201d Tony started automatically, but then saw the heartbroken look on the kid\u2019s face and took it anyway. \u201cBut I guess I can make an exception.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 He glanced down at the package in his hand. It was wrapped in plain red wrapping paper and Tony realized it was a present. Not that he wasn\u2019t grateful, but why in the world was the kid giving him a present? Seeing the expectant look on Pete\u2019s face he began to unwrap it. It was a bag of cheap but good coffee and a card. He set the coffee down on his work table to take a better look at the card. The front proudly proclaimed \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in bubble letters. The inside was a surprisingly good picture of Iron Man flying away from the Earth and the message \u201cYou\u2019re out of this world! Happy Birthday, Mr. Stark!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWow. This is\u2026 really something,\u201d Tony said. He wondered if he had forgotten the day again. It couldn\u2019t really be May 29th already? Last time he checked it was June. He had no clue where Peter had gotten the idea that it was his birthday. One look at Peter\u2019s face though and he suddenly really didn\u2019t want to let the kid down. \u201cThis is great, kid. I can always use more coffee. I practically live off of the stuff. Did you draw this yourself?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, no. Actually I had a friend draw it. I\u2019m not very good at drawing.\u201d\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMJ! MJ! MJ!\u201d Peter exclaimed as he ran up to the girl at lunch. She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI need you to do me a favor and not ask any questions!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d she replied.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 He slammed a piece of construction paper onto the table. \u201cI need you to draw a picture of Iron Man flying away from the Earth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 She blinked. Then blinked again. She shrugged and then responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 A few minutes later she was done and she handed the paper back to Peter. \u201cThank you \n\nso\n\n much!\u201d He gushed, getting up and running off again. \u201cI owe you one!\u201d he called back.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell them thanks for me.\u201d Tony was desperate to get out of this situation and figure out what was going on. \u201cAll of this coffee talk is making me thirsty. I think I\u2019ll go make myself some right now. Uh, I\u2019ll see you later, kid. Thanks for the present.\u201d Grabbing the coffee, he got up and left his workshop. On his way out, he whispered to FRIDAY, \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday June 18th, boss,\u201d FRIDAY replied.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony was now completely baffled as he stared at the container of instant coffee in his hands. \u201cWhy in the world would the kid think it\u2019s my birthday?\u201d Shaking his head, he went on his way.\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe others were sitting in the kitchen, enjoying brunch, trying not to seem too eager to hear what had happened between Peter and Tony.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cDo you think he got him a present?\u201d Steve asked. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAny answer was cut off as Tony stormed into the room, looking both confused and annoyed. He was carrying a bag of instant coffee and what looked like a card. Clint let out a silent cheer as he saw the kid had taken his idea. \u201cSweet, coffee,\u201d he said, grabbing the bag out of Tony\u2019s hands and starting to make himself some. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYou okay there, Tony?\u201d Steve asked, noticing the look on his face.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTony just shook his head. \u201cWhy does the kid think it\u2019s my birthday? Who gave him that dumb idea?\u201d All eyes go to Clint, who continued to make the coffee as he whistled a showtune, pretending not to have heard what he said. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna take a walk. I need to figure this out.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAs soon as Tony had left the room, Natasha got up from her chair and walked over to Clint. Upon reaching him, she smacked him across the back of his head, saying, \u201cYou had one job, Clint. What did you do?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHis hand went to the injured spot on his head as he whined, \u201cI did what you told me to! I suggested he get him a present, but also said he didn\u2019t have to. I said nothing about it being his birthday!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell then how did he jump to that conclusion?\u201d Steve asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis question would go unanswered for a few more weeks.\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhy do these mortals decide to keep the small animal if it causes so many problems?\u201d Thor asked, staring in confusion at the movie.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell you keep Loki, don\u2019t you?\u201d Tony asked rhetorically.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThor nodded his head thoughtfully. \u201cTrue. But I love Loki because he is my brother. This creature called a puppy seems to serve no valid purpose.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt was then Tony\u2019s phone rang, the ringtone being the rather obnoxious song \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d. The others turned and looked at him in a mixture of confusion and annoyance. Tony didn\u2019t have enough shame to really care or feel any sort of embarrassment towards the current situation. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve began, \u201cwhy is your phone on? It\u2019s movie night. You know the rule: No cell phones.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI had it turned off for all calls except emergency ones,\u201d Tony stated somewhat defensively.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201c\n\nThat\n\n is the ringtone you assigned to emergency calls?\u201d Natasha asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYes, now if you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d Tony said as he stood, the song starting to repeat again as the phone continued to ring. He walked over and entered the kitchen for an attempt at privacy as he answered the phone. \u201cYello?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHello, Mr. Stark,\u201d an oddly familiar, slightly computerized voice greeted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cJ.E.N.N.Y?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s Karen now.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cKaren? Out of all of the names the kid could\u2019ve picked, he chose Karen?\u201d Tony said mostly to himself. He shook his head. \u201cOkay, not the point right now. Why did you call me?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter is currently unable to do so himself.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony was immediately concerned. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI recommended that Peter call 911, but he refused. I suggested calling you as a suitable alternative, however he is unable to do so. Therefore I am calling you instead.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLots of questions right now, but I\u2019ll stick with asking one. Why would Peter need to call 911 exactly?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBecause he is currently unconscious and bleeding from several stab wounds.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony was immediately running out of the kitchen, intent on going to his workshop to retrieve his suit. \u201cHow bad is it? Send me his location. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can send you his current vital signs. He is alive, but in need of immediate medical attention.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhoa, Tony,\u201d Clint said as he raced out of the room. Without a word, all of the others chased after him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, send them to me,\u201d Tony replied to Karen. He turned to Clint and simply said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh no, you don\u2019t. If this is about Peter, we\u2019re coming too.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI agree, Man of Iron. You are like a brother to me. Anything that concerns my dear nephew concerns me.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony dropped the phone from his ear and stared at Thor in utter confusion. \u201cNephew? What are you talking about? What nephew?!\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeter. Your son. On Asgard we often consider the children of our closest friends to be like nieces and nephews. Is this not the case on Midgard?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony had graduated MIT with honors at the young age of fourteen. Yet the level of confusion he felt in some of his more challenging scientific courses couldn\u2019t compare to what he felt now as he listened to Thor talk. \u201cMy s- What?! Peter isn\u2019t my son!\u201d He then realized this was a complete waste of his time, as Peter was currently bleeding to death behind some dumpster in Queens. \u201cLook, I can\u2019t do this right now. I have to go.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat? He\u2019s not your son?\u201d Clint asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen why is he always at the tower?\u201d Natasha added.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, man. That\u2019s actually really creepy if he\u2019s not your kid.\u201d Clint stated.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony was totally fed up with this conversation. \u201cOkay, this is a conversation we can have when I get back. Right now, I kind of have bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike what?\u201d Clint asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike the fact that Peter is unconscious and currently bleeding to death. Pretty sure that trumps any sort of conversation you want to have right now!\u201d Tony told the others as he suited up.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Steve said, having been silently watching the exchange. \u201cWe can figure this all out later. Everyone, suit up.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, what? No,\u201d Tony immediately replied. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t need nor do I want you to go with. I got this.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you kidding? Even if he\u2019s not your kid- which I still don\u2019t totally believe, by the way- we\u2019ve all grown to like the little twerp. We\u2019re helping.\u201d Clint said, grabbing his bow.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s decided. We\u2019re going,\u201d Steve stated with finality.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Karen\u2019s voice was heard over the arguing. \u201cI thought it would be wise to inform you that Peter\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate have dropped to dangerously low levels over the course of this conversation. I would suggest you hurry.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet us make haste to save our nephew who has fallen in combat!\u201d Thor declared.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI doubt it was much of a fight,\u201d Natasha said, still sounding calm even as she hurried faster. \u201cHe probably just got mugged or something.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan I just say how much I hate all of you in this current moment?\u201d Tony said rhetorically.\n\n\n~~~~~\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter groaned. His head felt fuzzy and everything hurt. It was worse than when he had a building fall on his head, then fell out of that plane, and gotten beat up by a guy in a flying suit. What had happened?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Peter opened his eyes at the familiar voice. At first everything was white. When his eyes adjusted to the light he saw Tony sitting next to the bed, looking far more relieved than his voice revealed. \u201cYou okay, kid?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter attempted to say \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d but what came out was closer to \u201cY\u2019h \u2018m f\u2019n.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to take that as a no.\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou know you almost died, right? Had everyone really worried for a while there.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018v\u2019ryone?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In answer, Tony turned towards the door. Peter looked and saw the rest of the Avengers huddled in the doorway. They looked like they wanted to come in, but were unsure if they could. In their arms were multiple bags of food and drink trays, which made their huddle even more squished. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCan we come in?\u201d Steve asked politely.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter nodded. Or at least as much as he could nod when his whole body felt like jelly.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 The bulky characters entered the small doorway into the marginally bigger room (it was the biggest room the SHIELD facility had). The others sat down in various chairs, or on the small end table if you were Clint, and began to settle in. \u201cGood to see you awake, Spidey,\u201d Clint said as he took a long sip of his milkshake. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter looked alarmed as he turned to Tony. Tony, picking up on what he was thinking, responded with, \u201cThey saw the medics strip you out of the suit, kid. I think they\u2019re smart enough to put the pieces together.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter still looked upset that they knew. \u201cFear not, nephew, your secret is safe with us.\u201d Thor reassured him. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do remember we established that he isn\u2019t actually related to Tony, right?\u201d Natasha asked.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProbably,\u201d Clint added, taking another sip of the milkshake.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cN\u2019phew?\u201d Peter asked quietly, only to be ignored.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d Thor looks genuinely confused at Natasha\u2019s question. \u201cThough I do not see what that has to do with me calling Peter my nephew. He is as much my nephew as Loki is my brother, though we may not be related by blood.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony rolled his eyes and turned to Peter. \u201cMost of them are under the impression you\u2019re my son,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve told them \n\nrepeatedly\n\n that you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can deny it all you want. Doesn\u2019t make it any less true,\u201d Clint stated as he popped a few french fries into his mouth.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t talk with food in your mouth,\u201d Steve scolded, ever the one for manners.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd stop eating my fries!\u201d Natasha snatched them from him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know I eat when I\u2019m stressed!\u201d Clint defended himself.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 As the verbal squabble between the spies quickly turned into a physical fight, Peter turned back towards Tony. \u201cWh\u2019re\u2019s May?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt home, completely unaware of what\u2019s happened to you,\u201d Tony informed. \u201cAs far as she knows, you\u2019re on an out of state field trip for the next two days. That gives us a day before the school contacts her about you being absent and a few more hours before she calls me to get some real answers.\u201d He raised a brow at Peter. \u201cUnless you\u2019d like me to call her now, tell her the truth, and have a car bring her here to yell at you. Because we both know that\u2019s what would happen if I called her right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Peter hurriedly shook his head. \u201cNo th\u2019nks.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bruce stared at Tony. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s the best excuse you could come up with?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was three in the morning before I even remembered to cover for the kid with his aunt. It was the best I could scrap together in an hour at that time of night without breaking several federal and state laws.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tony\u2019s words began to fade for Peter as he started to drift off again. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet some rest kid,\u201d Tony said, uncharacteristically gentle.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTh\u2019nks dad,\u201d Peter mumbled, already too far gone to realize what he\u2019d said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Every head in the room swiveled to stare at Peter. \u201cHa!\u201d cried Clint, only to be immediately shushed by everyone else. \u201cI was right!\u201d he continued quieter. In victory, he stole another fry from Natasha while she was distracted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tony said, trying to appear nonchalant. \u201cHe said \u2018dud\u2019. Not \u2018dad\u2019. That proves nothing. If anything, it proves the doctors have put him on a drug dosage that\u2019s too high for him.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou keep telling yourself that, Tony.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Tony turned back to the unconscious Peter, only looking slightly annoyed as he muttered, \u201cSee what you\u2019ve started?\u201d\n"
