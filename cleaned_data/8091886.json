    "text": "Every child, without fail, is born with a mark, a swirl of color that takes the shape of a perfectly formed blossom nestled directly over their hearts and echoed on their right wrists.\nTwin blooms etched into their skin by some kind of cosmic force.\nHeart-flowers, they\u2019re called, those first blossoms to be etched on a person\u2019s skin, the ones gifted to them at the moment of birth no matter what.\u00a0 More flower-marks can follow in time, depending on a person\u2019s life, but the heart-flower pair is always the first.\nThe thing is, no one knows what causes them.\u00a0 No one knows where they come from or why they show up.\u00a0 No one really remembers how their meanings were divined, just that they were.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t really matter though because even if there weren\u2019t classes and books and studies done on the meanings people would still know.\nSomehow people can always tell what the marks mean, what they stand for even, without being told.\nIt\u2019s a universal language, a shared constant of sorts, and everyone knows that the heart-flower, beyond the other flower-marks a person might gain during their lives, is always the most important.\nThe heart-flower is the one that speaks the loudest, the one that represents just who a person is deep inside.\nSo when Anthony Stark is born with a large clump of yarrow flowers etched into his skin directly over his heart and mirrored on his right wrist, the petals red as blood and the centers little sunbursts of yellow, there\u2019s a deathly kind of quiet in the delivery room.\nNo one, not even the Howard Stark, wants a child with war in his heart.\n~~~\nUnlike most people Tony\u2019s heart-flower isn\u2019t alone for long, his first flower-mark shows up by the time he\u2019s a year old.\nA sprig of tiny, delicate white walnut flowers etch their way onto the skin behind his right ear with a frigid kind of burn.\u00a0 A ball of crimson sycamore blossoms find their way onto the skin behind his left not ten seconds later.\nHis intellect and curiosity etching themselves in turns across his skin for the entire world to see.\n~~~\nNeither Howard with his grandeur filled ash blossom, nor Maria with the magnificent beauty of her calla flower, because they\u2019ve never been Father and Mother, not for him, not for Tony, have much to do with him as he grows.\nThe most they do is shove a thick leather band at him to cover his wrist and make sure he knows just how much trouble he\u2019ll be in if he lets anyone see his heart-flower.\nIt doesn\u2019t take him long to realize that, to know with a deep kind of certainty, that they don\u2019t particularly care for him.\nBy the time he\u2019s four, his first circuit board in hand and a freshly slammed door in his face, Tony knows it for truth.\nThe freshly blossomed yew flower that burns its way onto his rib cage is proof of his sorrow.\n~~~\nHe\u2019s six when Howard shoves a tumbler of scotch into his hand and tells him to drink.\nTells him it\u2019ll put hair on his chest.\nTells him it\u2019ll make a man out of him.\nTony doesn\u2019t want to be a man, he just wants to build, wants to create, wants to be Tony.\nHe drinks it anyway though because he\u2019s also still desperate for Howard\u2019s approval.\u00a0 For Howard\u2019s anything.\nThe vibrant red hand flower that burns its way into existence underneath the sorrow of his yew blossom is a warning all on its own.\n~~~\nHe builds his first engine at seven but it isn\u2019t good enough for Howard.\nNothing ever is.\nThe small white syringa flower he finds later on that night nestled beside the yew and hand flowers is to be expected.\u00a0 Disappointed expectations are their own kind of pain after all.\n~~~\nTony tells Howard he doesn\u2019t want to build weapons one day.\u00a0 He tells him that he wants to make robots, wants to make planes and computers and a million other useful things.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to hurt people.\u00a0 Instead he wants to be a hero, like Captain America and his Commandos.\nHoward\u2019s ring splits his lip and Tony tastes blood seconds later, thick and heavy in his mouth, bitter and biting on his tongue just like the scotch had been.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got war in your heart boy,\u201d Howard sneers, \u201cdon\u2019t ever try and pretend to be anything but what you are.\u201d\nTony feels the familiar burn of a flower mark being etched into his skin but he doesn\u2019t look, doesn\u2019t try and check to see what it is.\u00a0 Instead he keeps his eyes on Howard and his hands cupped around his bleeding mouth and nose.\nHe\u2019s young but he\u2019s smart and Tony knows better than to take his eyes off of a predator.\n~~~\nLater that night is when he finds it.\nA Judas flower has burnt its way onto the skin beneath his right underarm and Tony isn\u2019t even sure why.\nYou have to have faith in someone to be betrayed in the first place.\n~~~\nCitron flowers woven between cardamine and morning glory vines settle across the tops of his shoulders like a cape by the time he\u2019s nine.\u00a0 A garland of sadness woven between paternal error and extinguished hopes for all the world to see.\u00a0 A testament to the fact that he\u2019s a disappointment, that the war in his heart has eaten away at even the love his parents might have had for him otherwise.\nTony stops taking his shirt off unless he\u2019s alone in his room with the door locked and always makes sure his cuff is tight and secure.\nHe\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s out of a need to hide his flower-marks or the bruises.\nNeither are something he wants anyone else to see.\n~~~\nJarvis is his only true solace, him and the fleeting figure of Aunt Peggy who whirls in and out of his life over the years.\nJarvis who\u2019s heart-flower is a cress flower, a sign of stability in Tony\u2019s rough world.\nAunt Peggy carries a clover flower and wears the dignity it foretells like a shield.\u00a0 But she always has a smile and a hug for Tony when she comes around.\u00a0 She always has time for him, has soft, caring hands and warm, safe arms.\nThe twin red chrysanthemums that blossom across his left pectoral at ten are a relief.\n\u2018I love,\u2019 they scream to the world, \u2018I love, I love, I love.\u2019\nAnd he does, God he does.\nHe loves them both.\nAnd it\u2019s a relief because he almost wasn\u2019t sure if love was something he could feel.\nBut he does.\n~~~\nTony grows.\nHe graduates high school and goes off to MIT, too young and too small in so many ways but far older in all the ones that really count.\nClematis flowers burn their way across the back of his neck at fourteen and Tony laughs and laughs and laughs because his mind is a lot of things but beautiful isn\u2019t one of them.\n~~~\nRhodey is though.\nRhodey with his cactus flower that screams of his endurance.\nRhodey who pulls him out of frat houses when he\u2019s had too much to drink.\u00a0 Rhodey who stops dozens of hands from touching him when he\u2019s too out of it to know better.\u00a0 Rhodey who keeps him fed and relatively in one piece.\nRhodey who ruffles his hair and laughs at his jokes and doesn\u2019t ask anything from him except for Tony to eat and sleep and generally try and take care of himself.\nRhodey who asks him once what his heart-flower is because Tony refuses to take his shirt or his cuff off around him.\nRhodey who goes quiet and kind of sad when Tony pushes back his shirt sleeve and rips his cuff off only to throw it onto the ground between them like a gauntlet as he turns his exposed wrist over and shows him.\u00a0 Rhodey who pulls him close, who touches him without hurting him, who never looks at him different even after he finds out that Tony\u2019s heart is filled with war.\nRhodey who takes him under his wing and makes those two red chrysanthemum blossoms become three.\n~~~\nThere are scars on the palms of his hands beneath the flower-marks that\u2019ve unfurled there.\nRed balsam blooms across his right palm and burdock across his left.\nTwo different ways to convey the same message.\nTouch me not.\nTony doesn\u2019t like to be handed things anymore.\nHoward made sure of that.\n~~~\nBy the time Howard and Maria die, by the time Jarvis goes with them, Tony\u2019s a tapestry of blossoms.\nHis entire right side is covered with blooms whose meanings he wishes he could erase.\u00a0 Yew and oleander mixing with helenium and Judas tree flowers until there\u2019s barely any blank skin left from his shoulder to his waist on that side.\nSometimes he wonders if there\u2019ll ever be anything else for him, if he\u2019ll even have room for anything else, filled up half way as he is with sorrow and pain, with betrayal and tears.\nTony can\u2019t help but wonder if there will ever be love for him.\u00a0 If he\u2019ll ever find someone who\u2019ll make the forget-me-nots of true love flow across his skin even as filled as his heart so obviously is with war.\nHe\u2019s almost sure that he wouldn\u2019t deserve it anyways so it doesn\u2019t really matter in the end.\n~~~\nTony builds DUM-E six days after the funeral.\nHe painstakingly etches a volkamenia flower onto DUM-E\u2019s base with hands that shake.\n\u2018May you be happy,\u2019 is what the heart-flower means and it is Tony\u2019s fondest wish for his new and undeniably quirky son.\n~~~\nAt twenty-one the company is his.\nAt twenty-two a narcissus flower blossoms across the arc of his left hip and for the first time in his life Tony seriously considers trying to carve off one of his flower marks.\nHe remembers the narcissus that had swept across the entirety of Howard\u2019s right forearm, a testament to his ego.\nTony doesn\u2019t want to share a blossom with Howard even if the bastard is long dead.\n~~~\nU gets a patient galirum.\nButterfingers a fraxinella for his fiery nature.\nAnd JARVIS, when he comes, gets a ragged robin flower coded into his sequences because he\u2019s filled with wit.\n~~~\nBy the time he\u2019s twenty-five Tony\u2019s biggest secret, besides his heart-flower, is the large cluster of sorrel flowers that takes up the entirety of his left thigh.\nThere are four large blossoms, one for each of his bots and JARVIS.\nThey\u2019re his children and he loves them.\n~~~\nTony has more flower-marks than any one person he\u2019s ever met.\nThey spill out across his skin in swirls of colors and shapes, paint his past and his heart across his skin in a million, revealing ways.\nHe wears long sleeves and pants most of the time because of that and a specially designed body paint when he goes out to party that makes his skin look blank and clean.\nThere are rumors that he doesn\u2019t have a heart-flower because of that.\u00a0 Rumors that he\u2019s soulless on top of everything else.\nThey\u2019re obviously ridiculous though because he wears a cuff and he does have a few flower-marks that he doesn\u2019t bother to hide, mainly the ones on his hands and behind his ears, the cluster of blooms on the back of his neck.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop the whispers though.\nBut then nothing ever really does.\n~~~\nPepper is beautiful with her purple columbine blossom and her matching resolve to win.\nFor a while Tony thinks he could love her, could have forget-me-nots spill out across what\u2019s left of his skin for her.\nBut then he sees the way Happy with his hardy cranberry flower looks at her and he lets the thought go.\nShe\u2019s too good for someone like him anyways.\nToo good for a wreck of a man with war in his heart.\n~~~\nAfghanistan comes and with it all of the horror that Tony knows will haunt him for the rest of his life.\nHe feels the icy burn of new flower-marks being etched across the skin of his back every time they force his head beneath the water.\nYinsen with his dignified clove flower holds a mirror for him later so he can look and see what they are.\nA small ocean of yellow carnations are spread across his skin.\nThey echo the \u2018no\u2019 he\u2019s been screaming in his head ever since all of this started.\n~~~\nHe isn\u2019t surprised in the least when his grief over Yinsen is written out across his skin.\nA single marigold burns into existence, fitting naturally into the tapestry of pain Howard had left him with.\n~~~\nTony builds the suit from the ground up and by the time the Mark III is ready to go he has a burst of joyous yellow roses wrapped around each ankle.\nFlying is like nothing he\u2019s ever experience before in his life and he relishes every second of it.\n~~~\nIn hindsight Tony should have known Obi-Stane was behind it all, should have at least suspected the man with the bilberry heart-flower.\nTreachery was, after all, painted across his skin.\n~~~\nHemlock flows around the reactor but the flowers do little to disguise the palladium that\u2019s worming its way through his system.\nAll they do is announce the death he knows is coming.\n~~~\nEven when he makes the new element, even when the reactor stops poisoning him and Vanko is dead, the hemlock haunts him.\nBecause now he think he knows just what they mean.\nThis, the armor, the fighting, the violence.\nIt\u2019s going to kill him.\nBut Tony?\nTony doesn\u2019t care.\nHe\u2019s still forget-me-not free so he has nothing to lose.\nNot really.\nSo \u2026 it\u2019s worth it.\n~~~\nForget-me-nots spill across Pepper and Happy\u2019s hands and when they entwine their fingers they look like one entity, one continuous ocean of blue.\nA tiny cranesbill blossom etches itself into the hollow of his left wrist but Tony just rubs the burn away and ignores the way his envy\u2019s been splashed across his skin.\n~~~\nLoki comes and Tony\u2019s called to help, called to join the group he\u2019d been deemed unsuitable for.\nHe meets Steve and nothing goes like he wanted it to go, nothing goes like he\u2019d hoped it would in some distant, soft part of his heart and his mind.\nSteve\u2019s words echo in his head because in that moment Tony could swear he hears Howard laughing in the background of his mind.\nHe doesn\u2019t focus on that though.\u00a0 Can\u2019t.\u00a0 There\u2019s too much happening, too much to do.\u00a0 So instead he buckles under and ignores the way the cluster of fish geraniums on his rib gains another bloom.\nHe\u2019s used to it by now though, has had disappointment and broken expectations etched onto his skin for as long as he can remember.\nWhat\u2019s one more in the scheme of things?\n~~~\nHe goes through a worm hole.\nHe falls.\nThe cypress flowers he finds scattered across his collarbone aren\u2019t a surprise.\nHe did die after all, if only for a too short moment.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s strange afterwards, gathering his new team together and pulling them all to stay under one roof with him.\nStrange but good.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for pear flowers to dot their way down his spine, a testament to his affection for this mismatched and raggedly little family he\u2019s somehow found himself a part of.\nThere\u2019s Bruce who swears he lost his heart-flower when he gained the Hulk but Tony knows better.\u00a0 Bruce\u2019s skin might be clean now but the Hulk\u2019s isn\u2019t.\u00a0 The juniper blossom that spreads itself across his great chest is a testament to how he protects Bruce even if Bruce doesn\u2019t see it that way.\nThor\u2019s people don\u2019t have heart-flowers at all, which is strange and vaguely unsettling, but they all move past it when he tells them of auras and how he sees them all crowned in robes of light.\nClint has a smattering of marks, nowhere near as many as Tony does but more than a handful.\u00a0 His heart-flower is a hawkweed blossom and the quick-sightedness it signifies suits him so well it\u2019s almost ridiculous.\nTony had thought Natasha would be the most difficult to deal with but she isn\u2019t.\u00a0 Her red peony stands for devotion and when he sees the way she looks at Clint \u2026 well Tony finds that he isn\u2019t that surprised at all.\nPlus the matching strands of forget-me-nots they both have across their trigger fingers says a lot even if they both insist that love is for children.\nIn the end it\u2019s Steve that gets to him the most, because of course it is.\u00a0 His black poplar flower suits him well, his courage written out across his skin.\u00a0 The swathes of marigolds that cover his biceps suits him far less.\nThe sight of his grief, his loss, makes Tony\u2019s own stomach twist because he would take that pain from Steve if he could, would give him back his life and Bucky and all that he\u2019s lost if it was possible.\nBut he can\u2019t.\nAnd hell, Steve probably wouldn\u2019t accept it from him even if he could.\n~~~\nSix months in and Tony ignores the yellow acacia flower that blossoms across his right knee.\nHe doesn\u2019t have time for a secret love.\n~~~\nA yellow tulip etches itself across the top of his right foot and Tony ignores that one too.\nHe already knew his love was hopeless because he knows that Steve will never love him back.\nSteve\u2019s got courage in his heart and grief on his arms and no interest in Tony beyond their slowly growing almost friendship and their flawless teamwork in the field.\nNo matter how his heart skips a beat when Steve smiles at him, no matter how Tony finds himself taking every opportunity he can find to spend time with him just for the chance that he\u2019ll do it again.\u00a0 None of that matters.\nBecause Tony carries war in his heart and too much sorrow to ever share.\nHe knows better than to get his hopes up.\nForget-me-nots are not for him.\nAnd they never will be.\n~~~\nThen, things change.\n~~~\nSHIELD falls and Steve limps back to the tower with a new friend under one arm and an old one under the other.\nSam Wilson has an osier blossom and the frankness it stands for fits him to the tee.\nBucky Barnes is the even bigger surprise even if Tony has to admit that his bluebell heart-flower is more than a bit ironic given the fact that it stands for constancy.\nStill Tony takes them both in, gives them rooms in the Tower without a second thought.\u00a0 He wanders back down to his workshop after the introductions are done and pulls up a new folder for each of them in his project queue because they\u2019re his now and that means he needs to make sure they\u2019re outfitted.\n~~~\nThe two new guys slot seamlessly into place in the Tower.\nSam gets on with Clint and Natasha like a house on fire and Tony\u2019s never seen Steve as happy as he is when he\u2019s with Bucky.\nIt hurts in an absent sort of way, the way that Steve smiles at Bucky, brighter and happier than anything Tony\u2019s ever been able to draw out of him.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Tony can\u2019t bring himself to hate Bucky either, can\u2019t bring himself to dislike the guy at all.\u00a0 Once he\u2019s shaken the majority of HYDRA\u2019s programing he\u2019s a spitfire, equal parts charming and sarcastic and right up Tony\u2019s alley.\nHe seems to like Tony in turn too which is just as bad because now Bucky spends a good chunk of his free time in Tony\u2019s workshop, playing with the bots or reading on the couch.\u00a0 With him comes Steve, sketchbook in hand and the smile that hasn\u2019t left his mouth in weeks firmly in place.\nThey settle in like they\u2019ve always been there and Tony just watches them out of the corner of his eye with something like disbelief and awe warring inside of him.\nHe\u2019s not sure why they\u2019re there, he just knows it\u2019s going to hurt when they leave.\n~~~\nThree months later and the yellow acacia has another bloom as does the yellow tulip.\nIn this, as in all things, Tony\u2019s apparently set on being outside of the norm.\nWhy else would he fall into a secret and hopeless love twice?\nEspecially with two people who so clearly love each other despite all the things that\u2019ve passed around and between them.\nThere\u2019s no room for Tony there, no room for him between the two of them.\nSteve\u2019s heart is filled with courage and Bucky\u2019s with constancy.\nThere\u2019s no room there for the war that Tony carries with him everywhere.\n~~~\nThor\u2019s back in Asgard and Sam\u2019s out on a date but the rest of them are all settled down in the common floor\u2019s living room when the questions Tony\u2019s been subconsciously dreading the entire time finally get asked.\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ve all been together for a while now and I don\u2019t think any of us have seen your heart-flower Tony.\u201d\u00a0 Clint\u2019s the one to bring it up because he\u2019s never met a sensitive subject he didn\u2019t like to tap dance on even by accident.\u00a0 \u201cI mean we\u2019ve seen some of your flower-marks, but you normally wear that cuff and sleeves and pants all of the time.\u201d\n\u201cWhy Birdbrain if I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d think you were trying to get me to take my clothes off.\u201d\u00a0 Tony tries to deflect because the last thing they need to see is what he carries on his skin.\n\u201cHe\u2019s right you know?\u201d\u00a0 Steve chimes in with a small grin.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve practically seen all of ours by now Tony.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even seen you in short sleeves yet.\u201d\n\u201cShame too,\u201d Bucky quips in his direction, that smirk Tony\u2019s grown to equal parts love and hate tugging at his lips, \u201cI bet you got a real fine set of marks beneath all that silk Stark.\u201d\n\u201cCareful Barnes or you might make me blush.\u201d\u00a0 Tony kicks back in his chair, legs spread wide and deliberately nonchalant.\n\u201cSHIELD never was able to get a full accounting of your marks.\u201d\u00a0 Natasha puts forth.\u00a0 \u201cUsed to drive Fury crazy that he couldn\u2019t find a single person to confirm your heart-flower.\u201d\n\u201cAh the joys of SI\u2019s standard water proof body paint.\u201d\u00a0 Tony raises his glass in her direction.\u00a0 \u201cFoiling spies and paparazzi since its inception.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do have other flower-marks besides the ones we\u2019ve seen don\u2019t you Tony?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s Bruce who asks the question.\n\u201cSure do.\u201d\u00a0 Tony answers him automatically because he\u2019s always had a soft spot for Bruce.\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\u00a0 Steve cuts in.\n\u201cA lot.\u201d\u00a0 Is all Tony says.\n\u201cFive?\u201d Clint asks, brows arching when Tony shakes his head no.\u00a0 \u201cTen?\u00a0 Fifteen?\u00a0 Twenty?\u00a0 Fucking more than twenty?\u201d\n\u201cWay more than that Katniss.\u201d\u00a0 Tony finally admits because everyone is staring at him in surprise and interest and while he\u2019s used to that he\u2019s also not particularly enjoying it at the moment.\u00a0 \u201cAnd no I\u2019m not gonna strip down and show you so don\u2019t even bother asking.\u201d\n\u201cYou suck Tony.\u201d\u00a0 Clint\u2019s practically pouting.\n\u201cNot for you I don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 Tony grins.\nThere\u2019s some grumbling but eventually everyone turns back towards the movie.\u00a0 Everyone but Bucky and Steve.\nTony can feel their eyes on him for the rest of the night.\n~~~\nTwo months later he steps into the kitchen for coffee and stares in something like horror at the sight of forget-me-nots spilling out over both of Steve\u2019s hands as well as Bucky\u2019s real one until there\u2019s not a single spot of clear skin left to be seen.\nTony turns on his heel and goes back down to his workshop, coffee forgotten.\n\u201cLock it down JARVIS,\u201d he rasps.\n\u201cOf course Sir.\u201d\nTony dry heaves over his workshop sink as mourning bride flowers burst into existence across his left ribs.\nThey suit him perfectly because his \u2026 affection for Bucky and Steve both is indeed an unfortunate attachment to which he has lost all.\n~~~\nTony doesn\u2019t come out for days after that.\u00a0 He ignores the way the team comes down one after the other and knocks on his door.\u00a0 He ignores the way Bucky and Steve both show up over and over again, frowns on their faces and food in hand.\nInstead he just works, buries himself in upgrades and SI projects and does his best not to feel, not to think.\u00a0 He wields his blow torch until the sparks sting and JARVIS is practically yelling at him to put it down.\u00a0 Then he just picks up a hammer and beats uselessly at some scrap steel he has laying around.\nAnything to keep him occupied.\nAnything to keep him from remembering.\nAnything to take his mind off of the fact that he\u2019s finally, officially, lost the both of them even if he never really had them to begin with.\nIt doesn\u2019t work.\n~~~\nHe\u2019s covered in grease and oil and God knows what else when he finally drags himself out of the lab and up to his floor and the shower JARVIS already had running for him.\nHe stumbles into his bathroom bleary eyed and exhausted and barely remembers to strip before he steps beneath the spray.\nHe scrubs absently at the oil that soaked through his shirt and onto his arms and chest and hands before he realizes that not all of it is coming off.\nUntil he realizes that what\u2019s been left behind is blue.\n~~~\nStanding naked and clean in front of his mirror Tony stares at his body with a rapidly growing sense of horror mixed with desperation.\nForget-me-nots.\nHe\u2019s covered in them.\nThe left side of his chest and down his ribs, across his back and down both of his arms.\u00a0 The blue flowers spread across every spare inch of skin they can find, twining amongst the other flower-marks that cover him.\u00a0 They come down and cover the backs of both his hands in a way he\u2019ll never be able to hide unless he wears gloves all of the time or breaks his body paint back out again.\nThe only open spaces left are the blank spots on his right hip and the space high on his ribs on the left side of his chest, right below the mourning bride flowers.\nTony bites down on the inside of his cheek until he tastes blood because this \u2026 this is fucking cruel.\nHe finally has forget-me-nots and they\u2019re worthless.\nHe finally has true love\u2019s mark and there\u2019s nothing he can do about them because there\u2019s no room for him between Bucky and Steve.\nTony slides down until he\u2019s sitting on the cold bathroom floor, buries his face in his hands, and cries.\n~~~\nHe pulls himself back together of course.\nBecause, above all else, that\u2019s what he does.\nHe pulls out his paint and makes sure he\u2019s covered half way up to his elbows before he snaps his cuff back in place and then goes to get dressed.\nHe\u2019s Tony Stark after all.\nHe has war in his heart and in his blood and bones and he can\u2019t, won\u2019t, let this break him.\n\u00a0\nTony strides into the kitchen, a fresh suit on and sunglasses firmly in place even if he is still indoors.\u00a0 Thankfully it\u2019s bright enough in the kitchen that it won\u2019t look too odd as long as he doesn\u2019t stay.\nWhich he won\u2019t be.\u00a0 He\u2019s leaving as quickly as possible but he needs all the protection he can get at the moment.\nHe\u2019d learned long ago that, besides his flower-marks, his eyes were his biggest tell and they could give him away at a glance if he wasn\u2019t careful.\n\u2018Soft\u2019, Howard had called them, face twisted in a sneer.\n\u2018Expressive\u2019, Aunt Peggy had always said with a fond smile.\n\u2018Weak\u2019, was what they\u2019d both meant, Tony knew.\u00a0 A chink in any armor he might create.\nAnd Tony\u2019s already so very weak where they\u2019re concerned, already so vulnerable and defenseless when it comes to this team, to Steve and Bucky.\u00a0 To these people who\u2019ve invaded his home and his heart and ripped him apart in a way that Tony hadn\u2019t thought was still possible for him.\nSo.\u00a0 Sunglasses it is.\n\u201cHe lives!\u201d Clint crows from where he\u2019s perched on top of the refrigerator.\u00a0 He\u2019s eating a pancake folded like a taco out of one hand and holding a waffle like a piece of toast in the other because he\u2019s only a functioning adult when he\u2019s fighting and even that\u2019s debatable at times.\nClint insists that it\u2019s part of his trademark charm.\nTony thinks that\u2019s debatable too and on most days Natasha seems to agree.\n\u201cHey Tony,\u201d Steve turns and smiles at him, \u201cwe were starting to worry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah Stark,\u201d Bucky drawls as he leans back in his chair, metal hand curled around his coffee cup and eyes bright as he stares at Tony, \u201canother day down there and me and Stevie were gonna see just how much force those walls of yours can stand.\u201d\nTony bites back a semi-hysterical laugh because if only they knew.\nTony has no walls left where they\u2019re concerned, not really, and that\u2019s his entire problem in the first place.\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d Tony quips even as he takes the cup Bruce puts on the counter in front of him and drains half of it in one burning gulp, \u201cproperty damage doesn\u2019t make anyone like you more Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah right, that\u2019s not what you said when I drop kicked that AIM goon through that storefront last month.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky reminds him with a snort.\u00a0 \u201cI think the words \u2018fucking awesome\u2019 were used at one point.\u00a0 Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here doll.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIn my defense I didn\u2019t know a grown man\u2019s voice could go that high or that loud so I\u2019m gonna have to chalk that up to a scientific discovery and we all know how I feel about science.\u201d\u00a0 Tony says as he puts his now empty mug down and ignores the way Steve frowns at him when he shakes his head at the offered plate of pancakes.\n\u201cYou need to eat something Tony,\u201d Steve\u2019s at his side then, voice low and soft and just a shade off coaxing in that way he gets when he thinks Tony\u2019s a hair away from being spooked.\u00a0 He\u2019s so close that Tony can feel his warmth and it hurts to have him right there and yet so far away in all the ways that matter.\n\u201cNot hungry Cap-Attack,\u201d Tony smiles at him when he says it but he\u2019s careful to keep his eyes up and off of Steve\u2019s hands just as he\u2019s been avoiding looking at Bucky\u2019s flesh hand too.\nHe can\u2019t handle having their forget-me-nots shoved in his face right now.\u00a0 Not so soon.\nHe\u2019ll get over it in time, or he\u2019ll bottle it up better because honestly that\u2019s what he does, but right now he just \u2026 can\u2019t.\n\u201cHey Stark,\u201d Bucky grabs his attention again.\u00a0 Tony turns towards him only to realize that Bucky\u2019s attention is focused firmly on his hands and the now smooth, clear skin he\u2019s sporting thanks to a liberal application of body paint.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up buttercup?\u201d\u00a0 Tony asks and Bucky only looks up again when Tony shoves his hands into his pockets.\u00a0 Even then Tony can see the question in his eyes, the question he refuses to answer or even acknowledge.\n\u201cYou need me and Stevie to get you anything?\u00a0 We\u2019re gonna make a game day run in a few hours.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky quirks a smile at him.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Tony can\u2019t help but wince as he purposefully turns his attention to where Thor and Sam are engaged in what looks like a stare-off over the last of the few waffles on the table.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got to take a rain check boys.\u201d\nThe entire room freezes.\nTony never misses game day and the entire team knows it.\u00a0 Baseball has somehow become his and the Brooklyn Boy\u2019s thing, even if he\u2019s never had a real interest in sports in his life, and now it\u2019s a standing not-date of sorts for them on Fridays.\u00a0 Loaded down with junk food they sit together and slowly work Steve and Bucky up through every World Series game they\u2019ve both missed out on over the years.\nIt\u2019s slow going but fun.\u00a0 Tony relishes every night spent with the three of them packed together on the couch in the common room, Tony in the middle watching amused and delighted as Steve and Bucky hurl abuse at the screen.\u00a0 Sitting there and watching them bitch about calls made decades ago in games long since over is a gift he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d get.\nThey\u2019ve ended battles with extreme prejudice in order to make game day.\u00a0 Bucky once told a crowd of reporters to go fuck themselves to get out of an interview because of game day and Steve hadn\u2019t even blinked.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s missed board meetings and galas for game day.\u00a0 He\u2019s told Pepper no for game days.\nTony hates to even think it but he knows that might have to change now, at least for a little while.\u00a0 At least until he\u2019s gotten a better handle on things.\u00a0 Being there with them, safe and warm between them, is too much for him to handle at the moment.\n\u201cHey doll,\u201d Bucky\u2019s up and out of his chair then and crowding into Tony\u2019s space just like Steve is, face creased lightly in concern, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Tony shakes his head and keeps his expression as even as possible as he backs away from the both of them slowly, \u201cdon\u2019t get your panties in a twist Coldstone, I\u2019ve just got to head out of town for a bit.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got to see a Rhodey about a War Machine is all.\u201d\nThat seems to make the both of them relax a bit even if Steve\u2019s still frowning and Tony can see the rest of the kitchen watching the three of them like they\u2019re a fucking soap opera or something.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait then,\u201d Steve tells him decisively as he and Bucky share a look.\u00a0 \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same watching without you Tony so we\u2019ll just wait until we can do it together.\u201d\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Tony agrees softly before he clears his throat and reaches up to straighten his tie because he needs something to do with his hands before they do something stupid.\u00a0 Like reach out to the two of them.\nOf course Steve\u2019s eyes zero in on his clear hands just like Bucky\u2019s did.\n\u201cJARVIS is in charge while I\u2019m gone so you all be good.\u201d\u00a0 Tony tells the room at large.\u00a0 \u201cAnd J you\u2019ll keep everyone in line won\u2019t you buddy?\u201d\n\u201cAfter years of practice at your side Sir I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be simple enough.\u00a0 You do, as they say, take so much looking after.\u201d\u00a0 JARVIS deadpans and Tony can\u2019t help the genuine grin that breaks across his face because that\u2019s his boy.\n\u201cLies and slander J, lies and slander.\u201d\u00a0 And then, with one finally wave, Tony beats a hasty and strategic retreat to the elevator and the promised safety of his more tangible armor.\nSteve and Bucky watch him go, identical frowns on both of their faces.\n~~~\nHe half lied to them of course.\nRhodey doesn\u2019t need his help. \u00a0War Machine is up to date and fully functional.\nBut Rhodey\u2019s his destination anyways.\nBecause when Tony\u2019s lost, when he\u2019s drifting and wounded and afraid, Rhodey\u2019s where he goes.\nRhodey\u2019s his safe harbor, his best friend, his brother.\nHe\u2019s the one who knows just what Tony carries across his body.\nRhodey\u2019s the one person with whom Tony\u2019s never had to hide the fact that he carries war in his heart.\u00a0 Not since that day so long ago at MIT when Tony had thrown his cuff down on the ground between them like a challenge.\u00a0 Not since the day he\u2019d stood trembling in front of Rhodey, ready to fight, to hurt and be hurt in turn, and Rhodey had reached out to him with gentle hands instead.\nNot since Rhodey saw him for what he was and still is and didn\u2019t judge him for any of it\nSo, with forget-me-nots sprawling across his skin and a heart that feels cut to bleeding, Tony wraps himself in the armor and flies.\n~~~\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey asks as he takes one look at his face and steps to the side to let Tony inside, the door swinging shut behind the two of them.\nTony leaves the armor outside in sentinel mode although he isn\u2019t really worried about the place\u2019s security.\u00a0 JARVIS has a remote uplink to Rhodey\u2019s system and monitors the area constantly.\u00a0 He\u2019ll see any attack before it happens.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s always made sure that Rhodey would be as safe as possible wherever he stays when he isn\u2019t with Tony and this is no exception.\n\u201cCan\u2019t I come see my favorite platypus without something being wrong?\u201d\u00a0 Tony wanders around Rhodey\u2019s living room, hands drifting over the back of his couch as he makes his way over towards the bookcase on the far wall.\n\u201cTheoretically?\u00a0 Yes.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey follows on his heels, chasing Tony just like he always seems to.\u00a0 \u201cBut we both know something\u2019s wrong so don\u2019t bullshit me Tones.\u00a0 Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that your hands are painted either and you haven\u2019t done that in a long time so just spill already.\u201d\nTony\u2019s silent for a long moment as he stares at the picture frames that dot the bookcase, the same collection that travels with Rhodey wherever he goes.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of them too, more than most people would think Rhodey would have.\u00a0 There\u2019s his parents and his academy class, Pepper and Happy and various war buddies, old and new.\nMostly though there are pictures of him and Tony standing side by side, shoulder to shoulder, over the years.\nThere\u2019s Tony at seventeen, a boy already half-destroyed, pressed against Rhodey\u2019s side in front of the fountain at MIT.\u00a0 One of Rhodey\u2019s arms are around his shoulders and even Tony can see the way his body curves oh so protectively around Tony\u2019s own.\u00a0 Can see the way he\u2019d pressed closer to Rhodey in turn, like a flower seeking out the sun.\nBeside it is another picture of the two of them, Rhodey dressed in his dress blues and Tony in a ridiculously expensive suit as they stand together.\u00a0 Their smiles are practiced but their body language is still comfortable, their eyes are still warm.\nIt\u2019s a pattern that repeats in all of the photos.\nComfort.\u00a0 Safety.\u00a0 Love.\nBecause God Tony loves him, loves him wholly and deeply with a red chrysanthemum kind of certainty, because Rhodey has always had his back.\nEven when Tony was lost in the desert, even when the rest of the world had been ready to count him out and write him off, Rhodey had still come for him.\n\u201cI just need a few days,\u201d Tony finally sighs as he turns back towards Rhodey, some of the composure he\u2019d pulled around himself earlier that day finally cracking and falling down around his feet.\u00a0 \u201cJust \u2026 please Rhodey.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Rhodey\u2019s face soften as he moves into Tony\u2019s space to wrap a large, warm hand across the back of his neck, palm covering the clematis flowers that bloom there.\u00a0 \u201cOf course you can stay Tones.\u00a0 Whatever you need.\u00a0 You know that.\u201d\nTony lets out a shuddering breath as his shoulders slump.\nHe leans forward until his forehead is pressed against the solid weight of Rhodey\u2019s shoulder and tries his best to just breathe.\n~~~\nRhodey keeps him company the rest of the day and resolutely doesn\u2019t ask what\u2019s wrong again even though Tony can tell that he wants to.\nInstead they watch shitty movies and drink beer and banter back and forth.\u00a0 The sun\u2019s started to peek back over the horizon by the time they finally fall asleep, Tony sprawled across Rhodey\u2019s chest on the couch just like they used to back at MIT.\nTony sleeps deeply because he\u2019s warm.\u00a0 Comfortable.\u00a0 Safe.\nHe\u2019s always safe with Rhodey.\nHe has a small juniper flower tucked away high on his right thigh that proves it.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s afternoon before they wake up and Rhodey stumbles towards the kitchen to make coffee and lunch.\u00a0 Tony heads for the bathroom for a shower because it\u2019s been over twenty-four hours and his paint is beginning to flake off.\nPlus he won\u2019t hide this from Rhodey, can\u2019t.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t want to.\nHe needs someone else to know.\u00a0 Needs someone else to see the forget-me-nots on his skin.\u00a0 He needs it in order to make this all feel a little more real and a little less like some kind of horrible fever dream.\nSo Tony scrubs himself clean and then wraps himself up in some of Rhodey\u2019s clothes, a sweater and sweatpants that bag on him, before he shuffles into the kitchen.\n\u201cHey Ton-,\u201d Rhodey turns, coffee cup in one hand and spatula in the other, only to freeze when he catches sight of Tony\u2019s now clean hands.\nSilently Rhodey puts down the mug and his spatula, flicks the stove off and then moves around the counter until he\u2019s hovering beside him.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\u00a0 The question\u2019s as soft as the way Rhodey touches him, as gentle as the way he reaches out and takes Tony\u2019s hands in his own, thumbs smoothing over his knuckles and the multitude of blue blooms he finds there.\n\u201cAbout a week ago.\u201d\u00a0 It feels like both longer and less so all at the same time.\u00a0 Like a lifetime ago compressed down into seconds somehow.\n\u201cRogers or Barnes?\u201d\u00a0 Because Rhodey knows him well enough that it\u2019s a question of which one instead of a flat out who.\n\u201cBoth.\u201d\u00a0 Because Tony never could go small, especially not with things that had the power to destroy him.\n\u201cYou never could go small could you?\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey smiles but it\u2019s soft and just a hair off pained.\u00a0 \u201cYou three talked yet?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re together.\u201d\u00a0 It hurts to admit it, to say it, but Tony\u2019s used to pain by now and he has the flower-marks to prove it.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no room for me there Rhodey.\u00a0 They\u2019re better off without me trying to butt in on them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit Tony.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey bites the words out, soft but fierce.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re happy Rhodey,\u201d Tony whispers with a shake of his head, \u201cthey\u2019re so happy together and I don\u2019t want to ruin that.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ruin it Tony,\u201d Rhodey insists as his grip tightens just a bit on Tony\u2019s hands, \u201cyou could be happy with them.\u00a0 The three of you together.\u00a0 These are proof that you would.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 Tony tugs his hands away, takes a step back and rakes them through his hair as he begins to pace.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t \u2026 I can\u2019t do that to them.\u00a0 I\u2019m not \u2026 you know what I am.\u00a0 You know why I can\u2019t.\u00a0 No one wants somebody like me.\u00a0 No one wants somebody with a heart filled with war.\u00a0 Not for real.\u00a0 Not for keeps.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey snarls as he steps forward, hands cutting a sharp line through the air between them.\u00a0 \u201cI do Tony, and so would Pepper and Happy and the rest of the team if they knew.\u00a0 So would Barnes and Rogers.\u00a0 We love you, you stubborn son of a bitch, and one day you\u2019ll get that through your thick skull.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d\u00a0 Tony scrubs his hands across his face roughly.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s \u2026 that\u2019s not the same Rhodey.\u00a0 It\u2019s not.\u00a0 It\u2019s not forget-me-nots love.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not that different Tony.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey denies.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I hate the fact that you\u2019ll never believe me.\u00a0 That no matter how long we\u2019ve been friends, brothers, this is the one thing I\u2019ll never get you to see.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to watch this tear you apart Tony.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t make me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll fix it.\u201d\u00a0 Tony reassures him.\u00a0 \u201cNo one else has to know.\u00a0 No one else will know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work forever Tony.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey protests.\u00a0 \u201cSomehow, someway, someone\u2019ll find out eventually and that\u2019ll change things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep it a secret.\u00a0 Nothing has to change.\u201d\u00a0 Tony vows and he feels the icy burn of a flower-mark being etched into his skin but he ignores it.\u00a0 Tony sounds desperate even to himself because he knows Rhodey\u2019s right and all he\u2019s doing is lying to himself if he thinks otherwise for even a second.\u00a0 It\u2019s that future change that scares him though because when he thinks about it all he can see is loss.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about them Tony.\u00a0 About this whole thing.\u00a0 But I also know I can\u2019t change your mind.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey finally sighs and it sounds fond and exasperated and just a bit sad all at the same time.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing though.\u00a0 I do know what you are, who you are.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always known.\u00a0 It\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t see it Tony.\u00a0 It\u2019s you who doesn\u2019t have a goddamn clue about who or what you really are and I\u2019ll hate Howard Stark until the day I die for doing that to you.\u201d\n~~~\nLater that night Tony goes to the bathroom and tugs the collar of his stolen sweatshirt down.\nThere, nestled in the hollow of his throat between the death filled cypress flowers that dot his collar bones, is a single perfectly shaped deadly nightshade blossom.\nA testament to his silence.\n~~~\nTony stays with Rhodey another night.\nThere\u2019s sixteen missed calls on his phone and thirty text messages split evenly down the middle between Steve and Bucky both.\nTony doesn\u2019t answer any of them.\nHe can\u2019t.\n~~~\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night when Tony\u2019s finally gets ready to leave and fly back to the Tower.\nRhodey stops him at the door.\n\u201cYou remember what I\u2019ve got right here don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey asks him as he takes Tony\u2019s freshly painted hand and presses it against the curve of his right shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cWhat showed up when you were missing?\u201d\nTony nods silently because he still remembers how he\u2019d felt the first time he saw the large zinnia that dominated Rhodey\u2019s shoulder after he\u2019d escaped and Rhodey had found him.\nThoughts of absent friends, proof that Rhodey had searched for him endlessly while he\u2019d been missing.\n\u201cAnd here?\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey moves his hand, presses it against his shirt, high up on his left rib cage.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 Tony swallows hard because he knows that Rhodey has a huge bundle of alstroemeria flowers there, the colors brilliant against his skin.\n\u201cThey\u2019re yours.\u201d\u00a0 Rhodey tells him gently.\u00a0 \u201cShowed up the night after you showed me your heart-flower.\u00a0 They\u2019ve always been yours Tony and they always will be.\u201d\nTony blinks back the tears in his eyes.\nAlstroemeria.\n\nDevotion.\n\nAt least he\u2019ll always have this.\nAt least he\u2019ll always have Rhodey.\nGod knows what he\u2019d do otherwise.\n~~~\nTony arrives to a quiet Tower.\u00a0 It\u2019s late and he\u2019s unsurprised by the fact that everyone\u2019s more than likely asleep.\nHell he\u2019s almost grateful.\nIt\u2019ll give him just a little more time to pull himself together.\nStill he\u2019s sort of unsurprised to see Natasha sitting at the kitchen bar when he wanders in for something to drink before heading down to the workshop.\nShe watches him pour his cup of coffee in silence for a long moment before she finally speaks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re painting again.\u201d\u00a0 She stares at him over the rim of the mug he knows holds her favorite jasmine tea, eyes flicking between his hands and his face.\n\u201cTasha.\u201d\u00a0 Tony says her name softly but the warning, the plea, it holds is clear.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Natasha sighs and it might be the look in her eyes but in that moment Tony knows that she knows.\u00a0 She knows about the forget-me-nots even if she doesn\u2019t know about the rest.\nShe\u2019s always seen far more than any of them, even Clint who can be shortsighted in the simplest of ways at times.\nShe slides off her barstool, sits her cup down on the bar with a quiet clink, and pads her way over to him.\u00a0 She stares at him for a moment before she brings a hand up and carefully, gently, cups his cheek in her palm.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hide Antoshka,\u201d Natasha tells him softly as she smooths the pad of her thumb across the arch of his cheek, \u201cnot from us.\u00a0 Not from them.\u201d\nHer hand lingers on his face for a moment as she steps away from him.\nTony watches her leave in silence.\n~~~\nTony barely sleeps that night, only catches a few restless hours filled with haunting dreams.\n\nIn his dreams he sinks further and further beneath ocean waves tinted forget-me-not blue.\n\n\nAbove him Steve and Bucky dance across the surface of the water, hands entwined and eyes only for each other.\n\n\nTony breathes deep and lets the water take him.\n\n~~~\nTony walks into the kitchen late the next morning just in time to catch Steve and Bucky kissing, their forget-me-not covered hands entwined as Steve leans back against the counter with Bucky pressed against his front.\nTony\u2019s heart clenches because they look so good together.\nThey look like everything he\u2019s ever wanted.\nAnd everything he\u2019ll never have.\nIt hurts.\nSteve sees him first and the way he smiles, bright and warm, feels like a blow to the chest.\u00a0 The way Bucky turns in his arms and does the same hurts just as bad.\n\u201cTony, you\u2019re back.\u201d \u00a0Steve\u2019s the one who calls his name but the both of them move together like they planned it.\n\u201c\u2019Bout time too,\u201d Bucky\u2019s the one who gets to him first though, is the one who slings an arm around his shoulders and pulls Tony close to his side.\u00a0 \u201cThought we were gonna have to send out a search party doll.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Rhodes?\u201d\u00a0 Steve asks as he reaches out and ruffles Tony\u2019s hair.\n\u201cRhodey\u2019s fine, still the apple of my eye, the wind beneath my wings etcetera, etcetera. \u00a0But, enough about him because I\u2019ve got work to do so I\u2019ll see you two later.\u201d\u00a0 Tony reassures them as he ducks out from under Bucky\u2019s arm and away from Steve\u2019s reaching hands.\nHe can\u2019t handle the way they touch him right now, all soft and casual and goddamn torturous because they\u2019re both surprisingly handsy little shits and it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u00a0 He might not ever be able to handle it again.\n\u201cStark?\u201d\u00a0 Bucky\u2019s voice calls after him but Tony doesn\u2019t stop.\nHe can\u2019t.\nIf he does he\u2019s sure he\u2019ll do something he\u2019ll regret.\nLike beg them to love him.\n~~~\nIt goes on like that for a while.\nTony does his best to put some distance between himself and the two of them.\nHe skips game day again the next week, spends every waking moment they\u2019re not on call in the workshop buried in one project or another with the music turned up to screaming.\u00a0 He skips meals and movie nights and when Natasha or Clint or Bucky threaten to physically drag him out he sits beside Bruce or Sam or, on one memorable occasion, Thor instead of between the two of them the way he normally does.\nHe does his best to ignore the way they stare after him, their expressions just a bit confused, just a bit hurt.\nThey\u2019re all courageous black poplar and constancy filled bluebells through and through.\nHe\u2019s war-torn yarrow down through to his soul.\u00a0 He has battles written out across his skin and etched out onto the very heart of him.\nIt\u2019s better this way.\nFor him.\nFor them.\nIt\u2019s just \u2026 better.\n~~~\nBut, just like Rhodey said, no matter how hard he tries Tony can\u2019t keep the secret forever.\n~~~\nTony\u2019s fresh from the workshop shower, because DUM-E had gotten a bit too enthusiastic with the fire extinguisher again, when the call to assemble comes.\nIt\u2019s HYDRA and Tony feels a chill shiver down his spine the way it always does when they come up against them.\u00a0 All he can think about is Bucky and what they\u2019d done to him, what they\u2019d do if they got their hands back on him or on any of the team they could successfully subdue.\nTony can\u2019t, won\u2019t, let that happen.\nHe doesn\u2019t waste time reapplying his paint, or long-sleeves.\u00a0 Instead he just steps into the armor in only his jeans and t-shirt and flies.\nGetting there quickly, making sure his team is safe, is more important than hiding at the moment.\n~~~\nThe battle\u2019s brutal.\nHYDRA unleashes a wave of some kind of new mechanical menace on them that they\u2019ve never faced before.\u00a0 The things are like something out of an old H.G. Wells novel, all long thin legs and optical centers that shoot fucking lasers.\u00a0 Obviously words like subtle and original are not bullet points on their engineering sector\u2019s \u2018Indoctrination and You\u2019 slideshow.\nTony zips around the battle field calling out numbers and formations that are supplemented by Hawkeye and Falcon both as he fires repulsor blasts and smaller caliber armaments.\u00a0 Thor is all booming laughter as he fights side by side with a roaring Hulk.\u00a0 Cap and the Soldier fight back to back as always while Widow darts in and out of cover with a grace to be envied.\n\u2018Beautiful\u2019, Tony can\u2019t help but think as he swoops down to grab Hawkeye right before his position can be compromised.\u00a0 Hawkeye barely even acknowledges him and keeps on shooting even as Tony grabs him by the back of the harness he wears for just this reason and lifts him up.\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Tony thinks again at the blatant show of trust, \u2018beautiful.\u2019\nHis team is a bunch of gorgeous fuckers and the way they move on a battle field nowadays is nothing short of poetry in motion.\u00a0 They\u2019re like one large well-oiled machine, each part working in tandem in a way that makes Tony\u2019s engineering heart sing.\u00a0 Each one of them is necessary to the flow and rhythm of the team now, even him, and that\u2019s something he would have never thought possible.\nThere\u2019s very little that Tony wouldn\u2019t give to keep this, to keep them.\nThat, among other reasons of course, is why when he sees the laser cutting through the ground in Cap and the Soldier\u2019s direction, he doesn\u2019t even hesitate.\nHe just moves.\nTony has to bite back a scream at the pain as the laser clips him in the side and sends him flying.\nHe hears a familiar roar, feels hands pulling at his faceplate, feels the sun on his face and a hand cupping his cheek.\nTony manages to pry his eyes open but when he looks up all he sees is blue.\nThen black closes in around the edges and he doesn\u2019t see anything at all.\n~~~\n\u00a0\u201c-ony.\u00a0 Stay still.\u201d\u00a0 The voice is familiar, comforting, but Tony can\u2019t place it for some reason.\u00a0 His head hurts too bad and the lights and the noise are only making it worse.\u00a0 He wants it to stop.\u00a0 \u201cNo, Tony, don\u2019t move.\u00a0 We\u2019re gonna get you to a doctor.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be okay Tony, just \u2026 just stay still.\u201d\nTony feels panic shoot through him.\u00a0 He can\u2019t go to a doctor.\u00a0 They\u2019ll see.\u00a0 He can\u2019t \u2026 they can\u2019t \u2026 no one can \u2026\nThere are hands on him again, three warm and one cool, they press him back down and hold him there and Tony\u2019s just too tired to fight them, too tired to win.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetheart,\u201d the voice is rough but the hand that runs through his hair is gentle, careful.\u00a0 \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\nTony sleeps again.\n~~~\nTony wakes slowly.\nHis head hurts but it\u2019s not the vicious, sick pounding it was before.\nStill, for a long moment, he\u2019s confused as to why he\u2019s lying in what\u2019s obviously his bedroom without being able to remember how he got there.\nThen, in a rush, it all comes back to him.\nThe battle, the laser, jumping in front of Steve and Bucky.\nThe pain.\nThe voices and the hands, gentle as they held him down, kept him from moving and smoothed back his hair.\nTony blinks once, twice, squeezes his eyes closed hard to try and fight the way sleep clings to him and then forces them back open again.\n\u201cStevie, he\u2019s awake.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky\u2019s voice, low and hoarse, comes out of nowhere.\nTony jolts, hisses out a sharp breath when his ribs flare in pain and turns to look towards his right.\nThere, sitting on the floor beside his bed despite the perfectly good couch pressed against the window on the far side of the room, are Steve and Bucky.\nThey\u2019re both red eyed and tired looking, Bucky\u2019s hair is down from the bun he normally wears it in and Steve\u2019s is falling across his forehead like he hasn\u2019t bothered to brush it back.\nThey\u2019re so beautiful it makes Tony ache.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve sighs his name out and both of their shoulders seem to slump in relief as they push up off of the floor and move until they\u2019re standing together at the side of his bed.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you awake.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a couple of cracked ribs,\u201d Bucky cuts in, blunt as always, \u201cand a busted suit.\u00a0 What in the hell where you thinking you idiot?\u201d\n\u201cBuck.\u201d\u00a0 Steve scolds halfheartedly but Bucky shoots him a dark glower and keeps on going.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m right Stevie.\u00a0 He could\u2019ve got himself killed.\u00a0 We could\u2019ve lo-\u201d\u00a0 Bucky cuts himself off but Tony sees the way Steve nods just so at Bucky\u2019s words, sees the anger and the worry that are plain on both of their faces begin to rise.\n\u201cHad to keep you safe,\u201d Tony rasps out before they can get any more worked up.\u00a0 He\u2019s too tired to be anything but honest at the moment.\u00a0 Too tired to even try and hide from them on this like he normally would.\u00a0 He\u2019s just \u2026 tired.\nThe fight seems to leave the both of them as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cWe know Tony,\u201d Steve sighs as he sits down carefully on the edge of the bed by Tony\u2019s hip.\u00a0 Bucky presses closer to his side until Steve can rest his head against his stomach.\nTony forces himself to look away and when his eyelids begin to droop again he welcomes the feel.\n\u201cGo to sleep doll,\u201d Bucky tells him softly, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Tony hums and does just that.\n~~~\nTony\u2019s clear headed when he wakes up again and horribly/blessedly alone.\u00a0 He grits his teeth against the pain in his ribs when he struggles his way upright until he\u2019s propped against his pillows.\nOf course that\u2019s when the panic hits him hard.\nHe\u2019d been in a t-shirt when he\u2019d suited up, he\u2019d been cuff-less and unpainted, vulnerable and open and they would have all seen \u2026\nTony looks down at his hands and his brain stalls out for a moment because they\u2019re blank below the sleeves of the long sleeved undershirt he\u2019s wearing.\nHis clothes have been changed and his hands have been painted.\nThere\u2019s a small knock on his door just then and it opens slowly when Tony calls out for whoever\u2019s there to come in.\nIt\u2019s Bruce, hair fluffy as always and glasses perpetually askew.\n\u201cHey Tony,\u201d his slight frown eases when he sees Tony sitting up and so obviously alert.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you awake.\u201d\n\u201cGood to be awake again.\u201d\u00a0 Tony hesitates for a second before he raises his hands up to flash his nicely painted skin in Bruce\u2019s direction.\u00a0 \u201cYou got an explanation for this?\u201d\n\u201cWe managed to pack the fight up pretty quick after you went down,\u201d Bruce shrugs as he moves closer to Tony and settles down on the side of the bed.\u00a0 \u201cThe Other Guy wasn\u2019t happy with his favorite person getting hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can I say,\u201d Tony can\u2019t help but tease, \u201che\u2019s got excellent taste.\u201d\n\u201cYeah he does,\u201d there\u2019s something soft and gentle in Bruce\u2019s expression when he agrees.\u00a0 \u201cAnyways, JARVIS was still operational in the suit so he tapped the com, told everyone you were fine according to his scans except for your ribs.\u00a0 It was a close call though Tony, a few inches deeper and that beam would have sliced right into you.\u201d\n\u201cBetter me than them,\u201d it\u2019s all Tony can think to say because to him it really is that simple.\nBruce sighs, reaches up to pinch at the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses, and shakes his head slightly.\n\u201cWe got you back to the Tower and me and Thor got you out of the suit, got your ribs wrapped, clothes changed and hands painted.\u201d\u00a0 Bruce admits.\n\u201cSo are you \u2026 are you the only ones?\u201d\u00a0 Tony clears his throat roughly.\u00a0 \u201cThe only ones who knows?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 Bruce ducks his head in a slight nod.\u00a0 \u201cThe others \u2026 well no one wanted to leave you but we all know how secretive you are about your flower-marks so we figured it would be better that way.\u00a0 Thor can\u2019t read them the way we can and you know I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0 Tony feels a rush of relief that\u2019s mixed with wonder.\nThey\u2019d all had the opportunity to look, to see what they\u2019ve all been so curious about, and they hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 He\u2019d been injured and unconscious and conveniently bare in a way he so rarely was and they hadn\u2019t looked.\nThey hadn\u2019t taken that choice from him.\nOnly Bruce and Thor knew.\u00a0 Tony was positive that Bruce would hold the secret for him and Thor lacked the proper context to truly understand what he\u2019d saw, only that it was private.\u00a0 Tony knew that the god, for all his open and jovial demeanor, knew how to keep a secret as well.\n\u201cI would\u2019ve stayed with you last night just to be sure you didn\u2019t have any problems but well \u2026\u201d Bruce looks slightly sheepish then as his gaze flicks down towards Tony\u2019s covered chest, \u201cI needed some time in the containment room afterwards and Steve and Bucky were happy to volunteer to keep an eye on you.\u00a0 They\u2019d still be here now if Natasha and Sam hadn\u2019t dragged them away.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long beat of silence as Tony absorbs the information that\u2019s just been dumped on him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony says the words slowly, hesitantly, \u201cthat you had to see that.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s \u2026 I know I\u2019m \u2026 I\u2019m not \u2026\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you Tony,\u201d Bruce\u2019s tells him as he pushes back up onto his feet and begins to pace, voice hard and certain in a way that Bruce rarely is in casual conversation.\u00a0 But then this is the furthest thing from casual.\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\u00a0 Tony asks him, taken aback and just the slightest bit angry because he hates being lied to.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s the slightest flush of green on Bruce\u2019s cheeks.\u00a0 \u201cYou took me in when most everyone else would have run screaming in the other direction.\u00a0 You gave me a home Tony, a family.\u00a0 And not just me either.\u00a0 You did that for all of us.\u00a0 Monsters, murderers, soldiers and gods alike.\u00a0 Do you think any of us are going to care what heart-flower you carry?\u00a0 What kind of flower-marks you have?\u00a0 We all know exactly what and who you are and nothing is ever going to change that.\u201d\nAll Tony can do is stare up at him as the burn of a new flower-mark etches its way across his skin.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this together now Tony,\u201d Bruce says once he\u2019s calmed down a bit, \u201cand hopefully one day you\u2019ll trust us all enough to see that.\u00a0 But until then we are, all of us, willing to wait.\u201d\n\u201cBruce \u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 Bruce holds up a hand to head him off.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t need an explanation right now.\u00a0 I\u2019m smart enough to connect a lot of dots Tony and it \u2026 well I\u2019d rather you tell me on your own time.\u201d\nTony swallows hard, nods, and ignores the way his eyes feel just the slightest bit moist.\n\u201cBut Tony?\u201d\u00a0 Bruce waits until he looks up at him again and then he reaches out and presses his fingers to the back of Tony\u2019s hand where they both know forget-me-nots are hiding beneath his paint.\u00a0 \u201cI really do think you should tell them.\u00a0 Both of them.\u00a0 I think it might go better than you\u2019re expecting.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cAre you in need of assistance Sir?\u201d\u00a0 JARVIS asks softly but Tony just waves him away as he slowly, carefully, levers his way up and off of his bed after Bruce leaves.\nHe shuffles his way into his bathroom and towards the giant mirror that dominates the wall.\nThere on the right side of his neck, too high for his shirt collars to completely cover, is a single perfect flowering almond.\nHope.\n~~~\nTony keeps to his bed for the next two days.\nNormally he\u2019d be going out of his mind but he finds himself distracted.\u00a0 There seems to have been a rotating door installed in his bedroom because the team comes and goes constantly while he\u2019s in bed.\u00a0 Beyond that there\u2019s the constant presence of Steve and Bucky who very rarely leave once they come back to distract him.\nStill, long sleeves in place, hands and neck carefully painted, Tony\u2019s mind whirls.\nAnd, despite his best efforts, hope continues to unfurl in his heart.\n~~~\nIt takes two more weeks before Tony finally breaks.\nHis ribs are only mildly sore and he\u2019s finally well enough to shower freely thankfully.\n\u201cSir Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are requesting entry to your room.\u201d\u00a0 JARVIS grabs his attention where he\u2019s standing in front of his mirror.\nTony hesitates for a long moment.\nHe\u2019s naked except for the red silk boxer-briefs he\u2019s wearing that ride low on his hips.\u00a0 All of his clothes are all in his closet but all of his paints are in the bathroom.\u00a0 He could easily tell the two of them to wait, could easily take the time to dress and cover up and keep his secrets for another day.\nTony almost tells JARVIS to have them wait when he looks at himself again in the mirror.\nThe hopeful flowering almond on his neck seems to mock him.\nAnd that\u2019s when he remembers that they hadn\u2019t taken his choice from him when he\u2019d been hurt.\u00a0 They\u2019d made sure his secrets were still his own despite their curiosity.\nThat\u2019s more than most would have done.\nAnd, truthfully, Tony\u2019s tired.\u00a0 He\u2019s tired of hiding, tired of lying, tired of running.\nHe carries war in his heart and pain on his skin and forget-me-nots that he has no right to and he\u2019s just so goddamn tired.\nMaybe this would be best.\nMaybe letting them see would end all of this suffering.\nMaybe they\u2019d leave him alone, would stop inadvertently tormenting him with something he\u2019ll never have no matter what Rhodey or Natasha or Bruce says.\n\u201cLet \u2018em in J.\u201d\u00a0 Tony says even as he wraps his towel loosely around his waist.\n\u201cVery good Sir.\u201d\u00a0 Tony knows he isn\u2019t imagining the hint of approval he hears in JARVIS\u2019 voice.\n~~~\n\u201c-ay something to him Stevie.\u201d\u00a0 Tony can hear Bucky when he gets closer to the bathroom door, voice low and harsh.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve waited too long.\u201d\n\u201cI know Buck,\u201d Steve sounds earnest.\u00a0 \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to rush him is all.\u201d\nTony takes a deep breath and pulls the door open before they can get any further into the argument they\u2019re having.\u00a0 He wants to do this quickly, wants to get it over and done with so he can go somewhere and lick his wounds in private.\nBucky and Steve both turn towards him when he steps out into the room.\nFor a moment both of their faces are a study in surprise at the sight of him shirtless, skin and all it bares uncovered and there for the viewing.\nTony sees it the moment his heart-mark and the flower-marks he\u2019s covered in register with both of them.\n\u201cTony,\u201d there\u2019s a catch in Steve\u2019s voice and his eyes are glued to the swath of yew and oleander mixing with helenium and Judas tree flowers that dominates his right side, his own personal tapestry of sorrow and pain mixed with betrayal and tears.\nA childhood, a lifetime, written across his skin in too honest colors and blooms.\nHis entire history there for the world, for them, to see.\n\u201cDoll,\u201d Bucky\u2019s face is blank and almost cold except for how his pale eyes burn when they rake their way over his skin.\u00a0 Over the citron flowers woven between cardamine and morning glory vines that are settled across his shoulders.\u00a0 Over the cypress blossoms that highlight his collarbones, the deadly nightshade nestled in the hollow of his throat.\nSadness woven between paternal error and extinguished hopes.\u00a0 Death framing his throat with delicate little blooms and his vow of silence forever held between them.\nHe sees the shock and horror etch themselves across their faces in real time.\n\u201cSo.\u201d\u00a0 Tony tilts his chin up, squares his shoulders, and braces himself as best he can.\u00a0 \u201cNow you know.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\u00a0 Steve\u2019s the one who chokes the question out while Bucky stands at his side, hands curling and uncurling into tight fists.\n\u201cHoward didn\u2019t like me much,\u201d Tony tells them with a small shrug because it\u2019s the truth and an understatement all at once but he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t know if there is anything else to say.\u00a0 He just \u2026 doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0 \u201cHe liked to make sure I knew it.\u201d\n\u201cHoward \u2026 he did this to you?\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s something like shock and rage mixed on both of their faces as Bucky grits the question out.\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u00a0 Why the fuck would he?\u00a0 How could he?\u201d\nTony gives him a slightly sardonic smile and raises a hand up to tap a forget-me-not covered finger against his heart-flower.\n\u201cHe had his reasons.\u201d \u00a0Tony presses a palm over his heart-flower, covers the yarrow blossoms with a hand that shakes just a bit.\u00a0 Tries his best to hide his heart of war.\u00a0 \u201cI would have changed it if I could of course, but that\u2019s obviously not possible.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 Steve looks stricken and Bucky doesn\u2019t look much better, face twisted into a scowl.\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cNo one wants someone like me,\u201d Tony tells them the truth that\u2019s haunted him his entire life.\u00a0 \u201cNo one wants a kid with a heart filled with war.\u00a0 It\u2019s something Howard and Maria could never forgive me for.\u00a0 Especially Howard.\u201d\n\u201cFuck that.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky spits and then he\u2019s moving.\u00a0 He strides across the room until he\u2019s right up in Tony\u2019s face, until Tony can feel his warmth like a solid wall against his front.\u00a0 Bucky brings a hand up and grips his hip softly.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit doll because I want you and so does Stevie.\u00a0 We both do and I\u2019m tired of waiting.\u201d\nAnd then Bucky kisses him.\nTony\u2019s frozen for a moment, unable to process what, exactly, is happening.\u00a0 A part of him is crying out that this is wrong, that he needs to back away, needs to stop this from happening because Bucky belongs with Steve and there\u2019s no room for Tony between the two of them.\nBut then Bucky sucks at his bottom lip, scrapes it gently with his teeth, and Tony is gone.\u00a0 His mouth opens beneath Bucky\u2019s with a low moan as Tony leans forward into his warmth.\nIt\u2019s good, so good.\nThe press of Bucky\u2019s tongue, the taste of him, the plush feel of his lips.\u00a0 His heat, the way he groans low in his chest when Tony sucks ever so lightly on his tongue.\nTony loses himself to all of it the way he\u2019s never allowed himself to with another kiss.\u00a0 He kisses back with a desperation he\u2019s never felt, with a hunger he\u2019s never had because if this is his only chance to have this then he\u2019s going to take all he can with him when he goes.\nBucky goes to pull back a long moment later but Tony can\u2019t help but lean forward some more, to press up onto his tiptoes and chase after him.\nBucky husks out a chuckle and kisses him again, languid and deep like he can\u2019t help it any more than Tony can.\nMovement catches Tony\u2019s attention and he breaks the kiss with a sharp breath because it\u2019s Steve.\u00a0 Steve who has come up to them now, who\u2019s hovering by Tony\u2019s side, face flushed and blue eyes wide.\nTony takes in a deep breath, tries to gather his thoughts, tries to apologize, to say or do anything but Steve doesn\u2019t give him a chance.\nInstead Steve steps forward and slots himself against Tony\u2019s back, hands gripping his ribs lightly, carefully, as he pulls Tony closer, until Tony\u2019s pressed snugly between the both of them.\nAnd then Steve leans down and kisses him too.\nWhere Bucky was languid and deep Steve is brazen and bold.\u00a0 He nips where Bucky had sucked, presses deeper into Tony\u2019s mouth with a rough kind of abandon that threatens to sweep Tony away.\nTony presses up onto his tiptoes again, desperate to get closer as he brings a hand up and back to tangle in Steve\u2019s hair.\nBucky isn\u2019t idle either, he presses closer to Tony\u2019s front, hands still on his hips, and leans down to latch his mouth onto the vulnerable curve of Tony\u2019s neck and suck.\nTony breath hitches and he shudders as his knees immediately go weak.\n\u201cBucky\u2019s right.\u201d\u00a0 Steve rasps when he finally breaks the kiss.\u00a0 \u201cWe both want you Tony.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the hardest things Tony\u2019s ever said because he wants this.\u00a0 God he wants it so bad.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u00a0 Bucky pulls back and away from his throat then so he can look down at Tony too, face flushed and eyes blown wide.\u00a0 \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have this, you, each other?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no good.\u201d\u00a0 Tony\u2019s heart feels like it\u2019s going to beat out of his chest.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m no good for either of you.\u00a0 Just look at me.\u00a0 Look at what I\u2019ve been carrying around since I was a kid.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got war in me and you two deserve so much better than that.\u00a0 Better than me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking and you\u2019re beautiful Tony,\u201d Steve presses his lips softly against Tony\u2019s temple, \u201cGod you\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u00a0 You feel so much, so deeply, and it\u2019s all right there on your skin.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\u201cMy heart-flower,\u201d Tony tries to protest.\n\u201cIs perfect Tony,\u201d Steve cuts him off again.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re so strong and that\u2019s proof of it.\u00a0 You\u2019ve fought so long and so hard sweetheart.\u00a0 You\u2019ve fought so many wars on so many different fronts.\u00a0 It\u2019s no wonder why that\u2019s the heart-flower fate chose for you.\u00a0 But you don\u2019t have to do it alone anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got us now,\u201d Bucky agrees, \u201cthe team and me and Stevie in particular.\u00a0 Besides, these right here,\u201d Bucky raises a hand off of Tony\u2019s hip and uses it to trace a path down a line of forget-me-nots that\u2019ve wound their way down Tony\u2019s arm, \u201cthese are one of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever seen doll and I\u2019m willing to go back to war if I have to in order to keep them.\u00a0\u00a0Do you wanna know why?\u201d\nIt takes all Tony has to nod in answer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I think these belong to me and Stevie,\u201d Bucky tells him with a wicked smile, \u201cbecause I know mine and his belong to you just as much as they belong to each other.\u201d\nTony\u2019s entire world freezes.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 The questions little more than a whisper because he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s hearing.\u00a0 He can\u2019t bring himself to because if he\u2019s wrong, if it\u2019s a dream or a hoax, then Tony will break in ways that\u2019ll never be fixed.\n\u201cYou heard me Stark,\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes are intense but there\u2019s a small smile flirting with the corner of his mouth as he glances up and shares a look with Steve over Tony\u2019s head.\nThey both press closer to him until there\u2019s not an inch of space left between them and together they lean down until they can both speak directly into one of his ears.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d \u00a0Steve and Bucky say together, the words presses as soft and gentle as flower petals against his skin.\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Tony practically sobs, \u201cI love you too.\u00a0 I love you too.\u201d\nTony jolts just a bit as the familiar burn of flower-marks begin to etch themselves across his skin.\nHe ignores them though.\nHe\u2019s too busy being kissed again.\n~~~\nLater, a long time later, when the three of them are sweaty and sated, Tony lays on his back in the center of his bed.\nSteve and Bucky are on either side of him and their attention is firmly on his skin.\nBut they aren\u2019t focused on his heart-mark.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t focused on his countless flower-marks and the pain a great deal of them speak of.\nNo, instead Steve\u2019s brushing his fingertips slowly, reverently, across the newly blossomed black poplar flower that\u2019s been etched onto the previously blank spot high on Tony\u2019s ribs.\u00a0 Bucky\u2019s stretched out on his other side and is busy brushing his lips across the bluebell that\u2019s unfurled across Tony\u2019s right hip.\nCourage and constancy amidst the forget-me-nots of true love.\nSteve and Bucky etched out across his skin.\nHis.\nBecause he can have this apparently.\nBecause it\u2019s always been his, just waiting there for the taking.\n~~~\nThe next morning Steve kisses the both of them goodbye when he slips out of bed.\u00a0 An hour or so later Tony and Bucky cling to each other as they stumble into the kitchen where Bruce and Steve are cooking breakfast and the rest of the team, his family, is already huddled around the table.\nTony\u2019s shirtless just like Bucky is, flower-marks on full display, but for once he doesn\u2019t care.\nNo one says a word.\nThey all just smile at him, some of them sadder than others when their eyes trace over what he\u2019s bared.\nBut no one sneers, no one turns from him in disgust or fear or hatred.\nNo.\nInstead they smile, they welcome him with warms eyes and bright laughter and gentle hands.\nTony feels as if he\u2019s just come home again for the first time in years.\n~~~\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d Tony tells Rhodey one night over a video call and even he can hear the awe in his own voice.\n\u201cI normally am Tones,\u201d Rhodey\u2019s smile is soft and loving and everything he\u2019s always been for Tony, \u201cI normally am.\u201d\n~~~\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Tony whispers the words one morning weeks later, \u201cboth of you.\u00a0 So much.\u201d\nThe sun\u2019s streaming in through the windows and its pouring beams of light across his, their, huge bed.\u00a0 Still asleep and sprawled out on either side of him, Steve\u2019s all warm Irish skin and Bucky\u2019s a sweetly tanned light bronze.\u00a0 Each one of them has a hand stretched out in his direction like even in their sleep they want to touch him.\nTony\u2019s never loved anything or anyone like he loves the two of them in this moment.\nHe knows that he\u2019ll never love anything or anyone like he\u2019ll love the two of them in the next either.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0 He says it again, louder this time but just as true even if they are both still asleep.\nThe way matching vines of honeysuckle blossom across Steve\u2019s left rib cage and Bucky\u2019s right shoulder makes him sure that they hear him anyways.\nBonds of love indeed.\n~~~\nThat night Tony throws all of his paints away.\nHe has nothing left to hide.\nHis heart walks on either side of him every day now anyways.\n~~~\nMonths later Tony spends hours bent over Bucky\u2019s arm painstakingly etching delicate forget-me-nots one by one into the metal with steady hands.\nBucky kisses him between every one while Steve sits on the couch in the corner watching them, sketchbook in hand.\nWhenever he looks at the two of them huddled together by Tony\u2019s workbench he smiles.\n~~~\nTony has yarrow in his soul, has a heart filled up with war beating fast and hard in his chest.\nThere\u2019s no denying that.\nHe was born with it and he\u2019s carried it his entire life.\nBut he has other things now too.\nHe\u2019s a tapestry of blooms, an ocean of blossoms.\nAn ever growing garden.\nBecause every time Steve and Bucky kiss him another tiny blossom etches its way onto his skin until some of his flower-marks almost overlap.\nBecause Steve and Bucky carry war on their skin now too, yarrow flowers blooming around both of their heart-flowers like a protective wall.\nBecause every dark and painful memory he has isn\u2019t gone, flower-marks can\u2019t be erased after all and the past can\u2019t be changed, but they\u2019re all touched by something lighter, something brighter and better now.\nNow faithful violets sprinkle their way down each of his toes and mingle almost playfully with the sea of yellow carnations that scream denial across his back.\nNow the pure and ardent love of roses both red and pink twine their ways across his ribs and shoulders, poking through decades of sorrowful yew and mourning filled cypress and sad citron flowers.\nNow tiny myrtle flowers shout their love as they twine delicately between the death filled cypress blossoms that dot his collarbones.\nNow honeysuckles sneak out between the hemlock that encircles the reactor, bonds of love etched out and around what had once been the source of his certain death.\nAnd, above all else, he has the one thing he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d have.\nForget-me-nots, an ocean of blue intertwined throughout everything else.\nMore of them than even he could ever count.\nTrue love etched out across his skin for all the world to see."
