    "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s time for all of you to know more about what you\u2019re facing,\u201d Deaton said. His head was bowed over the disgruntled cat he was examining in what Stiles thought was an excessively serene manner. \nThey were in the animal clinic\u2019s operating room, and Stiles was sitting on the counter behind Deaton. He just barely managed to drag his eyes away from the proceedings he had been watching with sick fascination. \u201cWas that offer always on the table?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it would have been helpful, say, any time in the past year.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with remedial lessons for the alphas,\u201d Deaton said, ignoring him. \n\u201cScott\u2019s not a real alpha,\u201d Derek said, sulking in the shadows along the back wall. \n\u201cBut you\u2019re a real dick,\u201d Scott fired back and Derek bared his teeth at him. \n\u201cChildren,\u201d Deaton said mildly. He turned towards Stiles, keeping a placating hand on the cat. \u201cYou, Mr. Stilinski, will also receive instruction.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not an alpha,\u201d Stiles said. He had been kicking the heel of his foot relentlessly against the cabinet, but paused, surprised into stillness.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d Derek said. Stiles sneered at him. \nScott wheeled around, even more outraged than Stiles himself. \u201cHe's done more for us than you ever have.\u201d\nDerek stepped forward. \u201cMaybe if I wasn\u2019t being betrayed every thirty seconds, we\u2019d be having a different conversation.\u201d\n\u201cOh, get over it,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t get to be the big hero. Take your ego somewhere else.\u201d Derek snarled, and Scott sprang into a crouch in front of Stiles. \nDeaton slammed his fist down on the table. The cat yowled miserably. \u201cIf you are not going to take this seriously, then get out,\u201d he said. \nScott straightened. \u201cI\u2019m not putting up with him, and I don\u2019t need more werewolf crap in my life. I\u2019m out of here. You can do what you want, Stiles.\u201d He slammed his way out, and Stiles winced but stayed put on the counter where he was perched. \n\u201cAnd you, Derek?\u201d Deaton asked, not sounding like he particularly cared one way or another.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d Derek said reluctantly crossing the room to stand under the lights. \n\u201cI want in,\u201d Stiles said, when Deaton turned his gaze on him. \n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Deaton said dryly. \u201cSince it\u2019s just the two of you, I can hold sessions together or separately, but I would prefer to do them together. Do you two think you could possibly maintain a truce while you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know I can, but you\u2019ll have to remind Derek to control his massive aggression issues,\u201d Stiles sniped. \n\u201cYou'll have to remind Stiles that I'm easily provoked,\u201d Derek said, drumming his fingers on the counter. They were glaring directly at each other. Stiles couldn't have looked away if he tried. \nHe took a deep breath. \u201cI can play nice if you can,\u201d he said, a little calmer. \nDerek nodded once, a sharp, jerky motion. \nDeaton clapped. \u201cWell then. We meet tomorrow, nine a.m.\u201d\n*\nNine o\u2019clock was early. That was a thing that Stiles had forgotten since school let out, and he\u2019d become a nocturnal slob. \u201cScott,\u201d he whined sadly, slumping completely over the counter.\n\u201cScott\u2019s not here,\u201d Derek said from behind him, wearing his ever-present leather jacket.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles said, rubbing at the pillow marks still on his cheek.. \u201cI thought maybe if I said it anyways, he\u2019d come bring me coffee.\u201d\nDerek stepped fully into the operating room. \u201cYou could drive down the street and buy some,\u201d he suggested, taking a long sip from a protein shake.\nStiles stared at him balefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to drink those. Your bullshit werewolf muscles don\u2019t have to be maintained.\u201d\n\u201cI like the way they taste,\u201d Derek said, scratching the stubble of his beard.\n\u201cUgh, I hate you,\u201d Stiles said and sunk to the floor.\n\u201cDitto,\u201d Derek said obnoxiously, and they fell into silence. \nDeaton stuck his head in. \u201cCome into the office,\u201d he said, and disappeared again around the corner. They followed him into a small, warmly lit room with bookcases lining every wall. Stiles itched to touch, but he held himself still. Deaton\u2019s desk was in the corner of the room, but the center was occupied by a large, long table. On one side of it was a small, plain candle in a metal dish, and on the other was an old decrepit book that looked to be held together by tape and not much else. \n \u201cGood morning,\u201d Deaton said brightly, and ushered them all the way in, shutting the door behind them. \nStiles edged closer, eying the objects dubiously. \u201cI thought this was going to be lectures and note-taking and stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cLike real school.\u201d\n\u201cNow where\u2019d the fun be in that?\u201d Deaton said, crossing to stand in front of the table. \u201cStiles, since you just volunteered, we\u2019ll start with you.\u201d \nStiles made an outraged noise, but settled into a chair at one end, too curious to really protest. \nDeaton pushed the candle towards him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on your abilities, and getting you centered enough so you can call on them at will. Be more than the spark now, be the flame. Get the wick to light.\u201d \nStiles\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re serious? I\u2019ve only ever done anything with the mountain ash, and that was already magical!\u201d\n\u201cMountain ash is just dead tree,\u201d Deaton said peaceably. \u201cYou have to find your magic.\u201d Dismissing Stiles, he turned to Derek. \u201cAs for you, we\u2019re going to work on your knowledge gaps today, I think. We\u2019ll start with this chapter.\u201d He opened the book to a marked page, and pushed it towards him. Derek\u2019s mouth turned down, but he accepted the book without comment, and both he and Stiles settled in. \nIt was quiet for at least an hour before Stiles hit his breaking point. \u201cThis is impossible,\u201d he said, frustrated and developing a headache. \n\u201cYou have to believe it\u2019ll work,\u201d Deaton repeated, for what Stiles was estimating to be the fifteenth time. \n\u201cI\u2019d rather pretend to read books like Derek,\u201d Stiles said, resting his chin on his folded hands and staring unblinkingly at the stupid candle. \nDerek sat up so fast his chair made a protesting noise. \u201cI\u2019m not pretending,\u201d he said unconvincingly. Stiles shot him an insulting look, and Derek bristled. \u201cYou try reading a chapter about goblins written four hundred years ago.\u201d\n\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d Stiles assured him. \u201cYou can make angry eyebrow face at this candle, we\u2019ll all be happy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you,\u201d Deaton said, looking up from the paperwork he\u2019d been going through. \u201cI\u2019m not forcing either of you to be here, nor am I getting anything out of this.\u201d He hummed thoughtfully. \u201cBut it might be a good idea to change things up. Derek, give your book to Stiles.\u201d He disappeared for a moment and then returned with a chessboard and a small case filled with pieces. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to play chess,\u201d Derek said, his voice sounding mildly panicked. \n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Stiles said but when he got twin looks from Deaton and Derek, he subsisted and opened the marked chapter. It was more interesting than Derek had seemed to think, and Stiles got lost in a description of a goblin that had terrorized a small Brazilian village and what the villagers had done to rid themselves of it. \nWhen he surfaced, it was probably an hour later, and he and Derek were alone in the room. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s Deaton?\u201d Stiles said, blinking. \n\u201cHe went to check on the animals,\u201d Derek said, staring at the board. \nStiles stood, stretching. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d he said, nodding at the board. \n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to make a move until I\u2019ve thought about it for five minutes,\u201d Derek said, resentfully, and gestured towards a small kitchen timer next to him. \nStiles took Deaton\u2019s abandoned chair across the board. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got a minute left,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cThink of something?\u201d\n\u201cI thought of it ten seconds in,\u201d Derek said. They both watched until the kitchen timer dinged. Then Derek leaned over and moved one of the pieces, taking one of Deaton\u2019s. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said to himself. \n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cYou just set yourself up.\u201d Before he could stop himself, he leaned over and showed Derek. \u201cCheck,\u201d he said. \nDerek growled and stared at the board, clearly trying to challenge it, but failing badly. \u201cOf course you can play this too,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI had computer lab last period three years in a row,\u201d Stiles said offhandedly. \u201cI used to finish the work in thirty seconds and play internet chess for the rest of the time.\u201d\nHe grimaced at the board. \u201cI can\u2019t move my king.\u201d\n\u201cThink about it for longer than that,\u201d Stiles said, rolling his eyes. \u201cNo wonder your plans are all such shit.\u201d\n\u201cThat was the entire point of the exercise, although I would have phrased it differently,\u201d Deaton said, coming back in the room. He waved Stiles off when he stood to surrender the chair. \u201cNo need, you can continue playing my side.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles said, shrugging. Deaton walked over to the cabinets, took out a small pot with what looked like a foul, dark liquid, a bag of Reese\u2019s Pieces and disappeared again. \n\u201cThat dude is the strangest guy in the world,\u201d Stiles said, kicking Derek under the table. \n\u201cKick me again and I\u2019ll rip your throat out,\u201d Derek said but there was no heat behind his words. \u201cGo play with your candle.\u201d\nStiles kicked him one last time and then slid off the chair, traipsing back to his stool.\n*\nThe next Saturday, Stiles couldn\u2019t get out of bed any easier. He swore to himself when he again didn\u2019t have time to stop for coffee, and prepared himself for another tragically caffeine-less day. \nThen he walked into the clinic and found a battered old coffee pot sitting on Deaton's desk. \n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Stiles said, stopping dead in his tracks. \u201cDude, Deaton, you do love me.\u201d\n\u201cStill no,\u201d Deaton said, looking up from the newspaper he was reading. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it, Mr. Hale did.\u201d\nDerek looked away, embarrassed. \u201cIt was cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t get excited.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Stiles said, thrilled. \u201cI love Wanda. Wanda is my best friend.\u2019\nDerek smacked himself in the forehead, but Stiles wasn\u2019t listening. He was too busy crooning sweet nothings to to the coffee pot.\nDeaton disappeared and then came into the room carrying a box of wood and tools.\n \u201cWhoa,\u201d Stiles said, eyeing him. \u201cIs that a saw?\u201d\n\u201cNot for you,\u201d Deaton said, and gestured to the candle. Stiles ignored him in favor of pouring himself more coffee.\nDeaton set his armload down on the table, and Derek gingerly took a seat in front of him. \u201cToday you\u2019re going to build a birdhouse,\u201d Deaton said, laying out the pieces of wood. \nStiles guffawed, and Derek kicked out at him without looking. \u201cA birdhouse,\u201d he said, flatly.\n\u201cA birdhouse,\u201d Deaton agreed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to narrate your reasoning every step of the way as you do it, out loud.\u201d\nDerek looked horrified, and Stiles was literally shoving his face into his own elbow to keep his laughter silent. \u201cCan\u2019t I play chess?\u201d Derek said desperately. \u201cPull my nails off with pliers?\u201d\nDeaton shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not forcing you to be here,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cYou can do as you wish, if you\u2019re too nervous.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Derek said immediately. He glared angrily at the table for a moment, and then stood up. Deaton cleared his throat pointedly. Derek rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom,\u201d he bit out. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019d be a bad idea to pee on the birdhouse.\u201d\nStiles laughed so hard he cried.\n*\n\u201cAre you still going to Werewolf Summer School?\u201d Scott asked one afternoon, collapsing in the grass next to Stiles. The sun beat down on them, and Stiles regretting being the one to demand they practice in full lacrosse gear.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said, uncapping his water bottle. \u201cYou should have stayed. It\u2019s kind of fun. I feel like I know so much now, and the bestiary is gonna be so good, not so cobbled together or pilfered from Argents.\u201d\nScott made a face. \u201cDerek though. He\u2019s so\u2014\u201d He made a vomit noise.\nStiles shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, sometimes.\u201d\nScott frowned. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Derek? Derek Hale? I can\u2019t believe you can stand being in the room with him that long without trying to kill him.\u201d \nStiles hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s trying,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s like, Deaton keeps giving us weird, hard things to do. I\u2019m getting off easy, he mostly just makes me sit quietly and meditate, or whatever. Sometimes I learn horrifyingly cool stuff, and read weird books. But Derek, he has to do these things he hates, but he does them.\u201d He shaded his eyes from the sun, watching shapes on the edge of the field begin to take form as people approaching. \u201cI think he knows he messed up last year. I think this is his way of trying to be different.\u201d\nScott made a noise, obviously still dubious. \u201cThat\u2019s what Isaac said,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t see it if you keep avoiding him,\u201d Stiles said. He was weirdly bothered by the conversation; he wanted to keep defending Derek, and didn\u2019t know why. \u201cYou should come, sometime. You could learn things with us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Scott said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re for.\u201d\nStiles threw his stick at him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d one of the guys approaching them said. \u201cWorking hard?\u201d He moved out of the sun, and Stiles realized it was Danny, with a group of friends Stiles didn\u2019t know. \n\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d Scott said, smiling up at him. \u201cC\u2019mon Stiles,\u201d and Stiles moved obligingly to gather their stuff. \n\u201cDon\u2019t go on our account,\u201d one of Danny\u2019s friends, a blond guy with a charming smile, said, winking at him. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Stiles said, accidentally hitting himself with his own stick. \u201cWe\u2019re baking out here anyway.\u201d \n\u201cSmooth,\u201d Danny said, laughing at him. Stiles gave him the finger, and moved off, surrendering the field to them. \n*\nSaturdays quickly started becoming both something he looked forward to and simultaneously dreaded. He had made no more progress on the candle front, couldn\u2019t even get it warm, never mind cause a flame. \nBut the other stuff, he kind of enjoyed. The world was so much bigger than he ever realized it was, and it was insane how many myths and legends he had known as a kid were actually true, and how many more that he hadn\u2019t even know to dream of. \nHe would probably always be haunted by a chapter he found on the reproductive habits of a six-armed demon-type thing that looked like a koala drawn by a six-year-old. He still didn\u2019t fully understand why so much oozing was required. So much oozing. \nDeaton told them stories sometimes, when he was in the mood and it became incredibly clear that the dude had been in the shit. Stiles couldn\u2019t help but look at him with a new respect now, and a healthy amount of fear. \nThe chessboard made an appearance a few more times, but Deaton had Stiles playing Derek, which Stiles thought was an excellent distraction from his total lack of magical abilities. \nHe and Derek ended up talking too, sometimes, over the games. Deaton would leave the room, going to deal with his vet responsibilities and they would kick back, bantering and trash-talking each other until Derek inevitably lost again. \nSometimes, his least favorite times, they caught themselves rehashing old territory.\n\u201cIf it had been Lydia,\u201d Derek said, controlled and rigid. \u201cOr if Lydia had loved Jackson less, or not even, I wouldn\u2019t have been wrong. We couldn\u2019t stop it, we couldn\u2019t\u2014people died. You can\u2019t say I\u2019m fucked up when you didn\u2019t care about how many people died because you had the hots for some girl.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it just because of a crush,\u201d Stiles said, angry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one who thought, hey, maybe there\u2019s another way. Scott said it too, Scott\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it might look like there\u2019s another way,\u201d Derek said, and upended a pawn meaningfully. \u201cBut it could be a trap. You need to learn when to listen to me. Scott doesn\u2019t know everything. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s going to make mistakes that could ruin his life.\u201d Derek shook his head. \u201cJesus, he\u2019s just a stupid kid.\u201d\n\u201cOh he\u2019s a stupid kid?\u201d Stiles said, gesturing to himself pointedly. \u201cThen what does that make me?\u201d \n\u201cSmarter than that,\u201d Derek said, looking at Stiles, irritated. \n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Stiles said tightly, moving his knight to put Derek\u2019s king in check. \u201cBut Scott\u2019s my best friend, and he\u2019s doing the best he can. I\u2019m always going to take his side.\u201d\n\u201cEven if he\u2019s wrong?\u201d Derek snapped out, slamming a piece down. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles said, and his heartbeat didn\u2019t waver. \n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you lose. Checkmate.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Deaton said, stepping towards them. Stiles hadn\u2019t even heard him re-enter the room. \u201cThis accomplishes nothing, and you\u2019re both very close to breaking the agreement here.\u201d\n\u201cGive me a book then,\u201d Derek said. \u201cOr talk to me, I don\u2019t care. Just stop making me work with him. It\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m here.\u201d\nDeaton gave him a look. \u201cI know you\u2019re not stupid enough to think there\u2019s only one reason why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is a subtle pack merging attempt,\u201d Stiles said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cThen you should have kept Scott, not me.\u201d Deaton shrugged, giving nothing away in his expression. \n\u201cThat speech you gave me last year about trust,\u201d Derek said, abruptly. \u201cThat was about Scott, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cOr maybe things work out as they were meant to.\u201d He left the room again, with one warning glance at the two of them. \nThe anger was leaving Stiles, replaced by curiosity. \u201cWhat were you talking about? What speech about Scott?\u201d he asked, turning his whole body towards Derek. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek said grumpily. \u201cJust once, I wish that guy would say something I\u2019d like to hear.\u201d\n\u201cI think you have a better chance of flying,\u201d Stiles said and Derek\u2019s mouth quirked up a bit, and his foot brushed against Stiles\u2019s, a little like a kick but more like an apology.\n*\nSaturday came around again, and Stiles swung himself out of bed easily, shedding his pajamas and throwing on jeans and a tee. \n\u201cMorning, Wanda,\u201d he sang out to the coffee pot as he came into the clinic and started her up. \u201cYou look ravishing today.\u201d The coffee pot rumbled happily, growing warm under his hand. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not even plugged in,\u201d Derek said, frowning at him. \n\u201cOops,\u201d Stiles said, grabbing for the cord. \u201cI must have just pulled it out.\u201d But he could still hear Wanda burbling, even before he got the cord back into the outlet. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSo that\u2019s happening.\u201d \n\u201cYou are supposedly magic,\u201d Derek said, dubiously. \nStiles eyed the coffee pot. \u201cI guess,\u201d he said. \u201cWould be nice if I knew how it worked.\u201d He looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Deaton? He should probably see this.\u201d\nDerek shrugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t see him yet.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles said, and backed away from Wanda entirely to take his normal seat at the table. \u201cHow\u2019s the train car of misery and desolation?\u201d\n\u201cDesolate and miserable,\u201d Derek said. \u201cLast night we had a group recital of The Raven.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d pay to see Boyd do that,\u201d Stiles said in earnest. He focused in on what Derek was doing, which was studying the pages of Teen Vogue. \u201cAre you seriously reading that?\u201d\n\u201cI hang out with teenagers,\u201d Derek said, solemn. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to keep up with the trends.\u201d\nStiles shoved up next to him, leaning on him to read over his shoulder. \u201cHow to Get Voted Most Popular,\u201d he read. \u201cThis is surreal.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some good tips,\u201d Derek said loftily. \u201cIn case any of them want that, I\u2019m ready for advising them.\u201d\n\u201cOh of course, it\u2019s for them,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not reading for yourself, for Pack Superlatives?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the alpha,\u201d Derek said. \u201cEveryone would already have to vote for me.\u201d\n\u201cNot me. I told you,\u201d Stiles said, laughing. \u201cTen out of ten times, I\u2019m gonna pick Scott.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Most Banging Beach Bod?\u201d Derek drawled, kicking his feet up onto the counter. \u201cSurely I win that one.\u201d He drew his hand from the top of his chest down the line of his abs, tugging on the hem of his shirt. \n\u201cScott\u2019s pretty beachy,\u201d Stiles said, but his voice was too high and his tongue felt suddenly too big for his mouth. Derek smirked like he didn\u2019t need to hear Stiles\u2019s heartbeat to know he was lying. \nLuckily that was when Deaton came in, and Stiles was saved from saying anything else. \n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles said cheerfully. \u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d\nDeaton spared a look at him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Stiles said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to think about that a little more, maybe inspect Wanda a little closer?\u201d \nDeaton stared at him, unamused. \n\u201cThe coffee pot isn\u2019t plugged in,\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re a damn fun ruiner,\u201d Stiles accused him, outraged. \nDeaton crossed the room instantly, to see for himself. \u201cYou did this?\u201d he asked Stiles. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles said, deflating. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was like that when I came in.\u201d\n\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Derek said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on when I came in.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your spark,\u201d Deaton told Stiles. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been talking about. You should be able to feel it, if you concentrate.\u201d\nStiles closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. He didn\u2019t feel any different, didn\u2019t know how to give Deaton what he was looking for. He felt a lot like he had when he was eleven, and hoping Harry Potter was real, to be completely honest. \nWanda burbled, and Stiles\u2019s thought process immediately jumped to the coffee pot. It was entirely possible, he thought, that it wasn\u2019t his effort at all. Maybe Derek had found a magic coffee pot. Maybe it was all a coincidence and Wanda was a person trapped in a coffee filter. Maybe this was all independent of him, and it was Wanda who should be getting the praise and attention. Maybe he should bring in some hazelnut grounds next week and reward her. \nHe felt it then, suddenly and abruptly. It was like something under his skin, but not far, gathering and swirling through him. It perked up when he recognized it, and Stiles wanted to say hello there, like greeting an old friend. \n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said, opening his eyes. \u201cI know what the spark is.\u201d\nDeaton pushed the candle towards him. \u201cUse it,\u201d he urged. \nStiles stared intently at the candle, and focused on everything Deaton had said. I believe the candle could light he thought to himself, over and over and over. I believe, I believe, I believe. \nNothing happened. The candle stared back at him. \n\u201cCoffee\u2019s good though,\u201d Derek said, sniffing as he poured a cup. \u201cIs this hazelnut?\u201d\n* \nIt wasn\u2019t always Saturdays either. It was a Wednesday, the first time Stiles\u2019s phone buzzed with a text, and he opened it to see the message come out from a strange number. He rolled his eyes, saved the number, and went outside. \nDerek was a block down, leaning against his car, the long lines of his body bathed in the light of the moon. Stiles bit his tongue, hard, when he saw him. Stupid happy-go-lucky dick. This was not becoming a thing.\n\u201cCan you look at something with me?\u201d Derek said, straightening as Stiles approached. \n\u201cI think this exact scenario was in one of my dad\u2019s pedophile lectures,\u201d Stiles said, and Derek gave him a look before turning to slide back into his car. Stiles wanted to protest over Derek just assuming the answer would be yes, but truth be told, he was kind of curious so he climbed in. \nDerek\u2019s \u201csomething\u201d was in the woods, because everything creepy happened in the woods. Derek stuck close to him, arms brushing as they walked. Stiles shivered, as the heat from Derek\u2019s body made his goosebumps rise on his skin. \n\u201cCold?\u201d Derek said, breaking the comfortable silence. Stiles shook his head, unwilling to make up an explanation when Derek would hear the lie anyway. Derek nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just up here,\u201d he said, and pointed to an ancient-looking rock. \nThere was a symbol drawn on it, an old looking rune. Stiles was abruptly and instantly fascinated. \u201cShit,\u201d he breathed, and then wrinkled his nose. \u201cWait, is that?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles said. \u201cBecause I want to get closer, but it looks like it and that\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\u201cI think I could tell,\u201d Derek said, rolling his eyes. \n\u201cGet a lot of flaming bags on your doorstep?\u201d Stiles muttered, but he stepped forward to examine it. \n\u201cMore like send them,\u201d Derek said and crouched next to him. \u201cDo you know what it means?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, reluctant. \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s familiar, like I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s definitely not good. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s the alpha pack coming back, do you?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, and looked off in the distance, as if he was done speaking, before visibly reconsidering. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s not their style, and plus, it smells off. Like weird magic, not like yours or Deaton\u2019s. Just off. I took a run around, looking for something weird, but I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean anything weirder than usual,\u201d Stiles said. He gave Derek a look. \u201cBirdhousing?\u201d he said, impressed. Derek gritted his teeth and nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, trying to meet Derek halfway. \u201cAppreciated.\u201d He snapped a picture with his cell phone, and then tucked it in his pocket. \u201cI guess that\u2019s all we can do until Saturday. I bet one of Deaton\u2019s books will help.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Derek said, and herded him back to the car, his hand warm on the small of Stiles\u2019s back. \u201cWe'll work on it Saturday.\u201d\n*\n\u201cLook at this one,\u201d Derek said the next time they met, shoving an open book across the table. \u201cNone of these symbols are right, but it\u2019s close.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles said, scrutinizing the book more closely. \u201cDidn\u2019t Deaton give you this last week? I thought you usually faked reading to spend more time contemplating the hollowness of life.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I accidentally pay attention,\u201d Derek said, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou gonna look or what?\u201d\n\u201cThis does look similar to our thing,\u201d Stiles said, reading on. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s a making something spell? Or a moving something spell?\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Derek deadpanned. \u201cThat narrows it down.\u201d \n\u201cFeel free to do it yourself,\u201d Stiles said, shoving the book back at him. Derek put one index finger on the top of the book, and effectively halted the book\u2019s movement towards him, no matter how hard Stiles pushed. Stiles opened his mouth to fight about it, but Deaton took that moment to walk in. \n\u201cToday, I thought we could\u2014\u201d he started, hefting a large box in his arms but Derek interrupted. \n\u201cWe\u2019re actually working on something else, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nDeaton looked surprised, but not displeased. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, and did an about-face through the door. \n\u201cWe could ask him for help,\u201d Stiles said, under his breath.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Derek said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d Stiles sniped. \u201cThat\u2019s your thing, that\u2019s why you suck.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust youbut I\u2019m letting you help,\u201d Derek said grumpily. \n\u201cOh sure, letting. Like you\u2019re not incredibly lucky I\u2019m here.\u201d But he took the book back, studying the page Derek had opened it to. \n*\nThey couldn\u2019t find the exact symbol in any of the books they looked through. The best Stiles could hypothesize was that it was for generating energy, but he didn\u2019t necessarily think it was someone getting power for themselves. It made his brain hurt. \n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Stiles said, shutting the book. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if this person was even being malicious.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is malicious,\u201d Derek said darkly, but he stood up too. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d \n\u201cPessimist,\u201d Stiles said, but he grabbed his hoodie and bag of Weird Werewolf Things and followed Derek out. \n*\nStiles hated when Derek was right. It grated on him like nails on the worst, most annoying, grumpiest chalkboard. There was a figure in the road, and if it wasn\u2019t making hell-hound level growls, it would have been kind of sweet looking, like a gingerbread man. It wasn\u2019t tall, about half their height, and it was made out of the same stuff they had found painted on the rock. \nDerek hit the brakes so hard they squealed and Stiles would have rocketed forward if not for how Derek\u2019s arm shot out to restrain him. \nStiles said, \"Oh, great, it's the Pillsbury Poop Boy,\" but Derek wasn't around to appreciate his witty summation of events; he had slammed his door open as soon as the car stopped. He started running, wolfed out, and slashed the thing.\nStiles reached for the zipper of his bag, and fumbled for one of the powders he\u2019d gotten from Deaton. He dumped a handful on the center of his palm and slid out if the car, looking for an opening to douse the stupid thing.\n\u201cStiles!\u201d Derek gritted out, throwing the thing to the ground. It paused, dazed, but recovered too well, reaching for Derek again. \n\u201cI can\u2019t get it,\u201d Stiles said, frustrated. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop moving.\u201d\n\u201cDo something,\u201d Derek yelled, before attacking it again. \n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Just ask it nicely? Hey guy, mind being nice and holding still for a sec so I can blow some powder over your gross little body that\u2019ll kill you dead?\u201d \nShockingly, the figure stopped, staring weirdly at Stiles. It held still, waiting for something; Stiles didn\u2019t know what, but he knew an opportunity when he saw it. He showered the thing with the powder, and willed it to work. \u201cDie motherfucker,\u201d he whispered, feeling the magic thrum through his body, coiling around his bones.\nThe thing shriveled, dried up like a dead leaf in autumn. \u201cNice one,\u201d Derek said, standing up and shifting back. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles said, preening a little. \u201cI wonder why it stopped. Do you think that was my magic?\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Derek said, and buried the body. \n*\nIt was comfortable there, in the passenger seat of Derek\u2019s car. Usually he hated not being the driver, so much more confident being the one behind the wheel, but it felt okay in the Camaro. Plus, the heated leather seats were much nicer than the Jeep\u2019s. \n\u201cIt ripped my jacket,\u201d Derek grumbled, speeding faster than Stiles thought was necessary, and he hoped his dad wasn\u2019t anywhere near them. \n\u201cIt also gouged a hole in your thigh,\u201d Stiles added, admiring the way the bloody cords of Derek\u2019s muscles were still disgustingly visible, even as the wound was beginning to close.\n\u201cThat will heal,\u201d Derek muttered. \u201cLeather doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou big baby,\u201d Stiles said and snuck him up to his bedroom. They both got cleaned up, and Stiles made Derek help him get everything down into the bestiary Stiles was compiling and by the time they finished, it was late. \n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have taken you with me,\u201d Derek said disapprovingly. \u201cThat thing almost got you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not even the one who got hurt,\u201d Stiles pointed out. \n\u201cNext time, I\u2019m deciding\u2014\u201d Derek started. \n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cOf the two of us, one of us is qualified to make decisions, and it ain\u2019t you, Hale.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stifle a yawn behind his fist in time, and Derek tipped him out of the chair and shoved him into bed. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a bully,\u201d he said, burrowing into his sheets. \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Derek said, and brushed his knuckles over the side of Stiles\u2019s jaw. Stiles heard rather than saw the window open and close behind him. \nThe last thing he saw before he passed out was Derek\u2019s stupid torn jacket tossed over his chair. \u201cHey litterbug,\u201d he slurred, thinking Derek might still be in hearing range, but fell asleep before he could get out the rest of the sentence. \n*\nHe never did remember to get Derek to take the jacket back, and weirdly, it started to taunt him. Stiles always had a hard time putting stuff out of his mind, and every time he passed the stupid thing, he was distracted by thoughts of Derek. He put it on twice, looking in the mirror to if he looked like a wolf, looked intimidating and attractive like the rest of them, but he mostly just looked like Stiles, in someone else\u2019s jacket.\nOne night, bored and alone, having already jerked off twice, he Googled \u201chow to repair leather.\u201d It actually didn\u2019t look that hard, and he\u2019d never done it before, which made it all the more interesting. \n\u201cYou are a sexy-ass jacket,\u201d he told it, running his finger over the tears. \u201cDude, I can\u2019t believe he just wants to toss you. What kind of closet do train cars have that he can just afford to lose you?\u201d He uncapped the fabric glue, and eyed the patch in his hands. Couldn\u2019t make it worse, right?\nTo distract himself, he kept talking. It was what he did best, mostly. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s your fault. I mean, he\u2019s a giant idiot and throws himself into the dumbest situations, and you can\u2019t help that.\u201d He hummed, pressing the rip delicately around the edges. He was distracted for a moment by the sense of his magic poised at his fingertips and coiling around his wrists, but dismissed it. \u201cYou would tell him no, to knock it the fuck off if you could,\u201d he assured the jacket. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. You\u2019re protecting him the best you can.\"\nThe repair didn\u2019t actually hold the first time, nor the second. The third time was passable, but he ripped it out anyway, because he didn\u2019t like the look of one of the edges. As he worked, he kept his steady stream of words going, telling the jacket all the weird things that came into his brain. He tried not to let it bother him that it was almost entirely a monologue about Derek.\n It was only polite, he told himself, since Derek was the only person that he and the jacket had in common. \n*\nStiles was making absolutely no progress with the candle. They had tried it the other way now, with Deaton lighting the wick, and letting Stiles try to put it out. \nThe fourth time Stiles had accidentally just extinguished it with his breath, Deaton had finally lost it. \u201cStiles,\u201d he said, exasperated and tired. \u201cYou are capable of magic, and I know you know that. I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t hold onto the mindset and use it.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Stiles yelled. \u201cHow am I supposed to just will an object to do anything?. I don\u2019t understand\u2014every time it does work, when I manage to do something, anything, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not a spark or a flame\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014this is all so stupid!\u201d He threw himself backwards in the seat, and willed himself not to panic, to breathe, not to fucking cry.\n\u201cYou\u2019re usually talking,\u201d Derek said, into the angry silence.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles muttered, shoving his chair back and standing up. \u201cMore mockery, that\u2019s what I need.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, closing the book he wasn\u2019t reading anyway. Stiles could sort of tell now, when he was faking. \u201cI mean, when it works. You\u2019re usually talking at whatever it is, telling it what you want it to do.\u201d He didn\u2019t make eye contact with Stiles, ducking his head like he was embarrassed to have been caught noticing.\nStiles couldn\u2019t focus on him for long. His eyes met Deaton\u2019s, who looked surprised but made the \u201cgo ahead\u201d gesture. Stiles sank back into his seat and stared at the candle again. \n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d put the flame out,\u201d he said politely. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at being a candle, but it\u2019d be great if you just\u2014\u201d and the flame went out, suddenly and completely. Stiles gaped at it, completely startled by his success.\nDeaton was smiling, but he all said was, \u201cTry lighting it back up now, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles fixed his gaze back on the candle, flush with success. \u201cThat was great,\u201d he said, enthused. \u201cThat was so good, but now I\u2019m like, oh see, that was definitely a mistake. You were so great at being a candle, you should just light up again, and let everyone see how talented you are. All good-smelling and warm.\u201d He was probably overdoing it with his chatter, but this was it, this was the key, he thought; the breakthrough. \nThe candle wick flared up, burning bright and merry, and the scent of jasmine filled the air. It was Stiles\u2019s favorite smell, actually. His mom had burned it when he was a child, and it was part of Lydia\u2019s favorite shampoo. It was a good smell, he felt, and inhaled sharply to admire it. \n\u201cThat candle was plain wax,\u201d Deaton said, confused, but Derek stood, slapping Stiles on the back. \n\u201cNice job,\u201d he said. \u201cNow if the power goes out, we\u2019ll finally have a use for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to have power for that joke to even remotely work, you hobo weirdo,\u201d Stiles retorted, turning to try and glare but he was still grinning so hard that even the edges of Derek\u2019s mouth had to curl up in response. It just made Stiles feel happier, until he had to turn away, had to stop staring and smiling stupidly at Derek. \nThat night when he got home, he lasted about thirty seconds in the empty house before he was jerking his pants open, stroking himself hard and intense. He came all over himself in record time. \n*\nIt wasn\u2019t the end of the gross cookie-looking guys. There was another one, then another, and more late night visits from Derek that ended with Stiles luring the stupid things to their death. Stiles\u2019s strange vocal magic kept working on them. He and Derek worked out a routine where Derek would flush them out, Stiles would speak to them, then dust them, and Derek disposed of them.\nThen they\u2019d go get food, mock each other\u2019s choices and eat it in the car. Derek would drop him off and Stiles would finish off the routine, masturbating alone.\nHe should be kind of disturbed by how many of his jerk-off sessions happened right after horrifying life-threatening adventures. It was hard to worry about it, though, when it was too good to twist himself up on his sheets, panting and squirming down on his fingers before jerking himself off. It was just the adrenaline, a post-stress reaction that got him revved up.\nThe denial thing only worked for so long before he had to admit to himself how often he thought of Derek, imagining it was Derek\u2019s fingers inside, Derek\u2019s hand wrapped around his cock, Derek on him and in him, shoving him down and touching him. \u201cFuck, you want this, Derek,\u201d he moaned, rocking down on his fingers. \u201cYou want this, you fucking want this, you want me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n*\nDerek liked it when Stiles showed off. \nHe never said anything, didn\u2019t go as far as actually encouraging Stiles, but somehow Stiles knew it all the same. \nThey were playing chess, and Derek was getting better, good enough that Stiles couldn\u2019t just go back to his book for awhile so Derek could scowl his way through his turn. Stiles had to watch, had to think about his own moves. But he was still Stiles, so pretty soon he figured out that he could ask the chess pieces to move for him, to cross the board when he wanted them to. \n\u201cWhat a good bishop you are,\u201d Stiles said approvingly, when one slid into the right space for him. He could feel his magic responding now, content like a cat purring in his lap. There was almost a warm hum of approval when he used it, now that he knew how it worked. \n\u201cToo bad it was a terrible move,\u201d Derek said, but he was smiling, his posture loose and relaxed in a way that Stiles still couldn\u2019t fully get used to seeing. It was a thrill, something that glowed in him, that he could make that smile appear, and more than anything, it made him want Derek. \nHe had wanted people before. There was Lydia, for years and years, and Danny, off and on. There was a girl who worked the late shift at a sandwich shop downtown who made Stiles\u2019s heart flutter every time she wielded the mayo bottle. \nNone of it compared to the way he wanted Derek. He couldn\u2019t help but let it swell in his chest how much he wanted Derek, how stupid he was for him.\nThe smile faded from Derek\u2019s face, little by little, replaced by something else, something more complicated. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles said, standing up suddenly, embarrassed. \u201cSo if we\u2014\u201d and without him hearing, noticing, Derek was on him, touching his shoulder, pulling him gently against the line of Derek\u2019s body. Stiles sucked in a short, sharp breath and then Derek was dipping his head to kiss it right out of him. \nIt was a shock, but Stiles was kissing him back before he even processed what was happening. His magic sung out, coursing through him everywhere they were touching. He fisted his hands in Derek\u2019s shirt and hauled him even closer, until they were pressed chest to chest and Derek was cupping the back of his skull, holding him still to kiss him, deep and wet, until Stiles had to pull back, had to breathe. \nHe opened his eyes. Derek looked like the stuff of his deepest fantasies. His shirt was rumpled where Stiles had his hands in it, and he was breathing hard as well, chest heaving. His eyes\u2014his eyes were glazed over and he looked stunned, like he\u2019d been\u2014like Stiles had\u2014\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, blood draining from his face. The word was croaky and felt like it had to be wrenched out of his chest. \u201cGod, no.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek said, confused. He reached forward, hand grazing Stiles\u2019s elbow, but Stiles ripped it away, slid out from where Derek had him pinned.\nIt wasn\u2019t real. He had done this, like the little men, like the coffee pot and the candle, and everything else. He had wanted Derek, had jerked off to Derek in his own imagination countless times, had poured his belief into each and every fantasy. Now he had gotten it. \nStiles could be a selfish person, but not this selfish. Not like this, he thought viciously at whatever part of himself did crap like this, could make something like this happen. \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d he said clearly and loudly, forcing conviction behind the words. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this,\u201d and that was easier, truer. \n\u201cYou seemed to like it just fine a minute ago,\u201d Derek said, face going hard and closed off. His voice was biting, and Stiles flinched. He sounded like he had all those months ago, when they first started Saturdays together. \n\u201cYeah, you misunderstood,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not,\u201d he hesitated, knowing it was a low blow. \u201cNot with you.\u201d\nDerek reeled back like he\u2019d been hit. His mouth opened, and then closed again and Stiles hated the look on his eyes, the raw, split open pain. He was racking his brain for something else to say, some middle ground he could walk, when Derek turned and left, so quickly he might have been running.\nStiles slumped down against the wall and stayed there for a long time. \n*\nHe couldn\u2019t be around Derek. Couldn\u2019t look at him, talk to him, couldn\u2019t be trusted to be near him. Not until he could learn to control himself, and Stiles had never been very good at that to begin with. \n\u201cI want separate lessons,\u201d he told Deaton, restlessly fidgeting in the middle of Deaton\u2019s office. \nDeaton stopped, looking up from the paperwork he had been sorting and eyed him. \u201cSeparate from Derek, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said, twisting his fingers together. He didn\u2019t know why he was so hesitant to tell Deaton what he\u2019d done. Deaton could help, probably, could teach him how to stop, but Stiles couldn\u2019t imagine getting the words out, facing Deaton with the cold facts. He was no better than a frat kid with a roofie and he didn\u2019t want to see the look on Deaton\u2019s face when he realized it. \nLuckily, after a beat of silence, Deaton nodded. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWednesday.\u201d\nStiles still woke up early on Saturday, and he rolled over, swinging his legs over the bed before he remembered. \u201cWell, this is awful,\u201d he said, and tried to smother himself with a pillow. \nIt didn\u2019t stop being awful. All week, he found himself reaching for his phone, looking for Derek\u2019s car, forgetting again and again before it all crashed down, like a punch to his chest. \nAnother Saturday morning went by, and Stiles threw himself into video games, headphones jammed on his head, blocking everything out. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d his dad yelled, shaking his shoulder, like he\u2019d been repeating it for awhile. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles said, blinking as he tore his eyes away from the screen. \n\u201cDo you want dinner?\u201d his dad said, frowning at him in concern. \n\u201cNot really,\u201d Stiles said. Was it that late already? Hadn\u2019t he only had breakfast an hour ago? He shook his head to clear it. \u201cYou heading out?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d his dad said, his voice concerned. \u201cI can stay though, if you need something.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said flatly, and unpaused his game. His dad hesitated for another minute, and then left. Stiles listened until he heard the front door open and close again. \nIt got late, and eventually Stiles got in bed, only to lay there, staring at the ceiling. Sleep eluded him, was about as possible as him growing wings. He was just contemplating giving up, going downstairs to eat his feelings, when his window slid open and Derek was there. \n\u201cYou stopped coming to Deaton\u2019s,\u201d he said, subdued. He leaned back against the window, eyes on Stiles. \nStiles sat up, averting his eyes, resolutely thinking safe, blank thoughts. \u201cScheduling conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dance card just got too jampacked and I had to make some adjustments. You know how it is. Living the crazy life.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Stiles,\u201d Derek said, low and pained. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have\u2014I\u2019m not going to touch you again. You don\u2019t have to think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Stiles rushed to assure him, to stop this in its tracks. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, you\u2019re\u2014I just need more time,\u201d he said, and it sounded lame in his own ears. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me, he almost said but he wasn\u2019t trying to piss Derek off more than he already had. \nDerek nodded, stiff and jerky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth. You were right to stop\u2014I know I\u2019m not\u2014anyway, it was smart. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThis was agony. Pure and utter torture. He wished a meteor would fall from the sky and land right on him, to crush him into a million battered pieces, anything to end this conversation. Derek was beautiful in the moonlight, the long lines of his body mouth-watering as he leaned back against the window, and he was apologizing for wanting Stiles, under the impression Stiles thought he wasn\u2019t worth it, wasn\u2019t good enough. There weren\u2019t enough meteors in the world for the explosion Stiles wanted to happen right now. \n\u201cYou should take your jacket,\u201d he said, for lack of literally anything else in the world to say. He gestured at it, where it sat draped over the back of Stiles\u2019s computer chair. \nDerek blinked, confused as he followed Stiles\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou still have that,\u201d he said that, slow and confused. \u201cI thought you must have thrown it out.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI mended it, the rips, I mean. I fixed it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Derek said politely, examining it. He stepped back towards the window, clutching the jacket in his hands, and then stopped, turning back. \u201cCome back,\u201d he said, desperate. \u201cTo Saturdays, at least. Please.\u201d\n\u201cSoon,\u201d Stiles said, and his voice was wrecked. \u201cWhen I can.\u201d\nDerek left then, without another word. Stiles locked the window behind him. \n*\n\u201cI really want to help you, though,\u201d Scott said earnestly, passing him a blue raspberry slurpee. \u201cYou\u2019re always there for me with Allison, and I\u2019m trying here, but it\u2019s kind of hard when you won\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles said, and mangled the straw viciously. \u201cI appreciate it anyway, dude.\u201d\nScott slapped him on the back, and they headed back to the car together, Stiles kicking rocks the whole time. \n\u201cHey,\u201d someone said, chasing them out of the 7-11. Stiles turned and vaguely recognized him as the guy who winked at him on the lacrosse field. Rob? Rick? Ron?\n\u201cI thought it was you,\u201d the guy said easily, giving Stiles a smile. He stuck out his hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Ryan.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he said, shaking it. \nRyan held his hand a beat too long, and then turned to Scott. \u201cAre you Stiles\u2019s\u2014\u201d and he let the sentence hang a moment while Scott and Stiles stared at him. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles said, appalled. \u201cDude, gross.\u201d\n\u201cBest friend,\u201d Scott said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get something out of the car, I\u2019ll just be, yeah,\u201d and he ducked sideways into the passenger\u2019s seat and closed the door. \nRyan smiled at him, his blond hair falling into his face. \u201cThat makes this much less awkward,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWhat does?\u201d Stiles said. He kind of saw where this was going, but he was intrigued by how calm he was, how his magic was asleep, not alive and dancing up and down his skin. \n\u201cYou not being with him,\u201d Ryan said, nodding at the car where Scott sat, big stupid smile on his face. \u201cBecause I would have asked you out anyway.\u201d\nStiles felt nothing about this kid. Totally, completely nothinged him. It was perfect. He grinned and stole Ryan\u2019s phone, and typed his number in. \nWhen he finally slid in behind the wheel, Scott punched him lightly on the shoulder. \u201cThis is good! This will cheer you up! Maybe you and Ryan will fall in love tonight and go on double dates with Allison and me all the time!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Stiles said, but couldn\u2019t really picture it, no matter how hard he tried. \n*\nRyan took him to a pizza place on the outskirts of town. He was a nice guy, and Stiles could see why Danny liked him. He was funny, easy-going and interested, leaning slightly towards Stiles, listening attentively when he talked. It was charming, and Stiles was into it, because no one, with the exception of Scott sometimes, ever made a point of letting Stiles know they were listening. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ryan said, leaning back with the air of someone issuing a challenge. \u201cFavorite Adult Swim show, go.\u201d\n\u201cPast or present?\u201d Stiles said, eyes narrowed. \n\u201cEither,\u201d Ryan said, licking the grease off his fingers. \nStiles clapped his hand over his heart. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said, grimacing. \u201cDon\u2019t go for the easy questions, or anything.\u201d\nRyan shrugged at him, smirking. \u201cNo pressure, but if you answer wrong, I\u2019m gonna dine and ditch.\u201d\nStiles laughed, and tapped his fingers against his lips, thinking, when he glanced up to see Derek standing a few feet behind Ryan, frozen, with a devastated look on his face. \n\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles stammered out. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\u201cAre you ditching without even answering?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the date was going that bad.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Stiles said, internally dying over the way he knew Derek heard the word date. \u201cI just\u2014seriously, five minutes, sorry, so sorry.\u201d He squirmed out of the booth and headed for Derek, who only seemed to unfreeze when Stiles approached. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Stiles hissed, dragging Derek by the wrist towards the entrance. \u201cIs something wrong? Is everyone okay? Derek, don\u2019t leave me in suspense, dude. Just tell me how bad it is.\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d Derek said, and his skin actually felt a little chilled where Stiles was holding him. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why are you here? Are you\u2014you\u2019re not following me?\u201d and his mind conjured up an image of Derek as a lemming, falling mindlessly off a cliff, will forever subjugated by Stiles.\n\u201cOrder for Hale,\u201d the guy at the counter said, and Stiles flinched with his whole body. \n Derek just looked at him, face still so crushed and pinched. \u201cEnjoy your date,\u201d he said, his voice like a car crash, before he pulled his wrist free and walked away. \nRyan was still incredibly sweet when Stiles got back, and he stayed sweet, even when Stiles asked to go home, and neither of them brought up another date.\n*\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott said the next day, bumping his shoulder into Stiles\u2019s after dropping off a bag to Scott\u2019s mom at the hospital. \u201cSo Ryan wasn\u2019t your Allison. You can\u2019t just give up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can,\u201d Stiles said, bumping his shoulder back. \u201cOr maybe not giving up, but pausing. For a while. Maybe until I\u2019m eighty.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIf you\u2019re happy.\u201d\nStiles was debating how to answer that one when Scott suddenly jerked at his side, inhaling in the way that Stiles knew meant he was fighting a shift. \u201cScott,\u201d he hissed, grabbing Scott\u2019s arm and digging his nails in before he saw what Scott saw\u2014one of the little dirt guys standing there, in the bushes outside the hospital. \nIt had more of a human shape then the other\u2019s had, was closer to his and Scott\u2019s height, and had eyes which was possibly the creepiest part of all of it. They were mostly just divots, dips in its sort-of face but they lent menace to its appearance, something that sent shivers down Stiles\u2019s spine. \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Scott asked, fierce and low. \n\u201cThe monster things I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d Stiles said, already moving forward. \u201cThe ones we can\u2019t track, can\u2019t figure out where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can kill it?\u201d Scott said, his voice taking on more and more of a growl. \u201cDude, we\u2019re at my mom\u2019s work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Stiles said, already fumbling for the stupid emergency kit of defensive crap he\u2019d made up to fit in his school bag. He readied a palmful of the powdered herbs he\u2019d perfected on these things and started speaking calmly and steadily. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hold still and quiet. You can do that for me, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Scott said, behind him.\n\u201cNot you,\u201d Stiles snapped. \u201cYou are going to kill it!\u201d The creature twitched, and Stiles abruptly lowered his voice back down, crooning sweetly to it until he got close enough to dust it. \u201cNow, Scott!\u201d he yelled, and Scott swiped at it, right where its guts would have been if it was a person. \nNothing happened, except that bits of clay went flying. \u201cDude,\u201d Scott said. \u201cHow does it work when you and Derek do it?\u201d \n\u201cHe just kills it,\u201d Stiles said, mostly hysterical by now. \u201cIt\u2019s not usually this hard!\u201d He dusted it again, for good measure, and Scott ripped out its throat, separating the head from the body. The eyes moved still, and Stiles could see the limbs still twitching as if it wanted to get back up, to put itself together again. But then, finally, the magic went out of it, and it crumbled into clay and herbs again. \n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Scott said, slumping against the brick wall of the hospital. \u201cThat was awful.\u201d\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Stiles said, slumping next to him. \u201cTrying dealing with it ten more times.\u201d\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t figured out who\u2019s causing it?\u201d Scott said. \u201cDeaton doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly told him,\u201d Stiles hedged, and Scott rolled his eyes. \n\u201cDerek\u2019s a real good influence on you. Come on,\u201d he said, marching towards the Jeep. \u201cLet\u2019s go see Deaton.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Stiles said, already knowing it was a lost cause. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d\n*\nHe was half hoping Derek wouldn\u2019t be there, or that Deaton would see them separately, or maybe a giant asteroid would crash into the earth, directly on top of Beacon Hills. \nBut nothing ever worked out the way he wanted, so Stiles got to watch as Derek picked up his head and let his expression soften hopefully when Stiles entered, and then fall again, turning his attention resolutely away. Stiles wished even harder for a painful, explodey death. \n\u201cStiles needs everything you have on magic dirt,\u201d Scott said to Deaton, entirely ignoring Derek. \n\u201cDirt,\u201d Deaton said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific I think.\u201d\n\u201cClay,\u201d Stiles said, and he could feel Derek\u2019s attention on him. \u201cIt\u2019s more like clay. Someone\u2019s making Play-Doh people, but out of magic clay.\u201d\nDeaton hummed thoughtfully, and then turned, disappearing towards his office. There was an awkward minute of dead silence before he returned, brandishing books at Stiles. \n\u201cYou might need the use of this,\u201d he said, and placed a Hebrew to English dictionary on the top of the stack.\nStiles grimaced and settled down. \n\u201cYou,\u201d Deaton said to Scott, \u201cowe me some cage scrubbing.\u201d Scott groaned and trudged out of the room with him, leaving Stiles alone, reading quietly, with Derek. Derek didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t move to help, but his presence was soothing anyways, and Stiles stayed hyper-aware of him, even as he read. \nHe knew the moment he found it. His magic, which had been busy tingling at him in that way that signified Derek being close, (which he knew, thanks for nothing) immediately traveled down his body and centered around his hands where they held the book, like his skin was singing out that this was right. \nHe read and he read, and then he took notes, and read some more. A plan was taking shape in his mind, but it wasn\u2019t fully formed yet. \u201cI\u2019m taking this book,\u201d he yelled in the direction he thought Deaton and Scott were, and grabbed his bag, dashing for the door. \nDerek was in front of him, blocking the way. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d he said, and his eyes were laser focused on Stiles in a way that made him squirm. \u201cStiles, what is it,\u201d and he reached his hands out, like he was going to touch Stiles\u2019s hand where it was clutching the book.\nIt was too much. Too much magic and weird stuff going on and Derek and Stiles still was rolling with guilt over Derek seeing him with Ryan and he just\u2014\u201cStop,\u201d he said, shifting away, stepping back. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t, just let me through.\u201d\n\u201cLate for another date with your boyfriend?\u201d Derek said, folding his arms against his chest. \u201cTell me what you found.\u201d\nScott coughed once from behind Derek, eyes darting speculatively between them.\n\u201cNothing, he\u2019s not my boyfriend,\u201d Stiles said, and took the opportunity to duck past all of them. \n*\nStiles had been up all night making plans. Scott had let him be, had hung out around most of the night, trying to keep Stiles from ramping himself up higher and higher, but had eventually gone home when Stiles had decreed they both needed to crash. Stiles, however, hadn\u2019t slept a wink, and the second the sun had come back up, he was climbing out of his own window and sliding down the tree. \n\u201cCoffee?\u201d Derek said, from the passenger seat as Stiles snuck his way into the Jeep.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles swore, smacking his wrist on the back of the steering wheel. \u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d He accepted the Starbucks cup Derek was holding out to him, but didn\u2019t lessen his glare even a little.\n\u201cYou think after two months of working together, I can\u2019t tell when you\u2019re up to something?\u201d Derek drawled, settling back in the seat.\n\u201cI\u2019m not up to\u2014why would you\u2014you\u2019re seriously\u2014\u201d Stiles blustered, but Derek just sipped his own coffee, bracing one foot against the dash. \u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Stiles said, giving up. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I won\u2019t,\u201d Derek said, smug with triumph.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a golem,\u201d Stiles said, blowing the air out of his chest with a sigh. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been golems, practice ones I think. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been getting stronger, more formed. Whoever\u2019s making them, they\u2019re getting better. And the full moon tomorrow, I think that\u2019s when the trial goes live.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said slowly. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you just tell me that yesterday?\u201d\nStiles started the car, and put it in drive, mostly to have something to do with his hands. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to be able to kill them the way we have been,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a fluke, and the one last night, that one with Scott and me, we almost didn\u2019t get it.\u201d He chanced a look at Derek, and then darted his eyes away. \u201cThere\u2019s words, or a word, or a symbol that the caster has to use, has to draw on it somewhere. You\u2019re supposed to have to destroy that to stop a golem, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe must have been doing it by accident,\u201d Derek said, relaxing in the seat. \u201cSo what\u2019s the big deal? We aim for anything that looks written next time.\u201d\n\u201cWe still have to find the caster,\u201d Stiles reminded him. \u201cBut the one he\u2019s gonna make tomorrow, the big one? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that easy to kill.\u201d \n\u201cBut you have an idea of how?\u201d Derek said, getting impatient.\n\u201cYeah, this is where you get mad at me,\u201d Stiles said, and started talking.\n*\nThey pulled into the parking lot for the dingy liquor store, three blocks from their actual destination. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Derek fumed.\n\u201cI would like to remind you that I didn\u2019t invite you,\u201d Stiles said, slamming his way out of the Jeep.\nDerek was right with him, hot on his heels. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s going to work! It\u2019s a stupid risk, Stiles!\u201d\nAs Derek had now repeated this argument at least six times, Stiles felt justified in snapping. He whirled on Derek. \u201cLook, you want me to keep being the spark? You want me to help you and your friends with whatever stupid magic I can do? Then this is the trade-off! I am going to break into this museum, and I am going to steal a blessed dagger, and then I\u2019m going to stab a honking big monster with it. Because I\u2019m the only one who can. Okay?\u201d\nDerek clamped his mouth shut, still clenching his fists furiously. Stiles threw his hands up and kept walking, sticking more to the shadows as they approached. It was still early morning, and the street was quiet without the sounds of the morning commute. Stiles stuck his hands in his pockets and tried to look completely unobtrusive.\n\u201cThey\u2019re your friends too,\u201d Derek muttered as he caught up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you got out of that?\u201d Stiles said, but he didn\u2019t argue the point.\n\u201cHow do you know that book was even right?\u201d Derek said, nudging him towards a window of the museum that Stiles could just barely make out was cracked open. \u201cIt might not even be the right dagger.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Stiles said, absently, looking for something to use as a stepladder. \u201cI just have this feeling. I think I knew this was here all along.\u201d\nDerek huffed, and crouched under the window, lacing his fingers together, palms up. \u201cC\u2019mon then,\u201d he said.\nStiles grinned, and stepped up into his hold.\n*\nIt was the right dagger. Stiles didn\u2019t know how to explain it, but after Derek broke the case open, the dagger seemed to leap into his hands. He felt something deep, like an electric current but through his chest, sizzle when he touched it and he immediately tucked it away, stowed it in the bag he had brought with him. \n\u201cShit,\u201d Derek said, whipping his head around towards the entrance. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. We have to go.\u201d They barreled back down the way they had come, towards the open window, but even Stiles could hear the footsteps coming. With no time to doubt himself out of it, Stiles ducked behind a tapestry, pulling Derek with him. \u201cHide me,\u201d he told it. \u201cPlease hide us, please make them move on, please please please.\u201d The guard was there, huffing and puffing as he ran, but his feet never paused and Stiles heard him skid to a stop down the hall and around the corner, where the broken case was. \nDerek was grabbing him then, shoving him forward and up until his fingers were scrabbling on the open windowsill and they were out.\nStiles opened his phone as soon as they got back into the car and called Scott to tell him, but when Scott answered, he was half-hysterical. \n\u201cThe little dude things are everywhere,\u201d he yelled into the phone. \n\u201cGolems,\u201d Stiles said, like he had known that more than twenty-four hours. Then the words kicked in. \u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott nearly shrieked. \u201cYou have to come, there\u2019s two outside the hospital and my mom\u2019s at work, and I think your dad is on his way. You have to come do your dust thing.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Stiles said, panicking. The edge of the dagger was gleaming at him from the top of the bag. \u201cDude, there\u2019s a bigger one, there\u2019s a guy and he\u2019s controlling it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mom,\u201d Scott yelled, and Stiles winced and held the phone away from his ear \u201cHow can you not want to save her?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not in danger, Scott!\u201d Stiles said, wounded. \u201cShe\u2019ll be with my dad, and my dad has a gun which will definitely slow the little ones down. But the big guy, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to kill us all.\u201d\n\u201cYou think,\u201d Scott said accusingly, and Stiles faltered. He felt rather than heard Derek press in closer, the warm line of his body a solid presence against his back. \n\u201cDerek says so too,\u201d Stiles said, without needing to turn and check Derek\u2019s reaction. \u201cYou can do what you want, but I want\u2014I have to go with Derek.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Scott said, and his voice was angry and tight but he exhaled, clearly trying to calm himself down. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said more gently. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014I\u2019m not there. Just, don\u2019t get hurt. Tell Derek I\u2019ll murder him if you get hurt.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Stiles said, clutching the phone a little tighter. \u201cYou too. And If my dad asks, just tell him\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Scott said, already hanging up. \u201cI\u2019ll cover you.\u201d Then he was gone, silence on the other end.\nStiles bent and picked up the dagger, careful to avoid the wicked edge of the blade. \n\u201cCan you do this?\u201d Derek said, watching him intently. \n\u201cYeah\u2014yes,\u201d Stiles said, as much to convince himself as Derek. \u201cI got this.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\n*\nThey found the mega-golem at the same place they had found the first rune. It was beyond tall, and for a bizarre moment, Stiles almost laughed, looking up at the monster. It had rudimentary eyes and a half-formed mouth, but its hands were perfectly capable, as it proved when it picked Derek up, dangling him above the ground. \n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek barked at him. \u201cDo it now!\u201d He was sweating and red-faced, struggling against the thing\u2019s iron grip.\n\u201cYelling at me doesn\u2019t help!\u201d Stiles shot back, and pointedly turned his back. \u201cOkay,\u201d he addressed the dagger. \u201cActivate!\u201d The dagger gleamed, cold and unimpressed. \u201cStart,\u201d Stiles tried. \u201cOn. Go.\u201d \nThere was no reaction and Derek yelped as the golem dropped him onto the ground. \nStiles\u2019s hands shook and he felt fear lick down his spine. \u201cHey,\u201d he yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s 2013. How many chances do you think you\u2019ll have to slay a monster? Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a million daggers out there that would gladly trade your position? You\u2019re being an absolute idiot to let this pass you by. MaybeI should go find another dagger, one more brave and awe-inspiring.\u201d \nThe dagger twitched infinitesimally, and Stiles felt a mean sort of satisfaction break through the mind numbing fear. \u201cAfter all, the dagger that kills this golem, well, I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing but glory and admiration in its future. It\u2019d probably be revered among all daggers, as the best, most strong dagger in legend.\u201d\nThe dagger glowed finally, with a touch of indignation, Stiles felt. That was all right. It could be mad all it wanted as long as it worked. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said heartfelt, and darted forward with the dagger as it glowed brighter and brighter with each step. \u201cCome on,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d He drew his arm back, summoning all the will and belief he had, and brought the sacred dagger down in the meatiest part of the golem\u2019s belly, drawing a jagged line directly through a line of script drawn there. \nIt felt like stabbing a hoe into the ground. It slid in, and then the clay began to crumble and the golem fell, shaking the earth as it did. \nThere was a warm touch to his hand, and he looked to see Derek, mouth twisted and worried. \u201cYou\u2019re burned,\u201d he said, and Stiles looked down to see his hand was red and blistered where he had been gripping the dagger. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even hurt,\u201d he said, flexing his fingers. Derek\u2019s hand suddenly tightened around his wrist, and he yanked Stiles behind him as a figure dashed from behind the rock towards the treeline. \n\u201cFuck no,\u201d Derek snarled and leapt forward, dragging the man to the ground. \nIt was an odd sort of dude to be their villain. He was short and balding, with small framed glasses and a sweater vest. But his face was twisted in a sneer, and his hands were streaked with clay and blood. \u201cFuck you, mongrel,\u201d he hissed, and brought his hand up, another dagger hidden in his fist\nStiles moved, but not quick enough, and the dagger slashed him, a thin, deep line down his bicep. He hissed and dropped to one knee, trying to stop the bleeding.\nDerek roared, furious and vicious, and brought his claws down, slashing the man\u2019s throat. \n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles said, and he listed sideways, losing the adrenaline and fear that had kept him moving. \nBefore he could do more than stumble, Derek was there, taking his weight with a hand on the small of his back. He growled, herding Stiles impatiently into his car. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to see Deaton.\u201d\n\u201cIn the morning,\u201d Stiles said, slumping back in the seat in exhaustion.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d Derek said, shaking his head. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cDerek, I promise I\u2019ll see him first thing.\u201d He let his head loll against the window. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, hoarsely.\nDerek didn\u2019t look happy, but he didn\u2019t argue further, just turned the car towards Stiles\u2019s house. \nThe car was silent, and Stiles leaned his head back against the headrest. There was a part of him that revelled in his proximity to Derek, in being in Derek\u2019s car again, just the two of them. He didn\u2019t know what Derek was thinking, whether Derek was still being affected, so he kept his thoughts, and hopefully his magic, to himself.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, after the silence had gone on too long. He thumbed his phone open to read Scott\u2019s text yet again. \u201cWhen you killed that guy, they all crumbled. They\u2019re all at the station, giving statements. He\u2019ll probably be gone til morning.\u201d\nDerek nodded, and pulled into the driveway. Before Stiles could even begin to move towards the door, Derek was out of the car and coming around, opening Stiles\u2019s door and helping him out. \u201cNot an invalid,\u201d Stiles said grumpily, trudging towards his front door. \n\u201cStop getting hurt and I\u2019ll stop treating you like one,\u201d Derek retorted.\nStiles rolled his eyes and unlocked the door. \u201cI\u2019ll work on that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a good night, now.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Derek said, and bulldozed his way into the house. Before Stiles knew it, he was being herded upstairs to his room, bullied towards the computer chair, and held tight under Derek\u2019s hands as Derek carefully bandaged the slice on his arm\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to take those off,\u201d Derek said, when he was satisfied with his handiwork, nodding at Stiles\u2019s clothes. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave until I do,\u201d Stiles said, sighing hopelessly. Derek shook his head. \u201cAt least turn your back?\u201d he said edgily, hands on the fly of his jeans. Derek\u2019s mouth pulled down, but he turned, facing out the window while Stiles shucked the bloodstained guts-covered clothes off and pulled on pajamas. He should probably have showered, but standing was no longer on his list of things he wanted to do. \nHe flopped down on his back sideways over his bed, staring at the ceiling. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Time for you to go.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Derek said, clearly unwilling to do so. \u201cDo you want me to call...someone?\u201d He bit out the word like it was the last thing he wanted to offer. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, rolling his eyes. \u201cSince you\u2019re clearly going to keep bringing it up, I\u2019m not going to see him again, okay? I\u2019m Stiles the dateless wonder, once again.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said, in a marginally less grumpy tone. \u201cAre you going to be able to sleep?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles said, staring at a section of ceiling that still retained spots of the double sided tape he\u2019d used to hang glow-in-the-dark stars when he was eight. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cYou said that already,\u201d Derek said and suddenly he was there, standing between Stiles\u2019s thighs. Stiles tipped his head up to look at him, immediately on alert. He hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d been thinking about Derek particularly, but maybe he was doing it unconsciously now. Derek was looking down at him in a way that made Stiles\u2019s throat close up when he tried to swallow. \n\u201cYou, with that dagger tonight,\u201d Derek said. \u201cYou looked\u2014\u201d he trailed off, like he didn\u2019t have an answer. \n\u201cRidiculous, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Stiles said. He should have tensed, should throw Derek out, but he didn\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t have the energy. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said quietly. \u201cYou looked like a hero.\u201d\nStiles did tense at that. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t use that word.\u201d \nHe twisted away, meaning to sit up when Derek stilled him with a hand to his chest. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t touch you like that again if you didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Derek said, \u201cand I\u2019ll hold myself to that.\u201d \nHe didn\u2019t say anything else, just looked at Stiles, waiting, watching. \nIf Stiles were a good person, he\u2019d have said no. He\u2019d have told Derek to get out, would have curled up alone under his sheets. If he were a good person, the second Derek was out the door, he would have bought a plane ticket to a Tibetan monastery and not spoken to another human being until he was sure he wasn\u2019t as bad a monster as the one they had killed that night.\nIf Stiles were a good person he wouldn\u2019t have shot his arm out to catch at Derek\u2019s wrist as Derek moved to back up, to hold Derek there. \u201cI do,\u201d he said, trying to give Derek as much wiggle room as he could. \u201cBut only if you do.\u201d\nDerek must have been barely holding onto his self-control because Stiles had only just said the words when Derek was on him, pulling him up, up, up until Stiles\u2019s back was against the pillows. \u201cI always want you,\u201d he was saying roughly, kissing Stiles in frantic bursts. \n\u201cShut up,\u201d Stiles said, abruptly tired of the guilt welling up in his chest and unable to resist. \u201cShut up and get these stupid, ridiculous things off\u201d and he yanked at Derek\u2019s jeans. \nDerek wasn\u2019t helping, was barely cooperative. He didn\u2019t seem to want to stop touching Stiles, to stop kissing him, and Stiles almost couldn\u2019t handle it. He finally got his knee up, got some leverage on the mattress and pushed Derek over. \nDerek was fighting him, protesting, but subsided when Stiles took the extra room to pull his shirt up over his head. His hands were on Stiles immediately, ghosting down over his ribs, tracing a line up his chest. \nStiles couldn\u2019t take the overwhelmed look on Derek\u2019s face. \u201cYour turn,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t wait for Derek to listen, just stripped him. \nDerek let him this time, lifted his hips obligingly when Stiles got his hands back on Derek\u2019s zipper. But once they were both naked, bare in the moonlight, Derek was rolling back over him, pinning his wrists to the mattress. Stiles arched when he lowered his head, licking over and around his nipple before sucking a red mark right under his collarbone.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d he started, lifting his head to stare, and Stiles didn\u2019t want to hear it, didn\u2019t want him to finish the sentence. He was still wound-up, still riding the crest of adrenaline, and he felt like he was racing something, probably the moment when he was going to check back into Logictown.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Stiles said, partly to himself, and partly to Derek. \u201cDon\u2019t, just,\u201d and he hesitated for a second, before pulling his wrists out of Derek\u2019s grasp. \u201cHow about if I blow you?\u201d he said, licking his lips. Derek tracked the movement, a muscle ticking in his jaw. \u201cI\u2019d like it. You could fuck my mouth, you could do anything,\u201d he was babbling but he needed to, needed Derek do something, but he didn\u2019t want to order\u2014couldn\u2019t order him. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d \n\u201cWe have all night,\u201d Derek said, hoarse. \nStiles shook his head. \u201cNo, no, Derek, I need,\u201d and he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence, couldn't think, he just felt brittle, and only held together where Derek was touching him. \n\u201cI know what you need,\u201d Derek said, and he was moving, spreading Stiles's legs wide and shoving the sheets and blankets out of the way. Stiles couldn't take his eyes off him, couldn't look away even as Derek got his hands on Stiles's hips, curled around them tight and sucked him down. \nIt was good that his dad wasn't home and that Mrs. Angleham, whose house bordered their backyard, had a faulty hearing aid, because Stiles yelled. Derek's mouth was hot and wet, and he didn't seem to need oxygen, just took Stiles in and sealed his lips tight around his cock. He could go deep, deeper that Stiles had ever been able to go, in his short, limited experiences, and he wasn't holding back, even a little. \n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles got out, gasping. \u201cYou gotta breathe.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn't want it slow,\u201d Derek pulled off to remind him. He fisted Stiles's cock, flicking his wrist over it like he wasn't wrecking Stiles. \u201cYou're gonna let me, sometime. Let me hold you down, maybe tie you up, and then I'm just going to take my time, and make you scream.\u201d\n\u201cYou're already most of the way there right now,\u201d Stiles said, huffing out a laugh and Derek's eyes darkened. \n\u201cLet's see if I can get all the way there,\u201d he said, and hiked Stiles's legs up over his shoulders, spreading him wide. Stiles yelped when a spit-slick finger touched him, pressed up behind his balls. Derek squeezed his thigh reassuringly, and worked it in, twisting and curling inside him. \nStiles stared at the ceiling, wild and shaking apart, caught between wanting to shove down on Derek's finger, and squirm away, pull Derek up and away from where he felt too spread open, too exposed. But then Derek touched his tongue there, licked around his finger, and the choice was gone. Stiles keened, losing his breath and every nerve ending felt alive under his skin. \nDerek kept going, licking at him, getting him wet and sloppy before slowly, carefully working a second finger in and Stiles felt it, felt his body stretch to accommodate him, but it was still good, he was still so desperately in. Derek's tongue pushed in between his knuckles, like nothing Stiles had ever felt before. He was overwhelmed and overheated, and this, none of this, was what he was expecting. \n\u201cDerek,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou have to do something, you can't just, ah,\u201d he lost the plot for a second, as Derek spit, working his fingers in deeper. \u201cYou could fuck me,\u201d he said, finally. \"I'd let you.\"\n\u201cDo you have anything?\u201d Derek said, and his voice was cracked, like he was affected too, and Stiles was so thrown off by that, he didn't process what Derek was saying for a minute. Then he was moving, twisting out of Derek's grip to fumble through his sock drawer, feeling desperately for the tube he kept in a gym sock. His fingers scrabbled around uselessly, and there was a panicked moment where he thought it was gone, that his dad had chucked it, that he wasn't going to get to have Derek like this. Then he felt the hard edge of the tube and yanked it, almost knocking the whole nightstand over as he did. Derek laughed, a rumbling fond noise and Stiles kicked him as he scooted back into Derek's space. \nDerek took the tube from him and pushed him back down, shoved him open again and put his fingers to Stiles again, this time sliding in with ease, slick and so good. \u201cHave you ever done this?\u201d he said, watching Stiles's face intently as he fucked him with two fingers. \n\u201cI'm seventeen,\u201d Stiles said, curling his hands into the sheets. \u201cI've gotten myself off every way I know how.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone else?\u201d Derek said, and he punctuated his question with a wicked twist to his fingers. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cIsn't it bad manners to ask me about my sexual history?\u201d Stiles asked, his voice reedy and unsteady. \nDerek gave him another finger, fitting it in beside the others. Stiles struggled to draw a breath, feeling fuller than he had even been, like he was going to bust out of his own skin. Derek\u2019s shoulder was sweaty where his leg was hooked over it and he had to struggle to hold on, to keep it there. \n \u201cHas Ryan seen you like this, Stiles?\u201d Derek said, urgently, squeezing his thigh a shade too tight. \u201cHas he?\u201d\nStiles managed a laugh. \u201cHow the hell do you know his name?\u201d he said. \u201cYou big weirdo creep.\u201d He wasn't going to answer, wasn't going to give Derek the satisfaction. \nDerek ignored that. \u201cHe wouldn't know what to do with you like this,\u201d he murmured, watching where his fingers were buried deep in Stiles. \u201cWouldn't have any clue.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you do?\u201d Stiles asked, smirking at him. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek said, and slid a fourth finger in. \nStiles howled, jerking against Derek's grip, mouth open and gasping helplessly. \u201cFuck,\u201d he grit out. \u201cShit, Derek, my God, you total ass,\u201d and he wanted to come, wanted this over, wanted this to never end. \n\u201cI warned you,\u201d Derek said, unrepentantly. \u201cI told you I wanted to make you scream.\u201d He flexed his fingers experimentally. \u201cI bet I could make you come just like this.\u201d\nStiles was lost, was barely verbal, couldn\u2019t answer him if his life depended on it. His whole world had narrowed to where Derek was holding him open, and he writhed on it, begging, pleading for what exactly, he didn\u2019t know.\nBut then he did know, because Derek bent, took Stiles\u2019s cock back in his mouth and sucked him down, until Stiles could feel the flutter at the back of his throat. At the same time, he moved his wrist just so he brushed against Stiles\u2019s prostate, and that was it, game over. Stiles was coming, harder than he ever had, to the point where he didn\u2019t know if he was going to ever come down. \nHe did eventually, opened his eyes, and found Derek over him, his wrist frantically moving over his cock, pupils blown. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, croakily. \u201cLet me do something, get up here, let me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Derek said, wrecked. \u201cI have to\u2014\u201d and then he was shooting all over Stiles, striping his hip and stomach. \n\u201cGross,\u201d Stiles said, satisfied and staring at the mess. Derek rolled his eyes, but got up, snagging the towel off the back of the door, and wiped him up, but Stiles couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was just rubbing it in. \nThen Derek was manhandling him over and around until he was half draped over his chest, Derek\u2019s hand warm and possessive on the nape of his neck. \n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d Stiles said, turning his face to scrape his teeth against Derek\u2019s breastbone. \u201cMy dad will be home at some point, and I\u2019m not in the mood to make up an elaborate story about my friend Pogo the runaway circus wolf.\u201d\nDerek tugged on his ear. \u201cI have no idea why I like you.\u201d \nHe said it with affection, clearly meant nothing by it, but it was a cold slap in the face, effectively shaking off Stiles\u2019s afterglow. Stiles picked up his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know at all?\u201d he said, aiming for casual, but his voice was unsteady.\n\u201cI'm just drawn here against my will like a magnet,\u201d Derek said, body loose and relaxed. \nStiles was up and off the bed in the next second. \u201cGet out,\u201d he said.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek said, sitting up in alarm. \n\u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d Stiles said, stomach rolling and heaving. He couldn\u2019t puke until Derek left. He had to keep it together until then. \u201cI need you to go.\u201d\nDerek was off the bed and walking towards him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re tired, it\u2019s been a long day. Come lay down, I won\u2019t, we don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, and he was yelling. \u201cGod, no, don\u2019t touch me, you can\u2019t be here, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d and he covered his mouth to hide the gasp of a panic attack lurking right around the corner.\n\u201cGoddamnit Stiles,\u201d Derek snapped, his claws reflexively shrinking and sharpening, over and over. \u201cWhen are you going to stop fucking with my head?\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d Stiles said, and his voice was shaking. \u201cRight now. Get out and don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek said, and as suddenly as he lost it, he was in control again. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning to take you to Deaton\u2019s.\u201d His voice was even, but Stiles could hear the underlying threat of what would happen if Stiles didn\u2019t cooperate in the morning.\n\u201cI'll call Scott,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cJust go.\u201d \nDerek left, slamming the window behind him. Stiles stayed awake all night, sitting guard over his own treacherous, monstrous mind. \n*\nStiles didn\u2019t want Scott in his bedroom, locked the window and waited for him outside on the steps. Scott could be oblivious, mostly, but at the worst times he often sharpened, and Stiles couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than the disappointment in Scott\u2019s eyes when he realized what Stiles had done. \nHe shivered, even though it wasn\u2019t cold, and waited, watching for Scott, tucked up as small as he could make himself. \nWhen Scott got there, he leapt off his bike, and was hurtling towards Stiles, pulling him in as close and tight as he could. Stiles exhaled and held on, taking the reassurance that he probably didn\u2019t deserve, but couldn\u2019t resist. \nScott finally let him go, and his face was bright and happy. \u201cWe survived again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said, mustering up a smile. \u201cThanks for watching my dad\u2019s back.\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Scott said, and snagged the Jeep\u2019s keys from Stiles. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to Deaton.\u201d \nHe was glad Deaton took him into the operating room, instead of his office. It had only been about three weeks since the last time Stiles had been at the clinic with Derek for one of their Saturdays, cracking jokes and kicking each other. It seemed about as far away from him now as anything could be. Stiles didn\u2019t feel like laughing, and if anyone kicked him now, he\u2019d probably shatter into deeply pathetic pieces. \nDeaton examined the cut. \u201cThe dagger was enchanted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not deep, and I have salves, though it\u2019s not going to feel especially good.\u201d\n\u201cYippee,\u201d Stiles said and hopped up on the exam table.\nThere wasn\u2019t any movement, but Stiles was suddenly, completely sure Derek was there. He didn\u2019t know how, but he knew. A moment later, Scott stiffened, and Stiles knew he was right. \n\u201cMr. Hale,\u201d Deaton said pleasantly, uncapping a weird-looking bottle. \n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Scott said rudely. \n\u201cI wanted to make sure Stiles got here,\u201d Derek said, and when Stiles looked up, he wasn\u2019t looking at Scott, his eyes were trained right on him. Stiles flinched, and Derek\u2019s face hardened, and they both looked away. \nScott looked at both of them, eyebrows drawing together in concern. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did.\u201d His phone dinged, and he looked down. \n\u201cAllison?\u201d Stiles asked. \n\u201cMy mom,\u201d Scott said. He looked at Stiles. \u201cYou okay if I leave you with him?\u201d he said, eyes flicking towards Derek. \nStiles wasn\u2019t okay with Derek there, but not because Stiles was in any danger. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cGo. Toss me my keys.\u201d\nScott slid them across the table beside him, and left, shutting the door quietly behind him.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Deaton said, drawing his attention back to the problem at hand. Stiles nodded, and held his breath as Deaton applied the salve. \nNot feeling especially good was the understatement of the year. His skin tingled and itched so much it felt like he wanted to claw it off his body. He started to squirm but Deaton fixed him with a look, so he held still, biting deep into his lip. \n\u201cTalk,\u201d Derek said finally, edging closer to him, arms folded across his chest. \nStiles snorted, trying desperately to sound normal, amused. \u201cFirst time you\u2019ve said that,\u201d he cracked.\nDerek didn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cIt\u2019ll distract you,\u201d he said. \nStiles huffed. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will distract me.\u201d Derek stepped even closer, as if to offer comfort, but Stiles shied back, earning himself a glare from Deaton. \nDerek\u2019s face reflected the briefest moment of hurt for a moment before he gained control again. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, gritting his teeth. \n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Stiles said, knocked unsteady once again by the boatloads of guilt he was just barely keeping at bay. \nDeaton finished tying off the bandage, and then released Stiles\u2019s hand. \u201cKeep it dry and covered until tomorrow,\u201d he advised. Turning his attention to Derek, he surveyed him carefully. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\nDerek startled. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have healed anyway.\u201d\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Deaton said, and Stiles couldn\u2019t tell if he was agreeing or disagreeing. \u201cI\u2019ve long been curious about that jacket of yours,\u201d he said, unexpectedly. \u201cMay I see it for a moment?\u201d\nDerek shrugged it off without a word, handing it to Deaton. It was the old one, the one Stiles had mended for him. Deaton examined it, and Stiles watched as he sought out the stitching where Stiles had sown it back together. \u201cI see. Just as I suspected,\u201d Deaton said, giving it back to Derek. \u201cSomeone cast a very powerful protection charm on it.\u201d\n\u201cI bought it new in town last year,\u201d Derek said, bewildered.\n\u201cI\u2019d be very surprised by that. See, it\u2019s woven in right here,\u201d Deaton said, touching Stiles\u2019s work. \u201cThat kind of work, a charm that can last for a long time like that, it feeds off intense emotion. It can\u2019t be done without a great deal of love.\u201d\nStiles stopped breathing. Derek went tense and stiff immediately, eyes snapping to Stiles. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d he started, but Stiles was already hopping down and making for the door.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Derek snarled, hooking Stiles by the hood and dragging him back. Stiles fought to wiggle free, thinking desperately, Nope, can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t, I need to hide, I need him to let me go and the hoodie he was wearing was warm suddenly, burning against his skin. Derek let go with a yelp, and Stiles flung himself away, crowding against the edge of the wall. He was breathing heavily, the air feeling like it wasn\u2019t quite making it to his lungs. \n\u201cStiles, get back here,\u201d Derek roared, and he was reaching blindly through the air, but he wasn\u2019t even close to where Stiles was, and after a minute, Derek was out the door, still calling for him. \n\u201cPerhaps you want to come take a seat over here with me,\u201d Deaton said gently, as if whatever Stiles chose to do was of no consequence to him. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles said wretchedly, face twisting up. He was possibly going to cry. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d Deaton said, and he patted the chair again. Stiles trudged over, and flopped gracelessly into it. \n\u201cI tried to control it,\u201d he said, guilty and awful. \u201cI tried to stop, I didn\u2019t mean to make him feel\u2014but he was always around and I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d\nDeaton paused. \u201cWhen you say \u2018made him feel\u2019,\u201d he said delicately. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d\nThis was the moment. He just had to say it, even if Deaton called whatever the magical police were on him. He deserved it. \u201cI made him want me,\u201d he said, and swallowed past the lump in his throat. \u201cI made him want me like I can make everything else happen. I\u2019m no better than that guy he killed last night, I made Derek like that, like a golem. It isn\u2019t real, whatever he thinks it is. None of it is real.\u201d\nThere was a moment of shocked silence, and Stiles could feel his eyes blurring with tears. \nDeaton\u2019s hand closed, gentle and warm, on Stiles\u2019s shoulder. Stiles\u2019s head snapped up in disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand,\u201d Stiles said, strangled. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Deaton said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. Your magic cannot alter free will.\u201d\nStiles felt his heart stop. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right,\u201d he whispered. \n\u201cI promise you it is,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cIf anyone has done wrong here, it\u2019s me. I continue to underestimate you and what you can do, Mr. Stilinski, and you should have known something like that from the beginning. Perhaps I should be be apologizing to you. But in any case, you could no more force Derek to feel something than he could force you.\u201d \n\u201cBut that means,\u201d Stiles said and trailed off, and his eyes fell on the jacket again, thrown haphazardly over the exam table.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Deaton said, and patted him twice. \u201cI\u2019m going to make us some coffee. This amount of teenage melodrama is exhausting.\u201d\n*\nEventually, he had left the clinic, had gotten back in the Jeep and had driven off, headed nowhere and barely seeing the road. \nHe ended up at the lacrosse field, sitting on the deserted bench, looking out over the empty field. A year and a half ago, this was his biggest concern. A year and a half ago, this was all he had to look forward to. \nHis phone rang, and Stiles didn\u2019t have to look to know it was Scott\u2019s eerie sense of Stilesradar. \n\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI had sex with Derek last night.\u201d\nThere was a moment of dead silence and then Scott was fake-retching in his ear. Stiles grinned and waited him out. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the grossest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cHim? Really?\u201d\n\u201cHim,\u201d Stiles agreed. \u201cReally.\u201d \nScott made a pained noise. \u201cBut he\u2019s Derek. He\u2019s the worst. Remember we even made that list once?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said. He might still have it in a notebook somewhere. \u201cI think I\u2019m prepared to move Richard Simmons higher up.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re broken,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re possessed.\u201d \n\u201cScott,\u201d Stiles interrupted. \u201cI think he\u2019s my Allison.\u201d He overrode Scott\u2019s howls of outrage. \u201cIt\u2019s just, he\u2019s pretty funny. Actually funny, like, dude\u2019s got jokes. And he does care about stuff, and helping people. He was just bad at it for awhile.\u201d\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Scott said, still sounding miffed. \n\u201cAnd he likes me,\u201d Stiles said, quietly. It was the first time he\u2019d said it out loud, without the familiar punch of guilt to his chest. \n \u201cDuh,\u201d Scott said, as if everyone would. \u201cSo why have you been moping?\u201d\nStiles took a deep breath and told him. It was easier this time, than at Deaton\u2019s, and Scott listened quietly until the last part, the greatest part, the \u201cI didn\u2019t actually do anything part.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d Scott said, when he was done. \u201cYou don\u2019t always have to be so alone.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d \nWhen he hung up, he felt lighter, freer for having confessed. Even in his darkest moments, he hadn\u2019t really believed Scott would hate him, couldn\u2019t see Scott giving up on him, but it made him feel brighter and stronger for having that confirmed. \nThere was only one more person left to talk to, and he sat there for another hour, trying desperately to work up the courage for that conversation. \nHe had only just made the decision to seek Derek out, to track him down, when the little tingle in his chest let him know that the decision was out of his hands. Derek had found him, and moments later, slid onto the bench next to him. \n\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles said, heartbeat kicking up.\n\u201cBeen looking for you,\u201d Derek returned evenly. \u201cYou were a little hard to track down.\u201d\nStiles cringed. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just needed time.\u201d\n\u201cI eventually went back to the clinic,\u201d Derek said, \u201cwhen I couldn\u2019t track you down. You weren\u2019t there, so I checked your house, and you weren\u2019t there either, so I figured I\u2019d go threaten Scott. But he was on the phone.\u201d\nStiles\u2019s heart leapt into his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to teach him to be more aware of his surroundings,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Derek said. \u201cHe knew I was there. You know how I know? Because after he hung up, he leaned out of the window and said \u2018he\u2019s at the lacrosse field, asshole,\u2019 and then listed the body parts he\u2019d cut off if I hurt you.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s my Scott,\u201d Stiles said, fighting the urge to panic. \u201cSo you heard all of it then? What I thought I did?\u201d\nDerek scoffed. \u201cThat you thought you were mind-controlling me and that\u2019s why you kept shoving me away? Yeah, I heard.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound too concerned for your mental autonomy or anything,\u201d Stiles said, kicking his feet hard against the dirt.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Derek said, but didn\u2019t elaborate. \nStiles pressed him, in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re not at all worried about the idea that you could have been acting on feelings I forced you to have for me?\u201d\nDerek shrugged. \nStiles pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes. \u201cSo in summary, today I found out after literally weeks of torturing myself, that I haven\u2019t been making someone I want want me back against his will, essentially making him a slave of my whims, but if I had, he\u2019d totally be okay with it.\u201d\n\u201cOut of the two of us, only one of us is qualified to make the big decisions and it ain\u2019t me,\u201d Derek quoted, and Stiles flushed at the memory. \n\u201cYou\u2019re taking that out of context,\u201d he said. \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it less true,\u201d Derek said.\nStiles couldn\u2019t stifle his laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re insane. I\u2019m dating a crazy person.\u201d Derek sucked in a breath and only then Stiles heard what he had said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said right away. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to still\u2014I thought now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI could have told you that you hadn\u2019t forced me into anything,\u201d Derek said, cutting him off. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just want. I\u2019m pretty head over heels for you and I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014I think I\u2019d know now if it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d Derek swallowed convulsively, looking away for a second. \u201cBut there\u2019s still good reasons not to date me. You picked a stupid fake one, but there are real ones that are good enough. I thought of all of them last night after you threw me \u2014after.\u201d Stiles winced, and Derek shook his head. \u201cYou can still say no,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cJust because what I feel is real doesn\u2019t mean you have to say yes.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said, breathless and overcome. \u201cIt kind of does.\u201d It occurred to him then that it had been Derek every time, closing the distance between them, initiating everything. He changed that then, turning and sliding a thigh over Derek\u2019s thighs until he was straddling Derek\u2019s lap. Derek spread his legs to better support Stiles, but when Stiles leaned in to kiss him, he stopped him, one hand in the center of his chest. \n\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Stiles,\u201d he said. \u201cBirdhouse this. You have to think about it so you\u2019re sure. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t keep doing this, thinking I\u2019m getting somewhere, that you feel the same and then having you change your mind, having you take it all back again. I want you, but you can\u2019t keep,\u201d and he trailed off, frustrated.\nStiles was going to have to be earnest. Fuck, he hated that. \u201cI thought I was making you,\u201d he said, slow and steady. \u201cAnd I know you think that was dumb, but I don\u2019t think you understand what it means. It means I thought about you. A lot. I pictured what you would say, what you would do, how you would touch me if I ever got up the nerve. I touched myself thinking about you, constantly,\u201d and Derek squirmed underneath him. Stiles inhaled at the contact, but kept going. \u201cI looked at you, and I wanted you, so much that the wanting had passed out of my brain and into yours. Do you get that? Do you understand now?\u201d \n Derek looked up at him, his eyes dark and pupils blown. \u201cI\u2019m saying yes,\u201d Stiles said, cupping his jaw lightly, pressing until Derek\u2019s head tilted up. Derek let him, eyes fixed intently on Stiles. Stiles met his gaze straight on, and repeated himself one last time. \u201cYes.\u201d"
