    "summary": "<p>The law is clear: whoever correctly answers three riddles will marry the prince, while all who fail are to be executed. The people live in fear as more challengers try and fail, and the throne grows bloodier with every passing year. But a young prince, nameless and in exile from his home, believes there may be more to this brutal challenge than meets the eye. </p>\n<p>Of course, there's only one way to find out: ring the gong, and take the trial.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>I won't say too much, for fear of spoiling anyone who's not in the know, but I offer a tip of the hat to everyone who \"gets it.\"</p>\n<p>Either way, I hope you all enjoy!</p>\n<p>I did not expect to get art for this story, but I did, and I am <a href=\"https://biteitwhenitssoft.tumblr.com/post/160464713460/me-hm-pitvipers-fics-inspire-so-much-there-are-so\" rel=\"nofollow\">laughing my ass off</a> you guys.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope you all have enjoyed this BNHA remix of Giacomo Puccini's final opera, Turandot.</p>\n<p>...Yup! That was the joke! It's an opera, guys! It's an Italian romantic opera!</p>\n<p>Specifically, the opera where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFUM4Uh_6Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">this little tune</a> is from. If you don't recognize the story, you might recognize its most famous aria.</p>\n<p>Now obviously, EXTREME liberties were taken, on account of all the misogyny, Orientalism, and severe protagonist-centered morality in the source material, as well as the fact that Puccini never actually finished the darned thing before he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1924. A few of you asked me if I made the riddles myself, and the answer to that is, sort of! I came up with the rhyme scheme, took elements from the original phrasing in the opera, and sort of re-wrote them. Besides that, I took an absolute shitbag of liberties with pretty much everything, and I hope Puccini's not rolling in his grave too much. Or, yaknow, maybe he was really into Orientalism and misogyny, in which case roll away, Giacomo!</p>\n<p>In any case, I had the time of my LIFE writing this, and I hope you guys have enjoyed reading it at least as much as I've enjoyed making it.</p>",
    "text": "The sun was low in the sky, and the streets on the outskirts of the city were quiet. The people who lived here were those that kept their heads down, minded their own business, and did their best not to draw attention to themselves.\nThis mattered little to the young man racing through the streets, feet aching as they pounded the stones. His breath was short but he was not yet winded, the pressure in his lungs not quite a burning.\nHe threw a quick glance over his shoulder, and slowed his pace when he saw that his pursuers were beginning to lag behind. Losing them now was no good\u2014if they gave up, they might go back to hunting the others.\nThe runner\u2019s luck ran dry when he spotted an alley and turned the corner, only to find the way blocked by a stone wall. Cursing under his breath, he skidded to a halt and raced back to the open street, but his pursuers had caught him up. A sword flashed in the light of the sunset, and he leaped backward, narrowly missing death but retreating further into the alley.\nIn a heartbeat, the assassins were upon him. There were four, and then the first was too eager and all but fell upon the runner\u2019s sword blade in his reckless charge. Their would-be victim was small and outnumbered, but his blade was quick and his eyes were quicker. What should have been a slaughter was drawn out as the young man dodged and parried. A dagger flew through the air at him, grazing his temple before it struck the opposite wall and clattered to the ground. One of his attackers swung a curved blade at his head, and he ducked beneath the man\u2019s arm and slid his own sword between the assassin\u2019s ribs. The man drew back with a grunt, swinging once more as he died. His victim was quick, but not quite quick enough, and the blade bit deep into his shoulder.\nCrying out, he barely managed to switch his sword to his other hand in time to block the next strike. One of his attackers darted in and scored another dagger across his chest, a wounding blow but no less painful. The runner sprang back again, retreating until his back hit the stone wall that blocked off the alley.\nTriumph shone in the dagger wielder\u2019s eyes, and he charged with a yell, ready to swing his knife and cut the wounded one\u2019s throat. In a burst of speed, the runner twisted out of the way, and what would have been a fatal stab to the heart sank into his side and missed anything vital. He kicked out viciously, and the assassin\u2019s leg snapped out from under him. With a cry of pain, the injured young man swung his sword in a blow that nearly beheaded his would-be killer.\nWhen he looked up, blinking against the blood that threatened to run into his eyes, he found his last pursuer poised to finish him off. His head swam dizzily\u2014he had lost a great deal of blood already. He drew in a sharp breath, gripped his sword in one hand, and let a lightning storm of energy fill him from toe to tip.\nPower crackled along his skin. A burst of speed took him straight past his final attacker. It was simply a matter of positioning his sword as he moved\u2014at the speed he was going, he ran the assassin through the belly before the latter had the chance to take his head off.\nWith a grunt, he let the sword slip from his hands. The body slumped limply to the ground alongside the others, and the wounded runner staggered away and nearly tripped over another body. Blood ran into one of his eyes, half-blinding him, and he limped to the mouth of the alley and looked around.\nThe streets were still empty. The young man took stock of his injuries\u2014a small gash along his hairline, a deeper cut in one shoulder, a cut across his ribs, and a hole where a dagger blade had punctured his side. He needed a quiet place to patch himself up. This alley wouldn\u2019t do; if someone happened upon him while he was surrounded by corpses, that could mean trouble. And besides\u2014these four might not have been alone.\nHe needed to get out.\nThe young man crept out into the open street, keeping close to the walls of buildings. Gritting his teeth, he limped along as fast as he could until he had left the blood-strewn alley behind. One arm he clamped around his chest, in an attempt to stem the bleeding and keep his wounds from leaving a blood trail.\nAt last, when he had judged the distance safe, he found another narrow side street and staggered into the shadows. Gingerly he sank down to the ground, biting back noises of pain as each movement pulled at his wounds. He settled himself down in a pile of rags, tucked behind an empty crate in the hopes that it would hide him.\nHe just needed to rest. Just a moment to rest, and bind his wounds, and then he would go out again and rejoin his companions.\nHis head still swam with the dizziness of blood loss as he tore strips from his ragged jacket and sought to stem the bleeding. The wounds to his shoulder and side were the deepest; the gash to his chest was long but merely a flesh wound, and the cut on his head was little more than a scratch.\nThe young man lost track of how long he sat there, catching his breath and tending his wounds as best he could. His throat was parched, his stomach empty, leaving him faint and clouded. Because of that, it was only when a shadow fell over him that he realized he was no longer alone.\nHe drew back against the wall, reaching for a sword that was no longer there\u2014he\u2019d left it sheathed in a dead man\u2019s stomach. Bracing himself, he stared defiantly up at the figure above him. Tall and cloaked, their face hidden in a cowl, the newcomer held up a hand.\n\u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d A cool voice, quiet and mellow, halted the injured young man\u2019s alarm for a moment. Stepping forward, the cloaked figure knelt down so that they\u2014he, by the sound of it\u2014no longer loomed over him. \u201cWho attacked you?\u201d\n\u201cNobody,\u201d the young man said shortly, thinking fast. If this man turned out to be a threat, then he could still use his power. He couldn\u2019t very well fight, but he could escape. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Please leave me.\u201d\n\u201cAt least let me take you to a healer,\u201d the cloaked man said. \u201cYou look half dead.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d was the mulish reply. It wasn\u2019t untrue; he had come within inches of death just by walking out his front door, all those weeks ago.\n\u201cBe that as it may.\u201d Were his ears playing tricks on him, or did the man in the cloak sound amused? \u201cI can hardly leave someone lying injured in an alley. Can you even walk?\u201d\n\u201cI can walk.\u201d The runner sounded almost offended.\n\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d The hooded stranger rose back to his feet. \u201cJust come with me.\u201d\nThe runner hesitated, weighing his options. He wished he had a better view of this other man\u2019s face, but the hood obscured it. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said at last, and struggled to sit up. Without thinking, he reached upward with a silent request.\nThe cloaked figure hesitated, but after a moment he reached back as well to help him to his feet. His hand was cold, and he let go as soon as the injured one was standing.\nTheir pace was haltingly slow, hampered by the runner\u2019s weakness. He bore it stoically, gritting his teeth against pain and dizziness, but finally he stumbled and nearly fell. His benefactor caught him by the elbow to steady him, and drew back his hand as quickly as he could.\n\u201cNearly there,\u201d he said, and walked on again.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the injured one murmured. \u201cEr, where exactly is \u2018there\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have somewhere more pressing to be than a healer?\u201d\n\u201cEr. Sort of.\u201d His already uneven steps faltered. \u201cThe men who attacked me\u2014I was luring them away from my friends. I need to find them again, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re no use to them dead.\u201d The hooded man slowed. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\nThe injured young man followed him to the front of a small building that smelled strongly of herbs and plants. After a brief knock, the door opened to reveal a tiny old woman whose head barely reached above either man\u2019s waist. Her eyes widened at the sight of them. Her knees bent, and she began to lower herself.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d the hooded man said flatly.\n\u201cOh\u2014right. Bring him inside.\u201d She opened the door wider to admit them. The injured one limped in, but his hooded companion lingered at the door and pressed a small handful of coins into the old woman\u2019s hand.\n\u201cFor your services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd your silence.\u201d With that, he turned away.\n\u201cW-wait!\u201d the younger man called out. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly\u2014you\u2014\u201d But the other was already gone.\n\u201cNo use fussing,\u201d the old woman advised. \u201cHe does this from time to time. Have a seat now.\u201d\nReluctantly, her patient sank into the chair she indicated with a grunt of pain. \u201cDidn\u2019t ask him to pay for me.\u201d\n\u201cCan you pay for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cW-well, I-I mean,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money, but\u2026\u201d\nShe tsk\u2019ed lightly at him. \u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019re just going to have to endure this cold, cruel random act of charity.\u201d\nThe young man looked away.\nHe could feel the old woman\u2019s gaze on him as she peeled back his shirt to inspect his injuries. \u201cProud one, are we?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being a burden to anyone,\u201d he said awkwardly. \u201cEspecially if it means complete strangers having to drag me half-dead out of an alley and vanishing before I can properly say thank you.\u201d\nThe old woman paused just long enough to give him an odd look. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t know who it was who just helped you, do you?\u201d\n\u201cShould I?\u201d he asked, bewildered. \u201cI\u2019m a stranger here. I\u2019ve only just arrived.\u201d\n\u201cHm. I suppose not, then. Hold still, dear, this will only take a minute or two.\u201d\nIt was not quite dawn on the following day when a bell tolled from the highest tower of the palace.\nThe young runner, fully healed but unarmed, slowed to a halt and looked toward the noise, head cocked to one side curiously. He wasn\u2019t far from the palace hill, but the ringing of the bell was deep and thunderous enough to reach even the edges of the city. The tones were low and sonorous, suspiciously like funeral bells.\nHis heart sank with dread. Was someone in this kingdom\u2019s royal family ill, or worse? Besides being a great misfortune, that might well be ill news for his own mission, as well. Curious, he glanced around to see how the people in the streets reacted.\nEven more curious. Rather than look to the sound of the bell, everyone within his sight simply lowered their heads and walked faster. Murmurs reached his ears, none of them loud enough to be understood.\nHe frowned thoughtfully. There were\u2026 odd rumors, coming from this kingdom. Perhaps this had something to do with them.\nA thought struck him then. The ringing bell might arouse his companions\u2019 curiosity as well as his. And if they went to investigate\u2026\nEver hopeful, he changed his course and set out toward the palace. Few others were traveling in this direction; most of the people here seemed eager to keep their heads down and ignore the tolling bell. He quickened his pace to a light trot, ears pricked for trouble. There could be more enemies about, and this time he wouldn\u2019t have a sword to defend himself.\nThe bell had gone silent by the time he neared the city center. It was an uphill walk; the city itself was clustered around a low hill, at the very top of which stood the palace, which could be seen from anywhere in the surrounding city. Craning his neck to see it, he sped up again. After turning another corner, he dropped his gaze to watch where he was going.\nThe streets opened up to a massive square at the foot of the palace hill. It was, in a word, beautiful. The stones of the street were intricately carved and well-polished, broken here and there by fine wooden boxes from which ornamental trees grew. A fountain shot water from the mouth of a pale stone fish, surrounded by statues of animals real and imaginary that reared or lay couchant. A stone wall surrounded the foot of the hill, broken only by a gilded gate at the foot of the wide path that led up to the palace proper. A pair of stone lions sat at either side of it, mouths open as if roaring. Not far from the gate stood a single stone arch with a gong hanging from it.\nAt this point, the square was fairly packed. A large crowd had moved in toward the gate, and it was only getting larger by the second. The stranger found himself shoved roughly a few times as more denizens of the city pushed toward the front. There was an air of excitement about them, but also one of tension and\u2026 fear?\nA loud, booming voice pitched itself above the hum of the crowd. \u201cMake way!\u201d\nAt the cry, the stranger\u2019s head whipped around to look, eyes wide. He craned his neck, but his height had never been his strong point.\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, make way!\u201d the voice came again. \u201cCan\u2019t you see this man is blind!\u201d\n\u201cWatch it, you\u2019ll trample him!\u201d The second voice was higher-pitched, almost piercing.\nSticking out his elbows, the young man bulled his way through the crowd, following the voices but not daring to answer back. He craned his neck, searching desperately, and finally spotted them\u2014three figures hemmed in by the excited townsfolk. The tallest, a rail-thin man with blond hair and bandages wrapped around his eyes, had stumbled and fallen, and his two younger companions were struggling to shield him from the crowd.\nSomeone shoved the young man\u2019s back, sending him crashing into the taller of the two protectors, a bespectacled man in a battered breastplate. The man rounded on him, mouth open to shout him off, but their eyes met. The desperation on the armored one\u2019s face gave way to relief.\n\u201cYour Hi\u2014\u201d\nThe shorter man meant to cover the other\u2019s mouth with his hand, but misjudged the distance and ended up awkwardly smacking his chin instead. \u201cS-sorry! Sorry, just\u2014not so loud, Iida.\u201d He struggled past him to where the blind man was struggling to rise with the help of the girl attending him. \u201cF-father!\u201d he called, careful not to shout too loudly. \u201cFather, reach for my hand!\u201d The older man whipped his head around at the sound of his voice, and reached a shaking hand toward him. The younger caught hold of it and helped steady him on his feet.\n\u201cI-is that you?\u201d The blind man pulled his son toward him, reaching out with his free hand to touch him. \u201cMy boy, we\u2019ve been looking everywhere\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can catch up later!\u201d the girl said urgently. \u201cIida, can you clear a path\u2014owch!\u201d Her head jerked forward when someone elbowed it as they passed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not that far from the edge, but the crowd\u2019s getting bigger,\u201d the young man told them, still clinging to his father. \u201cIida, head back the way I came\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMake room for them!\u201d A new voice cut through the air, clear and cold. Except\u2014it wasn\u2019t a new voice at all. It was quite familiar, in fact.\nTo the young man\u2019s surprise, the crowd did part a little, and he wasted no time in pulling his father into the open space. A familiar hooded figure emerged into view, striding purposefully through the throng until he reached the young man\u2019s side and passed him.\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d he said, more quietly. \u201cI can lead you out of this crowd.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the young man replied, guiding his father along in his wake. The girl beside him hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I think. Just follow him.\u201d Iida joined them, and they formed a protective barrier around their blind charge.\nUnfortunately, the crowd was a large one, and not everyone got the message. A few men, seeing the opening but not its cause, rushed out and nearly bowled them over.\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d Iida warned them. \u201cCan\u2019t you see we\u2019re trying to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPiss off,\u201d one of them snapped contemptuously. \u201cIf you\u2019re not here for the beheading, then get out of the damned way or\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off; the cloaked one was back, and the rough man\u2019s face was quickly draining of color.\nThe hood was still up, but in the jostling crowd it had been pulled back, revealing a young face with mismatched eyes, one so dark that it was nearly black, and one pale blue. A rough scar marred the blue-eyed side of his face, and the hair that framed it was split red and white. At the sight of that face, much of the closest crowd drew back further.\nHe halted before the speaker, apparently heedless of the fact that the man stood at least half a head taller than him. \u201cYou know damned well that the beheading doesn\u2019t happen until the sun is rising, fool.\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you so eager to see another execution that you would trample over a blind old man for a place at the front?\u201d the scarred man asked coldly. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time left for you to bully your way forward.\u201d\nCowed, the man and his companions retreated back to the crowd, leaving the little group to escape the rush.\nAt the edge of the square, the young man kept his hand on his father\u2019s arm as they caught up to their strange helper. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve come to my aid,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you. If there\u2019s anything I can do to repay you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s help you need,\u201d the other cut him off. \u201cThen help yourselves by leaving this city, and this kingdom. I can see that you\u2019re strangers here, and I can tell you that this isn\u2019t the sort of place you want to be.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d The words had barely left the young man\u2019s mouth when the other man turned away and vanished back into the crowd.\n\u201cOdd fellow,\u201d Iida remarked. \u201cAre you all right, Uraraka? I saw someone strike you in the crowd.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d she replied.\nThe young man was about to speak when his father pulled him into a crushing hug that belied his gaunt frame. Relief flooded him as he returned the embrace with all his strength.\n\u201cI thought my heart would break, when Iida told me you had run away to draw off our attackers,\u201d his father whispered. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t come back by nightfall, I thought we\u2019d lost you.\u201d\n\u201cThat was foolish of you,\u201d Iida spoke up severely. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of job you leave to myself or Uraraka\u2014you\u2019re far too important, Your Highness.\u201d He dropped his voice to a whisper at the end.\n\u201cYou\u2019re important, too.\u201d The young prince pulled back to face his two friends. \u201cBoth of you. And don\u2019t worry about me\u2014I don\u2019t intend on throwing my life away pointlessly. I took a calculated risk, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cStill.\u201d His father felt his way to his face. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re all right, Iz\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSshh!\u201d the young man hissed. He glanced around quickly, but luckily no one seemed to be within earshot. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t use my name, or yours. We don\u2019t know if those men were alone. And besides, we\u2019re technically in enemy territory here.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Iida said, his voice subdued for once. \u201cThe men who sacked our city and drove us into exile could have ears everywhere. And\u2026\u201d He shot a quick glance toward the palace on the hill. \u201cKing Enji has never been a friend to you, Your Maj\u2014er. Ahem.\u201d\n\u201cAll right then\u2014Deku,\u201d Uraraka said briskly. \u201cWhat\u2019s our next move?\u201d\n\u201cKeep a low profile, for now,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cThe men that attacked us are\u2026 well.\u201d His stomach turned. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice, but\u2026\u201d\nHis father squeezed his shoulder gently. \u201cI\u2019d rather have you alive, my boy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI know. Um. Anyway.\u201d Deku shook himself. \u201cHopefully, the fact that you laid out, Iida, will be an advantage. We\u2019ve been in conflict with Enji\u2019s kingdom for years. If the assassins who tracked us this far are dead, then maybe no one else will think to look for us here. It should give us time to regroup. Find allies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd maybe\u2014maybe, if we\u2019re careful,\u201d his father added. \u201cWe might get word back to Aizawa that we still live.\u201d He paused, and his sightless face turned briefly in the direction of the hill. \u201cIf it comes to it, I can seek an audience with Enji himself.\u201d\n\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Uraraka asked.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous,\u201d the blind king admitted. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t help us for free. But if things become truly desperate, I will pay any price for a chance to save our kingdom.\u201d\nThe bell tolled again.\nA cry of anticipation went up among the crowd, and the four foreigners turned simultaneously to see what the fuss was about. The sun was rising over the hill.\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Uraraka muttered.\n\u201cA beheading, apparently,\u201d Iida replied distastefully. His voice dropped further in volume. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t have to entreat this kingdom for aid. I don\u2019t trust a place that treats death as entertainment.\u201d\nThe front gates of the palace were opening. To the side of them, not far from the foot of the wall, was a stone platform. As the crowd watched, a man was led out in chains and marched up to the platform, where he was forced to his knees.\nThe palace hill was not a high one, and even from the distance Deku could see the man\u2019s face. It was odd\u2014that didn\u2019t look like the face of a man that had committed a crime punishable by death.\n\u201cPoor wretch,\u201d Iida muttered. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nThey were at the edge of the crowd, and the nearest spectator turned his head to look at Iida with a bitter smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d\nSurreptitiously, Uraraka reached out to give Iida a sharp warning nudge.\n\u201cFailed the prince\u2019s challenge, is what he\u2019s done,\u201d the man went on, eyes narrowed scornfully. \u201cHis own fault, if you ask me. Everyone knows it\u2019s impossible, and the punishment for failure is death.\u201d He turned back to the spectacle. \u201cThe prince should be out shortly to watch the execution.\u201d\nIt took a few minutes\u2014up on the platform, the condemned man knelt and watched the crowd, and the executioner sharpened his ax. Eventually, a cry went up from the crowd.\n\u201cRight on schedule,\u201d the spectator said. \u201cThere\u2019s His Highness now.\u201d\nDeku lifted his head, scanning the scene for any sign of a newcomer. No one else had emerged from the gates, so he looked to the walls and towers. There\u2014on a balcony on the tower nearest the square, a figure had stepped out into view. Deku shaded his eyes against the glare from the rising sun and squinted. The prince was finely dressed in dark blue, trimmed with silver. The sun shone in Deku\u2019s eyes, forcing him to shut them when they stung.\nA few scattered cries rang out from the crowd. \u201cYour Highness, have mercy!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s done nothing wrong!\u201d\n\u201cHe has such a kind face\u2014please, he doesn\u2019t deserve this!\u201d\n\u201cHave a heart, Prince Shouto!\u201d\n\u201cSpare him!\u201d\nDeku felt a hand close on his arm\u2014Uraraka\u2019s, who only ever gripped things with four digits unless she meant to make them fly. \u201cDeku.\u201d Her voice was tight.\nEyes still watering from the glare, he looked to the balcony again, and felt his blood freeze in his veins. The sun had reached a point where its light touched the prince, shining down upon scarlet and white hair and a half-marred face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d Deku cried.\n\u201cWho?\u201d his father asked. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cThe one who helped us out of the crowd,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cWho\u2014who helped me, last night, after the assassins injured me\u2014that was Prince Shouto!\u201d\nUp on the platform, the executioner swung his ax. At the last moment, Deku looked to the prince on the balcony, and saw him avert his head before the blade struck home.\nThe condemned man slumped headless to the platform. A groan went up from the crowd.\n\u201cYou all know the law!\u201d A shout went up from somewhere in the square, from a voice that was rough and explosively loud. \u201cWhoever beats the challenge marries the prince! Anyone who fails gets their head cut off! Now get the fuck out!\u201d\n\u201cNothing to see here!\u201d another voice piped up.\n\u201cMove along, move along!\u201d added a third.\nThere really was nothing left to see after that. The prince vanished from the balcony, and gradually the crowd began to disperse. The four foreigners were left standing toward the back, still shaken by what they had witnessed.\n\u201cHow barbaric,\u201d Iida murmured, wisely keeping his voice low.\nUraraka gripped Deku\u2019s arm again. \u201cDeku, what did you mean, he helped you yesterday? What happened when we were separated?\u201d\nAs best he could, Deku related the events of the previous evening. All the while, his eyes never left the now-empty balcony.\n\u201cHow very odd,\u201d Iida remarked. \u201cThat he would help a stranger in need, but callously see one of his own subjects killed for\u2026 what? That man mentioned a challenge. What do you think that was about?\u201d\nDeku was still watching the tower window where the prince had vanished, barely listening. \u201cDid you see his face?\u201d he said in a hushed voice.\n\u201cWhat about his face\u2014?\u201d Uraraka stopped dead. \u201cOh god. Deku, no. Don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\nHe turned to her. \u201cUraraka\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, Deku.\u201d She glared back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t care how pretty you think his face is, that is the opposite of keeping a low profile.\u201d\n\u201cUraraka, that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Deku\u2019s voice trailed off as his eyes lowered back to the square. Among the crowd, a familiar figure walked\u2014small, hunched, and seemingly feeble with age. The old woman shuffled past, shaking her head wearily, until she looked up at Deku\u2019s frantic waving. She blinked, and her eyes lit up with recognition.\n\u201cYou again,\u201d she said, leaning on a stick as she went to join them. \u201cGood to see you up and about, wounds healed.\u201d She paused, casting a brief glance back at the palace hill. \u201cSorry you had to see that.\u201d\n\u201cYou dropped me a hint, before,\u201d Deku said, kneeling to see eye to eye with her. \u201cWhen he brought me to you injured. I didn\u2019t realize at the time that he was the prince.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-kept secret, among the little people like me,\u201d the old woman replied. \u201cWell. Not little like me, but\u2026 you get it.\u201d\n\u201cMadam,\u201d Iida stepped forward. \u201cWe are\u2026 simple travelers passing through, with little knowledge of the customs here. Would you mind explaining about\u2026 about what we just saw?\u201d\n\u201cAhh.\u201d She nodded sadly. \u201cSome years back, a challenge was issued from the palace. Any who could answer a series of three riddles would win the prince\u2019s hand in marriage, and become ruler of this land alongside him. But any who failed to answer all of them would be sentenced to death.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous,\u201d Iida said.\n\u201cAnd yet, the fools keep coming.\u201d The old woman shook her head again. \u201cBy the dozens, sometimes. They march into the city, ring the gong three times, and then they fail and are executed at sunrise. That is the law.\u201d A sharpness entered her eyes then. \u201cSome say the prince is a cold one, to pose such a challenge, but I know better. That law comes from His Majesty, not the prince.\u201d\n\u201cKing Enji,\u201d the blind king said softly. There was something to his tone that the others could not quite name.\nShe nodded. \u201cHe is a strong king. Perhaps too strong\u2014there\u2019s not a soul in this kingdom who doesn\u2019t fear his wrath. And the people may gossip about the \u2018cold prince\u2019 but I know where this wretched challenge comes from.\u201d\n\u201cHis face\u2026\u201d Deku said softly.\nThe old woman sighed. \u201cAh. So you saw it, then.\u201d\n\u201cHow could I not?\u201d\n\u201cSaw what?\u201d Uraraka pressed. \u201cWhat about his face?\u201d\n\u201cHe looked sad,\u201d Deku said simply. \u201cAll alone up there, watching a man die. He looked\u2026 trapped.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s never spoken of why he likes to slip out of the palace and walk among the people,\u201d the healer said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t need to, I don\u2019t think. Trapped by an oath like that, who wouldn\u2019t want a breath of fresh air from time to time?\u201d\nDeku\u2019s eyes fell upon the gong. A mad idea entered his head, and his mouth went dry.\n\u201cThree, you said?\u201d he asked. \u201cThree rings of the gong, and three riddles?\u201d\nUraraka stiffened. \u201cDeku\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy son.\u201d The blind man\u2019s hand closed tightly on Deku\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but you mustn\u2019t. I\u2019ve come close to losing you far too many times already.\u201d\n\u201cRiddles, though,\u201d Deku said. \u201cI think I could do it. And Father\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think you could do it? Fuck, that\u2019ll be the fastest we\u2019ve churned out another corpse yet!\u201d\nDeku recognized the voice as the one that had addressed the crowd after the beheading. He looked up sharply to see a trio of young men, roughly his own age, striding in. The speaker was rough-looking, with pale hair and angry red eyes. To his left was another young man with bright scarlet hair and a tiny scar over his right eye. To the right, the third had bright yellow hair and an easy smile on his face. All three were dressed in a similar uniform, marked with the crest of the royal family.\nThe red-haired one stepped forward, hands out in a placating manner. \u201cListen\u2014what Bakugou\u2019s trying to say is\u2014Kaminari, you say it best.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a chance in hell,\u201d Kaminari said bluntly. \u201cDozens have tried. Hundreds, even.\u201d\n\u201cSame result every time,\u201d said the redhead.\n\u201cEvery goddamn one of them\u2019s dead as shit,\u201d Bakugou snarled, glaring at Deku. \u201cYou ring that gong, and you can kiss your fat head goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to kiss one\u2019s own head,\u201d Iida muttered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that something\u2019s wrong here,\u201d Deku said, spreading his hands wide. \u201cThis whole challenge sounds\u2026 fishy. Doesn\u2019t anyone wonder why things are the way they are?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d the redhead began.\n\u201cShut up, Kirishima,\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cLook. We work in the damn palace and we barely know what the fuck\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cAll we know is that this challenge is pretty much impossible.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s lucky we have that reputation at all,\u201d Kirishima added. \u201cWe\u2019d be getting challengers in droves, otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Bakugou said, with a quick glare at the old healer woman. \u201cYou think the prince is a trapped little damsel in need of rescue? Well who the fuck do you think wrote the riddles?\u201d He snorted. \u201cFace it, he\u2019s a cold fucking prince. Take it from someone who has to deal with him every day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really better if you just go home,\u201d Kaminari said.\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s more to this,\u201d Deku said stubbornly. \u201cI know there is. A cold prince wouldn\u2019t walk among his people, or pull wounded strangers out of alleys.\u201d He looked up, eyes narrowing at the gong. \u201cThere\u2019s more to this, and if I could get to the bottom of it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy boy,\u201d the blind man said, with a note of faint panic.\n\u201cDeku, no.\u201d Uraraka caught his arm again, but this time there was desperation in her voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t. You mustn\u2019t. We\u2019re all\u2014\u201d She shot a quick glance to the old woman and the trio of palace workers. \u201cWe\u2019re all in exile, remember? We\u2019ve only survived this long because we stayed together, so please. Please don\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\u201cLet us protect you,\u201d Iida added. \u201cThat\u2019s our job, remember? Don\u2019t do this again.\u201d\n\u201cYou have your job, I have mine,\u201d Deku said stubbornly.\nThis time, it was the blind king who caught hold of him, gripping him by the shoulders. \u201cMy son, please be reasonable,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cI understand your feelings\u2014truly, I do. But we must also look to our own. We can\u2019t solve every kingdom\u2019s problems if we can't even...\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Deku replied. Reaching up, he gripped both of his father\u2019s hands. \u201cBut Father\u2026 if I were the sort of person that kept my head down and minded my own business, you would not have adopted me when you did.\u201d\n\u201cSon, please\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI trusted my instincts, then,\u201d Deku said. \u201cSo did you. So please\u2026 please trust them now.\u201d\nThe bandages over his eyes were dampening. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure you don\u2019t,\u201d Deku promised.\n\u201cYour fucking funeral,\u201d Bakugou said dryly. \u201cNot that I care, just. Y\u2019know. We\u2019re the ones who have to plan the damn thing.\u201d\nGently, Deku pulled free of his companions. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a smart one, or a wise one. But I think it\u2019s a good one.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Uraraka asked, eyes wide with worry.\n\u201cNo less sure then I\u2019ve ever been about anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d Iida said flatly.\nDeku grinned at him. \u201cI guess not. Listen, you two\u2014if this does go south, and I fail\u2026 protect him, all right?\u201d\nThen, turning, he crossed the square to the arch where the gong hung. A mallet hung at its side, and he seized it and hefted it in his hand. Then, with one last glance at his companions, he lifted it up and struck the gong square in the center.\nThe noise was deafening, but Deku gripped the mallet and struck a second time, and a third time. Then, ears ringing, he lifted his head toward the palace again.\nLike rolling thunder, the reverberations seemed to reach every inch of the square. Long before they began to die down, the familiar figure in dark blue appeared once more at the tower balcony.\nThe scarred face looked down to where the newest challenger stared up, and Deku imagined he could see recognition light up within it.\nAs per tradition, the riddles would be posed at moonrise. It was the king\u2019s mercy, Kirishima explained, with only the faintest look of irony when he said it. If a man was to die, then one may as well allow him the chance to enjoy his final day. Not many were blessed with that sort of foresight to their own deaths.\nOr, Bakugou said cynically, the king\u2019s mercy was in giving some poor stupid idiot up to a full day to get wise and flee the city.\n\u201cNot much of a chance of that, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the blind king said softly. He was resigned. Not in despair yet, but Deku suspected that he was getting there. For his own part, Deku felt as if his heart was wound tight and ready to spring loose from his chest.\nThe old healer had gone home, but the three palace men still lingered. Deku eyed Bakugou fro a moment, then caught another by the elbow\u2014Kirishima.\n\u201cCould I have a word with you, later?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d\nKirishima hesitated, shooting a glance toward his two companions. \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know how helpful I can be, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI just have questions, that\u2019s all,\u201d Deku said. \u201cI can\u2019t force you to answer them.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 all right.\u201d Kirishima nodded. \u201cMeet me back here at noon, and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d With that, he gently shrugged off Deku\u2019s hand and hurried to follow the others.\nDeku rejoined his own companions, and immediately found himself trapped in Uraraka\u2019s tight embrace. \u201cIs there any way I can possible convince you not to do this?\u201d Her voice was muffled against his chest.\nGently he returned the hug. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that now.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, my boy,\u201d his father said gravely. \u201cI truly do.\u201d\nIida remained silent, fists clenched as he avoided the others\u2019 eyes. With a sigh, Deku stepped away from Uraraka.\n\u201cIida\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEver since he took you in,\u201d Iida said. \u201cEver since he adopted you as his heir\u2014I swore. I swore I would protect you with my every breath.\u201d When he turned to look at Deku again, his eyes were fierce with anger. \u201cWhy do you make it so difficult for me to fulfill that promise?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Deku looked around to check for eavesdroppers before continuing. \u201cI can\u2019t be a good prince, and do my position justice, if I never take risks. You know that, Iida\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOf course I know that!\u201d Iida snapped, then drew back a moment as if ashamed. \u201cA prince who would risk his life for his kingdom is a prince worth following. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing, Your Highness.\u201d\nDeku tilted his head to the side. \u201cAm I not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d Iida\u2019s voice trailed off when he saw the smile on Deku\u2019s face.\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Uraraka muttered.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the blind king said. \u201cWhat do you\u2014oh dear, he has that look on his face again, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you plotting, Deku?\u201d Uraraka asked. She perked up hopefully. \u201cDo you have some kind of strategy for meeting this challenge?\u201d\n\u201cNot really, no.\u201d Deku\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cThat part\u2019s still up in the air. But\u2026 think about it.\u201d He turned to them all, green eyes alight. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in conflict with this kingdom for years, haven\u2019t we? Quiet conflict, but quiet doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re any closer to peace.\u201d He stepped forward as he saw realization dawning in Iida and Uraraka\u2019s eyes, and on his father\u2019s face. \u201cIf I win this challenge, we have a chance to end that conflict.\u201d\n\u201cThe audacity,\u201d his father muttered, lips pursed to keep back a smile. \u201cI never considered peace through marriage, because I knew Enji would never agree to it.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019d have to, if I got it through his own game,\u201d Deku said with a grin.\n\u201cWill he still agree to it when he finds out who we are?\u201d Uraraka pointed out.\n\u201cA foul-tempered tyrant he may be,\u201d the blind king said. \u201cBut he is still a king, and his oath is sacred. He would have no choice but to agree.\u201d\nA sly little smirk played about Deku\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to negotiate, of course, if he\u2019s that opposed to it. I could offer to substitute a marriage for, oh, I don\u2019t know, a peace treaty, and maybe few battalions to help us take back a certain city?\u201d\nHis father\u2019s jaw dropped at this. \u201cWhy\u2014you cheeky little\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d Iida broke in. \u201cThis is all very well and good, but\u2026 remember, plans like these are only possible if you complete this challenge. A challenge which, I don\u2019t mind reminding you, is supposedly impossible.\u201d\nThe smile slipped from Deku\u2019s face, and before him the others\u2019 faces turned somber once more. \u201cWell\u2026 yes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t plan for.\u201d The look on his father\u2019s face nearly broke his heart. \u201cBut what\u2019s done is done. I took up the challenge, so I have to see it through. And it\u2019s a chance. However slim, it\u2019s still a chance, and remember that we came here with next to nothing.\u201d\nIt was Uraraka who lifted her head first. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, squaring her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s riddles, remember? Three riddles. And Deku, you\u2019ve always been clever.\u201d Her eyes shone with a fierce light. \u201cIf anyone can beat a challenge like that, it\u2019s you.\u201d\nIida heaved a sigh. \u201cHeaven help me, but I\u2019ve trusted you this long,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to trust you again.\u201d\n\u201cYou have preparations,\u201d the blind king said. \u201cThings you wanted to do? People you wanted to talk to?\u201d\n\u201cA few,\u201d Deku replied.\n\u201cVery well.\u201d His father embraced him once more. \u201cCome and see me, before you go to the palace at moonrise,\u201d he said close to Deku\u2019s ear. \u201cJust in case\u2026 I want to hear your voice one last time.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\nKirishima was waiting for him in the square at noon, as promised. He looked nervous as Deku approached.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about the riddles,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the answers, not even what the questions are. We\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy, and the king\u2026 he has ways of finding out if we go against him.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask you about that,\u201d Deku assured him. \u201cAnd besides, like I said\u2014whether or not you answer me is up to you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Kirishima uncrossed his arms and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cWhat did you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cJust a few things about the laws in this kingdom\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOne last question, and then I\u2019ll let you go,\u201d Deku said. \u201cDo you know of a place in this city where it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, quiet? Peaceful? Not too many people around?\u201d\nKirishima thought for a moment. \u201cWell\u2026 there are libraries where it\u2019s quiet, but if you\u2019re looking for the least people\u2026 there\u2019s a garden on the east side of the city, just past the clock tower. People don\u2019t go there very often, because it\u2019s close to the graveyard.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Deku gave him a lopsided grin. \u201cSounds like as good a place as any to contemplate my own mortality. Thank you for your help, Kirishima.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem nice,\u201d Kirishima called after him as he walked away. \u201cI bet you have people who would miss you, at home. Just\u2026 just think about them.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Deku replied over his shoulder. \u201cEvery day.\u201d\nThe city was surprisingly easy to navigate, and he found his way to the garden that Kirishima described. Sure enough, it was silent. Very pretty, but utterly empty. Deku stepped onto a pebbled path, breathed in the flower-scented air, and simply wandered in his thoughts.\nAt certain points, the decorative plants and trees would part, and Deku could see, some distance away, the graveyard that Kirishima had told him about.\nIt looked to be getting a bit crowded.\nSuppressing a shudder, Deku moved on. Near the center of the garden he found a small fish pond to sit by, with a decent view of the palace. With hopes high, he took a seat and settled in to wait.\nHe lost track of time, wondering about how his companions were faring, thinking of home, as the sky slowly darkened. It was getting on to early evening when his hopes were finally answered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a prince,\u201d Deku replied, without turning his head. \u201cIf I\u2019d known exactly who was dragging me out of a dirty alley, our first impressions might have gone a bit differently.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019d known that you were here to take up the challenge, I would have left you.\u201d Prince Shouto strode around the bench and stood facing Deku, drawn up to his full height. He was dressed like a commoner again, but his hood was down, revealing his distinctive face and hair. Deku looked up to meet his eyes, and tried not to make it obvious when he caught his breath. Prince Shouto really did have a nice face, scar notwithstanding.\n\u201cIn my defense, I didn\u2019t come here with that intention,\u201d Deku admitted. \u201cI\u2026 actually didn\u2019t know about that challenge until the beheading.\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s lip curled disdainfully. \u201cSo you decided you\u2019d have me on a whim, then?\u201d\nDeku winced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d he replied. \u201cI thought about it very carefully, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cLeave,\u201d Shouto said flatly. \u201cGo home while you still have your life.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Deku said. \u201cPeople keep telling me that, without bothering to ask if I still have a home to go to.\u201d\nThe prince was silent.\n\u201cI like your eyes.\u201d Deku wasn\u2019t sure why he said that. It was certainly true; in the dimming daylight, the prince\u2019s eyes shone dark on one side and pale on the other.\nPrince Shouto bristled at this. On the ground by his right foot, a sheen of ice spread across the stone.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Deku tried not to fidget. \u201cSo\u2026 are you always this nonchalant about people being blunt with you, or did the alley incident just make me special?\u201d\n\u201cYou think I can\u2019t recognize an equal when I see one?\u201d\nIt was Deku\u2019s turn to stiffen.\nWith a quiet huff, Prince Shouto lowered himself to sit with him, as far away as the bench permitted. \u201cI suspected. And then when I saw you by the gong, and how you held yourself and met my eyes, I was sure.\u201d He scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I can tell you\u2019re a prince, but I have no idea who you are or where you\u2019re from.\u201d\nDeku grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after I win your challenge.\u201d\n\u201cThen I suppose I\u2019ll never find out.\u201d\nDeku quieted for a moment. \u201cBakugou\u2026 said you\u2019re the one who writes the riddles. Is that true?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be clever, then, to make them so difficult.\u201d Deku tilted his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as a cheater.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Prince Shouto glared at him. \u201cDo you know what usually happens when people hear about an impossible challenge that punishes failure with death? They stay away. They keep their sons and daughters close in their own kingdoms, instead of letting them run off to their deaths.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 makes a lot of sense,\u201d Deku said.\n\u201cAnd, if I make them horribly difficult, I stay\u2026 myself.\u201d Prince Shouto\u2019s face darkened. \u201cI\u2019ve already got a fine pair of shackles, and I don\u2019t need or want another.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Deku asked cautiously. \u201cI would think that a good match might give you a chance at\u2026 at freedom.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re an even bigger fool than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Deku gave him a skeptical look.\nThe prince eyed him coldly. \u201cThese \u2018suitors\u2019 like you come from far and wide, men and women who don\u2019t know a damned thing about me except that I have half a pretty face and a throne in my future. I know very well what you\u2019re after, and thank you, but I\u2019ll take my chances with the man who I can at least count on outliving.\u201d\nDeku winced. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019ve been trying to convince me to leave, so I don\u2019t die.\u201d\nHe was watching Prince Shouto\u2019s face as he said this, and saw, for a brief instant, the pain laid bare. \u201cThe throne I\u2019m going to inherit is already a bloody one. The more deaths I can keep off my conscience, the better.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 what if, just once, you were wrong?\u201d Deku asked. Prince Shouto didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhat if someone came along who wasn\u2019t looking for wealth or power or a trophy husband? What if someone came along who could love you?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if the moon fell from the sky and crushed the palace beneath it?\u201d The prince\u2019s voice dripped with contempt. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about impossible things, then why limit ourselves?\u201d\n\u201cNo need to make fun. I was being serious.\u201d\n\u201cClearly not as serious as I am,\u201d Prince Shouto retorted. \u201cFairy tales aren\u2019t real, and if they were, my life wouldn\u2019t be one of them.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Deku asked. \u201cPlenty of fairy tales begin with misfortune.\u201d\nHis companion didn\u2019t even dignify that with an answer.\nDeku suppressed the urge to sigh. \u201cAre you always this open with challengers?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But it\u2019s not as if it matters.\u201d Prince Shouto rose from the bench. There was more ice on the ground by his right foot, but he put his left near it, and it melted to water and steam. \u201cYou\u2019ll flee the city, or you\u2019ll be dead by morning. Either way, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m ever going to see you again.\u201d He looked to the sky. \u201cIt\u2019ll be night in just a few hours. It\u2019s not too late, you know\u2014I could still help you and your friends escape the city.\u201d He met Deku\u2019s eyes in the gathering dusk. \u201cLast chance.\u201d\n\u201cI have to refuse,\u201d Deku said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince Shouto. But\u2026 you\u2019re not the only prince who\u2019s been driven to desperate measures.\u201d\nThose lovely eyes narrowed into slits. \u201cMy mercy ends here\u2014you\u2019ll meet the same challenge that all the others have.\u201d\nDeku smiled at him. \u201cThen may the best man win.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fucking sick to death of this shit.\u201d\nThe palace halls echoed with Bakugou\u2019s heavy footfalls, offset by Kirishima and Kaminari\u2019s comparatively lighter steps.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d Kirishima muttered, tugging at his palace uniform to straighten it. \u201cHey Kaminari, how are the wedding arrangements coming along?\u201d\nKaminari shrugged. \u201cI mean there\u2019s not much to it, they\u2019re just sort of continuing off of yesterday\u2019s planning. And the funeral arrangements?\u201d\n\u201cBasically recycling the leftovers from this morning,\u201d Kirishima replied. \u201cMaybe on the next one we\u2019ll actually have time to draw straws on who gets to do which.\u201d\n\u201cHow many this year?\u201d Kaminari asked.\n\u201cFive, so far,\u201d Kirishima answered. \u201cNot quite one per month. It\u2019s an improvement. I heard they came in droves, the first year the challenge was issued.\u201d\n\u201cPeople know better now,\u201d Kaminari said darkly.\nBakugou glared at a palace guard standing at attention as they passed, keeping silent until they were out of earshot of him. \u201cI swear, one of these days I\u2019m gonna blow this place to hell myself.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Kaminari sighed. \u201cThe king is powerful, but he\u2019s clever most of all. And he has plenty of guards at his disposal.\u201d\n\u201cHis royal wealth makes them loyal,\u201d Kirishima added. \u201cIf we were paid that high, maybe we\u2019d be loyal too.\u201d\n\u201cThe hell I would,\u201d Bakugou snarled.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cHe pays us exactly what he needs to: by letting us live, and even work for him, even though we\u2019re refugees from King Toshinori\u2019s realm\u2014\u201d\nKirishima covered his friend\u2019s mouth with his hand. \u201cWatch what you say\u2014you know King Enji hates hearing that name.\u201d\nBakugou sneered. \u201cOnly because he\u2019s pissed that someone else invaded our kingdom and sacked the royal city before he got the chance.\u201d He shrugged, resisting the urge to spit on the floor. \u201cOnce our king has his shit together and it\u2019s safe to go home again, then we\u2019re out.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d Kirishima said wistfully. \u201cIt would have been nice to be able to meet the prince.\u201d\nKaminari looked at him, startled. \u201cWait, then King To\u2014uh, you-know-who actually chose an heir before the invasion started? I thought he was just a rumor.\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Kirishima grinned. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not all\u2014Bakugou says he used to know him, when they were kids.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Kaminari turned his wide eyes to their friend. \u201cWhat was he like?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a stupid crybaby,\u201d Bakugou said through clenched teeth. \u201cUseless, too. I have no fucking idea what our king saw in him.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound a little biased, there,\u201d Kaminari chuckled. His laughter trailed off, and he sighed. \u201cThis is making me homesick.\u201d\n\u201cIt might not be so bad here, if someone actually won,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cWhat about this new challenger? What do you think of him?\u201d\nBakugou stiffened, but didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cA little ragged, but sometimes they\u2019re like that,\u201d Kaminari replied with a shrug. \u201cKing Enji never said the challenge was only for the high-born, so sometimes common people come to try their luck.\u201d\n\u201cHe seemed pretty sharp,\u201d Kirishima remarked. \u201cHe was asking questions earlier\u2014nothing about the actual challenge, just\u2026 about this kingdom, and its laws, and a little about the king. I don\u2019t know, I got the feeling that he was on to something I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then maybe he\u2019ll get the first riddle right,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cSome do.\u201d\n\u201cOr worse, he\u2019ll answer the first two but not the third,\u201d Kirishima groaned. \u201cI really hate getting my hopes up like that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, brace yourself,\u201d Kaminari advised, as the trio approached the main entrance to the palace. \u201cBecause it\u2019s moonrise now, and it\u2019s time to take him to the throne room.\u201d\nBakugou growled softly to himself, hands sparking as he held back his own power. \u201cIf he\u2019s really smart, then he won\u2019t be standing out there when we open those doors.\u201d\nThe doors were flung open, and a familiar diminutive figure stood there, plainly dressed and still scruffy from the road. At the sight of them, he put on a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d\nBakugou surprised the others by grabbing the newest challenger by the scruff of the neck and yanking him in.\n\u201cI\u2019d like a fucking word,\u201d he hissed under his breath.\n\u201cUh, Bakugou?\u201d Kirishima said uncertainly.\nThe smile was still fixed on the challenger\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cWon\u2019t take a minute.\u201d\nScowling, Bakugou dragged the young man to a secluded alcove, out of sight and earshot from any prying guards. Shoving him into the space, he rounded on him furiously.\n\u201cDeku, what the fuck do you think you\u2019re playing at?\u201d\nAt this, Deku\u2019s shoulders slumped slightly, and his smile turned nervous. \u201cH-hello, Kacchan,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s, um. Been a while. S-so you got out of the city before\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Bakugou growled warningly. \u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything,\u201d Deku gritted out, eyes wide. He poked his head out of the alcove, checked for eavesdroppers, and ducked back in again. \u201cIt\u2019ll come out eventually, but until then, you need to pretend you don\u2019t know me.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be the fucking prince,\u201d Bakugou whispered furiously. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here when you should be out leading armies with the king\u2014\u201d He broke off, red eyes wide. \u201cFuck. That blind man\u2014the feeble one\u2014you called him father. Are you telling me\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cHe was injured in our escape,\u201d Deku told him. \u201cHe nearly died, but\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re hoping All For One won\u2019t think to look for us in hostile territory.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, whatever, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d Bakugou bared his teeth. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing taking this fucking suicide challenge?\u201d\n\u201cTaking a gamble,\u201d Deku answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous one, and\u2014there\u2019s no time, I can\u2019t explain everything.\u201d His green eyes locked with Bakugou\u2019s. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t gotten along for years, but I need you to trust me on this.\u201d\n\u201cLike I have a choice,\u201d Bakugou spat.\n\u201cThe other two\u2014they\u2019re from our kingdom, too?\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s glare sharpened. \u201cYeah. And our position is really fucking treacherous right now, so you\u2019d better not get them killed, Deku.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d Deku said. \u201cThis will go one of two ways. Either I pass or I fail. If I fail, you have a chance to leave here. My father will be waiting for me with two of the Guard\u2014can you tell them what happened to me?\u201d\n\u201cLike I\u2019ll need to,\u201d Bakugou spat.\n\u201cIf you can, go with them,\u201d Deku went on, heedless. \u201cMy father could use someone with your strength, Kacchan. And if I pass\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhich is a pretty gigantic goddamn \u2018if\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIf I pass,\u201d Deku repeated, \u201cthen I\u2019m going to have to reveal myself. And for what comes after that\u2026\u201d He pursed his lips worriedly. \u201cDepending on how it goes, it might be best if you aren\u2019t in the room for that.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Good. Whatever. Anything else?\u201d Bakugou glared at him, disgruntled. \u201cWe can\u2019t stall any longer.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d Deku told him. \u201cThank you, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking call me that,\u201d Bakugou snapped. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each other, remember?\u201d He stepped out of the alcove and let his voice rise again. \u201cGet moving. The king and prince don\u2019t like being kept waiting.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cSorry to trouble you.\u201d\nUnder his breath, Bakugou added, \u201cIf we survive this, you owe me, Deku.\u201d\nBakugou, Kirishima, and Kaminari said little as they led Deku to the throne room. For his part, Deku kept silent as he watched their backs. Seeing them here left him with mixed feelings; on the one hand, he was happy that at least some of his countrymen had escaped the invasion and were out of reach of All For One\u2019s forces. On the other, Bakugou had made it clear that they were still on dangerous ground.\nIt must have killed Bakugou to be civil to an enemy this long.\nThe doors to the throne room were thrown open, and the trio strode in with Deku in tow, stopping to bow deeply.\n\u201cPresenting His Majesty, King Enji,\u201d Kirishima called out. \u201cAnd His Highness, Crown Prince Shouto, heir to the throne.\u201d\nDeku followed in their example and bent in a low bow as he entered. When he rose again, he found himself looking at the throne, and the king that sat upon it.\nHe had heard stories of King Enji\u2019s mastery of fire, but it was one thing to hear of it and another entirely to see a man dressed in royal finery and wreathed in flames. They wrapped around his shoulders, trailed from his arms, and even obscured parts of his face. Embers blazed in his crown like living jewels. Shadows danced across the walls, and it took Deku\u2019s eyes a moment to adjust to the flickering light. When he did, he looked upon King Enji\u2019s face, straining to see past the flames that masked it.\nIt was the face of a hard man. A cruel man. Deku felt his heart sink as he looked briefly into the king\u2019s baleful eyes, but he kept his back straight and forced himself to show no fear.\nPrince Shouto stood to the side, hands locked behind his back. His plain cloak and drab city clothes were nowhere to be seen; now he stood in blue and silver once more, chin held high with cold pride.\n\u201cYour Majesty, Your Highness,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cWe present to you this day\u2019s challenger\u2026 er\u2026\u201d He looked to Deku, sheepish. \u201cDo you have a name?\u201d\nDeku took a deep breath, fighting to calm his beating heart. \u201cDo I need one?\u201d he asked, with a steadiness that he did not feel. \u201cEveryone tells me I\u2019ll be dead by sunrise either way.\u201d\n\u201cHeh.\u201d It was not a laugh, but a quiet grunt of cold amusement. King Enji\u2019s voice was deep and harsh. Deku looked at his bright face again, and saw the king sizing him up with contempt in his eyes. \u201cAnd why does a ragged stray like you think he has a place in my throne room?\u201d\n\u201cI am here to take the trial,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cI heard your challenge, and I am answering it. If I have a place here, it is by your invitation, Your Majesty.\u201d\nThe king\u2019s eyes narrowed. He was silent for a moment, still sizing up Deku from his perch on the throne. \u201cYour impudence is familiar to me, boy,\u201d he said. \u201cI will enjoy seeing you beheaded.\u201d He raised a hand and waved dismissively. \u201cShouto.\u201d\nThe prince stepped forward, hands dropping to his sides. In one he held a rolled-up scroll.\n\u201cAnother lamb you have led to the slaughter, Shouto,\u201d King Enji said. \u201cA clever little boy like you, willing to die for a chance at your hand. High praise, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\nA line of hard tension ran across the prince\u2019s shoulders.. \u201cIf this is praise, then I prefer insults.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is your gratitude, Shouto? Does this challenge not show how loved you are?\u201d The king\u2019s face was unreadable. \u201cDozens, even hundreds, all dying for you.\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s eyes burned. \u201cLove is a lie,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cYou taught me that well enough, Father.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed. Forget fire and ice, Shouto. Your cleverness is your deadliest weapon.\u201d King Enji sat back. \u201cWatch now as your riddles claim another life.\u201d\nDeku felt his hands curling into fists. \u201cYour Majesty, by your own law, is it not the king who has the sole right to pass a death sentence?\u201d he said, before he could stop himself. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the riddles are the deadliest thing in this room.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t make much difference to you, when my executioner removes your head.\u201d The king\u2019s voice had taken on a dangerous tone.\nIt was a battle just to keep his face blank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Deku said quietly.\n\u201cIt is law,\u201d the king replied.\n\u201cIt is your law, Your Majesty,\u201d Deku answered. He turned his eyes to the prince once more. \u201cWhat do you think of it, Prince Shouto?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I think doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Prince Shouto told him. \u201cAll I have to do is wait. I walk through hell until it passes. That is all.\u201d\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way,\u201d Deku repeated. \u201cI can end it. I promise, I\u2019ll try to end it.\u201d\n\u201cYou will not.\u201d Even from the distance, Deku could feel the air turn cold, and something sparked from the prince\u2019s left side. His eyes burned with something very close to fear. \u201cI will not be shackled by anyone\u2014least of all you.\u201d\n\u201cI mean you no harm,\u201d said Deku. \u201cI\u2019d like to help, if I can.\u201d He smiled, unwavering in the face of the cold prince and the burning king. \u201cThings will get better. Just have faith, and they\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Prince Shouto replied. \u201cMy mother said the same thing to me, when I was a child. Did you ever hear about what happened to her?\u201d\nDeku\u2019s mouth went dry. \u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the prince said flatly. \u201cAnything you heard would only have been lies anyway. Barely a year after she told me that, her husband\u2019s cruelty had driven her out of her mind. In her madness, she burned my face.\u201d\nNo amount of forced calm could keep back Deku\u2019s soft gasp of horror. The prince\u2019s eyes pierced him, so cold that it burned Deku\u2019s to look at them.\n\u201cI will not allow anyone to take away my mind the way my father destroyed hers,\u201d Prince Shouto said, as ice spread from along his right sleeve like swirling embroidery.\n\u201cShouto.\u201d The king\u2019s menacing voice curled through the air. \u201cYou would do well to hope that he dies in the morning. Otherwise I will be very upset.\u201d\nFear flickered in the prince\u2019s eyes, and Deku felt his blood boil.\n\u201cEnough time has been wasted,\u201d Prince Shouto said, bracing himself. He met Deku\u2019s eyes once more. \u201cYour affairs are in order, I hope.\u201d\nDeku spread his hands, willing them not to shake with his held-back fury. \u201cAsk away, Prince.\u201d\nPrince Shouto took a breath, and began.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA fleeting phantom born at night,\nWhen all the light has gone\u2014\nBlind men follow in its wake,\nUntil it dies at dawn.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAn answer came almost immediately. \u201cThe mo\u2014no.\u201d Deku pressed his lips together, before speaking once more under his breath. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not the moon. That was the first thing that popped into my head, and it\u2019s never the first thing that pops into your head. First rule of riddles, that. Besides, blind men couldn\u2019t very well follow the moon, now could they?\u201d He frowned, tilting his head to one side. \u201cRiddles are steeped in metaphor, though. Not a literal night, then. Night, darkness, dark times, difficult times. And dawn is when the difficult times end, so what\u2026 what arrives in difficult times, and leaves when they are over? Hardship? Despair? No, no, those aren\u2019t fleeting and they aren\u2019t phantoms. Born at night, dies at dawn\u2026 what do difficult times bring\u2026 blind men\u2026\u201d\nHe thought of his father, embracing him at the bottom of the hill, wishing him luck, trusting him, believing in him, because after all this time, after the pain of losing his sight and having his city sacked, he still had\u2026\nDeku\u2019s eyes lit up, bright and wide. \u201cHope,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is hope. It is born when times are dark, but when the darkness passes and there is no more need of it, it leaves.\u201d He smiled at the prince. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t say that only blind men follow it, but\u2026 maybe you would.\u201d He waited on bated breath.\nThe prince stared back at him, shocked. The king was frowning.\n\u201cWell fuck me,\u201d Bakugou said in a hushed voice.\n\u201cTold you he\u2019d get the first one,\u201d Kaminari said.\nThe scroll still hung unused in the prince\u2019s hand as he spoke again. \u201cVery well. The second riddle, then\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cA prisoner runs cold and hot,\nAs bold as flame, and yet is not.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, Deku\u2019s first thought was the very man who stood before him. A prisoner certainly, and his power was both cold and hot. Once more he held back that answer and thought of the words.\n\u201cTricky one,\u201d he muttered. \u201cVery tricky. Shorter riddles are always harder\u2014they give fewer clues. Cold and hot, cold and hot\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow long will we have to listen to your prattle?\u201d the king snapped. \u201cStalling will not save you. If you do not know the answer, then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI beg your patience, Your Majesty,\u201d Deku gritted out, blood boiling once more at the tyrant\u2019s voice. \u201cThis is part of my process.\u201d\n\nWait.\n\n\n Blood boiling.\n\nIt was certainly true. The blood in his veins felt warm now, heated by his anger. And earlier that morning, had it not frozen when he recognized the prince in the tower as his rescuer?\nHot and cold.\nBold as flame\u2014fire was red, was it not? The king certainly gave him a decent frame of reference.\nAnd a prisoner\u2014was blood not imprisoned in his veins?\nSwallowing against the dryness in his mouth, Deku took the gamble. \u201cThe answer is blood, my prince,\u201d he said.\nKing Enji was leaning forward now. The prince was stepping back. He looked overwhelmed\u2014afraid, even. It hurt Deku to see his fellow prince look at him with such fear.\n\u201cI told you I was afraid of this,\u201d Kirishima muttered.\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Prince Shouto said. For the first time, he sounded more shaken than anything else. \u201cTruly, I am. Very few have gotten this far.\u201d\n\u201cHe will go no further, Shouto,\u201d the king growled. \u201cRemember your own words\u2014hope is for blind men. This one will die like all the others.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father,\u201d the prince said, without even looking back at him. \u201cMy hope died when you took Mother away.\u201d\nThis time, he did unroll the scroll in his hand. Deku wondered at that\u2014the third riddle was the only one he did not know by heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA coward heart bleeds poison,\nSo trust not your foolish eyes\u2014\nAs cold as ice but burns like flame,\nAnd all it touches dies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was no muttering this time. This time, Deku simply stared at the prince, speechless and pale with growing horror.\nSilence stretched in the throne room, moment by moment, until King Enji let out a low chuckle.\n\u201cAnd to think I was nearly worried,\u201d he said, rising from his throne. His mantle of flame threw the shadows on the walls into a frenzy. \u201cIs your mind finally blank, little stranger?\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cGuards!\u201d The throne room doors opened once more, and armored footsteps echoed in the halls.\nBehind him, Deku heard Bakugou curse, and it jarred him out of his daze. \u201cWait!\u201d He stepped forward, blinking against the stinging in his eyes. \u201cWait. I apologize, I was just\u2026 shocked. That\u2019s all. I understand now.\u201d He looked to the prince as his vision began to blur. \u201cI understand why so many have failed. They really were blinded, weren\u2019t they? By wealth, or power, or\u2026 or beauty.\u201d Prince Shouto stared at him, incredulous. \u201cSo many of them\u2026 they were only focused on what they wanted, weren\u2019t they? They never tried to see things through your eyes, even though you were the one who made these riddles. Prince Shouto\u2026\u201d He blinked away the haze of tears. \u201cIs\u2026 is that really how you see yourself?\u201d\nThe scroll slipped from the prince\u2019s nerveless hand, and clattered to the throne room floor. It rolled open, displaying the three riddles inked out in a skillful script. Beneath each of them was written the answer.\nHOPE.\nBLOOD.\nTODOROKI SHOUTO.\nSilence stretched beyond that. Then\u2014\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Bakugou muttered.\nA slow smile spread across Deku\u2019s face. With a swift motion he wiped his eyes and hid his crushing relief. That was the unknown factor, passed with flying colors. It was now that his ideas could begin.\nThe king stormed down from his throne, flames leaping higher in his fury. Shouto was quick to recover from his shock and draw back, well out of his father\u2019s way.\n\u201cNo,\u201d King Enji snarled. \u201cImpossible. I would burn this city to the ground myself before I let some ragged tramp off the streets near my throne.\u201d He loomed over Deku, forcing him to step back to keep from being burned.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a king, Your Majesty,\u201d Deku reminded him in a low voice. \u201cYour oath is sacred.\u201d\nDeku could hear crackling\u2014either flames, or the king\u2019s knuckles popping. \u201cNo! It is too soon, damn you!\u201d\n\u201cToo soon?\u201d Deku kept his head down and fought to keep his tone meek. \u201cToo soon for what, Your Majesty?\u201d\n\u201cToo soon for his trap to ensnare its intended prey,\u201d the prince spoke up, stepping forward once more. His facade of icy composure was wearing thin. \u201cThere were rumors that his greatest enemy had a secret heir\u2014\u201d\nThe king aimed an offhand cuff at his son, forcing him back. \u201cI would have taken everything from him,\u201d he said, seething. \u201cFirst his child. And then, in his despair, I would have taken his kingdom as well. And now I\u2019ve had both chances taken from me!\u201d\nDeku\u2019s blood, as it said in the riddle, ran cold. There was only one enemy that Enji could be speaking of.\nA trap for me, he realized. All along, this has been a trap for me.\nHe was still on dangerous ground, it seemed.\nA quick glance over his shoulder told him that Bakugou, Kirishima, and Kaminari were nowhere to be seen. There were guards by the door, but they were well out of reach. Prince Shouto was hiding fear and uncertainty behind a cold facade. He could not be assured of any allies here.\nBut perhaps\u2026\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d he said, looking to the prince. Prince Shouto blinked at him, looking every bit as wary as a cornered dog. \u201cIt\u2019s marriage you\u2019re afraid of, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not\u2026 really looking to get married either, to be honest. Not for wealth or thrones or anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The prince\u2019s coldness gave way, and he gaped openly. \u201cThen why the hell did you take the challenge in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cA number of reasons,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cBut most of all, I saw your face at the execution this morning. You looked so unhappy. I thought I might try breaking the cycle.\u201d\nBefore him, the King calmed once more, though Deku knew very well that he was still tense and displeased. \u201cWell. In that case, these things can be fixed, I suppose.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cName your price.\u201d\nIt was Deku\u2019s turn to gape. \u201cI\u2026 beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a simple solution,\u201d King Enji went on dismissively. \u201cTell me a number, and I will buy your silence for that price. Someone will be executed in your place, and this night never happened.\u201d\nDeku lost his temper then. \u201cIf you do that, Your Majesty, then I will march through your city streets, throwing your gold to the people and shouting the riddles\u2019 answers at the top of my voice, while naming you an oathbreaker. I have not insulted your sense of honor, so please do not insult mine.\u201d\nThe king\u2019s eyes flashed. His mantle of fire blazed toward the ceiling. \u201cImpudent wretch\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Prince Shouto stepped in once more. \u201cWait, Father, he\u2019s right. The oath\u2026\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThe oath is sacred. The challenge has been won, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHang the challenge,\u201d King Enji snarled, and Shouto flinched back when his father rounded on him. \u201cIt was to be a trap, you idiot boy.\u201d He stepped forward, and the prince stepped back. \u201cYour riddles were supposed to be unbeatable, and some vagabond walked in and\u2014\u201d\nThere was something about the sight that pushed Deku beyond boiling blood and fists that dug nails into his palms. He saw the prince\u2019s eyes, and the king\u2019s cruelty, and threw caution to the wind.\n\u201cBefore you punish him, King Enji, your trap worked.\u201d The words were out before he could think to stop them. The king froze in his tracks, and slowly turned back to him. Deku stepped forward. \u201cI imagine the rumors you heard were just that\u2014rumors. My father only named me his heir recently, and told no one when he did. He never got the chance.\u201d He spread his hands wide. \u201cWell, I am here, King Enji. And I have beaten your challenge anyway.\u201d\nHe waited, scarcely daring to breathe.\n\u201cI would rather die,\u201d King Enji said quietly. With each word, his voice grew to thunder. \u201cI would rather die a thousand terrible deaths than see my kingdom in the hands of any child of that bastard!\u201d\n\u201cI have played your game,\u201d Deku went on. \u201cI have won by terms you set. I can even offer you an alternative. Will you not even listen? My father says you are an honorable man. Please\u2014if you listen to my terms, we might both benefit from this.\u201d\nKing Enji\u2019s eyes blazed with hatred.\n\u201cWe swore an oath,\u201d the prince reminded him. \u201cOur oath is sacred.\u201d\n\u201cMy throne is sacred,\u201d the king snarled, rounding on him again.\n\u201cFine then,\u201d Deku said, seeing the king still undecided. \u201cWill another chance convince you? One more chance for you to win, and if I still beat you, then you accept my terms.\u201d He stepped forward, praying that his legs would not shake. \u201cYou like riddles, don\u2019t you, Your Majesty? Then I have one for you. Not three, just one.\u201d He met the king\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve only had rumors to go on that I even existed. You know nothing about me. No one does\u2014not even my own countrymen. So here is my riddle: tell me my name by sunrise, and you may execute me as planned. If not, then you listen to my terms, you set your son free from this oath, and you end this murderous game.\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d the king said immediately, and made a swift motion with his arm.\nGauntleted hands closed on Deku\u2019s arms, forcing them back to painful angles. King Enji\u2019s guards had moved in and seized him.\n\u201cWe have a long night ahead of us, I imagine,\u201d the king said. \u201cOr perhaps a short one. My torturers are quite inventive.\u201d\nFear threatened to consume Deku\u2019s heart, but in an instant, cold fury had overtaken it. He met the king\u2019s eyes, unblinking. \u201cTreachery when we\u2019ve barely started, Enji? My father was wrong about you. You wouldn\u2019t know honor if it jumped up and bit you.\u201d\n\u201cI look forward to learning your name, boy.\u201d He motioned once more to the guards. \u201cTake him away.\u201d He turned on his heel. \u201cGo with them, Shouto\u2014and if he tries any magic, make him swallow it.\u201d\nFor a moment, the prince hesitated. Then, ducking his head, he moved to join the guards. \u201cYes, Father.\u201d\nThe walk down to the dungeons was much longer than the initial walk to the throne room. Deku wasn\u2019t sure if this was due to distance, or the fact that he fought tooth and nail at every step. He kept his power locked inside\u2014no use using it here, so close to the king and his own power over fire.\nThroughout the journey, he kept his eyes open for Bakugou and his friends. But they were nowhere to be seen\u2014Deku could only hope that they had fled the palace already.\nThe palace grew colder, the lower they went. Fine polished floors became rough stone, and Deku realized that his window for escape was rapidly closing. If he was going to make a move, then he needed to do it soon. There were seven guards in all, and he could escape them easily, but the prince\u2026\nWould the prince stop him?\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make it easier for yourself if you give him what he wants,\u201d Shouto said suddenly. \u201cYou can at least have a peaceful night.\u201d\n\u201cI might still have that anyway,\u201d Deku said, his tone deceptively light. \u201cI have a very high pain tolerance, you know. I\u2019m told it scares people.\u201d\nShouto watched him, eyes unreadable. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely, ask anyone,\u201d Deku replied. \u201cAnd thank god for that, otherwise I\u2019d never get anything done.\u201d He dug his heels into the stone as he looked at Shouto again. \u201cWhat about you, Shouto? How mad are you?\u201d\nThe other prince was silent.\nHis answer came when they arrived at a crossing of corridors, and Prince Shouto spoke at last.\n\u201cMight want to lift your feet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYour Highness?\u201d one of the guards said quizzically.\nShouto locked eyes with Deku. \u201cI said, lift your feet.\u201d\nDeku did that, and more. Power crackled through his body, and he launched himself upward right as Shouto\u2019s foot slid swiftly along the stone floor. Ice burst forth, rising up to trap the legs of the nearest guards. Deku landed harmlessly, slipping on the ice but not encased in it.\n\u201cYour Highness, stop!\u201d one of them called out. \u201cYour father will punish you\u2014\u201d He stopped talking when the ice reached his neck.\nIn the narrow hallway, not all of the guards had been ensnared. One of them gathered his wits and raised a crossbow. The string twanged, and more followed.\nUsing the trapped guards as springboards and stepping stones, Deku launched himself at the other prince. With power lending him strength and speed, he caught Shouto around the waist and sent them both hurtling free of the cluster of guards. He felt cold air against his back, heard an ominous creaking, and looked back to see a thick wall of ice blocking the entire corridor. Skidding to a halt, he released Shouto and caught his breath.\n\u201cSorry about the rough handling,\u201d he said, and found the other prince watching him again.\n\u201cMy father told me about the power of King Toshinori,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really are his son.\u201d He blinked, and for a moment he looked almost awkward. \u201c\u2026You don\u2019t look it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m adopted,\u201d Deku answered. \u201cWhere to now?\u201d\nShouto caught him by the elbow and pulled him along. \u201cThis way. Hurry.\u201d Deku rushed to follow, only to slow when he realized that the other prince was leading him further down rather than back up the way they had come. Shouto, noticing this, matched his pace. \u201cYou can\u2019t get out through the main entrances, but there\u2019s another way out of the palace. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s found it yet, or he would have sealed it off to keep me from going out into the city.\u201d\n\u201cA hidden exit?\u201d Deku sped up again. \u201cI was wondering how you got from the square to the palace so quickly this morning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not far. That\u2019s\u2026 part of why I waited so long to stop the guards.\u201d Shouto touched his shoulder. \u201cHere.\u201d\nIt was a small storage chamber close to the dungeons, mostly unused from the looks of it. Deku nearly sneezed from the dust as Shouto led him inside and shut the door. A tall cabinet stood against one wall, and the prince threw it open with one hand and pulled a key from around his neck with the other. Moments later, the back of the cabinet swung open like a door, revealing the mouth of a tunnel and a flight of stairs leading down into the dark.\nPrince Shouto plucked a torch from a wall sconce and, with a look of distaste, lit it with his left hand before passing it to Deku. \u201cThis tunnel leads out to the square,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be safe, because he\u2019ll have the guards out looking for you the moment he realizes what I\u2019ve done, but at least you\u2019ll be out of the palace.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Deku said softly.\n\u201cSurvive.\u201d The prince locked eyes with him. \u201cYou survive until morning, do you understand me? I don\u2019t know what will happen then, but\u2026 but I\u2019d like to find out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Deku\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cWill he\u2014will you\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Shouto said coldly.\n\u201cOf course it matters\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGo.\u201d\nDeku moved to obey, but paused one last time and turned back. His free hand found the back of Shouto\u2019s head and gently drew him close, until their foreheads were touching. Deku could feel the other prince\u2019s power against his skin\u2014cold on one side, and warm on the other. \u201cYou\u2019re not a coward.\u201d\nShouto went still. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a coward, Shouto.\u201d Deku shut his eyes, willing him to listen. \u201cYou\u2019re a survivor, and that\u2019s not the same thing. You\u2019ve lived your whole life with him, and you haven\u2019t let him turn you cruel. You haven\u2019t let him steal your kindness. Despite everything he\u2019s tried to do, you\u2019re still you. That makes you strong, Shouto.\u201d He pulled back, just far enough to raise his head and press his lips to the prince\u2019s forehead. \u201cGood luck. I won\u2019t waste this chance you\u2019ve given me.\u201d\nWithout another word, he turned and plunged into the dark.\nThe tunnel led out of an old shed at the edge of the square. Deku nudged the door carefully ajar, checked for guards, and finally slipped back out into the open. Tossing the torch into the fountain, he scanned the square until at last he spotted the familiar figures of his companions, clustered together and watching the palace gates.\nHe tried not to run too quickly, not wanting to look suspicious or draw attention to himself, and finally managed to sidle close enough to sprint the rest of the way under the cover of darkness.\n\u201cI have some good news, and some bad news,\u201d he said, nearly startling the life out of Uraraka.\n\u201cDeku! W-what\u2014how did you\u2014where did\u2014?\u201d\nHis father caught hold of him, looking dazed with relief. \u201cYou\u2019re alive. My son\u2014does that mean\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Iida asked.\n\u201cThe good news is, I answered all the riddles,\u201d Deku went on, watching the palace on the hill for any sign of activity. \u201cThe bad news is, King Enji found out who I am, and\u2026 he isn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell we knew he wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Iida pointed out. \u201cBut if you passed the trial anyway, then his happiness doesn\u2019t enter into it.\u201d\n\u201cNormally that would be true, but it turns out we may have underestimated his hatred for us.\u201d Deku clenched his teeth. \u201cI think he would have killed me on the spot, but I bought time by extending the game.\u201d He saw them opening their mouths, surging forward to question him, and shook his head furiously while grasping his father\u2019s arm to forestall interruptions. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time. The king has to guess my name by sunrise. So until then\u2014you know nothing of me. We\u2019ve never met.\u201d At the top of the hill, guards were emerging from the palace. \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness\u2014\u201d Iida warned.\n\u201cHe tried to torture the answer out of me the moment I named my challenge,\u201d Deku hissed back. \u201cAnd he would have, if Shouto hadn\u2019t helped me escape. If they find out you know me, he\u2019ll try to do the same to you.\u201d He looked around once more, checking for approaching guards. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all gone wrong\u2014just stay ahead of them until sunrise.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll split up,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cIida, stay with the king. Let\u2019s go, Deku.\u201d\nDeku blinked, startled. \u201cWait\u2014but it\u2019d be better if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo buts,\u201d she snapped. \u201cClearly you need a bodyguard, so let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll protect your father with my life,\u201d Iida said fiercely.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you again at sunrise,\u201d the king added, releasing his son reluctantly. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\nAs guards began to rush down the hill, the nameless prince and his single guard fled the square.\n\u201cThe challenger has fled! By order of the king, no one in this city shall sleep until the challenger\u2019s name is known! Anyone who brings forth his name or the young man himself shall be rewarded! Anyone caught sheltering the fugitive will share his death sentence! Any home, shop, or building suspected of hiding him will be put to the torch with its owners inside! The king has spoken!\u201d\nUraraka had not let go of his wrist for several hours. They had stopped perhaps twice, never for longer than a few minutes\u2014enough to drink a few mouthfuls of water, and then move on again.\nThe king\u2019s guards were out in force, combing every inch of the city for them. At any given moment, it seemed that the two of them were barely a step ahead of capture. Hungry, weary, and longing for sleep, the pair kept their feet moving and sought a proper hiding place. Thankfully none of the townsfolk were after them, but after the king\u2019s grim threat, they could not be counted on for aid.\nAt last, when their path took them close enough, Deku remembered the secluded garden where he had spoken with Prince Shouto earlier that evening. The thick flowering plants provided ample cover, as long as they kept off the path, and from there they had a straight shot to the graveyard nearby. The two of them crept in among the tombstones, many of them clustered and crowded together, and paused to breathe.\nHere, at least, the guards did not dare to walk.\n\u201cWell, at least this is nothing new for us,\u201d Uraraka remarked under her breath. \u201cOn the run from people trying to kill us. If nothing else, we\u2019ve had plenty of practice. Right?\u201d\nBeside her, Deku stumbled mid-step and sank to the ground. He crouched in the shelter of a tall headstone, trembling.\nUraraka knelt by him. \u201cI think we can afford to catch our breath. Are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Deku rasped. \u201cJust fine. Sorry. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026\u201d His voice cracked, and he shifted until his side was pressed up against the stone, knees drawn up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Uraraka, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDeku?\u201d Uraraka shifted closer, feeling her way to Deku\u2019s shoulder in the scant light of the moon. His head was down, his face hidden as he ran his shaking hands through his tangled curls, but she could hear him crying quietly. \u201cDeku, talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t what I wanted,\u201d Deku whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen, I swear\u2014\u201d\nHer soft sigh barely reached his ears before she drew him into a hug. \u201cI know. I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou heard what they said. You heard\u2014Uraraka, he\u2019s going to kill people.\u201d\n\u201cLook at where we are, Deku,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cHe already has.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014all those people, who took the challenge, they knew the risks,\u201d Deku went on, breath hitching with quiet sobs. \u201cThey knew\u2014they could die. But\u2014but now this whole city, all these people\u2014because of me\u2014\u201d\nUraraka\u2019s arms tightened around him. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one threatening them. Deku\u2014\u201d she pulled back, hands on his shoulders, careful not to use her power by accident. \u201cDeku, the only way you\u2019ve caused any of this is by playing fair, and expecting the king to do the same. And he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known,\u201d Deku whispered. \u201cBut\u2014I was stupid. I\u2019m only alive now because others helped me. Others took risks for me, and\u2014\u201d He shuddered again, tears falling freely from his eyes. \u201cI thought I could help the prince. But I think I just made everything worse for him.\u201d\n\u201cYou said he helped you escape,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cDo you think we can count on him to help us again?\u201d\nDeku tensed immediately, eyes wide. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014Uraraka, no, I don\u2019t even know how his father\u2019s punished him for helping me escape, I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t ask any more of him.\u201d\n\u201cCome sunrise, we\u2019ll need something,\u201d Uraraka said softly. \u201cIf King Enji didn\u2019t accept his first loss, then something tells me he won\u2019t bend to a second.\u201d She looked to where the palace stood silhouetted against the night sky. \u201cIf he\u2019s this mad, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to execute every soul in this city if he doesn\u2019t get his way.\u201d\nDeku shuddered again.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let him.\u201d Uraraka squeezed his shoulder. \u201cBreathe, Deku. Use that mind of yours.\u201d\nSlowly, Deku took a deep breath and let it out again. It shook both ways. \u201cI\u2019m trying. I can\u2019t stop thinking about Prince Shouto, and that command from before\u2014none shall sleep. How many people are awake and afraid for their lives right now?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re why we need to win this,\u201d Uraraka said fiercely. \u201cIf we give up, then they may be spared tonight, but all of this will only continue. More people will die. You know that, right?\u201d\nShakily, Deku nodded. \u201cDo you think Father and Iida are all right?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely. There\u2019s not a soul alive who can catch Iida.\u201d\n\u201cIf King Enji finds Father\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThen he\u2019ll hardly recognize him,\u201d Uraraka reminded him. \u201cHis Majesty doesn\u2019t look himself these days, remember? We can\u2019t give up, Deku. Whether or not King Enji likes it, the more we best him, the greater claim we have.\u201d She patted him. \u201cYou keep using that head of yours, and let me know if you think of something. For now, let\u2019s find somewhere more defensible.\u201d\n\u201cR-right.\u201d Shakily, Deku rose to his feet again. \u201cThank you, Uraraka.\u201d\nHer teeth flashed in the dark as she grinned. \u201cAnytime, Deku.\u201d\nIn the heavy silence of the shadowed graveyard, a whisper-shout cut through the night. \u201cThere you are!\u201d\nUraraka cursed under her breath, and she seized Deku\u2019s arm in a tight grip and readied herself to flee. \u201cRun!\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Deku dug his heels in, twisting around in the direction of the voice. He squinted in the darkness, straining to see. With his eyes long adjusted to the night, it was easy to pick out the figures approaching. Three of them, and no more. \u201cWait, Uraraka.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re fucking proud of yourself, Deku,\u201d Bakugou snarled as he stormed into view. Kirishima and Kaminari still flanked him. All of them looked harried, and had abandoned their palace uniforms for more inconspicuous clothing. \u201cThis goddamn manhunt has trashed half the city!\u201d\nDeku winced. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I thought would happen, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you thought the man who\u2019s hated our king for years would hand over his throne?\u201d Bakugou snarled.\n\u201cOur king?\u201d Uraraka echoed. \u201cYou mean these three\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want his damned throne!\u201d Deku snapped, still fighting to keep his voice low. \u201cI thought that once he knew that, he could be reasoned with.\u201d\n\u201cWell, lesson learned,\u201d Kaminari said dryly.\n\u201cI have to ask, though,\u201d Deku went on. \u201cYou three\u2014did you know about the trap?\u201d\nKaminari\u2019s face darkened. \u201cI didn\u2019t. If I had, and if I\u2019d known that you were\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cI\u2019d never have led you into that throne room, Your Highness.\u201d\nKirishima punched Bakugou in the shoulder, none too gently. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you knew he was our prince the whole time.\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Kirishima, I didn\u2019t know about the goddamn trap, either!\u201d Bakugou seethed. \u201cSo, Deku, do you have any more clever plans? Because you\u2019re going to fucking need one.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re with you if you do,\u201d Kaminari said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only chance we\u2019ve had to escape since we first got here.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not escaping,\u201d Deku said.\n\u201cFucking typical Deku,\u201d Bakugou growled. \u201cThen you\u2019d better start thinking, Deku, because time\u2019s running out.\u201d\n\u201cFor King Enji, yes,\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cIf we stay ahead of the guards for just another hour or two, it\u2019ll be dawn.\u201d\n\u201cTo hell with King Enji! I\u2019m talking about our king!\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your brilliant idea for that, Deku?\u201d\nDeku went still. \u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d Kirishima\u2019s voice shook. \u201cSome guard had spotted you with two others\u2014an old blind man and a guard with glasses.\u201d\n\u201cThey were caught, not too long ago,\u201d Kaminari added. \u201cLast we heard, King Enji was holding them in the courtyard. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s going to try to torture your name out of them.\u201d\nFor a moment, Deku swayed on his feet. Then he moved like lightning, power crackling along his limbs, lending him speed as he turned toward the palace and lunged\u2014\n\u201cDeku, no!\u201d Uraraka caught him around the waist with both arms. \u201cJust wait! Bakugou is right! We need a plan!\u201d\n\u201cLet go!\u201d Deku twisted in her arms. \u201cIida\u2014my father\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re still alive!\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cThey\u2019re still alive, and the prince\u2014Prince Shouto\u2014he\u2019s doing what he can for them. But\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI have to go to them!\u201d Deku pleaded. \u201cUraraka, let me go!\u201d\n\u201cI feel the same way!\u201d Uraraka cried out. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just rush in blindly! That\u2019s what got us into this! Think, Deku! How can we win this?\u201d\nDeku went still. He was shaking again, tears gathering in his eyes as he stared up at the palace with raw pain on his face. \u201cI\u2026 the guards\u2026 the king is strong, and I can\u2019t fight him alone\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d Uraraka gritted out, not letting go of him. She turned to glare at King Enji\u2019s former servants. \u201cYou three\u2014are you still loyal to our king?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019d be here if we weren\u2019t?\u201d Bakugou snapped.\n\u201cWe had to drag Bakugou off before he tried a rescue himself,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cWe thought it would be better to find you and see if you had anything.\u201d\n\u201cThe people here live in fear,\u201d Deku spoke up suddenly. \u201cDo they know where the blame lies? Would they fight back, given the chance?\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, they\u2019re mostly like you,\u201d Kaminari replied. \u201cThey comfort themselves, thinking the king can be reasoned with. He\u2019s harsh but honorable\u2014that\u2019s what they think. That\u2019s what they tell themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThen we have to let them know they\u2019re wrong.\u201d Deku\u2019s teeth clenched. He had gone still in Uraraka\u2019s arms, as tense as a coiled spring. \u201cUraraka. You were right. He has me on the run because I\u2019ve been playing fair, and acting as if he will, too. I need to stop playing fair.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Kirishima cried suddenly. \u201cSpeaking of not playing fair, the prince\u2014the other prince, I mean, Prince Shouto\u2014he said to give something to you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the fuck did you talk to him?\u201d Bakugou demanded.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\u201cKirishima got caught when he sneaked back into the palace to see what was going on,\u201d Kaminari answered for him. \u201cLuckily the prince was the one who caught him.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch me,\u201d Kirishima said stubbornly. \u201cI went looking for him on purpose.\u201d He looked to Deku. \u201cHe said to give this to you, if I happened to find you.\u201d\nReaching over, Kirishima passed him a scroll. It had been removed from its roller, creased and rumpled from being shoved roughly into his pocket. By the light of the moon, Deku unrolled it and held it up for the others to see.\nIt was familiar to him, as battered as it was. It was written in skillful script and stamped with the royal seal\u2014all three of the prince\u2019s riddles, and their answers. And on the bottom corner, hastily scrawled in a much less careful hand, was a note, signed with the prince\u2019s name:\n\nShout them in the streets.\n\nDeku\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh, you clever boy.\u201d\nThe blind king knelt in the grass, chest heaving with every harsh breath. With his hands tied tightly behind his back, he could not feel for his companion, or do much of anything. With his head still pounding from a sharp blow, it was a miracle in itself that he was still upright. \u201cIida?\u201d he rasped.\n\u201cStill here, Your Majesty.\u201d The young guard\u2019s voice was steady\u2014deceptively so. Blood ran from his forehead, and one eye was nearly swollen shut. \u201cEnji\u2019s left\u2014probably giving us a moment to\u2014\u201d One of their guards struck him, cutting him off.\n\u201cThat\u2019s King Enji to you,\u201d the man snapped. \u201cHis is the only majesty you need to be worrying about.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s no king of mine,\u201d Iida growled.\nSomewhere behind them, a side door into the palace opened and shut, and light, swift footsteps made heads turn toward their source. Iida drew in a sharp breath, and the guards\u2019 armor rattled as they stood swiftly to attention.\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d one of them said stiffly. \u201cWe are under orders from your father to prevent anyone from\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to prevent me, then I welcome you to step forward and try. Otherwise, hold your tongue.\u201d Prince Shouto\u2019s voice was as cold as it was familiar to the two prisoners. Ignoring the sentries, he knelt down by the blind man and held a cup to his lips. \u201cHere\u2014drink this.\u201d\nCarefully the king sipped from the cup, and cool water soothed his parched throat. The cup shook in Prince Shouto\u2019s hand as he took it away again. \u201cThank you, young prince,\u201d the blind man said. \u201cAnd thank you for earlier, as well.\u201d When there was no answer, he continued. \u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it? In that crowd?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Prince Shouto replied, moving away. He offered the cup to Iida as well, who drank from it gratefully. \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t recognize you, King Toshinori.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly all right,\u201d Toshinori assured him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Iida murmured. \u201cAnd thank you\u2026 for\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off, and he eyed the guards warily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d the prince replied flatly. \u201cMy father already knows I let your prince escape.\u201d He took the cup away and moved back to Toshinori. Reaching out, he placed his right hand against the darkening bruise on the blind man\u2019s forehead, soothing the pain with his power. As he did so, the edge of his sleeve slipped back a few inches from his wrist.\n\u201cYour arm,\u201d Iida said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s bandaged. Did he\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d Prince Shouto covered the bandaging with his sleeve again. \u201cHe\u2019s beginning to panic. It\u2019ll be dawn soon, and he\u2019ll lose this game again if neither of you talk.\u201d\nIida grinned fiercely.\n\u201cThat only means he\u2019ll be more desperate,\u201d Prince Shouto went on. He could not look either of them in the eye. \u201cWhether you speak or not\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you will survive the morning.\u201d His knuckles were white with tension. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been hearing,\u201d Toshinori said gently. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as if you\u2019ve had much of a say in all this, young prince. What have you to be sorry for?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught up in all this,\u201d Prince Shouto replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do more for you. I\u2026 can\u2019t repeat what I did, earlier. If I could, I swear to you I would.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s treasonous talk, Your Highness,\u201d one of the guards snapped. Iida kicked out at him, and received another clout to the ear for his trouble.\n\u201cI suppose even a king like Enji has men loyal to him,\u201d Toshinori said grimly.\nPrince Shouto gave the guards a scornful glare. \u201cTheir loyalty is bought and paid for.\u201d\nThe palace doors were flung open again, and the king himself came storming out, flames darting about his shoulders in his fury. His face was fixed in a furious snarl. \u201cGet away from there,\u201d he snapped, and Prince Shouto hesitated a moment too long before backing away.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lost,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou know these two won\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me, boy,\u201d the king snapped. \u201cThere is still time. Perhaps having one tortured will loosen the other\u2019s tongue?\u201d\nIida surged forward on his knees, until a guard stopped him with a spear point to his throat. Defiantly, Iida pressed his chin against the blade. \u201cYou might as well kill me,\u201d he dared them, as a drop of blood trickled down his neck. \u201cI\u2019d rather die then give you what you want.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that now.\u201d Enji\u2019s eyes gleamed with malice. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll sing a different tune when you\u2019re missing a few fingers.\u201d\n\u201cEnji, stop this!\u201d Toshinori cried out, turning his sightless face toward the other king. \u201cThis is madness and you know it! Besides\u2014the boy knows nothing. He is only a guard, nothing more\u2014do you think I would trust my heir\u2019s identity with a mere footsoldier?\u201d\n\u201cYour Majesty\u2014\u201d Iida warned.\n\u201cLet him go, Enji,\u201d Toshinori said. \u201cTorturing him will gain you nothing. My son\u2019s true name is known only to me.\u201d\nKing Enji turned to him slowly. Hatred hardened his features to cold stone. \u201cSo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI have you in my custody, and you offer your life to me willingly?\u201d\n\u201cMy life, yes,\u201d Toshinori replied. \u201cNothing more than that. It\u2019s me you hate, isn\u2019t it? Well, I am here before you, blind and helpless. You have me at your mercy. Kill me, if that satisfies you, but I will never let you have anything else.\u201d\nEnji struck him across the face. Toshinori\u2019s head snapped to one side, and blood trickled from his mouth, but he made no sound. \u201cI once dreamed of defeating you,\u201d Enji snarled. \u201cSuch a pathetic dream that turned out to be.\u201d\n\u201cCoward,\u201d Iida spat.\n\u201cYou have nothing left,\u201d Enji went on, ignoring him. \u201cYour kingdom is lost to marauders. You\u2019re blind, crippled\u2014a wasted skeleton, a shell of your former self. Why do you defy me still?\u201d\n\u201cI am fighting the only way I can, for reasons you will never understand.\u201d Toshinori replied, as the bandages dampened over his eyes. \u201cIt is nothing less than love for my son. I have watched him grow, from the day I met him as a child to the day I named him my heir, and I will happily die for his sake. For hope for his future. His happiness.\u201d The smile he gave was a bloody one. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it, Enji. Our sons will be so much more than either of us ever were.\u201d\nPrince Shouto stared at him, wide-eyed. King Enji\u2019s eyes blazed with fury.\n\u201cYou heard him.\u201d For once, Enji\u2019s voice was quiet, trembling with fury as he addressed one of the guards standing over Iida. \u201cHe\u2019s of no use to us. Kill him.\u201d\n\u201cEnji, no!\u201d Toshinori roared.\nThe words had scarcely left his mouth when the cries from beyond the walls finally reached them. The guards froze in alarm, poised to strike Iida down. The king whipped around, rigid with shock.\nA single scream rose above the others, and before the shocked eyes of all those in the courtyard, a lone thrashing figure rose up above the top of the wall. It was one of King Enji\u2019s guards, shrieking as he fell the wrong way, higher and higher until he was too small to see. Another guard, stationed on the wall itself, toppled backward into the courtyard with three arrows protruding from his chest.\nOn the other side of the wall gates was an ominous explosion, followed by several more. The gates shook with each one, until they finally slammed inward.\nKirishima barreled in like a juggernaut, carried forward by the force of his own charge. He skidded to a halt, chest heaving, as an arrow glanced off his skin as harmlessly as if it were stone. Not far behind him strode the still-nameless prince, with Uraraka by his side. With them were Bakugou and Kaminari, and what looked to be only the front of a crowd of armed city folk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting on to dawn, Your Majesty.\u201d The prince\u2019s voice rang out clear above the cries of the crowd. \u201cHave you found my name?\u201d\nThe king\u2019s flames crackled like thunder in his fury. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cYour citizenry, King Enji,\u201d the prince replied. \u201cThey wanted to see how the game ended.\u201d At the look of rage on Enji\u2019s face, the prince smiled. \u201cAre you surprised, Your Majesty? I did tell you what I intended to do. Shout the answers to the riddles in the streets, remember? Name you an oathbreaker to your own people.\u201d He held up the scroll in one hand, and inclined his head to Prince Shouto. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt to have the authority of the Crown Prince himself behind me.\u201d\nThe king bared his teeth. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t put down a simple revolt? Have the perpetrators executed?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like to execute an entire city, you can certainly try,\u201d the prince retorted. \u201cI was almost amazed, Your Majesty. It\u2019s as if your subjects were waiting for an excuse to turn on you.\u201d\n\u201cLittle brat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLoyalty costs so little, King Enji,\u201d the nameless prince taunted him. \u201cA kind word. A helping hand. A promise kept.\u201d His teeth showed sharp and white as he spoke. \u201cTo think a cheap king like you tried to buy me.\u201d\nBefore the king could form a reply, day broke.\nThe sun rose above the horizon, touching the edges of buildings and turning the sky from inky blue to purple and orange. The wall might have hidden it otherwise, but with the gates open, no one could deny that dawn had come. A cheer rang out from the small army at the gates, and the guards at King Enji\u2019s back faltered.\n\u201cMy name is Izuku.\u201d The prince\u2019s smile shone brighter than the rising sun. \u201cI am King Toshinori\u2019s hand-chosen heir, and I have beaten you twice now in a single night. You\u2019ve lost, Your Majesty.\u201d\nEnji\u2019s grip tightened on his sword, and he rounded upon the blind king that knelt at his feet.\nNo one saw Prince Shouto move. No one saw him snatch a sword from one of the shocked guards\u2014not until he stood between his father and the blind king, blades ringing as they clashed.\n\u201cEven you would betray me, Shouto?\u201d Enji snarled. \u201cYou might be spared execution for being my son, but there are far worse things than death!\u201d\n\u201cI am done with waiting,\u201d his son hissed back, eyes burning with cold anger. \u201cI am done with surviving. This ends now.\u201d His eyes turned to Prince Izuku. \u201cThere will be more guards coming from inside,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you handle them?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in your debt,\u201d Izuku replied.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouto\u2019s left side lit up with flames, while ice spread across the ground from his right. \u201cI\u2019m still repaying mine.\u201d\nA battle broke out in the courtyard, as guards raced from the palace and angry citizens poured in to meet them, led by Prince Izuku and the three former palace servants. Uraraka charged the guards holding Iida and her king alone. One she sent screaming into the sky, the other she wounded before she cut Iida\u2019s bonds and pressed a dropped sword into his hands. Izuku joined them, and together they formed a shield around King Toshinori, protecting the blind man from harm.\nIn the midst of it all, the rebels gave their king and prince a wide berth. Fire danced and leapt, ice creaked and groaned and shattered, and blades clashed viciously.\nAnd when the dust and the blood finally settled, the courtyard was strewn with dead. A few citizens, but far more guards, lay lifeless on the grass.\nKing Enji knelt among them, wounded and unarmed, with the point of his son\u2019s sword pressed to his throat.\nHis hateful eyes locked with Shouto\u2019s. \u201cGo ahead, boy. Kill me.\u201d\n\u201cI should.\u201d Shouto\u2019s voice was cold. \u201cFor what you did to my mother, I have the right. But I won\u2019t. I\u2019m not like you, Father. I don\u2019t need to kill to get my way.\u201d He raised his head and looked around, eyes alighting on one of his father\u2019s own dead guards.\n\u201cPrince Shouto?\u201d Iida stepped forward. \u201cHe may be a difficult prisoner. If I can assist you in any way\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat man there,\u201d he said, nodding toward the dead guard. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying shackles that block magic. I have a feeling we\u2019ll need them.\u201d\nBy the time the sun had fully risen above the horizon, the former king had been dragged down to his own dungeons, and the dead had been carried out of the courtyard for burial. The moment his father was secure, Shouto ran immediately to a secluded tower of the palace, unlocked a door for the very last time, and freed his mother from her long imprisonment. When she was told what had passed, she collapsed in tears of relief and remorse, as her own long ordeal was finally over, as well. The prince wept as well, and years-old hurts finally began the long journey toward healing.\nIt took quite some time for Prince Izuku to stop crying from relief, or for his blind father to release him from his joyful embrace. When the tears had finally run their course, the queen was freed and cared for, and the wounded were in the care of the smiling old healer woman from the city, Prince Shouto quietly drew him aside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s done, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Izuku said, before Shouto could speak. \u201cThe challenge. All the death and fear.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s done,\u201d Shouto replied. \u201cYou won it, after all.\u201d He hesitated, looking toward the sunrise. \u201cMy father broke his oath,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will not. You told me before, that you didn\u2019t need the reward that was offered, but\u2026 if you would ask it of me\u2026\u201d He bit his lip, and turned to look at Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is it you ask of me?\u201d\n\u201cI had plans,\u201d Izuku replied. \u201cI took the challenge because I hoped to end the conflict between our kingdoms, and to gain a strong ally\u2014my kingdom needs friends, these days. But I also meant what I said before.\u201d He met Shouto\u2019s eyes. \u201cI saw you in the tower, on the morning of the execution. I saw how sad you were. How trapped you were. You looked like you needed help.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Shouto admitted. \u201cAs for the rest, I\u2019d say that any bad blood between our countries ended with my father\u2019s reign.\u201d His eyes glinted with fierce determination. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s aid you need, then you shall have it. Your enemies are mine.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku said, with a soft sigh of relief. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d He stepped closer, and clasped the other prince\u2019s hands warmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bully or manipulate you into anything. I don\u2019t want you to see me a certain way because you were forced, or because you think you have to. But, since neither of us are interested in marriage, then\u2026 perhaps I might have a chance to court you properly?\u201d The other prince\u2019s scarred face flushed crimson, and he went on hastily. \u201cL-like I said\u2014only if you want to! But if you do, then\u2026 I\u2019d like to win you over the right way.\u201d\nShouto\u2019s eyes softened as he looked at his fellow prince. Slowly, he lifted one of Izuku\u2019s hands and pressed it gently to his lips. \u201cYou say that as if you haven\u2019t won me over already.\u201d\nA soft smile came unbidden to Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cHumor me?\u201d\nShouto lowered their hands and returned the grin. \u201cNo more riddles?\u201d\n\u201cNot for a while,\u201d Izuku replied. \u201cIt\u2019s your decision to make, Prince Shouto. As it should have been from the beginning.\u201d\nThe next kiss came to the corner of Izuku\u2019s mouth, soft and feather-light. \u201cI like the sound of that, Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one for you,\u201d Izuku whispered in his ear, many months later when battles were won, invaders routed, cities freed, and old wounds and scars slowly healing.\n\u201cAsk away,\u201d Shouto murmured back, and Izuku recited the rhyme as soft and lilting as a song.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis thing all things overpowers\n\n Freezes, burns, creates, devours,\n\n\n Breaks what heals and heals what breaks,\n\n\n In equal measure it gives and takes,\n\n\n Molds the world and conquers man,\n\n Tell me what it is, if you can.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Shouto thought for a moment, his lovely eyes far away and bright. When he answered, it was not immediately with a word, but a kiss. Izuku melted against his side, so close that you could hardly tell where one ended and the other began. Shouto did not speak again until all the thoughts had fled from Izuku\u2019s mind.\n\u201cLove,\u201d he whispered, so close that Izuku could taste the word. \u201cThe answer is love.\u201d\nIzuku smiled into the kiss. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always?\u201d"
