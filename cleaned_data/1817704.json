    "text": "So, Stiles is not a pervert. For the record.\nFirst of all, Scott\u2019s been getting all buddy-buddy with Isaac now that he\u2019s moved in, despite the whole Allison/Isaac thing, so he basically talks about nothing but Isaac nowadays. Stiles has been told\u2014by both Scott and his father, separately, which only adds insult to injury\u2014that he needs to learn to share and this will therefore be very good for his personal growth. Or something. But that hasn\u2019t been going so well, because Isaac is a douchebag, and he tends to tune out when Scott starts up about Isaac.\nSecond, they\u2019re on Scott\u2019s bike, which is very loud. Plus, the wind. Plus, Stiles is wearing a helmet.\nWhich brings him to number three\u2014the helmet that he\u2019d picked up at the thrift store, when Scott became his ride to school every day (and isn\u2019t that a weird role reversal) while the insurance company hems and haws about Stiles\u2019 poor Jeep, is not\u2026 Well, the helmet itself is in perfectly good shape. It\u2019s just that the chinstrap is broken. So whenever Stiles rides on the bike, he has to hold the helmet on his head with one hand, and cling to Scott for dear life with his free arm.\n(Dad must never find out about this.)\nWhat it comes down to is that he\u2019s not a pervert. He just wasn\u2019t listening to Scott, for very good reasons.\nSo he totally can\u2019t be blamed for almost missing it when Scott yells something about Derek being\u2026 endowed?\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d Stiles bellows, when the words belatedly register.\n\u201cDEREK!\u201d Scott yells.\n\u201cHE\u2019S WELL-ENDOWED?\u201d Stiles yells back.\nScott rolls to a stop at a red light and immediately swings around to stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWha\u2014don\u2019t look at me!\u201d Stiles protests. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said it!\u201d\n\u201cI said he\u2019s back in town,\u201d says Scott, horrified.\nOooooohhhhh.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cRight. Huh. I thought he\u2019d be gone longer. It\u2019s only been, what, two weeks?\u201d\n\u201cThree,\u201d Scott replies.\nStiles shrugs.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a nice place,\u201d Scott says. \u201cLike I think he\u2019s actually paying for this one.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can picture that,\u201d Stiles says. He tries. \u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t do it. Give me details. Does he have throw pillows? Drapes? A welcome mat? Oh my God, tell me he has one of those Wipe Your Paws welcome mats.\u201d\n\u201cUh. No,\u201d Scott says slowly.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get him one,\u201d Stiles decides. \u201cCan you picture his face? What\u2019s his address?\u201d\nScott doesn\u2019t laugh. \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\"I mean\u2014don\u2019t you think he\u2019s been through enough?\u201d Scott asks tentatively. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a\u2026 I mean. It\u2019d be one thing if it were me. Just, maybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but his face,\u201d Stiles insists.\nScott bites his lip, frowning, but then the light turns green and the discussion gets left behind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter school, Stiles bikes to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, intent on buying a welcome mat for Derek. It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s actually staring his options, though\u2014there\u2019s an adorable one with a border of paw prints around the edge\u2014that Scott\u2019s words come back to him. It takes all of a minute for Stiles to decide that\u2026\nYeah. This is sort of jackass thing to do. It makes him feel all twisty and sick inside, when he really thinks about it.\nBut actually, now that he\u2019s here, it would be sort of nice to get Derek a housewarming present. A real one. Derek has had kind of a shit\u2026 life\u2026 and when Stiles really thinks about doing something nice for Derek, it makes him feel all twisty and warm inside. It\u2019s a nice feeling.\nAfter much deliberation, Stiles gets Derek a very nice set of maple wood stirring spoons, buys a big green bow to stick to the pack, and plays the most terrifying game of Knock Knock Zoom Zoom he\u2019s ever played in his life dropping it off at Derek\u2019s door.\n(He thought about gift-wrapping it, but they only had red wrapping paper at home, which seemed a bit insensitive. Also, if it had been wrapped, Derek probably would have thought it was a bomb and thrown it out. Or left it for his least-favorite neighbor. Derek\u2019s a jackass like that.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only an hour later that Derek comes tumbling through Stiles\u2019 window and immediately stomps over to him and snarls, \u201cWhat the hell are these?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 spoons?\u201d Stiles says, looking up from his homework.\n\u201cI\u2019d. Noticed,\u201d Derek says through gritted teeth. He comes to a stop at Stiles\u2019 desk, glaring fiercely, spoons held tight in one clenched fist. He looks like a homicidal Gordon Ramsay.\nStiles stares. \u201cAaaaannd?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Derek demands. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a joke, or if you were being serious, but this completely inappropriate, Stiles. You can\u2019t just\u2014do things like this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, with gratitude like that, it\u2019s no wonder no one ever does anything nice for you,\u201d Stiles snaps, stung.\n\u201cNice? You call this nice?\u201d\nStiles stares. \u201cIs this a cultural difference thing? Do werewolves not give presents? Should I have given you a broken leg as a housewarming gift instead, maybe a nice case of wolfsbane poisoning?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, you got me sex toys,\u201d Derek says flatly.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Stiles\u2019 jaw hangs open. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nDerek brandishes the note that Stiles had left with the spoons. \u201cDear Derek,\u201d he reads. \u201cI got you the good kind so they won\u2019t snap on you. The one with the holes in it is seriously the best. If you\u2019re ever interested in a partner, give me a call. Stiles. XOXO.\u201d\n\u201cCooking!\u201d Stiles flails. \u201cI meant a cooking partner, oh my God!\u201d\n\u201cYou signed the note with X\u2019s and O\u2019s!\u201d\n\u201cThose were ironic X\u2019s and O\u2019s,\u201d Stiles moans.\nDerek stares at him incredulously.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI just wanted to get you something nice, okay? Not everyone is secretly trying to bone you.\u201d\n\u201cYou got me a housewarming gift,\u201d Derek says, disbelieving. \u201cYou. Got me a housewarming gift. You, who hate my guts and would happily see me bleed out in the street.\u201d\n\u201cOh my God, not really,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cWere you never a melodramatic teenager?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice spoons,\u201d Derek accuses, frowning down at them.\nJesus Christ.\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, they are. And actually, if you look on the little tags, they\u2019re the ones they use at the CIA. Which is totally not the CIA you\u2019re thinking of right now, by the way, it\u2019s the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Culinary Institute of America,\u201d Derek says impatiently. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, deflating.\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\nStiles sighs, because there are so many, many things he wants to say to that.\nDerek scowls and thrusts the spoons at him. \u201cTake them back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Stiles says, pushing himself backwards in his rolley chair. \u201cWe just went over this, dude\u2014they\u2019re nice cooking spoons! You can use them for sauces and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cTake them back,\u201d Derek insists.\nStiles sets his jaw. \u201cI threw out the receipt.\u201d\n\u201cThen you can have them.\u201d\n\u201cI already have a set,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cStiles, I don\u2019t need your\u2014\u201d Derek\u2019s face twists up. \u201c\u2014your pity. Take them back.\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t need pity,\u201d Stiles says exasperatedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t get you pity. I got you spoons. Useful spoons! Nice spoons!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nStiles makes a face. \u201c\u2019Cause\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I was there, and they were there, and I thought I\u2019d buy them for you. To say thanks or something. Okay?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s left eye twitches.\n\u201cI should have just gotten you a bomb,\u201d Stiles grumbles.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d says Derek.\nStiles waves a hand. \u201cGo away. Take your spoons. I have to finish writing an essay for a book I didn\u2019t read.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t leave. He looms there awkwardly for a few minutes, while Stiles scrolls through the Spark Notes for chapter four again and does his best to act natural.\n\u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God?\u201d Derek eventually asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d Stiles sighs, tapping the abandoned book that\u2019s sitting on his desk.\n\u201cI liked that book,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou should read it.\u201d\n\u201cYou read it? Hey, awesome! Wanna help me write about how Janie\u2019s identity vacillates between black and white, and how this affects the theme of racism presented in the novel?\u201d Stiles asks hopefully.\n\u201cThat would be cheating,\u201d Derek says, frowning at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re opposed to cheating,\u201d Stiles says incredulously, actually turning around to stare at him. \u201cYou.\u201d\nDerek frowns harder. \u201cEducation is important.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting my brain. Go away.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014sorry,\u201d Derek mutters. \u201cFor yelling, earlier.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s you. I\u2019m pretty much used to it.\u201d\nDerek scowls, but Stiles no longer has time for this, and plugs himself into his essay with renewed effort. He will be in bed before two, tonight. This is going to happen. He is going to get four hours of sleep and it is going to be fucking glorious.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t get four hours of sleep. His Adderall wears off completely around one, and he gets sucked into TVTropes for nearly an hour before he realizes it, and it\u2019s another twenty minutes before he can pull himself off and force himself back to his paper. Then he has nightmares courtesy of the Nemeton, and before he knows it he\u2019s dragging himself out of bed for mandatory 6:15 a.m. lacrosse conditioning sessions.\nStiles lightning edits his paper in the library on a bathroom break during history (Lydia gives him the most judging look in the history of ever), turns it in next period, and by economics the only thing keeping him awake are Scott\u2019s helpful, periodic pencil-shanks. Thankfully, Finstock spends most of the class on an anti-cheating rant, because he\u2019d found a soda bottle with test answers written on the inside of the label in his trashcan on Monday. Now everyone is going to retake the test on Friday. Oh, joy.\nStiles manages to drift deep enough into sleep that he has a very brief, strange dream in which Derek is sitting in the back of their economics class, nodding along with Finstock\u2019s rant sanctimoniously. He\u2019s wearing a button-down shirt and glasses.\nThe glasses are really hot, actually. And now Derek\u2019s lowering them, turning to stare at Stiles over the thick black rims of his glasses, tongue poking out to lick his\u2014\nScott pencil-shanks him, and Stiles jerks awake again.\nWhen lunch time finally arrives, Stiles opens his locker to cycle out his book load and finds a warm, greasy bag of takeout with extra curly fries, a chocolate milkshake, and two five-hour energy shot bottles.\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles breathes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLydia raises an eyebrow at him, when he plunks his lunch down at the table.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks defensively. \u201cI know it\u2019s not healthy. I am aware of my life choices right now.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your girlfriend supports them wholeheartedly?\u201d Lydia asks archly.\n\u201cMy\u2026 what?\u201d\nLydia points a finger at the takeout bag, and Stiles sees exactly what she\u2019s talking about.\nThere, scrawled in black marker on the side, is \u201cXOXO\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: Derek\n I\u2019m so happy about the food and caffeine I\u2019m not even going to ask what creepy method you used to find out that I was majorly sleep-deprived today. And, you know, my locker location and combination.\nFrom: Derek\n Now we\u2019re even.\nTo: Derek\n What? You didn\u2019t owe me anything.\nFrom: Derek\n The spoons.\nTo: Derek\n OMG. DUDE. You really don\u2019t understand the concept of gift-giving, do you?\nTo: Derek\n Seriously, man, it totally negates my gift if you just give me one right back. What am I supposed to do now?\nFrom: Derek\n Nothing\nTo: Derek\n Nope. Unacceptable. Prepare to be un-gift-negated.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt ends up taking Stiles a few days to un-gift-negate Derek. He\u2019s busy with his standard insane load of homework, which is temporarily more insane now that he has to re-study for his economics midterm, plus lacrosse conditioning, sleeping and the nightmares that now come coupled with that, and also, it takes him a while to think up a present for Derek that isn\u2019t more kitchen supplies.\nAll told, it\u2019s Saturday afternoon before Stiles is chaining his bike to the rack outside Derek\u2019s apartment, gift in hand. It\u2019s wrapped this time, in red, because if Derek is going to be a stupidhead gift-negator, then he can deal with red wrapping paper.\nStiles knocks and doesn\u2019t run away.\nDerek opens the door and promptly scowls at him.\n\u201cFor you!\u201d Stiles announces, thrusting the present forward. \u201cI promise it\u2019s not a bomb.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would it be a bomb?\u201d Derek demands, even as he\u2019s handling it like one.\n\u201cYou know someone would give you a bomb,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDon\u2019t even front with me. Look at your track record. You\u2019re clearly escalating toward a bomb.\u201d\nDerek glares, and for a second Stiles\u2019 heart stops at the sound of claws ripping through\u2014\nWrapping paper.\nRight.\n\u201cYou totally could have done that with your fingers,\u201d Stiles accuses.\nDerek smirks, and shreds the wrapping paper some more with his unnecessarily huge claws.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just making a mess,\u201d Stiles complains.\nWhen the last of the wrapping paper falls to the floor, Derek turns the book over to read the title.\nThe Zombie Survival Guide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for Peter,\u201d Stiles says helpfully.\n\u201cThis is a terrible gift,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cWhat? No! This is just as useful as the spoons, if not more. It\u2019s educational, which is apparently important to you, I had a dream about it the other day and everything\u2014and! And! Constant vigilance. You\u2019re all about constant vigilance. I know you are. So\u2026\u201d Stiles gestures at the book. \u201cNow you can know what to look for.\u201d\n\"You had a dream about me,\u201d Derek says flatly.\nStiles flushes. \u201cUh. Yeah. Don\u2019t look at me like that, it\u2019s normal! I bet you\u2019ve dreamed about me, too. You dream about people you know. I know you. You know me. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s not. Stop looking at me like that!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cIs not!\u201d\nDerek smirks. \u201cYes it is.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek looks down at The Zombie Survival Guide pointedly.\n\u201cYeah, but the thing is, we\u2019re two different kinds of assholes. I\u2019m a funny asshole. You\u2019re just an asshole. Totally different assholes,\u201d Stiles explains. He pauses and frowns. \u201cHey, isn\u2019t it kind of weird that we call it an asshole, isn\u2019t it? The body part, I mean. Like, how come we have an asshole, but we don\u2019t have faceholes, or noseholes, or\u2026 side-of-headholes? Like, shouldn\u2019t the asshole have its own name, too?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s called the anus,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles deflates. \u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d\nDerek sighs and stares down at the book. \u201cLet me guess. You threw out the receipt?\u201d\n\u201cAnd I already have my own copy,\u201d Stiles confirms.\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Derek mutters.\nStiles preens. \u201cHell yeah.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Derek sighs. \u201cNever mind. Are you leaving any time soon?\u201d\n\u201cNow that you have been appropriately un-gift-negated, yes,\u201d Stiles says, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around. Or not. I dunno.\u201d\nDerek raises his eyebrows.\n\u201cBye!\u201d Stiles says, and waves.\nDerek shuts the door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwix, Red Vines, Cow Tails, Mountain Dew, Pepsi. Twix, Red Vines, Cow Tails, Mountain Dew, Pepsi. Twix, Red Vines, Cow Tails, Mountain\u2014Derek!\u201d\nDerek looks up long-sufferingly from his spot in line for the register.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles says, with a wave.\n\u201cHi, Stiles,\u201d Derek sighs.\n\u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d Stiles says brightly. \u201cAt the, uh, gas station. Didn\u2019t realize you were here. The Toyota just doesn\u2019t stand out like the Camaro did, you know? Hey\u2014what happened to that thing, anyway? I never asked.\u201d\n\u201cI sold it,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cBecause\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cFor charity,\u201d Derek deadpans.\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cFine. Keep your secrets.\u201d\nDerek scowls. \u201cDon\u2019t you have things to buy? Or did you just come in here to harass me?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Stiles says petulantly, even as he realizes\u2014fuck\u2014he\u2019s totally forgotten his shopping list. He gives Derek a quick grin, before whipping out his phone and texting Scott for the shopping list. Then he wanders over to the drinks aisle, because he at least remembers the Mountain Dew. He and Scott always get Mountain Dew.\nAnd Red Vines. Stiles remembers the Red Vines.\nHe\u2019s considering the Kit Kats when Scott finally texts him back.\n\nMtnd, pepsi, twix, rvines, cow tails. Plus Isaac just texted to ask for 3 musketeers. Also hurry up gas is done its cold!!!\n\n\nYou\u2019re a werewolf dude suck it up.\n\nStiles just barely manages to hold everything at once, until he goes to stand up, and the Pepsi falls to the floor. It doesn\u2019t break open, but it does hiss threateningly, and light brown fizz quickly rises at the top of the bottle.\nFuck. Shit. Balls.\nWho the fuck likes Pepsi, anyway? Douchebag, scarf-wearing, best-friend-stealers with poor taste in sodas, that\u2019s who.\n\u201cPersonal growth,\u201d Stiles reminds himself under his breath, as he picks up the soda. \u201cThis is good for you, Stiles. Sharing is caring.\u201d\nHe gets a basket, and then switches the soda out for a different one\u2014which he feels marginally bad about, but he\u2019s already pushing his limits, exchanging the sodas. Buying both of them is officially too much. Plus, doesn\u2019t soda, like, settle back down after a while? Or something?\nWhatever. After the last year, Stiles has karma coming out his ass.\nAfter paying and shoving his loot into his backpack, Stiles heads out to the parking lot and sees Derek and Scott engaged in conversation. They stop talking when Stiles approaches.\nStiles waves.\n\u201cHey, man,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI was just telling Derek that we were thinking about having pack meetings, and he should come.\u201d\nStiles raises his eyebrows. \u201cWe were?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t I tell you? Deaton said it would be a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Deaton said,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cNever mind that I suggested it like six months ago.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but six months ago, we were\u2014\u201d Scott visibly remembers who\u2019s with them. \u201c\u2014uh, younger.\u201d\nFrom Derek\u2019s expression, he knows exactly what Scott was going to say anyway. Stiles feels the inexplicable urge to apologize, but he tamps it down, because saying, \u201cSorry for reminding you about that time when you were the Alpha and had a pack and stuff,\u201d feels disloyal to Scott somehow, and also, he doesn\u2019t think Derek particularly wants an apology.\nScott looks like he\u2019s having similar thoughts.\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Derek says to Scott, with a stiff nod, and then he turns to leave.\nScott winces.\nStiles makes a face right back at him.\nNeither of them move until Derek is in his car and driving off.\n\u201cThat was bad,\u201d Scott says guiltily, eyes going in the direction that Derek had driven off in.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, bro,\u201d Stiles insists, with an indifference he doesn\u2019t actually feel. \u201cSo he\u2019s not the Alpha anymore. He can put on his big boy pants and deal with it.\u201d\nScott gives him a reproachful look.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be home in three hours for family fun night.\u201d\nScott shudders. \u201cMonopoly?\u201d\n\u201cMonopoly,\u201d Stiles says happily.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBack at Scott\u2019s house, Isaac is sprawled out on the couch like he\u2019s waiting for the GQ photographer to finish using the bathroom so they can continue the photo shoot. He\u2019s wearing a scarf. Inside. Who even does that?\nPersonal growth, Stiles reminds himself. \u00a0\n\u201cSorry we took so long,\u201d Scott apologizes. \u201cWe ran into Derek at the gas station.\u201d\nIsaac arches an eyebrow. \u201cDid you kick him in the nuts?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Scott says slowly.\nIsaac sighs, and lazily pulls himself from a sprawl into a normal sitting position to make room for the rest of them.\nStiles deposits his backpack on the couch and waves a hand at it. \u201cFood\u2019s in there. I\u2019m gonna grab some of last night\u2019s chili leftovers. Anyone else?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d Scott says, with the second guilty look of the day. \u201cWe ate it this morning for breakfast. Sorry, dude.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Stiles,\u201d Isaac says slyly. \u201cBig plans for tonight?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s famil\u2014\u201d Stiles stops short, though, because Isaac is holding up a strip of XXL condoms.\n\u201cDude!\u201d Scott says excitedly.\n\u201cAnd when I say \u2018big\u2019\u2026\u201d Isaac continues, waggling the strip.\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t mine!\u201d Stiles protests. \u201cThose\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014shit, it must have been Derek.\u201d\nThe silence is deafening.\n\u201cNot\u2014oh my God, not like that!\u201d Stiles yelps.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTo: Derek\n\nYou are the worst.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMonopoly at the Stilinski house is a rare but awesome thing.\n\u201cSo in exchange for Indiana Avenue,\u201d Stiles says, pointing to the property card in question, \u201cyou give me $80 now, and for the next six turns, I pay no parking fees on your orange or red properties, and half the fee of your green properties, unless you should place more than two houses on any of them, and then I pay seventy-five percent. And our previous deal regarding the B&amp;O and Short Line Railroads remains in effect.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you go to jail,\u201d Dad says.\n\u201cUnless I go to jail,\u201d Stiles agrees.\nDad studies the board for a long moment, and then nods. \u201cSounds fair.\u201d\nOne of the egg timers goes off, as they exchange goods.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the free parking,\u201d Dad says, as he sets it for another five minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re now down to an eighty-twenty split, if I land there.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to land on it,\u201d Stiles insists, because he hadn\u2019t surrendered that Get Out of Jail Free card for nothing.\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d Dad replies easily.\nStiles blows on the dice for good luck just before he rolls, and prays for a five, seven, or something higher than a nine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Monday, Scott has to go to school an hour earlier to meet with Coach Finstock\u2014what they have to talk about for an hour at five o\u2019clock in the morning, Stiles doesn\u2019t know\u2014so Stiles is biking to school. Scott offered to pick Stiles up at quarter to five, but Stiles\u2019 life basically revolves around sleep, and biking means he could sleep ten minutes more, so\u2026 biking it is.\nHe\u2019s huffing and puffing his way up Sacramento Ave, regretting all the life choices that have led to him being too paranoid to wear headphones while biking, when he sees it. It\u2019s a flash in the corner of his eye, barely visible in the morning darkness, and it\u2019s only instinct that makes him stop.\nBlood.\nThere\u2019s a thin river of it flowing from the alleyway between Chipotle and Hearty Wares\u2019 Hardware. It\u2019s mostly dried, but there are portions that still glitter with wetness. How long does it take for blood to dry? Stiles feels like this is something he should know.\nHe stays on his bike, just in case he needs to get away, and awkwardly toes his way forward to line up with the alley.\nThere\u2019s a body pushed up against the first of a row of dumpsters, partially bisected by the ripped-off lid of said dumpster. It\u2019s gruesome enough that it takes him almost a full minute to realize that the body is Derek.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Stiles says, and drops the bike, rushing forward. \u201cShit, shit, shit.\u201d\nHe rips the lid out of Derek\u2019s side with a grunt, and the immediate gush of blood makes him remember that you\u2019re not supposed to do that. \u00a0\n\u201cShit,\u201d he hisses, and for a moment he wildly contemplates shoving it back in. \u00a0\nBut Derek\u2019s breathing.\nDerek\u2019s a werewolf. Right.\nStiles hefts the lid into the nearest dumpster and crouches in the veritable lake of blood surrounding Derek\u2019s body. His hands hover uselessly over the gaping wound, fluttering in the air, before finally settling on Derek\u2019s shoulder and hip. Intestines disappear before his eyes as dense pink-white fascia knits itself back together.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d Stiles says, and swallows convulsively. One of his fingers twists in Derek\u2019s belt loop.\nDerek coughs weakly, and Stiles just barely keeps himself from flailing back on his ass. Blood dribbles out of Derek\u2019s mouth. \u00a0\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles tries, awkwardly patting at his face. It\u2019s even more beard-y than usual. \u201cDude, you should definitely be awake right now, because there is no way I\u2019m hauling your ass out of here. You\u2019re like two of me. C\u2019mon. Wake up.\u201d\nHe gets a gurgle and some more blood, which is less than promising.\nStiles takes in a breath and glances around the alley for\u2014he doesn\u2019t even know. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, looking down at Derek and forcing himself to think. \u201cOkay. Uh. Scott! Right, right. Scott. He can help.\u201d\nHe fumbles for his phone, grips Derek\u2019s shoulder with his free hand for balance, and presses the Scott shortcut on his main screen.\nThe call goes to voicemail.\nRight. Finstock.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Stiles says, and hangs up. He realizes too late that the voicemail recorder was on, but whatever. He looks down at Derek again, at his misshapen side that is healing way too slowly for a werewolf, and\u2014 \u201cSeriously, dude, look at your clothes. You\u2019re literally soaked in your own blood. I mean, like, you look like you\u2019re encrusted into the ground. That is so gross. Did you know that you can use meat tenderizer to remove blood stains? Like, the powder. Not the scary metal hammer thing. You can use ammonia, too\u2014that\u2019s what I use\u2014but the smell\u2019s really awful, so it must be even\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Stiles.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014oh my god you\u2019re awake\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek croaks.\nStiles shuts up.\nDerek coughs, and then groans.\n\"Yeah,\u201d Stiles says, wincing in sympathy. \u201cThere was sort of a dumpster lid in your side. It was mega gross. Hey, werewolves can\u2019t get infections, right? Because I don\u2019t even want to think about the bacteria that grow on dumpsters. Ew.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Derek insists, though he rasps it out with all the lung capacity of an asthmatic kitten, so Stiles is less than reassured.\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Stiles says skeptically. \u201cSure.\u201d\nDerek grunts and sort of twitches.\n\u201cCan you, like, stand?\u201d Stiles asks, eying Derek\u2019s side.\nDerek gives him a withering look.\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Stiles says, throwing his hands up. \u201cI\u2019m fresh out of stretchers, bud.\u201d\n\u201cGo get my car, dumbass,\u201d Derek snaps.\n\u201cAnd what? Carry you over to the backseat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the Walgreens on Fifth,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBy the time you get back I should be able to stand. Keys are in my pocket.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s like seven blocks away!\u201d Stiles protests.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Derek grunts.\nStiles huffs and shoves a hand into Derek\u2019s pocket. \u201cFine. You\u2019d better not die while I\u2019m gone. What even happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cDumpster diving gone wrong,\u201d Derek says. \u201cObviously.\u201d\nStiles abandons the keys to pinch Derek\u2019s thigh through the fabric of his pocket.\n\u201cCan you not,\u201d Derek growls, eyes flashing blue, but it\u2019s not much of a threat considering that he can barely lift his head.\n\u201cCan you not tell me the truth? If there\u2019s some new big bad in town, we really need to know,\u201d Stiles retorts.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was just an omega, all right?\u201d Derek sighs.\n\"Did you kill it?\u201d Stiles asks, head whipping up, but there\u2019s no mauled corpse sprawled in the alleyway or suspicious limbs hanging out of any of the dumpsters.\nHe looks back down at Derek in time to see him, with great effort, raise his head up enough to shake it. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d Stiles breathes, relieved.\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, bad. Bad. Obviously, that\u2019s bad. Just, you know, dead bodies are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStiles, go get the damn car.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles bikes to Walgreens, and ends up having to walk up and down the rows of cars while hitting the unlock button on Derek\u2019s fob, because the soccer mom car is a lot harder to find than a Camaro\u2014seriously, why did Derek give up that car\u2014which has to look suspicious as fuck. Eventually, he realizes that when Derek said, \u201cat the Walgreens on Fifth,\u201d he didn\u2019t mean in the parking lot. He meant, literally, the car was stopped on the side of the road in front of the Walgreens.\nJesus Christ. Derek must have so many parking tickets by now. How does he still have a driver\u2019s license?\nThen Stiles takes forever and a day to figure out how to get the seats to fold down so he can load his bike, because apparently someone in the car industry was concerned that people weren\u2019t using their owner\u2019s manuals enough in today\u2019s modern age. He doesn\u2019t end up having to pull out the owner\u2019s manual. It\u2019s a close thing, but eventually he gets all the right buttons pushed in and levers pulled out-then-down-then-up, and the seats bow down before him as they well should.\nWhen he pulls up to Chipotle, Derek is not standing there waiting for him. Instead Stiles gets to haul Derek to his feet and play human crutch while Derek hobbles his way over to the car, bitching all the way. Stiles dumps him in the passenger seat with less care than is strictly considerate. There\u2019s going to be blood on the seat, but Stiles figures that Derek must be a pro at blood removal by now.\nMaybe he just gets a new car when the current one gets too bloody? Maybe that\u2019s what happened to the Camaro.\nScott calls, halfway to Derek\u2019s apartment.\nStiles, being a conscientious driver, doesn\u2019t pick up. Instead he presses ignore and thumbs his way to the text screen without looking, and holds out the phone to Derek.\n\u201cHey, be useful. Text Scott and tell him I\u2019m not dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does he think you\u2019re dead?\u201d Derek mutters as he jabs at the screen with one finger, the phone resting in his lap.\n\u201cI called and left an empty voicemail when I first found you,\u201d Stiles answers. \u201cHe was in a meeting, so he probably just saw my call now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of meeting does Scott have at six in the morning?\u201d Derek grouses, like he\u2019s the one being dragged out of bed for it, not Scott.\n\u201cLacrosse captain meeting thing,\u201d Stiles replies, waving a hand to indicate the lofty yet vague importance of high school varsity athletics. Which Derek should well understand, given the number of times in the past year werewolves and lacrosse have interceded to unfortunate ends.\nThere\u2019s a pause, and then\u2014\n\u201cScott wants to know where you are.\u201d\nNot at lacrosse practice, that\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s no way Stiles is going to make it onto the field in his gear in the next ten minutes. Finstock\u2019s going to tear him a new one.\n\u201cSaving hairy, ungrateful werewolves, like usual,\u201d Stiles sighs.\nDerek doesn\u2019t reply, but when Stiles glances over at a stoplight, he\u2019s sourly pecking out another text.\nBy the time Stiles parks the car in front of Derek\u2019s apartment building, Derek is holding his own head up, and though he needs help getting out of the car, once he\u2019s on his feet and his side has stopped gushing fresh blood, he can walk on his own. Mostly. Stiles, however, has visions of Derek passing out in the elevator and creating lots of paperwork for his dad and Ms. McCall when someone calls 9-1-1, so he follows him in.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Stiles,\u201d Derek insists breathlessly, as he gimps along at a speed that a legless, bullet-ridden zombie could overtake.\n\u201cHumor me,\u201d Stiles says.\nKeeping one eye on Derek, he pulls out his phone to text Scott about the Omega that got away. This is the conversation history that greets him, when he thumbs up the lockscreen:\n Stiles:   Not dead\n Scott:   Where r u?\n Stiles:   V busy bein a jackass ttyl\n Scott:   Lol what?\n Scott:   Stiles? Practice in 5!!!!\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being a jackass!\u201d Stiles complains, looking up to glare at Derek\u2019s blood-encrusted back. \u201cAlso, I can\u2019t believe you used TTYL. Correctly.\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek huffs, \u201cmy generation invented chatspeak.\u201d\n\u201cYour generation,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cOkay, grandpa.\u201d\nDerek gimps along without a response, but Stiles just knows that he\u2019s rolling his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles unlocks the door to Derek\u2019s apartment while Derek leans against the wall next to him, sending showers of dried flakes of blood to the ground. It doesn\u2019t occur to him until he\u2019s held the door open for Derek and is looking around for a place to put Derek\u2019s keys\u2014a rack, a bowl, anything\u2014that he\u2019s inside Derek\u2019s apartment.\nIt\u2019s kind of\u2026 sad. Barren. The only thing of real note is a bookcase against the wall that\u2019s crammed with books that are clearly old. The Zombie Survival Guide, with its shiny white plastic spine, stands out starkly against the faded cloth maroons, blues, greens, and browns. The fact that his book there at all, instead of in a trash bin, is definitely surprising.\nDerek trips halfway down the hallway and goes flying into the wall with a loud smack, and Stiles swears.\n\u201cThis is what you get for not calling for backup,\u201d he snipes, hauling Derek away from the wall and slinging one bloody arm over his shoulders. \u201cJesus, you weigh a ton. Are we going to the bathroom or your bedroom?\u201d\nDerek makes a face. \u201cBedroom.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\u201cUnless you want to take a shower with me?\u201d\nAaaaand now Stiles is picturing just that. God dammit.\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d He flounders, desperate to get that out of his head at any cost. \u201cBut\u2014your sheets!\u201d\nDerek is apparently recovered enough to roll his eyes at Stiles. \u201cI can buy new sheets, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cOr, you know. Wash them. You unenvironmental, consumerist heathen.\u201d\nDerek just grunts.\nStiles elbows Derek\u2019s bedroom door open, and finds it to be equally barren. There\u2019s a bed\u2014not the California king that had been in the loft, just a full sized bed with only one stack of pillows, which makes Stiles\u2019 heart feel funny even though this is not at all the time or place\u2014and a mismatched dresser and nightstand that have both seen better days. Taped to the wall just above the nightstand is a photo of Derek and Cora, both in sunglasses, sharing some alcoholic drink the size of a fishbowl. They\u2019re both grinning so widely they have dimples.\nStiles didn\u2019t know Derek had dimples.\nHuh.\nThe bed is unmade so Stiles just dumps Derek onto it. Derek manages to fall mostly in line with the pillows, and only has to shift himself over a little bit to get comfortable. As comfortable as anyone can be after nearly being cut in half, anyway.\nStiles starts undoing the laces of Derek\u2019s boots. \u201cYour feet had better not stink.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have lacrosse practice?\u201d Derek huffs, and toes off the boot that Stiles has finished loosening.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cMissed the beginning. If I turned up now, I\u2019d just be running suicides until the start of school. I was gonna crash on your couch and take a nap, then bike to school.\u201d He looks down at himself, then belatedly adds, \u201cAnd, uh, maybe borrow some of your clothes. I kind of look like an extra in a horror movie.\u201d\nDerek snorts. \u201cSure. Good luck finding something that fits your skinny ass.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing baggy is my style,\u201d Stiles retorts.\n\u201cMm,\u201d says Derek, smirking, and yeah, Stiles lost that one. Whatever.\nHe roots around Derek\u2019s Goodwill dresser\u2014the middle drawer sticks so badly that when Stiles manages to get it open, he nearly gets knocked to his ass, which makes Derek snicker\u2014until he finds what he knows to be the tightest outfit Derek owns.\nAnd no, he is not going to explain to anyone why he knows exactly which pair of jeans and which black t-shirt to seek out from Derek\u2019s wardrobe. That\u2019s between him, himself, and\u2026 him.\n(And maybe sometimes his right hand.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nScott keeps giving him weird looks in economics. Eventually, when Finstock has stalked over to the other side of the room to yell at Greenberg, Stiles kicks Scott\u2019s sneaker.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he hisses.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott hisses back.\n\u201cYou. With the faces.\u201d\nScott gives him his biggest, saddest puppy dog eyes.\nStiles kicks his sneaker again. \u201cYou know what face, jackass. Is this about lacrosse this morning?\u201d\nScott\u2019s face scrunches up. \u201cSort of? But also, dude, you kind of smell like Derek.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 mouth opens, but no words come out.\n\u201cLike, a lot,\u201d Scott adds.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cAre those his clo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMcCall! Stilinski!\u201d Finstock barks. \u201cThank you for volunteering. Up to the board, right now, it\u2019s time to find us some elasticities.\u201d\nThey exchange oh shit  glances with each other, and scramble for a board when Finstock tacks on an irritated, \u201c Now!\u201d\nStiles means to talk to Scott after class, but Finstock holds him after class to ask him about missing lacrosse this morning.\nFinstock doesn\u2019t scream, which is weird. Instead he gets weirdly serious, and says, \u201cStilinski. I\u2019m gonna be honest, kid\u2014you aren\u2019t looking too hot these days. I know you\u2019re keeping your grades up, but you just keep showing up to school looking more and more tired. You couldn\u2019t even get a goal past Greenberg Monday morning.\u201d\nStiles shrugs and picks at a thread on his backpack strap. It\u2019s true.\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve got going on, you\u2019ve got to sort it out. We need you on the team. So, you know, if you gotta haul your ass down to the guidance counselor, or find a support group, or hell, do some of that hippie-dippie meditation crap\u2014just do it and get better.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, planning to do exactly none of that.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t miss practice,\u201d Finstock says, like Stiles doesn\u2019t know that already. \u201cI can keep you on if you\u2019re too tired to know which end of the stick to hold, or if your grades start to slip, but you can\u2019t miss practice.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well. Don\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d Finstock tells him.\nStiles nods.\nFinstock nods back, like they\u2019ve made real progress here, and lets Stiles go to his next class.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAre you dead? Stiles texts Derek, during lunch.\nNot dead sux 4 u, Derek replies, the asshole.\n\\\\/\\\\/4`/ 70 937 /\\\\/\\\\`/ |-|0|D35 (_)|D, Stiles replies.\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t your father know you\u2019re not supposed to be texting in school?\u201d Lydia drawls.\nStiles looks up. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cYour father,\u201d Lydia repeats. \u201cOr are you texting your mysterious fast-food girlfriend?\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Stiles looks around, but all the people that he could feasibly be texting are at this table except for Allison, who\u2019s eating lunch outside with Isaac. \u201cIt\u2019s just Derek. He was just letting me know about\u2014something. Nothing important.\u201d\n\u201cYou were smiling,\u201d Lydia says.\nStiles blanches. \u201cIt was a facial tic.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d\nStiles needs to find new, less perceptive friends.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuring biology, Stiles gets a text from Derek.\n0/\\\\/\\\\394 |)34|)\u00a0\nBalls.\nWhatever. He\u2019d probably cheated and found a 1337 translator on the internet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Stiles has Scott stop by Derek\u2019s apartment on the way to school. He has a brown paper bag with Derek\u2019s clothes in it, as well as a jar of meat tenderizer, and instructions for how to use it to remove blood from fabric, printed out from WikiHow (with pictures). On the outside of the bag he\u2019d written NOT A BOMB.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott says, when Stiles gets back out, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on with you and Derek?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles replies, and it\u2019s true. Mostly. \u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019re gonna be late for practice.\u201d\nScott gives him a weird look, but hands Stiles his helmet and lets it drop.\nDefinitely new friends.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles doesn\u2019t miss lacrosse practice again that week, and somehow, he isn\u2019t given makeup laps for Monday\u2019s absence. He\u2019s pretty sure that it\u2019s because Finstock is genuinely worried that the extra mileage might do him in, especially when Stiles shows up for Tuesday morning conditioning and spends a solid two minutes trying to fit his right hand into his left glove.\nHe spends the entirety of Wednesday evening researching \u201cimagery rehearsal therapy\u201d, which is supposed to be a miracle cure for nightmares. The idea is that you take a nightmare you\u2019ve had, reimagine it so that it\u2019s happier or whatever, and then try to hang on to the image of the reimagined nightmare throughout the day. He\u2019s skeptical about the efficacy on supernatural nightmares, but he figures it can\u2019t hurt to try.\nNext on the list is lucid dreaming.\nThen polyphasic sleep.\nAnd if those don\u2019t work, Stiles is pretty sure his only other options are drugs, or living like this indefinitely\u2014neither of which sound appealing.\nHe knows that Scott and Allison aren\u2019t having these problems. It\u2019s just him. And it\u2019s weird because Stiles had thought that of the three of them, he\u2019d had the strongest connection with his anchor. He\u2019d been in love with Lydia for years. Allison had only started her thing with Isaac weeks ago, at the time, and Scott had only been working for Deaton for a year. When they\u2019d went under, Stiles hadn\u2019t been afraid that Lydia wouldn\u2019t pull him back\u2014he\u2019d been afraid that he would be the only one to survive.\nPart of him wishes that they were having these nightmares, too. He\u2019s a horrible person like that.\nHe wonders, once or twice, if Derek would have any advice. Granted, Derek probably shouldn\u2019t advise on any matter more complicated than \u201cHow do you make a PB&amp;J sandwich?\u201d, but Stiles can\u2019t imagine that Derek hasn\u2019t been plagued with nightmares, given the\u2026 everything\u2026 of his life. He must have some way of dealing with them, after a decade.\nThe problem is that Derek has a real apartment now. And a soccer mom car. And dimples.\nSo, no, Stiles is not going to bring up Derek\u2019s shitty past just when he seems like he\u2019s finally moving on.\nPlus, Derek\u2019s coping method for nightmares probably involved horrible self-flagellation and the capitalization of werewolf healing powers. Stiles will stick to methods that are science-tested and human-approved, thank you very much.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Friday morning, Stiles finds his own clothes waiting for him inside his bike helmet, in the garage. It takes him a moment before he realizes that these are the bloody clothes that he\u2019d left at Derek\u2019s on Monday, and a closer examination reveals that the bloodstains are gone.\nIt takes him even longer to realize that his cheeks hurt because he\u2019s smiling so wide. He can\u2019t help it. Derek actually used the meat tenderizer, and the thought makes his heart swell like a balloon.\nThen he goes to pick up the helmet by its sad broken strap, ready to go outside to wait for Scott, when he realizes that\u2019s not his helmet.\nThis helmet is new. It\u2019s nice. It has a working strap, and lots of plush padding on the inside, and even a visor for his face.\nBright, sharp irritation lances through his happiness and Stiles whips his phone out, scowling.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?!? The tenderizer was like $5, WTF??\n\nHe thinks about leaving the helmet and forcing Derek to take it back later, but his old one isn\u2019t anywhere in sight, and knowing Derek, it\u2019s probably already on its way to a landfill, in pieces. The asshat. So he storms out of the garage, leaving his clothes because he can\u2019t even deal with those right now\u2014Derek cleaned his clothes and bought him a new helmet, seriously, he can\u2019t\u2014and stands in front of the house.\nA minute later, when Derek hasn\u2019t responded, and Scott still hasn\u2019t shown up, Stiles starts texting again.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t even a gift, dickface\n\n\nSeriously I just threw it in the cart at the grocery store. And paid with dad\u2019s card. It was just some POWDER\n\n\nThis is so unnecessary I can\u2019t even\n\nHe\u2019s pacing the driveway by the time Derek texts back with, Protective headgear on the road is always necessary, Stiles. Helmets reduce accident fatalities by 40%\nStiles flails in the driveway, nearly sends his phone flying across the yard, and fires back with, THAT\u2019S IT. PREPARE FOR WAR, ASSHOLE.\u00a0\n\u201cDude! Nice helmet!\u201d Scott says, when he finally deigns to show up.\n\u201cDo not,\u201d Stiles hisses, poking a vengeful finger in his direction.\nScott blinks. \u201cUh. Okay. Awful helmet.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles agrees, jamming it onto his head with a scowl. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat night, he takes Dad\u2019s car to Target and spends most of his meager savings stocking up on gifts, and also a ludicrous amount of time selecting a wrapping paper that is just the right shade of electric blue. Scott and Isaac are having a Mario Kart night, and Stiles was invited, but video games are yet another area where werewolf powers give them an up, and Stiles isn\u2019t in the mood to have his ass kicked all night to the tune of Isaac\u2019s snide comments and mouth breathing. Plus, Stiles has a war to start. He can build character later.\nOn Saturday, he gives Derek the absolute tackiest picture frame that could be found, with things like SISTER, BROTHER, LOVE, FAMILY, and FRIENDS FOREVER carved into it. Also, hearts. Attached to the wrapping paper is a note that reads, this is what a gift looks like dumbass\nOn Sunday, he gives Derek a tub of hot cocoa mix, a bag of marshmallows, and a recipe card with instructions for Snowman Soup &amp; Snowman Poop, complete with a drawing of a half-melted snowman. The note for this one reads: WINTER IS COMING.\nOn Monday, he gives Derek tea, honey, and sugar cubes and a note that reads, in case werewolves can\u2019t have chocolate, though dogs actually react to the theobromine in chocolate, which is also in tea and sodas, just in lesser amounts, so don\u2019t kill yourself with the tea either\nOn Tuesday, the station has a Thanksgiving potluck, which means that Deputy Manning brings out his mammoth deep fryer and deep fries five turkeys, much to Dad\u2019s excitement and Stiles\u2019 horror. He almost has a heart attack himself when this year, Dad tries to bring home a container of leftover turkey.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Stiles declares, making a grab for it, but Dad is too quick. \u201cThis is not the deal, Dad. You don\u2019t get leftovers!\u201d\n\u201cNo one else wanted them,\u201d Dad says, dancing away.\n\"A likely story,\u201d Stiles snipes, feinting left and then diving right\u2014but Dad outmaneuvers him again, and he swears under his breath.\n\u201cShould have played basketball like your old man,\u201d Dad says, smirking even though he\u2019s panting a little. \u201cTold you not to go out for lacrosse.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, give me a big stick, and we\u2019ll see who ends up with the turkey,\u201d Stiles retorts.\nDad laughs, and then somehow manages to fake Stiles out, despite the fact that Stiles is twenty-five years younger and just tried that. But Stiles flies after him and catches up easily, snatching the container out of Dad\u2019s hand with a yell of triumph and sprinting the rest of the way to the car.\n\u201cThis is not going in the house,\u201d Stiles declares, when his winded father finally catches up. \u201cDo you know how unhealthy this is? One bite of this is like a week of non-meat protein for you.\u201d\n\u201cStiles\u2026\u201d Dad groans.\n\u201cTofu,\u201d Stiles says threateningly. \u201cQuinoa. Chickpeas. Lentils.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Dad says, holding up his hands in surrender. \u201cFine. Give it to Scott and Melissa. You win.\u201d\nStiles punches the air in victory.\n\u201cMy tastebuds hate you,\u201d Dad sighs.\n\u201cYour arteries love me,\u201d Stiles replies, and then beats Dad to the driver\u2019s side of the car.\nHe drops Dad off at home, claims he\u2019s going over the McCall\u2019s to drop off the turkey leftovers, and then heads to Derek\u2019s place instead. Derek was supposed to get winter window clings today, with snowflakes and snowmen and adorable little squirrels in fuzzy hats, but Stiles thinks he\u2019ll appreciate the turkey more. He wonders if Derek has Thanksgiving plans. Dad is working most of the day, so Stiles will just mooch off the McCalls and then bring home leftovers for family fun night.\nThe lights in Derek\u2019s apartment are on, which is good news, because Stiles needs to steal borrow something from Derek\u2019s apartment in order to set up another one of his presents. He\u2019s been waiting for Derek to be home all week.\nWhat does Derek even do? Where does he go?\nStiles imagines Derek lurking on the highest rooftop in Beacon Hills\u2014the Red Roof Inn off the highway\u2014and broodily staring out at the city. Shirtless. In skin-tight jeans. Hair too heavily gelled to whip in the wind.\nHis snickering stops, though, when he sees that Derek\u2019s door is open.\nDerek never leaves his door open. Ever.\nStiles fumbles for his phone and approaches the door cautiously, ears pricked for noise, but he can\u2019t hear anything. That\u2019s good, he thinks. Werewolf fights are loud.\nHe sets the container of turkey down in the hallway as quietly as he can, and tries not to think about the fact that if there are evil supernatural creatures in there, they definitely already know that he\u2019s out here in the hall. Stiles pulls out his phone and taps out a text to Scott, 911 at Derek\u2019s apt, with shaking fingers and hovers his thumb over the send button as he knocks on the door.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d he calls, hoping that if something\u2019s wrong, Derek will yell out something helpful like, \u201cRun away, Stiles, a vampire is eating me!\u201d\nBut there\u2019s no answer.\nStiles cautiously pushes open the door, every muscle prepared to run, wildly thinking that he should really ask Dad for some police academy training in how to safely clear a building\u2014but there\u2019s nothing in there.\nThe living room and kitchen are clear, and undisturbed\u2014although there\u2019s so little there in the first place that \u2018undisturbed\u2019 doesn\u2019t really mean much. The lights are on, and Derek\u2019s keys are on the counter. His boots are by the door. There are dishes in the sink, and a sage green henley slung over the back of the couch.\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles calls again, moving toward the hallway, still ready to press SEND and flee at a second\u2019s notice. He is going to kill Derek if he gets brutally murdered because of this damn turkey. And his dad, for trying to take it home. And Deputy Manning, for owning such an unnecessarily huge deep fryer in the first place.\nThe bathroom and bedroom are also empty and undisturbed.\nWhat if Derek\u2019s been kidnapped? What if he\u2019s dead?\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says out loud, and then flinches and glances at Derek\u2019s closet\u2014which he hadn\u2019t had the balls to open\u2014but nothing jumps out.\nHe swallows, and heads back for the living room.\nDerek isn\u2019t dead. He doesn\u2019t die. He gets brutally tortured, maimed to the brink of death, and then somehow always appears hale and hearty a few days later, like nothing ever happened (haha, get it, hale and hearty, oh god Derek\u2019s probably dead\u2014)\nThe door opens and Stiles snatches the first book within reach, opens his mouth to scream, pushes down on SEND\u2014\nIt\u2019s Derek.\nShirtless, a gallon of Tide in one arm and Stiles\u2019 turkey in the other, and staring at Stiles first in bewilderment, then alarm.\n\u201cStiles! Put that book down,\u201d he orders.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Stiles demands, not putting the book down at all, because it\u2019s a fucking book and Derek is not dead, take a guess which one Stiles is more concerned with right now. \u201cYou left your door open! And your lights were on and your keys were here and I thought you\u2019d been kidnapped, you asshole!\u201d\n\u201cI was doing laundry,\u201d Derek snaps, crossing the room.\n\u201cLaundry? And, what, you just left your door wide open? Anyone could have gotten in! What the hell is wrong with you, you never leave your door open! I thought we had hunters, or another Alpha pack, or fucking vampires eating your face off\u2014fuck, I texted Scott, fuck, fuck, fuck\u2026\u201d\nHe scrambles to text Scott that it\u2019s a false alarm, never mind, don\u2019t show up, but halfway through Derek snatches the book out of his hand.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch the books,\u201d Derek grits out, placing it back on the shelf. \u201cThose are expensive, and they belong to my clients, who will not be happy if a three hundred-year-old spine breaks because some idiot teenager threw it at my head.\u201d\n\"I thought you were vampires! \u201d Stiles says, flailing in indignation, then pausing when the rest of the sentence sinks in. \u201cWait, clients? You have a job?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says stiffly.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles breathes. \u201cNo, wait, wait, I have to text Scott and tell him not to come flying to the rescue, then you can tell me all about it.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you all about it?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cDuh,\u201d Stiles says, finishing the text. He follows it up with, Seriously this is Stiles, not an evil person , and after some thought, In first grade I peed on your sandcastle because you were sad the moat had no water.\nA moment later Scott replies with, You peed on it because you were a little asshole. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\nAll good, Stiles responds, and refocuses on Derek.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a job?\u201d\n\u201cYou brought me this,\u201d Derek answers, shoving the turkey container at Stiles.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, not taking it. \u201cLeftover deep-fried turkey that my dad is not allowed to have, because of stupid human things like high cholesterol and clogged arteries. And while we\u2019re off topic, do you always do your laundry shirtless? Do you get a discount?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek deadpans. \u201cThe coin machines see me and go \u2018Oh, baby, you wash for free.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDo they make a pun about your washboard abs?\u201d Stiles asks, waggling his eyebrows.\nDerek sighs and turns toward the kitchen.\n\u201cI\u2019m a font of comedic genius!\u201d Stiles calls after him.\nDerek doesn\u2019t reply.\nWhen he looks down, Scott has texted him back with, Dude, why are you at Derek\u2019s place anyway?\nStiles locks the phone and slips it into his pocket, then bounds after Derek. \u201cHey! You didn\u2019t tell me about your job! What do you do with old books?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Derek asks, long-suffering.\nHe\u2019s bent over as he stores the turkey in the fridge, and Stiles has no problem helping himself to the view.\n\u201cBecause you work with old books and shit, it\u2019s got to be a cool job, whatever it\u2014hey, you used my hot chocolate!\u201d Stiles says happily, distracted by the supplies on the counter.\nDerek looks at the hot chocolate and marshmallows like they\u2019ve betrayed him, and if Stiles didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say that Derek\u2019s ears were turning pink. \u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, turning to glare at Stiles. \u201cDid you think I was going to throw it away or something?\u201d\nStiles shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. No. Did you like it?\u201d\nDerek nods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best,\u201d Stiles agrees. He hesitates, and then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s recipe.\u201d\nDerek looks surprised for a moment, but then he raises and eyebrow and asks, \u201cAnd I guess you named it?\u201d\nStiles laughs. \u201cYou\u2019d think\u2014but no, my mom named it, too. Hey, wait, we\u2019re off topic again! Your job, dude!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that interesting,\u201d Derek sighs.\n\u201cI bet it is,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cI\u2019m a rare books dealer,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI find buyers for books I have, and I find books for buyers. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cThat is cool!\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cOh my god, did you ever get one of those books bound in human skin? Did you have to sniff it to tell if it was real?\u201d\n\"\u2026No,\u201d says Derek.\n\u201cTo which?\u201d\n\u201cTo both.\u201d\n\u201cDoes human skin leather have a distinct scent, or does it just smell like cow leather?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Derek asks.\nStiles shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re the one always wearing leather, dude. Just extrapolate.\u201d\nDerek gives him a flat look that does not bode well for extrapolation. Whatever. Stiles will just Google it.\n\u201cSo, do you have a degree in library science or something?\u201d Stiles asks, and wanders back into the living room to get a second look at Derek\u2019s bookcase now that he knows it\u2019s for work. Although\u2014 \u201cHey, if these are all for your clients, then why is the zombie guide here too?\u201d\n\u201cWhere else was I going to put it?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cAnd yes, my master\u2019s is in library science. My undergrad was in linguistics. I mostly work with European literature.\u201d\nStiles groans. \u201cSeriously? Why does everyone around me speak like twelve languages? Did my parents get left out of some town-wide donation of Muzzy tapes?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m only fluent in Spanish,\u201d Derek says, and when Stiles glances back to give him a skeptical look, his arms are folded over his chest. \u201cReally. I know only enough from each Western language that I can recognize the books I need to.\u201d\n\u201cSo, like, Polish?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cHello? It\u2019s the language of my people,\u201d Stiles says obviously.\n\u201cI thought the language of your people was 1337,\u201d Derek replies.\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cMy people have many languages. We\u2019re culturally diverse like that. Are you avoiding the question because your Polish sucks?\u201d\n\u201cNie jestem,\u201d Derek replies, a bit grumpily, and Stiles grins.\n\"Sweet. One day, if you\u2019re really good, I\u2019ll show you my real name, and we\u2019ll really see how good you are at your pronunciations,\u201d he promises.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be home by now?\u201d Derek asks, unimpressed. \u201cIn bed, ready for school tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, dude, you no longer literally live under a rock, so you have no excuse for not knowing that it\u2019s Thanksgiving on Thursday.\u201d\n\"I didn't forget about Thanksgiving, Stiles,\" Derek snaps, glaring.\n\"Sure thing, big guy. Hey, do you have plans? Like with Cora or something?\"\nDerek's entire face shuts down at the mention of Cora, and Stiles' gut twists with regret.\n\"I mean,\" he says hastily, \"Dad and I are just gonna play board games after he gets off from work that night, and probably eat whatever leftovers Scott\u2019s mom sends us. If you wanted to come. We don't play anything too weird, just the like Monopoly and Clue and stuff.\"\n\"I'll think about it,\" Derek says, looking like he'd sooner play Monopoly with the Argents.\n\"Seriously,\" Stiles presses. \"It'll be really low-key. And my dad likes you, I think. Just make sure you come in through the front door this time.\"\n\"We'll see,\" Derek says, and his face looks less like a block of granite, so Stiles is hopeful.\nDerek breaks their stare first, abruptly turning and heading down the hall, leaving Stiles with a clear invitation to see himself out. And he's about to. Really. It's just that he has to do some quick snooping.\nHe moves as quietly as he can, craning his head and examining the surfaces of the apartment.\nNot on the couch, not on the window sill, not on the counter...\nAh-ha!\nThe microwave.\nStiles creeps over and starts moving through the stack, discarding a credit card offer, a \"To Our Neighbor At\" card from Verizon, another credit card offer, a letter from Beacon Memorial Hospital, that's weird, why would Derek\u2014\n\"Stiles!\" Derek calls, making Stiles jump about six feet in the air. \"Why are you still here?\"\n\"Going! Going, going, going now!\" Stiles yells, and gathers the remaining stack of mail up before scrambling for the door.\nHe'll bring it back when he's done. Judging by the size of the mail stack, it's clear that Derek doesn't go through his mail that often anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, Stile gives Derek a sweater. And not just any sweater. The softest, warmest sweater Stiles could find for a reasonable price that also came in a neutral tone, because as fun as it would be to get Derek a lurid teal sweater, Derek would never wear something like that and the whole point of this is to show the dumbass what actual gifts are. Stiles is at war here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThanksgiving at the McCall house is always early, because the nursing shifts switch at four and Melissa always works the evening shift (she says she prefers to get the casualties of family feuds, rather than the casualties of kitchen idiocies). Stiles usually turns up early to help, but this Thanksgiving he\u2019s at the door by seven o\u2019clock because it turns out that having more time to sleep just means having more time to have nightmares. So much for his imagery rehearsal therapy.\nMelissa looks at him suspiciously when he appears in the kitchen, pausing in the middle of basting the turkey. \u201cStiles? Are you sleepwalking again?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t done that in years,\u201d Stiles protests.\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s seven in the morning, right?\u201d\nStiles nods. \u201cYep. And I am here and reporting for duty. What can I do to help?\u201d\nThe suspicious look doesn\u2019t go anywhere, which Stiles finds offensive\u2014he is a model of helpfulness, okay, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with being up early\u2014but she eventually waves a hand at a half-chopped pile of sweet potatoes.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Isaac says, when he and Scott finally stumble downstairs a few hours later to find Stiles and Melissa busily skinning potatoes, \u201cI guess the early kissass gets the worm.\u201d\nStiles flips him off.\n\u201cIsaac,\u201d Melissa reprimands, then notices Stiles\u2019 finger. \u201cStiles!\u201d\n\u201cHe started it!\u201d Stiles says immediately.\n\u201cDudes, come on, it\u2019s Thanksgiving,\u201d Scott pleads, giving both of them huge, sad eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to be nice to each other?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I think we\u2019re supposed to pat ourselves on the back for being gigantic douchebags,\u201d Stiles says snippily. \u201cIt\u2019s like they made a holiday just for you, Isaac.\u201d\nMelissa slaps him on the arm.\n\u201cOw!\u201d\n\u201cPlay nice, both of you, or no sweet potato casserole,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI made the sweet potato casserole!\u201d Stiles whines. But Scott is giving his those eyes, and dammit, Stiles hates him so much.\nThe truce between him and Isaac only lasts for so long, though.\nIt\u2019s t-minus forty-seven minutes until eating time, and thirty minutes since Melissa kicked them all out of the kitchen, when Stiles mentions that Derek might come over later that evening for family fun night. What he really wants to know is why Isaac couldn\u2019t have spent Thanksgiving with the Argents, leaving him, Scott, and Melissa to their traditional meal together, but he can\u2019t bring himself to hurt Scott like that be bringing it up. So, Derek it is.\nScott takes both eyes off the Macy\u2019s Day Parade to give Stiles a perfect copy of his mother\u2019s suspicious expression. \u201cDid you\u2026 warn him?\u201d\n\u201cWarn him about what?\u201d Stiles asks innocently.\n\u201cUh, that you and your dad play board games like crazy people?\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Stiles says, jabbing a finger at Scott, \u201cDad and I just have an advanced appreciation for strategy. Second of all, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to play poker and steal his money. And third, he didn\u2019t exactly have any other options for today.\u201d\nAnd now Scott\u2019s got the eyes again. \u201cHe didn\u2019t?\u201d he asks, horrified. \u201cBut what about Cora? Or\u2026 Or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Stiles suggests dryly.\n\u201cOh, man. I should have invited him over,\u201d Scott says guiltily. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s too late to ask him to come?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Isaac cuts in sourly. \u201cHe\u2019s not the local charity case, you know.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s our\u2014\u201d Scott flounders.\n\u201cFriend?\u201d Isaac sneers.\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 not a bad guy,\u201d Scott tries.\n\u201cHe can go fuck himself,\u201d Isaac says flatly.\n\u201cYou could be a little more grateful, you know,\u201d Stiles says, glaring at Isaac, feeling suddenly and unaccountably pissed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s saved our lives a dozen times or anything.\u201d\nIsaac snorts. \u201cOh, look at Stiles, coming to Derek\u2019s defense. Two months ago, you hated him. Remember? Or did you forget all about that when you became his latest piece of ass?\u201d\n\u201cIsaac,\u201d Scott says sharply.\n\u201cYou think Derek and I are having sex?\u201d Stiles says\u2014laughs, and he doesn\u2019t know why it comes out an octave too high. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s not even\u2014what the hell?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t even try to deny it, Stilinski. It was like a week after Jennifer Blake fell off his dick that you hopped on and you ha\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cGuys!\u201d Scott yells, eyes flashing red. \u201cCut it out! It\u2019s Thanksgiving. C\u2019mon. Just\u2014Isaac, let\u2019s go for a walk outside, okay? Stiles, can you go help Mom in the kitchen?\u201d\n\"Sure,\u201d Stiles bites out, furiously pushing himself off the couch. \u201cGo take your puppy for a walk. Don\u2019t forget the leash. Or is that what the scarves are for?\u201d\nIsaac snarls, and Scott forcibly drags him toward the backdoor.\nDouchebag, scarf-wearing, best-friend-stealers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe meal itself goes over without a hitch, if a little subdued, mostly because both Melissa and Scott seem ready to shank the first person to say anything out of line. Afterwards, Stiles unloads Tupperware from his backpack and fills up on everything but the sausage stuffing and the green bean casserole, because what Dad doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him or his arteries. Then he begs off of dishes, since he helped with the cooking, and heads home on his bike.\nStiles makes healthy green beans for his dad, instead, and does his homework, and goes for a run, and cleans the house, and is generally very busy not thinking about whether or not Derek will turn up tonight, or the fact that apparently Isaac (and Scott?) think that they\u2019re having sex.\nWhy did Scott send me a text warning me not to come tonight? Derek texts him, mid-afternoon, and unwittingly sending Stiles into a panic.\nTo: Scott\n Scott if you talk Derek out of coming over tonight I will tell him you had wet dreams about his baby sister.\nFrom: Scott\n OMG BRO CODE DUDE!!!\nFrom: Scott\n I CAN\u2019T HELP IT I LIKE STRONG WOMEN\nFrom: Derek\n Now Scott says he was lying and I should absolutely show up tonight. What\u2019s going on?\nTo: Derek\n NOTHING. Scott is a butthead. Come over.\nThree nail-biting hours later, Derek does come over. In the sweater.\nStiles is winning.\nHe\u2019s so pleased with himself he gives Derek a hug. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so soft.\u201d\nOkay, the sweater is soft. Derek\u2019s body is basically heated granite.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles apologizes, pulling back with a wide grin, because, victory. \u201cI couldn\u2019t resist. Come on in, we just heated up the leftovers. You came hungry, right? Dad! Paws off the mashed potatoes, hungry werewolf incoming!\u201d\n\u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t get a free day on Thanksgiving?\u201d Derek asks, as he stands in the entryway looking phenomenally awkward.\n\u201cHe gets one,\u201d Stiles says, and pulls Derek inside the house. \u201cI just try to minimize the damage. Come on, I\u2019ll negotiate a better handicap for you later on if you give Dad your Little Orphan Annie eyes and get him to hand over the last of the pecan pie.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard knock life,\u201d Derek says dryly, and follows Stiles into the dining room.\n\u201cHello, Derek,\u201d Dad says, when they enter.\n\u201cSheriff,\u201d Derek replies.\nIt does not escape Stiles\u2019 attention that his father\u2019s plate looks like it\u2019s increased its portions of things like sweet potatoes and gravy, while Stiles\u2019 plate only appears to have gained green beans.\n\u201cGee, Pops, you look like you could definitely spare some food for Derek,\u201d Stiles says, not at all pointedly.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d Derek starts, but Stiles shushes him and goes to get him a plate.\n\u201cYou will eat,\u201d Stiles insists, because Derek is here, in the fuzzy sweater, and now he will have delicious food and board games and Stiles will hear no complaints.\n\u201cSo, Derek,\u201d Dad says, as Stiles thunks a plate down in front of Derek and starts transferring food, beginning with his father\u2019s unnecessarily huge mound of mashed potatoes. \u201cYou like board games?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek loses horribly despite the generous handicap Stiles negotiates for him, but it was Settlers of Catan, so he did get to play until the end. Plus, his loss was for a good cause\u2014that is to say, taking down Stiles\u2019 father. Stiles sends him home with all the remaining leftovers and a bright promise to play Clue next time. Derek goes out the front door looking no less awkward and confused than he had when he\u2019d first come in.\nDad is by the stairs, waiting.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Stiles asks, guilelessly.\n\u201cDerek Hale,\u201d Dad says.\n\u201cYeeeees?\u201d Stiles asks.\nDad waits.\n\u201cI texted you! You had prior warning!\u201d Stiles says, less than ten seconds into the silence. Damn his father for being a trained interrogator. \u201cAnd he had nowhere else to go. He was going to be all alone, all day, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014you, being the kind, generous, thoughtful human being that you are, decided to open our home to him?\u201d Dad asks dryly.\nStiles glares. \u201cI\u2019m very thoughtful.\u201d\nDad rolls his eyes. \u201cStiles, I love you, but I also know you. You are kind, generous, and thoughtful with exactly two people in this world.\u201d\nThat is\u2026 okay, that\u2019s true.\n\u201cLook, Derek and I are just having a bit of a fight\u2014an argument ,\u201d Stiles corrects hastily, when his father\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cThat\u2019s all. There\u2019s nothing weird going on, or whatever you\u2019re thinking. He probably won\u2019t be over for Christmas dinner or anything.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dad says slowly. \u201cBut he\u2019s coming over again to play Clue?\u201d\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cWe never get to play Clue.\u201d\nDad doesn\u2019t exactly look convinced, but all he says is, \u201cJust so he knows that I\u2019m always Colonel Mustard.\u201d\n\u201cDerek doesn\u2019t like bright colors, anyway,\u201d Stiles says, waving a hand. \u201cHe\u2019d pick black, if it were an option. Maybe he\u2019ll be Professor Plum? Or Miss Scarlet, though maybe not, considering the whole Alpha thing.\u201d\nNow that Stiles thinks about it, Mrs. Peacock\u2019s token is sort of the exact color of Derek\u2019s eyes, but Stiles is always Mrs. Peacock, so Derek will just have to get over that. Stiles has had a crush on Mrs. Peacock\u2019s hat since he was seven and played his very first game of Clue with everything carefully balanced on his mother\u2019s hospital bed.\nHis mom was always Mrs. White. Somehow, Stiles can\u2019t see Derek going for her.\n\"Stiles!\u201d Dad calls from the kitchen, and Stiles starts, not having realized that he\u2019d zoned out for so long. \u201cWhere the hell is the rest of the pecan pie?\u201d\n\u201cBeats me!\u201d Stiles lies, and figures this is an excellent time to go hide in the shower.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Friday, Derek gets a paper-clipped set of parking tickets, pre-filled out. Stiles may or may not have a stash of his own, because it\u2019s perfectly legal and also super helpful. The note attached to these reads, since you usually end up parked illegally in the name of vanquishing evil.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSaturday morning, Stiles goes to the deep freeze in the garage, because it\u2019s where he hides the bacon and he\u2019s home alone until four today. There are many things he has genuinely learned to like, after years of pretending in order to make his father more cooperative, but turkey bacon has never been and will never be one of them.\nPlus, he\u2019s baking it. Everyone knows baked things are healthier than pan-fried things.\nBut then he opens the lid of the deep freeze, leans back to avoid the clouds of freezing white that billow out of it, and then nearly drops the lid when he sees the giant slabs of meat lying there right on top. Seriously. They\u2019re huge, and red, and plastic-wrapped, and for a moment Stiles is already starting to prepare the lecture to end all lectures for his father, but then he catches sight of the clean, empty Tupperware stacked neatly and tucked into one corner of the deep freeze.\nDerek.\nStiles lets the lid slam shut and whips out his phone.\n\u201cPlease tell me I do not have Bambi in my deep freeze,\u201d he orders, when Derek picks up.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have Bambi in your deep freeze,\u201d Derek repeats, irritated. \u201cIt\u2019s bison.\u201d\n\u201cYou killed a baby buffalo?\u201d Stiles shrieks. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBison are adult buffalo, Stiles,\u201d Derek says, like Stiles is stupid.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles insists, \u201cno, because the joke. What does the mother buffalo say when her kid goes to school\u2014it\u2019s bi-son. Sweet, innocent little baby buffalo! That you slaughtered!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u2014buffalo and bison are interchangeable, Stiles. Look it up,\u201d Derek snaps. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t slaughter it. Where the hell would I get a buffalo?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, where did you get it?\u201d Stiles fires back.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a market up in Redding that does grass-fed bison,\u201d Derek says obviously, and Stiles can just see him rolling his eyes. \u201cI drove there, and bought it, and gave it to you. Did you miss the label?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d says Stiles, and pulls the lid of the deep freeze open again. \u201cOh. Yeah. There are labels there, yes.\u201d\nHeritage Bison Farms is printed in large, cheerful bubble letters on each of the meat packages, right above the nutritional information.\n\u201cBison is\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be healthier,\u201d Derek says, but hesitant now. \u201cGood for cholesterol.\u201d\n\u201cYou got me expensive, healthy red meat. That my dad can eat,\u201d Stiles says slowly.\n\u201cYou got me a tea,\u201d Derek replies resentfully.\n\u201cYes, and the point of the tea was that it was a gift, you utter dipshit. A present. You don\u2019t owe me anything for it. Oh my God, it\u2019s not that difficult of a concept! Stop trying to get even!\u201d\n\u201cThe meat is non-returnable,\u201d Derek says smugly.\n\u201cI will get you for this,\u201d Stiles hisses. \u201cYou just wait, Derek Hale.\u201d\nAnd he hangs up the phone, feeling a brief nostalgia for the flip phone he had in middle school, which was much better for his dramatic exits. Then he heads back inside to start researching how the hell you cook buffalo. Bison. Whatever.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles shows up at Derek\u2019s apartment on Sunday afternoon, prepared.\nDerek answers his door in grey striped pajama pants and a maroon sweater with thumbholes. He\u2019s barefoot. Stiles\u2019 brain short circuits a little.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles manages, and pushes his way into the apartment. He has things to refrigerate. No time for staring at gorgeous werewolves in comfy clothing.\n\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Derek informs him.\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve got a few hours of free time today,\u201d Stiles replies, with extra brightness, because maybe he is getting into the danger zone with his sleep deprivation, but that\u2019s for later. This is for now.\nDerek folds his arms over his chest, which makes the fabric pull tight because thumbholes.\nStiles sets his backpack on the kitchen counter, which thuds heavily. He opens the front zip and removes the first items on his agenda.\n\u201cThis,\u201d he announces, presenting the plastic card to Derek, \u201cis your library card. It\u2019s good for all the Beacon County libraries.\u201d\nDerek takes the card with a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t you need proof of res\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis is your gas bill,\u201d Stiles adds, shoving the envelope in with the card in Derek\u2019s hand.\n\u201cAnd a driver\u2019s license?\u201d Derek asks, eyebrow raised, now.\nStiles waves a hand. \u201cI had a copy of that from last year. Plus, the head librarian was my mom\u2019s bestie, so she\u2019s got a soft spot for me. Which is why I also present you with coupons.\u201d He adds a stack of bright pink slips to Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cThey\u2019re each good for two dollars off of library fines. They usually give them out during Library Appreciation Week, but there are always extras.\u201d\nDerek stares at him.\n\u201cThis,\u201d Stiles continues, sticking a post-it to the coupons, \u201cis the username and password for mine and Scott\u2019s Netflix. You\u2019ve got your own profile set up\u2014it\u2019s the one with the Grumpy Cat icon. Just don\u2019t be a douche and upgrade the account to get DVDs. We\u2019ve only got the instant watch part. You\u2026 have a computer, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Derek says, scowling.\nStiles raises an eyebrow.\nDerek\u2019s scowl deepens. \u201cCora made me get it.\u201d\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Stiles says, and goes back to his backpack. \u201cAnd now\u2014and this is where the free time comes in\u2014we are going to make some delicious, heart-healthy bison chili together. I brought, like, everything we should probably need, because I have this theory that the only cooking supplies you own are the spoons I got you.\u201d\n\u201cThe bison was for your father,\u201d Derek says, still scowling.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take some home,\u201d Stiles promises. \u00a0\u201cCome on. You wanna do the veggies, or the meat? Chop chop!\u201d\nDerek just stands there as Stiles unloads the vegetables and piles them on the left side of the cutting board. The meat is at the bottom of the backpack, all the spices and cans on top, and he unloads those on the opposite counter. Eventually, Derek unsticks himself and moves into the kitchen, opening a drawer and pulling out his own cutting board.\nStiles grins, but doesn\u2019t comment. Instead he removes the bulkiest item from his backpack\u2014the pot\u2014and places it on the powerburner of the stove. He likes powerburners. Ooo, hey, Derek\u2019s stove has a simmer burner too. Sweet. They can use that later. This is gonna be delicious.\nStiles uses his knife\u2014because it turns out Derek has his own knife as well as his own cutting board\u2014to slice open the packaging of the meat.\n\u201cWhoa, dude, you recycle,\u201d Stiles says, when he discovers not one but two trashcans in the cupboard below the sink.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says stiffly.\n\u201cI mean, you know, that\u2019s cool. So do I!\u201d Stiles adds hastily. \u201cSaving the environment and all. Yeah.\u201d\nDerek moves on to the cauliflower.\nHis brain goes into overdrive trying to find something to change the subject to, something that won\u2019t piss Derek off, something that will make him happy, something\u2014\n\u201cSo where\u2019s Cora?\u201d Stiles blurts out.\nFuck.\nHe\u2019s just about to open his mouth to take it back\u2014and probably blurt out something even worse, because his mind is kind of a mess today\u2014when Derek answers, \u201cShe\u2019s in Argentina.\u201d\n\u201cWait, she speaks Spanish too?\u201d Stiles asks incredulously.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles raises his eyebrows at the meat he\u2019s cutting. \u201cWas I right about the Muzzy tapes, then?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is Muzzy,\u201d Derek says flatly.\n\u201cLanguage learning videos,\u201d Stiles says, waving his hand in the air dismissively. \u201cFor kids. It\u2019s a cartoon.\u201d\nDerek catches his wrist and forces his arm back down.\nRight. That\u2019s the hand with the knife.\n\u201cSo, what? You\u2019re both too young for Dora the Explorer,\u201d Stiles reasons, going back to cutting the meat. He\u2019s almost through. He should probably start heating the pot. The recipe said to put the burner on high, right?\nHe pulls out his phone.\n\u201cPeter\u2019s wife was from Argentina,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles almost misses it because he\u2019s scowling at the stupid recipe website on his phone that\u2019s taking forever and a day to load.\n\u201cSomeon\u2014oh,\u201d Stiles says, just barely stopping himself from blurting out, Someone married that creep? \u201cThat\u2019s, uh, that\u2019s cool. They say that the best time to learn a language is when you\u2019re, like, under the age of five. I used to speak some Polish when I was really little, you know, because my grandparents would call and it\u2019d be cute that I could say witam, babcia, and kocham ci\u0119. But I just know the basic phrases.\u201d\n\u201cSpierdalaj?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles laughs.\n\u201cOkay, yeah, I know the swear words too,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cIs the meat in a resting phase?\u201d Derek asks, cocking an eyebrow.\n\"Crap,\u201d Stiles says, and turns the burner on high. \u201cSorry. My mind is like\u2014\u201d He mimes explodey hands around his head. \u201c\u2014today. Where are my spoons?\u201d\n\u201cMy spoons,\u201d Derek corrects.\n\u201cOkay, yes, asshole, your spoons. Where are they?\u201d\nDerek points to a drawer. When Stiles opens it, the spoons are the only things in the drawer besides a cheese grater, which brings Derek\u2019s known kitchen supplies up to six in number.\n\u201cSo, is Cora with your aunt\u2019s pack? Ex-pack? Or do you guys merge with marriage? How come Peter didn\u2019t join her pack?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s with her pack, yes. It\u2019s where she went after the fire,\u201d Derek says. When Stiles looks over, he\u2019s de-seeding the bell pepper with smooth strokes. \u201cWe don\u2019t merge packs. And she\u2014Aunt Addie moved to California to get her Ph.D., and didn\u2019t want to leave. She never formally left her pack. The marriage was more of a\u2026 favor.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa. Peter was okay with that?\u201d\nDerek snorts. \u201cPeter did as he was told.\u201d\n\u201cAre arranged marriages, like, common in werewolf\u2026 society?\u201d Stiles asks, eyebrows sky-high.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not uncommon. It\u2019s a good way to make an alliance.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 eyes practically bug out. \u201cAre you kidding me? Dude, I am so glad you\u2019re no longer Alpha, there is no way I would ever do that.\u201d\nAnd, oh, shit, there he goes again with his mouth.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he adds, wincing. He focuses on stirring the meat in the pot.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have married you off, anyway,\u201d Derek replies, sounding genuinely amused. Stiles looks over to make sure, and yep, he\u2019s steadily dicing the pepper, a smirk on his lips. \u201cYou would have been shipped back to us in a week, alliance or no.\u201d\n\u201cI will have you know that I am a gift to this world,\u201d Stiles declares, leveling his wooden spoon at Derek.\n\u201cTruly,\u201d Derek agrees dryly.\n\u201cI\u2019m making you dinner, jackass. Where would you be without me? In-and-Out?\u201d\nDerek smiles with all his teeth. \u201cI\u2019d just hunt up some baby buffalo.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHave you seen baby buffalos? They\u2019re adorable. Like little fuzzy cows. Teddy bear cows.\u201d\n\u201cYour meat\u2019s burning,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cShit! Ugh, no, it\u2019s just stuck to the stupid pot.\u201d\nStiles chisels at the chunks of meat until they come free, leaving little brown imprints on the pot, but whatever. They\u2019ll soak off when the chili is simmering later.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek sighs, \u201cget out of the kitchen before you hurt yourself.\u201d\nStiles looks up, offended. \u201cWhat? Dude. I am the head chef right now. You are the sous chef. You can\u2019t kick me out. There will be no sous coup.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not kicking you out,\u201d Derek says, rolling his eyes. \u201cJust\u2014go sit on the couch. Where\u2019s the recipe?\u201d\n\u201cNo! This is part of you learning to accept gifts. You\u2019re not getting out of this,\u201d Stiles declares.\n\u201cYour gift to me can be not burning down my apartment,\u201d Derek replies, and edges Stiles away from the stove.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles huffs, and hands his phone over. \u201cRecipe\u2019s on there. All my other tabs are porn videos\u2014you have been duly warned.\u201d\nDerek nearly drops the phone, and his head shoots up to give Stiles an \u2018are you fucking kidding me\u2019 look.\nStiles waggles his eyebrows.\nOkay, so all his other tabs are meditation/relaxation websites that he\u2019s been using to put himself to sleep, under the theory that if you fall asleep calm you stay calm throughout the night. No luck so far, but he kind of likes the website that guides you through breathing exercises while flying you through space.\n\"Like I needed to know that,\u201d Derek snaps, dropping the phone on the counter, and it might be Stiles\u2019 imagination but he thinks Derek\u2019s ears are pink.\nHuh.\n\u201cYour meat\u2019s burning,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek growls in frustration and grabs the wooden spoon out of Stiles\u2019 hand.\nStiles smirks and grabs his backpack off the counter, heading out of the kitchen. He has something else in his bag for Derek, and this is the perfect time to distribute it. He\u2019s like Mary freakin\u2019 Poppins today.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles says, as he pulls out the set of cheery winter window clings. \u201cWhat\u2019s new in the book biz?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek replies.\n\u201cOkay. You\u2026 kill any Omegas lately?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBefriend any neighbors?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cReceive any bombs?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, shut up.\u201d\nStiles grins, and presses a snowflake to the window.\nHe\u2019s got a pretty sweet design going on Derek\u2019s window, and is debating whether he should extend it to Derek\u2019s bedroom window or just embellish on what he already has out here, when Derek finally notices.\n\u201cStiles, what the hell are you doing to my window?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s festive!\u201d Stiles says, and when he glances back, Derek is scowling at the window and has his arms crossed over his chest.\nStiles decides against his plan to try for Derek\u2019s bedroom window.\n\u201cTake them down,\u201d Derek orders.\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re stupid.\u201d\n\u201cYou need more stupid, happy things in your life,\u201d Stiles argues. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you.\u201d\nDerek sighs and casts his eyes up to the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really not.\u201d\n\u201cGo cook the chili, Derek,\u201d Stiles says, pointing at the kitchen.\n\u201cSit down and shut up, Stiles,\u201d Derek shoots back.\n\u201cHey, buddy, you\u2019re the one that started this conversation,\u201d Stiles says, raising his hands in innocence. \u201cI was being completely silent until you were all, \u2018Stiles, why are you putting pictures of squirrels in fuzzy hats on my window, I am a grinch and repulsed by such adorableness\u2019 and then I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSit,\u201d Derek repeats, and punctuates it with the wooden spoon, jabbing it at the couch. \u201cRead your stupid zombie book. Don\u2019t touch any of the other books.\u201d\nStiles exhales, but drops the remaining sheet of window clings and goes over to the couch. He doesn\u2019t grab the zombie book, mainly because the material hits a little too close to the content of some of his dreams and that is not conducive to his imagery rehearsal therapy. Instead he sprawls out, feet hanging off the arm of the couch, and stares up at the ceiling.\nIt feels like he only blinks, and the sun is almost set and Derek is setting a steaming bowl down on the floor next to his head. It smells delicious.\n\u201cOh my god, your couch is way too comfortable,\u201d Stiles complains, pulling himself upright. Shit, how long had he been asleep? With no nightmares, even.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that,\u201d Derek promises from somewhere else in the apartment.\nStiles grabs his bowl from the floor. \u201cWhat the hell, dude, this looks awesome. I mean, minus points for the lack of cornbread, sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits, but still. Have you been holding out on us this whole time with your secret mad cooking skills?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s chili, Stiles,\u201d Derek says exasperatedly, emerging from the kitchen. He\u2019s got his own bowl. \u201cA trained monkey could make it. And I thought the point of the chili was that it was healthy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, but not for me. My dad\u2019s the one with heart problems.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in the same boat one day?\u201d Derek asks.\nStiles shrugs. \u201cProbably. But, you know, gotta take advantage of the metabolism while I\u2019ve got it. Plus, let\u2019s face it, as the token human in a pack of werewolves, my odds of surviving long enough to worry about my cholesterol are basically nil.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows lower severely at that, but he doesn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cSit,\u201d Stiles instructs, patting the spot next to him. \u201cStop looming over there like a weirdo.\u201d\nDerek sighs, like this is his least favorite chore in the world. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving after this, right? There\u2019s not a singing telegram waiting for me outside my door or anything?\u201d\n\u201cDude ,\u201d Stiles says, his mind immediately jumping to the handful of drama people in Beacon Hills High School who can actually sing and could be cheaply bribed into doing just that\u2014and the most important questions, what song will they sing?\n\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Derek sighs, sitting down on the couch heavily.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Stiles says fervently.\nDerek glares at him over his bowl of chili.\n\u201cWhy are you sitting all the way over there?\u201d Stiles asks, suddenly noticing that Derek is crammed against the opposite arm of the couch, instead of the spot that Stiles had so generously patted for him. He grins with all his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d\nDerek is unimpressed.\nStiles rolls his eyes and shifts a foot closer.\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Stiles asks, innocently shifting even closer.\n\u201cStiles.\u201d\n\u201cThere are broken springs,\u201d Stiles lies shamelessly, moving closer still. \u201cI think you\u2019re sitting on the only good part of the couch.\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you just complaining that the couch was too comfortable?\u201d Derek asks through gritted teeth.\n\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d Stiles says instead, just as he presses right up against Derek and settles in comfortably. \u201cAnd you\u2019re really warm, goddamn. That\u2019s a werewolf thing, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says stiffly.\n\"Awesome,\u201d Stiles declares. Then he takes a bite of his chili, and moans. \u201cOoooh my god, this is somehow even tastier than it looks. How did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cJust shut up and eat,\u201d Derek snaps, and when Stiles looks over, he\u2019s\u2014yes, that is in fact, Derek Hale, blushing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, buddy,\u201d Stiles says sympathetically, patting him on the thigh, which somehow makes Derek go even more rigid. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with me.\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t relax an inch.\nBut gradually, as Stiles rambles on about the upcoming Twilight movie while they eat, the tension drains out of Derek\u2019s body until he\u2019s cautiously relaxed against Stiles, like a normal person. Stiles is pleased.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo one is willing to deliver a singing telegram for less than $50, and Stiles is close to broke after his Target run for Derek, so it looks like that\u2019s not going to happen unless Stiles himself does it. Which. The point is to give Derek a present, not more nightmares. Anyway, when Stiles leaves Derek\u2019s apartment on Sunday evening, he\u2019s feeling good. Derek has a library card, coupons, Netflix, adorable window clings, and half a pot of delicious yet heart-healthy bison chili. He and Derek are basically friends, now. Stiles didn\u2019t even really get him presents this time.\nBut no. Apparently none of this friendship, gift-giving stuff has sunk into Derek\u2019s thick skull, when Stiles comes home on Wednesday to discover a brown paper bag waiting for him in his room.\n\u201cYou\u2019re got to be kidding me,\u201d Stiles mutters, and throws his backpack on his bed before stalking over to the bag on his desk.\nHe\u2019s going to throw it away. Whatever ridiculously expensive present Derek has gotten him now, Stiles is going to throw it out, because Derek needs to understand that Stiles isn\u2019t doing him favors. He\u2019s not indebted to Stiles. No one\u2019s keeping a ledger.\nStiles grabs the bag and opens it, peering inside, and finds\u2014\nRocks.\nDespite himself, Stiles snorts.\nA second look reveals that the rocks are actually stones, round and polished, and there seems to be some kind of rope in the bag with them. Curious, Stiles dumps it all out onto his desk to get a better look.\nIt\u2019s a chain of stones, like a giant necklace. Each stone is about the size of a golf ball and has a hole bored into the middle, and the stones are tightly woven together with some sort of twine or hemp or something. Even with Stiles\u2019 human nose, he can tell that the stone chain smells like earth and smoke. Some kind of incense. Stiles picks it up and strings it between his hands. It\u2019s probably four feet long, and heavy.\nIt takes him a few moments to notice that there\u2019s writing on the other side of the bag.\n\nput it on the floor, at the end of your bed\n\nThat\u2019s it. No explanation.\nStiles sighs, and opens up his computer to start researching.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: Derek\n Stop trying to repay me for my presents, asshole. It\u2019s bad manners.\nFrom: Derek\n Then stop giving me presents.\nTo: Derek\nNot gonna happen, jackass.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStiles hits the snooze button on autopilot. He pulls the covers up, burying his face a little deeper into the crease between his pillow and the comforter, hating lacrosse more than anything else in the world. What a stupid sport. And it\u2019s raining, and cold, and it\u2019s December now so Finstock will really start stepping up practices in preparation for the coming season. Thursdays are cardio days, which mostly means distance running with bouts of sprinting thrown in because why not.\nOn the bright side\u2014if there can be a bright side to being dragged out of bed at ass o\u2019clock in the morning to go run through the freezing rain for a sport that no one outside of Beacon County and a few prep schools on the East Coast actually cares about\u2014Stiles is actually feeling more rested than usual. That\u2019s good. Yesterday, he\u2019d fallen asleep on Scott\u2019s back while they were riding to school, which had been mega embarrassing. Thank God he had that new helmet, because the old one would have fallen right\u2014\nWait.\nWait, wait, wait.\nHe slept.\nStiles\u2019 eyes fly open and immediately seek out the chain of adder stones lying on the floor at the foot of his bed.\n\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he swears, because now there\u2019s no way he can throw it out.\nFucking Derek. Stiles will show him. He is going to end this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d Lydia observes, turning in her desk to follow his progress.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says guardedly, and forces himself not to look down at his fingers. He is awake. He knows this.\nLydia\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cUh. Adder stones. They\u2019re these stones with holes in the center, they were popular during the Middle Ages\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know what they are, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says sharply.\nStiles frowns.\nLydia\u2019s expression softens. \u201cI\u2019m glad that they work. You look better.\u201d\n\u201cThanks?\u201d Stiles says.\nLydia looks like she wants to say something else, but she doesn\u2019t. She turns back around in her desk and opens her notebook, and doesn\u2019t look at Stiles again for the rest of class.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom: Scott\n Dude why is Derek on our netflix?\nTo: Scott\n You put Isaac on there last month\nFrom: Scott\n Can I come over tonight? Just me, no Isaac or anything\nTo: Scott\n Sure\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo: Lydia\n Hey, you know that you weren\u2019t the problem, right? As my anchor. You\u2019re an awesome anchor.\nFrom: Lydia\nClearly not.\nTo: Lydia\n If you weren\u2019t, I would have died in that tub. You pulled me out.\nFrom: Lydia\n You have the adder stones now. It\u2019s fine.\nTo: Lydia\n YOU ARE THE BEST ANCHOR\nTo: Lydia\n YOU ARE THE BEST ANCHOR\n\nTo: Lydia\n\n\nYOU ARE THE BEST ANCHOR\n\nTo: Lydia\n I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY\nTo: Lydia\n REALLY I CAN\nTo: Lydia\n YOU ARE THE BEST ANCHOR\nTo: Lydia\n YOU ARE THE BEST ANCHOR\nFrom: Lydia\n OKAY. Fine, I\u2019m a good anchor. Stop texting me, it\u2019s inappropriate for my phone to vibrate this much at the dinner table.\nTo: Lydia\n :D\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis has to be, Stiles has decided, the gift to end all gifts. The freaking adder stones actually worked. Or maybe it\u2019s psychosomatic, but psychosomatic probably doesn\u2019t work on supernatural psyche invasions. Whatever. The point is, he\u2019s well rested, and he\u2019s pissed that he\u2019s well rested because Derek shouldn\u2019t have gotten him anything in the first place, the asshole.\nSo. Now Stiles has a new plan. He is officially done with this small-gesture stuff. No, this time, he is going to knock Derek\u2019s socks off. He is going to get him something so good, so mind-blowingly incredible, that there is no way Derek would ever be able to get even, short of paying for Stiles\u2019 entire college education or something similarly insane.\n(Did Stiles look into resurrection spells? Okay, yes, but only for like two minutes. He\u2019s seen Pet Sematary. He knows better.)\nStiles will teach Derek to be socially functional if it kills him. He just needs to wait for Scott to say what he has to say\u2014Stiles is almost certain that it\u2019s going to be a lecture about getting along with Isaac, after last week\u2019s Thanksgiving flop\u2014so Stiles can get down to business and plot out the details.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Scott says, as he sits down on Stiles\u2019 bed. He frowns. \u201cDude, come on, computer later. I wanna talk.\u201d\nOh boy. This is definitely about Isaac.\nStiles sighs, but pulls himself out of his chair and slouches across the room. Scott\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the bed, so Stiles sits opposite of him and mimics his pose.\nScott beams. He probably watched a bunch of Ted Talks about leadership before he came over. God, what a dork. Stiles has no idea why he loves him.\n\u201cOkay. Get it over with,\u201d Stiles sighs, rolling his eyes up to the ceiling.\nIt takes Scott a few moments, but eventually he screws up his face and says, \u201cYou, uh\u2026 Remember how we talked about Isaac? And, like, sharing me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sharing!\u201d Stiles says defensively.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a total dick to Isaac,\u201d Scott says, unimpressed.\n\u201cIsaac\u2019s been a dick to me,\u201d Stiles points out.\n\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m just saying, neither of you are blameless here.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m pretty sure that when he tried to eat me, and then continued to be a raging jackass afterwards, he started all this.\u201d Stiles jerks his thumb at his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve just been defending myself.\u201d\nScott raises his eyebrows.\nStiles raises his own right back.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott says.\n\u201cWell, he did start it,\u201d Stiles insists.\nScott makes a sympathetic face. \u201cOkay, maybe, but Isaac was having a really rough time then. You know becoming a werewolf isn\u2019t easy\u2014I kind of turned into a raging jackass, too, remember\u2014plus with his dad and everything\u2026\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes.\n\"Look, I\u2019m not asking for you guys to be friends or anything,\u201d Scott says, which makes Stiles snort. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t like each other. That\u2019s okay. Just, maybe, stop being pricks to each other? It really sucks being stuck between you two all the time.\u201d\nUgh. Puppy dog eyes.\n\u201cScott ,\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He wear scarves indoors, and he likes Pepsi. And he\u2019s a douchebag.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just prickly. Like someone else I know,\u201d Scott says, and goddamn that little smile of his. \u201cCome on. You said you\u2019d try, before, but I know when you\u2019re half-assing something, Stiles.\u201d\nStiles scowls.\n\u201cThis is really important to me,\u201d Scott says, eyes huge and dark and soulful.\n\u201cFine! Fine. I\u2019ll play nice if he will,\u201d Stiles snaps.\nInstantly, Scott\u2019s smile blossoms. \u201cHe will.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Stiles sighs.\nSharing is Caring Round Two\u2014once more, with feeling.\n\u201cOkay, so, we\u2019re cool?\u201d Scott asks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re cool,\u201d Stiles sighs, because they always are.\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Scott says, with a nod that is eerily reminiscent of Finstock\u2019s.\nStiles has a terrible, terrible suspicion that there will be trust excises and bonding activities on the horizon.\n\u201cThat was all?\u201d Stiles asks, and glances at his computer. \u201cI mean, awesome talk dude, but I\u2019ve sort of got some stuff to do, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHomework?\u201d\nStiles gets off the bed and goes back to his computer, scowl back in place. \u201cDerek. Remember the days when we had no idea who he was? I do. I remember them fondly.\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Scott says slowly. \u201cAre you guys\u2026 fighting?\u201d\nStiles snorts. \u201cOh yeah. See, Derek has this ludicrous paranoia about gifts\u2014like, if you do anything that could even be vaguely construed as nice for him, he totally freaks out and thinks that he has to buy you, like, a private island so you won\u2019t hold it over his head one day. So that needs to stop, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Scott repeats, sounding a little dumbfounded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Netflix account was about,\u201d Stiles adds. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some exposure therapy on him. Sorry for not telling you. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll use it, since I think he\u2019s a secret bookworm.\u201d\n\u201cDude. You\u2019ve been buying Derek Hale presents?\u201d Scott asks.\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even start out as a thing, but he refused to stop getting me presents back. I had to do something.\u201d\nScott gets up, squinting at the computer. \u201cAre you buying him something right now?\u201d\n\"Not\u2026 as such,\u201d Stiles says, minimizing all his windows, because plausible deniability is important for Scott. \u201cMore like, planning the retrieval of one. The last one, if I have any say in it. It\u2019s gonna be epic.\u201d\nScott stares at him.\nStiles circles impatiently with his hand, because hello, plotting to do.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott says eventually, in a strange tone of voice, \u201cremember that time when you bought Lydia like ten birthday presents because you couldn\u2019t decide which to give her?\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Are you implying that I\u2019m bad at picking out gifts? Because I have way improved my gift-giving game since last year.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Scott says.\nStiles frowns. \u201cIs this about Lydia? You know I\u2019m over her, right? Like, that ship has sailed.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 kind of my point, dude,\u201d Scott says.\nIt takes Stiles a moment.\n\u201cYou think I\u2014Derek?\u201d\nScott shrugs, looking guilty and defensive all in one go.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says emphatically. \u201cNo, no way. I mean. I don\u2019t. Derek?\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not dating?\u201d Scott asks, sounding, of all things, skeptical.\nStiles almost flails off his chair. \u201cNo! Oh my god, how could you think that?\u201d\n\u201cYou were wearing his clothes,\u201d Scott protests. \u201cYou had him over for Thanksgiving! He willingly played board games with you and your dad! I won\u2019t even do that for you, and I\u2019m your best friend.\u201d\nStiles groans and buries his head in his hands. \u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you guys are just friends?\u201d Scott asks weakly.\n\u201cNo! I mean, maybe. A little. Not really.\u201d Stiles exhales, frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s very dysfunctional, okay, it makes it hard to gauge.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence, and then: \u201cDo you\u2026 want to be dating him?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles snaps, glaring.\nScott looks at him sympathetically.\n\u201cOut,\u201d Stiles orders, pointing at the door. \u201cOut with you. Out, out, out.\u201d\nScott holds up his hands, laughing, and heads for the door.\nDoes Stiles want to date Derek?\nPffft. No. Please.\nCrazy talk.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSaturday night, Stiles pulls into the police station parking lot in his dad\u2019s car. Dad got off shift an hour ago, and Stiles had greeted him at home with the offer of pizza from Angelo\u2019s, as long as they got the whole wheat thin crust with the veggie supreme. After a brief argument, his father had conceded, and Stiles had volunteered to go retrieve the pizza.\nHe will go get the pizza. He just has an errand to run first.\n\u201cHey, Barb,\u201d he says when he goes in.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d she says, and nods at the file box in Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cDelivery?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles replies, and she waves him back, returning to her computer. Saturdays are the most popular day for paying off parking tickets, and Barb\u2019s first task on night shift is always to start processing payments.\nIn the back, there\u2019s just the new deputy, Kyle or Killian or something. Dad likes him a lot, but the newbie always gets stuck at night desk duty for the first few weeks. Eventually, he\u2019ll get pushed into the rotation for night patrol duty, probably third shift, and then where he goes from there is mostly up to the vacation and health whims of those higher up on the totem pole.\nIt\u2019s a small department. It takes a while to work your way up.\n\u201cHey, Stiles,\u201d Probably Kyle says when he sees Stiles. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d\n\u201cJust running this in for Dad. Riverdale missed another evidence box.\u201d He makes a face, and Kyle makes a face back.\nThe Beacon County Sheriff\u2019s Department had moved to Riverdale\u2019s headquarters for a few weeks, following the mass shooting last spring. In the confusion of being in a new place and understaffed in the worst way, Beacon Hills evidence and files had piled up in weird places, and even months later Riverdale was still sending them the occasional box of unearthed possessions.\n\u201cHe said just to dump the stuff on the table, and he\u2019ll sort it out when he gets in tomorrow morning. I guess it\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d Stiles tips the box forward a little and cracks open the lid, so the collection of evidence bags and papers and office supplies is visible.\n\u201cYou need me to let you in?\u201d Kyle asks, pushing himself back from his desk.\n\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles says, shaking his head and sliding the box under one arm so he can retrieve the swipe card from his back pocket. \u201cI\u2019ve got Dad\u2019s card. Thanks, though.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Kyle replies, settling back down at his desk.\nStiles goes past him and down the hall to the evidence locker. He\u2019s only been inside the evidence locker a handful of times, mostly on errands from Dad, but he knows enough that he should be okay.\nThe card works, which is good, because this isn\u2019t actually his dad\u2019s swipe card, it\u2019s a copy he made himself.\nInside the evidence locker, not much has changed. There\u2019s a to-be-filed table just on the inside right, with various clipboards and file racks on the wall just above it, stacks of empty evidence bags, and some signs detailing how to properly label and sort things, and misfiling is bad, to please talk to Barb Greeley if you\u2019re confused. Then there are rows and rows of metal shelving units that hold evidence from all cases that are still open from the last twelve months.\nStiles sets his box on the to-be-filed desk and heads into the stacks.\nEverything is organized by date, and Stiles quickly finds January, moves past shelves of boxes and boxes and boxes until he finds Laura Hale\u2019s case number, memorized almost a year ago. The box is light, when he pulls it off the bottom shelf, and inside, there are only a few bags of evidence, a slim folder of photographs, and a padded yellow envelope that contains the interrogation tapes. Derek is on those tapes. Stiles is on those tapes, when he\u2019d made his official statement about finding Laura\u2019s body buried by the Hale house.\nStiles shoves the memories back and starts shuffling the bags of evidence around. It\u2019s all stuff that the police had eventually found in the woods\u2014muddy, shredded clothing, shoes, a necklace, a purse, car keys. The copy of the article that had sent Laura running back to Beacon Hills in the first place.\nHe grabs the purse and the necklace and closes the lid, sliding the box back into place.\nBack at the to-be-filed table, Stiles opens the box he brought in and takes out the fake evidence bags. He put the purse and the necklace at the bottom of the box, before dumping the fake bags\u2019 contents into the box and putting the empty evidence bags in the trash. Then he closes the lid, grabs the box with one hand, and lets it dangle as he leaves so that it gives the impression of being light and empty\u00a0\nHe nods at Kyle and Barb as he walks past each of them, and gets distracted goodbyes as he does. Neither of them notice that he\u2019s shaking.\nHis heart doesn\u2019t stop pounding until he\u2019s picked up the pizza and driven home and stowed the box safely away in the garage.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething like this, Stiles doesn\u2019t want to truss up with wrapping paper and bows and leave on Derek\u2019s doorstep with a cutesy note. But he also doesn\u2019t want to be in the room when Derek opens it, because this is definitely something that should be done in private. So he puts it in an old shoebox, bikes over to Derek\u2019s apartment, and knocks on Derek\u2019s door. He doesn\u2019t run away.\nIt takes Derek only a few seconds to answer.\n\u201cFor you,\u201d Stiles announces, shoving the box forward.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says flatly.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek sighs. \u201cStiles, stop wasting your money on me. Go return it.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t spend any money on this one,\u201d Stiles insists.\nDerek looks skeptical.\n\u201cTake it,\u201d Stiles orders, and pushes it forward until Derek grudgingly takes hold of it. \u201cSeriously, you\u2019ll want this one. Just wait until I\u2019m gone to open it, okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bomb, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek says, long-suffering.\nStiles cracks a smile. \u201cYeah. How\u2019d you ever guess?\u201d\nDerek doesn\u2019t say anything, but after a moment, he looks down at the box.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna take off,\u201d Stiles says, jerking his thumb at the elevator, \u201cbefore that thing explodes. See you later.\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes.\n\u201cAlso, winter break is in two weeks, and you are officially invited to the next family fun night!\u201d Stiles adds over his shoulder. \u201cMy dad wants to play Clue. Prepare your social calendar accordingly.\u201d\nWhen he gets on the elevator, Derek is still standing in the doorway, staring at him with an unreadable expression.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBeing able to get actual hours of sleep at night is amazing. Stiles is back in the zone with lacrosse, he\u2019s remembering that he actually kind of likes school, and the dark circles under his eyes have faded after only a few days. He, Scott, and Isaac go see the late night showing of Breaking Dawn and heckle it obnoxiously with the group of wasted college kids who\u2019ve sat a few rows in front of them. He and Isaac are surprisingly civil the whole night. Stiles makes bison burgers for his father, and his father almost weeps for joy at the sight of burgers made of real red meat. He and Lydia study together for history, and eventually wind up wasting two hours on YouTube watching Monty Python sketches.\nStiles doesn\u2019t hear from Derek at all.\nGood. Derek must have finally learnt his lesson, then.\nThat\u2019s\u2026 good.\nStiles is in the middle of a cleaning spree in his room, brought on by his shiny new outlook on life, when he finds the rest of Derek\u2019s mail.\nStiles thumbs through it, hoping that it\u2019s all junk mail so he\u2019ll just be able to throw it out and not have to awkwardly return it. He gave back the gas bill, and he doesn\u2019t remember there being anything else particularly important in the stack of mail. Credit card offers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coupon, a letter from Beacon Memorial Hospital\u2026\nHold up.\nThe hospital?\nHe remembers being puzzled over this letter before, but now he has the time to seriously examine it. It\u2019s addressed to Derek Hale, and it doesn\u2019t look like a bill. The envelope is made of thick, expensive paper, and Derek\u2019s name is actually printed on it, instead of on a label or something. Stiles has never seen a letter like this from Beacon Memorial Hospital, and he\u2019s seen a lot of letters from there.\nOpening someone else\u2019s mail is a federal offense.\nBut, hey, so is stealing evidence from an ongoing police investigation.\nStiles tears open the envelope. Inside of it is a letter printed on similarly thick, expensive paper.\n\nDear Mr. Hale,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We would like to express our gratitude, again, for your generous donation to this past year\u2019s Auto Auction for Autism event. The Camaro truly rounded out our lineup of automobiles, and the proceeds have gone on to contribute to a great cause. If you haven\u2019t already, please feel free to visit our website at   www.bmh.org/autism   for more information on how we\u2019ve been making a difference these last few months, and our plans for the future.\nAnd there\u2019s more to the letter\u2014Stiles skims over more effusive gratitude and unsubtle hints about future events could also benefit from donations, monetary or otherwise\u2014but his mind is stuck on the most important part of the letter: Derek had actually donated the Camaro.\nStiles had thought the asshole was joking.\nBut no, Derek Hale had donated his stupidly sexy Camaro to charity, and replaced it with a stupid soccer mom car. The thought makes Stiles\u2019 heart thump, and oh, he knows that thump. Stupid Derek with his stupid dimples and his stupid sweaters with thumbholes and\u2014\nGod dammit.\nAnd he\u2019d just gotten over Lydia.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been almost two weeks since Stiles last saw Derek, and he\u2019s in the middle of finals, so he thinks he can be forgiven for being a little slow on the uptake. His head isn\u2019t quite as spacey as it was before his beautiful, wonderful adder stones came into his life, but it\u2019s also not great.\n\u201cDude,\u201d Scott says, as they brake to a stop in Stiles\u2019 driveway. \u201cI thought they wanted to total it?\u201d\nStiles pulls his helmet off, planting his feet on the ground. \u201cUh. Yeah. I thought so too. They must have changed their minds. Sweet!\u201d\n\u201cGuess you won\u2019t need a ride to school tomorrow, huh?\u201d Scott asks.\n\u201cNope,\u201d Stiles says happily, hopping off the bike. \u201cIsaac\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks awesome, man,\u201d Scott says, and it really does. It\u2019s been so long that Stiles can\u2019t accurately remember exactly which parts of his Jeep were damaged during the wreck, and therefore would have needed replacing, but he\u2019s fairly certain that he hadn\u2019t needed four brand-new tires. Or a new bumper.\nHuh. Guess he is in good hands with Allstate.\n\u201cBaby!\u201d Stiles cries, plastering himself to the corner of his Jeep. \u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take off before you start humping it,\u201d Scott says.\n\u201cOh, werewolf\u2019s got dog jokes,\u201d Stiles mutters, rolling his eyes and flipping him off without looking back.\nScott laughs, and pulls around in the driveway. \u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d\n\u201cLater, loser!\u201d Stiles yells, and backs away from his Jeep so that he can get into his pocket for his phone. He starts circling his baby as he dials his father\u2019s number, inspecting every visible inch.\nIt looks amazing. He should crash his car more often, really.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d Dad answers. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean other than you not telling me that my baby was out of the shop?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cYour\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cMy Jeep,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI thought they were totaling it?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2026 were,\u201d Dad says slowly.\nStiles squints in through the window, and yep, all the cigarette burns on the seats are there. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in our driveway right now, looking better than it has in like ten years.\u201d\nA pause. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Stiles finishes his walk-round of the Jeep.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Dad says. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll call Allstate and see what\u2019s going on. Not sure how they got to our house, though. We should have gotten a call telling us to pick it up at the garage. Strange.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees.\nHe heads up to the garage to set his helmet down\u2014which he won\u2019t be needing anymore, awesome. Take that, Derek. Stiles Stilinski didn\u2019t need your stupid, expensive\u2026 presents\u2026 any\u2026\n\u201cThat fucker!\u201d Stiles swears.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDerek!\u201d Stiles bangs on Derek\u2019s door. \u201cDerek, you had better open up, you asshole. I know you\u2019re in there! I saw your stupid soccer mom car in the parking lot!\u201d The stupid soccer mom car Derek had because he\u2019d donated his muscle car to charity. \u201cDerek!\u201d\nDerek yanks the door open just as Stiles swings his fist forward, and of course, Derek grabs it out of midair instead of letting Stiles punch him in the face like a considerate werewolf. God dammit.\n\u201cStiles, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Derek demands, wide-eyed, looking Stiles up and down.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is you, you socially dysfunctional moron,\u201d Stiles explodes, jabbing Derek in the chest with a finger, forcing his way into the apartment.\nUnderstanding dawns on Derek\u2019s face as he stumbles back.\n\u201cSee! You know what you did!\u201d\n\u201cI was just\u2014\u201d\n\"You fixed my Jeep! What did you even do, steal it from the garage and unbend it piece by piece with your stupid werewolf muscles?\u201d Stiles\u2019 hands are flying everywhere right now\u2014his sides, the ceiling, into his hair.\nDerek has the gall to look annoyed. \u201cWell, what did you want me to do?\u201d\n\u201cNothing! I wanted you to do nothing!\u201d\n\u201cStiles, you got me Laura\u2019s\u2026 I had to do something, the Jeep was nothing, I couldn\u2019t even begin to make up for\u2014\u201d\n\"No, you see, that\u2019s just it,\u201d Stiles interrupts. \u201cThat was the point! You can\u2019t make up for it, because you don\u2019t have to, you idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI told you not to get me anything in the first place,\u201d Derek says, scowling. \u201cYou were the one who wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d\nStiles throws his hands up. \u201cI just wanted to get you some presents!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Derek demands.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! Because you deserve some nice things, dickwad!\u201d\nDerek stares.\n\u201cYou deserve nice things,\u201d Stiles repeats, through gritted teeth, because what the hell, in for a penny, in for a pound. \u201cThat\u2019s why, okay? That\u2019s the secret. And when you give me presents back, it\u2019s like you\u2019re saying, \u2018No, I don\u2019t deserve these things\u2019, and you do, you utter\u2014flipping\u2014dumbass. You deserve presents.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says.\nDerek glares.\n\u201cYou actually donated your Camaro to charity,\u201d Stiles says, and watches Derek\u2019s face blank in surprise. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I know about that. And you came back to Beacon Hills, twice, even after it traumatized you to hell and back, like, ten times. You\u2019re a good big brother. And you\u2014I don\u2019t know, you went after an Omega even though you could have just foisted it off on Scott, almost got yourself killed, and then went back and finished the job. You\u2019re just\u2014you\u2019re a good person. I mean, you\u2019re also a douchebag. Like, a complete douchebag. You should really just have your own page on TVTropes. Oh my god, why are you smiling?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Derek says, and he\u2019s moving forward, now.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014no I\u2019m not! That\u2019s you. Weren\u2019t you listening?\u201d\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, with a predatory glint in his eye that has Stiles backing up against the wall. \u201cYou like me.\u201d\nStiles folds his arms over his chest. \u201cNot that much.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d Derek continues, smirking, only getting closer.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou know werewolves can hear lies, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not blushing, I have a\u2014a naturally rosy complexion!\u201d Stiles hits the wall, and Derek stops just short of him.\n\u201cDid also you know,\u201d he says, very quietly, \u201cthat werewolves can smell arousal?\u201d\nStiles gulps.\nDerek reaches out and gently unfolds Stiles\u2019 arms, holding each of Stiles\u2019 wrists between his fingers. He leans forward, face inches from Stiles\u2019. \u201cWe can. That\u2019s how I know that right now, you want me to kiss you. That you\u2019ve wanted me to kiss you for a while, now. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d Stiles squeaks. \u00a0\nDerek leans in and\u2014\n\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles says, jerking his head to the side. \u201cThis had better not be some fucked up present for me in return for me for Laura\u2019s stuff, okay? You don\u2019t owe me anything. Actually, I owe you, because you had to go and magically fix my Jeep, \u2018cause you\u2019re stupid. And\u2014and I want to do a lot more than kiss you. Like, go to the movies. So, if you don\u2019t actually want to\u2014you know\u2014\u201d\nDerek is watching, waiting. The glint in his eyes is nothing but lupine.\nStiles glares. \u201cJust\u2014this isn\u2019t just for me, right?\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, Stiles,\u201d Derek all but purrs. \u201cThis present? Is all for me.\u201d"
