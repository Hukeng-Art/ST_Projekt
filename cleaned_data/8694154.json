    "text": "Yuuri Katsuki has never been able to speak.\nFor as long as Yuuri has been alive, his voice has never been able to utter a word.\nHe didn\u2019t really understand the logistics of it; all he knew was that he had some neurological problem within his brain that hampered his ability to form words. Other than that one minor detail, Yuuri was completely healthy.\nIt wasn\u2019t an issue for Yuuri. He didn\u2019t see any issues with his inability to speak. He was still able to do everything everyone else was able to do, apart from this one tiny flaw.\nAt first, Yuuri was urged to take speech therapy to try and help his speech problem. It didn\u2019t really work. The doctors hoped that if he urged his vocal cords to produce sound, his brain would slowly correct its error.\nIt did not.\nYuuri was only able to make garbled sounds, nothing resembling words.\nSo he stopped doing the therapy. It was strenuous and Yuuri hated it.\nHis parents understood Yuuri\u2019s frustration. They would have loved to have heard their baby boy speak, but they loved him too much to force him to do something he didn\u2019t want. Yuuri was 9 when he stopped attending speech therapy,\nThen the doctors came.\nThey believed they had a procedure that would fix the neurological error in Yuuri\u2019s brain that would enable him to speak.\nIt meant surgery. Then more therapy.\nYuuri declined the offer.\nAt the age of 10, Yuuri didn\u2019t understand the purpose of speaking. He heard voice all around him, yet people were never able to truly express what they wanted.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of speaking to say nothing at all?\n\nBesides, Yuuri had found his way of communicating.\nYuuri had found that he was able to express himself better than words ever would through figure skating. His ballet teacher had always told Yuuri art doesn\u2019t need words to tell a story. She was right. Yuuri could tell anyone that he was angry or sad, lonely or happy, all through his movements across the ice.\nFigure skating allowed Yuuri to say what he wanted without words.\nHowever, figure skating only solved one of the two problems brought about by Yuuri\u2019s inability to speak.\nThe second problem was that of his soulmate.\nWhen Yuuri was 7, he was helping his father put groceries away in the kitchen when he noticed a dark smudge begin to form on his arm.\nIt confused Yuuri as to how the smudge got there. He hadn\u2019t bumped into anything so it couldn\u2019t have been a bruise. As Yuuri looked at the smudge, he realized that it was slowly getting bigger and taking the shape of strange characters.\nToddling over to his father, he tugged on his father sleeve to gain his attention.\n\u201cWhat is it Yuuri?\u201d His father asked looking down at his tiny son.\nYuuri point to the characters forming just below his elbow.\nHis father looked surprised at first, but then just smiled.\n\u201cOh Yuuri, that\u2019s just your soulmate talking about you.\u201d His father replied.\nYuuri gave his father a confused look, waiting for more of an explanation.\nKneeling down, Yuuri\u2019s father took hold of his sons arm and gazed at the marks growing across Yuuri\u2019s skin.\nHe didn\u2019t know what it said as it was in another language, but the characters still made him happy knowing that his son would have a soulmate to care for him regardless of his disability.\n\u201cYou see Yuuri, when your soulmate says something about you, like a compliment or a special message, their words will appear on your skin. I don\u2019t know what this says, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s something special. It\u2019s your soulmate, Yuuri.\u201d His father grinned.\nYuuri continued to look at his father with a look of amazement.\nHis father began to look sad. Yuuri didn\u2019t know why his father would look sad.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to explain it Yuuri, as most experts don\u2019t even understand it. However, it would seem the only way for soulmate messages to appear on their other half\u2019s skin is if it\u2019s actually spoken aloud. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this Yuuri; your soulmate may never see any messages from you.\u201d\nThe words his father said explained to Yuuri the sad truth that people had been trying to tell him for years. He always knew about soulmates. But, he didn\u2019t realize that some people pushed Yuuri to speak just so he could say things for his soulmate to find.\nAfter the first time Yuuri found the strange characters decorating his arm, he tried hard to speak. He worked harder than ever in his speech therapy. He didn\u2019t want his soulmate to go without soulmate messages, but as months passed with zero progress, Yuuri began to become discouraged.\nAt 9 when he decided to end speech therapy, Yuuri felt bittersweet. He was happy to end the tiresome therapy sessions. Yet he was sad that he wouldn\u2019t be able to say words for his soulmate to see.\nInstead, Yuuri made it a goal of his to find a way to communicate with his soulmate without the help of words.\n*\nYuuri would occasionally think about his soulmate, but he tried not to as the thought itself was painful. He loved seeing the characters on his skin. They were fairly neutral phrases. Phrases such as I know they will are a kind person and I can\u2019t wait to meet my soulmate.\nOnly as years passed, his soulmarks became fewer and fewer. It wasn\u2019t until Yuuri was 15 that he realized how much he was hurting his soulmate when the message I wonder if I even have a soulmate appeared across his ankle.\nIt was after practice one evening when the words appeared. Yuuri was confused at first. Never had he seen a message like the one he was seeing now.\nThe look on his face must have been one of shock or horror. His rinkmates and friends, Yuuko and Nishigori asked Yuuri if he was okay. When they saw the characters curling around Yuuri\u2019s ankle, they assumed it was another kind message from his soulmate. They both knew that Yuuri\u2019s soulmate was foreign and that Yuuri had been working for years to understand the language.\n\u201cWhat does it say Yuuri?\u201d Yuuko asked with a blissful look.\nYuuri lifted his hands and shakily signed what the message read.\nHe didn\u2019t bother to look up at their expressions. He knew that they were surprised by Yuuko\u2019s soft gasp and Nishigori\u2019s whispered damn.\nYuuri just pulled the leg of his workout sweats down below his ankle and plastered on the best smile he could.\nIt\u2019s okay. I knew this would happen. Yuuri signed to hoping it would reassure them.\nYuuko was hesitant, but she knew Yuuri well enough not to get into it. So instead the three teenagers turned their attention to the television that showed the Grand Prix event in Canada where Yuuri\u2019s figure skating idol was performing.\n*\nIt didn\u2019t take Yuuri by surprise that that soulmate message was the last one Yuuri would find on his skin. He knew that his soulmate had probably given up. It had been years since Yuuri\u2019s first mark showed. It had to be discouraging to never see a message written across your skin showing any little sign of having a soulmate out there waiting.\nInstead Yuuri focused on his skating. Already Yuuri was winning tournaments across the country for his expressive figure skating. He had both technical skill, and emotional components that made Yuuri\u2019s figure skating so captivating.\nYuuri began traveling to different countries to compete. He was able to excel in each competition, some better than others.\nYuuri was 17 when he won gold at the Junior Grand Prix Finals and later won gold again at the Junior Worlds Championship.\nSoon after his win, Yuuri was offered to study in the United States and be taught by a top figure skating coach. It wasn\u2019t a difficult discussion to make. Yuuri had been working hard to become a successful figure skater. The only challenging part was the fact that he would have to leave behind his friends, family, and his precious dog Vicchan.\n*\nWhen Yuuri was younger, he realized that the characters that sometimes decorated his skin were Russian letters.\nThe strange characters motivated Yuuri to learn its language.\nIn between figure skating and school, Yuuri would always been found studying the Russian language. He knew he couldn\u2019t speak the language, but at least he would be able to read its writing and understand their speech.\nIt had become a habit or Yuuri\u2019s. As he grew older, he sought out to learn as many languages as he could. He didn\u2019t want to be limited anymore than he already was. If he could learn languages, he would be able to understand people in various different countries.\nYuuri\u2019s interest in languages took him Detroit, Michigan to study linguistics as well as train to be a competitive figure skater.\nBy the time Yuuri was 18, he was able to read and understand spoken Russian, English, French, Italian, and German, as well as Japanese sign language. Yet that wasn\u2019t enough. Yuuri wanted to know more.\u00a0\nThankfully, Yuuri\u2019s skating coach, Celestino, understood that Yuuri couldn\u2019t speak and instead communicated in trembling hand signs and figure skating.\nCelestino soon learned that he had to watch Yuuri carefully as the skater would sometimes work himself too hard. He had found, on more than one occasion, Yuuri staying at the ice rink late, gliding across the ice in swift, sharp movements. Anxiety. Celestino realized Yuuri was communicating through his skating.\nIt helped that 2 years after Yuuri came to Detroit he had found a roommate that would help look after him.\nPhichit was a true friend to Yuuri.\nHe pushed Yuuri to become a great figure skater, encouraged him when he was in low spirits, and calmed him down when he came distressed. Phichit didn\u2019t care that Yuuri couldn\u2019t speak. He only wanted to see Yuuri be the best person that he could be.\nEven if that meant doing a lot of stupid things with the mindset of live a little Yuuri!\nYuuri worked hard. He had support of many friends and peers around him.\nBy the age of 22, Yuuri was one of Japan\u2019s top figure skater who had made it into the Grand Prix Finals.\n*\nEverything was going well for Yuuri.\nOr it was until the morning before he left for the Grand Prix Finals.\nYuuri was awoken by the sound of his phone beeping. When he picked up his phone, he saw that it was his mother calling through Skype.\nHe answered the video call with the best cheery smile he could manage at 4:30 in the morning.\nThe smile drained quickly away as he took in his mother\u2019s puff cheeks and red rimmed eyes. She had been crying.\n\u201cYuuri, I\u2019m so sorry to call you this early but I needed to tell you something.\u201d She started to say. \u201cIt\u2019s about Vicchan.\u201d\nYuuri didn\u2019t need to hear the rest. He already knew what had happened based off the sadness in his mother\u2019s voice and the redness around her eyes.\n\u201cHe passed away in his sleep, Yuuri. I\u2019m so sorry you didn\u2019t get to see him one last time.\u201d\nYuuri didn\u2019t know how to respond. His arms felt like lead and his vision began to blur. He didn\u2019t know how long he sat there starring at the blurry image of his mother. He didn\u2019t hear his door creak open or the gentle prying of his hands to release his phone.\nHe heard noises, but none of them registered.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d a gentle voice asked beside him.\nWithout thinking, Yuuri buried himself in the arms of the person beside him. A part of Yuuri knew it was Phichit, but he couldn\u2019t think far enough to register what was happening. Instead he let himself cry into his friend\u2019s arms, gasping little breathes the only sound able to escape Yuuri\u2019s lips.\n*\nWhen Yuuri woke up some hours later, he was sweating and his eyes felt crusty. He heard Phichit snoring beside him, still holding Yuuri closely.\nPrying himself gently out of Phichit\u2019s arms, Yuuri made his way to the bathroom to shower.\nYuuri didn\u2019t want to think. He didn\u2019t want to feel. He just wanted to lie in bed and hibernate.\nYet he knew that Celestino would be by soon to pick Yuuri up for the airport.\nEven as Yuuri felt his world crumbling, he still had obligations to uphold.\nAnd he hated it.\nWhen Yuuri finally exited the bathroom, he could hear soft speech drifting from the direction of the living room. Yuuri knew that Phichit would be briefing Celestino on that night\u2019s events.\nSo Yuuri did what he was an expert at.\nIgnore.\nHe ignored everything. He just grabbed his packed bag and headed for the door.\nCelestino trailed after Yuuri as they exited the apartment complex. His coach didn\u2019t say anything. Yuuri knew he wouldn\u2019t. That was one of the things Yuuri liked about his coach; he knew when to leave Yuuri to his thoughts.\nIt wasn\u2019t until they were on the airplane, ready to depart for Russia where the Grand Prix Finals were being held, did Celestino say anything to Yuuri.\n\u201cWill you be okay to skate?\u201d He asked.\nYuuri just turned his head to stare out the window as the plane raced down the track.\nHe shrugged.\n*\nYuuri was not in any way going to be okay to skate.\nIt hadn\u2019t even been 48 hours since Yuuri received the news about Vicchan.\nHis head was in a fog as he entered into the chilly arena. It would take a miracle for Yuuri to do well.\nYuuri could hear the whispers from onlookers as he and Celestino passed by. He ignored them. Yuuri tried to focus his mind on the task before him, yet his was finding it to be a struggle to focus on anything.\n\u201cHe looks so sad.\u201d\nYuuri heard the voice, but ignored it. He didn\u2019t want to see who had stated the obvious. Instead, Yuuri walked away to find some other place to stretch before his performance.\nTime moved quickly.\nSooner than Yuuri hoped, Celestino was ushering him out onto the ice for his Short Program routine.\nShaking out his arms and legs, Yuuri tried one final time to calm his nerves and focus on his skating.\nThat\u2019s when he noticed a dark smudge had formed just under the cuff of his shirt sleeve. Pulling the fabric aside, Yuuri was surprised to see the first soulmate mark displayed on his skin in years. What shocked him even more where the words were written in English saying He looks so sad. He had heard that exact phrase uttered not long before and he had ignored it at the time.\nHis soulmate was here.\nYuuri looked up at his coach with a new sense of determination.\nCelestino was surprised to see the look, but happy to see Yuuri looking so motivated.\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d Celestino said before Yuuri turned and skated onto the ice.\n*\nIt was a disaster.\nEven though Yuuri was able to concentrate on his performance, he still struggled through the whole thing.\nIt wasn\u2019t any better the following day during the Free Skate.\nYuuri knew he was doing terribly. He knew he wasn\u2019t expressing what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t skating how he wanted. He was stiff in his movements, and fell when trying to land his jumps.\nIt was embarrassing and shameful.\nEspecially coming in last.\nHe wasn\u2019t able to enjoy the event as much as he wanted.\nFor the first time, Yuuri was able to witness his favorite figure skater skating in front of him. Victor Nikiforov was someone Yuuri looked up to. The Russian skater had always provided Yuuri with the drive and inspiration to skate. For years, Yuuri had imitated Victor\u2019s skating simply because he loved the way the man displayed his emotions while on the ice.\nFor once, Yuuri was on par with his idol. He was a strong enough skater to make it to the Grand Prix Finals and skate against the person he looked up to. Yet he managed to look like a newborn fawn toddling across the ice.\nYuuri just wanted to hide.\nInstead of dealing with interviews, Yuuri left it to Celestino to handle. He made his way to the changing rooms to take off his clingy outfit and into something more comfortable.\nWhen Yuuri took his shirt off, he noticed that the phrase on his wrist was slowly fading. Then he noticed another dark splotch of words just above his navel. This time the words were in Russian.\n\nHis step sequence is good. He has a lot of talent, but he looks distracted.\n\nYuuri felt his face flush as he read the message. His step sequence was the only part of Yuuri\u2019s routine that he was proud of. It made him happy that his soulmate acknowledge that too.\nFootsteps began to approach the changing room. Yuuri hurried into an old worn t-shirt and comfortable sweatpants before collecting his belongings and hurrying out of the room.\nHe was greeted by Celestino in the lobby.\n\u201cAre you ready Yuuri?\u201d his coach asked.\nYuuri nodded his head. He knew that Celestino was disappointed in his performance, and that he should expect a thorough lecture on his mistakes once they got back to Detroit.\nFor now, Yuuri just followed Celestino towards the direction of the car.\nHe was stopped by the Japanese news reporter aggressively telling Yuuri it was too early for him to retire.\nYuuri ignored the conversation, choosing to look outside at the snow drifting down instead.\nThen he heard the voice again.\nBut when he turned around, all he saw was Victor Nikiforov talking to the Russian Yuri.\nWhen his idol turned to him and asked if he wanted a commemorative photo, Yuuri turned his back on the man and left.\nHe just wanted to leave. He didn\u2019t want to think anymore. Not now when his idol probably thought he was just another fan. Not now when he felt the guilt of not seeing Vicchan one last time creeping up on him. Not now that he had just lost horribly at the Grand Prix Finals.\nHe just wanted to leave.\n*\nThere had been times in Yuuri\u2019s life when he thought he might actually die. One time was when he slipped on a rocky coastal ledge, tumbling down into the chilly autumn water. Another time was when he had been persuaded by Phichit to go to a party and lighten up a little. Yuuri had drunken one too many drinks and ended up sick in his bathroom all the following day.\nOnly this time, Yuuri was sure his heart was going to give out on him.\nHe was alone his hotel room, getting ready for bed when he checked the soulmark across his stomach.\nThe mark had begun to fade and a new one began forming just below the older one. Yuuri stared at the mark, reading and rereading the words.\n\nCommemorative photo?\n\nHow can this be? Yuuri thought, his mind reeling and his heart racing far too quickly. Victor said this exact thing to me\u2026 but he can\u2019t\u2026\nYuuri was glad he was already lying in bed as his vision darkened and he passed out against his pillow.\n*\nWhen Yuuri woke up the following morning, he checked to see if the soulmark was still there.\nIt wasn\u2019t.\nIt had long since faded as the night passed.\nYuuri figured it was probably a mistake. There was no possible way that the Victor Nikiforov was his soulmate. Victor was too far out of Yuuri\u2019s reach to be anything of importance.\nBefore Yuuri was able to get too deep into his thoughts, Celestino was banging on his door telling him that they had 20 minutes until they needed to leave.\nSo Yuuri spent the next 20 minutes ignoring what happened the night before. He showered and got dressed. Packed his belongings and wheeled his suitcase out the door.\n*\nYuuri was tired.\nHe was tired in many different ways.\nAfter a long talk with Celestino, Yuuri had decided to put his figure skating on hold, finish his degree and then go home while he decided what he wanted to do.\nSo after 5 years, Yuuri was standing in the entryway of his childhood home.\nHis family was happy to see him. They didn\u2019t pressure him into anything. They were just glad to have their Yuuri back with them after so long.\nBut soon Yuuri got restless.\nAnd somehow a video of him skating to one of Victor\u2019s routines ended up on the internet.\nAnd for the second time within a 6 month period, Yuuri felt like he was going to die.\nStanding buck naked in his family onsen was his figure skating idol spouting nonsense about being Yuuri\u2019s coach.\nAll Yuuri could do was let out an embarrassing squeak and rush back inside.\nHis intentions were to get a pad of paper and a pen so he could communicate with Victor and tell him he didn\u2019t need him to be his coach, but an hour passed by and Yuuri had only just worked up the nerve to leave the safety of his room.\nA sleeping Russian skater was all he saw lying on the floor, wearing the familiar green guest robes their onsen provided.\nMinako-sensei was trying to reassure Yuuri that Victor was there because he believed Yuuri was worth his time to coach. That Yuuri had been an inspiration to Victor.\nWhen Victor woke, he inhaled more food then helped Yuuri lug all his belongings into the unused banquet room down the hall from Yuuri\u2019s room.\n\u201cYuuri, are you okay with me being your coach?\u201d Victor asked sitting down in the middle of his new room, surrounded my boxes containing his life\u2019s possessions.\nYuuri hesitated, but nodded his head. He would be okay with Victor coaching him. He didn\u2019t actually know if it would work out, but he would try anyway. Why wouldn\u2019t he want his idol to stay with him and be his coach?\n\u201cThen why won\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Victor asked tilting his head against his dog that Yuuri thought looked like a larger version of Vicchan.\nYuuri kind of expected that Victor wouldn\u2019t know about his muteness. Most people didn\u2019t. Reporters thought that he was just shy or tired after his performances which would explain why Yuuri never answered their questions himself.\nPulling out the small notepad that Yuuri stored away in his pocket, he began to scribble out a response.\nHanding the notepad to Victor, he watched the man\u2019s face, waiting for a reaction.\n\nI\u2019m mute. I cannot speak.\n\nThe message was written out in Russian.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Victor responded his eyes wide with surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. I also didn\u2019t know you knew Russian, Yuuri.\u201d\nYuuri looked down at his hands. He nodded his head.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. You just need to be able to express yourself through your skating right? You better work hard Yuuri.\u201d Victor said with his characteristic smile.\n*\nYuuri realized two things after Victor became his coach.\nOne was that the older man was extremely clingy. Every chance he got, he would hang himself all over Yuuri. It was flustering at first, but the more it happened, the less it bothered him. He soon began to enjoy the warm weight constantly pressing against his sides or hanging off his shoulders.\nThe second thing he realized that Victor was in fact Yuuri\u2019s soulmate.\nYuuri didn\u2019t want to believe it at first. He was still hesitant to believe that it was Victor\u2019s words that appeared on his stomach after the Grand Prix finals. But then the words came more frequently after Victor arrived in Yuuri\u2019s life. Things like:\nYour skating is improving. This phrase appeared frequently, sometimes across his back, other times on his hands. Victor would always remind Yuuri that he was getting better and better.\nYou\u2019re not weak, Yuuri. Yuuri was struggling with himself, and Victor had spent time away from the rink to reassure Yuuri that he was a strong person and that he admired him for his strength.\nYou\u2019re perfect the way you are was the phrase that made Yuuri realize that Victor was in fact his soulmate. Yuuri had shut himself away in his room after reading an article essentially calling Yuuri \u2018A waste of Victor\u2019s time\u2019. When Victor realized what had happened, he forced his way into Yuuri\u2019s room. Yuuri had engulfed himself in blankets, which Victor pulled into his arms.\nWhile Yuuri was cocooned within the warm blankets, Victor began to speak to Yuuri about why he had decided to coach him. He spoke in a quiet voice, reassure Yuuri that no matter what, he was perfect and didn\u2019t need to change himself for anyone.\nAs Victor said you\u2019re perfect the way you are, Yuuri watched the phrase slowly appear on his left index finger.\nWhen Yuuri began to cry, Victor just held onto Yuuri.\nYuuri had cried tears of joy and sadness. He was happy that Victor was his soulmate. Weeks of training had only increased his affection for the older man. However, Yuuri was upset because he realized that Victor was the same person that he was hurting.\nVictor believed he had no soulmate, and it was Yuuri\u2019s fault.\n*\nOf course Yuuri knew that he wasn\u2019t really at fault for causing Victor pain. He had tried to speak, yet it was physically impossible for him.\nAfter Yuuri accepted that Victor was indeed his soulmate, he decided to show Victor how much he cared for him in the only way he could.\nThrough his skating.\nYuuri couldn\u2019t find it in him to tell Victor the truth. He didn\u2019t want Victor to like him just because they were soulmates. He wanted Victor to genuinely fall in love with him.\nHe didn\u2019t even know if Victor would believe him. It wasn\u2019t like Yuuri could offer any proof.\nSo instead, Yuuri began to skate for Victor. He skated the best that he could; pouring in as many emotions for his coach that he could possible fit into his routines.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really expressing you love now Yuuri. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d Victor had mused one day during practice.\nIt made Yuuri happy. Victor was seeing his love poured into his performances.\nThe relationship between the two skaters was slowly growing closer and closer. They were practically inseparable.\nYuuri was happy.\n*\nYuuri had made it to the Grand Prix Cup of China event. He was happy to see Phichit again. It had been a while since they had last seen each other.\n\u201cHey Yuuri, your soulmates speaking to you.\u201d Phichit pointed out while they were changing into their skating outfits.\n\nI\u2019m confident Yuuri will win.\n\nThe mark was nestled on his lower back where he wouldn\u2019t have noticed if it wasn\u2019t for Phichit\u2019s watchful eye.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any soulmarks on you, I\u2019m surprised.\u201d Phichit said as he leaned in closer to inspect the mark.\nYuuri felt a flush warm his cheeks.\n\u201cDo you know who your soulmate is?\u201d\nHe had been waiting for the question. Phichit had always been nosy when it came to Yuuri\u2019s life. Yuuri didn\u2019t necessarily mind, but sometimes he questioned how much was safe to tell his friend.\nUnfortunately, Phichit had known Yuuri long enough that he could tell what Yuuri\u2019s answer would be before any hand signs were made.\n\u201cYou do don\u2019t you.\u201d Phichit looked up with a grin.\nYuuri nodded.\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\nYuuri didn\u2019t know if he should say. He wasn\u2019t sure if Phichit would tell anyone. But at the same time, Yuuri trusted his Thai friend.\nIf I tell you, can you promise to keep it a secret? Yuuri signed with hesitant hand movements.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d\nYuuri took a deep breath.\nHe doesn\u2019t know yet, but\u2026Yuuri hesitated but it\u2019s Victor.\nThe noise that Phichit made was something between a bird screeching and garbling baby.\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Phichit questioned too loudly in the otherwise quiet room.\nHe nodded his head don\u2019t tell him please, I want him to figure it out Yuuri signed quickly.\nPhichit nodded his head furiously.\n\u201cSure thing, Yuuri. Good luck!\u201d\n*\nPhichit won the Cup of China with Yuuri coming in second.\nBefore Victor and Yuuri left to go back to Japan, Phichit pulled Yuuri aside.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking and I think you should tell Victor.\u201d Phichit said with an unusually serious tone.\nWhy? Yuuri asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s already in love with you Yuuri, he deserves to know.\u201d Phichit grinned, walking away before Yuuri could respond.\n*\nYuuri and Victor were greeted with praise when they arrived back in Japan.\nThey had a few weeks to rest and prepare for the Rostelecom Cup in Russia.\nThe first thing they did when they arrive back home was sleep. The second was an early wake up call for Yuuri to begin practice while the feelings from the Cup of China were still fresh in his mind.\nThe day was long and exhausting, but rewarding all the same.\nYuuri was getting better and more consistent with his routine.\nVictor would always look at Yuuri skate with pride in his eyes.\nYuuri couldn\u2019t help but think of Phichit\u2019s parting words while he practiced. He didn\u2019t really know what the right choice would be.\nHe figured it would be safe to tell Victor after the Grand Prix Finals. He didn\u2019t want to cause any distractions. Yuuri still worried how Victor would react. So to him, waiting would be the best option. \u00a0\nThat was the plan at least.\nLate that same evening, Yuuri was soaking his tired muscles in the onsen.\nThe door slide open and Victor walked out, his body on full display as it always was.\n\u201cBe sure to relax Yuuri, tomorrow will be another long day.\u201d Victor said as he slide into the warm water.\nYuuri hummed in reply.\nThe two men were silent, enjoying each other\u2019s company and the warm water soothing their aching muscles.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m proud of you Yuuri.\u201d Victor whispered sweetly.\nYuuri smiled gently.\nHis eyes slipped shut; the warm water was making his drowsy.\nIf it weren\u2019t for Victor\u2019s sudden shift in movement, Yuuri probably would have fallen asleep against the rocks.\nHe cracked his eyes open to see Victor staring at him with bulging eyes.\nYuuri cocked his head at Victor.\nVictor just pointed up to his cheek.\nHe was confused. Yuuri looked down in the pool of water, his reflection shifting back at him.\nIt was easy see what caused Victor\u2019s strange reaction.\nYuuri couldn\u2019t see what it said, but he could see the telltale signs of a soulmark darkening his cheek.\nIt only took a second for Yuuri to realize why Victor would have reacted to it.\nYuuri jolted up from his seat and practically sprinted out of the bath.\nAs he hastily put on his clothes, Yuuri caught his reflection in the mirror.\n\nI\u2019m proud of you, Yuuri.\n\nThe mark stretched clear across Yuuri\u2019s left cheekbone.\nThis wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to happen. Victor wasn\u2019t supposed to find out like this. Yuuri was supposed to tell him. He wasn\u2019t supposed to find out while they were both naked!\nYuuri fled to his room, ignoring the calls of concern from his mother as he ran past.\nThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\n*\nVictor wasn\u2019t sure how long he had been staring at the spot Yuuri had previously occupied.\nThe air in the onsen was cold, but the water was warm around him.\nHis mind was racing at what he had just witnessed.\nHe had said the thing that had been on his mind since Yuuri was presented with the silver medal. He had been watching Yuuri\u2019s face to see the gentle smile stretch across his lips.\nThe next thing Victor knew, the words he had just spoken traced across Yuuri\u2019s cheekbone.\nVictor knew he had reacted to the sight.\nThen the waters shifted around him and Yuuri was gone.\nA part of Victor wanted to go after Yuuri immediately, but another part was frozen in shock.\nAll his life, Victor had believed he had no soulmate. He spent years and years hoping and begging for a soulmark to appear on his skin. It never happened though.\nIt was a fact that Victor had to deal with. He had no soulmate.\nNow he wasn\u2019t so sure.\nOne minute he had no soulmate, the next he was watching his words burn into his students skin.\nSomehow Victor managed to get out of the onsen and towel himself off.\nHis head was in a daze, but his body knew what to do.\nMakkachin nosed at his hand as he stood in front of Yuuri\u2019s door.\nVictor took a deep breath before knocking quietly at the door.\nNo answer.\nHe expected that. Instead of knocking again, he slide the door open slowly. He was thankful that Yuuri hadn\u2019t locked it.\n\u201cYuuri?\u201d Victor asked quietly.\nVictor could see Yuuri hidden in a cocoon of blankets. He was shaking underneath them all.\nVictor entered into the room and closed the door behind him. He wasn\u2019t sure what he needed to do. He didn\u2019t know what to say, as he was still at a loss for words himself.\nHe sat down on Yuuri\u2019s bed, right beside the bundle of blankets.\nAt first he didn\u2019t say anything; he just let the silence fill the room.\n\u201cDid\u2026\u201d Victor began to say after what felt like hours \u201cdid you know?\u201d\nHis words were barely above a whisper.\nHe could hear Yuuri shifting below the blankets, a tiny squeak piercing the silence.\nVictor had always loved to hear the tiny breathy sounds and squeaks that sometimes came out of Yuuri\u2019s lips.\nThe small noise was all Victor needed for an answer.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asked not expecting an answer.\nHe didn\u2019t get one.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand Yuuri. I always thought I didn\u2019t have a soulmate. I guess it makes sense now. If you can\u2019t speak, it\u2019s no wonder why I never showed any signs of having one.\u201d\nThe silence stretched on. Victor could feel the twitching pile of blankets behind him.\n\u201cI\u2019d understand if you didn\u2019t want me as a soulmate.\u201d Victor whispered.\nHe felt the bed jerk, the blankets falling away behind Yuuri\u2019s body.\nVictor watched as Yuuri scrambled out of his nest, reaching for a discarded pen on the floor.\nFor as long as he could remember, Victor always believed he was good at judging what a person was about to do or say. However, he was never good at figuring out Yuuri.\nHe watched as Yuuri grabbed Victor\u2019s arm, pushing up his sleeve.\nYuuri uncapped the pen and began scribbling shaky words across Victor\u2019s skin.\nI\u2019m happy Victor is my soulmate.\nYuuri looked up at Victor, his eyes misty with unshed tears.\n\u201cYuuri.\u201d\nHe felt the pressure of the pen on his skin again as Yuuri wrote again.\n\nVictor makes me happy. \n\n\nHe is kind and patient with me.\n\n\nVictor is beautiful.\n\nYuuri hesitated. He turned Victor\u2019s hand over and began to write on his palm.\nI\u2019ve fallen in love with Victor.\nVictor watched as Yuuri wrote words of endearment across his skin. His eyes began to fill with tears.\nYuuri wrote more and more across Victor\u2019s skin. The words that were never able to escape his lips. The words he always wanted his soulmate to hear.\n\u201cThank you Yuuri.\u201d Victor replied with a watery smile. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nYuuri smiled softly as Victor.\nVictor reached around Yuuri, pulling him into a warm embrace.\nVictor held Yuuri tightly.\nHis eyes catching of the phrase I love you too spreading across the palm of his soulmates hand."
