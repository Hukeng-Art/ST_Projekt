    "text": "Jimin\u2019s fingernails dig into the flesh of his palms, jaw clenching.\n\u00a0\nHis father\u2019s voice has a finality to it that he knows will be pointless to argue against. He certainly doesn\u2019t agree with the decision, far from it, but for now he bites his tongue, unwilling to cause a scene in front of the council.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will take the proposal to them myself,\u201d Sungho says, addressing the council, his back turned to Jimin. They don\u2019t seem too pleased with the decision either, but no one protests, perhaps thankful it was not their children that were being led to the wolves.\n\u00a0\nJimin can feel the anger simmer under his skin, the cruelty of his father\u2019s decision hitting him in the pit of his stomach. He feels the tremble run through him as his father continues.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have lost four men in the last three months,\u201d Sungho reminds, as if anyone could have forgotten. \u201cThe town cannot keep suffering such losses.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do they stand to gain from this...\u201d Youngsik pauses, gaze falling on Jimin, \u201carrangement?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn a time like this, you are better off with allies, not enemies,\u201d Sungho replies easily, hands coming to rest behind his back. \u201cThey may be wolves, but we\u2019ve hurt their numbers over the years, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSungho is right,\u201d Kyunghee adds, her voice gravelly with age, eyes barely opening. \u201cIt is to our benefit to have them as allies.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe have nothing to offer them,\u201d another elder pipes in, and Jimin fights the urge to snap at him, to demand why none of them had protested earlier then.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuman or wolf, no one wants to lose members of their community. They gain nothing attacking us, and we are not as helpless as you make us seem.\u201d Sungho directs the last comment right to the elder, who has nothing to say in response.\n\u00a0\nJimin grits his teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe is your only son, Sungho,\u201d Miyeon says quietly, her eyes sympathetic as they fall on Jimin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I will lose him to death, or worse, if things remain as they are,\u201d Sungho asserts, turning so that he has Jimin in his peripherals. \u201cMarriage is a blessing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe room falls silent.\n\u00a0\nAnd Jimin knows in that moment that his future has been sealed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can run away!\u201d Taehyung insists, his hands gripping Jimin\u2019s arm, a helplessness to him that Jimin feels frothing inside himself, too. He wants to cry, but hasn\u2019t given into it, refusing.\n\u00a0\nOf course, Jimin\u2019s first thought had been to run away himself, but he wouldn\u2019t make it two miles out of town before he\u2019d be ripped apart by some creature lurking in the woods. It hardly mattered how sharp a shooter he was or how well he wielded his sword in the face of the horrors that lurked around every corner.\n\u00a0\nJimin understood his father\u2019s logic, but to offer his hand to  werewolves ?\n\u00a0\nThe betrayal feels akin to a knife in the back.\n\u00a0\nHis mother hadn\u2019t helped, her eyes rimmed red when Jimin had returned home after barging out of their town hall, seething with fury. He\u2019d tired himself out by spending nearly two hours at the mill, helping the workers to haul wheat for grinding, before returning home. She\u2019d offered him nothing, crying instead, and Jimin had sent his father one final glare before disappearing into his room.\n\u00a0\nPerhaps if he had been a witch, if he could conceal himself somehow, he\u2019d be able to make it to a bigger city, but Jimin had never stepped foot outside his small town. He had too much loyalty to his people and despite the bile that rose to his throat at the thought of being married off to some mutt, his sense of duty didn\u2019t allow him to turn his back on his town.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo that I can die in the woods?\u201d Jimin asks, unable to keep the bitterness from his voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe can\u2019t just marry you off!\u201d Taehyung exclaims, rising to his feet. Jimin\u2019s never seen him so riled up. \u201cYou\u2019re not cattle to be traded for security.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI doubt they will want this arrangement,\u201d Jimin says, focusing back on fixing the hole he\u2019s formed in a pair of his pants. He refuses to ask his mother, doesn\u2019t want to deal with her useless crying.\n\u00a0\nHis father had set off that morning with five other men, protection charms carved into their skin. There was always the possibility that he would simply not return. While the Jeon pack lived with some kind of order, there were plenty of werewolf packs that roamed and attacked with abandon. The rules of war meant little to them.\n\u00a0\nAlthough, encroaching on the Jeon pack\u2019s territory wouldn\u2019t be a very wise decision either.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if they say yes?\u201d Taehyung asks, eyes wet with tears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen I will deal with it,\u201d Jimin answers, feeling bad when Taehyung\u2019s face falls. He\u2019s being cold but he\u2019s upset and there is very little Taehyung\u2019s anger will solve. \u201cWhat could werewolves gain from a marriage to a human?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard...of other human towns doing the same,\u201d Taehyung says quietly, dropping back down onto Jimin\u2019s bed. \u201cWitches refuse to deal with werewolves, but their magic is helpful to them, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin hums in acknowledgement, swallowing around the lump in his throat. He doesn\u2019t feel hopeful, knows already what will be expected of him if he goes through with this. Jimin has heard the same stories as Taehyung.\n\u00a0\nJimin understands, of course, that their town\u2019s well-being lies in an end to their ongoing feud over land with the Jeon pack. If they want to expand outward or cut down more of the woods to make room for farming, they need the Jeon pack\u2019s cooperation. In all respects, Jimin understands his father\u2019s logic. If they have an alliance with a wolf pack, they can deal with other packs, too.\n\u00a0\nStill.\n\u00a0\nSungho hadn\u2019t even  told  Jimin about his plan until he\u2019d called for a council meeting and declared that he would be offering Jimin\u2019s hand in marriage to the Jeon Alpha\u2019s children.\n\u00a0\nHe grits his teeth, nearly tossing aside his pants.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe could ask Ga-in if there\u2019s \u2015 \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can she do?\u201d Jimin sighs, eyes squeezing shut. His anger was clouding his ability to think about this rationally. Maybe he could strike a deal with the Jeon pack? \u201cWhat could we even offer her for her to help us?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to give up?\u201d Taehyung asks, a little incredulous as his voice wobbles.\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t answer.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSungho returns eight days later with a smile and a sense of accomplishment that cannot be mistaken for anything but success.\n\u00a0\nAny shred of hope Jimin had turns to ashes, and he finally cries.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe horse ride to the Jeon pack\u2019s grounds take three days and three nights.\n\u00a0\nIn little more than two weeks, Jimin\u2019s entire life has changed. Where he\u2019d grown up thinking he would follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and take a position on the town\u2019s council, perhaps even become mayor, he now finds himself as having little more value than livestock.\n\u00a0\nIf the stories were true, he\u2019d be bound to some wolf for the rest of his life. Leaving them would kill them and likely Jimin, too.\n\u00a0\nHis gut churns, queasy and upset, and Jimin finds the woods particularly oppressive this far from home. Everything is tangled together, the thick foliage difficult to navigate through. Werewolves had no purpose for roads and as Jimin and the company his father had gathered weave through the trees, it was clear they had no real path.\n\u00a0\nGa-in had given the town a guiding stone years ago, long before Jimin had even been born. It glowed silver in the presence of werewolves, growing stronger and stronger as they got closer to the Jeon pack\u2019s grounds.\n\u00a0\nJimin spends the journey daydreaming of running away, but he\u2019d never outrun a wolf and the Jeon pack would drag him back to their own grounds or worse, kill him on the spot. His escape would mean nothing to them and running through their territory would translate only to trespassing. For a fleeting moment, Jimin thinks maybe death wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\n\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s here. Despite his anger, Jimin can\u2019t turn a blind eye to his town\u2019s suffering. If a union between his town and the Jeon pack can result in something positive, then isn\u2019t it his duty to go through with this?\n\u00a0\nHe wonders if he\u2019ll ever be allowed to see anyone back home again, if they\u2019ll turn him into one of them. Jimin shudders at the thought of becoming a werewolf, goosebumps raising along his skin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s this way,\u201d someone calls from the front of their party, everyone steering a little more toward the right as they follow the voice. Jimin can see the glow of a bonfire in the distance, smoke disappearing into the night sky, the moon hanging, almost full, in the inky blackness. In a few days, she\u2019ll be at full, and Jimin imagines his mating will coincide with that.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s steed whines as they near, an eerie calm beginning to surround them. The distinct feeling of being watched crawls up Jimin\u2019s back, his hand reaching out to steady his horse as she grows skittish.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe thought perhaps you\u2019d gotten lost.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe voice comes out of nowhere, cutting through the deafening quiet that had enveloped them. A man steps out of the shadows, seemingly from thin air, as the darkness of the woods disappears with the lighting of a lantern. He looks to be about Sungho\u2019s age, hair greying near the roots. It\u2019s long, tied back to keep out of his handsome face. Jimin swallows, taking in the square shape of his jaw, a ruggedness to him brought on by age.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s horse neighs, rearing her forelegs up as she startles. His own heartbeat jumps, beating rapidly in the presence of the man. More faces have appeared behind him, all carefully neutral but their eyes are sharp, calculating. One wrong move could mean disaster.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s father dismounts from his horse, a smile on his features as he walks toward the man who\u2019d spoken. \u201cThe journey is longer when there are more of us, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSungho,\u201d the man greets, a smile gracing his face as he extends his arms outward. Jimin watches as his father hugs him, dread coiling in the pit of his belly. Was the friendliness just for show? How could his father get along so well with the leader of an enemy they\u2019d been fighting off for years?\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha Jaehyuk,\u201d Sungho smiles, stepping back. He seems at ease, which only spikes Jimin\u2019s anxiety, his suspicion. Had they already come to a truce?\n\u00a0\nThe questions race through Jimin\u2019s mind as he keeps his expression as bland as possible. Jimin has no intention of insulting his future...family.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone is here?\u201d Jaehyuk asks, turning toward the rest of them. His eyes meet Jimin\u2019s, glowing red for a split second. Jimin\u2019s eyes widen, startled, and Jaehyuk smiles, something calculated and careful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps he can sense Jimin\u2019s hostility. After all, they were werewolves. Couldn\u2019t they smell the fear on humans?\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sungho answers, gaze settling on Jimin as well. Jimin takes it as a cue to dismount, brushing his jacket down. A nervous hand cards his hair back, out of his face, as he pats his horse to settle her before walking toward Sungho and Jaehyuk. \u201cThere are twenty of us. I hope that is amenable? We didn\u2019t want to put too great a strain on the pack in accommodating us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d Jaehyuk assures easily, his gaze never leaving Jimin as he approaches.\n\u00a0\nA shiver runs up Jimin\u2019s spine, the realization that he is much smaller than Jaehyuk dawning on him as he closes the gap. On his horse, he hadn\u2019t realised the size of the man, but he\u2019s easily more than a head taller than Jimin. He even surpasses Jimin\u2019s father but the difference is less apparent. Jimin has his mother\u2019s shorter stature, not his father\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, our guest of honour,\u201d Jaehyuk greets, the men behind him shifting to stare openly at Jimin now, too.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a little too much, to be under such intense scrutiny. Jimin finds himself straining to his full height, chin jutting out, refusing to be cowed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Alpha Jeon,\u201d Jimin states, voice cutting through the quiet of the woods. He might have to look up to meet Jaehyuk\u2019s eyes, but he maintains eye contact, features purposefully impassive.\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk laughs, a loud bellow of delight. His eyes crinkle up and Jimin nearly lets his surprise slip onto his face. His hands curl into fists at his sides, finding the display to be purposefully humiliating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour father didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Jaehyuk grins, seemingly pleased. \u201cHe\u2019ll fit right in, Sungho.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith that, he turns toward Jimin\u2019s father, and motions toward the pack settlement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s left baffled, unsure what to make of Jaehyuk\u2019s behaviour. He can only assume that he\u2019s made a good impression on the man from the way his disposition has relaxed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone else, humans and werewolves alike, follow after Jaehyuk and Sungho, the glow of the bonfire growing brighter and brighter. Jimin guides his horse by her reins, keeping close to her as he occasionally lets his eyes drift to the werewolves. Most of them are a lot older than Jimin. He wonders if the wolf he\u2019s been promised to is among them.\n\u00a0\nAs they enter the settlement, Jimin can see the massive bonfire built in the center, bodies surrounding it as they eat and dance. It isn\u2019t that different from town, log houses and cabins scattered around the settlement in a bit of disarray. He can make out the blacksmith\u2019s smithy, and what appears to be a baker\u2019s hut. A slew of new questions buzz around in his head, but Jimin doesn\u2019t get wrapped up in them. He\u2019s sure in due time, he\u2019ll figure out how things work in the pack.\n\u00a0\nIf he\u2019s honest, he\u2019d half expected them to be living out of tents; the pack had long since set up permanent residence here, however, so why wouldn\u2019t they build permanent homes, too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNamjoon, Jeongguk,\u201d Jaehyuk calls, halting as he turns to the group of werewolves that had accompanied him to greet them. Two werewolves step forward, one slightly taller than the other. They\u2019re both well built, sturdy and honed from years spent hunting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes father?\u201d the taller one asks, blond hair swept back. He looks softer than his counterpart, whose sleeveless tunic reveals thick, corded muscle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake our guests to their lodgings,\u201d Jaehyuk instructs, sparing his son a glance. Perhaps they were both the alpha\u2019s children? The other wolf had said nothing so far, but Jimin can see the resemblance between them in their prominent noses and strong jaws. \u201cAnd then bring them over to the feast.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFeast?\u201d Sungho questions, a brow arched at Jaehyuk.\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk grins, clapping Sungho\u2019s back. \u201cWith such a momentous occasion before us, I thought a feast was appropriate. Unfortunately, my pack grew impatient and started without you. I hope you do not take offence.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNone taken,\u201d Sungho brushes off, allowing Jaehyuk to steer him toward the bonfire. \u201cWe\u2019re honoured by your hospitality.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the werewolves follow after them while Jimin and his party turn toward Namjoon and Jeongguk. Jimin isn\u2019t sure who is who, but he awaits their instructions, can sense the apprehension from his townfolk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s right this way,\u201d the taller one says, voice gentle. Jimin finds it a little surprising but nods, following after him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs there anywhere we can leave the horses?\u201d Jimin asks, a little uneasy. He can\u2019t say he feels entirely comfortable in the current environment. \u201cI imagine you don\u2019t have a stable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeongguk has made a clearing for them. Your father had advised you\u2019d be riding in on them,\u201d the taller one \u2015 Namjoon, Jimin concludes \u2015 answers. Jimin nods, gaze flickering over to Jeongguk. He hasn\u2019t said a word, dark eyes finding Jimin\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nSomething cold shudders through Jimin, his grip on his horse\u2019s reins tightening. It feels like he can\u2019t breathe, nearly stumbling over his own two feet. Jeongguk looks away first, unaffected, but the intensity of his gaze simmers in the pit of Jimin\u2019s belly, terrifying.\n\u00a0\nThey come to the clearing before Jimin realises, careful to avoid looking at either werewolf, and focusing instead on his surroundings. He feels unsettled, almost wishes he could just stay here and not go to this feast. As they all tie their horses to pegs hammered into the ground, Jimin wonders where they will be staying.\n\u00a0\nHis father had advised them they didn\u2019t need to bring their tents, that it would be disrespectful to the pack. Jimin wonders when his father had become so close to the pack, how long he had been trying to create this alliance. It makes him angry, a sizzling sort of ache sitting in his chest as he thinks of his own father trying to give him away to their enemy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Namjoon says, grabbing the quieter wolf\u2019s attention. They whisper together and Jimin does his best to discreetly watch them. Jeongguk seems to listen obediently to Namjoon, respectful of whatever instruction he is being given.\n\u00a0\nJimin smooths a hand over his horse\u2019s mane, petting her as she remains standing, still skittish. He wishes he could calm her down, but Jimin doesn\u2019t exactly feel any better.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf everyone is ready, I will show you where you will be residing before taking you to the feast,\u201d Namjoon says, voice loud as it rings over their party. The group of them glance around at each other, grabbing their packs from their horses as they head toward Namjoon.\n\u00a0\nJimin finds himself at the back of the crowd, ready to follow after everyone when Jeongguk steps up to him, expression less severe. He looks almost polite.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m to take you to see the Head Omega,\u201d Jeongguk tells him. It doesn\u2019t sound like Jimin has any say in the matter so he nods, a little stiff.\n\u00a0\nNamjoon\u2019s taken everyone else in a different direction, closer to the feast but still near the outskirts of the pack\u2019s little village.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk, however, begins walking further into the pack\u2019s grounds, Jimin keeping up with his long, purposeful strides. He\u2019s broad shouldered, the sleeveless shirt he wears tucked into a pair of loose linen pants. Jimin can see the sharp cut of his shoulder blades through the shirt, his waist slim despite the thickness of his thighs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis hair\u2019s longer than how any human would wear it, falling around his ears and framing his face. Still, it\u2019s too short to tie up unlike Jaehyuk\u2019s. Jimin can\u2019t seem to get the intensity of his gaze out of his mind, his eyes otherwise soft and doe-like.\n\u00a0\nBy all accounts he\u2019s attractive, if quiet and a little broody. The more he thinks about it, however, the less he can see a resemblance between Jeongguk and Namjoon. Perhaps only Namjoon is Jaehyuk\u2019s son, but Jeongguk bears a greater resemblance to Jaehyuk than Namjoon.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk weaves him through the pack\u2019s cabins, Jimin attempting his best to memorise his surroundings. He doesn\u2019t feel like he can let his guard slip, a dull ache settling in his shoulders as they finally come to a stop in front of a rather large log cabin. An old lady stands in the front porch, her hair as white as snow, hands settled on top of her cane.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou made it,\u201d she smiles, nodding at Jeongguk, who gives her an even warmer smile in return as he heads up the few steps to the cabin. Jimin watches as he rests his forehead against the old lady\u2019s, a strange show of affection. He\u2019s never seen anything like it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo enjoy the feast,\u201d she says, patting Jeongguk\u2019s cheek. As he turns back around, his expression turns impassive once more, and Jimin imagines he is just as wary of a human wandering around amongst his pack as Jimin is of the werewolf pack itself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoseok!\u201d the old lady calls as Jeongguk sets off past Jimin. He smells like fire, smoke and ash.\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t look after him, sucking in a deep breath before he takes a step up to the cabin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome along child,\u201d she smiles at him, kinder than anyone has been with Jimin since coming to the werewolf village.\n\u00a0\nWhoever she\u2019d called has finally made it the front door, a shock of red hair greeting Jimin as Hoseok helps the old lady inside. Jimin follows after them, forces himself to not fist his hands together as his heart fills with trepidation.\n\u00a0\nThe log cabin extends far back, two large fireplaces burning at opposite ends. There are fur pelts lying on top of several large beds with a large communal area in the middle of the cabin. Kids\u2019 toys and books lie on the floor where a large fur rug sits.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk had referred to the old lady as the Head Omega, whatever that is. Jimin has never heard of an omega before, knowing only of the pack alpha.\n\u00a0\nHoseok has guided her to a rocking chair sat right by a fireplace, the logs crackling in the heart of the hearth. She is slow in her old age and Jimin wonders how old she truly is. Werewolves live much longer than humans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs she takes her seat, her chair creaking back, Hoseok goes to stand behind her, his gaze fixed on Jimin. Hoseok is young, looks like he could be Jimin\u2019s age; his expression is carefully polite, the shape of his mouth reminding Jimin of a heart. He walks in a little closer, stopping at the edge of the fur pelt that\u2019s been spread before the fireplace. It\u2019s big enough for a few people to sleep on, looks soft to the touch.\n\u00a0\nJimin is still wearing his boots.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSit, please,\u201d she instructs motioning to the space in front of her. Jimin\u2019s not sure he wants to but he is compelled to nonetheless. He slips his boots off first, leaving them to sit along the edge of the furs as he goes to sink down to his knees in front of the woman, legs tucked under him.\n\u00a0\nHoseok remains standing until the old lady makes an annoyed sound, tugging on his arm. He moves to sit next to Jimin, careful to leave space between them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow was your journey?\u201d she asks, assessing Jimin.\n\u00a0\nJimin swallows, throat tight. \u201cIt was okay. Thank you for asking ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe laughs, eyes disappearing as they crinkle up in her mirth. Jimin fights back his agitation, wondering why it was that everyone seemed to laugh in reaction to him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my, please, call me Minsook. I have never been called \u2018ma\u2019am,\u2019\u201d she says, and despite Jimin\u2019s annoyance, he finds that she is still kind. She doesn\u2019t give off the dangerous edge he\u2019d read from both Jaehyuk and Jeongguk. \u201cYou humans are a little strange.\u201d\n\u00a0\n I could think the same of you , Jimin wants to say, but he remains quiet, careful. Perhaps it\u2019s foolish for him to treat everyone like an enemy, but Jimin can\u2019t afford to let his guard down. Who knows what will become of him once his father and the townsfolk leave him here.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour apprehension is not misplaced,\u201d she adds quietly, leaning forward in her chair. Hoseok makes to move, rising in his seated position, but she waves him off. Instead, she extends a hand, carefully reaching out for Jimin\u2019s cheek, and cradles it, her touch warm and then gone. His heartbeat soars, palms sweaty. \u201cBut you have little to fear in my presence. Rather, it is my heart that aches for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s brows furrow just the slightest but he keeps quiet, unsure how to respond.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a difficult decision to leave everything you have ever known behind.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jimin says, mouth dry. He can\u2019t say he enjoys her pity.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs Head Omega it is my duty to aid you in finding your place amongst us and to help you through the days to come. Hoseok,\u201d she nods in his direction, \u201cis my grandson. He will help you, too. Perhaps more than I. Until your mating occurs, you are to stay here, with us in the communal omega cabin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat...what is an omega?\u201d Jimin asks, his curiosity getting better than him.\n\u00a0\nMinsook smiles. \u201cHoseok will explain the pack\u2019s dynamics to you, fret not. Go and enjoy the feast for now, meet everyone. You are our guest of honour, after all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin nods, eyeing Hoseok as he stands. He touches foreheads with Minsook the same way Jeongguk had and extends a hand to Jimin to help him rise. To Jimin\u2019s surprise, he takes it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI extend the Jeon pack\u2019s warmest regards to you, Jimin,\u201d Minsook says, looking up at him. \u201cWe are grateful to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin finds he can\u2019t form any words, conflicted by his circumstances. He nods again, hand slipping out of Hoseok\u2019s. Minsook doesn\u2019t seem upset by his silence, offering him another smile before her gaze drifts to the fireplace.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe better get going or there\u2019s going to be nothing left to eat!\u201d Hoseok says, nudging Jimin by the shoulder. The familiarity of the action throws Jimin off but he follows after Hoseok, who flashes Minsook a big grin from the door. \u201cSee you later grandma!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake care of our guest,\u201d Minsook replies, \u201cand have fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin slips his boots back on and walks out of the cabin after Hoseok, allowing him to guide them to the bonfire.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe feast goes about as well as Jimin could have imagined. The humans sit mostly huddled together away from the werewolves, a few wolves braving human company out of curiosity. They ask numerous questions, animated and eager to acquire more knowledge.\n\u00a0\nJimin himself sits next to Hoseok, a rather large tree stump serving as a sort of makeshift table for them. He keeps an eye on his father, seated next to Jaehyuk as they speak amicably while doing his best to keep up with Hoseok. He has an energy and friendliness that reminds Jimin of Taehyung, appetite disappearing as he sits with the knowledge that he will never see him again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo humans not eat much?\u201d Hoseok asks, looking down at Jimin\u2019s hardly touched plate.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not very hungry,\u201d Jimin mutters, finds it difficult to just make peace with his future. He\u2019d come across werewolves before. Not from the Jeon pack, likely rogues as they\u2019d been quite feral, violent and unpredictable as they\u2019d attacked the town. Jimin had killed one, sword spearing the creature right through the head as it\u2019d almost ripped his throat out. He still had scars along his torso from where it had managed to claw through his clothes and flesh.\n\u00a0\nThese werewolves, they\u2019re too human for Jimin\u2019s liking. He can\u2019t reconcile their hospitality with the monsters that had attacked their village and taken the lives of two of their villagers. One had been a child.\n\u00a0\nIt makes him uncomfortable, uneasy.\n\u00a0\nHe glances back to his father and finds him laughing, carefree. Jimin imagines he\u2019s quite proud of himself, of the legacy he is about to set.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not happy about the mating are you?\u201d Hoseok asks, chin perched on the palm of his hand, the same arm propped up on the tree stump.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s silence is answer enough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen why agree?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin glances up at Hoseok, lips pursing. \u201cI don\u2019t have to like it to agree.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha Jaehyuk\u2019s children weren\u2019t too happy either,\u201d Hoseok says, watching Jimin carefully. \u201cThe pack has lost wolves to humans, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood on both sides,\u201d Jimin grits out, doing his best to keep his composure. Part of him wants to run back to his steed and just ride out. If he died, he died.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Hoseok agrees, leaning in a little. \u201cIf you come into this union with an open-mind, you will withstand it a lot better. Although, I don\u2019t think your anger is misplaced. Everyone wishes to mate or marry for love.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin had never thought about marriage, had no interest in one day having his own family. The world was too cruel a place to imagine bringing new life into it. And even if Jimin had entertained such a notion, he\u2019d never been interested in women. The first time he\u2019d sucked a cock, he\u2019d been fifteen and in the back of the schoolhouse, two of the older boys taking turns on his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI only want the safety of my townsfolk.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s very noble of you,\u201d Hoseok smiles, and Jimin wishes he could detect a hint of condescension but he doesn\u2019t. Hoseok exudes the same warmth as his grandmother and Jimin can\u2019t begrudge him that.\n\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t quite figured out why he had to meet Minsook but if she was Head Omega, her position in the pack must be of great importance. He stares at Jaehyuk, concluding that in the hierarchy she must still be less than pack alpha but important enough that he had to have her blessing, perhaps.\n\u00a0\nJimin clears his throat, swallowing as he rubs his hands against the fabric of his riding pants. Now is as good a time as any to learn more. \u201cThe Alpha\u2019s children, which one am I\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe question trails, Jimin unsure if he really wanted to know. Still, it would be nice to put a face to his future mate.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Alpha Jaehyuk has three children of his own blood and flesh,\u201d Hoseok starts, head craning over to a different corner of the bonfire, \u201cand eight more he calls his own. A few of them are his sister\u2019s and others are orphans.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s followed Hoseok\u2019s line of vision, face flushing when he spots a few werewolves copulating right in the open, uncaring of who could see them. Jimin thinks he can see Jeongguk amongst them, his cock buried in the ass of the person he has in his lap as they bounce over it. Jeongguk\u2019s gaze meets Jimin\u2019s and his eyes widen, heat rising to his cheeks.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d heard that werewolves had no human tendencies of shame, but to see it with his own eyes is very jarring. Jimin looks away immediately, heart hammering in his chest, finds Hoseok\u2019s brows furrowed as he looks at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour father did not tell you that any of the Alpha\u2019s children can lay claim on you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe moon above, they\u2019ve really told you nothing!\u201d Hoseok scowls, shifting so that he\u2019s seated closer to Jimin and not across from him. The sudden closeness nearly makes Jimin jump, images of what he\u2019d just seen flashing before his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe pack alpha, he has eleven children. Any of them can claim you in the run. Although, it likely will not be Namjoon or any of the omegas.\u201d Hoseok says this all conspiratorially, pointing a little too obviously at a silver haired man sitting under a tree a little ways off. Namjoon is seated next to him along with three others.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s Min Yoongi. Namjoon\u2019s smitten with him. His wolf won\u2019t recognize anyone else as his mate at this point, I don\u2019t think, even if Yoongi is no omega.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean any of them can \u2018claim\u2019 me?\u201d Jimin asks, a panicked edge creeping into his voice. All Jimin had to work with were the rumours he heard. Nothing he knew about werewolves was absolute besides his knowledge on how to kill one. \u201cWhat\u2019s a run?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWerewolves mate for life, which I\u2019ll assume you were aware of,\u201d Hoseok explains, and Jimin was aware of that little tidbit, \u201cand the way we go about that is through the summer solstice run. Everyone who wants to be claimed agrees to go on the run and if someone in the pack is interested in you, they\u2019ll participate in the run to make their claim. It\u2019s tradition, mimics the nature of wolves going hunting but in this case the prey is their mate.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHoseok holds a hand out when Jimin opens his mouth to ask more questions, quietly assuring him that he would explain. \u201cEvery wolf has a status in the pack. Alpha, beta, or omega. Betas are the most like humans, but some can lean alpha or omega. Alphas tend to lead the pack, they hunt and protect the pack while omegas tend to be the ones who nurture it and tend to the inner workings.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUsually, alphas and omegas claim each other and betas claim other betas. You can have some crossover but it\u2019s rare.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI still don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jimin starts, none of this making any sense. He doesn\u2019t want to look away from Hoseok, lest he see anything else he\u2019d rather not. \u201cYou\u2019re an omega, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hoseok answers, smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it and I\u2019ll explain it all. After all, you\u2019re pack now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin feels overwhelmed with new information, the food on his plate looking even more nauseating now. \u201cRight, okay. And there\u2019s no other way to do this? Beside a run?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHoseok shakes his head. \u201cWerewolves mate when we\u2019re in our wolf form. The bond won\u2019t form unless we\u2019re at our most primal. The run also ensures no one is claimed against their will, keeps an order to things.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin sucks in a breath, nodding. He\u2019d heard about that but had hoped it was a rumour. Something passed along to instill fear in humans.\n\u00a0\nHe feels a different kind of fear now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Alpha Jaehyuk was the one who decided any of his children could,\u201d Jimin swallows down his distaste, \u201cclaim me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think had Namjoon accepted you, he wouldn\u2019t have left it so open.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut Namjoon is in love with Yoongi\u2026\u201d Jimin trails, piecing it together. \u201cIs he the Alpha\u2019s real son?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s Alpha Jaehyuk\u2019s successor,\u201d Hoseok says, drumming his fingers against the tree stump. \u201cHe treats all his children the same.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo he isn\u2019t then,\u201d Jimin concludes, which makes sense. It explains the lack of resemblance. \u201cHe is an alpha in love with an alpha.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHoseok seems surprised that Jimin\u2019s put two and two together, both of them glancing in the direction of Namjoon and Yoongi. It\u2019s just the two of them now, huddled together under the tree.\n\u00a0\nJimin stands up, weary from the days spent travelling and anxious from what Hoseok has just revealed to him. He wants sleep, wants to forget about his future, and pretend that things were still the same as they had always been.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d Jimin says, looking down at Hoseok. \u201cI\u2019ll be heading back to the cabin. Thank you for your kindness.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d Hoseok offers but Jimin shakes his head, giving him a small smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI appreciate it but I\u2019ll find my way. You\u2019ve already spent your whole night with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHoseok seems surprised but nods, \u201cThank you, Jimin.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf nothing else, Jimin can see a friend in Hoseok and he feels grateful for that. When he looks over to where his father had been sitting, he finds the bench empty. The crowd\u2019s gotten smaller, the bonfire shrinking.\n\u00a0\nJimin can hear some of the wolves fucking, refuses to look in their direction as he strides back to the cabin. Tomorrow would be a new day and he would swallow his bitterness and life would go on.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the days to come, Jimin learns more.\n\u00a0\nHe sleeps next to the fireplace on one of the fur pelts, Hoseok sleeping next to him. At first he\u2019d been startled but Hoseok sticks to him like honey, showing Jimin around and side-eyeing anyone who appeared to give him any trouble.\n\u00a0\nHoseok is alarmingly tactile but Jimin soon realises that all werewolves are. Touch comes to them as easily as words and Jimin often sees werewolves scenting each other, faces nuzzling into necks and chests. They seem to always cling to one another, brushing the hair out of each other\u2019s faces and holding hands as they walk through the village. It\u2019s an intimacy Jimin is wholly unfamiliar with.\n\u00a0\nJimin also meets all of Alpha Jaehyuk\u2019s children, confirming that Jeongguk is his son, albeit the youngest of the ones his mate, a beta woman, has borne. Of the eleven, three are omegas, another three betas, and the remaining five alphas. But Hoseok tells him that one of the betas and one of the alphas are both too young for a run so that rules them out.\n\u00a0\nAll in all, Jimin is looking at six possible mates (five if he eliminates Namjoon), a mix of men and women, alphas and betas. Hoseok has also told him that unlike humans, male omegas could give birth and female alphas could not. It adds yet more complexity to Jimin\u2019s predicament.\n\u00a0\nWouldn\u2019t whoever mated him want children? Jimin is not an omega and he is also not a woman.\n\u00a0\nHe imagines the most obvious choice for his mate will be the one beta daughter, Joohyun. She is Alpha Jaehyuk\u2019s eldest and carries herself like an alpha despite being even smaller than Jimin.\n\u00a0\nDespite his observations, Hoseok tells him it could still be anyone. The pack raised the children together and blood lines meant very little to them. It\u2019s why Namjoon, despite being Jaehyuk\u2019s nephew, is still favoured as his successor.\n\u00a0\nJimin spends more time amongst the werewolves than his own townsfolk, feeling distant. The pack is his family now anyways, even if the circumstances aren\u2019t by any means ideal. He finds that the werewolves are kind to him, accepting, and it forces him to let go of some of his own hostility. He goes with Hoseok when he has to fulfil his duties, be they helping with the pups at the nursery or to go foraging with the omegas and betas when Hoseok is instructed to do so by Minsook.\n\u00a0\nJimin understands her role better, too. She seems to run the pack like Jimin\u2019s mother did just their household. Everyone seemed to have a role, responsibilities to fulfill, although, Hoseok has pointed out that there are alphas who help with the cooking and cleaning, too, and omegas who go out to hunt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin finds he enjoys the busyness of things, enjoys the treks out into the woods to forage and even the difficult work of skinning the prey that\u2019s brought in every day by the hunters. He thinks he would enjoy going out for a hunt, too.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019re trudging back to the village on one such excursion when a boar comes hurtling their way, clearly being chased as it squeals loudly. Jimin\u2019s surprised that the alphas have allowed it so close given their aggressive nature.\n\u00a0\nHe has the dagger he keeps strapped to his calf in his hand in seconds, attention caught between the animal barreling toward them and the omegas around them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLeave your baskets and climb!\u201d Jimin shouts, pointing toward the trees. The omegas, terrified, obey at once, clamouring up the trunks of the trees around them as quickly as they can. They\u2019re fairly adept at it, some of the fruit the pack gathered higher up in the branches of trees.\n\u00a0\nJimin follows after Hoseok as he pulls himself up, dagger in his mouth as he climbs. He couldn\u2019t let the boar get to the pack\u2019s village, mind racing, but without his sword, he\u2019s not quite sure he\u2019ll be able to inflict much damage.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s with little thought to his own safety that Jimin jumps, timing it as soon as the boar nears them close enough. He barely manages to land on top of the animal despite it being larger than him, frantically trying to get a grip on its fur. The boar\u2019s shrieks as Jimin digs his thighs around the animal, fighting the boar's attempts to throw him off as it thrashes wildly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJimin!\u201d Hoseok screams from somewhere above as Jimin struggles to keep himself on top of the beast, hands fisting into the boar's coarse fur. Behind him, he can hear howls, but Jimin has no time to wait. He sinks his dagger into the side of the boar\u2019s head, yelping as it finally manages to toss him off.\n\u00a0\nJimin flies through the air, tumbling into the ground with a loud \u2018oof\u2019 as the boar screams in agony. His back hits a tree\u2019s trunk as he skids along the earth to a stop, the boar making to charge at him just as a massive black wolf attacks it.\n\u00a0\nIn seconds, the boar\u2019s screaming is cut off, blood splattering to the ground as its throat is ripped out by the wolf. Jimin scrambles up to his feet, wincing at the pain in his side as Hoseok yells out his name again, jumping from the tree.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s next to Jimin in a flash, eyes wide with shock as he checks Jimin over. \u201cAre you crazy!? That thing could have killed you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jimin reassures, careful to keep the pain off his face. \u201cBesides, if it had made it to the village, it could have hurt one of the kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWha \u2015 Jimin! The alphas were giving it chase, it would have been fine!\u201d Hoseok says, still fussing over Jimin. He pats the dirt off of Jimin\u2019s clothes, gasping when he notices that his pants have torn along the thigh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoars are a lot faster than you think,\u201d Jimin tells Hoseok mildly, scowling as he sees the tear himself. These were his favourite pair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Alpha Jaehyuk, his voice booming over the scene before him. The omegas have come down from the trees, one of them still catching her breath from where she stands behind Jaehyuk. She must have gone to get him after Jimin pulled his little stunt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFour more werewolves have joined the first. Jimin watches, eyes wide in awe, as they shift. Bones crackle, claws retracting to hands, fur vanishing into smooth skin as animal turns to human. Jimin\u2019s breath sits lodged in his throat as he takes in Jeongguk, blood from the boar dribbling from his mouth down his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe other werewolves are younger than Jeongguk save one, who Jimin recognizes as Yoongi. He\u2019s scowling at the younger wolves, who all appear to be no older than their fourteenth or fifteenth year.\n\u00a0\nJimin steadfastly keeps his gaze from dropping lower than anyone\u2019s chest, still not entirely comfortable with nudity the way werewolves seemed to be. He especially avoids looking at Jeongguk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cA boar was charging in our direction, Alpha,\u201d Hoseok says, standing between Jaehyuk and Jimin as if to protect him.\n\u00a0\nHe stays quiet, Jaehyuk\u2019s gaze falling to the boar. Jimin\u2019s dagger is still sticking out of its head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd how,\u201d Jaehyuk says, voice tight with fury as he turns to his son, \u201cdid the boar make it  this close to the village?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was our fault Alpha!\u201d one of the other werewolves says, clearly the bravest of the three standing by Yoongi. \u201cWe...we thought we could take it down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk rubs a hand over his face, sighing, the anger he\u2019s feeling ebbing off of him. \u201cYou three are aware that you\u2019re not to make any kills on your own?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes Alpha,\u201d they all chime together, sounding properly mollified. The one in the front, possibly the oldest among them even ducks his head. Jimin\u2019s learned that to be a sign of submission.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just lost your hunting privileges for the next two weeks,\u201d Jaehyuk says, his composure entirely back. Jimin finds himself impressed. \u201cNow get back to the pack!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe wolves all nod meekly, heads bowed as they head in the direction of the village. Jaehyuk orders the omegas all lingering around to head back with him, but Hoseok stays rooted to the spot. Jaehyuk doesn\u2019t seem to be upset by this, his attention already fixing on Yoongi and Jeongguk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere were you while they were chasing down a damn boar on their own?\u201d he snaps, his annoyance back in one fell swoop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were giving chase to a herd of deer, Alpha,\u201d Yoongi answers in Jeongguk\u2019s stead. \u201cIt was my responsibility to look after the pups, I apologise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk doesn\u2019t seem pleased with the apology at all. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeongguk was \u2015 \u201d Yoongi starts but one look from Jaehyuk shuts him up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was leading the hunt, Pa,\u201d Jeongguk says, still covered in blood. Jimin finds he can\u2019t look away. \u201cI gave chase as soon as we realised what was happening.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk\u2019s jaw clenches as he nods. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s acceptable. Is everyone else still hunting?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Namjoon\u2019s leading them,\u201d Jeongguk explains, and Jimin has noticed that Jeongguk has a certain reverence for Namjoon. He wonders what that\u2019s about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJimin,\u201d Jaehyuk says, his ire now fixed in his direction.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes Alpha,\u201d Jimin replies, stepping out from behind Hoseok.\n\u00a0\nJaehyuk sighs as he sees him, eyes closing before opening to regard him once more. Jimin notes the hint of red. \u201cYour father certainly meant it when he said you were fearless.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe compliment catches him off guard; Jimin had been expecting a lecture, and he finds he stumbles over his words. \u201cNo, he \u2015 that is \u2015 I was just thinking of the pack, Alpha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe jumped out of the tree Alpha!\u201d Hoseok blurts out, glancing over his shoulder at Jimin. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for your bravery,\u201d Jaehyuk commends, smiling as walks toward the boar. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to roast this boar in your honour since it\u2019s your first kill.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, no Alpha, you don\u2019t \u2015 I didn\u2019t even kill it!\u201d Jimin fumbles with the words, feels flustered as Jeongguk and Yoongi\u2019s gazes fall on him.\n\u00a0\nOf everything Jimin has learned thus far, the most important thing is that Jaehyuk\u2019s children are all wary of him, none of them quite wanting to be the sheep to the slaughter. It almost makes him feel better. Jeongguk has always been the worst, however, jaw clenching in Jimin\u2019s presence, eyes narrowing. There\u2019s a certain aura he has that leaves Jimin\u2019s hackles raised.\n\u00a0\nBut today, with a dead boar lying at his feet and his father praising Jimin, he regards Jimin quite differently. Jimin can\u2019t put a name to the look in his eyes, heart hammering in his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst hit always means it\u2019s your kill,\u201d Jeongguk says, eyes holding Jimin firmly to the spot. His intensity is something Jimin feels unprepared for, tingles dancing up his spine and crackling at the base of his neck. He swallows, hands curling into fists.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk looks away first, always seems to be the one capable of it, and kneels down next to the boar, reaching for the blade to yank it out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jimin yells, rushing forward. Pain shoots up his side, along his ribcage but Jimin ignores it, coming to a halt beside the boar. \u201cIt\u2019s made of silver.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s surprised expression morphs into understanding and he draws his hand back. Jimin reaches for the dagger, pulling it out slowly. He grimaces as blood oozes out of the wound he\u2019s left in the boar, dark fur made darker as blood soaks it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll have father take this back,\u201d Jimin says, surprising even himself. He\u2019d brought the dagger on purpose, sure that he\u2019d never be able to trust the werewolves. But he finds, now, that he can\u2019t justify holding onto his prejudices for anger\u2019s sake.\n\u00a0\nThe full moon is in two days and Jimin\u2019s life would change forever thereafter. He had no intention of moving forward with ill intentions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill you two be able to carry the boar to the village?\u201d Jaehyuk asks, the question directed at Yoongi.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPerhaps with his father\u2019s attention fixed elsewhere, Jeongguk feels braver or perhaps Jeongguk is always this bold \u2015 Jimin suspects the latter \u2015 but he reaches out, hand grazing over Jimin\u2019s ribs. \u201cOmega Minsook will have a salve for your bruise or you can go see the Healer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin finds himself frozen in place, breath caught in his throat as he gives Jeongguk a jerky nod. He\u2019s even more astounded when Jeongguk leans in and licks over Jimin\u2019s cheek, Jimin\u2019s grip on his dagger tightening impossibly as his heart comes to a halt.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s touch is gone just as quick as he moves away, standing up. \u201cThank you for protecting the pack.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s just happened, startling as he feels a hand on his shoulder. It\u2019s Hoseok, barely holding back a shit-eating grin as he gets Jimin to his feet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Hoseok says, attempting to whisper but he\u2019s far too excited and Jimin hardly understands what\u2019s just happened.\n\u00a0\nHis hand goes to his cheek dumbly, wincing when he feels the cut. He must have scraped the skin when he\u2019d fallen. The realization doesn\u2019t fall on him until Hoseok\u2019s dragged him back to the village, practically buzzing as he grips Jimin tightly.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk had licked his wounds, a sign of kinship among the werewolves.\n\u00a0\nIt sinks down to his belly, heat flushing against his skin and Jimin finds himself incapable of determining if the feeling is welcome but Hoseok\u2019s practically squealing, Jimin\u2019s hand squeezed between his.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he did that!\u201d Hoseok exclaims, eyes alight. \u201cAlpha Jaehyuk was right there! The moon above, that boy is either brave or brainless. I thought my heart was going to rip its way out of my chest, goodness!\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin laughs, falling into Hoseok as he rambles, hand pressed against his chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHoseok had explained that Jeongguk\u2019s dislike of humans came from the fact that Namjoon\u2019s mother had been killed by them. Jimin had essentially ruled him out as having any interest in him, but now doubt fills him. Jeongguk\u2019s forwardness leaves Jimin flustered at best and completely bowled over at worst.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until Jimin\u2019s lying on the fur pelt that night, Hoseok curled up next to him that Jimin can put his finger on it, butterflies swarming around in his belly.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk had looked at him with admiration.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf Jimin had thought the pack had been welcoming initially, he\u2019d been mistaken. As news of his actions travels around in just a singular evening, Jimin is drawn into more hugs and is scented by more wolves than he can count. He is left flustered by each interaction but finds his chest bubbling with happiness.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s as if he has proven himself to them, the likely reluctant tolerance morphing into eager acceptance as they all thank him and congratulate him. Jimin can\u2019t say he was ever given such warmth by even his own village.\n\u00a0\nThe boar he\u2019d killed is saved for the full moon, and Jimin watches it roast in the bonfire now, skin charing brown. His appetite has been gone since he\u2019d woken up that morning, knowing what the night had coming for him. As he sits around the bonfire with the pack and his townsfolk, eyes fixed to the ground, Jimin can\u2019t say he feels the same apprehension he\u2019d felt before coming the pack. Instead, he\u2019s only nervous and maybe even a little excited, and Jimin isn\u2019t all too sure what to do with that either.\n\u00a0\nHe squeezes Hoseok\u2019s hand tighter, having latched onto his friend the second they\u2019d left the omega cabin after they\u2019d prepared Jimin. Hoseok allows Jimin the proximity, occasionally scenting him as if to calm an agitated pup. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work as well and Jimin remains glued to his side.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0He\u2019s had everything explained to him now, the run all but upon them. Alpha Jaehyuk, his mate, and his children sit across from Jimin at the bonfire. Jimin\u2019s own father is seated next to him, but Jimin finds little comfort in his presence.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a certain buzz in the air, the pack restless and Jimin imagines it has something to do with the full moon as well. From what he\u2019s gathered, full moons were usually spent going on pack runs together and then, as Hoseok had put it, fucking under the stars.\n\u00a0\nThe thin linen nightgown he\u2019s been given leaves him a little cold and he wonders how long he\u2019ll be able to run in it once he has to leave the heat of the bonfire. He\u2019s to be given a half hour head start, which is honestly laughable. Jimin couldn\u2019t outrun a werewolf no matter what kind of head start he had.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to eat anything?\u201d Hoseok asks, fretting over him.\n\u00a0\nJimin shakes his head, the mere thought of food made his stomach churn. \u201cI\u2019ll just throw it up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Hoseok says, wrapping his free hand around Jimin\u2019s as well. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin murmurs, and he finds that he believes it.\n\u00a0\nHe had spent the afternoon preparing himself. Unlike male omegas, Jimin didn\u2019t produce any natural slick and had thus spent some time loosening himself up. His ass is still wet from the oil he\u2019d used to prepare himself; Hoseok had advised he\u2019d have no time for anything once he was cornered and claimed.\n\u00a0\nJimin had questioned what would happen if he was claimed by a beta female, not all that keen on the idea. Hoseok\u2019s explanation had only increased Jimin\u2019s trepidation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs he gnaws on his own bottom lip, Jimin finds himself jittering his leg up and down, wishing Alpha Jaehyuk would just announce the run already so he could get this over with. He has no intention of giving in easily, wants to make whoever claims him work for it. Jimin\u2019s going to run as far as he can go, ensuring that he didn\u2019t pass the river in the north as it marked a natural end to the Jeon territory.\n\u00a0\nApparently, the pack had gone to the trouble to mark their territory boundaries visibly for him since he couldn\u2019t rely on scent markers to ensure he didn\u2019t end up in any contested territory. Jimin\u2019s touched by their actions, of course, but he hardly thinks he\u2019s going to make it that far.\n\u00a0\nA drum sounds and a hush falls on everyone, Jimin\u2019s head whipping up to look at Alpha Jaehyuk. He\u2019s standing now, ushering Sungho forward as the drum\u2019s beating slowly ebbs away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTonight marks a momentous occasion,\u201d Jaehyuk says, voice booming over the crowd. Jimin swallows, finds his eyes drifting from the alpha to Jeongguk behind him. He\u2019s staring right at Jimin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur human friends have brought to us a chance to create a new bond, a chance for werewolves and humans to flourish together. I want to thank Sungho for his persistence and for Jimin\u2019s bravery in taking this step forward,\u201d Jaehyuk continues.\n\u00a0\nJimin can\u2019t tear his eyes away from Jeongguk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSungho says something but he doesn\u2019t hear it, tuning out the speeches and the fluff Jaehyuk and Sungho feel are necessary. The back of Jimin\u2019s neck prickles in fear, burning hot as he attempts to keep breathing.\n\u00a0\nMaybe he\u2019d underestimated just how nervous he felt.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s expression is blank, but his eyes are as intense as ever, fixed on Jimin in such a way that he can\u2019t seem to remember how his lungs work. Their paths hadn't crossed directly since the boar incident and yet Jimin had found himself thinking about Jeongguk incessantly. Earning Jeongguk\u2019s trust had left Jimin feeling all too pleased with himself, shocked that he cared so much to be valued among the pack and especially by someone who\u2019d kept him at arm\u2019s length.\n\u00a0\nThe drum sounds once more, snapping Jimin out of his thoughts, attention finally shifting back to Jaehyuk and his father. He feels the heat rise to his face, ashamed that he\u2019d missed most of what they had to say.\n\u00a0\nHoseok lets him go slowly, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek as he urges Jimin up, smiling at him reassuringly. Jimin knows what the second drum means. The run has begun.\n\u00a0\nJimin moves forward to Jaehyuk, feels naked in the nightgown. Minsook stands next to him now, a smile on her face that Jimin finds comfort in. His boots crunch against the earth, hands shaking as he reaches out for the cup of tea he\u2019s meant to drink. Supposedly, it would help hide any remaining trace of his scent.\n\u00a0\nPart of his earlier preparation had been to apply an oil that would erase his scent, too. It would be too easy for the werewolves to find him otherwise.\n\u00a0\nJimin brings the cup to his mouth, the tea lukewarm as it goes down, and hands it back to Minsook once he\u2019s finished. It leaves an herbal taste in his mouth, which Jimin doesn\u2019t find all that pleasing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou will have a full half hour to make it as far as you can as promised,\u201d Jaehyuk says, guiding Jimin to the woods. Everyone seems to follow after them, a rather large sendoff as they wind through the village. Jimin glances at his father when they reach the edge of the woods.\n\u00a0\nThe drumming has gotten louder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood luck, Jimin,\u201d Sungho says, smiling and Jimin only nods, curt. He looks toward the woods, finds a yawning blackness looking back at him.\n\u00a0\nThe final strike of the drum hits Jimin\u2019s ears before the werewolves all howl, frenzy building as Jimin sucks in one big breath. And then he runs.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t look back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t know how far he\u2019s gone but he hears the howls behind him, indicating to him that Jaehyuk\u2019s children had been released to go after him. His stamina isn\u2019t so bad that he\u2019s run out of breath, Jimin continuing on a steady jog, but he knows he\u2019ll be easy to find.\n\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t exactly tried to hide his tracks as he\u2019d sprinted through the woods, heart hammering in his chest.\n\u00a0\nAs he trudges on, he remembers what Hoseok had told him. The claiming could only occur if the werewolf was in wolf form, and to ensure that the bond would form, the werewolves giving chase after him had all drunk some concoction, too. Hoseok had said something about how it was vital that they were at their most primal, since wolf to human bonds tended to be much more fragile.\n\u00a0\nThe ground under him is beginning to incline, and Jimin finds himself tiring, steps slowing down. Goosebumps raise against his skin as thoughts of what awaited him thunder in his mind, unrelenting.\n\u00a0\nHe wishes he\u2019d been allowed to bring some water, mouth dry.\n\u00a0\nJimin wonders if he could maybe hide, beginning to feel a stitch in his side, but the thought is tossed right out of his head when he hears the howl. It\u2019s far too close to give Jimin any chance of successfully hiding. And he\u2019s not sure if climbing a tree would do him any good besides riling up whoever\u2019s managed to find him.\n\u00a0\nThe incline he\u2019s on tires him out much faster, trees beginning to grow sparser.\n\u00a0\nAnother howl booms through the quiet of the woods and Jimin\u2019s skin prickles, this one even closer. Jimin thinks he can hear whoever\u2019s caught up with him, but he\u2019s panting, the hill he\u2019s climbing becoming sharper.\n\u00a0\nAs he stumbles through a bush, Jimin finds himself staring at a steep drop from the hill he\u2019s climbed, heart thudding in his chest. It feels silly to run when he knows he\u2019s meant to be caught but his mind keeps telling him to go, to run until he can\u2019t anymore.\n\u00a0\nThe moon illuminates the night sky and Jimin has never thought it so beautiful as he does now, turning slowly, and seeing the piercing bright red eyes of his captor in the dark. The shadows of the woods hide the wolf, but Jimin watches its eyes move through the dark as it prowls. His chest heaves, burning from the exertion but he really has nowhere to go.\n\u00a0\nTumbling down the hill didn\u2019t sound very appealing.\n\u00a0\nHoseok had said he had to show whoever found him submission, had to accept that they\u2019d caught him unless he did want his throat ripped out.\n\u00a0\nSubmission like this isn\u2019t something Jimin is familiar with but he drops to his knees, swallowing. Hoseok had told him how he needed to pose himself and now, as Jimin hitches the nightgown up, his bare legs meeting the cold ground, heat sears into his skin from the humiliation of it. He allows himself to indulge in the one hope he has.\n\u00a0\nHe wills the wolf to come forward, to reveal itself.\n\u00a0\nJimin tears the night gown right down the middle, flimsy cloth giving way far too easily. When his neck and chest are bare, Jimin tilts his head just slightly to the right, baring his neck.\n\u00a0\nHe is rewarded with a growl and Jimin closes his eyes, breathing through his nose. There is only one person he hopes the wolf is but when he hears another howl, his eyes snap open.\n\u00a0\nSomeone else is there, a second wolf, and Jimin finds he can\u2019t breathe. He watches in frozen terror, waiting to see who would come forward, but nothing seems to happen. There\u2019s a ferocious growl rumbling through the first wolf \u2015 at least Jimin thinks it\u2019s the first one \u2015 that is met with a matching growl.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s heart feels like it\u2019s going to burst out of his chest, unsure of what exactly was happening.\n\u00a0\nThe second wolf seems to step forward, fur an ashy grey and Jimin watches as he nears the first wolf, red eyes flashing. It disappears again, the darkness of the woods swallowing it and Jimin can hear the two wolves growling at one another. A loud snarl is met with a loud smacking sound, and Jimin thinks maybe they\u2019re fighting, eyes widening.\n\u00a0\nHe can\u2019t move, heart hammering in his chest as the sound of the wolves tussling travels to him, two shadows moving against each other emerging in the otherwise still darkness. Jimin\u2019s breath quivers, an angry, booming growl echoing through the night as Jimin watches the second wolf tossed aside, hitting a tree.\n\u00a0\nA cowed sound, something akin to defeat leaves it and the first wolf howls, a sound so dark it rips through the silence of the night and leaves Jimin stunned. The ashy grey wolf whines, picking itself up only to turn tail and run, the sound of its feet hitting the ground travelling back to Jimin.\n\u00a0\nHe looks over to where he thinks the first wolf is and feels his heart stop in his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe wolf is massive, black fur shining under the moonlight as he steps forward. And there is no mistaking who it is, piercing eyes holding Jimin to the spot as if lulled into a trance.\n\u00a0\nJimin can\u2019t look away, swallowing down a wave of emotions. His hands tremble where he holds his nightgown open and the wolf steps forward.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk steps forward.\n\u00a0\nHe takes slow, deliberate steps, circling around Jimin until he\u2019s close enough that Jimin could reach out and touch him. His stomach churns, chest compressed as if a weight had settled on it, Jimin unable to suck a breath in.\n\u00a0\nHoseok had told him the second pose, too. The first showed his submission to the wolf and the second his acceptance of their claim, a willingness to be taken, but it burns through Jimin all the same as he moves, ever so slowly. Jimin tears through the rest of the nightgown, hyper aware of the rumbling growl coming from somewhere deep inside of Jeongguk.\n\u00a0\nHe finds himself quivering bodily, nightgown falling to the ground as Jimin turns so that he\u2019s on his hands and knees, legs spreading open. When he bows down, head meeting the dirt and his ass still pointedly in the air, Jeongguk lets out a roar of appreciation. Jimin\u2019s heart drums against his chest, breath lodged in his throat.\n\u00a0\nEmbarrassment floods through him like a white, hot heat and Jimin\u2019s skin feels too tight as he squeezes his eyes shut. He lets his weight rest against his forehead, hands reaching back to spread his cheeks apart. The cool air of the night does nothing to quell the soaring heat that swarms through him.\n\u00a0\n You have to show that you\u2019re ready for them to mount you, Hoseok had said of the final pose.\n\u00a0\nJimin does his best to hold himself still, face down and ass up as he spreads himself open in invitation. His cock dangles between his legs, adrenaline rushing through him so fast that he\u2019s already half-hard. He\u2019s taken cock before but what on earth could ever have prepared him for this?\n\u00a0\nJeongguk approaches him, a pleased sort of growl rippling from him as his wet snout finally meets Jimin\u2019s skin, trailing up the inside of his thigh. He yelps when a hot tongue licks him, nearly losing his balance.\n\u00a0\nAs Jeongguk\u2019s touch becomes more insistent, Jimin has to brace himself with an arm and lets go of one of his cheeks. He rests his head against his arm, easing some of the strain, as Jeongguk seems to inspect him, sniffing and licking along Jimin\u2019s thighs. He\u2019s easily twice Jimin\u2019s size, clawed paws settled next to Jimin\u2019s spread legs as his hot breath fans over Jimin\u2019s exposed hole.\n\u00a0\nHe shivers, lip caught between his teeth as Jeongguk licks against his hole, wet and slobbery. Spit trickles down his legs and Jimin feels mortified at the way his belly clenches, something hot bubbling under his skin.\n\u00a0\nThe oil he\u2019d used to prepare himself is still wet against his cheeks and Jimin is more grateful than ever that he\u2019d prepared himself. He doesn\u2019t think he could have taken Jeongguk\u2019s wolf cock dry.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk seems to be happy, rumbling from deep in his throat as he inches in closer, his fur soft where it rubs against Jimin\u2019s naked skin. Jimin finds himself staring between his own legs at Jeongguk\u2019s form, sees the expanse of his underbelly as he moves up Jimin\u2019s back, sniffing and rubbing his face into Jimin\u2019s skin along the way.\n\u00a0\n He\u2019s scenting me, Jimin thinks, shivering when Jeongguk\u2019s snout reaches the back of his neck. It\u2019s wet and hot, almost uncomfortable. Jeongguk\u2019s breath falls against his neck, Jimin\u2019s skin prickling at the sensation and then a tongue is licking along the curve of his shoulder and up his neck, teeth nipping at him.\n\u00a0\nJimin squeezes his eyes shut, does his best to keep his neck bare unless he upsets Jeongguk who lets out a huff, shifting. The sound of his paws against the earth fills Jimin\u2019s ears, Jeongguk\u2019s body all but engulfing Jimin\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nAnd then he feels it, body stiffening.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s cock prods at his hole, rubbing against it insistently as the werewolf growls. Jimin forces himself to relax, his shoulders having hunched up. He breathes through his mouth, thinks he can taste the dirt under him.\n\u00a0\nIt pushes in, a whimper escaping Jimin despite his effort to stay quiet. The cockhead is so wide, it feels like he\u2019s being impaled, and Jimin\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s meant to take the rest of it. His cock spears him open, inch by inch, and Jimin finds himself breathless, panting. Jeongguk\u2019s cock is so big it feels like he\u2019s been split open, body forced to make room for him.\n\u00a0\nHe groans, the hand he still has holding one of his cheeks open slipping. Jimin steadies himself on both his arms, humiliation burning through him like hot coal at the way he\u2019s been forced down onto all fours.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk mounts him slowly, perhaps aware that Jimin can\u2019t take his impossible girth all at once. His hands clench into fists as he\u2019s impaled onto Jeongguk\u2019s cock, going deeper than any cock Jimin has ever taken before. Tears cling to his lashes as a jolt of pain runs up his spine, the oil easing Jeongguk\u2019s way in.\n\u00a0\nHis chest heaves, no amount of air feeling like enough as Jeongguk\u2019s cock all but punches everything out of him. Jimin\u2019s gritting his teeth by the time the last of it pushes into him, a haze surrounding his mind.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s steady growl transforms into a howl once he\u2019s buried all the way into Jimin, spreading him open so wide and so deep, Jimin thinks he might break. He gasps, back arching downward as he attempts to adjust to the large intrusion.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s too much.\n\u00a0\nAnd still, Jimin takes it.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk doesn\u2019t move for a while, hot breath falling against Jimin\u2019s neck as he stands above him, his fur so thick, Jimin can barely feel the cool touch of the evening anymore. He feels surrounded, his submission for Jeongguk\u2019s eyes only.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA lick at his neck is all the warning Jimin gets before Jeongguk pulls out, cock dragging against Jimin\u2019s walls and rim. It feels like forever, Jimin whining at the sensation, and then he\u2019s being slammed back into.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck!\u201d he gasps, eyes blurry as he struggles for air. To his horror, he finds he can see the outline of Jeongguk\u2019s heavy cock against his belly, jutting out. He watches as Jeongguk drags himself back out again, and thrusts right back in and groans, unable to look away.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s not sure how long Jeongguk goes like this, pulling out slowly only to fuck back into him sharply, snuffling and rumbling above him as he fucks him.\n\u00a0\nEventually, Jeongguk doesn\u2019t seem to be able to go slow anymore, thrusts turning sharper and harder, his pace unrelenting. Jimin finds himself crying through it, so overwhelmed by the size of him, but the way he feels so full leaves Jimin numb to any other thought.\n\u00a0\n Jeongguk, Jeongguk, Jeongguk, his mind seems to chant, fucked open mercilessly by his future mate.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis own cock drips between his legs as it flops back and forth with each thrust, sometimes slapping into Jimin\u2019s belly uselessly. He\u2019s not sure what compels him but he reaches down, hand smoothing down his abdomen until he can feel Jeongguk\u2019s cock pounding into him through his belly, the shape of his cock pushing into Jimin\u2019s hand. Jimin whines at the sensation, feels his thighs shake from the strain of holding himself up as he\u2019s fucked into.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk is every bit the animal Hoseok had said he would be, fucking Jimin so fast he\u2019s tugged back and forth on the ground, little rocks and pebbles digging into Jimin\u2019s skin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeon \u2015 Jeongguk!\u201d Jimin cries on a particularly hard thrust, his cock dribbling precum as Jeongguk\u2019s cock drags against his sweet spot incessantly. He feels like a rag doll, or worse, someone\u2019s cum rag as Jeongguk fucks him mindlessly, hips snapping at an inhuman pace. Jimin can hardly bear it, eyes nearly rolling into the back of his head as he\u2019s fucked into oblivion.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk\u2019s begun growling, the rumbling growing louder and louder as it vibrates through Jimin. He\u2019s all but pinned Jimin down, pressing against him bodily. His underbelly is even softer than the rest of him, and heat sinks into Jimin until he feels like he\u2019s been lit from within.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s burning, hands scrambling for purchase in the dirt but there\u2019s nothing to dig into, Jimin\u2019s voice coming out in pathetic little whines, \u201cAh \u2015 ah \u2015 ah!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis knees hurt, the sinking realization that it feels good to be fucked like this tearing through all other thoughts and Jimin\u2019s so far gone he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to be ashamed. He moans, drool dripping from his mouth and running halfway down his chin before it drops to the ground. Jeongguk\u2019s hind legs slap against his ass, cock spearing him open, loose and sloppy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Jimin hears himself say, unsure what he\u2019s even begging for but he repeats himself, \u201cp-please, Alpha. Wanna \u2015 \u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s begging is interrupted by a snarl, the base of Jeongguk\u2019s cock inflating as it pushes past Jimin\u2019s rim. He cries out, mind going blank as the bulge forming inside of him grows larger, pressing right against his sweet spot. Jeongguk\u2019s thrusts don\u2019t stop, and instead the knot only rubs against his walls, pleasure coursing through Jimin so sharply he  can\u2019t \u2015\n\u00a0\nHe comes untouched, orgasm ripping through him as he tightens around Jeongguk, sobbing as his climax crashes into him. For a split second, everything goes white, and Jimin\u2019s gasping as he tries to breathe in, the knot growing so impossibly big, Jimin thinks he might just break.\n\u00a0\nThe pleasure is so impossibly loud, leaves Jimin senseless as his little cock spurts out cum, Jeongguk still pounding into him from behind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeongguk,\u201d he croaks out, wincing when Jeongguk just continues to fuck into him, spit dribbling from his mouth and landing wetly on the back of Jimin\u2019s neck. It happens just as quickly, teeth sinking into the curve between his neck and shoulder.\n\u00a0\nJimin screams, pain lasting all but a millisecond before he\u2019s overcome with a feeling so powerful, it blindsides him. It feels like he\u2019s pulsing through a second orgasm, something even stronger than the first as his mind floats off into nothingness. Pleasure seems to ring through him, so numbingly good that Jimin can\u2019t think. His body gives out under him, kept up only by the thick cock buried in his ass, Jeongguk\u2019s hips grinding into him.\n\u00a0\nThe first wave of cum sloshes into him, Jimin groaning as Jeongguk\u2019s teeth pull away, licking at the mark he\u2019s just left behind. He keeps licking, nuzzling into Jimin\u2019s neck as he continues to come, Jimin\u2019s belly beginning to distend as wave after wave of cum is fucked into him.\n\u00a0\nIf Jimin weren\u2019t so far gone, it\u2019d scare him but he\u2019s taken everything Jeongguk\u2019s given him so far, he can take this, too. The outline of Jeongguk\u2019s cock disappears as his belly swells with cum, filled to the brim, and Jimin likens it to that of a pregnant belly, protruding outwards.\n\u00a0\nHis neck pulses, a pool of his own cum right under him as Jeongguk\u2019s cum begins oozing out of his ass, too much to all stay inside of him. Jimin thinks he can feel it trailing down his thighs, consciousness beginning to waver.\n\u00a0\nAbove him, Jeongguk continues to lick at his mark, the pain receding as Jimin\u2019s vision blackens.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere is a warmth, something that feels almost tangible forming inside of him. Jimin wants to reach out and touch it, whining out Jeongguk\u2019s name, a desperate plea for something.\n\u00a0\nHe groans, feels so full it\u2019s unnatural, and just as he thinks the night has taken him, Jeongguk begins shifting. Fur disappears, the paws by Jimin\u2019s head turning into hands, bone cracking and shifting all around him until Jimin only feels hot skin against him, sweaty and sticky.\n\u00a0\nTo his immense relief, Jeongguk\u2019s cock also changes, shrinking in size but he isn\u2019t able to enjoy it for long, vision blacking out.\n\u00a0\nAll he remembers of those last few seconds is a hoarse whisper.\n\u00a0\n Mine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJimin wakes up groggily, feels something hot and wet and supple at his ass, cheeks spread apart as the source attempts to bury in deeper.\n\u00a0\nHis cock is hard between his legs, and Jimin finds himself whining, pushing back into the heat. That seems to rile up the source, a nose digging in between his cheeks as a tongue pushes further into him.\n\u00a0\nHis eyes snap open as he starts making sense of the sensations, body burning hotly as he realises Jeongguk\u2019s eating his own cum out of Jimin\u2019s ass. Heat prickles against his skin, embarrassment washing over him just as quickly, mouth dry. It feels good, a stuttering moan escaping him as Jeongguk seems to suck against his rim.\n\u00a0\nThe pleasure is different than what he\u2019d felt earlier, not as overwhelming, and Jimin allows himself to rock back against Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, his tongue fucking into Jimin. He feels sticky all over, but especially between his thighs and along his cock. His belly is stretched, the skin pulled taut over the bulge that still sits there. Jimin doesn\u2019t know how much cum is inside of him.\n\u00a0\nHis boots also appear to have been taken off, left barefoot, and the nightgown he\u2019d torn off of himself lies under him.\n\u00a0\nThat warm feeling at the back of his mind seems to grow larger, tethering him to something, and Jimin wants to sink into it and disappear forever. He feels strangely safe, a sense of calm ebbing through him.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk draws back, kissing the skin around Jimin\u2019s hole and then his ass, biting into the flesh hard enough to mark. Jimin jerks at every bite, pathetic little cries leaving him as Jeongguk\u2019s mouth trails to his thighs, sucking against his tender skin. Tears cling to his lashes again, his body still sensitive after being fucked out, but Jeongguk seems to only be taking a break for himself, diving back in. He slurps and kisses at Jimin\u2019s hole again, nose rubbing against Jimin\u2019s rim when he kisses lower. For a while, he just lets Jimin roll his hips in little circles against his nose, before he takes back control, his tongue pushing back into Jimin.\n\u00a0\nBig hands dig into the meat of his ass, holding him still, and Jimin can\u2019t help but want the touch to bruise him, a strange obsession with wanting to belong overcoming him. As Jeongguk works him open, growling against Jimin\u2019s hole when he lets out a loud whine, Jimin\u2019s mind fills with a desire to be wholly consumed. He already feels like Jeongguk\u2019s branded him from the inside out, the phantom feel of his cock ramming into him embedded in Jimin\u2019s very being.\n\u00a0\nBut this is different, feels almost frantic as Jeongguk\u2019s mouth licks and sucks and kisses at his hole, tongue digging in as far as it\u2019ll go to make Jimin feel good.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha,\u201d Jimin hears himself say, breathless. If he were lucid he\u2019d be ashamed of how desperate he sounds. \u201cP-please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe feeling, a possessiveness that wants Jeongguk as much as Jimin can feel Jeongguk wants him, swarms into him and Jimin\u2019s left crying, attempting to twist around to see Jeongguk. But he won\u2019t let him, has Jimin pinned to the spot by the grip he has on Jimin\u2019s hips, Jimin\u2019s cock aching to be touched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease please please,\u201d Jimin begs, the warmth inside of him twisting, anguished. \u201cJeongguk, want \u2015 want \u2015 \u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin manages to push himself up on trembling arms, neck craning to look back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSsh,\u201d Jeongguk hums against him, kissing Jimin\u2019s ass again, mouth travelling higher as he leaves kisses against his back. \u201cYour Alpha\u2019s got you, love.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not enough but Jeongguk seems determined to make him come, plunging back into him. His hand rubs up and down Jimin\u2019s side, the other spreading Jimin open as his mouth works over his hole, licking at his rim and leaving open-mouthed kisses against it. Jimin can feel the familiar heat building, a shaking hand finding the one Jeongguk\u2019s gripping him with.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk lets him lace their fingers together, Jimin crying out when Jeongguk\u2019s tongue begins to rub tirelessly against that spot inside of him again. He thinks he\u2019s gone mindless, drool dripping from his open mouth, eyelids fluttering as Jeongguk\u2019s steady rhythm carries him right over the edge, the pleasure building and building until it slams into him all at once.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha!\u201d Jimin exclaims, body spasming as he comes again, the intensity of it surprising Jimin entirely. \u201cO-oh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe collapses down, crying out as his cock twitches, cum spluttering out pitifully, belly pushing against the ground. Cum gushes out of him, Jimin\u2019s body feeling like it doesn\u2019t even belong to him.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk doesn\u2019t let him stay on his belly though, flipping him onto his back in the blink of an eye. Jimin finds himself crying, exhausted, his orgasm still thrumming through his body. He\u2019s so strung out, pushed to his limit and he just wants to sleep but seeing Jeongguk now, Jimin\u2019s heart twists in his chest.\n\u00a0\nThe moon shines down on him, his eyes glowing a bright red, hair framing his handsome face in little waves, damp from sweat. Jimin\u2019s breath hitches in his chest, taking in his broad shoulders and sturdy chest, and the desperation inside of him snaps.\n\u00a0\nHe finds himself reaching out, aching to touch, and Jeongguk comes so readily, already slotted between Jimin\u2019s legs. His mouth is covered in spit and cum but Jimin doesn\u2019t care, arms wrapping around his neck as he pulls him down, distraught and almost panicked.\n\u00a0\nTheir mouths meet, Jeongguk pinning him down and kissing with the same ferocity he\u2019d fucked him with. Jimin whimpers, Jeongguk\u2019s tongue pushing in and he can taste the cum, thinks he should be repulsed but he only clutches at Jeongguk tighter, desperate to be flush against him.\n\u00a0\nThe kiss is sloppy, open-mouthed and wet, Jeongguk licking into Jimin\u2019s mouth, still hungry. Jimin feels the ache building up inside of him settle a little, finds himself sighing, trying his best to keep up with the way Jeongguk moves against him.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s Jeongguk who groans into his mouth, Jeongguk who pulls away first, leaving a trail of kisses along Jimin\u2019s jaw as they catch their breaths before he\u2019s back, biting down on Jimin\u2019s plush lower lip. He sucks it between his teeth, tugging it as he lets go, the kiss filthy as he lets his tongue lick against the roof of Jimin\u2019s mouth.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s mind goes hazy again, content to be showered with attention, to have Jeongguk so close. His nails rake over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders, muscle solid and firm under his touch. The frenzy of it, Jeongguk\u2019s intensity, leaves Jimin breathless and gasping.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha,\u201d he whines, surprised when Jeongguk moans, biting at Jimin\u2019s jaw as he noses along his neck, mouth latching onto the mark he\u2019s left on Jimin permanently. It sends a thrill of pleasure shooting through him, Jimin arching into Jeongguk bodily as he sucks against the mark.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlpha!\u201d he repeats, tugging Jeongguk\u2019s head back up, their mouths crashing together. Jeongguk kisses him again and again, sucking Jimin\u2019s tongue into his mouth, tracing the shape of Jimin\u2019s cupid\u2019s bow with his tongue.\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s never been so thoroughly kissed before, having only exchanged short, messy kisses when he\u2019d rolled around in bed with boys and then men in his town.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJimin,\u201d Jeongguk says, \u201cpretty little darling.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s cheeks burn at the endearment, lashes fluttering shut. He can\u2019t describe how good it feels to hear Jeongguk say his name.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGonna take such good care of you,\u201d Jeongguk tells him, kissing down his neck again. He leaves new marks, sucks against Jimin\u2019s soft skin until he\u2019s sure that there isn\u2019t an inch of his neck left unmarked.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d always heard werewolves were possessive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll mine, aren\u2019t you sweetheart?\u201d Jeongguk murmurs into his skin and Jimin finds himself nodding dumbly, eager to please. \u201cSo well behaved, so perfect. Pretty little thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin can feel the tears slipping down his face as he lets out a wet sob, overwhelmed as he is. His chest feels like it\u2019s caving in, every breath a chore as he greedily accepts every compliment Jeongguk gives him.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s always craved praise, but this feels different, a longing so intense filling him. He feels empty all of a sudden, his ass clenching around nothing as Jeongguk looks down on him, eyes ravenous.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJeongguk, Jeongguk,\u201d Jimin pants, nails digging into his shoulders. \u201cPlease, need you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSsh,\u201d Jeongguk hushes, leaning back down, kissing Jimin sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m here, love. You\u2019re okay. You took me so well, did so good. So good for your Alpha.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd it only makes Jimin cry more, face burying into Jeongguk\u2019s neck as he tries to calm down. \u201c\u2019m good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe best,\u201d Jeongguk affirms, cupping Jimin\u2019s cheek in a hand. \u201cSuch a good little boy, letting your Alpha fuck you, take you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWanna be good,\u201d Jimin insists, words slurring together. Jeongugk brushes the tears away from his face and kisses him, his hard cock pressing against Jimin\u2019s belly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGonna let me fuck you again, aren\u2019t you love?\u201d Jeongguk asks, drawing back and lining himself up with Jimin\u2019s hole. \u201cGonna be a good boy for me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin finds himself agreeing without thought, nodding quickly. \u201cYes, Alpha. Want it, w-wanna feel you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk lets out a growl, slamming into Jimin all in one go and it knocks the breath right out of him. He\u2019s too sensitive, cum pushed out of his hole to make room for Jeongguk\u2019s cock, still bigger than any human cock Jimin\u2019s ever taken.\n\u00a0\nHe pants, eyes squeezing shut as Jeongguk\u2019s girth stretches him out once more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want my cock, huh, pretty darling?\u201d Jeongguk asks, his pelvis flush with Jimin\u2019s ass. Jimin\u2019s eyes slip open, a garbled sort of sound making its way out as he agrees, panting. He\u2019s never felt so pliant before, so eager to be used and to please. \u201cIt\u2019s all for you, for your greedy little hole.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t even understand what\u2019s happening to him, how he\u2019s still conscious, how he\u2019s taking Jeongguk again. But Jeongguk seems to need it, and maybe it has something to do with the bond, or the claiming, Jimin doesn\u2019t know.\n\u00a0\nHe just knows that he feels hot all over, skin too tight, and he wants Jeongguk to  move.\u00a0So he rolls his hips down, moaning as Jeongguk\u2019s cock rubs against his walls. \u201cF-feels good, Jeongguk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Jeongguk hisses, whatever patience he\u2019d had slipping away entirely as he bends Jimin right in half, his legs pushed right up against his head. Both his wrists are pinned above his head as Jeongguk all but snarls, driving into Jimin deeper. \u201cAre you that fucking eager, love? Do you love my cock that much?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly, only yours,\u201d Jimin breathes out, squirming and overheated as the humiliation of his own eagerness catches up to him. He thinks he\u2019d let Jeongguk fuck him anywhere, memories of his first night at the pack's village flashing before his eyes. Jeongguk had fucked someone right in front of him, and Jimin whines, feels pitiful as he sobs with desperation. \u201cP-please, Alpha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuch a good little slut,\u201d Jeongguk coos, snapping his hips into Jimin. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt pulls a throaty gasp of surprise out of him, something curling hotly in his belly as Jeongguk\u2019s hips piston into him in what feels like a trance. It\u2019s so fast and brutal, Jimin hardly has a chance to breathe, fresh tears spilling from his eyes. He\u2019s never been fucked so good.\n\u00a0\nEvery inch of his body thrums in pleasure, and he doesn\u2019t even know how his cock is hard again, but it is, caught between their bodies. He has to fight for every breath, struggling against Jeongguk\u2019s hold on him but the werewolf doesn\u2019t budge, sweat dripping from his brow and landing against Jimin\u2019s skin.\n\u00a0\nHe sobs through it, forced to take it the way Jeongguk wants him to, and Jimin, for the life of him, enjoys it.\n\u00a0\nThe sound of skin slapping against skin mixes with the squelch of Jeongguk\u2019s cum on every thrust in, the obscene noise ringing through the night, falling back against Jimin\u2019s ears like an echo. He can\u2019t escape a single sensation, taken mind, body, and soul.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuch a good boy, taking me so well,\u201d Jeongguk grunts, leveraging himself higher, his cock angled in such a way that Jimin can\u2019t escape the way it thrusts against his sweet spot. \u201cSo fucking tight, sucking me right in, aren\u2019t you, pretty darling?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin\u2019s mind spins, the way Jeongguk fucks him leaving him stupid.\n\u00a0\nHe can feel the way his balls are beginning to tighten, heat curling in his abdomen, like everything in him wants to escape him.\n\u00a0\nHe clenches around Jeongguk\u2019s cock, greedy for Jeongguk\u2019s cum and it has Jeongguk hissing, teeth sink right back into his mark. Jimin cries out, back arching off the ground as Jeongguk\u2019s knot begins to form anew, Jimin\u2019s hands fisting as the exhaustion renders him useless. \u201c\u2019S too much,\u201d he slurs, vision blurred with his tears. \u201cJeon \u2015 ah! \u2015 Jeongguk, please, \u2019s \u2015 can\u2019t \u2015 \u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk only nuzzles into him, sweaty and hot, mouth finding Jimin\u2019s ear. \u201cMade for me, darling. Made for my cock, my knot. Gonna \u2015 gonna fill you up so good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomewhere inside of him, that same warmth and belonging rises like a massive wave, crashing into Jimin all at once. Jeongguk\u2019s voice echoes through his mind,  Mine, mine, mine. \n\u00a0\nJimin whines, feels overwhelmed and so mindless that when Jeongguk\u2019s thrusting finally slows down to just his hips gyrating into Jimin, knot pushing against his sweet spot, the orgasm completely knocks him out.\n\u00a0\nHis mouth falls open in a silent scream, Jeongguk\u2019s cum sloshing into him once more. His own cock only twitches, empty of seed, and it wracks through Jimin, body convulsing with pleasure. His eyes roll into the back of his head, head lolling as he gives in entirely to the pleasure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCum continues to be fucked into him, Jeongguk emptying his seed, and anything he\u2019d lost earlier is replaced, belly straining once more. Jimin groans, Jeongguk\u2019s hold on his hands disappearing, legs falling back down. It\u2019s a temporary relief, kisses pressed to his skin as Jeongguk\u2019s hands smooth down to his belly.\n\u00a0\nThe warmth inside of him burns hot like the sun, consuming him, and Jimin can\u2019t hold onto consciousness any longer, passing out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Jimin wakes up this time, he\u2019s in someone\u2019s arms.\n\u00a0\nHis mind helpfully reminds him it can only be one person. Jeongguk.\n\u00a0\nHis mate.\n\u00a0\nJimin whines, barely a sound as he shifts. Jeongguk hushes him, rubbing a hand against his back. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, darling.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe thing at the back of his mind fills him with comfort, and it\u2019s then that Jimin gets it. The bond. Hoseok had said he\u2019d be able to feel it.\n\u00a0\nJimin pushes back against it and earns himself a chuckle from Jeongguk, his hands hooked under Jimin\u2019s thighs as he carries him. Jimin\u2019s draped over him, face buried into his neck. They must be returning to the village.\n\u00a0\nBelatedly, he realises that Jeongguk\u2019s cock is still buried inside of him, his knot still fully formed. He couldn\u2019t have been out for very long then. The nightgown is draped over his shoulders, although he hardly has any modesty left to protect. Every inch of him aches, covered in Jeongguk\u2019s bites and bruises.\n\u00a0\nJimin curls into Jeongguk, pretends he doesn\u2019t notice how he\u2019s been fucked full of so much cum, his body\u2019s been forced to mould itself to take it. He wonders if it\u2019d have been different were he an omega.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep,\u201d Jeongguk instructs him, voice rumbling through Jimin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis mind obeys immediately.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2b24\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first thing Jimin notices is the softness of the fur he\u2019s lying on top of and the heat against his back. Jimin\u2019s eyes snap open immediately, his surroundings entirely unfamiliar to him.\n\u00a0\nThe second thing he notices is the cock still stuffed in his ass.\n\u00a0\nHeat sinks into his cheeks, a hand reaching over his belly and wincing when he feels the swell. Jimin swallows, notes the source of heat behind him is Jeongguk, one of his arms tossed over Jimin\u2019s waist. His hold is looser than Jimin expected, but then they\u2019re still attached together. The knot is gone, which means Jeongguk had simply not wanted to pull out.\n\u00a0\nJimin flushes at the realization, the skin along the back of his neck prickling. He finds himself reaching back, hand meeting Jeongguk\u2019s abdomen and inching down until he can feel the base of Jeongguk\u2019s cock. He winces when his fingers meet his own puffy rim, wet with cum, Jeongguk\u2019s cock disappearing inside of him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be this eager for another round.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice is hoarse from sleep, his grip on Jimin\u2019s waist tightening as he shifts them ever so slightly.\n\u00a0\nJimin winces, hand coming to grip Jeongguk\u2019s. It hurts when he moves.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Jimin starts, knows he has nothing to be ashamed of but still feels embarrassed, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you pull out?\u201d He sounds petulant, maybe even a little irritated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe fell asleep like this,\u201d Jeongguk answers, moving to pull out of Jimin slowly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImmediately, panic swells inside of him, and Jimin finds himself shouting. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk pauses, returning to press his chest to Jimin\u2019s back. \u201cI thought you wanted me\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI \u2015 Don\u2019t.\u201d Jimin doesn\u2019t like the edge of fear in his own tone. \u201cDoesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk hums, kissing the back of Jimin\u2019s neck as he nuzzles into him. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin doesn\u2019t know how to make sense of anything, feels confused and yet somehow safe. The idea of being parted from Jeongguk terrifies him. Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t leave, he assures himself, but it does nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe bond will be difficult for you,\u201d Jeongguk whispers, his palm rubbing against Jimin\u2019s stomach. Jimin\u2019s breath seems to flutter in his chest at the sensation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m human?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk answers. \u201cIt\u2019ll take some time getting used to. You have no wolf to temper yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat might explain why Jimin had all but lost himself to Jeongguk when they\u2019d fucked, so eager to please and belong. Even now, he wants nothing more than to feel close to Jeongguk, frazzled by the intensity of it.\n\u00a0\nHe figures if they\u2019re stuck like this for now \u2015 despite how Jimin\u2019s sticky and sweaty, cum dried all over him \u2015 he may as well make the most of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you,\u201d he starts, hesitant, \u201cwhy did you claim me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs much as Jimin had ultimately wanted it to be Jeongguk, his instincts revealing as much to him when the moment came, he still wants to know why Jeongguk had tried so hard. He\u2019d even fought someone else off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you unhappy that it\u2019s me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jimim mumbles, heart skipping a beat. Jeongguk\u2019s boldness still threw Jimin off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI claimed you because I wanted to,\u201d Jeongguk answers, somehow pulling Jimin even closer to himself. His next words are breathed right against the shell of Jimin\u2019s ear. \u201cMy wolf recognized you as my mate.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2015 \u201d Jimin feels flustered, feels heat pulse through him. His hand clutches at Jeongguk\u2019s tighter. \u201cI don\u2019t have a wolf. That makes no sense.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJeongguk only shrugs, rising up on an elbow so he can look down at Jimin. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen each other since the run and Jimin\u2019s heart clambers around in his chest, belly swarming with butterflies. Jeongguk is entirely too handsome, large doe eyes heartfelt as he looks at Jimin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m simply telling you what I felt and I always listen to my wolf. It wanted you.\u201d After a pause, he adds. \u201cI wanted you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you hate humans,\u201d Jimin says, voice quiet. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s waiting for Jeongguk to reveal this is all some joke. But they\u2019re mates now, bonded forever. It would kill them both if either rejected the other.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you hate werewolves,\u201d Jeongguk counters, an eyebrow raised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Jimin admits, gaze dropping away from Jeongguk\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk cups his cheek in his palm, forcing Jimin to look at him. \u201cI was wrong, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe leans down and kisses Jimin, the gentlest they\u2019ve shared and the bond sings between them, settling down all of Jimin\u2019s insecurities. Jeongguk pulls back just the slightest, kisses Jimin again, and again, chaster. His fingers stroke Jimin\u2019s cheek, giving him a look Jimin doesn\u2019t understand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho was\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was my sister,\u201d Jeongguk answers, leaning down to nose along Jimin\u2019s jaw. Jimin should have anticipated all the touching, but it still leaves his heart trembling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were that sure?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now,\u201d Jeongguk smiles, amused. He kisses Jimin just under his jaw, nuzzling into his neck, before kissing Jimin again, lazier. It feels good, just exploring each other\u2019s mouths. Jimin finds himself sighing into it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have done what you did,\u201d Jeongguk says, having pulled back, their breaths mingling together. \u201cBut I am grateful for your bravery and for changing my mind.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Jimin can feel that he means it, sincerity bleeding through the bond. He swallows, wishes he didn\u2019t have to feel so vulnerable but there\u2019s nowhere to hide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care that I can\u2019t \u2015 That I can\u2019t give you any children?\u201d Jimin can\u2019t keep himself from asking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere are always pups who have no family,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs, his smile sweet and easy. \u201cI want you just the way you are.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jimin says, sounds stupid in his shock, flushing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJeongguk laughs, leaning down to kiss the corner of Jimin\u2019s mouth, their noses brushing together, before he settles down behind him once more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, love.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJimin should hate the way Jeongguk sounds so sure, how he grounds him immediately. It shouldn\u2019t feel so easy and yet it does, and Jimin should be grateful for it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen are you gonna carry me to the bathhouse?\u201d Jimin asks instead, smiling when Jeongguk snorts from behind him. \u201cI feel gross.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to be carried, huh?\u201d Jeongguk says, tone playful. \u201cAre you that spoiled?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t I deserve to be spoiled after what you did to me?\u201d Jimin huffs, enjoying their easy banter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I recall, you seem to have enjoyed it quite a bit,\u201d Jeongguk retorts, their legs tangling together as Jeongguk draws him in close. Jimin\u2019s too tired to fight back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs it your ass that got fucked twice or mine?\u201d Jimin argues, eyes narrowing.\n\u00a0\nJeongguk laughs, nuzzling into Jimin\u2019s neck again. He realises he\u2019s being scented, even if it has no real effect on Jimin. Maybe Jeongguk found comfort in it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFair point,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you anywhere you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou better,\u201d Jimin says, doesn\u2019t have any of the bite he\u2019d intended as he melts into Jeongguk\u2019s touch. He\u2019s not ready to move just yet anyways. \u201cBut later. \u2019M tired.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, love.\u201d"
