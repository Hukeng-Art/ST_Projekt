    "text": "\n  Six days\n\nThe sea\u2019s eerie silence is unlike any silence found on land \u2014 it rings like a haunting. The Revenge, motionless as she is, struggles under the weight of the crew\u2019s misery. Her unfurled sails hang limply with no wind to billow them. The sun beats down on Ed\u2019s bare shoulders like a punishment where he hangs in the starboard rigging, taking swigs of rum and counting clouds on the horizon. Even he gave up his leather jacket days ago and his skin has become taut, freckled, in-part burned by the unrelenting god-sun above them.\u00a0\nEd has survived his fair share of becalmings. He has survived thirst, sunstroke, starvation, torture, scurvy, and his father. The thick, gnarled scar on the left side of his belly throbs with every breath. He has dodged death, and madness, and the whipping winds of an unforgiving sea.\u00a0\nStede Bonnet steps out onto the deck below him, dressed down to his breeches and an undershirt, and squints against the sun to smile brightly at Ed hanging in the rigging.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, Ed!\u201d he shouts, unwaveringly cheerful.\u00a0\n\u201cMorning, mate,\u201d says Ed, tips his bottle, and finds his gaze stuck on the tender, pale line of Stede\u2019s shoulder beneath the sheer white of his top.\u00a0\nEd has survived his fair share of becalmings. He has survived thirst, sunstroke, starvation, torture, scurvy, and his father. He isn't sure if he will survive Stede Bonnet.\u00a0\n***\u00a0\nDuring the first three days of their unfortunate standstill, Stede had kept the crew busy with games, stories and maintenance jobs. Never before had the deck of the Revenge sparkled as it did then. Never before had its crew heard so many stories. On the fourth day, Lucius nearly died of sunstroke and the mood took a tumble so severe not even Stede could hope to fix it.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re running low on fresh water. They were en route to Nassau for a restock when the wind stopped. Roach has taken to obsessively rationing what little rain water is left, checking the levels and reporting them to Stede like that is going to change anything. Stede, in turn, keeps Ed informed of the water levels, as though he expects him to be able to do something about it.\u00a0\nOn the third day, Stede swayed a little dangerously and said meekly that he felt dizzy from thirst, so now Ed threatens Roach to keep quiet as he tops up Stede\u2019s water ration from his own in the early hours of every day.\u00a0\n(\u201cYou\u2019ll die of thirst,\u201d Roach warns.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Ed says. He\u2019s built for this, Stede isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d)\u00a0\nSince day two, there has been an undercurrent of dumb panic in the way Stede moves, a trill of hysterics in his voice. He knows that he can\u2019t fix this with unrelenting goodwill. The wind will not respond to positive reinforcement and team-building exercises.\u00a0\nThis doesn\u2019t deter Stede from trying. Every deliriously hot morning he gets the crew together for a brainstorming session in the shade, trying to problem-solve his way out of a becalming.\u00a0\n\u201cWe could do a rain dance,\u201d Frenchie suggests on that sixth morning. It isn't the first time it has been suggested but Stede nods vigorously anyways.\u00a0\n\u201cBrilliant. That\u2019s great, Frenchie. Does anyone know any, er, rain dance routines?\u201d\u00a0\nEd drops his head back and looks at the mast, standing stark against a blinding sky.\u00a0\n\u201cIf it\u2019s no\u2019a full moon, don\u2019t bother,\u201d says Buttons. \u201cShe\u2019ll only smite us.\u201d Who  she  is, he doesn\u2019t say.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. The full moon is a fortnight away,\u201d Stede sighs, sounding miserable enough that Ed snaps his head over to check on him.\u00a0\nHe catches Stede\u2019s eye and gets a smile in return, a sad tug of the lips. Ed wants to drape fine cashmere around his shoulders and hide him from the sun. This man isn\u2019t made for thirst. This man should be drenched in clean water, his lips wet and pink, sweet coconut oil in his sun kissed hair.\u00a0\n\u201cNo bother,\u201d Stede says and claps his hands together, resolutely and forcefully upbeat. \u201cWe will organise a rain dance, with or without the moon. Gentlemen, I suggest you all come up with some elegant shimmies that will impress the gods. A rain dance extravaganza!\u201d\u00a0\nThe Swede yelps in excitement and jumps to his feet with more vigour than anyone on the crew has shown in days. Lucius, still sickly pale from his brief stint on the deathbed, rolls his eyes.\u00a0\n***\u00a0\n\u201cEd, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Stede all but collapses on the chaise lounge. It\u2019s hours past nightfall and the captain\u2019s quarters have cooled to a bearable temperature, though the air is still stuffy. They always find themselves back here, at the end of each sweltering day.\u00a0\n\u201cCan't do anything but wait,\u201d Ed says softly and sits down at an acceptable distance from Stede. \u201cThe wind will come back.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d There it is, the trill of hysterics. Stede casts a wild look at the lighthouse painting on his mantle. He twists the ring on his index finger, the skin across his knuckles taut and white. \u201cWhat if we die here? I can\u2019t fail them.\u201d\u00a0\n\"Hey.\" Ed reaches across because it's the only thing that feels right. He grasps Stede's wrist and smoothes the pad of his thumb across his knuckles. Stede stops fiddling with his ring and looks up at him, wide-eyed. \"This isn't Captain shit. This is God shit. Are you God?\"\u00a0\nThe room is blank with silence.\u00a0\nGently, Ed repeats, \"Are you God, Stede?\"\u00a0\nStede's voice is thin and high when he answers, \"I'm not God.\"\u00a0\n\"And is God here, in this room?\"\u00a0\nComically, Stede looks around like he might find God perched on the edge of his desk, or pulling books from his shelves to examine the spines.\u00a0\n\"He's not,\" Stede concedes.\u00a0\n\"That's right, mate. Stupid bugger doesn't associate himself with pirates.\" Ed smiles. \"But the whole world needs the wind. It needs storms and rainfall just as much as the fucking sun. People are always praying for it. So the wind will come, and there's nothing we can do but wait.\"\u00a0\nStede turns his hand over in Ed's grasp and for a moment they're holding onto each other, right here in this godless room, but then Stede lets go.\u00a0\n\"You're a good friend, Ed,\" says Stede. \"Thank you.\"\u00a0\nEd wants to howl.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n  Seven days  \n\nThat morning, early enough that the Revenge is still quiet with sleep, Ed looks up from polishing his pistol when the aft door opens and watches Stede step out onto the deck in just his breeches, his hair unkempt. No cravat, no flowing shirt, no buttons. No fucking buttons. He stares. Stede takes a deep lungful of breath and Ed is fixated on his chest, the fine dusting of hair, his collar bones, his nipples.\nThen Stede spots him and breaks out into a surprised smile, but seems to remember himself and self-consciously crosses his arms over his chest.\u00a0\n\"Ed! Hello! Er, what are you doing here? So early!\" He stutters through the words. \"I was just\u2014 Don't let me distract you from... whatever it is you are doing. I meant to\u2014\"\u00a0\nAnd before Ed can do anything but lift his hand to wave, Stede has rushed back under deck, leaving him and his pistol and his thoughts.\u00a0\nEd knows how to deal with lust, he really does. Decades spent at sea, you can't be shy about these things. You either bite the bullet and do something about it, or you drive yourself mad under all that sweat, that blood, and booze. He knows how to touch men. He knows how to fuck men and be fucked by them. But there is something about Stede Bonnet that reduces him to coveting awkward, quick touches, desperate for something but at once afraid of it. Because, he thinks privately, once he starts touching Stede he may never want to stop and that is a dangerous place to be.\u00a0\nThe metal of his pistol is cold and sleek where the bone of his wrist follows the rag he drags across it. In a few short hours, once the sun comes up above the waves, the air around him will be buzzing with heat again, and he will have to look Stede in the eye without his knees buckling.\u00a0\n\"Fuck off,\" he says to no one in particular, then gets to his feet. He should probably do something with the image of Stede's bare chest lingering on his tongue.\u00a0\n***\nWhen Stede nearly brains himself on the hull of the ship trying to step off the ladder and onto the dinghy, Ed reflexively reaches for him. He gets his arm around Stede's hip to steady him and instantly regrets it.\u00a0\n\"Careful, mate,\" he mutters while his body starves.\u00a0\nStede clings to Ed's arm until his feet are firmly in the dinghy. Only then does he untangle himself and put some distance between them.\u00a0\nEd squints at him, the sunlight high in his eyes.\u00a0\nPrimly, Stede says, \"Thank you.\" Always polite. Then he gives a thumbs up in the direction of Frenchie and Oluwande poking their head over the railing to make sure their captain doesn't drown.\u00a0\n\"Alright,\" says Ed and pushes off the hull of the ship. Their dinghy rocks gently away from The Revenge. He picks up the harpoon propped up against the side of the boat, tied to the bench with a rope. \"Let's catch some sharks.\"\n\"Sharks?\" Stede squeaks. \"But you said fish!\"\u00a0\n\"Sharks are fish.\" He hoists the harpoon up on his shoulder. \"C'mon, man, start rowing.\"\u00a0\n\"Oh God.\"\u00a0\nStede sits down on the bench and does as he's told while Ed watches for movement below the water's surface.\u00a0\n\"Have you ever caught a shark before?\" Stede asks eventually, sounding uncertain.\u00a0\n\"Yep,\" Ed nods. \"Plenty.\"\u00a0\n\"So... what's the proper technique?\"\u00a0\n\"You stab 'em.\"\u00a0\n\"With the harpoon.\"\u00a0\n\"No, with a fucking pencil.\"\u00a0\nStede actually laughs. Ed's stomach does a funny little flip. He is lightheaded \u2014 from thirst and from heat. Perhaps from Stede fucking Bonnet.\u00a0\n\"Now that would be quite something,\" Stede says, amused.\u00a0\n\"Quite something,\" Ed hums. \"Okay, stop here.\"\u00a0\nStede stops rowing and Ed stomps the heel of his boot on the floor. Stede makes a sound like someone dying.\u00a0\n\"The trick is to get it in the brain,\" Ed tells him. \"Otherwise it'll swim on and drag us with it.\"\u00a0\nHe looks back at Stede and finds him grimacing.\u00a0\n\"Sounds... dangerous.\"\u00a0\n\"For the shark, yeah.\"\u00a0\n\"And for us.\"\u00a0\n\"Thought you wanted to be a better pirate. Hunting sharks is part of the advanced level pirate diploma.\"\u00a0\n\"Oh, is it?\" Stede's voice is faint. \"Well then. I'll watch and learn.\"\u00a0\nEd stomps his heel again. This time something bumps back. Stede squeaks.\u00a0\n\"Ed, are you sure this is\u2014 I mean, we still have some rations, maybe we don't need to, er, do this\u2014 We can just\u2014\"\u00a0\n\"Shh.\" Ed puts one finger to his lips and tightens his grip on the harpoon. \"I'll take care of it.\"\u00a0\n\"Okay,\" Stede says softly.\u00a0\nThe dinghy rocks with the gentle ghost of a predator below. Ed, the predator above, leans forward on the tips of his toes and looks over the edge. The water is clear enough that he can see the grey body of his prey. An easy target. Should be.\u00a0\nHe waits for the shark to cross below the boat, and then he shouts and throws the harpoon with all the strength he can muster. He misses, but narrowly.\u00a0\n\"Did you get it?\" Stede gasps and jumps up from his place on the bench.\u00a0\n\"Fuck!\" Ed pulls the rope to get the harpoon back. \"Missed.\"\u00a0\n\"Ah, that's a shame. I guess we'll have to go back to the ship, you know, to regroup and strategise.\"\u00a0\nEd drops the harpoon and it clatters to the floor. It's too fucking hot. The sun beats down on him like hellfire and he so desperately wants to jump into the water. Never mind the sharks, it would be a kinder death than being burned alive.\u00a0\nHe casts a look over his shoulder at Stede, who gives him one of those sweet little smiles, that lips-pressed-together, eyes-wide smile that makes Ed believe he could be a better person.\u00a0\n\"Alright, hold on,\" he grunts. \"'m trying again.\"\u00a0\nHe grasps the hem of his t-shirt and pulls it over his head. Too fucking warm. He crumples it up and drops it. Then he picks the harpoon back up, readies it, and steadies one knee on the edge of the boat.\u00a0\n\"Er,\" Stede says behind him, sounding choked. \"Okay.\"\u00a0\nThe shark circles below them, not spooked by Ed's previous attempt on its life. Sweat pools in the dips of Ed's collarbones. He waits. He waits.\u00a0\nHe stops.\u00a0\n\u201cStede,\u201d he says. \u201cCome here. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh, oh. I\u2019ll only be in your way, really. And what if we have to start rowing away quickly? It\u2019s probably best if I sit here and\u2026 observe.\u201d\u00a0\nEd turns to look at him, unimpressed. Stede is wide-eyed and staring at, must be, Ed\u2019s chest. It\u2019s intensely gratifying.\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mon, mate. I need your help.\u201d\u00a0\nStede gets up. The boat wobbles dangerously. Ed widens his stance to balance the weight.\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Ed says and hands him the harpoon.\u00a0\n\u201cChrist.\u201d Stede takes it in both hands, hesitant like it\u2019s about to explode in his face. \u201cAnd what do I do with it?\u201d\u00a0\nEd takes Stede by the shoulders and guides him to the edge of the boat. His palms are flat against Stede\u2019s shoulder blades. He stands behind him \u2014 only a few inches and his chest would be pressed against Stede's back.\u00a0\n\u201cHold it up like so,\u201d he instructs and nudges Stede\u2019s elbow into a more natural position. \u201cYou have to be able to aim. Can\u2019t do that with your elbow locked.\u201d\u00a0\nStede exhales shakily. Says, \u201cMhm,\u201d and grips the harpoon like his life depends on it, white-knuckled and trembling.\u00a0\n\u201cLook down,\u201d Ed murmurs, and Stede does.\u00a0\n\u201cOh God,\u201d he gasps. \u201cThat\u2019s a shark.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt is, yeah. But this guy\u2019s just a fish. You\u2019ve got thumbs and a harpoon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI do have thumbs,\u201d Stede concedes. \u201cTake that, sharks!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd a harpoon. So use it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow? I\u2019m a terrible thrower.\u201d\u00a0\nEd circles Stede with his arms and grasps his wrists lightly. It\u2019s really too warm for fucking flirting. His head throbs, blood beating in his temples. But then Stede relaxes into him a fraction and Ed just wants to be  closer.\u00a0 \nHe shows Stede the motion. Draws his hands back, the harpoon with it.\u00a0\n\u201cAim the tip,\u201d he says. \u201cHit the brain. C\u2019mon, now. Shark\u2019s gonna get out of here before you get your act together. Be a pirate, man.\u201d\u00a0\nHe lets go of Stede\u2019s wrists and takes a reluctant step back.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is really very\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nThen Stede pulls his arm back and launches the harpoon. It whips through the air and embeds itself in the flesh of the beast. The head, as he wanted.\u00a0\n\u201cExciting,\u201d Stede finishes.\u00a0\nEd whoops triumphantly and jumps into action, grabbing the rope and pulling it taut. The shark flops uselessly in the water, struggling, but does not have enough momentum to move away.\u00a0\n\"Fuckin\u2019 hero,\u201d Ed shouts. \u201cHelp me get this thing on board.\u201d\u00a0\nTogether they yank and hook the shark, pulling it over the edge and into the dinghy. It struggles wildly until Ed gets his dagger in it.\u00a0\nOnly then does Stede look up from the beast to look at Ed. Still wide-eyed and surprised, but there is something burning there, too.\u00a0\nWhen Ed smiles at him wildly, Stede laughs.\u00a0\n\u201cThe crew are going to love you,\u201d Ed says.\u00a0\n\u201cUs, you mean.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Us.\u201d\u00a0\n***\nThe crew does love them for it. Roach cooks the shark meat perfectly and distributes it evenly amongst the crew that night.\nThey sit and eat. The world seems more bearable with the sun down. Across the lantern light in between them, Ed looks at Stede. His face is touched gold by the flickering fire.\u00a0\nWhen he sees him looking, Stede smiles and raises his shark skewer in a half-joking greeting. Ed ducks his head, unsure of what to do with himself.\u00a0\n Dear fucking God, man. He can\u2019t go on like this.\u00a0\n***\u00a0\n\"Are you serious?\"\u00a0\nLucius stares at him, his mouth agape.\u00a0\n\"Yes, I'm fucking serious, do I look like I'm joking? Do I look like a clown?\"\u00a0\nThey're in the storage cupboard. Somewhere above them, Frenchie and the Swede sing shanties, out of tune but dedicated.\u00a0\n\"Have you tried to make a move at all?\" Lucius' expression is pinched. \"Anything? Surely you have moves.\"\nEd looks at him, unhappy. \"Tried taking my shirt off in front of him.\"\nLucius sounds genuinely surprised when he asks, \"And that didn't work?\"\n\"The shark might have ruined the mood.\"\u00a0\n\"You made a move on him while trying to hunt for  sharks?\"\u00a0\nEd raises his eyebrows at his tone.\u00a0\n\"You two deserve each other.\"\u00a0\n\"Fuck off,\" Ed snaps, secretly glowing with it. \"I wouldn't ask if I had any other options.\"\n\"I think you have plenty of options,\" Lucius says, waggles his eyebrows, and Ed thinks that if he had enough hair he would be twirling it. \"But I'll see what I can do.\"\u00a0\n\"You don't have to do anything,\" Ed snaps. \"I don't want you to do anything. I want you to tell me what to do. I just need a nudge.\"\u00a0\n\"Nope,\" Lucius flutters his hand across Ed's shoulder like he is brushing imaginary dirt off his jacket. \"You'll only fuck it up.\"\u00a0\nEd glowers at him. \"Pushing it, boy.\"\u00a0\nLucius is still scared of him, he knows, but right now his love for shenanigans seems to outweigh any fear that may be lodged in his throat.\u00a0\n\"I know I am,\" says Lucius. \"But I think Stede would be very disappointed if you stabbed me.\"\u00a0\nAnd with that he does a mocking bow and exits the storage cupboard, leaving Ed inhaling dust all alone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n  Eight days  \n\nThe thirst starts to get to Ed in the early afternoon. He crouches in the belly of the ship, away from the sun, and peers into his flask of carefully rationed water. There cannot be more than a few sips left. He knows, religiously, that if he went to Roach for more the man would give it to him, knows the way that people always relent to him \u2014 out of fear, or respect, or duty. It's precisely for that reason that he will not go to Roach.\u00a0\nWhen he rises to full height he feels briefly lightheaded. His stomach roils. He steadies himself on a barrel and blinks away the fatigue.\u00a0\nThings to do. Men to seduce.\u00a0\n***\u00a0\n\"Captain wants you,\" Lucius drawls, his head popping up from below deck.\u00a0\nEd's heart skips a beat and he pushes himself up on his elbows. They're lounging in the shadow of the main sail \u2014 Ed, Oluwande, Frenchie and Wee John. Ed had been here first and the others had sort of... congregated around him. He can\u2019t quite place how that makes him feel.\u00a0\nLucius' shit-eating grin is enough to beat the flustered excitement out of him.\u00a0\n\"Where?\" Ed grunts, unhappy.\u00a0\n\"His bathroom,\" Lucius says and disappears again.\u00a0\nEd's cheeks burn. Besides him, Oluwande looks at him like he has just realised something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe follows the corridor down to the captain's quarters, his nerves twinging with each step. He has been in Stede's bathroom before. Hell, he has cried in Stede's bathroom. But why would he be wanted there?\u00a0\nFeeling like his skin is too tight, Ed stops outside the door. He raises his fist, hesitates, then raps his knuckles against the elegant wood three times.\u00a0\n\u201cAh,\u201d Stede\u2019s voice comes muffled from inside. \u201cExcellent! Come in!\u201d\u00a0\nEd opens the door and its hinges squeak loudly. Stede is facing away from him, shirtless, and has his head bent over a bowl of some sorts.\u00a0\n\u201cUh, hello?\u201d Ed says, uncertain. He takes a few steps into the room but doesn\u2019t come too close. From here he can see the ridges of Stede\u2019s spine below taut, freckled skin. Ed clenches his fists by his side.\u00a0\n\u201cEr,\u201d Stede says, head still bent. \u201cEd?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\u00a0\nStede turns his head slowly and Ed can see his hair is dripping wet. Water splashes across the floor.\u00a0\n\u201cAlways happy to see you, of course, but what are you doing here? Where\u2019s Lucius?\u201d\u00a0\nEd blinks in surprise. \u201cLucius\u2014 What? He told me\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nThe door slams shut behind him with a sudden bang. A metallic sound, like a key being turned in the lock. Ed whips around and tries the handle. The door doesn\u2019t budge.\u00a0\nHe rattles the handle and shouts, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\u00a0\nOn the other side of the door, Lucius shouts back, a tinge of hysterics to his voice, \u201cThis is your nudge! You can kill me later!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man, that\u2019s fucked up!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! But it\u2019ll work! Sorry, bye!\u201d Retreating footsteps, then a final door shutting.\u00a0\nBehind him, Stede says, \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have a, uh, towel?\u201d\u00a0\nEd turns to him slowly, resigned to his terrible, sweet fate of being stuck in a room with a shirtless Stede Bonnet.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he replies. \u201cSorry, mate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s just\u2014 Fab. I asked Lucius to fetch one for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe fetched me instead.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI did think he took an awfully long time. Any idea why? What\u2019s the\u2026 nudge?\u201d\u00a0\nEd leans against the door, as far away from Stede as he possibly can be in the small room.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid joke. We\u2019re playing\u2014\u00a0 It\u2019s like a game? Where we do stupid shit.\u201d It feels like digging his own grave. \u201cHe\u2019s being an idiot. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf by talking you mean threatening him, please don\u2019t. He nearly died just a few days ago. We run a gentle ship here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sure, man. I\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\u00a0\nFor a moment, they stand in silence, Ed against the door and Stede with his head bent over the bowl. It becomes too much too quickly.\u00a0\n\u201cSo what the fuck are you doing?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m washing my hair.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 I\u2019m not using fresh water. I wouldn\u2019t use fresh water right now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStede, I know,\u201d Ed says quickly. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRight, yes, I didn\u2019t want you to think\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, mate, I wouldn\u2019t think that.\u201d\u00a0\nStede sighs. He squeezes his blond waves to wring the water out furtively.\u00a0 \u201cI really need a towel.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou can use my shirt?\u201d\u00a0\nThat has to be the lamest come-on in the history of piracy. Thinly-veiled, moronic, there is no way Stede will think he\u2014\u00a0\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026! That\u2019s so very nice of you, but I wouldn\u2019t want to rob you of your clothes!\u201d\u00a0\nEd blinks. He expected to be called out on it, not to be taken at face-value.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue,\u201d he says, utterly fond. \u201cIt\u2019ll dry.\u201d\u00a0\nStede chuckles, a nervous edge to it. \u201cEd, really.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cC\u2019mon, mate.\u201d Without any more fuss, he takes off his shirt. He looks down at the purple fabric, then at Stede\u2019s naked back. \u201cIt\u2019ll dry, won\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\nHe crosses the room in a few short strides and holds out the shirt to Stede, nudging his shoulder. Stede turns his head, face red from being upside down, his hair dripping and dark with water.\u00a0\n\u201cHah, um,\u201d Stede squeaks. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0\nHe reaches out to take the shirt and Ed watches as he expertly wraps it around his head in a little turban-like situation. It\u2019s so overwhelmingly charming that it knocks the breath out of Ed\u2019s lungs.\u00a0\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d he says, strained.\u00a0\nStede straightens up and there it is again, that thin-lipped, wide-eyed smile. With his hair wrapped up, he looks even more naked than before.\u00a0\nEd takes a step back out of some long buried self-preservation instinct. He is suddenly and acutely aware of the fact that they are both shirtless and locked in a bathroom. Stede seems to be going through a similar process, and his sweet smile grows increasingly tight.\u00a0\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this game you\u2019re playing with Lucius then?\u201d Stede asks and begins massaging his scalp through Ed\u2019s t-shirt, which has turned dark with water.\u00a0\n\u201cUm, nothing, it\u2019s\u2026 Stupid, you wouldn\u2019t want to be involved.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, come on, I love stupid games. What are the rules?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo rules, just\u2026 It\u2019s not even really a game, if you break it down,\u201d Ed stammers and takes another nervous step backwards. He looks around for something to occupy him. Anything. He settles on a pot of what seems to be some kind of fancy-schmancy bathroom product, which he picks up and unscrews. He sticks his nose in it and it smells of rosemary and bergamot.\u00a0\n\u201cHow does locking you in a bathroom come into it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s about\u2026 mental perseverance. And, um, problem solving.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOoh, I love that. Sounds challenging.\u201d He pauses. \u201cSo how do you get him to unlock the door? Is there a trick?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMight have to break the door down,\u201d Ed says and sets the rosemary and bergamot thing back down on the side. He picks up a bottle, some sort of oil. Sniffs it. Coconut and something citrus-adjacent.\u00a0\nStede says, \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t,\u201d and Ed immediately puts the oil down and looks at him, uncertain.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, you can have the oil, I meant the door. I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t break down my door. I\u2019m quite fond of it. Surely there\u2019s another way to win this game?\u201d While he speaks, Stede unwraps his make-shift headpiece and folds the damp t-shirt neatly. He hangs it over the edge of the bathtub. \u201cCould you pass me that oil, please?\u201d\u00a0\nEd hands it to him. He watches him pour some into his cupped hand, then spread it evenly by rubbing his palms together.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that for your hair?\u201d he asks, captivated.\u00a0\n\u201cMhm, yes.\u201d Stede looks over at him with a slight smile and begins running his hands through his hair. He combs his fingers through the damp strands carefully, methodically, like he does this all the time. And he must, for his hair to be so shiny and coiffed no matter the situation.\n\u201cSmells nice,\u201d Ed says, without meaning to. \u201cThe oil. And you, usually.\u201d\u00a0\nStede scrunches up his nose in embarrassment. \u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2014 That\u2019s nice to hear. You smell good, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that,\u201d Ed says, amused. He knows he smells like stale sweat and old leather and sea salt. Sometimes, these days, he smells like Stede\u2019s lavender soap but that never lasts more than a few hours.\u00a0\nStede\u2019s hands come away from his hair shiny with oil. Ed wishes he would run them through his beard, so he can breathe in the scent, feel Stede\u2019s fingers on his jaw.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not just being polite, you smell nice!\u201d he insists.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t bathe enough to smell nice,\u201d Ed says and sits down on the edge of the dresser holding Stede\u2019s fancy oils and creams. \u201cYou bathe an appropriate amount.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to the tub any time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\u00a0\nStede turns to rinse the oil off his hands in his little bowl of soapy water. With his back turned he says, \u201cYes, of course. Anytime.\u201d\u00a0\nEd hums. \u201cMaybe I will, when we\u2019re back in the wind.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou should. I\u2019ll ask Roach to boil water for you. Nothing like a hot bath on a stormy day.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCan\u2019t imagine anything worse than a hot bath right now.\u201d\u00a0\nStede laughs, \u201cIt\u2019s stupidly warm, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ed sighs, empathetic. \u201cThought I might die of thirst earlier.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Ed, you should have said. I can spare some of my water,\u201d Stede says and he sounds genuinely concerned. He turns to look at him and wipes his wet hands on his breeches, which Ed thinks is positively obscene of him. \u201cAre you okay? Are you feeling well?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he chokes. He digs his nails into the wood of the dresser. \u201cI\u2019m good. Keep your water.\u201d  Keep mine too. \nStede looks at him intently and Ed lets himself look back. They are both perfectly still.\u00a0\nFinally, Stede says, \u201cTell me about this game.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCan\u2019t be worse than letting Calico Jack whip your\u2026\u201d He nearly chokes on it. \u201cPrivates.\u201d\u00a0\nEd has to laugh. \u201cHm, yeah, it\u2019s not that stupid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are the rules?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe rules are,\u201d Ed starts. \u201cLucius locks us in a room until I come on to you. If I don\u2019t, I lose.\u201d\u00a0\nHe watches Stede\u2019s throat work as he swallows. Wants to put his mouth all over him. Wants to do a lot of things, most of them filthy.\nStede\u2019s voice is high-pitched when he asks, \u201cAnd what if you do?\u201d\u00a0\nEd\u2019s blood pounds in his ears. \u201cThen I get to come on to you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you win?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDepends.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOn what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow you feel about me coming on to you.\u201d\u00a0\nStede clasps his hands in front of his body like a nervous schoolboy. \u201cAh,\u201d he says. \u201cI reckon I would, er, feel quite good about that, perhaps. If you were to\u2026 do\u2026 that. What you said you might do. For the game.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou would?\u201d Ed can feel his heartbeat at the back of his throat.\u00a0\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Stede hums and he never once looks away, even when Ed takes a step forward, even when Ed reaches out to graze his fingertips along his collarbone.\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to do this. He doesn\u2019t know how to be tender and touch softly, but by God does he want to. He fucking wants to. He wants to hold Stede\u2019s heart in the palm of his hand, the same way Stede folded his and tucked it into his breast pocket with all the gentleness of a lover.\u00a0\nEd is wobbly on his feet. He feels both hot and cold at the same time, his body flush with it. It\u2019s hard to tell the difference between love and dehydration.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess I win, then,\u201d he says and cups Stede\u2019s jaw with a trembling hand. Stede tilts his head, leaning into the touch.\u00a0\nWhen he kisses Stede, it appears to him the most important thing that he has ever done. Stede\u2019s lips are dry and chapped, days of sun-damage that not even his lovely creams can fix, and neither of them quite know what to do with their hands, or their mouths, or their breath. Ed finally settles on threading his fingers through Stede\u2019s lovely, damp hair at the back of his head.\u00a0\nStede gasps against his mouth and puts enough distance between them to stutter, \u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2014 That\u2019s very nice, Ed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Ed murmurs and his throat is dry as sandpaper.\u00a0\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Stede confirms and then presses himself back into Ed feverishly.\u00a0\nEd pushes, as gently as he can, and walks him backwards until Stede bumps against the bathtub and his knees buckle. He comes to sit there, on the edge of the tub, and his thighs splay open like the world\u2019s sweetest invitation.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Ed whispers and settles in the space between them.\u00a0\nLike this, Stede has to tilt his head back to kiss him, and Ed wraps an arm around his shoulder to keep him upright. He feels, suddenly, like a predator looming over his prey and his chest burns with shame. Too much. He doesn\u2019t want to be  dangerous. He wants to be sweet, and gentle, and to press his lips into Stede\u2019s warm skin. His head spins with nausea.\u00a0\nBreathless, he sinks down to his knees between Stede\u2019s lovely thighs.\u00a0\n\u201cEd?\u201d Stede asks, his face still only inches away. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m\u2014 I just feel\u2014\u201d He can\u2019t actually say it, no way. He can\u2019t say that he feels monstrous, kissing Stede, because then surely the man will never let him do it again. Instead, he leans forward and presses his face into Stede\u2019s bare chest, breathes in the clean-lavender smell of him. He noses upwards to his collarbones, the dip of his throat, presses open-mouthed kisses to the warm skin there, and feels Stede\u2019s pulse jumping below it. The nausea fades into the background.\u00a0\n\u201cOh gosh, um.\u201d One of Stede\u2019s hands comes to grip Ed\u2019s sunburnt shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s something, Ed, really.\u201d Nonsensical.\u00a0\nEd hums. He wants to taste Stede, to rumple him. Always so put-together, Stede Bonnet. What a mess he could make of him. Make him feel good, make him gasp and whine and say shit like \u2018oh good heavens!\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re a good person, Ed, I trust you\u2019 or maybe \u2018fuck\u2019.\u00a0\nHe licks a line from Stede\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple to his jaw and the noise he makes is almost too good to be true.\u00a0\n\u201cEd, is there anything, um, can I do anything?\u201d Stede stumbles through the question, then rephrases it: \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cShh,\u201d Ed murmurs and slides his hands down from Stede\u2019s arms to grip his lean thighs instead, finding the fine fabric of his breeches deliriously hot. He squeezes reassuringly, but Stede\u2019s responding gasp tells him maybe it wasn\u2019t quite as reassuring as he hoped. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. You\u2019re fine.\u201d\u00a0\nInstead of waiting for an answer, Ed kisses him again. More desperate this time, wanting, and Stede makes a choked little sound as he parts his lips and lets Ed nudge his tongue against his.\u00a0\nEd has fucked, and been fucked, and bound, and been bound, tried anything under the fucking sun, and yet licking into Stede Bonnet\u2019s mouth feels like the most obscene thing he has ever done.\u00a0\nHe trails one hand over Stede\u2019s stomach, committing its shape to memory, and he wants so desperately to get his mouth on him that he trembles with it. He wants, he wants, he wants\u2014\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d Lucius shouts through the door and Stede jerks backwards so quickly he nearly falls into the tub. \u201cEd, did you feel nudged?\u201d\u00a0\nEd sinks back on his heels and looks up at Stede, who is looking at the door.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you guys alive in there?\u201d The sound of the key being turned in the lock. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, thank you!\u201d Stede shouts, panicked. \u201cWe\u2019re fine!\u201d\u00a0\nA moment of silence from the other side. Then, \u201cJust fine?\u201d\nEd slumps forward to rest his forehead on Stede\u2019s knee. The nausea is back in full force, and his mouth feels like cotton. Days of too much sun, not enough water, and thrumming with anxiety, it all crashes over his head.\u00a0\n\u201cJust fuck off,\u201d he manages, in the general direction of the door.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lucius sing-songs and his footsteps retreat.\u00a0\n\u201cEd?\u201d Stede asks above him and runs a gentle hand through his hair. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHmfp,\u201d Ed grunts. His head swims. White spots dance behind his eyelids. \u201cThink I might pass out.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd he does.\u00a0\n***\u00a0\nHe comes to in Stede's bed, a cold rag on his forehead and his lips cracked and sore. The first thing he notices is that the light filtering through the blinds seems awfully dim. The second thing he notices is the sound of rain, distant but hopeful.\u00a0\n\u201cStede?\u201d he croaks, and blinks up at the ceiling.\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Stede says, voice close.\u00a0\nEd turns his head and finds him sitting beside the bed, a book in his lap and his hair in sweet disarray.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that rain?\u201d\u00a0\nStede smiles tightly. \u201cIt is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ed whispers. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re a moron,\u201d is the next thing Stede says, a little unexpected.\u00a0\n\u201cI am?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cRoach said that you gave me your water.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d he breathes and his chest rattles. \u201cThat.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhat were you thinking? You made yourself sick.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you were thirsty,\u201d says Ed, plain and simple.\u00a0\nStede leans forward and frowns at him. \u201cWe were all thirsty.\u201d\u00a0\nTruth be told, Ed wants to go back to sleep. His bones ache and he feels both too hot and too cold at once.\u00a0\nHe says, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter about anyone else,\u201d and closes his eyes.\u00a0\nFor a moment all he can hear is the sound of the rain and his own breath as it comes in shallow bursts.\n\"Ed.\" Stede's voice has a strange quality to it, like anger.\u00a0\nEd opens his eyes then, and Stede's face is much closer than expected.\u00a0\n\"Hm?\"\u00a0\n\"Don't do that again. I'd prefer it if you looked after yourself, too.\"\u00a0\n\"C'mon, mate. I'm fine.\"\nStede cups the side of Ed's face with his palm.\u00a0\n\"Stay awake,\" he says. \"I'll get you something to eat.\"\nThen Stede leans down and kisses him, just a gentle press of lips, and Ed thinks he must be in love."
