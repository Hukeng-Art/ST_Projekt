    "summary": "<p>Batman is insulted during a Justice League mission, which wouldn't be a problem except Nightwing is there to hear it. The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them. Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important.</p>\n<p>Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings. Good thing his father taught him a few things about the importance of detailed plans and talented allies.</p>\n<p>The prank war starts with petty theft, purple, and cows.</p>\n<p>Possible ghost kitties, a cow, a cactus, and several Bats invade the Tower. There are a few realizations had but the Bats still aren't found.</p>\n<p>Bruce returns to the Watchtower is not surprised by what he finds. The Justice League has questions and actually gets some answers. The Batfamily definitely wins the war though.</p>",

This story has a couple family feels moments (I can't help myself)) but mainly focuses on BAMF Batfamily pranking the League.

    "text": "Bruce was tired.\u00a0\nHe was tired, sore, and actually rather itchy despite the blissfully warm containment shower he had taken upon their return to the Watchtower. The mission hadn\u2019t been difficult, exactly, but his regular human skin had not fared quite as well against the magical sparking vat of orange liquid as that of his alien and god teammates. The Batsuit could only do much.\u00a0\nNightwing, thankfully, had been in a different part of the building and hadn\u2019t been exposed to the liquid at all. His suit had significantly less protection than the Batsuit to allow for his acrobatics and Bruce worried.\u00a0\nHis son also had more common sense than most of the other heroes at this table, at least from what they\u2019d shown on this recent mission to stop a mad scientist holed up with significant ray gun technology and an entire brainwashed town. The League had rescued the town and the scientist was currently in the hands of the proper authorities, so the mission was hardly a disaster.\u00a0\nIt was also hardly a success.\nUnfortunately, the whole team knew this and were attempting to debrief. Bruce had tried to share what he considered the top three issues and had been simply talked over, which wasn\u2019t a usual problem. Batman was generally listened to when he spoke. Part of that reason, however, was the fact that Batman choose his moment to speak carefully and Bruce could recognize that this wasn\u2019t a good moment. Everyone was too overly energetic and there wasn\u2019t an incoming threat or mission to use as a focus.\nBesides, it would hardly do his reputation good to be talked over again.\nNightwing was providing a more enjoyable alternative than attempting to corral the masses with his scathing commentary over various hand signals and slight facial expressions. Bruce would be insulted by some of Dick\u2019s comparisons of the Justice League to the Titans (and on at least two occasions Damian\u2019s dog, Titus), except at this moment Bruce rather agreed with him.\u00a0\nHe wondered how much longer until Dick faked a Titans\u2019s emergency and ducked out of the meeting, since the ability to prioritize his own team had been one of the agreements struck when Flash had recruited Nightwing. The Justice League had been more than willing to accept a few conditions for a hero of Nightwing\u2019s reputation, not to mention the several Titans that even Hal could tell only joined to support their leader.\nBruce had been so proud the day Nightwing had been sworn in, Cyborg and Raven flanking him for the entire ceremony. It was perhaps a bit bittersweet, since Bruce knew the moment signalled the end of almost all his arguments for keeping his kids a secret. Oh, the Justice League knew there were additional vigilantes in Gotham but the secretive nature of the Bats and Gotham itself had allowed Bruce to keep information to a minimum with a few judiciously applied glares.\u00a0\nBruce understood Gotham and, while he knew and completely believed in the importance of the Justice League, it was easier to keep his children safe in Gotham. To believe they were safer outside of their city when they couldn\u2019t be linked back to Batman and used against each other. When not even the heroes knew that any of his children had an entire support network that was completely unseen and only a call away.\u00a0\nBut he trusted the Justice League now, today\u2019s mess notwithstanding, and his children knew it. Knew that Bruce would never have let Dick join (have backed his joining in full view and support of Flash\u2019s nomination) if the League wasn\u2019t trustworthy. His children were humouring Bruce, now, and only because they could see that Bruce himself knew the time was approaching to reveal their secret identities to their friends.\u00a0\nBesides, the no civilian names thing had been leveraged with impressive cohesion and teamwork to get Bruce to relax almost every other rule that wasn\u2019t directly related to safety. Tim and Damian, of all partnerships, had been directing their siblings in what to ask and when, casually pulling the \u2018since we can\u2019t reveal our names, can we at least\u2026\u2019 card with brutal efficiency.\u00a0\nThere had been two parties in the Batcave, holiday costumes for the last year, and nine separate team-ups with some of the greyer villains. Not to mention the Gopher Incident and the mini-golf debacle. Dick had stood on the manor grounds after that one, lazily twirling a putter he\u2019d picked up after walking into the mess side by side with Bruce (after saving him from a four hour Board Meeting) and said that Bruce now folded as reliably as a bat sought the dark.\u00a0\nAlfred had actually agreed. Aloud.\u00a0\nBruce sighed. He\u2019d fold soon enough on the names, too. His kids were good and strong and together. They could handle themselves and he\u2019d just have to handle the worry.\u00a0\nThough not just yet. This nonsense could fuel his arguments for anonymity for at least another two to three weeks. None of his children had the patience for this kind of mess, except maybe Jason who\u2019d like to incite the chaos to greater heights. Or Steph who\u2019d throw food at the heroes while heckling them the entire time. Or Tim who\u2019d record everything for blackmail.\u00a0\nMaybe he\u2019d better not mention it after all.\u00a0\nBruce refocused briefly when he heard his name again, someone trying to point out flaws in his performance that didn\u2019t exist. He knew he had flaws, he knew he made mistakes (his children loved to point them out, at length and at volume), but Bruce had followed the plan.\u00a0\nHal was the one who uttered the death blow, which certainly wasn\u2019t a surprise. Nor was the way he blithely continued on as if he hadn\u2019t doomed them all.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, I just don\u2019t see why we need to take advice on teamwork from a man who dresses up as a Bat and \u2018Works Alone.\u2019 Not that anyone besides us would put up with you, so I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d get much practice.\u201d\nBruce blinked, slowly, and used his considerable training to refrain from pinching the bridge of his nose. He ignored both Diana and Clark arguing against Hal, which was rather sweet of them, to stare at his oldest son.\u00a0\nDick had gone still in a way that very few ever pegged as dangerous. Bruce, however, had been convinced by a tiny child on completely calm feet that having a colourful acrobat tailing his shadow across dreary, crime-filled rooftops was a good idea. Bruce understood that a still Nightwing meant he was utterly focused and it was time resort to evasive manoeuvres.\u00a0\nThe rest of Bruce\u2019s children had taken longer to make that connection, what with Dick intentionally hiding behind a smile and a laugh and his role of big brother. Sometimes Bruce hated how much he\u2019d let fall onto Dick shoulders, but then Dick would show up with pizza and movies and always always end those evenings with a hug and a whispered thank you in Bruce\u2019s ear.\u00a0\nThey\u2019d caught on though. Barbara first (she\u2019d always been Dick\u2019s confidant) and then Cass and Jason and all the others. These days a quiet Nightwing spread ripples of concern through the entire Gotham rotation as they tensed with uneasiness and prepared for complete mobilization because their Big Bird was going nowhere alone.\u00a0\nThe Justice League could perhaps be excused for not recognizing the danger in the iron-straight spine of their newest recruit. They hadn\u2019t had near enough exposure to the cheery hero to see beyond the smiles. Though Barry was eyeing the man he\u2019d sponsored with a caution that Bruce was honestly surprised and bit impressed to see.\u00a0\nDick began typing into the tablet he\u2019d had in front of him, ostensibly for playback and mission reports. Bruce glanced at his own screen, which stayed blank for for longer than he thought it should have before the message appeared.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Nothing Agent A won\u2019t approve, promise.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce leaned back, getting the attention of a concerned looking Clark which Bruce summarily ignored.\nBruce thought about his butler. He thought about how Alfred\u2019s eyes always darkened when any of his family was insulted. He thought about how the man had been sending Bruce disappointed looks for months now as he put off introducing the League to his children.\u00a0\nHe thought about his children. He thought about how his children had come together and settled over this last year under his guidance and Dick\u2019s care and their own choices to become a more solid family than he could have ever dreamed. A family that could and would protect each other.\u00a0\nHe thought about the Justice League and how Bruce\u2019s children didn\u2019t always listen to him but would have known better to poke a fucking button next to a vat of unidentified liquid in the middle of a villain\u2019s lair.\u00a0\nBruce stood, cape flaring out and gaining the attention of everyone in the room almost instantly.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going on vacation,\u201d Bruce said. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen his teammates look so flabbergasted or Dick so proud. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll learn something about teamwork while away.\u201d\nHe certainly would, since he planned on burying himself in his competent children. Though maybe he\u2019d take a bit of time off with Selina somewhere warm and see if he could sneak back as many jewels as she stole.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me for two weeks,\u201d Bruce continued as if one of the silent Justice League members had said anything at all. Dick\u2019s nose wrinkled and Bruce sighed. \u201cMake that four. Try not to burn anything to the ground while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nHal started sputtering indignantly, but Bruce hadn\u2019t been talking to him.\u00a0\nDick only smirked, which wasn\u2019t an agreement. Bruce paused a moment, but decided it wan\u2019t his problem and left with what might have passed as a wink to Diana and Clark. They had tried to defend him after all, so maybe deserved a little bit of warning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWe are the Night\n\n\u00a0\nDick: We\u2019re going to war with the Justice League.\n\u00a0\nJason: Fuck yes.\nJason: I\u2019ll bring the explosives.\n\u00a0\nTim: Which contingency?\u00a0\nTim: I\u2019m prepared for Plans B, K, and L through AX.\nTim: Though need appropriate time to unlock the relevant bunkers for the 63-2 series.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCass: I like Plan Q.\n\u00a0\nTim: Plan Q is easier now that Ivy\u2019s with the Sirens.\nTim: She\u2019d totally get us enough plants if Selina asks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian: I could also get us the required botany.\n\u00a0\nTim: Right.\nTim: I forgot the Sirens think your savageness is adorable.\n\u00a0\nDamian: They have good taste, unlike some I could mention.\nDamian: Though I would prefer to use my katana.\u00a0\nDamian: It is a more appropriate response for the Caped Cretins finally having proven themselves insufficient to be Father\u2019s allies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuke: Okay, so that\u2019s a decent point.\u00a0\nDuke: If.\nDuke: As the only one with common sense\n\u00a0\nJason: Rude.\n\u00a0\nCass: Honest.\n\u00a0\nSteph: Accurate.\nSteph: And Plan AG is my favourite.\u00a0\nSteph: Glitter, bombs, and glow-in the dark paint.\nSteph: What else needs to be said?\n\u00a0\nDuke:\u00a0 I feel the need to ask what actually happened.\nDuke: I mean, I\u2019m down for both pranking the shit out of the League or destroying them utterly.\u00a0\nDuke: Because you\u2019re a cult and I\u2019ve been corrupted.\nDuke: But I still like to know why occasionally.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJason: Big Bird?\nJason: You\u2019re damn quiet.\n\u00a0\nSteph: Unusually so.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDick: \u2026\nDick: I am upset.\n\u00a0\nDamian: Richard?\n\u00a0\nDick: Firstly; prank war not annihilation.\nDick: Standard Rules, Code 4\n\u00a0\nTim: No plans T through AB.\u00a0\nTim: Got it.\n\u00a0\nDick: There was a mission that went poorly because the League were idiots and their teamwork was subpar.\nDick: I would have made the Titans run drills for three weeks, minimum.\u00a0\nDick: Dad got blamed, though he was the main reason they got out of there in one piece.\nDick: Green Lantern said some things about Batman.\nDick: Some things about him working alone because no one would put up with him.\nDick: Supes and WW were the only ones who defended him, though Flash and Martian Manhunter were very uncomfortable.\u00a0\nDick: This is not the first time things have been said.\n\u00a0\nAlfred: Miss Barbara has shown me the tapes.\u00a0\nAlfred: I am condoning Master Dick\u2019s No Blood, Bones, or Death Rules, and adding a No Permanet Damage to Persons clause.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim: That\u2019s it? Nothing about property damage?\n\u00a0\nJason: Replacement!\nJason: Don\u2019t ask!\n\u00a0\nAlfred: Bunker C-23 has been made available for planning purposes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSteph: Shit just got real.\n\u00a0\nCass: :)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPrivate: Flash &amp; Nightwing\n\n\u00a0\nFlash: I\u2019m offering my services.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: For what?\n\u00a0\nFlash: I have no idea.\u00a0\nFlash: Just that I\u2019m pretty sure I want to be on your side.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Acceptable.\nNightwing: Instructions to follow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFast Family\n\n\u00a0\nWally: That was the right fucking choice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBarry: Oh goddamit.\u00a0\nBarry: I mean.\nBarry: No, that\u2019s what I mean.\u00a0\nBarry: How do you know?\nBarry: What do you know?\n\u00a0\nWally: Don\u2019t piss off Nightwing.\u00a0\nWally: Dude, I know he\u2019s really smiley and like\nWally: Super friendly.\nWally: But he\u2019s my generation\u2019s Batman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBarry: What.\n\u00a0\nWally: I thought you knew. You recruited him!\n\u00a0\nBarry: Because he was competent and smart and really good at dodging pointy shit!\u00a0\nBarry: And could pull crazy plans out of nowhere and had solid leadership skills.\nBarry: And had the respect of your entire generation of heroes.\nBarry: \u2026\u00a0\nBarry: Shit.\n\u00a0\nWally: You see it?\n\u00a0\nBarry: I see it.\nBarry: Smiling Batman.\nBarry: Fuck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWally: Yeah.\nWally: He\u2019s our friend, but he\u2019s also our leader for a reason.\nWally: The Titans don\u2019t know his name,\nWally: But we know he\u2019ll come for us, no mercy, if we\u2019re taken from him.\n\u00a0\nBarry: So no smile is bad?\n\u00a0\nWally: Very bad.\u00a0\nWally: Like I said.\nWally: You made the right fucking choice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBig Three (yes that includes you Batman)\n\n\u00a0\nBatman: The Watchtower is not being attacked by an enemy.\n\u00a0\nSuperman: What?\n\u00a0\nBatman: Thank you for attempting to defend me.\u00a0\nBatman: I am giving you advance notice as a reward.\u00a0\nBatman: Keep your guard up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: But you just said we weren\u2019t being attacked?\n\u00a0\nBatman: By an enemy.\nBatman: You\u2019re about to be attacked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: I see.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: I don\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Thank you for the warning, my friend.\nWonder Woman: Enjoy your vacation!\n\u00a0\nBatman: Thank you.\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Yes! Please do.\nSuperman: Diana, you\u2019re going to explain this to me, right?\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: It will be more amusing if I do not.\nWonder Woman: You\u2019ll figure it out soon enough.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Wow.\u00a0\nSuperman: I hate it when you gang up on me.\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: :)\n\u00a0\n\nHeroes of the Tower\n\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Does anyone have an extra spoon?\nSuperman: I brought soup for dinner during my watch and can\u2019t find any.\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: They were there for my pudding at lunch.\n\u00a0\nFlash: They\u2019re not now!\u00a0\nFlash: I just checked the entire kitchen.\nFlash: And all the storage rooms.\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Well this is a stupid prank.\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: I have one in my room, Supes, from late night ice cream.\u00a0\nHawkgirl: You\u2019ll have to wash it, but I\u2019ll grab it for you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Thank you!\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: So. Ice cream bowl is still here.\nHawkgirl: But no spoon.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: What the fuck?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey started small. Partly because escalation was a sound battle strategy but mostly because they were petty little shits. Petty little shits with four whole weeks.\u00a0\nThey started by stealing all the spoons. Well, Cass stole all the spoons, because she was a damn ghost and the least likely to be distracted with the entire Batfamily arguing on the comms about the definition of \u2018spoon.\u2019 She was clearly still listening, however, since she also grabbed soup ladles, measuring cups (both science and kitchen), wooden stirring spoons, two gardening spades, and two large cleaning buckets to carrying everything.\u00a0\nShe was frowning when she came back, that particular expression that Dick knew was part genuine disappointment and part pout.\u00a0\n\u201cToo easy,\u201d Cass said as she placed the buckets on the table with an audible thump that really expressed her irritation.\n\u201cI completely agree.\u201d Babs frowned from the Batcomputer that she and Tim had taken shared custody over as soon as Bruce had left the manor. The man had tried to use his Justice League vacation to catch up on Gotham work for all of an hour before he caved to Alfred\u2019s frosty glare and the combined eyes of Tim and Damian.\u00a0\nDick had maybe deserved the glare Bruce had sent his way as a laughing Selena tugged him to the car, but only maybe. His brothers had really added their own flare to the Baby Bird Eyes of Dick\u2019s youth, so he would argue that he was no longer responsible. But Bruce was gone so couldn\u2019t actually assign blame anyways.\u00a0\nBabs pulled up a still frame from the surveillance footage of Black Bat casually sitting on top of cabinet, one leg dangling, as Green Lantern and Hawkgirl walked down the hallway.\u00a0\nDick scratched the back of his head. \u201cThey\u2019re in a safe place. They know they\u2019re secure so are relaxing their guard.\u201d\u00a0\nAt the incredulous looks his family was sending, Dick held up both palms. \u201cHey, none of that now. Didn\u2019t say it was excusable. My Titans would be running drills for weeks, remember? Just want to put out a little context and keep in mind the fact that these people are highly trained. And that we\u2019re literally poking them into paranoia with a sharp, bat-shaped stick so we can\u2019t expect this behaviour the whole way through.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Tim scowled as he typed. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going in the report.\u201d\n\u201cCourse, Baby Bird.\u201d Dick leaned on the back of Tim\u2019s chair. \u201cHow\u2019s the cybersecurity?\u201d\nTim and Babs scoffed as one, Damian looking over from where he and Duke were paying way too close attention to something Jay was doing with wires. Damian looked just slightly confused at how similar their sound was to his trademark noise. No one else noticed the reaction, however, so Dick vowed to keep it to himself. For now.\n\u201cAbysmal.\u201d Babs huffed again, crossing her arms to glare at the screen that held security from all across the Watchtower. \u201cI mean, I helped Bruce set a lot of this up, so it\u2019s not like it was going to be particularly challenging for me to get into, but I haven\u2019t been involved in maintaining the systems and it shows.\u201d\n\u201cPart of Bruce\u2019s over-protective paranoia,\u201d Tim explained rather unnecessarily, but slightly petulantly. Dick knew the boy had permanent routes into the Justice League databases but had mostly, reluctantly, also left the security alone.\u00a0\nBabs started typing again. \u201cI know Cyborg at least is better than this.\u201d\n\u201cCyborg isn\u2019t allowed that deep into the systems yet. Technically all us newbies are still on probation.\u201d\nBabs looked over her glasses at him. \u201cThat\u2019s both fair and an extreme waste of resources.\u201d\n\u201cWe are ready for Stage Two,\u201d Damian announced before Dick could respond.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dick told Damian, Duke, and Jason, none of them even attempting to hide the small detonation device they\u2019d been working on. \u201cThat\u2019s like, Stage Six. At the earliest. And I know you all know that; you were part of the planning and the briefing.\u201d\n\u201cTt.\u201d\n\u201cFine, Dickiebird. Ruin our fun. Come on, Demon Brat, just means more time for building.\u201d\nDuke didn\u2019t follow Jason as the man walked away. Instead he tilted his head. \u201cSo when exactly is Stage Two starting?\u201d\nThere was a cackle and all heads turned back to the screens, Cass offering Dick a handful of popcorn from the bowl she\u2019d somehow produced.\n\u201cDo I want to know why you had that much purple spray paint on hand?\u201d Tim asked, sighing at the screen Duke was now staring at with hands on his hips.\n\u201cProbably not, Baby Bird,\u201d Dick lied as he settled on the arm of his brother\u2019s chair to watch Spoiler creep through the vents he\u2019d extensively mapped within a week of gaining probationary access to the Watchtower. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\nSpoiler spray painted all the weapons in the Tower purple for Stage Two. She started in the armoury only to use the fuss of everyone being drawn to the armoury by the newly purple weapons to hit what was left in the training rooms. She didn\u2019t get everything, leaving weapons that would be damaged permanently by the paint or might react badly to the chemicals (there were some odd alien or magic things in the Tower), but otherwise was very thorough.\nAnd Dick and Steph had been very thorough with the paint itself. It was Batpaint. It was not coming out without a particular mixture that the Flash could maybe synthesize, except for the part where he was an ally and wouldn\u2019t dare.\u00a0\nSteph also hit the things that were only weapons to a Bat. She found a couple of umbrellas. Replaced the kitchen pans with specialty purple ones that wouldn\u2019t contaminate food. Painted a couple of small, decorative statues. Managed to paint the entirety of a bookcase (while leaving all objects on said bookcase untouched) in honour of the shelving unit Damian had managed to topple onto drug kingpin last month.\u00a0\nShe also placed her purple cactus Stevie on the kitchen counter under Aquaman\u2019s snacks. Dick had given her that cactus for Christmas, and was very happy to see it weaponized for a good cause. Tim had thought the force-field enabled pot a bit overkill, but Dick had known it would come in handy.\nReally, Steph had been Dick\u2019s Batgirl, in the awful time when he\u2019d worn the Batman cowl. The Batfamily had no excuse not to realize just how frequently he and Steph were in perfectly coordinated cahoots. The only one who had picked up on their particular, patient brand of chaos was Damian (their Robin), and he was In On It half the time.\u00a0\nThe fact that the paint was not being used for the original intended purpose was a little disappointing, but he and Steph agreed that needs must. Besides, another month of false-security where Bruce\u2019s beloved Batmobile remained untouched would only be to their benefit.\u00a0\nTiming had to perfect for revenge, after all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHeroes of the Tower\n\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: So I know we were worried about the weapons all being purple.\nGreen Lantern: But so are all the pencils.\nGreen Lantern: And the stuffed moose that Wonder Woman brought back from that carnival mission.\nGreen Lantern: I think we\u2019re fine and the fucking prankster just went wild with purple paint and started with the weapons.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: I once captured a villain with a pack of pencils.\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Kid?\n\u00a0\nCyborg: I remember that.\u00a0\nCyborg: Why Beast Boy and Red Arrow keep betting against you I\u2019ll never know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Pencils are very dangerous things if sharpened correctly!\n\u00a0\nRaven: Didn\u2019t you also plant explosives in several stuffed animals?\nRaven: For that distraction in New York?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: It hurt my heart to do it.\nNightwing: But sometimes needs must.\nNightwing: I\u2019m sure Penguin agrees, what with all his weaponized umbrellas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlash: So all in favour of searching every single purple thing in case it\u2019s a weapon in disguise?\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Fuck.\nGreen Lantern: I ain\u2019t going near that moose.\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: I\u2019ll take the cookware.\nHawkgirl: I\u2019ve always wanted to whack someone up the head with a skillet.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Oh! So there was this time.\n\u00a0\nCyborg: No.\n\u00a0\nRaven: No.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: So there were no times.\u00a0\nNightwing: I\u2019m not allowed in the kitchen anyways.\u00a0\nNightwing: I\u2019ll take the the purple rug outside the small storage room!\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: The purple what now?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next few days or so were calmer, or so they seemed. Duke had suggested an early lull to further make things seem like just a couple of small pranks and allow for one on one targeting. He had been abashed when Cass had patted him on the head, but pleased with the general approval of the family. His psychological warfare training had clearly been progressing smoothly.\u00a0\nCass took Green Lantern for her part in the one on one targeting, hiding any remote from his view but always returning it when someone else appeared and Hal asked. Wonder Woman\u2019s expression when she\u2019d pointed to the remote for the monitors sitting on the nearby table was a thing of beauty.\u00a0\nDuke himself was responsible for using his illusion powers to periodically move Steph\u2019s cactus in a strategic manner. He\u2019d chosen Aquaman as his target to Steph\u2019s approval.\nJason had methodically switched all the books on the Watchtower to poetry volumes and Shakespeare. Martian Manhunter was more bemused than anything, but seemed to actually enjoyed the volumes and go on a hunt for the others. Green Arrow was a different story, particularly when technology started beeping at him and the physical instruction manuals were no longer to be found.\nTim signed Hawkgirl up for a mailing list about cookware, and then proceeded to find other lists for other heroes that referenced conversations that he shouldn\u2019t have had access to in the first place.\u00a0\nDamian had created an intel report focused on the fictional Rancher King\u2019s plan to steal all the world\u2019s cows. It was a thing of beauty, full of details and just enough plausibility that Shazam couldn\u2019t quite dismiss it off hand and pulled in Flash and Black Canary.\u00a0\nSteph and Babs had loved this particular plan so much that Steph was on page twenty four of the Rancher King\u2019s manifesto and Damian and Dick were currently on the Batplane to check out a recently decommissioned farm warehouse (the Riddler had recently tried a plan involving the international stage, animal puns, and way too many eggs) in order to repurpose it as the Rancher King\u2019s lair.\nThey wouldn\u2019t take the Justice League\u2019s attention from actual cases, naturally, but it had been a fairly calm week and the \u2018case\u2019 would build slowly. Hints would be dropped at appropriate (non-life-threatening) times to allude to the Rancher King\u2019s unfortunate past as a mistreated farm hand after his tragic accident in a lab that specialized in shrinking technology.\u00a0\nThey were running a little wild, but really, they\u2019d seen stranger things. Also, Dick was very glad that none of his family were really inclined to jump into the whole costumed villainy thing, Jay\u2019s anti-hero declarations aside. Steph\u2019s fake manifesto was very impassioned and Tim had a lot of ideas on how one might reasonably steal all the world\u2019s cows, starting in the US.\nDick would be concerned, but he was too busy being proud.\nDamian came to sit on the arm of Dick\u2019s chair and Dick switched everything over to autopilot; they still had a good thirty minutes before they arrived. He waited patiently, absently pretending to check different instruments until Damian found whatever words he needed.\u00a0\n\u201cIs it my fault?\u201d\nDick didn\u2019t actually know what his baby brother was talking about so he bit back the desire to promise that \u2018it\u2019 wasn\u2019t. He loved Damian with all his heart but knew well the kid was a bit of a hellion who, through no fault of his own, sometimes needed the \u2018assassin ways of doing things are not the only or even the best ways of doing things\u2019 conversation.\n\u201cIs what your fault, Baby Bat?\u201d\n\u201cFather\u2019s lockdown on identities. I am the youngest. It would be logical to assume that if I was not involved the order would have been removed long ago.\u201d\nDick leaned back, head thumping lightly into the chair. \u201cNo, Damian, it\u2019s not you fault.\u201d Before Damian could scoff, Dick nudged the boys shoulder and wrapped a hand around the kid\u2019s knee, making him just a bit more secure on his perch. \u201cDuke is newer than you, though not younger, and without your extensive training. The lockdown order was because we were young as a family, and so were the various Superhero teams. And because B is paranoid.\u201d\nDick raised a hand and traced it along Dami\u2019s cheekbone, a move that the kid wouldn\u2019t have accepted a year ago and probably still wouldn\u2019t accept from anyone else. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready, Baby Bat. Not with everything that\u2019s happened in Gotham and the family in the last few years. But we are now. We know exactly how we\u2019ll react when one of us is in trouble and its by pulling together. We trust our allies and our training and each other and it\u2019s time now. Despite the way B\u2019s love is making him scared.\u201d\nDamian leaned in, slight relief lacing his spine. Dick couldn\u2019t help but think this would be good for them all and not just because of the increased social connections and security to their friendships. They were all comfortable in the shadows, in secrecy, but there was something weighty in being acknowledged. It wasn\u2019t just his Baby Bat that could use another, more public claim that he belonged. That he was theirs.\nDick was going to tell everyone how proud of his family he was. He had a list. There were photos attached. It was maybe more of document or a report. In Power Point. With animations.\nRegardless, he had so much bragging to do.\n\u201cAnd Father will agree?\u201d\nDick didn\u2019t say that he was pretty sure Bruce already had. While he was irritatingly good at ignoring comments aimed his way because Batman didn\u2019t care and Brucie didn\u2019t notice, he was also irritatingly good at reading Dick. Bruce knew what giving Dick, much less the entire family, free reign actually meant.\u00a0\nWith a smile, Dick wrapped his arms around Damian\u2019s waist, ignoring the slight squawk and what were only token protests. \u201cCourse he will. That\u2019s Robin\u2019s job, isn\u2019t it? To pull Bruce into the light even when the shadows are his own fears?\u201d\nDamian looked at Dick for a long moment, face still and intent, before he scoffed. \u201cAnd to hurt those who hurt him.\u201d\nDick laughed.\u00a0\nHis brother wasn\u2019t wrong, after all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the Tower\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Are we going to talk about the cows?\nBlack Canary: I feel like it\u2019s time to talk about the cows.\n\u00a0\nFlash: Look, no one is stupid enough to try and kidnap the world\u2019s cows.\n\u00a0\nShazam: No!\nShazam: We don\u2019t challenge the bad guys to be dumb.\nShazam: That\u2019s stupid. And dangerous. And always comes true!\nShazam: Also. But what if it\u2019s true.\nShazam: Those poor cows!\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: You have a rouge that literally likes to cover things in ice.\n\u00a0\nFlash: Yeah, but that\u2019s surprisingly effective.\nFlash: And Bats has one of those too!\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Is now really the time to be talking about cows?\nGreen Lantern: I feel like we have more important matters than a two-bit villain\u2019s manifesto.\n\u00a0\nMartian Manhunter: It was a very well-written manifesto.\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Which is a warning sign.\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Batman does always say to watch out for the villains with degrees.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Enough about the cows!\nGreen Lantern: What about the ghosts?!\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Really?\u00a0\nBlack Canary: It\u2019s just the prankster.\n\u00a0\nFlash: Yeah, so.\nFlash: Supes, GL, and I have been investigating that.\nFlash: Everyone who\u2019s been in the Watchtower over the few weeks is in the clear.\nFlash: The video feeds are clear and the alibis are rock solid.\nFlash: GL is now convinced it\u2019s ghosts.\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: I have detected no true malevolence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShazam: Wait. Ghosts?!\nShazam: Is that what those sounds were?\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: What sounds?\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Ok.\nBlack Canary: We\u2019re not really believing this.\n\u00a0\nFlash: I am not dis-believing this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Supes?\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Raven and Zantanna are unable to assist.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: They\u2019re in Spain!\u00a0\nNightwing: Some problem with flying demonic monsters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Do you know if they need assistance?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Not really.\u00a0\nNightwing: I think they\u2019re having fun with it.\nNightwing: Sometimes a straightforward smash and defeat is kind cathartic, you know?\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Indeed I do!\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: So, I hate to ask.\nGreen Lantern: But.\nGreen Lantern: Constantine?\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Haven\u2019t been able to get in contact at all.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: He\u2019s back in Hell.\nNightwing: Temporarily.\u00a0\nNightwing: He was very clear that he doesn\u2019t need rescuing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Fucking-\nGreen Lantern: Are you friends with everyone, kid?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Do you really want me to answer that?\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Go befriend the ghosts then.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Bold of you to assume I haven\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPrivate: Flash &amp; Nightwing\n\n\u00a0\nFlash: So.\u00a0\nFlash: There aren\u2019t any ghosts, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Do you want that answer or details about the cows?\n\u00a0\nFlash: I-\nFlash: I mean, that\u2019s an answer in itself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Is it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlash: Yes?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: If you insist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlash: Oh goddamit.\nFlash: I pick the cows.\u00a0\nFlash: I can\u2019t risk not having access to cheese.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: The Rancher King\u2019s a set up.\nNightwing: Please report to the following location for the next stage.\nNightwing: Bring Black Canary and Green Lantern.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlash: Thank fuck.\nFlash: Yeah, okay.\nFlash: I want you know that I\u2019m not going to ask how you created an entire supervillain in the span of two weeks and half-convinced the entire Justice League that said villain is stealing cows on an international scale.\u00a0\nFlash: But I\u2019m taking this as reason to believe that either the ghosts are you, or you have befriended them into your benevolent mystery revenge-seeking army.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: First off, half-convinced?\nNightwing: Rude.\u00a0\nNightwing: Wait until you get to the Rancher King\u2019s evil lair.\nNightwing: Secondly, benevolent.\nNightwing: Ha.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the (Haunted) Tower\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Please tell me someone else hears that cackling.\n\u00a0\n\nMagic Friends!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nNightwing: The Watchtower is not haunted.\u00a0\nNightwing: I will owe a small favour and provide a pie of your choice if you\u2019re too busy to actually confirm this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConstantine: Do I want to ask?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Not if you want pie.\nNightwing: And you do.\n\u00a0\nZantanna: I mean, I\u2019m actually busy in Spain but won\u2019t say no to pie.\nZantanna: And the story, whenever we can hear it.\n\u00a0\nRaven: Nightwing is waging a prank war on the Justice League for unknown reasons.\u00a0\nRaven: The Titans are staying away because he\u2019s genuinely pissed off and a prank war is really a mild form of retribution.\nRaven: Also, is the pie from your usual baked goods supplier?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: You bet it is.\n\u00a0\nRaven: I want blueberry.\u00a0\nRaven: Want help in Spain, Zantanna?\n\u00a0\nZantanna: Sure!\u00a0\nZantanna: Can I have strawberry rhubarb?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConstantine: I will trade the pie for photographic evidence of Green Lantern and Aquaman being covered in slime.\u00a0\nConstantine: Do you know how many magic users Aquaman works with?\nConstantine: And he still touched the ominous glowing orb.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: There seems to be a lot of that going around.\n\u00a0\nConstantine: I still smell the slime.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Done and done!\nNightwing: But actually.\u00a0\nNightwing: Done.\nNightwing sent a video: [Aquaman is hunched over a small potted purple cactus with a good foot of space, hissing that he\u2019s knows it\u2019s stalking him, and he will not let this behaviour stand. He takes a dramatic but martially correct stance and thrusts his trident forward, only to meet a flaring purple shield with enough force that he his sent flying backwards into the nearby Green Lantern. They knock into the wall, which explodes in glitter and triggers a pouring of thick, oily goop onto both their heads from the ceiling. There is a loud, high shriek and a roar of rage as the video pans around the full mess. The cactus is nowhere to be seen.]\n\u00a0\nConstantine: I knew there was a reason I liked you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStage Four was mainly down to Cass, Damian, and Dick. At least for the first few days. It was a very simple plan that basically boiled down to moving more shit around. They moved furniture slightly. Left cups and weapons and briefing notes in places that were not where their owners had left them.\u00a0\nTim started the escalation by fucking with the temperature of the Watchtower and creating cold rooms that did not match the readings. After that, he played the recordings at random times from hidden speakers. Many were ambient Gotham noise from particularly high up gargoyles, since the wind really shrieked around those stone wings.\u00a0\nJason had quite a bit of fun gaining the rest and he wasn\u2019t specifying where exactly the screams and moans came from. Dick would have been more concerned but he was the sole owner of the knowledge (excepting Bruce and Alfred who did not count) that Jason had been in the drama club during high school.\u00a0\nBesides, being dramatic asses together was a core foundation of his and Jason\u2019s relationship. They had also maybe spent too long getting the Robin Cackle to bounce back just right off rooftops but they weren\u2019t going to tell anyone.\u00a0\nBesides, the way Green Lantern flinched and Shazam twitched every time Timmy played the cackle recording was hilarious. Particularly when he timed it with the glitching of various electronic equipment.\u00a0\nThey let recordings take center stage for a good day or so before the writing appeared. The writing that was maybe more like random graffiti located all around the Watchtower in inconspicuous places like vents, baseboards, shelf edges, and the fridge. And the the walls, doors, and lighting fixtures. Also inside the cabinets and cereal boxes.\nShazam had been pulled off the cows to looks at the writing, since he might not have a lot of experience with ghosts, but did with \u2018magic mumbo jumbo,\u2019 in the words of Green Arrow. Unfortunately for Shazam (and Dick was planning on inviting the poor kid for dinner after this as he could probably use some of Alfred\u2019s lasagna), the writing wasn\u2019t magic at all.\nA week and a surprising assist from Superman later had Shazam bursting into the most recent meeting about the nature and threat assessment of moving purple\u00a0 folding chairs while waving a stack of papers.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s another manifesto!\u201d Shazam shouted.\n\u201cFrom the ghosts?\u201d Asked Dick, smiling benevolently and getting suspicious looks from Green Lantern and Hawkgirl. They didn\u2019t really believe Dick had made friends with the ghosts, but were still suspicious. This was fair because Flash and Cyborg had started asking Dick how the ghosts were doing in a conversational manner only for less stuff to go wrong directly around them.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom the cactus.\u201d\u00a0\nAquaman twitched so hard that he tried to cover it up by slamming his palms on the table and standing abruptly. \u201cI knew its disappearance was trouble!\u201d\nSteph giggled madly in Dick\u2019s ear as the boys took potshots at the various heroes\u2019 inability to multitask. Dick was already waiting for Superman\u2019s look when the man heard the voices on Dick\u2019s comm, resting his chin on his hand as various shouts and complaints built around them, much like they had after that disastrous mission that had started it all.\n\u201cShh, Uncle Supes,\u201d Dick whispered into his hand, able to tell by the fairest frown between Superman\u2019s eyebrows that he was indeed able to hear the whisper over the growing cacophony. \u201cDon\u2019t want to spoil B\u2019s surprise, now do we?\u201d\nSuperman blinked, mouthed the words \u2018uncle\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 before his eyes rounded comically wide and he made an odd jerk of the head that Dick imagined would have led to whipping his head around had B been there or had Supes not already been looking at Dick.\nDick lowered his hand to smirk, low and self-satisfied in a way that he had absolutely stolen from his father when Batman had made a particularly clever deduction or solved a particularly difficult problem. Dick would have gone with the Batgrowl or Batglare, but the growl needed a certain level of volume to be effective and the glare would have been too effective at silencing the\u00a0 surrounding nonsense.\nSuperman blinked for another moment before beaming at Dick. Dick huffed a laugh; the man had no subtly at all. Thankfully, only Wonder Woman noticed Superman\u2019s odd behaviour, the rest bickering about priority rankings between cows, ghosts, the colour purple, and getting a full tech re-working of the Tower because cold spots, malfunctions, and random Disney songs could not be normal operating procedures and where was Bataman when you needed him? Did no one else have the missing instruction manual memorized?\u00a0\nDick didn\u2019t even have to try to add to the chaos. He did, of course, but it took almost no effort all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBig Three (Even with Batman on Vacation)\n\n\u00a0\nSuperman: I can\u2019t believe he never told us!\nSuperman: I know you\u2019re not getting this now, B, but I can\u2019t believe you never told us!\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Told us what?\n\u00a0\nSuperman: I mean, I can.\u00a0\nSuperman: You\u2019re very secretive, B.\nSuperman: But really!\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Clark, my friend, told us what?\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Why we\u2019re being attacked!\nSuperman: And by whom!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Yes, the Batman-retribution plan.\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Though I am still unsure as to the whom. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Wait.\nSuperman: You don\u2019t know who?\nSuperman: Or why who?\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Why who?\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Why they\u2019re getting retribution for Batman?\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Because they were as outraged at the treatment of our friend as we were.\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Oh.\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Clark.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: I\u2019m starting to see why you like keeping things from me.\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Clark.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: It will be more amusing if I say nothing.\nSuperman: You\u2019ll figure it out soon enough.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: Clark.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuperman: Or they\u2019ll reveal it soon enough.\n\u00a0\nBatman: Definitely the latter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPhase Five, the Cat Phase, had been a joint plan from Tim and Damian. Dick had almost cried when they\u2019d presented it. He didn\u2019t, because that would make one or both of them clam right up, start insulting the other, and bring out something sharp. But the temptation was there.\u00a0\nDamian proposed bringing several of the stray Gotham cats up to the Watchtower in order to cause confusion. Gotham cats were, naturally, as tough if not tougher than her people and Damian had been feeding them for months. He was the Pied Piper of cats to the point where Bruce had tested the boy for a Meta gene twice.\u00a0\nTim proposed adding several robotic cats. Apparently, Tim had been working on a spy-cat for Damian\u2019s birthday that was ready for some practical testing. This would have the dual benefit of gaining more information and messing with anyone who could communicate with animals.\u00a0\nTim went to add that he could modify the cactus-pot-forcefield into collars for the living cats, so they could be extra safe. The Justice League were heroes and generally quite fond of animals, but one never could be too safe when dealing with unpredictable powers. The surprised look that Damian sent Tim was edged with just a bit of awe, which Tim caught, if the embarrassed blush was anything to go by.\u00a0\nThey ironed out some of the details as a group before patrol, with Damian and Tim going out together to select which of Damian\u2019s cats (because Bruce was coming back to a bunch of adopted strays that he wouldn\u2019t be able to deny after they\u2019d defended Bruce\u2019s honour so valiantly) as the ones that would be suited for or enjoy a new environment.\u00a0\nJason had volunteered to partner with Dick, which wasn\u2019t unusual, exactly, but not particularly common either. Jay would accept Dick latching on to him for patrols with minimal grumbling, and the occasional pleased slant to his sneer, but wasn\u2019t generally keen on volunteering for anything that wasn\u2019t immediate violence.\nSo Dick was not surprised when, halfway into the surprisingly quiet patrol (or maybe not that surprisingly, since the entire Batfamily was in the city and that was the kind of thing Gothamites noticed), Jason removed his helmet and turned to Dick on an empty rooftop.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s eating you, Goldie?\u201d\nDick sighed, but Jay\u2019s mask didn\u2019t do anything to hide the determined slant to his jaw. Dick\u2019s baby brother was bracing for Emotions.\nDick leaned back against the nearby gargoyle, stone claws digging faintly into his back as he crossed his arms.\n\u201cWell, you ain\u2019t denying there\u2019s something, so I guess that\u2019s a start.\u201d Jason came to loom right in front of Dick and Dick almost wanted to tear up again. Jason hated emotional talks, yet here he was, worried for Dick.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I mean. What\u2019s up with the tears, Dickhead?\u201d Jay\u2019s hand tapped at Dick\u2019s jaw, having read the tenseness there just as easily as Dick had Jay\u2019s.\nDick sighed again, but stepped forward. He didn\u2019t go for a full hug, because Jay really had to be in the right mood for those particularly when in the open, but leaned his head on his brother\u2019s armoured chest. Dick melted just a bit closer when a large, gloved hand settled on the back of his neck.\n\u201cJust tired, Hood.\u201d\nJason paused, mind clearly turning. \u201cOkay. Tired from what? Or of what?\u201d\n\u201cI already told you about the League.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, which is why I know that\u2019s not it. We have a plan for that shit. Sides, Batman can take care of himself-\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Batman!\u201d Dick winced as he felt his brother flinch at Dick\u2019s volume. When Jay didn\u2019t move away, Dick pressed his forehead just a bit harder into his baby brother\u2019s armour and raised his hands so they were anchored in Jay\u2019s leather jacket.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about B,\u201d Dick repeated, softer. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s just. He shouldn\u2019t have to. We can all look after ourselves, Hood. B would never have let us run wild if we couldn\u2019t. But we don\u2019t have to.\u201d\nDick took a half step back and raised his head to look Jason in the face.\u00a0\n\u201cI sat in the fucking Tower when Red Arrow hopped on his bike and rode to answer your distress call last month. Spoiler and Red Robin brought down that Pumpkin Monster on National television and I couldn\u2019t tell the hero right next to me that those were my baby siblings. That idiot vigilante from Maine told Robin to stop throwing a tantrum for his legitimate concerns about an alien bear\u2019s safety and I couldn\u2019t give her the verbal beatdown of her life.\u201d\nDick\u2019s gloved fingers flexed in Jay\u2019s jacket and the younger man reached up to cover them.\u00a0\n\u201cI get B\u2019s secrecy policy. I even agreed with it, mostly, when I wasn\u2019t being an idiot teenager. But, it\u2019s been a hard few years.\u201d Dick lowered his head again, right over his baby brother\u2019s (beating, not stopped) heart. \u201cA really hard few years. We\u2019ve come so far, Little Wing. So far. Robin and RR are plotting together. Signal\u2019s admitting he\u2019s ours unprompted. BB and Spoiler haven\u2019t missed a family dinner in months. You\u2019re willingly patrolling with me because you\u2019re worried. I\u2019m just so so proud of us. And, I don\u2019t- I want people to know.\u201d\nJason shifted slightly as Dick breathed, his hands pressing into Dick as if bracing him.\n\u201cWhen the Joker kidnapped Robin,\u201d Jason started slowly, tensing along with Dick though neither moved away, \u201cwe were patrolling together. I remember hearing Bruce\u2019s voice on the comms, but not his words. There was a lot of green in my vision, but I still saw you, your expression. I remember thinking, \u2018Oh, so we\u2019re going to war.\u2019 There was no hesitation, no doubt that you wouldn\u2019t be exactly at my side. That the other\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be at our backs.\u201d\n\u201cOurs,\u201d said Cass, leaping lightly down from the gargoyle with a scuff of sound that was nothing less than courtesy. She wrapped herself around Dick\u2019s back and he adjusted with practiced ease as she leaned forward and hooked her arm around Jay\u2019s neck. \u201cOur baby siblings. Protect.\u201d\nDick laughed, probably a bit wetly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason agreed, definitely a bit gruffly. \u201cAnd sure, B\u2019s plan for the secret army to protect the kids with the element of surprise was fine, but I\u2019m for something a bit more direct. We\u2019ll let the world know what Gotham already does.\u201d\n\u201cHurt a Bat, get all Bats,\u201d Cass agreed.\u00a0\nDick released Jay\u2019s jacket with on hand to grip his sister\u2019s arm.\u00a0\nHe wondered what exactly Jay had seen in his expression that night Dami had been taken, either at the moment or later, when the Joker had ended up broken at Nightwing\u2019s feet. Dick knew that all the kids had looked at him differently after that night. Not in a bad way, but in a more knowing way.\u00a0\nDick had watched his parents die. Dick had lost his baby brother before he\u2019d known how to handle a baby brother and getting Jay back hadn\u2019t really changed the fact that he\u2019d been gone. Dick had watched is family grow and take the skies and try to do nothing more or less than help. Dick had taken a long look at all the strays his father had started trying to care for, to save, and said okay. Had said alright. Had said mine.\u00a0\nThe Batkids knew what that meant, now. Bruce had always known, even if he\u2019d briefly forgotten, because Bruce had let a child call himself Batman\u2019s partner and understood that for all the ways it wasn\u2019t true, there was more that one way it was.\u00a0\n\u201cBig Bird not alone, either.\u201d Cass buried her face in Dick\u2019s hair.\n\u201cFuck no,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI ain\u2019t letting you fuck shit up on your own. Time to punch all those shitheads in the face.\u201d\nDick laughed again. This time the sound was warm and soft and bladed around the edges.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the (Haunted) Tower\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nGreen Arrow: Is this a ghost cat?\nGreen Arrow sent a photo: [A pale grey cat with one missing eye and claw marks raked down it\u2019s back sits in the middle of an empty hall staring at the camera with reflective eyes.]\n\u00a0\nWonder Woman: I do not believe so.\nWonder Woman: This one, however, is not alive.\nWonder Woman sent a photo: [Glowing red eyes and a faint feline face are just visible through the grate of a vent.]\n\u00a0\nAquaman: There are two in the kitchen.\nAquaman: One is purring so probably not dead.\nAquaman: Though it\u2019s sitting in the initial cactus zone so is suspicious.\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: Will you leave the cactus thing alone?\nHawkgirl: It was a plant and therefore not stalking you.\nHawkgirl: If it ever even existed.\u00a0\nHawkgirl: The cactus manifesto was clearly just another prank.\n\u00a0\nAquaman: You will regret doubting the danger of the cactus.\n\u00a0\nShazam: The possible ghost kitties like the cow!\nShazam sent a photo: [A large brown cow is standing on polished floors while chewing something from the large pot in front of it. A cat sits on it\u2019s head, another sits on it\u2019s haunch, one pokes their head out of the pot, and the last is twines their way around it\u2019s hooves.]\n\u00a0\nSuperman: \u2026\nSuperman: Why is there a cow in Training Room 2?\n\u00a0\nShazam: We rescued it!\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: That is actually what happened.\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: The Rancher King\u2019s hideout was wild.\nGreen Lantern: Only one real cow though.\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: There were fake cows?\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: So many.\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Wall to wall cow stuffed animals, children\u2019s toys, etc.\nBlack Canary: New kind of creepy.\u00a0\nBlack Canary: We\u2019re currently trying to track town the Rancher King through purchase orders for cow toys and terrifyingly large amounts of cattle feed.\n\u00a0\nSuperman: But why is the one real cow in Training Room 2?\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: You try telling Flash and Shazam no at the same damn time.\n\u00a0\nShazam: We need to find the cow\u2019s home!\nShazam: And Nightwing says he knows a guy.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: I do!\nNightwing: Do you want me to ask them about the ghost kitties?\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: They aren\u2019t ghosts.\nHawkgirl: But I found three more in the rafters.\nHawkgirl: So yes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian and Tim were standing side by side staring at the giant cactus that was Stage Five Point Five with two cat carriers at their feet and a robotic cat around each of their necks.\n\u201cI decided to request quality over quantity from Poison Ivy.\u201d\n\u201cGood choice, Demon Brat. Good choice.\u201d\u00a0\nDick flung an arm around both of their shoulders. \u201cI agree. And good work in general.\u201d\nHis brothers tried to be aloof but couldn\u2019t hide their slight preening. They were so cute.\u00a0\n\u201cTwenty bucks that Aquaman convinces the tower that Spoiler\u2019s cactus either mutated or was previously in disguise,\u201d Tim said.\nDick snorted. \u201cNo go. They\u2019re certainly not going to guess that it was Harley\u2019s anniversary present to Ivy.\u201d\n\u201cRichard. Where exactly did Harley get the idea of a purple cactus gift?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I mentioned my gift to Spoiler. I did not suggest an alien cactus or encourage Ivy to turn it into a partially-sentient giant.\u201d\n\u201cYou really should have anticipated that, though. You and Harley are both very extra,\u201d Tim pointed out calmly.\nDick shook his head in betrayal and pointedly didn\u2019t mention his and Harley\u2019s monthly Back-flip-a-thons. \u201cNo idea what you mean Baby Bird.\u201d\n\u201cYou will look after her?\u201d Damian asked as he bent down to retrieve his cat carrier.\u00a0\n\u201cCourse I\u2019ll look after our loaned cactus, Baby Bat. I\u2019m not going to piss off the Sirens and besides, it wouldn\u2019t do to mess up this close to then end, now would it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the (Haunted) Tower\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHawkgirl: Uh.\nHawkgirl: So I regret doubting the cactus.\n\u00a0\nAquaman: Ha!\nAquaman: Victory!\nAquaman: Wait. Why?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMartian Manhunter joined Dick in watching over the giant cactus (according to Harley, her name was Eustace). J\u2019onn had finished reading Eustace two volumes of poetry and Dick and J\u2019onn had made it through three games of Go Fish when the Flash came to find them.\n\u201cSuperman said you two are on plant-watch.\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Dick popped the sound. \u201cPretty easy gig, to be honest. Bit of a safe zone, if Eustace likes you.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Asked Barry, eyeing the giant cactus that rustled threatening over his head. He didn\u2019t bat an eye at the name.\n\u201cQuite,\u201d J\u2019onn replied. \u201cShe likes poetry.\u201d\n\u201cCool. Cool cool.\u201d He zipped away only to return with four of Jay\u2019s poetry substitutions, a pizza, and three kinds of chips. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind, but I could use a bit of time in a safe zone. Aquaman\u2019s crying in a closet, Green Lantern is being defeated by the possible ghost kitties, Green Arrow is being defeated by the computer, and Superman and Wonder Woman have taken over for Shazam and Black Canary after the fourteenth shell company for the Rancher King made Black Canary chuck a laptop at the wall.\u201d\n\u201cYou are welcome to join us.\u201d J\u2019onn gestured to the ground beside his camp chair, missing the slightly dirty look Flash sent Nightwing at the mention of the Rancher King. Dick ignored him, but the point was fair. Tim and Babs had maybe gone a bit overboard in protecting the identity of their fictitious villain.\u00a0\nOh well, Cass and Duke had a fantastic time selecting all the stuffed cows, puzzles, and plastic animals, not to mention all the charitable organizations that were about to get very large donations of farm-related toys. \u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d Barry sighed.\u00a0\n\u00a0They made it to round eight before Dick decided to ask the question. Round eight had progressed to giving the draw pile to Eustace and letting her wave the cards about on long needles. J\u2019onn was using telekinesis to retrieve the cards, Barry his speed, and Dick both the fact that he was Eustace\u2019s favourite and that he had cards stashed in his boot.\n\u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d Dick drawled as he and his companions ignored a distant explosion. \u201cWhen do we call for backup?\u201d\nFlash paused after receiving the Jack of Diamonds from a slightly pouty J\u2019onn. \u201cWhy does no one realize all our children follow you?\u201d\n\u201cMy sister says it\u2019s because my smile is full of secrets. My brother says it\u2019s because I\u2019m a demon in disguise. Which rude, I\u2019m much worse than those bozos we took out last week. My other brother says it\u2019s because I\u2019m a savage sleeper agent of sunshine and mayhem with a pointy smile that hides my fondness for electricity and general protective possessiveness. But he was missing a lot of sleep and had drunk more coffee than should be humanly possible so I forgave him. Dad says it\u2019s because people are stupid.\u201d\nFlash let his card fall from his hand as he stared at Dick. \u201cI am afraid.\u201d\u00a0\nJ'onn smiled serenely. \u201cYour father must be proud.\u201d\n\u201cHe will be,\u201d Dick said with a pointy smile that did not hide his fondness for petty revenge against those that hurt his people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the (Haunted) Tower\n\n\u00a0\nGreen Lantern: Did the Rancher King steal back his cow?\nGreen Lantern: The cow is gone.\n\u00a0\nShazam: So are the cats!\n\u00a0\nMartian Manhunter: And Eustace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: God damn it all to hell. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWe are the Night\n\n\u00a0\nDick: Stage Six.\n\u00a0\nJason: Fuck yeah!\nJason: Boom time.\n\u00a0\n\nTitans Watch Party\n\n\u00a0\nKid Flash: I just got called as backup for the Watchtower.\nKid Flash: Should I be sick?\nKid Flash: Or kidnapped or something.\n\u00a0\nWonder Girl: Red Arrow and I also got called.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Feel free to go right on up.\n\u00a0\nRed Arrow: Well shit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCyborg: No seriously.\nCyborg: Get your asses up here.\nCyborg: This is the most hilarious and terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\u00a0\nKid Flash: I\u2019m curious.\nKid Flash: But also fucking cautious.\n\u00a0\nCyborg posted a photo: [A small kid in red, green, and yellow crouches on the watchtower fridge. Green Lantern is peeking around a door as if the greatest danger isn\u2019t already behind him. He doesn\u2019t see the raised Batarang in the kid\u2019s hand captured so clearly on the frozen security footage.]\n\u00a0\nWonder Girl: I\u2019m sorry.\nWonder Girl: Is that a fucking Robin suit?\nWonder Girl: As in Nightwing\u2019s Robin?\n\u00a0\nCyborg posted a photo: [Green Arrow and Superman are covered in glitter and paint, staring at each other in confusion even as they settle into battle stances. A shadow is barely visible arcing towards an open vent, mostly blurred but with straighter lines along the full face mask as if the figure was looking directly at the camera.\n\u00a0\nAqualad: Concerning? \u00a0\n\u00a0\nCyborg posted a photo: [A young man in red and a young woman in purple stand around a group of three heroes tied together with some sort of cord. Hawkgirl is struggling while her companions try to dodge her partially bound wings. The young man is standing with his hands on his hips in clear disappointment and the young woman is bent over, laughing wildly.]\n\u00a0\nKid Flash: I think that\u2019s Spoiler and Red Robin.\nKid Flash: They work with some of the newer heroes sometimes.\nKid Flash: Took out that Pumpkin Monster last month.\n\u00a0\nRed Arrow: Red Robin.\u00a0\nRed Arrow: Robin.\n\u00a0\nCyborg posted a photo: [A large figure lounges on an exposed ceiling beam with a series of guns beside him. The red paint splattering the floor, walls, and various heroes matches the colour of his helmet.]\n\u00a0\nAqualad: Isn\u2019t that an actual crime lord?\n\u00a0\nRed Arrow: He\u2019s reformed!\nRed Arrow: Mostly.\n\u00a0\nCyborg posted a photo: [A man in yellow hangs upside down from the ceiling in order to attach something to a doorway. His back is to the camera but he looks comfortable. Settled.]\n\u00a0\nWonder Girl: That\u2019s Wing\u2019s vampire pose.\n\u00a0\nRaven posted a photo: [Nightwing smirks at the camera, legs braced slightly apart for balance. The Robin-child is clinging to his back, one hand free to raise a katana threateningly. There is another figure crouched on the floor, its previously blurry mask sharp and clear as the black form braces itself against Nightwing\u2019s calf.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Who wants to meet my family?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce walked into the Watchtower expecting to find chaos. He hadn\u2019t expected to find his children in an all-out stand-off with the Justice League and was actually rather disappointed in himself. Now that Bruce was presented with the line of Gotham vigilantes facing a battered Justice League, supplemented with the occasional Titan and reserve member, this outcome seemed rather obvious.\u00a0\nBruce eyed the pockmarked walls behind the standoff warily. There had clearly been several minor explosions and not all of the glitter and goop variety.\u00a0\n\u201cBatman!\u201d Wonder Woman called out, obviously pleased with the battle so far and face to face with Robin, both with swords drawn. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your vacation.\u201d\n\u201cIt was adequate.\u201d They only mistake he\u2019d made was listening to Alfred when the man encouraged him to head right up to the Watchtower. The man never wanted him to head right up to the Watchtower. \u201cDare I ask?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re being invaded!\u201d Hal had obviously taken more hits than the others and was still partially doused in yellow paint. He almost had Bruce\u2019s sympathy; personal experience told Bruce that the paint did not come out in the wash.\nNightwing, however, chirped, \u201cTeamwork exercises!\u201d\nAll the heroes turned to look at him, dawning realization in several stances, particularly the Titans. Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, Aqualad, and Red Arrow all audibly groaned.\u00a0\nMartian Manhunter nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t. What the hell?\u201d Asked Green Arrow.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it to you later,\u201d Red Arrow told him from his place beside Black Canary. \u201cJust arm up.\u201d\nTo his credit, Green Arrow did raise his bow again.\u00a0\nHood grinned from the Bat side. \u201cTime to choose a side, Old Man.\u201d\nBruce didn\u2019t look to see the reactions to that particular comment, though he did hear at least three gasps at the name. Instead, he threw a handful of smoke bombs and lunged at Aquaman.\nBruce never had to choose when it came to his children.\u00a0\nAquaman flinched hard enough that Batman knew his children hadn\u2019t been holding back while he was gone. It took a swift kick and a Batarang and the man\u2019s trident went flying, Spoiler catching it with a cackle as she raced by. Aquaman whirled at the sound, as he was meant to, and Batman swept his feet from under him and had the man tied up in a matter of moments.\u00a0\nBatman turned, ducking as he went to avoid an arrow and almost smiled as Robin threw Green Lantern\u2019s ring into the middle of empty space. Green Lantern crowed, thinking he\u2019d finally get the ring back, but Signal appeared in true Bat fashion to snatch it from Green Lantern\u2019s grasp.\u00a0\nRed Robin and Black Bat were dealing with both the Flashes, keeping them occupied as Hood lay down cover fire while also duelling projectiles with both Arrows. Batman felt this was a lot for Hood to be dealing with, so threw a series of Batarangs at Green Arrow, who split his attention from Hood to face Batman. This was a mistake, since he completely missed Spoiler creeping up behind him in order to whack him in the arm with a large purple frying pan.\u00a0\nGreen Arrow went down to one knee at the force of the blow and Batman slid forward into the space to bind him. Green Arrow glared at Batman, frown only growing as Spoiler yanked his quiver off his back and danced away after a quick sideways hug for Batman.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Green Arrow asked.\u00a0\n\u201cWinning,\u201d Batman replied.\u00a0\nHe watched Spoiler kick Black Canary in the stomach, Red Robin attacking from behind after switching spots with Signal. Signal and Hood were wrapping up the fight with the Flashes, using Signal\u2019s powers to manoeuvre both speedsters into the optimal position for Hood\u2019s tranquilizers. Kid Flash was already down, cuffed, and hurling playful insults at Nightwing.\u00a0\nNightwing and Robin were dancing.\u00a0\nThe two of them were taking on Hawkgirl and flipping around each other so much that Hawkgirl was getting dizzy, swearing up a storm and demanding they stay fucking still. Batman could have told her that Nightwing didn\u2019t do still.\u00a0\nWonder Girl came to Hawkgirl\u2019s rescue and Nightwing ducked down so Robin could spring off his back, gaining height for a spectacular barrage of Birdarangs. Robin landed amidst a pink smoke bomb thrown by Nightwing and disarmed Hawkgirl of her mace which was sent flying into Spoiler\u2019s waiting clutches. Nightwing took the moment to signal for Black Bat to take over for him, since he was intentionally avoiding fighting any of the Titans as they were already highly familiar with is abilities.\nThis probably also explained why Raven was already off to the side, bearing a cheap name-tag style sticker that read \u2018Out\u2019 in blue marker on her cloak. She looked quiet content to sit and watch. Cyborg was ignoring everything to type madly at a computer. Batman knew the stance of a techie losing a battle with Oracle well.\u00a0\nBatman barely had time to check his own takedowns of Aquaman and Green Arrow and confirm that one of his children had attached an \u2018Out\u2019 sticker to both their foreheads, before he spun and caught Wonder Woman\u2019s sword on his gauntlet.\u00a0\n\u201cYour children are marvellous,\u201d she told him, a wide grin on her face.\nHe let himself smile back, amused at the increased glee on Wonder Woman\u2019s face. \u201cI know.\u201d\nHe ducked, and Wonder Woman started, just slightly, which unbalanced her when she ducked a moment later to doge Nightwing\u2019s kick. Nightwing crouched for just a moment, back pressed into Batman\u2019s shin, grinning wildly. Batman placed one heavy palm on his son\u2019s messy hair and then they moved.\nBack and forth, sideways and zigzag, he and Nightwing pressed ever forward in a pattern they\u2019d been perfecting for years. They\u2019d worked for this smoothness, for this ability just to know where the other would be. They\u2019d worked to get it back after harsh words and changing styles had damaged what once had been instinctive.\u00a0\nBatman was the strong arm, the brute and ruthless force. Nightwing was the precision weapon, the sharp and relentless edge. They backed Wonder Woman up, step by step, until she stood almost back to back with Superman.\nSuperman was holding Red Hood up by the scrub of his coat, letting him dangle there with crossed arms. Clearly, the man didn\u2019t quite know what to do with Hood now that he was caught. This wasn\u2019t exactly an uncommon experience with Hood.\nNightwing, however, pivoted off Batman\u2019s back (exactly as Damian had done his, and Bruce hadn\u2019t teared up the first time he\u2019d seen them complete that manoeuvre, Tim and his photography were lying) to leap over Wonder Woman\u2019s head, land neatly on Superman\u2019s shoulders, and shove Kryptonite in his face.\u00a0\nSuperman staggered, which released Hood just enough for the man to slip cuffs out of his coat and onto Superman\u2019s wrists. There was an \u2018Out\u2019 tag in blue and red marker on the cuffs with a note underneath saying \u2018We both know these could have been laced with Kryptonite; sit the fuck down.\u2019\nWonder Woman continued her turn to track Nightwing and shifted in a move meant to free Superman. She halted half way when Black Bat tapped her on the shoulder and pointed to the \u2018Out\u2019 sticker Black Bat had placed on her skirt during Nightwing\u2019s showy move.\nWith a laugh, Wonder Woman sat, dragging a bemused Superman down with her.\u00a0\nBatman turned to survey the rest of the chaos, and saw that it had mostly wrapped up. Martian Manhunter was also sitting calmly, tag on his cloak and smile on his face. Shazam was wrapped in some sort of jelly substance, sticker on his cheek. Black Canary was sitting against a wall, meta cuffs on her wrist and sticker on her boot.\nRed Arrow and Wonder Girl were arguing with each other as Robin stuck a sticker to each of the arms, right over the reinforced rope that tied the two together. Aqualad had a gag over his mouth with an \u2018Out\u2019 tag hanging off it and was sitting at his mentor\u2019s feet and patting him on the leg in what was either meant to be a comforting or condescending manner.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I think that wraps things up nicely, don\u2019t you?\u201d Nightwing asked, coming to stand at Batman\u2019s side.\u00a0\nBatman eyed his son speculatively and waited. Spoiler dropped down from the ceiling, sack full of now purple weaponry clanking to the floor and drawing the attention of all the heroes. Except for Green Lantern, who Hood dropped next to the sack.\u00a0\n\u201cNow we\u2019re wrapped up,\u201d Red Robin said as he approached with Black Bat and Signal trailing him.\u00a0\nBatman sighed.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat. The. Fuck.\u201d Green Lantern glared at them all, but mostly Batman.\u00a0\n\u201cTeamwork exercises.\u201d Nightwing sang at him.\u00a0\n\u201cLet us go, you fucking nightmares.\u201d\nSeven domino masks turned to look at Batman. Bruce crossed his arms because they clearly didn\u2019t need him to defend them. \u201cYou are nightmares.\u201d\u00a0\nThere were various shrugs and grins, because they were self-aware nightmares and proud of the fact.\nDick leaned forward. \u201cNot until you admit we\u2019ve won.\u201d\nGreen Lantern grew red in the face as he drew breath to shout something that would be more effective if he wasn\u2019t tied up with something that looked like a child\u2019s yellow skipping rope. It wasn\u2019t, but one of Bruce\u2019s children had tied tassels to it for the express purpose of pissing Green Lantern off.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Wonder Woman beat Green Lantern to speaking. \u201cWe certainly concede victory. Your teamwork was most excellent.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Superman who raised his cuffed hands in a silent question. It took Bruce a bare moment to realize that all his kids were looking at him again, even Nightwing.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun. Release them.\u201d Bruce was rather proud that he didn\u2019t sigh or pinch the bridge of his nose. Or smile.\n\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Muttered Damian, but Cass and Tim were already setting the League members that needed freeing go, Stephanie following behind to hand out now purple weaponry to their respective owners.\u00a0\nWonder Woman and Superman approached, apparently quite happy to go with the tacit agreement that Green Lantern would be released last.\u00a0\n\u201cI have never seen you fight quite like that, Batman,\u201d said Diana, \u201cnot once over our many years of friendship.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been fighting with him even longer than that,\u201d Dick said from Bruce\u2019s elbow.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Both Flashes popped up at their sides, heralding the crowding of everyone else.\u00a0\n\u201cHow the heck do you all know each other.\u201d Hawkgirl was swinging her mace as she spoke, seemingly not too upset at it being purple.\n\u201cPlease tell me you noticed the bats.\u201d Tim was pinching his nose. \u201cAt least four of us literally have bats emblazoned across our chests. Please tell me one of you noticed that.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Diana, slightly smug.\u00a0\nClark nudged her in the side with his elbow. \u201cHey, I knew first.\u201d\n\u201cOnly cause I gave it to you, Uncle Supes,\u201d Dick said rather fondly.\u00a0\n\u201cSmiling Batman,\u201d Barry muttered at Dick\u2019s expression, apparently ignoring the uncle part completely.\u00a0\n\u201cCalled it!\u201d Wally shouted, beaming as he nudged his own uncle in the ribs.\n\u201cAlright over there, Flashes?\u201d Dick asked.\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re aware that your generation calls you the smiling Batman,\u201d Bruce told his son, quite happy to ignore the way Clark was practically glowing at being called an uncle.\nDick smiled up at him. \u201cYup! Spent like three months trying to decide what to do if they confronted me about it.\u201d\nTim leaned around Jason. \u201cYou were going to gaslight them, right? Deny everything like you were utterly confused about what ever led them to that connection?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah. Much more fun. But they all kept it to whispers behind my back. Like hearing the whispers behind your back wasn\u2019t Day One of Dad\u2019s Bat Training.\u201d\nBruce frowned because that was not Day One of Bat Training.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Dickface. That\u2019s Week Six.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Jason,\u201d Bruce said, because Jason wasn\u2019t wrong.\u00a0\n\u201cJason!?\u201d Bruce tilted his head as he realized several of his children\u2019s voices had been in that mix.\u00a0\n\u201cYes? I thought that was the second part of this. Weren\u2019t you making it impossible to hide you existence so you could reveal your identities?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d Nightwing bounced forward, draping himself over Bruce\u2019s back. \u201cHiding made sense when we were still vulnerable and young, but we\u2019re in a good place B. Time to step out of the shadows, just a bit.\u201d\nBruce hummed. But, well, Dick had always been pulling him out of the shadows.\u00a0\nHe turned to the Justice League, absently noting both speedsters practically vibrating and Clark and Diana both smiling at him with a warm softness that seemed all the brighter for the vernal shock the others were still operating under.\u00a0\n\u201cDad\u2019s Bat Training. Batman is a father. He has children.\u201d Oliver said to Dinah in what was probably supped to be a whisper. He turned to Roy. \u201cWait, please tell me you didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d Roy said, glaring at an unrepentant Dick\n\u201cThis is my oldest,\u201d Bruce started, ignoring them all, \u201cDick Grayson. He\u2019s an acrobatic barnacle.\u201d\u00a0\nJason and Tim both snorted, the older outright cackling, but Bruce could feel his oldest beam as he tightened his arms.\u00a0\n\u201cB adopted me when I was a kid after I watched my birth parents die. I started young, but B saved me. And I saved him.\u201d\n\u201cRobin.\u201d All heads turned to a soft-eyed Wonder Woman who was looked between Nightwing and Damian with the R on his chest. \u201cWe thought he was a myth, a false legend. Particularly when a Robin appeared with the Titans and denied all connection to Gotham. But he was your son.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe was. The League was still new and I didn\u2019t trust you yet. Not with him.\u201d\n\u201cRobin became a mantle.\u201d Dick smile, warmth genuine and not bladed as it had been for the last few weeks. \u201cJay had it for a while, then Tim, Steph, and now Damian.\u201d\n\u201cI only had it for coverage purposes!\u201d Steph piped up.\n\u201cStill counts,\u201d everyone else said, excepting Damian.\nDamian crossed his arms. \u201cTt. You should take pride in your part of the esteemed legacy of Robin.\u201d\nDick let out a coo that made several of the heroes, probably ones he\u2019d kicked in the head, flinch. He released Bruce in order to pounce on Damian with a hug the boy might have escaped if it wasn\u2019t for Steph joining in.\u00a0\nBruce sighed, but there was a fondness there that he knew Diana at least had caught. \u201cJason Todd, known as Red Hood, is my third eldest, but the second adopted.\u201d\n\u201cI stole the tires off the Batmobile,\u201d Jason told the room with a smirk as he removed his hood and mask.\n\u201cTimothy Drake, known as Red Robin, discovered our identities and was adopted shortly after.\u201d\n\u201cWe had to deal with his parents first!\u201d Chirped Dick to general alarm.\u00a0\nTim side-eyed his brother before taking off his own mask and addressing the assembled heroes. \u201cI helped. They just signed over custody. Not like they really cared one way or another.\u201d\u00a0\nJason ruffled his hair and Duke patted him on the arm.\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Bruce continued, \u201cthe current Robin, is both an Al Ghul and a Wayne. He\u2019s the youngest and the only one biologically mine.\u201d\n\u201cThe Blood Son!\u201d Every single one of his children chorused with varying tones. Damian scoffed but didn\u2019t throw off Dick or Steph, even as Dick gently peeled away the boy\u2019s domino.\u00a0\n\u201cStephanie Brown, currently known as Spoiler, isn\u2019t legally mine-\u201c\n\u201cJust spiritually and financially!\u201d The girl thew in.\n\u201c-and was an independent vigilante until Tim befriended her and brought her into the family.\u201d\n\u201cNo take backs.\u201d Tim and Dick agreed with a high-five over a giggling Steph\u2019s head.\u00a0\n\u201cDuke Thomas, known as the Signal, is our newest addition. He\u2019s the only exception to the no metas in Gotham rule.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Duke told the Justice League, who looked a little awed at his manners. Duke must have seen that however, because he promptly ruined it after removing his mask. \u201cI\u2019m new, but I promise my initiation was very thorough.\u201d\u00a0\nThis time Dick and Jason exchanged grins that had Garth taking a step behind a flabbergasted Arthur.\nThere was a moment of silence before Diana grinned. \u201cAnd the last?\u201d\nHeads started turning as most of them realized there had been another. Cass dropped down from the ceiling next to Bruce, completely silent, startling a few others into retreating steps.\u00a0\n\u201cCassandra Cain, known as Black Bat. She\u2019s my second eldest.\u201d\nCass patted his cheek before going to lean on Tim.\u00a0\n\u201cBut,\u201d Bruce cut off a grinning Clark, \u201cthe last is actually Oracle, formally Batgirl.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Barry said. \u201cI thought Signal was the only other meta. Is Oracle invisible?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Barbara\u2019s voice came clearly through the speaker system. \u201cBarbara Gordon, at your service.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s our tech goddess and you should always do as she says,\u201d Tim told the League earnestly.\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Oracle,\u201d chorused every Titan in the room to the amusement of a grinning Nightwing.\u00a0\n\u201cTitans,\u201d she acknowledged.\nDick shrugged as the League turned to him. \u201cBabs and I are best friends and the original Bats. She\u2019s never physically met the Titans but I wasn\u2019t about to lead a team she wasn\u2019t part of.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t if you tried, Boy Blunder.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Dick agreed happily.\u00a0\n\u201cSo all this was to fucking introduce yourselves? To get Daddy Bats to spill your names to your friends?\u201d Hal asked, not sounding particularly pleased as a glob of paint rolled off his suit and puddled onto the floor. He had still not been handed back his ring and Bruce wasn\u2019t even sure which child had it. Jason wasn\u2019t currently smug enough to still have it in his possession.\u00a0\nHal didn\u2019t notice each of the kids tense, but the other heroes certainly did.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cass said.\n\u201cThis was because you insulted Batman,\u201d Tim continued.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s our job.\u201d Jason leaned onto Tim\u2019s shoulder.\nDick stepped forward, the others fanning out loosely behind him, not quite threatening but explicitly supportive.\u00a0\n\u201cYou fucked up,\u201d he told the Justice League. \u201cYou messed up a mission and instead of talking about it like adults, or even like the teenagers I\u2019ve trained, you took it out on one of your senior members. One of your friends.\u201d\nThere was shifting feet and downward glances.\nDick stepped forward again and Bruce was absently impressed that Hal didn\u2019t step back.\u00a0\n\u201cBatman is abrasive, authoritarian, reticent, secretive, and kind. He\u2019s given more to this team than you can possibly understand and I sat there and watched you ignore his input, blame him for following a plan you all agreed upon, and insult his every effort. Batman has worked with partners before the Justice League took down it\u2019s first mugger, and, though I\u2019m not sure you caught this with your selective hearing, he adopted a bunch of baby vigilantes to make sure we were safe and prepared and never alone.\u201d\nNightwing took another step forward, his demeanour still and sharp even as he didn\u2019t reach for a weapon. Not that he had to, what with six highly-trained and possibly trigger-happy siblings at his back.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Green Lantern. This wasn\u2019t an introduction, it was a threat. Get your act together or we\u2019re taking him back.\u201d\nNightwing stared at Hal for a long moment, making sure that the man had nothing to say. When Dick clapped his hands together and tossed Hal\u2019s ring back, three different heroes jumped, to the snickers of the Batfamily and sympathetic looks of the Titans.\n\u201cNot that we want that outcome. We\u2019re just so happy that B has friends!\u201d\nBruce was too busy staring to refute that comment with his usual disdain. His children had just threatened, effectively, the entire Justice League. He was slightly put out but also very proud.\u00a0\nTim was nodding. \u201cAlso. Agent A has prepared cookies, if anyone want to join us at the Manor.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you do,\u201d Dick told the Titans, \u201cbecause those are the cookies that you lot once literally destroyed a floor of the Tower over.\u201d\n\u201cAgent A?\u201d J\u2019onn asked, coming closer from where he\u2019d, quite intelligently, been lurking around the edges. \u201cIs there another child?\u201d\nThat actually made each of his children blink for a moment, before bursting out into various chuckles and guffaws. Even Damian was smirking.\u00a0\n\u201cAgent A is my father,\u201d Bruce explained.\n\u201cWe would be honoured to meet you father.\u201d Diana clapped Bruce on his shoulder before linking their arms. \u201cI look forward to seeing your home and learning more about your wondrous children.\u201d\n\u201cWait a fucking second!\u201d Oliver yelled, Dinah\u2019s hand on his arm. All heads turned to him and he pointed at Bruce. \u201cBruce Wayne is Batman?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, you absolute Dickhead,\u201d muttered Roy who\u2019d actually met all the Waynes at one gala or another.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Dick smiled as his siblings fell into even deeper laughter. \u201cGuess we forgot that part.\u201d\nBruce sighed again, but he also smiled as he removed the cowl.\u00a0\n(Bruce would get to write a very detailed status report about how wonderful his children were and make the entire Justice League read each and every page.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nPrivate\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nDick: We\u2019re bringing home guests!\nDick: Mission accomplished.\n\u00a0\nAlfred: Well done, Master Dick.\nAlfred: Very well done, indeed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n(Purple) Heroes of the (Invaded) Tower\n\n\u00a0\nShazam: So if the Rancher King is fake, what happened to the cow?\nShazam: Did she go home?\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: And the Rancher King is fucking fake, right?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: Very fake.\nNightwing: Batcow\u00a0belongs to Robin and is currently getting pampered for her \u2018masterful performance.\u2019\nNightwing: Robin says you can come to the Batcave and visit her, Shazam.\n\u00a0\nShazam: Yes please!\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Batcow.\nBlack Canary: You know what? I don't care. \nBlack Canary: I want to know who does the cleaning.\nBlack Canary: There is glitter everywhere and varying sized holes in the walls.\n\u00a0\nCyborg: Unfortunately,\nCyborg: The losers of the prank war are the ones who clean up.\nCyborg: It\u2019s the Rule.\n\u00a0\nBlack Canary: Great.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Superman: What do the winners do?\n\u00a0\nBatman: Get started on the complete system overhaul.\nBatman: Complete the new training timetables.\nBatman: Type up a detailed structural assessment of the base.\n\u00a0\nFlash: Don\u2019t feel so bad about cleaning now.\n\u00a0\nNightwing: You\u2019re aware that you will be learning the new system, undergoing the training, and modifying the base based on the assessment, yes?\n\u00a0\nFlash: Damnit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGreen Arrow: Why?\nGreen Arrow: Is this the final stage of our punishment?\n\u00a0\nBatman: No.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlash: Um.\nFlash: Translation?\n\u00a0\nNightwing: The long answer is that we whooped your asses and it wasn\u2019t even particularly difficult. The League needs to be better.\u00a0\nNightwing: The short answer?\nNightwing: Batfamily Rules."
