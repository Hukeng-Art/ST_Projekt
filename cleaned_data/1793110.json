    "text": "\u201cLoser does the talking,\u201d Harry says. \nDraco raises his eyebrows. \u201cGo ahead then.\u201d\nHarry scowls. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Malfoy.\u201d\nDraco grins slyly. \u201cAlready did. That\u2019s our problem, or have you forgotten?\u201d\n\u201cI imagine I won\u2019t be able to forget for at least another eighteen years.\u201d\nDraco scowls at him. \u201cI give you six months until you change your tune there, Potter,\u201d he mutters.\nHarry looks at him askance, momentarily baffled. They usually don\u2019t go six months between shag fests. More like two. Lately, it\u2019s been closer to a few days apart, here and there. Harry\u2019s never been sure if that means anything or if their mutual dwindling of \u2018serious\u2019 romantic partners has just pushed them closer together more frequently because they\u2019re fucking lonely. \nIt\u2019s just that Harry\u2019s never been the type to get lonely. He doesn\u2019t miss people. But sometimes, he misses Draco. The annoying twat. He shrugs it off and slaps down another card. It explodes. Fuck. \nDraco smirks at him, leaning back against his chair and crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cShall we Floo to my parents\u2019 or your Weasleys\u2019 place first?\u201d\n\u201cI despise you,\u201d Harry mutters, without heat. Then, to himself, he adds: \u201cHow did this happen to me? I\u2019m a good person. I do good things and I\u2019m nice and I usually only ever forget Hermione\u2019s birthday once a year.\u201d (Typically, on September 19th) \n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with my parents then, my dear good person,\u201d Draco says, rolling his eyes.\nHarry meets his eyes again, feeling his skin tighten with the uncomfortable crawl of dread. He\u2019s an Auror, for fuck\u2019s sake; it\u2019s not like Lucius or Narcissa could do anything to him if he told them he\u2019d knocked their son up...but the thing is, when the Malfoys find out, that means that the Weasleys will be shortly following. And what if they don\u2019t like it? What if they can\u2019t get past Draco\u2019s past? What if they make him choose between them and Draco and his baby? \nIt makes Harry want to vomit. \nThey\u2019ve only known about this pregnancy for three weeks, and it\u2019s really fucking weird and there\u2019ve been like four cases of male pregnancy without taking a strict fertility potions regimen in the history of the world ever, and of course Harry\u2019s got to be an active party to case number five, and he\u2019s never really thought he\u2019d ever be a dad at all, much less with Draco, who is surprisingly copacetic about the whole thing and the fact that it will legally and sort of familially tie him to Harry for the rest of their sodding lives, not to mention probably give him stretch marks, and also Harry\u2019s surprisingly copacetic as well, and\u2014 \nHe\u2019s run-on-sentencing again. In his own head. It\u2019s not uncommon when he\u2019s thinking about Draco. There are just so many things to think about Draco at any given time, and if he spared an individual sentence for each one of them, he\u2019d...well, he\u2019d have a lot of sentences.\n\u201cMaybe we should wait.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cUntil when?\u201d\n\u201cAnother month or so?\u201d Harry suggests hopefully.\nDraco wrinkles his nose, but Harry knows he\u2019s dreading his parents finding out just as much as Harry is the Weasleys, so he considers it. After a moment, Draco huffs. \u201cAlright, Harry.\u201d Harry grins. Then Draco says, \u201cBut my hormones are ridiculous. Come fuck me. No wait, I want to fuck you before I get too fat.\u201d\n\u201cBest day ever,\u201d Harry says, standing right up. He doesn\u2019t have to go talk to Mummy and Daddy Malfoy today and he\u2019s getting laid. Draco pushes away from the table, pulling his shirt off as he turns and saunters into the bedroom. The look he gives Harry over his shoulder is one hundred per cent slaggy, and Harry is all about being a slag for Draco. \nHe\u2019s just not too keen on telling the Weasleys what a slag for Draco he is. But there\u2019s always next month.\n\n-x-\nFour weeks and three hours later, Harry\u2019s misconception is corrected.\n\u201cMother caught me as I was walking by the Floo and I couldn\u2019t get out of dinner,\u201d Draco says when Harry walks in from a weekend shift to find him tying a cravat in front of the mirror. \u201cI told her I\u2019m bringing a guest. Don\u2019t forget you lost.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s good mood at the sight of Draco in a prissy necktie (his favourite thing, basically) quickly evaporates like a Weasleys\u2019 Portable Oasis. \u201cDamn it, really?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid so,\u201d Draco says. \nHarry scowls and tries to distract him by snuggling up against Draco\u2019s back and wrapping his arms around him. He\u2019s three months along now and barely showing; you still can\u2019t tell when he\u2019s wearing what he refers to as his \u2018weekend slumming robes\u2019 but when he\u2019s walking around in one of Harry\u2019s tight t-shirts, it\u2019s starting to look like he has a little belly and Harry thinks it\u2019s incredibly adorable. He presses his palms over the small curve of Draco\u2019s stomach and props his head on Draco\u2019s shoulder, eyes closing as he tries to feel for something. He knows it\u2019s too soon, but it\u2019s just so fucking amazing that this could happen and, Merlin, some days Harry really wishes he could tell Ron and Hermione. \nBut of course he can tell them. He could\u2019ve told them two months ago when he and Draco first found out, or a month ago, when he lost that game of Snap and the subsequent bet that went with it. Draco\u2019s okay with everyone finding out about their strange almost-not-quite relationship\u2014well, okay is probably not the right word. But he\u2019s contentedly resigned to the fact that Weasleys will, one day, know that he regularly has sex with Harry. And has done on and off for three years now.\nAnd content is such a strange word to think of Draco. Out in the world, he\u2019s known for being a first-class prick (and he is) but Harry is, apparently, attracted to first-class pricks and sometimes it\u2019s hard to reconcile the Draco that shacks up with him here three nights out of seven with the Draco who works with Susan Bones and Pansy Parkinson\u2014all together affectionately referred to as the \u201cBitch Battalion\u201d by their employer, the editor of the Daily Prophet.\n\u201cMaybe you could just write a story on it,\u201d Harry suggests. \u201cSexy and merciless (male) senior political reporter somehow impregnated by Harry Potter, no doubt due to Potter\u2019s strange and unceasing ability to be a walking Murphy\u2019s Law.\u201d\nDraco scoffs. \u201cPlease don\u2019t flatter yourself. Also, you\u2019re awful at headlines. And you\u2019re still telling my parents. You lost.\u201d\nHarry grunts and rubs his hands slowly up and down Draco\u2019s stomach until he lets go of the cravat and sinks back against Harry\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I sort of almost like your mum these days and I don\u2019t want her to hate me again.\u201d\nDraco huffs out a laugh. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be delighted to tell my father, though.\u201d\n\u201cI would\u2019ve been if I could\u2019ve done it anywhere but the Manor. Will you rescue me if he invokes ancient Malfoy magic and traps me in a looking glass or something?\u201d\n\u201cDepends on if the looking glass he puts you in matches my furniture or not.\u201d\n\u201cHow will I support you and baby Potter if I can\u2019t go to work?\u201d\n\u201cBaby Malfoy,\u201d Draco says, scowling. He then turns around to scowl more directly. \u201cI carry, I claim as heir. You want an heir, you can damn well carry one.\u201d\nThis is pretty reasonable, but Harry likes to bring it up every chance he can anyway. Because it pisses Draco off. Harry grins, leans in to kiss him. He\u2019s half a mind to undo the cravat so he can watch Draco do it again, but then he feels something hard pressing against his thigh and decides on another course of action. Not at all intended to be a diversion.\nHarry sinks to his knees, neatly pushing aside Draco\u2019s robes to finger the laces of his trousers. Draco\u2019s breathing speeds up as Harry looks up at him over the curve of his belly. It should be weird, and Harry admits he\u2019s still getting used to the idea, but it\u2019s so fucking hot to think that part of him and part of Draco are making something brand new, that their magic is so sodding compatible that they created life without even the need for potions. \nHe unlaces Draco\u2019s trousers and slowly tugs the flies apart, grinning as Draco\u2019s cock springs free. Draco\u2019s face is intent, his eyes focused on Harry\u2019s mouth, his breath coming in shallow little huffs. Harry licks his lips and Draco\u2019s stomach clenches, his fingers thread into Harry\u2019s hair and tighten.\n\u201cWant it?\u201d Harry asks, running his nose along the shaft.\nDraco\u2019s fingers tighten again before moving down and back up again, petting Harry restlessly. \u201cYeah, do it. Come on, suck me.\u201d\nHarry likes the way he says that, so he does. At great length. By the time Draco\u2019s thighs are tensing and his head is dropping back, Harry\u2019s got a rhythm going that he wouldn\u2019t mind continuing for the rest of the night. But then Draco whispers, \u201cFuck, Harry, yeah,\u201d and Harry whines deep in his throat, suddenly desperate to get off. He reaches down and clumsily unzips his own jeans, pulling his cock out and jerking himself in time with the bobs of his head. He adores it when Draco uses his name. The sound of it\u2019s brought Harry to orgasm on more than one occasion, generally with Draco\u2019s cock up his arse at the same time, but this, having Draco in his mouth and the taste of his precome slicking up Harry\u2019s mouth gets him there just as fast. He feels his balls tightening and then the hot splash of come inside his palm as he closes his hand around the head and rubs. He whines again, dragging Draco\u2019s hips closer with his free hand and then Draco gasps and breathes his name again as hot come spills into Harry\u2019s mouth. \nThere are worse ways to prepare for a visit to one\u2019s almost-not-really in-laws.\n\n-x-\nHarry will absolutely not be salting anything tonight.\n\u201cSo, Mr Potter,\u201d Narcissa says. \u201cDraco tells me that you often work together. Do you think a career in politics is in your future?\u201d\n\u201cFuck, no,\u201d Harry says before he can think better of it. He hears Draco choke next to him and panic rises in his chest before he can comprehend that he\u2019s just swallowed his water wrong. Harry quickly pats him on the back and thinks, \u2018Come on Potter, don\u2019t accidentally kill your child, you moronic mouthpiece.\u2019 Draco glares up at him, eyes watering as he gets his breathing back under control.\n\u201cSit down, Harry,\u201d he mutters, but he\u2019s fighting a smile. \nHarry obeys and only then glances up to see the matching looks of scrutiny on Mummy and Daddy Malfoy. Harry clears his throat. \u201cSorry about that. I\u2019m a product of my upbringing,\u201d he says, which he suspects will endear him to them because there\u2019s nothing a Malfoy likes better than the bourgeoisie knowing their place.\nIt works. Lucius smirks and Narcissa\u2019s eyes crinkle, and the rest of the dinner isn\u2019t so bad, except for the part where they make it all the way to the end, and Harry still hasn\u2019t told them that Draco\u2019s pregnant.\n\n-x-\nAnd Draco hasn\u2019t kicked him out yet. Which is really weird because Draco usually kicks him out after a week max. Usually on a Sunday, when he has dinner with his parents. But lately, Harry\u2019s been to every one of those dinners, and somehow it\u2019s just happened that he\u2019s gone back to Draco\u2019s after every one of them. It\u2019s a really good thing that he doesn\u2019t have a pet because he totally would\u2019ve forgotten to feed it by now what with all the kinky, hormone-fueled sex Draco\u2019s been demanding non-stop. \nHarry\u2019s awful at this responsibility thing; he should probably never be a par\u2014\nOh, fuck.\n\n-x-\nBut here he is, and here the Healer is, pointing his wand excitedly at a hologram projected above Draco\u2019s abdomen.\n\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d \nThat\u2019s what Draco had said when the very same Healer came back with the initial test results that told them that Draco wasn\u2019t sicking up all week because of a late season flu going around the Ministry (and by default, the press who slink about there). \nDraco says it again now because it\u2019s equally appropriate. Harry has, once again, dragged him into one of those \u2018only happens in late-night WWN stories\u2019 circumstances.\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Harry repeats, head tilted sideways. \u201cWhat.\u201d He can\u2019t even quite make it into a question. That\u2019s how gone he is.\nThe Healer points to some weird, squishy area and then to another weird, squishy area. \u201cGirls.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what a vagina looks like?\u201d Draco asks, leaning up on his elbows to get a closer look. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re odd,\u201d Harry says absently, and the Healer seems to agree. He twirls his wand and the hologram spins, and then, wow, fuck, there are two heads. Fortunately on two separate bodies. Then, \u201cHave you really never seen one before?\u201d\nDraco gives him a pointed side-eye. \u201cI\u2019m gay, idiot.\u201d\nHarry shrugs. \u201cJust thought you might\u2019ve, I don\u2019t know, experimented.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Draco says. \u201cWith men.\u201d He turns back to the Healer then and says, \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed here, Healer Gaelan. I told Potter if he wanted an heir he had to carry it himself and now you\u2019re telling me that, yet again, he gets something for free just because he\u2019s a lucky son of a witch.\u201d\nHarry nods to confirm this when Healer Gaelan looks uncomfortably in his direction. \u201cI used to fight against it, but now I just accept it.\u201d He scoots his chair closer to the bed, and takes up Draco\u2019s hand, interlacing their fingers. \u201cThanks for the freebie, babe.\u201d\nDraco grunts and lets himself drop back against the bed. \u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he grunts, sarcasm dripping from his voice. \nBy the time they get out of St Mungo\u2019s, Harry happily staring at the little printout of their amoeba-like offspring swimming around in Draco\u2019s belly, he feels like he could do anything.\n\u201cI guess now\u2019s as good a time as any to tell our families,\u201d Draco says. \nExcept that. \nHe and Lucius are starting to develop this mutual loathing thing that\u2019s really working for Harry. Harry still hasn\u2019t salted any of the food he\u2019s served at the Malfoys\u2019, but he suspects that one day it\u2019ll only be coated in a strong emetic and not professional grade arsenic. They\u2019re getting somewhere comfortable, like they could spend a week-long holiday in the same country and probably both make it home alive afterwards.\nSo he\u2019s not exactly keen on the fact that he\u2019ll have to shortly tell the man that he\u2019s knocked his son up. With twins. Of which both are girls. And Draco\u2019s already said one can be a Potter.\nIt\u2019s just that he values his life and would at least like to see his daughters born before their grandparents put a hit on him.\n\n-x-\nSo the following Saturday, Harry tells Molly he\u2019s bringing a guest to the weekly Weasley Weekend Unwind, as Arthur likes to call it. Then he tells Draco that he\u2019s going to be a guest at the Weasley Weekend Unwind. \n\u201cShould I wear a tie?\u201d Draco asks.\n\u201cNo, save it for tonight and our headboard,\u201d Harry says. He tosses Draco a pair of jeans and a t-shirt that says Cuddly Chudley in bright orange script. Draco eyes it distastefully, but when Harry adds, \u201cI\u2019ll lube up and ride you for an hour if you wear it,\u201d he slips it right on. Draco\u2019s belly\u2019s getting big quickly, but it\u2019s not too big to fuck Harry yet. In public, it\u2019s softened by the glamour he puts on when he\u2019s going into work or the shops. It can\u2019t cover all of it, but it makes it look like he\u2019s just getting pudgy instead of carrying two additional humans.\nMolly\u2019s not the least bit surprised when Harry shows up with Draco, which is unexpected. \u201cOh, hello there, dear. I wondered if we\u2019d ever get to meet you. Ron tells me that you and Harry work together all the time.\u201d\n\u201cHe tips me off on his corrupted superiors,\u201d Draco confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbiotic relationship.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does Harry get out of it then?\u201d Hermione asks, sipping a glass of red wine as she leans against the kitchen counter. Harry and Draco give her identical hunted looks, but she only says, \u201cIf it\u2019s symbiotic, he\u2019s getting something out of it, too.\u201d\n\u201cA headache, probably,\u201d Ron says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always get when Malfoy or Bones shows up at my office.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2019s really good at, er...\u201d Fellatio? Backwards Cowgirl? Morning sex? \n\u201cPainting,\u201d Harry finally decides, sending Draco a confused look as though to say, \u2018What is wrong with me, where do I get these ideas?\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s helping me restore Grimmauld.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Hermione says. \u201cBe sure to use a proper spell to get rid of all that lead paint. I worry about bringing Rose over. She\u2019d probably eat the paint chips all over the floor.\nLead paint? Harry thinks, panicking. He can\u2019t bring his daughters into a place full of lead paint, and they\u2019re probably going to have to move there eventually because Draco\u2019s flat\u2019s just a studio. There\u2019s no way four of them can live there together. Grimmauld\u2019s got six bedrooms and a garden. It\u2019s definitely the better idea but if there\u2019s lead paint and, oh god, there\u2019s probably asbestos in the fucking drywall or\u2014 \n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re finally settling down,\u201d Molly says, startling Harry even further. Settling down? Do they know? \u201cIt\u2019s not good for a young man to not have a place to put down roots.\u201d\n\u201cOh, erm, yeah,\u201d Harry says. \n\u201cMalfoy you\u2019re getting a bit chunky there, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ron says. \u201cDesk job\u2019s not really working for you.\u201d\nThis is a perfect time to say, \u2018Actually, Draco\u2019s pregnant,\u2019 and Draco seems to think so, too, judging by the look he\u2019s giving Harry. Harry blinks quickly, still thinking of all the potential carcinogens in the only house they own between the two of them that isn\u2019t a studio or inhabited by Malfoys. He says nothing.\n\u201cRonald!\u201d Molly says, at the same time as Hermione smacks the back of his head. Draco delivers a scathing, yet still somehow polite enough for a Weasley Weekend, rejoinder and life continues apace. \nHarry doesn\u2019t know where the time goes. He eats mechanically, only half paying attention to the taste of his food or the happy conversation going on around him. By the time everyone\u2019s heading for the Floo and Draco\u2019s eyes are drooping from exhaustion, Harry still hasn\u2019t said anything about his new membership into the Dad Club. \nBut Merlin, the lead paint. He\u2019s gotta fix that shit.\n\n-x-\n\u201cAre you nesting?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry says.\nDraco walks further into the drawing room, being careful to avoid splatters of paint on the carpeting, which Harry had not bothered to cover since he\u2019s just going to rip it up. In fact, maybe he should\u2019ve ripped it up first, except then he\u2019d have had to cover the hardwood floors. Whatever. \n\u201cYou,\u201d Draco says, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re nesting. You\u2019re not even the pregnant one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nesting? Like a bird? I\u2019m not a bird.\u201d\n\u201cSame thing,\u201d Draco says. \u201cYou really want us all to live here when they\u2019re born?\u201d\nThis feels like an important moment. Harry slowly bends down to set his paint roller on the tray before standing again. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d Harry asks.\nDraco rolls his eyes. \u201cI was going to start looking for a new flat next week. I\u2019ve already contacted my estate agent about putting mine on the market, but really, there\u2019re so few decent places in the city, and I refuse to live outside of London again. My parents are welcome to their idyllic pastoral retirements, but I\u2019ve spent enough time in Wiltshire.\u201d\n\u201cGrimmauld\u2019s in London,\u201d Harry says.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Draco says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never really talked about what we\u2019re going to do now that, well.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI know.\u201d They stare at one another for a moment past intimate and Harry gets this feeling in the pit of his stomach that he often does when Draco looks at him intently. \n\u201cLast night was the first night you haven\u2019t slept at my place in two months,\u201d Draco says. \n\u201cIt sucked,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep without you. I\u2019ve been painting for about eighteen hours. Before that, I was Banishing lead paint from the house. Did you know that getting rid of lead paint requires a special regulation Banishment spell? It has to go to specific containment centres or the Ministry\u2019ll fine you like a thousand galleons for public endangerment. And there were two Boggarts in the upstairs Floo\u2014no wonder it hasn\u2019t worked in years, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Draco says. \nHarry stops rambling. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking that maybe we should try this thing without the breaks in between the shagging. I thought you were thinking the same thing, but then you didn\u2019t come home last night, and\u2026Was I wrong?\u201d\nHome. Harry swallows. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong,\u201d he says. \nA beat passes, and then Draco smiles at him. That little secret smile he saves for Harry because the rest of the world gets his Bitch Battalion sneer instead. Harry\u2019s breath leaves his lungs in a great whoosh, leaving his legs wobbly and his head dazed. God, he loves that smile. He takes two decisive steps forwards and bends to wrap his arms around Draco\u2019s thighs, ignoring his squawking at the paint all over his robes. He lifts Draco up and carries him up the stairs to the bedroom he hasn\u2019t slept in in six weeks. \n\u201cGod, you\u2019re heavy,\u201d Harry mutters at the tenth step.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Draco says before bending to kiss Harry. They wobble on the steps briefly, not because Draco\u2019s heavy but because he makes Harry\u2019s legs weak. Harry groans into the kiss and takes them the rest of the way up. He didn\u2019t come home last night not because he wasn\u2019t at Draco\u2019s flat, but because he wasn\u2019t with Draco. It doesn\u2019t matter where they live, it just matters that they live together.\n\n-x-\nAnd now Draco is kicking him out. Of his own house. Well, it\u2019s sort of theirs since Harry\u2019s added him to the deed, but really. He was here first. \n\u201cI mean it!\u201d Draco says, face a blotchy red. It\u2019s strangely endearing; reminds Harry of the flush he gets when he\u2019s about to come, only this time he\u2019s been crying. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\u201cBut, babe,\u201d Harry says, \u201cCome on. I didn\u2019t mean to. It was an accident.\u201d\nDraco sniffs. \u201cIntention is irrelevant. You destroyed it. Destroyed us.\u201d\nThat\u2019s taking it a bit far, in Harry\u2019s estimation. It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue to say \u2018It was just a sodding shirt,\u2019 but of course he\u2019s smarter than that. Barely. \u201cI thought it was just reds you couldn\u2019t wash with other things,\u201d he tries.\nDraco snarls at him and throws the formerly white (now orange) shirt at Harry. It hits his face and flops to the floor. \u201cOrange is a derivative of red, you fuckwit!\u201d\nHarry groans, Merlin fuck it makes him hot when Draco uses toffy words in the same sentence as swears. He can feel himself hardening and would really love nothing more than to pull both their cocks out, summon a tubful of olive oil from the kitchen, and just rub their bodies together endlessly, or at least until they\u2019ve come three or four times. He likes the feel of Draco\u2019s belly between them nearly as much as he liked the firm flatness it\u2019d been before. Actually, maybe he likes it just as much, now that he thinks about it. Maybe he\u2014\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco snarls, and Harry realises he\u2019s unconsciously taken several steps forward and started grinding his dick against Draco\u2019s hip. \n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you three of them,\u201d Harry says. Draco sniffs. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll toss the Chudley Cannons shirt,\u201d he adds enticingly. Draco relaxes a little bit.\n\u201cCan I burn it instead?\u201d he asks, sniffling.\nHarry nuzzles his nose into Draco\u2019s neck, inhaling the delicious masculine scent of him. \u201cYeah, babe. Anything you want. Just come down to the kitchen with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Draco asks suspiciously.\nHarry grabs his hand and begins tugging him towards the basement stairs. \u201cOlive oil,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that big table,\u201d he adds, piecing together a plan even as they begin to descend. \u201cAnd then you naked for the next three or four hours. Maybe more.\u201d\nDraco snorts, but by his decreased resistance, Harry can tell he\u2019s intrigued by the idea. Good. After three years, he\u2019s finally learned how to appease an overset Draco. He really has no idea what he\u2019ll do about toddler tantrums, but they certainly won\u2019t be resolved anything like what he\u2019s about to do to his man. He wrinkles his nose at the unintended thought. Gross.\n\n-x-\nThey\u2019re in a press conference at the Ministry when Harry sees him clutch his stomach and stagger against a wall. Harry\u2019s down from the podium and at Draco\u2019s side so quickly he\u2019s not entirely convinced he didn\u2019t Apparate.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispers quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nDraco grimaces. He falls against Harry, letting Harry support his weight, and at that point, Harry knows there\u2019s no way this can\u2019t be an emergency. The Bitch Battalion do not show weakness in public.\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Harry says, reasonably panicking. \u201cFuck fuck fuck, oh Merlin fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco says, panting. \u201cOnly\u2014I\u2014fuck you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not loud, but they\u2019ve got so much attention on them now that Harry knows the few gasps that rise up near them have heard correctly. Draco\u2019s glamour\u2019s starting to fail, his belly shimmering like a mirage in front of the illusion it usually is in public, but Harry really could not give even half a fuck at this point. He bends to slide his arms under Draco\u2019s back and thighs, lifts him up, and sprints for the Floos like his life depends on it. Because it does. The man he\u2014\n\nFuck\u2014\n\nThe man he loves is going into labour two weeks early and Harry will not let anything happen to him or their daughters.\n\n-x-\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Draco grits out.\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Harry soothes, brushing his hand over Draco\u2019s forehead. \n\u201cYou\u2014first\u2014loser,\u201d Draco growls at him between pants. His contractions are coming really quickly now, much more quickly than Harry\u2019s given to understand happens for Muggles. Healer Gaelan is standing over the bed, running diagnostics entirely too slowly. \n\u201cThey\u2019re early but well-developed. I\u2019m confident that if we deliver now both babies will be perfectly fine. Early labour\u2019s not uncommon in male pregnancies. We\u2019ll begin the extraction in, oh, about twenty minutes,\u201d Healer Gaelan says, entirely unmoved by Draco\u2019s death glare. \nHarry, on the other hand, is very much moved by it. He grabs the front of Healer Gaelan\u2019s robes, jerks him forward, and hisses, \u201cYou will begin the extraction now or I will destroy you.\u201d\nHealer Gaelan nods once, shoots a shaky Patronus into the corridor behind them, and a dozen Mediwizards and Mediwitches rush in. Harry gives Gaelan a final warning glance, and then returns to his post beside Draco, to stoically suffer the systematic crushing of each of his metacarpals.\n\n-x-\nGrudgingly, Draco agrees that they can each name their own heir. They look just alike\u2014both with blonde hair and indeterminate eye colour\u2014so there\u2019s no point in picking based on familial resemblance. Draco claims the one that came out first, but he can\u2019t stop staring at either of them. Neither can Harry, really.\nHarry smiles down at Twin Two. \u201cLily James Potter,\u201d he decides.\n\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Draco says, slumping back against the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s just a child. She doesn\u2019t need to be saddled with all of your baggage. She hasn\u2019t done anything to deserve it yet. Save this emotional guilt trip for when she\u2019s coming home from sixth year engaged to a Hufflepuff.\u201d\n\u201cWe can call her LJ,\u201d Harry adds, unmoved.\nDraco glares at him, and then, slowly, smirks. \u201cFine. Then mine\u2019ll be Narcissa Lucius Malfoy.\u201d\nHarry gapes. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! Your dad\u2019s a murderous arsehole with a rap sheet and those names don\u2019t even flow well. It\u2019s too many syllables!\u201d \n\u201cWe can call her Narcius or maybe Lucissa. Which do you like better?\u201d\n\u201cI like the one not related at all to your parents better.\u201d\n\u201cSalazina?\u201d Draco asks innocently.\n\u201cGodrica?\u201d Harry counters, eyebrows raised.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give them names that won\u2019t get them beat up?\u201d a voice suggests from the doorway, and they both freeze. \nHarry watches Draco\u2019s eyes widen, his body stiffen, and slowly, Harry turns towards the door of Draco\u2019s room. He feels his face drain of blood. Ron is there, eyebrows still raised in query after his suggestion, and next to him, Hermione has Rose, who is sucking fiercely on a dummy, propped on one hip. But, even worse, behind them stand the Malfoys, who look too shocked to even speak.\nHermione is the first one to recover. \u201cOh, Harry,\u201d she says, handing Rose off to Ron and gliding forward into the room. \nShe bends down and wraps her arms around him. Still bemused, terrified, and startled, Harry hugs her back on autopilot. He hears her sniff and then feels little drops of wetness hit his neck. He wrinkles his nose. Just then, Ron sets Rose on the cosy chair by the door and steps forward to intercept. Because he is an amazing best mate.\n\u201cHerm, let the man breathe,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just become a dad.\u201d\n\u201cI know!\u201d Hermione wails, and hugs Harry even harder before launching herself off him and bending over the bed to\u2014carefully\u2014hug Draco as well. Draco stares at Harry in horror over her head, awkwardly patting her on the back and trying to keep Twin One from getting a face full of hair in the meantime. \nFinally, she stands again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d she says, sniffling. \n\u201cYeah, really,\u201d Ron adds. \u201cWhat the fuck, Harry? How come I had to hear it from Dawlish that you and Gitfoy\u2019d Floo\u2019d off to St Mungo\u2019s in a panic?\u201d\n\u201cAnd why,\u201d Lucius finally grits out, his voice low and menacing, \u201cdid your mother and I have to learn from the fuc\u2014damned Family Tapestry that you have an heir?\u201d\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Draco says faintly. He turns to Harry, grimacing. \u201cI forgot an alarm sounded whenever there\u2019s a new Malfoy.\u201d\n\u201cWe were going to tell you,\u201d Harry says. Draco shoots him a sharp glare. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Harry says. \u201cWe had a bet and everything. I lost, by the way, so I was supposed to say something every time we came over for dinner but I\u2026\u201d he trails off, shrugging.\n\u201cChickened out,\u201d Draco supplies.\nHarry tosses a glare over his shoulder at him. \u201cYou would\u2019ve, too, Slytherin.\u201d \nDraco shrugs in response, bringing Twin One up to his chest and holding her tightly. Twin Two starts making tiny little baby whimpers and Harry then proceeds to ignore everyone else in the room so he can properly freak out. \n\u201cHealer, help!\u201d he calls and a Mediwitch rushes into the room, wand out. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong!\u201d Harry says. \u201cShe\u2019s in pain or something.\u201d\nThe Mediwitch takes Twin Two from him and then rolls her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s hungry, Mr Potter. I\u2019ll send a Mediwitch in with formula to teach you both how to feed them.\u201d\nWhen she leaves again, Ron snickers. Harry sends him a dark look but it only makes Ron laugh harder. \u201cSee if I make you godfather,\u201d Harry says.\nRon shakes his head, still grinning. \n\u201cWhat will you name them?\u201d Narcissa asks then. She pauses delicately. \u201cI do hope not Narcius, darling,\u201d she adds to Draco. \n\u201cOr Lucissa,\u201d Lucius adds, looking close to vomiting. \nDraco shrugs. \u201cWe should probably think about it for a week or so. Baby Malfoy\u2019s good for now.\u201d He looks between the two of them and then shrugs. \u201cActually, we\u2019ll probably get them confused before we even leave the hospital so we could just stick to One of Two Daughters for the both of them until we work out and identification method.\u201d\n\u201cMum\u2019s convinced that the baby that she originally named George ended up being called Fred his entire life,\u201d Ron adds.\nHermione laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure they had something to do with that.\u201d Then, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just put a bracelet on them that says Baby Malfoy and Baby Potter?\u201d\n\u201cSo obvious and yet so effective,\u201d Harry muses. He taps his wand to Two of Two\u2019s wrist and a bracelet materialises declaring the same. He repeats it on One of Two. Draco sends him that smile, that same smile he\u2019s never used in public before. Harry melts so hard that he\u2019s almost afraid of dropping Baby Potter. \nWhen he\u2019s aware of the world outside of Draco and his daughters again, he realises that the room\u2019s cleared out, and it\u2019s just the four of them again. Draco moves over, silently offering half of the hospital bed for Harry and Baby Potter. Carefully, Harry manoeuvers himself up, wary of jostling either of their babies. It\u2019s amazing how those strange amoebas turned into these. (Secretly, Harry hopes one of them ends up a Hufflepuff, just to annoy Draco. )\nDraco lays his head on Harry\u2019s shoulder and closes his eyes, exhausted. When the Mediwitch returns with two bottles full of formula, he opens them again to feed Baby Malfoy. Harry likes the feel of his head on Harry\u2019s shoulder as their daughters eat on their chests. He likes the feel of being a dad. He likes the feel of doing it with Draco.\n\u201cI love you, you know,\u201d he says quietly. \nHe feels Draco stiffen for just a second. \u201cI,\u201d Draco says, and for a moment, Harry\u2019s terrified he\u2019s not going to say anything in return. \nBut they\u2019ve been together for three sodding years. Even the breaks in between never had anyone else, not for Harry, and he\u2019s almost positive not for Draco. They were formality breaks. To declare that they \u201cweren\u2019t serious\u201d. Which was bollocks. Part of him thinks he even knew that back then, in the first year. Whether enemies, friends, or lovers, he and Draco have never been \u201cnot serious\u201d. They\u2019ve always done everything to the max. \n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Draco finally says.\n\u201cI love that we did this together,\u201d Harry adds, his heart swelling. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it with anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, Harry,\u201d Draco whispers after a moment. There\u2019s a telltale hitch in his breath. \u201cMy hormones are still fucked up. You can\u2019t say shit like that. You have to stop being so amazing.\u201d\nHarry smirks, reaches out to run his fingers through Baby Potter\u2019s blonde hair. \u201cYou first, loser.\u201d\n\nTHE END."
