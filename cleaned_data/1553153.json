    "text": "Peter\u2019s first mistake was getting drunk enough at Tony\u2019s party to take off his shirt and dance on the table. He can\u2019t even remember which table it was exactly, but he has his suspicion that it was the long one with all the food on it. The guacamole he finds on his socks the next morning is sort of a dead giveaway.\nHis memories from the night are fuzzy, but he\u2019s pretty sure he saw Jessica filming it. He\u2019s going to have to have a talk with her later, spider to spider.\nHis second mistake had been refusing to stay over in one of the swanky rooms Tony had prepared for anyone who, like Peter, had consumed a little too much tequila.\nTo be fair, he had only left because walking around a corner and seeing Tony on his knees in front of Steve had made getting some fresh air very necessary. He\u2019s surprised he hadn\u2019t puked honestly, and he still can\u2019t remember it without a shudder. It was like walking in on your parents getting it on.\nWalking home had seemed easier than having to look either of them in the eye if they decided to rejoin the party. Besides, the weather was nice and Peter loved New York at night.\nHis third mistake was trying to fight Deadpool when he had suddenly appeared (the man has a talent for showing up at the worst times), especially when he kept making him laugh by narrating their actions like they were in a Pokemon battle.\n\u201cSpidey uses web. It\u2019s super effective!\u201d\nLaughing and stumbling and punching had turned into a ridiculous slap fight which seemed to please Wade to no end. He\u2019d threatened to pull Peter\u2019s hair and bite him if he tried playing dirty, and had howled at whatever garbled reply Peter had managed. At least he thinks he responded, it\u2019s all a bit hazy. They had twirled, locked in their epic battle until Peter had felt they were getting too close to the busy street for comfort.\nWhen he had shoved him against an alley wall, and had found the other man surprisingly hard beneath him his brain was too busy drowning in alcohol to stop him from pressing their lips together hard through Deadpool\u2019s mask.\nAnd that had led to his fourth and biggest mistake. He could now officially cross enthusiastically making out with a mercenary in a dirty alley off of his Top Twenty Most Shameful Moments list.\nNo, he didn\u2019t have sex with him, as tempting as the idea had suddenly seemed. He blamed it on beer-goggles and the fact that Tequila is very very evil that their sloppy make out had lasted as long as it did, and that he hadn\u2019t been too repulsed by the scar tissue he could feel beneath the thin spandex.\nThe fact that he had enough presence of mind to roll up the mask for better access and had proceeded to rut against him like a horny teenager was a bit harder to excuse, but he was really very drunk and hadn\u2019t had sex in way too long.\nThankfully he hadn\u2019t been quite drunk enough to do too much more than kissing. He had pushed himself away desperately before anything else could happen, mumbled something vague and stumbled drunkenly home to take care of the weirdest boner he had ever had in his life. Thankfully Deadpool hadn\u2019t followed. He\u2019s not sure what might have happened if he had.\nThe whole thing seems like a dream in the morning as he stumbles from the bathroom to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water. His head is pounding, he smells like a brewery and his shirt is on backwards, but none of that matters in the face of the memory of Deadpool\u2019s hands roaming up under said shirt and his mouth sliding slick against his own.\nHe takes two Advil and stumbles back to bed with an agonized groan. Alcohol is clearly the devil and must be avoided at all costs. Tequila must be extra strong he thinks dreamily in the shadowed space between sleeping and awake, because he falls asleep still imagining the feeling of Deadpool\u2019s body pressed against his own.\n\u2026\u2026.\nPeter manages to avoid the merc for a month after that little disaster.\nAt first he had been worried that the news of their encounter would spread like wildfire, fuelled by Deadpool\u2019s inability to shut up, but he was pleasantly surprised that the man hadn\u2019t run his mouth off about it to anyone. Which was sort of sad come to think of it, considering the table dancing video had already made its rounds through every superhero he knew.\nRunning into the mercenary again had been awkward to say the least.\nIt probably wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if they had been fighting a common enemy, or even fighting each other, but running into him at a grocery store is the height of uncomfortable.\nIt was odd seeing the man in full red and black spandex piling a cart full of Oreos and Doritos. He had never really considered the fact that he, like everyone else, had to buy his food somewhere.\n\u201cHey, Petey! How\u2019s it hangin\u2019?\u201d Wade yelled excitedly, scandalizing an elderly lady who had shuffled away muttering angrily about costumed menaces. It\u2019s people like Wade who give him his all that bad press he thinks, a tad unfairly. He blames his typical Parker luck that Deadpool had caught him before he could get away to hide behind the stack of macaroni on sale (though he did take a second to grab a few boxes).\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s good. How are things with you?\u201d\nThis was the worst kind of awkward, like running into an acquaintance from high school and realizing that you don\u2019t even remember their name. Or that you made out with them once, and that you can still remember exactly what it felt like to have their tongue shoved carelessly into your mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m awesome. About to have an epic Golden Girls marathon,\u201d he bounces excitedly as he speaks. Peter wonders how exactly someone so violent can get so damn excited about a bunch of old ladies, though he does have to admit that Blanche is hilarious.\n\u201cYou wanna join me?\u201d he asks with a huge smile. Peter can\u2019t think of much he\u2019d rather do less.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon we can make a day of it! Get some sexy cougar lovin\u2019, eat some junkfood, trade increasingly homoerotic quips that in no way reflect the fact that I\u2019d secretly like to tap that ass like a maple tree, and- am I saying all this out loud again?\u201d He asks with a semi-worried glance around.\nPeter takes a step back, a look of horror etched onto his face. \u201cI\u2019m- uh, you know what, I\u2019d really rather not.\u201d\nIt was fascinating; he hadn\u2019t seen someone\u2019s face fall so fast since he\u2019d had to tell Logan the fridge was out of beer.\n\u201cOh. Gotcha. Too busy superheroing and stuff right? No biggie, I can appreciate my alone time with the goddess Bea,\u201d he chattered, snapping back into his careless routine with ease. Only it had never really occurred to Peter before that it might be a routine instead of the man\u2019s natural annoying state.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not on duty,\u201d he said, wondering why the hell he\u2019s so attuned to the other man\u2019s body language as he notes the slight slump of Wade\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Wade nodded philosophically. The disappointed tone was really kind of sad. Peter curses himself for rubbing it in. He could have just gone with that excuse instead of being a dick. He usually isn\u2019t so vindictive, but he\u2019s been harbouring a lot of resentment about the weird kissing-induced desire he occasionally feels now whenever he thinks of the insane mercenary.\nPeter bit his lip. Don\u2019t do it. C\u2019mon Parker you are almost in the clear, you don\u2019t have to be a nice guy now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I have to take these groceries home, and do a few things. But, I could come over later if you\u2019re not doing anything?\u201d\nDamn it.\nWade flashes him a thousand kilowatt smile. \u201cSweet! Spiderman at my house! How cool is that!\u201d he cheers, as Peter shushes him before the entire store learns his secret identity.\n\u201cJust\u2026 here,\u201d he digs in his pocket, finding a pen. \u201cWrite where you live on here.\u201d Peter passes the pen and his shopping list to the grinning merc. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking agreeing to this, but Wade has proved himself time and time again, so Peter thinks it\u2019s about time he gave the other man a chance.\nWade hands him back the paper with his address scrawled messily down the side. He\u2019s also added KY Jelly and a turkey baster to the list, but Peter would really rather not ask. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need more Doritos,\u201d Wade muses, shovelling a few more bags into his cart with glee.\n\u201cOkay, see you in a few hours,\u201d Peter says, already dreading it. He hopes beyond hope that this doesn\u2019t turn out to be mistake number five.\n\u2026\u2026.\nHe only manages to wait two hours.\nTwo gruelling hours during which he had considered the pros and cons of simply not showing up. He probably would have called and cancelled if Deadpool had given him his number, but he doesn\u2019t quite have the heart to try calling 1-800-DED-POOL.\nHe had finally figured that getting it over with was probably his best option, and had slipped on his coat and shoes, locking his apartment behind him with a sigh.\nWade\u2019s house is a dump, but that\u2019s what he had been expecting really, so gathering all of his courage he marches up to the door and knocks politely, trying not to squirm nervously.\nTwenty seconds, two ominous banging sounds and a stream of loud and inventive curse words later Wade yanks the door open with a flourish smiling widely.\n\u201cPete! You actually came! No I know, I can\u2019t believe it either! Come in, come in!\u201d Peter glances behind him to see who he\u2019s talking to, but Wade grabs him firmly by the shoulders, half-dragging him into what Peter believes might become his torture chamber for the next few hours.\nAs far as torture chambers go, it\u2019s actually kind of nice.\nThere\u2019s a heap of dirty dishes piled onto a side table, probably to make room for the two bowls of chips and assortment of chocolate bars laid out on the coffee table. The couch is large and unsurprisingly red, but it looks clean and comfortable enough, and all in all it\u2019s probably only as messy as his own apartment is.\n\u201cUh, nice place,\u201d Peter says as he\u2019s shoved roughly onto the couch.\n\u201cThanks! Oh where are my manners, can I offer you a drink? Some food? A hooker? I got some Snuggie\u2019s too if you want one. \u201d\n\u201cWoah, um just water would be great,\u201d Peter says quickly, trying to make himself comfortable. He\u2019s only half convinced that the prostitute thing is a joke, and Wade\u2019s enthusiasm is kind of overwhelming, but at least he returns with water and it\u2019s even in a clean glass, so that\u2019s something.\nDeadpool dives onto the couch and has to do an absurd amount of squirming to get himself straightened out, ending up a little closer to Peter than he\u2019s comfortable with, but their arms are just barely brushing so he can\u2019t exactly demand he move over.\nWatching tv with Wade turns out to be pretty fun. He remains quiet mostly, but occasionally he interrupts the dialogue to shout his own opinions at the screen. When Peter laughs the first time Wade seems surprised, and he proceeds to watch him out of the corner of his eye, his grin growing exponentially each time he makes Peter laugh.\nAt one point he stretches in such an exaggerated manner that Peter thinks he\u2019s about to fall victim to the age old arm over the shoulder move, which makes his heart jump wildly in his chest. Thankfully it doesn\u2019t happen, but the way Wade\u2019s body bends is almost obscene, and Peter flushes guilty as he imagines the sort of things he could do to make Wade arch like that again.\nIt\u2019s at about this point that he begins a mental mantra of \u2018don\u2019t think about sex around Wade, don\u2019t think about sex around Wade.\u2019\nUnfortunately Peter\u2019s mind has grasped onto the subject with glee, and he spends the entire second episode trying in vain to tear his eyes away from Deadpool\u2019s throat as he swallows, having rolled up his mask to stuff Doritos into his mouth.\nIt only gets worse when the man starts licking the cheese off of his gloved fingers. That can\u2019t be sanitary. Who knows where those gloves have been. But even that thought doesn\u2019t make the sight of Wade\u2019s tongue laving at his fingers lose its appeal. And Peter would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t have a thing for gloves. Just the thought of gloved hands sliding over his abs is enough to make Peter decidedly uncomfortable and horribly aroused.\nHe gulps down his water and prays that Wade will stay focused on the television. This is the worst possible time for his sexual frustration to kick into overdrive. As if he wasn\u2019t tense enough before with the prospect of having to discuss their makeout in the alley.\nBut four episodes in it almost seems like the merc has forgotten about their little encounter. Knowing Wade\u2019s mind he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the man thinks he hallucinated it, and it might be awful, but he has no intention of setting him straight if he does.\nPerhaps it\u2019s foolish but Peter allows himself to relax by measures, keeps his eyes glued to the screen, and before long he finds himself fully absorbed in the show and Wade\u2019s ridiculous commentary.\nAnd then Wade starts humming \u201cKiss the Girl\u201d from The Little Mermaid.\nAfter that it\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s in His Kiss,\u201d followed promptly by \u201cRock and Roll All Nite,\u201d which isn\u2019t about kissing, but happens to be by Kiss so Peter manages to grasp the theme.\nThis is ridiculous. He needs to deal with this before Wade runs out of songs and starts just making kissing sounds instead.\n\u201cSo, about that thing\u2026\u201d Peter starts, suddenly garnering Wade\u2019s full attention.\n\u201cThe alley thing?\u201d Wade questions eagerly, not that he really needs to ask.\n\u201cYes. The alley thing. I wanted to say thank you. For not, you know, spreading it around,\u201d Peter says, flushing a bit. Wade grins at him.\n\u201cYeah well, I don\u2019t kiss and tell. Unless you pay me enough. Then I\u2019ll describe every second in detail. I\u2019ll even draw you some pictures if you want.\u201d\nFrom everything he knows about Deadpool Peter can\u2019t understand exactly why he\u2019s been keeping quiet. Wade name drops so often that it\u2019s sometimes hard to get a word in edgewise.\n\u201cSo if someone were to pay you\u2026\u201d Peter asks, only half kidding.\n\u201cFor you Petey, I\u2019d keep my mouth shut,\u201d he chirps sweetly.\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nWade sighs. \u201cOkay, so normally I wouldn\u2019t, but\u2026I mean this is you! The Spider-man. Who would believe me?\u201d\nBizarrely that makes him feel a lot better.\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019m going to trust you then,\u201d he says, trying not to notice how happy his words make the other man.\nHe can\u2019t help but notice however when Wade\u2019s lips are suddenly moving against his own. For a second he returns the kiss, almost forgetting where he is and who he\u2019s with because it feels so good.\nThen his sense kicks back in and his hands come up to grasp Wade\u2019s shoulders and shove him away hard. He bites down on the hysterical impulse to laugh as Wade falls backwards, nearly flipping over the arm of the couch.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d he squeaks, shuffling back away from him along the couch until he hits the opposite armrest, putting a safe amount of space between them.\n\u201cI thought we were having a moment!\u201d Wade exclaims, trying and failing to be subtle as he licks his lips. Peter feels a shudder, and to his horror it isn\u2019t one of revulsion.\n\u201cNo! Not that kind of moment! Jesus Wade.\u201d Peter goes to get up and Wade is upon him in a flash, grabbing his arm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go, we haven\u2019t even finished the season!\u201d\n\u201cYou were humming too loud for me to concentrate anyways,\u201d he huffs. Trying to detach Wade from his arm turns out to be like trying to scrape gum off the bottom of his shoe; difficult and uncomfortably sticky.\n\u201cPete, just sit back down. We don\u2019t even have to take our clothes off if you don\u2019t want to, we can just kiss for a bit\u201d he whines petulantly, tugging hard at the arm in his grasp.\n\u201cOh my God. No. This is not happening. I didn\u2019t even mean to kiss you that night! I don\u2019t know what I was thinking,\u201d he blubbers, using his super-strength to keep from being manhandled onto the couch.\n\u201cBut you were hard,\u201d Wade says knowingly with the barest hint of a leer. The hand on his arm performs an action a lot like a caress that causes goosebumps to erupt over his skin.\n\u201cI was also very very VERY drunk,\u201d Peter flushes but manages to take advantage of the loosened hold and finally tug his arm away.\n\u201cI could get you a beer?\u201d Wade suggests hopefully.\n\u201cNo!\u201d he wails miserably. Maybe if he wishes really hard the ground will swallow him up. Anything would be better than this.\n\u201cYou liked it,\u201d Wade insists, \u201cJust admit it! Listen, a nerd like you can\u2019t be getting all that much action. I mean, you would be if you told chicks you\u2019re Spider-man, but you\u2019ve got some sort of deluded moral code or something. Which is totally cool, I can respect that, but aren\u2019t you just the tiniest bit lonely?\u201d\n\u201cAre you trying to seduce me by insulting me?\u201d he asks incredulously.\n\u201cIs it working?\u201d\nPeter sighs, sinking back down on the couch dejectedly.\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, you got an itch to scratch, and I\u2019m like one of those weird wooden back scratcher thingies. No shame in a bit of male bonding, am I right? What\u2019s so wrong with a handjob between friends, as long as we keep it between us?\u201d Through the mask Wade is grinning, but a bit of his enthusiasm seems to be wearing off to be replaced with a nervous hesitancy.\n\u201cWade, I\u2019m not sleeping with you. I will never sleep with you. Even if I was lonely, which I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not into the whole friends with benefits thing okay?\u201d His voice sounds tired and strained to his own ears. Wade has the uncanny ability to wear him out without even making him move an inch.\nWade\u2019s hand relocates to his thigh insistently. \u201cHow do you know? Have you ever tried it?\u201d The hand makes a few gentle circles which are innocent enough that he decides to let it slide. He\u2019s got to pick his battles after all.\n\u201cI just know Wade,\u201d he sighs. The hand slides up a few inches as Wade leans in closer. He should really do something about that.\n\u201cPete, I\u2019m not above begging,\u201d he admits, and then his lips are inches away.\nTime seems to freeze. He can feel Wade\u2019s breath against his lips; feel the tension between their bodies and the heat as Wade\u2019s hand begins to venture into forbidden territory, kneading firmly just inches away from his cock.\nSurely just one kiss couldn\u2019t hurt\u2026\nHe barely has time to question where that thought came from before Wade\u2019s lips are on his own again.\nThe kiss is soft, and tentative, more of a testing of boundaries than a kiss. It\u2019s almost like Wade thinks he\u2019s about to get punched, and really Peter knows he should do it, punch him or push him away or do something, but he can\u2019t. Not after weeks of dwelling on their earlier make out. Not after a whole month spent guiltily imagining where that make out could have led. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s forbidden that makes it so hot. Maybe it\u2019s that he\u2019s being touched in ways he hasn\u2019t in months, but he can\u2019t bring himself to pull away.\nWade\u2019s tongue brushes his lips and Peter opens his mouth to protest, but suddenly finds his tongue otherwise occupied. But when fingertips brush the bulge in his jeans and he tears his mouth away in panic.\n\u201cWade, n-no wait, Wade we shouldn\u2019t, we can\u2019t- oh shit that was- where did you learn that?\u201d he squeaks in surprise as Wade palms him through his jeans, giving him a firsthand demonstration of exactly how talented his hands can be.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell,\u201d Wade replies cryptically, as he watches Peter tip his head back to bask in the sensational friction of his hand. His mind and body have never been more at odds, with his brain screaming \u2018no\u2019 while his hips lift into the hand that\u2019s busy sending sparks of pleasure through him.\nWhen he looks down Wade looks hungry even through the half pulled up mask, and Peter lets the desire on his face make up his mind.\n\u201cCrap, just this once okay?\u201d Peter breathes, hating himself already for how much he wants this. Wants Wade\u2019s hands, and lips and body touching and pressing against him, stroking and sucking and building into a crescendo of heat and the promise of ultimate gratification.\n\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d Wade demands, and Peter rushes to comply, almost falling off of the couch in his haste.\n\u201cYour couch is too small. Bedroom.\u201d Peter stands up to rid himself fully of his shirt and pants even as Wade slips his own clothing off, cautiously as if he expects Peter to bolt.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he urges, and that seems to snap Wade out of it. He shucks his clothes hastily, though his mask remains on, and presses his naked body up against Peter\u2019s, making them moan in tandem at the intimate contact.\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d Wade breathes. It almost sounds like a question, so Peter slams their mouths together to lick away any hesitation Wade might be feeling.\nIf coming over had been mistake number five, this was surely mistake number six, but damn did it feel good.\nThey reach the bed and Peter pushes Wade down, watching happily as the other man spreads himself out, waiting for Peter to join him.\nHe doesn\u2019t have to wait too long. Peter knows if he waits his brain will catch up and demand he leave, and he\u2019s too close to the glorious promise of another person touching him to want to stop, even if that person is Wade Wilson.\nCrawling up onto the bed he takes a second to inspect Wade\u2019s body. The scars are frightening up this close, standing out stark and red against the paleness of the unmarred sections of skin. He isn\u2019t repulsed exactly, but they look like they hurt and he can\u2019t help but feel sort of sad for Wade, having to live with such an inescapable and obvious reminder of his painful past.\nHe touches one on Wade\u2019s stomach running a finger along the line of it, and takes it as a good sign that Wade barely flinches. He does squirm uncomfortably though, so Peter directs his attention to the line of his cock standing at attention just a few inches below where his fingers rest. Despite the scars it looks fairly standard, a bit bigger than his but not all that much different when it comes down to it.\nHe cups his balls and Wade makes an enchanting whining sound.\n\u201cHuh. No hair. You\u2019re like a porn star,\u201d Peter says enraptured.\n\u201cYeah sure. I bet Freddy Kruger stars in everyone\u2019s wet dreams,\u201d Wade mutters darkly.\nPeter promptly shuts his mouth. Having sex with Wade is like walking through a minefield, and he\u2019s starting to worry he won\u2019t make it out unscathed.\n\u201cAre we gonna get going here, or have I turned you off?\u201d Wade snarls. Clearly too much looking and not enough touching has made him nervous.\n\u201cDoes it feel like I\u2019m turned off?\u201d he asks, pressing himself against Wade\u2019s thigh while he slides back up his body. The friction is amazing, made even better by the strange texture of Wade\u2019s skin and the way he groans as Peter\u2019s cock finally touches his own.\nWhen they start to move it\u2019s rough, almost animalistic, and nothing like the sex Peter has had up to this point in his life. Sure, he\u2019d had wild sex with a few people before, but Wade is all barely contained chaotic energy, pushing, thrusting, scratching and biting with a ferocity he\u2019s never experienced before. This isn\u2019t making love, or having sex, it\u2019s fucking, and Peter\u2019s surprised to find he loves it.\n\u201cHarder, just like that,\u201d he finds himself shouting as Wade lifts his hips to grind their cocks together. It\u2019s embarrassing, like he\u2019s a teenager emulating every porno he\u2019s ever seen, but he can\u2019t stop it, and he sort of doesn\u2019t want to. Especially when Wade is growling things like \u201cThat\u2019s right Peter, scream for me. I knew you\u2019d be great, but fuck you\u2019re amazing. Please\u2026\u201d It gives him a heady sense of power to make the other man just as starved for this as he is.\nHe considers closing his eyes to imagine it\u2019s someone else touching him, but the feeling of scars makes that almost impossible and besides, Peter isn\u2019t going to stoop quite that low. And Wade Wilson naked is actually quite an impressive sight, all slick with sweat and muscular, and in constant motion as he writhes beneath him.\nDespite the fact that Wade is like a hurricane in bed, Peter finds himself taking the lead, his hand closing around both of their erections to jerk them off together. Wade pants, making needy whimpering sounds with each laboured breath. His body is hot beneath Peter\u2019s, like he\u2019s burning up, and they slide against each other, kissing so frantically that his lips feel bruised and he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to have teeth marks on them for a week.\nWade comes with a groan and a whisper that sounds suspiciously like \u2018thank you\u2019 and Peter follows soon after, coming despite himself and freezing up as he becomes painfully aware of every point where their skin comes in contact.\nThey rest for a while, with Wade\u2019s arm thrown around him, as he rests his forehead against Peter\u2019s shoulder so he can feel his breath on his skin. Predictably, Wade starts jabbering before Peter has even caught his breath.\n\u201cThat was great! You\u2019re fantastic Pete, has anyone ever told you that? You deserve like a medal or something for being a grade A lay,\u201d he chuckles at his own rhyme. Peter shifts awkwardly in his arms.\n\u201cYou want to grab dinner or something?\u201d Wade asks, his arm tightening around him.\n\u201cI- I should probably get going,\u201d Peter says guiltily. Now that the passion has faded the shame and guilt come crashing in. He\u2019s sticky and tired and feels like just about the worst person in the world as Wade\u2019s arms squeeze him one last time before he pulls away.\n\u201cAlright. Well, that was a blast. Guess I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n When he looks at him he sees that Wade is resolutely avoiding eye contact, staring down his bedroom wall like he\u2019s trying to set it on fire with his mind.\n\u201cYeah. You were great,\u201d he says truthfully, taking pity on him. The reassurance seems to work as Wade looks up to meet his eyes finally.\n\u201cBut this can\u2019t happen again,\u201d he tells him seriously, leaving the comfort of the bed to search for his clothes amidst the clutter on the floor.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wade says shrugging. Peter glares at him. Of course he isn\u2019t taking this seriously, but Peter is adamant. Sure it had been good (awesome, fantastic, mind-blowing a voice screams in the back of his mind), but it shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place. No matter how lonely he is, sleeping with Wade Wilson is not the answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious Wade. We can\u2019t do this. Not again,\u201d he repeats. His clothes are in the living room he remembers. Looks like they\u2019re having this conversation naked.\n\u201cI gotcha, one time only deal. Just glad I got in on the action while I could.\u201d Wade sounds more sincere than Peter has ever heard him, and it makes his chest ache a little with some unnamed emotion.\n\u201cOkay, as long as we\u2019re clear\u2026\u201d he says, ducking into the other room and picking up his clothes off the floor.\nWade is still in bed when he comes back in. \u201cCrystal,\u201d Wade says, nuzzling in deeper under the covers, trying to retain some of Peter\u2019s body heat.\nPeter frowns, finally dressed and ready to leave.\n\u201cI\u2019d walk you out, but I\u2019m all warm here so\u2026\u201d Wade trails off expectantly.\n\u201cYeah, okay. Well\u2026 see you around.\u201d\nHe walks through Wade\u2019s silent house timidly; a walk of shame, but not for the usual reasons.\nClosing the front door behind him he takes a moment to lean on it, frowning uncertainly. One of Wade\u2019s neighbours walks past, eyeing him warily, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care.\nIt takes him a moment to realize that it\u2019s the fact that Wade hadn\u2019t been upset that\u2019s bothering him so much. Because who in their right mind would sleep with Deadpool, and if they did how many of them would stick around after the fact?\n How many times must Wade have been left immediately after sex for him to have such practised ease in accepting the treatment? He had almost seemed to expect Peter\u2019s protests, like he was prepared to find out that he wasn\u2019t wanted anymore once he had served his purpose.\nPeter swears, turns around and reopens the door.\nWade looks up at him when he enters the bedroom, clearly startled as evidenced by the gun he has pointing straight at Peter\u2019s chest.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d he asks, lowering the weapon a fraction.\n\u201cYup,\u201d Peter wills him to put the gun down, as it\u2019s new position aimed at his crotch doesn\u2019t exactly make him feel more comfortable.\n\u201cWhat did you forget?\u201d\n\u201cMy brain apparently,\u201d he sighs, marching over to crawl up on the bed and kiss him fiercely. It\u2019s all tongue and teeth and sloppy exaggeration, and the gun clatters to the floor.\n\u201cFuck me this time,\u201d he growls against his lips, biting the bottom one ferociously. Wade moans unabashedly, his body already arching and tensing into Peter\u2019s helpless thrusting.\n\u201cIs this a pity fuck? Because I don\u2019t need your pity,\u201d he gasps as Peter takes his cock in hand.\n\u201cNo. This is\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Just some fun,\u201d Peter says with a one shouldered shrug.\n\u201cOh. Okay cool. I totally would have taken the pity fuck anyways, but that\u2019s good to know,\u201d Wade says, his breath hitching slightly. Peter already knows, so he says nothing, just runs a thumb over the head of his cock.\nMistake number seven, a miserable voice at the back of his mind reminds him. Thankfully the sounds Wade is making sufficiently drown it out.\n\u2026\u2026.\nMistake eight happens the very next day.\nInitially he swears he won\u2019t go back. He\u2019ll lock himself up before he does something as stupid as having sex with Deadpool again. He tells himself the pull he feels to spend just one more hour over at Wade\u2019s is just hormone induced madness, and that he\u2019s Spider-man: he can overcome a few measly hormones no problem.\nBut Wade keeps pulling at him, yanking at the corners of his mind, tugging at his body until he can\u2019t think anymore, and has no choice but to leave the cage his apartment has become to arrive, hesitant and unsure, at Wade\u2019s front door. They collide again, a bittersweet embrace that leaves him utterly satisfied but aching with regret.\nHe doesn\u2019t tell Wade he won\u2019t be back. He hopes it\u2019s evident. This isn\u2019t the kind of relationship he wants, and he most certainly doesn\u2019t want it with Deadpool of all people. He\u2019s pretty sure Wade will understand. Besides, he\u2019s so thrilled about just the three encounters that he\u2019s fit to burst with joy. Peter resolutely ignores what that means about Wade\u2019s expectations about relationships.\nSo it\u2019s with guilty reluctance that he retrieves his pants and says goodbye, hopefully for good.\nHe only holds out for two days after that before mistakes nine, ten and eleven happen in quick succession, on the floor, on the kitchen counter and very very briefly (much to Wade\u2019s chagrin), in the shower.\n\u201cThat almost never happens, I swear!\u201d he protests, burying his face in his hands.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter says, leaning forward to kiss him. He purposefully neglects to mention that it\u2019s more than fine. It\u2019s actually astoundingly hot, and very flattering. He\u2019s not sure how saying something like that would be received and he half expects Wade to bolt if he lets him know how much he wants this.\n\u201cI liked that thing you did just there with your tongue,\u201d he adds, smiling triumphantly when Wade sinks to his knees before him.\n\u201cWhat? This?\u201d Wade asks, wrapping his lips around his cock and sucking on him for a minute, running the flat of his tongue along the length in his mouth before pulling back.\n\u201cOr was it this?\u201d he continues, going down again to flick his tongue against the head of his cock, licking the slit with abandon.\n\u201cBoth are good,\u201d Peter breathes. The warm water cascades against his back as Wade sucks eagerly at front, and he feels like he\u2019s in heaven, or maybe in the sinful indulgence of hell. \u201cBut I was thinking the one where you sort of flicked it like, oh crap, yeah like that!\u201d\nThis time he stays over, lying stiffly in Wade\u2019s bed, barely a whisper away from him. He hadn\u2019t realized just how much he missed sleeping with a warm body next to him, even if that body belongs to Deadpool. They wake up wrapped around each other, and after a chorus of macho throat clearing and masculine posturing Wade makes him breakfast.\n\u201cWell, see you tomorrow,\u201d Peter says reluctantly as he leaves, not noticing Wade\u2019s smile in his hasty retreat. There\u2019s no point in denying he\u2019ll be back anymore, he thinks with a mental sigh, so he might as well be upfront with both himself and Wade.\n\u2026\u2026.\nThey slide easily into a strange sort of friendship outside of the amazing sex. It\u2019s strange but Peter has to acknowledge that they understand each other in a way that others seem to be unable to grasp, and it\u2019s nice to finally have someone who can keep up with Peter\u2019s verbal acrobatics. Wade not only understands all of his references but shoots his own back at him at twice the speed. He hasn\u2019t laughed as hard as he does with Wade in months, possibly years.\nOf course there are many, many downsides to their arrangement, but Peter steadfastly ignores them. Great sex seems to be the key to shutting down his logic, and thus far he hasn\u2019t been able to complain about that part at all.\nHowever, there is one rather enjoyable, if frustrating, downside that he likes to dwell on incessantly, especially when Wade isn\u2019t readily available.\nHe should have seen it coming really. Wade\u2019s ability to keep his mouth shut was bound to have a price attached, and unfortunately for Peter that price appears to be his sanity.\nWade is a tease. Which is hot in the bedroom (or against the wall, under the table, on a desk\u2026) but it\u2019s damn near killing Peter when they happen to be together in public.\nOne night, picking up takeout, his hand slips easily into Peter\u2019s back pocket, grabbing a handful of his ass and squeezing, all while nonchalantly reading out the weirdest things he can find on the menu. By the time the waitress hands them their bag of food Peter is torn between punching Wade in the face and kissing him until neither one of them can breathe. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation.\nWade seems to delight in finding subtle but effective ways to drive Peter absolutely wild no matter who they\u2019re around. All it takes is a few words breathed into his ear, or a gentle touch and Peter is driven half mad with desire. But of course Wade takes it a step further, subtlety never having been his strong point.\nWhen the Avengers are looking for an outside party to cause a distraction Peter mentions Wade with barely a second thought and instantly regrets it as the protests start pouring in.\n\u201cI\u2019m not working with Wilson!\u201d is the general outcry. The entire team protests ardently, but it all comes down to Steve, who solemnly agrees that Deadpool would make the perfect distraction, and so the matter is settled despite mutinous grumblings.\nHe ends up regretting it even more when he discovers that Wade\u2019s devious teasing doesn\u2019t let up even in a professional setting, not that he should have expected the merc to be professional.\nWade\u2019s lips brush the back of Peter\u2019s neck as he reaches behind him to grab a knife off of a table in the conference room of the Avengers mansion. Peter covers up his shiver with an awkward cough and glares at him out of the corner of his eye.\n Barely two minutes later he drops said knife and as he bends down to pick it up he takes the opportunity to run his lips gently along the line of Peter cock, coaxing it to harden mere inches away from the rest of the Avengers. It\u2019s made all the worse by the fact that he can\u2019t bring himself to tell Wade to stop. It\u2019s not just the warm lips, it\u2019s the agonizingly wicked temptation of getting away with it in front of the people he most admires and respects. The thought is beyond tantalizing. A wash of heat and intense fear crashes over him and he has to clench his hands hard to keep from touching himself or hitting Wade as he returns to his seat looking smugly satisfied.\nThey end up holed up in the bathroom down the hall, squeezed into a stall devouring each other and trying to keep their moans down to a minimum.\nAt the restaurant they choose for lunch the heroes stick him and Wade in a booth off to the side, claiming that since Peter brought him in, he gets to babysit Wade as well. Peter makes a show of objecting, but he\u2019s secretly sort of thrilled. He\u2019s starting to find being with Wade far more entertaining than he should. They talk about nothing, trading insults and pop-culture quips fast and free, laughing at each other with their mouths full of food.\nWade\u2019s hand suddenly smacks down on the table with a loud bang.\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d he shouts, earning displeased glances from every other patron in the restaurant.\n He glances up at Peter guilty, with just a hint of mischief gleaming in his eyes. \u201cUh\u2026 spider.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously Wade?\u201d Peter says, frowning.\n\u201cOh shit, sorry\u2026was he one of your people?\u201d The question is posed with feigned regret, but his smile gives him away as he wipes his hand off on his leg.\n\u201cMaybe he was. Let me see,\u201d he leans over to look at the smudge left on the table.\n\u201cOh God\u2026no! H-Harvey! You killed him!\u201d Peter cries dramatically, and Wade doubles over in laughter as over half of the heroes at the other table turn to see what\u2019s wrong.\nPeter lowers his voice self-consciously, \u201cYou know I\u2019m the spider totem right? Joking aside you could stand to be a little nicer to my spiders,\u201d Peter says, patiently forking the peas on Wade\u2019s plate over to his own.\n\u201cYour spiders? Do you own them? Are you in some sort of creepy spidery relationship I don\u2019t know about?\u201d Wade shivers in horror at the thought.\n\u201cI can summon thousands of them at will,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cPlus Harvey and I kind of had a thing.\u201d\nWade guffaws, more out of surprise than anything.\n\u201cYou laugh now, just wait until I send them to attack. Tomorrow you\u2019ll wake up to a swarm of them, scuttling into your mouth, your ears-\u201d\n\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Wade cuts him off, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I get a spider in every orifice?\u201d His leer is truly something to behold.\nPeter blushes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe those words just came out of your mouth,\u201d he says, shaking his head as he takes a drink to hide the smile on his face.\n\u201cHuh. And here I was thinkin\u2019 you\u2019d be a little more interested in what comes in my mouth,\u201d he intones just loud enough that only Peter hears it. He chokes on a mouthful of water, coughing and spluttering as he turns beet red.\n\u201cWoah there Peter, take it slow. That water\u2019s some pretty strong stuff,\u201d Tony calls to him with a guffaw.\nWade\u2019s shit eating grin earns him a slap, and Peter doesn\u2019t let him steal any more fries off of his plate for the rest of the meal to punish him.\nWade had even showed up to the next poker night at Ben\u2019s, citing a long-standing invitation which Ben had grudgingly acknowledged.\n Peter had never played a worse game, but it was nearly impossible to concentrate while Wade\u2019s bare foot (he must have kicked off his shoe) was sliding up his leg to tease gently at his sudden and unexpected erection.\n\u201cI fold,\u201d he chokes, throwing his cards down in defeat and trying not to moan or thrust as Wade begins to rub him steadily through his jeans. His toes curl and Peter swallows hard, praying he doesn\u2019t come in his pants.\n\u201cI bet you do,\u201d Wade replies cheerfully.\nAnd it turns out Peter does, that night back at Wade\u2019s, bent nearly in half with his legs over the other man\u2019s shoulders as he pounds him into the mattress.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me,\u201d Peter tells him afterwards, kissing his shoulder as they snuggle under the blankets. He\u2019s figured out that Wade loves little kisses to his skin while they catch their breath after sex. He always makes these satisfied little hums of appreciation that give Peter a warm feeling in his chest.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d Wade replies, sounding surprisingly serious. He throws an arm around Peter, holding him tightly, and Peter takes so long trying to think of a reply that Wade\u2019s snoring before he can speak a word.\n\u2026\u2026.\nPeter can\u2019t help but keep tabs on every mistake he makes, and he makes a lot of them nowadays.\nHe meets with Wade as often as possible, despite their busy schedules, at all hours of the night and day. It\u2019s funny Peter thinks, that between heroing and his time with Wade he\u2019s never been tied up so much in his life.\nWade never comes to his place, but he calls him and purrs wicked things at him down the line to entice him over to his place. It\u2019s a bit alarming how quickly just a word or two can make him hard, and he often wonders how Wade has become so good so fast at pushing all of his buttons.\nSometimes they eat, or watch tv before they start to kiss and touch, but other days Wade pins him to the wall the moment he steps through the door, or Peter shoves him down onto the table before they have a chance to speak. Clothes are ripped off, or left on while the fuck, just as long as they are touching, and pressing and rutting as hard and fast as they can.\nThe mask is an issue that gets resolved with a lot of pleading and reassurance on Peter\u2019s part and pouting and sulking on Wade\u2019s, but it gets tossed aside more and more easily each visit until Wade begins greeting him with a naked face more often than not. They\u2019ve had sex on almost every surface possible, and some that might not have been possible for someone who didn\u2019t have the balance and sticking powers of a spider.\nOften it\u2019s rough and hurried, each of them pushing the other towards orgasm at dizzying speeds, but strangely enough Wade seems to like it slow better. For a man who spends most of his time jumping around and buzzing with energy like a squirrel on crack, Wade takes a ridiculous amount of delight in the slow agonizing press of his cock into Peter or of Peter slowly working himself into his ass. It\u2019s not making love, but neither is it the brutal fucking that they do so often, and it leaves Peter confused and breathless in more ways than one.\nSometimes, after they\u2019ve touched and licked every inch of each other\u2019s skin until it becomes impossible to stave off orgasm, Peter worries that he likes this too much. He still thinks Wade is one of the most aggravating people he\u2019s ever met, but he\u2019d be lying if he said he didn\u2019t luxuriate in the power he has to make him squirm and pant, and most of all to make him happy.\nWade\u2019s happiness is something he\u2019s started to worry about. The more time he spends with him the more he realizes that Wade\u2019s smiles aren\u2019t as carefree as he used to think. As someone who uses humour to cope with the less pleasant aspects of life he\u2019s sort of surprised he hadn\u2019t caught on earlier, but he\u2019s also spent the bulk of his time trying to avoid alignment with Deadpool and any reminder that he reminds him of himself. Whenever Peter disapproves of him, or suggests ending things Wade seems to shut down. His jokes get more boisterous and his laugh more insistent, but Peter can tell he\u2019s upset.\nHe can go from cocky bastard to complete self-loathing in the blink of an eye, and gets sulky and closed off whenever Peter wants to talk about his past.\nHe also seems to care a lot about what the heroic community thinks of him despite his practised nonchalance.\nOnce, after a particularly exciting battle, they had rushed back to Wade\u2019s together kissing frantically almost as soon as the door closed behind them.\n\u201cDid you see how I shot down that one ship? Talk about being a bamf!\u201d Wade says excitedly while Peter sucks at a the rough flesh of his neck. \u201cCap said he was proud of me! And even that little shit Johnny Storm said I had good aim!\u201d he crows triumphantly.\n\u201cYou did really well,\u201d Peter agrees, and Wade glows with pride.\n\u201cA while ago I heard him saying that I\u2019m a useless waste of space,\u201d he confesses. \u201cSaid the only thing I\u2019m good for is making villains want to turn themselves in rather than hear me talk. Which, you know, is probably true, but a lady has feelings Pete! Feelings that make me want to go all stabby. He\u2019s lucky I had a hangnail that day, otherwise it would have been sayonara Charmander\u2026\u201d\nPeter remembers the incident. He had been there along with some of the other Avengers and Fantastic Four, and he was among the ones who had laughed. He wonders if Wade even remembers he was there.\nHe kisses him to shut him up, and Wade\u2019s lips almost make him forget the stab of guilt he feels for the incident. Sure, he wasn\u2019t the one who said it, but he hadn\u2019t defended Deadpool either. Nobody ever defended Deadpool.\nWade lifts him up and Peter wraps his legs around him with a soft moan. \u201cI made him eat his words today,\u201d Wade says emphatically, sliding a hand between them to rub Peter\u2019s cock languidly through the spandex of his suit. \u201cSaved the widdle fire baby\u2019s life. Plus I punched him in the face \u2018by accident\u2019 in the confusion,\u201d Wade cackles with glee.\nPeter sticks himself to the wall, letting Wade go so that he can bend down and press a kiss against the tented spandex of his outfit.\nBy the time Peter comes, a wet spot forming on the spandex as Wade sucks and rubs at him through the fabric, Wade has talked his way through the entire fight, highlighting his own heroic feats of course, but it\u2019s plain to hear the admiration in his voice as he talks about the other heroes as well.\nPeter realizes with a start that, to Wade they aren\u2019t just a group of heroes, they are actually his heroes.\nHe doesn\u2019t have to wonder what it must feel like to know that your heroes don\u2019t like you or even want you around.\nWade comes, shuddering, and Peter kisses him, feeling a bright smile pressed against his own frowning mouth.\n\u2026\u2026.\nPeter waits at a counter, ignoring the cacophony of sound around him and smiling at his phone.\n'hey sexy, still cumming to my place? ;)'\nHe\u2019d be lying if he said he didn\u2019t love the way that Wade always texts like a teenaged girl. Except the rare occasion when he texts like a serial killer. Peter much prefers teenage girl Wade, especially when he wears his schoolgirl outfit.\nPeter shakes his head and texts him back, telling him he\u2019ll be over after he grabs a coffee. It\u2019s been a long morning and he needs his caffeine fix before he can even think about keeping up with Wade.\n\u201cIs that your girlfriend you\u2019re texting?\u201d the barista asks, handing him his coffee. She\u2019s pretty, with light blonde hair, a soft smile and an ample chest. She\u2019s exactly the kind of girl that sends Peter spiralling back to the awkwardness of his high school days.\n\u201cNo, I- I don\u2019t have a girlfriend,\u201d he sputters, trying not to drop the scalding cup as he reddens under her critical gaze.\n\u201cWell maybe you should ask her out. If she smiles like you just were when she gets your texts I think you\u2019ve got a real chance,\u201d she says with a wink.\n Peter spills his coffee on his hand.\n\u201cShit,\u201d he grabs some napkins to clean up the mess, sighing in relief when the nosey girl turns to serve the next customer.\nHe\u2019ll tell Wade about this later. He can already imagine him howling with laughter, both at the assumption and at Peter\u2019s cringe-worthy reaction. Taking his drink over to an empty table he sets it down, trying to sort himself out and wiping down the dripping sides of his cup. Spidey healing should take care of the minor burn in no time thankfully. Too bad it couldn\u2019t heal his bruised ego as well.\nHis phone buzzes again and he leaves off cleanup duty to check it, making sure to keep his face carefully blank just in case.\n'got a mission taking down a real jackass, you'd be proud. ill call you when im done'\nPeter frowns. He was looking forward to seeing Wade this afternoon. He texts him \u2018Good luck\u2019 and flips his phone shut, sitting down and sipping his coffee slowly. He still doesn\u2019t approve of Wade\u2019s methods, but he\u2019s been trying really hard to keep the killing to a minimum lately so he doesn\u2019t have reason to complain too often. It still bothers him that Wade seems to absolutely love killing and maiming, but he lets it slide. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re dating after all.\nThe coffee shop is busy enough that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about the barista watching him, but he keeps glancing over at her anyways just to make sure. The coffee is too strong, but he doesn\u2019t want to get anywhere near the counter again after spilling all over himself before.\nWade will probably be out for a while knowing how his missions usually go. Maybe he\u2019ll go visit aunt May for a bit, he hasn\u2019t been around to see her in far too long. Phone calls and the occasional email really aren\u2019t enough.\nHe takes his time to finish his drink, checking his emails on his phone and jotting down a few ideas he\u2019s had about his latest project at Horizon on a salvageable napkin. He waves to the girl behind the counter without making eye contact as he heads out the door twenty minutes later.\nHe has his phone in his hand and is just about to dial May\u2019s number when it starts to buzz. Tony Stark\u2019s number, which means there must be trouble.\n\u201cPeter, we need you down here now,\u201d he snaps before Peter can even say hello. He barks out the address and the line goes dead. Peter sighs. \u201cI\u2019m great, thanks for asking. Always a pleasure having these long conversations with you Tony,\u201d he says, earning him strange looks from the people passing by. As if they\u2019ve never seen a man talking to himself on the streets.\nMaybe he is spending too much time with Deadpool.\nOh well, there goes his lazy afternoon.\n He ducks into an alley to change and swings in to work, thankful that he can at least bypass traffic on his commute.\nWhen he arrives the building is blazing, and he can hear screams coming from within. His stomach twists unpleasantly as he surveys the scene. Half of the heroes are locked in battle while the rest of them are escorting civilians to the convoy of ambulances parked a short distance away.\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s the fire?\u201d he asks, wincing at both the inappropriately glib joke and the sound the uniformed man\u2019s head makes as it connects with the pavement. Hydra, he notes, so the whole head wound thing shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but still. He webs him up and rolls him out of the way of the fire rescue crew, who seem intimidated by the heroes and Hydra goons who are locked in battle all around the building.\nHe swings over to where Steve is wrestling a man to the ground. \u201cNeed any help?\u201d he asks, though it\u2019s obvious he has it under control.\nCap shakes his head. \u201cTony hasn\u2019t come out yet,\u201d he says, and Peter is off, swinging in through the glassless window. The room he enters is empty, but he finds two women in the burning hallway who he quickly escorts from the building.\nRushing back in, he makes his way to the back of the apartment, following the sounds of a child crying. Why someone else hasn\u2019t saved a scared kid by now is beyond him, because saving babies is top superhero priority. The poor thing must be terrified.\nPeter coughs, the smoke already burning his throat, and crouches down low, readying himself to grab the kid and get the hell out of the damn inferno before he chokes to death.\nHe isn\u2019t prepared to break down the door and find a familiar figure in black and red staring back at him.\nDeadpool is on fire. And not in a good way. He\u2019s leaning over a screaming toddler, blocking him from the burning beam that crashes down as Peter enters the room, hitting Wade squarely in the back and probably cracking some bones. His clothes have already burned up enough that long stretches of blackened skin are visible.\n\u201cFinally! What took you so long? You know I\u2019m gonna make you stick by your thirty minutes or it\u2019s free policy right?\u201d Wade wheezes half-heartedly.\nThe child is pushed into Peter\u2019s arms before he can even make a sound, but he can\u2019t move. He\u2019s stuck staring at Wade as the flames lick over his body like a lover\u2019s caress.\n\u201cGo!\u201d Deadpool yells, just as his Spider Sense starts ringing alarm bells in his head.\n\u201cWade!\u201d he hears his voice scream as he narrowly avoids more falling debris, cradling the child against his chest. Wade isn\u2019t as lucky and disappears under the rubble, but there\u2019s no time to free him as the building starts crumbling around him in earnest.\nHe races outside, thrusting the child into the arms of a waiting a paramedic and turns around to charge desperately back towards the building, only to be stopped by a metal arm around his waist.\n\u201cSpider-man, everyone\u2019s out,\u201d the mechanized voice says jarringly as Peter struggles against his hold.\n\u201cNo! Wade! He\u2019s still in there!\u201d He breaks free for an instant before Iron Man grabs him again, holding him tightly.\n\u201cWade can heal. You can\u2019t.\u201d he says, though Peter can barely hear him. He had forgotten about the healing factor in the horror of watching Wade\u2019s flesh char and blister from the heat. His panicked mind keeps replaying the image of Wade burning alive, disappearing beneath the flaming wreckage with a silent scream painted onto his mask.\nHe collapses uselessly in the hold, barely keeping his sobs under control. If Iron Man notices he\u2019s crying he\u2019s kind enough not to mention it.\nAfter that events seem to pass in slow motion. It seems like it takes ages for the Fire Department to douse the flames. While they work Tony fills him in on what had happened. It turns out that Wade had happened upon the scene, his job having turned out to be a bust, and had offered to help. Peter barely listens, his listless stare focused on the building as the flames slowly die down.\nTony let\u2019s him go as soon as the fire is contained and he\u2019s off like a shot, wading through the rubble frantically, unable to make a sound though he desperately wants to yell Wade\u2019s name.\nHe finds him exactly where he left him, a withered husk of blackened meat and bone. He barely looks human as Peter gathers what\u2019s left of him gently into his shaking arms.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to do or how long it will take him to heal so, ignoring the shocked and serious faces of the other Avengers, he takes Wade home.\nHe lays the corpse on his bed and rushes to the bathroom, vomiting violently into the toilet. His entire body is shaking, and he smells like fire and something worse, so he strips out of his costume and tosses it into the hallway before returning to the toilet to throw up once more.\nOnce his stomach is empty he lifts himself up off of the floor, running cold water in the sink and washing his face, trying to think of anything other than the charbroiled remains of the man he\u2019s come to care for lying on his bed.\nIt takes him a while to gather up his courage, but once he does he checks in on him every few minutes, noting with a sick sense of fascination the changes each time.\nWade\u2019s grows both arms back the third time he enters the room, but the skin doesn\u2019t grow back fully until the fifth time he checks on him. His ears are back by the sixth time, his lips and most of the skin by the eighth.\nThe tenth time he checks on him Wade is just waking up.\nHe\u2019s hunched in on himself, curled up into a tight ball with his eyes pressed tightly shut. His lips are moving, but the sounds coming from the man are so quiet that it takes Peter a while to realize he\u2019s talking. He thinks he might vomit again when he realizes exactly what it is he\u2019s saying.\nWade Wilson is lying on his bed, curled up, naked and vulnerable, whimpering a steady stream of \u201couch, please, ah, stop, stop, no, please\u201d that hits Peter like a punch from the Hulk, leaving him reeling.\n\u201cWade? Are you okay?\u201d He flinches. What a stupid question. Of course he\u2019s not.\nWade scrambles up into a sitting position, tugging the sheets over him and tacking a smile onto his face with frightening ease.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m missing a few vital parts, sorry to all the ladies out there, and uh, you I guess, but the healing factor\u2019s kicking in just fine. I\u2019ll be restored to my full manly self in a few hours, never fear.\u201d The lines are delivered with a grin and a cheesy wink, making it so easy to believe he\u2019s alright, but Peter knows better. After years of practice he\u2019s become so good at ignoring the pain that his act is seamless, but there\u2019s no way that Peter can block out what he saw in the last few seconds when Wade thought he was alone.\nHis scars have never stood out so starkly, and Peter has never thought they were more beautiful. He takes each one as an affirmation. Wade is alive, Wade can heal, Wade will be okay. He wants to cry, half from relief but mostly because Wade is in pain and there\u2019s nothing he can do.\n\u201cIt- does it\u2026 hurt badly?\u201d he asks.\nWade sobers slightly, the sunny smile dimming. \u201cIt always hurts worse when it\u2019s just growing back,\u201d he says shrugging.\nPeter doesn\u2019t know what to say. How do you respond to something like that? Especially when he\u2019s seen Wade get injured hundreds of times. Shot in the shoulder, shot in the head, victim of multiple stab wounds. Has it always been this painful for him? Shouldn\u2019t he have noticed\u2026\n\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d Wade says, and for a second Peter\u2019s afraid he spoke out loud, but it\u2019s Wade who has filter problems, not him. He must just look as horrified as he feels, because Wade continues, \u201cBurns are a bitch, give me a good old head wound any day. Don\u2019t worry about it Petey, I\u2019m right as rain.\u201d\nHe peers under the sheets and smiles. \u201cSee, even my dick\u2019s grown back! For a minute there I was worried I might be all Ken doll smooth for the rest of my life\u2026\u201d Peter can barely manage a weak chuckle. It\u2019s taking all of his willpower not to grab Wade and squeeze him tight, but he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll hurt him more, and that\u2019s the last thing he wants to do.\n\u201cHow about getting me some clothes huh? Unless you like what you see\u2026\u201d Wade lowers the sheets a bit with a leer. The sight is beautiful, but not because of Wade\u2019s insinuation. He\u2019s just glad to know that there\u2019s skin covering his hipbones again.\nPeter blinks. \u201cOh, right. Clothes. I think I\u2019ve got a few things that should fit,\u201d he says, turning to the closet. When he reaches for a hanger he realizes his hands are shaking.\nHe pulls out a faded red t-shirt that he never wears and a pair of track pants with holes in the knees, handing them to Wade, who has wrapped himself up like a burrito again in the sheets from the bed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says softly, then turns and bolts from the room.\n\u2026\u2026.\nPeter is dreaming.\nHe can tell because there are trees growing in Wade\u2019s apartment. Tall white birch trees, lined up in rows that make Wade\u2019s living room seem more beautiful and serene than he\u2019s ever seen it. Unless Wade has decided to do some really interesting redecorating it has to be a dream.\nWade is sitting on the upper branches of one tree that shouldn\u2019t be able to hold him, wearing a parka and singing like a banshee.\nPeter can\u2019t help but laugh, trailing his hand along the rows of trees as he walks over to him. Even in his dreams Wade is that perfect combination of adorable and astoundingly annoying.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he calls up to him.\nWade\u2019s eyes meet his suddenly, dark and wild with fear. With a sudden jolt of terror Peter realizes the tree is on fire and Wade isn\u2019t singing; he\u2019s screaming.\nHe stands frozen in abject horror, unable to move as he watches while Wade is slowly burned alive. He feels like he\u2019s falling, like his insides are floating up as he plummets downwards, and in a horrific parody of Wade he\u2019s unable to make a sound as he screams until his lungs burst.\nHe wakes up with a start, drenched in sweat with his heart pounding in his throat, to find the merc leaning over him kissing his cheek. He doesn\u2019t know where he is for a panicked moment, before remembering they are curled up on his hide-a-bed couch because the sheets of his bed are dirty. A wave of nausea accompanies the thought of exactly why they\u2019re ruined.\n\u201cYou okay baby boy?\u201d Wade asks with concern, and flinches when Peter throws his arms around him, feeling the reassuring beat of his heart lull his own into a more steady rhythm. Pulling him down onto the bed he buries his face in his collar, trying hard not to sob. That would be even more embarrassing than waking him up because of a nightmare.\nWade doesn\u2019t talk for once, he just lets Peter hold him until he can\u2019t keep his eyes open anymore, even with the threat of flames flickering at the edges of his mind.\n\u2026\u2026.\nAfter the fire Peter starts inviting Wade over more often, until they start spending more time at his place than Wade\u2019s, and they each have a toothbrush at both of their houses.\nTwo months later it\u2019s impossible to keep track of how many \u2018mistakes\u2019 Peter has made. He honestly doesn\u2019t even know if they are mistakes anymore, and whenever he thinks the word it\u2019s accompanied by some really obnoxious airquotes.\n\u201cFuck Pete, harder,\u201d Wade squirms in his position straddling Peter\u2019s chest.\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like a mistake to be sucking Wade off, to feel his fingers driving deep into him as Wade leans forwards, his hands braced on the floor above Peter\u2019s head.\nWade makes one of his happy little sex noises and Peter gets a thrill, goosebumps erupting over every inch of skin. He hums back appreciatively around the length in his mouth and takes a moment to revel in the unrestrained delight of the moment.\nSometimes he can hardly believe this is real. If someone had told him that he\u2019d be having frighteningly monogamous sex with Wade Wilson only a few months ago he would have webbed them up and sent them to an asylum. Now he\u2019s become a necessary habit, something he can\u2019t escape, and he\u2019s not sure he wants to.\nAfter sex he\u2019s going to see if Wade wants to go out for dinner instead of ordering in. Taking Deadpool to restaurants is always an adventure, but they\u2019ve been cooped up inside for too long, and Wade always responds with excitement when Peter asks him to go out.\n\u201cHelloooo earth to Peter,\u201d Wade calls, knocking his knuckles against his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve kinda stopped moving,\u201d he continues defensively in response to Peter\u2019s glare. \u201cI could just keep thrusting but I\u2019m kinda looking for some audience participation here.\u201d\n\u201cMph, Mmm muph mmm,\u201d Peter says authoritatively.\n\u201cOh! Mad Gab! I love this game! Uh, let me guess, is it \u2018oh Wade you\u2019re so handsome and manly and you smell like lemongrass\u2019? No? Damn, I thought I had it.\u201d\nPeter learns firsthand how difficult it is to laugh with a cock in your mouth. Also to breathe. He pulls away to wipe uselessly at the saliva on his chin as he snorts.\nWade doesn\u2019t move, just keeps on chattering. \u201cNever mind, I just remembered I hate this game. I never win. But I did stick a knife through Bob\u2019s hand once when he beat me and that turned out to be pretty fun. Why\u2019d you stop?\u201d\nPeter spares a moment to wish good things for Bob. The poor man deserves a medal judging by the things Wade has boasted about putting him through.\n\u201cI was just thinking we should go out to dinner,\u201d he admits. If Wade thinks it\u2019s strange to be contemplating dinner during a blowjob he doesn\u2019t let on.\n\u201cYou wanna hit up McDonalds or something?\u201d he asks excitedly, visions of Big Macs no doubt dancing merrily through his head.\nPeter eyes his cock sitting hard and tempting right in front of him. Wade makes it hard to concentrate under normal circumstances, but this is a true test of focus. \u201cNah, I was thinking that fancy place downtown. Do you have a suit?\u201d\nWade\u2019s face lights up like an arc reactor at full power. \u201cI can wear my tux!\u201d he crows happily. \u201cThat thing\u2019s helped me almost score with hundreds of women,\u201d he adds with a wink.\nPeter chortles along with him, running his hands up and down his sides, feeling the laughter rumble through his body.\n\u201cOkay, hurry it up, I want steak,\u201d Wade says.\n\u201cThanks Cassanova,\u201d Peter replies, but he goes back to it eagerly anyways.\nRunning his hand up the rough skin of Wade\u2019s side as he thrusts into his mouth, Peter\u2019s fingers dance up his chest, thumb catching on the dip at the base of his throat. He follows a scar back down his chest languishing in the harsh bumps of the scars and tumours that riddle Wade\u2019s body. They don\u2019t bother him anymore, but sometimes he wishes they would disappear for Wade\u2019s sake, so he could stop hating his skin just as much as he seems to hate himself. Peter\u2019s working on that, but it\u2019s slow going, and Wade is too used to self-loathing to give it up cold turkey.\nHe sucks him until he comes, while Wade\u2019s hand works him to completion. Wade hops up off of him, offering a hand up and is sent to start the shower while Peter makes a reservation.\nThis dinner is going to cost him an arm and a leg, but it\u2019s so worth it to see Wade, after their shared shower (no funny business just a quick scrub) looking dapper and halfway respectable in his nicest outfit. It\u2019s accompanied by a clean mask and his gloves of course, but Peter isn\u2019t cruel enough to force him to go without them in public.\n\u201cYou look good,\u201d he says, eyeing the sleek lines of Wade\u2019s body outlined by the dark material. Wade can really pull off a tux. Peter looks down at himself, and sighs. His suit is too big, and his bowtie is a mess, making him feel like a child playing dress up, especially when compared to Wade\u2019s sleek look.\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d Wade says, eyeing him like he thinks Peter is on the menu tonight as well. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not so sure about the tourniquet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s very Marie Antoinette chic, but it might be just a tad too kinky for formal dinner wear.\u201d\nWade steps forward, tugging the fabric from Peter\u2019s hands to tie it into a proper bow with practised ease.\n\u201cHuh, you\u2019re good at that. You make a habit of tying other men\u2019s ties?\u201d he asks with a sly grin.\n\u201cYou jealous?\u201d Wade shoots back with a wink and a kiss, and then he\u2019s out the door.\nPeter smiles wider and shakes his head fondly, closing and locking the door behind him. You can dress Wade up, but you can\u2019t take him anywhere he thinks as the man cartwheels down the hallway just because he can. Maybe it\u2019s a mistake to bring him out, but Wade is so happy that Peter can hardly bring himself to care.\n\u2026\u2026.\nIt\u2019s only a week later that Peter realizes he is well and truly screwed. He\u2019s stretched out on his bed, lying on top of the twisted nest of his sheets, and wondering what the hell he\u2019s doing.\nThis is wrong.\nHe shouldn\u2019t be having casual sex with a scarred, insane mercenary who doesn\u2019t know how to shut up. He shouldn\u2019t be craving the taste of him, the firm thickness of his cock in his hand, or in his mouth, or filling him up so completely he can barely stand the pleasure.\nHe shouldn\u2019t long for him so much it\u2019s like an ache in his body. He shouldn\u2019t be touching himself to the thought of him, imagining him moaning and laughing and begging as he strokes himself to orgasm.\nHe most certainly shouldn\u2019t be wondering what he\u2019s doing, when he\u2019ll see him next, and how long his job will keep him away this time. He shouldn\u2019t be worried about him. But he is.\nHe decides to add one more mistake to the long abandoned list. His newest mistake is caring for Wade, and wanting him for more than just casual sex.\nHe\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s falling in love with Deadpool, and it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\n But he\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t glad that it had.\nMost of the Avengers know by now. It was inevitable that they would start to notice his absences, his inability to provide an alibi, and the way he tended to rush off at odd times to see Wade, but it was the dopey smiles that had really given him away.\nThere aren\u2019t many things more frightening than being cornered by a group of women with superpowers demanding you tell them who the lucky girl is. On the other hand there\u2019s not much funnier than watching their faces when they realize you weren\u2019t kidding when you told them it\u2019s Deadpool. Carol had looked positively scandalized\u2026 and maybe a little bit ill.\nWhen it had gotten around to some of the others Tony had hunted him down and told him he was insane. Luke Cage agreed and Cap had given him one of his famous speeches, reminding him that Deadpool was dangerous and volatile, and saying he hoped he was being careful. It was almost sweet though, especially when Steve had asked him if they were happy together. He hadn\u2019t had the heart to tell him that they weren\u2019t technically dating.\nExcept that they sort of are. Peter isn\u2019t sure, but he thinks they might have been dating from the very beginning, but they\u2019ve both been too stupid to see it.\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but we\u2019re sort of dating,\u201d Peter says that night as they snuggle on the couch, because he\u2019s a huge dork and no matter how hard he tries he can think of a more eloquent way to bring it up.\nWade makes an alarming sound, and for a second Peter\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to freak out and punch him. Wade may be engaging in gay sex almost every day, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from firmly asserting his heterosexuality every time he lets slip the slightest indication of attraction to a man.\nThe sound is just a tiny squeak at first, but it soon builds into a wailing screech that a boiling kettle would be jealous of. He also flaps his arms wildly like he\u2019s trying to achieve liftoff, unsettling Peter from his position tucked under his arm.\n\u201cI told you guys!!\u201d he cheers when the girly screeching stops.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks, uncovering his ears with a grimace and shuffling to get comfortable without the heat of Wade\u2019s body against his.\n\u201cNot talking to you,\u201d Wade replies flippantly, doing a little jig around the coffee table. \u201cI hardly believe it either!\u201d he continues with another girlish squeal. Peter waits it out, having learned long ago to let it go when Wade starts talking to himself.\n\u201cDoes this mean we get to hold hands and you\u2019ll buy me dinner, and presents, and take me to the movies and kiss me gently?\u201d\nPeter almost doesn\u2019t answer until he realizes the words are finally being directed at him.\n\u201cWe already do all that,\u201d he says patiently. Wade stares at him hard.\n\u201cWhen was the last time you got me a present?\u201d he asks accusingly.\n\u201cI gave you those stupid little Spider-man and Deadpool bobble heads. The ones you keep putting in lewd positions on the dresser.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, forgot about those,\u201d Wade says, but his fond smile only lasts momentarily. \u201cBut you never buy me flowers, or lingerie or those little penis shaped chocolates that I like,\u201d he grumbles.\n\u201cDo you even like flowers?\u201d\nWade glares at him. \u201cOkay, no. But I like lingerie and penis chocolate. Would it kill you to pop into Victoria\u2019s Secret once in a while?\u201d he persists.\nPeter kisses him and pulls him back down onto the couch. \u201cFine, if you\u2019re going to keep whining about it I\u2019ll buy you something pretty. Pick out whatever you want, as lacy or frilly or slutty as you can find.\u201d\nWade squeals again and flings his arms around him, practically vibrating in excitement.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you something too,\u201d he says happily. \u201cHow do you feel about big sparkly dildos?\u201d\n\u2026\u2026.\nThe door slams so hard against the wall that a picture frame plunges to its death, smashing spectacularly on the floor. If he were in a better mood he\u2019d give it a ten out of ten for execution.\nHe\u2019s not in a better mood.\nPeter cusses and stomps over to grab the broom from the closet. It\u2019s like everything is out to get him today.\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel like that when you\u2019ve spent the entire day hearing almost everyone you know slander your boyfriend. One or two jokes Peter could let slide, because Wade is a pain and he knows that. He\u2019s painfully aware of the fact, having spent the majority of his time with the man for well over a year now.\nBut when the jokes keep coming, and the abuse keeps piling on it\u2019s hard to keep his cool. Today he \u2018d heard all about it from heroes, from villains, even from his non-super friends, and it was all he could do not to web all of them up and use them as particularly squirmy punching bags.\nAt the very least his spectacular exit from the Avengers tower, in which he had broken an automatic door by slamming it closed, had made it abundantly clear that he wasn\u2019t happy. When Peter throws a hissy fit he makes it impressive.\nWorse than the teasing is the fact that he knows if things had been different, if it was someone else dating Wade, he would have happily joined in. In fact, he\u2019d probably have been the main perpetrator of the jokes. He\u2019s actually crafted a few that far surpass the ones directed at him today.\nThe fact that they would have come more from spite than any sort of affection is even worse. There\u2019s a difference between insulting Wade, secure in the fact that he loves him, and what he\u2019s had to deal with today.\nHe sighs guiltily. Maybe he\u2019s being a hypocrite. And maybe he should apologize for the nastiness he\u2019s directed at Wade in the past.\nSaying sorry however, is a tricky business. He could come right out and say it, own up to his shame (there\u2019s a lot of it) and lay it all out, but knowing Wade he\u2019ll laugh in his face, cover his metaphorical wounds with his own special brand of humour and avoid the topic until Peter stops trying.\nBut maybe just showing Wade how much he means to him will be enough. Peter dumps the broken glass in the garbage and heads back out to buy some supplies.\n\u2026\u2026.\nWhen Wade arrives home there\u2019s a bouquet of weapons by the door. That\u2019s not just an expression either. The guns and blades are tied together with a red bow and have been arranged in a large glass vase on a side table that has been moved so it sits in the middle of the floor.\nHe pokes at it warily, admiring a cluster of wicked looking throwing knives before he notices the note sitting innocuously beside the vase.\n\u201cWade, you said you didn\u2019t like flowers, so I had to improvise. Follow the \u2018rose petals\u2019 to find me. Love Peter\u201d\nWade looks around, blinks and then bursts into laughter.\n The floor is strewn with little packets of Taco Bell hotsauce which form a trail through the house that leads to his bedroom, where he assumes Peter is waiting.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a chick flick,\u201d he simpers, shucking his weapons onto the couch. Bedroom means sexy times, and that means no weapons unless Peter pre-approves them. They\u2019ve had that fight already, no point in pushing his luck when the night is looking so promising.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the girl Wade!\u201d a voice calls from the bedroom.\n\u201cOnly because your legs look fat in a dress,\u201d he replies, yanking open the door.\nThe pyromaniac in him dances for joy at the sheer amount of candles covering every surface. Peter sure has gotten over his brief aversion to flames. Maybe it\u2019s some sort of \u2018face your fears\u2019 thing, but Wade digs it, especially when the candles illuminate Peter wearing his very favourite skinny jeans, the ones that make his ass look spectacular, and a Deadpool t-shirt.\n\u201cLove the flowers by the way. But I\u2019m noticing a sever lack of penis chocolate slash lingerie here\u2026 unless you\u2019re wearing it under your clothes?\u201d\nThe hopeful note doesn\u2019t escape Peter\u2019s notice, but he chooses to ignore it in favour of standing up and marching forward to plant a kiss worthy of the Notebook on Wade\u2019s lips. Okay, maybe not quite as grand but it\u2019s at least better than Twilight. Possibly more along the lines of 27 Dresses. Not that he\u2019s catalogued and rated chick flick kisses, because that would just be weird.\n\u201cHave you been eating hotdogs?\u201d Wade asks, striving as always to shatter the romantic atmosphere.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d he says kissing him again. \u201cBesides, you love hotdogs.\u201d\n\u201cNever said I didn\u2019t,\u201d Wade replies with a smirk.\nThe tension between them isn\u2019t exactly awkward, but it is a tad strained as Peter tries valiantly to decide how best to approach what he has planned.\n\u201cI want to do something for you,\u201d he finally blurts out, proving once again that he is up there with Don Juan as a debonair lady killer. He can practically hear the sighs of all the women who are missing out on his skills in the bedroom. They sound oddly relieved.\nWhich is why he\u2019s almost offended when Wade\u2019s guard goes up immediately, his eyes narrowing as he looks at him suspiciously.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta take off your clothes and get on the bed first,\u201d he continues quickly, and is gratified to see the suspicion dissolve to be replaced by eager excitement.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not even my birthday!\u201d Wade chirps, shedding spandex with alarming speed (how does he not get stuck in it? Peter\u2019s legs get trapped at least 80% of the time and he ends up flailing awkwardly and trying not to fall on his ass).\nWade practically swan dives onto the bed, rolling and bouncing, and generally making a spectacle of himself as he tries to get comfy against the headboard. Peter smiles indulgently, taking his time removing his own clothing as Wade complains loudly from the bed. No lingerie, he notes. Damn Peter for getting his hopes up.\n\u201cWade,\u201d Peter says, cutting off the babble momentarily. \u201cI said I wanted to do something for you,\u201d he pauses uncertainly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing just say so okay?\u201d\nWade snorts, which Peter takes as consent, so he climbs up onto the bed, straddling Wade\u2019s legs and grabbing one of his hands, holding it tightly within his own.\nHe starts by kissing each of his fingers, softly pressing his lips against the rough skin where scars obscure his fingerprints. He wonders what they would have looked like as he pulls the tip of his index finger into his mouth and nudges at it with his tongue. Would the ridges have been shaped in arches, or whorls, or loops? He takes a moment to mourn the fact that he\u2019ll never know.\nHe soon moves to the next hand to repeat the actions, kissing and nibbling at each finger, looking up occasionally to gauge Wade\u2019s reaction. His face is carefully blank but his eyes are blazing as he watches Peter move down to his wrist, kissing gently and flicking out his tongue to taste the sensitive skin. He drags his lips up his arm, taking time to lick and suck at the indent at the inside of his elbow before moving over to repeat his veneration on the other arm.\nWade\u2019s chest rises and falls rapidly along with his ragged breathing, but some of the tension starts to bleed out of his posture as Peter moves up to nibble at his shoulder. He rests his forehead against the slick skin for a second, nuzzling him until Wade\u2019s silence starts to worry him and he has to look up again.\nWade\u2019s eyes are dark, still burning intensely as they lock with his own, but he can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking. He leans forward to press his lips to the edge of Wade\u2019s mouth, kissing the corners until the frown on his lips begins to ease.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, still kissing along his jaw, following the rough line of it to curl his tongue around an earlobe.\n\u201cHot young guy kisses me all over and then asks me if I\u2019m okay. You really are stupid aren\u2019t you?\u201d Wade growls wryly as Peter bites his neck.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Peter agrees, licking the teeth marks even as they fade, swept away by his healing factor.\nWade makes a sound, no more than a puff of air, as Peter flattens his tongue against his pulse point to taste his heartbeat. He trails more kisses down Wade\u2019s neck to his chest, shifting his position as he kisses downwards, taking time to lave at his nipples.\nWickedly, he rolls one between his teeth just to hear the rumble of a moan that Wade tries to bite back. He can\u2019t allow himself to linger on them too much though because he knows how sensitive they are and he has plans for Wade tonight that require quite a bit of stamina.\nHe lets his tongue lead him down Wade\u2019s muscled abdomen as he looks up to see him staring at him intently, the barest whisper of a smile painted on the upturned corner of his mouth.\nHe closes his eyes and smiles back, kissing his navel, flicking his tongue out again, hoping for another moan. Thankfully he isn\u2019t disappointed. Wade\u2019s hands tangle in his hair as he moves down to his pelvis, studiously avoiding the erection that stubbornly makes itself known, bypassing it to bite his left hipbone. He bites the right as well for good measure, then follows the soft line of the crease of his leg down.\nIt\u2019s at this point that Wade gets impatient and begins demanding relief, and he isn\u2019t shy about detailing exactly what he wants either.\n\u201cPeter I\u2019d like you to meet my dick. Please, shake its hand, give it a kiss, do something. How can you just ignore it like that, it\u2019s right there!\u201d\n\u201cBe patient Wade, I promise I\u2019ll get there, but before I do I want to kiss every part of you,\u201d he tells him, biting his inner thigh. Wade swallows thickly.\n\u201cEvery part?\u201d he asks timidly.\nPeter nods, and continues to kiss down over his knee before Wade can even choke out his assent.\nHe continues kissing over every inch of his legs and feet until Wade is hard and leaking precome with his hands clenched tightly into the sheets in an effort to stay still.\n\u201cTurn over,\u201d Peter commands, pulling back after a final kiss to the sole of his left foot.\n\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Peter tries, and if his brown eyes widen pleadingly and his lower lip juts out a bit it is in no way done purposefully. It\u2019s not like he knows what expressions make Wade melt like a puddle, and if he did he certainly wouldn\u2019t file that knowledge away for later use (try abuse).\nWade groans and sulks and proves once and for all that he is a child in the body of a deadly killer, but turns over obediently and Peter takes a moment to silently congratulate himself and do a little mental victory dance.\nWade looks over his shoulder and frowns. \u201cWhy are you dancing? Is this about to become a scene out of one of the weirder 70\u2019s disco pornos?\u201d\n\u201cAre you suggesting there\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 70\u2019s disco porn?\u201d he deflects. Not to self: mental dancing is best kept mental.\n\u201cOh you haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen a chick with an afro go down on a guy with a bigger afro to the soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever\u201d Wade says gleefully.\n\u201cPlease, tell me more about the disco porn. I want to hear all about it,\u201d Peter replies dryly as he licks hot stripes down his spine, smiling as Wade arches into the feeling.\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m good, I\u2019ll shut up. Please continue,\u201d silence reigns for at least three minutes as Peter kisses every inch of his back and thighs, and he\u2019s impressed really, because even he would have made a sound if Wade had licked a stripe across the dip at the small of his back like he was doing to him right now.\n\u201cOkay, new plan. Talking is good. I\u2019m just gonna keep going while you do your thing okay?\u201d\nPeter tries not to grin as he presses his lips dangerously close to the line between his ass and thighs, nibbling and licking at him with broad sweeps of his tongue.\n\u201cOh yeah, now we\u2019re headed somewhere. Ugh, Peter that feels so good. Like, new gun that doubles as a flamethrower good. Oh! Yes, higher, more, c\u2019mon Pete give me more,\u201d the babbling sounds frantic, and Peter ruthlessly continues to tease and lick just shy of where Wade desperately wants his lips.\nHe finally presses open-mouthed kisses to one cheek and then the other, licking wetly at the top of the cleft of his ass. He moves over to bite the left cheek hard as Wade starts to rut against the bed in desperation. The slow, lazy seduction begins to take on an edge of frantic tension for Peter as well as he swirls his tongue in circles over scarred skin and is met with a needy whimper for his efforts.\nLicking in between his cheeks earns him a mewl of pleasure that is shockingly erotic, and he feels his own heart beating hard and fast as he makes Wade slowly lose his mind beneath him. He circles his tongue around his hole and Wade\u2019s grinding against the mattress increases frantically, and he begins to almost pant against the pillow.\nHeat coils in his belly and his body thrums with need as Wade\u2019s monologue is reduced to a desperate litany of \u201cPlease, c\u2019mon, please, please, need you,\u201d and he moves his hips rhythmically, continuously rubbing his cock up fast and fluidly against the sheets.\n\u201cTurn over?\u201d Peter asks, and is almost thrown off the bed as Wade rushes to comply. He finally kisses Wade\u2019s cock, pressing one kiss to the head, one to the shaft and one final wet kiss to his balls.\nHe then slides back up his body, leaning in to steal a kiss from his lips that lasts much longer than he had intended until Wade bites his lip and shoves him away, looking grumpy. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks distractedly, already longing to be kissing him again.\n\u201cKill me. With sex. I mean, it\u2019s a nice way to go in theory, but blue balls are no joke Pete. I really really need-\u201d\nPeter kisses him again, softly this time as he reaches for the lube and starts to open himself up with his fingers. The slick slide of them into him is maddening, and he finally quickens his pace as he adds a fourth finger to stretch himself wider.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to kill you,\u201d he pants, his body jolting as his fingers brush his prostate. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you I - how much I\u2026care,\u201d he mutters, leaning further into Wade\u2019s body to press their sweat-slicked chest together. He pants onto his collarbone while he spreads more lube liberally onto Wade\u2019s cock, making his hips jerk.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThe silence between them is a bit awkward, but that soon fades as Peter takes Wade in hand, guiding him to push effortlessly up into him. He keeps himself up so that Wade is just barely an inch inside, while both of them gasp at the sensation, before he pushes down another inch with a hiss, holding off Wade\u2019s attempts to buck up into him all the way.\n\u201cPete, I know you think you\u2019re being nice but if you don\u2019t get on with it I\u2019m- oh fuck, that\u2019s it. Ride hard. Don\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for that Aragorn,\u201d Peter laughs, having sunk down to impale himself fully again on Wade\u2019s cock.\n\u201cDoes that make you Arwen? You are pretty pretty but- Christ! Shit, Peter, Peter, Peter yeah!\u201d\nWade\u2019s nails dig into his thighs as Peter bounces enthusiastically on his cock, his head thrown back in bliss. It\u2019s impossible to focus fully on Wade as he loses himself in the shockwaves of pleasure coursing through him. His hips circle and Wade starts to thrust up into him, meeting his movements and driving himself so much deeper.\n\u201cWade,\u201d he gasps. His legs are shaking but his hands are steady as he runs them over every inch of scared chest before him. One hand slides up to cup Wade\u2019s cheek tenderly, their eyes meet, and suddenly Wade is coming deep inside him.\n\u201cKeep going,\u201d he rasps, and Peter does, clenching his muscles around Wade\u2019s spent cock to feel every inch of it still hard within him.\n\u201cI\u2026uh\u2026I feel the same, for the record,\u201d Wade says with alarming sincerity. \u201cWith the uh, caring and emotions and\u2026stuff. Even my boxes are nuts about you.\u201d His words are accompanied by his hand closing around Peter\u2019s cock to stroke evenly, and he comes with a silent scream, his eyes closing as he flops forward bonelessly onto Wade\u2019s chest.\nWade\u2019s hands scratch lightly at his back, drawing patterns on his skin, while Peter peppers a line of kisses across his neck. Of course, Wade chooses this happy moment to speak up, seeming almost terrified of the gentleness between them.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d Wade voice sounds too loud in the silence of the bedroom. \u201cThis\u2026this isn\u2019t a mistake is it?\u201d he asks quietly, like a man drowning, barely breathing as his lungs fill with the intimacy of the moment.\nPeter doesn\u2019t reply, he just rises up and kisses the words away, his hands gripping the sides of Wade\u2019s head tightly.\n\u201cI lose people Pete,\u201d he tries again, and is met with another kiss, slow and deep, until they both barely remember why they are kissing, or why they ever stopped when it feels this good.\nWade is dazed when they break apart, his eyes half closed so that he looks sleepy and content. Peter leans forward and presses their foreheads together.\n\u201cI lose people too,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t need any more words than that for Wade to understand.\nThey sleep that night wrapped around each other, tangled together, and for the first time in a long time neither dwells on what they\u2019ve lost, both finally losing themselves in the strange little something they have found in each other.\n\u2026\u2026.\nThe next day Wade blows up the toaster and Peter kicks him out for the rest of the day. He finds him curled up on the couch with the tv volume set low at one in the morning when he gets up for some water.\n\u201cYou coming to bed or not?\u201d he grumbles, watching in amusement as Wade fumbles with the converter and scrambles up off the couch to follow him back to bed.\nPeter sighs as he studies Wade, who squeezes him like the Kraken trying to down a ship.Wade is loud and rude, he thinks as he watches the man settle down for the night. He\u2019s clingy to the point of stalking and he can often be vicious and downright mean. Really he\u2019s everything Peter should avoid in a partner.\nBut then he\u2019ll go and prove that he\u2019s really honestly trying to be a good guy, or say something surprising and sweet, and rope Peter right back in no matter how angry he gets. His flaws may be glaring, but the closer he looks the more he realizes that Wade Wilson may be damaged, but he is by no means ruined.\nThey don\u2019t have a fairy-tale romance, but that kind of thing would never make sense for them. Not when one of them dresses up in a spider-themed costume and roams the city streets patrolling for crime and the other is sanity-challenged, scar riddled mercenary for hire. They don\u2019t get flowers and rainbows and sunshine all the time, their pasts are too riddled with sadness, pain and death for that, but they have each other to lean on, and despite all his faults Wade always proves he cares, and that\u2019s good enough for him.\nSo maybe their relationship isn\u2019t ideal, but Peter knows that if he has any say in it he\u2019s damn well going to strive for that fabled happy ending, mistakes and all."
