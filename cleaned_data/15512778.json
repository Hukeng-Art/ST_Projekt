    "text": "While many differences exist between an elf and a dwarf, the starkest of all is that of mortality.\nAt a certain extent of isolation from the world, the concept of death becomes mangled and shadowed in an elves mind. It stays that way until they witness it first hand. In all its glory, and horror.\nThe same can be said for Legolas, prince of the woodland realm. When Legolas was a child he witnessed the death of his mother, the near mortal grief of his father, and the fear. Legolas remembered crawling on his father\u2019s chest as a small child, curling up, and crying. He remembered the kind but sympathetic face of the healer explaining to him in words he could hardly understand that his father likely wouldn\u2019t make it through the night, and that he should stay with him to ease his passing. Legolas remembered the fear that he would be crowned king as a mere child. He wondered if mortal grief would take him too, if the realm would have no heirs after wards, he wondered why the idea didn\u2019t even bother him. He remembered the night stretching so long it felt like it would never end, laying on his father\u2019s chest and hearing his heart beat slowly but surely and he remembered waking up the next morning, not quite sure when he had fallen asleep, the rise and fall of his father\u2019s chest still as sure as ever. \nLegolas remembered his father\u2019s slow recovery, his return to the throne. \nHe remembers losing his mother and almost losing his father too.\nIn Legolas\u2019s mind he could never forget the true feeling of grief, the pain, the shocking heart stopping fear. But when he watched Gandalf fall from the bridge of Khazad-dum in Moria, and he heard Frodo\u2019s scream it didn\u2019t register. He ran from the sight following Aragorn and Boromir and when they left the darkness of Moria he stood. He watched.\nAnd suddenly he understood. \nGandalf was dead.\nThe concept seemed bizarre and far away as if Legolas was watching from a glass window hung between them. He watched as the hobbits seemed to collapse under the grief, he watched as his dwarven companion held his chest and hid his tears from no one. He watched Aragorn shift uncomfortably and Boromir sink to his knees and rub his face. It took a minute for the seriousness to sink in, and when it did it hit him full force and he turned from his company- no his friends and let the pain hit him. His eyes burned, and his breathing came harder to him. He was close to Gandalf, yes of course, they all were but his death is not what scared him so. What scared him was the harsh realization of mortality that surrounded everyone around him. Legolas too could die of battle wounds, but if by some miraculous blessing his friends did not die in this battle, death would come to them eventually. His knees buckled slightly, and his vision shifted from the green hills and stark mountainside, to his mothers funeral, holding the too cold hand of his Ada and crying. \nLegolas remembered Thranduil looking down and kneeling in front of him, wiping his tears with his thin fingers \u201cdo not cry little leaf, she would not want to see you this way\u201d \nFor some reason his words only made him cry harder, he didn\u2019t want to make his mother sad. Thranduil sighed and lifted Legolas to his hip. Legolas turned from the casket and buried his face in his fathers hair, and though he could not see his face the slight shaking from his chest made him realize, his father was crying too. \nWhen Legolas hit the ground, he was back on the mountain, the soft feel of grass below his fingertips brought life back to his very breathe. He was a wood elf that is. \nLegolas sat kneeling on the grass and after a moment of composure, he slid his bow and quiver off his back and a pulled a rag from his pack to clean his arrows. He let the repetitive actions soothe him and he let the images flying through his mind clear slowly. He listened to the sound of the flora around him, the soft rustle of the grass and the laughter of the trees swaying in the wind. \nThen he heard something else. Not quite man, but not hobbit either. A dwarf. The rustle was Gimli, moving behind him. Standing, then wandering closer and closer to him, he listened to him stop and hover behind him. Legolas bit his bottom lip, wishing the spirit of the greenery to turn him away. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered by dwarven loudness right now, he didn\u2019t want to continue the light-hearted competitiveness that lay between them. He wanted to be alone. Just for a while. Just until the grief was enough to bare alone. \nBut Gimli did not leave. \nHe stood behind him, then shuffled, then reached out and grabbed hold of his shoulder. Legolas would have flinched under other circumstances, he would\u2019ve withdrawn, or walked away. But there was something about Gimli\u2019s touch, the heat that seeped from his skin to Legolas\u2019s. there was something indescribably gentle about Gimli\u2019s fingers, a softness Legolas couldn\u2019t have expected from the dwarves calloused and rough palm. Legolas yearned to lean into the touch, but he withheld, the action bordering displays of affection for the elf. The hand moved away quickly but Gimli didn\u2019t leave, he walked around and joined Legolas in the grass. \nTheir eyes met for only a moment, and Gimli gave a rough sniff, wiping a stubborn tear from his exposed cheek. He then withdrew his axe from his back and joined Legolas in the cleaning of his bloody weapon. \nThey didn\u2019t share any words. Just the same space. \nBy the time Aragorn called for them to move again, and both of their choice weapons were scrubbed cleaner then they were the day they were made, Gimli simply offered Legolas a hand up, and they moved on. No words had been spoken, but something between the two had changed. \nThat was the first time he noticed.\nIt happened again on the road to Lothlorien while the others slept, Legolas keeping watch. When time came for the fellowship to move again, Legolas rose and called for the others. They shifted and slowly woke to full conscious, all except Gimli. Legolas figured the only one to sleep through the waking calls would be the dwarf, he mused silently how any of them arrived for early meetings or trainings if they couldn\u2019t wake when called. \nLegolas stood and shook the dwarf awake with his boot, jumping back when Gimli awoke with a shout and took a small hand axe to the place Legolas once stood.\nLegolas landed on a boulder a few feet away and watched in shock as Gimli blinked into existence and spotted the elf perched on the rock like a frightened cat.\nTheir eyes met wide in slight anticipation. Gimli waiting for Legolas\u2019s reaction, Legolas waiting to decide on his own reaction when something unexpected happened. Something in the moment between them shifted to humor and they shared first a smirk, then a chuckle, then loud rounds of laughter sprung between them. When the spell had passed, and Legolas had reached out a hand to right Gimli, the moment was over, and their journey continued. \nAnd if their fingers lingered too long, Legolas wasn\u2019t to take notice, or care. \nThat should have been it, but it continued.\nIn Lothlorien, when the fellowship headed to the elven bathhouses and Legolas caught a glimpse of Gimli\u2019s bare chest, covered in the same fiery hair that covered his head, he felt a cold\u2026 something drop in his stomach and chill him to the bones. Legolas forced his eyes to continue on their intended path and forced his feet to move. He was simply weary from his journey was all. A good elven bath and a hearty meal of greens would have him feeling better in no time. \nNot a day later Celeborn and Galadriel called for Legolas privately to relay a message from his father. It was simple, a good luck and a wish for him to return unscathed. Legolas knew the damage his father had endured at the hands of dragons, he knew that his father was constantly terrified not only of Legolas not returning from battle, but of Legolas returning from battle, scarred and bloody. He wished to spare his son the pain he had endured.\nGaladriel and Celeborn shared a teasing look then turned to Legolas with a smirk. Galadriel spoke with a light hearted and cheery tone, the same tone she used with him not too long ago when he was simply a child. \u201cHis exact words were \u2018check on my little leaf\u2019 I believe\u201d \nLegolas fought hard not to show his embarrassment, he was nearing 1000, he was no longer the child his father thought him of. Yet still, his father\u2019s concern for him brought happiness to his heart and heaviness to his mind. \nGaladriel continued \u201cso, \u2018little leaf\u2019 do you have any message you wish us to pass on to your father?\u201d some how keeping a tight edged control of formality even through her teasing remarks \nLegolas swallowed thickly and shifted in place \u201cI wish for you to solidify my well being in his mind, I know he can worry. Let him know I have no battle wounds or scars\u201d Legolas lied, he had been lightly scratched by an orc in the battle of Moria on the side of his chest. A small wound, barely noticeable by the trained elf, but one that pulled at his muscles annoyingly every once in a while just to remind him that it existed. \u201cand that I have found true friends in those who accompany me, that I trust them to fight not for me, but with me as equals\u201d \nHe cut himself off before he began to ramble, but Legolas\u2019s mind wandered off to the members of the fellowship. The true friendship and leadership he found in Aragorn. The companionship of the hobbits, the humor he found in their ways. In their simple courage and bravery to wander where most their size do not. He even found interest in Boromir, who brashness and inflexible persistence set him apart from the group. Then his mind wandered to Gimli, the friendship between them was timid and resourceful, clever but competitive. Mostly, in Gimli\u2019s eyes he found hope, opportunity for their friendship to grow strong and steady, like the tree roots that spread below their feet. But then, memories of grey robes, walking sticks, and pointy hats flashed through his mind. A deep warm chuckle and pipe smoke fashioning itself into a raven, and chasing Pippin around the camp, sweet memories turned sour. He turned the thoughts away.\nGaladriel nodded. At the memory of Gandalf, the air between them grew somber and stale. Galadriel shifted forward, taking a motherly step forward. \nWhen Legolas\u2019s mother had died, as his father recovered, he was sent to the Golden Forest to be raised and nurtured there. He didn\u2019t understand the reason for his relocation as a child so soon after his mother\u2019s passing, but later Legolas looked back at the incident and understood. He looked too much like his mother, a constant reminder, it likely made it harder for his father to recover as well. It was under the caring hands of Galadriel and Celeborn that Legolas first learned to shoot a bow. He had never told anyone, but they were practically his second set of parents. \nGaladriel hesitated to hug him, or touch him in any other way but she spoke quietly in their native tongue \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear of the passing of Gandalf, there will be a grieving hymn for him later this night as the moon rises high\u201d\nLegolas nodded but kept a stoic face \nShe continued. \u201cIt is never easy for any to lose a friend, but it may yet be harder for elves who experience so little death in their life time\u201d the words \u2018except you\u2019 remained unspoken\nLegolas\u2019s eyebrows burrowed, and he shook his head \u201cno, but I believe it is harder yet for those who knew him deeply. He knew Frodo since he was but a child, and had a strong connection with the hobbits, they all loved him.\u201d He stepped away slightly, raising his eyes to meet hers. \u201cI have endured worse, but it is not my grief that you should be concerned with\u201d \nCeleborn stepped forward and placed a comforting hand around Galadriel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYes, we know the pain the hobbits have endured, but we asked not of them, but of you.\u201d He stepped forward so that he and Galadriel were shoulder to shoulder \u201cHow are you fairing Legolas\u201d \nLegolas saw the kindness behind their eyes, and the intention in their voice, but he also understood the underlying message. The withheld looks of pity as if he was fragile, a piece of porcelain ready to break. They were asking if he wanted to go home. Reminding him that he had no obligation, that no one would blame him. \nLegolas stood straighter, whipping his expression into that of royal indifference, the kind mimicked from his own father \u201cI am fine.\u201d He said, hoping that to be the end of the conversation but Celeborn pushed on \n\u201cIf you are not-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Legolas interrupted \nA moment of silence passed between the three, as Legolas realized his outburst may not have entirely proven his intended point. In the quiet a small knock came from the door, Legolas turned away from the opening door, sure that whoever was on the other side heard his cry. Galadriel moved slowly from the space to the door and opened it gently to reveal a small but well cleaned red-headed dwarf. \nLegolas spared a glance and hoped that unlike Aragorn, Gimli had not learned the language of his people.\nGimli stood awkwardly for a moment then, raised his closed fist to place it awkwardly over his chest in an elvish salute. He bowed slightly in the direction of Galadriel and then at Celeborn. \nLegolas\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly at the gesture, where had he learned that?\n\u201c-er, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt my lady and\u2026\u201d he spared a glance at Celeborn, likely trying to differentiate gender \u201cmy lord?\u201d Gimli guessed glancing at Legolas who nodded his affirmation \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to collect Legolas, we have a long journey to plan, and we needed one of our members to be present\u201d There was stagnant pause and Gimli continued \u201cBut if this is a bad time I can just tell everyone to wait a bit\u201d his eyes darted between Legolas and Celeborn\nGaladriel nodded with all the grace of an elvish queen then returned to Legolas\u2019s side, she looked into his eyes deeply and gave a slightly sad smile before turning to Gimli again \u201cNo, that will not be necessary, Legolas is free to go\u201d \nBut when Legolas turned to leave she grabbed hold of his arm and said in Silvan \u201cI will pass on your message. If your journey carries on for too long and you find yourself able to rest, send your father a letter. He cares for you.\u201d Then quieter still \u201cwe all do. Stay safe Legolas\u201d \nHe nodded slightly hoping to express everything through his gestures, his apology his gratitude. Then he simply turned around and followed Gimli through the door. \nAs it closed behind them, they were shut in pale darkness. Only bright enough to see very near, Legolas could barely make out the dark freckles on Gimli\u2019s nose, and on second thought, why was he so close?\nThey walked slightly down the steps in silence before Gimli asked gruffly \u201care you okay?\u201d \nLegolas thought he looked fine, but he must have shown his unease somehow. He nodded \u201cI am quite fine\u201d \nGimli turned to him and reached out a hand, entwining their fingers. Legolas was thankful for the relative darkness so no elves on the higher levels could witness he movement, and thankful more still that Gimli couldn\u2019t see the blush that had settled on his cheeks. Legolas knew little of dwarven customs, but elves were proper and minimal in their displays of affection. \nOne didn\u2019t hold the hand of another until they were betrothed, or at least close to being so. \nLegolas looked down at their fingers and felt something flutter in his chest. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t quite as well as he was telling everyone, maybe he was coming down with something. \nGimli cleared his throat and spoke as casually as ever \u201cI don\u2019t know what all that shouting was about aye, but I know an argument when I hear one, in any language\u201d he waited for Legolas to respond, but something had felt like it had lodged its way into his throat and stayed there, he couldn\u2019t move, much less speak. So, Gimli continued \u201cJust know that, you don\u2019t have to be some brave soul that suffers in silence. You and Aragorn are right pig-headed\u201d \nLegolas gave a slight chuckle at that, relieved to see the function seeping back into his vocal chords\n\u201cBut, we\u2019re all hurting.\u201d Gimli sniffed roughly, Legolas knew how much the loss of Balin pained him so \u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep it inside you know. We understand\u201d\nLegolas nodded, knowing Gimli likely couldn\u2019t see the gesture in the darkness. \nGimli himself was simply watching the elves delicate features through his dwarven eyes unabashedly. Thankful for the poor eyesight of elves when in darkness. Thankful moreover for the eyes of dwarves in the dark.\nLegolas gave a tentative squeeze of Gimli\u2019s fingers, relishing the calloused finger tips but the gentle touch. It was a contradiction like so much about Gimli. \u201cThis I know of\u201d Legolas said \u201cbut I thank you for the reminder master dwarf\u201d\nWith that their fingers untangled, and they continued walking in silence before Legolas asked, \u201chow do you know the elvish salute?\u201d\nGimli scoffed \u201cI know of some elvish customs of course, greetings, giving thanks, proclamations of love if you know what I mean\u201d he said with a wiggle of his great eyebrows. He kept walking.\nLegolas stopped in his tracks letting Gimli fall ahead. His mind was abuzz, if Gimli knew of elvish affection, and he held his hand, then he must have known what he was doing. Was he- was he courting him? He gave a small \"oh?\"\nBut Gimli kept his pace up hardly noticing that Legolas had fallen behind. \nLegolas took the moment to let his face light up and he smiled into the darkness. He was courting him! A dwarf! The idea was absurd, but not too absurd that Legolas scoffed at the notion. Was it bad that he didn\u2019t hate the idea? Was it bad that he even wanted to respond to the courtship with displays of affection all his own? Was it bad he was smiling so soon after the passing of one of their own?\n\u201ccatch up laddie!\u201d Gimli shouted back\nLegolas rallied his features back into that of nonchalance and ran slightly to Gimli walking side by side as if nothing had happened. \nEven in the dark halls of Lothlorien, Legolas found a small beacon of brightness to light his way. \nHe followed it eagerly.\nAgain, and again and again Legolas and Gimli would find each other, and the world would seem to simply melt away. But they never spoke of it afterward, preferring to ignore their connection, and their growing courtship. \nIt seemed to be a theme.\nWhen Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli had been separated by the others, chasing the hot trail of Pippin and Merry, Legolas stayed awake and watched the stars. Thinking of the light, and of his home. \nGimli who had watch came and sat next to him on a stone as Aragorn slept.\nLooking up to the heavens Legolas spoke \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t openly watch Gimli, but he could see him from his periphery as he stole a glance at Legolas \n\u201caye\u201d Gimli said \u201cthey are\u201d\nThey did not touch, they did not speak, but the moment between them was peaceful and heavy with unspoken desires \nThe next morning, they continued without mention of the night before. \nWhile roaming through a forest on the continued search, Legolas climbed a tree and shook the acorns from their place. One fell and bounced off Gimli\u2019s helmet, he looked up at Legolas and shouted something likely profane in his language. \nLegolas watched with joy as Aragorn carefully and expertly avoided any and all falling objects. \nLegolas hung from a branch then landed besides Gimli who had removed his helmet to check for any lasting damage. \nLegolas picked the acorn with nimble fingers and held it to the sky. \u201cMy mother used to call me acorn\u201d The sentence only struck him odd after the words had been said. He barely spoke of his mother. He was told by his father to leave the past in the past. There were still statues and portraits of her of course but they did not speak of her together. It was a part of his past that was secret and was wished to remain that way. But for some reason, when Legolas spoke to Gimli of her, he didn\u2019t feel the accompanying pain or guilt. Just a light heartedness that washed over him as her memory did \nGimli gave a slight chuckle \u201cI can\u2019t ever imagine you being small enough to be called an acorn\u201d\nLegolas smiled at his words \u201cI was once, elves are not born as tall as they are fully grown\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t hardly picture a baby elf\u201d Gimli confessed popping his helmet back on his head \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to\u201d\n\u201cThey look similar to human baby\u2019s only with more prominent ears.\u201d Legolas said \n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same with adult elves too?\u201d\nLegolas gave an offended gasp \"are you comparing me to a child or a man?\"\nGimli thought on it for a moment then asked \"which ones worse?\"\nAragorn rolled his eyes from where he prepared a fire, and Legolas turned from him, to look back at Gimli as they shared a smile \"definitely a man\" \nGimli chuckled \"than a man I'm comparing you too\"\nLegolas eye's widened and pushed slightly back at Gimli \u201cthat is not true, and you know it as well!\u201d \nGimli gave a large hoot of laughter and narrowly avoided Legolas\u2019s swats of displeasure \n\u201cwe are nothing like men, we are taller, our hair finer and longer, our faces unable to carry beards\u201d Legolas began listing \u201cand we are more skilled in battle, handling of weapons, and in literature and language\u201d He stood chasing Gimli as he laughed, dodging a pinecone kicked at him \u201cwe are trained in high halls and we distribute food so none of our members may starve, we have a certain high disposition attributed to our race. We are nothing like that of blundering men\u201d \nHe watched Gimli trip over a large tree root and land on his chest, Legolas could hardly stop himself from losing footing as he tried to quickly make up for the disappearing foot hold. He tried to step over the dwarf, but his shoe slipped on the soft dirt on his way down and fell, almost sitting on the dwarf himself. At that, both bodies began to tip over as they fell together down a small leaf covered hill.\nWhen they finally stopped rolling the two were a mess of bodies and tangled limbs, attempting to stop laughing so they could actually catch their breath.\nGimli pushed Legolas off with a \u201cGe\u2019 off me\u201d then he turned to him with a quirk of his eyebrows and said \u201cAye, you\u2019re nothing like men, but you can fall like a dwarf\u201d\nLegolas burst out laughing, loudly and unabashedly. Oh, if only his father could see him now, laughing loudly covered in dirt while sitting half on a dwarf and half on the ground. \nLegolas and Gimli watched as Aragorn stole a sight of the two of them and grumbled about moving on to collect firewood or something, clearly an excuse to leave them be. As if embarrassed by their very existence. \nLegolas and Gimli took it as an excuse to laugh louder. \nBy the time the laughter slowed to a stop, Legolas stood dusting himself off and offered a hand to Gimli. They both stood in the clearing and stretched slowly working out their muscles and scraping the dirt off their clothes. \nLegolas gave a deep sigh, one that only comes after a large bout of laughter, or tears. He looked at the acorn still tucked between his fingers tightly and stole a glance at Gimli. He offered the acorn to him, and Gimli took it willingly, tucking it into his pocket. \n\u201cI\u2019ll keep it with me always\u201d the teasingly he drawled a \u201cmy little acorn\u201d\nLegolas pushed him slightly on his shoulder then felt himself blush under Gimli\u2019s gaze. Legolas stole himself then ducked down quickly to press a kiss to Gimli\u2019s cheek. When he straightened he fought a smile from forming too large on his face, then tucked a strand of hair that came loose behind his ear. He turned from Gimli, to watch the camp above them. \nGimli raised a single gloved hand to feel the skin and hair of his cheek where Legolas\u2019s lips had touched. He smiled quickly then tried to bury it under a fa\u00e7ade of toughness. He cleared his throat.\nLegolas spoke \u201cwe should at least offer our assistance to Aragorn\u201d\nGimli cleared his throat and nodded \u201caye, we should probably help the laddie out. Let\u2019s hope he hasn\u2019t completely given up hope on us and left while we were down here\u201d\nLegolas smiled at the teasing and began making his way up the hill back to the campsite. \u201cLet\u2019s hope not\u201d \nJust like always, they didn\u2019t speak of the kiss, or the acorn, that remained steadfast in Gimli\u2019s pack. They simply moved on, as if nothing had changed between them.\nWhen Gimli offered Legolas a small bouquet of wildflowers he had picked from the hill side. When Gimli braided flowers in Legolas hair, and Legolas the same for him. When they stayed up late and replaced Aragorn\u2019s sword with flowers as he slept. The star gazes. The secretive hand holds. The quiet cautious smiles. The loud rounds of laughter. The quiet moments too. Braiding each other hair with soft touches. The shared glances. Days running and nights sleeping hard. They spoke of none of it. Legolas always knew that it couldn\u2019t remain that way. Sooner or later, they would have to admit it. They would have to discuss their growing bond. When Legolas would have to admit to himself and one day perhaps his father that he wanted to stay by the side of a dwarf. That we wanted to be with him, his friend, his lover, his One. \nIt wasn\u2019t until they stopped for the night at a tavern that the careful fa\u00e7ade of ignorance and nonchalance came crashing down.\nThey had stopped for a night eager for a warm bath, good ale, and sturdy bed made of downing and not of dirt and leaves. They were sore and aching, hopes dispirited by another false lead, they were in dire need of a good rest.\nThey were fortunate enough to find a small run-down tavern, filled to the near brim with people of all creeds and races, men and dwarves muddled about drinking heartily and calling for more. Even a lone elf seemed content to read a scroll by the light of the moon. The floors sank under their movement, the whole room creaked as dancing was taken up in the middle of the room, the music was pitched so it hurt Legolas\u2019s ears, and their bread was stale at best. \nBy far, it was their best stay in weeks. \nThe first thing they did was book three rooms, while they were all fond of the others company they had grown tired of listening to their dreams muttered in native tongues, and Gimli\u2019s snoring made both Aragorn and Legolas want to rip their ears off, Elven or not.\nRaw and extended exposure to another person can make even their subtlest qualities irksome, and they all longed for a bed of their own. \nBut soon after their rooms were booked they headed straight to the bar to drown their sorrows. Aragorn surprised them all by drinking his weight in mead. By his fourth tankard, he was hanging off Legolas and speaking in riddled half Westron half Sindarin. Gimli was sat across the table from the two watching in humor and sipping an ale of his own. \nAragorn slung his body across Legolas\u2019s, almost laying across his lap. Legolas tried to ignore the heat radiating from his cheeks from the close contact, elves were not the touchiest of creatures, but Legolas was already warmed with a few too many wines himself. While the effects of alcohol did little to the elven form, they effected things like cognition, reflexes, and of course loosened the mental barrier between thought and spoken word.\nAragorn looked up at Legolas from his lap and reached up with two tired and childish hands for Legolas\u2019s ears. Legolas covered his ears expertly with his hands, for laying on his lap was pushing it but the fondling of elvish ears was too much for even him to bare. \nAragorn made a deep whine at the back of his throat and threw one arm over his face dramatically. \nLegolas could barely piece together what he said speaking in a different elven dialect that Legolas was raised in, and partly in slurred Westron, but he knew it had to do with Arwen and her ears. He talked about the elven promise of chastity until marriage, or marriage through breaking that promise. Legolas blushed again and glanced at Gimli who looked more confused than ever seeing as he could only understand half of what Legolas could. It was only when Aragorn started speaking of what he wished to do with Arwen\u2019s ears did Legolas decide it was time to get him to bed. \nLegolas shared a look with Gimli, who nodded without having to share words. Gimli stood then swallowed the rest of his drink quickly before going around and throwing himself under one arm of Aragorn, while Legolas supported him on the other side. Gimli cursed his shortness at having to raise his arms above his head to keep Aragorn slightly balanced. \nLegolas swatted Aragorn\u2019s wandering hand away from his ears once more while Gimli and he lugged the useless oaf up the stairs and into the room. It was only when they were standing outside the door did they realize Aragorn had left the key, and Gimli glad to be separated from the situation, excused himself back downstairs to pick them up. \nIt\u2019s when Aragorn began speaking in his messy bilingual tone. He spoke of Arwen\u2019s hair and his hope that she would go to the undying lands. He explained that he wanted to be with her, but more than that he wanted her to live, even if they were apart. \nLegolas smiled at the sentiment, one that was shared by not only men like Aragorn who fell in love with elves but elves themselves who might one day fall in love with mortals. Elves were warned of its danger, to bond with a mortal meant loneliness if not death. Mortal grief had taken more than a few good elves before. When Legolas almost lost his father to it, he promised never to fall for one who might die. He knew in his heart that as his mother was elf, elves could die as quickly as other creatures. But he knew his father could not lose him too.\nYet here he was, falling quickly for a mortal creature, a dwarf no less. He was promising himself a life of eternal disappointment or sure death and he knew his father couldn\u2019t survive losing someone else. He knew what he risked but he knew it was something he couldn\u2019t hardly avoid either. His feelings for Gimli shared only through simple touches and stolen glances gave him a glimpse of the world in all its colors. \n \u201cYou may not think it so, but Arwen has been given a blessing. Arwen had been given a choice to live eternally and alone, crippled under the weight of love lost, or grow old with you. Either way she chooses death eventually. But only one choice gives her happiness. Gives her love.\u201d Legolas almost choked on his next words as the realization hit him full force \u201cIf given her blessing, I would gladly choose the mortal life. My tale is long, and I have seen much grief. If I could age next to my One, I would. I would live every day watching the world in the brightest colors, I would watch the leaves turn orange in hues I never thought to be possible. And when the clouds turn grey and storms gather, I would gladly live in the rain and dance under the thunder, because life is beautiful yes, but it is nothing when compared to life with a love.\u201d He turned his gaze to Aragorn fondly, he was sagging against the door frame and looking up with wide wondering eyes \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll remember any of this tomorrow, alas I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you now. I just wish, I wish you could understand just how lucky you are to live and age and die next to the person you love\u201d\nAragorn nodded sadly, as if his head weighed too much to keep up. There was silence and then \u201care you talking about Gimli?\u201d \nLegolas visibly flinched under his words, and reflexively glanced around him to see if anyone had heard. The hallway was empty, save a very drunk man trying to open his door with the wrong end of a key. Besides that, Aragorn spoke in Sindarin and any who was not trained in that dialect wouldn\u2019t understand. \nStill, he lowered his voice. \u201chow do you know?\u201d he hissed \nAs Aragorn opened his mouth to respond, a very red and out of breath dwarf came sprinting up the stairs and explained \u201cI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s not on the table nor on the hook and the bar maid looked angry when I told her you misplaced it so no hope with getting a replacement\u201d \nAragorn hiccupped and gave Legolas a rather loaded look glancing between the two. Finally, he slid a hand into his pocket a withdrew the key giving an overly shocked look at the object then shrugging dramatically. \u201cfound it\u201d\nLegolas watched in disbelief as he opened the door and slid into his room quietly with a playful Sindarin \u201cgood luck\u201d as the door closed behind him leaving both Legolas and Gimli confused in the dark. \nGimli turned to Legolas and burrowed his eyebrows \u201cwell wat was all that about? I don\u2019t understand why Aragorn would hide th-\u201d\nBut Legolas didn\u2019t let him finish. In a feat of exhaustion, hope, and \u2018fuck it all\u2019 attitude he swooped down and gathered Gimli\u2019s face in his hands and kissed him. \nHe kissed him. For the confusion they both endured in the first second of the kiss that was all that rang through their heads. \u2018I\u2019m kissing him\u2019 and \u2018he\u2019s kissing me\u2019 Legolas reveled in the hair that tickled his face, in the deep smell of warm ale, linseed oil, and sweat. An utterly intoxicating combination that would offend Legolas\u2019s nose in any other situation but appeared to him as perfume. His lips, for all the hard edges of Gimli his lips were soft. His\u2026 lips\u2026 his completely unresponsive lips\u2026 and then Legolas withdrew, the realization of his actions hitting him full force. He took a step back, nearly colliding with the other side of the hallway. \nFor a moment a hundred different thing ran through his head. Anger and lust and confusion. He needed to go to bed. No, first he needed to apologize. And then he needed to go to bed. And then he needed to write to his father. A lot of things were happening. \nWhen Legolas spoke, it was quiet and timid, not with the royal assuredness he usually mustered \u201cI- I\u2019m sorry\u201d He finally looked up the Gimli, not able to make out the subtle features in his face in the darkness. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t hav-\u201d\nBut now it was Gimli who interrupted him, by approaching him quickly, pulling down on his tunic, and gluing his lips to his. Legolas stood bent almost in half to reach Gimli and Gimli stood on his tip toes to reach Legolas. It was all too ridiculous, and Legolas let the shock that hit him melt away and he reveled in the feeling. \nThe taste. The touch. It was all too much. Finally, Legolas sank to his knees to reach his height more properly, which was still awkward, since now he was almost shorter then Gimli. Their lips separated for a moment as they changed position, but quickly found each other again. \nThe first kiss was desperate, yes. But it was tentative, it was cautious, careful, questioning. This one was desperate in a way Legolas didn\u2019t know others could kiss. It was deep, passionate, he could feel a hunger resonate off him, not for food or ale, but for Gimli himself. \nHe wanted it all. \nLegolas brushed a hand through Gimli\u2019s beard, revealing in the thickness, and when it reached his chin. He used it to guide Gimli\u2019s face closer to him. Enjoying the feeling of Gimli, he didn\u2019t know before.\nBefore they could go farther, a door creaked in the hallway, as the drunk man finally found out how to use his key and he slipped awkwardly into his room. Legolas and Gili turned to each other, an awkwardness settling between them. \nFinally, Gimli grabbed the hand Legolas had wound inside his beard and held it firmly between his own. \u201cMy love for this is great but we should probably\u2026\u201d he cleared his throat \u201cget to bed\u201d \nLegolas\u2019s eyes widened, and he nodded. Standing up he brushed his tunic off with his free hand and leaned down to kiss Gimli\u2019s scraggly cheek once more. \u201cOf course,\u201d he squeezed Gimli\u2019s hand. \u201cuntil next time master dwarf\u201d \nBut as Legolas pulled away to enter his room and smile into a pillow, Gimli pulled him back \u201cand where are you going?\u201d\nLegolas raised an eyebrow \u201cto bed\u2026 aren\u2019t you?\u201d \nGimli shuffled his feet awkwardly and then said \u201caye, that\u2019s what I was planning\u201d \nLegolas\u2019s mind ran circles around itself trying to figure out the subtle nuisances to Gimli\u2019s speech. Were all dwarves this figurative? When his mind stumbled on another explanation his eyes widened drastically and the butterflies fought in the cage in his chest. Legolas gave a small shocked \u201cOh!\u201d then he looked down at their intertwined hands. \n\u201cI mean, not if you don\u2019t want to of course\u201d Gimli said to the silence \n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not my lack of want that makes me hesitate. I only\u2026\u201d Legolas swallowed \u201cthere are certain\u2026 traditions surrounding Elven\u2026\u201d he floundered for the lack of a proper word \u201cintercourse\u201d Legolas blushed impossibly red \n\u201cAye, of that I know\u201d Gimli said\nLegolas\u2019s eyes lit up, staring deeply at Gimli. \u201cYou do?\u201d\n\u201cAye, there cultural differences between us all. But Legolas\u201d he said stepping forward and placing a sturdy hand on Legolas\u2019s side \u201cI want to be with you\u201d \nLegolas thought back to Gimli\u2019s elven salute to the lady Galadriel and Celeborn. Perhaps certain eleven customs were not as private as he originally assumed. If Gimli could surprise him by knowing certain elven ways, then of course he knew about elvish marriage rituals\u2026 \n\u201cand you still want to?\u201d Legolas asked \n\u201caye. I still want to\u201d Gimli said\nLegolas was surprised how much like a mountain Gimli was. Strong in his ways, sturdy dependable, but ever changing. Just as you believed you had seen all he had to offer there was another cave to explore, another tree to climb, another adventure hiding behind every rock and pebble. Legolas, even a tree elf had always loved the mountains. \nLegolas thought about it. To lay with Gimli would be to marry him. When elves courted the other, it would take decades to decide to go further. His father and mother courted for over 80 years before becoming betrothed for another 10. It was a long decision for an elf, and as Legolas neared 1000 years, he was still young and unsure of his path in life. To marry someone, he had known for so little was rushed yes, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel as if he knew Gimli for longer. It was as if, he had slowly worked his way into his life and all his past memories. As a child as Legolas ran in the gardens, he was running not to a tree, but to Gimli. He ran towards a future with him. Long nights watching the stars, and braiding each other hair, cheek kisses, and awkwardly placed hand holds. When he met Gimli is when Legolas\u2019 life truly began to make sense. \nIt was hardly traditional, but a bed wedding for elves wasn\u2019t entirely uncommon. For a moment his mind wandered to his father, the look on his face when he found out, the disappointment, the anger, but he quickly pushed it from his mind and he smiled widely. \nHe was going to be married!\nHe nodded, tightened his grip on the dwarf and let Gimli lead the way.\nThe next morning, before the sun had quite risen, Legolas woke from bed and stretched deeply. He gazed ever so fondly at the dwarf that lay by his side, tangled in sheets, and naked from the waist up. Legolas let his whole-body tingle with happiness and excitement. He was married. He had a husband. They hadn\u2019t found Pippin and Merry yet. They were in the middle of a large war. Their likelihood of surviving this together was practically nonexistent. The likelihood that his father would ever talk to him again, if they did was even smaller. And it didn\u2019t matter in the slightest. Legolas felt his ears jump in excitement, he leaned over Gimli and pressed a kiss to his bare chest smiling as he mumbled something his sleep and turned away. Unable to contain himself he pressed yet another kiss to Gimli\u2019s cheek then rose from bed.\nGimli was right. Sex was good. Gimli had explained that dwarves were allowed to experiment frequently, that were given the right to explore their sexuality and subsequently themselves, but that they were strict in their dating and marriage bonds. Gimli had done it a few times before Legolas, but Legolas himself was nervous and shaky, unsure of what to do, or what to expect. But, just like Gimli had said, he trusted his body, trusted his partner, and it all worked out. \nLegolas was excited to try it again sometime. Now that he could willingly with his husband. His husband!\nHe dressed quickly, pulling his hair out from under his tunic. He realized that he can now change his traditional hairstyle from travel to marriage. He brushed his hair out with a fine horse hair brush from his pack, calming his thin fly-aways. Then with nimble fingers he plaited his hair into thin strips and worked his way slowly down the back of his head. Traditionally, elves braided their partners hair after their marriage, but with Gimli being dwarven, and asleep, Legolas did it himself. He hoped when he would wake Legolas would braid Gimli\u2019s hair to participate in a little elven tradition.\nHe tied it off, smiled again at his sleeping husband, strapped his knife to his side, and went out to collect herbs. Along with the braiding, Legolas hoped to find the herbs to make Gimli a tea. It was common to create a marriage tea for elven ceremonies, to be shared on each anniversary. Usually the ceremony occurred on the wedding day and not the day after but since this marriage wasn\u2019t the epitome of tradition, Legolas was willing to compromise. The herbs were also normally chosen before the wedding with advice from elders and married couples, but Legolas could improvise with some plants he knew grew around here.\nLegolas left the tavern, stepping out into a new day as the sun rose besides him. \nGimli woke up alone. \nAlone and slightly confused at it as well. \nLegolas the night before had seemed tentative but determined as well. He explained many times his desires, but he thought the \u2018what\u2019 wasn\u2019t simply sex but a relationship as well. But now, he had gone before even Gimli had woken, leaving his bow across the wardrobe but nothing else. \nGimli stood. He wasn\u2019t going to force anything on the laddie, if all Legolas wanted was a roll in the hay, then that was fine. Of course, Gimli wanted something more, but nothing was more important to him then ensuring Legolas\u2019s comfortability. He dressed slowly, placing the acorn Legolas had gifted him gently in his pocket, then leaving to get breakfast, feeling strangely hallow. \nFeeling used. \nAfter ordering a large plate of potatoes, sausage, eggs, a side platter of bacon, and of course a side of kafe, Gimli sat down at a table and began to eat. Aragorn was nowhere to be seen, likely staying in the latrine after all he drank last night. He tried not to dwell on the other member of their group, though he hadn\u2019t any idea where he ran off too. \nGimli focused on devouring his food. \nHe kept his gaze low, rotating from potato's to bacon and gently feeling the ridges of the acorn in his pocket. His mind was miles away, and he noticed Legolas's arrival only when he gently placed a small tea pot on the table, and bent over the desk to kiss him directly on the lips. \nGimli nearly choked on his meal in surprise and Legolas adopted a slightly concerned look and adjusted his grip to rub him gently on the back as he dislodged the food.\nAs Gimli regained the ability to breathe he turned abruptly to Legolas to stare him down with a look of clear question in his eyes. \u2018what the hell?\u2019\nIn front of him stood a new Legolas, practically glowing in the warm morning light that seeped into the tavern from the open windows. His hair was gathered in an intricate pattern of braids and plaits that gathered at the back of his head, unlike his usual two braids that hung by his sides. He stood as a new elf, entirely changed.\n\u201cwhat were ya thinking?\u201d Gimli practically hissed, grabbing the edge of the table to lean forward, his eyes running over the few customers who had woken, but none of their eyes seemed to be drawn to the odd pair and were instead intent on guessing the contents of their omelets.\nLegolas maintained his polite and slightly cool look of concern on his face, as he slid into the chair across from him. \u201cI was thinking of greeting you meleth nin\u201d he said almost teasingly \u201cnow, drink, I made gwend tea to celebrate\u201d\n\u201cwhat?\u201d Gimli asked the dumbfounded look not leaving his face \n\u201cour gwend tea, it is a tradition among our people\u201d \nGimli felt his eyebrows deepen in their crease he watched Legolas watch him and he realized Legolas was waiting for him to respond. An air of tension settled between them, Gimli leaned forward in his chair \u201cwhy are we drinking it now?\u201d \nLegolas smiled slightly, stood, and began pouring the tea into separate mugs \u201cto celebrate\u201d \nGimli\u2019s eyes nearly bulged from his eyebrows, elves really did have different traditions than dwarfs. Gimli thought he was talking about certain elvish kinks, he remembered his cousins telling him that elves liked their ears pulled. Gimli remembered hearing the words of disdain of elvish kind spread among his people, and later asking Dwalin how he knew about elvish traditions, and the awkward pause after brought laughter and teasing for ages. Gimli discovered himself the truth of the rumor, but if Legolas was celebrating what they did yesterday, like dwarves celebrate their 50th marriage anniversary, perhaps he misunderstood the severity of having sex with an elf. Gimli didn\u2019t exactly want Legolas to ignore him after yesterday, but this was\u2026 strange to say the least. \u201cI\u2019m very confused right now\u201d he finally admitted\n\u201cwhat of meleth nin?\u201d \nGimli blew out cold air from between his lips quickly then said in a rush \u201cwell, you\u2019re seeming happy about our little escapade yesterday, which I\u2019m glad for I guess\u2026 But when I woke up you were completely gone, and I thought you didn\u2019t want this, which I\u2019m also fine with. I just think we might be rushing into everything, don\u2019t ya?\u201d\nLegolas\u2019s eyes grew ever deeper his eyebrows gathering together in confusion \u201cWell, I simply left this morning to gather our gwend tea, and I was hoping to write to my father about our bond as well\u201d\n\u201cwhat?!\u201d Gimli ignored the looks the other customers shot him \u201cYou were gonna- what?! Why, why would you- no\u201d Gimli thought of elven tradition, was it common to write home about who you lay with? They really didn\u2019t get out much, did they? While Dwarves were comfortable in their sexuality, they understood a fair share of what was considered privacy. They knew what to keep to themselves and they knew what to write home about. A good dicking was not one of them. \nLegolas looked almost offended at Gimli\u2019s outburst. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he said slowly \u201cHe is my father, he deserves to know. He may not understand, but he deserves the least of knowledge\u201d \nGimli took a deep breathe \u201cLook\u201d he said \u201cI like this\u201d Gimli grabbed Legolas hands from where they sat worrying each other atop the table \u201cus\u201d he clarified \u201cAnd nothing would bring me more joy than to welcome you in my heart, and in my home when this is all over. But, I think until it is, we should take it slow. Think about who we tell this too, think about what we announce to the world, how they might twist and turn it against us\u201d\n\u201cyou believed we should keep our lives and love secret\u201d Legolas restated, it was question, but he didn\u2019t ask it as one\n\u201caye\u201d\nLegolas shook his head weakly, and Gimli felt near pity for the elf who for all but a minute ago was brimming with energy and happiness but appeared now as if he was a canoe with a large leak in it. Trying to stay afloat but still sinking nonetheless \n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly in the elven way\u201d he said quietly \n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, but I think it best\u201d\nLegolas nodded slowly, and withdrew his hands from Gimli\u2019s grip, lowering them to his lap. He stared off bitterly to the tea, as if cursing it for existing. \u201cSo, we are to hide our bond from the world until the war is over?\u201d\nGimli nodded\n\u201cI understand\u201d Legolas said, his voice still low. He looked up from his lap unsurely then licked his lips and continued \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, its simply elven way to be proud of your marriage\u201d then he continued as if he hadn\u2019t just dropped a bomb shell \u201chowever I endeavor to respect your cultural and personal preferences as best as possible\u201d\nThe moment between them sizzled, Gimli felt himself as a kettle, quickly reaching his boiling point. \nThen, as Legolas leaned forward to collect himself, and the tea, Gimli exploded \n\u201cYou\u2019re married!?\u201d\nLegolas flinched slightly in reaction blinking down at him with large elf eyes, a small question smile worked its way onto his lips \u201cwhat are you-\u201d as the realization dawned on him, he gave the tiniest \u201cOh.\u201d He leaned forward, sensing the seriousness of the situation and spoke quickly \u201cGimli, last night when you said you understood the traditions of elven intercourse\u2026\u201d Legolas didn\u2019t finish, feeling faint \n\u201cNow I know, elf and dwarf traditions vary greatly\u201d Gimli continued for him \u201cBut I\u2019ll have you know that dwarfs are proud creatures, and while we are more flexible in the positions of sexual encounters than are elves, we are not so lowly that we use the willingness of others to cheat on our spouses\u201d he spit the last words scathingly \nLegolas recoiled, opening his mouth as if to say something. \nWhich is exactly the moment, that a certain hung over and sleep addled ranger decided to settle himself next to Legolas on the table. Legolas snapped his jaw shut as Aragorn sleepily reached over to steal a piece of sausage from Gimli\u2019s plate. \nAt Aragorn\u2019s appearance the pair fell silent, their anger and confusion and guilt burned away heavily, but it stayed silent. They sat in stilted awkwardness as Aragorn made his way through half of Gimli\u2019s plate. \nWhen Aragorn finally seemed to take notice of the pair quietness, his froze half way through a mouthful, then slowly, but loudly in the silence, finished chewing. His eyes slid up to Legolas\u2019s face, and froze in mid-recognition of the change in his hair. \nHis eyebrows burrowed \u201cyou changed your hair\u2026\u201d he said, undoubtedly running through his mental catalogue of elven hairstyles. When he landed on the mark, his eyes widened almost comically, and ignoring the looks Legolas shot him, looked rapidly back and forth between the two. \nHe caught sight of the tea, then pointed at it with no audible dialogue accompanying it, his mouth opening and closing awkwardly as his mind struggled to find words.\nGimli seemed to find the sight only ever-confusing, but Legolas leapt from his space on the table and wrapped his nimble fingers around Aragorn\u2019s upper arm and pulled him quickly away from the table, the chairs scraping behind them. \nAragorn swore in Sindarin at the suddenness of their movements.\nLegolas led him a few feet away to the front of a fire place where a warm fire crackled over logs, and began to ramble in his native Silvian, not pausing to care or even think if Aragorn could follow \u201cYesterday, when you were warmed with ale, you mentioned my bond with Gimli. I kissed him and-\u201d\nAt Aragorn\u2019s reaction, Legolas realized Aragorn could understand, though likely not as fluently. He pushed on \u201cand then, before\u2026\u201d Legolas played with his lip between his teeth \u201cwe bedded, I asked if he understood elvish tradition and he said he did!\u201d At this Legolas seemed to deflate, he collapsed on the arm chair to his right and buried his head in his hands, sure that Gimli was watching this entire exchange. \nHe felt Aragorn\u2019s change. He seemed gentler, as if he found less humor then he did before. He approached him slowly, then stood next to him. Legolas could sense his hesitation as he placed a gentle hand on his back and rubbed. Though Legolas didn\u2019t want to admit it, the touch was comforting. He yearned to talk to his father, he wanted his advice, or even his caring hand, brushing his hair, braiding it with gentle nimble hands, he would know what to do. \nAragorn began to speak in stunted Silvian \u201cLegolas, it was a mistake, but Gimli will understand if you speak wit-\u201d\n\u201cdon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Legolas interrupted \u201celven marriage only exists within the confines of total consent\u201d\nAragorn ran the idea through his mind \u201cso you and Gimli aren\u2019t married?\u201d\nLegolas shook his head, staring into the fire \u201che consented to the act, so I think the marriage would hold up\u201d\nAragorn sighed deeply, and watched as Legolas buried his head in his hands again \u201cSo would your preference would be for your marriage to be withstanding or for it to be false?\u201d\nLegolas gave a slight grunting, as if he had uttered half words, but nothing understandable. Legolas heard Aragorn hovering behind him, then heard him walk away. There was something horribly hopeless in the action. He had no doubt that he was difficult to deal with due to his current state, but he would still appreciate companionship. \nLegolas couldn\u2019t forgive himself. Tricking Gimli into marriage wasn\u2019t simply an elvish crime but a despicable act. Legolas knew this in his heart, but he couldn\u2019t shake the disappointment.\nAll elves were taught to respect themselves as who they are and not for who they are bonded with. Legolas knew to not measure his value on who had love for him in his heart, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel almost lost knowing that Gimli in fact didn\u2019t want to marry him, and that he lay with him anyway.\nAragorn tore himself away from Legolas and made his way back to the table where Gimli had sat back around awkwardly as if he hadn\u2019t been plainly watching their interaction. Aragorn slid into the chair across the table, and lazily reached out a hand to steal a piece of sausage from his plate. It was a testament to Gimli\u2019s suffering that he did not oppose the action. \n\u201ccongratulations\u201d he said \nGimli turned to him and raised his eyebrows \u201con what?\u201d\n\u201cyour marriage\u201d Aragorn said plainly, then reached for a hunk of bread \n\u201cmy what?!\u201d Gimli looked almost defensively \nAragorn didn\u2019t even need to speak, he simply glanced towards the muddled mess of the elf crumpled over near the fire. It was a pitiful sight, but he had hoped one day it would be humorous in his mind\u2019s memory. \nGimli seemed at a loss for words \u201cto what, laddie, might you be referring?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you knew all there is to know of Elven culture\u201d Aragorn said teasingly \n\u201caye and I thought I did too. Between you and me though,\u201d Gimli said aware that Legolas was likely listening in on their entire conversation \u201cI think most of what I\u2019ve been told by my kin isn\u2019t the whole truth\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely.\u201d Aragorn consented \u201cElves are rather private about their marriage customs\u201d Aragorn said again, to hell with subtlety, he was tired of this never-ending game of cat and mouse. \nHe watched as confusion gave way to understanding, his lips parting and his eyes widening, and he gave a very simple and very small \u201cOh.\u201d his eyes widened farther \u201cyou mean that\u2026\u201d\nUnderstanding gave way to shock \u201cLegolas and I\u2026 we-\u201d \nAragorn now fighting the urge to roll his eyes leaned over to grab his mug of kafe and drain it quickly \u201cAll it takes for and elf to marry is a quick bed and they are bonded\u201d \nGimli blew out cold air from his lungs and sagged in his chair, as the thought rolled over him \u201cso he wasn\u2019t cheating with me\u201d\nAragorn smiled \u201cYou honestly though Legolas cheating on his spouse with you?\u201d \nGimli gave a half shrug \nAragorn smiled \u201cThen you do not know our elf friend half as well as you think you do. Legolas is fiercely loyal, and specifically-\u201d Aragorn continued, his words masked in meaning \u201cto the people he loves\u201d\n\u201cAye I see that\u201d then \u201csee, we dwarves are a proud people. We have our customs as well and we bond only once\u201d \nAragorn took another sip \u201cas do elves\u201d\n\u201capparently\u201d The acorn weighed his pocket down heavily, it sat as if it were a hunk of freshly mined gold, a precious jewel or gem, Gimli ran it between his fingers. It was only when he looked up did he notice Aragorn was blatantly staring at him did he speak again \u201cwhat?\u201d\nAragorn clenched his jaw then leaned over the table to swat at Gimli who still stood there in shock \u201cGo. Talk. To. Him\u201d \n\u201cA\u2019ight A\u2019ight I\u2019m going\u201d Gimli swatted away Aragorn\u2019s attacks, straightened his jacket then swore under his breathe \u201cMahals balls\u201d\nAragorn pulled Gimli\u2019s plate closer to him, ignoring the elvish bonding tea as he watched Gimli walk over to where Legolas sat still toppled over himself, and began finishing the rest of his meal. The meal was large enough to fill a hobbit, much less a dwarf, and much much less a man, but Aragorn was no quitter.\nHe watched, rather openly, as Gimli placed a caring hand on Legolas\u2019s back then withdrew as Legolas quickly stood up and stared at him with wide eyes. He watched but did not hear as Gimli rubbed his hands together nervously and began to speak. \nLegolas sitting on an arm chair, and Gimli standing where about equal in height.\nIt was almost laughable. A dwarf falling in love with an elf. Wilder still was the idea that an elf would love the dwarf back. Wilder then it all however, was how lovely they looked together. Fitting like lost pieces of puzzles, that against all odds found a match in each other. Two idiots, in the middle of a crisis of misunderstandings and miscommunications. It was strange, it was all too bizarre, and it was wonderful. \nAragorn watched as words were exchanged, and Gimli leaned forward to the confusion, then contentment, of Legolas, and kissed him gently. Legolas froze for a moment, then joined him.\nAragorn looked away and failed trying to keep the smile off his face. He had no idea where this would go next, but for the moment he didn\u2019t let his mind wonder of it. He just turned back to his (Gimli\u2019s) plate and continued eating with a renewed vigor. \nEven in the darkest of battles and largest of wars, there were stolen moment of peace and of love. And despite the couples seemingly endless mistakes, something beautiful arose from it. \nHe took a sip of kafe, and thought of his own elf waiting in Rivendale, he missed her, longed for her, but for one shocking moment of clarity the thought of her did not pain him. It brought him only happiness. Something to look forward to. Something to live for, to fight for. \nHe smiled. \nFor the moment, if only the moment, all was well.\nThranduil sat laid out on his throne, running the worn letter between his fingers. There was something almost comforting about the movement. As he had lost most of his sight when he received his scars, seeing was an extra step for him. His stewards knew this and took extra steps to ensure his comfort, announcing their actions before they carried them out, letting their feet fall louder then most elves would, occasionally whistling or humming if they were out of his sight but hadn\u2019t left the room. \nDespite his trusted sense partially leaving him, he could still read. It took extra time, yes, but he could make out words on pages, he could see paintings, and pictures, and if he focused just well enough his eyes could discern facial expressions. \nWhen he read Legolas\u2019s letter however, he thought for a moment that his mind was playing a trick on him. First when he saw the sure scrawl of Legolas\u2019s print, he felt relief, more so when he learned of his presence in Lothlorien, then worry when he read that he was continuing the battle until the war was won, then at the following sentence pure unadulterated confusion. It didn't help that he was in the middle of a sip of tea, when he read that he was married. \nMarried.\nTo a dwarf. \nTo a dwarf. \nTo. A. Dwarf. A dwarf. A small, hairy, bad tempered, and long bearded dwarf. The word always seemed a fitting description for the creature. Short, stout, and not the least bit elegant. It fell stilted on his tongue. Yet the word was printed finely there. Clear as the rest of the letter. He had half a mind to call in a steward or maid and ask them to read the letter to him, but he cast the thought away as quickly as it came to him. If it was in fact not written, then he would look a fool, if it was, then Legolas would look one. \nA foolish prince and king would not a good kingdom make.\nHe read the words again, felt with his fingertips the scratches the quill made on paper. Spelling the word clearly, spelling the sentence, the letter, the fine print of Legolas\u2019s name on the bottom corner. \nHe found no fault. \nHe found confusion and anger yes, but mostly he felt concern. \nAs to his knowledge Legolas found as much distaste in the dwarven race as did he, he found no amusement in their lifestyles their lack of hygiene or their brutish, lumbering ways. If he left like this, either he was under some kind of spell, or worse yet, it was of his own free will, but he was addled by ale, and rebellion, or the toils of war. \nThranduil knew Legolas was too young to attend this quest, more so he knew he was too young to fight in a war, too fragile from the loss of his family, from his own childhood sickness that plagued him only a few centuries before he decided to leave. \nWhen he was alerted to Legolas\u2019s presence in Lothlorien, he was informed that he was well, not physically or mentally injured, that he was holding up well to the recent loss of a member of the Fellowship, Gandalf the Grey. But Thranduil heard the stories, that Gandalf had returned stronger as ever bearing a new name. \nHe was aware of the fellowships movement throughout the world after the battle, he had been informed by a rather talkative Raven that they intended to stay for a few nights in his palace, that the wizard, the halflings, the man, the dwarf, and his son were to arrive soon. \nAny moment now, they would come bursting into his halls, and he knew he would have his son back. He knew as well that he would be accompanied by his\u2026 his husband\u2026 that they would have to speak of it. \nThranduil for the moment let his mind wander. Not for the first time, he wished for the comfort of his wife. She would know what to do, what to say. She had a way with words and on the rare occasions her words failed her, she would turn to touch. A simple touch of fingers on cheeks, or the small brush of her tucking a wayward strand of hair behind an ear, could convey everything that words couldn't reach.\nThranduil let his working eye close and fell into comforting darkness. When he first fell ill, the darkness frightened him, more so then any 7000-year-old creature should have been allowed to be frightened by something so trivial. Yet it did. When he had full use of his eyes, the darkness was impermanent, fleeting. All he had to do to cast the shadows off, was mutter an incantation, light a candle, look to the stars. Yet, when he awoke, grievously injured, his eyes wrapped in bandage, darkness encasing him, the healers unsure if he would ever gain the ability to see quite fully again, there was no escape from the darkness. \nYes, eventually he healed to see light again, more impure then it was before, tainted and greyed. Yet when his wife would stroke the curve of his ear just lightly enough to show her love, when she smiled, when Legolas laughed, or tried to comb his hair with uncooperative tiny fingers, light would shine again. Not in the way Thranduil had grown use to, but brighter then he had ever expected.\nWhen a guard entered the room with a loud creak of the door, Thranduil pocketed the letter and cast the memories from his mind, turning to give the nervous elf a curious look. \nThe elf fidgeted in her place and stuttered a \u201cthey\u2019re arrived sir\u201d\nHe nodded regally \u201csend them in\u201d \nThe guard nodded, then clearly remembering her training to vocalize her actions squeaked out a \u201cyes sir, right away sir\u201d She darted out of the room\nThranduil adjusted himself in the throne, rearranging his clothes to lay artfully around him. He commandeered cool nonchalance, despite his emotions raging on internally. \nWhen the door opened, he listened rather than watched as a Wizard marched into his throne room with as much confidence as a king walking into his kingdom, yet enough respect to make Thranduil less likely to dissaprove of him manner. A man was by his side, yet he did not steal a glance, four halflings followed, one still limping from his previous injuries, two awkwardly nudging the other as if trying to get the others attention, one stood still a bandage wrapped thickly over his hand. Then he felt his son walk in, his heart jumping a mile at the sure-footed step of Legolas, standing side by side with the dwarf.\nThe dwarf he married. \nHe addressed them coolly in Westron \u201cI welcome you to my kingdom\u201d\nAragorn responded \u201cMany thanks my king, our travels have been long and weary but we are grateful for your hospitality we hop-\u201d\nThranduil cut him off before he began to ramble \u201cdid you bring me spoils from your time at war?\u201d\nAragorn stuttered \u201cEx-Excuse me, my king?\u201d\nThranduil raised his eyebrows and leaned slightly forward in his throne, he could make out the blurry silhouette of the ranger standing hesitantly in front of him \u201cMy hospitality is well received I assume but I ask for something back, a treasure from war, from battle, as a show of your thanks\u201d if there was one thing Thranduil loved, it was putting on a show of the spoiled king.\nGandalf spoke now \u201cWe can bring you a leaf from the head of an Ent. In the last battle against Saruman, this single leaf fell from TreeBeard and he offered it to our young hobbits as a show of respect\u201d \nOne of the hobbits shuffled and opened his mouth to protest \u201cBut he gave it to me\u201d \nGandalf\u2019s voice was low with warning \u201cPippin\u201d\n\u201cI was gonna hang it over my fireplace\u201d\nThe other hobbit turned to the one speaking \u201cYou\u2019d drop it and it would burn up, you know this Pip\u201d\nHe scoffed, and recoiled slightly \u201cNo, I\u2019d put it in a case or\u2026 something\u2026\u201d\nGandalf tuned to the halfling, Pippin his name was \u201cTook, you will do as you are told\u201d\nThranduil in mild amusement, he hoped he kept hidden, raised a single heavily ringed hand, to silence them \u201cKeep your Ent leaf halfling, I do not care for treasures as simple as that. I was hoping\u201d he said slowly, his voice heavy with meaning \u201cYou would return something of mine, that I had lost\u201d\nThe meaning was not lost on the group, though he could tell it was not understood by most \n\u201cwhat does he mean by that you reckon?\u201d Pippin asked the other he had been arguing with quietly, as if the king himself, as well as any other elf who passed the halls couldn\u2019t hear the conspiratorial whisper \nLegolas stood forward, and stronger then the sapling he left as, now a grown tree steady and sure, he spoke \u201cyou ask too much my king\u201d\nThranduil raised an eyebrow but did not speak, did not trust himself to \n\u201cThings that once were yours can change and grow when you let them go. They may return to you, yes, but they will no longer be yours, at least not in the way you remembered them\u201d \nThranduil felt his lip tremble at the thought of losing his son but he spoke carefully, calmly \u201cand have I lost that which once belonged to me? Has it changed so much it is no longer mine?\u201d\nLegolas\u2019s voice was now calmer, gentler. He took a few steps forward, and Thranduil ignored the defensive step forward the dwarf mirrored, as if he were to protect him from his own father\u201cNo, you will never loose me, but I expect you to understand that I have changed\u201d\nAt the change in pronouns, Thranduil stood quickly from his throne and rushed forward, hearing Legolas\u2019s movement as well, he ignored the tension that filled the rest of the group at the sudden movement. \nThey crashed into each other, Thranduil\u2019s arms finding their way around his son comfortingly, he felt Legolas\u2019s smile from a mile away, and even in the shadow of his sight, a light shined brightly. \n\u201cAda\u201d Legolas said through his smile \u201cI missed you\u201d he spoke in Silvan\nAnd Thranduil smiled back \u201cMy acorn\u201d he said, the nickname returning easily, along with the bittersweet memory of his mother, how she would have hugged him, how she would have admonished the both of them for their words of wit.\nThranduil moved his hands quickly to Legolas\u2019s face running his fingers from Legolas\u2019s hairline to his chin, trusting his fingers to notice any scars his eyes might miss. Legolas stood still, fighting off a smile as he let his father\u2019s fingers maneuver his face. \nWhen Thranduil was sure his son was alright, he moved his hands to his hair and froze at the unfamiliar braids, marriage braids. The whole situation crashed down again, the war, the battle, the letter, the marriage, the dwarf. Legolas noticed his father\u2019s hesitation, and bowed his head\n\u201cAda\u2026\u201d Legolas said \nBut Thranduil was moving, he patted his son\u2019s cheek caringly, then moved away, turning to address the rest of the slightly confused group \n\u201cyou will be given rooms, and full access to amenities. From the bath houses, to the kitchen, a feast is being prepared for dusk, but until then please, retire to your rooms, my stewards will show you the way\" he gestured with a hand \nLegolas nodded and bowed, a clear agreement to speak later. He stepped away and joined his group ignoring the open stares the rest were giving him. He noticed neither Aragorn or the dwarf joined their confusion, it was as if they were already aware of Legolas\u2019s parentage. \nGandalf spoke for them \u201cyour kindness is much appreciated\u201d he stepped back and began to follow Galion who appeared to escort them to their rooms\nAs they left he heard the other halfling, the limping one speak up \u201cMr. Legolas sir, am I correct in assuming you are his son?\u201d\nLegolas nodded \u201cYour assumption is correct sir\u201d\nThe one fighting with Pippin, piped up \u201cblimey, we\u2019ve been traveling with a prince this whole t-\u201d\nThe doors closed behind them leaving Thranduil alone again. He felt giddy, but the underlying issue remained. They would speak after the feast, he would find out what was going on with his son. \nThe feast was fine, he was surprised that the dwarf\u2019s manners outdid the hobbits. The halflings together consumed at least half the table. Though he noticed the two quieter, more heavily wounded hobbits starkly avoided the center Lembas Bread as if it carried disease. They seemed to enjoy the fresher things, the fruit, the salads, the wine, and juices. \nIt was a refreshing meal, but his eyes kept wandering to where his son and the dwarf sat. While they used one arm to eat, the one closest to each other was conspicuously under the table, and he was willing to bet their hands were entwined together. He had noticed they hadn\u2019t wandered from each other, they stayed close, joined nearly at the hip. \nLegolas turned to smile at something Gimli said under his breath, he laughed loudly, not bothering to hide his smile behind his hand as he did before. Thranduil knitted his eyebrows at the action. It was good to see his son enjoying himself, and proud to be doing so, but the change in him was stark and directed at a dwarf, no less. \nLegolas caught his eye and his smile melted from his face at the look, Thranduil quickly turned to engage Aragorn in conversation about his childhood in Rivendell\nLater that evening when the entire fellowship had retired to their chambers for a long night, Thranduil moved gracefully through the halls and came to the room his son was staying in, Legolas had denied entry to his old room, larger and more elegant then the others, he wanted to stay near his companions. A strange choice but one Thranduil allowed. Battle did things to people, changed them, small things from the ways they laughed, to where they slept. Thranduil was patient, he could wait for his son to meld back into his old life. He had survived and that\u2019s all he asked for. \nBut now, with this marriage, nothing could go back to normal. Legolas could not adjust to life in Mirkwood any more then Thranduil could endure a dwarf as kin.\nWhen he arrived at Legolas\u2019s room, he found it empty. He dreaded the thought, but he ran his tongue harshly over his top teeth and turned on his heel to where he knew the dwarf was staying. Though when he came to the door and knocked, he was also met with silence. In barely withheld anger he opened the door and entered the room where he saw sure signs of his son, a horsehair brush, his bow and quiver, his cloak, but he didn\u2019t see Legolas, or his pet dwarf anywhere. \nThranduil wandered from the room, to the hallway, trusting his keen ears and his knowledge of the layout of the castle to guide him, as darkness had fallen. He listened to the sound of hobbits snoring away soundly in their respective rooms, they had all chosen to sleep in the same room, in two different beds. They were close creatures and truly understood the meaning of friendship, though they were short and rather crude, they were amusing and kind, he understood why Legolas cared for them so. \nHe heard the hurried but light step of an elf wandering towards him, and Thranduil stopped the elf \u201cdo you know where my son is?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir, I saw him down by the kitchen, I just came from the cellar though, and was asked to deliver linens, so I did not speak with him or inquire about his location\u201d \nThranduil recognized the elf, he was one he had seen before but never spoken to, he seemed sure of himself however. Thranduil nodded \u201cdo you know if the dwarf was with him\u201d \nThe elf hesitated, obviously picking up on his sons inability to maintain subtlety \u201cYes sir, they were close\u201d \nThranduil dismissed the elf and carried on his way, his mind playing loops. Why was Legolas in the kitchen with the dwarf? He barely even knew how to make food for himself, what connection did he have with a kitchen of all places?\nThranduil was quickly growing tired of this scavenger hunt. He hoped this lead would provide him some results or he would retire to his room. \nHowever, as he neared the kitchen he noticed the lights that brightened the space, he crept near the door, slowing himself, choosing to listen rather then see. \nFirst, he heard the sound of pouring water, and the tinkling of a spoon against a mug. His other senses picked up the smell of green tea, one of his sons\u2019 favorite beverages. However, it was not Legolas who drank the tea, but the dwarf. He could imagine their positions, Legolas standing and pouring the tea, Gimli sitting by a table watching it happen. \n\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re such a prick\u201d came a voice, low, gruff, dwarven\nThranduil felt himself tense, no dwarf was allowed to insult his family, but before he could spring to action he heard Legolas\u2019 laugh again, openly and proudly \n\u201cgrowing up in such a place does things to people\u2019s mind\u201d Gimli continued \n\"But that decision was not my choice. So, enlighten me master dwarf, what does it say of you, that you chose to marry one who \u2018grew up in such a place\u2019?\u201d Legolas asked teasing \n\u201chey! I chose nothing of the sort, I was bloody tricked!\u201d\nThranduil leaned closer, he was tricked? Was this all an accident that Legolas was simply to afraid to ask for help with? Was he ashamed of his mistakes? Worried of any punishments? He wished he would simply come to him and speak of his troubles, he could help him. \nBut Legolas simply scoffed, there was movement as if someone had pushed the other \n\u201cYou knave!\u201d Legolas shouted mirth clear in his voice \u201cyou said you agreed to it Mr. \u2018I know all about elvish tradition\u2019\n\u201cand what of you, you could have been a bit clearer don\u2019t ya think?\u201d\n\u201cmy apologies master dwarf, I didn\u2019t think I had to spell it out for you\u201d \nat this there was sudden movement, the sound of skin smacking skin, then there was silence as the dwarf adjusted himself \n\u201cpeace!\u201d Gimli cried \u201cpeace! I have a hot drink with me, let\u2019s be mindful of the heat why don\u2019t we\u201d\nThere was silence and the sound of Gimli sipping from his mug before he spoke \n\u201cso this is where you grew up?\u201d\n\u201cyes, it was my home for many a years, I was sent to live in the Golden Wood with Lady Galadriel and Celeborne for a few years in my childhood, but I always consider this to be my home\u201d\n\u201cYou lived in Lothlorien?\u201d\nThranduil shifted slightly to peak through the door, watching the scene play out through a single blurry eye\n\u201cyes\u201d Legolas said, reaching over to take a sip of the green tea that Gimli drank from too\nThranduil marveled at the sight, they were close if Legolas drank from the same cup\nLegolas weighed his words before he spoke carefully, quietly as if the words were sacred \n\u201cAfter my mother died, my father had a hard time taking care of me\u201d \nThranduil felt a rough pang in his heart at the mention of his departed wife, at how openly vulnerable Legolas allowed himself to sound.\n\u201cHe tried his best, but he was ill, and angry and grieving, so he sent me to people he trusted, to take care of me when he couldn\u2019t. But elves, and I\u2019ll have to explain this to you since you obviously won\u2019t know-\u201d At this Legolas squealed as Gimli reached across the table and pinched him on the arm \u201cbut, elves react to emotional distress differently. So, when we lose a loved one, we can fall into mortal grief, and die ourselves, that\u2019s what almost happened to my father. When I was grieving for my mother and suddenly lost contact with my father I took to illness as well\u201d\nLegolas reached out to take hold of Gimli\u2019s hand and they sat in silence for a minute \u201cSo yes I lived in Lothlorien for a while, but when I fell ill my father returned for me and I returned to health as I returned to the Green Wood. \nGimli was silent as he drank the words in \u201cwell I think he\u2019s a git for it\u201d\nLegolas recoiled \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cwell I get his reasoning for sending you away, but he caused you harm. He had no right to ignore your suffering\u201d \nLegolas tilted his head \u201cI- Gimli I get your concern, but I do love my father.\u201d\n\u201caye, and I love mine, but he\u2019s made his fair share of mistakes. I\u2019ve told him rightly so when he needs to hear it. People you love can do bad things, it doesn\u2019t mean their bad people\u201d\nThe words hung between them and hit Thranduil squarely. At first, he jumped to anger and denial, but as he stood in silence separated thinly by his son, he realized the dwarf was right. Gimli was right. Sending Legolas away was the wrong choice, and when he realized how sick Legolas had fallen because of his decision, he knew he would never be able to forgive himself. Thranduil still couldn\u2019t. But he would work as hard as he could every day to make it up to him, to make it right. To be half as good of a person his son thought he was. \nLegolas nodded slowly \u201cyou never cease to surprise me Meleth nin, your wisdom is like a well. It never runs dry, but deeper still, I think, is your compassion.\u201d \n\u201cNo\u201d Gimli said \u201cI think just my love\u201d\n\u201caye, your love too\u201d Legolas said, and that was it\nThranduil suddenly felt like a thief, to have stolen such a beautiful moment for himself when it was not his to be a part of but as he moved to leave, he caught a glimpse of his son through the cracks of the door. His face illuminated by candlelight, him holding on tightly to a large dwarven hand, he looked happy. \nThranduil knew how his son could glow, how he could brighten a room with a smile or a word. But now, he seemed brighter somehow, as if simply being in the presence of this dwarf changed his life, made him lighter, kinder, brighter, new. \nthe word escaped from his lips\u201c\u2026oh\u201d\nIt seemed so simple, the answer was so clear all along. \nAt the sound, Legolas narrowed his eyebrows and rose. \n\u201cwhat do you hear?\u201d Gimli asked\nThranduil stepped quickly away from the door, knowing his son was hearing his every footstep, with two soft strides Legolas reached the door and pulled it open, ready to fight. It seemed those years of battle had conditioned him to do so. \nThranduil didn\u2019t try to hide, he stood tall and stiffly as the smell of tea surrounded him\n\u201cAda?\u201d came Legolas confused response \n\u201cLegolas\u201d Thranduil knew to step through the doorway to play it off, but he found his feet couldn\u2019t move. \nLegolas didn\u2019t say anything, he stood with a hand still on the knob. He was afraid of his reaction, afraid of rejection likely. \nThranduil turned his sight to Gimli who sat, feet dangling on a stool pulled up near a table. He knew to be quiet, but didn't know not to stare. For a brief moment, Thranduil could swear they made eye contact. \nLegolas watched Thranduil\u2019s line of sight change to Gimli, and he spoke again \u201cAda\u2026\u201d this time his voice was heavy, with apology, and shame, but there was something else, a strength, a willingness to be inflexible. He continued in Silvan \u201cAda I\u2019m sorry this was sudden, and I know it\u2019s a lot to put on you, but I\u2019m no-\u201d\nThranduil raised a single regale hand to silence him and he responded in their native tongue \u201cdoes he make you happy?\u201d \nLegolas nodded without hesitation, and for a single shimmering moment, Thranduil saw only a kid. He saw Legolas barely 80 years old putting weeds he had gathered in a flower vase for a center piece, he saw Legolas as a baby pulling on his hair, and grasping his finger, he saw Legolas as a 300 year old lying sickly and pale on a cot in Lothlorien, he saw him crying, shooting a bow and arrow for the first time, he saw him on his first camping expedition, he saw him proudly reciting the poems of the Green Wood from memory, he saw him hanging upside down from a great oak. And then he saw him. An adult, but still his baby. With shining defiant eyes, and a look of heavy love in his eyes\n\u201cyes, Ada\u201d Legolas said \u201che makes me happier than anything\u201d\nThranduil nodded and felt something stick in his throat. No matter how many times he tried to clear it, it just came back. He leaned forward and kissed his son on the crown of his head, then stepped back and nodded again, giving him a thorough look. \u201cThan who am I to take that happiness from you?\u201d Then he turned to Gimli and spoke in clear Westron \u201ctake care of him master dwarf, and we will take care of you\u201d\nGimli nodded quickly, as if shaking him out of his reverie\nThranduil turned from the kitchen and walked into the darkness. As he left he heard the sure sounds of Gimli and Legolas celebrating, he heard Legolas shaky breathes, Gimli swearing, and then they embraced fondly. He left before he could hear more.\nThe dwarf had changed his son, but not in a bad way. Thranduil had to let his son go but when he did he knew he would be in good hands. \nHe felt a traitorous smile creep to his face. He may not understand it, but perhaps it was never meant to be understood by lingering ears or watchful eyes, simply for the pair to experience, themselves.\nOh, and what a pair they were. \nAs long as they were too live, and as long as they were to love, they had his blessing."
