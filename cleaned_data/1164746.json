    "text": "Derek stares at Isaac in disbelief. He glances behind him, across the lunchroom to the table in question. Scott McCall is throwing cheetos across the table at Stiles Stilinski, while Lydia Martin and Allison Argent sit off to the side, texting and paying the boys no attention. Jackson Whittemore is picking cheetos out of his perfectly gelled hair, and Stiles and Scott are doubled over in laughter.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Derek shakes his head resolutely just as Stiles jams two cheetos under his upper lip in an imitation of a walrus. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Isaac whines, dropping into the seat across from Derek. \u201cPlease? They\u2019re really cool, especially Scott. He\u2019s on the lacrosse team, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI am aware of that, yes,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019m also aware of the fact that he and Stiles have warmed the bench for the past three years.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Isaac asks. \u201cSince when did you start caring about someone\u2019s lacrosse ability?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Derek sighs heavily through his nose, the heavy scent of school cafeteria overwhelming him for an unpleasant moment. \u201cYou brought it up.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I thought it might make you stop being an idiot and actually make a friend or two.\u201d\n\u201cI have friends,\u201d Derek argues. \u201cYou, Erica, and Boyd. Danny. If you add in my obligatory connection to Cora, then that\u2019s five whole people, Isaac.\u201d\nIsaac rolls his eyes. \u201cYou need friends who aren\u2019t like us.\u201d\n\u201cDanny\u2019s not like us,\u201d Derek says defensively.\n\u201cWhose family\u2019s not like us then,\u201d Isaac sighs. He raises his eyebrows as he stands. \u201cYou can sit here alone with your book; I\u2019m going to go sit with Scott and his friends.\u201d Derek watches as Isaac takes his lunch box and grabs his backpack from the floor and swings it over his shoulder. \nBeing alone has never bothered Derek. Before Isaac, Erica, and Boyd got attacked by that rogue Alpha last year, the only friend he\u2019d had was Danny. He was content. People annoyed him, and high school was dumb anyway. He only had one semester left, so he could suffer through. But as soon as Isaac joins the table, six pairs of eyes turn and stare at him. He feels everything from pity to irritation to idle curiosity stemming from them.\nCursing his life, Derek grumbles under his breath as he gathers his lunch and carries it, his book bag, and book over to the table.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Scott says brightly. \u201cGlad you decided to join us, too. I thought for a minute you were going to stay over there by yourself because you didn\u2019t like us or something.\u201d He shoots Derek a crooked grin, and Derek just grunts.\n\u201cYeah, no obvious signs of dislike there,\u201d Stiles says sarcastically. Derek just glares at him, and Stiles gives him a shit-eating grin.\nDerek picks up his book and ignores everyone as he starts to read.\nHe sat at the stupid table, didn\u2019t he? That\u2019s all anyone can expect of him in one day.\n*\nDerek kinda hates lunch. He hates how loud everyone is at the table, even Isaac. They yell and argue and tease each other like they\u2019ve known each other for years, which Derek assumes they have. He doesn\u2019t know anything about them. Doesn\u2019t care to.\nThe first week, Scott and Allison had tried to engage him in conversation about different things like movies, music, and sports, but after receiving nothing but monosyllabic answers, they stopped trying. Lydia discussed their AP chemistry homework with him the week after that, and despite being the only junior in the class, she was doing better than even him in the class, and he\u2019d always been great at chemistry. He didn\u2019t mind talking to Lydia when she talked about science or history, but when she slipped into \u201cAnnoying Teenage Girl\u201d mode, even the sound of her voice grated on his nerves. Jackson ignored him unless he had a question about lacrosse, and Stiles just threw things at his head.\nNeedless to say, it was hell.\n\u201cKeep dreaming, Scotty boy,\u201d Derek catches Stiles say. He lifts his eyes from his book long enough to see Stiles clap Scott on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have goals, even unrealistic ones like playing first string lacrosse.\u201d\nDerek snorts.\nStiles turns to him. \u201cOh, the mighty senior lacrosse captain has ascended from the depths of his daily literature to deign us with his presence.\u201d\nDerek frowns, and Stiles smiles like he derives pleasure from making Derek miserable. The sadistic little shit, he probably does. \u201cYou both could make first string,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIf you\u2019d put half as much effort into lacrosse that you do into goofing off.\u201d\nStiles pulls an exaggerated face, feigning surprise with a hand to his heart. \u201cOh my god, Derek. You are absolutely correct. How have I been so stupid for so long?\u201d He turns to Scott. \u201cScott, I\u2019ve just been given the secret to our success!\u201d\n\u201cStiles, stop being a dick,\u201d Scott says, shoving Stiles so hard he falls off the chair in a flail of limbs. Derek laughs, and covers it quickly with a cough. But when Stiles pops his head over the edge of the table, the amused look he gives Derek lets him know that Stiles didn\u2019t miss Derek\u2019s laugh. If Derek didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say Stiles looked embarrassed.\nScott ignores Stiles as he asks, \u201cYou really think we could make first string?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes are still on Stiles, on the faint flush covering his cheeks, on the way his lips are parted. Lovely lips. Kissable lips. \nThe thought surprises Derek and he shakes his head, turning his attention to Scott. Scott looks so hopeful that Derek can\u2019t crush his optimism. Isaac smiles at him widely and gives him a thumbs up when Derek gives Scott a few pointers.\nDamn this lunch table. They\u2019re starting to get into his head.\n*\nAfter that, Derek makes sure to focus on his book and starts bringing his iPod so he can slip in his headphones and read as he tunes everyone out.\nToday, though, that was apparently not an option.\n\u201cWhatcha reading?\u201d Stiles asks, snatching the book from Derek\u2019s grasp the same time he pulls out Derek\u2019s earbud. He\u2019s sitting in the vacant seat beside Derek instead of on the other side of the table where he usually sits. Derek glowers at Stiles as he read the cover and wrinkles his nose. \u201cA Farewell to Arms isn\u2019t on the AP reading list, unless Mrs. Gresham has broken from her old ways and changed things up. I hear she doesn\u2019t ever do anything different, which I\u2019m hoping is still true. I\u2019ve already read half the AP reading list, and I plan on slacking next year.\u201d\nDerek snatches the book back from Stiles. \u201cIt\u2019s not for AP English.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re reading Hemingway for fun, really? Could you be any more clich\u00e9?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Hemingway,\u201d Derek mumbles.\nStiles throws his head back and laughs a loud, full laugh. Derek is taken aback by how open and genuine the laugh is, and his eyes are drawn immediately to the long, pale line of Stiles\u2019 throat. He shakes his head when he realizes he\u2019s staring.\n\u201cYou would like Hemingway,\u201d Stiles says, his eyes bright and shining. Derek\u2019s never really given Stiles a second glance before, but now that he\u2019s forced to talk to him, he realizes that Stiles has lovely eyes. And that really annoys him. \u201cActually, it makes perfect sense. Short sentences, less is more, nine-tenths under the surface. That fits you perfectly.\u201d\n\u201cOh, like your Faulkner-esque rambles are any better,\u201d Derek retorts.\nStiles narrows his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that was supposed to be an insult, but it\u2019s actually a compliment. Because Faulkner is the best.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Derek says, slamming his book down on the table. \u201cFaulkner, really? You don\u2019t like Hemingway, but you like Faulkner?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like Hemingway,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI said it was clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cOh, like Faulkner\u2019s not clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s not Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\nStiles grins, and there\u2019s an unreadable look on his face. Derek doesn\u2019t break eye contact as he tries to figure out why Stiles is looking at him like that. But before Derek can think about it too hard, Stiles says, \u201cFaulkner had one of the shortest chapters in English literature, you know.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is a fish,\u201d Derek quotes. \n\u201cOf course you knew that,\u201d Stiles says, dropping his head and shaking it with a small smile. \nWhen the bell rings dismissing lunch, for the first time, Derek doesn\u2019t think that it\u2019s the greatest sound he\u2019s ever heard.\n*\nThe next day at lunch, Derek has just pulled out his book when Stiles slaps it down to the table. \u201cNot today, Hale-ingway.\u201d Stiles laughs, obviously pleased with his own self-proclaimed wit. Derek rolls his eyes.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d Stiles pulls a book from his bag and opens it up to a marked page. He hands it over to Derek, looking both expectant and excited.\nDerek takes it with a sigh and looks down at the book, open to chapter 31. \u201cNothing much else happened, all the rest of that night,\u201d it reads. He flips it, and sees that it\u2019s Ray Bradbury\u2019s Something Wicked This Way Comes. He looks up at Stiles, who appears pleased with himself.\n\u201cI found another short chapter,\u201d he says. \u201cNot as short as \u2018My mother is a fish,\u2019 but still pretty impressive.\u201d Derek snorts. He goes to hand the book back to Stiles, but Stiles pushes it back towards Derek. \u201cKeep it and read it. Not as pretentious as Hemingway,\u201d Stiles teases, \u201cbut it\u2019s a freaking awesome book.\u201d\nDerek nods and puts the book in his bag.\n*\nThat afternoon, Cora finds Derek sitting on the front porch swing, a quarter of the way through Something Wicked This Way Comes.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, dorkus?\u201d she asks, dropping onto the swing and causing it to jerk. \n\u201cDid you suddenly go blind?\u201d Derek snaps, not bothering to look up from his book. \u201cI\u2019m reading.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you ever do,\u201d Cora says. \u201cI\u2019m bored, go running with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cYou can read your stupid book later.\u201d Cora takes the book from Derek and looks at it. \u201cErica told me that Stiles gave you this book.\u201d Cora smirks at him as she holds it out of his reach. \u201cIs it to the gift-giving stage already?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek says, reaching for the book but failing to grasp it. \u201cHow did Erica find out anyway? She has lunch with you.\u201d\n\u201cIsaac,\u201d Cora says. Derek punches Cora in the side, and she grunts and swipes at him with her claws. She rips through his t-shirt and draws blood.\n\u201cCora!\u201d Derek growls, wolfing out and lunging for her.\n\u201cWhat is going on out here?\u201d Talia yells as she comes from the house. \u201cCora! Derek! Stop!\u201d\nDerek and Cora break apart, but continue glaring and growling at each other. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten blood all over the porch.\u201d\n\u201cCora started it!\u201d Derek mumbles through his fangs.\n\u201cBecause Derek won\u2019t go run with me,\u201d Cora says. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy reading the book his boyfriend gave him.\u201d\nDerek lunges and snatches the book back. \u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend,\u201d Derek says quietly.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about a boyfriend?\u201d Talia asks, hands on her hips. \u201cDerek, do you have a boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHe does, too!\u201d Cora says gleefully, shifted back to human. \u201cIsaac said so.\u201d\n\u201cIsaac\u2019s an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cDerek! Language!\u201d Talia says.\n\u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d\nHe pushes himself off and looks down at his tattered shirt. For a moment, he panics when he thinks the book has been destroyed during his fight with Cora, but thankfully, it\u2019s in tact. He sits back down on the swing, and his mom is still standing there, staring at him impatiently.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a boyfriend!\u201d Derek exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s just a friend.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Derek curls into himself and mumbles petulantly, \u201cJust a kid at school.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Stiles,\u201d Cora tells Talia. \n\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s son?\u201d Talia asks sharply. Derek nods. Talia inhales, and puts her hand to her forehead. \u201cDerek, really?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Stiles?\u201d Derek asks. Cora watches between them with interest, and Derek shoves her for good measure. \u201cI thought you like the sheriff.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Talia says, \u201cBut honey, we have to be careful.\u201d\n\u201cHe just lent me a book!\u201d Derek exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m not wolfing out or humping his leg.\u201d Cora sniggers, and Talia glares at her until she stomps inside the house, muttering under her breath something about missing everything. \nAfter Cora\u2019s inside, Talia sits on the swing beside Derek. \u201cIt\u2019s just dangerous. If the wrong people found out about us \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d\nTalia reaches out and brushes a few errant strands of hair from Derek\u2019s forehead. \u201cI want you to be happy, to find a nice girl or boy. But honey, we have to be careful with our choices. The sheriff\u2019s son is risky, because if a human found out \u2013 \u201c\nDerek jerks away and crosses his arms. \u201cStiles is not like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s a very nice boy.\u201d Talia drags her hand across the back of Derek\u2019s neck. \u201cBut Derek \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him, okay?\u201d Derek says, standing up and gripping the book. \u201cSo you have nothing to worry about.\u201d\n*\nThe problem is, Derek realizes the next day at school, that he does in fact like Stiles. And when that happened, he doesn\u2019t know. But the moment he catches sight of Stiles in the lunchroom heading for their table, his heart does a funny flip inside his chest. \nIt doesn\u2019t even make sense. Stiles is all long limbs and awkwardness, but there\u2019s just something about him. His eyes, or maybe his lips, or maybe the way he teases Derek about all his books but finds other short chapters and brings him things to read. Scott says something that makes Stiles laugh until there are tears in his eyes, and Derek wishes he could make Stiles do that. For a moment, he\u2019s jealous of Scott.\nIsaac looks over and eyes him with a smirk, and Derek wants to die of embarrassment.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019d you think?\u201d Stiles asks as he takes a bite of an apple from his seat across from Derek. \u201cWas it awesome, or was it awesome?\u201d\n\u201cIt was good,\u201d Derek says with a nod as he slides the book across the table. Stiles\u2019 hands are so close to his, and it would be so easy just to reach out a little father and cover his thin hand with his larger one, link their hands together. Derek thinks their hands would look nice entwined. \u201cI liked Fahrenheit 451 better.\u201d\nStiles rolls his eyes. \u201cYou would.\u201d\n*\nStiles brings Derek books twice a week for the next few weeks. Graphic novels, comic books, high fantasy, and even YA books. \u201cDon\u2019t judge,\u201d Stiles says when Derek turns his nose up at Percy Jackson. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Stiles had, of course, laughed at Derek when he\u2019d flown through the whole series that week.\nDerek brings Stiles books sometimes, too. Old favorites of his that have broken spines and dog-eared pages from too many rereads. Books by Chris Crutcher from his childhood, Vonnegut, Stephen King, even Catcher in the Rye.\n\u201cOf course you like Holden Caulfield,\u201d Stiles teases as he nudges Derek in the shoulder. Stiles has started sitting beside him, claiming it was because Allison wanted to be closer to Scott. Derek thinks it\u2019s just so he can steal half his lunch, read over his shoulder, and generally annoy him.\nMaybe Derek imagines it, but Stiles doesn\u2019t move away. He stays pressed up along Derek\u2019s side as he flips idly through Derek\u2019s copy of Cather in the Rye, skipping to the pages Derek has dog-eared and underlined instead of starting at the beginning. Before long, Stiles picks up a pen and writes something in the margin beside a passage Derek had underlined years ago. \nSomething about the whole situation makes Derek feel warm all over.\n*\n\u201cWe should hang out this weekend,\u201d Stiles says as they walk out of the lunch room Friday. Usually, Derek walks alone because Stiles walks with Scott, but today Stiles hangs back so he can walk with Derek. Derek tries not to read too much into it. Or the fact that Stiles wants to get together outside of school.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be cool,\u201d Derek says all cool-like, when all he really wants to do is press Stiles up against the lockers and bury his face against his neck. It\u2019s been becoming an increasing problem, this instinctual urge to rub himself all over Stiles so he\u2019ll smell like Derek. He finds himself wanting to do it like once a day, and it kinda freaks him out \u2013 he\u2019s never felt this way before.\n\u201cCool,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat do you want to do? I\u2019d say we could go to Barnes &amp; Noble, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d jizz your pants.\u201d Derek scowls, which Stiles apparently finds hilarious. \u201cNo, seriously. What\u2019s your favorite thing to do in Beacon Hills?\u201d\n\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d Derek asks.\nStiles quirks his head to the side. \u201cOhmigod, you\u2019re embarrassed! What are you going to say, the tobacco shop on Taylor? Or worse, that skanky bar next to the gym that you go to after your workouts with your fake ID.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a fake ID,\u201d Derek grunts.\n\u201cOh, right. They just let you in because you look about thirty-five.\u201d\nThey arrive at Derek\u2019s fifth period class, and he ducks inside without giving Stiles a response. \nTwo minutes after the bell rings, he gets a text message from Stiles.\n\nDon\u2019t be grumpy. I was just joking. Seriously. Where do you want to go?\n\nI\u2019m not telling you over text message, Derek responds.\n\nWhy?\n\n\nYou\u2019ll make fun of me. I\u2019d prefer to be there in person when you do.\n\n\nIt is much more fun when I can gauge just how annoyed you are by the state of your eyebrows.\n\nAfter school, Derek smells Stiles before he sees him. It\u2019s a bit off-putting when he realizes that he\u2019s memorized Stiles\u2019 scent. Cinnamon and something fruity, like peach or some other summer fruit. He shakes his head, because he\u2019s embarrassed that thought even passed through his head.\n\u201cSo, what is this special place you couldn\u2019t mention over text message?\u201d Stiles asks, bumping Derek in the shoulder. His scent wafts over to Derek, and he finds himself fighting the urge to bury himself against Stiles\u2019 neck again. Derek would blame the full moon, but it was last week.\n\u201cThe arcade on Magnolia,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles laughs, but then stops abruptly. \u201cOh wait, you\u2019re serious?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, maybe this was a bad idea,\u201d Derek says and starts for his car. Stiles runs after him and grabs his arm to stop him. \n\u201cDude, calm down,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t expecting it, that\u2019s all. I thought people stopped going to the arcade in like 1985.\u201d\nDerek glares, and his feelings war inside of him. He\u2019s a bit embarrassed Stiles laughed when he\u2019d mentioned the arcade. Maybe it was stupid, but the arcade is his favorite place in the world, and he kinda wants to take Stiles. He\u2019d thought Stiles would like it, and his feelings might just be hurt a bit because he didn\u2019t expect Stiles to laugh. But he can\u2019t get the smell of Stiles out of his nostrils \u2013 it\u2019s like it\u2019s ten times stronger all of a sudden \u2013 and it\u2019s causing his wolf to go crazy. Not that the teenage boy inside him is faring any better, if he\u2019s honest.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to go to the arcade. I\u2019ve never been.\u201d Stiles shoves his hands into his pockets and shrugs. \u201cTonight? We can grab dinner if we get hungry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\nStiles smiles, and Derek knows he\u2019s fucked because all he sees is sunshine and peaches.\n*\n\u201cIs it normal to just want to rub your face into someone\u2019s neck?\u201d Derek asks Laura as soon as she answers.\n\u201cHello to you too,\u201d Laura says. \u201cDo you have a crush?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek replies miserably.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Laura says. \u201cDoes he like you back?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek answers. He\u2019s driving slower than usual on his way home, because he needs someone to tell him his wolf isn\u2019t going insane, because right now, that\u2019s the way it feels. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad at first, but it\u2019s been getting worse and I just keep wanting to press him up against the lockers and rub myself on him - and not even in a sexual way!\u201d\nLaura laughs on the other end. \u201cOh, you got it bad.\u201d\n\u201cToday was awful. I could barely think straight when he was around, and I keep smelling cinnamon and peaches and it\u2019s distracting.\u201d\n\u201cHave you asked Mom or Dad about it?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know I have a crush,\u201d Derek mumbles.\n\u201cUh-oh. Why not? What\u2019s wrong with him? Witch? Hunter\u2019s son? Derek, is he forty this time?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, no Laura, gah. You\u2019re an asshole, just so you know.\u201d \n\u201cHey, I have to ask these questions, Derek. Last time you called me like this, it was about Kate \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Derek growls. He grips the steering wheel too tightly, and he\u2019s seriously questioning his decision to call Laura in the first place. Too bad she\u2019s the only one he could go to with this. \u201cBut nothing happened there. I broke it off when I realized \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cYou mean when I realized she was a hunter,\u201d Laura interjected.\n\u201cFine, you saved my ass, stopped me from making a huge mistake,\u201d Derek sighed. \u201cCan we please fucking move on? We\u2019re talking about Stiles. Not things that happened over a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cStiles? The sheriff\u2019s son?\u201d\n\u201cWhy is that the first question out of everyone\u2019s mouth?\u201d Derek asks. \n\u201cLet me guess. Mom\u2019s giving you a hard time.\u201d\n\u201cCora let it slip we were friends and that I had a crush on him like a month ago, and Mom went into her Alpha \u2018we have to be careful\u2019 lecture.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I hate that lecture.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too.\u201d They\u2019re silent for a moment, a feeling of solidarity between them. \u201cI haven\u2019t mentioned Stiles since, so she doesn\u2019t know that I like him or that we\u2019re hanging out tonight. So, you see why I can\u2019t go to Mom or Dad and ask them? I mean, we\u2019ve had the sex talk, but it\u2019s not like they described this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal,\u201d Laura says, her voice half-amused and half-understanding. \u201cYou\u2019ve never felt this before?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNot with Kate or Paige. No one?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Derek asks.\n\u201cIt just means interesting,\u201d Laura replies. \u201cLook, you just really really like Stiles, and so does your wolf, so all of you is on board. You\u2019re getting the urge to mark and claim. It\u2019s perfectly natural, and doesn\u2019t hit until puberty.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Derek drawls. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Derek. You\u2019re just a late bloomer; I wanted to mark a guy in my algebra class in the eighth grade. We ended up making out under the bleachers in P.E. Mom was kinda mortified. I thought it was funny.\u201d Derek snorts, but then realizes what this new information means. Maybe his crush on Stiles is a bit more serious than he realized, which is kind of troubling.\n\u201cI\u2019m not good at this, Laura. I mean, today he was talking to me and it just suddenly got ten times worse, like he was just oozing his scent everywhere, and it was all I could do not to maul him.\u201d\n\u201cHe likes you, too.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he does. That ten times worse thing? He\u2019s giving off some strong pheromones, and your wolf knows that he\u2019s interested.\u201d\n\u201cI swear, Laura, if you\u2019re fucking with me, I will \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Laura cuts in. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mess with you about something like this. You called me to ask for advice. That\u2019s a biggy.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d\n*\n\u201cDude, you okay?\u201d Stiles asks when he walks up to Derek outside of the arcade. Derek had told his mom he was going to the arcade, so he hadn\u2019t lied. He just failed to tell her who he was going with. Cora was borrowing his car for the night so she could go out with her friends, and Derek had been freaking out since she dropped him off. He had surreptitiously sniffed his armpits when he saw Stiles drive up to make sure he hadn\u2019t sweated through all his deodorant. He felt clammy and gross, and Stiles had just gotten there. \u201cYou look a little\u2026weird.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Derek says. Stiles shrugs and follows Derek inside. \nA few regulars wave at Derek, and Stiles watches him with interest, but remains quiet as Derek goes to the change machine and gets ten dollars worth of quarters.\n\u201cWe need a bucket,\u201d Stiles says as he watches Derek collect the quarters and put them in his pockets. \u201cLike those old ladies you see on TV at the slots in Vegas.\u201d He grins, and Derek scoops quarters into Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cAww, are you buying my games?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting the next round,\u201d Derek says, and he tries to ignore the way Stiles blushes slightly.\n\u201cSo, what first?\u201d Stiles asks as they walk through the myriad games. There are aisles of different kinds of games, with newer games up front, racing games along the right wall, DDR on the left. The lighting is dim, and the room is filled with the incessant sound of computerized beeps. \u201cIs there Donkey Kong? Ooh, or what about Pac Man?\u201d \n\u201cBoth.\u201d\n\u201cPac Man! Can we play Pac Man?\u201d Stiles asks eagerly, and Derek nods, a small smile tugging at his mouth. He leads Stiles to the back of the arcade, where rows of vintage game consoles are set up. Stiles walks by them slowly, his mouth open as he touches them reverently. \u201cHow have I never been here before? I\u2019ve wasted my youth, wasted it, Derek.\u201d\nDerek relaxes. He feels ridiculously pleased that Stiles is so impressed by the vintage games instead of thinking Derek is lame. He has a PS4 at home, along with an XBox and Wii, but he\u2019s always loved old games. He goes to his old NES before his PS4, and he spent endless hours standing in front of these machines growing up, and they helped him through every problem he\u2019s ever had with their repetitive actions and mindless puzzles. \nWhen they get to Derek\u2019s favorite Pac-Man machine, he leans against the side as Stiles slides quarters into it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually played a real arcade game,\u201d Stiles says as he fondles the joystick lightly. Derek shifts uncomfortably, the sight of Stiles\u2019 fingers brushing across the controls insanely hot. \nStiles hits the start button, and Derek watches him play. He makes it through the first few levels, but he\u2019s pretty terrible. Derek remains silent and just watches the look of concentration on Stiles\u2019 face, the way his tongue sticks between his lips, the quiet way he curses under his breath. \u201cDude, this is awesome,\u201d Stiles says as he hits a power pellet and goes after the enemies. \u201cTake that suckas,\u201d Stiles yells as Pac-Man eats two of them.\nStiles makes it to level sixteen before he loses all his lives. \u201cThat was awesome, right?\u201d Stiles turns to him and asks excitedly. \u201cI did great, right? Tell me how awesome I was.\u201d\n\u201cYou did okay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay? Do you see that score? I believe that\u2019s over a hundred thousand.\u201d\nDerek steps up to the game, pushing Stiles out of the way with his hip. Stiles barely budges, stays right in Derek\u2019s personal space. It\u2019s nothing but peaches and cinnamon, and Derek\u2019s hand shakes slightly as he slips the quarters in the machine.\n\u201cHow good are you at this?\u201d Stiles asks. He\u2019s pushed up against Derek\u2019s back, his chin hovering as he watches over Derek\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s nothing but firm heat, and the proximity is making Derek\u2019s heart do funny things in his chest. \u201cProbably pretty good, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Derek hits start with a smirk. He\u2019s totally going to show off for Stiles. \nStiles spends the first half hour glued to Derek\u2019s back, and at first Derek thinks it would be distracting, but he finds it comforting. He relaxes into the feel of Stiles\u2019 warmth behind him, relishes the feeling of his body so close. Stiles moves over to the side of the machine and starts fidgeting as Derek starts closing in on an hour, and then Stiles disappears for a few minutes and returns with a soda and candy.\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t lost a life?\u201d Stiles asks, behind Derek once again. \n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making me look bad,\u201d Stiles says, nibbling on the end of a Twizzler. \u201cYou had me thinking I did well when I played.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot more practice.\u201d\n\u201cWant a Twizzler?\u201d Stiles asks a few minutes later. He holds the bag out under Derek\u2019s nose, but Derek doesn\u2019t miss a beat. He turns Pac-Man around a corner, easily missing Clyde before he touches him.\n\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Derek replies distractedly. \n\u201cYou know, Twizzlers are the best candy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Derek almost gets eaten by an enemy, and quickly turns around and goes the other way.\nStiles says, \u201cThey make mouths happy.\u201d He leans closer, his lips hovering right beside Derek\u2019s ear. \u201cThey\u2019re not the only things that make mouths happy.\u201d Stiles sways just enough so that his lips brush Derek\u2019s ear on the last word, and Derek loses all his concentration and totally runs directly into Blinky.\nHe looks over at Stiles, who\u2019s oh-so-innocently sucking on a Twizzler. Derek grips the sides of the machine to keep himself from shoving Stiles up against it and rubbing himself all over Stiles. And the thought of pressing Stiles up against the machine, while Stiles\u2019 lips are wrapped around the Twizzler\u2026\n\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles smirks. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Derek shakes his head and turns back to the game, but suddenly, he\u2019s not so interested in it anymore. He kills himself on purpose. Stiles pushes himself up against Derek again under the guise of staring at the high score screen.\nStiles slaps him gently. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you had the highest score! You don\u2019t play fair.\u201d\n\u201cAre you impressed?\u201d Derek asks, eyebrow arched.\n\u201cOh yeah. You are the Pac-Man.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes and walks away before he drowns in Stiles. Though, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s drowning already.\n*\nDerek watches Stiles play Donkey Kong, and then they play Skee ball and a racing game with Stiles\u2019 ten dollars after they spend Derek\u2019s money. When they\u2019ve spent their last quarter, they grab burgers at the diner next door, and then Stiles offers Derek a ride when he mentions calling Cora to pick him up. Derek hesitates, worried about his mom, but he doesn\u2019t exactly want to leave Stiles yet. And she can\u2019t stop them from being friends. \n\u201cI had fun tonight,\u201d Stiles says when they\u2019re in the Jeep, driving out of town towards the Preserve. \u201cI\u2019m so going back to the arcade as soon as I can. Scott would love that place.\u201d\nDerek tries not to feel jealous that Stiles wants to take someone else, and fails miserably. \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201d\n\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll take you somewhere I like,\u201d Stiles says. He shifts slightly in his seat, and Derek smells peaches and cinnamon. \u201cYou know, if you want, or whatever.\u201d\nDerek looks down at his hands to hide his grin. \u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great.\u201d\nThey talk about school, lacrosse, and music the rest of the way to Derek\u2019s house, and Derek\u2019s reluctant to leave when Stiles rolls to a stop in the driveway. But no matter what Laura had said, and despite the mild flirting, Derek\u2019s still not convinced Stiles likes him as more than a friend. And Derek might just be a bit of a coward.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you Monday?\u201d Stiles says, and Derek nods as he opens the Jeep\u2019s passenger side door.\n\u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d \nDerek shuts the door and then smiles at Stiles through the glass. Stiles gives him a small wave, and then Derek hurries across the yard. When he\u2019s inside the house, he leans back against the door, a ridiculous grin across his face.\nBut suddenly, the sound of feet running across the yard and a pounding heartbeat slices through his good mood. Derek\u2019s immediately on alert, and he yanks open the door and is confused when he finds Stiles jogging up the stairs onto the porch. \nWithout a word, Stiles cups Derek\u2019s face in both his hands and kisses him. His lips are soft and hesitant, and his hands are warm and clammy. Derek can feel Stiles\u2019 heart pounding through his palms, and the worry from moments before has morphed into surprise and excitement. The kiss is chaste, but it makes Derek\u2019s body alight with sensation until he\u2019s tingling all over. He\u2019s completely surrounded by Stiles, and it\u2019s the best feeling in the world. He settles his hands on Stiles\u2019 hips as he leans into further the kiss. \nStiles pulls away too soon, his eyes bright even in the dark. There\u2019s a faint flush to his cheeks and he keeps his eyes open as he slowly pecks Derek on the lips once more before running off the porch and back to the Jeep. Stiles waves before he cranks the Jeep and drives down the driveway. \nDerek stands on the porch, watching until the taillights have long disappeared and the scent of peaches and cinnamon has disappeared.\n*\nThe next morning, his mother walks into the kitchen while Derek is fixing himself a bowl of cereal.\n\u201cHave a good time last night?\u201d she asks as she crosses to the coffee pot.\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cDid Stiles?\u201d\nDerek looks up at his mother warily as he sets the box of cereal aside. \u201cYes.\u201d\nTalia sighs, her lips a thin line as she cradles the mug in her hands. \u201cSo, you totally ignored what I said and decided to date him anyway?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not dating,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWe just hung out. It was nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that kiss on the porch was nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou were spying on me?\u201d Derek yells.\n\u201cNo, I heard you come home. When I came downstairs, you were on the porch.\u201d Talia shakes her head. \u201cI still don\u2019t like the idea of you two dating. What if it gets serious?\u201d\nDerek heaves an aggrieved sigh and rolls his eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re jumping the gun a little bit, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cBeing around him is going to mean thinking about what you\u2019re doing all the time,\u201d Talia says as she sits on a stool at the kitchen island. \u201cHolding back your strength, your speed \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cI do that at school every day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder when you get comfortable with someone,\u201d Talia says. \u201cOr what if you put him in danger? Hunters, other supernatural creatures. Dating him puts him in danger, makes him a target.\u201d Derek crosses his arms across his chest and glares at the floor. \u201cOne day, Derek, when you have your own family to protect, you\u2019ll understand why these things are important. Right now, you\u2019re a teenager and it\u2019s just hormones and new instincts. I know you like Stiles, but it is dangerous. I just want you to think about that, okay?\u201d\nDerek does look up when she\u2019s finished, and after she exits the kitchen, he leaves his breakfast untouched and runs outside, stripping off his shirt and shifting before he takes off into the woods.\n*\nDerek skips lunch on Monday, and instead goes to the library. He curls up in a musty armchair in the back by the window with a book. He ignores the texts from Isaac and Stiles. He just can\u2019t face Stiles, not today.\nHis mom spent all weekend trying to explain to him why she objected to him dating Stiles. She told him he was going to college in a few months, and Stiles still had a year of high school left. She tried to get him to understand how dangerous bringing humans unfamiliar with the supernatural into close contact with their world was, emphasizing how dangerous it was to keep Stiles in the dark. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to wolf out the first time you have sex,\u201d she\u2019d told him Sunday afternoon. At Derek\u2019s horrified face, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural, honey. When you get close to orgasm, your instincts will take over, and it will be very difficult to control yourself. Even if you don\u2019t shift, there\u2019s the danger of fangs or claws, or your eyes at the very least.\u201d\nDerek had left the room, because while wolves were more open sexually, he was not talking to his mother about wolfing out during sex with Stiles. Just. No.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to mark and scent him,\u201d she had continued later. \u201cTo claim him so other werewolves will know he\u2019s yours. Sometimes, if the attraction is strong enough, wolves feel the need to scent before they\u2019ve had sex. It\u2019s rare, though.\u201d\nNow that caught Derek\u2019s attention. \u201cWhy?\u201d Derek asked. Laura had made the urge to scent sound common and normal. His mom made it sound like some freak occurrence.\n\u201cSome people think of it as finding your soul mate, your one true love or something like that.\u201d Talia shook her head dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous, of course. Werewolves don\u2019t mate. But sometimes you\u2019ll meet someone that your wolf instinctually wants, and you\u2019ll feel the urge to scent before anything\u2019s happened. It\u2019s even worse if the attraction is mutual.\u201d Then Talia looked at Derek sharply. Suspiciously, she asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever told me that before,\u201d he answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was a thing.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Talia said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt that before. I didn\u2019t feel the need to mark your father until after we\u2019d had sex.\u201d\nThat hadn\u2019t made Derek feel better. If anything, it made him feel worse. \nSo, between his mom telling him all the reasons not to date Stiles, on top of the knowledge that he has some weird uncommon urge to scent Stiles before they\u2019re even dating, Derek just doesn\u2019t feel like seeing him.\nHe doesn\u2019t feel like it on Tuesday either. Wednesday he gets a pass from Coach Finstock to practice during lunch, so that\u2019s where Stiles finds him: on the field behind the school during lunch. Derek smells him the moment he steps onto the field, and he just runs faster and slings the ball into the goal.\n\u201cAnd the crowd goes wild!\u201d Stiles exclaims as he approaches Derek. \nThree days away from Stiles has not made it easier to see him. In fact, it\u2019s made it worse. He has to close his eyes and hide his nose in the crook of his arm to get his wits about him. When Derek lowers his arm, Stiles is looking at him with a pained expression. Derek wants to run over to him and kiss him until he\u2019s smiling again. Instead, he just leans on his lacrosse stick. \n\u201cDid I do something wrong Friday night?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI mean, I know it wasn\u2019t a date, but I thought with the touching and the kissing and the fact that you didn\u2019t punch me in the face when I did that thing against your ear that you were on the same page as me.\u201d \nDerek hates how vulnerable Stiles looks, with his hands stuffed into the pockets of his jeans and his shoulders slumped forward. Derek sighs and runs a hand through his sweaty hair. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you been coming to lunch? Or answering my texts?\u201d\nDerek honestly doesn\u2019t know how to answer. Or what to do. Every instinct he has is telling him to rush towards Stiles and carry him somewhere and not to leave for days. But those same instincts are telling him to be careful, are listening to his mother\u2019s \u2013 his Alpha\u2019s \u2013 words. \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026complicated.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 brow creases, and he says, \u201cHow is it complicated? You\u2019re gay, right? Is this a high school gay coming out crisis? I know you don\u2019t date like ever, but I just assumed \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Derek interrupts. \u201cThere are just\u2026complications. And I don\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d He trails off, all his words lost. He doesn\u2019t know what to say on a good day, and right now, right now with Stiles looking at him like that, he\u2019s completely lost.\n\u201cComplications,\u201d Stiles says with narrowed eyes. \u201cYeah, okay, whatever.\u201d He turns around and stalks off the field, and Derek doesn\u2019t stop him.\n*\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you called a, what did you call it, emergency Wolf Moot?\u201d Danny snickers, and Derek punches him in the arm. \u201cOw, don\u2019t bruise the human, okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Stiles, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Isaac asks. \u201cDerek\u2019s been missing lunch, and Stiles came into the lunchroom late today and he did not look happy.\u201d\n\u201cDid you two break up already?\u201d Erica asks.\nDerek growls and drops his head into his hands. They\u2019re sitting in Danny\u2019s basement because Derek can\u2019t talk about this at his own house, and Danny\u2019s the only other one of them with a werewolf family. It\u2019s easier to talk about these things without the threat of human parents snooping around. Erica\u2019s mom still glares at Derek like she thinks Derek is fucking her daughter on the regular. He thinks it\u2019s unfair Boyd always gets treated nicely by Mrs. Reyes when he is actually fucking her daughter on the regular.\n\u201cMy mom says dating him is a bad idea,\u201d Derek says miserably. \u201cShe\u2019s been trying to convince me for days that human plus sheriff\u2019s son plus werewolves just don\u2019t mix.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rough,\u201d Danny says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to listen to her, right?\u201d Erica asks. \u201cI mean, sure, she\u2019s our Alpha, but like she can\u2019t keep you from dating whoever you want to date. Unless, oh god, she\u2019d didn\u2019t Alpha you to not date Stiles, did she?\u201d\n\u201cNo. She\u2019s not a horrible bitch,\u201d Derek says defensively. She just sure as hell made everything suck for Derek instead. \u201cShe just keeps telling me all the reasons why it won\u2019t work, or how he\u2019ll be in danger, and then mentioning creepy sex things.\u201d They all cringe in unison. He turns to Danny. \u201cAre your parents like this?\u201d\nDanny shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t tell them about the guys I fool around with.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t they smell them on you?\u201d Isaac asks. \nDanny shrugs. \u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m dating Ethan now, and he\u2019s a werewolf. The only thing my mom said was that if Ethan hurt me, she\u2019d rip his throat out.\u201d Danny grins. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t lying either. I think she likes me dating a werewolf. Keeping it in the family, so to speak.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to date a werewolf,\u201d Derek whines. \u201cI want to date Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cThen date Stiles,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cYour mom didn\u2019t forbid it. I think you can keep being a werewolf a secret.\u201d\n\u201cYou do need to stop being a dick to Stiles though,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cHe\u2019s been really upset. I think he really likes you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Erica says.\n\u201cHis body,\u201d Danny says. \u201cStiles has always been a sucker for muscles. He had a crush on me for like two seconds freshman year.\u201d\nDerek glares at Danny, and they all burst out laughing. Derek hates his friends. Actually, right now, Derek just hates everyone.\n*\nThat night, Derek lies in bed and tries to figure out what he\u2019s going to do. The only thing talking to his friends did was make it harder to think of a good reason not to date Stiles. He thinks back to Friday night, to how much fun they had together, to the way Stiles\u2019 lips had felt against his own when they kissed. He thinks about the heat of Stiles\u2019 body under his hand, and what it\u2019d feel like if Stiles had those lips wrapped around his cock, the way Stiles\u2019 skin would look like with a line of marks down his neck.\nDerek shoves his hand inside his underwear and starts jerking his half-hard cock. He thinks about Stiles\u2019 fingers wrapped around it instead of his own, how flush Stiles\u2019 skin would get, the kind of noises he\u2019d make. \nHe comes to the image of Stiles fucking into him, his fingers pressing hard enough into Derek\u2019s hips to leave a bruise.\n*\nStiles looks surprised to see Derek sit down at the lunch table on Thursday. He gives Derek a tentative smile, and Derek gives him a nod in return. Stiles starts talking to Scott, and Derek starts reading American Gods.\nOn Friday, they don\u2019t speak through lunch again, but Derek grabs Stiles\u2019 arm before he walks off. Scott glares at him, but leaves Stiles to talk to Derek when Stiles gives him a nod. Stiles looks at Derek expectantly, and Derek is surrounded by peaches and cinnamon, but it\u2019s laced with the bitter taste of hurt and anger.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nDerek adjusts the bag on his shoulder. \u201cCan we talk after school?\u201d \nStiles watches him for a moment, and then nods. \u201cI\u2019ve got to eat dinner with my dad, he\u2019s been working long hours and I haven\u2019t been able to see him much. But after that.\u201d\n\u201cText me when you\u2019re free?\u201d Stiles nods and then runs to go catch up with Scott.\n*\nIt\u2019s almost eight when Stiles finally texts Derek. He had spent most of the afternoon worried that Stiles wasn\u2019t going to text, and Derek realized he probably deserved it. He just hoped Stiles gave him a chance to make things right.\nThe only thing Derek cared about was Stiles. It\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s cared about all along.\n\nI\u2019m free. Where do you want to meet?\n\n\nThe park on Elm?\n\n\nBe there in twenty.\n\nDerek grabs his letterman jacket and runs a hand through his hair before checking his reflection in the mirror. He decides he looks good enough to meet with Stiles, so he grabs his keys, yells into the living room that he is meeting up with some friends, and then leaves.\nStiles is already there when Derek pulls into the parking lot at the park. He\u2019s leaning against the hood of his Jeep, red hoodie zipped all the way against the cold. Derek parks his Camaro next to Stiles and then gets out.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says awkwardly. \n\u201cHey.\u201d\nStiles leads the way towards the nearby playground, and Derek follows. Now that he has Stiles in front of him, he realizes he should have thought about what he was going to say, maybe even prepared a speech. \nStiles goes over to the jungle gym and sits along one of the edges. He winds his arms around bars on either side of him and leans back. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d he asks, his face betraying nothing.\nDerek extends his arm and leans his weight against a bar next to Stiles\u2019 head. He\u2019s standing in front of him and looking down into his face. \u201cI\u2019ve been a dick.\u201d\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice is half-mocking, half-resignation.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles frowns. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care.\u201d He reaches out and cups Stiles\u2019 face, rubbing his thumb along the strong line of his jaw. Stiles leans into the touch. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d\nStiles suddenly jerks away, and he climbs higher up the monkey bars. \u201cSo, that\u2019s it then?\u201d he yells down as he ascends. \u201cAll of a sudden, you want to be together and I\u2019m just supposed to fall into your muscular arms and forget the last week.\u201d\n\u201cStiles, no.\u201d Derek huffs and starts up the bars after him. \n\u201cBecause you really hurt me, Derek.\u201d Stiles is at the top of the jungle gym, and he\u2019s staring down at Derek not bothering to hide the pain and anger he feels. \u201cI think it was pretty obvious how much I liked you. Do you know how much balls it took me to run back onto your porch that night?\u201d Stiles glances up at the sky and shakes his head. \u201cI wanted to kiss you so bad all night, and I thought maybe you\u2019d get a clue and do it first. But you just stood there and played Pac-Man, and then you were gonna call your sister to pick you up. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even sure if you liked me, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cHow could you not tell?\u201d Derek asks, climbing up a few more bars. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty obvious.\u201d\nStiles snorts. \u201cNothing with you is obvious, Derek. Except how annoying you find me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t find you annoying,\u201d Derek says quietly, and Stiles gives him his best dubious face. \u201cOkay, you drive me absolutely crazy. In every way imaginable.\u201d\nStiles smiles. It\u2019s not his usual wide, cocky grin. It\u2019s smaller, more intimate and shy. He\u2019s worrying his bottom lip, and Derek can tell that he\u2019s thinking. Then, Stiles hooks his legs over a bar and hangs upside down. His shirt falls down to his armpits, revealing the long line of his torso. Derek just stares at the pale flesh and the dark line of hair leading beneath plaid boxers. Hastily, Stiles covers himself and shoves his shirt inside his pants.\nThere it is again, that strong scent that has become synonymous with Stiles. Derek inhales and leans forward, ducking under a bar so he can get closer to Stiles\u2019 mouth.\n\u201cSo, you like me?\u201d Stiles asks from where he\u2019s hanging upside down. He looks ridiculous, but Derek finds him so endearing, and his wolf is nearly vibrating with pleasure at Stiles being so close in front of him. \nDerek nods, and he leans closer to Stiles\u2019 face, bending slightly to look into his eyes. \u201cI like you a lot.\u201d Stiles smiles, and his face lights up so much that it\u2019s nearly blinding Derek. It\u2019s all he can do to control himself enough only to lean forward and kiss Stiles instead of plastering himself all over him. \nIf Derek thought Stiles smelled good, then he tastes fucking amazing. The angle is weird since Stiles is hanging from his knees, but Derek cradles the back of his head and threads his fingers into Stiles\u2019 soft hair. When Stiles\u2019 tongue slips into his mouth for the first time, Derek moans and lifts his other hand to cup Stiles\u2019 face. He ends up running his thumb along the underside of his jaw.\nWhen they break apart, Derek\u2019s breathless. He stares at Stiles like he\u2019s everything in the world, and Derek\u2019s pretty sure that he is. Stiles looks shy and happy, and then he starts laughing quietly. Derek smiles down at him as he watches him.\n\u201cDude, you just Spiderman-ed me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek\u2019s brows knit together in confusion.\nStiles reaches up and grabs a higher bar to pull himself upright. \u201cUpside down kissing. You Spiderman-ed me.\u201d He grins. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork.\u201d\nThat\u2026is not the reaction Derek expects. Now that Stiles has said it, Derek remembers the scene. But honestly, a comic book movie from over a decade ago was the last thing Derek had been thinking of. Derek was trying to be romantic; he doesn\u2019t know why, but it feels like a rejection.\nWordlessly, Derek starts climbing down the bars. \u201cDerek, wait! I was just joking!\u201d Derek jumps the last few feet, landing perfectly on the ground. He doesn\u2019t turn around as he walks away, trying to shake his embarrassment and the pang he feels. \u201cDerek! Stupid fucking - shit!\u201d\nDerek turns around just as Stiles tumbles from the side of the monkey bars to the ground. Derek\u2019s by his side in a flash, and he drops to his knees and touches Stiles\u2019 arms. \u201cStiles, are you okay?\u201d He\u2019s freaking out, terrified that Stiles broke something.\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles groans, pushing himself up on one elbow. \u201cJust a bit of wounded pride. Faceplanting isn\u2019t exactly sexy.\u201d Derek frowns, and Stiles reaches out and pokes at the corners of his mouth. \u201cNo frown. You should be smiling. Because I don\u2019t know about you, but that was like the best kiss ever. Granted, I only have one other to choose from, but I\u2019m pretty sure it trumps just about every other kiss ever.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were making fun of me,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cFor kissing you like that.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles laughs, shaking his head. \u201cI am absolutely not making fun of you. Do you even know me? How is being kissed kinda like a Marvel movie by the most amazing guy not the most awesome thing to ever happen to me? Do you know how many fantasies I\u2019ve had where I\u2019ve gotten Spidey-kissed? Okay, not that many, but I have had them, and you just \u2013 \u201c\nDerek cuts off his rambling by leaning forward and kissing him again. Stiles tries to talk for a few seconds, but then grips the back of Derek\u2019s neck and pulls him on top of him. Derek doesn\u2019t care that they\u2019re lying in the dirt by the monkey bars at a public park. \nHe\u2019s kissing Stiles, and it\u2019s perfect.\n*\nThey text all weekend. About stupid things like how Stiles is pretty sure there\u2019s a gnome eating the cookies in the kitchen, and how he can\u2019t decide if the pants he\u2019s wearing have been worn twice or like fifteen times without washing. He even details to Derek the state of the holes in his socks. Derek tells Stiles that there\u2019s a gnome named Cora in his house that steals his socks and t-shirts, and that his mom is making mashed potatoes for dinner, which he secretly hates. \n\nWho hates mashed potatoes? I don\u2019t think we can be boyfriends anymore.\n\nDerek stares at the text for ten minutes before he responds. I\u2019m your boyfriend?\n\nWell, I was kinda hoping. If you don\u2019t want to be labeled, that\u2019s cool. We can just kiss and be not-boyfriends. I\u2019ll take anything. I\u2019m not picky.\n\nDerek frowns at that. Stiles deserves a boyfriend and to get what he wants, and he tells him so. Stiles texts back, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve been taken over by an alien, bc you can\u2019t be real. Derek tells Stiles that he\u2019s the one that\u2019s too good to be true.\nMaybe Derek feels a bit like a sap when he hits send, but Stiles doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Derek\u2019s riding a high of endorphins and hormones; if he wants to tell his boyfriend lame things about how great he is, then dammit, he\u2019s going to do it.\nDerek\u2019s still grinning Monday morning when he gets to school. Stiles is waiting for him in the student parking lot, and Derek can\u2019t believe that any of this is real. \nHe\u2019s never had the best luck with dating. There was Paige, but she moved after they\u2019d only been going together for a few months, and then there was almost Kate, but that had just been an elaborate ruse that could have easily ended in disaster. He knew that most of the student body wanted to sleep with him \u2013 he was well aware of how people perceived his looks \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t interested in that. He wanted someone interested in him. Derek wasn\u2019t popular, didn\u2019t have a lot of friends. Despite his looks, most of his classmates were afraid of him, or thought he was weird. On more occasions than one he\u2019d heard people refer to him as a serial killer or sociopath. He was more than okay with everyone leaving him alone. As long as he got to play lacrosse and baseball, and he graduated, he didn\u2019t really care about high school.\nBut Stiles wasn\u2019t like that. Sure, Stiles was annoying and teased him and drove him nuts and thought he was hot, but Stiles also understood Derek\u2019s love of books and didn\u2019t think he was weird that his favorite place was a vintage arcade. Stiles had searched out a short book chapter. Just for him.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Stiles says when Derek gets out of the car. He reaches into the front of the Jeep and pulls out a bottle of Dr. Pepper. \u201cI know it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d\nDerek takes it from him before sliding his arms around Stiles\u2019 waist and kissing him deeply. Stiles curls his fingers into Derek\u2019s shoulders, gripping him tightly as his tongue explores Derek\u2019s mouth. \u201cI missed you, too,\u201d Stiles mumbles against his mouth. He laughs.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get enough of that Friday night,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of kissing you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m okay with that.\u201d\n\u201cEw, Stiles, really?\u201d Derek turns to find Scott staring at them with his nose crinkled. Isaac\u2019s beside him smirking. Derek just slides his arms further around Stiles\u2019 waist and hugs him closer to his body. \u201cYou\u2019re in the parking lot. If you\u2019re gonna make out before school, do it in one of your cars like everyone else, duh.\u201d\nDerek laughs and presses his face into the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck. It still smells faintly like him from the other night, and Derek nuzzles his face against the soft skin. Stiles\u2019 smell is so concentrated right here, and Derek wants to lick the skin, but he refrains. He doesn\u2019t pull away until he hears someone clear their throat, and he turns around to find Cora, Erica, Boyd, and Danny watching him in amusement. \n\u201cWell, I guess we won\u2019t need any more Wolf Moots,\u201d Erica says.\n\u201cAt least not for the same reason.\u201d Danny smirks and walks into the school.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Stiles asks. Reluctantly, Derek lets Stiles go, which is probably a good thing since he\u2019s halfway to popping a boner and it\u2019s not even first period yet. \u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cMy friends are weird.\u201d Derek reaches down and grabs Stiles\u2019 hand, lacing their fingers together. Stiles looks so pleased that Derek just has to kiss him one more time before school.\n\u201cIs this how they\u2019re going to be from now on?\u201d Isaac asks Scott from behind them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Stiles has never had a boyfriend,\u201d Scott responds. Stiles drops his forehead to Derek\u2019s shoulder and groans in embarrassment, and Derek kisses the side of his head.\n*\n\u201cYou might want to tone down the public displays of marking,\u201d Cora whispers when she finds Derek between third and fourth period. \u201cCause I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re still not telling Mom.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t planning on it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you probably should know that you reek of Stiles,\u201d she says, wrinkling her nose. \u201cI mean, Mom knows that you\u2019re friends with him, but she\u2019s gonna get suspicious if you start coming home every day smelling like Stiles rubbed himself all over you.\u201d\nDerek shoves Cora affectionately, and she growls before swiping at his head. It\u2019s their own personal brand of I love you.\n*\nDerek doesn\u2019t know how he made it through lacrosse practice for the past two years without noticing Stiles. Sure, Stiles and Scott warm the bench, but Derek had never looked at them before. Now, it\u2019s nearly impossible to do anything at practice. Derek\u2019s eyes follow Stiles as he runs laps around the field, tracks him as he does drills across the grass. A part of Derek wants to chase him through the woods while Stiles tries to outrun him, let him think he\u2019s winning until he leaps and catches his prey. \n\u201cYou might have a bit of drool,\u201d Boyd says when he comes up beside Derek. \u201cJust there.\u201d He pokes Derek in the chin, and Derek swipes his hand away.\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\nBoyd laughs, and Danny runs over after finishing the drill he\u2019d been doing. \u201cStaring at Stilinski\u2019s cute little ass isn\u2019t within the practice guidelines.\u201d Derek tries to hit Danny with his crosse, but Danny ducks. \u201cI mean, the guy does have a nice ass.\u201d Danny turns around to stare appreciatively, and Derek growls possessively. Danny just laughs. \u201cUh-oh, I\u2019ve provoked the wolf. I better watch out.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you even still alive?\u201d Boyd asks, shaking his head.\n\u201cOnly human in an entire house of werewolves,\u201d Danny says, walking backwards towards the field. \u201cYou learn mad survival skills after awhile.\u201d He pokes Derek in the gut with his crosse, and Derek chases Danny out onto the field. Danny gets back into the goal, and Derek figures he should do something in practice other than stare at Stiles. When Stiles sees him from where he\u2019s standing in line to practice shots, he gives Derek an awkward wave. Derek waves back, and he hears Danny say under his breath, \u201cUgh, get a room.\u201d\nDerek makes sure to tackle Danny at least five times during the rest of practice. He\u2019s not content until Danny\u2019s bleeding at least a little bit.\n*\nCoach calls Derek and Jackson into his office after practice to talk about strategy for their first game in a few weeks, and then he lets Jackson leave and gives Derek a speech about how it\u2019s his senior year, and this is the most important season of his life. Derek spends the entire speech trying to figure out which movie he lifted it from.\nBy the time he leaves Finstock\u2019s office, the locker room is clear. Derek goes over to his locker and opens it up as he grabs the collar of his shirt and pulls it over his head.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Derek yanks the shirt off and finds Stiles standing beside him, dressed in his regular clothes again. He\u2019s sweaty, Derek can smell it clinging to his skin, so he presses Stiles up against the lockers and licks from the base of his neck all the way up along the side. Stiles squirms beneath him, and the scent of peaches and cinnamon strong behind his ear. \u201cOh god, oh god,\u201d Stiles repeats.\nDerek pulls away, his eyes a bit glazed over. He realizes this is going to be a problem, his one track mind where Stiles is concerned. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cThis is about to turn into every locker room fantasy I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cExcept in my fantasies Coach wasn\u2019t so close that he could probably see through the window if he wasn\u2019t playing Candy Crush on his phone.\u201d\nDerek smiles and jams his hands under Stiles\u2019 t-shirt. He kisses his temple before licking the sweat from the skin there. But then he pulls away and says, \u201cWait, you\u2019ve had locker room fantasies about me?\u201d\nStiles\u2019 face flushes a deep red, and he looks anywhere except at Derek. \u201cWell, I mean\u2026it\u2019s not like I was creeping on you in the shower or anything. But, I have eyes, and sometimes those eyes didn\u2019t miss it when you were changing.\u201d\nThe room is suddenly very hot. Derek thinks about Stiles watching him change clothes, watching him shower, then going home and jerking himself on his bed. Those thoughts, combined with the salty taste of Stiles on his tongue and the strong scent of sweat that\u2019s laced with arousal coming from Stiles, has Derek\u2019s claws coming out and his fangs poking against his gums. He moans at the way his body is picking up extra sensations with the shift, making it even harder to control himself, but Stiles takes it differently.\n\u201cDo you like that, Derek?\u201d he says quietly, his voice gravelly and low. It\u2019s quite possibly the hottest thing Derek\u2019s ever heard, and it\u2019s doing nothing to reign in his wolf. \u201cDo you want me to tell you about touching myself while I thought of you doing it instead?\u201d Stiles drops his hand low and cups Derek through his shorts. \u201cNo cup?\u201d Stiles asks as he slips his hand inside the front of Derek\u2019s shorts and beneath the band of his under armour. He squeezes Derek\u2019s cock, and Derek presses his hands against the lockers as he rolls his head against Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cBallsy, literally.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Derek growls, and this is going to get out of hand if Derek doesn\u2019t get ahold of himself. \u201cI don\u2019t wear a cup during practice,\u201d he says, trying to deflect some of his attention away from Stiles\u2019 hand on his cock. \u201cJust during games.\u201d\n\u201cSo hot,\u201d Stiles breathes into his ear as he rubs Derek\u2019s hardening dick, and then from somewhere behind them a door opens. Derek hears Finstock swear under his breath, and he\u2019s off Stiles and around the row of lockers in a flash. He braces himself on his knees, watching as his claws retract. His dick is hard and straining against his shorts, but he\u2019s far less concerned about that than the wolf problem.\n\u201cBilinski! What in the hell are you still doing here?\u201d\n\u201cHad some trouble with, uh, the thing, coach,\u201d Stiles answers, and Derek shakes his head. Stiles is a terrible liar.\n\u201cWell, get the hell out of here. Have you seen Hale?\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019s already left.\u201d\n\u201cHis clothes are still in his locker.\u201d\nStiles laughs awkwardly. \u201cSo they are. Hey, I didn\u2019t know this was Derek\u2019s locker. Why in the world has he left it open? He\u2019s a weirdo, coach. W-E-I-R-D-O.\u201d\n\u201cBilinski, what in the hell are you talking about? If you see Hale, tell him to drop by my office. And stop creeping around an empty locker room like a fungus. You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d\nStiles comes around the lockers, laughing. \u201cDude, you should have seen how fast you ran away. Scared of being caught and not being the golden boy anymore?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d\nStiles grins and comes up to Derek to kiss him on the mouth briefly. \u201cMy dad\u2019s got the night shift tonight, which was what I was going to tell you before somebody distracted me. No interruptions there, no creepy coach walking in on us.\u201d\nDerek hesitates, worried about wolfing out again if he\u2019s with Stiles. Stiles notices it, and he takes a few steps back and puts his hands in his pockets, a clear defensive gesture. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s cool. I mean, I\u2019ve got a lot of homework anyway, so \u2013 \u201c\nDerek grabs Stiles\u2019 arm and tugs him close and kisses him. \u201cShut up. I\u2019d love to come over. Let me shower, and then I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\nStiles grins and walks backward a few steps, tripping over one of the benches. \u201cDon\u2019t jerk off in the shower, okay? I have plans for later, Derek. Plans.\u201d\nDerek pulls off his practice shorts and throws them at Stiles\u2019 head when he stares at him standing there in his underwear. \u201cGo home, jerkface.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a \u2013 you\u2019re the jerk\u2026butt,\u201d Stiles finishes when Derek turns around and takes off the under armour, leaving his bare ass for Stiles to see. \n\u201cStop staring like you haven\u2019t seen it before,\u201d Derek laughs as he walks towards the showers. \u201cGo home, Stiles. I mean it.\u201d\n\u201cYou are so getting it tonight.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Derek calls behind him. \nHe takes a cold shower, standing under the spray for far too long, trying to get his wolf under control. \n*\nStiles doesn\u2019t even pretend sex isn\u2019t the only thing on his mind when Derek arrives at his house. He grabs Derek\u2019s hand as soon as he closes the front door and starts kissing him. Somehow, they make it upstairs and onto Stiles\u2019 bed.\nDerek wants to roll around in Stiles\u2019 bed forever. Not only is his smell concentrated there, but Derek wants to leave his own scent there mingled with Stiles. \n\u201cThis is going to be embarrassingly fast,\u201d Stiles says as he pulls off his shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve been hard since I left the locker room.\u201d\nDerek tries to take it slow, to touch and taste as much as Stiles as possible. But Stiles is impatient, and he\u2019s pulling at Derek\u2019s clothes and making little needy noises in the back of his throat. \u201cDerek, I have waited nearly seventeen years to lose my v-card, and you are evil for making me wait even longer.\u201d\n\u201cWait, huh?\u201d Derek pushes himself up on his elbows. They\u2019ve both stripped down to their underwear, and Derek is lying on top of Stiles. \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin?\u201d\n\u201cI thought that part was pretty obvious,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDid you miss the part where I told you that you were my first kiss?\u201d Derek\u2019s brow creases as he thinks back to the other night, and he vaguely remembers Stiles hinting at it. \u201cWhat, why do you have on thinky-brow?\u201d Stiles pokes at Derek\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cNo thinky-brow. You need sexy-brow. Don\u2019t ask me how you do sexy-brow, but you do. I think your eyebrows have a mind of their own, and why the fuck are we talking about your eyebrows? We should be talking about my dick. It\u2019s lovely, I promise.\u201d\nDerek laughs and leans down to kiss Stiles again. It\u2019s a slow kiss, and no matter how much Stiles tries to hurry it up or rub himself on Derek, he won\u2019t let him. \u201cUgh, you\u2019re evil, do you know that?\u201d\nDerek smirks and moves to Stiles\u2019 neck and begins peppering kisses there. Then, he bites into the skin at the juncture of his shoulder and neck, and Stiles moans. \u201cFuck, Derek, just, ohmigod,\u201d Stiles rambles as Derek sucks a mark into his skin. He pulls off and surveys his work, sees the deep maroon bruise against Stiles\u2019 pale skin. He has to take a few deep breaths to keep himself from covering all of Stiles in similar marks, though breathing in doesn\u2019t make it that much easier.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Stiles asks, cupping Derek\u2019s face in his palms. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda zoning out and staring at my sheets, and while I love these sheets, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not as interesting as me.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Derek says as he starts kissing Stiles again. This time, he lets Stiles go as fast as he wants, and the next thing Derek knows, he\u2019s on his back with Stiles\u2019 mouth on his cock. The pressure of his fangs pushes at his gums, and he\u2019s trying desperately to keep it together. He can do this; he can be in a relationship with Stiles without putting him in danger or revealing himself. \nStiles\u2019 mouth is uncoordinated, but what he lacks in experience he makes up with enthusiasm. His loud slurps fill the room, and it\u2019s sloppy and wet, but his mouth feels so good around Derek\u2019s cock that he doesn\u2019t care. Not that he has a lot to compare it to \u2013 the only other person to have done this was Paige, and that was three years ago.\n\u201cStiles, I\u2019m going to come,\u201d Derek moans, trying to tug Stiles up, but Stiles just grips his cock harder and starts sliding his fist along his shaft as his mouth works faster. Derek is gripping Stiles\u2019 headboard, and his claws are pushing out, so he balls his fists above his head and jerks when Stiles swipes his tongue around the head of his cock, and then he\u2019s coming with a growl.\nHe flops down on the bed bonelessly, and Stiles is still single-mindedly licking the come from his cock. Derek moves a hand into Stiles\u2019 hair, and Stiles lifts his head and nuzzles into Derek\u2019s touch. \n\u201cWas that okay?\u201d Stiles asks from between his legs. Derek cracks one eye open, and Stiles looks fucking debauched. Cheeks flush, hair mussed, lips red and swollen, and fuck, there\u2019s a bit of come in the corner. Derek slides his hand down the side of Stiles\u2019 face and swipes it away with his thumb before slipping his thumb inside Stiles\u2019 mouth. Stiles sucks it eagerly, and Derek\u2019s eyes roll back into his head. \n\u201cYour fucking mouth,\u201d Derek mutters. \u201cCome up here.\u201d Stiles crawls up Derek\u2019s body, and Derek kisses him deeply. He wants to lick every bit of him from Stiles\u2019 mouth, thinks he could get drunk on their tastes mingling. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles breathes when he pulls away. \u201cI did good, then?\u201d\nDerek smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\nLater, after Derek has sucked Stiles off and almost orgasmed again when Stiles\u2019 come hit his tongue (which, as Stiles had predicted, only took about thirty seconds), they lay facing each other with their legs tangled and fingers intertwined. Stiles glances at where Derek\u2019s rubbing his thumb along the back of Stiles\u2019 palm and asks, \u201cWhy did you say it was complicated? What\u2019s complicated about this?\u201d\nDerek sighs. \u201cMy mom\u2026isn\u2019t exactly\u2026happy that we\u2019re together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why? I\u2019ve never even met your mom.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s very\u2026overprotective.\u201d\n\u201cSo, she doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re dating?\u201d\nDerek shakes his head, and Stiles scowls. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, Stiles, I promise,\u201d Derek says, lifting his hand to cup Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. But even if she does find out, I\u2019m going to keep dating you.\u201d Stiles smiles a little at that.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cYou\u2019re the hottest guy at school. Why me?\u201d\nDerek leans forward and noses along Stiles\u2019 cheek. He wishes he could tell Stiles that it\u2019s the way he smells, the way his wolf is content when he\u2019s around, that he doesn\u2019t really understand it himself. Instead, he says, \u201cBecause you found me a short chapter from a book.\u201d\nStiles\u2019 face scrunches in disbelief. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun, I\u2019m being serious.\u201d\n\u201cSo am I.\u201d He kisses Stiles lightly, and Stiles leans back. \n\u201cYou mean, all it took was one google search to get you to like me?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the chapter,\u201d Derek sighs. \u201cIt was what it represents. That you got me. No one\u2019s ever gotten me before.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard,\u201d Stiles whispers conspiratorially. \u201cIt\u2019s not like your nose wasn\u2019t shoved in a book every day at lunch.\u201d\nDerek hooks an arm around Stiles\u2019 waist and flips them onto Stiles\u2019 back and kisses him again.\n*\nDerek reluctantly leaves Stiles\u2019 house a little after nine, and as soon as he\u2019s in the car, he calls Laura.\nDerek asks, \u201cHow do you cover up the smell of sex?\u201d\nLaura laughs for five minutes.\n*\nCora keeps her mouth shut about Stiles, Laura helps him figure out how to hide what he and Stiles are doing, and Stiles is amazing. Derek is on top of the world.\n\u201cDerek, you\u2019re kinda freaking me out,\u201d Isaac says when Derek drops into his seat at lunch Thursday. When Derek looks at him, he and Scott are watching him like they\u2019re waiting for him to attack or something.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek snaps.\n\u201cDude, you were smiling,\u201d Scott says. \u201cFourth day in a row. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d Isaac finishes.\nBeside him, Stiles collapses on Derek\u2019s shoulder in a fit of laughter. Isaac and Scott start laughing too, and when Derek glares at them, that just causes them to laugh harder.\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cYour face looks all wrong with a smile.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to them,\u201d Stiles laughs from where his face is still buried on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYour smile is sexy.\u201d Stiles kisses his cheek, and Isaac and Scott shake their head. \nDerek doesn\u2019t mind lunch so much anymore. Derek\u2019s still anti-social and reads instead of talking to everyone, and Stiles doesn\u2019t mind as long as Derek lets him lay against him somehow. Derek listens to his iPod with Stiles\u2019 warm body pressed against him like a pleasant buzzing in the background. Stiles talks with the others and tosses Cheetos at Jackson. Sometimes Stiles backseat reads and pulls Derek\u2019s earbud from his ear and makes commentary on passages he has no context for. Derek grunts and covers Stiles\u2019 face with his hand as he pushes him away and replaces his earbud.\nAll in all, it\u2019s not so bad.\nSaturday, Stiles comes with Derek to the lacrosse field so Derek can practice. \u201cYou should be practicing, too,\u201d Derek tells him as he does sprints across the field. \n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Stiles calls out from where he\u2019s sprawled out on his back in the grass, reading on his tablet. \u201cCause the likelihood of me getting off the bench is so high.\u201d Derek pauses and glares in Stiles\u2019 direction. Stiles lifts his head. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cYou could do something other than warm the bench if you tried, you know,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cIs this the point where you give me a speech about how if I try really hard, I\u2019ll make the team in no time?\u201d Stiles drops his head back onto the grass. \u201cSave your breath.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you always do this?\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\u201cGet defensive whenever someone tries to encourage you to do something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting defensive,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cOkay, maybe that was a little defensive, but that\u2019s because you are pushing a non-issue.\u201d\n\u201cStiles \u2013 \u201c\nStiles rolls onto his side and props himself on his elbow. \u201cDerek, look. You are the big, strong team captain. I\u2019m that guy who warms the bench so the team is large enough to play, and who cheers when the team scores. I\u2019m okay with this; I\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, you know,\u201d Derek says, jogging over to pick up his crosse from beside Stiles. \u201cI could help you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I appreciate it, and that\u2019s why I love you.\u201d\nThey both freeze, and Derek looks down at Stiles, who is avoiding his eyes by pretending to be engrossed in something on his tablet. Derek runs onto the field and goes through some new plays he\u2019d come up with so he can show them to coach next week. He even convinces Stiles to get on the field and help him out. \nEvery time Derek runs by Stiles, peaches and cinnamon fill his senses, and he can\u2019t stop thinking about what Stiles said.\n\nThat\u2019s why I love you. That\u2019s why I love you.\n\nStiles is running the ball up the field, and Derek feels his instincts urging him to chase Stiles, so Derek grins as he indulges himself for once. He\u2019s pouncing on Stiles after only a few seconds, and his arms act as a cage around Stiles as they hit the ground. Stiles lets out a surprised breath, and then wiggles in his arms.\n\u201cWhat the hell, dude?\u201d Derek releases Stiles enough so he can roll onto his back. Derek is grinning down at Stiles widely, and Stiles is shaking his head. \u201cYou are frigging insane.\u201d\nDerek kisses him hard, more teeth than usual, but his blood is pumping through his veins with the after effects of catching Stiles, and when he pulls away, he realizes that he\u2019s been rubbing himself all over Stiles. Stiles smells like them, and Derek feels content.\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Derek whispers. He nuzzles against the bend of Stiles\u2019 jaw and drops a kiss on his damp skin. \n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Stiles says. Derek lifts up, worried that he\u2019s overstepped, but Stiles\u2019 hands slide under his t-shirt and he runs his hands over the smooth planes of Derek\u2019s back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d Stiles sits up slightly, mouth hovering just inches from Derek\u2019s, and scratches his nails along the back of Derek\u2019s neck. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says quietly, and Derek kisses him again.\n*\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s official then,\u201d Talia says at dinner that night. \u201cYou\u2019re dating Stiles.\u201d\nDerek feels himself flush, and he glares at Cora. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d she protests with her hands up. \u201cI could have ratted you out about the Stiles situation so many times. Why would I wait until now? I honestly wanted to see how this all played out.\u201d He flashes his eyes at her for good measure before turning to his mom.\n\u201cI guess,\u201d he answers quietly.\n\u201cYou guess.\u201d She tips her head down and stares at him with piercing eyes. He squirms and feels five years old again.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m dating Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been how long now, a couple of weeks?\u201d He looks at her in shock. She leans forward, her eyes burning red. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a really bad job covering yourself, Derek. I thought Laura would have done a better job telling you how to cover certain smells.\u201d\nDerek feels his face heat up, and yep, he just wishes the earth would open up and swallow him whole. \u201cI told you that you reeked of him,\u201d Cora mutters beside him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been doing a good job of hiding it. You come home every other day smelling like Stiles\u2019 spunk.\u201d\nTalia shouts, \u201cCora!\u201d at the same time Derek says, \u201cYou could have warned me!\u201d\n\u201cI did!\u201d\nTalia sighs, and Derek\u2019s dad says, \u201cDid you even think about what we said? Did you think about his safety, the safety of your Pack?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I did, Dad.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen. Stop treating me like a child.\u201d\n\u201cI just want you to be prepared for the responsibility that dating Stiles is going to entail,\u201d Talia says. \u201cYou have to be extra careful with him, especially since you two are sexually active. You have to control your wolf \u2013 \u201c\nDerek groans, \u201cI know,\u201d at the same time Cora gleefully mutters, \u201cToo late.\u201d Derek exhales heavily through his nostrils as he turns and glowers at her. She smirks.\n\u201cOh god, Derek, what did you do?\u201d his dad asks.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d\n\u201cHe scent marked him,\u201d Cora answers. \n\u201cTraitor,\u201d Derek growls.\n\u201cNo fangs at the table!\u201d Talia snaps. Derek abruptly retracts his fangs and claws. \u201cDid you scent mark the sheriff\u2019s son?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d Derek mumbles.\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Talia says in exasperation while his father just laughs. Talia turns on him and glares. \u201cThis is not funny!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny,\u201d he responds.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Cora agrees. \u201cHe scent marked him in the parking lot last week. You should have seen him with his face buried in Stiles\u2019 neck before school, and \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cCora!\u201d Derek exclaims, dropping his face into his hands. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to die of embarrassment. Unless his mother kills him first.\n\u201cDerek, you can\u2019t go scent marking people in public!\u201d Talia says, shaking her head. \u201cFor god\u2019s sake, at least do it in private if you must. Not that I want you marking him in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cOr dating him at all,\u201d Derek mumbles miserably.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re having sex. He\u2019s human, if you lose yourself in a fit of passion, you could lose control. Have you lost control?\u201d\n\u201cMom!\u201d Derek hides his face in his arms. \u201cI am not having this conversation with my mother.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s dad reaches over and covers Talia\u2019s hand, squeezing it. \u201cOh Talia, lighten up. It\u2019s his first love. It\u2019s adorable.\u201d\n\u201cDisgusting is more like it,\u201d Cora says.\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t it be a werewolf? Or even Danny?\u201d Talia asks no one in particular.\nDerek\u2019s just sitting in his chair, staring at the table in mortification. Cora throws a bean at his head, and when he glances at her, she pelts him with another and he sighs. \nHis family is the worst.\n*\n\u201cMy mom knows we\u2019re dating,\u201d Derek says the next night. They\u2019re in the back of Stiles\u2019 Jeep, parked on the edge of the Preserve. Stiles is lying on top of Derek, his chin propped on his hands on Derek\u2019s chest.\n\u201cDid she flip her shit?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cYou\u2019re here, so I guess she\u2019s not too mad.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not happy,\u201d Derek says. \nThat was probably putting it mildly. She had wanted them to break up, but thanks to his dad, she had finally relented. \u201cThis is a huge responsibility,\u201d she had told him, her finger pointed in his face. \u201cIf anything happens \u2013 if he gets hurt, if he finds out, if he tries to tell his father about us - you will have to deal with the consequences.\u201d Derek was just so happy he didn\u2019t have to lie about dating Stiles anymore (or lie about breaking up with him, because that was definitely not happening) that he didn\u2019t care what she said to him.\n\u201cWhy does she hate me so much?\u201d Stiles asks. He\u2019s pouting a little bit, and Derek drags his thumb over Stiles\u2019 lip that\u2019s jutting out petulantly. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t even met me. Shouldn\u2019t she wait until after she meets me to hate me?\u201d\n\u201cCan we please not talk about my mother any longer?\u201d Derek asks. \n\u201cMaybe I should come over for dinner,\u201d Stiles continues without hearing Derek. \u201cThen maybe she\u2019ll like me. I mean, Cora doesn\u2019t really like me, but that\u2019s because she has actually met me. She just loves glaring at me and pushing me down whenever she sees me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s gonna stop,\u201d Derek snaps. \n\u201cOh, are you gonna defend my honor against all your family members? What about your dad and Laura? Do they hate me, too? Do I have to worry about some Romeo and Juliet family feud where they tear us star-crossed lovers apart?\u201d Stiles puts his hand against his forehead and pretends to swoon. \u201cOr will you finally just realize your family is right and break up with me?\u201d\n\u201cHow can you ask that?\u201d Derek curls his hands against the small of Stiles\u2019 back, holding him closer. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t broken up with you already, there\u2019s not much that can cause it now.\u201d\nStiles smiles. \u201cYou don\u2019t see how annoying I really am because right now you\u2019re blinded by how great my blowjobs are. I\u2019m just sucking your brain out through your dick.\u201d Stiles puts his fist up to his mouth and pokes at his cheek with his tongue. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to stop sucking you off yet.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Derek says, rolling his hips. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason I\u2019m with you.\u201d Derek lifts his hand and threads his fingers in Stiles\u2019 hair, bringing his face closer to kiss. Within moments, they\u2019re both panting and hard, and Derek quickly undoes their flies and pulls their dicks free. Stiles kisses along Derek\u2019s jaw and then down his neck, and a low growl escapes his mouth when Stiles bites the chord in his neck.\n\u201cFuck, those sounds you make,\u201d Stiles murmurs as he licks along Derek\u2019s skin, \u201chow are they even humanly possible?\u201d Stiles tries to imitate Derek\u2019s growl, but it just sounds ridiculous. Derek laughs and angles his face so he can kiss Stiles again.\nTheir foreheads are pressed together, and they\u2019re panting into each other\u2019s mouths. Derek has his hands wrapped around both their cocks, and Stiles\u2019 hands are resting on top of Derek\u2019s as they slide along their shafts. Stiles has his knees on either side of Derek\u2019s hips, pressing into the floor of the Jeep as he rocks his hips into the circle of their hands.\nDerek\u2019s so focused on the feel of Stiles\u2019 long fingers and his hot, plump cock against his own that he doesn\u2019t notice anyone approaching until he hears the tapping on the glass and the light shining inside through the windows.\n\u201cBeacon County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Break it up, boys.\u201d\nStiles rolls off Derek in a flurry of limbs, and they\u2019re both staring up in shock at the deputy watching them from outside the Jeep. With their pants and underwear shoved down their thighs, and their junk hanging out for all the world to see. At least Derek has the decency to cover his crotch with his hands after a moment. Stiles is still just lying there with his legs spread open, his cock and balls on display for the deputy.\n\u201cPut your clothes on, boys, and exit the vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles mumbles as he yanks his pants up. He gets his boxers twisted underneath his dick somehow, and he\u2019s tugging and cursing until Derek stops him and pulls his boxers up and over his dick. Stiles looks at Derek helplessly. \u201cWe are so fucked. My dad\u2026fuck. We are so fucked.\u201d\nDerek gives Stiles a quick kiss as he buttons his pants. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine, okay?\u201d\nStiles opens the back door of the Jeep, and they both crawl out. They stare at the ground, refusing to look the officer in the eye. \u201cStiles,\u201d the deputy sighs. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d The man turns to Derek and asks for his license, and Derek hands it over. After he studies it for a moment, the deputy gives it back to Derek, and then pulls out his cell phone.\n\u201cHey Sheriff,\u201d the deputy says looking at Stiles. \u201cWe have a bit of a situation.\u201d Derek ignores the conversation in favor of grabbing Stiles\u2019 hand and holding it in both of his. Stiles\u2019 heart is beating way too quickly in his chest, and Derek\u2019s a bit scared he\u2019s going to panic in a moment. He squeezes his hand.\n\u201cStiles,\u201d the deputy starts, \u201cYour dad said for you to go home immediately, and to make sure you bring your friend with you. He also said that he knows how long it takes to drive from here to your house, so you better go straight home.\u201d\nStiles nods wordlessly, and the deputy watches as Stiles and Derek get back into the Jeep and drive away. Stiles doesn\u2019t talk the entire drive to his house, and Derek lays a hand on Stiles\u2019 thigh and rubs his thumb across his leg soothingly. After a few minutes, Stiles starts to relax a bit.\nThe sheriff is waiting for them on the porch when they get out of the Jeep. His arms are crossed over his chest, and he\u2019s glaring at both of them. Derek sits beside Stiles on the couch, but not too close. The look on the sheriff\u2019s face rivals some of his mother\u2019s, and she\u2019s an Alpha werewolf. In fact, the sheriff might be more terrifying than his mother.\n\u201cStiles, what in the hell were you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cUm, well, see, I \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cSex? At the Preserve? You know how often that area is patrolled. All sort of weird things happen in those woods,\u201d the sheriff says and Derek tries to look innocent. He\u2019s pretty sure his family is responsible for most of those weird things. \u201cHowling, animal sightings, dead bodies \u2013 \u201c Yep, mostly his family. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to be out there at night. And it\u2019s just plain stupid to be out there fucking around!\u201d\n\u201cWhere else are we supposed to go?\u201d Stiles asks. \nThe sheriff runs a hand through his hair in exasperation. Then he turns his attention to Derek. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cDad, this is my \u2013 \u201c The sheriff shoots Stiles a look, and he withers immediately. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna just sit over here and stay quiet.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d He turns back to Derek, waiting.\n\u201cI\u2019m Derek Hale.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a little old to be fooling around in the back of a Jeep with my sixteen year old son???\u201d\n\u201cDad, he\u2019s eighteen! He goes to \u2013 oh yeah, shutting up,\u201d Stiles says when the sheriff glares again.\n\u201cI turned eighteen in November. I\u2019m a senior and on the lacrosse team with Stiles.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you were groping my son in the back of his Jeep.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t respond, but he feels his cheeks heat up.\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d the sheriff points at Stiles, \u201cwhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell me you had a boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cI, uh \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell your dad about me?\u201d Derek blurts. \nThe sheriff looks between them, and then shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna send me to an early grave, Stiles.\u201d He walks towards the kitchen and motions for Stiles to follow. Derek knows it\u2019s wrong, but he listens in to the conversation anyway. \u201cStiles, what in the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cDad, it wasn\u2019t that bad. We were barely even fooling around. Just hands, I swear. Nothing else.\u201d He hears the sheriff groan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we could do it at his house, or here.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping I\u2019d get you graduated without having to deal with this.\u201d\n\u201cDad, it\u2019s not - hey! Wait a minute. That is the meanest thing you\u2019ve ever said. You seriously wanted me to graduate single and a virgin?\u201d\n\u201cStiles, we are not having this conversation right now!\u201d Derek looks at his shoes when they turn their attention to him. \u201cHe\u2019s too old for you. He could have been arrested for what you two were doing.\u201d\n\u201cDad, he\u2019s only like a year older than me. I\u2019ll be seventeen in April, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\u201cWe will talk about this more later. I\u2019m not so sure how I feel about you dating this guy.\u201d The sheriff stalks back over to Derek. \u201cSon, if you\u2019re gonna date Stiles, then we need to have a talk.\u201d Derek gulps and braces himself.\nAs far as dating talks go, it wasn\u2019t that bad. Or maybe it was just that Derek knew the bullets wouldn\u2019t kill him if the sheriff actually went through with his threat to shoot him.\n*\nAn hour later, Derek runs across Stiles\u2019 yard, jumps up, and grabs the awning beneath Stiles\u2019 window and climbs onto the roof. He taps on Stiles\u2019 window, and Stiles shouts. Derek puts his finger up to his lips as Stiles stumbles to the window and lifts it.\n\u201cAre you crazy? What are you doing here? How did you even get on the roof?\u201d Stiles whispers. \u201cIf my dad finds you, he is gonna be pissed. He already doesn\u2019t want me dating you. He thinks you look like a delinquent, and that you are gonna cause me to get arrested.\u201d\nDerek snorts and steps close to slide his arms around Stiles\u2019 waist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\n\u201cFor getting you in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I believe that was all me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m the one whose bright idea it was to go fool around at the Preserve.\u201d\nDerek nuzzles his face against Stiles\u2019 neck, and he breathes in. \u201cYour dad doesn\u2019t want you dating me, and my mom doesn\u2019t want me dating you.\u201d\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s fucked up, right?\u201d Stiles asks.\n\u201cDo you care?\u201d Derek asks, lifting his face.\n\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d Stiles grins and Derek kisses him.\n*\n\n\nEpilogue\n\n\n\u201cYou could stop lying there on my bed looking sexy and, oh I don\u2019t know, help me unpack.\u201d Stiles glares at Derek, and Derek just ignores him and keeps reading the book he\u2019d grabbed from the top of Stiles\u2019 book box a couple of hours ago. It\u2019s Stiles\u2019 first night in his dorm, and Derek was there to help him unpack. Which basically meant he had been reading on Stiles\u2019 bed while Stiles did all the unpacking.\nAfter Stiles pesters him for ten minutes, and then sits on Derek\u2019s stomach and steals the book from him, Derek finally helps him by putting together his bookcase and lamp while Stiles arranges his comic books and bobblehead collection.\nLater, they go to across town to Derek\u2019s apartment. They\u2019re lying in tangled sheets, with Derek holding Stiles from behind as he drops kisses along Derek\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Stiles says. \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to christen my dorm bed. Stupid roommate having to come back.\u201d\nDerek chuckles and bites the ball of Stiles\u2019 shoulder lightly. \u201cNot exactly the way you want to start off that relationship.\u201d \n\u201cMy dad kept glaring around the room when he was there earlier, like he thought you were about to jump out from the closet or something.\u201d\nDerek leans close to Stiles\u2019 ear and whispers, \u201cPretty sure I\u2019ve already come out of the closet.\u201d\nStiles slaps his thigh hard enough to sting. \u201cStupid, stupid jokes.\u201d Derek laughs, and buries his face between Stiles\u2019 shoulders. \u201cHe told me to try and make more friends, and to not spend all my time at your apartment. He\u2019s still not happy I decided to come to Berkeley, too.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Berekley, it\u2019s not exactly like you followed me to Beacon Hills Community College,\u201d Derek mumbles. \u201cBesides, you got a scholarship.\u201d\n\u201cTell that to my dad.\u201d Stiles pats Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s coming around, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI still wanted to break in my bed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll break it in soon, I promise.\u201d Derek pulls away and sits up. Stiles looks over his shoulder, brow creased. Derek scratches the stubble on his chin absently. \u201cActually, I\u2019m kinda glad that you\u2019re here. There\u2019s something I want to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Stiles says, shooting up and knocking the blankets to the floor in his haste. \u201cYou\u2019re not breaking up with me, are you?\u201d\nDerek rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to deign that with a response.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it? You have serious-brow on.\u201d Stiles pulls his legs under him, and Derek takes a deep breath. His hands are shaking with nerves, and he knows that after tonight, things will never be the same. But it\u2019s time.\n\u201cYou know that I love you,\u201d Derek starts.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles replies warily.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve wanted to tell you this for a long time, but I had to wait for the right time because it\u2019s \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cComplicated,\u201d Stiles finishes for him. Derek nods. \u201cOh god, did you used to be a girl? Cause I don\u2019t care, you know. Are you on the run from the Mafia? Is your mom a mob boss? Do you secretly like to wear women\u2019s underwear, because once again, I definitely do not care \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m a werewolf.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Stiles blinks, and Derek doesn\u2019t even breathe. He\u2019s afraid that he\u2019ll smell a reaction he doesn\u2019t want to, and he just can\u2019t handle the idea that Stiles won\u2019t love him now that he knows.\n\u201cI\u2019m a werewolf.\u201d\n\u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d\nDerek feels like his entire world is crashing down around him, and it must show on his face, because Stiles is suddenly up in his space, with his hands on Derek\u2019s thighs. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to literally get the fuck out, I mean, it\u2019s your apartment. What I meant was like \u2018what the fuck do you mean my boyfriend is a werewolf how is that even real oh my god you could have killed me a hundred times yet you just got four hundred percent sexier.\u2019\u201d Stiles cups Derek\u2019s face, and says, \u201cShow me.\u201d\nDerek lets his eyes turn blue, and Stiles gasps. Then Derek forces himself to partially shift until his fangs are fully extended. His mouth is open awkwardly with his fangs, and Stiles reaches out and touches one of the bottom ones gently. \u201cThis explains so much.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Derek\u2019s fangs recede and his eyes return back to normal. \n\u201cI thought I imagined your eyes flashing blue over the last year, like it was a trick of the light or something my brain did when I had come-mush for brain.\u201d Stiles lifts a hand to finger a bruise on his collarbone. \u201cSo much fucking sense.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not mad, or repulsed, or scared?\u201d Derek hates feeling this vulnerable, hates having this much of himself out on display, and he now understands why his mother encouraged him to wait. This is the most terrifying moment of his life.\nStiles shakes his head. \u201cNo. I mean, I\u2019m a little freaked out and it\u2019s gonna take some getting used to, but I love you.\u201d Stiles reaches out and pulls Derek\u2019s bottom lip down to reveal human teeth. \u201cAll of you.\u201d\nDerek tackles Stiles to the bed, covering him in kisses. Stiles laughs, and Derek doesn\u2019t hold back when he feels the need to rub himself all over Stiles or to let his wolf out a bit. When he raises his head, Stiles is staring at his eyes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re glowing,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThey\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d Derek smiles and blinks his eyes back to normal. \u201cThis is why your mom didn\u2019t want you dating me,\u201d Stiles says.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want me dating a human,\u201d Derek explains. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, in a lot of ways, for us and you.\u201d Derek brushes his hands through Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cBut it turned out pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cI like to think so.\u201d Stiles grins, and then he says, \u201cWait, does she know you told me?\u201d\nDerek nods. \u201cI asked her permission. It\u2019s not just my secret to tell; I have to think about my whole Pack. She reluctantly agreed. But next time we\u2019re home, you have to come to a family dinner.\u201d\nStiles groans and buries his face into Derek\u2019s arm. \u201cI hate dinners with your family. Your family is so weird.\u201d\n\u201cWerewolves,\u201d Derek grins. \u201cNow maybe you\u2019ll get it. Cora and Laura are pretty excited to initiate you into the Pack.\u201d\nStiles peeks out from Derek\u2019s arm. \u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d Derek wraps his arms around Stiles\u2019 waist and moves them into a sitting position. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect. I\u2019m pretty strong, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Stiles asks, mischievous grin on his face. \u201cJust how strong?\u201d\nDerek grins, letting himself shift fully. Stiles is a little surprised at first, but then he drops his head back and laughs. \u201cMy boyfriend is a werewolf.\u201d He shakes his head and leans forward to kiss Derek\u2019s wolf face.\nIt\u2019s moments like these that Derek is really thankful Isaac made him sit at Stiles\u2019 stupid lunch table that day at school.\n-fin"
