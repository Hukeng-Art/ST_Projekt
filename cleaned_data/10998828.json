    "text": "Shouto knows he isn\u2019t good at this.\nHe never has been. He can\u2019t tell whether this is just the way he is, or it\u2019s one more thing he can blame on his father, but he knows that he isn\u2019t good at this. People call him stoic, and cold. Some even call him mysterious. Others call him emotionless.\nIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t feel. He does feel, but it all gets locked inside and none of it ever shows. Sometimes it\u2019s because he can\u2019t show it. Other times it\u2019s because he\u2019s afraid to.\nTake now, for instance. Midoriya isn\u2019t even looking at him, too engrossed in the notes he\u2019s going over, and yet Shouto can feel his mouth go dry and his tongue turn to lead. In moments like this, watching Midoriya\u2019s face, the way his brows knit together in concentration and his eyes flicker with each thought, Shouto feels things extra-sharp.\nHe\u2019s been thinking about this for weeks. Months, even. Shouto isn\u2019t good at showing what he feels, or saying what he feels, so he locks it away and thinks instead. But with Midoriya\u2026\nWith Midoriya, it\u2019s okay. No matter how bad he is at this, Midoriya listens. Midoriya understands. Whatever else happens, Shouto is safe.\nAnd that is what tips the scales in the favor of courage. Midoriya has given him many things, but he has never stopped giving him courage.\nMidoriya stands up, closing his notebook, and it\u2019s only then that he realizes that Midoriya has been speaking, and Shouto\u2014lost in thoughts and feelings\u2014has barely caught a word. \u201c\u2014and anyway, what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d The scales teeter dangerously.\n\u201cYeah. I want to hear your thoughts.\u201d\nThey are alone in the dorm commons, so there is no one else around to hear. The words come out blunt and wooden, but Midoriya understands, Midoriya always understands. \u201cI think I like you, and I want to go out with you.\u201d\nHe holds his breath, watching for a reaction, waiting for a response. His friend blinks at him, eyes widening in confusion, and then disbelief.\nAnd then Midoriya barks out a laugh and walks away.\nThe first time it happens, Izuku is twelve years old, it\u2019s his second week of middle school, and Nanase-senpai in Class 2-B is the prettiest girl he\u2019s ever seen. He likes her smile, and the glitter clips in her hair, and her laughter makes him want to smile even if he\u2019s still shaking off Kacchan\u2019s mockery.\nHe never talks to her, of course, because she\u2019s beautiful and a whole year older than him, and just like Kacchan and everyone else in this school, she has a quirk and he doesn\u2019t. Izuku isn\u2019t angry about that; it\u2019s just the way things are. It\u2019s not Nanase-senpai\u2019s fault that she can move things without touching them, nor is it her fault that Izuku can\u2019t do anything. He\u2019s okay with this. Nothing is ever going to change.\nUntil, for about five seconds, he thinks it might.\nHe thinks that because suddenly Nanase-senpai is walking over to his lonely table at lunch, with her pretty smile and glitter clips in her hair, and says, \u201cHi! You\u2019re Midoriya-kun, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nIzuku can only stare at her, awestruck and maybe a little bit afraid because Nanase-senpai knows his name.\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re kinda cute!\u201d Has he mentioned that her smile is wonderful? \u201cWant to go on a date with me?\u201d\nHis mind goes blank then, his eyes big and round and maybe a little watery. And he thinks, maybe Mom was right. Maybe middle school really will be better than elementary school and maybe\u2014\nNanase-senpai\u2019s pretty face crumples, and she tries to hold in a laugh but it sputters out of her anyway, and she turns and darts back to a neighboring table where a cluster of girls have been watching the whole thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d she calls, without bothering to look back and see that Izuku and half the cafeteria can hear her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tried to hold it together but I couldn\u2019t help it\u2014did you see his face?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nanase!\u201d another girl answers. \u201cYou still did it\u2014a dare\u2019s a dare!\u201d\nNanase-senpai laughs again, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t sound as pretty anymore.\nIt must have become a running joke at school, after that. Akiyama-san comes up to him in class weeks later, tall and broad and big-boned enough that Izuku can\u2019t help but shrink back when she looms over him. And then the first thing out of her mouth is \u201cWant to eat lunch together, Midoriya-kuuun?\u201d in a voice that almost trills, and Midoriya perks up in his seat because he can\u2019t remember the last time he had the chance to make a friend.\nThis time, he gets as far as \u201cUm,\u201d before Akiyama thumps his desk with her hand and spins around on her heel to march back to her seatmates.\n\u201cDid it!\u201d she calls. \u201cTold you I\u2019d do it! Pay up, Naoka!\u201d\n\u201cYou were supposed to ask him on a date, Akiyama.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, I have my limits. A bet\u2019s a bet.\u201d\nThis time Kacchan overhears the whole thing, and Izuku ducks his head and lets the raucous laughter wash over him again.\nThe next semester starts when Mihara-kun transfers into his class, and it\u2019s Nanase-senpai all over again. Izuku can\u2019t look at him long, because if he isn\u2019t careful than he\u2019ll end up never looking away at all. He has a magical few days in which Mihara-kun grins at him and treats him kindly before someone helpfully informs him that Izuku is quirkless, and even then he doesn\u2019t even switch to bullying. Once during math, he lends Izuku a pencil when his own breaks, and that\u2019s the kindest thing that anyone in Izuku\u2019s class has ever done for him.\nHis quirk makes his eyes change color depending on how he\u2019s feeling. Izuku doesn\u2019t have enough time to nail down the patterns before Mihara-kun turns to him one day and says, \u201cHey, Midoriya-kun, I really like you. Want to go on a date after school?\u201d And because of that, Izuku doesn\u2019t know that orange means he\u2019s joking until his face lights up and Mihara-kun bursts out snickering at the sight. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m just kidding, stop looking at me like that.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a really stupid puppy,\u201d someone else says, and Mihara-kun laughs.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Once in a great while, some pretty girl or pretty boy will surprise Izuku with a love confession or ask for a date, to settle a bet or fulfill a dare, before running off to laugh with their friends because no one wants to date quirkless Midoriya Izuku, but it sure is funny to make him jump. Akiyama laughs whenever she sees it happen, as if each time is the first.\nAnd Izuku smiles and ducks and stays silent, and meets every joke with sincerity and delight because his hope springs eternal.\nOr at least, it springs until he\u2019s a second-year, and Shinoda-san darts up to him during lunch with her eyes alight with excitement.\n\u201cMeet me by the basketball court after school,\u201d she says, in a hushed voice like she\u2019s sharing a secret. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d And Izuku agrees, soaking up her eagerness and missing the way she grins not at him, but at someone over his shoulder.\nHe hurries to the basketball court after school, heart drumming with anticipation, and finds not Shinoda-san but four third-year boys waiting for him. They surround him before he can run away.\nIt really shouldn\u2019t have taken a black eye, a bloody nose, and his bookbag drowned in a locker room toilet for him to get the hint, but maybe he just liked having attention that much.\nBut at least he stops falling for it after that. The joke keeps coming, until the girls and boys that play it finally run together and Izuku stops remembering names and faces. It\u2019s easier, he finds, to grin and laugh it off, to pretend he\u2019s in on the joke. It\u2019s easier to laugh with them than to sit silently while they laugh at him. It hurts, but it\u2019s an easier hurt, and no one can ever use the joke to beat him up again. Like everything, it gets easier with practice, and his middle school classmates give him plenty of chances.\nBy the time he hears it from Todoroki, Izuku is so out of practice that he accidentally lets the hope in. Just for a split second, his heart lifts and he wonders at the thought of someone as beautiful and strong as Todoroki seeing him that way. But then reality returns, as unwelcome as ever, and Izuku lets it squash his hope again. Muscle memory lets him force a laugh with relative ease, and he walks away before he can let the half-forgotten hurt show.\nShouto stares at Midoriya\u2019s back until he can\u2019t see it anymore, and then he keeps staring because he doesn\u2019t know what else to do.\nThis would go one of two ways, he had thought. Either Midoriya would return his feelings, or he wouldn\u2019t. Either Midoriya\u2019s eyes would go wide, the way they always did when he was surprised and flustered, and he would mumble and stammer out an agreement\u2014or he would fidget awkwardly and turn him down gently, apologizing even though it wouldn\u2019t be his fault. That was how Shouto imagined it, when gathering courage. That was how he comforted himself: even if he failed, Midoriya would do everything he could to keep from hurting him. He was kind like that. His voice was soft and his feelings were gentle, and even if it didn\u2019t go the way Shouto hoped, at least it wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nHe never imagined laughing. He never imagined Midoriya walking away without a word\u2014not even a yes or a no.\nHot, uncomfortable shame fills him, and he sits motionless and stares as it pricks him like needles and makes him want to shrink away and hide and never look at anyone again.\nHis eyes sting, and then they are wet, and then they spill over and Shouto breaks free of his frozen state to wipe at them hurriedly. What if someone comes in\u2014what if Midoriya comes back and sees\u2014?\nAnd now he feels like an idiot, sitting alone in the common room scrubbing at the tears running down his face. He tries to get a hold of himself, but the deep breath he takes trembles on the way in and he doesn\u2019t want to feel this way. This wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt. He wasn\u2019t supposed to come away from this feeling like a fool.\nHe\u2019s used to having his feelings treated like they don\u2019t count for anything. But he\u2019s not used to Midoriya doing it.\nIt hurts because this is one of those things Izuku thought he\u2019d left behind when he started at UA. Along with bags dropped in fountains and toilets, stolen notebooks that turn up in the bushes with half the pages ripped out, lunch trays knocked out of his hands, black eyes and crushed dreams and loneliness\u2014Izuku has spent his time in high school thinking that the prank is finally something of the past.\nIt hurts because it\u2019s Nanase-senpai and Mihara-kun all over again\u2014because Todoroki is beautiful, with his bright hair and brighter eyes and his quiet strength. Because Izuku has spent enough time looking at him and wishing and imagining to be sure of his feelings, and it\u2019s different from his middle-school crushes because more than anything he knows he can trust Todoroki with his life. It wouldn\u2019t hurt if he couldn\u2019t.\nHe must have made it obvious, if even Todoroki noticed enough to tease him about it.\nAnd because it hurts, Izuku stays quietly angry and upset for another few hours before he finally shakes it off. Heaven help him, he can never stay upset with Todoroki for long. Especially now, with common sense pointing out that Todoroki is every bit as inexperienced with having friends as he is, if not more so. In all likelihood Todoroki just doesn\u2019t realize how hurtful it was. And why would he? It\u2019s just a dumb joke, and the only reason it bothers Izuku so much is that it\u2019s plagued him for so long. Keeping quiet certainly won\u2019t help; Izuku can\u2019t fix this by pretending that nothing is wrong.\nBut it\u2019s all right\u2014the difference between then and now is that Todoroki isn\u2019t some untouchable classmate that Izuku can never talk to; Todoroki is his friend, and Izuku can always tell him when something\u2019s wrong.\nIzuku goes back down to the common room just in time to find his friend shrugging into a jacket, about to head out.\n\u201cHey, Todoroki,\u201d he calls as he catches up. He tries to go for casual\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to start off sounding overly accusing. \u201cI wanted to\u2014\u201d\nTodoroki walks by him without a word. The door shuts in Izuku\u2019s face.\nShouto knows he\u2019s being childish. Cowardly, even. Were he a braver person, he would take the chance that Midoriya gives him\u2014and then the many chances that follow\u2014to let his anger and hurt spill out instead of pool within him. Midoriya approaches him whenever he catches Shouto in the same room, eyes bright, mouth open to speak, but Shouto averts his eyes and shoulders past him every time, if he can\u2019t get away with turning around and leaving. He should want to talk\u2014he should want to yell, even\u2014but when he hears Midoriya\u2019s voice he hears dry laughter, and when he sees his face he sees that shallow, insincere smile. The hurt builds again until it nearly spills over, and Shouto leaves because that\u2019s what he\u2019s always done when he comes that close to breaking in front of someone.\nHe\u2019s avoiding Midoriya, plain and simple. He\u2019s not trying to hide it; he\u2019s too upset to bother. And Midoriya, who has never been stupid or unobservant, notices. Shouto tries to look away, tries to blind and deafen and numb himself to it, but with every attempt, he can feel Midoriya\u2019s frustration growing. A small, petty part of him draws satisfaction from that, and by the time they have to go back to class, Midoriya has stopped trying.\nShouto should be relieved at not having to put the effort into not looking at him anymore. But now, if chance forces them near each other, he can feel anger radiating off of Midoriya, and that only fuels his own irritation. What does Midoriya have to be angry about? Did he really find Shouto\u2019s confession that disgusting?\nAt least school means training, and training is a relief. In training, he can pour himself into every maneuver, every blow, every attack, until he\u2019s left heaving for breath and thinking about the ache in his lungs and limbs instead of the hurt. It\u2019s an old, reliable coping mechanism of his, to work himself hard enough that he\u2019s too tired to think about anything else.\nHe hasn\u2019t had to use it in quite a while, but now it\u2019s the only outlet he can see. It\u2019s somewhat less exhausting to talk about what hurts him, but that\u2019s not possible now. The only person he ever trusts with that is Midoriya, so what is he to do when what hurts him is Midoriya himself?\n\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nOchako waits a few days to say something. She considers herself an optimist, you know? Always seeing the best of a situation, seeing the best in people. But her patience is short when her friends are in trouble, and this isn\u2019t something that she can simply sit around and ignore until it resolves itself.\nIida blinks at her. \u201cWell, the flow of your sentences is a bit stilted, and\u2014oh, I see, you have a few errors in verb tense.\u201d\nThey\u2019re study buddies for the afternoon. Ochako needs help with an English assignment, and Iida has the second-best grades in their class. Also, it\u2019s a convenient way to confide in someone.\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2014well, okay, yeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d Ochako erases the grammar errors that Iida points out. \u201cBut I meant something\u2019s wrong with Deku and Todoroki.\u201d\nIida\u2019s no fool. \u201cSo you\u2019ve noticed it, as well?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, have I noticed that Todoroki didn\u2019t eat with us at lunch today or yesterday, and that he and Deku have barely looked at each other since last weekend?\u201d \u201cEr\u2026 yes.\u201d Iida looks faintly uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t see what this has to do with conjugation, however\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t said anything?\u201d Ochako presses. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be on that, like instantly.\u201d\n\u201cI was considering it,\u201d Iida admits. \u201cIn fact, I did ask Midoriya if something was amiss\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh? What\u2019d he say?\u201d\n\u201cThat everything was perfectly all right, of course.\u201d Iida actually rolls his eyes at this, and sighs softly. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what I expected.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d Ochako asks, crestfallen. \u201cBut you can tell, right? Something\u2019s up with them.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what little I can tell, things have been a bit frosty between them for the past few days.\u201d Iida taps his chin thoughtfully. \u201cStill, it may not be cause for worry. Such things happen over the course of friendships, and it would be meddlesome of me to ask after every single disagreement. They are good friends, after all, and I\u2019m sure that whatever it is, they are perfectly capable of resolving it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026 might be true,\u201d Ochako says, brushing eraser dust from her paper. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen Deku stay upset with someone for more than a day, you know? I feel like something\u2019s really wrong this time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 may be right,\u201d Iida admits. \u201cTo be honest, I am somewhat worried about Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ochako frowns. \u201cI\u2026 guess you\u2019re right. Can\u2019t put my finger on why, though. He\u2019s just as cool and stoic as he always is.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been throwing himself into training with a bit more\u2026 er\u2026 intensity than normal,\u201d Iida says. \u201cI thought I was imagining it at first, but I heard Aizawa-sensei remark upon it as well.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I would say Todoroki was attempting to distract himself\u2014\u2018i\u2019 before \u2018e\u2019, Uraraka.\u201d\n\u201cOh right, thanks.\u201d Ochako erases again. \u201cSo\u2026 Todoroki\u2019s upset about something, then, right?\u201d\n\u201cThat seems to be the case, though I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s any of our\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry you?\u201d Ochako asks.\n\u201cOf course it worries me,\u201d Iida says, blinking in surprise. \u201cBut\u2026 what exactly are you getting at, Uraraka?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, have you met them?\u201d Ochako asks, twirling her pencil between her fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing that always happens when Todoroki\u2019s upset about something?\u201d Iida\u2019s eyes narrow in thought, and Ochako pushes on. \u201cDeku shows up, you know? He\u2019s always on it. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got an extra Todoroki\u2019s-in-trouble sense or something. And if he doesn\u2019t, then Todoroki goes to him. They\u2019re super close like that. So\u2026\u201d She frowns, and her worry grows. \u201cIf Todoroki\u2019s upset about something, but he can\u2019t talk to Deku about it, then no wonder he\u2019s been acting sort of off.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I believe you\u2019re right.\u201d Now Iida\u2019s frowning too, schoolwork nearly forgotten. \u201cPerhaps he needs someone else to talk to for the time being.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Ochako offers. \u201cHow about we split this into two prongs\u2014you try and talk to Todoroki, and I\u2019ll see if Deku has anything to he wants to say about all this.\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt,\u201d Iida agrees. \u201cA fair plan, Uraraka. But for now\u2014oh! Remember that this is an irregular verb. It doesn\u2019t follow the normal conjugation rules.\u201d\n\u201cOh, damn it, I keep forgetting.\u201d\nOchako gets lucky the next time she sees Deku, because All-Might is already there, unwittingly setting up her opening.\nThey\u2019re just chatting, in the hallway after class has ended for the day, nothing private-looking, and that\u2019s why Ochako hears All-Might ask, \u201cIs something troubling you, my boy? You\u2019ve seemed out of sorts.\u201d\n\u201cN-no more than usual!\u201d Neither of them seem to be keeping their voices down or watching for eavesdroppers, so Ochako doesn\u2019t feel self-conscious about approaching.\n\u201cReally?\u201d she chimes in. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking kind of down lately.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Something like alarm flashes in his eyes for a split second. \u201cR-really? I can\u2019t think of why\u2026\u201d\nOchako can tell by the look on All-Might\u2019s face that he doesn\u2019t believe him any more than she does. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem likely, young Midoriya,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cYou do know you can talk about these things if you need.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, All-Might, but really, there\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d Deku\u2019s not doing a very good job of lying, which means to Ochako that deep down, he really does want to talk about it.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there is,\u201d she says, bulldozing right along. \u201cTodoroki\u2019s been really upset lately, too. I haven\u2019t seen you guys say two words to each other since last weekend.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another flash of something, but it\u2019s gone before Ochako can identify it. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve just been pretty busy this week, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nOchako has been friends with Deku long enough to recognize that tone. That\u2019s the I\u2019m-upset-and-I-want-you-to-stop-noticing tone. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t eaten with us at lunch for the past couple of days,\u201d she presses.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the boss of him,\u201d Deku says, a little shortly. \u201cTodoroki can eat wherever he wants.\u201d Is that a hint of bitterness she\u2019s hearing?\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d All-Might says, sighing a little. \u201cHaving a disagreement with a friend?\u201d\n\u201cGuess so,\u201d Deku mumbles.\n\u201cWhy not talk to him about it, then?\u201d their teacher suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s best to nip these troubles in the bud, you know? Resolve them early before they spiral out of control. It helps no one to put it off.\u201d\n\u201cI would love to talk to him about it.\u201d Frustration bubbles up from Deku, catching Ochako off guard. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying since Sunday, but I can\u2019t talk to him if he keeps giving me the cold shoulder whenever I try!\u201d\nOchako coughs lightly. \u201cUh, was that a\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cThat was not a pun,\u201d Deku sighs.\n\u201cMay I ask what happened on Sunday?\u201d All-Might asks.\n\u201cN-nothing happened on Sunday, it was stupid and it\u2019s hard to explain anyway\u2026\u201d Deku\u2019s voice trails off when All-Might gives him a Look. For a moment Ochako thinks he\u2019s going to turn and flee from both of them, but in the next, his shoulders slump a little in resignation.\n\u201cHey.\u201d She touches his arm gently. \u201cWhatever it is. No judgments, you know? Not from me.\u201d\nThe look Deku\u2019s giving her reminds her of a stray puppy hiding under a cardboard box. \u201cI-I mean, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d His eyes flicker to the side, looking to All-Might, and he takes a breath and seems to rally himself. \u201cOkay, you know that feeling you get when someone does something completely innocuous but for reasons you don\u2019t ever talk about it just bothers you and your first instinct is to get really really upset about it even though that person had no way of knowing it would upset you?\u201d\n\u201cUm.\u201d Ochako blinks at him, several times. \u201cS-sort of?\u201d\n\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d All-Might says. \u201cIs this something that Todoroki\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 just call it a hypothetical,\u201d Deku says quietly.\n\u201cWould you like me to speak with him?\u201d All-Might offers. \u201cYou\u2019re both my students, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Deku says quickly. \u201cNo, no\u2014thanks, All-Might, really, but\u2026 no. We\u2019ll be fine, honest. L-like I said, it\u2019s not even anything big, and\u2026 I can deal with it. I promise.\u201d\nAll-Might looks him in the eye for a few seconds. It still doesn\u2019t look like he believes him, but there\u2019s no arguing with Deku sometimes. \u201cIf you\u2019re certain, my boy.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Deku answers. \u201cI really, really am.\u201d\nOchako doubts that very much. But, she\u2019s not here to fix the problem instantly; she\u2019s just here to find out what\u2019s going on, and Deku has told her a lot more than she knew before. Deku is the nicest, most open, outgoing person she\u2019s ever met, but he can keep a secret like nobody else.\nShe hopes Iida is having better luck.\n\u201cTodoroki, are you and Midoriya having an argument?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Are you sure? There seems to be some tension, and the two of you haven\u2019t been speaking\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t have an argument if you don\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki, you know that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Iida, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t help but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIida. Drop it.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 all right. If you insist.\u201d\nIt gets worse, to the surprise of pretty much no one. By Wednesday, half the class can tell that something\u2019s up with Todoroki. By the day after, it\u2019s gotten around that he and Midoriya are avoiding each other like the plague, and no one\u2019s really sure where Todoroki is eating lunch anymore.\nIt takes a lot of straws to break this particular camel\u2019s back, but then Midoriya nearly wipes out during a training exercise (and takes Mineta down with him) when Todoroki ignores a signal from him and blows past them. The two of them endure a scolding from Aizawa-sensei and spend the rest of the class as far away from each other as the training field will allow, and after that it\u2019s Yaoyorozu who finally declares that she\u2019s had enough.\n\u201cIf this continues, it\u2019s going to negatively affect the class as a whole,\u201d she says, after school is over and several members of the class (none of them being Midoriya and Todoroki) are gathered in the common area.\n\u201cIt already is,\u201d Jirou points out. \u201cMineta\u2019s been complaining to anyone who stands still long enough to listen.\u201d\n\u201cAre you guys sure you aren\u2019t just blowing this out of proportion?\u201d Kaminari asks. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like the whole class is gonna go down in flames just because two people are having issues with each other.\u201d\n\u201cThat might not be true\u2014kero,\u201d Tsuyu chimes in. \u201cWe build each other up, remember? We motivate each other. And nobody motivates people like Midoriya does.\u201d\n\u201cAnd even if that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Yaoyorozu adds. \u201cCollaboration is key now, after all. We have a responsibility to help each other, if it\u2019s needed.\u201d\nHeads turn toward Uraraka and Iida.\nUraraka makes a little noise of frustration. \u201cI talked to Deku about it,\u201d she says. \u201cSort of. You know that thing he does where there\u2019s clearly a problem but he talks about it like it\u2019s no big deal?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty much the worst\u2014kero.\u201d\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s talking about it at all,\u201d Iida sighs. \u201cI tried to speak with Todoroki about it, but he\u2019s been absolutely impenetrable.\u201d\n\u201cIs it really our business, though?\u201d Kaminari points out. \u201cLike, maybe it\u2019s super private or something. If they really don\u2019t want us to know about it, then we can\u2019t force them to spill.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need them to spill to us!\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cWe want them to talk to each other so they can work this out! One of the things Deku told me was that he\u2019s been trying, but he can\u2019t get Todoroki to listen to him.\u201d\n\u201cWell all right then.\u201d Jirou shrugs. \u201cHalf the problem solved. Why don\u2019t we help him out?\u201d\n\u201cI could attempt to mediate between them,\u201d Iida offers. \u201cI\u2019m fairly close with both of them, after all. Not to mention that, as class rep, mediating disputes and keeping peace in the classroom is one of my responsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cMm, that only brings us back to the problem where they don\u2019t want to talk to us about this,\u201d Uraraka reminds him.\n\u201cI have an idea.\u201d\nHeads turn again, this time to Yaoyorozu.\n\u201cIf Midoriya has already tried to talk to Todoroki, then that means he wants this resolved just as much as we do,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe just need to give him that chance, and I think I know a way.\u201d She frowns thoughtfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll need Sero\u2019s help, though.\u201d\nJirou sits up from her slouch and leans forward. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s what we do\u2026\u201d\nIzuku is hungry for a distraction, and that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s so easy for his classmates to trick him.\nHe ought to wonder why the dorm commons feel so empty for a Saturday, but when a sheepish Sero comes to him for help with his math homework, Izuku puts it out of his mind and follows. At some point, Kaminari and Uraraka join them, and he thinks nothing of it because they often need study help, too.\nSero\u2019s room is on the fifth floor, and Izuku feels an uncomfortable pang at the sight of Todoroki\u2019s door. It\u2019s been a week and they still aren\u2019t talking, and Izuku would be lying through his teeth if he claimed to be okay with that.\nTo his surprise, Iida is there, lowering his hand as if he\u2019s just finished rapping on Todoroki\u2019s door. To his alarm, he sees it open, and spots Todoroki\u2019s distinctive hair right before everything goes pear-shaped.\nKaminari moves first, giving him a light zap that still leaves him too startled and disoriented to react to anything else. Uraraka grabs him then, and he feels himself go weightless just for a moment, long enough for Uraraka and Kaminari to lift him bodily and hurl him through the open doorway as Iida springs out of the way. Uraraka releases her quirk\u2019s hold on him, and Izuku goes crashing straight into Todoroki before someone slams the door shut behind him.\nWith a yelp, he springs back and grabs the doorknob, but now it\u2019s jammed shut somehow. \u201cYou guys, what gives!\u201d he yells.\nSero is the first to answer from the other side of the door. \u201cMidoriya I\u2019m so sorry I told them not to do this but they made me help them and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSero, you narc!\u201d Kaminari yells.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d Izuku can feel his heartbeat in his throat. He\u2019s been wanting to talk to Todoroki all week, but not like this. \u201cOpen the door and let me out!\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d It\u2019s Uraraka speaking this time. She sounds oddly cheerful. \u201cNot until you two talk to each other and work out whatever it is you need to work out!\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice almost jumps an octave.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Iida says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have complete privacy! Yaoyorozu called an emergency study session in Shouji\u2019s room for this exact purpose! No one will listen in.\u201d\n\u201cThen how\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYou can come out when you send Tsuyu a nice selfie of you two getting along!\u201d Uraraka almost sing-songs back at him. \u201cIf you try to fake it she\u2019ll know and we move on to making you hold hands in front of everyone!\u201d\n\u201cUraraka!\u201d\n\u201cBye Deku good luck!\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s it. Voices and footsteps fade, and Izuku is left with his face in his hands, locked in Todoroki\u2019s bedroom.\nAfter what feels like an eternity squashed into a few seconds, Izuku raises his head and turns to find a disheveled, sulky Todoroki scowling either at the door or at him.\n\u201cI was trying to nap.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first thing he\u2019s said to Izuku in almost a week, and to Izuku\u2019s ears it sounds like an accusation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I asked them to throw me in here.\u201d His reply comes out more peevish than he really means, and he stops short to shove down the hurt in his chest before it can get out of control. \u201cLook. Clearly things are messed up enough that everyone\u2019s noticed. So unless you feel like breaking your door down, we\u2019re stuck here until we\u2026 work this out. I guess.\u201d He has to drag his eyes from his feet to Todoroki\u2019s face. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve been trying to talk to you since Sunday.\u201d\nWatching Todoroki\u2019s eyes in that moment gives Izuku the same feeling as seeing heavy iron doors slam shut. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou made yourself clear already.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014no I didn\u2019t.\u201d The hurt grows again, as he thinks of that stupid, pointless joke that shouldn\u2019t matter to him but does. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d Todoroki steps forward, and Izuku\u2019s shocked by the anger in his eyes. What, did the joke not get the reaction he wanted?\nWell, tough.\nIzuku steels himself. \u201cLook, Todoroki, I get that you wouldn\u2019t understand, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d Todoroki cuts him off, and something in his voice makes the words die in Izuku\u2019s throat.. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. There is so much I don\u2019t understand, and you know that, and you know why, and I thought\u2014I thought you\u2019d understand.\u201d\nUnease grips him, and he\u2019s not sure why. \u201cUnderstand what?\u201d\n\u201cThat it\u2019s hard for me!\u201d Todoroki doesn\u2019t quite raise his voice, but Izuku still feels it like a lash. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, to talk about things like that, and it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026\u201d His teeth clench. \u201c\u2026frightening, sometimes.\u201d His fists are tight at his sides, and ice spreads along his right forearm. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 good, with people. I just thought you\u2019d understand. You always do.\u201d\nIzuku can only stare at him, hopelessly confused. \u201cTodoroki, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI was scared.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice shakes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you sooner, and I only got past that because it\u2019s you, and if I can\u2019t be honest with you then I can\u2019t be honest with anyone and I thought\u2014\u201d He stops talking because his voice breaks, and Izuku jumps at the sound. Todoroki\u2019s eyes are lowered, narrowed, but he can still see tears gathering in them, and the confusion is rapidly turning to dread. \u201cAnd then I finally got it out, and you didn\u2019t even answer me, you just laughed and walked away and didn\u2019t even look at me again for hours\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTodoroki\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t feel that way!\u201d There\u2019s a sheen of ice on his face now, too. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel the same way\u2014I didn\u2019t even expect you to, I just thought you wouldn\u2019t hate me for it, or mock me for it, and then\u2014then you did, and\u2026\u201d On one side of his face, the tears freeze; on the other, they turn to steam. With a quiet curse, Todoroki wipes them away. \u201cDamn it. Sorry.\u201d He tilts his head back, looking toward the ceiling like he\u2019s trying to keep the rest from falling from his eyes. \u201cWell. This is why I\u2019ve been avoiding you. I didn\u2019t want all of this coming out during lunch. Or ever.\u201d He shuts his eyes and lowers his head, breathing in harshly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why there\u2019s nothing to talk about\u2014because it\u2019s simple. I feel stupid. I hate feeling stupid. I hate that you made me feel stupid, because I thought it\u2019d be safe to talk to you about that, and it wasn\u2019t, and\u2026\u201d His voice trails off, and he presses his palms to his eyes again.\nAnd Izuku can only stare at him, speechless.\nWhen he finds his voice again, all he can manage is a quiet \u201cOh, shit.\u201d\nIt slips out a second time when Todoroki finally looks at him again, and Izuku sees him with renewed clarity, without the resentment and years-old hurt clouding everything. \u201cOh shit, you were serious.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s face goes blank at that, frozen with shock. \u201cWhat do you mean, I was serious.\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s arms move as if on their own, curling around his head as if he can hide from Todoroki\u2019s hurt and his own stupid warped judgment.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be serious.\u201d Izuku can hardly tell the difference between the cold in Todoroki\u2019s voice and the cold wafting off his right side. \u201cWhat, do you think I\u2019d tell you that if I wasn\u2019t serious?\u201d\n\u201cI-I mean, I\u2026\u201d And Izuku can\u2019t answer, because foresight is hazy but hindsight is sharp and clear, and how could he have been so stupid? This is Todoroki. With Todoroki, the tiniest things mean everything, and emotions are a trial, and no matter what else there is between them, there\u2019s trust more than anything. How could he have thought for one second that Todoroki would joke about something so important? \u201cUm, I just. Thought you were kidding.\u201d It comes out weak and feeble, like a half-baked excuse because that\u2019s kind of what it is.\nBecause he just hurt Todoroki badly enough for tears, and there\u2019s nothing that can justify that.\n\u201cYou thought I was kidding?\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice cracks again, and Izuku\u2019s heart breaks a little more. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\nHis arms feel like lead, and he lets them fall to his sides. \u201cTodoroki, I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I do to make you think that badly of me?\u201d\n\u201cN-nothing! You didn\u2019t do anything, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen why would you think that?\u201d Todoroki demands. \u201cWhy would you ever think that I\u2019d tell you I\u2019m in love with you as a joke?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s the only reason anyone\u2019s ever said that to me!\u201d\nThe words are out before Izuku has time to realize how they sound\u2014how sad, embarrassing, and pathetic he must sound saying them. Todoroki blinks at him, and the hurt in his eyes is softened by confusion.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI-I mean\u2026\u201d He hasn\u2019t felt this small in so long. \u201cUm.\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s looking at him oddly now, like he\u2019s come across a new question and isn\u2019t sure how to go about asking it. \u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cN-nothing. It\u2019s not\u2014um.\u201d He feels pressure behind his throat, and he swallows against it desperately. Now is not the time to cry. \u201cIt was stupid. I-it was really stupid, and\u2014and you\u2019re right, I should\u2019ve known better, and I\u2019m sorry, and\u2014\u201d\nFor the first time, Todoroki takes a step closer. \u201cMidoriya.\u201d\nThe stammering cuts off.\nTodoroki watches his face, as if searching for something. \u201cI, um. You\u2019ve been wanting to talk to me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really let you.\u201d\nIzuku has spent the past week wanting to tell him what\u2019s wrong, to present his hurt feelings and explain why hurt is hurt, no matter how meaningless it seems, but now he feels petty and oversensitive and all that comes out is, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Todoroki keeps looking at him, until more words tumble out. \u201cI-it was just\u2014a joke, that got played on me. A lot. I-in middle school. Just kids being dumb, y-you know? Just, pretending to c-confe\u2014asking me that sometimes, t-to see if I\u2019d fall for it. And I did, a lot until\u2026 I stopped. But they didn\u2019t, and I just\u2026 you asked me that, and I just assumed\u2026 because that\u2019s how it always is, and\u2026\u201d His voice peters out.\nTodoroki keeps staring, quiet and incredulous.\n\u201cB-but you\u2019re right.\u201d Izuku almost has to choke it out, because the painful pressure in his throat is getting to him. \u201cI should\u2019ve known better, because\u2014none of them were my friends, but you are, and I trust you, and\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nThe silence stretches between them. Izuku has spent a week imagining what he would say to Todoroki given the chance, but it didn\u2019t come out like he\u2019d thought, and now he can\u2019t think of anything more to say.\n\u201cI\u2019m just having trouble understanding,\u201d Todoroki says quietly.\n\u201cI-I know.\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice breaks. \u201cI know, I should\u2019ve known better, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2014\u201d Todoroki meets his eyes, looking lost. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014why would anyone joke about being in love with you?\u201d\nThat\u2019s what breaks him, and the tears that Izuku\u2019s been fighting come flooding out, bringing all his shame and guilt and hurt pouring with them. Love\u2014that\u2019s the word that Todoroki uses. Not like, or crush, or feelings, but love. Todoroki is in love with him. Todoroki told him he was in love with him, and Izuku laughed and walked away.\nIzuku spent his childhood being laughed at, being treated like his feelings were some kind of game, being told through words and actions that his feelings don\u2019t matter, and now he\u2019s done the same to Todoroki.\nHis vision goes blurry. Drying his eyes does nothing when the tears won\u2019t stop.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d His voice catches on a sob. \u201cI really hurt you, didn\u2019t I.\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s voice sounds closer now. \u201cBut, um\u2026 you were trying to talk to me, this whole time. And I think if I\u2019d stopped to listen to you, this would\u2019ve been cleared up faster. So\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku says quickly. \u201cI-it\u2019s okay, really, I get it, you had e-every right to be mad, and\u2026 yeah.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nTodoroki falls silent again, waiting while Izuku\u2019s tears finally slow down enough for him to dry his face properly. When his eyes are clear, he finds Todoroki still watching him, eyes bright.\n\u201cUm. M-Midoriya.\u201d Todoroki steps closer again, hesitantly. \u201cNow that you know, that it wasn\u2019t a joke, do you\u2026 have an answer?\u201d\nIzuku blinks at him, wide-eyed. \u201cI\u2014so, you mean I didn\u2019t put you off? Or anything?\u201d\nTodoroki\u2019s eyes flicker to the side for a moment, and his brow furrows. \u201cI think if it was that easy to make it go away, it wouldn\u2019t have hurt this much.\u201d\nSomehow Izuku manages not to flinch. He closes his eyes, briefly, but too long to be mistaken for a blink. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nWhen his eyes open again, Izuku searches his face, probing every inch for some kind of clue, some secret that will let him wrap his head around what he knows. Todoroki is in love with him. Just six words, and yet somehow it\u2019s a struggle.\n\u201cMidoriya.\u201d Todoroki frowns. He must see the struggle on Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2026 do believe me, right?\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Izuku blurts out. \u201cOf course I do, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d His words sputter out when Todoroki takes another step toward him, and he is so close now.\nTodoroki looks a little scared, and his left hand shakes as he lifts it toward Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cWould it help if I proved it to you?\u201d he asks.\nIzuku doesn\u2019t answer\u2014can\u2019t answer, not with Todoroki\u2019s eyes so close and bright. Not with Todoroki already leaning in.\nSo he doesn\u2019t answer. He sees what\u2019s coming, and lets it happen.\nShouto moves quickly, before he can think better of it or talk himself out of it. With Midoriya\u2019s green eyes that close, it\u2019s almost a shame to shut his own, but he\u2019s too afraid to keep them open.\nMidoriya\u2019s lips are soft, and he goes still when Shouto presses his mouth to them. But he doesn\u2019t pull back or push Shouto away, so Shouto lets his left hand brush lightly against Midoriya\u2019s jaw, guiding him into the kiss with a touch.\nHe means for it to be light and brief, just enough to prove that his feelings are real and not a joke (who would joke about something like this?) but then Midoriya sighs softly and melts against him, and Shouto is gone. The world around him vanishes, and all that feels real is Midoriya\u2019s mouth and hands and endless warmth.\nHe comes back to the feeling of scarred hands cradling his face. One of them pulls back first\u2014Shouto isn\u2019t sure who\u2014and they stand with their foreheads pressed together, breathing the same air. Shouto feels Midoriya\u2019s thumb softly caress his cheek, and he leans into the touch, into the rough warmth of his hands, and opens his eyes to find Midoriya looking at him like Shouto\u2019s face is his whole world.\nStaring into those eyes, it takes a moment for Shouto to remember how to use his voice. \u201cSo, does this mean\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Midoriya ducks a little, tucking his forehead into the side of Shouto\u2019s neck. \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And I\u2019m still sorry for laughing, I\u2019m sorry for\u2026 for letting stupid past stuff get to my head.\u201d\nShouto blinks. \u201cHave you met me?\u201d\nMidoriya laughs softly against him, and Shouto can think of no reason not to lean down and taste the laughter on his lips.\nTsuyu\u2019s phone chimes, and the entire room shifts as everyone trips over each other for an ideal vantage point to look over her shoulder.\nThe message is a single photo\u2014sent from Todoroki\u2019s phone. Midoriya\u2019s grin is brighter and wider than it\u2019s been all week, and his eyes are shut as if he was caught mid-laughter. Todoroki is close enough that their faces are touching. He isn\u2019t looking directly at the camera, but he\u2019s trying to hold back a smile of his own and failing miserably.\nCuriously, the background of the photo shows them to be sitting not in Todoroki\u2019s dorm room, but in a cafe booth.\nA text message pops up beneath it.\nWe  went out the window  and  went to get  cake .  Tell Yaoyorozu  to please  take  the bolt off my door before we get back.\nIt\u2019s Sero who breaks the silence.\n\u201cThey were on the fifth fucking floor.\u201d"
