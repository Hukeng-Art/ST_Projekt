    "text": "\nSirius arrives at the party two hours late and covered in snow. Facebook had suggested around thirty people were coming\u2014a number which already threatened to overwhelm James and Lily\u2019s tiny flat. When Sirius arrives at just past ten however, he immediately wishes he\u2019d brought a sledge hammer, if only to make it past the front door. It\u2019s clear that no less than fifty guests had burrowed their way inside. They stand in every corner, filling the narrow hallways and spilling out from every room, their faces vaguely familiar to him, their chattering bright and enthusiastic. Music drifts in from the sitting room, and it takes Sirius a moment to recognize it, bizarrely, as Christmas Carols, despite the New Years Eve decorations strung about the walls. He turns a corner, attempting suave and casual, but instead narrowly avoids a party-goer's over-enthusiastic elbow by crashing into Lily Evans.\n\n\n \u201cOh, sorry Lily! Didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d He reaches out to steady her.\n\n\n \u201cSirius!\u201d She beams, looking as though she hadn\u2019t even noticed her near-death experience. Her green eyes are a bit foggy, her cheeks flushed. She reaches out and wraps a hand around his neck, pulling him forward and planting a kiss on his cheek.\n\n\n \u201cGlad you made it here safe. Quite the snow out there. Was traffic bad?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s New Years Eve,\u201d Sirius replies with a shrug, watching her fondly. \u201cAnyway, exactly who did you invite? Our entire grad class?\u201d\n\n\n Lily waves an impatient hand. \u201cThis is entirely James\u2019s doing, I don\u2019t even know half these people. Come now, he\u2019s been waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\n She leads Sirius through the flat, her hand wrapped around his wrist the only reason they aren\u2019t immediately separated by the sea of people around them. He follows her down the narrow hallway into her and James\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\n \u201cJames!\u201d Lily calls, unnecessarily loud. \u201cGuess who\u2019s here?\u201d\n\n\n James\u2019s head pops up suddenly from behind their bed, his glasses askew and hair completely beyond help. He beams at Sirius, makes an attempt to stand, and fails spectacularly.\n\n\n \u201cPadfoot!\u201d\n\n\n \u201c\u2018Lo Prongs,\u201d Sirius grins, tilting his head in James\u2019s direction. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve invited enough people.\u201d\n\n\n James makes a face. \u201cCan you imagine if we hadn\u2019t had this party? Clearly, there was no where else to go. Lily and I have been deemed heroes.\u201d\n\n\n Lily collapses onto the bed. \u201cI am not looking forward to cleaning up tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t think about it.\u201d James advises her sagely, carefully brushing her hair out of his eyes. After a moment of consideration, he slides off the bed in a distinctly boneless fashion, and disappears from view.\n\n\n \u201cIf you ignore something, you no longer have to deal with it.\u201d Sirius agrees. \u201cThis is a well-known truth.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSounds like your general education plan.\u201d Lily says.\n\n\n \u201cI think our only education plan in school was Remus.\u201d James comments from somewhere beneath the bed. Sirius blinks.\n\n\n \u201cAre you looking for something, Prongs?\u201d\n\n\n James mumbles something indiscernible. \n\n\n Lily is apparently unfazed. \u201cSay, have you seen Remus yet? Or Peter?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius shakes his head. \u201cOnly just got here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI believe Peter is currently christening our toilet.\u201d Comes James\u2019s muffled voice.\n\n\n \u201cEugh.\u201d Lily replies.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Sirius elbows his way through the veritable sea of people, nodding and waving at familiar faces as he goes. He manages to squeeze his way into the kitchen, twelve pack in hand, where he makes the mistake of opening the refrigerator. By some small miracle, he manages to catch every single bottle than spills out to greet him. He stuffs them back in haphazardly before shoving his own beer inside, where it forms a precarious-looking tower that will probably prove fatal to whoever opens the fridge next. Sirius Black does not particularly believe in karma.\n\n\n He twists the cap off his beer and tosses it into the over-flowing bin. Now that he\u2019s no longer in mortal danger of being suffocated by old classmates or buried by alcoholic beverages, he realizes that the fridge door has already been covered in a collage of photos. He tips his beer against his lips with a smile. There\u2019s several photos of James and Lily\u2019s recent trip to Canada; a photo of all five of them on the day they graduated; an even more recent photo of them on the day they moved in.\n\n\n There\u2019s another photo here that Sirius particularly likes, of all of them at the beach last summer. Lily, looking a bit sun-burnt in an obnoxiously huge red hat they\u2019d taken turns stealing all trip; James, an arm around her, hair wild and beyond all reason; Sirius next to him, sunglasses on, skin even darker than usual and looking especially cool\u2014and Peter next to him, nose peeling, hair blonde as wheat, and utterly ruining the effect. On Lily\u2019s other side is Remus, her arm around his waist, a genuine smile on his lips. That summer had been especially sunny for England; Sirius remembers being painfully distracted by how it had drawn out the freckles along Remus\u2019s nose and shoulders.\n\n\n It\u2019s a good photo of them, Sirius thinks; he keeps meaning to get it off Facebook and put it up in his flat. His and Remus\u2019s flat.\n\n\n It had made sense at the time, Sirius stubbornly reminds himself.\n\n\n He and James had moved in together immediately following their graduation, a plan that, objectively, was perfectly reasonable. They\u2019d barely been living together a month when it became clear that they\u2019d grossly miscalculated. It had been a ridiculous arrangement, because even though it was only Sirius and James\u2019 names on the lease, about sixty percent of the time, there\u2019d been two extra bodies attempting to live there with them.\n\n\n At the time, Lily had technically been living with her parents. They\u2019d charged her a low rent, and they were lovely people, but she, like all of them, wasn\u2019t used to living with parents after attending boarding school for so long. Perhaps more importantly however, she and James were practically one soul in two different bodies, and squeezing together in his and Sirius\u2019s flat was far more bearable than being apart.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s situation was only similar in the sense that he, also, was technically living at home. When they\u2019d been sixteen, Remus\u2019s mother had become ill and died all within a year. Sirius, James, and Peter had spent most of that year gently nudging Remus along, holding him up when he could no longer find the will to continue standing; finishing his homework for him when he couldn\u2019t drag himself out of bed, or when they couldn\u2019t find him. It had been James speaking quietly with their professors, wrangling longer deadlines or do-overs. It had been Peter, silently loading Remus\u2019s plate with food and gently but firmly convincing him to eat. It had been Sirius, discovering Remus in hidden alcoves, his hands pressed over his eyes and silent\u2014and it had been Sirius sitting quietly next to him, or pressing a hand to his shoulder, or leading him wordlessly back to bed. \n\n\n Remus had been close to his mother in a way that Sirius had envied, and desperately longed for. He had not shared that closeness with his father, and when Hope died, it had left Lyall hollowed out and empty in a way that Remus could not reconcile. Their relationship had grown stiff and polite, and being stuck in the house where his mother had grown sick and where his father wandered the halls in search of her ghost, was too suffocating for Remus to bare. He couldn\u2019t afford to live by himself or stay at the university with Peter, and so instead he\u2019d often slept on the floor of Sirius\u2019 bedroom.\n\n\n While neither he nor Lily technically contributed to the rent, they bought groceries, did the laundry, cleaned the apartment. They knew, and Sirius often suspected, had a private agreement, to provide for their keep in their own particular ways.\n\n\n James and Lily hadn\u2019t needed to tell Sirius their plans for domestic and private bliss; he\u2019d seen it coming from the moment he\u2019d woken up one day to find Lily making them all breakfast in their tiny kitchen, dressed in James\u2019s football jersey. He\u2019d spent the last three months of their lease convincing Remus to just move the hell in with me, Moony, my god. Remus had been hesitant, because his smaller budget meant they\u2019d have to look at apartments that even Sirius could\u2019ve afforded by himself. Sirius had waved this off every time, insisting he needed to ration his inheritance anyways. Meanwhile, Peter had watched all this nonsense with distant exasperation and immense gratitude for the existence of generous parents and student housing.\n\n\n This was how Sirius had come to live with Remus Lupin. It had been an exceptionally poor idea, given Sirius\u2019s wild and reckless feelings for the other boy. He was reminded of this each time he opened the door to find Remus crouched over their coffee table; every time their shoulders brushed as they passed one another in the narrow hallway; each time Remus brought him a cup of tea, or offered him a bite of his dinner, or walked him to the bus stop on his way to work. Every time he shot Sirius a mischievous smile, a gentle hello, something in Sirius\u2019s chest shuddered, leaving him desperate and unhinged, euphoric and painfully unhappy. \n\n\n It was an impossible thing, living with Remus Lupin--but Sirius was doing it anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe finds Peter draped tragically across the toilet, just as foretold.\n\n\n \u201cOh, Wormtail,\u201d Sirius says, patting the top of Peter\u2019s head sympathetically. \u201cNot even midnight, and you\u2019re already puking your guts out. How very typical of you.\u201d\n\n\n Unable to form a proper retort, Peter flips a shaky but respectable two finger salute in Sirius\u2019s direction.\n\n\n \u201cAs stimulating as this conversation is,\u201d Sirius tells the back of Peter\u2019s head. \u201cI have other matters to attend. Best of luck to you.\u201d\n\n\n He gives Peter another pat and escapes into the hall.\n\n\u00a0\n\n Some time later, feeing pleasantly fuzzy and unconcerned, he stops on his way to the bathroom to snag a glass of water and crackers. He takes a swig of beer and barrels head-first into the crowd.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ve brought provisions.\u201d Sirius announces as he enters the bathroom. Peter peers pitifully up at him from his spot on the floor. James is sitting in the bathtub next to Peter\u2019s head, talking loudly on his cellphone.\n\n\n \u201cWho\u2019s he talking to?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHis mum and dad.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOooh,\u201d Sirius exclaims, setting the crackers and water next to Peter, who eyes them with ill-disguised suspicion. \u201cJames, let me talk to them.\u201d\n\n\n He reaches for the phone, but James bats his hand away.\n\n\n \u201cYeah, you too, Mum.. Yeah, he\u2019s here..\u201d Sirius makes another attempt to retrieve the phone, and James scoots down the length of the bathtub to avoid him.\n\n\n \u201cThey\u2019re all here.. Well.. Yes, alright. Love you too.\u201d Scowling, he hands the phone to Sirius.\n\n\n \u201cHello, Mrs. Potter! Happy New Year!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, you as well, Sirius, dear. How have you been doing? Are you and Remus all settled in your new place?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius picks at a spot on his jeans, smiling. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s almost unpacked. He\u2019s run out of room for his books; I keep finding them underneath my bed.\u201d\n\n\n Mrs. Potter\u2019s delighted laugh sends a rush of warmth through his chest.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, Sirius. We miss you, all of you. We\u2019ll have a family dinner some time soon, alright?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cJust name the day, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get back to your party. We\u2019ll see you soon, dear.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGoodnight, Mrs. Potter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius tosses the phone back to James, who catches it with a grumble.\n\n\n \u201cShe likes you better than me.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Sirius replies sensibly.\n\n\n \u201cWhere\u2019s Remus?\u201d Moans Peter. It\u2019s usually Remus who tends to Peter when he\u2019s in such a state.\n\n\n \u201cI brought you crackers. And water.\u201d Sirius says, offended. \u201cYou know, Peter, sometimes I worry our friendship is one-sided.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat friendship?\u201d Peter groans into the toilet bowel, tilting his head to watch Sirius through a single bleary eye. \u201cYou mean, the one where you leave me to rot alone with my head in a toilet?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI was under the impression that you were taking a well-deserved nap. If I\u2019ve assumed incorrectly, I apologize.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGod, the sincerity.\u201d James hangs over the edge of the tub, fingers dangling above the floor tiles. \u201cGo fetch Moony, would you, Black?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBored of me already?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI want to have a.. chat.. with him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat sort of chat?\u201d\n\n\n James waggles his eyebrows. Sirius and\u00a0Peter exchange a dubious look.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s not a response.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGo fetch.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI need more information.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll tell you tomorrow,\u201d James says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not so drunk I can feel my own teeth.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s horrifying.\u201d Peter says, not unkindly.\n\n\n \u201cOh, Wormtail,\u201d Comes a hoarse, sympathetic voice from the door-way. Sirius turns to see Remus, his curly hair ruffled, his eye dark with drink. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA priest.\u201d Groans Peter.\n\n\n \u201cI already brought him crackers and water.\u201d Sirius says, incredulous. He looks up at Remus, who\u2019s face breaks out into a warm smile as their eyes meet. Something in Sirius\u2019s chest hums pleasantly. \u201cI hope he shows more gratitude towards you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, no, not at all,\u201d Remus says, and Peter makes a disgruntled noise into the toilet. \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d Sirius says, and means it. Remus\u2019s smile falters slightly. \u201cHow will he ever learn?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am right here, you know.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice echoes into the toilet bowl. \u201cI seem to remember various moments of kindness in our long and unhealthy friendships.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPoor Wormy.\u201d James sighs, reaching out from the bathtub to awkwardly pat Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Peter. I remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cProngs, you\u2019re kindness is duly noted. If you\u2019d really like to prove your devotion.. You could bring me some bread.\u201d\n\n\n James considers this. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCrackers.\u201d Sirius whines. \u201cPeter, there is a literal stack of crackers that I slaved over for you right next to your damn head.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou put them on the bathroom floor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I forgot, you are truly the epitome of hygiene. Is that vomit on your chin?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow quickly we turn on one another in the face of adversity.\u201d Remus says forlornly. \u201cPeter, I will get you your bread. James, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a lost cause.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not sure what will happen to me if I leave this bathtub.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course. Sirius?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius reaches out a hand, and Remus hauls him up, his fingers hot against the skin of Sirius\u2019s wrist. His hair is in a slight disarray, and he\u2019s wearing a pale green shirt that matches his eyes\u2014and, Sirius realizes suddenly, he\u2019s wearing a pair of Sirius\u2019s jeans. He reaches out a hand to steady himself against the wall. Remus shoots him the smallest frown and presses a hand to Sirius\u2019s shoulder to help balance him.\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be too long now. I fear he has only minutes left.\u201d James calls as they start down the hall together. As midnight approaches, party-goers have begun to drift out onto the balconies and to hover by the windows to catch better views of the fireworks. It means a less difficult journey for them to the kitchen, and they get there about forty-two minutes sooner than Sirius had expected. \n\n\n Remus leans his hip against the kitchen counter, dragging a hand through his tawny curls. He tilts his head towards Sirius and offers him a gentle, lop-sided smile. Remus\u2019s eyes are too green, his freckles too dear, the angle of his collar bone disappearing beneath his shirt too sharp and too within Sirius\u2019s grasp. The gentle hum of the party around them fades into something quiet, and this is not the sort of thing he was prepared for; not here, not in James and Lily\u2019s kitchen, in the very center of a party.\n\n\n \u201cAlright, Pads?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius\u2019s thoughts are a slow-moving, impending disaster. How he wants to pin Remus up against the cupboards, to crowd him into a corner; how he wants to intertwine their fingers, to brush his lips against Remus\u2019s forehead, his jaw. Instead, he settles for ducking his head and sliding a finger through the belt loop of Remus\u2019s jeans\u2014a ridiculous gesture so utterly intimate, even for the pair of them, that he only allows it because he\u2019s just drunk enough.\n\n\n \u201cStop stealing my bloody clothes, Lupin.\u201d He says quietly.\n\n\n Remus looks up at him, eyes dark, and murmurs pleasantly: \u201cBetter learn to do your own laundry then, Black. Consider it my fee.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius snorts, letting his hand fall, and turns away from Remus to search through the cupboards. His fingers, he understands in the distant, uncomprehending way drunkenness often entails, are shaking. \n\n\n Sometimes, he wonders.\n\n\n The issue isn\u2019t that Remus has no interest in men. Remus likes girls, but he likes boys too\u2014and Sirius has been riding the bisexuality train since before he can remember. The issue isn\u2019t that, because in another world, if they\u2019d met in a coffee shop, or a bar, or a grocery store, something might have happened between them. The issue is that where James was his brother, Remus was his best friend, and he had always been\u2014ever since the day James had dragged him over to the dining table and announced to a bewildered Sirius and Peter: \u201cYou will never believe what this kid just managed to pull on Filch,\u201d and promptly forced a twelve-year-old Remus into the seat next to him.\n\n\n They were all his family, and they still would\u2019ve been, even if he\u2019d had a real family to speak of. James, Peter, Lily.. And Remus.\n\n\n It wasn\u2019t worth the risk. It wasn\u2019t even a possibility that Sirius could contemplate, in even the vaguest sense, because the idea of Remus\u2019s rejection, and the subsequent slow, awkward, and heart-shattering dissolution of their friendship, makes his chest ache even more horribly than the gentle touch of Remus\u2019s fingers against Sirius\u2019s arm as he brushes past him.\n\n\n \u201cI say we bring him rye.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be cruel.\u201d Remus reminds him as he reaches for the fridge.\n\n\n \u201cI wouldn't open that if I were you.\u201d\n\n\n Remus eyes him warily, his fingers hovering over the handle. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius flings a cupboard open, the pounding of his heart an unsteady rhythm leading him to certain disaster. \u201cAccidentally arranged the world\u2019s worst game of Jenga. Ooh, is it too early for Cheesey Pasta?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cThere you are, Peter.\u201d Remus says, carefully balancing three slices of white bread across Peter\u2019s outstretched, waiting hand. \u201cAll better.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d Peter mumbles.\n\n\n Lily appears then, sliding an arm around Remus\u2019s waist affectionately. He drapes an arm around her shoulder like it belongs there, accepting her sudden presence with hardly a glance.\n\n\n \u201cHello all\u2014Oh, Peter.\u201d Peter, who appears to have lost all ability to respond in any vaguely human-related fashion, makes a groaning noise into the toilet by way of greeting. \u201cWell, you\u2019re nothing if not consistent.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d Sirius asks.\n\n\n \u201cGreat things.\u201d Lily informs him. \u201cI convinced Frank to run down to the store and use the rest of his savings to buy enough sparklers for everyone here. We have ten minutes to get downstairs, outside, and light them before midnight.\u201d \n\n\n James and Sirius share delighted looks. Peter groans in protest.\n\n\n \u201cThis is not optional, Peter.\u201d James tells him, scrambling out of the bathtub. \u201cI will carry you myself.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ll carry you.\u201d Sirius translates. \u201cWe all know Prongs played football for a reason. But I\u2019d really rather not, Peter, so do us a favor and get on your feet.\u201d\n\n\n Peter shifts half-heartedly. He hasn\u2019t vomited since Sirius first walked in on him nearly an hour ago\u2014possibly, he was just comfortable where he was. Possibly, having his closest friends doting on him was good enough incentive for him to stay put. Sirius can hardly blame him.\n\n They spend the next sixty three seconds poking, prodding, and yelling his name encouragingly, before he finally rises to his feet. James slaps his palm helpfully on Peter\u2019s shoulder, causing poor Wormtail to nearly collapse \u2014 but it takes only a few more minutes for them to pile out of the toilet and march down the hall to retrieve their coats.\n\n \u201cTake this.\u201d James shoves a violently neon coat at Remus. \u201cYou\u2019re not freezing to death in my own yard.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your jacket?\u201d Asks Sirius, frowning.\n\n\n \u201cI forgot it at work.\u201d Remus grimaces. \u201cJames, how in the hell have you not burned that monstrosity yet?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow in the hell did that thing get in my house?\u201d asks Lily, bewildered.\n\n\n James attempts to drape the coat across Remus\u2019s shoulders, but Remus immediately ducks behind Peter. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get hypothermia.\u201d James insists.\n\n\n \u201cI am not wearing that.\u201d Remus replies flatly. \u201cAliens are immediately going to abduct me. A plane might land on me.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIs that the same material they make those bike reflectors out of?\u201d Peter asks helpfully.\n\n\n \u201cMoony, don\u2019t be daft.\u201d Sirius says. \u201cYou\u2019ll get pneumonia. Just wear the... Is it a tent, James?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDeath is preferable.\u201d Remus says. \u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to get sick. Sirius is a terrible nurse, just so you know.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYou don\u2019t get sick from temperature. You get sick from bacteria and viruses.\u201d Remus retorts with an eye roll so grand, Sirius is shocked his eyes don\u2019t get stuck in the back of his head. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I want to accomplish before I die, it\u2019s to kill that line of logic.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSix minutes.\u201d Peter reminds them as he zips up his coat. \u201cSirius, when Remus dies later this week, I will not be helping you clear out his books.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPlease. They\u2019ve invaded every corner of the flat, they\u2019re practically sentient. At this rate, my only option will be to burn the whole building down.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n The party-goers have drifted out onto the street, the tiny lawn of the apartment complex about seven times too small for the massive crowd. Lily manages to find Frank and his many sparklers, distributing them amongst the five of them while shielding the tiny flame of her lighter from the stiff midnight breeze. Sirius barely has ahold of his for thirty seconds before he donates it to Marlene, who had been staring forlornly at her own sparkler lying dead in the snow. Someone shouts the time, and their massive group begins to murmur and shift in anticipation of the new year. Lily and James reach for each other, and Sirius whips his head up to find Remus a few feet away, shivering and happy, the orange light of sparklers casting warmth and light across his cheeks. He meets Sirius\u2019s eyes and grins, and Sirius\u2019s heart pounds fitfully in his chest. \n\n\n He crosses the distance between them, feeling light-headed and careless. \u201cAlright, Moony?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m fucking freezing.\u201d Remus replies, but he\u2019s still smiling. His cheeks are flushed despite, or perhaps, because of the cold. Sirius shoves his hands in his pockets.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re shivering. Want my jacket?\u201d\n\n\n Remus glances at the leather across Sirius\u2019s shoulder with feigned disinterest. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for me, and there\u2019s no point in both of us being cold. Where\u2019s your sparkler?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius makes a face. \u201cI gave mine to Marlene. She dropped her's in the snow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat was rather gentlemanly of you.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius scoffs. \u201cI am a perfect gentleman, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d\n\n\n Remus\u2019s eyes glitter. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if nearly a decade of friendship has led me to think otherwise.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius\u2019s mouth feels dry, his tongue reckless. \u201cOh, I assure you Remus, you haven\u2019t seen the worst of me.\u201d\n\n\n A long moment passes between them as Sirius\u2019s heart thunders\u00a0against his ribs. Remus\u2019s eyes are dark, and strange, and after a beat, he opens his mouth to reply\u2014but someone nearby shouts an update on the time and the mass of people begins to count down, startling them both. Sparklers wave around them, and Sirius joins in on the chant, because it\u2019s the loudest distraction he can latch onto at the moment. Cries of Happy New Year sound all around them, and Sirius turns back to Remus, finding the other boy\u2019s gaze already on him. \n\n\n \u201cHappy New Year, Remus.\u201d Sirius says. Remus tilts his head at him. His green eyes are lit up with the golden light around them, bright and electric.\n\n\n \u201cHappy New Year, Sirius.\u201d\n\n\nSeveral days later, Sirius lays draped across the couch, laptop balanced on his stomach as he scrolls aimlessly through university websites. For the seventh time in the last half hour, he stares forlornly at his tea, which sits lonesome on the coffee table, about one and a half centimeters beyond Sirius\u2019s reach. He glances at the clock in the corner of his screen\u2014Remus should have been home forty minutes ago. He gropes for his phone, which is somewhere in the couch cushions, possibly. Hopefully. After several minutes, he unearths it, unlocking the screen and finding Remus still has yet to respond.\n\n\n Their conversation so far, consisting only of Sirius\u2019s texts, is as follows:\n\n\n 5:27pm - when are you home\n\n\n  5:27pm - let\u2019s do something \n\n\n  5:27pm - let\u2019s go the zoo \n\n\n  5:28pm - or mini golfing \n\n\n  5:29pm - holy shit scratch that let\u2019s go bowling do you want to go bowling \n\n\n  5:30pm - actually tbh this is not a debate we are going bowling \n\n\n  5:34pm - remus i feel as though your silence indicates that you are not that enthusiastic about my bowling idea \n\n\n  5:40pm - i spent thirty entire seconds of my good time coming up with this plan and what do i get from you?? \n\n\n  5:50pm - pls note that all your belongings, including bed frame, can be found out by the trash bin, which coincidentally is your new home \n\n\n  6:07pm - are you dead in a ditch somewhere \n\n\n  6:13pm - oh my god do i need to bail you out of jail is it finally happening \n\n\n  6:30pm - i cannot believe this \n\n\n  6:42pm - LUPIN??? \n\n\u00a0\n\n Fifteen minutes from his last text, and still no reply. Sirius calls Remus, and yet again, it goes straight to voice mail. Logically, he knows that Remus\u2019s phone is probably just dead\u2014a chronic issue when it comes to Remus and his phone\u2014but still, he should have been back by now. He finds James in his contact list and presses Call.\n\n\n \u201cHello, Pads.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius groans by way of response.\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m bored. Remus has gone missing. I think the Promised Day has come.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, he was just here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYeah, he was at that loose leaf tea shop down the road and stopped by. He wanted me to look at this paper he\u2019s writing for class.\u201d There\u2019s a pause, and then the clattering of silverware somewhere in the background. \u201cHis phone was dead, but he left, I don\u2019t know, twenty minutes ago?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am\u2014oh fuck\u2014trying to make Lily a nice dinner.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius momentarily panics as he tries to determine what special event he could have possibly forgotten. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWell, Sirius, sometimes, when you love and adore someone, you bestow unexpected gifts upon them\u2014such as a delicious meal.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGod.\u201d Sirius says, both relieved and irritated. \u201cWhat are you making?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be some sort of.. Christ, I don\u2019t know. Like, a medley.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat, like a casserole?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYeah, that. It\u2019s not going very well.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius closes his eyes. \u201cThis is the worst conversation we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI could narrate for you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, fuck, no. Absolutely not.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMoony helped me find the recipe. I suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s not going well so far, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBleeding hell.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cRight, so I\u2019m trying to measure out this weird red seasoning that supposedly\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGoodbye, James. This has been the single most disappointing phone call I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\n\n \u201c\u2014but I think I may have used the wrong shaker thing, I mean honestly I\u2019m getting very cinnamon-y vibes, but that can\u2019t be right, can it\u2014\u201d\n\n\n Sirius hangs up the phone.\n\n\n He spends several seconds debating whether he should throw his phone across the room, but finally decides against it. His thumb hovers over Peter\u2019s number as he glowers down at the long list of emoji\u2019s next to Peter\u2019s name. Just then, however, comes the sound of footsteps and the jangling of keys fitting to a lock. The door opens and Sirius sits up, his laptop sliding off his stomach and safely onto the couch. Remus has two overflowing paper bags balanced uncertainly in his arms, his cheeks flushed and purple shadows beneath his eyes. He kicks the door behind him closed before allowing the bags and their contents to tumble out of his arms and onto the counter.\n\n\n \u201c\u2018lo, Pads.\u201d He calls, distracted with his attempt to both remove his boots and prevent several cans from rolling off the counter and exploding across the floor. Sirius excises himself from the couch and takes the three steps required to end up in their kitchen. He catches a rolling can as it makes its escape, and Remus looks up at him gratefully.\n\n\n \u201cIs your phone dead?\u201d Sirius asks as Remus unzips his jacket. The neckline of his t-shirt dips slightly at his throat, revealing the pale slope of his collar-bone. Sirius drags his gaze back to Remus\u2019s pale green eyes as he nods.\n\n\n \u201cI may have sent you several angry text messages.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI thought you were dead somewhere.\u201d Sirius complains only half-heartedly, pulling out the contents of the bags and arranging them in a disorganized pile. \u201cYou bought groceries?\u201d\n\n\n Remus grimaces. \u201cSort of.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius examines the contents of the second bag. \u201cYou bought more tea than actual food, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n Remus empties the contents of the second bag, and several small pouches tumble out. \u201cIsn\u2019t tea technically edible?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI was going to ask if you wanted to go bowling, but you look like you\u2019re about to fall over. Are you alright?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBowling?\u201d Remus shoots him a wry smile as he tosses their groceries into various cupboards. All food in their kitchen is of the canned, boxed, and packaged variety. Lily is, quite possibly, the only reason they\u2019re still alive.\n\n\n \u201cYes. I spawned many fantastical plans while you were gone but\u2014seriously, Remus, you look exhausted.\u201d\n\n\n Remus pushes a hand through his hair, tawny curls dark against his pale skin. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know.. I feel sort of off.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDid you sleep alright?\u201d\n\n\n Remus nods. \u201cYeah, just woke up tired.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll shower.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWant some tea?\u201d\n\n\n Remus shoots him a smile so grateful that Sirius may as well have offered to pay Remus\u2019s rent for the rest of his life.\n\n\n \u201cSirius,\u201d Remus says, gaze rooting Sirius to the spot. \u201cThat would be incredible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n The next day, Sirius comes home to discover a small tower of books stacked next to the door of their flat. He stares, with swelling incredulity, at the yellow sticky note stuck to the top-most book.\n\n\u00a0\n\n Thanks for taking these off my hands Remus, you\u2019re a life saver. Let\u2019s grab coffee soon. Hope you enjoy!\n\n\n  - Jess \n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cRemus?\u201d Sirius slams the door behind him. He tosses his coat onto the couch, glares at the twelve thousand books strewn across the living room that Remus hasn\u2019t bothered to organize yet, and storms his way down the hall. \u201cRemus,\u201d He growls again as he approaches Remus\u2019s closed bedroom door. He doesn\u2019t bother knocking before throwing the door open and storming inside--and stops dead.\n\n\n Remus is sprawled across his bed, shirtless and on his stomach, sheets tangled around his waist. He starts, eyes heavy-lidded, cheeks flushed, damp hair pushed all across his forehead. He looks miserable, and half-alive.\n\n\n \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius is frozen in the door way.\n\n\n \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\n\n\n Remus groans weakly in response, burying his face in his arm.\n\n\n \u201cSick. Up all night.\u201d His voice is hoarse, and unhappy. \u201cI think my skin is on fire. I think I have just entered the fifth circle of Hell.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cChrist, Moony, why didn\u2019t you text me? I would\u2019ve gotten you some pills or something.\u201d Remus\u2019s back is slick with sweat, his hair pushed up all around the back of his neck, like he\u2019s been shoving it away. \u201cHave you taken anything today?\u201d\n\n\n Remus shakes his head. \u201cThe only thing in our cupboards is dust and spiders, Pads.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius sighs, watching him fondly. Remus rarely falls ill, so when he does, it\u2019s usually the most vengeful bugs that take him down. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n While he runs a cloth underneath cold water with one hand, he rings James with the other. \n\n\n \u201cHey, Sirius.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, hey, Lils. Where\u2019s James?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe went out to grab groceries and left his phone here. Means he won\u2019t have the list. By the time he walks through the doors, he\u2019ll have forgotten why he\u2019s even there.\u201d There\u2019s a muffled noise as she transfers the mobile to her other ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cRemus is ill. He might be dying.\u201d He frowns down the hall at Remus\u2019s bedroom door. \u201cDo you have any Ibuprofen we can borrow?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course. James took the car, but I could meet you half-way?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAre you insane? It\u2019s blizzarding. I\u2019ll come grab it from you. I don\u2019t need two inept lumps to look after.\u201d\u00a0\nSirius carefully transports the dripping cloth down the hall. \u201cMoony, here you go.. Just let me..\u201d He drapes the cloth across the back of Remus\u2019s neck, and Remus twitches.\n\n\n \u201cNo, please, drown me. End my misery.\u201d He squints at Sirius with cloudy eyes. \u201cDid you perhaps leave a trail of small still-water pools on your way down the hall?\u201d\n\n\n Lily snorts into his ear. \u201cWell, he\u2019s still capable of snark. At least his mind hasn\u2019t boiled over from fever.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius glowers down at Remus. \u201cListen, you ungrateful shit: I\u2019m gonna run down to James and Lily\u2019s and grab enough pills to medicate you into a coma. Do you want soup or something?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ll make him something. Make sure he eats, Sirius. And drinks. The more dehydrated he gets, the worse he\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius rolls his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as James.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n He returns an hour later with tomato soup, half the contents of Lily\u2019s personal medicine cabinet, and various vitamin-C laden produce. \n\n\n \u201cCut up some cucumbers and lemon and throw them in a cup of water. It\u2019s soothing for the throat,\u201d Lily had instructed as she\u2019d thrown a bag together. \u201cAnd I know the bottle says only one every four hours because it\u2019s \u2018Extra Strength,\u2019 or whatever, but give him two anyways.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cThanks, Lily,\u201d Sirius had said, accepting the bag gratefully. \u201cI\u2019ll grab you some cash when I\u2019m over next.\u201d\n\n\n Lily had waved her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Text if you need any help, alright?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n He butchers the cucumber, and the lemon is reduced to a torn pulpy mass, but he shoves what he can into the glass, ice cubes nearly over-flowing out the top. He digs around in the cupboard and finds three bendy straws somewhere beneath the cutlery, adding one to Remus\u2019s glass, and mentally filing away the location of the other two for later use. \n\n\n \u201cMoooony,\u201d He calls softly, pushing the door open, glass in one hand and bottle of pills in the other. Remus is laying on his back now, an arm thrust over his eyes, lips parted, breathing heavy. Sirius sets the glass on the table, hovering uncertainly. There\u2019s no infirmary to take him to, no RA to ask for help. This is all Sirius.\n\n\n \u201cRemus, do you want some Ibuprofen?\u201d Remus doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019ve got some water.\u201d The cloth Sirius brought him is lying unfolded across his chest, rising and falling with each breath. His hand hovers over Remus\u2019s shoulder, uncertain, and then he touches him, gentle, pushing just enough to wake him. His skin is on fire.\n\n\n Remus's lips part, and he makes a soft noise. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n \"I have Ibuprofen. And water.\" Sirius says quietly.\u00a0\n\n\n \"Oh,\" Remus replies, unmoving.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" Sirius murmurs, gentle, and Remus moves to sit up, balancing his head on his palms. \"How are you?\"\n\n\n Remus just shakes his head, bleary-eyed, and Sirius hands him two pills and a glass of water. It's a testament to how truly ill Remus is that he doesn't comment on the colourful floating massacre within his water glass. He takes a small sip, staring with half-lidded eyes at nothing.\n\n\n \"Want a cold cloth?\"\n\n\n Remus's chin tilts slightly to the left, which Sirius takes as a yes. He peels away the cloth from the sheets where it's fallen (it's still soaking wet, but there's nothing cold about it), and takes it to the sink to rewet. He wrings it out before taking it back down the hall. Sirius lays it on the back of Remus's neck, and Remus makes a single blissful noise at this, causing something in Sirius's chest to flutter in an entirely undignified manner.\u00a0\n\n\n \"Need anything else?\" Sirius says, sitting on the edge of Remus's bed. He knows he's being utterly ridiculous, that Remus is nearly twenty one years old and fully capable of wallowing in his own fevered agony, of getting his own medication and glasses of lemon-murder-water. In fact, if Remus wasn't nearly delirious with fever, he would probably recognize how unbelievably absurd this whole thing is too.\u00a0\n\n\n Remus shakes his head, the heels of his hands pushed into his eyes, his sweaty hair wild around his forehead, around his ears.\u00a0\n\n\n \"Alright,\" Sirius says, easing his way off the bed. \"I'm not going anywhere today, so just text or groan or throw something if you need me.\" \n\n\n But just as he moves to stand, there's a hand suddenly, fingers wrapped loose around his wrist. Sirius turns, heart thudding uncomfortably in his chest, and Remus isn't quite looking at him, his expression raw, and uncertain, like he isn't sure if he's even awake. His eyes are heavy-lidded, ringed with purple, and foggy.\u00a0\n\n\n \"Can you..\" He swallows. His voice is hardly louder than a whisper, a series of cracks. \"Stay for a bit?\"\u00a0\n\n\n Sirius stares at the fingers around his wrist. He feels dizzy.\u00a0\n\n\n \"Yeah, alright.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n When Remus falls back asleep less than ten minutes later, Sirius inches carefully off the foot of the mattress (though, really, he doesn\u2019t need to be quiet. Remus is practically dead), and creeps across the hall to his room. Minutes later, he returns, laptop in hand.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s bed is pushed up against the wall, the head of it set squarely in the corner. Usually, when Remus isn\u2019t dying of plague, it\u2019s covered in a heavy quilt his mother made him. Sirius scoops it up from the floor where Remus probably threw it in over-heated delirium, and crawls onto the foot of Remus\u2019s bed. He leans with his back against the wall, knees propped at an angle to balance his laptop, and silently scrolls down Facebook as Remus pants and groans and tosses around next to him. Every half-hour or so, Sirius re-wets the cloth.\n\n\n At some point, Remus\u2019s fever turns, and he begins to shiver, curling in on himself and shaking, and Sirius drapes first the quilt, and then his own blankets, across him. \n\n\n And so, the evening passes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n ***\n\n\u00a0\n\n Remus coughs, a dry, hacking noise, and Sirius glances up, popping a headphone out and tapping the pause button. Remus\u2019s green-gold eyes blink back at him wearily.\n\n\n \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Sirius asks quietly. \u201cDo you want water, Moony? Or medication? What do you need?\u201d\n\n\n Remus shakes his head feebly. He\u2019s quiet, for a moment, looking at Sirius. \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius frowns, suddenly embarrassed. \u201cYou asked me\u2014\u201d His voice stutters to a halt. \u201cWant me to go?\u201d\n\n\n Remus shakes his head again. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d His voice is so quiet, Sirius has to focus on the movement of his lips to understand him.\n\n\n \u201cParks and Rec. Sorry, is the light bothering you? I can stop.\u201d\n\n\n Remus sighs, shoving some of the blankets away from his chest, so that his shoulders, his collar bone, are awash in the cool blue light of Sirius\u2019s laptop. \n\n\n \u201cCan I watch?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius blinks. It takes him a moment to soothe the thing that has gone a bit panicky in his chest. \u201cShove over, then.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius crawls his way up the bed and burrows forward, his one shoulder pressed up against the wall, his other shoulder pressed up against Remus. He settles the laptop between their stomachs, dimming the brightness even further, unplugging the headphones. Remus sighs again, his entire body relaxing back into the blankets, the bare skin of his shoulder, and his hip, pressing into Sirius. His skin is still warm, his breathing still ragged, and Sirius feels the edges of whatever\u2019s left of his sanity begin to fray. \n\n\n \u201cAlright, Moony?\u201d Sirius whispers. \n\n\n But Remus is already asleep.\n\n\nIt\u2019s James that wakes Sirius up, though clearly it wasn\u2019t intentional. While something as innocuous as a cupboard closing can rouse Sirius, Remus can fall asleep in the middle of a concert\u2014and so when James swears from Remus\u2019s door way, Sirius is awake immediately, though bleary-eyed and confused.\n\n\n \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Sirius grumbles, squinting and still half-asleep. \u201cJames?\u201d Next to him, Remus shifts.\n\n\n \u201cSorry, mate.\u201d James says, leaning on the doorframe and biting his lip to keep his expression carefully neutral. Unfortunately, he can\u2019t seem to get his left eyebrow under control; it\u2019s arching so wildly it\u2019s disappeared beneath his fringe. \u201cI called, but your phone is dead, and I didn\u2019t want to bother Moony.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d Sirius hisses. His face is hot. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake him.\u201d But even as he says it, Remus stirs again next to him, and his eyes flutter open. \n\n\n \u201cThe hell, James?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cHey Moony,\u201d James says brightly. \u201cI brought supplies. And a Lily.\u201d He adds, as Lily appears behind his shoulder. Her mouth twitches.\n\n\n \u201cGood sleep, you two?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n Remus is huddled on the floor in front of the coffee table, his mother\u2019s quilt draped across his shoulders and looking exhausted, but content. Lily sits on the floor across from him, quietly discussing her latest political science project.\n\n\n \u201cIs Peter coming?\u201d Sirius is standing next to James, who is stirring the soup they brought as it bubbles overtop the stove. James nods. Glances at Sirius. Looks back at the soup.\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius demands, irritated. James rolls his eyes.\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be a toddler. Also\u2014and I can\u2019t believe I have to ask\u2014but do you have any bowls?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius falters. \u201cWe had.. one, last I checked. Remus brought all his mugs over, though.\u201d\n\n\n James shakes his head. \u201cTogether, the two of you barely form one functioning human being. Alright, bring me the mugs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cOh, brilliant.\u201d Lily says brightly as Sirius hands her a mug of soup. \u201cNow I know why you\u2019re at our flat so often.\u201d \n\n\n Sirius sits down cross-legged next to her, across from Remus.\n\n\n \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d Sirius asks, taking a sip from his mug and scalding most of his throat. \n\n\n Remus shoots him a ragged smile, eyes soft, and Sirius has to look down at his soup. \u201cA bit better.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better once you have food in you.\u201d Lily advises him gently. \n\n\n There\u2019s a knock on the door, and before James can remove his oven mitts, Peter appears in the doorway. He stamps his boots on the mat, dusting snow from the blue hat Lily knitted him last winter, and stashes they keys Remus and Sirius had gifted him back into his coat pocket.\n\n\n \u201cHello all,\u201d He calls, and they greet him with a single jumbled chorus of his name. James promptly hands him a steaming mug, and the pair of them join the rest on the floor. The couch, Sirius muses, thread-bare and comfortable, was a thoughtful gift from his uncle, but unnecessary; either they all sat on the couch, or no one did.\n\n\n Peter looks warily at Remus. \u201cDon\u2019t breathe on me.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius snorts. \u201cIf I\u2019m not sick yet, you\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHm,\u201d Peter replies, unconvinced. \u201cAnyway, I brought some movies, and popcorn. I thought we could have a movie night.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes!\u201d Lily exclaims, clapping her hands together. She falters, glancing at Remus. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling well enough, Remus, of course.\u201d\n\n\n The tension in the room is practically physical as they all stare at Remus. He chuckles hoarsely. \u201cDon\u2019t let my impending death stop you.\u201d\n\n\n Peter and James argue over Peter\u2019s allegedly poor choice in films for about ten minutes longer than Sirius has the attention span for. Finally, Lily catches his eye, and with a roll of her eyes, snags one of the DVD\u2019s and shoves it into the DVD player. Peter and James put up a fuss, but once the opening theme of Howl\u2019s Moving Castle begins to play, they\u2019re lulled into silence. They\u2019re sitting in a ridiculous conglomerate, the blankets he and James had dragged from Sirius\u2019s room (Remus\u2019s sheets were not to be trusted) draped across them in an utterly haphazard formation, several bowls of popcorn distributed between them. Next to him, Remus\u2019s chin is balanced on his hands, eyes only half open, their shoulders pressed together.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make it five minutes.\u201d Sirius murmurs to him gently, and Remus barely manages to elbow him. \n\n\n \u201cNo faith in me.\u201d Remus mumbles back. He straightens, making an attempt to revive himself, and Sirius ducks his head to hide his smile.\n\n\n Barely five minutes later, Remus\u2019s head droops. Sirius silently removes the popcorn bowl from his lap and says nothing at all.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Nearly a week later, by which time poor Moony had managed to regain at least some semblance of his former humanity, Sirius comes home to find a miracle in the form of Remus Lupin with a frying pan in his hand.\n\n\n \u201cWhere did you even find that?\u201d Sirius asks by way of greeting, pulling his scarf, (yet another present from Lily), away from his mouth. The moment he does, he\u2019s greeted by the stench of burnt food. He wrinkles his nose at Remus, who turns to face him, looking both slightly panicked and utterly defeated.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re home early.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBar was dead.\u201d Sirius shrugs his coat off. He raises his chin in an attempt to identify what Remus is failing to cook. \u201cYou know, Moony, I\u2019m fairly certain if you set the flat on fire, we won\u2019t be seeing our security deposit back.\u201d\n\n\n Remus sighs, poking the toxic-looking mass in the frying pan with a spatula. \u201cI followed the recipe exactly. I\u2019m the reason any of us passed chemistry. I can follow instructions. How is this so difficult?\u201d\n\n\n Sirius eyes the sludge with suspicion. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\n Remus sighs again, and the disappointment on his face, Sirius is surprised to note, is genuine. \u201cIt was supposed to be for you.\u201d He scowls at the frying pan. Sirius blinks, confused.\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re making me dinner? That\u2019s awfully domestic of you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI was trying to make you dinner. I mean, I suppose you could attempt to eat it, if you\u2019re feeling masochistic. Lily insisted this would be fool-proof, even for me.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius, feeling faintly light-headed and more than a little confused, leans forward to inspect the mass further, hoping to find some redeeming qualities. He comes up empty. \u201cLily always did have too much faith in us. Moony, why, exactly, were you making me dinner?\u201d In their decade long friendship, Remus had never once attempted to provide him with such an unwarranted.. delight? Horror? The longer he stares at the burnt food, the louder his confusion begins to clamor.\n\n\n Remus is muttering to himself, irritated, pushing the blob around in the frying pan, as if willing it to shed its crusted, horrifying outer skin and reveal something edible beneath. He\u2019s ignoring Sirius, but as is so often the case, this only makes Sirius push harder.\n\n\n \u201cRemus, are you ever going to tell me what I did to deserve you trying to poison me?\u201d Sirius taps his fingers against the counter, his chin resting in the palm of his opposite hand as he watches Remus with an overwhelming sense of both befuddlement and fondness. Remus glances at him, then looks back to the frying pan.\n\n\n \u201cWhen I was sick..\u201d He says finally, in a quiet sort of voice, not quite looking at Sirius. \u201c... Well. Just wanted to thank-you, that\u2019s all.\u201d He gives the frying pan a half-hearted shake, then rolls his eyes, before turning and dumping its contents into the bin. \u201cHow about some toast? I could make some toast. Possibly.\u201d His voice is light, but Sirius can tell how genuinely frustrated he is. Sirius meanwhile, feels utterly dazed.\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Moony. You don\u2019t need to thank me. And toast.. Seems a bit over-ambitious, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n\n Remus glances at him, looking thoroughly unimpressed, though with himself, the situation, or Sirius, it\u2019s impossible to say. His cheeks are faintly pink, and he\u2019s chewing on his lip, jaw tense. He\u2019s embarrassed, Sirius realizes.\u00a0 \n\n\n His eyes, Sirius can\u2019t help but notice, are so very soft in this evening light.\n\n\n\u201cWhat was it supposed to be, anyway?\u201d Sirius asks, because he\u2019s been watching Remus for too long. Remus looks away.\n\n\n \u201cAn omelette.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius\u2019s cackle earns him an oven-mitt to the head.\n\n\u00a0\n\n Term begins again, and Remus begins spending more time away from the flat, either in class, working, or studying at the library. As the weeks pass, Remus\u2019s assignments begin to pile higher, and Sirius comes home from work to find the other boy crouched over their coffee table more and more often.\n\n\n Tonight, he manages to leave work just past two in the morning. Remus barely glances up from his laptop screen as Sirius kicks off his boots and hangs his coat on the hook. The other boy is cross-legged on the floor, fingers still on the keyboard as he rereads his essay for what is most likely the thirty seventh time. He\u2019s wearing a knit green jumper that Sirius likes because it brings out his eyes, and his curly hair is in utter disarray, because, as Sirius knows, he\u2019s probably been pulling at it. He puts the kettle on before he eases his way down onto the floor next to Remus.\n\n\n \u201cHow was work?\u201d Remus murmurs, even as he deletes and replaces several words.\n\n\n \u201cGood.\u201d Sirius leans close to study Remus\u2019s screen. He\u2019s added several new pages since yesterday. \u201cHow\u2019s your essay?\u201d\n\n\n Remus deletes an entire paragraph in answer, treating his keyboard as aggressively as Sirius has ever seen him treat anything. He grins. \u201cWant me to take a look at it?\u201d \n\n\n Remus waves a hand, indicating the far-reaching depths of his disinterest, and Sirius slides the laptop towards him. He often offers to read Remus\u2019s work, not because Remus needs the help, but because typically, he\u2019s so obviously in need of a break. He skims the first few pages, having already read them enough times that he practically has them memorized. The extent of Sirius\u2019s knowledge regarding the Russian Revolution begins and ends with the beloved animated film, Anastasia, so there is little for him to do in the way of fact-checking. He can however, keep an eye out for any spelling or grammatical mistakes that an overly-sleepy Remus might let slip\u2014and provide some small measure of encouragement.\n\n\n \u201cI really like this bit,\u201d Sirius murmurs, pointing out a newer paragraph. \u201cThe way you worded it.. You have this knack for making even the most convoluted, driest nonsense into something worth reading, Remus.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe Russian Revolution is actually quite interesting.\u201d Remus objects, forever unable to accept a compliment. He looks slightly cheered, however, as Sirius hands the laptop back to him. His eyes dart across the page as he rereads yet another paragraph, and sighs deeply before rubbing his eyes. \u201cI suppose it\u2019ll seem less hopeless in the morning.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius leans back, tilting his head and leveling Remus with the most serious expression he can muster so close to 3:00 am. \u201cExactly. And anyway, Remus, you should get some sleep. The longer you stare at it, the worst it\u2019ll seem.\u201d\n\n\n Remus makes a non-committal noise and lowers his cheek into the palm of his hand, matching Sirius\u2019s gaze, utterly exhausted. He studies Sirius\u2019s face like it\u2019s a comfortable resting place for his eyes, which are soft and fond in the pale light. It\u2019s a look that makes Sirius\u2019s chest sting painfully, acutely, even as he finds he cannot look away from it. It\u2019s a look that forces him to use every ounce of shaking resolve within him not to close the gap between them.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s lips part, as if he\u2019s about to say something, and all at once, the air between them sharpens into something electric, and dangerous. The world whittles down to just the two of them; to the freckles dusted across Remus\u2019s cheeks, the gentle slope of his neck\u2014the inches between them.\n\n\n Every part of Sirius aches.\n\n\n The seconds stretch long and hungry, and Sirius thinks about all the things he wants to do to the skin below Remus\u2019s jaw. He thinks about how it might feel to press his lips to the corner of Remus\u2019s mouth. Instead, he asks, mouth dry: \u201cTea?\u201d\n\n\n Remus\u2019s eyes drop from his. He nods. Sirius wanders into the kitchen, dazed and feeling as though his insides have been stuffed with cotton. He\u2019s suddenly bone-tired, just this side of delirious with exhaustion; just mad enough to do something he should not, cannot do. He lingers by the tea mugs longer than is necessary, feeling on edge and electric and desperately unhappy.\n\n\n He abandons Remus\u2019s mug on the coffee table, mumbles his good night, and crawls into bed, where he proceeds to bury his face in a pillow and spend the next hour miserably inventorying every useless detail about the Russian Revolution he can recall.\n\n\nSeveral days later, Sirius is sitting cross-legged on the floor, a rather haphazard-looking list of several different university courses scrawled onto lined paper before him, when Remus clatters through the door.\n\n\n \u201cHey, Moony.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPadfoot,\u201d Remus greets him, but there\u2019s a set to his mouth, a hard glint in his eyes, that makes something flutter uncomfortably in Sirius\u2019s chest.\n\n\n \u201cWhat is it, Remus? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\n Remus\u2019s jaw works, like he\u2019s chewing on the inside of his cheek. He shakes his head, reaches into his pocket, and extracts a letter. Sirius\u2019s heart thuds uncomfortably.\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d Remus says quietly, extending the letter to him.\n\n\n Sirius untangles himself from his spot on the floor and accepts the letter, turning it over. There\u2019s no sender information, only Sirius\u2019s name and address. He stares at it, very hard.\n\n\n \u201cWant me to open it?\u201d Remus asks quietly.\n\n\n Sirius shakes his head. He feels somehow both intensely numb and horribly on edge. He peels open the flap of the envelope and removes the paper from inside. It takes him only a few seconds for the words, written in curling gold lettering, to make sense to him. He scoffs in disgust and tosses the letter onto their kitchen counter, shaking his head.\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a wedding invitation. Narcissa is getting married.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d Remus picks the invitation up, disbelieving.\n\n\n Sirius shakes his head again, staring at it. He\u2019s disgusted. He\u2019s angry. He\u2019s so, so tired.\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not really an invitation.\u201d He says, unnecessarily, because Remus already knows his family, and understands what this is\u2014but saying the words out loud make them real. \u201cShe only sent it so that I would know I wasn\u2019t invited. Just one more family event I\u2019m not welcome to, just one more reminder that..\u201d \n\n\n \u201cShe didn\u2019t put the return address on it, because she wanted you to open it. How did they even find our address?\u201d Remus murmurs, not quite with disbelief--because there was nothing surprising about this, especially when his family had committed far worse acts against him. Against them all. It was perhaps a sort of disappointment, that this was still something that, so many years later, they could still come home to. That even after so many years, they still could not let Sirius go. He turns the invitation over and over in his hands, as if the truth of it might transform into something less spiteful.\n\n\n \u201cGood ol\u2019 Cissy.\u201d Sirius says. He closes his eyes. The old anger, the resentment, the bitter sadness that accompanied all reminders of his family, required more energy that this ridiculous, petty piece of paper deserved. He\u2019d spent all his childhood with that anger, and that bitterness. Now, it just made him tired. \u201cWell.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know what else to say. There were no more words; he\u2019d used them all up, repeated them, twisted and turned them around. He\u2019d long since grown tired of the sound of his own bitterness. \n\n\n He meets Remus\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n When he wanders back into the kitchen, the ends of his hair damp against the nape of his neck, the letter is nowhere to be seen. He recognizes the tugging impulse to crawl into the nearest bed and allow it to absorb him, but Remus tosses a coat at him, and speaks, his tone kind, but leaving no room for argument.\n\n\n \u201cCome on. We\u2019re going out.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius is content to allow Remus to lead him wherever, his mind quiet and dull. They trudge in silence down the sidewalk, and it doesn\u2019t take long for Sirius to recognize where Remus is taking him.\n\n\n A half hour later, James opens the door of his and Lily\u2019s apartment, clearly having been expecting them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you think you\u2019re bringing that slush into this house\u2014God, you two are utterly uncivilized, aren\u2019t you? I never should have allowed you to move in together.\u201d\n\n\n Remus tosses his coat at James\u2019s head with practiced ease, and James\u2019s grumbling are momentarily muffled as he attempts to free himself. Lily\u2019s head appears from around the corner, flour on her cheek. She winks at Sirius.\n\n\n \u201cSomething to eat, love?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n Peter arrives soon after. No one mentions the letter, and Sirius is grateful. It\u2019s a pointless thing to discuss and dissect. The only option is to plough right through it, to put it out of his mind. After all, the remedy for the family he was born into is before him in the form of the family he\u2019d chosen for himself. He allows them to smother him with their kindness and understanding and their love for him. Sometimes, he worries he is too selfish with their love\u2014but today, he understands there is no such thing. He soaks in Lily\u2019s gentle touches to his shoulder, Peter\u2019s banter, James\u2019s threats to evict him from their apartment if they doesn\u2019t purchase legitimate cutlery in the next week.. Remus\u2019s hoarse laugh, and his steady presence next to him. His gentle eyes.\n\n\n They spend the night gorging themselves on popcorn and Lily\u2019s baking, huddled on the floor watching a series of laughably terrible horror movies. They fall asleep like that, in an absurd and comfortable pile on the floor. In the morning, James and Lily fashion them a spectacular breakfast. Leaning against the doorframe, Sirius watches them shifting and moving around one another, handing each other spatulas and spices and all manner of things that mystify Sirius and cause Remus to groan with jealousy. At one point, he and James pile on Peter in an effort to rouse him from his curled-up position in the armchair, apparently shattering several of his ribs and all their good fortune. They gather around the dining table to eat, and an uproar is caused when they discover there\u2019s only four available dining chairs (the fifth and sixth having been inexplicably missing since the New Years Party). Peter wryly proposes that Remus and Sirius share a seat, the suggestion leaving Sirius caught somewhere between the desire to slide boneless onto the carpet, and the need to remove Peter\u2019s limbs from his torso. Fortunately, Lily, having long-ago reached the pinnacle of wisdom, manages to locate an extra stool. They devour the breakfast in under ten minutes and spend the rest of the hour hurling banter and affection back and forth across the table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n Noon arrives, and they gather in the hallway. Sirius is watching Remus pull on his coat when James\u2019s arm comes around Sirius\u2019s shoulder. He leans forward, their heads close together, almost conspiratorially.\n\n\n \u201cAlright, mate?\u201d James says, very quietly.\n\n\n James\u2019s arm is heavy across his shoulder, and reassuring. Lily, her hair untidy and in James\u2019s football jersey, stands next to Peter, who is muttering something to Remus with a sly grin, making Remus laugh. \n\n\n Sirius meets James\u2019s eyes. \n\n\n \u201cYes.\u201d He says, and means it.\n\n\n James dips his head and nods, giving Sirius\u2019s shoulder a final squeeze. He slides his arm from Sirius, hand snaking out to make an absolute disaster of Sirius\u2019s hair and effectively shattering their decade-long friendship. Of course, the only suitable response to this is grabbing a fistful of James\u2019s collar and yanking James forward at what he hopes is a painful angle. Their scrapping lasts all of thirty seconds before Remus is yanking them apart with the look of a man who has long since resigned himself to the impossibility of ever living a peaceful life in the company of his friends. Peter chuckles next to Lily, who is holding Sirius\u2019s coat out towards him, looking perfectly unfazed. He takes his coat, meeting James\u2019s eyes. They share a grin that starts off goofy, but softens into something warm, and affectionate. James winks at him. From men, to boys, and back again, as simply as that. \n\n\n Remus claps him on the shoulder, steering him out the door. Sirius puts up a fuss as Remus calls over his shoulder, \u201cGot to get him back to the pound by one or they won\u2019t take him back\u2014I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d Sirius waves at the three of them as Remus deposits him out the door. He grins cheekily as Remus pulls his hat over his curly hair, rolling his eyes and smiling.\n\n\n The walk back to their flat is quiet and comfortable. It\u2019s early; the sky is the soft grey of February mornings, and they\u2019re the only people who seem willing to brave the chilly outdoors. The streets are bathed in pale light, and snowflakes drift lazily down from above. Remus is a mismatch of colours on this quiet street--his tawny hair beneath the burgundy of his hat, his soft eyes and softer smile. He feels Sirius staring and turns. He tilts his head, eyebrows furrowed and ever so slightly concerned.\n\n\n Sirius ducks his head and turns his gaze forward. He\u2019s been reckless lately. Too reckless. He needs to reign himself back in, get a hold of himself. \n\n\n This is impossible, he thinks. It\u2019s utterly impossible, to be around Remus, to walk and eat with him, to come home every night to find him on the floor of their living room, working himself late into the night.\n\n\n He\u2019d thought he could do this; he\u2019d done it for so long\u2014but that was when Peter and James and even Lily, had been around. Now, there was nothing to distract him from the way Remus looked in this pale morning light, as they walked back to their flat. Their flat.\n\n\n Living with Remus Lupin was an impossible thing; it stung, a vivid and acute pain, sharp and singing and electric\u2014but the idea of not living with him, now, after the gift of Remus\u2019s sleepy smile on his way to the kitchen in the morning, after tripping over so many stacks of books so many times..\n\n\n There was impossible\u2014and then there was worse. \n\n\n There\u2019s snow falling gently all around them, landing in the hair that has escaped Remus\u2019s hat. He looks tired and warm, bundled up as he is, his cheeks faintly pink. He turns those gentle eyes on Sirius, and asks quietly, \u201cAlright, Pads?\u201d\n\n\n Sometimes, Sirius feels as though all he\u2019s ever wanted were impossible things. \n\n\n \u201cYes.\u201d He says, even though he isn\u2019t. \u201cListen, Moony, thanks for bringing me. I appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\n Remus shrugs, still with that deliberately mild air. He turns his gaze back to the road.\n\n\n\u201cWhen my mum--\u201d Remus hesitates, and then says, carefully, as if he\u2019s having trouble deciding on the right words: \u201cWell. You took care of me.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius\u2019s gaze whips to Remus.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s eyes are on the road ahead, far away from Sirius. There\u2019s snow all around them, snow in his hair, and Remus is saying all the right things, and somehow making everything about this so unbearably hard. Sirius\u2019s chest aches, his eyes are stinging, and he doesn\u2019t understand why. He presses the heel of his hand into his eyes; takes a single, steadying breath.\n\n\n He turns his gaze back to the road. \n\n\n Impossible.\n\n\nSeveral days later, Sirius barely has the key in the lock when his phone begins ringing. He does a frantic dance as he attempts to open the door whilst answering his phone, nearly dropping the groceries. \n\n\n \u201cProngs,\u201d He growls, depositing the bags onto the counter. From down the hall, he hears Remus call out a greeting.\n\n\n \u201cPadfoot,\u201d James replies, breathless. \u201cSirius. Listen..\u201d\n\n\n Sirius stills. \u201cAre you alright? You sound a bit mad.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ve done something.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius leans against the counter. \u201cWhat, do you need bail money?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSirius,\u201d James says, impatient. \n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius rolls his eyes, rearranging the groceries along the counter.\n\n\n \u201cI.. I\u2019ve done it. She said yes.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius\u2019s hand, curled around a tomato, freezes.\n\n\n \u201cYou what? I thought you were going to wait until\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know,\u201d James says, suddenly speaking very quickly, as though he\u2019d kept the story pent up and now couldn\u2019t wait another moment longer. \u201cBut I just woke up this morning, and I looked at her, and I thought, honestly, I love her, Sirius, I love her so much, and I thought, I could wait until spring, and take her out like I planned\u2014or I could just do it, right now, in this home that we\u2019ve made, and wouldn\u2019t that be alright, too? So I made her this dinner, and it wasn\u2019t bad actually, and then I just did it, and she said yes.\u201d\n\n\n It takes a long moment to sink in\u2014and then he laughs, a bark of pure joy.\n\n\n \u201cJames.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know, mate.\u201d He can hear the laughter, the genuine happiness in James\u2019s voice.\n\n\n \u201cHoly shit. Holy shit.\u201d\n\n\n He can barely contain himself. He whoops, grinning so hard his face feels as though it may crack in half with the joy of it. \u201cGive her the phone, I have to talk to her.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cShe\u2019s on the phone with her mum, but I\u2019ll tell her to call you when she\u2019s done.\u201d \n\n\n Sirius dashes down the hall, throwing Remus\u2019s bedroom door open. Remus is sitting cross legged on his bed, laptop across his knees. He looks up at Sirius curiously, removing a headphone.\n\n\n \u201cWhy do you look like you that?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cJames and Lily are engaged.\u201d\n\n\n Remus\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cBut I thought he was going to wait until\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cImpulsive little git, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sirius says gleefully, ignoring James\u2019s offended squawk.\n\n\n Remus immediately reaches a hand out, and Sirius tosses him the phone. He proceeds to bob around the room as Remus, beaming, congratulates James.\n\n\n After several minutes, they say their goodbyes. Sirius, quivering with joy, cannot bring himself to sit. If there was more than three feet of free space in their flat, he might have been performing several gymnastic moves far beyond his skill set. He meets Remus\u2019s eyes, and they share a grin, happiness for their friends lighting up Remus\u2019s face. \n\n\n \u201cGod,\u201d Remus says, resting his chin in his hand. \u201cI remember when she first told him to stick his head in a toilet.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd look at them now.\u201d Sirius collapses onto the foot of Remus\u2019s bed, having run out of floor to pace. \u201cWe\u2019ve truly seen it all, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n Remus gives him a lop-sided smile, dear and comforting, and the effort it takes for Sirius to still his hand, to stop himself from sliding his fingertips across Remus\u2019s jaw, is exhausting. \u201cAre you still working on the Russian history paper?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s due in an hour, so technically, I shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\n\n Sirius makes a grab for the laptop, but Remus, well-versed in the art of avoiding Sirius\u2019s thievery, holds the laptop just beyond his reach. \u201cYou\u2019ll go mad reading that thing. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t started speaking Russian. If you don\u2019t get full marks, I\u2019ll burn the university to the ground.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to include that.\u201d Remus replies, eyes darting across the screen. Sirius watches as he slowly slides back into work mode, his awareness of the world slipping around him, focus narrowing solely to the words on the screen before him. He looks achingly, stunningly academic like this, sitting cross-legged on his bed, laptop resting on his knees and curls pushed away from his face. His lips part as he reads, lashes lowered over freckled cheeks. Sirius knows he should probably give Remus time alone with his work, but he can\u2019t bring himself to leave just yet. Instead, he leans back against the wall, long legs crossed, and sits in comfortable silence next to Remus. He\u2019s stuck on a memory, his mind replaying it, dissecting it; the memory of James, moments after Lily first agreed to go out with him. He\u2019d been grinning, broadly, foolishly, as Sirius, Peter, and Remus danced and crowed and whooped in circles around their dorm room. It is as clear a memory to him as if it had happened only hours before. \n\n\n He remembers the transformation of Lily\u2019s disdain into begrudging tolerance; from tolerance, to reluctant fondness. He would have bet every ounce of his inheritance against Lily agreeing to go out with James--and yet, here they were now, committing to a life together, and Sirius believed without a doubt that they would find that life, and live it happily, and proudly, and that he would get to see it all. It had been such an impossibility for so long, and yet now, it was their future, real and unquestionable, and unthinkable for it to have happened any other way.\n\n\n Sirius remembers laying here, in this bed, with Remus\u2019s shoulders pressed into his, his hips and his fever-slick skin hot against Sirius\u2019s own. He remembers Remus\u2019s fingers wrapped around his wrist, asking him to stay.\n\n\n He remembers everything.\n\n\n \u201cJust one.. more.. moment. There.\u201d Remus\u2019s head drops into his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s submitted, I just got the confirmation. I never have to type the word bolshevik again.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t jinx yourself.\u201d Sirius advises him.\n\n\n \u201cThank-you for all the help,\u201d Remus says, shooting him a grateful look. \u201cI almost thought I\u2019d never finish.\u201d\n\n\n Almost. Sirius remembers every almost they\u2019d ever had, all the almosts shivering in the air between them.\n\n\n He remembers.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s laptop is still open in his lap. Wordlessly, Sirius reaches for it, closes it, and carefully slides it onto the floor. Remus shoots him a questioning look.\n\n\n \u201cSirius?\u201d\n\n\n His name is a question that Sirius doesn\u2019t know how to answer, but one that he wants to, desperately. Wordlessly, he shifts so that he\u2019s across from Remus, so close that their knees are touching. Remus\u2019s face is carefully neutral, but Sirius hears his breath quicken, can see the quivering of Remus\u2019s pulse against his throat. With the utmost care, he takes Remus\u2019s hands in his, and Remus lets him. Sirius studies the pale freckles gathered at his knuckles, noticing the places where they skip across the fine bones of his hands, abandoning the skin of his palms to dust across his forearms. He turns Remus\u2019s hands over in his, watching the wild flutter of his pulse against the thin skin of his wrist, and wonders what it would be like to kiss him just there; to have the evidence of Remus\u2019s heartbeat beneath his mouth.\n\n\n He lifts Remus\u2019s wrist to his mouth and kisses that place, kisses that flickering pulse.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s eyes flutter shut.\n\n\n Sirius lowers their hands and leans forward, but only just, so that their foreheads are nearly touching, so that they\u2019re breathing the same air. Remus opens his eyes, and the fracture lines in Sirius\u2019s resolve appear at a catastrophic rate.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s eyes are half-lidded and dark, dark, dark. He reaches out and grabs hold of the collar of Sirius\u2019s shirt, maybe to steady himself, maybe to bring Sirius closer, which he does, so that their foreheads press together, so that if Sirius moves even an inch, he could change everything, if he wanted to.\n\n\n And Sirius wants everything.\n\n\n When Sirius kisses him, it\u2019s wild and dizzying and electric. \n\n\n It\u2019s a relief.\n\n\n His hand finds Remus\u2019s hip, steadying the both of them as Remus pulls on the collar of his shirt, pulling him close. Remus\u2019s mouth is warm and wonderful beneath his as he curls his fingers into the denim at Remus\u2019s hip, the other finding its way to Remus\u2019s jaw. They break apart, foreheads pressed together, dazed and breathing hard, and Remus is looking at him with such undisguised want that Sirius can hardly catch his breath.\n\n\n It\u2019s too much, and not enough, and he needs more.\n\n\n Dazed and wanting, he pulls Remus close, and when he presses his mouth to Remus\u2019s, it\u2019s with a hunger he can no longer leash. Remus\u2019s mouth parts for him, hot and waiting, and Sirius gives up any pretense of control. Kissing Remus is like breathing, like remembering how to breathe\u2014and Sirius has been drowning for a very long time. \n\n\n He\u2019d thought he known every one of Remus\u2019s angles, every slope and narrow edge, but his roaming hands discover unfamiliar territory. The sharp slice of hip bone beneath his hand, the curve of spine, arching to meet him. His fingers move from the back of Remus\u2019s neck to the curls of his hair and tug, so that Remus\u2019s neck arches back, leaving room for Sirius to mark a path from his jaw to his collar-bone.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s hand abandons purchase in Sirius\u2019 shirt, instead slipping beneath the fabric to drag fingertips across Sirius\u2019s ribs. Sirius shudders, stilling for a moment and breathing hard into Remus\u2019s shoulder, the feeling of Remus\u2019s fingers on his skin demolishing every coherent thought left in his brain. His heart pounds heavily in his ears as Remus drags his mouth across Sirius\u2019 throat, and Sirius tilts his head back, eyes closed, mouth parted, reverent.\n\n\n \u201cHow long?\u201d Remus gasps against Sirius\u2019s jaw, and the question confuses him, the english language a foreign concept to him with Remus\u2019s hands gliding across his ribs.\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius gasps, his fingers seeking, his mouth hungry.\n\n\n \u201cHow long?\u201d Remus repeats, mouthing the words against Sirius\u2019s throat.\n\n\n This time, words find their meaning. \u201cForever,\u201d Sirius breathes, fingers curling in Remus\u2019s sweater. \u201cForever.\u201d\n\n\n And then Remus yanks upwards on the tail of Sirius\u2019 shirt, pulling it up and over, and Sirius stops thinking about anything at all.\n\n\nJames can scarcely remember being so happy.\n\n\n From behind him, Lily gives his shoulder an affectionate squeeze, and he reaches for her hand. Her ring flashes delicately in the light of the kitchen as he pulls it close, kissing her fingers. He smiles softly against her knuckles, and she squeezes his hand, bestowing a kiss on his head and slipping her hand from his grasp. He watches her pour wine into glasses at the kitchen counter, then turns his head towards the living room, where Remus and Sirius sit on the squashy couch across from Peter, who\u2019s taken up residence in his favourite arm chair. Seeing the three of them, his brothers, his family, only adds to his sense of giddy buoyancy.\n\n\n It\u2019s almost surreal, seeing Remus and Sirius like this. They\u2019re pressed together on the couch, Sirius\u2019s feet in Remus\u2019s lap, which is not entirely unusual; what is unusual, however, is the way that Remus\u2019s head occasionally dips close towards Sirius to rest against his shoulder, or the way that Sirius\u2019s fingers trace lazy patterns down Remus\u2019s forearm, with an ease and affection that is familiar to him. He grins foolishly at Lily as she hands him two wine glasses. She rolls her eyes, shaking her head but unable to hide her own smile as she turns to gather the rest of the glasses. They distribute the wine amongst everyone before squishing together on the tiny love-seat, James sliding his arm around Lily\u2019s waist.\n\n\n \u201cWe\u2019re saving the real drinking for the engagement party, right?\u201d Sirius clarifies.\n\n\n \u201cOf course,\u201d Lily replies. \u201cThis is strictly a celebratory toast.\u201d\n\n\n James clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m about to be painfully embarrassing, but under the circumstances, I don\u2019t see any way around it. Credit where credit is due, and all.\u201d James raises his glass. \u201cYou guys have been there through it all. You\u2019ve seen me through the rejections, the dates, the moving in, and now, an engagement. I\u2019m a lucky man, to have grown up with you all. I\u2019m lucky to know you.\u201d He meets each of their eyes in-turn. He expects one of them to make a joke of it, but they don\u2019t, and he\u2019s grateful for it. Maybe, even proud. \u201cTonight, we\u2019re celebrating not only mine and Lily\u2019s engagement, but Sirius\u2019s acceptance into school for the fall.\u201d Sirius rolls his eyes good-naturedly at this. Sirius may shrug his own accomplishments off, but they all know, of course, that this was no small thing for him--nor was it a small thing for them to express their pride. \u201cAnd also, the fact that you two idiots finally sorted yourselves out.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSo eloquent,\u201d Lily says, an eyebrow raised, and the five of them exchange grins.\n\n\n \u201cTo this next chapter,\u201d He says, and they raise their glasses, mirroring him. \u201cTo our futures. And to us, and this family of ours.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The moment they tumble through the flat door, Sirius whirls on Remus, pressing him into the closet and capturing his mouth in his. Remus grins into their kiss as Sirius makes quick work of their jackets. Kissing Remus is like waking up, every part of Sirius coming alive and aware and wanting. He still feels as though he\u2019s walking around in a daze, almost unable to believe that he has regular access to Remus\u2019s lips, Remus\u2019s skin.\n\n \u201cBeen thinking about this\u2014\u201d Sirius murmurs against the other boy\u2019s lips. \u201c\u2014All evening.\u201d\n\n\n Been thinking about this for years. \n\n\n Remus leans his head backwards, revealing the pale line of his throat, and Sirius takes advantage, working dark marks into the place beneath his jaw.\n\n\n His hands find their way up Remus\u2019s jumper, fingers skipping across his stomach to spread wide across his ribs, pinning him in place. Remus sighs in a way that makes Sirius want to yank the damn jumper over his head, kitchen be damned. Not that the kitchen itself was much of an issue--there was hardly a square foot of space in the entire flat that hadn\u2019t been privy to some very private goings-on between the two of them. It was more that mattresses were far more comfortable than the kitchen counter.\n\n\n Remus appears to be having the same thought. \u201cMy bed,\u201d He pants, fingernails digging into Sirius\u2019s waist beneath his shirt. \u201cIs right there, you know.\u201d He kisses Sirius in earnest, and Sirius allows himself to be led down the hall.\n\n\n They collapse in a tangle atop Remus\u2019s bed. Sirius yanks the other boy\u2019s shirt up, trailing kisses across his chest, down the sharp angle of his hip bone, working at the button of his jeans and yanking down his boxers. Remus breathes his name, then gasps sharply as Sirius lowers his mouth, taking him in. He pins Remus\u2019s hips to the bed with his palms, and Remus swears, burying his fingers in Sirius\u2019s hair, watching him with glassy-eyed astonishment. Sirius loves him like this, dark-eyed and wanting, pulling at his hair, breathing hard and gasping out Sirius\u2019s name like a prayer. Remus\u2019s free hand scrambles for purchase along the head board, the blanket, the back of Sirius\u2019s neck, and he throws back his head as Sirius works him over, digging marks into the flesh of Remus\u2019s hip. Sirius moves with a rhythmic intensity, swallowing, bobbing, moaning around Remus, every noise a demand for Remus to look at him. Remus\u2019s hips jerk under Sirius\u2019s hands, and Sirius can\u2019t help but buck into the mattress beneath him when Remus looks at him, lips parted, cheeks flushed, teetering on the edge. Sirius reaches out to drag his fingernails along Remus\u2019s ribs, and the other boy bucks hard, unable to stop the ragged gasp that falls from his mouth. When Remus comes, it\u2019s with his hand curled possessively around the back of Sirius\u2019s neck, shuddering, and Sirius moves with him through it, coaxing out every last gasp of pleasure.\n\n\n \u201cGet up--Get up here.\u201d Remus breathes, pulling Sirius up to kiss him, open-mouthed and desperate. \u201cSit up.\u201d Remus tells him, and Sirius does, straddling Remus, his thighs slung over the other boy\u2019s hips, hovering over Remus\u2019s lap. He watches in awe as Remus pulls at Sirius\u2018s shirt, yanking it over his head, nails dragging over Sirius\u2019s ribs. Without pause, Remus kisses him again, fiercely, fingers working at the zipper of Sirius\u2019s jeans and pulling them down. Remus drags his teeth across Sirius\u2019s jaw, his throat, his collarbone, and Sirius\u2019s head falls back, fingers winding encouragingly through Remus\u2019s hair. Remus moves with agonizing slowness, trailing wet, open-mouthed kisses down Sirius\u2019s chest, palming Sirius through his boxers--and then Sirius is hissing as Remus\u2019s mouth, hot and wet, finds its target, and Sirius reaches out to the wall to steady himself. He cannot take his eyes off Remus, can\u2019t help the bucking of his hips as he slowly fucks Remus\u2019s mouth, the feel of Remus\u2019s hands on the small of his back, his hips, his thighs, the press of the other boy\u2019s fingers as they grip his skin driving him wholly out of his mind. \n\n\n Remus makes a low, soft noise, and looks up at him, eyes nearly black, a ring of green and gold around blown-out pupils, and Sirius is sent tumbling over the edge, his fingers buried in Remus\u2019s hair. When he\u2019s done, Remus grins up at him, wicked, and plants kisses across his stomach while Sirius leans heavily into the wall, breathing hard.\n\n\n He pulls Sirius down onto the bed with him, laughing breathlessly, joyful and vibrant, and Sirius finds he can\u2019t help himself. He buries his face in the crook of Remus\u2019s neck, leaving soft, tender kisses there, curling a hand around his hip, pulling him in close. Remus strokes the back of his neck, feather-light touches that could send Sirius to sleep if he does this long enough. For a long time, they stay like this, curled into one another, breathing soft. Sirius is hovering on the nearest edge of sleep when Remus taps his fingers against the nape of Sirius\u2019s neck in a gentle bid for his attention. Sirius tilts his head, using his elbows to prop himself up.\n\n\n Remus\u2019s expression is open, and thoughtful, and he\u2019s watching him with that quiet contentment that Sirius is still getting used to being the source of. Remus\u2019s lips part, but the words falter on his lips, and Sirius is suddenly reminded of a late night not-so-long ago, when they\u2019d sat on their floor in front of a coffee table, everything they couldn\u2019t say hanging between them. He chases away the memory by pressing a soft kiss to the other boy\u2019s lips.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, you know.\u201d Sirius murmurs. Remus laughs, that breathless, tinkling laugh. These days, he always seems ever-so-slightly surprised, treating every kiss as a shocking delight, an unexpected gift.\n\n\n \u201cThat's convenient,\u201d Remus says, and if Sirius could live forever in this moment, he would. \u201cConsidering\u00a0I'm in love with you too.\u201d\n\n\nSirius is going to memorize every single freckle, every fleck of gold in those impossible, wicked eyes. He grins.\n\n\n\"Lucky me.\"\n"
