    "text": "He hurts.\nIt feels like every inch of his body is crying out in protest, like every molecule that creates his being is in pure agony and, for a second, he thinks he must be dying. The moment passes as he shifts slightly, feeling the ground move around him; he hurts, but he has worked through worse. Not that he can remember what exactly \u2018worse\u2019 was or when it happened, he merely flexes his fingers experimentally; the pain is horrible but his body isn\u2019t ready to give up just yet so he must have dealt with worse.\nBlinking his eyes open, he squints against the darkness of the night. And by opening his eyes he must have brought himself back to the world around him because the noise is suddenly deafening. There is rapid and concentrated gunfire and screams echoing nearby and he winces, wanting to cover his ears but not wanting to move.\n\u201cChuuya-san! Chuuya-san!\u201d One of the screams solidify into a name and he frowns thoughtfully at it, feeling like there is something he should know about that particular name but not sure what it is. A head appears above him, eyes wide in shock as a young man stares at him with clear concern. \u201cChuuya-san, are you alright?\u201d\nA bandage is covering the man\u2019s nose and he wonders if it\u2019s covering a recent injury. Then, he wonders if he needs bandages, which wouldn\u2019t be surprising given how much everything hurts. Slowly, he pushes himself upright and bites back a groan of protest.\nThe man is still talking, he realizes. Repeating that name and rambling about casualty numbers and enemy location and backup and other things that make absolutely no sense.\n\u201cChuuya-san, we need to-\u201d\nHe holds up a hand in a silent request for quiet that gets heeded instantly, the man staring down at him expectantly, as if waiting for orders. He doesn\u2019t know why, but he knows this man will hear him out, will listen to his questions and answer accordingly, so he asks, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nConfusion flashes across the young man\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m Tachihara, sir. But you\u2019ve-\u201d\nNow that the first question has left his lips, he finds himself needing to ask more. His head is spinning, everything hurts, he knows he has felt worse, thinks he has been in worse situations before, but he can\u2019t remember them.\nHe can\u2019t remember anything.\nTrying not to panic, he cuts across the man\u2019s\u2014Tachihara\u2019s\u2014rambling again. \u201cWhy do you keep calling me sir?\u201d\nTachihara\u2019s eyebrows draw down at that question and there\u2019s a brief flicker of concern in the man\u2019s gaze before it vanishes. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of this operation, and an executive, it\u2019s only right for me to address you with respect, Chuuya-san.\u201d\n\u201cChuuya,\u201d he repeats the name carefully, finding its weight familiar on his tongue but not as familiar as he gets the sense that it should be. The next question is one he doesn\u2019t want to ask\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to know just how bad everything is, doesn\u2019t want Tachihara to panic (because he has a feeling Tachihara will panic), but he needs to know. \u201cIs that my name?\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t a reply straight away. Tachihara stares down at him, face pale, before glancing away and snapping a few orders. People out of sight respond and footsteps sound around him, indicating others are moving away.\nScreams are still echoing, gunfire is still ringing through the night sky, he has no idea how he got here, has no idea what is going on.\nTachihara reaches down, offering a hand that he takes gratefully, letting the young man help him to his feet. Once standing, he realizes he\u2019s in a crater of some kind, in the middle of a road, and he climbs out of it (ignoring the way his body protests with each movement). Now on level ground with Tachihara, he can make out more about their surroundings, can see people fighting just within eyesight, can hear more commands being shouted.\n\u201cChuuya-san\u2026do you remember me?\u201d Tachihara asks, voice soft.\nThere is that name again, but Tachihara hasn\u2019t answered his last question.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember anything that happened before I opened my eyes down there,\u201d he replies, \u201cis that my name? Chuuya?\u201d\nTachihara nods slowly, \u201cNakahara Chuuya, that\u2019s you. You\u2019re an executive in the Port Mafia.\u201d\nLooking around them again, he takes in the chaos of the night, takes in the bodies littered on the street, the stench of death and bloodshed that is somehow achingly familiar and shockingly foreign all at once. Deep down in his gut, he knows that some of the corpses are his doing, that he must have killed more than a handful to be an executive in this \u2018Port Mafia\u2019, to be in charge of such an operation.\nMeeting Tachihara\u2019s gaze, he asks, \u201cIs there someone who can take command from here? I won\u2019t be much help right now considering that I don\u2019t even remember what the Port Mafia is.\u201d\n\u201cThe reinforcements will be here soon with Hirotsu, he can take charge. Do you want to\u2026?\u201d Tachihara trails off, looking a little lost though certainly nowhere near as lost as he feels.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take cover,\u201d he offers, waving to the shipping crates behind himself. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\nTachihara\u2019s hesitation is considerable, but the young man eventually nods. \u201cWhen the reinforcements arrive, I\u2019ll have them send a squad over to guard the area and make sure no one gets too close. I think\u2026it would be best if I didn\u2019t tell anyone what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nHe waves Tachihara off with a murmur of agreement, waiting for the other man to rush toward the fighting before turning and making his way to the crates. Stepping around them, he\u2019s surprised to be greeted with the sea and he squints across its surface. Just where the hell is he?\nTaking a seat at the base of one of the crates, he digs into his pant pocket and pulls out a phone. Thankfully, it opens with his fingerprint since he has no idea what his password might have been. Not seeing a use for the tattered gloves he had been wearing he tosses them over his shoulder and occupies himself with going through the latest messages, trying to piece together what his life has been, who he actually is. There are messages from someone named Kouyou and based on the content of them he assumes they\u2019re relatively close. A text from an Akutagawa makes him quirk his eyebrow with how short and to-the-point it is but he moves on.\nHis finger hovers over a message conversation with someone listed in his phone as \u2018bandage-waster\u2019. There is something about it, something that echoes in the back recesses of his mind (perhaps where all his memories are locked away) that compels him to open the conversation and flick through it. It\u2019s mostly an exchange of insults, on both sides, but the \u2018bandage-waster\u2019 makes several references to knowing him better than anyone else alive and, before he can stop himself, he\u2019s clicking the call button.\nBringing the phone to his ear, he waits, heart in his throat.\nThe call is answered after three rings.\n\u201cNow this is a surprise!\u201d The voice that filters through the line is overly upbeat and cheery, giving the impression that it\u2019s somewhat of an act. \u201cNever in my wildest dreams did I think Chuuya would actually call me in the middle of a top-secret mafia mission.\u201d\nChuuya. That name again. His name? The fact that it has now been used to address him by more than one person makes him feel more comfortable with the idea of it belonging to him.\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNice try, chibi, there\u2019s no way you would ever forget me. I am your partner after all.\u201d\nPartner? That didn\u2019t sound quite right. If he had a partner why wasn\u2019t that partner here as backup?\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember you,\u201d he replies, voice soft as if wanting to prevent eavesdroppers, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d\nThere is a long pause and when the person on the other end of the line speaks the mocking lilt in their voice is gone. \u201cChuuya, where are you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d looking around, he says, \u201cby the water, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s some kind of shipping port. There\u2019s a lot of fighting; evidently, I was leading an operation but I had them switch command since I don\u2019t even know what the Port Mafia is.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, I\u2019m coming to you.\u201d\nThe line cuts before he can protest and he pulls his phone back to stare at the screen. There isn\u2019t a contact picture of \u2018bandage-waster\u2019 and he doubts there is any more information on his phone about who it is. He doesn\u2019t know anything about the person claiming they\u2019ll come to find him, but he can\u2019t shake the feeling of security that washed over him at the other\u2019s statement.\nHe believes that they are on their way, and that\u2019s enough to lessen just a little bit of the panic creeping into his chest over how confusing everything has felt since he opened his eyes in that crater.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not difficult to deduce where Chuuya is. There aren\u2019t a lot of places in Yokohama where the Port Mafia could launch a full-scale attack without being concerned about authorities or the agency interfering. From there, the list narrows even further based on Chuuya saying he was near water.\nAnd, as he gets closer, Dazai can hear the sounds of combat stark in the otherwise quiet night.\nHis gaze narrows in the direction of the fighting. There is too much activity, the group encroaching on mafia territory is putting up too much resistance: that alone would be concerning in its own right even if he didn\u2019t have the strange call from Chuuya playing on repeat in his head.\nWhen he answered the phone, Dazai had known something was going on. After all, getting a phone call from the hat rack was more than unusual, it was without precedent. But the way Chuuya had sounded, the fact that Chuuya didn\u2019t even protest being called partners (as he vehemently did at any other time, insisting on being referred to as an ex-partner) was what tipped him off to something being wrong, even before Chuuya said he didn\u2019t remember anything.\nIt is absurd to imagine, Chuuya without any memories at all, and part of Dazai is fervently hoping the other man is baiting him for some reason even if he knows that isn\u2019t the case.\nTurning away from the fighting, Dazai studies the rest of the port, considering possible hiding places for the short stack and dismissing them at the speed of light before his gaze falls on a collection of shipping crates.\nMaking his way over to it, Dazai pauses just outside of the shadows of the crates and softly calls, \u201cChuuya?\u201d\nSomething shifts to his right and Dazai can barely make out someone struggling to their feet, using the crates to steady themselves as they say, \u201cWho is there?\u201d\n\u201cDazai,\u201d he replies, even though he knows the answer is probably meaningless if Chuuya really has lost all his memories. \u201cI think you have me listed in your phone as bandage-waster, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my partner?\u201d the confusion in Chuuya\u2019s voice as he asks this is like a blow to Dazai\u2019s gut, but he doesn\u2019t let it show on his face. \u201cIf you\u2019re my partner why weren\u2019t you here?\u201d\nLetting out a sigh, Dazai admits, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Do you have backup coming?\u201d\n\u201cTachihara,\u201d Chuuya says the name like it\u2019s foreign to him, \u201csaid reinforcements were on the way and that he would send a squad to guard this area when they came. Someone named\u2026Hirotsu is with them, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mind if I come closer?\u201d The last thing he needs is to startle Chuuya into losing control of his ability, and without any memories about its possible existence, it\u2019s more than likely that Chuuya\u2019s grip over Corruption is weaker now than it ever has been.\nChuuya shifts, taking a step forward so he is no longer hidden by the shadows of the crates. He looks like shit. A bruise is coloring the side of his face and scratches are visible on every bare surface of his skin. Both his signature hat and jacket are gone, his remaining clothes ripped in various areas, speaking to an ugly fight. Anyone who could do this much damage to Chuuya is not to be taken lightly, and the possibility of them still being nearby makes Dazai itch to get them both out of here and to somewhere safer.\nBlue eyes are carefully scanning Dazai, a mixture of wariness and fatigue in their depths. It\u2019s not the first time Dazai has stood under Chuuya\u2019s scrutiny but this is worlds apart from any other time they\u2019ve stared each other down. Chuuya isn\u2019t looking at him like a traitor, like his ex-partner who walked away from the Port Mafia, like someone he resents having to work with, like someone he has any sort of pull toward or history with or any of the dozens of other ways Chuuya has studied him in the past. Chuuya is looking at him like he\u2019s a stranger and Dazai hates how much it bothers him.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d It probably isn\u2019t fair of him to be asking this.\nEven though Chuuya is doing his best to avoid showing any weakness (and it\u2019s a little bit of a relief to see how much Chuuya is still acting like himself even in these circumstances), Dazai doesn\u2019t lie when he talks about knowing Chuuya better than anyone else. He can see the sliver of doubt not entirely masked by Chuuya\u2019s half-formed scowl, can see the fear Chuuya must be feeling, evidenced by the tension in Chuuya\u2019s frame.\nIt would probably be easier if Dazai made a decision for them both, but that\u2019s wandering into dangerous territory. If, and Dazai hates to entertain the idea, but if Chuuya\u2019s memories never come back, it doesn\u2019t do anyone any good if Chuuya is only familiar with relying on others to make his decisions. And the Chuuya he knows would be furious at the breach in his autonomy.\nSo, Dazai waits, keeping his body relaxed so Chuuya doesn\u2019t feel rushed to his choice despite how the fighting edges closer to their location.\nChuuya\u2019s gaze flicks over Dazai\u2019s shoulders, in the direction of the fighting, and he stares for several long minutes. Finally, he shakes his head and meets Dazai\u2019s gaze again. \u201cI don\u2019t remember who you are or how we know each other, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I trust you, with my life.\u201d\nDazai knows that, has seen evidence of it over and over again in the years they have known each other. Chuuya has never said it out loud before, not to him, and he finds his words catching in his throat at the fact that, without any memories at all, Chuuya can say such a thing.\nLuckily for him, Chuuya isn\u2019t finished speaking, \u201cDo you have a way to contact them and let them know I\u2019m safe? I don\u2019t want them thinking I got kidnapped or something.\u201d\n\u201cI can call Hirotsu and let him know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m presuming you have someplace safe where I can lie low?\u201d\n\u201cRelatively.\u201d\nChuuya takes another step, swaying on his feet before finding his balance. Dazai doesn\u2019t bother to reach for him, strongly suspecting that any sudden movements won\u2019t be received well. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of here\u2026Dazai.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDazai leads him away from the port, away from the fighting, and through the streets of a city that he doesn\u2019t remember the name to.\nThey walk in silence. He tries not to make it clear how much pain he is in, tries not to slow them down, but Dazai seems to know just how quickly they can walk before it is too much for him, pausing randomly without explanation for just long enough for him to catch his breath and re-attune to the pain before moving on.\nThat, more than anything Dazai could have said, makes it obvious that there is a history between them that can\u2019t be summed up with a few sentences or a simple description. Dazai is in tune with his body, with what he can do and when he is pushing too hard, and Dazai accommodates without a word and without making a scene. It is enough to make him feel almost\u2026comfortable, for the first time since realizing his memories were gone.\nGlancing at the man beside him, he takes in Dazai\u2019s appearance. When the taller man had first arrived, his mind had been too scattered to concentrate on anything more than the sharpness in brown eyes and the way something akin to concern was glittering in their depths.\nNow, his gaze takes in everything from the brown hair that he suspects to be soft to the touch to the long tan trench coat that Dazai\u2019s hands are stuffed inside to the bandages that peek above the collar of Dazai\u2019s shirt. His eyes narrow at the gauze, wondering if the wrappings are the origin of the name Dazai is saved under in his phone and if that means there are more bandages along Dazai\u2019s body.\nWhy are they there?\nWas that a question he used to know the answer to?\nHe bites back a scowl. There is so much he doesn\u2019t know, so much he feels like he had known and had somehow lost in an instant. He has the aching suspicion that his survival in this city, in this Port Mafia, is reliant on that information, on knowing where he stands with the people around him and how to interact with him.\nThis feeling of helplessness tastes bitter on his tongue, is more painful than any physical sensation tearing through his body.\nWhat if his memories never come back?\nThe thought makes him stumble, his body over-correcting forward and tipping him off-balance too far for him to recover from, threatening a tumble face-first onto the pavement. A surge of warmth bursts under his skin and suddenly he is weightless, tilting back to a proper standing position before dropping a scant inch to stand on his feet again.\nEyes wide, he looks at Dazai, who doesn\u2019t seem even mildly surprised at what just happened. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cYour ability.\u201d\n\u201cAbility?\u201d\nDazai nods. \u201cIt\u2019s a supernatural power that some people are born with. Your ability is gravity manipulation.\u201d\nSomething in Dazai\u2019s tone gives him the impression that there is more to the story, but he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s something he even wants to hear about right now, not when he\u2019s slowly feeling overwhelmed by everything happening. Brushing the moment aside, for now, he asks, \u201cDo you have an ability?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my ability nullifies other abilities.\u201d\nHe frowns. Unlike how his own ability just saved him from eating pavement, Dazai\u2019s doesn\u2019t sound like it would be useful in too many contexts. \u201cIs that particularly helpful?\u201d\n\u201cIt can be, depending on the circumstance,\u201d Dazai replies, voice airy. Before he can ask a follow-up question, Dazai turns away from the sidewalk, pulling a set of keys from his pocket. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\nA key is pushed into the lock and the door pushed open. Dazai ushers him inside, closing and locking the door behind them before flicking on a light. Instinctively, he toes off his shoes, leaving them by the entrance as he stares into the flat that he assumes Dazai lives in.\nHe assumes Dazai lives here and that it isn\u2019t just a generic safe house, but there wasn\u2019t much to back up that belief. The place looks more like a rental than anywhere someone had set down roots and, as Dazai moves further inside, flicking on lights, he briefly wonders how many people Dazai even lets into this space, much less how much time Dazai spends here.\nAbove it all, he is struck with the sensation that the apartment is impersonal because its owner doesn\u2019t have plans to be around for long and the feeling makes him stare at Dazai anew, wondering just what the other man is like when there isn\u2019t the pressing issue of someone having amnesia to deal with. For some reason, he gets the sense that the answer would make him feel sad, and he doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of that.\n\u201cI assume you want a shower,\u201d Dazai was saying as if oblivious to the way he is being studied, which feels doubtful considering how observant Dazai has already proved to be.\n\u201cI guess a shower would be nice,\u201d he replies, venturing further inside.\nDazai nods and motions him to follow through the main room, past the small kitchen, and into the bathroom. Making quick work of getting the water running, Dazai explains where a few helpful items can be found while pulling out towels. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a fresh set of clothes for you just outside the door. Take your time.\u201d\nBefore the taller man can leave, he reaches out, his fingers closing around thin wrists. Briefly distracted, he looks down to take note of the fact that more bandages rest under his grip, peeking from underneath the sleeve of the trench coat Dazai has yet to take off.\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Dazai prompts, bringing him back to the matter at hand.\n\u201cWhy are you doing this for me?\u201d he asks, looking up to meet Dazai\u2019s gaze.\nDazai\u2019s head tilts slightly, \u201cIsn\u2019t it natural to help someone you know when they need help?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s natural for you. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t natural for me to ask you for help because you sounded surprised over the phone. You dropped whatever you were doing to come find me, but I could have been pretending, or luring you into a trip, or-\u201d\n\u201cChuuya,\u201d Dazai cuts him off, voice not unkind as a flicker of amusement shows in brown eyes, \u201ctrust me when I say that I know you well enough to have known if you were lying.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you know me if I don\u2019t even know myself?\u201d he mutters.\nDazai gives a hum and, somehow, he knows that whatever is going to come out of the taller man\u2019s mouth next is going to be a deflection. \u201cEasy! I\u2019ve always known more than you anyway, it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re able to get anything done on your own.\u201d\nRolling his eyes, he lets go of Dazai. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to avoid this conversation forever. I want to know who you are to me, sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m your partner.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\nSomething flashes across Dazai\u2019s expression, there and gone, too complex for him to pick apart before it vanishes with a shrug of Dazai\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSuit yourself. I\u2019ve got to go let Hirotsu know you\u2019re safe before the mafia levels the city to find you. Don\u2019t drown in the bathtub!\u201d\nDazai is gone before he can even think of two words to string together in response. Glaring at the closed door that the other man vanished through, he lets out a huff of exasperation. There is something familiar about the resigned annoyance seeping through his body at Dazai\u2019s antics, but even if the way Dazai seems determined to avoid his questions is a bit irritating, it\u2019s also a relief not to be treated like he\u2019s going to break at any second.\nTurning his back on the door, he comes to a halt in front of the mirror, eyes widening as he stares at a stranger.\nSlowly, he reaches a hand up, watching as the man in the mirror does the same, to tug on red locks. He feels the tug in his scalp and lets go, running fingers through his hair to pull it away from his face, baring bright blue eyes.\nIn the mayhem of his night, he hadn\u2019t even stopped to consider the fact that he had no idea what he looked like. Through the scratches and bruises, he looks\u2026younger than he would have anticipated based on what Tachihara had said. He can\u2019t be any older than twenty-five and yet he is an executive in a mafia? In charge of a massive operation just tonight and likely countless over the last year? That must speak to his usefulness to the organization and he wonders if having to step back from commanding the operation will reflect poorly on him from now on. He can\u2019t decide if that would bother him even if he suspects that it should.\nHis clothes are beyond repair. Muddied and bloodied and torn in various places, but underneath the dirt, he can tell that they\u2019re of rather high quality. Was he paid in the Port Mafia? He must be, to afford clothing like this. Reaching up, he taps at the choker around his neck, frowning thoughtfully, it is a bit of an odd fashion choice, he wonders if it was something he wore often.\nThis was what Nakahara Chuuya looked like.\nHe wonders how long it will take for that name to resonate with him, if it ever would again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the boss would prefer it if Chuuya was under mafia protection,\u201d Hirotsu\u2019s voice filters through the phone, sounding every bit as exhausted as Dazai feels.\nLetting out a snort of derision, Dazai replies, \u201cChuuya will be more than safe with me and he was the one who made the decision to come with me. I won\u2019t be handing him over to the mafia while he\u2019s in this state.\u201d\nThere is a slight pause. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\nPart of Dazai wants to lie, to downplay how complete Chuuya\u2019s amnesia is for the sake of putting the mafia at ease long enough for him to come up with a solid plan. He only entertains the idea for a moment before recognizing the truth is the best option, and the best way to keep Chuuya out of Mori\u2019s grasp until he can fend for himself against the mafia boss again. Dazai knows what Mori will do, knows Mori might take this as an opportunity to \u2018perfect\u2019 Chuuya as a subordinate, reshape him into someone even more loyal and devoted than Chuuya already is.\nDazai will be damned if he lets that happen.\n\u201cHe has retrograde amnesia,\u201d Dazai says, \u201che doesn\u2019t remember anything that happened before he spoke to Tachihara. He doesn\u2019t remember his name, his job, he didn\u2019t even know about his own ability, which means he also doesn\u2019t know how to control it properly. Everyone is safer if he stays with me in case he accidentally triggers Corruption.\u201d\nHirotsu takes in a sharp breath, \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll recover?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll take him to the agency\u2019s doctor to see what she says. Is there any information on how this happened?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the reports I\u2019ve heard so far, he did take a hard fall and was unconscious in the resulting crater for a few minutes.\u201d\n\u201cChuuya takes hard falls all the time,\u201d Dazai says, dismissively, \u201cwhat are the chances of it being an ability user?\u201d\n\u201cSo far, I haven\u2019t received any information that indicates there was another ability user present but we\u2019re still handling clean up. I\u2019ll see if I can find any evidence to the contrary and keep you informed.\u201d The line cuts and Dazai is left to sigh into the receiver before shoving his phone back in his pocket.\nThat will buy him a week, at most, before the mafia members start getting antsy. It might not even buy him that long when it comes to Kouyou, but she is someone Dazai can handle. The most important factor is how long he has before Mori decides to take his chances on Chuuya losing control of Corruption.\nDazai can\u2019t shake the feeling that this isn\u2019t going to be a problem with an easy solution.\nThe door to the bathroom opens and Chuuya steps out into the hall, eyes lighting on Dazai immediately. Since Dazai doesn\u2019t own any clothes meant for short stacks, Chuuya looks comically underdressed compared to his normal attire. A plain shirt goes almost to his knees, almost covering the gym shorts underneath (and Dazai can\u2019t even remember why he owns either article of clothing but he\u2019s more than pleased with the results as he takes in Chuuya\u2019s appearance).\n\u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d Chuuya asks, tearing Dazai away from his survey of the shorter man to frown thoughtfully.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nChuuya mirrors his frown, \u201cIsn\u2019t this your place?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you have any food?\u201d Chuuya sounds bewildered, and it\u2019s just one more example of the fact that Chuuya doesn\u2019t know him at all, doesn\u2019t remember anything about Dazai (because if he did remember, he wouldn\u2019t be even mildly surprised that Dazai\u2019s apartment is lacking in basic necessities).\nWith a shrug, Dazai turns away, steps into his kitchen, and opens a drawer filled with take-out menus. \u201cI\u2019ll order take-out. How hungry are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Chuuya pauses, scrutinizing Dazai in a way that means he\u2019s debating if he wants to hear whatever response Dazai will give to his next comment. After a few seconds, he says, \u201cI suppose you know what kind of food I like? I don\u2019t.\u201d\nDazai opens his mouth to say \u201cof course, I know\u201d and hesitates, frown returning. He knows what foods Chuuya hates because that has always been of much more interest to him for the sake of pissing the shorter man off. When they were partners in the Port Mafia, the few times they ate together were in the middle of jobs, which meant Chuuya ate whatever was available. And while, over the recent weeks, they have been getting to relearn each other, to stumble haphazardly into something bearing a mocking resemblance to the beginnings of a relationship, they haven\u2019t exactly been spending the majority of their time at the dinner table.\nFinally, he replies, \u201cI can avoid the foods that I know you don\u2019t like, someone else would have to reintroduce you to your favorites.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I get the sense that our relationship is much more antagonistic than you\u2019ve been treating me?\u201d\nInternally, Dazai answers the question immediately, it doesn\u2019t take a second of thought. It\u2019s because, contrary to what Dazai says whenever asked, Chuuya isn\u2019t an idiot. He\u2019s perceptive, able to read people extremely well and, apparently, that skill didn\u2019t get lost with his memories.\nOut loud, Dazai responds, \u201cEarlier you said you trusted me with your life, why would our relationship be antagonistic?\u201d\n\u201cIt probably has something to do with the fact that you like withholding information and lording it over people and prefer to be evasive instead of having an actual conversation.\u201d\nDazai blinks.\nChuuya quirks an eyebrow, as if daring Dazai to claim his statement is wrong. Everything about him, from his facial expression to the set of his body, makes it clear that Chuuya is completely confident in his observation in a way that he hasn\u2019t been since Dazai found him at the ports. It\u2019s a good lesson, Dazai supposes: Chuuya may be amnesic, but he isn\u2019t that much less Chuuya than he ever has been.\nThat bodes well. Even if his memories never come back he should be able to handle himself just fine.\nNot bothering to hide his pleased smile over the discovery\u2014aware that Chuuya will draw the wrong conclusion from his expression and get irritated with him\u2014Dazai merely shrugs, and picks out a take-out menu, scanning the options as he dials the listed number. \u201cWhatever Chuuya believes is fine with me.\u201d\nIf Chuuya has a response, Dazai doesn\u2019t pay it any attention as the worker on the other end of the phone answers and starts taking his order. When he\u2019s finished, and the menu is stored back in its place, Dazai finds that Chuuya has migrated to stand in front of the half-empty bookcase and bites back a smirk. Unless Chuuya\u2019s tastes have changed with his memory loss, there isn\u2019t a single novel on his shelves that Chuuya will enjoy, but he decides to let Chuuya figure that out for himself as he heads for the door.\n\u201cDo me a favor and don\u2019t vanish before I come back, Chuuya,\u201d Dazai calls over his shoulder.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t take forever,\u201d Chuuya calls after him.\nWith a huff of laughter, Dazai steps back out into the night.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBrushing his fingers over the nearly perfect spines of the books on Dazai\u2019s bookshelf, he reads the titles with vague interest. There is plenty of open space on Dazai\u2019s bookshelf, as if Dazai had planned to fill it all with novels and got distracted halfway, moving onto another endeavor. Because there is no sign of wear on the books, he doubts they will provide as much insight about the strange man as he had originally hoped, but he keeps skimming titles.\nAt least he remembers how to read.\nDoes that apply to everything he once knew how to do? If he had known how to fly a plane (and why he would know that he can\u2019t fathom but he\u2019s heard a lot of weird things today) did he still know how to fly a plane? Would he even know he knew how to fly a plane until he was thrust into a situation where it was necessary?\nPerhaps he should ask Dazai about his skill set as soon as possible. Knowing what he can and can\u2019t do will be important, in fact, it\u2019s a basic tenant of survival. He can\u2019t afford to overextend himself, but he also doesn\u2019t want to be a burden when he has the ability to hold his own weight.\nHe must be able to fight. Other than the obvious fact that he had lost his memories in the middle of a fight, he had been wearing nearly a dozen daggers, which was quite the surprise to find as he got undressed to take his shower. Their weight had been comfortable in his hands, it had been second-nature to find the buckles for the sheaths; his body\u2019s familiarity with the blades must mean that he can fight.\nAnd not just fight, but he must have had to be fairly decent in a fight to become a mafia executive in the first place.\nHis ability is another matter altogether. The quick spurt of warmth he had felt when it activated subconsciously was at once comforting and horrifying. Did it have limits? Would he wake up in the middle of the night to find himself floating in mid-air? Could he mean to take a normal step and sink his foot through the floor panels?\nLips turned down in a frown, he wonders if he\u2019ll need training for his ability or if he just remembers how to use it.\nWhile he has no real idea what his life was like before this happened, he knows it had to be easier. Any life is easier than not knowing anything about yourself.\nHis fingers brush against a spine that is worn and he pauses, blinking himself out of his own thoughts so that the bookshelf comes back into focus. The softer sensation of a binding regularly opened is a first so far and, curious about the one book out of the dozens that Dazai actually reads, he pulls it off the shelf. It\u2019s thinner than most of the other books, the cover red with white markings. Meandering away from the shelf, he settles on the couch and opens the front cover.\nThe word \u2018suicide\u2019 jumps up at him, and his eyebrows draw down.\nPerhaps it was some sort of fictional novel?\nThat theory is quickly thrown out the window as he begins flicking through the pages of the short book, reading increasingly complex ways for one to kill themselves. And he could have tried to dismiss it as a joke book, something Dazai used for the sole purpose of scaring the unsuspected snooper if it weren\u2019t for the fact that there is too much evidence of Dazai actually taking the words of the book to heart.\nPages are wrinkled in the corners, as if Dazai had dog-eared them for reference and tried to flatten them at a later date. Notes are scratched in the margins in pencil, theorizing ways to improve the methods depicted or writing\u2026\n\u201cWhat the fuck, Dazai,\u201d he mutters under his breath as he considers the damned reviews.\nNext to a self-drawn diagram of an oil drum and a person settled inside, legs and head up sticking out above the rim, is a note that he somehow knows is Dazai\u2019s handwriting: Too painful, didn\u2019t last long before asking Atsushi-kun for help. Turns out it was a torture method, not suicide.\nThe section on ways to drown oneself is heavily edited, detailing at least twelve different failed attempts with varying techniques, all with their own notes about what made them unsuccessful, as if Dazai was trying to perfect his drowning method before actually dying.\nAt the very least, the chapter detailing more violent deaths like a gun to the skull or jumping in front of a car is less annotated, as if Dazai skipped it altogether.\nBut still, how often did Dazai read this book? How seriously did Dazai take these words?\nWas Dazai even coming back with food or would he have to go out to find Dazai only to find a bandaged body dangling from a light-post halfway between here and whatever restaurant Dazai went to?\nJust the thought makes his chest heart, his heart seemingly twisting in knots at the mental picture, and he wants to get up and chase after Dazai, supervise the apparent idiot, but he doesn\u2019t know his way around this city, doesn\u2019t even know what city it is.\nHow the fuck is he supposed to trust someone who might not even be here tomorrow? And why does the thought of waking up to the news of Dazai\u2019s death bother him so much when he didn\u2019t even know who the man was just an hour ago, when he doesn\u2019t even remember who they are to each other outside of Dazai\u2019s vague response of \u2018partners\u2019?\nThe front door opens and he feels his breath catch in his throat, freezing in his seat as he waits to hear who it is.\n\u201cChuuya didn\u2019t vanish, did he?\u201d Dazai\u2019s voice floats in from the entryway, accompanied with the sound of socked feet padding on the floor.\nHe\u2019s on his feet before he even realizes he has moved, whirling to face the small hall that opens to the main room and hurling the book at Dazai\u2019s head the moment it comes into view. His aim is surprisingly good, the book would have hit Dazai right in the forehead if Dazai didn\u2019t immediately duck out of the way with the speed of someone with far too much practice.\nA single eyebrow raises in his direction, Dazai\u2019s eyes narrowing as they scan his face (probably wondering if he remembered something). \u201cDid I do something while I was gone? It\u2019s rare for me not to know how I upset you.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t reply, jaw tight as he glares at Dazai. The truth\u2014that he had panicked at the thought of one of Dazai\u2019s apparently numerous suicide attempts working\u2014sounds childish even in his head. There must be something in his face that Dazai can read because the other man calmly walks further into the room, drops the food on the counter, and walks back to pick up the book on the ground.\nEven with only Dazai\u2019s profile facing him, he can see understanding flicker across Dazai\u2019s face before Dazai turns back to him, expression carefully neutral. \u201cI believe you mentioned something about being starving. The food will get cold if you stand there glaring at me all night.\u201d\n\u201cTell me it\u2019s a joke,\u201d he says, ignoring Dazai\u2019s comment about the food.\n\u201cWould you believe me if I did?\u201d Dazai asks, voice light as if they aren\u2019t talking about the fact that he just found a fucking book filled with suicidal ideations on Dazai\u2019s shelf.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about you, I might believe it.\u201d\nDazai hums thoughtfully, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. You know plenty about me, you just don\u2019t remember it all. You must remember some things though, even if you don\u2019t understand the details, because you already know that I would be lying if I said it is a joke.\u201d\nHe thinks he\u2019s going to be sick.\n\u201cWould you feel better if I swore to put a hold on my pursuit for death until either your memories return or you\u2019re settled somewhere?\u201d Dazai asks.\n\u201cHow would I know you weren\u2019t just bluffing to make me less jumpy?\u201d\nThat pulls a dry laugh from Dazai, \u201cJumpy isn\u2019t a word I\u2019d use to describe you, not even now. Do you want me to make the promise or not? It won\u2019t bother me if you say no.\u201d\nBreaking eye contact, he glances to the side, at the bookshelf that had seemed so innocuous when he went to explore it. It would make him feel better if Dazai made the mentioned promise, would make the current paranoia at suddenly losing the one person he has felt immediately comfortable around vanish, would take the assumption of safety he found in Dazai\u2019s presence and make it into somewhat of a reality. But admitting that makes his mouth go dry, as if such honesty is foreign (and he wonders if it\u2019s being honest with his emotions or being honest with his emotions to Dazai that makes him feel so uncomfortable).\nHe lost his memories. No one seems to know why or how or if he\u2019ll get them back.\nWho would really judge him for this moment of weakness after the day he has had?\nStill refusing to look at Dazai, he nods. \u201cPromise me, then.\u201d\n\u201cI promise. If I die before you get your memories back or you are settled down somewhere it will be because someone killed me, probably you, at this rate. Now, are you going to eat?\u201d\nIt\u2019s infuriating that Dazai thinks they can just gloss over this with a few flowery words and the promise of food, but he feels his stomach rumble and the is still exhaustion creeping throughout his body. Even if he wants to drag this out, ask what it is about living that Dazai seems to hate so much, ask how long Dazai he has been like this, ask if he has always known about Dazai\u2019s\u2026inclinations, he doubts he\u2019ll get actual answers, not from Dazai.\nWith a curt nod, he crosses the room to the kitchen counter and starts pulling out take-out containers, tersely asking, \u201cDo you have plates or are you completely hopeless?\u201d\n\u201cNo need, I\u2019m not eating,\u201d Dazai replies, stepping behind him and heading toward the only room he hasn\u2019t been in yet (what he assumes is the bedroom). \u201cI\u2019ll set out a futon for you.\u201d\nHe turns to berate Dazai for not eating but the words die in his throat as he wonders why the hell he cares and what is the point of getting attached to someone so determined to die.\nSomewhere between when he stopped looking at Dazai and now, the book has vanished from Dazai\u2019s hands in some sort of sleight of hand that makes him doubt he\u2019ll ever be able to locate it again.\nStifling a sigh, he mutters a word of acknowledgment to Dazai\u2019s statement and turns back to the food.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day he wakes up to incessant pounding on the front door and he groans, bringing an arm to cover his face while he fervently wishes whoever is at the door will go away. Instead of heeding his wish, the knocking gets louder, accompanied with some muffled threats that sound like they are meant for Dazai.\nSwearing under his breath, he turns his head to the left, where Dazai\u2019s futon is laid out and where Dazai (the bastard) is sleeping soundly through the noise. He considers kicking Dazai awake and making the taller man answer the damn door before he pauses, thinking it through a little more. If whoever is at the door knows Dazai, it\u2019s possible they know him too, and might even know how he and Dazai are connected, might provide answers to the questions Dazai refuses to take seriously.\nSitting up, he moves quietly (not that he thinks Dazai is likely to wake up now after sleeping through everything else), slipping out from underneath the blanket he had used the previous night and ignoring the residual aches of his body.\nOnce out of the bedroom, the knocking is distinctively louder, as are the threats, and they are definitely aimed at Dazai. They\u2019re creative too, he muses as he strides toward the door, pausing to pick up one of the dozens of daggers that he had set out on the kitchen counter after pulling them from their various hiding places in his clothes yesterday. The blade\u2019s weight is reassuring in his hand and he tosses it idly, catching it with ease; if, for whatever reason, the person on the other side of the door attacks him he thinks he\u2019ll be able to handle his own just fine.\nUnlocking the door, he swings it open and blinks up at a man with blond hair tied back in a ponytail and a fierce glare behind glasses, hand raised to knock again. Standing behind the angry man is another one who looks younger, white hair sporting an asymmetrical cut and face wearing a rueful expression.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asks, eyes flicking back to the angry man who is now frowning at him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Nakahara?\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t a question asked in a particularly friendly tone, if anything, there is an edge of hostility that is fascinating. This man knows who he is, is the first person to address him by the family name Tachihara had mentioned, and the two of them are clearly not on great terms.\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d he replies, not wanting to reveal his predicament to someone who might be an enemy.\n\u201cDazai was supposed to be at work three hours ago,\u201d the man says, looking behind him into the apartment, \u201cI\u2019m assuming that if you killed him you wouldn\u2019t have answered the door.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I kill him?\u201d he asks, voice bored even though he is all but desperate to hear the answer, to get some clue about his dynamic with the strange man still asleep in the bedroom.\nThe man quirks an eyebrow, \u201cYou only threaten to every time you two have to work together. Look, I don\u2019t have time for small talk. Is Dazai here or not?\u201d\n\u201cKunikida-kun,\u201d a sing-song sounds behind him, answering the man\u2019s question in a way that has a forehead vein bulging above the man\u2019s glasses, \u201cwhat a pleasant surprise.\u201d He feels a presence at his back and steps to the side so Dazai can draw level with him and lean forward, grinning from ear-to-ear and fully dressed. \u201cAh, and Atsushi-kun, usually I have to miss a couple of days of work to get a joint visit from you two.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be missing any work, you lazy ass,\u201d the man who Dazai had called Kunikida snaps.\n\u201cThe president said he wants to talk to you, Dazai-san,\u201d the new voice comes from the younger man, Atsushi, who had previously been watching Kunikida and him interact with mild concern.\nDazai\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t falter but, standing in such close proximity, he can feel the lanky body tense for a split-second before relaxing again, \u201cDid he happen to say why?\u201d\n\u201cDoes your boss need a reason to speak to you?\u201d Kunikida cuts in.\n\u201cNo, but I might need a reason to hurry when I have such wonderful company.\u201d\nTwo pairs of eyes flick to him, Kunikida scowling and Atsushi blushing slightly, before turning back to Dazai. It is Kunikida who relents with a sigh, \u201cHe had a visitor when I came in this morning and has been in locked in his office since, he didn\u2019t say who is there or what it was about but\u2026\u201d Kunikida trails off, looking down at him meaningfully, seeming to imply that the odd behavior of Dazai\u2019s boss has something to do with his presence at Dazai\u2019s apartment.\nDazai hums thoughtfully, seeming to consider whether or not responding to the summons is worth the time. And he has no idea what Dazai does for a living (hadn\u2019t thought to ask about it yesterday), but he can\u2019t imagine someone being able to get away with missing work for days on end or not responding to a summons from their superior. Just the idea makes him exasperated.\nEventually, Dazai says, \u201cI suppose it can\u2019t be helped. Chuuya and I will be in within the hour.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018Chuuya and I\u2019?\u201d Kunikida asks, \u201cThe president didn\u2019t say anything about letting a mafia member stroll into the office with you.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in the middle of a truce,\u201d Dazai replies.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you can just-\u201d\n\u201cSee you later, Kunikida-kun!\u201d Dazai cuts across Kunikida as a hand closes around his arm and yanks him backward, out of the way of the door that Dazai slams shut in the other man\u2019s face.\nKunikida shouts a few more threats through the door, which Dazai chuckles at but doesn\u2019t reply to, moving further into the flat.\n\u201cWhy am I coming with you?\u201d he asks Dazai after the shouts die down and it seems like Kunikida and Atsushi have left.\n\u201cI was planning to bring you soon to see our doctor, might as well do it now,\u201d comes the absent-minded explanation.\n\u201cAre they good?\u201d\nDazai grins again, but this time it isn\u2019t the shit-eating expression used to antagonize Kunikida. The grin doesn\u2019t quite reach brown eyes and it has a sharp edge. \u201cIf what happened to you has a medical reason, she\u2019ll be able to reverse it.\u201d\nThe prospect of being done with this, of finally remembering who he is and what he is meant to be doing, is immediately energizing. \u201cWell then give me something suitable to change into and let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cSo eager to leave me, Chuuya?\u201d\n\u201cIf we\u2019re really partners, why would me getting my memories back mean I was leaving you?\u201d he questions, raising an eyebrow in a challenge.\nDazai doesn\u2019t look so much as ruffled by the question, \u201cConsidering that you\u2019ll be able to remember how to get to your own apartment, it seems obvious.\u201d\nThey both know Dazai wasn\u2019t referring to him moving back into his own place and they stare at each other, his own eyes narrowed as he tries to pick apart the carefully innocent expression on Dazai\u2019s face that seems to have no cracks. After several long minutes, he lets out a huff and breaks the staring contest, \u201cJust give me something to wear, bastard.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf Dazai had his way, he would have waited at least a day before bringing Chuuya to the agency offices with him. No matter how well Chuuya was pretending to cope with it, forgetting twenty-two years of life in an instant would be stressful for anyone. Dazai himself isn\u2019t sure how well he\u2019d handle it if he were in Chuuya\u2019s shoes.\nGlancing at Chuuya out of the corner of his eye, Dazai takes in the neutral expression on the man\u2019s face, recognizing it easily as the one Chuuya wears when he doesn\u2019t want to reveal his concerns. It isn\u2019t entirely successful, the stress is still evident on Chuuya\u2019s face, slightly more prominent than it had been the previous night, but Dazai can guess part of the reason behind it.\nChuuya had a nightmare last night.\nDazai had woke up to the sound of Chuuya thrashing on his futon just a few feet away, eyelids fluttering rapidly as aborted protests left his lips. Scrambling out from under his blankets, he quickly shook Chuuya awake, pulling Chuuya so he was sitting upright and holding him steady as the shorter man took in deep lungfuls of air.\nThey had sat that way for twenty minutes, Dazai keeping Chuuya steady and grounded, Chuuya staring off into the distance, his face empty.\nChuuya had broken the silence first, muttering, \u201cI suppose you also know whether or not it\u2019s regular for me to have nightmares like that.\u201d\nThere were a lot of answers Dazai could have given. He could have said that the last time he had witnessed Chuuya having a nightmare they had been sixteen, could have said that he had known Chuuya didn\u2019t stop having nightmares at sixteen but had just gotten better at having them silently and hiding the evidence. He could have said that he didn\u2019t know if Chuuya had nightmares anymore, that this was the first time they had fallen asleep in the same room together since Dazai had left the Port Mafia.\nInstead, he had said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\nMore silence had fallen after that, Chuuya\u2019s face still pale, his breath still coming too quickly, Dazai\u2019s hands still gripping Chuuya\u2019s shoulders because he didn\u2019t want to let go and Chuuya didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nEventually, Chuuya\u2019s eyes slid to meet Dazai\u2019s, something wary in his gaze as he asked, \u201cMy ability is gravity manipulation, right?\u201d\nNot sure why the question had come up, Dazai nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSo, I can float in the air or make things heavy. I can\u2019t\u2026create blackholes or anything, right?\u201d\nDazai\u2019s fingers had twitched against Chuuya\u2019s shoulders and he finally let go. \u201cWhy do you ask? Did something like that happen in your dream?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter? It\u2019s my ability, I should know how it works.\u201d\nShrugging, Dazai had replied, \u201cYour ability is gravity manipulation, Chuuya.\u201d\nTechnically, it wasn\u2019t a lie, and Dazai can\u2019t find it in himself to be remorseful for withholding the truth. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to find a way to return Chuuya\u2019s memories before the other man accidentally activates Corruption, but it has to be safer if Chuuya doesn\u2019t know there is something more to activate.\nAnd his eyes had looked so haunted that Dazai knows the nightmare had been about Corruption, that Chuuya must have been subconsciously remembering something about his past. What harm was there in letting Chuuya live without the floating ax of Corruption hovering above his neck for a few days?\nAs they walk to the agency, Dazai keeps careful track of their surroundings. He has no doubt that Mori has people tailing them, probably as much to keep Chuuya safe as to make sure Dazai doesn\u2019t turn one of his most \u2018loyal dogs\u2019 to the light. It takes him three minutes to find their tail and another two to decide to leave it alone\u2014when it comes down to it he\u2019ll be able to shake this one easily.\nFor now, it\u2019s more important to keep Mori comfortable than to have privacy.\nWhen they arrive at the office, Dazai knows immediately that Kunikida prepared the others for Chuuya\u2019s arrive. It\u2019s surprisingly considerate of him, Dazai makes a mental note to be slightly less annoying for a couple of days as he motions Chuuya to a seat in the waiting area.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the president and then take you to see the doctor,\u201d he explains as Chuuya settles into a chair.\nBlue eyes are scanning the office, Chuuya\u2019s shoulders tensing just slightly as he murmurs, \u201cThat truce you mentioned to Kunikida, how long has it been going on?\u201d\n\u201cNot long enough for them to be comfortable with you being here,\u201d Dazai answers honestly with a shrug, \u201cI won\u2019t take long, don\u2019t miss me too much!\u201d With a wink, he is gone before Chuuya can ask more questions, crossing the room to knock on the president\u2019s door and slip inside.\nImmediately, Dazai wants to turn around and walk out.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Dazai-kun,\u201d Mori says with a smile that is meant to be placating but that falls far short of putting Dazai at ease.\nIgnoring the greeting, Dazai shifts his gaze to Fukuzawa, who is seated on the couch opposite the mafia boss. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Chuuya\u2019s condition would be treated this seriously right away.\u201d\n\u201cFor anyone else, it might not be, but Nakahara\u2019s ability does complicate things,\u201d Fukuzawa replies. \u201cMori-sensei came to speak to me about it personally and with our current ceasefire it has been decided we will put people from both organizations on the case.\u201d\n\u201cChuuya hasn\u2019t been evaluated by a medical professional yet. It\u2019s possible that there isn\u2019t a case.\u201d\nMori chuckles, \u201cIf you really believed that you would have taken him to the agency doctor as soon as you found him. He was that much closer to death last night than he is today, dear Yosano\u2019s job would have been much easier.\nTurning his attention (reluctantly) back to the mafia boss, he says, \u201cI was under the impression that there was no evidence of an ability user at Chuuya\u2019s last operation. It has to be one or the other.\u201d\nReaching into his jacket, Mori produces a folded piece of paper, the smile still playing around his mouth though with an edge of bemusement, \u201cAt the time you spoke with Hirotsu there was no evidence of an ability user involved. We now have reason to believe otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the price of the mafia\u2019s willingness to share this information?\u201d Dazai prompts.\n\u201cI am sure I don\u2019t need to emphasize Chuuya\u2019s importance to the Port Mafia,\u201d Mori muses, \u201cI am quite invested in making sure he has a quick and full recovery. If that doesn\u2019t happen in your company within three weeks, we will take over completely.\u201d\nDazai opens his mouth to say in polite but no uncertain terms that he\u2019ll hand an amnesic Chuuya over to Mori\u2019s custody over his dead body. However, Fukuzawa speaks first, preventing him from showing any more of his hand to Mori than he already has.\n\u201cI have already told Mori-sensei that the agency will comply with those terms,\u201d the president says.\nNot the response he would prefer, but with both bosses in agreement, Dazai merely inclines his head in deference to the statement. Stepping further into the office, he accepts the folded document from Mori, meeting red eyes and reading the unspoken threat in them. Trying to work around the terms of the agreement will end poorly for Chuuya, Dazai doesn\u2019t have a single doubt about that, and he doesn\u2019t let anything show on his face than polite disinterest in everything that Mori\u2019s gaze implies as he pockets the paper without looking at its contents.\n\u201cWith such a tight deadline, I would like to get to work. Is there anything else, president?\u201d\nFukuzawa shakes his head, \u201cKeep me updated, Dazai.\u201d\nWith a nod of acknowledgment, Dazai slips back out of the office, closing the door firmly behind him to prevent curious blue eyes from seeing (or catching the attention of) the mafia boss behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt turns out Dazai is a detective.\nSomehow, it\u2019s baffling and completely unsurprising at the same time. Even though he has spent less than twenty-four hours with Dazai, it didn\u2019t take long at all to realize that Dazai is brilliant, mind running a mile a second at all times. It would make sense that such a degree of intelligence would be right at home with detective work.\nExcept the Armed Detective Agency feels like more than a detective office. After all, he\u2019s quite curious to learn where the \u2018Armed\u2019 part of the name comes into play, especially since he doesn\u2019t see any weapons.\nWhile Dazai is in the closed-door meeting with the agency president, he studies the others in the room.\nThere are eight people in the office. While they all seem aware of his presence, almost no one is paying him attention.\nAlmost no one.\nHis eyes flick to meet blue, the youngest person the room holds his stare for a split-second before dropping her attention back to her work. He vaguely wonders why the Armed Detective Agency is employing children, wonders why she alone studies him so closely, as if she has some investment in his presence here.\nThe door to the side office opens, pulling his attention away from the girl to meet Dazai\u2019s gaze as Dazai steps out of the office and closes the door before he can even catch a glimpse of who the president\u2019s mysterious visitor is. Dazai waves a hand in a silent command that he follows, getting up from the seat and crossing the room to meet Dazai in front of the door to another corridor.\nOnce up close, he frowns. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\nDazai quirks an eyebrow, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\n\u201cYou look upset,\u201d he replies with a shrug.\n\u201cI look the same way I did when I walked into the office.\u201d\nHe studies Dazai\u2019s face again, the statement isn\u2019t entirely true. While the serene look that Dazai had been wearing is still there, something about it just feels inauthentic. He can\u2019t put his finger on what it is or how he even knows, but he knows he is right.\nDazai has said more than once that no one knows him better than Dazai does\u2026perhaps the reverse is also true.\nAware that he won\u2019t get an answer out of Dazai, he shrugs again, \u201cWhere is the doctor?\u201d\nDazai leads the way down the hallway, knocking on the frame of an open door before stepping inside. \u201cA patient for you, sensei.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anyone going out on a job,\u201d a woman replies, back turned to the door, \u201chow did someone\u2026?\u201d she trails off as she turns around to meet his gaze. Unlike most of the others in the main office (everyone save the girl, really), something about her feels familiar. Quirking an eyebrow, she says, \u201cHe looks less injured than last time.\u201d\nLast time? Why would he be visiting an agency doctor if he was in the Port Mafia? Wouldn\u2019t the mafia have physicians of their own?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a special case,\u201d Dazai says, explaining the situation as the doctor ushers him inside and to a seat next to a workstation.\nAs Dazai talks, the woman starts evaluating him, shining lights in his eyes, testing his vitals, humming thoughtfully to herself as she quickly scratches down notes. When Dazai stops speaking, she straightens, frowning at Dazai, \u201cYou said he fell hard? Was it from a higher height than he has endured before? He didn\u2019t use his ability to soften the landing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing seemed notable to the people who were there with him.\u201d\n\u201cFor a normal person, the types of falls he takes regularly would have caused problems long before this, I find it hard to believe just the one event is responsible,\u201d the doctor muses. Her next statement is directed down at him, \u201cDo you remember anything about before you woke up?\u201d\nHe shakes his head.\n\u201cNot even your name?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s Chuuya.\u201d\n\u201cIt is Chuuya,\u201d Dazai says.\nHe shrugs, \u201cThe name doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\u201d\nThe doctor half-turns so she can look at Dazai. \u201cI can\u2019t say with certainty whether it is completely medical or not. We can always go ahead and treat him, I\u2019m sure with Nakahara\u2019s history there are plenty of old wounds that have been healed incorrectly for me to handle even if the amnesia isn\u2019t caused by his fall yesterday. Not sure how he\u2019ll handle the process if he doesn\u2019t remember how my ability works.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an ability user?\u201d he asks.\nShe glances at him with a nod, \u201cAlmost everyone here is. I\u2019m assuming Dazai didn\u2019t give you much information?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even tell me your name,\u201d he says.\nWith an exasperated look in Dazai\u2019s direction, she gives him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m Yosano, I suppose I should say that it\u2019s nice to meet you again, Nakahara.\u201d\nEchoing the slightly odd sentiment, he continues, \u201cDazai did say that you would be able to reverse my memory loss if it was medical, that has to do with your ability?\u201d\n\u201cI can heal any wound,\u201d she explains. He thinks that sounds much more useful than nullification, \u201cbut my patient has to be half-dead for it to work.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t fond of the direction this seems to be going. \u201cSince I\u2019m not half-dead\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI would have to torture you until you are,\u201d The inclusion of the words \u2018have to\u2019 in Yosano\u2019s sentence makes it sound like a burden but there\u2019s a sadistic edge to her tone that makes him think she is more than willing to handle that step whenever the situation calls for it.\nThinking it over, he points out, \u201cBut no one seems to think my amnesia was actually caused by however I fell. What else could have caused it?\u201d\n\u201cAn ability user,\u201d Dazai replies.\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just nullify it then?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI\u2019d need to get my hands on the ability user to do that.\u201d\nHe rolls his eyes. If someone has an ability less useful than Dazai\u2019s he\u2019d be surprised to learn that. It\u2019s probably a miracle the bandaged bastard is still alive considering how stick thin Dazai is and how obnoxious Dazai can apparently be.\n\u201cWhich one do you think it is, Dazai?\u201d\nDazai hesitates before admitting, \u201cAn ability user makes more sense.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019d rather exhaust that route before letting her torture me half-to-death,\u201d glancing at the doctor, he adds, \u201cnot to be disrespectful, Yosano-sensei.\u201d\nShe flashes him a predator\u2019s grin, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my feelings, Nakahara, someone always gets injured eventually. Come find me if you change your mind.\u201d\nThey don\u2019t make their escape from the infirmary as quickly as he would have liked. As much as he doesn\u2019t doubt that Yosano is great at her job, something about her makes him nervous (probably the part of her that seems very excited to bring him to death\u2019s door in order to heal him).\nWhen they make their way back to the main office, Dazai makes an off-hand comment about people already looking into the leads they have on a possible ability user and says there isn\u2019t anything to worry about right now. Then, Dazai is dragged by the collar of the trench coat to an empty desk by Kunikida, who smacks the bastard around the back of the head with a notebook and states that Dazai can\u2019t just skip work whenever the mood hits.\nStifling a sigh, he returns to his seat in the waiting area and stares out the window, wondering just how long it will take to make progress in the search for the ability user. Wondering if any of his memories will come back in the interim.\nHe sits, lost in his thoughts, for the better part of four hours until Dazai finishes working and herds Chuuya out of the offices and back to the apartment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt becomes a routine. Waking up, making a cup of coffee, dragging Dazai\u2019s lazy ass out of bed, and walking to the Armed Detective Agency\u2019s office. There, while Dazai occasionally works (or more commonly lazes around), he researches. While the agency has files on the Port Mafia they don\u2019t seem to want a not-quite-enemy to read through them, which leaves him no other options than to gather information through interactions with the other agency members.\nHe starts with Yosano-sensei since her workspace is set apart from everyone else. From her, he doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of information. He gets the sense that she respects him as a potential threat, but that\u2019s about it.\n\u201cEven with the truce, you and I never have reason to work together,\u201d Yosano says as she scratches notes on a pad, \u201cyour job is generally to kill as many people as possible while mine is usually to keep as many alive as possible.\u201d\nShifting slightly in his seat at that picture, and at the ice in Yosano\u2019s tone as she talks about his evidently high body-count, he replies, \u201cI can see why we wouldn\u2019t have much overlap.\u201d\nShe nods, squints at something on the laptop screen in front of her, and takes another note. \u201cNot that I can\u2019t hold my own in a fight, but I\u2019ve been given the impression that you are usually sent in as a team of one. The only time you ever seem to be sent to a job with someone from the agency is when you\u2019re sent in with Dazai.\u201d\n\u201cKunikida mentioned that Dazai and I get paired together for work reasons, but no one has explained why.\u201d\n\u201cBecause together the pair of you could level a government in a day,\u201d Yosano mutters, as if not really paying attention to her words. Silence falls between them and she seems to realize what she said, finally looking over at him. \u201cIf you want more information, talk to Dazai. All I really know about you is that you\u2019re dangerous.\u201d\nFor some reason, he doesn\u2019t quite believe that statement but he lets it slide, nodding and murmuring a few words of thanks before leaving the infirmary.\nIf that is all Yosano knows about him, it doesn\u2019t explain why she felt more familiar to him than the others in the agency, why he keeps having unnervingly clear nightmares that sometimes end with him laying on her infirmary table half-dead.\nRegardless, pestering the doctor on the matter won\u2019t get him anywhere. He moves on.\nFrom Kenji, he gets plenty of chatter, though nothing he would really call information. He listens as the boy, with almost visible stars in gold eyes, describes the first time they met and how he had hung from the ceiling without his hat dropping off. Kenji glosses over why they had been fighting to sing his praises for several minutes. It\u2019s entertaining and gives him a bit of an ego boost, but it isn\u2019t all that helpful.\nNaomi shortly informs him that the reason he had fought Kenji (and evidently Yosano) was so that he could help the mafia use her and the other clerk as bait. He doesn\u2019t press much further on that and opts not to talk to her older brother for the sake of keeping the peace in the small office.\nIt is a little tricky to get anything out of Ranpo. The odd man seems to find his presence completely boring, or at least less interesting than the numerous sweets that pile high on the desk at the back of the office. Ranpo informs him that who he was, ultimately, means nothing since the world would only truly be missing out on anything if Ranpo were the one with amnesia.\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d Ranpo says, not even deigning to look up at him, \u201cyou really could rebuild your life however you feel like it and it would be of no consequence to the rest of the world. The mafia boss would find someone to replace you; losing your ability might be a bit of a blow at first but they would adapt. In the grand scheme of things, you\u2019re just not that important.\u201d\nFists clenching into the material of his jeans, he reminds himself that decking Ranpo across the face would be a bad idea, that the people around him are already on edge about his presence without him resorting to violence.\nRanpo continues, seemingly oblivious to his growing anger, \u201cNow, if I lost my memories it could be potentially catastrophic. I wouldn\u2019t lose my ability so I could still solve cases, but you\u2019re living evidence that the loss of memories does seem to impact the usefulness of an ability. You probably don\u2019t even remember the extent of your strength-\u201d\nHe turns on his heel and walks away, teeth gritting as Ranpo continues to ramble to thin air.\nOut of all the conversations he has had, he thinks that one might have been the biggest waste of his time. However, he is a little amazed he found someone who gets on his nerves easier than Dazai does.\nAfter the way their initial interaction had gone at Dazai\u2019s place, he skips over talking to Kunikida. He gets the impression that Kunikida barely knew him at all and had no interest in getting to know him. Although he is intrigued by the idea of Kunikida being partners with the man who has claimed over and over again to be his partner, he doesn\u2019t think pressing the issue with Kunikida will do any good.\nHe hesitates when it comes to talking with Kyouka. For some reason, she still takes to watching him closely while he\u2019s inside the agency\u2019s office, as if searching for any sign that his memories have returned. When he decides to speak with her, talking quietly as she files in a side room, Kyouka reveals that she used to be a member of the Port Mafia. When she explains that she was an assassin, his lips twist down into a frown, trying to reconcile his place in an organization that used (still uses?) children as killers. While they had a few interactions, she explained, their only real connection had been a shared mentor.\n\u201cIs that the woman called Kouyou?\u201d he asks, remembering the name from a phone call he overheard Dazai having a few days prior and his phone contacts.\nKyouka nods, something dark flickering across her face. \u201cI\u2019m never going back.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d he murmurs.\nHer eyes widen, surprise etched on her face as she pauses in her work, staring at him for a long moment before a small smile curls onto her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said the first time I saw you after leaving the mafia, when I told you I was staying with the agency. You really haven\u2019t changed, Chuuya-san.\u201d\nLater, when Dazai is finished pretending to do work and they make their way back to Dazai\u2019s flat, he plays Kyouka\u2019s words over in his head, repeating what she had said about him not changing, about his reactions being the same as Nakahara Chuuya.\nHe isn\u2019t sure how he feels about that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe is dying.\nHe has to be, there is no other explanation for the unspeakable agony tearing through his veins, the sensation that fire has replaced his lifeblood and is eating him alive.\nIt feels as if there is something inside his body, controlling his limbs, deciding his movements for him, that is far too massive for his skin to contain. It is pressing against his bones and muscles, demanding more space, threatening to tear him apart, to rip him into shreds without a care that it will be the end of his life.\nIt feels like he is captive in his own body, like it is no longer his own but that he offered it over to some ancient being in exchange for unspeakable power. The very idea is absurd but it is the only explanation that explains both his pain and the fact that he is holding a building in his hands, lifting through dense fog to float in mid-air and stare at\u2026at\u2026\nIs that a fucking dragon?\nIt is a dragon and he should feel more afraid than he does. He doesn\u2019t know if the lack of sheer terror is because his body isn\u2019t his or if it is because he truly believes he can win this fight.\n(And who the hell picks a fight with a dragon? A dragon so massive that it seems to be sprawled across the length of this city, the one that Dazai had informed him just the other day is called Yokohama.)\nThe building swings in a giant arc, moving with the pull of not-quite-his arms to smash the beast over the top of the head. And it goes down, crumpling underneath the force of the attack with a deafening thud before following up with an even louder roar.\nGreat, he just made the dragon mad.\nHe is dreaming.\nHe has to be, there is no other explanation for why he is fighting a goddamn dragon when he doesn\u2019t remember how a dragon got here in the first place, let alone leaving Dazai\u2019s apartment and deciding to battle such a creature, let alone why he would want to do this at all.\nExcept\u2026it doesn\u2019t quite explain everything.\nIt doesn\u2019t explain why everything is so vivid, so lifelike. Why the colors are so bright and the continued battle is so precise. Why he feels the pain so clearly without it tugging him from his sleep. Why an almost overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu has swamped him.\nIt\u2019s almost like\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u2026almost like\u2026\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up with a gasp, jerking upright in his futon to stare blindly into the darkness.\nHis heartbeat is thundering in his ears, racing so rapidly he is almost concerned that it will just give up and give out at any second. His breath is coming too quickly, almost in gasps, and he tries to regulate it, tries to slow it down so he can think beyond the stomach-turning fear that gripped him the moment he opened his eyes.\nThis is the first time he has dreamed about this particular battle, but it isn\u2019t the first time he has had a dream like this.\nEvery night since losing his memories, ten days ago, he has had a dream like this. A dream that wakes him up in a cold sweat, that is too vivid, to crystalline while he is dreaming and after he has woken up, for him to be comfortable calling it a dream.\nThey have to be memories.\nIt is the only thing that makes sense.\nAnd that is terrifying in its own right. That he used to be the type of man who would stare down a dragon without flinching, that there is something inside of him that gives him the power to stare down a dragon while simultaneously killing him slowly for drawing on that power. He can\u2019t shake the sense that it has something to do with his ability, that there is something more to it than gravity manipulation. And if he has that kind of power at his fingertips, how often does he use it? How does he keep it from killing him?\nWhy does he willingly give up control of his own body?\nThe answers are just out of reach, as if the only memories he is allowed to access are the ones that will terrify him but not tell him why, only allowed to have the memories that flirt with the concept of \u2018what\u2019 but ignore the \u2018how\u2019.\nThey are answers that he suspects aren\u2019t only locked away in his own head but in Dazai\u2019s as well, if the way brown eyes carefully search his face every night after a nightmare is any indication.\nOne of Dazai\u2019s hands is resting on his shoulder, it always is after one of these dreams, the other man offering support in silence, waiting for him to sort through his own thoughts and orient himself without pushing for conversation. He suspects Dazai is more than glad to keep quiet, suspects that Dazai knows he is dreaming about his own memories and that Dazai is choosing to say nothing about it.\nOn previous nights, that thought, just the very idea that Dazai is withholding information directly about him, is infuriating.\nTonight, he is too exhausted to get indignant about it.\nBlinking himself back to reality, he slowly shifts his gaze away from staring off into the distance to meet Dazai\u2019s. Those brown eyes are too measuring, they always are after a nightmare, as if Dazai is expecting him to wake up with his memories. It is tiring enough to constantly want to remember every detail he used to know, but the desires of others, the sensation that they\u2019re all just waiting for this other man to reappear, for Nakahara Chuuya to come back\u2014looking at him like he has all but killed the person he used to be\u2014is enough to make him never want to leave this apartment again.\nThe only time he has ever asked Dazai about the nightmares, Dazai lied to him.\nHe can\u2019t explain how he knows it was a lie, how he can tell when Dazai\u2019s face has no visible changes, when Dazai\u2019s tone never wavers. He could just tell that Dazai was lying to him.\nPerhaps it\u2019s because of the shared history that Dazai won\u2019t tell him about.\nStifling a yawn, he tilts his head up at the ceiling, \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of these things. Even if my memories can come back naturally, how can they do that if I\u2019m sleep-deprived from waking up in the middle of the night, every night?\u201d\n\u201cThat does seem unlikely,\u201d Dazai comments.\n\u00a0Whether Dazai thinks his memories coming back naturally is unlikely or coming back with his state of sleep-deprivation unlikely he isn\u2019t sure. He doesn\u2019t particularly want to ask for clarification.\nShaking his head, he shrugs off Dazai\u2019s hand and settles back on his futon, ignoring the small voice in the corner of his head that protests breaking the only moment of contact Dazai ever seems to allow between them. Rolling over so his back is facing Dazai, he stares at the blank wall, listening as Dazai shifts back to the other futon and settles down as well.\nDazai\u2019s breathing evens out, but he can\u2019t tell if Dazai has fallen asleep or if the other man is pretending to sleep, just like he is.\nTrying his best not to remember the pain from his dream (and isn\u2019t it ironic that he is trying to forget anything at all?) he counts his inhales and exhales, waiting until the sun rises so he can give up the farce of restful sleep and go about the day.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes thirteen days before he is able to pull Atsushi aside for a talk, a whole three days after he has already worked his way through the rest of the Armed Detective Agency (save their seldom-seen president).\nAtsushi is the last person he talks to simply because Atsushi turns out to be the hardest person to have a conversation with outside of Dazai\u2019s earshot. He can\u2019t tell if Dazai was going out of the way to prevent them from speaking or if the mentor/mentee dynamic in the agency is just that airtight. However, after almost two weeks of watching them interact he gets the sense that Atsushi understands Dazai better than anyone suspects.\nHis chance comes when Kunikida drags Dazai out of the office to go look for clues on a job they\u2019re working. Casually, he asks if he can buy Atsushi a drink from the cafe on the first floor of the agency building, pleased when the boy immediately says yes. They make their way downstairs with only a few curious looks from the others and take a seat at a booth. While waiting for their drinks, they make small talk about Atsushi\u2019s latest case, but as soon as the cups are set down on their table and the waiter walks away, the smile shrinks from the boy\u2019s face.\n\u201cYou still can\u2019t remember anything, Chuuya-san?\u201d\nIt\u2019s straight to the point, he appreciates it. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could be more help but I never did interact with you much, you were busy with mafia business most of the time.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why Dazai doesn\u2019t want me to stay with someone from the mafia?\u201d he asks, moving straight to the questions that he suspects Atsushi might have answers too.\nSurprise flickers on the boy\u2019s face. \u201cFor your safety, I suppose. I\u2019ve met the mafia boss, there\u2019s no telling what he would do to try and get your memories to come back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Dazai can just stand up to the boss of the Port Mafia? Just like that?\u201d\nAtsushi shrugs, \u201cHe has before. Dazai-san\u2019s history is really complicated, I don\u2019t know much about it, but he has said before that he\u2019s too important for the mafia boss to kill him.\u201d\nHe snorts, \u201cThat isn\u2019t just Dazai being arrogant?\u201d\n\u201cHe did use to be a mafia executive, over four years ago now. Akutagawa told me that people assumed he would become the boss one day.\u201d\nThat\u2019s new information. New information that feels extremely important, that he thinks someone should have thought to tell him earlier. It explains so much. Explains why Dazai seemingly has the contact information of so many mafia members, how Dazai had been able to find him so easily that first night, how they would have known each other without anyone else in the agency knowing him.\nBut if Dazai hasn\u2019t been with the Port Mafia for over for yours, and the agency and the Port Mafia were enemies up until a few months ago, that means Dazai was lying about them being partners.\nFor some reason, that conclusion leaves a sour taste in his mouth.\n\u201cSounds like Dazai is only protecting me from the mafia to cripple their organization,\u201d he murmurs into his cup.\nAtsushi frowns. \u201cI figured it was because you\u2019re important to him.\u201d\nHe blinks, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but he treats you differently, especially from any other mafia members. Part of it must just from you two being partners for so long back then, I guess. You two seem to speak a different language with each other. But whenever something happens he always knows where you are.\u201d\n\u201cSo, he keeps track of a threat.\u201d\nA ghost of a smile flickers on Atsushi\u2019s face, \u201cDazai-san doesn\u2019t let threats know where he lives, and he doesn\u2019t answer their calls in the middle of a job, much less vanish immediately after.\u201d\n\u201cHe was working when I called him?\u201d he asks, exasperated, \u201cno wonder Kunikida was furious.\u201d\n\u201cKunikida is always mad when he ditches work,\u201d Atsushi says with a laugh. \u201cEither way, I hope your memories come back to you, Chuuya-san.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be more trouble for you all?\u201d\nAnother shrug, \u201cI think it would make Dazai feel better.\u201d\nWhen Dazai returns and they make their way back to the apartment, his head is still spinning from his conversation with Atsushi. He tunes out Dazai\u2019s mindless chatter, watching the taller man\u2019s facial expressions instead and trying to piece together all the clues he has received so far to create a picture of who Chuuya and Dazai were to each other.\nIt\u2019s hard to figure out when the one person who actually knows the truth refuses to say anything.\nAs he considers Dazai from across the table over yet another meal of take-out, he wonders just what he\u2019ll have to do to get an answer out of the taller man. Pushing his food around with his chopsticks, he decides there isn\u2019t anything to lose by being blunt (and even less room for Dazai to redirect the conversation).\n\u201cDid we sleep together?\u201d\nDazai almost chokes on the food.\nHe smirks, that alone makes having this conversation worth it.\nRegaining composure, Dazai says, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what our relationship was before this happened,\u201d his voice is even, as calm as if they\u2019re discussing what to order for dinner instead of the possibility of them being lovers.\n\u201cAnd your best guess is that we were fucking?\u201d Dazai asks, incredulity dripping from each word.\nHe quirks an eyebrow, not buying the tone of Dazai\u2019s response. \u201cMy memories are gone, not my ability to tell when someone is checking me out.\u201d He waves at his attire to make his point. Since Dazai doesn\u2019t, in fact, have any clothes that suitably fit him, they had ended up at a clothing store a day after speaking with the agency\u2019s doctor. While he had been the one to try on jeans almost sculpted to his body, he hadn\u2019t forced Dazai\u2019s gaze to linger on his ass then or at any point since then.\nNoting the way Dazai doesn\u2019t seem inclined to argue the point, he continues, \u201cIt explains why we would be contacting each other regularly, outside of work reasons, despite being in organizations that barely manage to maintain a civil truce. I\u2019d think we were dating if our dynamic wasn\u2019t so obviously antagonistic from the outside.\u201d\n\u201cChuuya-\u201d\nNot interested in whatever deflection Dazai had prepared, he cuts the detective off, changing the subject on his own terms. \u201cYou know, that name still doesn\u2019t resonate with me.\u201d\nOne thing he appreciates immensely about Dazai is how easily Dazai rolls with any change of subject, how quickly the other man\u2019s mind catches up to whatever he is talking about. Sometimes it feels a little invasive, the way Dazai can all but read his mood changes without any effort, but he has largely found it comforting.\nIt\u2019s weird to meet strangers who seemingly know who you are, but Dazai is the only person he\u2019s met so far that never completely felt like a stranger, and he thinks this has something to do with it.\nDazai\u2019s head is tilted to the side, \u201cIt has only been two weeks.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t two weeks a long time not to associate a name with yourself?\u201d he points out, eyes dropping back to his food. \u201cIt means this isn\u2019t going to wear off for a while, if it ever does.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t a reply right away. When Dazai does speak, the words come out slowly, as if being considered twice before being voiced. \u201cHave you considered the possibility that you won\u2019t get your memories back?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t look back up at Dazai as he pushes rice around in his dish. \u201cOf course, I have.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Dazai prompts.\n\u201cAnd what? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be able to just define a new life for myself when the agency and the Port Mafia are so invested in me. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live in Yokohama, anyway, considering that I think I\u2019m a wanted criminal. I don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201d Glancing up at Dazai from underneath his lashes, he asks, \u201cWhat would you do? If I never got my memories back.\u201d\nEmotions flicker across Dazai\u2019s face, moving too quickly for him to even hazard what they are but present enough to be a shock. After two weeks with Dazai, he knows it\u2019s rare for Dazai\u2019s carefully crafted masks to falter and reveal what the man is actually thinking and this\u2026this is more than a falter. Fascinated, he leans forward slightly, waiting for Dazai\u2019s thoughts to stop swirling and for Dazai to actually reply.\nEventually, Dazai says, \u201cI suppose I would help you find wherever you end up wanting to go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I wanted to move to the other side of the world?\u201d\nDazai shrugs, \u201cThen I would get you there.\u201d\n\u201cYou have known me for at least five years,\u201d he muses, Atsushi\u2019s earlier words playing in the back of his mind, \u201cwe stayed in contact even though you left the Port Mafia, you\u2019re probably branded a traitor and I\u2019m an executive, we shouldn\u2019t have stayed in contact the way we did.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Chuuya have a point with all of his rambling?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t reply. Instead, he puts down his chopsticks and gets to his feet, stepping around the table, hyper-aware of the way brown eyes watch his every move. When he comes to a stop beside Dazai, he reaches out, carding his fingers through brown locks.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dazai asks him, voice all but a whisper.\n\u201cYour hair is soft,\u201d he murmurs, more to himself than to Dazai, \u201cI wondered if it was.\u201d\n\u201cChuuya.\u201d\nHe thinks it is meant to be a warning but what good is a warning made out of a name he doesn\u2019t recognize? Fingers sliding down to rest at the back of Dazai\u2019s neck, he leans down and brushes his lips against Dazai\u2019s.\nIt feels familiar.\nAs much the way Dazai\u2019s presence had when they first met, or the warmth of his ability activating under his skin, or even the weight of a dagger in the palm of his hand, this feels familiar. It feels like a memory tugging at the corner of his brain, trying to burst past whatever blockade has kept him from remembering, as if this might be the spark that sets everything aflame.\nFingers curling into the short hairs under his grip, he presses into another kiss, and a third, chasing the feeling of the ever-distant memories that somehow, for some reason, seem to respond to this. His eyes flutter shut as he concentrates on them, almost forgetting the sensation of soft lips against his.\nAlmost, but not quite.\nDazai\u2019s lips give way easily against his. At first, he assumes it is due to surprise\u2014he has been reluctant to touch anyone since waking up, not wanting to potentially make a major social faux pas with someone he has a bad history with. But this, this feels\u2026right, and Dazai\u2019s reaction affirms his suspicion that this isn\u2019t anywhere near a first for either of them.\nA hand splays against his chest, resting there for a moment before applying pressure, breaking them apart. Chuuya blinks his eyes open and looks down at Dazai, taking in the way Dazai\u2019s lips are pressed together in a thin line and the faint pink on his cheeks.\nBiting back a smirk, he tilts his head, \u201cYou look flustered.\u201d\nDazai opens his mouth to reply and hesitates, eyes narrowed as he stares at Chuuya. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nSinking to his knees beside Dazai, he asks, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou look\u2026different. Like you remembered something.\u201d\nHe hums in acknowledgment and drops his hand from Dazai\u2019s hair, glancing away as he tries to gather his thoughts.\nMemories are flicking through his head at rapid speeds, pushed to the forefront and then vanishing before he can get more than a glimpse. It feels like grabbing for snowflakes: an exercise in futility as each one he catches melts before his eyes. The little flashes he does piece together are all Dazai.\nDazai laughing at him as he feels heat rise to his cheeks and a responding laugh bubbling in his own chest. Dazai with a bandage over his eye\u2014is it injured?\u2014and looking young, so painfully young that Chuuya doesn\u2019t want to know why blood is splattered on his face, why Dazai\u2019s visible eye looks so dead. Dazai\u2019s hands tangled through his hair, much like Chuuya\u2019s had just been in Dazai\u2019s, pulling them closer together. A soft smirk playing on Dazai\u2019s lips as he collapses onto a soft bed half on top of Chuuya, both of them naked and buzzing with satisfaction. A strong sense of relief and trust, so strong that it\u2019s almost overwhelming to feel just the echoes here, in a faint memory, as Dazai appears in the midst of a battlefield, completely poised as if the world isn\u2019t falling to shit around them.\nWhat he says out loud is, \u201cI remember that my name is Chuuya.\u201d\nThat earns him a quirked eyebrow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really have to remember that since everyone has already told you that much.\u201d\nRolling his eyes, Chuuya retorts, \u201cAnd I just told you that the name didn\u2019t mean anything to me before. Now it does. That\u2019s progress.\u201d\nDazai considers him, eyes roving Chuuya\u2019s face in silence before he says, \u201cYou remembered more than that, I can tell you did.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d he asks, stalling so he can hopefully find something to say that isn\u2019t \u2018I remembered that we did use to fuck\u2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in your eyes,\u201d Dazai replies.\nShrugging, Chuuya gets to his feet and walks back around the table, settling back in his original seat and reaching for his drink. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything particularly helpful, just little snippets out of order, without context. All they told me is that we\u2019ve known each other for a while\u2014which I already figured out\u2014and that this wasn\u2019t the first time we have kissed and definitely not the most intimate we\u2019ve ever been\u2014which I also already figured out.\u201d\nIf that matters to Dazai, means anything to Dazai, nothing shows on his face. Instead, Dazai\u2019s voice takes on a slightly sing-song quality that lets Chuuya know that there isn\u2019t anything else productive to be gained from this conversation. \u201cIf the key to you remembering things is to be told that they are true, I might get a little disappointed.\u201d\nChuuya doesn\u2019t bother replying, turning his attention back to his food, trying not to dwell on the memories he did get back, trying not to fixate on the memory of how soft Dazai\u2019s hair had been, how utterly pliant Dazai had gone in his grip. It is obvious Dazai doesn\u2019t have any interest in pursuing it further, and why would he if Chuuya can\u2019t remember the evidently considerable history they had together?\nUp until this point, his focus has largely been on unraveling his connection to Dazai. In fact, it had almost become obsessive. He thinks he can be excused, given that he is living with Dazai, given that Dazai is the only person he has met that he felt he could immediately trust.\nNow, it is time to turn his focus to himself, to focus on remembering who he was for the sake of him, not for anyone else.\nHe can handle that.\nMaybe.\nHe still doesn\u2019t know how exactly to get his memories back but he supposes it is one step at a time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat night, he dreams about Dazai.\nAnd, really, Chuuya thinks he should have seen this one coming after the day he had. He should have anticipated that being inundated with memories of the bandaged bastard meant that such memories would carry over to the memory-filled dreams he has every night.\nThough, he might have anticipated something with rose-tinted lenses. A dream about laughing together as teenagers or about the time (or more likely times) they had slept together over the course of however many years they had known each other. A dream about being partners, perhaps, because he is finally starting to buy the line Dazai has repeated to him over and over anytime he asked about their relationship.\nInstead, his brain sticks to the pattern and drops him into a nightmare.\nIt isn\u2019t like any of the others. There is no physical pain, no sensation of being a spectator in his body, no battle or fight or corpses dropping in front of him. Compared to all of his other dreams, it\u2019s relatively mundane from start to finish. Chuuya debarks from a plane, slides into the back seat of a car that comes to pick him up, idly converses with the man driving, gets dropped off at a skyscraper, and rides the elevator up to the top office to meet a man that sends a slight shudder down his spine.\nHe supposes it is a nightmare because Dazai isn\u2019t there.\nAnd Dazai hasn\u2019t been in any of his dreams before so, normally, the absence wouldn\u2019t be unusual. But he dreams about Dazai, about how Dazai is supposed to be there, how Dazai has always been somewhere nearby on days like that one, how Dazai isn\u2019t just absent but that Dazai has vanished entirely.\nThat Dazai left. Left the organization (it must be the Port Mafia, he realizes), left their partnership, left Chuuya behind.\nIt is this dream, more than any of the others, that Chuuya is positive isn\u2019t just a dream. If he hadn\u2019t already concluded that he was reliving old memories, this would be the final straw, would be the red flag he couldn\u2019t ignore.\nBecause Dazai keeps claiming that they are partners, but Dazai wasn\u2019t there when Chuuya lost his memories, wasn\u2019t there when Chuuya woke up in the middle of a battlefield, doesn\u2019t even work in the same organization that Chuuya is evidently a higher-up in.\nAll the pieces of the abstract puzzle Chuuya has been fiddling with make sense if the dream is true, if Dazai really did walk away without a glance back, without so much as a note or a word of goodbye.\nIt makes sense why Kunikida said Chuuya always threatens to kill Dazai, the sense of betrayal that rips through him in his dream is so intense that he looks down to see if someone also sank a physical dagger into his gut and then twisted.\nIt makes sense why there isn\u2019t any information about Dazai in his phone, why the name isn\u2019t even saved under \u2018Dazai\u2019 because he would be texting not just a traitor to his organization, but someone that betrayed his personal trust, regularly.\nIt makes sense why Dazai won\u2019t explain who they are to each other, what their history is, because he is furious in this dream, angry and hurt and livid and those must be emotions Dazai doesn\u2019t want to deal with again, doesn\u2019t want to apologize his way through again (if he ever apologized at all).\nWhen Chuuya wakes up, jolting upright on the futon, staring blindly at the opposite wall, heart pounding and breath too quick, no hand rests on his shoulder.\nEven without looking over, Chuuya knows that Dazai isn\u2019t here, that Dazai is gone.\nHe knows the dream is a memory because all he can feel is resignation at the reality of Dazai\u2019s absence now. He can\u2019t dredge up an ounce of surprise over the fact that, after two weeks of being there when Chuuya needs him, Dazai would vanish the one night when Dazai\u2019s presence would mean more to Chuuya than it has in the past.\nThat just seems to be consistent with the type of man Dazai is, to Nakahara Chuuya at least.\nIf Chuuya had known this was what his relationship with Dazai is like, he never would have persisted so stubbornly to know the truth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDazai has always been most comfortable at night.\nThe hours when there aren\u2019t any people to perform to, no need to keep his thoughts and emotions off of his face, have always been liberating. In the Port Mafia, those hours were well past midnight, the short window of time between when he was finished handling missions and before the sun began to peek over the horizon. In the Armed Detective Agency, he is able to take midnight walks like a relatively normal person, to be back at his apartment before the streets are completely dead at the ghost hours of the morning.\nWhen he first left the mafia, Dazai had been apprehensive about the comfort he found in the night, afraid that it spoke more to his inability to change, to the fact that he was so steeped in the violence of Yokohama\u2019s underworld that he would never be able to do real good. Now, he has learned, and come to accept, that the night and the darkness are two different things.\nIt would be one thing if this was a calming influence for him because he is most comfortable in the shadows, but that isn\u2019t the case.\nDazai is most comfortable without watching eyes, without the expectations of brilliance or trouble or reliability that others have come to put on him. If he could find such a thing in the light of day, he would relish it just as much as he relishes the empty streets and quiet stillness of Yokohama after most of the law-abiding citizens have gone to bed.\nHe has been wandering for the better part of an hour, trying to make sense of the rapid tumble of thoughts and emotions that have been cluttering his head since dinner, since Chuuya had crashed through the carefully maintained barrier Dazai had placed between them the moment he knew Chuuya\u2019s memories were gone.\nEven now, nearly four hours after it happened, Dazai can still feel the phantom of Chuuya\u2019s lips against his and he presses them into a thin line, trying to shove away the rush of disdain at himself for letting such a thing happen. He spent two damn weeks keeping himself just distant enough from Chuuya to be safe, two weeks avoiding any physical contact other than the minutes in the middle of the night when he kept hold of Chuuya after a nightmare and waited for Chuuya to free himself of the memories that chase his subconscious (and he wishes he could say the gesture is completely altruistic, that he didn\u2019t selfishly relish the moments of quiet he steals, that he didn\u2019t stay awake later and wait for Chuuya to fall asleep, drinking in the sight of Chuuya peaceful and vulnerable in a way Chuuya never would have allowed if he had his memories).\nTwo weeks living with Chuuya, watching as Chuuya found some semblance of a home with him and being irritated with himself for savoring each moment so much.\nAll of the careful distance, the work he put into keeping his voice the right side of casual, his expression as platonic as possible, thrown out the window at the first brush of Chuuya\u2019s lips against his.\nAnd he had melted. \nThoughts and calculations and caution abandoned as his body fixated on the feeling of Chuuya\u2019s fingers curled in his hair and Chuuya\u2019s mouth pressed against his. Becoming pliant in Chuuya\u2019s grip as if two weeks without any touch more than the gentle hold on Chuuya\u2019s shoulder at night had starved Dazai\u2019s body of something it needs to survive, as if he didn\u2019t go four damn years without so much as a word to the other man.\nIt is difficult to view it as anything other than taking advantage.\nChuuya lost his memories, lost his self of being, his own identity, and put his trust in Dazai, to keep him alive through this. And while Chuuya never explicitly asked, Dazai knows part of that trust is to prevent Chuuya from doing anything that he would regret if he were completely himself.\nEven if Chuuya had instigated it, had been the one to press into the embrace, the fact that Dazai didn\u2019t immediately push him away, didn\u2019t brush it off with a laugh and a joke and switch the topic, the fact that Dazai had pressed into the kiss, was betraying Chuuya\u2019s trust.\nBecause he doesn\u2019t know if it is something Chuuya would have done if the circumstances were different.\nIt isn\u2019t anything Chuuya has ever done before. Then again, neither is staying over at Dazai\u2019s place, eating regular meals with Dazai, calling him in the middle of a mafia operation.\nThey have had a lot of \u2018firsts\u2019 over the course of these two weeks, but all the others were matters of necessity, to keep Chuuya safe until someone has a stroke of luck when it comes to finding whoever did this to him.\nDespite how much he wants to rationalize, to pretend that it is something Chuuya might have done, Dazai suspects, deep down, that it isn\u2019t true. It is only over the last six months that their relationship has morphed into anything more than tossed insults and forced collaborations on missions. It was only four months ago when Chuuya finally took him up on one of his half-joking propositions and followed Dazai to his apartment after one such mission, and that had been nothing more than a rush of heat and the need for any warm body at all\u2014the fact that it was the two of them, after everything they had been through, was coincidence. It was only within the last two months that it became something regular, something more than a matter of convenience but so much less than what it had had the potential to be before Dazai had walked away from the Port Mafia so many years ago.\nIt was only one month before this all happened that Dazai let himself even entertain the possibility of something more than semi-regular fucks, that Chuuya\u2019s touches and kisses had softened, lost their harsh edge for something mimicking at tenderness, that Chuuya had actually started replying to his random texts instead of ignoring them, that (every now and then), Chuuya had answered Dazai\u2019s phone calls and entertained Dazai\u2019s baseless rambling for increasingly longer periods of times before hanging up on him.\nWhatever all that has been building up to, it certainly wouldn\u2019t have happened so quickly, not the way it did tonight. And if\u2014when\u2014Chuuya gets his memories back Dazai has no doubt that tonight will have ruined whatever might have happened between them in the future. Because Chuuya had kissed him out of curiosity, out of a sort of desperation for answers that Dazai still couldn\u2019t bring himself to provide, and they both know it.\nAnd Chuuya will know it when his memories are back, will recognize that Dazai also knew why the moment was wrong, will know that Dazai let it happen, and, if Dazai is lucky, Chuuya will go back to tossed insults when they\u2019re forced to working together without so much of a mention of why he cut contact entirely.\nIt has taken so long for them to slowly open back up to each other and he doubts Chuuya, his Chuuya, will be all that surprised that Dazai managed to fuck it up in one night.\n\u201cRather late for you to be wandering the streets, Dazai-kun.\u201d\nThe voice comes from his left and Dazai stops walking, eyes fluttering closed for a moment as if the split-second of ignoring his surroundings will fortify him for a conversation he is in no mental state to have. He opens his eyes again the next moment and turns to face the woman standing under the awning of a closed bakery, a genial smile that they both know to be false stretching on his lips.\n\u201cI had wondered how long it would take until you couldn\u2019t stay away any longer,\u201d Dazai replies, taking in Kouyou\u2019s appearance and quickly concluding that she didn\u2019t seek him out to kill him. With that out of the way, he glances back down the direction he came, wondering if he can pick out the tail he somehow missed. \u201cI knew Mori had people watching me but I didn\u2019t anticipate you being so invested in my movements as of late.\u201d\n\u201cYou know that my interest is in Chuuya and his safety. You merely injected yourself into the equation and you could easily take yourself out of it.\u201d\nHis smile grows a touch wider, \u201cI didn\u2019t inject myself in, my presence was requested, by Chuuya. He has also made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want me removing myself from the matter until it is resolved. If that hurt your feelings, it truly is regrettable, Kouyou-nee, but there is nothing for me to do about it.\u201d Irritation flickers across her face at that, as he knew it would, and Dazai continues, \u201cSo, why seek me out now?\u201d\nKouyou taps a finger on the stem of her umbrella, her face unreadable as she says, \u201cStop stalling.\u201d\n\u201cStalling?\u201d Dazai repeats, quirking an eyebrow.\n\u201cIf you truly wanted it, you would have already located the ability user behind this and nullified his gift. You may be of the opinion that the boss\u2019 three-week deadline gives you permission to drag your feet but, I assure you, that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nThe smile drops from Dazai\u2019s face as if wiped clean, and he narrows his eyes. \u201cAs flattering as your confidence in my abilities is, it is the Port Mafia that holds most of the information regarding how this may have happened to Chuuya and your organization has not been entirely forthcoming with it. Not to mention leaving Chuuya alone for too long-\u201d\n\u201cSave your breath,\u201d Kouyou cuts him off and Dazai forces his face to stay calm even as he feels a faint twinge of surprise at the ice in the mafia executive\u2019s voice. Their relationship has never been particularly amicable. They play at being agreeable with each other, converse in words full of overly polite language to mask the mutual distaste they have for each other. It is rare for that facade to slip, even when they are alone, but he feels it splintering in Kouyou now. \u201cIf you were so concerned about Chuuya being alone you wouldn\u2019t be out here, you would be with him. Clearly, you\u2019ve concluded that there isn\u2019t that much of a risk of Corruption being unleashed as you made it seem.\u201d\nDazai doesn\u2019t have the patience for this.\nHis head is still swirling with too many emotions and he hadn\u2019t sorted through the tangle nearly as well as he needs to in order to face Chuuya in the morning and pretend like everything is fine. Dropping all traces of his own facade, he gives Kouyou a cool glare. \u201cIf I could have Chuuya back to normal by now, I would. Whether you believe me or not is your problem, but it is the truth. If you\u2019ll excuse me, Kouyou-nee, I was utilizing the quiet night to think through possible plans to fix this situation and the longer you delay me here for your lectures the longer it will take me to fix him.\u201d\nFor a breath, Dazai thinks he pushed her too far.\nA murderous glint flickers through red eyes and the hand on her umbrella tightens briefly. Then, as if the conversation never happened, Kouyou relaxes completely and a pleasant smile is on her face as she dips her head. \u201cMy apologies for keeping you, Dazai-kun. Enjoy the rest of your walk.\u201d\nTurning his back on Kouyou is always dangerous. Even if her ability is useless against him, her own speed with her katana is nothing to laugh at. Turning his back on Kouyou after provoking her as he did is almost suicidal, and he vaguely wonders if it means he is breaking the promise he gave Chuuya the first night of this mess even as he walks away from the mafia executive. As long as she doesn\u2019t kill him, he supposes it doesn\u2019t matter and Chuuya doesn\u2019t need to know.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuuya hasn\u2019t said a word to him all day.\nUnder normal circumstances, that wouldn\u2019t be anything unusual. Dazai is used to going days, even weeks, without exchanging so much as a passing text with the hat rack, but these aren\u2019t normal circumstances. Ignoring his work, Dazai leans back in his seat and stares absently at the ceiling, trying to figure out what he did between last night and this morning to piss Chuuya off enough to receive such a steady (and admirably committed) display of the silent treatment.\u00a0\nThe only thing that happened was the kiss, but Dazai can\u2019t fathom Chuuya being mad at him for that since Chuuya was the one who instigated. It would only make sense for Chuuya to be mad at him for that if Chuuya\u2019s memories were back, but they aren\u2019t, he\u2019s positive. For one thing, if they were back, Chuuya wouldn\u2019t be here, wouldn\u2019t be diligently helping Kyouka with a few harmless reports with a work ethic that no doubt is making Kunikida wish that Chuuya was the one who deserted the Port Mafia instead of Dazai. On top of that, Dazai can still see the lack of memories in Chuuya\u2019s eyes, can still see the pieces of the Chuuya he knows so well are missing whenever they make eye contact.\nSo, no memories, so no reason to be mad at Dazai for a kiss.\nBut that\u2019s the only thing that was different about yesterday. Twirling a pen around his fingers, Dazai walks back everything that happened over the last twenty-four hours. Even if Chuuya tends to be temperamental with him, Chuuya\u2019s mood shifts are never without some sort of cause, something that Dazai can pinpoint (usually within seconds).\nDid someone from the mafia contact Chuuya? Unlikely, Chuuya would have told Dazai about it in an attempt to mine for more information.\nDid Dazai do something that made Chuuya mad? He can\u2019t think of anything that he did differently yesterday. He did push Chuuya away but Chuuya hadn\u2019t shown any indication of that bothering him. In fact, Chuuya\u2019s thoughts were already somewhere else, his attention not even on Dazai as he worked through the new memories that flickered through his head.\nAnd Chuuya had mentioned getting snippets about Dazai. It is possible that the snippets Chuuya got were all bad, memories of their fights or the times when they had genuinely been trying to hurt each other. But, if that was the case, Chuuya would have gotten mad at him then and there, not twelve hours after the memories came back, the next morning.\nWas it something Dazai didn\u2019t do?\nWhile he had (somewhat) broken his promise to Chuuya about reigning in his suicidal tendencies, there was no way Chuuya would know about Dazai\u2019s conversation with Kouyou, much less know why exposing his back to Kouyou may have counted as breaking that promise. And Dazai has followed the promise to the letter since making it, hasn\u2019t tossed himself in any rivers and has (regrettably) walked past almost a dozen of structures that would have been perfect for hanging himself.\nEverything else had been perfectly in-line with the routine they have tumbled into since the first time Dazai brought Chuuya to the agency\u2019s office. The only thing Dazai had done yesterday that was unusual compared to the last two weeks was his walk in the middle of the night, but Chuuya had been asleep when he left and when he came back, it wasn\u2019t like Dazai had missed anything while he was gone, it wasn\u2019t like-\nHis thoughts screech to a halt.\n\nOh. \n\nThe nightmares.\nHe hadn\u2019t been there for Chuuya\u2019s nightmare.\nIt hadn\u2019t happened before he left for the walk and it hadn\u2019t happened after his walk. Dazai had originally just chalked it up to Chuuya finally getting a peaceful night of sleep which, in hindsight, was a stupid assumption for him to make. After fourteen straight days of having a nightmare every single night, it made more sense for Dazai to have been gone during the episode than for it to have never happened. And Chuuya definitely has more than fourteen nights\u2019 worth of horrible memories for his subconscious to draw from.\nIt is the only thing that makes sense.\nLast night, when Chuuya had woken in the middle of the night, mind full of whatever horrible thing he had dreamed about, the terror still flowing through his veins, Dazai hadn\u2019t been there and Chuuya was angry about it.\nDragging his gaze away from the ceiling, Dazai studies Chuuya, wondering if there is a way for him to fix this quickly, before Chuuya does something rash like agreeing to stay with someone with the mafia instead. Outright apologizing probably won\u2019t work because, even like this, Chuuya hates showing weakness and has apparently decided that any kind of emotional attachment to Dazai falls under that category. Making sure he is there tonight might do the trick, if Chuuya even lets Dazai come close enough to touch him.\nHis phone vibrates on his desk and Dazai absently reaches out and answers, \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve located the ability user,\u201d Hirotsu\u2019s voice is even through the phone, as if he isn\u2019t giving Dazai the news he has been wanting for days with the worst possible timing for the continued tranquility of his and Chuuya\u2019s relationship. \u201cHe is currently in an area too risky to send an operation in but we will be tailing him throughout the day.\u201d\nSitting upright in his seat, Dazai half-turns, dropping his voice so it can\u2019t be heard across the room (from Kyouka\u2019s desk). \u201cAnd does Mori plan to have him killed or are you calling me for my assistance?\u201d\n\u201cAlthough killing him would be the simplest solution, the likelihood that he possess information relevant to the operation Chuuya-san was originally leading earlier this month is high. If you would be willing to make yourself available to bring him in alive, the boss has indicated that he would be willing to repay the favor at a later date.\u201d\nHaving the boss of the Port Mafia owe him a debt isn\u2019t anything to be laughed at, it makes it almost impossible for Dazai to even entertain saying no. \u201cIs there a time-frame for this operation?\u201d\n\u201cIt will go live tonight.\u201d\nDazai scowls briefly, wondering if that means he\u2019ll be gone during Chuuya\u2019s nightmare this evening as well. Though, by getting his hands on the ability user he should also get rid of Chuuya\u2019s amnesia, which means the nightmares will be the smallest thing Chuuya will have to deal with. Glancing back over at Chuuya, he\u2019s surprised to meet blue eyes, Chuuya\u2019s narrowed as if he can tell exactly what Dazai is talking about.\nNot dropping Chuuya\u2019s gaze, Dazai says, \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable. Send me the coordinates when you are ready for my assistance.\u201d\nHe hangs up and tosses his phone back on his desk, tearing his eyes away from Chuuya\u2019s stare and letting them fall on the paperwork he hasn\u2019t touched all day. Readjusting his hold on the pen, he begins working through it with a diligence that he knows the others in the office will no doubt find shocking. But the monotony of the paperwork\u2014hellish at all other times\u2014is soothing right now, the mind-numbing task allowing him to almost forget about everything that Hirotsu\u2019s call implies.\nTonight, this will all be over.\nChuuya will be Chuuya again which means he\u2019ll go back to living in his much more extravagant apartment, go back to his awful fashion sense, go back to being the picture-perfect mafia executive. That is straightforward, and Dazai has always anticipated it happening sooner rather than later. While he had forced himself to entertain the possibility of Chuuya\u2019s memories never coming back, he had never seriously believed that would happen. With the Port Mafia\u2019s attention focused on finding whoever was responsible for Chuuya\u2019s amnesia,\u00a0 the likelihood of that person escaping was slim, at best.\nWhat Dazai is less sure about, and doesn\u2019t want to dwell on, is what that will mean for the two of them. At best, he supposes, Chuuya will pretend the last two weeks never happened and they will go back to the odd dance of being more than rivals and partners but less than being in any kind of steady relationship. At worst, Chuuya will be angry about how the previous day went and put more distance between them than there has been in half a year.\nHe can\u2019t decide which outcome he finds more likely, doesn\u2019t particularly want to make a prediction.\nSo, instead, he works, tuning out the rest of the office as he makes his way through the stack on the corner of his desk, ignoring the odd looks he receives from Kunikida and Atsushi, and not bothering to glance at Chuuya again until the day is over and it is time for them to leave the office.\nAs they make their way out of the office, Dazai can feel Chuuya sizing him up, no doubt weighing his desire to keep being mad at Dazai against his curiosity. It takes five minutes for Chuuya to cave.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nDazai glances over at him, quirking an eyebrow without opening his mouth.\nChuuya scowls, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about, Dazai. You\u2019ve been acting weird today.\u201d\n\u201cI assumed Chuuya was too busy being mad at me to notice,\u201d the response slips out habitually, the usual sharp-edged banter between them is something Dazai has tried to hold back on for the sake of not confusing Chuuya further.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to faze Chuuya now because his scowl deepens, \u201cIf something is going on that concerns me and this damn amnesia, just tell me without being deliberately obtuse about it. If not, just leave it, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nLetting out a huff of air, Dazai admits, \u201cThey found the ability user. Once they have him cornered they\u2019ll call me so I can nullify it. By this time tomorrow, you should have all your memories back.\u201d\nChuuya doesn\u2019t react, not right away, not like Dazai expected he might. And in the silence that falls, Dazai tears himself out of his own thoughts long enough to look over at Chuuya. Chuuya\u2019s eyebrows have drawn down slightly, making the burrow that is typical of occasions when Chuuya is working through something that bothers him.\nWhen Chuuya finally does speak, he says, \u201cThat\u2019s short notice.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you would be ecstatic about it,\u201d Dazai replies.\n\u201cThe man everyone sees when they look at me, Nakahara Chuuya, isn\u2019t here, he hasn\u2019t been here for two weeks, hasn\u2019t existed. Once he comes back, this me will basically die. It\u2019s just sudden.\u201d\nPausing outside the door to his apartment, Dazai searches Chuuya\u2019s face, realization dawning, \u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you want to go back to who you used to be.\u201d\n\u201cWho chooses a life like that?\u201d Chuuya asks, voice flat. \u201cAll I can really remember are the nightmares I keep having but those are all things that guy did, that\u2019s the kind of life he has, surrounded by death and destruction all the time and being ripped apart from the inside to use some power that is evidently strong enough to destroy entire organizations.\u201d\nLooking away, Dazai unlocks his door and steps inside, aware that Chuuya follows behind him and locks the door after himself. They make their way into the apartment in silence, toeing off their shoes and disposing of jackets as Dazai turns Chuuya\u2019s words over in his head. He had never considered the idea that Chuuya would be apprehensive about returning to his old life, because he knows Chuuya can handle himself in the Port Mafia, can take whatever is thrown at him in his stride, but this Chuuya doesn\u2019t know that. All this Chuuya really knows is what little he has been able to pry out of people and the terror of his nightmares.\nEventually, Dazai replies, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, you always are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine right now. That Chuuya is always alone.\u201d\n\u201cAlone?\u201d Dazai repeats, slightly bewildered. Chuuya is, and has always been, well-liked wherever he goes. It\u2019s just simple charisma that makes him popular among his subordinates and fellows. Any given night, Chuuya can call up a dozen people to go to dinner with or have drinks alongside.\nRolling his eyes, Chuuya mutters, \u201cNo wonder our relationship is such a mess if you\u2019re oblivious like this all the time. You were the one who said you know me better than anyone else alive.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nHe does, he knows he does.\nSo why is he being completely blindsided by this conversation?\n\u201cAnd if no one else knows me nearly as well as you do, and you fucking left me to fend for myself, how the hell was I supposed to open up to other people like that again? Nakahara Chuuya might have friends or people who rely on him or whatever the fuck everyone wants my memories to come back for but that kind of a connection isn\u2019t meaningful.\u201d\nDazai opens his mouth to reply and\u2026hesitates.\nUsually, he knows exactly what to say to Chuuya and exactly when to say it to get the effect he wants. But he doesn\u2019t know what he wants out of Chuuya right now, doesn\u2019t know if convincing Chuuya that having his memories back is what he actually wants, especially considering Chuuya himself isn\u2019t enthused over the idea. He also isn\u2019t quite sure what to do with the information Chuuya just laid out for him, because Chuuya figured out that Dazai had left the Port Mafia, had mentioned as much yesterday, but he hadn\u2019t said it like this.\nThis tone hadn\u2019t been in Chuuya\u2019s words over the topic of Dazai leaving the mafia yesterday.\nAnd this tone is the one he is used to hearing from Chuuya, the barely even one that is obviously hiding some number of emotions even if those emotions are never allowed to leak through.\nThis tone isn\u2019t a matter of Chuuya piecing something together but of Chuuya remembering, and it all adds up, why Chuuya was so mad at him today. Chuuya must have dreamed about when Dazai had left the Port Mafia and, when Chuuya woke up, Dazai had been gone once again.\nNot reacting is difficult, keeping his face calm is a fight that he isn\u2019t sure he wins because something flashes in Chuuya\u2019s gaze.\nKeeping his voice deliberately light so that Chuuya can take it as honesty or a joke at his own discretion, Dazai says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone, Chuuya. When your other memories come back, you won\u2019t forget these ones.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Chuuya prompts, voice still inflectionless.\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t leave for good because I came for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Dazai asks. \u201cAll you did was call and I was there because I\u2019m still your partner, even if I\u2019m not in the Port Mafia. You don\u2019t have to keep me at arm\u2019s length anymore.\u201d\n\u201cHow am I supposed to believe you?\u201d\nDazai shrugs, \u201cEither you do or you don\u2019t, but I\u2019ve been here with you throughout this, I can be there for you when you\u2019re back to being a mafia executive.\u201d\nHis phone vibrates in his pocket and he digs the device out, glancing at the message from Hirotsu. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue. Do you want me to do this or not?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter what I want? The rest of Yokohama seems to have made the decision already.\u201d\n\u201cBut they can\u2019t nullify the ability without me, and I\u2019m leaving it up to you, Chuuya.\u201d\nChuuya drops his gaze, staring across the room to look at nothing, his thoughts unclear on his face as the seconds tick by into minutes. And then, so softly that Dazai might have missed it, Chuuya says, \u201cJust go.\u201d\nAnd Dazai does.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Dazai arrives on the scene, the ability user is holed up in a seedy motel room, obviously aware that something is going on, that someone is after him. He doesn\u2019t pay any attention to the low-level subordinates he walks past, only spares a brief wave to Gin who nods in greeting, and comes to a stop next to Hirotsu, eying the building in front of them.\n\u201cWho am I looking for?\u201d he asks without preamble.\n\u201cA foreigner,\u201d Hirotsu explains, \u201cBritish and sickly, looks like he\u2019ll collapse at any second.\u201d\nQuirking an eyebrow, Dazai glances around him at the might of a full Black Lizard assault. \u201cIf he\u2019s so sickly are all the bells and whistles necessary?\u201d\n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019ll collapse, he isn\u2019t anywhere near as fragile as he looks. And the last time we tried to handle this group with a soft touch we ended up losing an executive.\u201d\n\u201cTemporarily,\u201d Dazai points out, turning his gaze back to the motel, squinting at the room in question where he thinks he can see movement behind the curtains.\n\u201cEven temporarily, it is nothing to be taken lightly, and it\u2019s likely he has more associates we haven\u2019t identified. Chuuya-san was injured that night, whoever was able to do that may be nearby.\u201d\nNodding in acknowledgment of Hirotsu\u2019s points, Dazai waves Gin and Tachihara forward, holding out an expectant hand to the latter. Tachihara\u2019s face doesn\u2019t so much as twitch in irritation over Dazai\u2019s silent order (even if Dazai can feel said irritation rolling off the younger man) as he reaches into the flap of his coat and pulls out a handgun, placing it in Dazai\u2019s waiting palm. Considering the weight of the weapon, Dazai forces any and all thoughts about Chuuya\u2019s reservations about this out of his mind and rattles off a few orders.\nDespite the fact that he is, technically, supposed to just be support for this mission, meant to just wait for an opportunity to nullify their target\u2019s ability, the people around him immediately follow his commands, no doubt told by their boss to do just that because Mori anticipated how this evening would go. It sends a slight spark of annoyance through him that he\u2019s playing into Mori\u2019s predictions, but this is the quickest way to get this ordeal over with and the best way to guarantee nothing goes wrong.\nWhen everything is in place, Dazai nods at Hirotsu, who gives the order to attack. The door to the motel room in question is burst off of its hinges as a group of mafia members situates themselves at the fire exit, preventing their prey from making an escape. More mafia members establish a perimeter, searching for any possible reinforcements as Dazai strides forward, Hirotsu at his heel.\nStepping inside the motel room, he casts his eyes around, taking in the papers splayed on the desk and the open suitcase on the bed before turning his gaze to the only other door inside. With an almost lazy aim, he shoots the lock of the door and waves Tachihara and Gin forward. They rush around him and into what must be the bathroom.\nA muffled shout and the sounds of a few well-placed punches later, they are dragging a man who meets Hirotsu\u2019s earlier description out of the bathroom and into the main room of the motel. Dazai doesn\u2019t much care about the ability user, who he is or who he works for is Mori\u2019s problem. He briefly takes in skin so pale it\u2019s nearly translucent, gaunt cheeks and sunken eyes\u2014the man looks like he is on the verge of death\u2014before taking in a sight that is much more fascinating.\nNamely, the way an ugly red rash is rapidly spreading up the necks, across the faces, and down the arms of Tachihara and Gin. The pair look, for all the world, like they contracted smallpox between when they entered the bathroom and left. Tachihara is even swaying on his feet as if dizzy, and sweat is glistening on Gin\u2019s forehead in a way disproportionate to how little work she had to do to reach their target, as if she has a fever.\nStepping forward, Dazai taps the man\u2019s cheek in a patronizing way. The room glows with the blue light of his ability and the rashes on Tachihara and Gin vanish in the same breath.\nTurning his back on the ability user, he catches Hirotsu\u2019s gaze, \u201cUnless you want the entire Port Mafia to catch the plague or something equally ridiculous I\u2019d recommend not letting anyone come into skin-on-skin contact with him.\u201d\nHirotsu nods thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it. Thank you for your assistance, Dazai-san.\u201d\nSetting the borrowed gun on the motel\u2019s cheap bed, Dazai strides out of the room, leaving Hirotsu to handle the cleanup and transportation of the ability user.\nHe doesn\u2019t run, but Dazai\u2019s steps are noticeably quick as he sets off down the street and toward his apartment. He half expects to get a phone call or a text from Chuuya, letting him know that the amnesia is gone and telling him to piss off.\nNeither arrives and when Dazai finally gets back to his place almost twenty minutes after nullifying the man\u2019s ability, he finds himself holding his breath as he unlocks and opens the door.\nHe steps inside, mouth opening to call for Chuuya before the name dies on his lips.\nHis apartment is empty.\nChuuya is gone.\nThere isn\u2019t so much as a note to indicate that Chuuya is okay but Dazai thinks he knows exactly what message to take in the silence of the flat. Closing the door firmly behind him, Dazai tells himself that at least this means Chuuya\u2019s amnesia is gone, that his memories are back and the universe is just a little more the way it is supposed to be.\nHe\u2019ll have to be content with that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the next week, there really isn\u2019t much to indicate Chuuya\u2019s return to the Port Mafia. In fact, there isn\u2019t much activity from the Port Mafia at all, at least nothing flashy or obvious or outside their normal mode of operations. Dazai himself can only notice Chuuya\u2019s return to the mafia in little things, like the tails that had been following them to the Agency vanishing overnight and the unsigned thank you note that appears on his desk two days later, in a handwriting he wishes didn\u2019t still make his gut turn, that he burns the moment he sets eyes on it.\nStill, he doesn\u2019t get so much as a text or a call from Chuuya, which seems to answer Dazai\u2019s question of how the events of the last two week would impact the slowly morphing relationship between the two of them.\nHe goes about work as usual, slacks off as usual, ignores Kunikida\u2019s lectures as usual, and tries to forget how much more comfortable his apartment had been when he wasn\u2019t alone all the time.\nHe doesn\u2019t dwell on what Chuuya had said about being lonely, about how unwilling to open up to other people Chuuya had been after Dazai left the Port Mafia, doesn\u2019t dwell on how visibly upset Chuuya had been that first night at the very idea of Dazai dying prematurely (such a stark change from the dismissive way Chuuya always handled the matter that it had almost shocked Dazai into stillness).\nWhen he walks home from work six days after nullifying that man\u2019s ability, he ignores the part of him that thinks the walk is too solitary without Chuuya keeping step with him.\nWhen he slides his lock into the door, turns it, and realizes his door is already unlocked, he doesn\u2019t even dare to entertain the possibility that Chuuya is the one who broke into his apartment.\nBut Chuuya is the one who broke into his apartment, and he\u2019s standing in the middle of the main room, back in his ridiculous wardrobe, ugly hat on top of red hair, hands shoved in his pocket, his gaze steady on Dazai as Dazai closes the door and steps further inside. Chuuya\u2019s expression is unreadable, his eyes guarded in a way they hadn\u2019t been around Dazai during his amnesic bout but that tells Dazai more than anything else could that all of Chuuya\u2019s memories are back.\nShoving his own hands in his pockets, he walks forward until he is just out of reach and stops, waiting.\nChuuya stares at him for just a second longer before letting out a huff of exasperation and glancing away, \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I was as terrified as I was when I woke up in that goddamn crater and didn\u2019t even know my own name.\u201d Dazai tilts his head, surprised at where Chuuya starts (having expected to be verbally chewed out instead), but he listens carefully, hanging onto Chuuya\u2019s every word. \u201cI was terrified and in the middle of the fight and didn\u2019t know anything that was going on and I scrolled through four other conversations with people who I could have asked for help but I was afraid they would use my amnesia, use me, for whatever their goals were. You were the only person I thought about calling and I didn\u2019t even know who the fuck you were.\u201d\nFrowning slightly, Dazai tries to figure out where this is going, unable to come up with anything other than the conclusion he had assumed was impossible when he had returned to an empty apartment.\n\u201cAnd you, you idiot, dropped whatever the hell you were doing to come toward a mafia conflict and then pluck an amnesic executive right from underneath the mafia\u2019s noses like that wouldn\u2019t make every other executive and the boss furious with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I spoke with Mori he didn\u2019t seem that upset,\u201d Dazai comments.\n\u201cHe had time to cool off. According to Ane-san he was livid the mafia didn\u2019t keep track of me before you got there,\u201d Chuuya explains, gaze flicking back to meet Dazai\u2019s only this time it\u2019s less guarded, it\u2019s searching, as if Chuuya already asked a question that Dazai missed and is looking for the answer, \u201cand I heard about how often they tried to talk you into letting me stay with someone else and how you wouldn\u2019t budge even after it was obvious Corruption wouldn\u2019t just activate randomly.\u201d\nChuuya pauses, as if waiting for Dazai to say something. He doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t even open his mouth, because he hasn\u2019t gotten the whole picture, he can sense that there is more Chuuya wants to lay out between them and he wasn\u2019t prepared to have this conversation today, much less right now.\nTaking his silence for what it is, Chuuya continues, \u201cWould you really not have nullified the ability if I had told you not to?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cKouyou would have been after your neck, Mori probably would have been too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nDazai shrugs, \u201cBecause it should have been your choice, and if you didn\u2019t want to remember the shit you\u2019ve been through then I wasn\u2019t going to force you to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then what? Keep me with you and have me join the agency and pretend like the Port Mafia wouldn\u2019t just kill the ability user to get me back?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it through that far,\u201d Dazai admits, \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered the fact that you might not have wanted your memories back. But I told you that I would have helped you relocate, and I would have. It wasn\u2019t about a strategy or anything, Chuuya.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it about, then?\u201d Chuuya challenges.\nDazai has asked himself the same question more than once over the past week and the answer comes out easily. \u201cYou looked happier without the memories.\u201d\n\u201cI was terrified.\u201d\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Dazai concedes, but doesn\u2019t retract his previous statement, because the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\nChuuya had been scared, the looming reality of forgotten memories, of a forgotten identity, wasn\u2019t something that Chuuya ever really escaped from over those two weeks but he had also been, if not happy at least content with his day-to-day. He got up and walked with Dazai to work, the slight stiffness that sometimes followed Chuuya after too much use of his ability vanishing within a week and his expression clearing slightly with it. The nightmares had been persistent but they rarely kept him awake all night, once they were over he was well-rested and ready to help Kyouka or Yosano or Atsushi with their work without the pressure that comes along with being a mafia executive, a pressure Dazai himself is all too familiar with.\nDazai can\u2019t say whether Chuuya staying without his memories would have been better in the long run or worse, only that it would have lead to a different Chuuya than the one he is used to, but this wasn\u2019t a matter of what Dazai would have preferred. At the end of the day, if Dazai had refused to nullify the ability, it would have been because that was what Chuuya wanted, and that was that.\nBlue eyes are still searching Dazai\u2019s face, still looking for something that Chuuya evidently hasn\u2019t found yet. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me the truth?\u201d\n\u201cAbout?\u201d Dazai prompts because he hadn\u2019t been very upfront with Chuuya about his past regarding much.\n\u201cUs. Our\u2026dynamic, our history.\u201d\nDazai lets out a wry laugh, \u201cSpend hours walking through that mess? Why would I? And how was I supposed to explain it if neither of us knows what it is, to begin with?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I asked if we were sleeping together you could have just said yes, it would have been the truth.\u201d\n\u201cYou might have felt pressured about it, like I was expecting you to see me that way. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\nChuuya frowns, tilting his head slightly as he says, \u201cDidn\u2019t want what? Don\u2019t tell me you thought you would have been\u2026what? Taking advantage of me?\u201d\nThe words, stolen straight from the tip of Dazai\u2019s tongue, hang in the air between them when Dazai doesn\u2019t deny them. Chuuya stares at him, eyes widening just a fraction before he snorts with amusement.\nWhich is\u2026not the reaction Dazai was expecting.\nRolling his eyes, Chuuya steps forward, putting them firmly within touching distance, and reaches out, jabbing a finger at Dazai\u2019s chest. \u201cListen carefully, mackerel, with or without my memories there is no way you would be able to take advantage of me like that. I\u2019d sooner cut your dick off. If anything happened, it would have been because I wanted it to. Got it?\u201d\nDazai smiles, a small genuine expression that he doesn\u2019t wear often. \u201cI almost missed hearing you call me that,\u201d he murmurs instead of answering Chuuya\u2019s question.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you take away from this?\u201d Chuuya asks, sounding exasperated.\n\u201cYou also made your point crystal clear,\u201d Dazai adds, a hint of mischief leaking into his smile at the way Chuuya sounds. At how familiar Chuuya\u2019s tone is and how, at one point, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever hear this particular mixture of exasperation, laced with something he has always hesitated to name, again.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Chuuya says, his hand not withdrawing like he normally would but instead letting it travel up to grip at Dazai\u2019s collar. A slight tug has Dazai leaning forward, not exactly sure what Chuuya wants now as a smile curls onto Chuuya\u2019s lips. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure this is clear too, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said to me that night before you went to handle the ability user and I still haven\u2019t decided whether or not I believe you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t done talking,\u201d Chuuya says, with a pointed look. Dazai quirks an eyebrow and waits. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Chuuya continues, \u201cI haven\u2019t decided if I believe you or if I can trust you or whatever I want out of this, but\u2026your actions have always been more honest than anything that leaves your mouth, and you were there for me during all of this in a way I wouldn\u2019t have anticipated if had I remembered anything about you.\u201d\n\u201cI assume there is a point coming somewhere,\u201d Dazai prods, unable to resist.\nThe point, he finds out in the next breath, is Chuuya\u2019s lips against his, pressing insistently against his mouth with none of the violence or anger or desperation that had characterized their scant kisses before this all started. The point, evidently, is in the way Chuuya licks into his mouth, hand sliding up to grip Dazai\u2019s locks as he steps closer, into the curve of Dazai\u2019s body and doesn\u2019t so much as tense when Dazai brings an arm up to curl around Chuuya\u2019s waist. The point, is in the way that Chuuya\u2019s movements never speed up, how Chuuya never lets go of the deliberate pace that he set at the beginning as they stumble through the apartment and topple onto the couch.\nThe point, Dazai is delighted to learn, is wordlessly spoken in volumes by the way that Chuuya doesn\u2019t immediately stand up and look for his clothes when they collapse against each other in a tangle of limbs gone weak from satisfaction, breath still coming too quickly.\nAnd he has grown used to falling asleep in the same room as Chuuya over the two weeks of this not-quite-disaster but he hasn\u2019t ever had the chance to fall asleep with Chuuya in his arms, to watch up close as Chuuya\u2019s eyelids grow heavy and his breathing starts to even out.\nJust before Chuuya slips off into, what Dazai hopes to be, a restful night of sleep, Dazai mumbles, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back chibi.\u201d\nChuuya\u2019s nose wrinkles slightly and he turns further toward the cushion underneath them. \u201cDon\u2019t get all sentimental, it\u2019s weird coming from you.\u201d\nWith a soft chuckle, Dazai lets his own eyes flutter shut and drifts off to sleep, confident that neither of them will be gone when morning comes around."
