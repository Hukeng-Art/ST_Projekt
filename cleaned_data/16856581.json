    "text": " The World Was Young\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\nThe boy looks up. He\u2019s been wandering by himself for a long time. His stomach aches, and he thinks that his aunt is going to be so angry with him. But he can\u2019t find the way back by himself, he really can\u2019t.\nBending over him is what looks like an ugly person. But the boy is used to his uncle and cousin being ugly, and he just looks at the person\u2019s jagged teeth and narrowed eyes and claws on his hands. He doesn\u2019t flinch when the person reaches out and picks him up. He thinks that maybe they\u2019re going to take him home.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d the person asks him.\nPeople rarely ask the boy questions. He has to think about it before he finally answers, \u201cI went out of the garden.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lost?\u201d\nThe boy nods. That ought to explain it, he thinks, and now the person will take him home.\nBut the person just goes on staring at him, as if lost boys are strange. Then he reaches up and brushes away the boy\u2019s hair. The boy flinches. He\u2019s sure, he\u2019s sure, that any second the person is going to laugh at his scar. His aunt is always telling him how ugly it is. Sometimes the boy thinks he would like it if she didn\u2019t call it ugly, but that never happens.\n\u201cYour name is Harry Potter?\u201d\nThe boy hesitates. \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cYou must know. Human children are old enough by your age to know their names!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean, I just get called boy and freak,\u201d the boy explains, even though he doesn\u2019t like explaining it. \u201cMaybe my name is Harry Potter? I think Aunt Petunia called me Harry once.\u201d\nThe person closes his eyes and mutters to himself in what sounds like another language. The boy listens with interest. \u201cCan I learn that language?\u201d he asks, when the person falls silent and opens his eyes again.\n\u201cListen to me. I called you a human child. Don\u2019t you know what that means?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not human?\u201d\nThe person starts to answer, and then pauses. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d\nThe boy shakes his head. He feels a little hopeful. Maybe he\u2019s found a freak, like him. Maybe the person will take him away to the land where all the freaks live, and then he\u2019ll be with people like him and won\u2019t have to wash the dishes or weed the garden again. \u201cCan I come with you to where your land is?\u201d\nThe person just keeps staring at him. Then he asks, \u201cWhat are your relatives like?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like me. They call me freak. I sleep in a cupboard\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cA cupboard,\u201d the boy repeats, glaring at the person. He can\u2019t tell the truth if the person keeps interrupting! \u201cIt\u2019s under the stairs. My cousin has two bedrooms, but they say I can\u2019t have one. Because I\u2019m a freak.\u201d\nThe person chatters his teeth together sharply. It makes a noise like something dangerous. The boy hopes he can learn to do that, too. Before he can ask the question, the person smiles. \u201cSo they won\u2019t come looking for you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. They don\u2019t know where I am right now.\u201d\nThe person nods and says, \u201cThen you can come with me. There is a land for my kind\u2014we are called goblins\u2014and I think we should have the charge of raising you. Since your guardians have done such a poor one.\u201d He laughs deep down in his chest. The boy thinks the sound is kind of scary, but it makes the goblin\u2019s chest underneath him vibrate pleasantly.\n\u201cOkay. Can I learn your language? Can I chatter my teeth like you do?\u201d\nThe goblin nods and begins to carry him away. The people walking by don\u2019t seem to notice them, the boy realizes. It\u2019s as if they have a magical bubble traveling with them. \u201cYou may need some help with the teeth. But you will receive all the help you need, and more, from my clan.\u201d\n*\n\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\nThe goblin who rescued the boy is called Ripclaw, he has learned. He thinks it\u2019s a wonderful name. He plays next to the desk in the office that Ripclaw has brought him to. They don\u2019t think he\u2019s listening, but he is. The boy learned how to listen when he was young. Sometimes that means he can avoid Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia when they\u2019re in a bad mood, or Dudley when he\u2019s coming with his gang.\n\u201cThe wizards are going to come looking for him.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask him. Potter!\u201d\nThe boy stands up and walks obediently around the desk. They\u2019re underground, he knows that much, from the stone walls and the cool air around them. But the desk really does look exactly like the one in offices he\u2019s sometimes seen on the telly, when Dudley doesn\u2019t notice him standing in the kitchen doorway. It\u2019s huge and made of white rock and has gold lines in it. Another goblin leans down from behind it and stares at him.\n\u201cWhat is a wizard?\u201d the goblin asks.\nThe boy considers it carefully. He hopes this isn\u2019t some kind of test. He\u2019ll probably fail it. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally has to say.\nRipclaw laughs. The goblin behind the desk, who also has gold in his teeth, gives Ripclaw a harsh look that makes the boy step back. He doesn\u2019t want to be in between them if the desk goblin attacks Ripclaw the way Uncle Vernon attacks Harry.\nBut instead, the desk goblin turns back to Harry. \u201cA wizard is a person like you who can do magic.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do magic.\u201d\n\u201cSurely something has happened around you? Something strange that the Muggles couldn\u2019t explain?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know what a Muggle is.\u201d The boy hopes that the desk goblin is calmer than he looks, because otherwise he\u2019s probably going to get tossed out. Then he\u2019ll never get to learn that language or chatter his teeth like Ripclaw.\n\u201cThe Muggles are humans like your aunt and uncle who don\u2019t have any magic.\u201d The desk goblin lowers his hand and rips the side of the desk up with a screeching sound. The boy hopes he can learn to do that, too.\n\u201cOh.\u201d The boy thinks about it. Then he offers, \u201cOnce I got up on the roof of the school without knowing how I did it. Dudley, he\u2019s my cousin, he was chasing me with his friends and I knew they were going to beat me up, and I ran fast, and then the wind tossed me up on the roof of the school.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the wind. That was your magic.\u201d\nThe boy gives that some consideration. Uncle Vernon says there\u2019s no such thing as magic. But then, Uncle Vernon probably thinks there\u2019s no such thing as goblins, too. The boy feels that maybe Uncle Vernon isn\u2019t as smart as he always thought he was.\n\u201cAll right. Then I suppose I\u2019m a wizard?\u201d\n\u201cYes. You are. And famous among them, for surviving a curse that no one else could survive.\u201d Ripclaw leans forwards, and the boy holds still as he traces the zigzag path of the scar on his forehead with one talon. \u201cYou have the most inspired luck. Or perhaps someone did powerful magic to protect you.\u201d\nThe desk goblin says something in the language that the boy wants to learn. Ripclaw answers, and it sounds like they\u2019re arguing. The boy hunches his shoulders a little. He doesn\u2019t like arguments. They always seem to end up with him getting hurt.\n\u201cBut they must know where he is,\u201d the desk goblin finally says in English.\n\u201cI suspect not.\u201d Ripclaw glances at the boy. \u201cI want you to tell Gorgeslitter what you told me. About what your relatives called you and where you sleep.\u201d\n\u201cThey call me freak. I sleep in a cupboard. My cousin beats me up a lot,\u201d the boy adds, because Gorgeslitter\u2019s face is getting dark but the boy is starting to think that he isn\u2019t angry at him. \u201cThey want me to make meals for them. Sometimes I have to do it and sometimes I don\u2019t. They don\u2019t like it when I act like a freak\u2014I mean, use magic.\u201d\nGorgeslitter stands up and leaves the office. The boy glances at Ripclaw. \u201cDo I get to stay?\u201d\n\u201cGorgeslitter needs to check some things.\u201d Ripclaw takes a long knife from somewhere. One minute his hand isn\u2019t holding it, and the next it is. \u201cIn the meantime, why don\u2019t you come here and I\u2019ll show you some of the finer points of using a blade?\u201d\n*\nThe boy thinks he\u2019s getting pretty good at holding the knife and twisting it so that it will cut flesh or fur by the time Gorgeslitter comes back. There are more goblins behind him. The boy holds the knife so that it points at the floor. The first thing Ripclaw told him, besides who made the knife and how old it is, is that you never point it at another goblin unless you\u2019re challenging them.\nThe boy is still determined to be a goblin. It sounds much more interesting than being a wizard.\n\u201cWe have decided,\u201d says Gorgeslitter, motioning at the goblins with one claw. The boy watches them. They wear all sorts of blades, and some carry spears. They have bracelets and collars and rings of metal, too, and some of them have caps. Helmets, the boy thinks that\u2019s the word. \u201cIf the humans do not want him, we will take him in.\u201d\nThe boy whoops and dances around with the knife in his hand, taking care to keep it pointed at the floor. He makes it all the way around, and stops to see Gorgeslitter staring hard at Ripclaw. \u201cWas that necessary?\u201d he asks, pointing at the knife.\n\u201cHe wants to be a goblin. You can\u2019t start him too young.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m already six,\u201d the boy thinks he has to say. \u201cI\u2019m six years behind all the other goblins.\u201d\nThere is a murmur from some of the goblins behind Gorgeslitter, and one that Harry thinks is a woman moves forwards. She has a chain of teeth around her neck and thick bracelets on her wrists. The boy looks at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cToothsplitter,\u201d she says. \u201cI am a smith. Do you know what that is?\u201d\nThe boy shakes his head. Toothsplitter touches him gently on the forehead. \u201cThen I will tell you, as soon as you tell me your name in return. It is very rude in goblin society to offer your name and be scorned.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d The boy flushes. \u201cSorry. My name is\u2014Harry Potter.\u201d When he says it, he says it more confidently than he ever has, and he knows that he is leaving \u201cfreak\u201d and \u201cboy\u201d behind forever.\n\u201cBetter. I make weapons and jewelry and many other things out of metal. Come and see the smithy.\u201d\nToothsplitter takes his hand, and Harry gives the knife back to Ripclaw with a whispered thanks. Or he tries to give it back. Ripclaw steps away and shakes his head. \u201cKeep the knife. Your first knife is always lucky. And you\u2019ll remember old Ripclaw when you\u2019re great and powerful.\u201d\nHarry thinks that\u2019s kind of silly, because he doesn\u2019t want to be great and powerful, he just wants to be a goblin. But he nods and smiles at Ripclaw, and then Toothsplitter takes him through a hole in the wall and down a long tunnel that\u2019s lit by fires. Harry thinks they\u2019re brilliant. They\u2019re not torches on the walls, but fires that dance on the walls. Toothsplitter lets him stop at one point and reach out so that he can touch one.\n\u201cThey\u2019re geodes,\u201d she tells him. \u201cBits of gems that we\u2019ve embedded in the walls, so that they can reflect any sort of faint illumination and fill our lives with light.\u201d\nHarry is learning all sorts of new words today, but not the ones he wants to learn. \u201cHow do you say those things in your language?\u201d\nToothsplitter laughs and tells him. Harry rolls the words around in his mouth like rocks as they go down and down.\nThey finally come to a huge archway that has darkness behind it. No, wait, not darkness. When Harry squints, he can make out red flashes in that darkness. It looks as though something\u2019s on fire in the distance.\n\u201cCome and see,\u201d Toothsplitter says, and she guides him under the archway. There\u2019s a snake with spread wings over it. But Toothsplitter tells him it\u2019s a dragon, and their image brings good luck to smiths, because dragons have the hottest fire.\nThey step into the darkness, and Toothsplitter says something in the goblin language. The darkness suddenly flashes harder and harder, and Harry is looking out into the largest cave he\u2019s ever seen or dreamed of. He can\u2019t even see the walls.\nThere are glowing red fires everywhere, and huge lakes that are silver and gold\u2014Toothsplitter tells him there are actual metals in those lakes, not just water\u2014and goblins walking around with stones and axes and geodes and rings and knives, and hissing steam as water gets poured over the fires, and ringing hammers, and voices singing. Harry isn\u2019t sure about the singing voices at first, but then he listens, and they\u2019re there. He hops up and down in delight.\nThe songs rise and twist back and forth. They\u2019re in the goblin language. Harry wants to know what they say. He wants to know what they say more than he\u2019s ever wanted something in his life. It sounds like the earth itself is singing.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Toothsplitter says softly in English, \u201cto the Realm of Song.\u201d And then she repeats it in the goblin language, so Harry can learn that, too.\n\nMany-Pillared Halls of Stone\n\nHarry grows to maturity in the embrace of the Realm of Song.\nIt sprawls everywhere underground, breathing in the darkness, the deepness, the vents of warm air from the smithies and the lakes of silver and gold that surge back and forth in the deepest caverns. Harry hangs over the edge of red-glowing abysses and stares down, and goblins like Toothsplitter or Gravensword, her burly apprentice, teach him the names of all the stones and the exact shades of light that he can see.\nHe walks through shadows, and learns how to see in them better than in the daylight. In fact, when he comes up sometimes to walk through Diagon Alley in disguise, he has to hide his eyes from the sun. They see so much better in the darkness.\nHe learns how to wield a hammer, although Toothsplitter is an exacting master and keeps stopping him so that she can show him how to grip the shaft better, or aim it at a place in the metal that needs to be beaten smooth, or lecture him about how he can\u2019t just get lost in the blows and all of the tools he makes will need a different strength. Then Harry goes back to using the hammer again, only for her to stop him a minute later and teach him something else.\nBut the day comes when Harry gets through sixty strokes uninterrupted, and Toothsplitter studies the blank of metal and proclaims that it will be a good sword.\nHarry is so happy that night that he nearly bangs his head on the low stone roof above his sleeping quarters, something he hasn\u2019t done since his first night here.\nHe plays tag with the goblin children through the abandoned mines and quarries, always together. Although there are few dangers here coming from gas\u2014which the goblins cleared out long ago\u2014or from the darkness they can all see through, sometimes the mines plunge deep, and wake the Deep Ones.\nHarry learns all the warning signs from the goblin children: the way the earth shakes under your feet in jerks too sharp for it to be an earthquake, how the walls turn purple instead of black or grey, how a sweet smell like nightshade fills your nostrils. Then you run, and run, and never look behind you, until the things that sleep in the deep places of the world go back to that sleep.\nThere\u2019s only one of the children eaten during the time that Harry grows up in the Realm of Song. But the screams of that one, the way that flesh sounds when it\u2019s pulled apart, remain in Harry\u2019s dreams forever.\nHe learns the names of jewels finished and rough, the veins of ore that run through all the tunnels of the joined world, and how to judge at a glance whether a tunnel is supported well enough to run through or not. He learns Gobbledegook, as he wished, and he learns Latin because Toothsplitter says that\u2019s proper for a wizard to know, and he learns knife-fighting because he\u2019s not going to be strong enough to lift a heavy goblin sword even if he\u2019s taller than they are.\nHe learns laws and customs and proper behavior, and exactly how far he can go to break them before someone snarls at him. He wants to file his teeth to points like the bank guards do, but no one will let him. Harry tries to do it himself, but all he does is break a tooth and get a long glare from Blackeye, the chief goblin healer.\nNo one wants to anger Blackeye. Harry meekly submits to her healing and then tosses the file he tried to use back where he found it.\nHe learns maths by counting the coins that pour through his fingers when he and the goblin children sneak into unclaimed or abandoned vaults. He learns natural history with dragons and underground plants. He learns history from the legends of the Deep Ones and the goblins\u2019 side of the wars\u2014which are always started by something stupid the Ministry does because they don\u2019t understand goblins. Harry has to shake his head when he hears the tale of how the Eighth One started. Imagine, not letting a goblin with an iron knot on his sword take the first seat at the table. Harry doesn\u2019t understand how wizards can be so stupid.\nSometimes, he despairs that he was born human.\nOn the other hand, the goblins teach him magic, too, and Harry can learn both goblin and wizard magic. Goblin magic involves speaking to things. The first time he asks the fire in the forge to reach his desired temperature instead of building it up with a bellows, Harry laughs with exhilaration, and not just because his arms and shoulders are going to thank him for this later.\nHe spoke, and the fire listened! It\u2019s wonderful.\nThere are always things that he can speak to, Harry finds. Swords listen when he asks them to sharpen themselves, and they might do it or they might not, but they hear him. The walls throb with the voices of metals and rock, the voices of the earth, older than anything else. The water sings to Harry as he walks through the darkest places, and once a river asks him to help turn its course, because it wants to run through a deeper bed and rejoin a current that it can hear on the other side of a wall. It takes Harry several days and wizard spells to blow up the wall and let the waters flow together, but he manages it.\nAnd the water sings its thanks, and Harry smiles at it.\nWizard magic is fun, too, juggling light and calling fire and opening locked doors and summoning objects, but when Harry asks what wizards talk to, Gorgeslitter shakes his head.\n\u201cThey talk to themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes us and centaurs, or merfolk if they know Mermish. But even then, they don\u2019t listen.\u201d\nHarry stares at him, appalled. \u201cBut\u2014they have to be able to hear.\u201d\n\u201cHearing is different from listening.\u201d\nHarry nods, chastened. He learned that as his very first lesson. \u201cBut really? They don\u2019t even listen to us\u2014I mean, you?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that we have anything valuable to say.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Ripclaw found me.\u201d\nThey\u2019re in one of the offices at the bank, covered with a vulgar display of marble and gold to impress the wizards. In truth, Harry knows the marble would like to return to the quarry and the gold would like to be running free in one of the molten lakes. It\u2019s a depressing place with all the yearning voices he can\u2019t answer.\nGorgeslitter smiles at him. \u201cSo are we, young amaraczh.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the name they call him when they don\u2019t use his wizard name, a combination word that means \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cspeaker.\u201d Harry beams. He knows they\u2019ll never call any of the stubbornly deaf wizards that.\n\nThe Light of Sun and Star and Moon\n\nAs Harry grows older and towards the time that he\u2019ll need to go to Hogwarts, the goblins start to insist that he spend more time outside the Realm of Song and walking the streets of Diagon Alley and other wizard enclaves that spread around the goblin banks. \u201cYou need to practice English,\u201d Gorgeslitter tells him as he guides him around the wizarding section of Paris. He has an illusion on to look like a wizard so no one will rudely gape at him. \u201cYour Gobbledegook is sounding more and more like your native language now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? And I can\u2019t practice English here anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThere are wizards here who speak English.\u201d\nHarry sulks, but Gorgeslitter is firm, and Harry has learned that he won\u2019t get away with anything when a goblin looks like that. Grudgingly, he spends more time speaking English, and he spends more time casting spells, and he learns to ignore the voices of wood and stone and water weeping when wizards won\u2019t listen to them.\nBut he does nearly rebel on the day that Gorgeslitter takes him to Ollivander\u2019s wand shop.\n\u201cDo I really need a wand? I function fine without it,\u201d he grumbles in Gobbledegook as Gorgeslitter guides him firmly into the shop.\n\u201cNot fine in the way that other wizards will want to see,\u201d Gorgeslitter answers.\nHarry nods glumly. He has learned that presenting a secretive front to wizards, conforming to what they expect to see, is important. The goblins could win a war with the wizards if they called upon all the resources of the Realm of Song, but no one wants to do that. Exposing those secrets? Having wizards know about the lakes of metal and the Deep Ones and the secrets of forging and crafting? It would be terrible.\nSo Harry puts his chin up and puts on what he thinks of as his \u201cwizard smile,\u201d one calculated to make everyone think that he\u2019s nice and simple, and marches into Ollivander\u2019s shop. Gorgeslitter stays outside. Harry wishes he could, too, that he had a goblin body as well as a goblin soul, but needs must.\nThe old man who comes out of the back of the shop to stare at him is at least interesting, with magic writhing around him and his head cocked as if he hears the wands speaking in their boxes. Harry bows his head a little and makes sure he\u2019s speaking in English when he says, \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Harry Potter. I\u2019ve come for my wand?\u201d\n\u201cYou are Harry Potter. But you haven\u2019t come for your wand.\u201d\nStartled, Harry lifts his head. \u201cBut I need it to be a wizard!\u201d\n\u201cYou are here because the goblins made you come.\u201d\nHarry narrows his eyes. His hand rests on the knife that Ripclaw gave him, although he hopes that it just looks like he\u2019s resting his hand on his hip like a prissy little wizard. He whines, \u201cBut I need a wand! Even if the goblins made me come, why can\u2019t you give me a wand?\u201d\n\u201cI only sell my wands to those they\u2019re meant to bond with, Mr. Potter. After you spent so many years in the Realm of Song, there is nothing for you here.\u201d\nHarry tilts his head to the side, ignoring the wizard for a moment, while his mind drifts among the boxes and listens to the voices of wood and hair and\u2014many other things. Then he looks up and blinks. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, sir. There\u2019s a wand here that wants to bond with me. Don\u2019t you talk to them when they speak?\u201d\nOllivander\u2019s mouth falls open a little. Then he turns and gestures at the boxes. \u201cTell me which one it is, if you can hear them.\u201d\n\u201cNot just hear, listen,\u201d Harry corrects him. He\u2019s always liked that distinction. He makes his way along the shelves, listening harder when he hears the murmur ahead of him become sharper and more excited. Then he reaches out, and his fingers brush the edge of the right box. He laughs aloud as the box actually splits apart so the wand can leap into his hand.\nIt\u2019s such a pretty wand! The holly wood gleams, and Harry can\u2019t help but pet the side of it where he can see a slight knot in the wood. And the core is phoenix feather. It sings to him with an echo of the bird it comes from. Harry thinks it\u2019s ghalimart, and he never uses that word for anything but some goblin magic.\nHe turns around to find Ollivander squinting at him. \u201cCan it be?\u201d he murmurs to himself. \u201cCan you really be a goblin-trained wizard who has retained wizard magic?\u201d\n\u201cThey always taught me wizard magic,\u201d Harry corrects him. But he does it gently, because so many wizards don\u2019t know a thing about goblins. It\u2019s not their fault, the poor stupid things. \u201cHere are the Galleons, sir.\u201d\nOllivander takes the Galleons slowly, moving as if he wants to drop them. Harry can ignore the sad chirping voices of the coins well enough. They\u2019re so changed from what they used to be that they don\u2019t retain much more than a dream of living free in lakes.\n\u201cI think you are going to change the wizarding world, Mr. Potter,\u201d Ollivander says as Harry steps out the door.\nHarry throws a startled look over his shoulder, but shakes his head and keeps walking. He can\u2019t change it by himself. That would require wizards to start listening to goblins and walls and floors and all the rest, and he doesn\u2019t think they ever will.\n*\n\u201cThis is the train that you must depart on.\u201d\nHarry sighs and stares at the train in front of him. It has too many voices in it for him to separate them: voices of iron and other metals and steam and wheels and coal and furniture. He turns to Toothsplitter, who stands lightly next to him and ignores the whispers and stares from other wizards. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like it and I want to come home?\u201d\n\u201cThe Realm of Song will always be your home,\u201d Toothsplitter replies in Gobbledegook, and reaches out to cup the sides of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I have a present that should make you feel better.\u201d\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s you coming with me, then\u2014\u201d\nHarry gasps when he sees the belt buckle glinting in the middle of Toothsplitter\u2019s palm, though. She\u2019s right, it does cheer him up. He scoops it up and stares at it, aware that he\u2019s licking his lips and looks greedy. He doesn\u2019t care. The intricate pattern of gold and iron knots on the buckle can only mean one thing.\nHarry looks up. \u201cYou\u2019re promoting me to journeyman because I\u2019m leaving?\u201d\n\u201cOf course that is not the only reason. Did you think I would let you get away with shoddy work?\u201d\nHarry grins, because he does know his teacher. No, Toothsplitter would never do a thing just for sentimental reasons. If she\u2019s promoting him to journeyman smith, she really does think his work is that good. He leans closer and rests his forehead briefly on her arm, giving her the greeting an apprentice goblin uses to a master for the last time. \u201cGood-bye. I don\u2019t know what the wizarding world will be like, but I think they\u2019re a little stupid.\u201d\nToothsplitter laughs aloud and puts one hand on his shoulder. \u201cGo in peace, little one. And astound them. That\u2019s the way you are.\u201d\nHarry waves at her and runs onto the train. He has a trunk with his clothes and his weapons and his wand and his school supplies. He doesn\u2019t have much else. The knowledge he carries is in his head; Harry does read books, but most of the way goblins pass on knowledge is with song.\nHarry wonders if he\u2019ll run into anyone else in the wizarding world who values such things. Probably not. But he might still have a good time here anyway if he can keep in mind that wizards just don\u2019t listen the way he does.\n*\nPeople keep gawking at him. But when Harry says something in response to their demands to see his scar, or their gasps, or something else, they all flinch back from him. They seem to expect him to be human.\nOh, well. Harry did tell Toothsplitter that he already knew most wizards would be stupid. It\u2019s only a little disappointing to be proven right.\nThey\u2019re standing in the Great Hall right now, with clouds hovering overhead. Harry thinks that\u2019s fascinating and hopes he gets the chance to talk to the ceiling. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because the walls or the floor think you\u2019re addressing them instead, and the Great Hall is the highest place he\u2019s ever been in.\nAnd the brightest. Harry\u2019s eyes are watering behind his glasses. He hopes that most of the corridors are darker.\nSome of the schoolbooks he got did talk about the Houses, but Harry wasn\u2019t sure which one he wanted to be in until he heard some of the other students talking on the train. Now he knows there\u2019s only one choice.\n\u201cGryffindor!\u2019 shouts the Hat for a few people, and \u201cHufflepuff!\u201d for others. Harry waits. The line in front of him gets shorter and shorter, but some people already have their eyes fixed on him. They knew what he looks like because of pictures in the newspapers when he was young, the books told Harry.\nIt still makes Harry think they\u2019re all slightly stupid. Why would you trust a photograph to tell you what someone is really like? Only their magic and their work can do that.\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\nHarry walks forwards and confidently reaches for the Hat when the older professor standing by the stool hands it to him. She\u2019s staring at him. Harry smiles at her, but he\u2019s embarrassed for her, too. By the time that you get to that age in goblin society, you\u2019re respected and probably a master smith or healer or counter or some other important profession. You don\u2019t go around gaping at people because you should be the kind of person they gape at instead.\nThe Hat settles over his eyes, and promptly says, \u201cWhat a fascinating notion of the world you do have, to be sure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you can talk back,\u201d Harry tells it. \u201cThere are so many objects here that feel dim and dull, probably because no one ever pays attention to them.\u201d\nThe Hat chuckles, making the older woman gasp. But its other words are mental, like Harry\u2019s, and no one else can hear them. \u201cThey are dim and dull. But you have\u2014well, an unusual mind. Where would you like to go, Harry Potter? There is only one House that would be absolutely unsuited for you, and that would be Hufflepuff.\u201d\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re all so loyal to many things instead of one?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be part of it, yes.\u201d\nHarry nods. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to Ravenclaw.\u201d\n\u201cOnly because they have a half-goblin Head of House?\u201d\n\u201cDo you really think that most wizards are going to like or sympathize with me once they find out that I was raised by goblins? I want someone who will. And I like learning, too. Just because I don\u2019t read books all the time doesn\u2019t mean that I wouldn\u2019t fit into Ravenclaw.\u201d\nThe Hat chuckles again for him. \u201cIndeed, and well-argued. That logical side will help you in your new House as well. Best of luck to you in RAVENCLAW!\u201d\nHarry hands the Hat back to the older woman, who\u2019s blinking, and then hops off the stool. As he heads towards the table decorated in bronze and blue, he catches the eye of the small professor and mouths, \u201cHello,\u201d in Gobbledegook.\nThe professor\u2019s mouth falls open, but he nods and mouths back, \u201cWelcome, young speaker,\u201d and then applauds harder than ever, and Harry\u2019s heart sings.\n\nUnwearied Then\n\nIt actually turns out to be simpler living in the wizarding world than Harry ever thought.\nFor one thing, he just speaks the truth when people ask him about where he was, and he ignores the gasps and outrage. Some people think he shouldn\u2019t have been raised by goblins. But then, some people think they have the right to steal possessions, and some people think wands don\u2019t have voices, and some people think they should be allowed to kill others and get away with it outside a war or a formal dueling ring. That doesn\u2019t make them right. Harry lives in reality. He ignores their opinions and guards his possessions and listens to his wand and is ready to defend people.\nHis Potions professor hates him. He keeps saying Harry should read the book. Harry chants the properties of aconite and bezoars the first day for him in class, but it just makes Snape turn incredibly purple.\nHarry reckons that\u2019s partially because he couldn\u2019t answer the question about the Draught of Living Death with goblin knowledge. Well, Harry does try to read the books more often, but they are boring. Things would be improved if wizarding society had bards you could pay to sing about potions.\nSome of the Ravenclaws think he\u2019s mental for creating music for himself when he studies, but he hums it quietly and goes into the dungeon corridors that few people seem to use when he wants to sing aloud, so they mostly ignore it.\nHarry also finds plenty of friends in the castle when humans are avoiding him. There are mirrors that no one has ever asked to shine, blocks of stone in the walls that still remember their quarries, and staircases that always lead Harry in the right direction because he asks them nicely. The Great Hall\u2019s ceiling is as fascinating to talk to as Harry thought it would be.\nProfessor Flitwick is pretty fascinating, too. He asks Harry lots of questions about the Realm of Song when Harry is serving the inevitable detentions Snape assigns him, and the detentions he gets from Professor McGonagall because he asks his wand to do things instead of using the proper incantations, and the detentions he gets from the Astronomy professor for not doing the homework (Harry just doesn\u2019t think stars are interesting, because they\u2019re too far away to talk to).\nProfessor Flitwick arranges for Harry to serve the detentions with him, and he does try to speak to Harry about doing his homework more. But he ends up laughing most of the time, so Harry knows Professor Flitwick isn\u2019t annoyed.\n\u201cYou should do your Astronomy essays, however, Harry,\u201d he tells him in Gobbledegook as Harry finishes up writing some lines in English about how he will not disobey the professors. \u201cPoor Professor Sinistra.\u201d\n\u201cBut how much am I going to use Astronomy? And my eyes can\u2019t see some of the things she\u2019s talking about, anyway.\u201d\nProfessor Flitwick leans forwards and studies him seriously when he says that. \u201cAre you saying that your eyes were damaged from living underground, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not damaged. But they\u2019re not used to looking at stars. And how much do you use Astronomy in your life now, Professor Flitwick?\u201d\nProfessor Flitwick says, \u201cHarry, that is not the point. I want you to start doing your Astronomy homework.\u201d\nBut he smiles when he says it, so Harry decides he\u2019s won and that squinting a little harder to see the stars Professor Sinistra is talking about won\u2019t be so bad.\n*\nProfessor Dumbledore comes ambling up the stairs to Ravenclaw Tower one day and wants to stop and talk to Harry. Harry tells him that he can but he\u2019s very busy working on one of those missing Astronomy essays, so can it wait?\nProfessor Dumbledore looks at him for a very long time when he says that. Harry gets bored and goes back to writing his Astronomy essay. They\u2019re sitting on the stairs outside Ravenclaw Tower. It\u2019s one of the staircases that likes Harry, and Harry reaches out and absently pats one of the steps.\nIt seems the professor decides that means it\u2019s good to talk now. \u201cOne of the things that I am concerned about, Mr. Potter, with you being goblin-raised, is that you don\u2019t seem to have many friends at Hogwarts.\u201d\nHarry blinks. \u201cI\u2019m not sure who told you that, sir. I have lots of friends. I can think of fifty or so off the top of my head.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so, Harry? Would you mind introducing me to them?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. The first one is the staircase you\u2019re standing on. It\u2019s grateful that people don\u2019t spill butterbeer on it like they do with the floor in Gryffindor Tower, but it doesn\u2019t like us carrying all those heavy books up it. The Sorting Hat is fascinating, too. Sorry that you found me in your office that time, but I just wanted to talk to it.\u201d\nBeing in the Headmaster\u2019s office is one of those things that everyone else treated with shock and horror. Even Professor Flitwick seemed upset with him. But Harry doesn\u2019t understand. Finding hollow places in the stone is natural to him. And he doesn\u2019t understand why they call them \u201csecret passages,\u201d either. Harry offered to tell the professors about them, so they wouldn\u2019t be secret anymore. The only people who wanted to listen were those two red-haired Weasleys from Gryffindor, though.\n\u201cI was asking about human friends, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sorry, sir. You didn\u2019t say. Well, there\u2019s Fred and George Weasley from Gryffindor, and Professor Flitwick. I also think that it\u2019s very easy to talk to Cedric Diggory. He wants to know a lot about how his broom sounds when he rides it. I was able to tell him some of the bristles were about to break off! He said thank you and that he would take better care of it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you had grown up with your relatives, Harry, then you would have had a normal life when you came here.\u201d\n\u201cHow does sleeping in a cupboard make me normal, sir?\u201d\nProfessor Dumbledore stares at him. He doesn\u2019t appear to know what to say.\n\u201cThey called me a freak and never told me about magic,\u201d Harry tells Professor Dumbledore, shaking his head. He thinks poor Professor Dumbledore can\u2019t be that smart, even though Fred and George\u2019s brother Percy always says he\u2019s a genius. Well, Percy also isn\u2019t that smart. \u201cMy people always told me about magic and that I was human and had me practice English and wizard magic. That\u2019s a lot better than my relatives.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you are the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, I am. I lived a much better life in the Realm of Song than with my relatives.\u201d It\u2019s been a long time since Harry thought about the Dursleys. He pities them now. They\u2019ll never hear a river speak or watch molten gold dance in front of them or argue with Toothsplitter about cases in Latin. It\u2019s such a sad, limited life.\n\u201cThat means that you must face down Voldemort.\u201d\n\u201cOh, him. He\u2019s kind of a waste of space, isn\u2019t he? Anyway, most of my people don\u2019t think so. Blackeye thinks that it had something to do with my scar, but she healed the piece of soul in my scar, so it can\u2019t have anything to do with that anymore.\u201d\nProfessor Dumbledore sits down very hard on the steps.\n\u201cYour\u2014your scar is still visible,\u201d he whispers when a few minutes have passed and Harry has written a few more lines on his Astronomy essay.\n\u201cYeah, Blackeye said it had been there too long to do much about in the end,\u201d Harry says distractedly as he flips through the book to find the fact he needs. Honestly, he wishes books had voices of their own instead of the voices of the leather and sinew and paper they\u2019re made from. It would make it easier to ask them where facts are hiding. \u201cBut she got rid of the piece of soul.\u201d He looks up hopefully. \u201cSir, do you know why Jupiter\u2019s rings are important?\u201d\n\u201cI think,\u201d Professor Dumbledore says slowly, \u201cthat is a question you must answer for yourself.\u201d He stands up even more slowly. Harry hopes that he hasn\u2019t broken a hip or something. Toothsplitter is always unhappy with Gravensword when that happens to him. \u201cVoldemort may still come after you, you know, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll cut his head off when he tries.\u201d\nProfessor Dumbledore looks like he wants to sit down again. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHarry draws the knife Ripclaw gave him. \u201cI can cut through skin very fast,\u201d he explains. \u201cI can cut off his head.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not that simple, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be,\u201d Harry says, and puts the knife away. \u201cIf you just let it.\u201d\n*\nThere are other conversations, and adventures. Harry makes friends with the sinks in the boys\u2019 bathrooms, and they tell the others, so when a troll comes wandering into the school and into a girls\u2019 bathroom, Harry just has to ask the sinks to turn on all at once. The water comes spraying out and the troll gets it in its eyes and lumbers off so the professors can take care of it.\nHarry finds study partners in his House who don\u2019t mind that he constantly hums under his breath. Some of them even want to learn Gobbledegook and how to talk to objects. Harry happily shares some of the speaking with them that won\u2019t betray secrets of the Realm of Song or crafting and forging, and smiles when he hears Terry Boot asking a shower to turn on and Michael Corner sulking because a stone was mean to him. (Harry did try to tell Michael: you never insult a stone\u2019s flakes of mica. It\u2019s just not done).\nA few Slytherins try to insult him, but they stop when the floors beneath their feet constantly buckle and their own books refuse to open.\nAll in all, Harry fits better into the wizarding world than he thought. But he\u2019s still happy when the Christmas holiday comes and he can go back to London and through the front offices of Gringotts that are only for show and down into the darkness again.\nToothsplitter welcomes him with a challenge to prove that he hasn\u2019t lost all his smithing skill, and Harry spends his first night hammering all the dents out of a breastplate that some idiot giant wore against a dragon.\nThen he sits on the shore of a dark river and exchanges tales of Hogwarts with Gorgeslitter and Ripclaw and Gravensword and his young goblin friends, and listens to the songs continually going on in the background.\nHe falls asleep in his small sleeping space that night, and goes running through tunnels the next morning. The stone chants underneath his feet, tales as old as the planet. Harry feels the weight of his wand in his pocket, its soft curiosity about the Realm of Song, and smiles.\nHe can have two worlds, and anyone who says that he can\u2019t is lying. But the Realm of Song is always going to be home.\n\nThe End.\n"
