    "text": "Filtered, yellow light lit the principle\u2019s office of Aldera Junior High. Shouta sat safe in the cold shadow of the back corner and waited, half-asleep, half-coiled.\u00a0\nHe was here on school\u2014and state\u2014business. UA protected its students from media mongering as a matter of course, a a service backed by the government as an equal matter of course. Everyone knew the damage one scandalizing interview could cause to hero careers and UA\u2019s reputation alike, and that was something both school and state took seriously.\u00a0\nOne such interview had taken place over the past week. An old Aldera classmate of Izuku Midoriya had somehow got ahold of the press and released such scandalizing details as accusations of Quirklessness and cheating. Hence, Shouta\u2019s presence.\nHe had already visited this principal once before, soon after Bakugo and Midoriya\u2019s enrollment at UA processed. He had laid out UA\u2019s strict policy of preventing interviews from former classmates, and laid out the legal consequences of failing to enforce the policy among the students.\u00a0\nOnce was usually enough, in his experience. The principals were dazzled by the promise of a UA student from their junior high, and eager to promise strict policy compliance. The promises tended to stick, half because of the threat of legal action and half because no principal wanted to be the one to endanger their star student\u2019s prospects.\nThis school had been different. The awed look in all the staff\u2019s eyes had been nothing new, but the undercurrent\u2014hungry and satisfied whenever Bakugo was mentioned, uncomfortable wherever Midoriya came up\u2014flaunted red flags. The difference between the two boys was evident once Shouta met them. Bakugo was a classic example of a favored student, all skill and arrogance. Midoriya, though. Midoriya was a timid wreck of determination.\u00a0\nIt could be nerves, Shouta had thought initially, but no. The boy startled whenever he was praised, and hid his face at the mildest compliment. This was a child unused to care. It might have been his Quirk, Shouta thought. Midoriya clearly had little practice with it before entering UA, and people might have shunned him for his poor Quirk control. It might have been an awkward personality. It might have been anything, but Shouta remembered the looks of masked dismay on the Aldera staff\u2019s faces when informed that Midoriya ranked seventh in UA\u2019s entrance exam.\u00a0\nSomething was wrong at this school, and he was going to get to the bottom of it.\nThe secretary finished her phone call, nested the phone back in its receiver, and cleared her throat. \u201cThe principal will see you now, Aizawa-san.\u201d\nShouta flowed to his feet, extending stiff muscles. People\u2019s first reactions to UA representatives were telling, and accordingly, Shouta wanted the reaction to happen in front of him, not behind closed doors. He had therefore failed to mention his job posting, or the reason for his visit, and had been made to wait well over half an hour for this appointment as a result.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you will follow me,\u201d the secretary said, holding open a side door. He followed, taking in the wall hangings as he passed. Art projects. Certificates. One plaque read honored graduates. Bakugo\u2019s name was last on the plaque, shiny with newness. Midoriya\u2019s name was nowhere to be found.\u00a0\nInteresting.\nThe secretary opened the door, bowed, and left. Shouta walked in, feet padding on worn carpeting.\u00a0\nHe saw the moment Principal Himura recognized him as the UA representative that had visited Aldera once before, soon after Bakugo and Midoriya\u2019s acceptance into UA. Faint horror filled the man\u2019s eyes, quickly hidden.\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome, Aizawa-san, was it? Sit down, sit down. You should have informed my staff who you were, and I would not have kept you waiting.\u201d\nThe faint horror was understandable, Shouta thought, sitting. The hidden note of unease, though\u2014that was something to keep an eye on.\u00a0\n\u201cI am sure a man such as yourself has many pressing appointments,\u201d Himura was saying, settling into his seat with a grunt. \u201cTell me how I can be of assistance.\u201d\nThat was a polite overstatement, Shouta thought with grim amusement. He knew full well that his appearance leaned more toward \u201clazy, underdressed man\u201d than \u201coverbusy government official,\u201d even if both were true. He leaned forward.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m here on official business about Izuku Midoriya,\u201d he said, and\u2014there. A flash of fear and contempt in Himura\u2019s eyes. The lack of Midoriya\u2019s name on the plaque was no oversight, then.\u00a0\nHe filed the information away.\nHe had wondered and observed, previously. Now he knew. This was not a building Midoriya was welcome in.\nHe settled further into the chair.\n\u201cI am here to inform you that a student of yours, Yasuda Yin, broke the nondisclosure policy surrounding Midoriya Izuku. I am here to address that error.\u201d\nHimura relaxed. That wasn\u2019t the accusation the man had been expecting. \u201cI apologize profusely,\u201d Himura said, crossing his legs and leaning back in his chair, \u201cbut the school cannot monitor what every student says at every moment of the day.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Shouta agreed, watching the man relax further. \u201cBut you are expected to take appropriate action afterward,\u201d he added, words snapping shut like a trap. Himura flinched. \u201cI think you fail to understand the national threat Yasuda has caused.\u201d\nHimura was sitting upright, now, face paling. \u201cPlease explain.\u201d\n\u201cThe government substantially backs UA\u2019s funding and reputation,\u201d Shouta drawled. \u201cSurely, you know this. Problems at UA are therefore problems of state.\u201d\nHimura nodded, cautious.\n\u201cUA\u2019s media presence has been negative the past four months,\u201d Shouta continued. \u201cThe attack at the USJ, the kidnapping of your former student by the League of Villains, the media criticism of both events. The government won\u2019t allow another hit at UA. That includes scandalizing interviews of one of our first year students. Do you understand your position?\u201d\u00a0\nHimura nodded, slow.\nReluctant? Hard to tell. Maybe.\n\u201cYou are responsible for containing a major threat to public confidence of UA, and by extension, the government,\u201d Shouta stressed. \u201cI cannot overstate your role.\u201d\nHimura was still slow to respond. It could be shock, it could be anything, but Shouta wondered, slumping down further in his chair\u2014the picture of indifference.\n\u201cIf I may be frank,\u201d Himura said at length.\u00a0\nShouta waved a lazy hand, watching keenly. \u201cPlease do.\u201d\n\u201cThe public image of UA shouldn\u2019t be entrusted to a boy such as Midoriya Izuku,\u201d Himura said. \u201cThe boy is a cheat and a liar.\u201d\nAh.\u00a0\nThere it was.\u00a0\nShouta closed his eyes to mask his fury.\n\u201cThe child is Quirkless,\u201d Himura continued, unaware or unafraid of the slow simmer of anger building in Shouta. \u201cHe\u2019s clever, I\u2019ll give you that. I don\u2019t know how he faked a Quirk, but I can tell you he most assuredly did.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you inform UA of this fact?\u201d Shouta asked tonelessly.\u00a0\n\u201cI did,\u201d Himura said, voice near-distressed. \u201cI did, but the school contacted me almost immediately to say that\u2014\u201c the man\u2019s voice dropped \u201c\u2014All Might himself endorsed Midoriya\u2019s claim of a Quirk.\u201d\nThat caught Shouta\u2019s attention. Anyone with eyes knew All Might was closely tied to Midoriya Izuku, but this was confirmation that the relationship started well before school was in session. Good to know.\n\u201cI would never claim that the Symbol of Peace intentionally lied,\u201d Himura went on, \u201cbut I can state with confidence that Midoriya was utterly Quirkless throughout middle school. Furthermore, he was always causing trouble, disrupting class and disturbing his classmates. He doesn\u2019t deserve a place at UA.\u201d\nMidoriya, Aizawa knew, was quiet in class\u2014almost to a fault\u2014unless he got excited, at which point he would do nothing more harmful than mumble to himself. Disruptive? A disturbance? Problem Child had many flaws, but those occurred almost solely because of his self-destructive streak. It had nothing to do with any classroom management issues. And the boy certainly, painfully had a Quirk. It was hard to miss.\nThere were many types of lava. Some types exploded, creating a deadly splash zone. Hizashi had a explosive-lava temper.\nSome types of lava were slow and steady, creeping along with no particular rush until they encompassed entire fields. Shouta had a creeping-lava temper, and the heat was lapping at his shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he started, low and slow, \u201chas every place at UA. He is an analyst and a strategist, and your own star student, Bakugo Katsuki, would not have got off Kamino without him.\u201d\nThat was the reason he had not expelled the lot of them, ultimately. Had they broken the law? Yes. Had they broken his trust? Yes. Could All Might have successfully got Bakugo out of Kamino Ward alone? Arguably, no.\u00a0\nIt was the role of a hero to save people who needed saving.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd regardless of what you think of him,\u201d Shouta said, standing, \u201cwho are you to tell a child he is no hero?\u201d\nHimura flinched, a full body thing.\u00a0\n\u201cHeroes come in many forms, professional and personal,\u201d Shouta spat. \u201cWho are you to tell a child he is not one?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Himura snapped, standing to face Shouta. \u201cI know who you are, Eraserhead. You tell UA children they aren\u2019t heroes every year.\u201d\n\u201cI tell them,\u201d Shouto said, stepping forward, \u201cthey are not capable of surviving on the field. I never tell them they don\u2019t deserve to be a hero. Heroes die. That\u2019s why I expel the ones that will fail. I don\u2019t tell a child he is worthless because he has no Quirk.\u201d\nHe drew a breath, drew all his suspicions together, and regretted every moment he had viewed Midoriya as Bakugo\u2019s rival instead of Bakugo\u2019s victim. \u201cAnd I have never. Ever. Taught one child he ought to mock another child on the basis of Quirklessness.\u201d\nHimura stilled, sat. Shouta loomed. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Bakugo and Midoriya for months, now. I see how Bakugo thinks he\u2019s entitled to hurt anyone, so long as it gets him his goal. I see how Midoriya thinks he\u2019s entitled to nothing, not even basic decency. You did your students no favors. You crippled them both, just because you thought Quirkless meant worthless.\u201d\nHimura wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. Shouta\u2019s assumptions were right, then.\nThe thought brought no relief.\u00a0\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d Shouta said, stepping back, \u201cthis has no bearing on Midoriya\u2019s worth as a person, despite your prejudiced opinion, but Midoriya has a Quirk, one of the strongest I\u2019ve ever seen. I suspect he didn\u2019t use it because he ran the risk of blowing himself up every time he touched it.\u201d\nHimura flinched.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Shouta said briskly. Lava poured out of him, swamping the entirety of Aldera Junior High. \u201cI\u2019ll be running a formal investigation on the former abuse of one UA student, Midoriya Izuku. I expect your full cooperation, unless you want your school shut down for obstruction of justice.\u201d\nNothing from Himura.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with video footage of every classroom Midoriya was in, cross-referenced with every school incident report.\u201d\n\u201cSurely a man such as yourself doesn\u2019t have the time to check so many hours of video,\u201d the man said weakly. \u201cAllow me to offer myself as an assistant\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo.\u201d Shouta wondered how the man thought he would get away with such a blatant attempt to mask data. \u201cAnd before we use up more of my precious time, allow me to inform you that I know the signs of edited footage in my sleep. Don\u2019t attempt anything, or I\u2019ll have you in jail.\u201d\nHimura nodded, and went back to not meeting his eyes.\n\u201cIf you excuse me, I have some calls to make.\u201d He strode out of the room, leaned against the wall, and speed dialed Nedzu.\nNedzu answered on the fourth ring. \u201cAizawa. What a pleasant surprise, I\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI have a new school for you to rake across the coals for ethical misconduct,\u201d Shouta cut in.\u00a0\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Nedzu breathed, delighted. \u201cWhich school?\u201d\n\u201cAldera Junior High. Bakugo and Midoriya\u2019s middle school.\u201d\nA pause. \u201cOh.\u201d The glee faded from Nedzu\u2019s voice, replaced with grim understanding. Shouta could almost hear the puzzle pieces clicking together in the principal\u2019s mind. \u201cI see. This is about Midoriya\u2019s Quirklessness?\u201d\nShouta gripped the phone tight enough to make the phone case groan. \u201cSo it\u2019s true. He was Quirkless.\u201d\n\u201cUntil soon before the entrance exam,\u201d Nedzu confirmed. \u201cThat\u2019s not relevant now, though, because\u2014\u201c\n\u201cRelevant?\u201d Shouta hissed. \u201cMidoriya is barely functional, socially. He doesn\u2019t trust any adult. He thinks the whole world hates him. He apologizes for everything except breaking the law, and I\u2019m sure I can trace every single one of those things back to his Quirklessness. You call that irrelevant? I needed to know this, Nedzu.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bias your judgement,\u201d came the far more meek reply.\nShouta narrowed his eyes and felt his Quirk activate out of pure temper. \u201cYou think I would dismiss Midoriya because his Quirk came in late?\u201d\nNedzu sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d He hurried his words before Shouta could get a furious word in edgewise. \u201cYou would see a near-Quirkless child as a liability on the battlefield, and dismiss him to keep him and others safe. He would be worth no less as a person to you, but you might think him worthless as a hero.\u201d\nThe words had the bitter sting of half-truth. Shouta would have high expectations for a Quirkless hero, for the Quirkless started with the field leveled against them and needed strength of mind and will to cope. Still, he wouldn\u2019t have rejected one out of hand. \u201cI\u2019m his teacher,\u201d Shouta hissed. \u201cHe has merit, so I do everything I can to help him. I can\u2019t help him if I don\u2019t know these things.\u201d\n\u201cWould he have merit if he were Quirkless?\u201d Nedzu said, soft and gentle. Never in Shouta\u2019s life had he more wished to kick the principal\u2019s face in.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya Izuku is smart enough and kind enough to make it as a hero, Quirk notwithstanding,\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou should know that, after I kept him in my class when his Quirk was such a liability. You should have let me judge the matter for myself.\u201d\n\u201cI see that now,\u201d Nedzu said, almost apologetic. \u201cForgive me. What did the school do to Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sidetracking me,\u201d Shouta said, low and furious. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making amends,\u201d Nedzu corrected. \u201cI thought to treat Midoriya like any other student to show we did not discriminate against him, but I see now that this approach hurt more than helped. Allow me to right this wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about this later,\u201d Shouta threatened, then allowed himself to lean against the wall. \u201cThe principal looked down on Midoriya. Called him a cheat and a liar, got jumpy whenever I mentioned Midoriya\u2019s accomplishments, included Bakugo but not Midoriya on a plaque commemorating past students. I suspect there\u2019s much more going on under the surface. I need a permit.\u201d\n\u201cYou have it,\u201d Nedzu said. \u201cGive me a half hour. Do you want me to arrange for Yamada to run your homeroom?\u201d\nShouta turned the prospect over in his mind. It was a good suggestion, but he hated the idea of leaving his class, even for something as important as this and he needed to confront Midoriya over this sooner or later. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Nedzu said, tone darkening. \u201cI\u2019ll review the school\u2019s conduct while you\u2019re in class. This will be a joint investigation with me.\u201d\nShouta wanted to spit out something cutting, but forced the words back. Nedzu had far more experience than he at the legal process of bringing down a corrupt organization. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, and hung up.\n\u00a0\n\nHe had taken his lunch break to talk with Principal Himura. By the time he got back, his students would be halfway through math with Ectoplasm. Meanwhile, Shouta was going to take a deep dive into Midoriya\u2019s files. He already had done so at the beginning of the year, but things might come into a new light, now.\nNedzu was waiting for him at the gate, holding a thick folder of information. Shouta took it wordlessly and nodded, simmering down his anger into something cooler, deadlier. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nNedzu nodded back, a feral shadow in his eyes. \u201cI did some research into the state of Quirkless people today. I fear I am dangerously out of touch with such information, given our school focuses on the upper ranks of Quirked children.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf Midoriya is anything like average, he would have been told to kill himself an average of two point seven times a month.\u201d\nShouta\u2019s grip on the folder tightened. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d And he did. Midoriya had a destructive streak almost as wide and deep as his desire to help people. The boy was willing to shatter his arm in the Quirk evaluation test\u2014when Shouta told him this was not an acceptable risk, Midoriya had looked blank and desperate, not the slightest bit of relief in his eyes.\u00a0\nThat blank look haunted Shouta as Midoriya refused to run from villains at the USJ, as Midoriya broke, re-broke his arm and each individual finger during the Sports Festival, as Midoriya crippled himself in the training camp attack, as Midoriya threw himself into the looming disaster that was Kamino Ward.\u00a0\n\u201cIs he suicidal?\u201d he asked Nedzu, because Nedzu would know, and this was important.\nNedzu shook his head. \u201cSuicidal people think people are better off if they\u2019re dead. Midoriya thinks he should help people, even if it kills him. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\u00a0\nEven if it kills him. There were many reasons Shouta expelled students\u2014lack of seriousness, lack of skill, lack of wisdom. All things that would kill them in the field. He had never had a student so ready to die, before. That changed things.\u00a0\n\u201cI need to talk to Midoriya,\u201d he said, brushing past Nedzu. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said, standing in the doorway. Everyone turned to look at him. \u201cCome with me, please.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you in trouble this time?\u201d Kaminari mumbled to Midoriya, who shrugged back in helpless confusion.\u00a0\nThe words rang in Shouta\u2019s ears. Why are you in trouble? Midoriya wasn\u2019t in trouble, but Midoriya had a lot of trouble. Midoriya\u2019s trouble came because he was so deep in the trouble caused by others.\nMidoriya walked up to Shouta, textbooks in arms. So the boy expected to be gone the rest of lecture. Correct, although probably not for the reasons Midoriya expected.\u00a0\nShouta shut the door, turned to Midoriya. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble,\u201d he said. Midoriya nodded, with a look in his eye that said he didn\u2019t believe Shouta in the slightest.\nShouta led Midoriya down the hall, down the stairs, down to his office on the first floor. Midoriya trailed behind, looking confused but resigned.\nShouta unlocked his door and opened it for Midoriya. Midoriya glanced at him, glanced back away, and walked though the doorway.\nThere was two chairs in the room. One of them was plush and school-issued. The other was a foldout. Shouta took the foldout and gestured Midoriya to sit. The boy did, settling lightly, poised to flee.\u00a0\n\u201cAn old classmate of yours tried to release a damaging interview about you,\u201d Shouta said. Midoriya startled. This hadn\u2019t been what the boy was expecting.\u00a0\nSo quick to assume he was here to be hurt. Shouta knew that, had known that for months, but knowing the barest glimmer behind why Midoriya thought that way was painful.\n\u201cThe classmate claimed you cheated your way into UA,\u201d Shouta continued, watching the boy\u2019s fidgeting freeze in place. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. Nedzu is far too clever to allow in someone who cheated their way through.\u201d\nMidoriya nodded, clenching his fists.\u00a0\n\u201cAppropriate agencies are making sure the interview never makes it to air,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cHowever, it brought some interesting points to my attention.\u201d\nMidoriya took a breath, looked down, looked away.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shouta said, using his gentlest voice, the one he used to coax kittens out of cardboard boxes, \u201cwere you really Quirkless, in middle school?\u201d\nSomething in Midoriya shut down. Stiffness gave way to limp despair, and the spark in Midoriya gave way to dull acceptance, tempered only by the faintest sparkle of determination.\nThis wasn\u2019t Midoriya, UA student, Shouta realized. This was a glimpse into Midoriya\u2019s dark past. This was Midoriya, middle schooler, kept ever so carefully at bay. Until now.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said, trying to catch the boy\u2019s attention even as his heart sank. Here, Midoriya utterly, unexpectedly vulnerable, the damage was clear. Here was not a brave hero-to-be, but a child, broken. A child, lost.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he repeated, and this time, Midoriya looked up.\n\u201cAre you going to expel me?\u201d he asked, voice tiny.\nAnd Shouta hesitated. Not for long, because Midoriya was the type with unexpected reserves of strength, the type to power through insurmountable odds, but he hesitated.\nHe hesitated, because damage this deep was costly. A hero had to be able to trust adults, and a hero had to be able to trust themself. Currently, Midoriya trusted no one. Currently, Midoriya was halfway to suicidal.\nHe believed Midoriya could work past it; Midoriya had already made great strides, giant strides, since the beginning of the school year. Shouta has faith Midoriya could, would, keep moving. But if he didn\u2019t, Aizawa would have to expel him, or face his conscience when Midoryia died young and alone in the field.\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s face was crumpling at his lack of a reply. Shouta reached for words that were honest. After everything, Midoriya deserved no less.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be expelled,\u201d he said. Midoriya looked up at him through tears. \u201cLet me be clear. Your former lack of a Quirk doesn\u2019t disqualify you. Use your head. I fight essentially Quirkless. I wouldn\u2019t turn away a student who did the same.\u201d\nMidoriya was full-on crying now, suppressed little hiccups shaking his chest.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere I might expel you is the damage you took from being Quirkless,\u201d Shouta went on more reluctantly. \u201cYou have to learn to trust the adults, Midoriya. I understand why you don\u2019t. People treated you in ways they never should have. But if you can\u2019t learn to trust adults when they make rules to keep you safe, then you won\u2019t survive being a hero, and I cannot allow that.\u201d\nMidoriya sucked in a breath, struggled to regain control, and fell apart worse than before. Shouta abandoned his folding chair and knelt at Midoriya\u2019s feet, taking Midoriya\u2019s limp hand. \u201cMidoriya. Look at me.\u201d\nMidoriya did, slowly and soggily. \u201cSensei,\u201d he whispered, sounding broken. \u201cI want to be a hero.\u201d\n\u201cI want that for you too, Midoriya,\u201d Shouta said gently. \u201cPlease let me help you.\u201d\nMidoriya shuddered, a violent, full-body, head-to-toe tremble that nearly shattered the carefully brave look on Midoriya\u2019s face.\u00a0\nShouta waited.\nAnd waited.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Midoriya said, and dissolved back into tears.\u00a0\nHe clung to Shouta\u2019s hand, crushing the bones in Shouta\u2019s hand together, and sobbed. Eventually, words formed. \u201cDo\u2014do you think I could have really been a hero without a Quirk?\u201d\u00a0\nShouta considered Midoriya\u2019s charisma, his overflowing determination, his strategic brilliance that got everyone both in and out of Kamino untouched. \u201cYes, if you remembered to slow down enough to stop destroying yourself.\u201d\nMidoriya hiccuped out a broken burst of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s what you say already.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point,\u201d Aizawa murmured. \u201cProblem Child, will you\u2014\u201c\nHe froze. \u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cdo you think I call you Problem Child because I hate you?\u201d\nSilence.\u00a0\nThat was answer enough.\u00a0\nShouta groaned, ran a hand though his hair with his spare hand. \u201cMidoriya. Look at me. This is important.\u201d\nHesitantly, but with a vulnerable sort of confidence he had never seen on Midoriya before, the boy looked up.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shouta said, gripping Midoriya\u2019s hand, \u201cI call you Problem Child because you cause me a lot of problems, not because you yourself are a problem.\u201d\nMidoriya risked a shaky grin. \u201cSame thing, right?\u201d\nShouta wanted to explode, just once, at Midoriya\u2019s former teachers. Little wonder this child didn\u2019t trust him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cMidoriya, you are not a burden or a problem. You are a child.\u201d\nMidoriya laughed a little incredulously, then sobered, then blinked, then finally began to process the words. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, faintly, distantly.\n\u201cI want to help you, not hurt you,\u201d Shouta said with fierce quietness. \u201cPlease let me help.\u201d\nMidoriya let out a long breath. \u201cHow?\u201d\nNow, Shouta walked carefully. Midoriya was open to him, but still poised to flee\u2014not out of distrust, but ingrained habit. \u201cWhat would you like to tell me?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nMidoriya gulped back another round of what looked like tears. \u201cCan you tell me what you want to know so you can\u2014can help me?\u201d He tasted the words like exotic fruit he wasn\u2019t certain he liked yet.\n\u201cTell me about your Quirk,\u201d Shouta said, because it all seemed to start there. \u201cI know it came in impossibly late, and that you registered it as \u201cSuperpower,\u2019 and that it hurts you if you use too much at once, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d Put that way, he knew frighteningly little about Midoriya\u2019s Quirk.\nMidoriya hesitated, visibly torn.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me right now,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me ever. But I could help you much more if I knew what I was dealing with.\u201d\nMidoriya took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s my Quirk.\u201d\nOf course. Trust wasn\u2019t born in a few minutes, not for an abused child. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said, withdrawing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Midoriya said, firm in a flare of confidence. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. It\u2019s my Quirk. I can tell you if I want to.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Shouta said, confused but hoping.\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Midoriya whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014hard. To carry it. I need to talk to All Might.\u201d\nBlinking at this non-sequitur, it took Shouta a moment to catch up as Midoriya stood, apparently ready to talk to All Might right this instant. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. Slow down, Problem Child, he almost said, stopping himself at the last second.\u00a0\nMidoriya turned to face Shouta, rubbing away tear tracks from his cheeks with his sleeve. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m investigating Aldera Junior High for Quirk discrimination and abuse of power. Is there anything you want me to look for?\u201d\nThe question was an open invitation to tell Shouta what had happened in middle school. Midoriya hesitated. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really Quirk discrimination\u2014\u201c he said, twisting his fingers into his uniform.\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Shouta cut in. \u201cDiscriminating against someone for not having a Quirk is just as harmful as discriminating against someone for having a certain kind of Quirk.\u201d\nFrom the watery look on Midoriya\u2019s face, he hadn\u2019t heard this before. Shouta gritted his teeth and resolved to press the full extent of charges to Aldera Junior High.\nHe hoped for Midoriya to confide in him, but he forgot to account for Midoriya\u2019s mile-wide protective streak. Midoriya\u2019s face firmed into some kind of resolve. \u201cThank you, Sensei,\u201d he said. \u201cReally. But I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t get anyone in trouble.\u201d\nShouta tasted bitter disappointment for only a moment before he realized its source. \u201cThis is about Bakugo,\u201d he said, less a guess and more a confirmation.\u00a0\nMidoriya flinched. \u201cHe was just\u2014young. Everyone kept telling him that it was okay to do the things he did, because he was going to be a strong hero one day, and because, because I was\u2014\u201c He sucked in a breath. \u201c\u2014Quirkless,\u201d he breathed.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd that will be taken into account,\u201d Shouta promised, heart sinking at Midoriya\u2019s words. A system that let future heroes run unchecked while stepping on anyone weaker was toxic to everyone involved. \u201cMidoriya, you understand why I have to press charges?\u201d\n\u201cSo no one else gets hurt,\u201d Midoriya mumbled. \u201cBut\u2014\u201c He looked helplessly up at Shouta.\u00a0\n\u201cBakugo was a child raised in a toxic system,\u201d Shouta said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d This seemed to comfort Midoriya, although perhaps it shouldn\u2019t. If Bakugo had done something serious, Shouta couldn\u2019t in good faith ignore it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk with you again later. Midoriya, you can come to me when you have concerns. It won\u2019t be a bother. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Midoriya said, an edge of doubtful incredulity still lining his voice.\u00a0\n\u201cI mean it,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cThose aren\u2019t empty words. Are you ready to get back to class?\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Midoriya said, cautious in the new trustspace between them, \u201cI need to talk to All Might. It\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u201cAll Might is busy teaching heroics to 1B, which is also important,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cIs it an emergency?\u201d\nMidoriya shook his head. \u201cIt can wait, I guess,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cGood. Talk to him after class gets out.\u201d All Might sometimes grated on his nerves, but Shouta was just realizing the miracle it was that Midoriya trusted any adult with his secrets. If Midoriya needed to talk this one out with All Might, the man would be more than happy to do so.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes All Might know you were Quirkless?\u201d he asked, turning away from Midoriya to allow his student some semblance of privacy after such an emotionally wringing discussion.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Midoriya said, and there was another flare of anger in Shouta\u2019s chest. All Might should have known enough to think to tell Aizawa that. But All Might, for all his strength, was still new to teaching and genuinely might not have thought Aizawa needed to know.\u00a0\nCurse the man.\nThe bell rang for class change. \u201cI should go,\u201d Midoriya said, the words half a question.\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re ready to do people,\u201d Shouta said. Midoriya nodded, wiping away the last of his tears and walking slowly out the door, apparently lost in thought.\nRight.\u00a0\nShouta kept the gentleness on his face until the door shut. Then, he ripped open Midoriya\u2019s file.\nIncident report. Incident report. Midoriya hurt himself, said one. Midoriya hurt himself again, said another. There were inches of these.\u00a0\nShouta flipped to Midoriya\u2019s registration paperwork. At the top was a photo of Midoriya, smiling shakily. Below was school information\u2014high grades, faint praise from teacher recommendations, a startling lack of extracurricular activities. Midoriya was smart, unliked, and isolated, Shouta had thought when first reviewing the file. Now, the memory came back full force.\nHow could he have been so stupid as to overlook this? It was clear on second glance that something was wrong. Teachers were never unhappy their student made it into UA.\u00a0\nHe knew the answer. Cold weight settled in his stomach, shame curdling deep.\nHe had overlooked the facts because he had been planning to expel Midoriya the first day of class. The teacher comments had only backed up his assumption that Midoriya was not ready for UA.\u00a0\nStupid. So, so stupid, and his student had been paying the price for his arrogance for months now. He should have been helping Midoriya all this time, but no.\u00a0\nHis pocket buzzed. He yanked his phone out, and checked the screen.\nIt was Nedzu, emailing the necessary permits and paperwork to investigate Aldera Junior High.\u00a0\nGood.\nHe scanned the email. The staff were quite eager to oblige the principal of UA, Nedzu had written. Of course, I didn\u2019t tell them who I was investigating.\nA small, hot part of Shouta was glad that Nedzu was on this case. Nedzu had a vindictive streak, and it came out when he was angry. The principal hadn\u2019t bothered with force to get the information; he had cheerfully asked for it, and the staff gave it gladly, not knowing they had probably just ended their careers in so doing.\u00a0\nI have taken the liberty of scanning some of the most alarming videos, cross-referenced with any incident report where Midoriya was blamed, Nedzu continued. The videos are attached.\nThe email ended there. No conclusion, no wrap up. Just those words, burning their way out of the screen.\nHe scrolled down to the attached video footage. Clicked Clip #1. Clicked play.\nAn group of children beat down Midoriya to the point of collapse in the hallway. A teacher walked past. Glanced at the participants. Kept walking.\u00a0\nClip #2. A blond boy\u2014Bakugo\u2014threw charred papers in a fountain while other children pinned Midoriya against the wall, laughing.\u00a0\nClip #3. Children clustered around a desk, scattering as Midoriya walked in the room. Walked to the desk. Looked at the words scribbled on it and sat down mechanically.\u00a0\nShouta hit pause on Clip #4 as it loaded.\u00a0\nIt was clear already, from less than five minutes of footage, that Aldera Junior High had no welcome for a child born without a Quirk. Why should Midoriya think UA would be any different? Of course Midoryia felt welcome now, now that he had a golden Quirk. But deep down he would think he wasn\u2019t worthy of the admiration of his classmates, of the basic humanity of his teachers. The moment he learned Shouta knew he had been Quirkless, he expected to be expelled.\u00a0\nThis went deeper than fury, deeper than rage. Shouta was supposed to protect his students. Now, to find out Midoriya had suffered institutionalized abuse and expected more of the same from Shouta?\nIt was time to put an end to this.\nIt was time to talk to Bakugo Katsuki.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to talk with me about Midoriya,\u201d he told Bakugo after reviewing all 124 clips. He settled into his foldout chair, scarf poised for action.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to him in training, I knew the fucking nerd could handle an all-out attack\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about training,\u201d Shouta cut in. \u201cThis is about middle school.\u201d\nBakugo\u2019s face twisted, and the boy glanced away. \u201cAlright. You gonna expel me, or what?\u201d\nThis was the second time he had been asked that, today. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, for the second time that day. \u201cThat depends.\u201d\n\u201cDepends on what?\u201d Bakugo asked, voice half-ragged.\n\u201cIt depends on you.\u201d Shouta leaned forward, discarding his exhaustion. \u201cAre you aware what you did to Midoriya?\u201d\n\u201cI fucking hurt him, that\u2019s what,\u201d Bakugo snarled. \u201cI know. I burned him. I see the scars in training, sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Aizawa said.\u00a0\nBakugo glanced up, eyes burning with angry shame. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t burn him,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cYou broke him.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he won\u2019t trust me, because that was the fault of Midoriya\u2019s teachers, not the fault of Bakugo. He didn\u2019t say you were the reason he was bullied at school, because he had seen the other children hurt Midoriya, sometimes worse than Bakugo did.\u00a0\nHe did say you broke him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you have against the Quirkless,\u201d he spelled out, \u201cbut Midoriya has never held anything against you. He has always considered you his friend. He learned to expect abuse from society, from teachers, from classmates. But you were the one who taught him to expect abuse from friends.\u201d\nHe watched the words take. Bakugo sank in on himself, quiet.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t expect kindness from your friends,\u201d Shouta murmured, \u201cyou can\u2019t expect it from anyone. You broke Midoriya\u2019s heart, and that is the strongest part of him.\u201d\nBakugo flinched.\u00a0\n\u201cFortunately for you, Bakugo Katsuki, hearts are like bones. They can heal. Midoriya has done quite a bit of healing, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\nBakugo jerked out a stiff nod.\n\u201cBut like bones,\u201d Shouta went on, \u201ccontinually breaking something makes it more fragile. Break it too many times, and, well\u2014\u201c\nHe stood up. \u201cMidoriya Izuku has some of the most potential as a villain that I\u2019ve seen in any student,\u201d he said, with blunt force. \u201cHe has the charisma, and he has the brilliance, and he has the strong reason to turn his back on society. Do you understand what I am saying?\u201d\nBakugo looked down. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t understand how fucking badly Deku wanted to be a hero.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Shouta said, level, \u201cdon\u2019t understand how many villains wanted to be heroes before society told them they couldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t understand how little it can take for an abused child to snap. I know. I\u2019ve seen it. Rest assured, the fact Midoriya is no villain is fully his decision. You were the one pushing him toward villainy.\u201d\nHe paused to temper his cold rage. \u201cHeroes stop villains,\u201d he said, deadly quiet. \u201cThey don\u2019t create them. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bakugo bit out. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\u201cThen you are on extreme probation,\u201d Shouta said, sinking back into his chair. \u201cIf you could not understand the extent of your actions, you would be out. At my word, you can still be out\u2014not just out of UA, but out of every hero program in the country. Do you know why I let you stay?\u201d\nBakugo, finally, looked up. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThen you are beginning to understand what you have done,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cFirst, you are not expelled because you were a child told that your actions were right.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat is not enough to excuse you. You should have known better. Second, you are not expelled because I have seen you work to change. That is still not enough to excuse you, because you have irrevocably harmed another child. That is what villains do, not heroes.\u201d\nBakugo nodded, tense.\n\u201cThird. Midoriya asked me to not expel you.\u201d\nBakugo let out a bitter little laugh. \u201cOf course he did.\u201d\n\u201cJustice demands you be expelled immediately. Mercy asks you be given one more chance. There\u2019s no mercy in the hero industry.\u201d\nBakugo sunk back in on himself.\n\u201cThere is mercy in Midoriya, though, and that is something I refuse to crush out of him.\u201d Shouta leaned forward. \u201cDo you understand? You are here not because you deserve it, but because I will not let you hurt Midoriya in this final way so long as you do not touch a hair on his head.\u201d\nBakugo was still, and hunched, and silent.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you understand?\u201d Shouta pressed.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Bakugo croaked.\n\u201cGood. I need to talk with Nedzu about the terms of your probation. At the very least, you are not going to be using your Quirk anywhere near Midoriya for the next several months.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe talked to Nedzu next.\u00a0\nNedzu was already halfway through drafting an formal itinerary of offenses when Shouta walked in. He had to give it to the principle\u2014Nedzu did nothing by half measures.\u00a0\n\u201cShouta,\u201d Nedzu said. \u201cHow was your talk with Midoriya?\u201d There was only the slightest hint of irritation in his voice; Shouta had deliberately positioned his time with Midoriya well away from Nedzu\u2019s many cameras in the building. Nedzu lived and died off information.\n\u201cMidoriya is as well off as I expected,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of damage, but there\u2019s a lot of determination to get better. I think he\u2019ll make it.\u201d\nNedzu\u2019s tail twitched. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd the rest was private,\u201d Shouta said evenly. \u201cAsk me about Bakugo.\u201d\nNedzu sighed. \u201cYes, Bakugo. He has a history of bullying. I\u2019ve drafted the expulsion forms for you.\u201d\n\u201cKeep them on file. Don\u2019t give them to me yet.\u201d\nNedzu shuddered all over\u2014the principal\u2019s version of a shock response. \u201cYou aren\u2019t expelling him?\u201d\n\u201cYet,\u201d Shouta said, briefly questioning himself.\n\u201cI have made it a policy,\u201d Nedzu said, slow and careful, \u201cto make every decision as if I have to justify it to the press five years from now. The past few months have shown the wisdom of this approach. Tell me your reasoning.\u201d\n\u201cBakugo was a kid in a broken system,\u201d Shouta said, quiet. \u201cTeachers failed to discipline him, implicitly telling him his actions were acceptable. He hasn\u2019t demonstrated overt intent to harm Midoriya since the battle trials. And Midoriya asked me to give him another chance.\u201d\nHe took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m furious with him. And I\u2019m furious with myself for not noticing before this was spelled out to me. But I work with kids who have potential, and Bakugo has shown potential to be a decent person toward Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cDecision approved,\u201d Nedzu said, voice slightly strained. \u201cI confess I am torn on how to handle Bakugo. Part of me thinks UA should try to reform him so he puts good instead of bad into the world. Another part of me thinks abusers shouldn\u2019t be given second chances, but I am well aware of my bias.\u201d\nShouta thought of the people who ran Nedzu through increasingly painful abuse in the name of science. \u201cIt\u2019s well-founded bias,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. For now, Bakugo gets one chance, then he\u2019s out. I told him as much.\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, I approve,\u201d Nedzu said. \u201cI choose to place my faith in humanity, not brutality. I also choose to make contingency plans for brutality. Tell me the moment Bakugo does anything, and I will launch those plans.\u201d\nShouta nodded.\n\u201cMeanwhile, I would like to speak to the boy on UA\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to bullying,\u201d Nedzu said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have passed the entrance exams should we have known of his past. Send him to my office whenever is convenient.\u201d\n\u201cNow is convenient,\u201d Shouta said, rising. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\nA week later, and Bakugo was in mandatory anger management classes, and out of all hero training classes for two months. A week later, and Midoriya was in school-sponsored therapy and talking almost daily with All Might.\nA week later, and Midoriya was hanging back at the end of class, waving away his friends.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shouta said. The boy was nervous, standing on first one foot, then the other. Was it the prospective audience? \u201cCome to my office, please.\u201d\nMidoriya shot him a relieved glance. \u201cYes, sensei.\u201d\nOne five-minute walk later, and Shouta shut the door on both of them. \u201cAlright, Midoriya. What do you want to talk about?\u201d\nIt was the first time Midoriya had come to him, ever.\u00a0\nThis was new. This was delicate. This was important.\n\u201cYou asked about my Quirk,\u201d Midoriya said, breathing in shakily. \u201cA week ago, you\u2014you asked.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Shouta said, sitting down carefully in his foldout chair. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cMy Quirk,\u201d Midoriya said, combining hesitance and boldness quite efficiently, \u201cis called One for All.\u201d\u00a0\nMidoriya paused, then words came rushing out of him like a breath held too long. \u201cOne for All is a power stockpile Quirk that is passed from one person to the next, building strength as it goes. All Might had it before me. The Quirk was created to counter All for One, and\u2014\u201c\nShouta felt his world dip into ice water. \u201cStop. Midoriya, stop.\u201d\nMidoriya stopped.\u00a0\n\u201cAll Might gave you a Quirk to fight the man that destroyed Kamino Ward at a thought?\u201d he clarified, slow anger rising.\n\u201cWell, he thought All for One was dead when he gave One for All to me, so he didn\u2019t really tell me until later, but then All for One\u2014\u201c Midoriya caught himself in his babbling. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds,\u201d he offered meekly.\u00a0\nNo, it was worse. Yagi was getting dangerously close to grooming a child to run a suicide mission. If it wasn\u2019t for Yagi\u2019s clear love for Midoriya, Shouta would assume as much.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you accept the Quirk?\u201d he asked, shifting topics to delay his anger.\u00a0\nMidoriya\u2019s face went blank with non-comprehension, and he fiddled with his fingers. To a formerly Quirkless child, perhaps the answer was too obvious to warrant such a question.\n\u201cWhy did you want a Quirk?\u201d he asked instead, since a great deal hinged on the answer. Was it repressed bitterness at being a social outcast? Was it the burning desire to be a hero? He could honestly see either one in Midoriya.\nMidoriya\u2019s face cleared, but only a little. He still thought the answer was overly obvious. \u201cI want to save people, sensei,\u201d Midoriya said, his nervous fidgets stilling. \u201cI\u2019m going to help people with or without a Quirk, but with All Might\u2019s power\u2014with my power\u2014I can do so much more.\u201d Midoriya looked up, eyes burning. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the next symbol, and I\u2019m going to make sure people feel they can always be saved. Even the villains. Even the Quirkless kids. Everyone deserves to be saved.\u201d\nEvery once in a while, Shouta would catch glimpses of his students as pro heroes.\nThis was one of those moments. Midoriya\u2019s back was straight, his words sincere, and the room hummed with the sort of electric energy Shouta had learned to expect from Midoriya\u2019s Quirk. More than that, the room shone incandescent with Midoriya\u2019s determination.\n\u201cAnd you expect to accomplish this how?\u201d he asked.\nMidoriya nodded, again a slightly skittish high schooler. \u201cWith you, sensei.\u201d There was real trust in his words, fragile but present. \u201cYou said you wanted to help me, and I realized I couldn\u2019t do this without help.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this, Midoriya?\u201d he asked, shaken with the weight of the revelations. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell me that you broke your arm, a few weeks ago.\u201d\nAnd\u2014there. A hunch of the shoulders, a huddle inwards, and Shouta was faced again with the surface-level middle schooler Midoriya had been. \u201cBecause you listened,\u201d Midoriya mumbled, \u201cand because you believed me. I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t know teachers did that,\u201d Midoriya said through halting words. \u201cBut you do.\u201d\nAldera Junior High was going to burn.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always listen,\u201d he promised, leaning his weight forward. \u201cMidoriya, teachers have a duty of care toward all their students, and I chose you as my student the first day, when I didn\u2019t expel you. Do you remember what I said?\u201d\n\u201cThat I have potential,\u201d Midoriya whispered.\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Shouta said. \u201cDo you remember why you lost my trust?\u201d\nMidoriya startled at the non-sequitur. \u201cBecause I went to get Kacchan out of Kamino Ward,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t trust the adults to handle it,\u201d Shouta corrected. \u201cSo you went to a place you weren\u2019t ready for, and nearly got killed for it.\u201d\nMidoriya blinked up at him, slow comprehension dawning. \u201cYou want to keep us safe by expelling us,\u201d he said.\nAizawa sighed, sharp. \u201cYes.\u201d And Nedzu let him, because Nedzu was aware how fragile a moral line UA walked between raising heroes and raising child soldiers.\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he said, \u201cif I had known how hard it was for you to trust your teachers, I could have helped you sooner. I need you to trust me, or I can\u2019t keep you safe.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not used to being safe,\u201d Midoriya said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m used to helping people. Aren\u2019t heroes people who put themselves in danger to help others?\u201d\nAnd here\u2014here was the crux of the issue. \u201cHeroes put themselves in reasonable danger to save lives,\u201d Shouta corrected. \u201cIt is rarely wise for heroes to throw their lives away to defend someone. The amount of people they could save if they stayed alive is too high.\u201d\nHe watched Midoriya struggle with that.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is something we cover your second year,\u201d Shouta said, the words dragging out, \u201cbut given your class\u2019s exposure to high-risk villain attacks, I think we need to move it up. Listen, Midoriya. It is never worth it to die without good reason.\u201d\nHe thought of the final video clip Nedzu had sent him, the one that made him nearly expel Bakugo on principle alone. If you wanna be a hero that badly, there's a quick way to do it. Believe that you'll be born with a Quirk in your next life and take a last chance dive off the roof!\n\u201cYour life matters,\u201d Shouta breathed, realizing the child before him probably hadn\u2019t heard the words from anyone but his mother before. \u201cMidoriya, if you die to save a person, someone is still dead. That\u2019s still a less than optimal outcome.\u201d\nMidoriya shuddered, shook his head, closed his eyes. \u201cBut people are worth saving.\u201d\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d Shouta said, trying to gentle his fury. \u201cSo are you, Midoriya.\u201d\nHe let the boy process this, Midoriya\u2019s eyes flickering back and forth as his ever so clever brain tried to accommodate the words into his worldview. Clearly, it would take time.\nAizawa would make time.\nRight now, what Midoriya seemed to need was time to process. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for today,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThank you for telling me about your Quirk. It will help me help you.\u201d\nMidoriya nodded, still lost in thought.\nSo Shouta collected up his things, promised Midoriya that he could always come to him, and went to scathe Yagi for not telling him about One for All to begin with.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Bakugo, Midoryia,\u201d Ashido called out, tipping back dangerously far in her chair. \u201cDid you hear they\u2019re closing Aldera Junior High? Wasn\u2019t that where you guys went to school?\u201d\nShouta watched as Midoriya fidgeted, the boy nervous but quietly pleased. \u201cI heard,\u201d Midoriya said, but offered nothing more.\n\u201cGah, you\u2019re no fun,\u201d Ashido said, groaning in despair. \u201cI want gossip! Horror stories! Tell me something interesting, Bakugo.\u201d\n\u201cThe place was a wreck,\u201d Bakugo said. \u201cPeople had no fucking respect for anyone.\u201d\n\u201cYikes,\u201d Kirishima said. \u201cIt must have been pretty bad.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing it\u2019s closing,\u201d Uraraka said, with a quick glance at Midoriya. \u201cYou okay, Deku?\u201d\nMidoriya smiled, starting shy and getting stronger. \u201cNever better.\u201d\nShouta kicked the podium with his boot, catching everyone\u2019s attention. They all turned to look at him.\n\u201cThree seconds to quiet down,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter. Now let\u2019s get on with training you all to be decent heroes.\u201d"
