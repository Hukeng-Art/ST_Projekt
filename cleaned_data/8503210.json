    "text": "They\u2019re not normal, probably. There's dependency issues, for one.\nThe honeymoon phase usually fades. Fresh relationships are always exciting \u2013 there\u2019s this constant burn, a consistent desire to be near the other. Think of the mall couples you see huddling around a Zumiez, or the stoners sucking face in the school bathrooms.\nSo time turns. The honeymoon phase is supposed to pass. Right?\nYuuri finishes the Grand Prix. Viktor continues to coach, and Yuuri finds work right along with him. Time turns and turns and turns \u2013 \nBut they\u2019re still so in love. Just as they were. If anything, it\u2019s snowballed, from something small and delicate, into a ball large enough to swallow them whole. Every day, Yuuri discovers a new meaning to the word love. It\u2019s not so set in stone. It\u2019s not all black and white. Love is a thousand and one shades of grey, and Yuuri has the pleasure of experiencing every single shade, right alongside Viktor.\nMaybe they\u2019re a little over the top. Maybe they\u2019re too shameless. Yuuri confessed on T.V. Viktor kissed him in front of the press. They vacationed in Cancun. They bought a temporary home in Detroit. The traveling doesn\u2019t bother Yuuri so much \u2013 anywhere is home, so long as Viktor is there.\u00a0 (Ha, how cheesy, but it\u2019s true.) \nViktor traveled without him, once.\n\nA small business trip! Scouting some new skaters, you see~ \n\nIt was unbearable. The bed was cold, the apartment was quiet. There was no singing in the shower, no one to cook with. Something churned and twisted so hard in Yuuri\u2019s chest \u2013 a loud ring of pathetic, pathetic, you can\u2019t even be apart for a week. \nIt was the worst five days of Yuuri\u2019s life. It was supposed to be the worst seven days, but Yuuri called Viktor with a soft - I miss you-\u00a0 on day four, and Viktor was home within twenty-four hours.\nSo they travel together now. Holding hands. Taking pictures on the plane and sharing earbuds. Viktor likes to squeeze Yuuri\u2019s thighs \u2013 so squishy!- and Yuuri will pull on Viktor\u2019s ear with a smile.\nThey\u2019re in Moscow when Yuuri wakes up to the sound of Viktor\u2019s alarm buzzing on the bedside table. His phone vibrates against the wood, slightly moving with every zrrrt, zrrrt, zrrrt- \n\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri blindly swats at his naked chest. \u201cViktor, alarm.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a soft grrhrhg from the pillows, before Viktor decides to bury himself in the sheets even more.\nYuuri sighs, palms coming to rub at his eyes. They were up way too late last night, watching an old court case of a guy suing for his own foot.\nThe phone is buzzing closer to the edge of the table, so Yuuri exhales, heaving up into a sitting position. He sleepily crawls over Viktor, pawing for the phone, and hitting the off button. It stops buzzing, and the world returns to normal.\nBut Viktor, suddenly, is quite awake, twisting onto his back and wrapping his strong arms around Yuuri\u2019s torso.\n\u201cHey-\u201c Yuuri laughs.\nViktor sweeps in for a kiss,\u00a0 \u201cGood morning my love.\u201d\nYuuri tips his head back, giggling, dodging Viktor each time he leans upwards, \u201cStop! Your breath is gross.\u201d\n\u201cI want a kiss~\u201d\nYuuri taps his forehead with his finger, \u201cBrush your teeth first.\u201d\nViktor pouts, but the dimple on his cheek is painfully obvious, giving away his desire to smile. Yuuri wiggles up a little, shifting so that he\u2019s lying between Viktor\u2019s legs. Viktor\u2019s hair is sticking everywhichway, some stretching towards the moon, and the others descending into hell.\nYuuri can\u2019t help but giggle, bringing a hand up to push Viktor\u2019s bangs back. \u201cWhat time is the press conference?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cNooooon,\u201d Viktor purrs, still trying to get that kiss.\nYuuri humors him, pausing to let Viktor peck his lips, once twice three times four \u2013\n\u201cIt\u2019s ten.\u201d Yuuri yawns, \u201cShould I make breakfast?\u201d\nViktor gasps, hands sweeping up Yuuri\u2019s sides, fingers long and warm, leaving small imprints in his wake. \u201cWill you make ramen?!\u201d\n\u201cRamen for breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone that can make ramen as well as you~\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. My water boiling skills are quite good, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nViktor laughs at that, swatting Yuuri\u2019s ass playfully, \u201cStop that. I know you make ramen from scrap.\u201d\nYuuri sticks his tongue out, just a little, between his teeth, laughing when Viktor leans up on his forearms, trying to bite it. Yuuri sucks his tongue back into his mouth and rolls, flopping onto the cold side of the bed, and sticking a leg out of the covers.\n\n\u201cGet back here-\u201c \n\n\n\u201cNoo-\u201c \n\nYuuri falls off the bed, but Viktor rolls with him. They\u2019re a big heap of blankets and pillows, limbs everywhere \u2013 but Viktor wins, nuzzling into Yuuri\u2019s neck and smothering his body with his own.\n\u201cWe still have to shower,\u201d Yuuri says, petting his hair.\n\u201cShower together, save water.\u201d\n\u201cSave a horse, ride a cowboy?\u201d Yuuri quotes back.\u00a0\n\u201cOh!\u201d Viktor perks up, \u201cI can be a cowboy!\u201d\nYuuri smothers his face with his hand, \u201cHahaha don\u2019t-\u201c \nViktor does his best American accent \u2013 which is god awful \u2013\u00a0 \u201cHow-day ya\u2019ll-\u201c\n\u201cShower!\u201d Yuuri kicks him, laughing uncontrollably, \u201cBreakfast! Up!\u201d\nViktor does eventually tangle himself out of the comforter and the sheets and the pillows and Yuuri\u2019s legs and his own pajama pants- eventually, key word. Eventually.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yurio pauses, hands balling into fists. \u201cCan you guys lay off each other\u2019s dick for like, five seconds?\u201d\n\u201cYurio!\u201d Viktor gasps, \u201cYou\u2019re only seventeen! You can\u2019t talk like that!\u201d\n\u201cI turned eighteen last month, thanks.\u201d Yurio skates backwards, long ponytail whishing like a horsetail. Yuuri sheepishly shifts away from Viktor \u2013 he\u2019s not the coach, technically \u2013 so he tries to stay out of the way. It\u2019s not really his fault; Viktor was the one who slinked over, and hid his cold hand in Yuuri\u2019s back pocket.\nMila giggles from across the rink, swirling around in circles, \u201cAre you all that surprised?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the top, then.\u201d Viktor claps his hands, \u201cStop talking, start skating.\u201d\nYurio rolls his eyes, standing up to his full height, and skating to the starting point again. He lifts his hands up high, but snarks, \u201cYou weren\u2019t this snappy when you were coaching Yuuri.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he was.\u201d Yuuri replies, shamelessly slinking an arm back around Viktor\u2019s waist.\nYurio rolls his body, keeping his legs strong, \u201cBullshit. Everyone knows how he rewarded you for good work.\u201d\nYuuri would feel mildly embarrassed \u2013 maybe at one point he was, but not anymore. Instead he just feels warm, laughing, Viktor\u2019s chuckle rumbling in his chest.\n\u00a0Viktor grins, \u201cHow did you get such a pottymouth?\u201d\n\u201cA born trait, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Mila teases.\nYuuri shifts harder into Viktor\u2019s side, and exhales when a gloved hand draws circles on his hip.\n\u201cGross,\u201d Yurio says, as he spins.\n\u201cSkate,\u201d Viktor parrots back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they grocery shop together, Yuuri always keeps a firm grip on Viktor\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cOoh! What about this?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a pound of squash, Viktor.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBut look! This one looks like a butt!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cPut it back.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s sometimes a hassle, but the fun outweighs the trouble. Viktor has this way of making anything appear fun, and Yuuri always gets swept along with his smile.\n\u201cLook!\u201d Viktor holds up a bag of minibagels. \u201cThey\u2019re so small!\u201d\n\u201cYurio sized bagels,\u201d Yuuri teases, and Viktor laughs with him.\n\u201cI\u2019m buying them for Yurio.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be so mad.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Viktor pushes the cart along. \u201cHe deserves it, for tying my skates together last weekend.\u201d\nYuuri laughs, dipping his finger in the loop of Viktor\u2019s jeans. \u201cWell, you had it coming. I\u2019d be mad too, if you woke me up at 5 a.m.\u201d\n\u201cIf he wants to win, he has to put in the work.\u201d\n\u201cWithin reason,\u201d Yuuri reminds him. He picks up a jar off the shelf, \u201cAre we out of jam?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, are we?\u201d\n\u201cDid you bring the list?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\n\u201cOne job,\u201d Yuuri teases, and puts the jar in the cart anyways. Viktor shifts, bumping Yuuri\u2019s hip with his own, and Yuuri snorts, smothering Viktor\u2019s pretty face with his palm; they ignore the weird look from the old lady too small for her cart.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nViktor owns a lot of things. Shirts, pants, shoes. Costumes, jewelry. Masks from Africa, dolls from Poland. A cat beanie from New York and a bubble gun from Disneyland. So many things \u2013 and even more, he\u2019s bought for Yuuri.\nAll their homes, in Detroit, Moscow and Japan, are filled with various shiny objects. They\u2019re cool \u2013 like the Bonsai tree growing in the corner of their apartment, or the dog fountain in Russia \u2013 but nothing compares to this.\nViktor\u2019s old shirts from the nineties. They\u2019re gym shirts, over washed and over worn. They\u2019re stretched, the shoulder seams now hitting the bicep, instead of the center front. The graphic has long faded, just little specks of color left on the tee.\nStill, this item smells the most like Viktor, therefore, it is Yuuri\u2019s favorite.\nYuuri won\u2019t say something cheesy \u00a0like -\u00a0he smells like peppermint and tastes like strawberries \u2013 because it\u2019s not true. Viktor in every sense, smells and tastes like a man. Like something deep and distinctly human. But it\u2019s addictive, and it has Yuuri breathing into the shirt collar like a creep.\nViktor is passed the hell out when Yuuri\u2019s stomach decides that it\u2019s hungry. He patters out into the kitchen, snatching Viktor\u2019s shirt off the top of the dirty laundry pile. He\u2019s too lazy to find pants, but does hunt down some slippers, because let\u2019s be honest, Yuuri isn\u2019t ready to face the cold tile floor yet.\nHe closes the bedroom door, flicks on the kitchen lights, and starts hunting around for something to cook. The sun is trying it\u2019s best to crawl through the blinds, so Yuuri shoves them open as he washes his hands at the kitchen sink.\nWaffles, actually, sound the best right now. He heaves out the waffle maker \u2013 they have one that shapes batter into little barn animals, because Yuuri\u2019s impulse buying has worsened since he moved in with Viktor.\nIt\u2019s a soft morning, whisking the batter in a bowl, cracking eggs, listening to the birds outside. It\u2019s spring here \u2013 but when they go back to America, it\u2019ll be winter. Weird, how the earth is round like that.\nJust as Yuuri is pouring the batter into the waffle maker, he hears their bedroom door creak open. Yuuri really needs to fix the squeak \u2013 all it needs is a dab of olive oil, or maybe some wax \u2013\nYuuri is washing out one of the bowls, when sturdy arms fold around his torso. Yuuri doesn\u2019t jump, but he does startle at the warm, minty breath that exhales by his ear.\n\u201cYuuuuuri,\u201d He drawls. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\u201cI got hungry,\u201d Yuuri says. He sets the bowl aside to dry, and grabs another dirty dish, \u201cYou can go back to sleep. We have today off, yeah?\u201d\n\u201cCome back with me,\u201d Viktor huffs, arms tightening, chest pressing up against Yuuri\u2019s back. Yuuri exhales, feeling Viktor\u2019s arms move with his breathing. Viktor is warm and shirtless, like always.\n\u201cWe can eat, then we\u2019ll go back to bed,\u201d Yuuri decides, setting another dish aside.\nViktor gives an unsatisfied hum. He continues to breathe against Yuuri\u2019s neck, fully knowing that it gives Yuuri goosebumps. His hands smooth down the front of his navel, until they reach the hem of the shirt. It barely reaches Yuuri\u2019s ass, so Viktor purrs, \u201cIs this mine?\u201d\n\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I threw this in the laundry basket.\u201d\n\u201cI fished it out.\u201d\nViktor grins against his ear, \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it smells like you,\u201d Yuuri answers, hands washing the same spatula over and over again. Is it clean? He\u2019ll wash it one more time, just to be safe-\n\u201cMy clothes always look so good on you.\u201d Viktor sighs, \u201cWhenever you skate in my costumes, I lose my mind.\u201d\nYuuri smiles, \u201cI haven\u2019t worn your costumes in ages.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget your eros performance.\u201d Viktor mouths against his neck, hands now finding an agenda around his hips. \u201cYour eros has only grown.\u201d\nYuuri is having a hard time responding. Viktor\u2019s hands are pushing up the shirt, fingertips pressing into the squish of his stomach, up and down his navel, so strong but tender. It makes his stomach do flip flops.\n\u201cI\u2019m cooking,\u201d Yuuri replies, too breathily.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re doing a beautiful job, at that.\u201d\nYuuri looks to his hands, where he\u2019s holding just a wet sponge. He shakily reaches to dry off his hands, before gripping the edge of the counter. He eyes the wafflemaker \u2013 but jumps, when he feels Viktor grind against his ass.\nThe mood shifts, just like that, the movement making Yuuri\u2019s blood sink.\n\u201cGod.\u201d Yuuri exhales, \u201cWhat\u2019s got you like that? It\u2019s ten in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Viktor says, unapologetically. \u201cI had a dream about you.\u201d\nYuuri bites back a noise, tightening his grip on the counter, and grinding back against Viktor\u2019s crotch. Viktor\u2019s breath hitches, and his hands suddenly smooth down and around Yuuri\u2019s hips, thumbs brushing past bone.\n\u201cAbout me?\u201d\n\u201cMhmm.\u201d\nYuuri chews on his bottom lip, feeling his skin lightly tingle, everywhere Viktor touches. \u201cA good dream, then.\u201d\nViktor is speaking against his ear, words sounding especially enunciated and wet. It\u2019s such an erogenous zone, that Yuuri\u2019s legs go weak. \u201cYou were on your knees,\u201d Viktor whispers. \u201cBegging for my cock like you needed it.\u201d\nYuuri tips his head, showing off a smooth curve of skin. Viktor immediately dives for it, mouth lightly opening to press sloppy wet kisses down to Yuuri\u2019s shoulder, where the oversized shirt has slipped.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a dream.\u201d Yuuri jokes, swallowing hard. \u201cA memory, more like.\u201d\nThe noise Viktor makes is so hot, needy and whiny, sexy enough for blood to rush south \u2013 fast enough to make Yuuri dizzy.\nViktor slurps against his neck, making Yuuri laugh, before he turns to nibble on the bumps leading down his spine. Viktor\u2019s mouth is always so sinful; it\u2019s never ashamed, never hesitant. He licks behind Yuuri\u2019s ear, grinds against his ass, pushes Yuuri so far forward, that his crotch presses into the edge of the counter. \u00a0\n\u201cAh.\u201d Yuuri bites, head lolling.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so soft,\u201d Viktor tells him. \u201cI like how your skin feels after you sleep.\u201d\n\u201cNn, that, that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cIt does to me!\u201d Viktor beams, hands slipping down to squeeze Yuuri\u2019s ass through his boxer-briefs. The shirt is a wrinkly mess, pulled in every direction, over stretched and lightly damp from the spray of washing dishes.\nViktor\u2019s hands don\u2019t stop, sweeping up his chest, thumbing into his stomach. He\u2019s fully hard, and he\u2019s shameless in the way he grinds into Yuuri\u2019s backside, and kisses beneath his ear.\n\u201cHh, Viktor,\u201d Yuuri breathes. \u201cWe\u2019re in the kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\"The food will be done soon.\u201d\n\u201cNn.\u201d\n\u201cIf they burn, I might kill you,\u201d Yuuri jokes, but Viktor is crafty, twisting Yuuri around halfway, just enough to kiss him. Yuuri makes a surprised mmh! \u2013 noise, but soon submits, falling into the long, open mouthed kiss. Yuuri turns around the rest of the way, slinking his arms around Viktor\u2019s neck, just to pull him closer. \u201cRude,\u201d he kisses.\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you wait?\u201d Yuuri says, hypocritically, threading his fingers through Viktor\u2019s hair and tugging on the strands.\nIn reply, Viktor heaves Yuuri up by his thighs, setting him on the counter a few inches to the right of the sink. Yuuri inhales \u2013 why manhandling is such a turn on, Yuuri will never know \u2013 but in turn, he kisses Viktor, tongues slippery and soft as they taste the other. It\u2019s a little messy \u2013 different, from their soft, gentle kisses in bed \u2013 but it\u2019s good. With Viktor, it\u2019s always good.\nYuuri is blatantly hard; at least Viktor has sweatpants on. Yuuri is straining against the boxer briefs, hard just from the breath against his ear, and the mouth that was previously against his neck. Viktor knew it was a weak spot. He knows every button on Yuuri, every weakness.\nBut Yuuri isn\u2019t an idiot. He knows how to turn Viktor into a puddly mess. So as payback, he kisses Viktor hard, pulling at his hair, keening against his lips and rutting against his hip. Viktor lets out this surprised noise, palms hitting the counter with a loud slap.\nYuuri yanks Viktor\u2019s head back, giving himself just enough room to latch onto his lower neck and suck.\n\u201cYuuuuri,\u201d Viktor whines, shifting, \u201cAh, god-\u201c\nYuuri is sloppy, mouthing up his neck, across his cheek, sucking on his lower lip and opening his eyes just to watch Viktor\u2019s long eyelashes brush his cheeks.\n\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Viktor exhales, pressing closer. \u201cYuuri, we gotta\u2019 do something now, or I\u2019m not gonna\u2019 make it.\u201d\nYuuri laughs, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go jerk off in the shower, if you don\u2019t wanna-\u201c Viktor presses their foreheads together. \u201cBut I\u2019m soo hot Yuuri. Feel, feel-\u201c\nViktor brings Yuuri\u2019s hand against his crotch, and yeah, yeah. Yeah, he\u2019s really hard. Yuuri exhales, shifting a little on the countertop. Their breath is warm, ghosting across the other, but it only adds to the tension winding in the air.\n\u201cFive seconds.\u201d\u00a0 Yuuri exhales, looking at his timer. \u201cIf you can grab the lube in five seconds, I\u2019ll let you fuck me before the waffle timer goes off.\u201d\nViktor\u2019s face lights up, dark eyes suddenly swirling bright. Yuuri grins, mouth opening to whisper, \u201cOne.\u201d\nViktor jolts, turning on his heel and booking it toward the bedroom. Yuuri counts, \u201cTwo.\u201d\nThere\u2019s rustling from the drawer.\n\u201cThree.\u201d\nYuuri jumps off the counter, fiddling with the waistband of his briefs. \u201cFour.\u201d\nViktor skids back around the corner, jumping on one leg as he tries to take off his sweats. Yuuri giggles, tongue forming, \u201cFive-\u201c \nBut Viktor grips him by the hips, turning him around and bending Yuuri over the counter. Yuuri gasps, the strong movement making his knees go weak, and his head spin. That\u2019ll probably be hot, like, for forever. Yuuri is suddenly very, very aware of how badly he wants to be fucked against this kitchen counter. To be filled up like a wine glass. To be lost to everything Viktor is.\nThose hands. Those long, slender fingers. They\u2019re quick and rushed, tugging down Yuuri\u2019s underwear, and tossing them somewhere.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay with this?\u201d Viktor asks, breathily and forced.\n\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri turns his head.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d He leans forward, body trapping Yuuri against the counter. Yuuri, in turn, leans close enough to see every shade of blue in Viktor\u2019s eyes. They\u2019re hovering, lips barely touching, the world swirling around them.\n\u201cI want you to fuck me as hard as you can,\u201d Yuuri says, without wavering.\nThe look in Viktor\u2019s eyes is priceless \u2013 that\u2019s all the\u00a0O.K. \u00a0he needs.\nA hand presses down on Yuuri\u2019s upper back, and another flicks open the lube. Yuuri stays where he\u2019s told, forehead pressing into the granite, as wet hands spread his ass, and fingers prod at his hole. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s anything new, but the intrusion still makes Yuuri jump. It feels fine, but does little to burn the need simmering in Yuuri\u2019s gut.\n\u201cAll your fault,\u201d Yuuri says, jokingly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take all the blame,\u201d Viktor purrs, and god. God, his voice is so deep. It suddenly fills the room. Makes the kitchen seem a lot smaller than it actually is.\nHis fingers are deft, circling his entrance, teasing before pushing in, and pulling back out. It\u2019s dull, until Viktor starts twisting his fingers, rolling them in patterns that aren't fair.\n\u201cFaster, Viktor,\u201d Yuuri groans.\n\u201cI will, love.\u201d Viktor thumbs across his hole, and rumbles, \u201cBut you know how I love that voice of yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to beg?\u201d Yuuri asks. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\nHis fingers graze slow, slooow, against his rim, and Yuuri\u2019s voice chokes.\n\u201cFuck, nevermind, god, please-\u201c\nViktor laughs, digging his index finger in hard, \u201cLouder, baby.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cPlease. Christ, please.\u201d His voice echoes, pitch rising,\u00a0 \u201cViktor. Viktor.\u201d \n\u201cGetting you like this,\u201d Viktor\u2019s fingers screw in, \u201cis my favorite thing. Subject to none else. As beautiful as skating.\u201d\n\n\u201cNnn!-\u201c \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sucking me in,\u201d Viktor observes, voice smooth but shallow. Like it\u2019s full of disbelief and arousal. Three fingers press in \u2013 and yep, there\u2019s the burn, but it\u2019s wet and smooth and his fingers are curling, god, they\u2019re curling, and Yuuri is losing his mind.\nIt always starts this way. Viktor begs first, whining, needy \u2013 and then he flips them. Like a sweet metal coin, turning Yuuri into the wet mess. It\u2019s some kind of reverse phycology that Yuuri has no time to look into.\nViktor angles right, and Yuuri\u2019s forehead smacks against the countertop.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Viktor mumbles to himself. He presses in hard, and Yuuri shouts, body arching higher up on the counter.\n\u201cAhh! Ah, fuck.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a hot wave, a thick, winding snake, that rushes through Yuuri\u2019s blood. He\u2019s close, he\u2019s close-\nViktor pulls out, and Yuuri feels his cock bob between his legs. So close, so-\n\u201cAs hard as I can, you say\u2026.\u201d Viktor whispers. Fingers squeeze the flesh of his ass. Legs kick his thighs farther apart.\n\u201cKeep me from walking tomorrow,\u201d Yuuri mumbles, this time with a grin \u2013 because Viktor chokes a little, thumbs digging harder into Yuuri\u2019s thighs.\nViktor shoves his own tight-fitting underwear down beneath his ass, the fabric pulling taut. The first grind of bare skin on skin is killer; Yuuri wishes he had something to hold on to, other than the lip of the countertop.\nViktor worms the head of his cock in first, the stretch welcomed, Yuuri's body remembering Viktor beautifully. Yuuri expects the soft rock in, the slow thrusts, until Viktor is buried deep \u2013 except what he gets is a full thrust, hard, thighs meeting thighs. Yuuri makes a noise? More like a scream, actually. His right hand flies up to the back wall, bracing his palm against the tile, as Viktor pulls out halfway, and slams back in.\nYuuri\u2019s mouth is permanently open, because sweet Jesus, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s a rough slide, but the angle couldn\u2019t be any better, with one leg hiked up higher than the other, due to Viktor\u2019s palm. His flexibility is a gift, in this sense.\nViktor might be saying his name, but Yuuri isn\u2019t sure. As soon as Viktor builds up a steady rhythm, Yuuri\u2019s ears rush with blood.\nWith every thrust, the nails in his thighs dig harder. Viktor\u2019s pants are everywhere, hot and wet against Yuuris neck, saying words too complicated for Yuuri to understand. Instead his brain narrows in, focuses only on the burning between his legs, and the way he just feels full. Fuller than ever.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a tease, with the rhythm so fast. Viktor keeps thrusting against his prostate, and it feels so good, that Yuuri\u2019s body is too overwhelmed to come.\nHis nails are scratching at the wall, and the granite. He\u2019s drooling, he\u2019s begging. His body thrums, thrusts back, begs and arches and just becomes worthless.\n\u201cMhh! Vi-ahh- Viktor please. Fuck, fuck.\u201d Yuuri rambles, \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019, I- I gotta-\u201c\nHis stamina is shit this morning; but its just too much. Everything, the hands, the lips, the cock up his ass.\u00a0\n\u201cHold on just a little longer,\u201d Viktor says, free hand slipping around his navel. Yuuri\u2019s cock jumps with just the slight movement, excited at the thought of Viktor giving him any attention at all. Ahh, but it\u2019s not what he wants, because the hand wraps around his base and squeezes.\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Yuuri shrieks, body trembling. Viktor is ramming in, skin slapping, so consistent and good like a piston- and Yuuri is there. Hanging off the edge by a string. Cut the string! Let him go!\nBut Yuuri has no control \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want it, really. His cock pulses harder, just with the idea that Viktor is controlling him so. Using him, and loving every second.\n\nSo good Yuuri. \n\n\nBeautiful. \n\n\nPerfect. \n\n\nSoft, wet, tight- \n\nIt\u2019s too much. The words feel malleable, but that hand, it\u2019s squeezing Yuuri\u2019s cock painfully, ripping him back, making his throat rev like a jet engine.\n\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Viktor all but sobs. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d\nAnd Yuuri\u2019s vision whites, and darkens. Turns a thousand colors, dick bobbing in Viktor\u2019s hand. His voice is screeching, way, way too loud, because he needs to come, needs to right now, he\u2019s so hot, he\u2019s sweating, he\u2019s trembling, he\u2019s-\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing beautiful.\u201d Viktor rumbles, hips slotting up, and hesitating. \u201cYour, ah, your voice.\u201d\nYuuri\u2019s tongue feels too big for his mouth. He leans up on his tiptoes, thrusts into Viktor\u2019s hand, begs- \nAnd Viktor\u2019s pace increases, every slap sending Yuuri higher up on the counter, until both hands are pressed against the wall, and his right foot is toeing at the handle of the drawer.\n\u201cTogether,\u201d Viktor tells him. \u201cTogether, baby. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, please,\u201d Yuuri shakes.\n\u201cWant, ah, want me to pull out?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Yuuri bites, \u201cInside, please-\u201c \nViktor groans, a long, drawn out noise that makes Yuuri keen and whine. Suddenly the fist around his cock begins to move, and Yuuri feels so good, he can\u2019t even moan.\nHe says nothing when he comes, eyes screwing shut so hard, he gives himself an instant headache. His orgasm is brutal, clenching around the cock in his ass \u2013 the one pressing up against his prostate, nailing him time and time again. Viktor is so good to him, kissing his neck, fucking until he\u2019s trembling, gripping Yuuri with a strength unparalleled.\nViktor\u2019s harsh exhale sense Yuuri into a round of aftershocks- he feels Viktor come, fingers shaking as they press into Yuuri\u2019s skin.\nYuuri\u2019s world is spinning. His balls ache, from nearly coming his brains out. Viktor lets go of his cock, and Yuuri exhales a hard sigh of relief. Viktor pulls out slowly, and Yuuri nearly gets hard again, just from feeling his cum seep out his ass, and down his leg-\n\nBeep! Beep! Beep! \n\nThey both startle, heads whipping over to the waffle maker. It\u2019s beeping instantly makes them jump, Yuuri accidentally hitting his knee on the countertop. Viktor yanks up his underwear, and hobbles over to the waffle maker, pulling the plug, and ending the beeping.\nThe kitchen smells like waffles now, rather than the smell of sex \u2013 which Yuuri isn\u2019t sure if he misses, or not. He\u2019s still trying to catch his breath, still trying to come back to his body, for goodness sakes.\nViktor is the first one to break out into a small giggle, reaching for a towel off the oven, and wetting it by the sink, \u201cYou\u2019re a mess, baby.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Yuuri exhales, head dipping back down \u2013 his knees feel like jelly, but Viktor wraps a strong arm around his hips, and wipes softly between his thighs.\nIt then becomes Viktor\u2019s job to carry Yuuri to the living room, serving the waffles up on plates before they crawl back into bed, and snuggle all day.\u00a0\nYou couldn't seperate them if you tried.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is fucking ridiculous,\u201d Yurio grits through his teeth.\n\u201cNo, I got it,\u201d Yuuri shifts, the jacket pooling around his wrist, off his shoulder-\n\n\u201cJust stop holding hands and-\u201c \n\n\u201cNever.\u201d Yuuri and Viktor say together, as they stand on the street corner, trying to make miracles happen. With the sun, came a sudden heatwave, and they\u2019re too petty to let go of the other\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re both older than me.\u201d Yurio deadpans, eyes rolling to the sky. \u201cGod, why did you do this to me?\u201d\n\u201cI almost got it,\u201d Yuuri twists \u2013 the light turns green and Yurio leaves them behind, walking across the street with his hood pulled up.\nViktor starts laughing \u2013 Yuuri is still trying to roll out of the sweatshirt, while walking, and suddenly it\u2019s a goddamn circus act.\nYurio turns and barks, \u201cStop! It\u2019s literally impossible.\u201d\nWhen they step up on the curb, Viktor lets go of his hand, for just one single second, long enough for Yuuri to take off the sweatshirt and sling it over his shoulder.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here,\u201d Yurio continues to talk. \u201cWhy am I thirdwheeling? Why do I hate myself this much?\u201d\n\u201cKeep talking, and you\u2019ll pay for your own ice cream,\u201d Viktor jokes, slapping Yurio on the back. Yurio tenses, like a bird ruffling its feathers, but the promise of ice cream is still too good of an incentive \u2013 even for a twenty year old, because lets be honest, the moment you don\u2019t care about free ice cream, is the moment you lose all childlike wonder.\nThey swing their hands as they walk, because Yurio continues to pace ahead, and the onlookers are nothing but flies on the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeciding to get married isn\u2019t the tough part \u2013 that was a no brainer.\nDeciding where to get married is a whole other deal. So many people with opinions, so many who say Russia! Japan! The beach in LA! Come to the Thailand! China!\nIt\u2019s a thousand headaches packaged into one; the stress of organizing something suddenly so big makes Yuuri want to barf, maybe, but Viktor\u2019s hands are always a godsend, smoothing down his back and making the tension melt out like a forgotten chocolate in a car door.\n\u201cI can see the wheels turning in your head,\u201d Viktor grins, snuggling into his side. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on up there?\u201d\n\u201cToo much,\u201d Yuuri sighs. He opens up his arm, and Viktor shifts over, and under it. Silvery hair rests against his shoulder, and the weight is more comforting than Yuuri ever gives it credit for. Hands come down to squish his thighs, and Yuuri finds himself lost in the movement, studying Viktor\u2019s finely manicured nails.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be married to you,\u201d Viktor says, almost soft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a paper,\u201d Yuuri seeks out his hand, and Viktor takes it. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything will change.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026but\u2026\u201d Viktor turns Yuuri\u2019s hand over, and traces across his ring finger, \u201c\u2026there\u2019ll be a nice little band here that says mine.\u201d\nYuuri laughs, turning to smother his giggles in Viktor\u2019s hair. \u201cEveryone already knows about us. It\u2019s old news by now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for my own benefit,\u201d Viktor explains. \u201cI get to parade around as yours too, you know.\u201d\n\u201cMm, I guess that is a plus.\u201d\nViktor grins and squeezes Yuuri\u2019s hand, once again bleeding out the tension left there. Yuuri sighs, and bonks their heads together affectionately.\nThey really can\u2019t stand to be apart \u2013 but with the wedding, it becomes easier. There\u2019s something about that wedding band that brings comfort. Something that says you\u2019re mine and I\u2019m yours, even when we\u2019re thousands of miles away. \nIt\u2019s still hard, when Viktor leaves on away trips, and Yuuri gets into teaching tiny babies how to ice skate- the distance almost hurts. But rather than a scorching, painful burn, it\u2019s just a dull ache of a promise; we\u2019ll be back together soon. \nYurio still calls them pathetic, and maybe they are.\nOr, maybe, they\u2019re just really really really in love.\nEither is fine with Yuuri."
