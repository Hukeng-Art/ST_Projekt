    "text": "Lan Wangji sold himself for a good price, all told. As the leaders of all the great sects and all the finest cultivators in the land stood or sat stiff-backed and thin-lipped in the cramped war tent, the Yiling Patriarch sat in a loose sprawl, drinking liquor from the bottle, and promised them the defeat of the Wen sect. The destruction of Wen Ruohan\u2019s puppets. Revenge.\n\u00a0\nThe cultivators \u2013 lean from hunger, their sects decimated, the wolves of defeat biting at their heels \u2013 listened to his promises eagerly. Everyone knew what the Yiling Patriarch could do. Everyone hoped he would deign to do it for them.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch touched his mouth to the bottle, thoughtful. Then he exhaled, and lowered it. The cultivators waited in silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll I want in return,\u201d he said finally, pointing one elegant finger at Lan Wangji, \u201cis him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji, seated at his brother\u2019s side, stiffened. He had not expected to be noticed by anyone at this meeting. He was here to support his brother and no more. He looked at the Yiling Patriarch, who looked back with malice and mirth in his dark eyes, and did not understand why his heart thudded as if a fist had closed around it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHim?\u201d One of the other cultivators spoke up, incredulous. \u201cWhat do you want with Second Young Master Lan?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch smiled. He looked as young as people said, perhaps no older than Lan Wangji himself, but there was a cunning in the shape of his smile and the lazy, deliberate way he held himself, insulting the men around him without words.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s the prettiest of all of you,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said, rubbing a thumb back and forth over the lip of the liquor bottle as he gazed at Lan Wangji with heavy-lidded eyes. That look was deliberate too. A goad and a promise. \u201cI\u2019d like to see how he looks spread out under me.\u201d A beat. \u201cI want to fuck him, just to be clear.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe understood, Yiling Patriarch,\u201d Lan Xichen said tightly, even as Sect Leader Yao and Sect Leader Ouyang roared in outrage. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid my brother\u2019s honour is not for sale.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen I\u2019m afraid my help isn\u2019t for sale either,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch replied easily. \u201cAnd really \u2013 you all act so offended. Would you complain so if I\u2019d asked for one of your daughters or sisters in marriage? At least three of you have tried to ally with me before by flinging your girls at me, don\u2019t pretend you haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe gave one of the minor sects heads a significant look. The man spluttered in red-faced anger. Then he began shouting at the Yiling Patriarch, and a few more cultivators joined in, too enraged for sense.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji had been sitting in utter silence, all through this. Now, he thought of the day Cloud Recesses burned; of the ache in his leg, which had healed but not easily and not without scars that would never leave him. He breathed through the nameless panic twisting through him.\n\u00a0\nHe smoothed his robes flat with his hands and looked back at the Yiling Patriarch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are not offering marriage,\u201d Lan Wangji said. He did not shout. He was not inclined to shouting. But his voice was as clear as any Jiang clarity bell, and quelled the other cultivators into sudden silence. \u201cMarriage provides long-term benefit. What you offer does not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think seeing the Wen clan fall would provide you all a lot of long-term benefit,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said. \u201cBut never mind that. Do you want to marry me, Second Young Master Lan?\u201d the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s voice was mocking. \u201cDo you want to wear red and be my bride? I don\u2019t think you\u2019d like a lifetime on the Burial Mounds.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExplain your terms,\u201d Lan Wangji said.\n\u00a0\nHis brother lay a hand upon his arm. Said, \u201cThere is no need to explain your terms. With respect, Patriarch. My brother is not for sale.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, but does your brother agree with that?\u201d The Yiling Patriarch cocked his head to the side. \u201cDo you think a month in my bed is too high a price for the survival of Gusu Lan, Second Young Master Lan?\u201d\n\u00a0\nEven six months ago, Lan Wangji would have been furious at those words. No one had any right to speak so about him \u2013 about anyone. But the war had beaten the hard edges of his rage and his pride and left him remade. Dented. Less and more than he had once been.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cI do not.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThere was more arguing. A great deal more arguing. Lan Xichen was adamant that Lan Wangji would not be sold. But the war had been so long already, and the sects were withering, and the Lan clan no longer had the clout it once possessed.\n\u00a0\nIn the end, the deal was made. And the Yiling Patriarch smiled once more, and said, \u201cHere. I\u2019ll entrust this to you, Lan Wangji, and you alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s name had been given to the Patriarch, in the course of the negotiations. Lan Wangji had not learned his in return.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch stood. The Patriarch was lean, but there was the promise of future broadness in his shoulders, and the hand he held out to Lan Wangji was firm and strong, long-fingered.\n\u00a0\nOn his palm lay a ribbon. Red as blood.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWear it as a collar,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said softly. His eyes were fixed upon Lan Wangji. \u201cAnd a weapon. Wear it to war, and you won\u2019t fail. I vow it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji took the ribbon from him. He wound it around his own throat, and felt it slither into place, binding into a knot as if tied by an unseen hand. The Yiling Patriarch nodded approvingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the Burial Mounds when this is over,\u201d he murmured. He did not touch the ribbon, but his voice was a caress that travelled through it all the same \u2013 a strange, fiery thing that wound hot through the band of tight silk.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nWhen Lan Wangji went to war \u2013 when the Wen puppets fell one by one before him, as if the power that fed them had been cut at the source \u2013 he remembered the heat of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s voice against his skin. The curve of his mocking mouth.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji did not like to be mocked, and yet. And yet.\n\u00a0\nHis brother arranged for him to meet with one of the Lan healers, a woman who explained to Lan Wangji in excruciating detail what was involved in lying with a man. She gave him two vials: one full of healing salve, and the other with a slick substance, thicker than oil. To ease the way, she told him, and Lan Wangji barely resisted the urge to blush. His ears burned. He tamped down his own embarrassment and took the vials from her, with murmured thanks.\n\u00a0\nThe war continued. He ignored the looks of pity from other cultivators. The way their eyes fixed on his neck \u2013 on the slash of red upon it, blood-bright. A claim and a wound.\n\u00a0\nHe told himself that this was, in a way, no different from how the daughters of great cultivation sects were bartered for power. He had as much choice, if not more, as any woman told she must marry for her sect\u2019s survival. If his reputation suffered from this, it would be of no true consequence to his future at Cloud Recesses. He would be able to return to his clan. His family would honour and love him. He would perhaps never marry, but he would have a home and purpose. He had no reason to be afraid.\n\u00a0\nHe reminded himself of this, on the day when Wen Ruohan finally died and the cultivation world broke into celebration \u2013 as his brother stared at him with wet eyes, devastation and relief both written into the shape of his jaw, his mouth. My honour is a fair price for this.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor this, I would have given anything. \n\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Lan Wangji!\u201d The Yiling Patriarch sounded delighted. \u201cMy gift worked then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji nodded. He lowered his small pack of belongings to the ground and bowed. Around him, the Burial Mounds were dark, even though beyond the barriers of the Patriarch\u2019s domain, the sun shone. The Patriarch\u2019s people \u2013 the cultivators and normal folk who had made bargains with him, and offered their eternal service in return for their heart\u2019s desires \u2013 watched him from the doors of their small homes. Lan Wangji tried not to look at them as he bowed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am here,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cAs promised.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said approvingly. He bounded across the ashy ground, as light on his feet as a boy. He looked into Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \u201cYou look exactly how I remember.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDo I still please you, then? Lan Wangji thought of saying. But he did not. It was the kind of bravado he did not possess. His strength lay in silence. \u00a0The Yiling Patriarch looked him over leisurely, more calculating than lecherous, reading Lan Wangji\u2019s body language, his clothes, his skin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI took in some of the Wen sect survivors,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said casually. \u201cSo don\u2019t try and attack any when you meet them, hm? They\u2019re just farmers. Children. The odd healer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will be respectful,\u201d Lan Wangji said, hearing the stiffness of his own voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d the Patriarch said again, soft. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Now. Follow me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nIt was quiet in the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s own rooms. Lan Wangji followed him in without a word, adding nothing to the quiet. Waiting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you still willing to fulfil your debt?\u201d the Yiling Patriarch asked. He loosened his robes, though he did not remove them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am willing,\u201d Lan Wangji said. His voice was already hoarse, simply from the sight of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s throat. The shape of his shoulder, partially bared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe war is won,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said. \u201cYou could have refused to come here. You could still refuse me. What could I possibly do about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA great deal,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cI imagine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch laughed. Then he threw himself back onto the bed, a sprawl of limbs and dark robes. The red ribbon was a splash of bright blood against his hair. He looked at Lan Wangji, eyes creasing as his mouth curled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t drag you into my bed,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch murmured. \u201cI won\u2019t make you lie under me. But I think you\u2019re an honourable man, Lan Wangji. And you made a vow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji bowed his head in acknowledgement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst,\u201d the Patriarch said. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji crossed the room. Sat upon the edge of the bed. But the Patriarch crooked a finger at him, urging him closer, and Lan Wangji held his courage fast and crawled across the bed, until he was leaning over the Patriarch, framing the Patriarch\u2019s body with his own.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch was still smiling. But this smile was small. Almost a secret.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow,\u201d the Patriarch said softly. \u201cKiss me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji hesitated only momentarily. Then he lowered his head, brushing his mouth against the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s own mouth. The man\u2019s mouth was soft. The touch of his lips made Lan Wangji\u2019s own mouth feel oddly alight, warm. Lan Wangji repeated the motion, lips brushing lips, then raised his head. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that what you call a kiss, Lan Wangji?\u201d the Yiling Patriarch asked. But the mocking edge to his voice was blunted, more curious than cruel. \u00a0His breath fluttered against Lan Wangji\u2019s lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Lan Wangji said in return. He kept his eyes on the Patriarch\u2019s own. \u201cI have not kissed anyone before. You must teach me, Patriarch, how you best like to be kissed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, so polite,\u201d the Patriarch murmured. He raised his hand up. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cLike this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe guided Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth. Lips against lips. Firmer this time, then firmer still, as he coaxed Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth open, flicking his tongue against Lan Wangji\u2019s own, drawing him closer. Lan Wangji mirrored him. They kissed and kissed, the tension in Lan Wangji so taut that he could not stand it a moment longer.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji bit the Patriarch\u2019s lower lip. Sucked it, softly, insistently, between his own teeth. Something, he thought. You must do something. \n\u00a0\nThe change was sudden. The Yiling Patriarch groaned, gripping him by the jaw, by his hair. Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead ribbon was knocked askew; his hair ornament was tugged free and flung away. It clattered against the floor. Their mouths parted, and then the Patriarch\u2019s teeth were on his throat, sucking bruises around the red ribbon he\u2019d given to Lan Wangji to seal their vows. The Patriarch shoved up Lan Wangji\u2019s robes; unlaced his trousers, deft and impatient; shoved them down, away -\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait,\u201d Lan Wangji said sharply, and the Patriarch paused as Lan Wangji fumbled, dragging off his first layer of robes. His second. He drew out the vial of slick. Shoved it unceremoniously into the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s hand, as he removed his trousers too, reduced to nothing but his inner robe.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch raised his eyebrows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow good of you to come prepared,\u201d the Patriarch said. And then he was all movement again: shoving Lan Wangji flat beneath him. Drawing Lan Wangji closer, until Lan Wangji\u2019s legs were spread around him, his inner robe nearly open, exposing a sliver of his chest, his thighs. He watched as the Patriarch poured slick over his fingers; as his clean hand pushed the robe open, leaving Lan Wangji\u2019s cock, his parted legs, bare to the Patriarch\u2019s eyes. His touch.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch looked into his eyes as he pressed his hot palm to Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. Lan Wangji\u2019s breath shuddered out of him. He heard the Patriarch mirror his exhale. Saw those eyes darken.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch\u2019s fingers curled. Tightened around him. And then he was moving his hand up and down Lan Wangji\u2019s hardness; pressing his thumb into the slick of his pre come, circling the head of his cock, sliding his thumb down the heat of him, using it to soften the friction of his skin against Lan Wangji\u2019s skin.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji did not move his hips. Did not groan. He did everything in his power to keep his face blank, as the Yiling Patriarch watched him and touched him, gazing at him with a hunger that was fathomless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you will use me, Patriarch,\u201d Lan Wangji said, dangerously close to begging for something he could barely allow himself to understand, \u201cthen use me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is use,\u201d said the Yiling Patriarch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour bargain was to\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji could not bring himself to say it, even now, with the Patriarch between his thighs. To fuck me. \u201cNot \u2013 this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou really are innocent,\u201d the Patriarch laughed. \u201cBut here. I\u2019ll take pity on you. Never say I\u2019m not merciful, Lan Wangji.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe moved his fingers \u2013 those long, callused fingers \u2013 down beneath Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. Against the furl of his body. Two of them, together, slid into him.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s breath hitched. His body tensed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow does it feel, Lan Wangji?\u201d The Yiling Patriarch\u2019s voice was like silk; like the knot of red at Lan Wangji\u2019s throat, stealing the air from his lungs. \u201cTell me how it feels.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs if,\u201d Lan Wangji forced out, \u201cthere are fingers inside me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe fingers inside him stilled for a moment. Then the Patriarch laughed, low delight, and began moving them again. \u201cWere you making a joke, Lan Wangji?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am not known for my humour,\u201d Lan Wangji managed to say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you known for?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRighteousness,\u201d Lan Wangji said promptly. Another finger joined the two inside him. He forced himself to breathe as sensation welled through him. \u201cScholarship. Honour.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSuch boring things to be known for,\u201d the Patriarch said. \u201cI think maybe you\u2019re known for the wrong things, Lan Wangji. I think you have more anger and joy in you than people know. Am I right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nYou do not know me. Lan Wangji almost bit out the words. Instead he looked at the Yiling Patriarch, unblinking even as he was spread open, prepared. He looked, and let the flint in his gaze speak for him.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch nodded solemnly, as if Lan Wangji\u2019s look had imparted some great knowledge. He curled his fingers, and Lan Wangji shuddered, pleasure like a knife rocking through him. His hips squirmed. His hands twisted into fists.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d the Patriarch said, satisfied. And did it again. And again.\n\u00a0\nBy the time the Patriarch considered him ready, Lan Wangji was left in nothing but his forehead ribbon and the band of red cloth at his throat. He felt the Patriarch\u2019s hand slide up his throat; felt one of those fingers hook gently beneath the red ribbon, drawing his head up. He was achingly hard. His whole body felt desperate, as if his skin were itching, burning with pleasure. He did not know what to do to alleviate the feel of it. He couldn\u2019t touch himself, couldn\u2019t bring himself to the swift ease of climax. All of this, he had promised this to the Yiling Patriarch.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch kissed him. Lan Wangji made a small sound against his mouth. The Patriarch held him up for the kiss for a long moment, bruising his mouth sweetly. Then finally he released him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShh,\u201d the Patriarch murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll ease it, Lan Wangji.\u201d His hands stroked over Lan Wangji\u2019s thighs. \u201cI know what I\u2019ve made you need. I\u2019ll see this through.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was not a small man, but neither was the Patriarch. He lifted Lan Wangji\u2019s hips, muscles in his arms corded. Lan Wangji was still open, slippery from the Patriarch\u2019s fingers. He couldn\u2019t have resisted the press of the Patriarch\u2019s hips, the blunt pressure of his cock, even if he had wanted to.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t want to resist. He was overwhelmed, want radiating through him like spilling light through shadow. He was furious with the Patriarch in a way he couldn\u2019t explain, angry and shamed and alight and more aware of his own flesh than he had been in a lifetime. He felt every inch of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s cock stretching him wide, spreading him open. It hurt but it was a good hurt, a claiming.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji reached for his cock, a noise breaking out of him \u2013 hungry, desperate \u2013 as the Yiling Patriarch pushed his hand aside and grasped Lan Wangji\u2019s cock himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere you are, Lan Wangji,\u201d he crooned. \u201cYou feel so tight around me. So good. Will you wrap your legs around me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji should have refused. Should have ignored him. Instead he lifted his legs, wrapping them around the Yiling Patriarch, ankles touching as the Yiling Patriarch fucked him deep and stroked his cock with steady, delicious pressure.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d said the Patriarch. And Lan Wangji clenched his eyes shut. It was unbearable. It was shameful. It was -\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d the Patriarch told him, and Lan Wangji did. Seizing, back arching, body alight.\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch fucked him through the aftershocks, a feral smile on his mouth.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch took him again that night. Rolled him onto his back and grasped his wrists and slid into him, fucking him roughly, teeth against the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. He felt even bigger like this, and Lan Wangji was sensitive, sensitised to the feel of the Patriarch\u2019s cock.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji came untouched.\n\u00a0\nIn the morning, Lan Wangji should have been too sore to be touched, but he was grateful when the Yiling Patriarch opened him gently, easing him into arousal with his plush mouth around Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. When Lan Wangji was biting his own tongue to stop himself from begging, the Patriarch slid into him. Used him, face to face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t come yet,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch crooned, rocking into Lan Wangji with excruciating slowness. \u201cNot yet, Lan Wangji.\u201d He touched a palm to the ribbon at Lan Wangji\u2019s throat. \u201cNot yet. Sweetheart.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was still furious with him. But he had spent his life parched, thirsty for touch, for praise, and the Yiling Patriarch was pressing it all to Lan Wangji\u2019s lips.\n\u00a0\nHe moaned, helplessly. Obeyed. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThe Yiling Patriarch could not fuck him all the time, so Lan Wangji occupied his free time helping in the fields, or caring for the smaller children who lived in the Burial Mounds. A few remnants of the Wen sect had made their own pact with the Patriarch, and had survived the war under his care, as he\u2019d warned Lan Wangji. But Lan Wangji held no ill toward them, and in turn, their wariness soon melted into kindness.\n\u00a0\nOne of the Wen survivors was a small child, a chubby and cheerful little boy who liked to cling to Lan Wangji\u2019s leg and babble stories at him. Lan Wangji grew fond of the boy quickly, and played with him often under the fond, watchful gaze of the boy\u2019s grandmother.\n\u00a0\nEvery day when he finished his work, he returned to the Patriarch\u2019s room. And every night, the Patriarch came to him, and took him.\n\u00a0\nOne night the Patriarch was late. Lan Wangji bathed leisurely \u2013 washed his properly for the first time in days, giving it the laborious attention it required, to see all the knots unravelled.\n\u00a0\nAfter he\u2019d bathed, when he drew on his inner robe, his damp hair loose against white cloth, the Patriarch found him and very swiftly crossed the room. There was no pause between his arrival and his hand gathering up the weight of Lan Wangji\u2019s hair like a leash.\n\u00a0\nThe Patriarch pressed him down onto the bed \u2013 pushed Lan Wangji\u2019s face against the sheets with the gentle pressure of his fingers against Lan Wangji\u2019s wet hair. Said, \u201cLan Wangji, let me, like this.\u201d He sounded wrung out, desperate, even though Lan Wangji had done nothing, even though they had fucked only that morning, the Patriarch pinning Lan Wangji\u2019s wrists to the bed as he used Lan Wangji\u2019s thighs, slippery with oil, pressed tight together for his pleasure.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji let himself be held down. The Patriarch grasped him by the backs of his legs, drawing his lower body up, shoving his thighs wide. Lan Wangji was open to him, exposed. He felt the Patriarch\u2019s hair brushing his thighs \u2013 felt the heat of his breath, where he was spread open \u2013 his mouth \u2013\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji was grateful that the sheets swallowed up the sound that escaped him then. His hands clenched to fists against the bed. It was so strange: the slick, coaxing warmth of the Patriarch\u2019s tongue against him, the heat of his lips, the coldness of his saliva when the Patriarch breathed out a low, reverent moan against him. And yet it made fire radiate through him, pulse in him like a wave dragging his good sense under. Lan Wangji gasped out again, airless, and his body raised up to meet the Patriarch\u2019s mouth without his say so. That made the Yiling Patriarch laugh, a fond and hungry sound against the furl of Lan Wangji\u2019s body. New heat shot through him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch said tenderly, then kissed him open. Long, slow, languorous. \u201cThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re so sweet Lan Wangji. Do you want my fingers? My cock?\u201d Another lick. The brush of a finger, tugging him open, making room for the Patriarch to kiss him deeper. \u201cOr more of my mouth?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPatriarch,\u201d Lan Wangji gasped out.\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause. Lan Wangji\u2019s felt nothing but his breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy name is Wei Ying.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cCourtesy name, Wei Wuxian. But you, Lan Wangji \u2013 you should call me Wei Ying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji groaned, almost sobbing with need. He felt as if he could not control his body, his voice. But ah \u2013 he loved it. He didn\u2019t know how he would give this up. How could he wants this so much, to be touched, used, loved? \u201cWei Ying, please. Anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d the Yiling Patriarch \u2013 Wei Wuxian \u2013 said reverently. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe brought Lan Wangji to orgasm with his mouth and his tongue. And in return, Lan Wangji lay between his legs upon the bed and sucked his cock, hungry and artless, as Wei Wuxian stroked his hair tenderly, possessively, and called him good. So good.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian. Wei Ying.\n\u00a0\nPerhaps it was that \u2013 the offer of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s name \u2013 that made Lan Wangji feel brave enough to speak openly. To ask questions he had kept stoppered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnything you demanded, the sects would have provided,\u201d Lan Wangji said, feeling the chill of the rumpled sheets around him \u2013 the weight of the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhy did you ask for me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want the honest answer?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine.\u201d Wei Wuxian lay back flat, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cI was thrown into the Burial Mounds as a boy. My parents had died. I was hungry. I stole from a merchant. He caught me. He thought this was a suitable punishment.\u201d His voice was flat. \u201cI should have died. The Burial Mounds don\u2019t allow anyone to leave. Living or dead. But as I curled up and cried the dead\u2026 spoke to me. They said, Wei Ying. Would you like revenge? Will you make a bargain with us? I said yes, of course. And they gave me power. And I gave them a piece of my humanity in return. It wasn\u2019t a bad price.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence. Lan Wangji let them horror rise in him and dissipate. He knew the Yiling Patriarch was not entirely as other people were. He should not have felt any grief, to hear it confirmed.\n\u00a0\nWhat would Wei Wuxian have been, with his soul and his heart whole and unhurt?\n\u00a0\n\u201cI asked the Burial Mounds once, why they spared my life,\u201d Wei Wuxian said finally. \u201cThey told me, because we wanted your heart. It was that simple. Want.\u201d He turned his head. Looking at Lan Wangji. \u201cI wanted you,\u201d he said, as if it were that straightforward. And perhaps for a child raised by the dead, moulded by darkness, it was. \u201cSo I took you. That\u2019s all. Is that what you wanted to hear, Lan Wangji?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen Lan Wangji said nothing, Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth curled bitterly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nBut Lan Wangji\u2026\n\u00a0\nHe was sifting through words, like a man sifting through sand for flecks of gold. Wei Wuxian had answered him. Wei Wuxian had told him \u2013 so much. More, perhaps, than he had intended.\n\u00a0\nMy heart isn\u2019t my own, Wei Wuxian had told him, in the spaces between his words. My heart belongs to the dead. \n\u00a0\n\nBut I wanted you regardless. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI wanted you.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI want you.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI want your heart.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Lan Wangji said finally, and watched the bitterness of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth freeze. Soften. \u201cMy courtesy name is Lan Wangji. But I am \u2013 Lan Zhan. To you. If you so wish.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated. He blinked at Lan Wangji, oddly vulnerable. \u201cYes. I do \u2013 wish. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji nodded. Took Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand in his own, and kissed his wrist, letting the tenderness well up in him. Wei Ying. This was his Wei Ying. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji continued to make friends with the residents of the Burial Mounds. He taught A-Yuan the small moral tales taught by the Lan clan to child disciples.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian joined them. Cajoled Lan Wangji into teaching him the Lan rules. \u201cThree thousand?\u201d he squawked. \u201cLan Zhan, how can you possibly remember three thousand rules?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is not difficult, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji said serenely, even as A-Yuan grinned and covered his face with his hands, aware that Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian were teasing one another. \u201cBut you must not despair. I am aware your memory is \u2013 lacklustre.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLacklustre,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated. He gasped in mock offense, sitting down on the ground beside A-Yuan, who giggled and leaned against him. \u201cTeach us, Lan Zhan. We\u2019ll see who has a lacklustre memory.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian did not learn even a hundred rules. But he did whisper the ones he\u2019d remembered against Lan Wangji\u2019s skin, when Lan Wangji rode his cock that evening. Lan Wangji insisted. One roll of his hips for every correct recitation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d Wei Wuxian said in the end, voice wrecked, his face flushed, as Lan Wangji refused to move, teasing Wei Wuxian with the clench of his body. \u201cI can\u2019t-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen I will teach you, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji said, body hot, aching. He pressed his mouth to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear, reciting the sect rules in a steady rhythm that matched the movement of his hips. He reached twenty before Wei Wuxian groaned, and clutched his hips, coming inside him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLacklustre,\u201d Lan Wangji said, touching his mouth to Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and swallowed Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter as he came around Wei Wuxian, heart bright enough for both of them.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\n\u201cA month has passed,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji knew. When he\u2019d woken in the morning there had been no sign of Wei Wuxian. So Lan Wangji had dressed. Packed his bag. Waited. And Wei Wuxian had returned, face impassive, almost cold, the faint bitterness of liquor shining on his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to go, Lan Wangji,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, when Lan Wangji was silent. \u201cOur bargain is done.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cThe ribbon,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji raised his hand. The red ribbon loosened from his throat as if it had been waiting for the touch of his hand. He removed it. Held it out to Wei Wuxian, who took it. Their fingers brushed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he said. He cupped Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d There was something in Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice. Something vulnerable, and dark. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wish to make a bargain,\u201d said Lan Wangji.\n\u00a0\nA beat of silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpeak,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji released him. He reached up and removed his forehead ribbon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou may have this,\u201d Lan Wangji said, holding the blue-white ribbon in his palm. \u201cThe Lan forehead ribbon can only be touched by family. A child. A spouse.\u201d He saw Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWith it, you will gain the Second Young Master Lan as your husband. He will remain with you in the Burial Mounds. He will have \u2013 heart. And soul. Enough for you, and for himself.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice splintered, a little, at the end. He had too much hope in him to keep it steady.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what,\u201d Wei Wuxian said shakily, \u201cmust I provide in return?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYourself,\u201d Lan Wangji said simply. \u201cAll that the Burial Mounds has not claimed, you give to me.\u201d His heart was pounding. \u201cI promise what you give me, I will protect. With all that I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian stared at him. And stared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill you accept my bargain?\u201d Lan Wangji asked.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian swallowed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Wei Wuxian leaned forward, kissing Lan Wangji intently and fiercely, lovingly, as Lan Wangji tied the forehead ribbon around his pale throat.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nEvery six months, Lan Wangji made his way to Cloud Recesses. He carried Wei Wuxian with him, in ribbons red and black bound to his wrists and ankles and his throat, and braided through his hair. The weight of them comforted him, as he entered his brother\u2019s own chambers, and kneeled down.\n\u00a0\nLan Xichen looked troubled. He did not offer Lan Wangji his usual beaming greeting, or tea, or any food.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe sects are planning to siege the Burial Mounds,\u201d Lan Xichen said. His expression was firm, jaw tight. \u201cWangji, I am afraid the Yiling Patriarch will not be able to fight their combined might. I am afraid you will no longer be safe there. I have argued with them, but they will not be moved.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji\u2019s alarm faded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey will not be able to harm my husband,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will merely harm themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWangji.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA ribbon from his hands turned the tide of the war,\u201d Lan Wangji reminded his brother.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat ribbon.\u201d Lan Xichen\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t cultivated a reputation as a thief of virgins, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position, Wangji.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe will not be taking any more cultivators,\u201d Lan Wangji said placidly. \u201cI can promise that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe sects won\u2019t be so easily convinced.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat is no matter,\u201d he said dismissively.\n\u00a0\nHe was not afraid of the sects. He belonged to the Burial Mounds now, and knew there was power older, darker and greater than anything the great cultivation sects had ever known in that place. He held to the teachings of his youth, but Wei Wuxian did not.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian would burn them all, in the dark fire, before he saw a single denizen of the Burial Mounds harmed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Yiling Patriarch will not be defeated by Sect Leader Jin or Nie or Ouyang. He has more than a ribbon now,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cMore than his dark cultivation. More than the power that lays within him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLan Wangji thought of the bruises hidden beneath the collar of his robe. Thought of his husband\u2019s smile as they lay in bed together at dawn, trading kisses. Wei Wuxian had been splintered, but Lan Wangji had made him whole. Every day, Wei Wuxian grew more human. Every day, in turn, Lan Wangji\u2019s power stretched, the gold of cultivation seeping into darkness, as if dusk, deep and strong, lay within him. Together, they were more than they were alone.\n\u00a0\nHe allowed himself the faintest smile, as he met his brother\u2019s eyes, blazingly sure of his husband\u2019s strength. Of his own.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe has me.\u201d"
