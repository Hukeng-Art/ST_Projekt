    "text": "\u201cHow much for a night with you?\u201d\u201cFive Galleons,\u201d Harry says, turning towards the guy who just slipped onto the bar stool beside him. The voice sounded weirdly familiar, which doesn\u2019t make much sense. Most of the people Harry knows aren\u2019t even alive yet.Harry almost chokes on his own spit. He would have recognized that face anywhere.Tom Riddle raises an eyebrow, somehow managing to convey confusion and concern at the same time. Harry averts his eyes. He was never good at hiding his emotions, and Riddle caught him on the wrong foot.\u201cThis is my free night, though,\u201d Harry lies. \u201cSorry.\u201dHe\u2019s not going to have sex with a twenty-year-old Tom Riddle. He won\u2019t sink that low.\u201cHm. Not even for twenty-five Galleons?\u201dHarry swallows. That\u2019s a lot of money. It should be enough to finally afford that new coat he will need for the winter. And yet, Harry hesitates. He can\u2019t risk changing the future. He still hopes he will, somehow, find a way to return to his friends. It\u2019d be stupid to risk that just because he doesn\u2019t want to freeze.But why should Riddle sleeping with some whore change history? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201cAlright,\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cBut only if you pay for the room.\u201d***\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t want me to do?\u201d Harry asks when Riddle closes the door behind them.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me below the waist unless I ask you to.\u201dHarry blinks. That\u2019s an odd request.\u201cAnything you don\u2019t want me to do?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says and starts listing off all the things he won\u2019t tolerate, half-expecting Riddle to interrupt him halfway through and walk away. He wouldn\u2019t be the first one to do so. But Riddle just listens intently and nods at the end of it.\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201dHarry shrugs out of his robes, trying not to think about the absurdity of the situation. It doesn\u2019t really work. That\u2019s not exactly a surprise, of course, considering that he is about to have sex with a guy who will turn into a mass murdering lunatic.Soon, they are both naked, and Riddle crawls into the bed, beckoning Harry to follow him. Riddle pulls Harry against him, chest to back, and it\u2019s a shock to feel how smooth and warm Riddle\u2019s skin is. After pulling the blankets over them, Riddle exhales softly, and Harry relaxes his muscles consciously.Riddle lazily moves a hand over Harry\u2019s chest and stomach, rubbing his nose softly against the back of Harry\u2019s neck. Harry shivers and leans his head forward slightly to give him better access. The corners of his mouth move upwards into a small smile. Who would have thought that Riddle enjoyed foreplay and such gentle foreplay at that?Riddle moves his nose from Harry\u2019s neck to his shoulder. His soft exhale gives Harry goosebumps of the pleasant kind. Harry moves slightly backward, pressing his back more firmly against Riddle\u2019s chest. It\u2019s been ages since he felt so warm and comfortable. He already dreads the moment Riddle will inevitably get tired of cuddling.Riddle\u2019s hand stops moving above Harry\u2019s heart, and he digs his fingernails into Harry\u2019s skin, gently enough not to hurt. Then Riddle replaces his nose with his lips and kisses his way from Harry\u2019s shoulder to his neck. Harry lets out an encouraging hum once Riddle reaches his neck and licks the sensitive skin there before moving lower to tease Harry\u2019s collarbone.Harry twists in the hold Riddle has on him. \u201cThat tickles.\u201dRiddle laughs quietly, a sound jarring enough to make Harry blink. Then he presses his lips so softly against Harry\u2019s collarbone that it feels like all of his bones are turning into goo, leaving him lax and malleable.The hand pulling on Harry\u2019s shoulder doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, and yet Harry seems incapable of suppressing his disappointment. Apparently, he\u2019d been more touch-starved than he realized \u2014 which is ironic since he spends a lot of time touching people out of necessity.Harry doesn\u2019t fight it when Riddle turns him around and pulls him against his chest, face to face this time. Riddle\u2019s eyes flicker over his face. It\u2019s impossible to miss the thoughtful glint in them.Riddle pushes a hand into Harry\u2019s hair, and Harry\u2019s eyes almost slip closed as Riddle caresses his scalp. There\u2019s something oddly relaxing about it.\u201cLook at you,\u201d Riddle murmurs, pressing his lips to Harry\u2019s temple. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect. You know that, don\u2019t you? You know exactly what you\u2019re doing to me.\u201dHarry frowns slightly as Riddle presses soft kisses all over his face, getting closer and closer to Harry\u2019s lips. He has no clue what Riddle is on about, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be the best moment to mention that. So he just hums and parts his lips slightly when Riddle finally reaches his lips.Riddle\u2019s lips are incredibly soft. Softer even than Ginny\u2019s and Cho\u2019s had been. Harry exhales shakily through his nose and hesitantly returns the kiss.This has to be the gentlest kiss I ever got.While their lips move against each other, barely even touching, Riddle pulls his hand out of Harry\u2019s hair and moves it down his back, along his spine. Riddle\u2019s fingers stop right before the swell of Harry\u2019s arse before slowly moving upwards again. Harry shivers and presses himself more firmly against Riddle, the friction of his hard nipples against Riddle\u2019s chest more than a little distracting.When Riddle brushes his tongue against Harry\u2019s lips, he opens his mouth on instinct, eager to get more of this, to be held and caressed and kissed until he forgets who and where he is.After what felt like an eternity, Riddle presses one last kiss to Harry\u2019s lips before he draws back and pulls Harry\u2019s head against his chest. Harry presses a few lazy kisses against Riddle\u2019s warm skin and closes his eyes. He wants to take a moment to enjoy this warm, fuzzy feeling inside of him before Riddle inevitably moves on to the main event of the night.***When Harry wakes up, he\u2019s alone. That in and of itself isn\u2019t surprising, of course. Most of his clients leave after a few rounds. The confusing part is that Harry and Riddle didn\u2019t even get to the first round. Harry must have nodded off against Riddle\u2019s chest. Harry lets out a frustrated hiss and bites his swollen lips.Well, that\u2019s certainly one way to avoid paying. I should have known Riddle wouldn\u2019t have that much money to spend.Harry rolls onto his side and freezes.There are ten stacks of coins on the bedside table, each consisting of five Galleons. It\u2019s ten times as much as he usually gets from his customers and twice as much as Riddle and Harry agreed on.Harry rolls back onto his back and stares at the ceiling for a long moment. Then the corners of his mouth start twitching, and before he knows it, he\u2019s grinning like a madman.\n\u201cHow many times do I need to repeat myself? Choking is off the table. End of story.\u201dLestrange cocks his head. \u201cYou want to drive up your price, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ll have to work on your poker face, baby. I can see right through you.\u201dHarry digs his fingers into his thigh to keep himself from snapping back. Lestrange is one of his best clients. It\u2019s not a good idea to offend him if he can avoid it.\u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019t agree even if you gave me a thousand Galleons. There are a few things I simply won\u2019t do \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t give you one of my kidneys, either, for example.\u201dLestrange wrinkles his nose. \u201cWhy would I want a kidney?\u201dHarry blinks. Are kidney transplantations not a thing in the wizarding world? Do they have other methods to deal with kidney failure? Some kind of potion, maybe?\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is-\u201cHarry breaks off when he feels something touching his leg. Is that\u2026? Yes. It\u2019s Lestrange\u2019s hand. Harry narrows his eyes.\u201cNo touching without paying.\u201dIt\u2019s a rule Harry had to repeat more than once in the past. Most of his clients are purebloods who are used to getting whatever they want. It\u2019s important to set clear boundaries if he doesn\u2019t want them to walk all over him.\u201cOh, you\u2019ll get your five Galleons, don\u2019t you worry. And how about an additional five Galleons for a little bit of choking? You have such a slender, delicate neck. I know you\u2019d look gorgeous with my hands wrapped around your throat.\u201d Lestrange pauses to let his eyes wander over Harry\u2019s worn-out cloak. \u201cYou could certainly use the money, anyway.\u201dHarry reaches down to rip Lestrange\u2019s hand off his leg and tell him to fuck off when Lestrange\u2019s face suddenly turns pale. Before Harry can grab Lestrange\u2019s hand, he yanks it back and jumps to his feet. Murmuring something about a calming draught he forgot to put under a stasis charm, he walks away without even glancing back once.Harry stares after him, at a loss for words. What the fuck just happened?He\u2019s about to look around for someone else who might be willing to pay him for his services when someone slips into the booth across from him.Harry stares at Riddle for a long moment. Then his eyes slowly wander to the door Lestrange disappeared through and back to Riddle\u2019s face.\u201cDid you just scare off my client?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t know how to take no for an answer.\u201d\u201cYou-\u201c Harry takes a deep breath to keep his temper under control. \u201cI can take care of myself. I don\u2019t need you or anyone else to do that for me.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019d like that, though, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d Harry asks, a little impatient.\u201cSomeone to take care of you. To give you everything you need.\u201dHarry feels like rolling his eyes. Why does everyone assume whores like to have sex all the time? It\u2019s just a job, nothing more.\u201cFine,\u201d Harry says, sighing. Riddle paying a whore to make out with him a second time - or even multiple times - shouldn\u2019t be enough to change the future, right? \u201cIt\u2019s the least you can do after robbing me of my potential client. I\u2019ll even give you a discount since you gave me such a huge tip last time. How does three Galleons sound like?\u201dIt\u2019s still a pretty high price if Riddle is only after cuddling again \u2014 but Harry won\u2019t count on that. Maybe he just didn\u2019t feel like waking Harry up last time, or he nodded off himself. Who knows? Either way, if Riddle is always such a generous tipper, Harry can\u2019t afford to piss him off or reject him out of principle.Riddle looks at him weirdly for a moment before his expression turns smooth and even. Unreadable.\u201cSounds fair.\u201d***This time, Riddle doesn\u2019t tell him to take off his clothes. Instead, he gently pushes Harry against a wall only seconds after Harry closed the door behind them. Riddle cups his cheek with one hand and uses the other to trace Harry\u2019s lightning bolt scar with a fingertip. The sensation sends a shiver down Harry\u2019s back. Just like last time, Riddle\u2019s hands are gentle and soft.\u201cHow did you get this?\u201dHarry smiles slightly. He can\u2019t help himself. The question is too ironic. \u201cSomeone tried to kill me.\u201dRiddle pulls back slightly, his eyes flickering over Harry\u2019s face. Then he leans forward, brushes a kiss against Harry\u2019s scar, and starts kissing his way across Harry\u2019s face, down his cheek, all the way to his chin. Harry holds still, feeling\u2026 weird.By now, he\u2019s used to people staring at his scar. Even after he found himself in the past, he had caught a few looks, probably because the shape is so unusual. He\u2019s used to people staring at his scar but not to being touched, let alone kissed, there. Even Ginny had avoided touching his forehead. He had never resented her for it, of course. His scar was a constant reminder of what Voldemort was capable of. It was only natural that she didn\u2019t like that part of Harry\u2019s body.When Riddle kisses the corner of his mouth, Harry pushes the thoughts aside and starts focusing on what\u2019s happening right in front of him. He buries a hand in Riddle\u2019s hair and exhales shakily through his nose when Riddle\u2019s lips brush against his for the first time. After a few seconds, Harry brings up his other hand and lays it against Riddle\u2019s back, moving his fingertips along Riddle\u2019s spine, assuming that he\u2019ll like it just as much as Harry did. Judging by Riddle\u2019s encouraging hum, Harry assumes he\u2019s doing something right.Riddle runs his hands along Harry\u2019s side, teasing him, causing Harry to alternatively lean into Riddle\u2019s touch and away from it. There\u2019s only so much gentleness Harry can take before it becomes overwhelming, after all.After a while, Riddle deepens the kiss, and Harry groans, wrapping an arm around Riddle\u2019s middle to pull him closer. The small part of his brain that is still capable of thinking wonders if this would feel just as good if he weren\u2019t so touch-starved. The other part of his brain doesn\u2019t care, too focused on basking in the pleasure of being held and caressed.When Riddle moves his hands to Harry\u2019s thighs and picks him up, Harry instinctively wraps his legs around Riddle\u2019s waist so that he doesn\u2019t lose his balance. Riddle carries him to the coach in the corner of the room without breaking their kiss once. Under other circumstances, that alone would have been enough to impress Harry.When Riddle sits down on the couch, they do break their kiss for a moment, and Harry rearranges his legs so that they are on either side of Riddle\u2019s thighs. It\u2019s impossible to ignore the erection pressing against his arse this way. Harry instinctively starts grinding against Riddle\u2019s boner, only to blink when Riddle grips his hips to hold him still. Confused, Harry draws his head back slightly to look Riddle in the eyes.\u201cAlright,\u201d Harry says, blushing when he realizes how wrecked his voice sounds. Heck, his voice usually doesn\u2019t even sound that hoarse after giving a drawn-out blow job. \u201cNo moving, then.\u201dRiddle smirks as if he knows what Harry is thinking and leans forward to nib at Harry\u2019s jawline. Harry leans his head back, gasping, as Riddle licks his way along Harry\u2019s neck to his collarbone. Harry whines, burying his hands in Riddle\u2019s cloak. He didn\u2019t even know he was that sensitive there. It\u2019s almost painfully hard to hold still and allow Riddle to lick and nib at his skin.And it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s painfully hard.After what feels like half an eternity, Riddle nibs at Harry\u2019s skin one last time before drawing back. Riddle looks at him for a long moment, drinking in his sight. Harry can imagine what he must look like, skin flushed, hair disheveled, and breathing heavily.\u201cDo you want to cum?\u201d\u201cYe-\u201c\u201cThe truth, Harry.\u201dHarry blinks, frowning slightly. Riddle\u2019s voice sounds weirdly serious, given the circumstances. Harry leans back and takes a moment to consider the question. With a jolt, he realizes that the answer is a loud and resounding yes \u2014 not just because he\u2019s so hard it actually hurts but also because he wants to see how Riddle will drive him over the edge. Will he be just as gentle when it comes to the sexual side of things?\u201cYes. I\u2019d like that very much.\u201dRiddle smiles, the expression weirdly endearing.\u201cAlright then,\u201d Riddle says and picks Harry up to carry him to the bed.\nOnce on the bed, Riddle waves his wand, and their clothes disappear. Only then does he crawl on top of Harry, nuzzling his neck. Harry arches into the touch, feeling Riddle\u2019s erection brushing against his thigh. Normally, he would have reached down to give his client what he paid for, but he suppresses the impulse. Last time, Riddle didn\u2019t want to be touched below the waist, and given how he reacted to Harry grinding against him, that doesn\u2019t seem to have changed. Either way, Harry doubts Riddle will hesitate to order him around if there\u2019s something that bothers him.Riddle moves downwards, kissing Harry\u2019s neck and chest. Harry buries a hand in Riddle\u2019s hair, letting out little sighs and encouraging hums that he doesn\u2019t even need to play up. Riddle\u2019s muscles twitch as Harry moves a hand along his back. Does that mean Riddle isn\u2019t used to being touched gently? Or is he just sensitive? Harry supposes it doesn\u2019t matter.He\u2019d half-expected Riddle to push him onto his stomach once he freed them of their clothes, convinced that his patience had to run out at some point. But apparently, he\u2019s miscalculated Riddle. He doesn\u2019t seem to be in a rush at all.Harry gasps when Riddle\u2019s lips reach his left nipple, and he brushes his tongue over the tight little nub, sucking lightly. Then Riddle moves his head back the slightest bit, pulling at Harry\u2019s nipple with his lips in such a sweet, endearing way that Harry digs his fingernails into Riddle\u2019s back.Once he realizes what he\u2019s doing, Harry loosens his grip immediately, mortified. Riddle is obviously after gentleness, after soft touches and easy affection, and Harry has nothing better to do than to destroy that just because he doesn\u2019t know what to do with all of that tension building up inside of him.\u201cAh, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201cRiddle licks over Harry\u2019s nipple, his tongue significantly rougher than his lips, before drawing back slightly to look Harry in the eyes.\u201cNone of that,\u201d he says quietly, brushing away the hair from Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cI want to see your raw, honest reactions. If you feel the desire to scratch me from my neck all the way down my back, then feel free to do so. The only way you can displease me is by putting on an act. Understood?\u201dRiddle waits until Harry nods before leaning forward to brush his lips against Harry\u2019s, his tongue sliding against Harry\u2019s briefly. Then he leans down to suck on Harry\u2019s other nipple.Harry whimpers, pulling Riddle closer. After hesitating for a moment, Harry digs his fingernails into Riddle\u2019s upper back again. The tension needs to go somewhere, and he\u2019s not desperate enough to rub his erection against Riddle\u2019s stomach. Not yet, anyway.It doesn\u2019t take long until his nipples become so sensitive that the slightest touch becomes enough to send jolts of pleasure straight to Harry\u2019s dick. Eventually, Harry can\u2019t take it anymore, and he arches his back, gasping when his cock brushes against Riddle\u2019s stomach.\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry whines, pulling at Riddle\u2019s hair. At this point, Riddle\u2019s dark hair looks almost as messy as Harry\u2019s.Riddle takes Harry\u2019s nipple between his teeth, pulling on it gently, and Harry whimpers, actively rubbing himself against Riddle\u2019s stomach now.\u201cTom, please. Don\u2019t make me beg.\u201dRiddle raises his head, smiling, and Harry catches his breath. In this very moment, Riddle looks like the hottest guy he has ever seen with his disheveled hair, his swollen lips, and the glint in his eyes. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s getting paid for this.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Harry. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201dRiddle licks his way down Harry\u2019s chest and stomach, moving faster than Harry would have assumed \u2014 so he\u2019s probably growing a bit impatient, after all. Harry can see Riddle\u2019s erection bouncing between his legs from the corner of his eye.Harry pulls his knees towards his chest when Riddle gets closer to his crotch, his fingers shaking from the anticipation running through his veins. To his confusion, Riddle lays his hands on top of Harry\u2019s kneecaps and gently pushes Harry\u2019s legs back down onto the mattress. Harry leans up on his elbows just in time to catch Riddle licking his lips, his eyes fixed on Harry\u2019s cock.And before Harry has time to mentally prepare himself, to even realize what\u2019s about to happen, Riddle leans forward and licks over Harry\u2019s glans. Harry inhales sharply, falling back onto his back.\u201cOh god,\u201d Harry gasps as Riddle licks him again, taking Harry\u2019s cock into his mouth this time, teasing him expertly with his tongue. \u201cOh god, oh god, oh god.\u201dHarry digs his nails into the sheets, raising his hips slightly against his will, and Riddle takes the hint, taking him all the way to the roots. Harry gasps for breath, shivering uncontrollably. He can feel his orgasm approaching rapidly. Riddle pulls up slightly only to move down again, taking him into his throat with ease.Harry curls his toes, his hips twitching, urging him to thrust into the warm and willing wetness. It\u2019s all he can do to hold still.\u201cTom,\u201d Harry gasps after a few more blissful seconds of this. \u201cI\u2019m about to cum.\u201dRiddle keeps moving his head as if he didn\u2019t hear him.\u201cTom!\u201dRiddle hums, maybe to show that he did hear Harry after all. Harry whines, his eyes rolling upwards, the vibration against his cock enough to push him over the edge. The pleasure is so all-consuming that he barely even feels his cock twitching, shooting its load down Riddle\u2019s throat straight into his stomach.Harry must have blacked out for a moment because the next thing he feels is a body pressing against his side and soft, soft lips moving all over his chest.\nWhen Harry wakes up, he instantly knows that something isn\u2019t quite right. He feels a lot warmer than usual, and his blankets are significantly heavier. It doesn\u2019t take him long until he realizes why. Riddle is lying sprawled across his chest, his nose buried in the crook of Harry\u2019s neck, his soft breath against Harry\u2019s skin causing him to shiver slightly.For a long moment, Harry just glances down at Riddle\u2019s dark, slightly disheveled hair. Then he grins.Well, at least I wasn\u2019t the only one who fell asleep this time. On instinct, Harry buries a hand in Riddle\u2019s hair, delighted by how soft it feels even after a whole night of\u2026 kissing? Making out?Frowning, Harry caresses Riddle\u2019s scalp, tightening his grip slightly when Riddle sighs against his neck. What exactly were they doing last night, and the first time Riddle hired him, for that matter? It didn\u2019t feel like a normal business transaction. No, it was more as if\u2026As if Riddle pretended that I was his boyfriend.The thought causes Harry to stop moving his hand around in Riddle\u2019s hair. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? The vast majority of his clients couldn\u2019t care less if Harry feels good. They only care about satisfying their own desires. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, isn\u2019t it? Otherwise, there would be no reason to involve money.But Riddle had decided that it was worth paying for this. How odd.Absently, Harry notices that he has brought up his other hand to move it along Riddle\u2019s spine, his muscles twitching under Harry\u2019s fingertips every now and then.Riddle is exceptionally handsome. Harry even noticed that as a twelve-year-old. And, if anything, Riddle looks even hotter now than he did four years ago as a sixteen-year-old. He should have no problem finding someone willing to make out with him for free. So what reason could Riddle have for paying him?Why am I even thinking about this? Why should I care? This is an easy - and even enjoyable - way to make money. Harry leans down to kiss Riddle\u2019s forehead when he feels Riddle stirring slightly on top of him. As long as I don\u2019t risk changing history by doing this, I see no reason to put an end to it - that is, if Riddle even wants to hire me again. This is the second time I fell asleep before we got to the part where I pleasure him, after all.\u201cMorning,\u201d Harry murmurs, nuzzling the side of Riddle\u2019s head. To his surprise, Harry notices that it doesn\u2019t bother him how deeply Riddle presses him into the mattress with his weight. He likes it, even. Riddle\u2019s body is like a barrier, like a shield between Harry and the rest of the world. Harry rolls his eyes at the absurdity of his own thoughts.I can\u2019t allow myself to forget who I\u2019m dealing with. Riddle is dangerous. He\u2019s capable of committing horrendous crimes.Riddle raises his head off Harry\u2019s chest and glances down at him through lidded eyes. Harry can\u2019t help but find the sleepy, unguarded look on Riddle\u2019s face endearing.\u201cMorning,\u201d Riddle murmurs and leans down to rub his nose against Harry\u2019s collarbone before glancing at the clock on the wall. \u201cI need to get to work soon. But first, I have a proposition for you.\u201d\u201cWork?\u201d Harry asks, incapable of keeping the surprise out of his voice. Does he mean Borgin and Burkes? Harry tried to stay away from the shop as much as possible because he couldn\u2019t remember when, exactly, Riddle worked there. Well, I suppose there is no reason to keep doing that anymore, now that I have already caught Riddle\u2019s attention.\u201cYes,\u201d Riddle says, the amusement in his voice impossible to ignore. \u201cNot all of us work during the night, you know?\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Harry says, feeling his face grow hot.Riddle chuckles and nips at Harry\u2019s shoulder one last time before he rolls off of Harry\u2019s chest.\u201cHow much money do you make, on average, per week?\u201dAnd just like that, Harry\u2019s more or less good mood dissipates into thin air. He doesn\u2019t like to think about his far-from-ideal financial situation. When he still had access to a vault full of Galleons, he rarely had to wonder if he could afford to buy what he wanted. And now, he can\u2019t even get himself a new cloak or a book about time travel without worrying that he won\u2019t have enough left to pay for rent and food. It\u2019s depressing to think about.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201dHe can feel Riddle\u2019s eyes on him, but he refuses to meet his gaze, preferring to stare at the ceiling. Riddle isn\u2019t the first client who wants to talk about money. Most of them tried to use Harry\u2019s situation against him at some point, tried to urge Harry into satisfying their bizarre kinks, usually by promising absurd amounts of money. He had refused to give in to any of them until now. And yet he\u2019s a bit curious about what Riddle\u2019s angle will be. He didn\u2019t give off the impression of being into weird stuff until now.\u201cHmm, let\u2019s see. You ask for five Galleons per night, so if you work six nights a week, that\u2019s thirty Galleons. Now, if half of them ask for something that will cost them double, then that\u2019s an additional fifteen Galleons. That makes forty-five Galleons in total. Did I get that right?\u201dNot really. It\u2019s usually significantly less than that. Harry has developed a clientele in the last few months, but he\u2019s far from the only whore in Knockturn Alley. There are many younger and prettier guys, a lot of them more open to kinky sex.\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d Harry says, his voice chilly, still refusing to glance in Riddle\u2019s direction.\u201cI told you, I have a proposition for you. I\u2019d be willing to pay you twice as much for spending five nights a week with me. I only have one condition: you will have to stop seeing other clients. I don\u2019t like to share.\u201dHarry stares at the ceiling for a long moment, stunned. Then he slowly turns his head towards Riddle.\u201cWait. Did I get that right? You\u2019d be willing to pay me ninety Galleons a week?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Riddle says as if that were the most normal thing in the world. \u201cThat should be enough for you to live a decent life, am I right?\u201dHarry blinks multiple times, trying to take that in. The fifty Galleons Riddle paid him for a single night without sex had been enough to make him doubt Riddle\u2019s sanity. That had been a one-time thing, though. Riddle makes it sound like he\u2019s offering an arrangement that will last for a few weeks, at the very least.\u201cWell?\u201d Riddle says when Harry just keeps staring at him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry bites his lips. He can\u2019t remember the last time he felt as tempted as he does right now. \u201cI need to think about it.\u201dIf Riddle weren\u2019t, well, Riddle, he\u2019d agree right away. This way, though, Harry worries about what will happen if he interferes too much in Riddle\u2019s life. Having sex with him a few times is one thing. Seeing him almost every night for weeks on end is something else entirely.\u201cOf course,\u201d Riddle says and stands up, showing off his body shamelessly. \u201cJust send me a letter once you have made up your mind.\u201d\u201cOkay. I don\u2019t have an owl, but I can send you a Patronus instead.\u201dRiddle, who had reached down to pick up his clothes, freezes and slowly turns his head towards Harry. \u201cA Patronus?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026? Is that a problem?\u201dRiddle blinks and shakes his head slightly before picking up his clothes. \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d\nRiddle shows up right on time. Harry isn\u2019t sure if he should be surprised or amused about that. Either way, Harry can\u2019t help but be grateful for it. It allows him to avoid the awkwardness of having to turn one of his clients down. They tend not to take that well, often punishing Harry by not asking for his services for a while.\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Riddle says when he sits down across from him, his eyes lazily moving over Harry\u2019s face.Harry draws his shoulders up slightly, feeling on edge, part of him still wondering if he made the right decision when he sent the Patronus.He\u2019s a collector, Harry reminds himself. He likes to gather things he considers to be valuable. Once he realizes that there is nothing special about me, he\u2019ll lose interest and cast me aside. After all, there are many people willing to warm his bed for much less or even for free. So there\u2019s really nothing to worry about. In the meantime, I should focus on getting as much out of this as possible.\u201cHullo. You got my Patronus, I assume?\u201dHe already knows the answer to that question, of course. His Patronus had never failed him before, and it would have to be a pretty big coincidence for Riddle to show up at exactly the right time and place. But he generally prefers to cut to the chase right away, and this seems like the easiest way to do so.Riddle hums. \u201cHalf the Ministry wonders who conjured such a beautiful stag \u2014 and the other half are either empty-headed fools or too busy with their own problems.\u201d Riddle cocks his head. \u201cTell me, Harry. Did you intend to draw that much attention?\u201dHarry freezes for a moment. Then he slowly leans back, blinking. \u201cYou were at the Ministry?\u201d\u201cObviously.\u201dObviously, my ass. Harry sent the Patronus in the middle of the day, which means that Riddle should have been at Borgin and Burkes and not at the bloody ministry!\u201cAh. So it wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d\u201cYour eyes. You have a very expressive face. It\u2019s one of the things I like most about you.\u201dHarry raises an eyebrow. \u201cAnd what are the others?\u201dRiddle can\u2019t seriously be trying to sweet-talk him, right? Isn\u2019t one of the benefits of hiring a whore that you don\u2019t need to bother with stuff like that?\u201cOh, fishing for compliments, are we? You surprise me, Harry. I didn\u2019t pick you for someone who\u2019s particularly self-absorbed.\u201dHarry raises an eyebrow but remains silent, not sure what Riddle is trying to get at.\u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t help but wonder why you don\u2019t want the Ministry to notice you.\u201dHarry clenches his hands into fists under the table. Is that a threat? No. It doesn\u2019t feel like one, at least, and he has gotten pretty good at recognizing them since he arrived in the past.\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of love for the Ministry,\u201d Harry says slowly. \u201cBut that\u2019s not exactly unusual for someone like me, is it?\u201d\u201cSomeone like you?\u201d\u201cA whore,\u201d Harry responds, barely refraining from rolling his eyes. Riddle almost makes it sound like he thinks there is more to Harry than that. There isn\u2019t. Not here and now, anyway. \u201cNow, regarding your offer\u2026 I\u2019m inclined to accept, as I already told you through the Patronus. Under a few conditions, that is.\u201d\u201cAnd what are those conditions?\u201d\u201cI want half the money upfront. The things I mentioned on our first night together are still off-limits, and that\u2019s not up for debate. And I won\u2019t stay longer than ten hours at a time with you. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cAlright. Sounds fair.\u201dRiddle pulls a big bag of coins out of his robes, causing Harry\u2019s heart to skip a beat.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou said-\u201c\u201cI know what I said. But you can\u2019t just throw that kind of money around at a place like this!\u201dRiddle blinks and looks around before putting the money away, to Harry\u2019s relief. \u201cYou think people would try to rob you?\u201d\u201cMaybe not while you\u2019re around,\u201d Harry says because he has to admit that Riddle gives off an intimidating, don\u2019t-mess-with-me kind of vibe. \u201cBut I live not far from here, and I don\u2019t want any trouble if I can avoid it.\u201dRiddle looks at him for a long moment, his face utterly unreadable. Then he stands up and extends a hand, apparently waiting for Harry to take it. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you at my flat, then.\u201dSighing, Harry takes Riddle\u2019s hand and allows himself to be pulled out of the pub.***\u201cYou actually live here?\u201d Harry asks, feeling the comfortable weight of Riddle\u2019s Galleons in his pockets.Borgin and Burkes can\u2019t be paying all that much \u2014 definitely not enough for Riddle to afford to live at a place like this, anyway. Hell, Harry\u2019s whole flat could easily fit into Riddle\u2019s bedroom. Does that mean Riddle has some other means of income? And if so, should Harry care?\u201cYes.\u201d Harry feels a hand on his shoulder and turns around, finding dark eyes gazing down at him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you something. A gift. Do you want to see it? I think you\u2019ll look lovely in it.\u201dHarry swallows and takes half a step back. This is it, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s about to find out what Riddle is into when he isn\u2019t after cuddling and snuggling, isn\u2019t he?\u201cOf course,\u201d\u00a0 Harry says softly, never one to back down unless he has to. \u201cI\u2019d love to see it.\u201d\nHarry tenses slightly when Riddle pulls something seemingly out of nowhere, something that-Oh. That\u2019s not a sex toy.\u201cWould you like to try it on?\u201dHarry swallows and nods. His throat seems to have closed up, and he doesn\u2019t trust himself to speak without embarrassing himself. He allows Riddle to help him out of his worn-out cloak and into the brand-new one, shivering slightly when the soft material slides over his arms.\u201cHm,\u201d Riddle murmurs while he hangs Harry\u2019s old cloak over a chair. \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t need to take measurements. Come here.\u201dRiddle pulls him through the room, and Harry follows his lead, blinking slowly. What does he have to gain by giving me a cloak, of all things?They come to a stop in front of a huge mirror, and Riddle wraps his arms around him from behind, laying his chin on Harry\u2019s right shoulder.\u201cWell? What do you think?\u201dHarry rips his gaze away from Riddle\u2019s intense, dark eyes and takes in the piece of clothing Riddle apparently bought for him for some reason.Harry had never really cared for dressing himself in fashionable, extravagant clothes, even when he had the money to afford it. However, he spent enough time around people who did care about stuff like that, both before and after the accident that landed him in the past. Many of them would have gone green with envy seeing Harry like this.\u201cI love it,\u201d Harry murmurs and sighs when Riddle kisses his shoulder and neck, all the way to his ear. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201dRiddle nips at his ear lobe, and Harry leans back against him, trying to hide that his knees are buckling slightly.\u201cIt looks expensive. Why would you waste so much money on somebody else\u2019s clothes?\u201dRiddle pulls on his ear lobe with his teeth, and Harry grabs one of the arms wrapped around his stomach, needing something to hold on to. Riddle kisses his ear lobe once before pulling back slightly.\u201cI like seeing you in something other than rags. It brings out your beauty \u2014 especially your eyes.\u201dHis eyes? Harry looks at the cloak again, this time paying a bit more attention to the fine, green lines throughout the fabric, trying to keep the disbelief off his face. He spent that much money just because he wants something pretty to look at? Riddle is even weirder than I thought.\u201cThank you. I appreciate it.\u201d And he really does. Riddle doesn\u2019t seem to expect anything in return - it was a gift, after all - and this means he won\u2019t have to buy himself a coat for the winter, after all. Sure, some people might try to steal the cloak from him, but Harry knows how to deal with that. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that someone attacked him in Knockturn Alley.Riddle hums and nips at Harry\u2019s neck, which shouldn\u2019t be half as distracting as it is. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t look out of place at a ministry gala like this.\u201dOh. So that\u2019s what this is all about. He wants to pretend that I\u2019m someone I\u2019ll never be, that I\u2019m someone of meaning and not just some random whore he found in a seedy pub in Knockturn Alley. Well, I can play into that fantasy a bit if he cares so much about that to buy me such an expensive cloak.Riddle loosens his grip on him and reaches for Harry\u2019s hand. Harry allows himself to be pulled through the room, a bit confused when Riddle doesn\u2019t head for the bed but for one of the doors. Harry\u2019s eyebrows creep upwards when they step into one of the largest bathrooms he\u2019s ever seen. Riddle swings his wand, and the bathtub begins to fill with water.When Riddle starts pulling off his clothes, Harry follows his example, making sure to fold his new cloak neatly. The last thing he needs is Riddle getting angry because he doesn\u2019t treat his gift appropriately.A few seconds later, they step into the bathtub, Riddle sitting down behind him just as he expected. Once they settled down, Riddle lays a hand against his chest, wordlessly telling Harry to lean back against his chest. Harry doesn\u2019t even try to suppress a shiver when Riddle moves his hands over his upper body, assuming that Riddle will like sensing that he\u2019s affecting him.\u201cHow old are you, Harry?\u201d\u201cTwenty-three.\u201dRiddle\u2019s hands stop moving for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re older than me?\u201dHarry lets out a soft snort. \u201cOf course, you care about that. Would you prefer it if I were a minor?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Riddle says right away, to Harry\u2019s relief. There\u2019s a reason why he put pretending to be underage on his no-go list. He couldn\u2019t live with himself if he played into such fantasies.Harry tenses slightly when Riddle\u2019s hands reach for his nipples. Many of his clients like to twist or pinch them cruelly. Harry has a pretty high pain tolerance, so it usually doesn\u2019t faze him. But usually, his clients don\u2019t care about making Harry warm and comfortable first. It\u2019d be unpleasant, to say the least, to lose this comfort so suddenly. Besides, Harry is still looking for proof that he made a wrong decision when he accepted Riddle\u2019s offer.But Riddle doesn\u2019t pinch his nipples. He\u2019s just as gentle with them as he was last time. The most he does is pull on them slightly. Harry shivers again and leans his head against Riddle\u2019s shoulder, lowering his eyelids.\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Riddle murmurs, brushing his lips against Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cJust relax and let me take care of you.\u201dHarry rolls his eyes. He still doesn\u2019t understand why Riddle is paying for this, but he sees no reason to complain. He didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take a bath for almost a year now, and he intends to enjoy it as much as he can.\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Harry murmurs after Riddle moved away from Harry\u2019s nipples to focus on the rest of Harry\u2019s upper body.\u201cOf course.\u201d Something brushes against Harry\u2019s head, probably Riddle\u2019s lips, and Harry gets goosebumps despite the hot water they are in.\u201cThe thing you said during our first night\u2026 does that still stand?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be more specific than that, dear.\u201dHarry frowns. Is he really going to make me say it? \u201cI mean the part about you not wanting to be touched below the waist unless you ask me to.\u201d\u201cAh, that. Well, technically speaking, you are touching me below the waist right now.\u201d You don\u2019t need to tell me that. Harry is very much aware of the soft cock pressing against his arse. \u201cBut if we\u2019re talking about your hands and mouth, then yes, that still stands.\u201dHarry bites his lips. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d Especially since you\u2019re paying me so much, Harry adds mentally.Riddle remains quiet for a long while, moving his hands all over Harry\u2019s chest, occasionally brushing against Harry\u2019s nipples. When Harry is already convinced that he won\u2019t get an answer, Riddle finally opens his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s how I prefer to do it, usually. Especially with people I don\u2019t know well.\u201d\u201cSo once you know me better\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026Maybe. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\nHarry tenses when the mattress dips beside him. Then he remembers where and who he is and relaxes. Riddle has no reason to attack him. He\u2019s not in any immediate danger.When he feels Riddle\u2019s weight on top of him, Harry flutters his eyes open as if he hadn\u2019t been awake yet.\u201cMorning,\u201d Riddle murmurs, pressing lazy kisses all over Harry\u2019s chest.Harry grimaces. \u201cI fell asleep. Again.\u201dHarry feels Riddle\u2019s lips stretching into a grin against his chest. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what most people do at night.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d Harry says and brings up a hand to caress Riddle\u2019s back. It\u2019s the least he can do after doing such a piss-poor job. If he keeps being so unprofessional, Riddle might break off their arrangement before they can even get through the first week. Harry slides a hand upwards along Riddle\u2019s back and into his hair. Riddle lets out a content little hum when Harry starts caressing his scalp.\u201cYou could have woken me up, you know?\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Riddle murmurs and leans his head forward. Harry takes that as a hint to focus more on the nape of Riddle\u2019s neck. \u201cBut I liked how pliant and soft you were in my arms.\u201dRiddle pulls back, and Harry reluctantly lets go of him. Harry catches his breath when Riddle rearranges himself slightly so that he\u2019s sitting on Harry\u2019s lap, his thighs on either side of Harry\u2019s hip, the only thing separating them a thin sheet. He gives off a sinful image like that, with his disheveled hair and the sleepy look on his face. He looks like he had the night of his life. It makes him wonder how Riddle would look like if they really did stay up all night.\u201cAre you done staring?\u201d Riddle asks and raises an eyebrow playfully.Harry wills himself not to blush. \u201cNot quite.\u201dRiddle laughs, a hint of surprise in his voice, before leaning down to nib at Harry\u2019s collarbone. \u201cYou\u2019re cute. Come on, I made breakfast.\u201dAnd just like that, Riddle climbs off the bed and pulls Harry to his feet, all in one movement.\u201cYou\u2026 want me to stay for breakfast?\u201d Harry looks around for his clothes until he remembers that they are still in the bathroom.\u201cSure, why not? Now, come on.\u201dHarry allows himself to be pulled through the room to the door across from the bathroom, which leads to a living room almost as big as Riddle\u2019s bedroom. Again, Harry wonders where Riddle gets all that money from to afford living like this. Dumbledore never mentioned a second source of income when they discussed Riddle\u2019s twenties. Maybe his followers are giving him money to further their cause? But would Riddle really accept charity? It doesn\u2019t seem very likely.Harry pushes the thoughts aside when they sit down at the living room table, and he sees the mountain of food.\u201cYou made all of that while I was asleep?\u201dRiddle shrugs and reaches for the scrambled eggs. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long. You only need to know the right spells. Do you want some?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Harry says, doing his best to keep the disbelief out of his voice and off his face when Tom fucking Riddle pushes scrambled eggs onto Harry\u2019s plate as if that were perfectly normal. Harry picks up his fork on autopilot and starts eating. It feels a bit weird to sit at a table without any clothes on, but the room is warm enough that it doesn\u2019t bother him.For a while, they eat in silence until Riddle picks up the Daily Prophet lying on a chair beside him.Riddle snorts. \u201cI knew I was being followed. Oh, well. People can\u2019t live without their gossip, I suppose.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking-\u201d Harry chokes on his eggs when he sees the front page. He rips the Prophet out of Riddle\u2019s hands and stares at the picture for a few long heartbeats. Then his eyes flicker downwards to skim the article....after a mysterious Patronus appeared at the ministry...met someone in Knockturn Alley...dark hair and glasses...looks like a Potter\u2026the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic, who is known to have loose affairs...Harry stares at the last part uncomprehendingly.\u201cYou work for the ministry?\u201dThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Dumbledore would have known about it if Riddle had ever gotten such a high-ranking position at the ministry. Maybe - maybe - he might have missed it if Riddle had only worked there for a month or two at some random position. But Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic? Something is wrong. This shouldn\u2019t be possible.A shiver runs down Harry\u2019s back when he becomes aware of Riddle\u2019s eyes on him.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know who I am? How can this be? I\u2019m in the papers every other day. And how do you know my first name, then, for that matter?\u201dHarry keeps his eyes on the article to avoid having to look at Riddle.Didn\u2019t Riddle introduce himself? ...No. No, he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201cYou knew you were being followed?\u201d Harry asks in an attempt to change the subject. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell them to get lost?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to give journalists a little bit of what they want than to frustrate them unnecessarily. Besides, I didn\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d\u201cDid you, now,\u201d Harry says quietly, still with his eyes fixed on the paper. \u201cWhat if they find out that you\u2019re paying a whore? Won\u2019t that ruin your reputation?\u201dHarry sees Riddle shrugging out of the corner of his eyes. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time. It\u2019s old news. Wouldn\u2019t sell well, you know?\u201dFinally, Harry rips his gaze away from the paper to look Riddle in the eyes. \u201cYou should have told me that you were being followed.\u201dRiddle raises an eyebrow, his eyes moving all over Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t like being in the spotlight, do you?\u201d\u201cNo. I never did. I just want to be left alone...\u201d ...and research time travel in peace.Riddle hums. \u201cWell, then you\u2019ll be happy to hear that most people will have forgotten about this little article in a few days - at least if we don\u2019t give them anything else to talk about. If a journalist approaches you, just send them to me. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\u201cFine,\u201d Harry says and gives Riddle the newspaper back.I can\u2019t wait to get out of here. There\u2019s a lot I\u2019ll need to think about.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy these two,\u201d Harry says, pointing at two of the books laid out on the table in front of him.\u201cGood choice,\u201d the shop assistant says and hands Harry the books.Together, they walk to the counter, and Harry pulls out his wallet. Ever since someone robbed him a few months ago without him even noticing it, Harry kept most of his money in his apartment, hidden behind a concealment charm. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, of course, since someone could still break into his apartment and sense the concealment charm, but since he can\u2019t afford a vault at Gringotts, it will have to do for the foreseeable future.Harry pays the hefty sum of two Galleons and nine Sickles \u2013 why do books about obscure topics have to be so expensive? \u2013 and leaves the shop, his pockets feeling uncomfortably light. He glances around Diagon Alley longingly. There\u2019s so much he\u2019d like to buy, stuff he denied himself ever since he found himself in the past with only a few Galleons in his pockets. The temptation to get something nice to eat or a soft towel is hard to ignore.Harry shakes his head and turns towards the entrance of Knockturn Alley. Yes, Riddle paid him enough Galleons that he could indulge a bit without regretting it right away. But for what? For some fleeting pleasure and comfort? That\u2019d be a waste.Harry walks through Knockturn Alley, not looking anyone in the eyes, which is another thing he had to learn the hard way. Many people walking around Knockturn Alley don\u2019t want anyone to notice them.\u201cHarry.\u201dHarry\u2019s eyes snap toward the guy walking in his direction, and he barely manages to suppress a sigh. \u201cLestrange. What do you want?\u201d\u201cSo rude. Are you sure you can afford to talk to me like that?\u201dHarry looks back evenly, burying the snarky response on the tip of his tongue deep inside of him. He doesn\u2019t want to offend Lestrange needlessly in case Riddle changes his mind.\u201cI couldn\u2019t find you last night. Where were you?\u201dHarry raises an eyebrow. \u201cWith a client.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Lestrange says, the way someone does when they just figured something out. \u201cYou were with Riddle. You do know he\u2019s just using you, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says slowly, deciding that Riddle should have told him if he wanted to keep it a secret that he\u2019s paying a whore. \u201cThat\u2019s part of my job description.\u201dLestrange sneers. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. He\u2019ll suck you dry and toss you aside once you\u2019re no longer useful to him. If I were you, I\u2019d stay away from him.\u201d\u201cWell, he already did suck me dry,\u201d Harry drawls before he can stop himself. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m busy.\u201dHarry keeps walking and grinds his teeth when Lestrange grabs his shoulder to hold him back. \u201cIf you meet me later this evening, I\u2019ll tell you what happened to the last whore that found himself in Riddle\u2019s bed.\u201d\u201cSorry, not interested.\u201d He rips the hand off his shoulder and keeps walking.The curse hitting him in the back catches him on the wrong food. Suppressing a painful gasp, Harry draws his wand and whirls around, ready for anything.Well. Not ready for anything, apparently.\u201cImperio.\u201dHarry allows the curse to take hold of him for a moment, wanting to know what Lestrange is up to.Walk into the back alley, a voice says at the back of his head. Then get on your knees and wait for me there.Harry walks a few steps toward the entrance of the back alley, making sure to keep his face expressionless. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches Lestrange\u2019s smug expression. Now or never.Harry snaps his wand toward Lestrange. \u201cStupefy!\u201dLestrange collapses, his eyes widened slightly. Harry looks down at him for a long moment, breathing heavily. What now? Should I just leave him here? What will he do when he wakes up? Will he be out for revenge?\u201cDrop your wand,\u201d a cold voice says from somewhere behind him. Harry tenses. Yeah, that\u2019s not going to happen.Harry whirls around and yells, \u201cProtego!\u201dA curse bounces off his shield, and Harry\u2019s eyes flicker around. There are two men in the alley with him, and they are wearing-Shit. Just what I needed.\u201cI surrender,\u201d Harry says loud and clear.Keeping an eye on the Aurors, Harry leans down to lay his wand on the pavement, making sure to keep his movements slow and predictable. Then Harry puts his hands against the back of his head as he had seen criminals do in some movies as a kid. The Aurors exchange a short glance. Then Harry\u2019s Protego dissolves into thin air, and the left Auror swings his wand. Harry tenses but doesn\u2019t try to dodge the spell flying toward him. The other Auror summons Harry\u2019s wand.Harry winces as his arms are forced down and behind his back. Something that feels like a smooth rope wraps itself around Harry\u2019s wrists. Harry feels like grimacing when his shoulders are pulled uncomfortably far back in the process.Thoughts whirl around inside his head as the Aurors walk toward him. The one that took his wand stops a few feet in front of him. The other walks past him, maybe to check on Lestrange. Harry has to force himself not to twist his head around so that he can keep an eye on him.\u201cName?\u201d The Auror in front of him asks, eyes cold and hard.\u201cHarry.\u201d\u201cAnd your last name?\u201dHarry hesitates. Usually, he answers this question with none of your business, but you don\u2019t need to be a genius to know that snarkiness won\u2019t do him any good right now.\u201cEvans,\u201d Harry settles on, his heart beating uncomfortably in his chest.\u201cWell, then, Harry Evans,\u201d the Auror says, and Harry hunches his shoulders as far as the rope around his wrists allows. He must have noticed my hesitation. That\u2019s not good. \u201cYou are under arrest for using an Unforgivable curse. Will you follow me peacefully, or do I need to drag you to the ministry?\u201d***Harry still feels dizzy when the Auror pulls him through the masses of people toward the elevators. He senses countless eyes on him, but for once, Harry couldn\u2019t care less. Drawing a bit of attention is the least of his problems right now. It doesn\u2019t surprise him that no one follows them when Harry and the Auror step into one of the elevators.\u201cWhere are you bringing me?\u201d Harry asks tonelessly once the door closed behind them. \u201cAzkaban?\u201dThe Auror presses a button, and the elevator starts moving. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You need to be questioned first.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d Harry says, his voice still toneless. \u201cAnd after that? Do I get a trial?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. That depends on how your interrogation goes.\u201dHarry swallows. That doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201cYou are awfully quiet. Most criminals we pick up keep insisting that they are innocent.\u201d\u201cWhy should I repeat myself over and over again? I already told you that I didn\u2019t use any Dark magic, that I only protected myself. You should be questioning Lestrange, not me.\u201d\u201cOh, we will get to that. But since you knocked him unconscious, we will have to start with you.\u201dHarry grinds his teeth at the lame excuse. If they wanted, they could just revive him. It\u2019s a simple enough spell.The elevator comes to a stop, and the door opens. Harry keeps his mouth shut as they walk through various corridors, his mind running a mile a minute.The evidence is on his side. Harry reminds himself of that again and again to keep his panic at bay. They can\u2019t prove that Harry committed a crime he didn\u2019t do. But will that matter? The ministry he knows is far from fair and competent.Eventually, the Auror opens a door, and they enter a room that is bare apart from a table and two chairs. Harry swallows when he recognizes one of the chairs. He had seen these chains come alive in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve, wrapping themselves around the arms of Death Eaters.Less than a minute later, Harry sits on the chair, glancing down at his bound arms. The books he bought earlier dig uncomfortably into his right side, and his back feels sore from whatever curse Lestrange hit him with.Harry raises his head when the Auror opens the door, leaving Harry alone with his anxiety and fear. Still, Harry is glad for the chance to gather his thoughts before the interrogation starts.***About half an hour later, the door opens again, and two people enter the room. One of them is the Auror who took his wand and brought him to the ministry. He moves to the back of the room and leans against the wall. The other Auror, a middle-aged guy with white streaks in his hair, sits down on the chair across from Harry.\u201cMy name is Adalrico Greengrass. I\u2019m the Head Auror, but you already knew that, of course.\u201d I didn\u2019t, actually. \u201cAnd this is-\u201dSomeone knocks against the door, and Greengrass curses.\u201cWhen will people learn to read the Do-not-disturb sign?\u201d Greengrass mutters before he raises his voice. \u201cYes?\u201dThe door opens, and Riddle walks in. Harry\u2019s heart skips a beat, his mind jumping to conclusions right away.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Greengrass asks sharply.Riddle raises an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve already forgotten the Minister\u2019s orders. I\u2019ve come to supervise your work, of course.\u201dGreengrass\u2019 left eye twitches, but he only says, \u201cFine. You can stay as long as you remain quiet.\u201dRiddle nods and leans against the wall beside the door from where he can keep an eye on Harry and Greengrass at the same time.\u201cYou are claiming to be innocent, Mr. Evans?\u201d Harry nods. \u201cTell me what happened according to you, then.\u201dHarry takes a deep breath and explains what happened in short sentences that leave little room for interpretation.Greengrass leans back in his chair once Harry finished, looking more than a little skeptical. Harry forces himself not to glance in Riddle\u2019s direction. He still has no idea what he\u2019s doing here. He might be trying to help him, but Harry doubts that. It\u2019s much more likely that Riddle just wants to know who he\u2019s associating himself with.\u201cYou shook off the Imperius curse?\u201d Greengrass says, skepticism in every syllable.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very strong one. It didn\u2019t even make me forget who and where I was.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Greengrass murmurs, his eyes wandering over the cloak Riddle bought him and the less-than-fancy clothing underneath. \u201cYou know an awful lot about the Imperius curse for someone who claims never to have used it. Why is that?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Harry snaps. Part of him knows that it might not be the best idea to lash out right now, but there is only so much tension he can take before he needs to let it out somehow. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been hit by the Imperius curse before. Is that a crime, now?\u201d\u201cHe reeks of Dark magic,\u201d Riddle whispers, and Harry tenses.He\u2019s here to harm me, then. A wave of helplessness and - weirdly enough - betrayal washes through him. Harry pushes the feelings aside as best as he can.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that,\u201d Greengrass drawls.\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t smell like this seven hours ago.\u201dRiddle\u2019s words hang heavily in the air, and Harry bites his lips to keep himself from asking what this is about. Somehow he can tell that might not be the best course of action right now.\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you how to do your job,\u201d Riddle says in a way that makes it obvious that he\u2019s doing exactly that, \u201cbut if I were you, I\u2019d try to find out why he suddenly smells like that first.\u201dGreengrass opens his mouth, but before he can get a word out, someone knocks against the door again.\u201cOh, for the love of- Yes?\u201dThe door opens, and a man comes in. Harry needs a few seconds until he recognizes him as the other man who confronted him in Knockturn Alley, the one that took care of Lestrange. He looks pale and a lot less sure of himself.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Greengrass asks sharply once the man closed the door behind himself.The man swallows audibly, and his eyes wander to Harry. \u201cWe- We examined Mr. Lestrange and his wand.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dThe man exhales sharply, still looking at Harry. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201dHe lays a wand - probably Lestrange\u2019s - onto the table and draws his own wand.\u201cPrior Incantato.\u201dSomething that looks like smoke or dark fog comes out of the wand on the table and forms a small figure with messy hair and glasses. Harry grimaces. He didn\u2019t mention what Lestrange tried to make him do for a reason. Helplessly, he has to watch as the smoky figure walks a few steps, its movements mechanic and efficient. Then it comes to a stop and sinks to its knees. The figure raises its arms and fumbles with something invisible in front of him. To Harry\u2019s relief, the figure turns into thin air before it can do anything even more humiliating.Biting his lip, Harry glances around. All eyes are fixed on the table where the smoky figure had knelt. No one says a word.\u201cWell?\u201d Harry says when he can\u2019t take the silence anymore. \u201cCan I go now?\u201dRiddle turns towards him, his face perfectly even, almost empty. It\u2019s impossible to tell what he\u2019s thinking. When Riddle draws his wand, Harry hunches his shoulders, preparing for the worst. But Riddle only points his wand at the chains wrapped around Harry\u2019s arms. They start moving, and a few seconds later, Harry is free to move his arms again. Harry rubs them to get the blood pumping. The chains had been uncomfortably tight.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the authority to-,\u201d Greengrass says quietly but breaks off when Riddle looks at him sharply.\u201cCan I go now?\u201d Harry repeats.\u201cNo,\u201d Greengrass says and sighs. \u201cYou are a witness. Besides, if what Mr. Riddle said is true, you might be in danger. You don\u2019t just suddenly start reeking of Dark magic out of nowhere. Smith, Rowle, I want you to go over to cell B12. Don\u2019t let Lestrange out of your sight.\u201dThe two Aurors who confronted Harry in Knockturn Alley - Smith and Rowle, apparently - nod and leave. Harry looks after them longingly, wishing he could get out of here as well.\u201cYou said Lestrange hit you in the back with some kind of curse?\u201d Riddle asks out of nowhere.\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says and rolls his shoulders experimentally, wincing slightly.Greengrass frowns. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re in pain?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s- I\u2019m just feeling a little tender, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201dHarry glances at Riddle indignantly. Didn\u2019t Greengrass say he shouldn\u2019t interfere?\u201cDo as he says,\u201d Greengrass says, running a hand through his hair. \u201cSomeone should have checked you for injuries sooner.\u201dSuppressing a sigh, Harry stands up and bares his upper body to the chilly air. Then he turns around so that Riddle and Greengrass can take a look at his back. Someone lets out a hiss.\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry says and twists his head around, but he can\u2019t see anything from this angle.Riddle walks towards him.\u201cThis part of your back,\u201d Riddle says and draws a huge circle onto Harry\u2019s skin with one of his fingers, \u201cis one big bruise.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d Harry says, not understanding why Riddle\u2019s voice sounds so heavy. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bruise. It will heal on its own, right?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Greengrass says, his voice hard and angry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a bruise, unfortunately. Lestrange used the Incrimination curse against you.\u201d\u201cThe what?\u201dGreengrass sighs. \u201cPut your clothes back on and sit down, then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\u201cSo what does this Incrimination curse do?\u201d Harry says the second he sits down.\u201cMost people use it to incriminate their victim.\u201d\u00a0Yeah, go figure.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for a reason. Once the bruise it causes fades - naturally or through magical means - it\u2019s impossible to prove that the curse was used on the victim.\u201d\u201cBut I still don\u2019t get what it\u2019s for,\u201d Harry interrupts impatiently. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even hurt all that much, really, when it hit me.\u201d\u201cThat only makes it more dangerous because the victim might not realize what happened,\u201d Greengrass says, tapping with his fingertips on the table. \u201cIt makes the victim smell of someone who uses Dark magic regularly and excessively. How strong the smell is depends on a lot of factors \u2014 the magical strength of the victim and that of the perpetrator, for example.\u00a0You\u00a0reek as strongly as someone who uses the Unforgivables does.\u201dHarry blinks. \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d Riddle drawls. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d\u201c\u2026part of the spell,\u201d Harry finishes the sentence for him. \u201cGot it. So you\u2019re saying Smith and Rowle smelled me and came running?\u201dGreengrass shakes his head. \u201cNot literally. We have many more reliable means to find users of Dark magic.\u201dWhich you obviously won\u2019t tell me about.\u00a0Well, it\u2019s probably better that way. Harry wouldn\u2019t know what to do with that knowledge, anyway.\u201cSo how do I get rid of the smell? Or can I just wait until it goes away on its own?\u201d\u201cNo, you most certainly cannot since it would make the work of my colleagues significantly harder. There\u2019s a potion you can use to suppress the smell. You\u2019ll have to take it once every twenty-four hours for a week.\u201dHarry grimaces. Just what I needed.\u201cAnd how expensive is that potion?\u201d\u201cThe ministry will cover the costs,\u201d Riddle says before Greengrass can open his mouth.Greengrass glances at Riddle, a little startled, before he turns back to Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s possible, yes. However, I\u2019d consider it a little\u2026 crude to hand out charity to someone who obviously doesn\u2019t need it.\u201dHarry frowns. What makes him think I\u2019m well off?\u00a0...Oh.\u201cThis cloak isn\u2019t mine.\u201d Riddle gives him a sharp look. \u201cI mean, it was a gift. I suppose I could sell it,\u201d another sharp look, \u201cbut I guess that could be considered a bit rude.\u201dNot that I would care about that if I actually did need the money to get by.\u201cAh, my apologies. It was not my intention to jump to conclusions. I meant no offense.\u201dHarry shrugs. \u201cNone taken. Anyway, what else do you need to know? I\u2019d like to go home.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start with another explanation of what happened.\u201dHarry suppresses a sigh and describes what happened once again. At the end of it, Greengrass frowns and folds his hands.\u201cDo you know why Mr. Lestrange attacked you?\u201d\u201cI can guess why, yes. But why should I tell you?\u201d When Greengrass raises his eyebrows, Harry adds, \u201cI mean, why do you need to know?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s easier to convict someone if we have a clear-cut case. The more cooperative you are, the sooner we can call it a day.\u201d\u201cFine. But, I mean, it\u2019s pretty obvious why he used the curse on me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. You\u2019ll have to spell it out for me.\u201dHarry grinds his teeth. \u201cHe was frustrated because I wouldn\u2019t take him to bed again, so he tried to force himself on me.\u201d What\u2019s so hard to understand about that?\u201cSo you are ex-lovers?\u201d Greengrass asks, completely ignoring the sharpness in Harry\u2019s voice.\u201cGod, no. He just pays me for sex sometimes.\u201dGreengrass blinks, his eyes flickering over Harry\u2019s face and upper body. It\u2019s not something Harry is unused to, but it still makes him uncomfortable.\u201cThat might explain the Imperio.\u201d Might? \u201cBut what was his motive for using the Incrimination curse on you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know? Maybe he wanted to punish me, to get me in trouble with the ministry? Why don\u2019t you ask him yourself?\u201d\u201cOh, we will. And you still claim that you shook the Imperius curse off before it could make you do anything?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d How many times do I need to repeat myself?Greengrass and Riddle exchange a look.\u201cIt\u2019s no shame to succumb to an Unforgivable,\u201d Riddle says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful curse.\u201dHarry folds his arms. Why do they want me to say I lied? Is Lestrange a political enemy of Riddle or something? No, wait, that can\u2019t be it. That would explain Riddle\u2019s motivation but not Greengrass\u2019.\u201cI know. But the Imperius curse just doesn\u2019t work well on me. I have a strong aversion to being told what to do. Besides, I told you, it wasn\u2019t a very strong one.\u201d\u201cWho else used the Imperius curse on you?\u201d Greengrass says, a hint of something in his voice.Harry shakes his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They won\u2019t do it again.\u201dGreengrass tries to get a more specific answer out of him for a while, but once he realizes that won\u2019t work, he goes back to questioning Harry about what happened today.When Greengrass finally runs out of words, Harry feels like he answered every question at least three times. All in all, it seemed like a very inefficient and unprofessional way of dealing with a witness. Greengrass doesn\u2019t look very amused when Harry tells him that. But he at least finally allows Harry to go after giving him his wand back as well as seven vials of the potion he will have to take.It doesn\u2019t surprise him when Riddle follows him through the door. Harry waits until they are around the corner before he lets out a frustrated sigh.\u201cI thought he\u2019d never shut up.\u201dThe corner of Riddle\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cHe would\u2019ve let you go right away if you\u2019d hold him what he wanted to hear.\u201d\u201cThat just proves that he\u2019s even worse at his job than I thought.\u201dRiddle raises an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s the best Head Auror we had in a long time. You just\u2026 don\u2019t understand his methods.\u201dHarry frowns before he realizes what\u2019s going on and glances around. Right. They are at the ministry. Riddle probably doesn\u2019t want anyone to overhear him \u2013 not that there seems to be anyone around, anyway. A glance at his watch tells him why.\u201cCan we go straight to your place, or do you still have work to do?\u201d\u201cI always have work to do. However, there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t wait until tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI can hear the but in your voice.\u201dThey step into the elevator, and Riddle waits until the doors close behind them before he opens his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be alone tonight?\u201d\u201cI want a lot of things,\u201d Harry says, rolling his eyes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll get them.\u201d\u201cHarry-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. Today was far from the first day someone tried to ruin my life. I know how to deal with stuff like that \u2014 hiding at home won\u2019t do me any good.\u201d\u201cSo you don\u2019t\u2026 blame me?\u201d\u201cWhy would I blame you?\u201d Harry says, staring at Riddle.\u201cNot here,\u201d Riddle says, shaking his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go to my place first.\u201dHarry shrugs. \u201cFine by me.\u201d\n\u201cSo why did you think I\u2019d blame you?\u201dRiddle pulls off his cloak and hangs it over a chair before he responds. \u201cBecause Lestrange might have attacked you to get back at me. There\u2019s bad blood between us.\u201dHarry frowns and pulls off his own cloak. That\u2019s weird. Does that mean that the Lestranges weren\u2019t always as loyal to Voldemort as they will be in a few decades?\u201cEven if that were the case, I wouldn\u2019t blame you,\u201d Harry says and pulls off the rest of his clothes before he climbs into Riddle\u2019s bed. \u201cIt was Lestrange\u2019s decision to attack me, not yours.\u201d Harry cocks his head when Riddle just stands there, staring at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to join me?\u201dRiddle blinks and shakes his head slightly. Then he waves his hand, and his clothes disappear.Show-off, Harry thinks as Riddle slips into the bed beside him.\u201cYou\u2019re dealing exceptionally well with the situation, all things considered.\u201dHarry shrugs. \u201cIf I lost my mind every time something bad happened, I wouldn\u2019t be here anymore.\u201d Harry licks his lips and moves a little closer to Riddle. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhy are Aurors having such a hard time catching people who use the Dark Arts if you can smell when someone uses Dark magic?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s easy to suppress the smell. It\u2019s a big red flag when someone does reek as strongly as you did.\u201dHarry exhales and closes his eyes. So the ministry is even more incompetent than I thought. Big surprise.\u201cThanks for getting me out of there,\u201d Harry murmurs, opening his eyes. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if they\u2019d sent me to Azkaban.\u201dRiddle raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. Greengrass doesn\u2019t have the power to send innocents to prison.\u201dHarry lowers his gaze in an attempt to hide his skepticism. Riddle may be the one who\u2019s working at the ministry, but Harry\u2019s the one who experienced first-hand what the ministry is capable of \u2014 or will be, at least. He doesn\u2019t feel like arguing about that right now, though, so he leans forward and nips at Riddle\u2019s collarbone.Riddle exhales slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that. Not tonight.\u201d\u201cI want to,\u201d Harry murmurs and realizes with a jolt that it\u2019s not even a lie. \u201cIt\u2019ll get my mind off of things.\u201dRiddle seems to hesitate for another moment. Then he wraps his arms around Harry and kisses his temple.Harry licks and nips along Riddle\u2019s collarbone and up his neck while Riddle\u2019s fingers moving along his spine send shivers down his back.Eventually, Harry reaches Riddle\u2019s lips which are as soft as ever, and Harry loses himself in the moment for a while. Even after spending multiple nights with Riddle, he still hasn\u2019t gotten used to being touched so gently and with care.After a while, Riddle starts trembling the faintest bit, and his hips move forward just enough for Harry to notice. Harry nips at Riddle\u2019s bottom lip and moves his hand from where it\u2019s buried in Riddle\u2019s hair down his spine. Once there, he slows his hand, moving his fingers inch by inch along Riddle\u2019s hip, towards-Riddle lays his hand over Harry\u2019s and breaks their kiss.\u201cI know you want to,\u201d Harry whispers against Riddle\u2019s lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s holding you back?\u201dRiddle glances down at him, his cheeks rosy and his hair disheveled. He seems to hesitate for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t like losing control in front of others.\u201dHarry blinks. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t want me to touch his cock? But why is he paying a whore, then, to begin with? Did he really plan on... on mostly cuddling with me for weeks?Harry brushes his lips against Riddle\u2019s, murmuring, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to lose control. I can still make you feel good. Let me show you.\u201dRiddle hesitates, drawing his head back slightly to look Harry in the eyes. Harry holds his gaze, waiting.After a few seconds, Riddle moves his hand off Harry\u2019s and leans forward to capture Harry\u2019s lips again. Harry returns the kiss, slowly moving his hand forward.Riddle\u2019s cock feels hot and twitchy when he wraps his hand around it. Harry keeps his hand there for a while, allowing Riddle to get used to it. Then, the next time Riddle pulls back to get some air, Harry closes his eyes and concentrates for a few seconds.\u201cYou can do wandless magic,\u201d Riddle says breathlessly as Harry slowly moves his hand up and down, the conjured lube making it that much easier.\u201cNot really,\u201d Harry murmurs, burying his other hand in Riddle\u2019s hair. \u201cJust a few basic spells, that\u2019s all.\u201dRiddle\u2019s breath hitches when Harry brushes his thumb over his glans for the first time, and then his lips are on Harry\u2019s again, hungrier this time.When he feels Riddle\u2019s breath coming faster, Harry moves his hand a little quicker, though still relatively slow. Riddle doesn\u2019t want a mind-numbing orgasm, so he\u2019ll have to let the orgasm build up slowly, naturally.And then, out of nowhere, Riddle grips Harry\u2019s shoulders and rolls on top of him. Harry blinks up at him, unsure if he should pull his hand away. Riddle reaches down and takes the decision away from him, pressing both of Harry\u2019s arms into the mattress beside his head. Riddle\u2019s eyes look wilder and, for lack of a better word, more open than ever before.\u201cI-,\u201d Harry begins, wanting to apologize since he obviously did something wrong, but he doesn\u2019t get that far.Riddle lowers his hip and moves his cock against Harry\u2019s.Harry gasps and throws his head back, somehow only now realizing how turned on he\u2019d become while jacking off Riddle. Then he feels lips on his neck, sucking on his skin.Harry can only lay there, gasping and shivering as Riddle keeps moving against him, still pressing Harry\u2019s arms into the mattress. Riddle sucks mark after mark into his skin, and Harry doesn\u2019t even care that they are too far up to cover up easily.His orgasm doesn\u2019t catch him by surprise \u2014 it\u2019s more like the natural conclusion to being stimulated ruthlessly. Harry catches his breath and arches his back, hearing Riddle curse softly from somewhere far away before even more wetness spills onto his stomach.Harry keeps his eyes closed, waiting for his racing heart to calm down. Eventually, Riddle loosens his grip on Harry and rolls off of him. Riddle murmurs something, and the wetness disappears.A hand brushes over his chest hesitantly. \u201cAre you alright?\u201dHarry opens his eyes and smiles. \u201cMore than alright.\u201d\nHe looks so young when he\u2019s sleeping.Tom raises a hand and pushes a strand of hair out of Harry\u2019s eyes, careful to keep his touch light enough that Harry won\u2019t wake up. Now, with the hair out of the way, Tom moves a little closer to get a better look at the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. Something inside of him feels drawn to the unusual shape, but he keeps himself from looking at it as best as he can when Harry\u2019s awake. He doubts Harry would like being stared at.Tom reaches out with his hand to touch the scar but holds himself back at the last moment. Harry looks so peaceful, and he deserves some rest after everything Lestrange and Greengrass put him through. Rage rises inside of him alarmingly fast, and he grabs the sheets tightly.If Harry hadn\u2019t been strong enough to shake off the Imperius curse-But he had. He had shaken it off. And not only that, he also acted as if that was nothing special. It makes Tom wonder what else he is capable of \u2014 apart from conjuring a corporal Patronus and using wandless magic, that is. Tom licks his lips, letting his hungry eyes wander over Harry\u2019s face. If nothing else, yesterday proved to him that Harry is more than worth the hours he spent thinking about him. Anyone who starts smelling as strongly as Harry did after being hit with the Incrimination curse has to be immensely powerful, whether Harry is aware of that or not.Harry seems to be pretty oblivious in general, and not only when it comes to his own magical strength.Everyone knows that even the Head Auror doesn\u2019t have the power to send anyone to Azkaban just like that, even if the person in question is guilty without a shadow of a doubt. And yet Harry looked pretty doubtful when Tom corrected him.And then there\u2019s also the fact that he didn\u2019t know that I am the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister.Tom has no idea how Harry could\u2019ve missed that. Most journalists love including him in their articles because of his good looks and his charm. It seems weird that Harry never reads the Prophet or talks with anyone about politics.But then again, he knew my name. I wonder what that\u2019s about. He seemed to recognize me from somewhere when I approached him that first night.Tom smiles when Harry sighs in his sleep and unconsciously scoots a little closer. Harry is one big mystery, and Tom intents to pick him apart until he finally understands what\u2019s going on in his head. The effort will be more than worth it, there\u2019s no doubt about that anymore.When Tom turns his head to check if his wand is still where he left it \u2014 he\u2019s a bit paranoid that way \u2014 he sees out of the corner of his eyes that Harry\u2019s cloak slid to the floor. Tom reaches for his wand, which is, no surprise, still on his nightstand and swings it. The cloak lays itself over the back of the chair, but something falls out in the process. A book.Frowning, Tom stands up, careful not to wake Harry, and picks up the book, staring at the title for a long moment. Dimension travel: myths and anecdotes. Slowly, Tom opens the book and reads the introduction, his mind running a mile a minute. Once he reaches the end of the introduction, Tom closes the book and puts it back into a pocket of Harry\u2019s cloak, his movements slow and cautious. Then his eyes wander back to Harry\u2019s still sleeping form.Well. I think it\u2019s about time I adjust my plans.\nHarry wakes up to sunlight on his face. He basks in the warmth for a while, dozing.Wait\u2026 sunlight?Blinking, Harry opens his eyes, unsurprised to find Riddle awake and looking at him.\u201cDon\u2019t you need to go to work?\u201dThe corner of Riddle\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d\u201cIt is? But didn\u2019t you say yesterday that there\u2019s still work waiting for you but that it can wait for a few hours?\u201dRiddle raises an eyebrow. \u201cIt didn\u2019t realize you were listening that closely. Yes, there are one or two things I need to take care of today, but that should only cost me an hour.\u201dRiddle leans forward to brush a kiss to Harry\u2019s nose. It\u2019s such a sweet and surprising gesture that Harry can\u2019t do anything to keep the blood from rushing to his face. Feeling weirdly abashed, Harry pushes a strand of hair out of his face.It\u2019s almost a relief when Riddle\u2019s expression twists into something cold and hard, seemingly out of nowhere \u2014 at least it\u2019s a relief until Riddle grabs his hand and brings it towards his face.He must have caught a glimpse of the sentence on the back of Harry\u2019s hand.Harry tries to pull his hand away, but Riddle\u2019s grip is strong, and he doesn\u2019t feel like wrestling with Riddle if he can avoid it. Besides, it\u2019s not like he needs to keep the scar hidden. It just makes him\u2026 uncomfortable that Riddle is staring at it.\u201cDo you know how to get permission to visit Hogwarts?\u201d Harry asks, partly because he really wants to know and partly in an attempt to shift Riddle\u2019s focus. \u201cI need to talk with Dumbledore.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to Hogwarts for that,\u201d Riddle murmurs, still staring at Harry\u2019s hand. \u201cDumbledore works at the Hog\u2019s Head Inn in Hogsmeade.\u201dHarry frowns, startled by the answer. He\u2019s intentionally misinterpreting me, isn\u2019t he?\u201cNo, I mean Albus Dumbledore. Not Aberforth.\u201dRiddle blinks and finally raises his gaze, the grip on Harry\u2019s wrist becoming looser all of a sudden. Harry hastily pulls his hand out of reach.\u201cDumbledore ran off to join Grindelwald three years ago.\u201dHarry catches his breath, freezing all over. He digs his hands into the sheets, his eyes darting all over Riddle\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Harry whispers.\u201cWhy should I? What could I possibly gain from such an easily refutable lie? Dumbledore is violent and dangerous. The Dementors were even instructed to kiss him immediately if they ever come across him.\u201dHarry blinks. Everything feels weirdly far away all of a sudden. Dumbledore joined Grindelwald? The Ministry is hunting him?The mere idea is absurd. Impossible.Slowly, Harry gets out of bed and starts walking up and down, ignoring Riddle\u2019s eyes on him.I was right, then. Unspeakable Fawley must have experimented with more than just time when I interrupted him. Damn it, why didn\u2019t he just take the necessary precautions? I never would\u2019ve entered the Time Room if I had known he was busy!Harry takes a deep breath, attempting to calm himself down, still walking up and down.But isn\u2019t that a good thing? Now I don\u2019t need to worry about accidentally changing anything anymore.Harry grimaces. That\u2019s true, of course. It opens up a lot of opportunities, things he never allowed himself to consider before, afraid to damage the timeline irrevocably. But it also makes the problem he\u2019s found himself in even harder to solve. Now he not only needs to find a way to travel through time but also through dimensions. His eyes wander over to his cloak.I need to go through the books I bought as soon as possible.\u201cHarry? Are you alright?\u201dSlowly, Harry\u2019s gaze wanders back to Riddle, who\u2019s still in bed, though he sat up at some point. There\u2019s a weird glint in his eyes that Harry doesn\u2019t quite know what to make of.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Harry asks before he even consciously decided to open his mouth.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Riddle says, and something about the innocent look on his face - which is obviously just a farce - rubs Harry the wrong way. A fire ignites inside of his stomach, and he curls his hands into fists.\u201cI mean that you\u2019re paying me absurd amounts of money, much more than I\u2019d be worth even if you did fuck me all night long \u2014 which, as far as I can tell, you didn\u2019t plan to do at all. And you helped me at the Ministry without asking for anything in return. And- And you\u2019re treating me like I\u2019m\u2026 like I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cLike you\u2019re worth something?\u201d Riddle says, raising an eyebrow.Harry shakes his head. \u201cLike I\u2019m your boyfriend. I just\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just go out and find someone who will cuddle with you for free? I don\u2019t get it.\u201dHarry folds his arms when Riddle\u2019s eyes wander over his body, painfully aware, suddenly, that he\u2019s standing in the middle of the room, totally naked and breathing heavily.\u201cI enjoy being close to you,\u201d Riddle murmurs eventually. \u201cYou\u2019re cute and smart and so very responsive.\u201dHarry opens his mouth, but Riddle apparently isn\u2019t finished.\u201cBut I admit that that wasn\u2019t why I approached you that first night. I heard rumors about a Potter who sold himself in Knockturn Alley, seemingly because he saw no other way to pay for his basic needs-\u201c\u201cI\u2019m not a Potter.\u201dRiddle rolls his eyes. \u201cMaybe not in name, but you are related to them by blood. Don\u2019t try to deny it, it\u2019s obvious.\u201dHarry grinds his teeth, digging his fingers deep into his upper arms. Stupid genetics. \u201cI still don\u2019t get what you want from me, though. If you wanted to hurt me to get back at the Potters for whatever reason, you\u2019ve done a pretty bad job of that so far.\u201dRiddle shakes his head impatiently. \u201cI thought they abandoned you. I thought they wanted nothing to do with you anymore and didn\u2019t care that you were suffering. The plan was to gain your trust, to make you feel good and safe and happy. And then, eventually, I would\u2019ve tried to get a family secret or two out of you.\u201dHarry blinks a few times, trying to take that in. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe Potters are political enemies of mine. It seemed like the easiest way to get rid of them \u2014 politically speaking, of course.\u201dThat seemed like the easiest way to him? What the hell? \u201cWell, your efforts were for nothing. The Potters don\u2019t even know I exist.\u201d\u201cYes, I already figured that out. I wouldn\u2019t have told you my original plan if I still intended to see it through, would I?\u201dI suppose not. Sighing, Harry runs a hand through his hair. \u201cThis is it, then, I guess. I knew this arrangement wouldn\u2019t last long.\u201dHarry picks up his clothes scattered across the floor and freezes when Riddle hisses, \u201cI\u2019m not ending our arrangement. What part about me enjoying your company did you not understand?\u201dHarry lets the clothes fall back onto the floor and straightens his back. \u201cI\u2019m not worth ninety Galleons a week, and we both know it.\u201d\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Riddle gets out of bed and walks towards him. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re incredibly strong, both mentally and magically. The more I find out about you, the more you fascinate me. I want you by my side, both figuratively and literally. You could be a powerful ally in so many ways.\u201d Riddle hesitates. \u201cIf you\u2026 If you don\u2019t like to depend financially on me so much, I could help you get a job at the Ministry.\u201dHarry shakes his head. \u201cStop. I can\u2019t\u2026 There\u2019s too much going on in my head right now. I\u2019ll come back in the evening, okay?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not ending our agreement?\u201d Riddle asks, almost shy.Harry sighs. \u201cNo.\u201d And he probably won\u2019t any time soon if everything stays the same. Riddle pays too well, and their arrangement comes with barely any disadvantages. It bothers him a bit that Riddle tried to trick him, but he should have expected something like that. Sure, Riddle apparently decided to become a politician instead of a Dark Lord in this dimension, but that doesn\u2019t make him a saint.Harry picks up his clothes again but hesitates before he can pull them on. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I need to know before I go. Lestrange hinted that you treated the other whore you paid poorly. Did you approach him for the same reason you approached me?\u201dRiddle grimaces. \u201cMore or less, yes. But it backfired. He saw me as an opportunity to pull himself out of the mud, and he damaged my reputation more or less intentionally\u2026 Well, long story short, I had to tell him off quite publicly, and he didn\u2019t take that very well. I haven\u2019t seen him since.\u201dHarry looks at Riddle intently, but he can\u2019t catch any signs that Riddle is lying. But I wouldn\u2019t, would I? Riddle is supposed to be a brilliant liar.Slowly, Harry pulls on his clothes, suppressing a sigh. \u201cWell, then. See you in the evening, I guess.\u201d\nHarry is out for a walk in Diagon Alley, trying to clear his mind, when suddenly, a shiver runs down his back. He whirls around and draws his wand, but he isn\u2019t fast enough. A sickly green curse hits his chest, and Harry gasps when he feels a sharp pain from a dozen different places. Something hot and wet starts to soak into his clothes and run down his body, seemingly everywhere. Blood.Harry ignores the pain, looking for his attacker. His eyes lock onto a man on the side of the road with auburn hair and beard, a crooked nose, and a soft smile on his face.\u201cInteresting,\u201d Dumbledore murmurs just as the first people start shrieking and running away, his eyes wandering all over Harry\u2019s face and body. \u201cYou\u2019ve lived quite the life, haven\u2019t you?\u201dHarry stares at Dumbledore, not even thinking about running away. Dumbledore singled him out, so his chances of getting away have to be abysmal anyway. Harry raises his wand a little higher and waits for Dumbledore\u2019s next attack, ignoring the hot blood running down his ankles and into his socks.Dumbledore\u2019s smile widens, and Harry tenses when he sees the mad twinkle in his eyes. \u201cMy, my, you are a strong one. I\u2019ll tell you what: if you answer all of my questions and surrender peacefully, I won\u2019t hurt you. Much.\u201dHarry raises his eyebrows disbelievingly.\u201cAnd what do you call this?\u201d Harry asks before he can stop himself, waving with his free hand at his body. He didn\u2019t recognize the spell Dumbledore hit him with, but he knows he\u2019s losing a lot of blood, too much not to be worrisome.Dumbledore lets out a low chuckle. \u201cA warning. There\u2019s more like that waiting for you if you don\u2019t behave.\u201dHarry grinds his teeth to keep himself from snapping back, though he isn\u2019t quite sure if that\u2019s even the best course of action. The longer he waits and stalls, the more blood he\u2019ll lose and the weaker he\u2019ll become. On the other hand, he\u2019s already weakened and doesn\u2019t feel at all ready to fight someone as powerful as Dumbledore. It\u2019d be best to engage Dumbledore in conversation as long as he can, hoping that Aurors will arrive soon. Right?\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Dumbledore murmurs, taking half a step towards Harry. \u201cHow did you become the wand\u2019s owner?\u201dAt first, Dumbledore\u2019s words don\u2019t make sense. But then Harry catches his breath, and his eyes flicker toward the wand in Dumbledore\u2019s hand.\u201cAh, so you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d Damn it. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Now, please enlighten me. I know for a fact that we never fought against each other before.\u201dHarry curls his lips, and the pain all over his body finally fades into the background. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201dDumbledore sighs, sounding disappointed. \u201cWell, then. You asked for it.\u201dHarry barely has time to stumble back a step and raise a shield before the first curse reaches him. His heart rate increases rapidly, but he doesn\u2019t have time to worry that it\u2019ll cause him to bleed out even more quickly. Dumbledore\u2019s curses are powerful and numerous, with barely any breaks in between. It takes all of Harry\u2019s energy and concentration to keep Dumbledore at bay. He\u2019s only distantly aware that the road is deserted by now while he inches backward more and more, leaving behind a trail of blood.Dumbledore laughs, the sound high and wild, when Harry stumbles and almost loses his footing. The sudden anger running through his veins gives him new energy, enough to go on the offensive and use a few curses of his own.Dumbledore stops smiling and bares his teeth. \u201cYou can\u2019t win this fight.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d Harry responds and hisses when he doesn\u2019t raise a shield in time, and a curse misses him by barely an inch. I only need to hold on long enough.And as if the Aurors heard his thoughts, the sound of loud cracks appears all around them. With a bitten of curse, Dumbledore stops throwing curses at Harry, his eyes flickering around. Then the corners of his mouth move upwards into a grotesque smile, and he spins around on the spot. A dozen different curses - including Harry\u2019s Stupefy - crash into the wall where Dumbledore had been standing.Harry wavers on his feet, and the Auror closest to him runs towards him to grab his arm. \u201cEasy.\u201dHarry blinks. The world around him looks weirdly blurry, the way it does when he isn\u2019t wearing glasses.\u201cI think I need to\u2026 to sit down,\u201d Harry murmurs haltingly, and everything turns dark.***Harry wakes up feeling disoriented and with something cold pressing against his lips. He tries to move his head back, but the hand on his neck makes that impossible.\u201cYou need to drink this if you don\u2019t want to lose consciousness again,\u201d a woman says.Harry tries to keep his mouth shut, but a drop finds its way through his lips anyway.Oh. Harry relaxes his jaw and allows the rest of the liquid to flow into his mouth and down his throat. It\u2019s just a Blood Replenishment potion. Nothing harmful.\u201cMr. Evans?\u201dHarry blinks and looks around. He\u2019s lying on a bed, but he can\u2019t see much else of the room since there are so many people all around him. Most of them are Aurors, but there are also two people in white robes, a man and a woman.\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\u201cSt Mungo\u2019s.\u201dHarry snaps his head around at the familiar voice. What is Riddle doing here?\u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d Someone else asks, and when Harry turns his head, he sees Greengrass glancing down at him with a small frown on his face.Harry grimaces. \u201cYes. What are you all doing h-\u201cThe woman in the white coat - Harry assumes she and the men are Healers - interrupts him. \u201cWe already closed most of the scars we could guess the origin of, but we need your help with the rest of them.\u201dHarry stares at her. \u201cSorry, but I have no idea what you mean by that.\u201dThe Healer huffs. \u201cYou were hit with a curse that opens up every scar all over the victim\u2019s body. We can stop the bleeding, but only if you tell us how you got the scars.\u201d The Healer gestures at his right hand. \u201cLet\u2019s start with that one.\u201dHarry glances down at the back of his hand. With all the blood in the way and the ragged edges of the cuts, it\u2019s close to impossible to make out the individual words \u2014 especially since Harry\u2019s handwriting had never been particularly neat.\u201cI got that from a blood quill.\u201d Harry hesitates. \u201cA blood quill uses your own blood to-\u201d\u201cOh, I know what a blood quill is,\u201d the Healer says with a dark look on her face, pointing her wand at Harry\u2019s hand.\u201cAnd that one?\u201d The male Healer asks, gesturing at a bloody spot on Harry\u2019s forearm.\u201cI brushed against a hot pan,\u201d Harry murmurs, ignoring the embarrassment at the back of his mind. He\u2019d been a stupid little kid when that happened.Greengrass clears his throat. \u201cWe need to know why Dumbledore was in Diagon Alley and why he attacked you.\u201dAh. So that\u2019s why the Aurors are still here \u2014 though Riddle\u2019s presence remains a mystery.Harry hesitates. \u201cI have something he wants. But I\u2019m not sure if that was the only reason he was in Diagon Alley.\u201d\u201cAnd what did he want?\u201dHarry licks his lips. \u201cPower over the Elder wand. He\u2026 he thinks I\u2019m its owner.\u201d\u201cThe Elder wand is a myth,\u201d Greengrass responds immediately.Harry shrugs, and the female Healer says firmly, \u201cyou need to hold still.\u201d\u201cDumbledore doesn\u2019t think so, and neither do I. I don\u2019t know why Dumbledore is convinced I\u2019m the owner of the Elder wand,\u201d or, more correctly, how he figured it out, \u201cbut I doubt he\u2019ll let it go any time soon.\u201d\u201cYour wand isn\u2019t made out of elder wood,\u201d Riddle points out, and Harry wishes he could shrug without bothering the Healers again.\u201cTrue. But you don\u2019t need to hold the Elder wand to be its owner.\u201dThe Healers stop their incantations almost at the same time, and when Harry looks down, he sees that the blood is gone and that his scars look the same way they did before. The Healers point at two other bloody spots, and Harry winces, wishing he could just tell everyone to fuck off and leave him alone.\u201cThat one was caused by, er\u2026 the tail of a Hungarian Horntail. And that one,\u201d Harry bites his lips, avoiding all eye contact, \u201cby a Basilisk fang. I was lucky that there was a Phoenix close by.\u201dFor a long moment, no one says a word or moves a finger. Then the two Healers shake their heads, beginning their incantations anew. When the others refuse to stop staring at him, Harry raises his head and stares back at them, one after the other, until they finally avert their eyes.One of the Aurors murmurs quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t you need to kill someone to become the owner of the Elder wand?\u201dHarry\u2019s eyes snap toward her, and he raises his head.\u201cAre you accusing me of committing murder?\u201d The Auror blushes but holds his gaze. \u201cDefeating your opponent is more than enough. Even a simple Expelliarmus works. I wonder\u2026 I wonder if Dumbledore and Grindelwald kept stealing the wand from each other over the years\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you fought against Dumbledore before?\u201d Greengrass asks sharply, with a thoughtful look in his eyes.Harry forces himself not to grimace. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t believe the Elder wand exists?\u201d\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Greengrass says vaguely. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start by telling us what happened and what Dumbledore\u2019s exact words were?\u201dHarry sighs but describes his encounter with Dumbledore as best as he can. Shortly after Harry finished talking, the Healers end their incantations.\u201cAlright,\u201d the female Healer says. \u201cNow there\u2019s only the scar on your forehead left.\u201dHarry freezes, and a wave of fear washes over him. No one here knows that it\u2019s possible to survive the killing curse. They\u2019ll either think I\u2019m lying, insane, or the Darkest wizard that ever lived. How do I get out of this?Apparently, Harry had been quiet for a moment too long because the Healer sighs, and her eyes wander toward Greengrass. Coldly, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to leave, don\u2019t you think?\u201dGreengrass looks like he wants to argue for a moment, but then he nods and turns around, and the other Aurors follow him through the door.\u201cYou too, Mr. Riddle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dThe Healer takes a deep breath.\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Harry murmurs. \u201cHe can stay.\u201dJudging by the curious glint in Riddle\u2019s eyes, he\u2019d find a way to learn the truth, anyway.The Healer looks skeptical for a moment, but then she shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re choice. Well, then, Mr. Evans. What caused it?\u201dHarry shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 kind of a unique scar. I\u2019m not sure you can close it up.\u201dThe Healer smiles slightly. \u201cTry me. Or do you want to bleed from your forehead for the rest of your life? Even Blood Replenishment potions won\u2019t be enough to keep you going forever.\u201dHarry hesitates for another moment before he gives in. He doesn\u2019t really have a choice, does he? \u201cIt was\u2026 an Unforgivable curse.\u201d\u201cBut the Unforgivable curses don\u2019t leave scars behind,\u201d the Healer says, furrowing her brow.\u201cThe killing curse does,\u201d Harry says, his eyes wandering to Riddle, and he doesn\u2019t know what to feel when he sees the barely concealed shock in his eyes. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t kill you, that is.\u201d\u201cImpossible,\u201d the male Healer murmurs.\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Harry says, still looking at Riddle. \u201cThere was a piece of somebody else\u2019s soul inside of me. The killing curse destroyed that part and left me alone.\u201dIn the utter silence that follows, Harry wipes the blood from his forehead that was threatening to run into his eyes. Eventually, the female Healer sighs, which sounds unnaturally loud in the eerie quiet.\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly more unique than I assumed, I give you that,\u201d she says dryly. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident I can make it work. This might hurt now, but I need you to hold as still as you can.\u201dHarry nods and barely feels the pain when the Healer starts murmuring. He keeps his gaze locked on Riddle until his eyelids grow heavy, and he sinks back into darkness.\nHarry wakes up feeling warm and comfortable, so much so that it immediately makes him suspicious. Hesitantly, Harry opens his eyes, wondering if Riddle brought him back to Riddle\u2019s flat while he was asleep and defenseless. But no, he still seems to be at St. Mungos. Harry raises his eyebrows when he sees Riddle slumped in a chair beside his bed.\n\nSlowly, Harry sits up, careful not to make any noise. I wonder how long he\u2019s been here already. And how long I was asleep, for that matter.\n\nHarry grimaces. He\u2019s gonna have so many questions \u2014 and the Aurors, too, I guess. So much for staying off the radar.\n\nHarry closes his eyes for a moment, trying to come to terms with the fact that his life is about to become even more complicated.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d Riddle says, and Harry flinches, snapping his eyes back open. \u201cSorry. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. Ready to go home, actually. There\u2019s no need to drive up the medical bill any further.\u201d\n\nRiddle shakes his head.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I already paid for everything. You could stay here for a whole week if you wanted to.\u201d Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Riddle adds, \u201cBesides, you can\u2019t leave yet. Greengrass wants to talk to you again. And you shouldn\u2019t leave before we decide on some measures to keep you safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Riddle says, cocking his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s not up for you to decide. It\u2019s the duty of the ministry to protect its citizen. This isn\u2019t a matter of money, either. You won\u2019t have to pay for the protection we\u2019ll provide you with.\u201d\n\nHarry frowns and lowers his gaze. He remembers vividly how it had been like to have Aurors around him all the time during his sixth year. It had been an uncomfortable experience, for the most part. But he sees no way to refuse outright without sounding ungrateful. Besides, Dumbledore might be even more dangerous to him than Voldemort had been, in a way. After all, Harry can\u2019t hide in a safe place like Hogwarts in this dimension.\n\nSighing, Harry leans back, brooding. After a while, Harry turns his head towards Riddle again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all you have to say, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Riddle admits. \u201cHarry\u2026 were you a thing? You and your Tom Riddle?\u201d\n\nHarry freezes, his mind going very, very quiet all at once. \u201cMy Tom Riddle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re from a different dimension,\u201d Riddle says as evenly as if they were talking about the weather. \u201cAnd I can guess whose Horcrux you were. You might not know this, but I feel drawn to your scar. You seemed to enjoy my affections right from the get-go, which makes me wonder if you were\u2026 projecting.\u201d\n\nHarry stares at Riddle for a long moment, trying to take all of that in. Then he snorts, and before he knows it, he\u2019s laughing so hard that there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough air in his lungs.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Harry gasps between laughs, \u201cYou think Voldemort and I\u2026?\u201d\n\nTears cloud his vision, but he\u2019s pretty sure he catches Riddle raising an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d\n\nHarry just shakes his head, caught in another fit of laughter. It feels good to laugh. He didn\u2019t have many reasons to smile, let alone laugh since he arrived in the past.\n\nEventually, Harry feels like he can talk normally again and wipes the tears out of his eyes, still grinning like a madman. \u201cNo. Voldemort and I weren\u2019t a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Riddle murmurs, unconvinced. \u201cHe gave you a part of his very soul. He wouldn\u2019t have done that if there hadn\u2019t been some kind of special connection between the two of you.\n\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. It\u2019s worse enough that you know that I\u2019m not from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not denying that you traveled between dimensions,\u201d Riddle says slowly. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re too smart to believe any lie I could come up with,\u201d Harry responds dryly. \u201cEspecially since I unintentionally gave you some pretty huge clues to work with. Why do you even want to know what kind of relationship I had with Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? You can learn a lot from other dimensions, just as you can learn a lot from history. The version of me from your dimension obviously went down a very different path if you know him by Voldemort. I\u2019d like to analyze his decisions and their consequences. Your memories of your dimension are a treasure trove of knowledge, and I would give up a lot to get some answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Harry says, folding his arms. \u201cWhat would you be willing to give up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends. What do you want, Harry? I could help you achieve it, whatever it is. With my political power and money and our combined magical strength, there\u2019s not a lot we can\u2019t accomplish together.\u201d\n\nHarry hesitates. The gleam in Riddle\u2019s eyes should be enough to smother the temptation rising in Harry\u2019s chest. But instead, it just emphasizes how different Riddle and Voldemort are. There\u2019s nothing insane in Riddle\u2019s eyes. Just excitement and hope mixed with a hint of pleading. Harry sighs and closes his eyes for just a second.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this dimension for almost a year now, and I didn\u2019t come one step closer to getting back to my friends during that time. Heck, I didn\u2019t even realize that I was in another dimension until yesterday. I\u2019ll need someone to help me if I don\u2019t want to be stuck here for years. And since I obviously can\u2019t ask Dumbledore\u2026\n\nSiding with Riddle wouldn\u2019t be like siding with Voldemort. He\u2019s different here. Maybe I could even use this opportunity to influence him a bit so that he stays far away from the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cI want to go home. Back to my friends. But I don\u2019t exactly have the resources to study dimension and time travel in depth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime travel?\u201d Riddle asks, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was born in 1980,\u201d Harry says impatiently. \u201cPoint is, I didn\u2019t come here on purpose. It was an accident, one I wish never happened. Getting back is one of two things I need help with.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Riddle says, nodding slowly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the other?\u201d\n\nHarry sighs. \u201cDumbledore and Grindelwald need to be brought to justice. I want to help the Aurors achieve that. I\u2019m the owner of the Elder wand, and I\u2019d be selfish not to use that to stop them. Dumbledore - my Dumbledore - would\u2019ve wanted me to help.\u201d\n\nRiddle stares into nothing for a minute or so, his face utterly unreadable. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your goal to be this ambitious\u2026 but I suppose I should have known better. Is that why you told Greengrass that you\u2019re the owner of the Elder wand? Because you want to work with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Harry says, grimacing. \u201cI usually don\u2019t think that far ahead. I just knew that Dumbledore will attack me again, and I couldn\u2019t think of a good explanation for that at the top of my head \u2014 and I wanted them to know that Dumbledore and Grindelwald are more vulnerable than they were before. Besides, I usually fare better with telling the truth.\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s eyes flicker downwards, and Harry needs a second until he realizes that Riddle is staring at the scar on the back of Harry\u2019s hand.\n\nHarry smiles. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but I actually got that one because I didn\u2019t lie. It\u2019s a long story, but it was, indirectly, Voldemort\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s expression does something weird - he seems to grimace and bare his teeth at the same time - but then his face becomes even again. Riddle takes a deep breath and extends his hand.\n\n\u201cWell, then. Do we have a deal? I\u2019ll help you achieve your goals, and you\u2019ll answer my questions about your dimension?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitates, wondering if he\u2019s about to make a terrible mistake.\n\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d Harry says and grabs Riddle\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy the hell not.\u201d"
