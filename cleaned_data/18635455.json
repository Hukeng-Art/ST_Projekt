    "notes": "<p>Hi!</p>\n<p>I saw Endgame yesterday and this is my knee jerk reaction to it. Just started to type away and this happened. I wasn't really sure if I should post it but it feels like I just need to put it out there, y'know?<br>That being said: This is my first time writing IronDad and SpiderSon. I'm really nervous about the characterization. It's not beta'd, English is not my first language and it's been quite some time since I wrote a fic in English and there a probably a lot of commas in places they shouldn't be in. </p>\n<p>Like I said, this was pretty emotional for me. </p>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Hey!</p>\n<p>You guys, I'm totally blown away by all your support and love for this fic? Like, I wasn't expecting it at all. Thank you so much!<br>Just like last time: it's not beta'd, there are probably commas in place they shouldn't be, I don't know anything about DNA tests or any details about the American school system. In fact, the only thing I'm qualified to talk about is cake and cake isn't even mentioned. <br>By the way, I do have <a href=\"https://jen27ny.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> if you like to talk to me over there. I'm still trying to get used to posting stuff (after several years of using it) so it's not all taht exciting right now, but I'm trying to be better. So, yeah. Maybe you can encourage me? </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Guys, I'm still absolutely floored by your support! I literally can't believe it. Thanks so much!</p>\n<p>This chapter took so much longer than I anticipated. It's also so, so much longer than I originally planned. There is a lot of heartfelt conversations in here and, honestly, it was a bit like pulling teeth for me. I don't know why, maybe I wasn't in the right state of mind, or my own problems where just getting in the way, or I'm just really bad at writing heartfelt conversations. So that didn't help either. </p>\n<p>This is not beta-read. I still don't know where to put any commas. Also, I still don't know anything about anything except cake, and there is still no cake in this story. </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it! :)</p>",
    "text": "Happy Hogan didn\u2019t know how he went from being a bodyguard of a billionaire to a babysitter in the span of a few years. Actually, he knew exactly how it happened. Said billionaire was kidnapped by terrorists, became a superhero, found some other superheroes to create some kind of superhero team, had a quarrel with his super-friends, recruited a kid that was bitten by a radioactive spider to fight the super-friends \u2013 and got attached to the kid. Tony tend to do some weird things, but after working for him for over a decade Happy got kind of used to it.\nThat didn\u2019t mean he liked it.\nEarlier in the morning \u2013 if you could even call that ungodly hour morning \u2013 May Parker had called. And when May Parker calls, you answer. It\u2019s one of The Rules that were established after the whole Vulture Incident and, more importantly, after she found out about her nephew\u2019s secret identity. That hadn\u2019t been pretty. Happy had been in the room when May had yelled at Tony for what seemed like hours. It\u2019s been miraculous \u2013 he\u2019s never seen his boss just sit quietly while someone screamed at him. Even Pepper would get some banter-that-was-basically-just-flirting in return. The kid had looked like he was this close to a mental breakdown and Happy didn\u2019t blame him.\nBut eventually, after about a month and a bit of no Spider-Manning and The Rules, everything got back to \u2013 their kind of \u2013 normal. Peter was allowed to do his web shooting vigilante thing but only after school and doing his homework. As soon as his grades would slip, he had to stop. There was a curfew and he had to call in after patrolling; which wasn\u2019t really a new rule as he\u2019d already done that before. Happy had several long voice mails to proof it. Peter spend every other weekend with Tony to upgrade the suit, work on his web fluids, get some basic material arts training, and whatever else a young superhero in training need to learn. Lately, they spend more time in the lab tinkering, playing stupid video games or watching movies. Happy isn\u2019t really sure how that\u2019s part of the superhero training but he hasn\u2019t seen Tony that relaxed in a long time, so he keeps his mouth shut.\nOne of the most important rules was to always, always, pick up the phone if one of the Parkers is calling. Which was the reason Happy was currently in Queens, about to climb up seven flights of stairs \u2013 because of course the lift was out of order \u2013 to check up on the kid. His aunt had turned to him because Peter hadn\u2019t picked up his phone when she tried call him \u2013 she preferred to call Happy instead of Tony because Tony was the complete opposite of subtle and the last thing they need right now were headlines about him visiting some kid in Queens. May was working some insane shifts at the hospital which was why Peter was on his own in the mornings as well as the evenings and better parts of the night. Tony had offered to let him stay at the Tower, but May didn\u2019t trust him to stick to the curfews without Pepper around to make sure both teenager and billionaire would get the proper amount of sleep. So, the kid was mostly alone and his aunt would call in to make sure that he was awake and getting ready for school. It was a system that had worked before and seemed to work now \u2013 until this morning.\nPeter hadn\u2019t picked up when she called in to make sure he was getting ready for school. Not the first time, not the second time, and not the third time. He said he hadn\u2019t been injured on patrol, May\u2019s words rang in Happy\u2019s ears, but you know how he is. Please just make sure he is okay. It was a reasonable request. The kid had a history of hiding injuries and down playing everything.\nWhen Happy reached the seventh floor, his knees hurt and he was more out of breath than he would like to be. Getting old sucked. He was already mildly irritated as he reached the Parker Apartment but before he could even raise his hand to knock the door swung open and revealed a shocked Peter Parker, hair sticking out in every direction, tooth brush hanging out of one corner of his mouth, clad in a familiar New York tourist shirt and Hello Kitty pajama pants. \u201cMy phone is dead,\u201d he said, not bothering to take the tooth brush out of his mouth. \u201cMy alarm didn\u2019t go off and I didn\u2019t get May\u2019s calls and I just woke up because I heard your car outside and \u2013\u201c\n\u201cHey, kid, try to get some breath between all of those words, alright?\u201d Happy interrupted him, his face already pulled in an annoyed grimace. He raced down to Queens for this? A teenager who overslept? However, he couldn\u2019t help but let his eyes scan the boy for any sign of injuries. There were none that he could see and Peter didn\u2019t seem to be in any sort of pain. The tension that had settled in his shoulders since he got May\u2019s call eased away. \u201cHow did your phone even die? I thought phones are more important than air for the kids these days.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Peter said, ranking a hand through his hair \u2013 which did not help him to look more awake \u2013 and finally took the brush out of his mouth. \u201cI thought I plugged it in but maybe I was too tired or something is wrong with my charger or \u2013 Happy, you have to help me! I can\u2019t be late again, and I won\u2019t make it in time if I take the subway!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to make sure you\u2019re alive, not to drive you around.\u201d\nPeter used his Puppy Eyes. They always worked on Tony. \u201cPlease!\u201d\nHappy wasn\u2019t Tony. \u201cIt\u2019s your mess, so you find a solution for it.\u201d\nHe could see Peter deflate in front of him before he picked himself up again. This kid was almost stupidly optimistic. \u201cWell, I guess I could always use my web shooters. It would only take about ten minutes.\u201d\nHappy suddenly remembered why this kid needed supervision. \u201cAnd have your identity revealed? Your aunt would bury me alive if that happens.\u201d He made a shoo-shoo gesture with one hand, trying to get the kid back into the apartment. \u201cBrush your teeth, brush your hair, put on one of your nerdy shirts and get your stuff for school. We\u2019re leaving in five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cHappy, you\u2019re the best!\u201d The smile Peter gave him was blinding, even though there was foamed toothpaste in one corner of his mouth. With a sigh, Happy stepped into the small hall and closed the door behind him, listening to Peter\u2019s hurried footsteps. As soon as he heard running water, he pulled out his phone to shoot May a quick text, assuring her that her nephew was in fact not dead and just a typical teenager.\nWhile he waited, Happy looked around in the living room. It wasn\u2019t big, actually rather small, with a couple of mismatched furniture, a TV, and a book shelf that was overflowing. It was nothing like any of Tony\u2019s spacious living rooms but it had a certain feeling of home. It felt like people really lived here, like memories were created in this spot. Or maybe it was just the fact that Tony got yelled at by May here.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to grab some food!\u201d Happy yelled as he heard the bathroom door open again. \u201cIf you\u2019re passing out because you forgot to eat, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s to pick you up. So, don\u2019t forget to eat.\u201d Peter yelled back an affirmation and continued to jump from one part of the apartment to the other. Meanwhile, Happy\u2019s attention had turned to the pictures that covered one of the walls. There were a lot of them, but he had never had a good look at them before. A ton load of Peter \u2013 everything from baby pictures to his current age. He spotted May and a man that he assumed was Ben as well.\nHowever, he paused at a particular photo. It was a wedding photo, bride and groom in the middle. Ben and May were there, too, as well as a toddler in a suit. Happy took a wild guess that it was Peter because he would recognize those curls anywhere. The bridal couple had to be Mary and Richard Parker, Peter\u2019s parents. But that wasn\u2019t what caught his attention. It was a swirling feeling in his deepest pit of his stomach that he knew the face of the bride. Happy Hogan never forgets a face. That was something he was quite proud of. But he just couldn\u2019t quite remember where he\u2019d seen the face before. When had he met Mary Parker? The swirling feeling intensified.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go!\u201d Peter declared as he came to a stop next to the bodyguard. He looked more presentable than five minutes ago, however, his hair was still doing whatever it wanted.\n\u201cAre those your parents?\u201d Happy asked, not moving an inch, eyes still glued to Mary Parker\u2019s face. Of course, he already knew the answer to that question even before he saw Peter nod yes. \u201cThey weren\u2019t married before you were born?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mom got pregnant and she, apparently, didn\u2019t want to look like a whale dressed in white on all the pictures, so they waited.\u201d Peter pointed to a different picture on the right. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite. It\u2019s the last one we took before they died.\u201d In the photograph were a six-year-old Peter with two missing teeth and his parents who all smiled brightly into the camera.\nHappy Hogan never forgets a face.\nAnd suddenly he remembered where he knew that face from. The blood in his veins turned cold and for a second his lungs forgot they need oxygen to function. He counted back the years, hoping it would calm his racing heart. Hoping it wouldn\u2019t match.\nBut it did.\n\u201cHappy?\u201d There was a hand on his shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nHappy finally tore away his gaze from the picture and looked at the kid. This stupidly brave kid that couldn\u2019t stop throwing himself in danger to protect everyone else. That was so terrifyingly smart, probably smarter than Tony himself. That fought against criminals with high-tech weapons while he himself was in a painted onesie and some tech he built out of scraps. That experienced more tragedy in his few years than other people did in their whole life and was still able to see the good in everyone.\nHappy took a deep breath in a hopefully subtle way \u2013 you kind of forget what subtle means when you\u2019re hanging out with Tony Stark \u2013 and turned to the door. \u201cYeah, of course. Now, c\u2019mon, I thought you want to be on time.\u201d\nIf Peter noticed something was off, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead he started talking a mile a minute like his usual self, telling him all about his last patrol \u2013 which was more than unnecessary because Happy already had that report \u2013 and the new Lego set he wants to build with his friend. Happy didn\u2019t interrupt him or gave any indication that he was listening; which didn\u2019t stop Peter from continuing. However, there were a few times when Happy almost asked the kid about his parents. It was a burning urge that was tickling under his fingernails but he kept his mouth shut.\nAs soon as he pulled up in front of the school, Peter jumped out of the car with a Thanks Happy! Bye Happy! and left him alone. Alone at last, Happy sighed and let his forehead slump against the stirring wheel. He could be wrong. He hoped he was wrong because the kid didn\u2019t need any more chaos in his life.\nBut there was one thing Happy was absolutely certain about: he had to talk to Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoss, Mr Hogan wishes to speak with you,\u201d FRIDAY announced as she turned down the music.\nTony didn\u2019t even look up from his blue prints and took another sip of his coffee. \u201cTypical. The moment I have actual important work to do, nobody knows what the words Do Not Disturb mean.\u201d He put down his mug and sniffed once. One of their newest products that was due to launch in a few days was malfunctioning and nobody could figure out what was causing it. Tony finally agreed to take a look at it. Pepper threatened to cut down his Peter Time if he hadn\u2019t found a solution by the end of the day, so he was quite motivated. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll call him later.\u201d\n\u201cHe insists that it is an urgent matter.\u201d\n\u201cIs somebody dying?\u201d\nThere was a pause, presumable because FRIDAY was delivering the question. \u201cNo, Boss. Nobody is dying.\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not urgent.\u201d\n\u201cHe is already outside the workshop.\u201d\nWith a sigh Tony spun around in his chair. On the other side of the giant glass walls was indeed Happy, not looking very happy. \u201cGo away!\u201d he screamed, knowing that FRIDAY would relay the message. Happy said something but no sound came throw the thick glass. Oh, and because Tony soundproofed about every room in the Tower. \u201cWhat? Oh, I can\u2019t hear you. I just assume that you\u2019re agreeing with me. Goodbye!\u201d He waved and turned back to the blueprints, determined to solve this quickly just so he was done with it. There were so many more fun things to do. For example, the little upgrade he had planned for Peter\u2019s suit.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d FRIDAY chimed in again, \u201che says it concerns Mr Parker.\u201d \u00a0\nTony stilled immediately. For a second, raw panic overpowered him. Did something happen? He didn\u2019t get any reports about injuries or something alike from Peter\u2019s AI yesterday. However, as soon as Peter took off the suit Tony had little to no way of knowing if something happened to him. He was still perfecting the watch that would fix that problem. Had he been too slow? \u201cLet him in, FRIDAY.\u201d\nAs soon as he heard the soft woosh of the opening doors the genius turned around again. But before he could even form his next words, Happy was already talking. \u201cThe kid\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t panic.\u201d\nHis blood pressure returned to a normal rate and air was flowing back into his lungs. \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have led with that?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have opened the door if I did.\u201d\nWell \u2026 that was true. Accepting that Happy wasn\u2019t leaving any time soon and arguing that he deserved a short break from all the problem-solving Tony leant back into his chair. And that was the only reason. Definitely not because he liked talking about Peter. It was the first reason. For sure. \u201cSo? What\u2019s up?\u201d\nHappy didn\u2019t answer right away. Instead, he sat down on a chair, stood up again, took a couple of steps in one direction, then in the other, and put his hands in his pocket just to take them out a few seconds later. He was fidgeting which was quite unlike him. Tony tried to ignore the bad feeling inside his chest that threatened to overwhelm him and just waited. It took his ex-bodyguard a couple of moments before he got his thoughts in order. \u201cMay called me this morning to check up on Peter because he didn\u2019t answer his phone.\u201d\nAnd there was that special kind of worry again that always grabs a hold of Tony whenever Peter\u2019s involved. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask again. There was a strange urge in him to send the kid a text, just to make sure everything was fine.\n\u201cYes, I told you, he\u2019s fine. His phone just ran out of battery.\u201d\n\u201cHow does that even happen? Teenagers always charge their phones.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why; the point is his alarm didn\u2019t go off and he didn\u2019t get any calls from his aunt. When I got there he just woke up and I drove him to school.\u201d\nTony knitted his eyebrows together in confusion. \u201cSo, what\u2019s all this about? Do you want me to build him a phone that never runs out of battery? Buy him an old-fashioned alarm clock?\u201d Another thought crossed his mind and his mood darkened immediately. \u201cDid this Flash kid gave him any trouble? I swear if Peter would just let me talk to him \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the bully or his alarm or any of that, okay?\u201d Happy snapped. Tony blinked. It\u2019d had been quite some time since Happy lost his patience like that. Whatever happened must\u2019ve really left an impact on him. The man took a deep breath to calm himself down, stuffing his hand back into his pockets and keeping them there. \u201cI took a look at the pictures in their living room while I waited.\u201d\nTony nodded. Of course, he knew the pictures. He\u2019d teased Peter endless about the one where he had chocolate ice cream all over his face. Happy hesitated to continue. \u201cWhat about those pictures, Happy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I never forget a face,\u201d he said. Tony nodded again, after all Happy had been the one to recognize Aldrich Killian. \u201cI recognized one of the faces. And, no, it wasn\u2019t Peter or May.\u201d Happy took another deep breath and the look in his eyes turned almost \u2026 soft? Sympathetic? Definitely nothing Tony liked. \u201cWhat do you know about Peter\u2019s parents?\u201d\n\u201cRichard and Mary Parker,\u201d Tony answered instantly, reciting all the information FRIDAY duck up on them all those months ago. \u201cThey\u2019re both absolutely brilliant scientists, specializing in bio- and genetic-engineering. Worked for Oscorp but quit shortly before their tragic plane crash that left Peter with Richard\u2019s older brother Ben and his wife May. Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was Mary Parker\u2019s face that I recognized,\u201d Happy finally confessed and looked at Tony like he expected him to get it.\nHe didn\u2019t. Instead he just blinked a couple of times. \u201cWhere and when did you meet Mary Parker?\u201d\n\u201cWhere and when did we meet Mary Parker,\u201d Happy corrected him. It still made no sense to Tony. \u201cIt took me a minute, but I remembered.\u201d\n\u201cRemembered what?\u201d\n\u201cThe conference in Detroit. About sixteen and a half years ago, give or take.\u201d It seemed like Tony could do was to blink. His brain had stopped working, refusing to process the words and their meaning. Happy pressed his lips into a very thin line. \u201cYou talked with her and \u2026 spend the night in a hotel room. Together.\u201d\n\u201cAre you \u2026 do you \u2026,\u201d Tony tried to take a deep breath but it was like there was not enough air in the room. He felt claustrophobic and the only thing stopping him from having a panic attack was the hope that he misinterpreted Happy\u2019s words. He had to. Because he couldn\u2019t possible mean \u2013\n\u201cI think there is a chance you might be Peter\u2019s biological father,\u201d Happy said and took the last bit of hope away.\n\u201cNo.\u201d The word was out of Tony\u2019s mouth before he could think about it. \u201cNo. Not possible. I would remember.\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d\nNo, he wouldn\u2019t. He barely remembered the conference but knowing himself and his past-playboy ways he could imagine what went down. But if it was true \u2026\n\u201cFRIDAY, try to get a hold of the guest list from that conference, please,\u201d he ordered, his mind racing to prove Happy wrong, to prove that it just couldn\u2019t be true. \u201cCheck for a Mary Parker.\u201d\n\u201cMary Fitzpatrick,\u201d Happy corrected again. \u201cHer and Richard married after Peter was born.\u201d\n\u201cRight away.\u201d A tense silence spread through out the workshop while the AI fulfilled her tasked. Tony was painfully aware of the fact that Happy was watching him like a hawk. His hands began to tremble and he longed for a drink. Or a whole bottle. But before he could even move a finger FRIDAY spoke up again. \u201cThere is a match, Boss.\u201d Immediately, there was a picture of a young, beautiful woman on the holographic screen.\nThere was a burning stone in Tony\u2019s stomach. \u201cAnd that Mary Fitzpatrick is the future Mary Parker?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Boss.\u201d A second picture popped up. Undeniably the same woman, only a bit older. All the genius could do was slump back into his chair, raking his hand through his hair, gripping a few strands tightly between his fingers. It couldn\u2019t be. It couldn\u2019t be true. It just couldn\u2019t. Because if it was true, if he truly was Peter\u2019s father it only meant he screwed up even more.\nHappy said something but he couldn\u2019t make out the words. His thoughts raced through his head, trying to remember that night \u2013 but nothing came up. He must have been quite drunk. Which wasn\u2019t really a surprise.\nSuddenly, there was a hand on his shoulder, shaking him. \u201cTony, you need to calm down.\u201d\n\u201cHow can I calm down?\u201d he exploded, jumping out of his chair, pacing around the room. DUM-E beeped somewhat concerned in a corner of the room, trying to wheel closer but Happy gave him a signal to stand down. \u201cHow can I be calm when there\u2019s a chance that \u2013 \u2026 when I could be \u2013 \u2026 I can\u2019t be calm!\u201d\nIt couldn\u2019t be true. There was no possible way that it was true. Because a Stark could only create weapons and destroy. They couldn\u2019t create things like Peter \u2013 so innocent and good and brave and sweet and intelligent and kind-hearted. He was everything Tony wasn\u2019t, so how could he have made him? Yes, sure, the kid had grown on him to the point where the billionaire would eagerly wait for him to stop by to work with him in the lab or tinker around or help him with his school work or watch a movie with him or just talk to him. Unlike Happy, he always smiled when he got multiple text from Peter \u2013 because the kid wasn\u2019t afraid of double texting \u2013 no matter the memes, GIFs or vine references. There was an unfamiliar, fierce protectiveness in him whenever Peter was in the slightest chance of danger. And, okay, maybe he had imagined what it would be like if he was actually his son but that was just that \u2013 imaginary. A fantasy to distract him from the chaos that was his life. Nothing more.\nBut if \u2026 if it was true? If it was true, he utterly failed Peter. Starting with not knowing that he even had a child to having him go through so many traumatic events \u2013 losing his parents, the spider bite, losing his uncle \u2013 without being there to comfort him and ending with taking him to Germany to fight superheroes. Taking his suit. Letting him fight the Vulture alone. Having a building collapse on him and being completely alone. Those things had been painful when Peter had just been his mentee, but now \u2026 now they were unbearable. Tony wasn\u2019t a father. A father wouldn\u2019t let anything like that happen to their kid.\n\u201cTony!\u201d He was spun around and looked right into the face of a concerned Happy Hogan. \u201cYou need to breath!\u201d\nI am was what he wanted to say but there wasn\u2019t any air in his lungs to get the words out. Gulping, he took a few short breaths. His whole body trembled and he gripped Happy\u2019s arms to ground himself on something.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony tried nodding but his body wouldn\u2019t do what he wanted. Happy guided him to the closest chair and sat him down. \u201cYou need to calm down, okay? There\u2019s no need to panic.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to panic?\u201d Tony repeated and sounded so much weaker than he liked.\n\u201cNo, not one bit,\u201d Happy continued before Tony could, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just a theory. It could be a coincidence. We have no concrete proof. You hear me? It\u2019s just a theory.\u201d\nThose words seeped through his thick skull and calmed his nerves enough for him to form a coherent thought. Happy was right. It was a theory. There was no proof that Peter really was his son. Everything could be a stupid scare. And a reminder that he should drink himself into oblivion ever again.\nHe needed that proof.\n\u201cFRIDAY, do we have anything in the lab to perform something like a paternity test?\u201d\n\u201cTony -,\u201c Happy tried but Tony was already on his feet again and pacing around the workshop.\n\u201cThere should be the proper equipment for such a test in Dr Banner\u2019s lab, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY answered.\nHe turned towards the door, his mind already in the lab two stories below. He was perfectly aware that he didn\u2019t need to go down there, after all FRIDAY could just tell him the results. However, it gave him something to do, gave him a reason to move and he just couldn\u2019t stand still right now. Happy was hot on his heels. \u201cDo we still have samples of Peter\u2019s DNA on file?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Boss.\u201d\n\u201cI take it we have mine as well. Will they be enough for the test to work?\u201d\n\u201cThey should be sufficient.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. Run the test.\u201d\n\u201cTony, just wait a second, will you?\u201d Happy almost yelled as they reached the elevator. The only reason Tony did stop was because the doors weren\u2019t open yet. \u201cDon\u2019t rush into it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d The doors finally opened and he stepped inside, immediately pushing the button for what once was Bruce\u2019s lab. Happy followed him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re running a DNA test.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what else am I supposed to do?!\u201d His voiced boomed in the small space. \u201cI need to know if it\u2019s true or not and then I can act accordingly to it. Because if it turns out that I\u2019m not \u2026 that we don\u2019t share the same DNA then all this worrying and talking and whatnot is completely superfluous. Just a stupid conversation that kept me from working.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do you act accordingly if it turns out you are his father?\u201d Something burned inside Tony\u2019s chest but he refused to answer that question. There was no point in thinking about what ifs.\nThe doors opened once again and Tony didn\u2019t waste a second stepping out of them and into the abandoned lab. He hadn\u2019t been in here ever since Bruce went MIA but he couldn\u2019t dwell on that. Maybe after he finds out that he and Peter weren\u2019t related. His eyes locked onto the only flickering screen that seemed to illuminate the entire room. For a second uncertainty and something like fear \u2013 though he couldn\u2019t say fear of what exactly \u2013 kept Tony from taking another step.\nDid he really want to find out? Couldn\u2019t he just continue without knowing? He seemed to do alright as a mentor, why should he change that? Afterall, he would be a terrible father.\n\u201cThe test is completed, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY announced. For an AI, she sounded almost sensitive.\nBlood rushed in Tony\u2019s ears. He could feel Happy\u2019s gaze on him again. Without really knowing how, he moved over to the still flickering screen, holding his breath. Tony wasn\u2019t a doctor. He preferred tinkering with robots instead of humans. But he knew enough about biology to understand the results.\nIt was a match.\nHealthy coping mechanisms and Tony Stark was not something that was used in the same sentence \u2013 except maybe this one. After all, he dealt with being kidnapped by becoming a superhero. Not your usual knee jerk reaction. So when he found out that the kid he discovered on YouTube who could a catch a bus with his bare hands and talked his ear off on a regular basis \u2013 without Tony being bothered by it one bit \u2013 was his actual, biological son, he did not cope well.\nHe let FRIDAY run the test three more times. After Tony demanded a fifth test, the AI informed him that it was highly unlikely the test results would change if they didn\u2019t change the DNA samples. It took Happy everything to talk Tony out of flying to Peter\u2019s school or cutting open his own arm to get fresh samples. Thus, Tony did what he always did whenever he tried to ignore a problem that was directly connected to his emotions.\nHe locked himself in his workshop and built something.\nIt took the genius five minutes to figure out the problem of their newest product. Three to fix it. Ten to find two other problems that would make trouble after a few months of using the product, and another ten to fix those problems. That wasn\u2019t nearly enough time for him to come to terms with his emotions, so he just kept going. Made a new version of the product; smaller, smarter, more durable, and with more features. Tony knew it would be too late to get this version launched on time \u2013 and he didn\u2019t even want to think about what kind of nightmare it would be for the marketing department \u2013 but it was always good to think about the next step. He kept himself busy; looked at projects he\u2019d lost interest in, looked over other Stark Industry products, fixed a few bugs, tried to figure out how to supply New York City with an endless supply of clean energy \u2013 just whatever popped inside his head. As long as it distracted him from the problem he should actually figure out and kept his hands busy, it was good enough for him.\nTime was irrelevant. A weird concept that exists for everyone else but him. That\u2019s why the billionaire had absolutely no idea how much time had passed as his deafening music was replaced by a very familiar clicking noise of high heels. There were only two people beside him who could enter his workshop after Tony ordered FRIDAY to lock the door. And he was quite sure that Rhodey didn\u2019t start wearing high heels. \u201cHey, Pep,\u201d he said, not moving his eyes from the holo-screen in front of him, \u201cI thought your conference in Washington wouldn\u2019t end until tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but Happy called me,\u201d she answered in a somewhat vexed voice. Suddenly there were slender fingers in his hair, working through the knots and easing some of the tension Tony refused to acknowledge away. Out of reflex, he closed his eyes for a second, finding familiar comfort in the motion. How did he deserve such a woman? \u201cSaid something happened and that it would be better if I came home right away.\u201d\nSo Tony was the one who had to tell her. The thought was almost as daunting as the one about talking to Peter \u2013 his son. Surely Pepper would be disappointed. How could he not know he had a son? How could he take his son to Germany to fight his fight? How could he put him in so much danger?\nTony did what Tony always did. Deflect.\n\u201cNothing happened.\u201d His eyes were still glued to the screen. \u201cEverything is good. You shouldn\u2019t have come. I mean, obviously I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re here and not stuck at some boring conference, but you didn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re happy to see me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy to see you.\u201d\n\u201cThen why won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d Her voice was soft, not irritated. Maybe she felt that something stirred him up. She\u2019d always been really good at this \u2013 emotions and all that stuff. Not like him. Her nails scratched over his scalp and he sighed silently. Defeated, Tony turned around to look up to his fianc\u00e9. Her strawberry hair was up in her usual ponytail, she was dressed in a white business costume and looked absolutely radiant. A small smile tucked at the corner of her mouth. \u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cHi.\u201d And then, because he was such a coward, he changed the subject. Again. \u201cI figured out what was wrong with the new product. Fixed it as well. And some other stuff. Shouldn\u2019t make any problems now.\u201d\n\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper tried again, her hands cupping his face, but once he started talking, he just couldn\u2019t stop.\n\u201cYeah, I also made the next version of it. And I thought about some other stuff that we should take a look at. Like alarm clocks. Or phone batteries that never die. Like ever. Or at least get some features in the phone, so some stuff should still work even though the phone isn\u2019t turned on. Like getting calls. Or alarms. I really can\u2019t stress the alarms enough. I mean, if you think about it, what opportunities were missed because someone overslept? What tragedies had happened because of it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are alarms so important?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re always important. We just forget that because we take them for granted.\u201d\n\u201cTony.\u201d Pepper raised one eyebrow and gave him one of her patented looks. He crumbled under it. Like always.\n\u201cPeter overslept this morning,\u201d he explained. Pepper didn\u2019t say anything. Maybe she already suspected that Peter was involved. Tony was always in this special kind of crazy when the kid was involved, and she had always been exceptionally good at recognizing the different kinds of crazy. \u201cHappy went to check on him and drove him to school.\u201d\n\u201cDid something happen at school?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the kid\u2019s fine. Probably swinging around Queens right about now and being busy making the world a better place.\u201d He took another shaky breath. He had to tell Pepper. Maybe she could help. She\u2019s great at dealing with his problems. An absolute pro. \u201cBut Happy saw a picture of Mary Parker and recognized her face \u2013 you know how he never forgets a face \u2013 and \u2026 well, long story short, I\u2019m Peter\u2019s father. And, no, not like a father-figure. His actual, biological, blood-related father.\u201d\nWhatever Pepper has suspected, this wasn\u2019t it. She looked at him, probably trying to figure out if he was messing with her. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time. But he was serious and she seemed to realize that as well. Her gaze turned soft and she opened her mouth, even though no words came out. It wasn\u2019t often that Pepper Potts was speechless. With every second that passed in silence the uneasiness in Tony\u2019s chest grew to an almost unbearable pressure.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure about it?\u201d Pepper finally asked.\n\u00a0\u201cYeah, pretty sure,\u201d Tony answered, not able to look her in the eyes anymore. \u201cI mean, I did four DNA tests and they all came back positive. Though, there\u2019s always a chance that there\u2019s a bug or something in the programming, so maybe I should do some more \u2013\u201d\n\u201cTony, you\u2019re rambling.\u201d He shut up. Her thumb stroked his cheek. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Sheepishly, he met her gaze again. Even though her gaze was still soft, Tony could see the resolve, too. He knew that look. Whatever she was about to say, she believed in her next words. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it though?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. Is it shocking? Yes. But it\u2019s not a catastrophe, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cI failed him, Pep,\u201d he confessed in a shaky voice. \u201cAgain, and again.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not and you will not. Peter adores you. You\u2019re his hero.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it. I don\u2019t deserve to be his hero and I sure as hell don\u2019t deserve to be his father. I don\u2019t even know how to be a father.\u201d\n\u201cI hate to break it to you, but you already kind of are.\u201d There was this small smile again but it was warmer this time around. \u201cPeter isn\u2019t an infant or a toddler. He\u2019s a teenager.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is objectively worse.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Tony. You\u2019re already doing everything any parent would do. You make sure Peter is safe \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI gave him a suit to fight crime. What parent does that? That\u2019s the opposite of keeping him safe.\u201d\n\u201cYou gave him a suit with countless settings, a GPS tracker, a heater, a parachute, a direct link to you, a personal AI, and about everything one needs when being a superhero. We both know that Peter won\u2019t stop being Spider-Man, whether he has your suit or not, so you made sure he is properly equipped. And, for Goodness sake, there are two of your suits on standby all the time, just in case Peter needs help. That sounds pretty safe to me.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t say anything, and Pepper took that rare chance and continued. \u201cYou teach him everything you know, whether it\u2019s about building something or how to tie a tie properly. You help him with whatever he needs help with, be it something simple like homework or something like all the negative side effects of being Spider-Man. You give him a place to stay whenever he needs one, you feed him, you make sure he sleeps, you take care of him when he\u2019s sick or injured, and, most importantly, you make sure he\u2019s loved. How is that any different from a real parent?\u201d\nHis throat is dry and raspy. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d Tony took a moment to let Pepper\u2019s words sink in. He did care for Peter. More than he would like to admit. And everything she said was true: he had a very active role in the kid\u2019s life and he chose to have this role \u2013 yes, he did try to keep him at an arm\u2019s length, but that hadn\u2019t worked out at all. He would drop anything and everything if Peter needed him. A world without him was unimaginable for Tony.\nBut was it enough? He had no clue what good fatherly behavior was like. Howard had always been strict, cold, and absent, barely talking to him unless it was to scold him. All his life, he\u2019d thought being a father was an incredible difficult task that he had just no patience or talent for. The closest thing to children were his robots and he threatened to turn them into lamps at least once a day. Was it really enough to just continue like nothing had changed? To do anything just to ensure Peter was happy?\nWith a sigh, Tony dropped his head against Pepper\u2019s stomach, closing his eyes. \u201cWhy are you always so good at this? It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you love it,\u201d she replied and he could hear the smile in her voice.\nOut of an impulse, he put his arms around her middle. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d She dropped a kiss on his hair before gently lifting his head to make him look into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, you hear me? I know it\u2019s quite scary right now, but there is no need to be scared.\u201d\n\u201cI have no clue what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out. You always do.\u201d His fianc\u00e9 brushed his hair back and stepped smoothly out of his embrace. He already missed her warmth. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone for now. After all, there is a lot of work I\u2019m missing because I left the conference.\u201d Tony was about to make a comment that would at least imply he was sorry for making her leave early, but her quick kiss shut him up. \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\u201cI never panic.\u201d\n\u201cRight, whatever keeps you asleep at night.\u201d The billionaire watched her go and slumped back into his chair as soon as she was out of his sight. He took a look at his flickering holo-screen that still displayed his latest project, but he\u2019d suddenly lost all interest in it. Instead Pepper\u2019s words echoed in his head. There was truth behind them, Tony knew that, but his own doubts distorted every logical thought he tried so desperately to form.\nIt was FRIDAY who ended his misery after \u2026 some time. He had, as usual, no idea how much time had passed. He should work on that. \u201cBoss, I just received Mr Parker\u2019s latest report from his AI.\u201d\n\u201cPlay it,\u201d he ordered without thinking about it. All off Peter\u2019s reports were saved in a special folder, though the kid didn\u2019t know that. He still thought he just left a voice mail for Happy that\u2019s why every single one of the reports started with the excited words Hi Happy!\nAt least until now.\n\u201cHi Mr Stark!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice rang through the workshop and Tony froze. Never ever had one of his reports been addressed to him. Not since the Vulture Incident. Tony wasn\u2019t really sure why the kid thought he wouldn\u2019t listen to him, but he wasn\u2019t correcting him. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t get a dramatic re-telling of his adventures as soon as Peter saw him in person. \u201cHappy said I should send this report to you because he was busy or something?\u201d That traitor. Tony made a mental note to give Happy a raise. Well, depending on the outcome of this little stunt. \u201cI don\u2019t know, he was in a weird mood, but I didn\u2019t want to pry too much. I think he\u2019s still grumpy that he had to check up on me this morning. Which won\u2019t happen again, I promise! I\u2019ll be more careful! Anyway, I\u2019ll keep it short, you\u2019re probably busy inventing super awesome things. So, I stopped a mugging \u2013 not a dangerous one! It was just a pursue and the guy didn\u2019t even have a knife or anything! Just tried to grab it and run. The lady gave me some gum afterwards. There was also a bike thief who I had to stop twice! Like, you would think would stop but he didn\u2019t, so I just webbed him up and called the police. What else? Oh, I gave some directions to a Japanese couple and took a selfie with them. And a kindergarten teacher almost strangled me.\u201d There was a sigh and Tony didn\u2019t even realize he was smiling. \u201cI should explain that. It was about twenty minutes after I started patrolling and I passed this little park and there were all these kids and they waved, so I figured I could make a quick stop. Turned out they had some field trip \u2013 which I thought was a bit weird, because it was already kinda late for them, y\u2019know? \u2013 to learn about insects and nature and everything. Then their teacher asked me if I could tell them something about spiders because I\u2019m Spider-Man and the kids seemed so excited, so I was like yeah, sure, no problem even though I hate spiders! Which is so ironic, y\u2019know? Spider-Man being afraid of spiders. Anyhow, all my research I did after the spider bite really paid off. I told them that spiders weren\u2019t insects but arachnids and everything and then \u2026\u201d There was another sigh. \u201cAnd then this boy, a really sweet looking kid, asked if spiders shoot their webs out of their hands just like I do and I, the big idiot that I am, said no, they shoot them out of their butt. I said butt in front of kids, Mr Stark!\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help but snort. \u201cThey all started giggling and saying butt and their teacher looked furious! I felt so bad, but I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I just said that I had to go to stop a crime \u2013 which I actually did, so it wasn\u2019t a complete lie \u2013 and just ran.\u201d He could practically see Peter\u2019s distressed face. \u201cMr Stark, what if their teacher tells them Spider-Man is a bad influence? Am I a bad influence?\u201d There was a strong urge in Tony to disagree even though he knew it would be pointless, after all it was a recording and Peter couldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cMan, I bet the Daily Bugle\u2019ll find out about it and write even more bad stuff about me. They don\u2019t like me at all.\u201d There was a moment of silence and Tony could hear some of the traffic noises. Peter was probably sitting on a rooftop, overlooking Queens. He\u2019d told him more than once that it was one of his favorite views. \u201cBut, yeah, that\u2019s about it. I think I kept it pretty short, right? Just the essentials. Bye Mr Stark!\u201d\nFor a minute, Tony just sat there, staring at the ceiling. A weird feeling bloomed in his chest \u2013 a feeling that always showed up whenever a certain Spiderling was involved. Peter was just so good in every way, despite all the shit that happened to him. He deserved something good as well \u2013 no, he deserved better. He deserved everything. That included a family that wasn\u2019t just May. Not that May wasn\u2019t doing a good job, she did a fantastic job, but every child deserved a mother and a father. Tony could actually give him that. And if that meant that he had to push all his insecurities aside to step up and work on himself to be a father that Peter could be proud of \u2013 then he just had to do that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs soon as the door opened, Tony flashed his most charming smile. \u201cSurprise! Your favorite billionaire is visiting!\u201d\nMay Parker raised an unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cOh, you brought Oprah?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m not even angry about it because it\u2019s Oprah.\u201d\nFor a second, she continued to look less than thrilled but then a smile crept onto her face. She stepped aside to let Tony in. \u201cI would\u2019ve said Norman Osborn, but after Peter\u2019s spider bite he slid down a couple of places on my list,\u201d she said as soon as she closed the door.\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d Tony asked, actually surprised.\nMay shrugged and they sat down on the couch. \u201cNo, I just met him. He was at Richard and Mary\u2019s wedding and he introduced himself. He was only there for a few minutes, after all a company doesn\u2019t run itself.\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 as long as I\u2019m above Justin Hammer, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony joked, but May waved her hand dismissively.\n\u201cOh no, Justin Hammer is at the very bottom of my list. He was the one behind the disaster of the Stark Expo in 2010.\u201d He nodded, even though there was a rush of panic that crashed over him. Peter had told him very casually \u2013 between rambling about MJ she is so smart, Mr Stark, and pretty and a bit scary, but did I already mention smart and pretty and his newest Spider-Man adventure \u2013 that he\u2019d been there with May and Ben, dressed up as Iron Man. That\u2019d tickled something in Tony\u2019s memory, and as the memory of a little boy dressed in an Iron Man helmet and cloves in front of the drone resurfaced, he almost had had a heart attack. Of course it turned out that that little boy had been his kid. The same stupid bravery and selflessness. He should\u2019ve connected the dots ages ago.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not here to ask me about my favorite billionaires.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d His eyes flickered to the wall that was covered with the Parker photographs. Almost immediately his gaze landed on the wedding picture of Mary and Richard, bathed in the morning\u2019s sunlight. For a moment he wondered why he\u2019d never really noticed it before. It had always been there, a bit too the left of his favorite Peter\u2019s-face-is-covered-in-ice-cream-photo.\nAfter deciding to give the father-son-thing a real, actual chance, he\u2019d realized that he needed to talk to May first. He couldn\u2019t do this without her. Not only because May knew what it was like to be a parent, but she was the most important adult in Peter\u2019s life. She\u2019d raised him and loved him like her on child. Tony knew that Peter felt the same way and would do anything to protect her. If she didn\u2019t want Peter to know the truth \u2013 which was a thought Tony didn\u2019t like at all \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t go against her will. \u201cI\u2019m here because of Peter.\u201d\n\u201cDid something happen?\u201d May asked, sitting up straight and worry in her eyes. \u201cHe promised me to tell me if something happened, but I\u2019ve been so busy with work lately \u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s fine. And by the way, you\u2019re very welcome to work at the med bay at the compound or even at the Tower. Better shifts, way better payment. A shockingly handsome boss.\u201d Tony winked, but she just shook her head no, a small smile on her face, and didn\u2019t say anything else. They\u2019d had this argument a lot of times and May always refused. Despite the hours and the not-really-good payment, she loved her job at the hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not about Peter per se, but \u2026 about 50 percent of him.\u201d\nWhen he had imagined this conversation, he\u2019d anticipated confusion. There was no confusion. Instead, May blinked once, twice, and then she seemed to understand. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for this. In fact, Tony had a whole speech with a lot of metaphors about finding out that he was Peter\u2019s father. \u201cYou found out that Richard isn\u2019t Peter\u2019s father.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said and sounded way calmer than he felt. His heart felt like it would break through his ribcage any second. His hands were itching with the need to move, but he kept them in his lab.\n\u201cAnd now you want to know who is.\u201d\nThat took him by surprise after hearing that she was aware of the not-his-father-situation. She knew it wasn\u2019t Richard, but didn\u2019t know it was Tony? \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mary didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d She sighed, running a hand through her hair. Tony sat still. This didn\u2019t play out like his imaginary scenarios at all. \u201cThey\u2019d this big fight. I don\u2019t know about what, but it had been bad enough that the broke up for a few months. Eventually, they worked through it, but Mary was already pregnant. She said it had been a one-time thing because she had been sad and angry and drunk.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Richard was okay with it?\u201d\nMay shrugged. \u201cYeah. He loved her and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. That meant living with another man\u2019s child and he accepted it. Took a few weeks, but he did. He loved Peter like his own, everyone could see that. It didn\u2019t matter to him that he wasn\u2019t his real father, Peter was his son.\u201d Tony could feel the melancholy radiating from her. \u201cRichard was a good, kind, and loving man.\u201d\nThere was a burning question inside him that wouldn\u2019t leave him alone since the moment Happy broke the news to him. \u201cDoes Peter know?\u201d\nSuddenly the woman in front of him deflated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, we\u2019ve never told him, but \u2026 A few months after we took him in, one of Ben\u2019s friends made a comment about it. Said it impressive that we took him even though he\u2019s not blood. Peter must\u2019ve overheard it because it asked what it meant. He was still working through the plane crash and we didn\u2019t want to drop the next bomb on him, so we just made some excuses, said that it meant he wasn\u2019t our own child. He seemed to buy it, but \u2026\u201d She shrugged again. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart kid. He never asked about it again, though, so we didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d\nTony couldn\u2019t tell if he was relieved or not. Was it good that Peter may have his suspicions? Was it bad? Would it make everything easier? But before he could figure out what exactly he was feeling, May spoke again. \u201cWhy is this suddenly important? Why do you need to know who is father is?\u201d She paused and knitted her eyebrows together. \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d\nWell, he couldn\u2019t get a better opening, could he. His heart was pounding in his chest. His palms were sweaty. He had to force his hands and feet to stay still. Despite knowing that this woman wasn\u2019t afraid to go toe to toe with a superhero/billionaire/genius, he looked her right into the eyes. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. You\u2019re looking at him.\u201d\nFor a heartbeat, May didn\u2019t move at all. Maybe she had suddenly forgotten English and couldn\u2019t understand his words. That didn\u2019t help Tony\u2019s rising blood pressure. Her mouth opened and closed a couple of times. Then, after what felt like an eternity, she found her words again. Her eyes were like steel. \u201cIf this is a joke, I\u2019m forbidding Peter from seeing you ever again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d he reassures her quickly, because the thought of never seeing Peter again was panic evoking. \u201cAnd, before you ask, I didn\u2019t know until, well, yesterday. I swear I didn\u2019t know when I first came here.\u201d\nShe seemed to soften a bit after hearing his words. However, she still looked very confused. He couldn\u2019t blame her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. When \u2026 How did this happen?\u201d\n\u201cYou know that Happy was in here yesterday? To check on Peter?\u201d Tony got a tight nod as an answer. \u201cHe took a look at your pictures here. And, I don\u2019t know if he ever told you, but he\u2019s really good with faces. Remembers them even after years and years. Not like me, I always forget everything by lunch. Anyway, he saw their wedding picture and remembered her. We met at a conference in Detroit about nine months before Peter was born.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just coincident?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I ran a DNA test, well \u2026 four tests. They all came back positive.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m his father.\u201d It was strange. A part of him was terrified of May\u2019s reaction, knowing that she would decide what would happen, and simultaneously he felt like a weight has been lifted of his shoulders.\nAbruptly, May jumped to her feet, muttered that she would be right back and left the room. Tony didn\u2019t know what to do. He really didn\u2019t expect her to just bail on him. She was quite talkative, just like Peter, so he\u2019d imagined some kind of conversation. But before he could even made up his mind about a possible scenario \u2013 maybe she kept one of Ben\u2019s guns and even though she wasn\u2019t the aggressive type, perhaps that changed when she found out a certain not-favorite billionaire was the father of her beloved nephew \u2013 she came back with a nondescript envelope.\n\u201cI kind of forgot about it because we never needed it,\u201d she explained as soon as she sat back next to him, \u201cbut Mary did write his name down. Just in case, you know? Like if there was a family disease or something. I don\u2019t know if she knew that something would happen to her, but \u2026\u201d For a moment May was lost in her thoughts, her eyes sad, but before he could offer some comfort, she already snapped out of it. \u201cWe were close to opening it once, back when Peter got bitten and we didn\u2019t know what happened. Took him to the hospital, but they couldn\u2019t explain what was happening. He was fine the next morning, though, so we didn\u2019t.\u201d She turned the envelope in her hands, like she wasn\u2019t sure if she should really do this, but in the end, she handed it to him.\nTony didn\u2019t like being handed things. But he took this eagerly. He didn\u2019t even hesitate, there was no panic looming over him, not like there\u2019d been when he run the tests. Inside was a single paper, not very large, and in curly but legible letters two words were written in the center of it.\n\nTony Stark\n\nHe let out a breath that he didn\u2019t know he was holding. Because what if it hadn\u2019t been his name? What if the samples had been too old or there\u2019d been a bug in the programming? Tony honestly couldn\u2019t tell what he would have done if any other name had been written on this paper. To think \u2013 accept \u2013 that Peter was his son and then have that taken away? It would\u2019ve been worse than a nightmare.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d May whispered next to him, reading over his shoulder. \u201cIt really is you.\u201d\n\u201cTold you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help the sarcasm, it was one of his coping mechanisms, but he sobered up quickly. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You raised him. I\u2019m not doing anything that you\u2019re not okay with. If you don\u2019t want him to know, then I\u2019ll never mutter a word to him about it.\u201d\nShe looked taken aback and stared at him. Tony just stared back. He\u2019d kind of hoped that the woman would merely tell him what to do. Like, give him a five-step plan on how to be a good parent. But instead, she simply shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do. Whatever you want to do with this information, I\u2019ll support it.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. I \u2026 expected more yelling.\u201d\nThat cracked a smile out of her. \u201cWell, I admit that I haven\u2019t been your biggest fan. But it\u2019s pretty obvious how much you care about Peter and \u2026 I mean, you can help him with all this superhero stuff that I can\u2019t, but that\u2019s not all. Spending time with you makes him happy. And I think you\u2019re filling a gap that Ben left.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to replace him,\u201d Tony interrupted because he truly didn\u2019t. Not once had he ever thought he could take Ben\u2019s place.\n\u201cI know. But whether Peter realizes it or not, he needs some kind of father. He deserves one. You\u2019ve been willing to be that before you found out about all of this. That\u2019s makes you good enough in my book.\u201d May smiled at him and the billionaire had the strange urge to hug her. \u201cSo? What do you want to do?\u201d\n\u201cI want to tell him,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI want to give this a proper try. If Peter lets me, that is.\u201d\nShe nodded, still smiling. \u201cThen tell him. He\u2019s going to the Tower on Friday anyway. That might be a good chance. He can even spend the night, if he wants to.\u201d\nGrateful \u2013 because Tony still couldn\u2019t believe that the woman that yelled at him gave him so much support \u2013 he reached out and squeezed her hand. \u201cThank you, May. You know, if you would work for me, I would give you a raise right now.\u201d May just threw back her head and laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony had been a complete wreck for the last couple of days. Not like he was when he thought he was dying of palladium poisoning. No, he was a wreck in a completely different way because he was so nervous. After basically his entire life in the spotlight, he forgot was being nervous was like. He got used to just act and then deal with the consequences \u2013 or simply ignore the consequences. Now he was so terrified of the consequences that he didn\u2019t know how to act.\nThere was a plan: Happy would drop Peter off at the Tower straight after school to tinker in his workshop, just like always. Tony would be waiting with two pizzas - because the kid\u2019s metabolism was simply off the charts - just like always. Then he would carefully ask him about Richard and what he knew and break the news that Tony was in fact his father. It was a simple plan. An easy to follow plan. Pepper, Rhodey \u2013 who had been enlightened about the situation at hand \u2013 and Happy approved this plan. The genius had practiced with DUM-E, but the robot just didn\u2019t get Peter\u2019s personality right. He\u2019d been very eager to try, though. He\u2019d been this close to posting something along the lines of Help! My mentee turned out to be my son, what do I do, please help me on a website for expecting parents. FRIDAY had run simulations with the most likely scenarios. Tony was probably as prepared as one could be.\nAnd he was still nervous.\nHe wanted this to go well so badly. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. Because if he did, he might loose Peter. He couldn\u2019t lose Peter.\n\u201cBoss, Mr Hogan and Mr Parker just arrived at the garage,\u201d FRIDAY informed him.\nTony could feel his blood pressure rising. He glanced at the freshly delivered pizzas, at the holo-screens that displayed one of the more recent projects, so it wouldn\u2019t look like he was sitting around the whole day just waiting for this moment \u2013 even though he\u2019d been doing exactly that. \u201cSend him up.\u201d\nThe music turned down a couple of notches without Tony giving the command. It was one of the protocols he\u2019d installed as he found out about Peter\u2019s heightened senses. As soon as he entered the building, music wouldn\u2019t turn up over a certain point so it couldn\u2019t hurt him, and there were absolutely no flashing lights to irritate his eyes. It only applied to the private areas of the Tower, but still. Tony didn\u2019t want to take any risk. Not if it could hurt the kid. His kid.\nThere was the nervousness again.\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for the elevator to reach his workshop and before Tony could be even remotely ready, Peter was already walking into the lab, a spring in his steps and a smile on his face that was bright enough to power all of Manhattan. \u201cHi Mr Stark!\u201d\n\u201cHey kiddo,\u201d Tony greeted him, turning in his chair to see the boy drop his backpack \u2013 number three of the month \u2013 next to a worktable. Something burned inside his chest and almost made him threw up the five mugs of coffee he\u2019d had today. Instead he just motioned for the pizza. \u201cHungry?\u201d\n\u201cStarving!\u201d His eyes lit up as he saw the boxes as if it was totally surprising to see them. He did that every time. Like he couldn\u2019t believe Tony would do something as simple as feed him. Eagerly Peter grabbed the first box and took a bite of a slice. \u201cThis is so good.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s even better when you\u2019re closing your mouth so I can actually enjoy my pizza,\u201d Tony teased and pulled his box closer, even though just the thought of forcing down some food seemed impossible. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Like he predicted \u2013 hoped \u2013 Peter jumped right in and was, somehow, recounting his entire day at school while inhaling his food at once. That boy never ceased to amaze him.\nBy the time Peter had devoured his pizza, he was also at the point where Happy picked him up from school. \u201cSounds like you had a very exciting day, kid,\u201d Tony commended, his heart pounding in his chest. A part of him feared that Peter would hear it. But he didn\u2019t say anything, just nodded his head up and down enthusiastically, swallowing the last bit of food.\nThis was it. This was his chance. He couldn\u2019t postpone it because Peter was already eyeing the project on the screen and would definitely ask about it. If he did, Tony, being the coward he was, would take that opportunity to avoid talking about the elephant in the room. It had to happen now. His hands itched to have something to do, so he grabbed a pen and twirled it between his fingers. It didn\u2019t take anything of the nervousness away. \u201cPete, there is actually something I want to talk to you about.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d But Tony only had half of his attention, because the teenager\u2019s eyes had drifted down to the uneaten pizza. After a nod from his mentor, Peter grabbed a slice. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\nBreath in and out. In. Out. You can do this. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about your parents.\u201d\nPeter froze, his eyes snapping to Tony who tried \u2013 and probably failed, because it felt like a failure \u2013 to seem calm. For a moment the kid was just looking at him, the gears in his head turning, trying to figure out where this was going. Then, finally, he took a bite. \u201cLike, their work? Or their death?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not about any of that.\u201d\n\u201cAbout my dad not being my father?\u201d\nAlthough Tony knew there\u2019d been a possibility that Peter knew, he hadn\u2019t really been prepared for it. He definitely hadn\u2019t been prepared for the impartiality in his voice. A feeling that Tony couldn\u2019t name replaced the nervousness for a second, but it wasn\u2019t better. \u201cYou know?\u201d His voice sounded weaker than he wanted.\nBut Peter simply shrugged and nodded. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d\n\u201cHow -\u2026 How did you find out?\u201d\n\u201cWell, Jim, one of Ben\u2019s friends, said this really weird thing about me not being blood, right? And I was about, like, seven and didn\u2019t know what it meant, but May and Ben just said that he said it because I wasn\u2019t their son. Hadn\u2019t really made sense for me back then, but I didn\u2019t want to ask too much because they always got really upset whenever I talked about family and everything that was somehow connected to my parents. A few years later when I just started Middle School, we read this book and there was a line that was pretty similar to what Jim had said and the teacher said that it meant that you weren\u2019t related. I didn\u2019t really want to ask them again, because they just started talking about my parents again without being upset, so it just, like, was in the back of my head and I didn\u2019t do anything about it. Until we visited Midtown High to take a look at the school. So, Ned, who knows by the way, and I knew that they would show off all their cool tech to impress everyone. I stole some of Ben\u2019s hair out of the comb and then we ran a DNA test.\u201d Peter shrugged again. \u201cIt didn\u2019t match. If Dad was my father, then there should\u2019ve been at least some similarities, right? But there was none at all. And I know that I look like Mom, so the only conclusion was that Dad isn\u2019t my father.\u201d\n\u201cYou executed a DNA test when you were how old?\u201d\nHe gave half a shrug. \u201cNed helped me.\u201d\n\u201cYour friend Ned that hacked my multimillion-dollar suit? That Ned?\u201d Of course it was a rhetorical question. Peter had two friends \u2013 and that was including MJ, though Tony wasn\u2019t really sure if she could be classified as a friend. \u201cKiddo, you know that you two nerds aren\u2019t the standard for normal teenage shenanigans, right?\u201d Peter chose to ignore that comment and instead took another bite. \u201cYou seem awfully calm about this.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, now. Wasn\u2019t so calm the first time around. After all, it was my first identity crisis.\u201d\n\u201cYour first? As is more than one?\u201d\n\u201cMy second was when I find out I had powers.\u201d Tony wondered if Peter would get another identity crisis if \u2013 when \u2013 he found out that he was Tony Stark\u2019s son. \u201cAnd I had a lot of time to think about it, you know? I know I\u2019m not related to Ben and May, but they raised me and loved me and we\u2019re a family in everything but blood. Besides, there\u2019re so many families with adopted kids or foster children and they\u2019re still a family, right? So, it\u2019s just like we\u2019re one of them.\u201d\nSomehow, FRIDAY had not prepared Tony for this. In every scenario, Peter had had some curiosity about his biological father, but right now he seemed indifferent. Maybe it was because he\u2019d had so much time to thing about it. Maybe it was because he was a crime fighting superhero now and other things were more important now. Maybe he was just acting okay. Maybe it was something completely different, Tony couldn\u2019t tell. In his mind, there was only one question that was on repeat: should he actually tell him? The kid didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to know. Would it be better if Tony just keep his mouth shut? It could prevent a disastrous argument, even if it also meant that Tony would always be a mentor to him, nothing more.\nThe thought filled him with a cold feeling that was almost hurtful.\n\u201cWhy d\u2019you want to know?\u201d Peter asked, mouth already filled with more pizza again. \u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d Suddenly, his eyes went comically wide and if the billionaire hadn\u2019t been freaking out, he would\u2019ve laughed. \u201cDid you talk to May about it? She doesn\u2019t know! I mean, she doesn\u2019t know that I know. I don\u2019t actually know if she knows about my dad. Anyway, please don\u2019t tell her! She would freak out, I just know it!\u201d\nTony had been prepared. He\u2019d practiced, he had a really well written speech \u2013 that Pepper had proofread - and he had back up plans for his back up plans.\nBut, in a true Tony Stark-fashion, he made a rash decision and changed his mind.\n\u201cI am,\u201d he confessed. \u00a0Suddenly, words were unbelievable difficult to form and he just prayed that the kid would understand. After all, he was a genius just like Tony himself.\nPeter\u2019s eyes grew even more and he paled. Not the reaction Tony had hoped for. \u201cYou told her? Mr Stark, I -\u201c\nSo he didn\u2019t understand what he wanted to say. \u201cNo, Pete, I am your father.\u201d\nThis time, his face transformed so fast if Tony had been able to blink, he would\u2019ve missed it. Peter was beaming, his eyes shining. A knot in his chest started easing away. \u201cWas that a Star Wars reference?\u201d\nOf course. Of course, he would be so excited about his favorite movies that he would actually not get the meaning of the words. Tony sighed, wondering why this was so hard even though he was as blunt as he could be. \u201cNo. Peter, listen to me. It\u2019s not a movie reference or a joke or anything, okay? I am your father.\u201d His eyes were trained on Peter\u2019s face, making sure he would understand it this time for sure. \u201cYou\u2019re my son.\u201d\nPeter had an incredible expressive face. Tony loved it. Every little emotion was amplified. Whenever the kid was excited or happy, his whole face would light up, making it impossible for Tony to look away. Somewhere along the way, the billionaire had made it his unofficial goal to see this blinding joy as often as he could \u2013 it was quite handy that the kid got excited very easily. Unfortunately, it also meant that whenever Peter was sad, it was absolutely heartbreaking to watch.\nBut watching him trying to process the news was nerve-wracking. Tony could pinpoint the exact moment Peter understood the words. His first thought was that it had to be a joke \u2013 just like everyone else \u2013 because he was searching his face for any indication of it. He found none. Then there was the confusion. Tony could basically see all the questions that were running through Peter\u2019s head. The kid didn\u2019t even blink, just kept staring at him. It was the longest Peter had been silent in Tony\u2019s present since they met.\nMeanwhile, the billionaire started fidgeting. Should he just start with a lengthy explanation? Would Peter even listen to a single word he said? What if he had different questions than Tony plant for? The kid had always had a strange habit to ask weird questions during the most inappropriate of times.\nEventually, Peter opened his mouth, and actual words came out of it. \u201cI\u2019m \u2026 your son?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cLike \u2026 like a family?\u201d\nTony simply nodded. There was a sarcastic response on the tip of his tongue \u2013 something along the lines of Geez, kid, I thought you inherited my brain. What other kind of son is there? \u2013 but he had to be serious right now. Normally Peter would always understand his coping mechanism to play everything off as a joke, but Tony couldn\u2019t risk him misinterpreting it as teasing. The kid may clam up and stop talking which was the complete opposite of what Tony wanted. He needed to have this conversation with him, no matter how uncomfortable they were.\nPeter looked like he wanted to say more, but stopped himself. Closed his mouth, thought some more, opened his mouth again \u2013 and stopped again. Tony had to actually bite down on his tongue to not say anything.\nGive him time to process, he repeated in his head. He\u2019d read on a lot of parenting websites that time \u2013 to process or whatever \u2013 was important. If Peter wanted time, then Tony would give him all the time he needed.\nFinally, he found his voice again. \u201cI \u2026 don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhat exactly?\u201d\n\u201cAny of it.\u201d For a second, Peter looked like he was actually in pain from all the questions running through his brain. \u201cI have so many questions.\u201d\n\u201cSure, whatever you want to know,\u201d Tony offered eagerly, relieved that Peter was talking to him. \u201cShoot away.\u201d\n\u201cHow did this,\u201d he made a vague gesture with his hand which could\u2019ve meant anything, \u201chappen? Like, everything. The whole story.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it started when Happy drove over to your place because your phone died. That morning, he took a look at your pictures and recognized Mary.\u201d\n\u201cHappy\u2019s very good with faces,\u201d Peter whispered, almost like he didn\u2019t even realize that he said anything. Tony nodded, briefly wondering why he knew that. What kind of conversation were they having that that particular fact came up? Probably something about movies. Peter loved movies and Happy was excellent at recognizing actors.\n\u201cHe is. Anyway, he remembered that I met her at a conference. We talked, we drank, and we \u2026 left together.\u201d For a second, Peter grimaced, but Tony couldn\u2019t blame him. No kid wants to hear about their parents having sex. \u201cWe didn\u2019t keep in touch. About nine months later, you were born.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure that you \u2026 I mean \u2026\u201d Peter\u2019s face was bright red and he couldn\u2019t look him in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re sure that you didn\u2019t just, like, \u2026 fall asleep or played some cards or something like that? I mean, you said you were quite drunk, and maybe you just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI ran four tests. They were all positive,\u201d Tony said, deciding to save the kid from his own stuttering. However, there was a sharp pain in his chest. Was the thought of Tony being his father so terrible that he needed to make sure they weren\u2019t playing some cards or something like that? \u201cAlso, May had an envelope from your mom with your father\u2019s name in it. With my name.\u201d\n\u201cMay knows?\u201d Peter asked, head snapping up, panic written all over his face.\n\u201cI went to talk with her,\u201d he tried to calm the kid down, but somehow it only felt like he was making it worse. His own panic started blooming in his chest. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. He couldn\u2019t. This was too important. \u201cShe knew that Richard isn\u2019t your father, but she didn\u2019t know that I am.\u201d Peter was staring at him, eyes wide and he looked so, so young. Tony grew incredible nervous. \u201cI couldn\u2019t not talk to her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you never tried to contact her? My mom, I mean.\u201d\nTony\u2019s guilt quadruplicated. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Like I said, we drank. A lot. We didn\u2019t exchange numbers or anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that he had barely any memories of the night. The few that he had were very vague \u2013 so vague that he wasn\u2019t completely sure they were of that particular night. But Peter didn\u2019t need to know that, right? \u201cAnd, honestly? Normally women with pregnancy claims come to me, not the other way around. They\u2019re all false, of course, so I never thought about checking up on \u2026 the others.\u201d Suddenly, he was very aware about his carelessness. Another thing he had to fix in order to be a father Peter deserved.\n\u201cSo \u2026 it was Mom\u2019s fault for not contacting you?\u201d\nThe billionaire almost winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. Look, Pete, there isn\u2019t just one person to blame, okay? I didn\u2019t try to talk to Mary, and she didn\u2019t tell me. The situation was \u2026 badly handled.\u201d\nFor a second that felt like an eternity, the only sound inside the workshop was their heavy breathing. The emotions on Peter\u2019s face were changing so fast that Tony couldn\u2019t identify them properly. Was it anger or worry he was seeing? Disappointment or sadness? Denial or disgust? Damn it, he should\u2019ve stuck with his Pepper-approved speech. He was using all the wrong words; his usual charisma threw itself out of the window the second he diverged from his original plan.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Peter said, eyes lowered in concentration, like he was trying to solve an especially difficult equation, \u201cwhat you\u2019re saying is \u2026 that it was an accident? A mistake?\u201d\nTony\u2019s blood turned to ice. Shit. \u201cNo,\u201d he said as firmly as he could. He knew Peter good enough to understand the true meaning behind his words. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a mistake. You hear me? Not a mistake. Was it unplanned? Yes. Poorly handled? Definitely yes. But it wasn\u2019t a mistake, because you\u2019re here because of it. And you\u2019re \u2013\u201c You\u2019re one of the best things that has ever happened to me. You are the future of the Avengers and you will change the world, as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man. You\u2019re too good to be in the same room as me, much less related to me. I don\u2019t deserve your idolization, I don\u2019t deserve to be your hero or mentor, and I sure as hell don\u2019t deserve to be your father. You\u2019re so unbelievable important to me that it scares me. You\u2019re my son and I\u2019ll do anything I can for the rest of my life to be worthy enough to be in your life. \u201cYou\u2019re not a mistake.\u201d\nPeter looked up again and Tony\u2019s heart broke a little \u2013 well, not a little. A lot. Tears were welling up in his big brown eyes, his shoulders were hunched and he pulled at the already worn out hemline of his sleeves. The words Tony wanted to say \u2013 had to say \u2013 were stuck in his throat, unable to come out of his mouth. He knew he should say them, let Peter know how important he was to him. But he couldn\u2019t. There was this unshakeable fear of rejection in him that forced him to be cautious. After all, there were plenty of examples why everyone he trusts ends up betraying him.\nBut this is Peter. This isn\u2019t Obadiah. This isn\u2019t Steve. This is Peter.\nHowever, before Tony could gather every ounce of courage in his body, the boy before him already acted. Faster than he could blink, Peter was standing, his head bowed. \u201cI-I should go,\u201d he said to the floor.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked breathlessly and for a second \u2013 a second in which Peter already gathered his backpack and was two feet closer to the elevator \u2013 he was completely unable to do anything. He screwed up. Peter was leaving. He didn\u2019t want Tony to be his father. Peter took another two steps and, finally, Tony snapped out of his daze, jumping to his feet. \u201cNo, hey, kiddo, wait a second. Don\u2019t leave. I - \u2026 we have to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure May\u2019s already waiting for me,\u201d Peter lied, because they both knew she wasn\u2019t.\nTony hurried to catch up with him, but he was almost at the elevator, the doors already open. \u201cPeter, stay. We should talk about this.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t stop. Tony\u2019s heart was beating wildly in his chest, panic overriding every logical thought in his brain. \u201cOr we don\u2019t have to talk. Not about this or anything at all. Just complete silence. We can tinker around, upgrade your suit \u2013 or my suit, you want to play around with one of them anyway, right? We could even go for a quick flight through the city.\u201d Peter was inside the elevator now. Desperation made the billionaire ramble. \u201cOr we could watch a movie. Or \u2013 or a Star Wars marathon? You can choose the order, and I promise I won\u2019t make any snarky comments. Or, maybe, if you\u2019re not in the mood for sci-fi, we could watch that cop show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine? You wanted me to watch it, remember? We could totally do that now. We\u2019ll just order enough food to feed an army and watch TV.\u201d Tony could literally feel all his chances run through his fingers as if it were sand. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nPeter slowly lifted his teary eyes and it felt like the Hulk punched Tony in the gut. Repeatedly. Without his suit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter whispered, barely loud enough to reach his ears.\nFor a split second, Tony thought about ordering FRIDAY to initiate the Lock Down Protocol. The doors wouldn\u2019t close. No elevator would move. No door or window would open. Peter wouldn\u2019t have a way to escape, unless he would punch an actual hole through the wall. The thought almost made him sick. He wanted Peter to stay because he wanted to, not because he trapped him. Unable to move even the smallest muscle in his body, Tony just watched the doors close right in front of him, taking Peter away from him.\nFeelings \u2013 too many to identify them \u2013 came crushing down on him, almost knocking him off his feet. Suddenly, breathing was so much more difficult than before. A single thought was on repeat: He screwed up. He screwed up. He lost one of the most important persons in his life. Peter didn\u2019t want him. Didn\u2019t want to be related to him. That\u2019s why he ran. What other reason could there be? He was probably disappointed. Was Tony only good enough to be an idol or mentor, but not a father? He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Tony always knew he would be a shit father. He\u2019d had a shit father, so it was inevitable that he would become a shit father, too.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d FRIDAY interrupted and sounded almost caring, \u201cMr. Hogan was made aware of the situation, and is driving Mr. Parker home.\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t sure if he managed to nod or not. He sure as hell didn\u2019t manage to form some words. His eyes roamed through the workshop, making his heart ache. Wherever he looked, he was reminded of Peter. The kid\u2019s workbench with his half-finished project, and dirty beakers from his last batch of web fluid. The beaten couch where he would occasionally take naps. The old car engine they disassembled, so Tony could teach him how to put it back together step by step. The little hole in the wall where they tested a batch of web fluid that turned out to be acid. The slightly bigger hole a little to the left where Tony let Peter try out an Iron Man repulsor. His own holo-screen that had several folders about Peter: his patrol reports, new ideas for suit upgrades, data about his mutation, every single message he\u2019d ever sent him, numerous ideas for his birthday and Christmas presents, files about May, Ned, MJ, his teachers, and that bully Flash.\nHe couldn\u2019t stay here. It was physically impossible for him to stay in the workshop and not think about Peter and what he just lost because he was such an idiot.\u00a0 Tony\u2019d had a plan! A good plan! And he screwed it up. Screwed up what had possibly been his only chance to do this right. Without really knowing what he was going to do, Tony stepped into the elevator. \u201cTo the penthouse,\u201d he ordered. FRIDAY didn\u2019t answer, just executed his command, and he was grateful.\nBut it turned out that the penthouse wasn\u2019t really that much better. As he walked into the open living area, Tony was overcome with more memories. Movie marathons on the couch, eating take out on the floor, playing video games, trying to get Peter to come down from the ceiling while the boy was sleep walking, eating home cooked dinners at the way too big dining table, helping him with his homework, falling asleep on the couch together. The Tower had started to feel like a home because of Peter. Because he created all these memories with Peters in here. And now he was gone. There wasn\u2019t a room in this damn building that wouldn\u2019t remind him of the kid \u2013 and what he\u2019d lost.\n\u201cI screwed up,\u201d he breathed, needing to get the words off his chest. \u201cI screwed it all up.\u201d Unshed tears started to burn in his eyes.\n\u201cIf I may, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY interrupted, not unkindly, \u201cbased on my research, I do not believe that you failed.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to lie to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou programmed me. I could never lie to you.\u201d Well \u2026 that was true. \u201cAccording to my observations and research, Mr. Parker did not reject you, but left to process and evaluate the situation. After all, you needed time to think as well, Boss.\u201d The AI paused, maybe to give Tony time to see the truth in her words. \u201cTherefore, I do not believe that you screwed it up. You simply need to wait.\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t sure if he should be ashamed that an AI was better with emotions than he was, or proud that he could program an AI like that.\n\u201cI\u2019m shit at waiting,\u201d he finally said, not sure what to make of her words. Everything seemed too raw, too hurtful, too hopeless.\n\u201cI\u2019m positive you will manage, Boss.\u201d\nOh, Tony did manage. Somewhat. Well, not really. He went to the only place in this damn building that didn\u2019t hold any memories of Peter: his bar. Sometime after his second drink, he got a message from Happy, saying that he dropped the kid safely off at his place. During the entire ride, Peter had been silent, except for a quite thank you. Even later, when the bottle of scotch was almost half empty, he got a message from May. Peter was quiet and shaken, and she\u2019ll keep an eye on him for the next few days. Tony didn\u2019t answer any of the messages \u2013 neither the ones from Pepper or Rhodey \u2013 and just kept drinking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude.\u201d Ned\u2019s eyes were comically wide, and if they\u2019d been in any other situation, Peter would have laughed. \u201cFor real?\u201d Peter only managed a nod. \u201cTony Stark, the Tony Stark, Iron Man is your father?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, and there was that pressure on his chest again. He had to clear his throat to get rid of that sticky feeling on his vocal cords. \u201cApparently he is.\u201d\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d his best friend whispered in awe. \u201cFlash will lose his shit. Peter, I swear your life is literally like a movie. You\u2019re a superhero and the secret son of a genius billionaire who is also a superhero? I mean, c\u2019mon!\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t answer. Instead he picked at a lose threat of his hoodie, desperately trying to force back the tears that were already gathering in his eyes again. He hoped that the numb feeling would return soon. That was way easier to deal with than the constant need to cry. It felt like he had been doing this for the past twenty-four hours \u2013 crying or feeling numb. Ever since Tony told him about \u2026 the situation, Peter was going through emotional overload. It was a bit like his sensory overload, except with emotions. Well, not every emotion. Just the crying-emotions. The smallest things would make him want to cry. It didn\u2019t even have to make sense. This morning, he looked at his usual cereals and, boom, tears in his eyes. And then, as if nothing could bother him, he felt nothing at all, thought nothing at all. His head was filled with white noise and everything seemed less important.\nIt didn\u2019t help that everyone he was talking to looked at him with so much sympathy. First Tony who\u2019d looked like he was in actual pain explaining the situation. Then Happy who didn\u2019t even had to ask what happened, and lastly May who had just hugged him so tight that Peter had been wondering if she had super strength as well. Everybody knew. Everybody but him. That thought hurt more than he liked to admit, and he had to do something. He needed someone who was just as unaware of the situation as him. So, he went to Ned. Needless to say, he was just as surprised as Peter. However, he was handling it way better.\n\u201cYeah. Awesome.\u201d He almost chocked on his own words.\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Ned asked, his eyes brows furrowed together in confusion. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you excited about it? I mean, it\u2019s obviously shocking, like, so surreal. What even is your life? But you were talking about Tony Stark being your father all the time when we were younger.\u201d\n\u201cBack then, it was just a stupid fantasy.\u201d\n\u201cWell \u2026 it\u2019s not anymore.\u201d\nThere was a lump as big as Queens in his throat. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m his son.\u201d Tears were blurring his vision and his voice cracked. Half hoping Ned wouldn\u2019t hear him \u2013 and because he really needed to get it off his chest \u2013, he whispered: \u201cIt all makes sense now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes sense?\u201d\nA single tear spilled from the corner of his eye, and he wiped it away quickly. \u201cWhy Mr Stark spends time with me.\u201d\nEven without looking at him, Peter could see Ned deflating, his shoulders slumping down. \u201cPeter \u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about that the whole time, y\u2019know?\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop now. It was like a dam inside him was broken and all the words were just tumbling out of his mouth. \u201cI mean, I get why he would be interested in Spider-Man. But I never understood why he would be interested in Peter Parker. I\u2019m just some loser from Queens, who laughs way too hard about science puns, and watches too many movies, and still plays with Legos, and gets bullied every day at school.\u201d\nThe lump in his throat was growing, and more and more tears were escaping his eyes, but the pressure on his chest was decreasing with every word he said. Those thoughts didn\u2019t just appear in Peter\u2019s head over night. They had been there ever since Tony invited him into his lab for the first time. Peter could understand the billionaire\u2019s interest in Spider-Man, after all he built him a suit and it was more or less public knowledge that Iron Man was mentoring Queen\u2019s vigilante. Of course, he had to make sure that Spider-Man wouldn\u2019t do anything that would harm his reputation.\nTony\u2019s interest in Peter Parker, though? That had been very suspicious for him. Still, he\u2019d answered all his questions, too polite and too starstruck to ask why he wanted to know what they were doing at school or what colleges he was interested in. For weeks, Peter waited for the other shoe to drop. Something, anything, to explain all the questions. After their fourth movie night \u2013 the second time Tony had fallen asleep on the couch and the first time Peter had dared to rest his head on his shoulder and nothing bad had happened \u2013, he started to entertain the idea that Tony maybe, maybe, enjoyed his company. That he liked spending time with him, even though Peter got too excited, and was always talking, and they were discussing the stupidest movie theories, and building silly things just for the fun of it.\nThat thought had filled Peter with a giddy, excited feeling for a week.\nAnd then the other shoe dropped. In form of a paternity test.\nTony started spending more time with him because he was his son. Not because he wanted to, but because he felt obliged to do it. Because he felt guilty and he had to. And, yeah, maybe Tony got used to him. Maybe he just accepted that his son wouldn\u2019t be as cool as himself. Because, seriously, how could anybody be as cool as Tony Stark? That was an impossible bar to pass.\n\u201cBut me being his son?\u201d Peter shook his head slightly. \u201cNow it makes sense why he wastes his time one me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wasting his time on you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he is! He\u2019d canceled at least three very important meetings because of me. He spends so much time just fooling around with me instead of inventing new tech for his company. Why else would he do that for some random kid?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if that was true \u2013 which I don\u2019t think it is \u2013 the timing is all off. You\u2019ve been hanging out for months now, and he just found out that he\u2019s your father.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he says that he just found out.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe him?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not really. I mean, he\u2019s Tony Stark, tech genius of the millennia who has access to the best labs and technology in the world, and he didn\u2019t do a DNA test before he recruited me?\u201d Peter shook his head as if to support his words. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it. He has to lie.\u201d\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t think Tony Stark is even able to lie or keep a secret. I mean, he told the world he\u2019s Iron Man after, like, a week.\u201d\n\u201cIt was longer than a week.\u201d Ned had a point, though. Mr. Stark was terrible at keeping secrets. Which begs the question why he told him now, on a seemingly random Friday? Why not when they first met? Or after Germany? After the ferry? When he offered him a spot at the Avengers? Did something happen at Stark Industries? Something that forced Tony to reveal this secret? Maybe he needed to secure an heir or something?\nThe thought that Tony only told him because he needed him to take over SI someday left a bad taste in his mouth \u2013 not unlike the taste of vomit.\nFor a moment, neither of them said anything. Peter was still hoping the numb feeling would return soon and banish all the tears from his eyes. Ned slipped from his bed to sit next to him on the ground. \u00a0He bumped into his shoulder. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re not a loser,\u201d he said with some kind of solemn honesty. \u201cYou\u2019re like the smartest person that I know, and you\u2019re a superhero.\u201d\n\u201cSpider-Man is a superhero,\u201d Peter corrected, not looking up from his sleeves.\n\u201cPeter Parker and Spider-Man are the same person. Dude, seriously. This isn\u2019t a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hy \u2013 \u2026 not wait, I got a better one. This isn\u2019t a Bruce Banner and the Hulk situation.\u201d Ned was beaming, proud of his joke, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but let the corners of his mouth twitch upwards. \u201cYou are Spider-Man, just without the mask. And if Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re cool \u2013 which I do not think he does \u2013 then \u2026 he\u2019s the uncool one.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Stark can\u2019t not be cool. Iron Man is your favorite superhero.\u201d\n\u201cMy favorite superhero is Spider-Man. Iron Man may be my favorite Avenger, but that solely based on the fact that he thinks Peter Parker is cool.\u201d Peter peered at Ned who was looking back with a firm look on his face. Ned was a huge Iron Man fan, maybe not as obsessed as Peter, but big enough to still have three Iron Man posters in his room. For him to say something like that wasn\u2019t just nothing.\nPeter smiled a little. \u201cThanks, Ned.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Ned gave him a proud nod, before eyeing him again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d For a heartbeat, Peter thought about just shrugging everything off. Just saying that everything was okay.\nBut nothing was okay. And he needed to talk about it. In this moment, Ned seemed like the only one who would understand him.\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m cursed?\u201d he asked, almost inaudible, choking on the few words, and he just couldn\u2019t stop the tears anymore. In an instant, Ned\u2019s arm was around his shoulder, pulling him into a somewhat awkward half-hug.\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re not cursed! There is no such thing as curses.\u201d\n\u201cYou yourself said that my life is like a movie. And it\u2019s a tragedy in which the protagonist is cursed.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, first of all, your life isn\u2019t a tragedy, it\u2019s an action movie, alright? Maybe a comedy, because we\u2019re hilarious. Or a sci-fi, because you literally have your own AI! But definitely not a tragedy. And, secondly, you need a witch or a wizard for a curse, and there aren\u2019t any of them.\u201d\n\u201cDude, Scarlet Witch?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, yeah, but she only does like mind stuff, right? And letting things float and flying around? No curses.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if there\u2019re other witches or wizards out there and we just don\u2019t know about them? I mean, New York was invaded by aliens and we get visits from actual gods. There could someone with magic out there.\u201d\n\u201cDude.\u201d Ned\u2019s eyes sparkled, a big grin on his face, and his excitement was almost enough to pull Peter out of his misery. Almost. Oh, how he wished that he could just forget about his misery and discuss magic with Ned instead. \u201cWhat if there is, like, a secret coven somewhere in New York? Or \u2026 or like wizard-monks?\u201d\n\u201cSee? There could be someone who cursed me!\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s someone with magic, but they wouldn\u2019t curse you! I\u2019m sure they\u2019re busy protecting our dimension or time or something.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026\u201d And there were the tears again, mixed with a fear that gripped his heart and just wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cDad, I mean, Richard, and Uncle Ben \u2026 they were both like my fathers. And they both died. Mom died, too. What \u2013 What if Mr. Stark dies because of me?\u201d There was absolutely no stopping the tears now, and he didn\u2019t even have the strength to try. His shoulders were shaking uncontrollably, even though Ned had pulled him in another too tight hug.\nThat hug was the only thing that was keeping Peter together right now.\nIt took him a while to calm down. He wasn\u2019t sure how long \u2013 it felt like a few seconds, but it had to be longer. He had never voiced that particular fear, never even uttered them under his breath. Because he was too afraid to make them true by putting them out there in the world. He couldn\u2019t lose another parent. Not May nor Tony. He was absolutely terrified of it.\n\u201cListen to me, okay?\u201d Ned said as soon as Peter could hear anything besides his own sobs and ragged breath. \u201cYou\u2019re not cursed. Their deaths are not your fault.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo but. They\u2019re not dead because of you. And Mr. Stark won\u2019t die because of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cDude, he\u2019s Iron Man. Even if there was a curse, which there\u2019s not, something like that wouldn\u2019t kill him. After all, he\u2019s Iron Man.\u201d\n\u201cI just \u2026 can\u2019t loose him, Ned. Not him, too.\u201d Peter honestly thought he wouldn\u2019t recover from losing Tony. Losing his dad \u2013 Richard \u2013 had been weird. He had been too young to really understand it. Losing Uncle Ben had been crushing and devastating, and it still hurt so much just thinking about him. Losing Tony \u2026 Peter couldn\u2019t even imagine it.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t. Okay? He\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019s a superhero and a genius. If anyone can break a curse, it\u2019s him. But you have to tell him about it, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can ever talk to him again, to be honest.\u201d He thought back to their conversation in the lab. The pained look on Tony\u2019s face as he told him everything. The struggle to form the words. Not being able to really look him in the eyes. Peter\u2019s heart ached. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he wants to talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he does! You\u2019re his favorite intern.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m his only intern.\u201d\n\u201cSee?\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t convinced and Ned must\u2019ve seen it. He gave his shoulder a squeeze. \u201cJust \u2026 give it some time. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Maybe just \u2026 sleep a couple of time over it? And if you still think this is wrong, then \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I help you make a new suit? Quit school to be your full-time guy in the chair?\u201d\nDespite everything, Peter snorted. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Ned was his best friend. Loyal to a fault, and always able to cheer him up. \u201cThanks, Ned.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Hey, anyway, did I tell you about this new video game I got? It\u2019s so awesome, like \u2013\u201c The rest of the afternoon was spend talking about games, movies, rebuilding the Lego Death Star, and discussing the probability of time travel. Not once was the subject of Tony Stark being Peter\u2019s father brought up again, but it still lingered in the back of his mind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony was almost never angry at Pepper. Sometimes irritated, but never mad or angry. It was like there was something in his bones that physically forced him to find everything the woman did absolutely enchanting, even if he didn\u2019t like it.\nUntil now.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cTony \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo, absolutely not. The biggest no there ever was in the history of no.\u201d\n\u201cListen, you have to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI have to stay here!\u201d He whirled around, finally facing Pepper, who looked a bit startled. \u201cAnd I will stay here. That\u2019s the end of it.\u201d\n\u201cYour presence is required.\u201d\n\u201cWell, too bad. I\u2019m not going. And, honestly? I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even talking about this right now. You know what today is.\u201d\nTwo weeks. It has been two weeks since Tony told Peter about their shared DNA, but it\u2019d felt like months. The hangover he nursed from that disastrous night lasted two days, though he was a little proud to admit that he didn\u2019t reach for the bottle again. Instead, he\u2019d holed himself up in his workshop, and didn\u2019t leave it for four days. Who needs showers and a proper bed anyway? May, that heaven send saint, had sent him daily updates on Peter. He\u2019d been really quiet which was the most un-Peter-like behavior ever. That had changed after Peter and May had a little heart-to-heart. Tony didn\u2019t know any specifics, but May\u2019d said that Peter got better afterwards. He\u2019d to take her word for it because there was still no contact between them.\nHis patrol reports were short. Actually short. No off-topic rambling, no explanations, no details. Just a short list of what happened that day. Even Happy, who was going on and on about the kid\u2019s reports being way too long, wasn\u2019t happy about the short version. More than once \u2013 or four times \u2013 Tony had to stop himself from ordering FRIDAY to override Karen\u2019s system to talk to Peter while he was out Spider-Manning. Sometimes, he\u2019d even hoped that something big would happen, so he\u2019d an excuse to suit up and fly out there. But, of course, nothing happened.\nIt wasn\u2019t until a few days ago that something changed. May had told him that Peter was hesitant to talk to him, because he wasn\u2019t sure if Tony wanted to see him. Obviously that thought was absolutely abstruse for Tony, because why wouldn\u2019t he want to see Peter? He could understand it if it were the other way around, but this? This was something the genius couldn\u2019t wrap his head around. He told May very clearly and a lot of times that he absolutely wanted to see Peter, but she insisted that he had to make the first move. Which was the adult thing to do. So, naturally, Tony didn\u2019t want to do it. But he wanted to be better. Wanted to be better for Peter.\nIt took him four and a half hours, sixty-four message outlines, and a whole lot of nerves to finally sent five texts to Peter. In true Gen Z fashion, Peter\u2019s reply came only a minute later. A single text with only one emoji that\u2019d filled Tony with new hope for a second chance. He could fix this. Peter was giving him a second chance and he could fix this.\nAnd then this happened. Corruption rumors about one of the more important board members of SI reached their ears, luckily before they could get to the newspapers. An emergency meeting has been scheduled \u2013 for today. The day that Peter would arrive at the compound to spend the entire weekend there. And Tony had to go. Because, apparently, as owner of the company his presence was absolutely necessary. Which led to Pepper and him arguing, not even 30 minutes before Peter was suppose to arrive. They should\u2019ve left fifteen minutes ago, and Tony could see that Pepper was getting itchy because of the delay. She liked to stick to plans. Tony honestly didn\u2019t know how, after knowing him for so many years, she still thought he would stick to any time table.\n\u201cI know what today is,\u201d she said calmly, but he could hear that her patience was running thin, \u201cbut this is important.\u201d\n\u201cPeter is more important.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I get that, -\u201c\n\u201cThen why are we doing this?\u201d Tony gestured between them, his face pulled in a grimace. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I\u2019m staying here. You don\u2019t need me at that meeting. I wouldn\u2019t do anything productive anyway. We both know that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still your company, Tony. You have to show up.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have it. Right here, right now. Majority share holder Pepper Potts, how does that sound?\u201d Pepper sighed, rubbing her forehead in frustration, but Tony wouldn\u2019t budge on this.\n\u201cPeter will understand,\u201d Rhodey piped up from the couch. Rhodey, who came over to the compound for moral support and was now, apparently, a back stabbing traitor. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart kid. He knows that plans can change and he will understand.\u201d\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have to understand. He should know that he\u2019s my priority.\u201d Tony knew Peter well enough to know what\u2019ll happen. Peter would be disappointed, even if he didn\u2019t show it, and think he was a burden or something along those lines. And Tony just couldn\u2019t let that happen.\n\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper said softly, taking his hands in hers, running her thumb over the back of his hand, and a gentle look in her eyes. Tony just narrowed his eyes. He knew this voice, knew her expression, knew what she was doing. She always did this when he was being especially stubborn. Unfortunately for him, it was a great tactic and had a very high success rate. \u201cNobody here thinks that Peter isn\u2019t your priority. We know how important this is to you, and we want to help you. But this meeting is important, too, and very time sensitive. We need to act fast, and the faster we act, the faster you can get back here to spend time with Peter.\u201d\nHe could literally feel his resolve crumble. \u201cHe will think I\u2019m going because I don\u2019t wanna see him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he knows that that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Rhodey said, walking over to them, crossing his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll even show them the footage of your little tantrum if he doesn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\nA part of Tony knew that he lost. Damn Pepper and Rhodey and their ability to make him do things he didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cCan\u2019t we leave after he gets here? So I can at least explain the situation to him?\u201d\n\u201cWe both know that you won\u2019t leave once he\u2019s here,\u201d Pepper said with a small smile on her face. \u201cTony, I promise that you can leave as soon as possible, okay? But we need to leave now if we want to wrap this up today.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t behave,\u201d Tony announced, because it felt like the only thing he could do. \u201cI won\u2019t play nice. And I won\u2019t even pretend that I want to be there.\u201d\n\u201cI expect nothing less from you.\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any bathroom breaks. Nobody will step outside to smoke. If we have to eat something, we will do it in the conference room. No unnecessary delays.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m only doing this today. As soon as the clock strikes midnight, this company owner will turn back into a self-absorbed person who only does what he wants. Which is fixing things with his kid. Oh, and I\u2019m taking a suit so I can literally fly out of there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf the Tower was like a second home to Peter, the compound was a vacation home. It still felt like home, he had his own bedroom and a closet full of clothes, but it was still something special to go there. The Tower was closer and had everything they needed \u2013 the lab, bedrooms, a TV, a big couch and a dishwasher because they were lazy. Whenever he went Upstate, he spent the whole weekend there, alternating between working in the lab, training in the gym and relaxing in the spacious living area.\nSpending the weekend in the compound after not talking to Tony for two weeks, had seemed like a risky move to Peter. May had encouraged him to go, had reassured him that he could leave whenever he wanted should he feel uncomfortable, and that he was welcome there. Despite her words, the burning worry that Tony didn\u2019t actually want to see him was still there. A part of him wanted to ask his mentor \u2013 his father \u2013 if it was okay to come, but he didn\u2019t want to seem clingy or needy. That could drive him away, right? After all, Tony hadn\u2019t been too responsive to Peter\u2019s over eager willingness to talk and share in the beginning. What if it\u2019ll go back to those days? Just an empty suit with a WiFi-connection? \u00a0\nBut then Tony had reached out to him.\n\u00a0\nTony Stark: Hey buddy, it\u2019s a compound weekend. Is that still on? \nTony Stark: You can say no, of course. If you don\u2019t want to. Or if you have other plans already. No pressure. \nTony Stark: But I would really like it if you\u2019d come.\nTony Stark: And I hope we can talk about everything. If you want to. If not, that\u2019s okay, too. We can just tinker around in the lab. That\u2019s cool, too. Tinkering around with Tony Stark is still cool for you nerds, right?\nTony Stark: I also already forgot what happens in Star Wars because no one makes me watch it for the millionth time. So that has to change as well. \n\u00a0\nNot going to lie, Peter had almost cried as he read them. Pushing his internal happy dance away and letting go a relieved breath, he sent a quick affirmation with just one smiling emoji, because he didn\u2019t want to seem too overbearing. Small steps. Now he could barely contain his nervous energy. Happy picked him up from school \u2013 Ned had spent every second of the day giving him pep talks and, honestly? That boy could make a living out of it \u2013 and Peter spent the entire ride doing his homework. He didn\u2019t want to waste a second of his time with Tony on something trivial like homework.\nAs Happy pulled into the drive way and the massive complex got bigger and bigger, Peter\u2019s nervousness turned into a positive, giddy feeling. This would be okay. They would fix this awkwardness. Tony wanted him here, he wanted to spend time with him. Like a mantra, he repeated these thoughts over and over, and the second the car stopped, he opened his door, grabbing his backpack. \u201cThanks for driving me, Happy!\u201d\n\u201cKid, wait \u2013\u201c Happy said, eyes glued to his phone, but it was too late. Peter\u2019d already slammed the door shut, skipping along the graveled path. Tony would be inside, maybe waiting in his lab or watching TV or even cooking in the kitchen, which he did only on very rare occasions, but Peter had caught him from time to time.\n\u201cHi FRIDAY,\u201d Peter greeted the AI as soon as he stepped through the threshold.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Parker,\u201d FRIDAY answered.\n\u201cCould you tell me where Mr. Stark is?\u201d He could do this. They would have a proper talk, Peter wouldn\u2019t just run away like he did a fortnight ago, and then everything would be fine. No need to worry. Tony specifically asked him to come here. Everything was fine.\n\u201cI am sorry to inform you that Boss is currently not on the premises.\u201d\n\u00a0Once on patrol, Peter had slammed into a building, while swinging full speed. It\u2019d knocked all the air out of his lungs, made him see stars and loose every bit of orientation. He\u2019d had a headache for days, every bone and muscle in his back aching, despite his healing factor. This felt a lot like that. Breathing was impossible. Something cold gripped his stomach and clawed its way up to his chest.\nTony wasn\u2019t here. He asked Peter to come, to spend the weekend here, with him, and now he wasn\u2019t here. Was this a joke? Did FRIDAY pull a joke on him? Could AIs even do something like that? Or had Tony\u2019s text been a joke? Did someone hack him? Well, he had some of the best fire walls and security in the entire world, but Ned had been able to hack the suit. That meant someone could hack his phone and sent the texts to Peter.\n\u201cThere is an emergency meeting,\u201d a voice said. Peter actually flinched a little, too distracted by his own depressing thought to have noticed Rhodey approaching him. A small, sympathetic smile was on his face. \u201cThe board of directors. Tony\u2019s presence is necessary. He really didn\u2019t want to leave. He and Pepper argued quite a while about it.\u201d\n\u201cThey fought because of me?\u201d Peter\u2019s stomach dropped. Well, that\u2019s it. He already blew it. Screw the pooch. Mr. Stark and Miss Potts fought. Because of him. Surely, he didn\u2019t want to see him anymore. Who wants the reason you fight with your fianc\u00e9 near you?\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a fight, more like an argument.\u201d The Colonel stood next to him and put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it gently. \u201cListen, Tony really didn\u2019t want to go, okay? He was ready to give Stark Industries over to Pepper, just so he could stay here. And he\u2019s coming back as soon as he can. Actually, he took his suit, so he can fly back the second it turns midnight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy midnight?\u201d\n\u201cSaid he\u2019s only doing it for today, not a second longer.\u201d\nThere was a weird mix of disappointment and hope in Peter\u2019s chest. Like his feelings just couldn\u2019t decide what they wanted. Of course, he was kind of gutted that Tony wasn\u2019t here, but it was still his company. And if there was a serious problem, he had to be there to fix it. After all, he was the best at fixing things. Besides, Rhodey said that he didn\u2019t really want to go. That he would rather spend his time with Peter.\nHis shoulder got another squeeze, prompting to look up again. \u201cI can show you the footage of his temper tantrum, if you want. It\u2019s actually quite funny, isn\u2019t it, FRIDAY?\u201d\n\u201cIt is very amusing indeed,\u201d FRIDAY contributed and if a computer could sound mischievous, she did.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Peter said, sounding much more optimistic than he actually felt. \u201cThings come up. I understand. It\u2019s important.\u201d\nRhodey gave him a weird look, eyebrows pulled together as if he was trying to solve some especially difficult puzzle. Eventually, he said: \u201cHe knew you would say that. That\u2019s why he wanted to stay. To make sure you don\u2019t misinterpret this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I get it, really, it\u2019s an important meeting and I\u2019m \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re very important to him. He really wants to clear the situation between you two.\u201d\nFor a second, Peter could just stare. \u201cYou\u2026 uh \u2026 know about the \u2026 uhm \u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo I know that you\u2019re his son?\u201d Peter nodded, lump in his throat. \u201cYes, he told me.\u201d Of course Rhodey knew. He was Tony\u2019s best friend and, after all, Peter had told his best friend as well. Rhodey cocked his head to the side, his mouth pulled into a small smile, his eyes full of warmth. \u201cYou want my thoughts on that?\u201d\nNo, was Peter\u2019s first reaction, because he was so afraid that the man would disapprove. That he would tell him he wasn\u2019t smart enough, cool enough, brave enough, good enough for Tony. But the teenager swallowed that fear together with the lump that was stuck stubbornly in his throat. \u201cIf-If you want to, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is just some kind of formality. You\u2019ve already been father and son for months now, if you noticed it or not. Actually being related is just a bonus. A validation, if you will.\u201d Listening to his words \u2013 War Machine\u2019s words, Tony Stark\u2019s best friend\u2019s words \u2013 Peter could feel his cheeks heating up. He hadn\u2019t known that someone was watching them this closely to make a statement like that. Well, maybe FRIDAY, but she was always watching.\n\u201cThank you, Colonel Rhodes,\u201d Peter eventually said, because what else was there to say?\n\u201cHey, I think it\u2019s about time you call me Rhodey, don\u2019t you think? After all, I\u2019m your honorary uncle now.\u201d It cracked a smile out of Peter, even though it felt more like moving muscles than an actual smile. \u201cSo, you got any homework to do?\u201d\n\u201cNo, everything\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect. How about we head down to the gym? You can show me how those punches I taught you come along, and I could use a bit of exercise.\u201d Never one to say no to a training session with Rhodey \u2013 it was War Machine! \u2013 he nodded eagerly. Maybe a bit of distraction and physical exhaustion would help him relax. He went to drop his back off in his room, before heading down to the gym. On the way there, Peter checked his phone, more out of habit than anything else. His heart jumped when he saw that he got a couple of texts from Tony.\n\u00a0\nTony Stark: I\u2019m so sorry. I really didn\u2019t want to leave, but, apparently, it\u2019s the adult and responsible thing to do. Don\u2019t grow up, it\u2019s not fun. \nTony Stark: I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. I promise.\nTony Stark: Just wait until I\u2019m back.\nTony Stark: Please.\nTony Stark: Pepper is about to take my phone, claiming I\u2019m not paying attention. Preposterous. \n\u00a0\nThis time, his smile actually felt like a real smile, and he typed a quick response, feeling relieved how easy it was to fall back into their usual kind of banter.\n\u00a0\nPeter Parker: I\u2019ll wait. Also, if I have to pay attention in calculus, you have to pay attention in important meetings.\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the day had a strange feel of ease to it. Like Peter was let off the hook for something he had to do. Which was actually true. He spent what was left of the afternoon with Rhodey in the gym, working on his punches, and learning how to not get punched in the face. That was very helpful for his nightly patrols. He was getting tired of his bloody noses. After a well-deserved shower, they made a ridiculous amount of lasagna, of which Peter had three servings because he was a growing boy with a super metabolism, and settled down to watch Back to the Future. Peter had been absolutely delighted when he found out that War Machine was a movie fan, especially all movies that were somehow involved with time travel.\nHowever, with every minute that passed, with every moment that moved them closer to midnight, Peter got more and more nervous. All his positivity melted away. How could he just come here and expect everything to be okay after a quick talk? Just because everything was okay when they texted, didn\u2019t mean it would be okay when they talked face to face? Texting was like wearing a mask. Also, who said that whatever Tony wanted to talk to him about was good? He\u2019d never said that. He just said he wanted to talk. Maybe he decided that it would be better if they would stop seeing each other, because Peter was obviously not got enough to be Tony\u2019s son.\nPeter couldn\u2019t stay up. His plan had been to wait for Tony, but that seemed impossible right now. He couldn\u2019t face him. He needed more time. Time to think about what he wanted, what he would do if Tony rejected him. So, with a pounding heart and a not-really-great excuse, Peter jumped off the couch as the second movie was about to start and went off to his room. Rhodey said something, but he wasn\u2019t listening anymore. The need to get away, to hide until everything was over, was too overwhelming.\nOnly he didn\u2019t find any peace in his bedroom either. His brain just wouldn\u2019t shut up. Was that the curse of smart people? To not be able to shut their brain off for just a second? In his need for a break, Peter initiated the Lullaby Protocol; a protocol that would self-activate if he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep after ninety minutes. It played some scientifically chosen songs with soundwaves that would one to relax. Peter had laughed the first time he heard about it, but it had never failed him to fall asleep.\nBut, of course, it wasn\u2019t a restful sleep. Because that would have been too much to ask, right?\nThe dream started out like most of his dreams. It was a normal setting, this particular one started out in the lab. Tony was with him, dressed casual in faded jeans and an old AC/DC shirt, rock music playing softly in the background while they both worked on their individual projects. Peter was chatting away about his day, told him every little detail, and Tony would make a witty comment from time to time. It was normal, it was comforting, it was what Peter wanted.\nAnd then everything changed. The music abruptly stopped, causing him to halt and look up. Tony wasn\u2019t sitting at his workbench anymore. Instead, he was standing, suddenly in a fancy suit, his back turned to him, and walking towards the doors. Peter called out for him \u2013 or wanted to call out, but no sound left his mouth, no matter how much he tried. A feeling familiar to his spidey sense gripped him, and he jumped out of his chair, ready to chase after Tony. But he couldn\u2019t get any closer. He ran and ran and ran, but Tony was just getting further away. Peter longed for his web slingers, to swing after him, but his wrists were bare.\nA shot rang through the air. They weren\u2019t in the lab anymore. They were in a dark alley, rain pouring down on them. At Peter\u2019s feet lay Tony, face pale, eyes wide open and dull. There was a dark red spot on his white dress shirt that grew bigger by the second. Peter fell to his knees, pressed his hands against the spot, but the blood kept flowing. He knew he was wailing, sobbing, and crying, but again, no sound actually came out. Or maybe he just didn\u2019t hear them over the rain that kept crashing down on them. Peter barely registered the rising water, too focused on Tony\u2019s lifeless face and empty eyes, and then, suddenly, he wasn\u2019t in the alley, but underwater. Something was pulling him down, deep, deep into the darkness, and he just couldn\u2019t fight it. He tried, he really tried, but no matter what he did, the mysterious force kept him down. His lungs burned, screamed at him to give them some air, but he couldn\u2019t, there was no air here, he would drown, he would drown and nobody would ever know and \u2013\n\u201cPeter!\u201d\nAt once, his eyes flew open, his lungs finally drew in air, and hot tears rolled down his cheek. It took him a heartbeat to realize that he wasn\u2019t underwater. He wasn\u2019t drowning. He wasn\u2019t in an ally or the lab either, instead in his spacious and very comfortable bed at the compound. There was a hand on his shoulder, another one running through his hair.\n\u201cEasy, okay, just breath. In and out.\u201d He drew some ragged breath, his hands instinctively clutching the arms next to him. They grounded him, and the hand in his hair seemed to brush all the panic from his nightmare away. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019re doing great, buddy.\u201d\nFinally, when Peter could breath without any hiccups, he looked to his right, to the person attached to the hands and arms. \u201cMr. Stark?\u201d he asked, still a little short of breath. The man to his right, sitting on the edge of his bed, nodded. In the sparely light, Peter could make out his worried expression. He was still in a business suit, though his jacket lay near the door.\nTony smiled a little. \u201cThe one and only,\u201d he joked, before turning serious again. \u201cYou good?\u201d\n\u201cY-Yeah, I think\u201d, he said. However, he couldn\u2019t help but let his eyes flicker down to Tony\u2019s chest. His shirt wasn\u2019t stained in red, there was no blood running out of a bullet hole.\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d His voice was soft, comforting, and his hand fell out of his hair. It quickly swiped over his cheek, brushing the tears away. Peter just shook his head. \u201cSometimes it helps to talk about it. Which, I know, is incredibly hypocritical coming from me, but just use me as a bad example, alright?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d Peter said, because it truly didn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d The words had slipped out before he could even realize it. \u00a0Had he said too much? Could Tony actually figure out what his dream had been about with just these few words?\nIf he did figure it out, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead, he smirked. \u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? That I would come back as quick as I can?\u201d\n\u201cHow was the meeting?\u201d It\u2019s not like he was really interested in the meeting, but he just needed to forget the sight of Tony dying in front of him before he could think about anything else.\n\u201cBoring. Unbelievable boring. They were all talking, claiming they knew best, knew what to do, and every single one of them was so incredibly indecisive. I was this close to just fire them all.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Tony Stark. I can do anything.\u201d Peter snorted, and the corners of Tony\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cAnyway, you should try to go back to sleep. It\u2019s late. Or early. Enough time to rest until the sun comes up.\u201d\nAnd there was Peter\u2019s nervousness again. He recognized what Tony did. He was giving him a way out. A way to not talk about it, to push it back for a couple of hours. A few hours ago, Peter would\u2019ve taken that offer. But that was before his nightmare. Before seeing his father bleed out on the street.\nPeter licked his lips, and ignored his racing heart in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m \u2026 not really tired anymore.\u201d\nNormally, Tony would say something along the lines that kids had to sleep and that May was going to have his head if she found out. However, he stayed silenced now and just hold his gaze for a second. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. Peter nodded. \u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s fine. What\u2019d you wanna do? Watch a movie? Or some TV?\u201d\n\u201cCan \u2013\u201c He paused, and swallowed his insecurities. He could do this. He was Spider-Man. He shouldn\u2019t be afraid of this. He could be brave. \u201cCan we talk? About \u2013 About \u2026 us?\u201d The change was instantaneous. Tony\u2019s face went completely blank, and he didn\u2019t move. Suddenly, Peter was very aware of the bags under his eyes, his rumpled clothes, and the fact that he\u2019d spent the better half of the day arguing with his colleagues \u2013 if you could call them that. At once, he felt absolutely terrible. \u201cBut you\u2019re probably tired. I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t think about it. You should go to bed, I\u2019m fine, honestly. I\u2019ll just go back to sleep or read a book or watch a movie or \u2013\u201c\n\u201cPete,\u201d Tony interrupted him, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to talk to you for two weeks. I\u2019m not tired.\u201d\n\u201cYou look tired, though,\u201d he commented.\n\u201cThe perks of getting old, nothing else.\u201d That got another snort out of Peter, which was kind of unbelievable for the both of them.\nA pregnant silence stretched between them. Nobody really knew how to start this. Peter had this strange feeling that he should start, because Tony started the last one. So, he did start. In the most Peter Parker-way there was. By apologizing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cPete, no, don\u2019t. You have nothing to apologize for.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do. I just \u2026 left. You wanted to talk about it, and I just left like the immature child that I am and \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel bad about leaving, okay? It wasn\u2019t an easy conversation and you probably needed some time to think about it \u2013\u201c\n\u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t have left!\u201d\nTony just continued as if he hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cAnd I was doing a terrible job, anyway. Seriously, I had a way better plan, a Pepper-approved plan, that\u2019s the best kind of plan there is, and I just didn\u2019t use it. So, it\u2019s mostly on me that you ran away. Should\u2019ve reached out to you sooner as well, but I was just \u2026 too damn much of a coward.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a coward, you\u2019re Iron Man,\u201d Peter said almost automatically. A sad smile appeared on Tony\u2019s face.\n\u201cWell, the truth is I\u2019m arguably more of a mess than I am Iron Man. And I can totally understand if the thought of being my son is embarrassing or disappointing \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo!\u201d Before Peter knew what he was doing, he was sitting up, causing Tony to flinch in surprise. His hand, however, stayed on his shoulder. With new determination, he looked at his mentor \u2013 his father \u2013 and hold his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed or disappointed. You\u2019re not a mess.\u201d Tony raised a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cWell, maybe a little bit, but everyone is allowed to be a mess, even genius billionaires who are also superheroes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll never understand your faith in me, kid,\u201d he said, and Peter wasn\u2019t really sure if he was even suppose to hear those words.\nRight now, it was important that he understood what Peter was feeling. \u201cThe reason I ran,\u201d he explained, drawing a deep breath, and looking anywhere but at Tony, \u201cwas because I \u2026 well, I thought that that was reason why you were keeping me around. Because I\u2019m your s-son, and you needed me for some SI thing or something. Not because you liked me for who I am.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it when I first met you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you said, but I guess my brain just \u2013\u201c Peter shrugged once. \u201cJust thought it wasn\u2019t true? Because you literally have the best labs on this side of the world and you didn\u2019t do a DNA test? I don\u2019t know, it sounded like a lie or an excuse or something.\u201d\n\u201cI did run a DNA test when I got your blood, but I never even thought about running it against my own DNA. I haven\u2019t lied to you, Pete. I really did just find out when Happy came to talk to me. And the reason I started to hang out with you? Because you\u2019re simply one of the most amazing persons I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean it.\u201d Tony put his hand on his cheek and turned his head around, so he had to look at him. \u201cYou are, Peter. You\u2019re so incredible that I\u2019m constantly in awe of what you do. You\u2019re so, so smart, and you\u2019re good and kind-hearted and brave and selfless and so \u2026 everything that I\u2019m not. Everything that I\u2019m trying to be, but the difference is that I am failing.\u201d His eyes held some kind of magnetic power, making it impossible for Peter to look away. For a moment, Tony searched his face, but Peter couldn\u2019t tell if he found what he was looking for.\n\u201cI was terrified when the tests kept coming back positive,\u201d Tony confessed, the hand on his face now gentle, and there was so much raw emotion in his eyes, that Peter could actually feel his pain. \u201cBecause in my head, I was never cut out to be a father. Howard, my dad, hadn\u2019t really been the best example, and I\u2019m not a good role model. Besides all the partying and the alcoholism, I built weapons for most of my life. Blissfully believing that I was making the world a safer place. They called me the Merchant of Death for a reason. How could I be a father like that? How could I be a father to someone like you, when all my hands to is destroy?\u201d Even in the low light, Peter could see tears forming in Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was absolutely petrified because of that thought. So, I wanted to push it away. To just ignore it, hoping that the problem would just disappear into thin air. But this wasn\u2019t \u2013 isn\u2019t just about me. It\u2019s about you, too. And you deserve a father. A good father. I know I\u2019m far from perfect, and that I\u2019m not Richard or Ben, and that I\u2019m about sixteen years too late, but \u2026 Peter, I promise I\u2019ll do anything I can to make up for this. Because the thought of having you not in my life is way more horrific than the thought of being a father.\u201d\nAt some point \u2013 maybe around the time Tony had mentioned his father \u2013 Peter\u2019s eyes had started to well up again. How could he have doubted him? Tony was a good man, despite of what he thought of himself. How could he have thought that he was just using him? That he was lying to him? Had his own worry and self-doubt warped his mind so much that he had completely forgotten that?\nThe memory of his dream was still fresh on his mind. But instead of scaring him, it drove him forward. \u201cI was afraid, too,\u201d Peter admitted, his voice breaking and he was pretty sure that, based on his blurry vision, he was crying again, \u201cand I still am.\u201d Tony lifted his hand to wipe his face again, but he caught his hand, forcing him to still and listen to him. \u201cBecause all my parents died. And I can\u2019t lose you, too.\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d understood his last words, because he was openly sobbing now.\nAnd then, suddenly, he was in a tight embrace. Like his life depended on it, he clung to Tony\u2019s shoulders while he cried. Tony\u2019s arms around him were so tight, had Peter been anyone else, he might have had trouble breathing. He could feel something wet against his face, and he was somewhat sure that that weren\u2019t his tears. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he whispered in his ear, over and over again. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose me, I promise. I\u2019m Iron Man, remember? I\u2019m not that easy to kill.\u201d\n\u201cI dreamt about it,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI dreamt you died.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. It was just a dream, you hear me? Many people have tried to kill me, and they all failed.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013\u201c\n\u201cNo buts. The only way I die is when I\u2019m hundred and fifty, and you\u2019re begging me to finally kick the bucket, so you can have your inheritance.\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t help but giggle, even though tears were still running down his face. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re laughing now, but just wait. It\u2019s still a good hundred and something years before that happens. And guess who\u2019s to take care of this old man.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure DUM-E and U will be happy to help.\u201d\n\u201cOh, they will help alright. They will probably kill me while trying to help.\u201d This time, Peter\u2019s laugh actually sounded more like a laugh than weird wheezing. Tony\u2019s hand on his back ran up and down his back, soothing his tears and worries away. \u201cSo \u2026 we\u2019re good? No more running away and not talking to each other?\u201d\n\u201cNot from my side. We\u2019re good.\u201d Peter thought about pulling away from the embrace. But he didn\u2019t really want to. He felt save in Tony\u2019s arm. In his father\u2019s arms. Besides, his grip was so tight, Peter wasn\u2019t even sure if he could get out without hurting him.\nTension left Tony\u2019s body, and even without his super hearing, Peter would\u2019ve been able to hear his father\u2019s heartbeat slowing. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he breathed, and sounded more relieved than he would probably like to admit, \u201cbecause I honestly thought I had to find someone else to watch Star Wars with.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you won\u2019t forget a single detail, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nTony groaned and dropped his forehead on his shoulder. His voice was a bit muffled when he said: \u201cKid, do me favor, okay? Now that we have officially established our father-son-relationship, stop calling me Mr. Stark. Please.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d And because he was so happy right now, and a little shit, he added: \u201cDr Stark.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re grounded,\u201d Tony deadpanned, and Peter just laughed. Because, for the first time since Tony\u2019s impromptu Star Wars reference, he truly believed that everything would be just fine."
