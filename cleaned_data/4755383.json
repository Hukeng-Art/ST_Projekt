    "text": "Stiles knew that if his plan didn\u2019t work Peter was going to blame himself. Maybe he\u2019d bluster to Lydia about how he told Stiles it was a suicidal and desperate attempt\u2014but he\u2019d be blaming himself with every bitter jibe he threw at Stiles\u2019s memory. Stiles slipped away from the rundown barn, slipping out from under Peter\u2019s arm. The fact that the werewolf didn\u2019t even stir proved how exhausted he was\u2014how they all were. Stiles couldn\u2019t look at Peter for too long\u2026 or else he\u2019d stay and keep running with what little they had left of the Pack\u2014and Stiles needed to fix it. \nHe took off his shoes, his socks silent against the grass as he made his way to a faraway clearing. His toes were frozen by the time he made it, his lips blue as Lydia glanced up from her preparations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time. We don\u2019t exactly have many opportunities to do this.\u201d Before Stiles could reply with the usual, I know, I know, Lydia threw a large canvas backpack at him. Stiles opened it to see a few ratty shirts, a pair of pants, and a fire extinguisher. He slipped his wallet inside, not really caring about the ripped ten-dollar bill, but more so for the old pictures inside. \u201cYou know, for a forbidden spell, it wasn\u2019t very hard to set up.\u201d\nStiles laughed, rough and hysteric like cracked ice. He slipped his arms through the backpack straps and took a deep breath as Lydia bit her lip, glancing up at the night sky as if she could see the aligned planets they had waited so long for. \nTheir breath fogged out in front of them, their eyes shining under the full moon.\n\u201cRemember\u2014if this doesn\u2019t work, let him know it wasn\u2019t his fault. I\u2019m doing this for everyone, Scott, Derek, Isaac, Allison my\u2014my Dad. Because if I can go back and make things normal\u2026 I\u2019m going to take that chance.\u201d \nToo many of them had died\u2026 and those who were left were more broken because of it. So when Peter hesitantly admitted to knowing about a spell that would send someone back in time\u2026 Stiles knew he had to do it. He was new to magic, his \u201cSpark\u201d had shown up a few months ago\u2026 and he was the only one who could do it. \nLydia hugged him tightly and if she cried, Stiles didn\u2019t say anything. She had to stay outside of the circle as Stiles drew the intricate symbols. She didn\u2019t remind him that there had never been a recorded success. Stiles exhaled slowly, and as soon as he lifted the stick from the dirt he could feel it. He gasped, it was such a strong pull of his magic\u2014magic he wasn\u2019t even aware of\u2014seeping into the dirt. \nLydia made a strangled sound and Stiles didn\u2019t want to know what he looked like, wide-eyed as hot blood dribbled out of his nose. He had a moment to feel fear\u2014that he\u2019d become another name in a long list of failures\u2014\nAnd that was when the sky opened up, like a flower, and suddenly Stiles could see the stars and the planets, the Cosmos, was staring back\u2014its gaze ancient, cold, and crushing. Stiles couldn\u2019t breathe; he couldn\u2019t look away from the universe impossibly laid out before him. He heard Lydia, she sounded years away\u2014and somewhere, sometime, Peter bellowed Stiles\u2019s name\u2014but it already seemed so long ago as the last of Stiles\u2019s magic left his body.\nAs the night sky swallowed him he felt movement under him, behind him\u2014a thousand eyes, mouths, and hands reaching for him, towards his arrogance\u2014\nStiles squeezed his eyes shut, closing off the overload of the impossible. \n\u201cPlease.\u201d Whatever was behind him rumbled like an approaching avalanche. Stiles thought his eardrums would rupture from such a deep sound. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d\nThere was a rush of air and Stiles stumbled forward and hissed, his eyes flying open when he fell headfirst against a car door. His socked toes curled against pebbles and when he opened his eyes he saw that he was pressed against his father\u2019s Sheriff cruiser. His throat was tight and he peered over the hood to see the station doors open, his father mid-sip of the sludge they called coffee. \nEverything was frozen, like actors waiting for the curtains to open. His heart thundered in his chest because everyone looked so young\u2014but it was Dad, there was no mistaking it. Lydia and him had gone over the perfect scenario\u2014that he\u2019d arrive with plenty of time to find Derek, stop Kate, and gracefully prepare. But when he glanced down at his watch he realized he was given no time, he couldn\u2019t be subtle; he had to act fast if he wanted to stop everything.\nThe deep rumble returned, making Stiles\u2019s legs shake. He felt like he was being mocked, he could practically hear whatever it was laughing at him, assuming he\u2019d fail. \n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Stiles unzipped his backpack, pulling out the fire extinguisher. \u201cFucking watch me, Rumbles.\u201d \nStiles stood and rammed the extinguisher as hard as he could into the cruiser\u2019s driver\u2019s window. Time began as Stiles brought down the extinguisher for a third and final time\u2014and he ripped the door open and yanked at the console, exposing the wires as his Dad dropped his coffee.\n\u201cHey, what the hell\u2014?\u201d\nStiles refused to look at him as the cruiser purred to life. He could see his Dad, out of the corner of Stiles\u2019s eyes, sprinting for the car, and Stiles slammed on the gas. He flipped on the lights and sirens, burning past the Pharmacy, his old high school, and\u2026 and Scott\u2019s house. \nHe swallowed, aware of the police cars wailing behind him, and he hoped his voice was steady as he grabbed at the walkie. \n::::\nTalia could still taste the yellow wolfsbane that had laced the wine\u2014and she roared, the flames already so hot\u2014so hot and oh God, they were all going to die here. Peter clawed at the barred windows but to no avail while Cora stared at the mountain ash\u2014the flames licking up the walls and ceiling. Naomi kept Cora close, shielding her with her body\u2014\n\u201cOh God, oh God.\u201d A\u2026 boy stumbled down the stairs, wide-eyed with dried blood crusted around his nose. \u201cJesus\u2014all right, I got you guys.\u201d He moved to the mountain ash, kicking it with his feet and Peter lunged at him; eyes bright blue\u2014and the boy threw up his hands. \u201cI come in peace, I swear, I just, you need to get out of here, let\u2019s go!\u201d\nPeter growled, helping a bewildered Naomi to her feet, turning to Talia\u2014but she was already moving to Cora\u2014sweet little Cora who was wheezing\u2014and the boy\u2019s voice cracked as shouted, some debris falling from the ceiling. \n\u201cMove!\u201d\nShe did. It hurt; her skin felt clammy and tight thanks to the wolfsbane in her system. The boy herded them to the stairs, pushing on their backs and following them up as more and more of the ceiling turned to cinders. The boy squeezed Talia\u2019s wrist. \n\u201cYou need to ease up on the wolfiness\u2014the police are outside, here to help\u2014but\u2014\u201d\nTalia turned, her face changing back into something more human. \n\u201cPeter.\u201d He snarled, teeth glistening against the fire. Talia and the boy didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cPeter.\u201d\nTrue to his Alpha\u2019s desire, Peter shifted back, the five of them cautiously making their way into the main corridor\u2014as the Sheriff, John Stilinski, was there, looking understandingly horrified. He reached to Cora, and Talia gladly handed her over. She was sure that in her present condition the Sheriff was stronger than her. His eyes flickered to the boy, but he nodded toward the door. \n\u201cCome on, paramedics are on their way\u2014\u201d\nPack went first, Talia last, and she turned, to look at the boy\u2014when the ceiling collapsed on top of him and the Sheriff made a broken noise in his throat, but the flames were too close. They ran, ran into the sweet chilled night air, the Sheriff clutching Cora tightly, and Peter falling to his knees once they were a safe distance away. Talia immediately turned back towards the house, ready to go back into the fire to the return the favor\u2014because though he had been a stranger, he\u2019d been there to save them. Peter\u2019s stopped her with a firm grip.\n\u201cStop. The Pack needs you more.\u201d \nTalia turned, red bleeding through her normally brown eyes. She hated how Peter was right, deep down she knew it, but it hurt that some boy\u2019s life had been lost, after he gave them his devoted concern. The fire was blinding, and the Sheriff turned away, his eyes shuttered.\n\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\nTalia swallowed and then heard the sound of breaking glass. Everyone turned to see the dining room window shatter, a lithe body falling out of it. Talia was on the move before anyone could stop her, hauling the boy back up, and she saw his hands and feet were bleeding from the glass. She threw his arm around her shoulders, letting him half-hobble half-hop to a safe distance.\n\u201cYou knew.\u201d \nIt wasn\u2019t a question. The boy coughed, his face dirtied with ash. \n\u201cYeah. Not an accomplice. I\u2019ll tell you everything, not here. Don\u2019t let me stay with the police.\u201d \nHis chest heaved, and he coughed, a dry wheeze. She felt his heartbeat slow, and she was able to take in the four police cars, lights still flashing, and parked in their driveway. She gently eased the boy next to Naomi, touching Naomi\u2019s blonde hair briefly before returning to the Sheriff. He kept glancing between the boy, the house, his officers, and the boy again. Cora slid from his arms, running into her Uncle Peter\u2019s outstretched arms. Talia gently took the Sheriff by the arm.\n\u201cSheriff, may I speak with you a moment?\u201d She winced, her vocal chords and lungs still healing which made her voice a harsh rasp. He nodded, and let her steer him back towards his cruiser. She was surprised to see that the driver\u2019s window had been shattered, caved in from the outside. \u201cYou seem troubled.\u201d \n\u201cAnd you seem fairly calm for someone who almost burned alive.\u201d The Sheriff coughed and he turned to look at the house. \u201cI\u2026 It\u2019s just unbelievable.\u201d\nTalia could hear that he wasn\u2019t talking about the fire. \n\u201cWhat was?\u201d\nHis gaze moved to the boy, who was delicately picking glass out of his feet. He said something to Naomi that had her laughing, her shoulders shaking as she tried to hold it in.\n\u201cThat kid. He broke into my car and led us here. He was on the walkie the whole way, telling us about an arson conspiracy, he had the names of the two goons we found out back\u2014and we\u2019re tracking down Kate Argent as we speak.\u201d At the mention of the name Argent, Talia almost lost control, wanting to snarl and snap until all she knew was vengeance. She caught Peter\u2019s eye and he mouthed, later. The Sheriff blew out a long breath, suddenly looking a lot older than he actually was. \u201cHe led us right to you, and still we were almost too late.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost, but you weren\u2019t.\u201d\nSheriff Stilinski was a good man under his weathered-cop facade. Even with all the loss in his life, he protected Beacon Hills and still loved his son fully. Talia wanted to smooth away the worry lines from his forehead. The paramedics arrived, sirens whining, and the Sheriff made a move toward the boy.\n\u201cI should\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCould you give me a minute with him?\u201d The Sheriff raised an eyebrow. Talia wasn\u2019t sure if she remembered how to play a frightened single mother, but she gave it her best shot. \u201cPlease, I just want to say thank you, I was so worried for him.\u201d \n\u201cYou get one minute.\u201d\nHis voice was like stone and Talia knew that he knew she was up to something, and that she had sixty seconds to try and do it. Humans rarely were able to make Talia feel exposed but she was already making her way to the boy. He looked up, his fingers and feet sticky with his own blood. His heartbeat was beginning to slow back to a normal pace and he smiled, his teeth white beneath the crimson. He smelled proud underneath the singed hair and ash. The Sheriff began his approach and Talia knelt before the boy, speaking softly. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\nHe swallowed and Talia knew the rest of the Pack that was present leaned forward. \n\u201cStiles.\u201d \nThe Sheriff was too close for anything more to be said. Peter couldn\u2019t decide who he wanted to stare holes into more, Talia or Stiles. Cora clutched Naomi and Stiles\u2019s heartbeat was steady, his eyes studying the cars, the officers, like he was ready to run if he had to. Talia glanced at the shards of glass in his feet before turning, meeting the Sheriff head on. \n::::\nTalia\u2019s story went like this: \nStiles was an old and dear family friend from out of town who, while very jetlagged and still aching from the cramped economy seats, just so happened to be at the right place at the right time. \nPeter thought it was the flimsiest cover, and he knew the Sheriff didn\u2019t believe it for a second\u2014they all knew that\u2014but his face softened when Derek and Laura were reunited with them at the station. Peter recognized the scent of loss and empathy\u2014and how close they\u2019d come to being broken and burned away. Stiles sat off to the side, his hands and feet covered in gauze\u2014and the Sheriff sighed. It was a gamble, and it paid off as they all walked out of the station and down the dark road towards a hotel. \nTalia led them, holding Cora\u2019s hand, Stiles, Laura, and Derek followed, Stiles\u2019s arm around Derek\u2019s shoulder as he limped along. His back was straight, his fingers twitching at his sides. \nSoft blonde locks brushed Peter\u2019s shoulders as Naomi bumped his hand with her fingers. Peter watched her pale green eyes focus on their human savior, brushing blonde hair out of her face. \nShe was the oldest daughter of the Boudreau Pack on the east coast, and for an arranged marriage, Peter couldn\u2019t do much better. \n\u201cWould you like to go back to your Pack?\u201d \nHe wouldn\u2019t blame her and he was sure that as soon as the news got out about what happened at the Hales, her Pack would want her home for a little while. Instead, she flashed him a grin.\n\u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m not missing his,\u201d she nodded toward Stiles, \u201cexplanation, not for anything.\u201d \nThey checked in, worn and weary, and Peter had to admit, the kid had everyone\u2019s attention as soon as the door swung shut behind them. Stiles stayed by the door, playing with the sleeves of his stained red hoodie as the Pack gathered in front of him. Peter stayed in the back with Naomi, his posture that of disinterest, his arms crossed as he leaned against the wall. \nStiles swallowed, his heartbeat kicking up a notch as he clutched his backpack. \n\u201cOkay. What I\u2019m about to say isn\u2019t the most\u2026 plausible.\u201d Stiles\u2019s eyes were drawn to Peter, Cora, and Derek the most. He licked his lips; his eyes meeting Peter\u2019s before he quickly glanced away. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. 2015, actually, and I came back in time to save you guys from the fire.\u201d Stiles shrugged, his smile tight. Some blood was still crusted around his nostrils. \u201cFor such a forbidden spell, it wasn\u2019t that hard to do.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d All heads whipped around to Peter. He spoke, his voice betraying him. \u201cNo one has ever survived that spell.\u201d\nPeter knew. He had the tomes to prove it, the centuries of accounts of madness, of self-mutilation to the point of suicide\u2014and in some cases spontaneous dismemberment. Stiles\u2019s heartbeat remained steady as he stared at Peter, a crooked smile stretching across his face.\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m the lucky first.\u201d \nHis heart didn\u2019t skip a beat and Peter\u2019s mouth was dry because this kid had done what countless others had given their lives for in the name of greed, revenge, or justice\u2014and this skinny boy with chapped lips shrugged, uncomfortable with the Pack\u2019s awed focus. Talia was quiet, and Peter felt a momentary surge of rage for her softness, so he asked the obvious. \n\u201cWhy come back for us?\u201d Naomi bristled next to him, but Peter didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t have a problem with taking charge. \u201cWe\u2019re a relatively small back, and I don\u2019t mean to offend, what do you get out of us living?\u201d \nLaura flinched and Derek looked down at his hands. Talia clenched her fists and Stiles\u2014\nStiles reeked of rage and such a deep grief that Naomi covered her nose. \n\u201cBecause some people actually give a shit about you, Peter. And all the shit my friends\u2026 my family went through stemmed from this fire\u2014and for God\u2019s sake, I just wanted them and your family to have a fucking chance\u2014\u201d His voice broke and instantly his hands were at his eyes even though it did nothing to hide the smell of salt. Peter opened his mouth to push for more, but Talia glared at him, eyes red, and Peter\u2019s jaw slammed shut. They watched Stiles take a few deep breaths before taking his fingers away from his red-rimmed eyes. He glanced at Cora, a shaky smile on his lips. \u201cSorry for swearing.\u201d \nCora smiled, and Peter felt some tension go out of his shoulders at the brightness that remained in her eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve heard worse from Laura\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Laura pinched Cora\u2019s side, blushing. She straightened, her eyes on Stiles. \u201cSo, did you know any of us?\u201d\nStiles nodded.\n\u201cYeah, uh\u2014Derek, Cora and\u2014and Peter.\u201d\nLaura swallowed as the rest of them let it sink in. Peter had so many questions pressing against his lips. Laura stood and extended her hand. \n\u201cI\u2019m Laura. Derek and Cora\u2019s older sister.\u201d\nStiles smiled, and it took years off his eyes as Naomi talked up to him next.\n\u201cNaomi, Peter\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\u201cWife?\u201d Stiles gaped, his eyes flickering form Peter to Naomi, his throat clicking. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. Neat.\u201d \nNaomi stepped away, making room for Talia. Stiles\u2019s lips parted when she shook her hand, and it made Peter\u2019s teeth ache. Eventually Talia pushed the two beds together and the Pack piled on, needing to be close to reassure themselves that they were all still alive. Stiles sat with his back against the door, his arms and legs bracketing his backpack. \nThough his eyes were closed, Stiles was still awake, even as the rest of the Pack drifted off to sleep. Peter rested his chin on Naomi\u2019s shoulder, and focused on Stiles\u2019s too-careful-to-be-real deep breathing and elevated heartbeat.\nSix hours later, Naomi gently shook Peter awake, looking unfairly put together despite her crinkled clothes.\n\u201cHurry up, darling, or you\u2019ll miss breakfast.\u201d\nPeter sat up quickly, hating how sluggish he felt. Naomi tied up her hair in a messy bun, pouting at her reflection before turning away. Peter rubbed his eyes, forcing himself to get on his feet. \n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d\n\u201cAt the diner.\u201d\nThe walk over was brisk and sure enough, everyone was crammed into a booth in the far corner. Stiles was sandwiched between Cora and Derek, a mountain of curly fries in front of him. The points and angles of his face were too sharp and he ate quickly and efficiently, eyelashes fluttering at the greasy taste. Talia stood, talking Naomi by the arm to accompany her outside. \nLaura watched stiles with a mixture of fascination and pity while Derek shared his French toast with Cora. Peter tapped Laura\u2019s shoulder, nodding towards the window where her mother spoke on her cell phone. Laura was out of her seat in a moment, and Peter slid in her place. \nStiles paused, wallowing awkwardly before he dabbed his fingers on the crummy paper napkin. Cora separated them, but luckily she was short enough to make it easy for Peter to make eye contact with Stiles. The young man smiled weakly, the circles under his eyes deep and dark.\n\u201cSorry about yelling yesterday, I was a little, uh, high strung.\u201d\nHis leg bounced and he was twisting his straw wrapped mercilessly. Peter shrugged. \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d And oddly enough, it was. Stiles sucked down his water in less than a minute, then began to chew on the ice cubes. \u201cTalia is taking care of the insurance, and after she settles that she will ask you if you\u2019d like to stay with us.\u201d\nStiles blinked, throat bobbing. \n\u201cShe is?\u201d \n\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d \nEven without superior hearing Peter was certain that Talia would do everything in her power to attempt to repay Stiles for their lives. Peter understood, but not to the same degree. For most debts he was fine with writing a check and sending the do-gooder on their way. Peter didn\u2019t like how he thought Stiles deserved more. Stiles returned his eyes to the window, to Talia and Naomi. His heartbeat kicked up and Peter could taste the buzz of fear on him with the strangest hints of hope and despair. It permeated the air for a moment before Stiles blew it away with a rough exhale. \n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\nDerek and Cora both turned to look at Peter with their young, big eyes. Peter had to bite down the instinctual pithy response, \u201cfor annoying time-travelers to stop being obviously obtuse.\u201d Stiles\u2019s lips twitched like he could hear it anyway, the gleam in his eyes daring Peter to say it. \nPeter stole the last curly fry off the plate, forcing his shoulders to relax. \n\u201cI think,\u201d the bell above the door jingled, Naomi, Laura, and Talia returning. \u201cI think staying in one place to get your bearings would be beneficial.\u201d \nPeter had so many questions and he couldn\u2019t honestly say that he wouldn\u2019t chase Stiles down to get answers. Keeping him close was safer, easier. And, judging by the way Cora bounced and Derek relaxed, the Pack wouldn\u2019t mind him staying. Stiles chewed on his straw when Talia smiled at him.\n\u201cStiles, would you like to take a walk with me?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, as long as you don\u2019t mind my hobble.\u201d \nHe never looked back to Peter as they meandered out of the door. Naomi carded her fingers through Peter\u2019s hair. Laura wrung her hands and looked at Peter sharply. \n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll stay with us?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d Peter let out a long breath that he hated to admit that he was holding. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d \n::::\nSleeping in a bed took some getting used to. The first night Stiles didn\u2019t trust the soft mattress and unfairly decadent feather-stuffed pillows; he tossed and turned all night until his eyes fell shut at dawn\u2014and he woke two days later because Cora shook him and sighed, \u201cOh good, you\u2019re alive,\u201d when he opened his eyes. After that, sleeping was easy, like falling backwards into clouds. \nThree weeks into living with the Hales and Stiles still woke up with a jolt, reaching for arms that weren\u2019t around him, turning towards the chest that wasn\u2019t at his back. Every morning was the same, he\u2019d start off warm, content, and when he\u2019d reach for the warmth that was never there, he\u2019d jerk awake thinking where\u2019s Peter, oh God, where\u2019s Peter\u2014\nMorning dew still clung to the grass, the horizon a thin blue line as the sun struggled to rise. \nPearly white scars on his hands and feet were the only things left of that night, stretched across his hands like spider webs. In the safety of the daybreak, Stiles pulled up the right sleeve of his hoodie, exposing Peter\u2019s bite mark.\n\nMate.\n\nIt felt heavy on the tongue even if Stiles was fully aware Peter did it to give Stiles a better sense of self-preservation. Stiles had woken up in the hospital, and the first thing Peter said to him was, \u201cHow would you feel about becoming my Mate?\u201d He\u2019d been a little peaky, running his fingers over Stiles\u2019s wrist as Lydia cleared her throat, but Peter ignored her. Stiles remembered smiling and saying, \u201cSure, why not?\u201d \nPeople weren\u2019t head-over-heels for death if they had someone to live for, so Peter stepped up to be that person. And it was a source of comfort for a while, Stiles running his fingers over the scar on his wrist, the permanent indentation of Peter\u2019s fangs. \nThey didn\u2019t even kiss until months later, and that had Stiles thinking maybe Peter hadn\u2019t offered it just to keep Stiles invested in living. \nA chilly breeze cut through him, yanking Stiles back to the present (well, past if he was being technical, heh) and he pushed his sleeve down. Just in time, as it so happened, because Derek jogged up to him, still in his pajamas. He slowed by Stiles\u2019s side, and they walked in silence together for a few moments before Derek finally spoke, his voice nowhere near the grumpy baritone that had become so familiar to Stiles. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Derek swallowed, his throat clicking and his face so expressive that Stiles couldn\u2019t help but stare. \u201cI think\u2026 Cora and I saw you yesterday, at the playground. You were\u2014are\u2014a little kid. Your dad was\u2014is\u2014the Sheriff.\u201d \nOh. \nStiles paused their morning stroll and Derek turned, his face looking so broken and guilty that Stiles had to put a stop to it because this time history would be different. This time they\u2019d have a chance to be happy.\n\u201cYeah. Sheriff\u2019s son. Still gangly, still awkward, just a lot taller.\u201d Stiles stretched, some bones in his neck popping. \u201cYou know what the best part about being back in time is?\u201d Derek shook his head and Stiles grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to know what\u2019s cool before any of you.\u201d\nStiles boggled Derek\u2019s mind with the reveal that jeans were about to get \u201cskinny\u201d and that Nicki Minaj was a songstress. He did his best impression of her cackle before making Derek blush and laugh as Stiles proudly shouted, \u201cMy pussy put his ass to sleep, now they callin\u2019 me Nyquil.\u201d Stiles laughed so hard his lungs burned and his eyes stung. He bent over, hands on his knees as Derek giggled, high-pitched and free.\nDerek\u2019s shoulders were still shaking as they stumbled over the stone driveway. Derek reached to catch him, but then turned at the last second, looking to where the driveway turned and hid itself in the trees.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stiles could see or hear anything out of the ordinary\u2026 until he felt Rumbles, making his body shudder like an earthquake was about to split the ground in half. Stiles was the only one shaking, nothing else quivered at all, and he knew it was a warning as he turned to an ashen Derek. \u201cDerek, what is it?\u201d \n\u201cHunters. In a car\u2014I can smell wolfsbane\u2014\u201d\nStiles shoved Derek, hard enough to make him stumble. \n\u201cGo. Tell your Pack. I can take \u2018em.\u201d Rumbles eased up, but now Stiles could hear the car. He pushed Derek again. \u201cI said go!\u201d \nDerek ran, vanishing from Stiles\u2019s line of sight as he turned to see a black SUV rolling steadily toward him. The windows were tinted and Stiles didn\u2019t move an inch, even when it came to a reluctant halt in front of him. Stiles rested his scarred hands on the hot metal. The driver\u2019s door opened and Victoria Argent stepped down. Stiles swallowed, determined not to tremble as she eyed him with cold calculation. \n\u201cPlease get out of my way.\u201d\nStiles put on his best smile. \n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable where I am, thanks.\u201d The passenger\u2019s door opened and there was Chris, clean-shaven and younger. Stiles widened his stance a little. \u201cBut if all you want is a chat I\u2019m a charming conversationalist. I\u2019d be happy to swap some heartwarming stories and s\u2019mores.\u201d \nGolden sunlight streaked over the grass and warmed Stiles\u2019s back. The car idled for a moment before Victora shifted her weight. \n\u201cThe police report mentioned a Good Samaritan.\u201d Stiles kept his face impassive even as his heartbeat ramped up. He considered it a small blessing that, while intimidating and intuitive, the Argents were still human and stuck with average hearing. \u201cAccording to the Sheriff, if that Good Samaritan hadn\u2019t been there the Hales would have burned to death.\u201d\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re pretty lucky then.\u201d\nStiles was closer to Victoria but if he had to go up against someone he\u2019d pick Chris. Either way he\u2019d be dead, but Chris would finish him quickly. Victoria smiled. \n\u201cRelax. We\u2019re here to apologize. No need to be so dramatic.\u201d \nStiles opened his mouth to say he was being appropriately stoic and not at all scared when Peter\u2019s voice came from right behind him.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it dramatic, just precautionary\u2014really, Stiles?\u201d \nStiles threw himself against the car, then rolled to the side with the embarrassing squeak of metal on skin introducing his fall. Naomi was there to help him up with a smirk. Stiles felt his cheeks burning, brushing himself off as Chris started to have a mysterious coughing fit that Stiles just knew was laughter. Victoria waited for Chris to recover before she addressed Peter. \n\u201cKate had dropped off the map a few years ago\u2026 and I had no idea what she\u2019d been meaning to do to your family. Since they announced the court date, we\u2019ve come to testify.\u201d \n\u201cHow very kind and selfless of you.\u201d Peter\u2019s smile was slow and sarcastic. Stiles swallowed, forcing himself to look away. \u201cWhat could possibly be done to repay your generosity?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. A crime was committed by one of our own and she\u2019ll be brought to justice for it. We\u2019ll be staying in town for the time being.\u201d Victoria pushed herself off of the car and took long strides to Stiles, not flinching when the sudden movement made Peter bristle and Naomi expose her fangs. \u201cIf you need to get in contact with me, use this number.\u201d \nShe handed him a sleek business card and he slid it into his pocket.\n\u201cThanks, I think.\u201d Victoria kept staring at him and Stiles stuck out his chin slightly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cBe careful with wild animals, Samaritan. They\u2019re cute and fuzzy until someone gets bitten.\u201d \nThis time the growl came from Peter. Victoria turned on her heel and soon her, Chris, and their environmentally unfriendly SUV were gone. Stiles rolled his eyes. \n\u201cAnd they accused us of being dramatic. Rude.\u201d Stiles turned to see the rest of the Hale Pack staring at him. Derek was ashen and before Stiles could reassure him everything was fine, he was being hugged. Hugged by Derek Hale. Stiles took a moment before he squeezed Derek back. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It was all fine, I told you, I can take them.\u201d \n::::\nVictoria Argent felt a mixture of shame and disgust at her sister-in-law at the courthouse. Her blonde hair was matted and she leered at the young Hale boy from the stand, barring her teeth like an animal. She delivered her piece calmly without a hint of remorse for Kate. \nShe felt Talia, the Alpha, staring at her, and Victoria placed her hand on Chris\u2019s arm.\n\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nVictoria slipped out of the courtroom, needing to breathe\u2014\nA girlish shriek made Victoria jerk her body into a battle ready stance when\u2026 she saw the Good Samaritan sliding down the marble floor on his knees, Allison on his shoulders with a wide grin on both their faces. The Samaritan saw Victoria and faltered, falling and skidding on his side while making sure to keep Allison off the ground. The end result was the Samaritan\u2019s cheek mashed against the marbles as Allison bounced on top of him, chirping \u201cAgain, again!\u201d \nWith an overly dramatic groan, the Samaritan sat up, Allison\u2019s tiny arms around his neck. Victoria helped him to his feet, brushing off the boy\u2019s shoulders because she didn\u2019t want Allison getting dirty and it would bother the Hales if they could smell her on him. It was pithy, but Victoria needed a distraction. The Samaritan\u2019s throat clicked, his eyes jittery. \n\u201cSo\u2026 how did it go in there?\u201d \n\u201cAs well as you\u2019d expect. Please, don\u2019t stop playing on my account.\u201d\nThe Samaritan raised his eyebrows, but it didn\u2019t take much wheedling from Allison to convince Stiles to start racing her around the courthouse. When the trial was over, the Samaritan had Allison standing on his shoes so they did an offbeat, circular waltz down the halls.\nAs soon as the doors opened, the boy stopped, his once carefree expression gone. Victoria watched his eyes pick through the crowd until he could see the Hales. For such a brave young man he wasn\u2019t very good at hiding his relief at seeing them. He picked Allison up effortlessly so she didn\u2019t get lost in the flood of people. Victoria took Allison off his hands and quickly joined Chris out in the parking lot, giving the Hales and the Samaritan some privacy. She glanced over her shoulder briefly to see Talia place her hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder exactly where Victoria\u2019s had been. \nBeing outside was a relief. \nChris kissed her cheek, and Victoria felt a surge of overwhelming love for him\u2014she was so lucky to have him\u2014and he offered her a crooked smile. \n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d \nVictoria blew out a long breath. She needed to decompress, she needed to move past the shame of an Argent becoming so vile and twisted, she needed to use their creed as a mantra to ground her. She turned to see the Hales emerge, Derek with red eyes and shaky hands with his mother\u2019s arms around his shoulders and his sisters by his side. The uncle and his wife were more distant, but they never strayed too far from the rest of the Park. \nThe Samaritan hung back. Chris followed Victoria\u2019s eyes and made a low, questioning hum in his throat. The boy\u2026 while he looked relieved had an underlying fear for them. He was too skinny, if Victoria was being honest. \n\u201cGood Samaritan.\u201d\nThe boy rolled his eyes, his easy-going smile sliding firmly into place. \n\u201cMy name is Stiles, I told you that.\u201d \nVictoria smiled, hoping it was enough to look dangerous. \n\u201cStiles, would you be so kind as to join my husband and I for dinner?\u201d \nTo his credit, Stiles didn\u2019t bat an eye as he nodded. \n\u201cSurely. Though I\u2019d ask you don\u2019t keep me too late, I\u2019m an early bird.\u201d\nHe hid his cunning with bravado and wit. He\u2019d do well as a Hunter, it was a shame the Wolves found him first. Chris prepared a feast of French food that melted in the mouth. Even Stiles, when he walked in, couldn\u2019t keep up his playfully aloof persona as his jaw dropped. Allison giggled and Chris smirked. \n\u201cI was going to offer you a drink first, but how about we just get to the meal?\u201d\nStiles was all jittery motion, starting and stopping between stories, all strung together with pretty little punch lines. He kept it up even after Allison went to bed and as he washed the dishes. Chris poured them all coffee. Victoria watched Stiles dump spoon after spoon of sugar into his cup. \n\u201cSo, thanks for dinner.\u201d Stiles sniffed, rubbing the tip of his nose impishly. \u201cWill you guys be leaving town soon?\u201d\n\u201cActually, we\u2019ve been liking the look of the schools out here. Might be a good place to raise Allison.\u201d \nVictoria leaned back to avoid the coffee that sprayed from Stiles\u2019s mouth. Chris watched, leaning against the counter. Stiles put down the coffee and his mask dropped immediately, his eyes harder than titanium. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that we need to lay down some ground rules.\u201d\n\u201cWe do?\u201d\nVictoria tried to lure him back with her playful tone but Stiles didn\u2019t blink. \n\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely. And if you have a problem with that either get out of town or change your mind.\u201d\nHis fear was back but Victoria couldn\u2019t tell exactly what or whom Stiles was afraid of. His fear didn\u2019t cripple him like most; it didn\u2019t isolate and restrain him. It made him tough; it made the circles under his eyes more pronounced as he spoke directly with an unwavering voice. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re serious I\u2019m not leaving until we figure this out. Because sure, Kate was a bad seed, but there will be others like her and I won\u2019t let you become that. Because the Hales\u2014they protect Beacon Hills because it\u2019s their home. And it\u2019ll be just a little problematic if you\u2019re breathing down their neck every step of the way.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re wolves\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJesus, they\u2019re people, not rabid animals.\u201d Stiles scratched at his neck, his eyes frantic. \u201cPlease hear me, okay? The world isn\u2019t back and white; if you start thinking that way you\u2019ll just end up like Kate. This isn\u2019t some zero-sum game and I\u2014I want to help you, I do, but not if you don\u2019t work with me on this.\u201d \nThin lines of blood sprung up on his neck, but Stiles didn\u2019t notice, he kept scratching until Chris pulled his hand away, a towel in his hand. Stiles swallowed at the sight of blood on his fingers, not flinching when Chris wiped it away.\nVictoria Argent was familiar with dangerous people and beasts of all variations. There were those that were merely satisfying a hunger, others were righteous, and some were so cold and precise about taking life it was thrilling and agonizing to be in their presence. Chris hummed under his breath as he wrapped Stiles\u2019s neck in gauze. \nStiles was dangerous. \nEveryone had a level of danger to them, and Stiles\u2026 he was human, but one that was afraid, and his fears weren\u2019t about the Hales, but more about the Argents. It didn\u2019t take a genius to hear the real desperation, the please don\u2019t force my hand, because there is no gong back once we\u2019re on that road, please\u2014please\u2014\nVictoria sipped her coffee.\n\u201cAll right. Sell me a compromise.\u201d \nStiles beamed before launching into an adamant debate, arms flailing as they haggled until both of their voices were hoarse, and when Stiles checked the time it was two in the morning. Stiles had written up a contract that all parties would sign, and then he pressed a bloody thumbprint onto the paper. \u201cFor theatrics,\u201d he said with a wink. \nIt wasn\u2019t that Victoria was afraid of Stiles, but she was afraid of whatever made his eyes get the desperate gleam that promised dismal chaos. It was gone when he locked eyes with her, his voice a weak croak as he said, \u201cWe protect those who can\u2019t protect themselves.\u201d \nVictoria drove Stiles back to the Hales, the digital clock on the dash glowing 2:45 at them mockingly. Stiles clutched his copy of the agreement and as soon as they came to a stop in the driveway he was out of the car. The Hales were waiting, all of them gathered on the porch. Stiles waved his arms excitedly. \nThe Alpha wrapped her arms around him, her hands pressing against the bandages before ushering them inside. \nVictoria might never know where Stiles came from, but one thing was for certain: the Hales were much luckier to have him than he was to have them. \n::::\nNaomi met Peter at a lake house in upstate New York. She thought it was just dreadful, her Pack dressed in awful neutral colors and laughing too loudly at their own jokes. The walls were so pressed with people that Naomi couldn\u2019t find her future husband. \nThat night Naomi snuck away to the docks, letting the fish nip at her toes. She hadn\u2019t been sitting for more than five minutes when confident footsteps creaked against the wood. She turned to see a tall fellow with an unopened champagne bottle and a crooked smile. Instantly she knew it was Peter Hale, just as he knew she was Naomi Boudreau. He sat next to her and promised that he\u2019d never ask her to wear beige.\nHer lungs still burned from the smoke as she looked at the young man who saved them, seemingly out of nowhere with no explanations. He hissed, gingerly picking glass out of his feet. When he saw her staring he waggled his eyebrows and wheezed out, \u201cYipee ki-ay, motherfucker.\u201d \nNaomi laughed until her throat stung. \n\u201cYou know, this is totally cheating.\u201d Stiles stretched, his back popping as he surveyed the mall map. \u201cI mean, I would totally do it too\u2014just letting know it\u2019s cheating, asking the guy from the future what would be the best Christmas presents for the in-laws.\u201d \nNaomi pinched his side, making him squawk about being a delicate human. He was human, completely human with not a speck of magic left in him, but he was anything but delicate. Naomi watched him, the same way the rest of the Hales watched him, as he seamlessly brought the Argents to a compromise and researched any invaders into their territory. \nStiles carried all the bags and he flipped through movies for Cora when Naomi rested her chin on his shoulder.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t said what you wanted.\u201d\nStiles shrugged with his other shoulder. \n\u201cI\u2019m pretty good. Got a roof over my head and I\u2019m still alive. Everything is looking up for Stiles.\u201d \nThey dodged frustrated mothers and wailing children, and they found themselves taking refuge in a Barnes and Noble. Naomi watched Stiles tug at his sleeves restlessly, worrying his bottom lip raw. He moved fast, not lingering in any aisle for more than a few moments before be pressed Unmasking the Face into her hands.\n\u201cHere. Peter will like it.\u201d He smiled, warm with a hint of steel underneath, like he tasted something bitter while someone told him a joke. \u201cIt\u2019ll help him with the games he likes to play.\u201d\nNaomi was struck speechless, her jaw clicking shut as she sucked in a breath and took a step away from Stiles. She thought it was a secret; the way Peter would sometimes be so slick that she thought it was a trick of the eye even though deep down she knew it wasn\u2019t true. \nShe ran her fingers along the book\u2019s spine.\nEven though it was an arranged marriage, Naomi liked to think that she knew her husband more than most. She knew his curiosity was his biggest vice, his thirst for knowledge bigger than a lust for power. She wondered if Peter\u2019s vices were more pronounced in the future, and if that was why Stiles acted differently around him compared to the rest of the Pack. \nHe was tactile, happily sweeping Derek and Cora into hugs on a whim, high-fiving Laura despite how it stung his palms\u2014and touching Naomi or Talia\u2019s arms to get their attention. He had no problem sprawling out on the couch, wiggling his toes under Derek\u2019s legs as he read a book with Cora. \nHe never touched Peter.\nNaomi wasn\u2019t sure if anyone other than Peter and herself had noticed. How even at the slightest touch, a simple press on the wrist, would make Stiles flinch\u2014though he\u2019d pass it off as too much energy, always flashing a goofy grin at Peter as he increased the distance between them. When Naomi wrapped the book in gold paper it felt heavy in her hands, like Stiles\u2019s stare would get when he thought no one was watching. \nChristmas Eve was the main holiday for the Hales, and Christmas Day was reserved for being as lazy as possible while wearing pajamas. Eve, however, was when the formal clothes came out. Peter wore a fitted vest with matching slacks. Naomi had on a navy blue dress with her favorite winter jacket. \n\u201cI used to hate Christmas.\u201d Peter spoke suddenly, his voice cutting through the comfortable silence. He lifted his bag of gifts from the bed and took Naomi\u2019s before she could grab it. Their private cottage was a mile out, a healthy distance from the house. Their breath puffed in front of them as their footsteps crunched along the amber grass. \u201cIt would make me feel like my own Pack\u2026 my family\u2026 didn\u2019t know me because gift after gift was another thing I\u2019d never want or need.\u201d \n\u201cDid it ever get better for you? Do they know you now?\u201d\nBefore he could answer, Laura threw open the door, \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d blaring loudly behind her. She smiled like she hadn\u2019t been expecting to, her mascara a little fuzzy around the edges. Stiles came sliding out into the foyer in socks and the ugliest sweater Naomi had ever seen. It lit up and the colors clashed so badly it almost made her eyes cross. \nCora and Derek came running after them, their formal wear already wrinkled, a few buttons and bows slipping free as they gave chase. Laura grabbed their bags of gifts and hauled them inside, letting some fang slip through.\n\u201cStiles won\u2019t tell us where he hid the control fro the CD player and he has six discs of what he calls the obnoxious classics and\u2014\u201d\nIt was a massacre of tinsel and Alvin and the Chipmunks. Naomi tried to ask if this was normal, but once she saw Peter\u2019s stunned face she had her answer. \nTalia was by the tree, turning down the music as sounds of laughter echoed through the house. Talia took their coats, a soft smile on her face.\n\u201cHe said it used to be a tradition in his house.\u201d The Alpha shrugged. \u201cHe deserves the feeling of home.\u201d \nStiles came panting into the room, Cora on his back and Derek at his side as they fell onto the couch. Laura joined them, and then it was time for presents. Naomi knew it was selfish, going first, giving the book to Peter. He unwrapped it, a bemused smile on his face as the paper fell away\u2014\nPeter\u2019s face seemed to shudder and shift, his throat clicked and his eyes shone as he looked at her. His gaze was luminous, his cheeks pink, lips parted, and it was the first time anyone had looked at her like she was someone to be worshipped. Peter was halfway across the room, his blue eyes dark and his hand reaching for her, and Naomi couldn\u2019t stop the words passing her lips.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me\u2014Stiles, he picked it out.\u201d \nPeter came to a halt, his momentum making him sway as he turned to Stiles\u2014Stiles whose face was red as he sat up from the puppy pile on the couch. He smelled betrayed and embarrassed, but his heartbeat didn\u2019t lie. Naomi was glad she couldn\u2019t see Peter\u2019s face because Stiles was shaking. Peter\u2019s voice was a low growl, his shoulders stiff. \n\u201cGet up.\u201d \nStiles stood right away and he barely had a moment to breathe before Peter pulled him into a tight embrace. \n::::\nDerek liked Stiles. He had a feeling it was impossible to not like Stiles, and he even mentioned it to the human and Stiles laughed until he cried, barely able to wheeze out a, \u201cOh man, I wish I could have shown you to future-Derek, Derek.\u201d Derek had blushed but Stiles wiped his eyes and suggested Mario Kart. He made everything seem effortless, his jokes, the stories he\u2019d tell about television shows in the future, and there were nights when he\u2019d stay up late in silence with Derek until they ended up passed out together in a tangled sprawl. \nBut the thing was\u2014as cool and at-ease Stiles could be\u2026 there was an underlying wrongness in him that made Derek\u2019s throat tighten. He knew his mom could see it but she was too afraid, too indebted to press any further. So Derek swallowed his pride and slid into Laura\u2019s room first thing in the morning. Predictably she raised a judgmental brow, making Derek avert his eyes as she stood and crossed her arms. \n\u201cIt\u2019s police to knock.\u201d Her voice was already developing into something sharp, a perfect Alpha tone. Her eyes softened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \nShe could smell it on him, which was why Derek went to Laura before anyone else was awake, before the rest of the Pack could corner him at breakfast, full of suffocating warmth and concern. Stiles understood how important space could be, how sometimes silence was much more comforting than a barrage of \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Derek, honey, just tell us what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s Stiles.\u201d Laura\u2019s expression tightened and she drew in a breath to parrot Talia\u2019s, He\u2019s fine, just making his way, Derek, Stiles is just fine, but Derek wasn\u2019t going to let her. \u201cHe\u2019s not fine, Laura, he isn\u2019t. You know that, you see it too, right?\u201d Because even though Stiles achieved what he set out to do, something was eating at him day-by-day, underneath his bright grins and uproarious laughter something dark pulled at his eyes. Laura was backing up to the bed, and Derek grabbed her wrist and squeezed. \u201cLaura.\u201d \nDerek\u2019s lungs were tight and he knew he smelled like terror and grief. He knew Stiles woke up with a gasp every morning, and that every morning he\u2019d sneak down to the laundry room to wash the tear stains off his sheets. \nMonths had passed since Christmas but the scene between Stiles and Peter was still fresh on the Pack\u2019s mind. Stiles had been shuddering, like he was expecting Peter to disembowel him instead of hug him\u2014and as soon as Peter touched Stiles\u2014Stiles went still. He\u2019d sighed, and when he relaxed into the hug it was the first time Stiles looked his age and not someone decades older. \nLaura pressed her forehead against Derek\u2019s. \n\u201cI know. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything we can do. Maybe he just needs to figure it out for himself.\u201d Derek growled and Laura pinched him. \u201cWell fine, Derek, you got any bright ideas?\u201d \n\u201cAsk him.\u201d Derek swallowed, his throat tight. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him out, for a movie and dinner, somewhere far away, and we\u2019ll ask him. He likes us, he trusts us.\u201d \nIt was unspoken but understood that it had to be them, not Talia, not Naomi, and especially not Peter. Laura grabbed her keys. \n\u201cWhen?\u201d \n\u201cToday. Soon. Now?\u201d \nBefore Laura could grab her purse, the door opened. Derek whipped around, hoping to God it wasn\u2019t Talia or Peter\u2014and Cora stood before them, looking defiant even in her elephant print pajamas. \n\u201cI\u2019m coming too.\u201d \nThe four of them piled into Laura\u2019s car, Stiles up front and fiddling with the radio and going, \u201cOh my God, I haven\u2019t heard this in forever,\u201d with every song. They made a whole day of it, watching a disappointing children\u2019s movie and wandering, driving all over California, going to Muir woods because of how much Stiles gushed about the trees, and then it was exploring towns, taking random turns off the interstate and listening to Stiles\u2019s steady heartbeat. \nThey wound up in a quiet diner tucked away from busy streets. Cora kept shooting Derek and Laura the most obvious looks over her tapioca pudding. Laura kicked her, kicking Derek in the process since he was between them. \n\u201cStiles?\u201d Stiles made a noise, looking up from his mountain of curly fries. \u201cIs\u2026 we feel bad, you know, you doing everything for us and we haven\u2019t done anything for you in return.\u201d \nStiles\u2019s mouth fell open.\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s not true\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI mean it, it must be hard, carrying all that weight. Is there something you want to tell us? We can help with some of that weight, Stiles\u2026 if you want.\u201d \nStiles\u2019s heartbeat kicked up a notch as his lips pulled back into a too-tight smile, his fork hitting his plate loudly. \n\u201cOh, guys\u2014I\u2019m just glad to be here and see all of you. Sometimes it\u2019s strange to see Derek so happy and full of emotions.\u201d Stiles winked even though he wasn\u2019t joking. \u201cCora, you were so fierce, a real force of nature.\u201d \nCora hiccupped, her eyes wide. \n\u201cReally?\u201d \n\u201cReally, really.\u201d Stiles shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s not a weight any of you have to carry because it\u2019s not going to happen anymore. When I knew you it was us against the world and\u2026 every day there was something out to kill us, and we\u2019d always defeat it.\u201d\nHe was lying, but he was so tense that Derek was willing to let it slide. Laura leaned forward, her eyes sharp. \n\u201cWere you our Pack?\u201d\nStiles blinked.\n\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t\u2014I only knew Derek, Peter, and Cora, and even then we were a rag-tag bunch. I\u2019m human so, I don\u2019t think I was Pack.\u201d \nDerek felt cold shock run through him. How broken was his future self if he couldn\u2019t immediately see the benefit of Stiles as a Pack member? His vocal chords betrayed him as he blurted out: \n\u201cHumans can be Pack.\u201d\nStiles\u2019s eyes dipped down to the straw wrapper he kept twisting between his fingers.\n\u201cWe never talked about it.\u201d\nLaura\u2019s alarm was palpable and Cora pressed herself closer to Derek. He didn\u2019t want to imagine the time Stiles came from, the horrors that made Pack an afterthought. Stiles\u2019s breathing was getting a hint of panic to it. Derek went to quickly change the subject when Laura interrupted him, her hands clenched into bone-white fists. \n\u201cDid you have a girlfriend?\u201d Stiles\u2019s heart was roaring. \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\nThe shocked silence only lasted a few moments, and then Stiles\u2019s brown eyes filled with tears and shit, SHIT. His hands covered his eyes, the stench of grief so strong Cora was crying in an instant. Laura swallowed, her shoulders rising and Cora slid out of the booth, throwing herself at Stiles\u2019s side. He jumped, then took his hands away from his red-rimmed eyes and immediately deflated. \n\u201cOh, oh Cora, don\u2019t cry, geez guys\u2014yes, I had someone\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t matter. This,\u201d he hugged Cora closer and nudged Derek and Laura with his feet, \u201cis more important. He\u2019d understand.\u201d \nHis heartbeat was steady as Cora hugged him tight while Derek was too ashamed to meet his gaze. The ride home was quiet. Cora slept in the back while Stiles hummed along with the radio. As they parked the car, Laura nudged him before they got out of the car.\n\u201cSorry if I pried too much, but I want you to know that we\u2019re happy you\u2019re here and staying with us.\u201d Laura swallowed. \u201cI can ask Mom, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to have you in the Pack if that\u2019s something you\u2026 wanted.\u201d \nDerek was trembling as Stiles\u2019s heartbeat rocketed as he scratched the back of his head. \n\u201cOh, uh\u2014I\u2019ll think about it. Right now, though, I\u2019m totally wiped. I\u2019m going to shower and crash.\u201d \nDerek held a sleeping Cora in his arms as Stiles sprinted up the stairs to the bathroom. Laura side-eyed Derek and his unease. \n\u201cHe just needs his space.\u201d She squeezed his shoulder. \u201cSometimes people just need to know that they have a support system, and we did that. You\u2019ll see, Derek.\u201d\nThe next morning Stiles was gone. \n::::\nCold witching-hour wind scraped over Stiles\u2019s skin. His backpack was slung over his shoulder as he made his way through the woods, out of the Hale preserve, and, God willing, out of Beacon Hills. Stiles could barely see his own hands but he knew it was the best time to leave while everyone was deep in their REM cycles. \nHis skin was tight with tried tears. He should have done this after the fire, he never should have stayed and tricked himself into thinking he could make it work. Naomi and Peter made a great pair, and the longer Stiles stayed, the more unfair it was to them. \nStiles had to stop and press the heels of his hands against his face because he couldn\u2019t cry anymore, so he just breathed in deeply until he felt safe moving again\u2014\nOnly to see Chris Argent standing in front of him.\n\u201cHoly fuck\u2014\u201d Stiles leapt back, hitting the ground hard. \u201cJesus\u2014what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cJogging.\u201d Stiles boggled at him. \u201cI could ask the same of you. You look like shit.\u201d \n\u201cThanks, Chris.\u201d\nStiles winced at how raw and worn he sounded. Chris pulled Stiles to his feet, brushing him off in a way that made Stiles miss his father fiercely. \n\u201cCome on, my car is close. You need to get cleaned up.\u201d \nChris\u2019s hand was warm on Stiles\u2019s back. He walked in a haze, settling back into the Argent house and letting Chris steer him into the kitchen. Stiles splashed water onto his face, over and over until he didn\u2019t feel so blurry around the edges, until he was sure he could breathe without crying. Chris, to his credit, drank orange juice straight from the carton like an emotionally unstable young man wasn\u2019t bent over his sink. The sun was beginning to peek over the horizon when Victoria shuffled into the kitchen wearing a blue nightgown. She stiffened, glancing at Stiles, but Chris made a low noise in his throat and she relaxed. Stiles cleared his throat, wincing at how much it burned. \n\u201cGood morning, Victoria. I\u2019ll be out of your hair in just a bit.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to rush.\u201d Chris smiled, kissing Victoria\u2019s temple quickly. \u201cYou seem to have a lot on your mind.\u201d \nUnderstatement of the year award went to Chris Argent. Stiles huffed a dry laugh, rubbing his eyes until they felt raw. Victoria started coffee and insisted he make breakfast in a poor repayment for intruding. Stiles made star-shaped pancakes, and it was worth it to hear Allison\u2019s gasp, \u201cPancakes? Stiles?\u201d before she leapt into his arms. \nStiles felt his body relax inch by inch because the Argents didn\u2019t know where he came from, they didn\u2019t have endless questions like the Hales. \nThere were days when Stiles could barely remember Peter\u2019s teasing jibes, or what smile he\u2019d wear when Stiles would kiss him awake. Scott\u2019s voice was becoming murkier with every passing minute\u2026 and there was nothing Stiles could do to keep a hold on them. It was unfair to project his memory onto this time, and he knew he crossed a line with the Paul Ekman book, the embrace he received that felt so familiar was not his to savor. \nAllison kissed Stiles on the cheek, clearing the miserable fog in his eyes for a moment. \n\u201cBye-bye, Stiles, thanks for the pancakes!\u201d\nWith a grin and a hop, Allison was out of the door followed by an exasperated Victoria. Stiles rubbed his temples. \n\u201cThanks for letting me catch my breath.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d \nThe clock ticked loudly on the wall. Stiles sighed. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to leave town. I\u2019ve overstayed my welcome with the Hales.\u201d\nChris\u2019s fists clenched, his blue eyes hardening as he stood. \n\u201cDid\u2014did they hurt you, Stiles?\u201d \n\u201cWhat? God no, what the fuck, they\u2019d never hurt me or anyone.\u201d Stiles rolled his eyes. \u201cI just think it would be best for them if I wasn\u2019t here anymore.\u201d\nStiles sucked in a breath, feeling lighter already. He touched Peter\u2019s bite mark through his sleeve and pretended it didn\u2019t make him shiver. In the time Stiles had come from, Peter claimed him as his mate and though they didn\u2019t get much privacy they would still have moments of \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d paired with moans of, \u201cyours, yours,\u201d and Stiles never kept track of who was claiming and being claimed. Sometimes Lydia would catch them, one memorable occasion ending up with Stiles kicking Peter off of him and Lydia laughing at them. \nThey never said the doomed, \u201cI love you.\u201d At the time Stiles told himself it was a matter of convenience and they had sex to pretend everything wasn\u2019t falling apart at their feet. It numbed them to the reality they were trapped in; the reality Stiles became determined to rescue them from.\nSitting in Chris\u2019s table, Stiles wondered if Peter had known he was lying to himself. \n\u201cHow are you planning on traveling?\u201d\nStiles shrugged, his grip tight on his backpack. \n\u201cProbably will hitchhike as far as I can.\u201d\nHe had no money and no working identification, but if there was one thing Stiles could do, it was survive. Chris shook his head.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you a train ticket.\u201d Chris had that soft look, a fatherly look that made Stiles flinch. \u201cBut I suggest thinking about it. Maybe things aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d\nStiles laughed too loudly. \n\u201cWow. That\u2019s not what I was expecting from you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the biggest fan of the Hales, but you\u2019re a good kid. And if they make you happy who am I to get in your way?\u201d\nPeter liked to say that no one\u2019s happiness mattered except his own. He\u2019d clip each word off with too much tooth and snarl after a hard fuck. He\u2019d bite Stiles\u2019s wrist and come hard, growling for Stiles to only worry about himself. Every morning since landing in 2005, Stiles could hear Peter screaming his name, screaming \u201cNo, Stiles\u2014NO\u2014\u201d\nHis knuckles were white, his skin pressed tight around his bones. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a moocher.\u201d\n\u201cJust a Good Samaritan, right?\u201d Stiles shoved a cold pancake into his mouth to keep himself from saying something stupid. \u201cWolves aren\u2019t generous with loyalty and trust. I can respect that; I think it\u2019s smart. Having someone live with them and not be Pack isn\u2019t a common occurrence.\u201d \nThe more time passed the more Stiles felt like he was drowning. He had too much memory and he could feel Talia staring at him because Stile was starting to slip. A war tore apart his mind and he just wanted them safe. \nHe thought that once he got back to 2005 he\u2019d figure it out; that he\u2019d save them gracefully and then all the details would weave together. Instead he made them worry; he drove Derek, Laura, and Cora to the point where they were one step away from begging him to confide in them. Stiles wanted to be with his father, not that Chris was unpleasant\u2026 but Stiles just wanted to hug his Dad. \n\u201cI\u2019ll drive you, if you want. Up to Seattle, that should be enough distance.\u201d\nFrigid hands clamped around Stiles\u2019s ribcage, and just like that he knew he couldn\u2019t leave. Lydia and Stiles spoke about it for hours, and it came down to a simple fact: Stiles was going back for all of them. If he saved the Hales he saved everyone. \n\u201cNo.\u201d Stiles pulled his hoodie tight around him. \u201cI want to go back.\u201d\nChris stood, brushing off his knees. \n\u201cRight now, or do you mind helping an old man with some yard work?\u201d \nStiles laughed because it was such a cheap \u201cDad\u201d trick, but he followed Chris out to rake leaves and chop wood. It was the right amount of grueling work that numbed Stiles\u2019s mind until the sky was orange. \nThe drive to the Hales was quiet, and Stiles felt a stab of guilt when he saw the whole Pack waiting for him, each one looking haggard and wrung out. Stiles took three steps onto the grass before Cora sprinted, tackling him to the ground and Stiles wheezed as Derek and Laura piled on. His cheeks were wet, but Stiles couldn\u2019t tell whom the tears were coming from. Cora pressed her face to his stomach, Derek clutching Stiles\u2019s side while Laura kept saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d into Stiles\u2019s ear. \nHe squeezed all three of them, baring his neck and letting them press their faces into his skin. \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Stiles could barely speak past the knot in his throat as he held them as close as he could. \u201cI won\u2019t leave again.\u201d \nHe\u2019d made a promise that he\u2019d go back for everyone, not just himself, and he intended to keep it. \n::::\nPeter never put himself under the illusion that he was a good person. Living in a world where people were either good or evil was a fairytale. Talia tried to ignore it, letting Peter dirty his hands with necessary violence. Even with his arranged marriage, Peter knew he\u2019d never love Naomi, and he told her that the night they met. \u201cLove is for children,\u201d Peter said before pouring her a flute of champagne. \nIn Peter\u2019s experience love was useful when it could be manipulated.\n\u201cLost another pawn.\u201d Peter smirked at Stiles even though the boy\u2019s heartbeat remained annoyingly steady. \u201cAre you even paying attention?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles\u2019s leg bounced as the sun sank, honey-tinged light seeping through the living room windows. Cora was laid out drawing on the floor and Derek was curled around a book. \u201cI hope you\u2019re taking this seriously.\u201d\nStiles believed in love, Peter could tell. Love is what brought Stiles back in time; love is what made him return to them in Chris Argent\u2019s car, swearing to never leave the Pack again. Love is what made him run through fire without a second thought. \nStiles never let himself be alone with Peter\u2026 and it was beginning to sting. They\u2019d had wonderful conversations, traded obscure facts about everything from monsters to poetry\u2014but the second Peter had Stiles alone the boy would find a reason to leave. It was a miracle that Peter was able to persuade him to play a game of chess, and he hated that Stiles only agreed because Derek and Cora were in the room. \nStiles rubbed his right wrist, hard enough that it made Peter\u2019s teeth ache.\n\u201cHave you ever considered becoming a wolf?\u201d Peter licked his lips as Stiles\u2019s heartbeat skyrocketed, his leg stilling. Derek and Cora froze, pretending not to listen as Peter leaned forward, his chair creaking. \u201cNow that all magic as been stripped from you, you\u2019re human. I think being a Wolf would suit you, and I\u2019m sure Talia would\u2014\u201d \nStiles\u2019s hand darted out, sweeping his bishop over and\u2014\n\u201cCheckmate.\u201d \nStiles jolted out of his chair and Peter glanced down to see that Stiles had indeed defeated him. Stiles was already on the other side of the room, shaking so hard that Peter felt a chill pass through him. Derek got up slowly, like Stiles was a skittish animal.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d\n\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d His teeth clacked together and he rubbed his arms. \u201cJust got a chill, you know?\u201d\nHe was lying and before anyone could comment, Stiles was out of the living room, past the foyer, and out the front door\u2014and Peter kept Derek and Cora behind him because the tremors had faded, but the stench of grim terror hadn\u2019t. \nThe Sheriff\u2019s cruiser rolled up, and when he stepped out with a grave expression Peter tugged his niece and nephew closer. The Sheriff met Peter\u2019s eyes as he informed them that Kate had escaped from prison. Stiles took a deep breath, his eyes dark and cold. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, we\u2019ve got to go somewhere else.\u201d He glanced back at the Sheriff. \u201cMaybe someplace by water so they only need to be on guard from one direction, but still populated enough that the neighbors aren\u2019t a thousand miles away.\u201d\n\u201cMy wife\u2014she had a vacation house.\u201d The Sheriff spoke in a daze, his gaze shifting uneasily between Peter and Stiles. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s safe, I\u2019ll have my officers escort you there. We can leave\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNow.\u201d Talia, Naomi, and Laura walked out in time for Stiles to push them back in the house. \u201cThrow the essentials in a bag, be back in the foyer in fifteen minutes.\u201d The house exploded into movement, except Peter. Stiles\u2019s pulse was steady, his trembling had stopped. He licked his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ll all go now, I\u2019ll follow up and pack up anything you missed and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter was surprised at his own voice. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\nLaura tugged her backpack onto her shoulders and the Sheriff and Stiles sighed and put their hands on their hips at the same time. Stiles seemed to notice and quickly slid his hands into his pockets. He threw their bags into the car, herding Naomi and Talia effortlessly, giving Derek and Cora tight hugs. Peter remembered thinking that Stiles could be a glorious Alpha if he put his mind to it. \nPeter had to run his tongue over his teeth to make sure that they weren\u2019t too sharp when he spoke to the Sheriff. \n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nHe stared at Stiles, at how the boy placed his body between the Pack and the woods until Talia, Naomi, Derek, and Cora were safe in the car. \nPeter was beginning to think Stiles viewed himself as nonessential. \nThey moved through the house quickly, the Sheriff waiting outside as they grabbed everyone\u2019s favorite games, books, and movies. Stiles twirled the keys around his fingers with a soft, \u201cI\u2019m driving,\u201d that left no room for questions. The plan was the Sheriff would follow their car up to the vacation house, and call for backup once he was there. Laura sat in the back, Peter at the passenger\u2019s side. Stiles was tap-tap-tapping the steering wheel when Laura snarled. \n\u201cStop it!\u201d They\u2019d just crossed the town square. Stiles pulled over to a coffee shop when pressed her hands to her eyes. \u201cCalm down, you\u2019re giving me a headache.\u201d Laura shoved the door open. \u201cI need something to drink.\u201d\nShe slammed the door shut, her eyes glimmering. Stiles kept his eyes ahead, his shoulders quivering. If Laura thought Stiles\u2019s heartbeat was deafening before, Peter was glad she was not with them now.\nHe stretched his legs out and thought of the Ekman book in his bag and how Stiles understood him to a level that made him equally unnerved and transfixed. Stiles still wouldn\u2019t look at him. Peter heaved out a dramatic sigh. \n\u201cWas I really so different in your time?\u201d It was hard to imagine himself being much different, but Stiles purposely never said much about his timeline. But he knew Peter, he made Peter comfortable in a way no one else had, when Peter had pulled Stiles into a hug he\u2019d hoped it would feel alien and awkward\u2026 but instead they fit together perfectly. \u201cI think I deserve to know why I make you so uncomfortable.\u201d \nThe leather steering wheel groaned under Stiles\u2019s grip and the air soured. Stiles finally looked at him with eyes that seemed to have been numbed down to a dull sheen. \n\u201cI met you\u2026 after you turned my best friend into a werewolf against his will. You were a deranged Alpha, all fucked up after the fire and you were killing everyone responsible but you needed a Pack. I never knew Laura because you ripped her in half to become Alpha.\u201d He recited the story like he was tired, not devastated and gutted anymore. Stiles rubbed his temples. \u201cWe killed you, then you came back and helped us for a while.\u201d \nLaura bounced on her feet while she waited in line. Peter wanted power, yes but\u2026 he couldn\u2019t imagine what state of mind he\u2019d need to have in order to murder his niece. Stiles bit his thumbnail. \n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Peter felt like he was drowning. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, isn\u2019t there?\u201d \nStiles curled in on himself, a sticky shine on his skin that smelled like soured ash. He lost all color in his face. \n\u201cGet out.\u201d Stiles\u2019s knuckles were about to break through his paper-thin skin. \u201cI need\u2014I can\u2019t breathe, not with you here. I just need a minute, please\u2014\u201d\nPeter was moving without consciously telling his body to do so. He stumbled into the coffee shop, almost colliding with Laura. He grabbed her shoulders, squeezing her tight so he could convince himself that she was still alive, and that his hands hadn\u2019t torn into her. Laura spilled some coffee into her fingers.\n\u201cPeter, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He couldn\u2019t say, he didn\u2019t dare say. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re scaring me\u2014\u201d\nScreeching tires cut her off, and Stiles was tearing down the road, leaving the smell of burning rubber behind him. \n::::\nMost people would take a glance at Beacon Hills and would write it off as a rural, idyllic town that belonged on nostalgic postcards. Sheriff Stilinski would be the first to point out that every town had its secrets, the underbelly that no one wanted to see or speak off\u2014dark corners full of syringes, overdoses, hit-and-runs, and domestic violence. It didn\u2019t bother him on most days, but he had his moments when he couldn\u2019t move because the terror was too suffocating, all the dark things no one acknowledged closing in. \nWhen Stiles would want him to kiss a scrape better, or when he\u2019d smile with a gap in his teeth\u2014John would hug his son closer, almost too tight. \nThe night of the fire sent a chill through him as he watched Kate scream at them to let her go, \u201cLet me finish them,\u201d and even the hottest shower couldn\u2019t bring warmth back to his skin. \nThe same chill came over him when the Good Samaritan took off, abandoning Peter and Laura. The Sheriff fumbled before he switched his cruiser into gear and gave chase, flicking on his lights as he struggled to close the distance between the young man and his car. John saw that the boy seemed to be after another car, an SUV\u2014and before the Sheriff could change gears, the Samaritan slammed his car into the SUV. \nJohn\u2019s foot left the gas\u2014startled, and someone leaned out of the passenger window. He had time to see a flash of blonde hair as the thought Kate flickered across his brain\u2014and she shot out his tires, sending his cruiser careening off the road. The airbags deployed, burning and bruising his face as he reached for his radio. \n\u201cI need backup and paramedics on Spring Valley road, about a mile north of the main street intersection!\u201d \nScreams of twisted metal made John drop his walkie, and a loud crash followed, the kind of crash that thudded deep in his chest. John threw open the door, stumbling as he ran down the road. \n::::\nThe tremors started again, as soon as Peter slammed the door and Stiles turned to see what was making Rumbles uneasy. At the intersection in a sleek SUV, were Gerard and Kate Argent. \nMusic didn\u2019t swell and everything didn\u2019t go red while Kill Bill sirens wailed in Stiles\u2019s ears. He watched as Kate spread out a map and laughed, her nails tapping the dash as she waited for the light to turn green. The tremors in his body increased and he felt one of a thousand hands close on the back of his neck. It was warm, too smooth and too dry, and a pulse of heat spread through Stiles\u2019s skin. \nThis is it. Rumbles didn\u2019t speak to him, if It did, Stiles\u2019s ears would have collapsed and Peter would have come back to find Stiles\u2019s liquefied body. But if Stiles happened to let certain words float to the front of his mind in a correct sequence\u2026 that was probably safe. If she gets free then all your travels have been for nothing.\nStiles threw the car into drive just as the light turned green. \nThe shaking got deeper, rattling Stiles\u2019s bones as he ignored his father following him and focused on Kate. He jerked the wheel, slamming into the passenger\u2019s side\u2014Kate\u2019s side\u2014and as he regained control of the car she shot behind him\u2014at his father. Time didn\u2019t\u2019 slow and an aria didn\u2019t glide across the wind as Stiles yanked the wheel over for a final time\u2014an ugly roar tearing from his throat as he pushed them both off the road. \nGlass shattered and the world went upside down. Airbags burst forward and Stiles knew he must have blacked out because he came to hanging upside down with blood dripping from his nose. \nHe crawled out of the window, leaves and dirt sticking to his fingers as he rolled up his sleeves. The sky was grey; the light sharper than a knife as Stiles\u2019s eyes struggled to focus. They\u2019d gone off road, into the woods, and Kate\u2019s SUV had wrapped around a tree. \nStiles limped to the car, adrenalin blocking out the pain as he peered into the driver\u2019s side. Gerard\u2019s eyes were closed and when Stiles pressed his fingers to the old man\u2019s neck he felt nothing. \n\u201cTurn around.\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t jump at Kate\u2019s voice and when he turned she had a glock aimed at his chest, her lipstick unfairly perfect. Stiles let his anger bleed through or else he\u2019d get tired, or else the tremors would shake him to pieces. She clicked her tongue at him. \u201cOoh, what\u2019s that face for, sweetheart?\u201d \nHaving Kate so close was something Stiles could never have prepared himself for. Her dead eyes and pretty blonde hair had an aura of wrong-no-stop that made his skin crawl. \n\u201cNone of your business.\u201d \nShe grinned with bloodstained teeth. \n\u201cWhen someone tries to kill me it is my business.\u201d \nIt was a classic western standoff except Stiles had no gun and if he blinked his vision would go fuzzy. Movement at the road caught both of their eyes and Stiles saw his father breathing heavily, his eyes wide and his gun in his hand\u2014\nKate was behind Stiles and her grip was hard on his arm, the metal hot against Stiles\u2019s temple. \n\u201cDon\u2019t move, Sheriff.\u201d Kate\u2019s voice bounced cheerfully like she was a kindergarten teacher and not a murderous psychopath. \u201cOr this sweet thing will never live to pop his cheery.\u201d Stiles jerked as her tongue dragged up his cheek. \u201cOr is it just the opposite\u2014are you fucking one of them?\u201d\nHer voice wavered and she knew there was nowhere to run. The Sheriff would have called for backup and she couldn\u2019t outrun the entire Beacon Hills police force. He saw the whites of her eyes gain a dangerous sheen because she\u2019d failed. Stiles spit blood onto her face and it was worth the metal smashed against his teeth before she pressed the gun into his collarbone, her breath hot against his skin.\nStiles saw a shadow move behind his dad, but he couldn\u2019t tell if it was a trick of the light\u2026 or if Peter was actually standing next to his father. The tremors stopped all at once bringing a blissful stillness and clarity to Stiles\u2019s mind. \nHe folded his blood-sticky hands over Kate\u2019s and pressed the gun harder against his flesh, savoring how he could hear her heartbeat jump against his back. \nFaraway, someone shouted his name, desperate and cracked, and people were running as Stiles kept bleeding. It felt familiar, like if he closed his eyes, he\u2019d be back in the field with Lydia and Peter. He blinked and he was still in 2005, blood dripping into his eyes and a possible broken tooth floating around his mouth. \nKate screamed when Stiles pulled the trigger. \n::::\nBrushing with death didn\u2019t bring Stiles any grander understanding of the world or spiritual epiphanies. All he got was a concussion and the taste of blood in his mouth. His eyelids seemed to want to stick together and Stiles grimaced at the fluorescent hospital lights. A clock ticked on the wall. The windows were ink black. Stiles looked down to see he\u2019d been stripped of his hoodie and jeans and his right wrist\u2014\nPeter was hunched over on a chair, Stiles\u2019s wrist held tightly in his grasp, each breath tickling over the scar his teeth put there in the alternative future Stiles had just erased. Peter\u2019s breathing was deep and even, but Stiles could see the circles under his eyes, the wrinkled and unwashed state of his clothes. He looked almost as bad as Stiles felt when he slipped his hand free. \nHis legs shook as he tugged on his jeans, his hoodie must have been too ruined to salvage. \nPeter never stirred, his exhaustion stingingly clear. He still wore his wedding band. Stiles poked his head out of the door, relieved to find that most of the lights were off. He darted into another room and grabbed a carton of orange juice, hoping the glucose would give him a needed boost. \nThe gentle electronic hum of the lights and vending machines followed him as he made it to the stairwell, easing himself down three flights of stairs. Sweat gathered on his palms, making him slip on the railing. He was winded by the time he got to the alleyway exit and he rubbed his legs, trying not to think about how long he\u2019d been out.\nOutside was tranquil, like early morning fog drifting over a lake. In the quiet of the late night or early morning, Stiles saw himself somewhere east, tucked away from the city. The first thing Stiles was going to do, once he was far away, was take a long hot bath. \nHe took a moment to lean against the cold brick wall, his skin throbbing under the bandages. If he moved fast he could break into a pharmacy and get some alcohol and gauze, more OJ, and maybe some advil\u2014\nThe door slammed open and Stiles flailed around, white spots blurring his vision because ow, everything hurt. His back hit the bricks and he was pretty sure a few of his wounds were reopened. \nPeter stood in the doorway, eyes shining bright Beta blue. His chest leaved like he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. \n\u201cPlease.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was a hollow whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave when you\u2019re not fully healed.\u201d\nThe warm concern in his voice was like a siren\u2019s song. Stiles swallowed, too tired to run anymore. He nodded and Peter was by his side, wrapping him up in a warm hug that made Stiles moan. He missed this so much it made his hands ache every morning. They swayed in the alleyway, Stiles\u2019s mouth pressed against Peter\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cYou\u2019re married.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d He snarled and Stiles could feel Peter\u2019s long teeth against his cheek. Peter took a deep breath, his hands trailing down Stiles\u2019s back until they stopped on his side. \u201cJust\u2026 please don\u2019t run away the first chance you get.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles felt like he was finally being honest. He sniffed, totally not crying into Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOkay, Peter.\u201d \nThey had a few hours of peace before the Pack showed up. Laura immediately punched Stiles\u2019s bad shoulder, making him shout. \n\u201cOw, Laura\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSorry. No, not sorry, Stiles, you shot yourself!\u201d Cora whimpered and Derek hugged her close. Laura shook Stiles\u2019s other shoulder, his teeth clacking together. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d\nStiles shrugged, wincing because even that simple action hurt. \n\u201cI saw it in a movie.\u201d Stiles smirked. \u201cOne that hasn\u2019t come out yet.\u201d That earned him another punch. \u201cIt worked, right?\u201d \n\u201cIt did.\u201d Talia spoke in a low, raspy timber. \u201cIt worked.\u201d\nBefore she could say more there was a loud clatter in the hallway and the Argents were squeezing their way into the room loaded with a patronizing amount of balloons. When one sun-shaped balloon bounced off Talia\u2019s head, Stiles knew they mostly got him so many presents for the annoyance factor. Stiles could respect that. \nAllison climbed onto the bed holding a crayon drawing of Stiles surrounded by his star-shaped pancakes. \n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m declaring a hugging party is officially in session.\u201d Stiles held Allison while leaning to peer out of the door. \u201cLet me guess, Naomi, you\u2019re right outside.\u201d The werewolf in question guilty poked her head in. Stiles waved her in. \u201cBring it in.\u201d \nIt wasn\u2019t easy hugging nine people at once, but Stiles thought he did a decent job.\n::::\nIn 2015 Stiles laid broken and bruised on a hospital bed, stinking of blood and anesthesia. Lydia sat with her chair against the door while Peter kept draining the pain away. Stiles\u2019s heartbeat was getting stronger, edging away from the soft whisper it had been for the first few hours. When he opened his eyes Peter didn\u2019t offer condolences for the loss of his friends and father. He didn\u2019t say that Stiles should be glad to be alive, that they had to keep moving forward. \nHe offered to be Stiles\u2019s mate. He saw Lydia stiffen, her heartbeat picking up as Stiles snorted. Peter calmly explained that it would make them both stronger, improve reflexes and their immune system. \n\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles said after Peter purposely didn\u2019t mention just how important it was to find a mate, how rare\u2014how Peter had been more at ease with himself for the first time in his life because of Stiles. Lydia crossed her arms tightly over her chest as Stiles winked at Peter despite his black eye and chipped tooth. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nThen Stiles stood under the moon and that time was erased. \nPeter held the door open for Stiles in 2005, dressed in a dark v-neck that made Stiles stare at his neck. Naomi had picked it out with a wink and a shove when Peter glared at his reflection.\nSmiling had never been so easy. And Peter found that making Stiles laugh was an intense high. \nHe\u2019d stood beside the Sheriff, up on the road, and when Stiles pulled the trigger Peter realized he didn\u2019t need to believe in love to experience it. He\u2019d roared Stiles\u2019s name and\u2014and for the longest time he couldn\u2019t think. He wasn\u2019t sure what had happened until Laura slapped him, hard enough to make his head turn as he blinked the red out of his eyes. The Sheriff was pale, pressing his hands over Stiles\u2019s bleeding shoulder, but his eyes were on Peter. \nLove was very, very real, and that day it had been bleeding to death on the side of the road. \n\u201cHey.\u201d Stiles slapped Peter\u2019s arm, his smile bright. \u201cGet your head in the game, Peter. It was worth the drive, your heart is going to melt out of your chest and puddle onto the floor.\u201d \n\u201cSounds like I should avoid this movie for my health.\u201d\nIt was easy; it was like they both knew a secret language. It should have been terrifying, but instead Peter was giddy (not that he\u2019d ever use that word in conjuncture with himself aloud). Stiles rolled his eyes. \n\u201cDon\u2019t even try it. You\u2019re going to be worshipping me after this, you\u2019re going to cry, you\u2019re going to sweep any Oscars bets, oh man, I never got to see this in theaters and\u2014\u201d\nStiles made a noise of excitement, a few people glancing toward him with questioning gazes. It was a small indie theater, two hours out of the way, and Stiles had screamed when he saw the title of the movie in the paper. \nHe\u2019d filled out, no longer shedding weight due to stress and fear. He didn\u2019t bite his fingernails and the dark circles under his eyes were finally beginning to fade. The seats were too small and the floor was sticky. There were maybe a handful of others there, but once the strangely bouncy music that had a hint of sadness to it that played over clips of clips of beauty pageants\u2026 Peter forgot all about complaining. \nAn hour and a half later and they\u2019re back on the road, the windows rolled down and Stiles\u2019s eyes shining in the dark. \n\u201cSpoiler alert, Arkin wins best supporting actor.\u201d Stiles stuck his hand out of the window. Peter did his best not to stare at how long Stiles\u2019s fingers stretched in the moonlight. \u201cI don\u2019t remember when Pan\u2019s Labyrinth comes out, but I know it\u2019s this year\u2026 and I need to see that in theaters.\u201d \nGetting a divorce had been easy. \nTalia and Stiles took the most convincing, Talia worried about the Pack, and Stiles worried about Naomi. When Stiles had blurted out, \u201cIt was just\u2014Peter mated with me out of convenience, trust me, he wasn\u2019t starry-eyed romantic about it,\u201d Peter wanted to meet his alternate-future self and tear his throat out. Naomi had gone quiet and pale, and even Talia\u2019s eyes were red. Stiles had turned to Peter, his eyes wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nA quiet lull stretched between them. Stiles still smelled like vanilla coke and popcorn. They passed the sign that said: You are now entering Beacon Hills when Stiles cleared his throat. \n\u201cSo\u2026 mating is more than just improving reflexes and immune systems, huh?\u201d\nPeter ground his teeth. \n\u201cYes.\u201d He knew his eyes were bright blue, his fangs dropping past his lips before he took a breath to regain his composure. \u201cThose are just scratching the surface. It\u2019s finding an anchor, a center, someone who puts you at a perfect balance. It\u2019s not common\u2026 actually, it\u2019s exceedingly rare, but once it happens it\u2026\u201d\nA subtle realization that the boy\u2019s smell never felt unknown, how he could always pick up his heartbeat, how smiling never seemed so easy, how trust never came quicker\u2014\n\u201cAh.\u201d Stiles smiled in the dark as they pulled into the driveway. \u201cIt\u2019s a know-it-when-I-see-it thing?\u201d \nPeter blew out a long breath. \n\u201cYes.\u201d \nThe sound of their feet crunching on the gravel was strangely intimate, their breath puffing out in front of them. The stars shone brightly in the night sky and Stiles leaned against the door. \n\u201cThanks for the movie.\u201d He tilted his head up. \u201cI\u2019m still getting a feel for your taste, that way the next one will be perfect\u2014\u201d\nPeter kissed him. He felt the boy\u2019s lips quirk in surprise and Peter pulled back a bit. \n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d\nStiles nodded and he pulled Peter back in for a kiss, smiling. Previously, Peter hadn\u2019t been a fan of kissing unless it was a mere dalliance before a nice fuck. But now, just the soft press of his lips against Stiles\u2019s\u2026 he could get lost in it. Each lingering touch just pulled Peter back for more. \nStiles\u2019s fingers wove through Peter\u2019s hair just as his tongue ran along Peter\u2019s lower lip. Peter shivered; he parted his lips and pressed Stiles against the door, needing to feel him. Stiles groaned, pulling Peter\u2019s hair so he could mouth sloppy kisses along Peter\u2019s jaw.\nPeter\u2019s hands were trembling on Stiles\u2019s hips, but he could handle it, he could savor it\u2014\nThen Stiles stretched up on the tips of his toes so he could close his teeth gently on Peter\u2019s earlobe. \nThere was a loud crack and suddenly they were both falling. \nStiles\u2019s cackling had Peter\u2019s family coming down the stairs, Laura rubbing her eyes and squinting.\n\u201cPeter\u2026 did you break our door?\u201d\n::::\nJohn Stilinski sat on his bed, holding his wife\u2019s old jewelry box in his hands. If he closed his eyes he could still smell the last traces of her perfume, and it made his throat tighten as he opened the box. Inside were envelopes, all kinds of letters she wrote for Stiles, for days she wouldn\u2019t be there. His first school dance, his twenty first birthday\u2014his engagement and the day he got married. \nJohn ran his calloused fingers over the unsealed envelopes, remembering how Claudia had kissed his cheek as she gave him those letters with shaking hands. \nHe also remembered chasing after the Good Samaritan, and how Peter and Laura Hale were magically by his side\u2014and how when the Samaritan shot through his own body to get to Kate, how Peter had bellowed a name that chilled John to the core\u2014and that was before he got a look at his face, at his bright blue eyes and fangs. \nLaura, thankfully, had her wits about her. She kept it short. \u201cWe\u2019re werewolves. My dear uncle here is having an emotional moment.\u201d She was crying despite her words, and John\u2019s hands had been wet with the Samaritan\u2019s blood\u2014Stiles\u2019s blood. He\u2019d swallowed, pressing down hard to stop the bleeding. \u201cIs he like you?\u201d\nShe\u2019d shaken her head. John looked down, at the boy\u2019s fair face, at the moles and nose that seemed so familiar\u2026 \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something different about him, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\nHe already knew the answer. And so he gathered up his envelopes, almost a year later, and made his way up to the Hale house. He thought of Stiles\u2019s bright smile when he headed off to school that morning, and he hoped that this older Stiles could find a way to smile like that again. He was surprised to see Peter loading up the car with luggage, older-Stiles behind him. \nJohn felt a little awkward as he got out of the car, letters in his hands as Stiles paused, his brow furrowing. \n\u201cSheriff?\u201d\nSuddenly all of John\u2019s rehearsed speeches flew out of his head once he had both Peter and Stiles looking at him, both praying that he wasn\u2019t back to deliver bad news. He cleared his throat.\n\u201cGoing on vacation?\u201d \n\u201cKind of.\u201d Older-Stiles shrugged, his cheeks a bit pink. \u201cEngagement present. Peter\u2019s a big fat romantic.\u201d \nPeter Hale rolled his eyes, tossing a final bag into the car. John wanted to hug his son, he wanted to tell him he was proud of the man he\u2019d become, that he was glad he wasn\u2019t so alone anymore\u2014that his mother would have been so ecstatic to see just how Stiles had grown. \nHe wanted to ask Stiles about the time he\u2019d come from\u2026 because after confronting the fact that werewolves existed, time traveling didn\u2019t seem unbelievable. \n\u201cSheriff?\u201d Peter said it that time, the wrinkles around his eyes becoming more pronounced. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d John cleared his throat because his voice cracked, and he nodded. \u201cYes, I just thought I\u2019d, uh, check up and see how things are going. It can wait. Until after your trip.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the envelopes and he smiled at Stiles. \u201cYou look\u2026 more settled. I\u2019m glad the Hales have been looking out for you.\u201d Stiles\u2019s eyes began to get a bit of a shine to them and Peter looked like he knew that John wasn\u2019t telling them the whole story. Before Peter could open his mouth, John plowed forward. \u201cHave a nice trip. I\u2019ll be around when you get back. Oh, and congratulations on the engagement.\u201d \nJohn waited until he was home to let his breathing hitch as he gently put the letters on his desk. He heard the front door open. \n\n\u201cDad?\u201d\n\nJohn wiped his eyes, running his hands down his face a few times before he spoke.\n\u201cUpstairs, kiddo.\u201d\nEager footsteps thudded up the stairs and soon Stiles was a very real ten-year-old boy who threw himself into his father\u2019s arms. John held him tight, his eyes drifting shut as he thought:\n\nOur boy turned out just fine.\n"
