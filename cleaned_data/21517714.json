    "text": "\nA/N: Here we are again, friends! I\u2019m super excited (and nervous) to share this fic with you! It\u2019s written in its entirety just working on edits. You can expect updates a few times a week until it\u2019s complete!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nTHE TROUBLESOME THING ABOUT TIME\n\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nDropping her quill, and earning a few unwelcome ink splats, Hermione cradled her throbbing wrist, flexing it as she sat back in her chair. Her body ached, and no amount of pain potions or hot baths could soothe the unending weariness that had settled deep in her bones.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs she watched the bustle of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, she couldn\u2019t help but think that at some point in her life, she might have veered left, when she was meant to go right. She was Hermione bloody Granger for crying out loud, destined for great things from a young age, ready to set the world ablaze with her brilliance; yet here she sat with a cramp in her wrist and a scowl on her face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWotcher, Hermione,\u201d Harry beamed, his hair tousled and his glasses crooked as he lurked outside her cube.\n\u00a0\nShe couldn\u2019t help but bristle, sitting up straight in her chair and pinning him with a pointed stare. \u201cHarry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s your morning?\u201d His insatiable grin was impossible to ignore and Hermione let out a long breath as she turned her attention to her friend.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerfectly mundane, as per usual. And you? You seem rather\u2026\u201d Hermione\u2019s brow puckered as she studied him. \u201c Breathless.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cHah! We just got done doing a major raid down in South London. Found crates of Dragon Eggs tucked into some seedy little shop in the Muggle part of town. It was wild. Turned out to be an all-out wand fight by the end and there are now a handful of sleazy criminals in holding cells and a dozen dragon eggs on their way to Romania.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJealousy twisted in Hermione\u2019s stomach as she forced a tight smile over her features. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, Harry.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not that she wasn\u2019t happy for him\u2014no, that wasn\u2019t the case at all. After all, they\u2019d been through during the war, she just hadn\u2019t thought it was in her best interest to sign up for a life of catching the bad guys. She\u2019d already done her share, after all. And so she took the path less traveled, she\u2019d joined the DLME as a Special Case Investigator.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was a very fancy way of saying that she did research.  A lot  of research. It came with certain perks: access to the Ministry Archives and her nights and weekends free. But it lacked a certain level of excitement that now, after four years, she could admit she missed about her youth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPotter!\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice interrupted the moment as he strode up to her cube in all his smug indifference, tossing a Gryffindor scarf at Harry\u2019s head. \u201cYou forgot this on my desk. Next time, I\u2019m changing it to the proper colours and charming it stuck to your thick neck.  Granger ,\u201d he crooned wickedly, leaning his bum on the edge of her desk. \u201cYou\u2019re looking positively\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d Hermione warned, poking her wand into his hip to rid him from her space. \u201cDon\u2019t you have more important things to do?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy snorted, turning to rest one hand on her parchments and the other on the back of her chair. Caging her in, he leered down at her, his lips tugging up in a familiar smug smirk. \u201cMore important than riling you up on a Monday afternoon? Never.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBeing the daughter of dentists, she could appreciate the way his pristine white teeth gleamed beneath his smirk, but she still desperately wanted to clip his perfectly chiseled jaw with her fist. In the spirit of moving on, however\u2014and in the interest of not being fired\u2014she refrained.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you love to irritate me so?\u201d she purred, poking him again with the tip of her wand, this time sending a small jolt of magic into his leg. He yelped, backing away from her with a pointed glare.\n\u00a0\nLaughter boomed past Harry\u2019s lips as he clamped a hand on Malfoy\u2019s shoulder and tugged him away. \u201cLet\u2019s go, partner. We\u2019ve got a shite ton of reports to fill out before Robards has our arses.\u201d After a few steps, Harry turned, delight still etched in his features. \u201cDinner, Hermione?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly if that twit you call a partner isn\u2019t coming!\u201d she called back absently, waving a hand at them as they retreated to the Auror Department.\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nEyeing the cramped booth at the back of the Leaky, Hermione wished she could say she was surprised to see the blond sitting next to her brunette best friend.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you came. So glad you could make it\u2026 again.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cLooking good, Granger.\u201d A smooth, familiar voice drawled from behind her and she jumped as Theo Nott swatted her playfully on the bum. Sending her his most charming smile, he slid in next to Harry, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek as his hand came down to rest on her friend\u2019s thigh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Theo.\u201d Hermione fell into the seat next to Malfoy, grumbling under her breath as the blond turned towards her, a wicked grin forming on his face as one arm stretched out behind her. \u201c Malfoy .\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss me, love?\u201d Hermione\u2019s rolled her tilted her head at the wizard to her right, finding his handsome face all too close for her liking. He was a prat, sure, but a handsome prat nonetheless, and being in such close proximity was dangerous for her well-being. His tongue darted out to wet his bottom lip, before he trapped it between his teeth, letting his gaze rove lazily over her features.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible and why I tolerate you remains to be seen.\u201d Hermione reached to grab a menu, her shoulder brushing his chest as he scooted infinitesimally closer to her, his palm finding her thigh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReturning to her upright position, now with Malfoy nearly sitting on her lap, she unfolded the menu. \u201cDraco Malfoy, so help me, if you do not remove your hand from my leg, I will remove the bones from it myself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMalfoy barked out a wild laugh and extricated himself from her space. \u201cOh, I just love it when you\u2019re feisty, Granger.\u201d Draining the last of his firewhisky, he lifted a finger towards the barkeep, motioning for another for the table. \u201cFirst round\u2019s on me, boys.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGroaning, she buried her face in the pages of the menu she\u2019d memorized years ago. Merlin save her from Draco Malfoy.\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHermione yawned, stretching her arms high above her head as she shimmied the sleep from her bones. It had been foolish to stay out so late on a weeknight, but she\u2019d found that being in the presence of the unadulterated, sickening, sweet love of NottPott\u2014as she\u2019d so cleverly dubbed them\u2014with a strong side of Malfoy required alcohol. And once she'd started, it had been far too difficult to stop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOver the years, she\u2019d found that he was far more tolerable after the sated buzz of alcohol clouded her inhibitions. He was almost\u2026 funny, in a dry, careless kind of way that she was only fond of after at least two firewhiskys. There had even been one incident\u2014after an almost illegal amount of alcohol on her twenty-first birthday\u2014when she\u2019d found herself pressed up against a wall in the Leaky Cauldron on the way back from the loo with Draco Malfoy\u2019s tongue in her mouth.\n\u00a0\nShe'd forgotten most of that night, truth be told, but one didn\u2019t forget a kiss like that. The memory of his rough, almost desperate touch as his hands roamed her body, gripping the flesh of her arse as he pressed his knee between her thighs and crushed his lips to hers, lingered in the back of her mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger!\u201d a booming voice commanded, breaking her reverie.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione blinked, drawing herself from the sordid memory and swiveling towards her department head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Sir?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was greeted by the top of Peterson\u2019s shiny, bald head as he shuffled through a stack of parchments, offering her the smallest semblance of attention. \u201cSanders is requesting you down in the D.o.M\u2014 stat .\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSanders? D.o.\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeterson sighed, finally sparing her a glance over his handful of files. \u201cCicely Sanders? She\u2019s the department head for the Unsp\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakables, I know,\u201d she interrupted, rising to her feet with a knitted brow. \u201cBut why on earth would they want to speak to me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a long, exaggerated sigh, Peterson returned his attention to his paperwork. \u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t understand the general idea behind Unspeakables, Granger, but they tend to keep their cards fairly close to the vest. In other words, she didn\u2019t tell me jack shite.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeterson walked on, dropping a few files on her colleague's desk as he made his way back into his office, and Hermione couldn\u2019t help but gawk. She couldn\u2019t think of a single reason for the Department of Mysteries to seek her out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHer heels clacked across the black marble leading to the entrance of the Department of Mysteries. Torches lined the walls, flickering in a bluish tint as she approached the looming door at the end of the long hall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFlashes of memories from the night she\u2019d spent here fifth year seared behind her lids, and the phantom pain of a curse long since healed seared her side. The thrumming of her heart was nearing a frantic level, and she could feel her palms slicken as she nervously wrung them together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a small part of her that wondered if the D.o.M had heard of her and wanted to offer her a job. Although, that seemed unlikely considering her resume consisted of little more than an impressive list of educational credentials and accolades followed by a few years of sitting behind a research desk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPausing before the grand doors, she steadied her breath and lifted her fist to rap against the handleless door, but before her knuckles could brush the surface, the doors swung open. She sucked in a startled gasp, before quickly recovering, adjusting her skirt and tilting her chin high.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a decrepit looking woman behind a tall desk, deep lines etched on her face, and age spots staining her fair skin. Her hazy glasses sat low on the bridge of her nose and she didn\u2019t even bother to look up from whatever she was so intently perusing on her desk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter several long beats of silence, Hermione\u2019s mouth fell open to introducing herself, but she was quieted by the receptionist who had chosen that exact moment to speak.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMissus Granger, I presume.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClearing her throat, Hermione gave a brisk nod. \u201cYes. I\u2019m here to see\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakable Sanders,\u201d she interrupted, her voice croaking. Hermione fought the glare that threatened to overtake her features. \u201cTake a seat. She\u2019ll be out shortly.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHuffing out an indignant little breath, she crossed the foyer and sat primly in one of the four chairs of the department proper.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe waited for what felt like close to half an hour, her annoyance devolving to ire when a door finally swung open.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnspeakable Sanders was no stranger to the Ministry. She was the face of the department, and while her work was secretive in nature, she was always seen out and about in various departments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHonestly, the witch was hard to miss. She was stunning: tall and statuesque with deep chocolate toned skin and high cheekbones. Not only was she a credit to her profession, and an absolute powerhouse in the Wizengamot, but she was also a beautiful and poised woman. Simply put: she was everything Hermione was not.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger,\u201d Unspeakable Sanders beamed, her bright smile gleaming in contrast to her ebony skin. \u201cWelcome to the Department of Mysteries. Although, rumor has it this isn\u2019t your first time.\u201d A perfectly arched brow lifted high on her forehead, paired with a conspiratorial smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakable Sanders,\u201d Hermione greeted formally, rising to shake the woman\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d she smiled, waving her long fingers flippantly through the air, \u201ccall me Cicely. Now, I bet you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019ve summoned you to the bellows of the Ministry on this fine Tuesday.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCicely turned, her robes sweeping away from her body in a grand way as she gestured for Hermione to follow along.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey stopped just before the entrance leading into the room of doors that Hermione knew waited for them just beyond and Cicely shook her head in a fluster. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve nearly forgotten. Before you can enter and be debriefed on the case we\u2019ve called you down for, I\u2019ll need you to make a solemn vow of confidentiality. We don\u2019t go so far as to make Unbreakable Vows down here, so no worries there! However, it will render you speechless should you try to reveal confidential information without proper authorization.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen it took Hermione a moment to mull it over, Cicely tacked on a quick, \u201cStandard protocol and I will have to insist that you take it as we can\u2019t really progress in this case without you, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer gaze flitted over to the looming door. While the prospect of sworn secrecy was a bit much to grasp with nothing to go on, she was desperate to know what secrets lay beyond the door. Despite her internal debate, curiosity won out in the end as she extended her wand arm to the department head, each of them wrapping their fingers around the other's forearms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione Granger, do you so solemnly swear that the details, both explicit and implied, of this case, will be treated with the utmost confidentiality?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you swear to keep any information procured from your time in the Department of Ministries private from anyone outside of the those immediately relevant to the case and those who have been given proper clearance?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you understand that this vow is a binding magical contract and severing it will result in a trial to determine guilt with possible sentencing to Azkaban?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione gulped. She  hadn\u2019t  been given that small shard of information, but in for a sickle, in for a galleon, she mused. \u201cI do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWisps of ethereal, silvery magic twined around their hands and forearms. She could feel the magic binding to her own, and, just as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished. Cicely smiled brightly back at her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Hermione. Now\u2014\u201d They entered with little fanfare as she followed Cicely inside and down the narrow hall flanked on either side by closed doors. \u201cWhat do you know about Time Magic?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA deep blush stained her cheeks and Hermione\u2019s eyes rounded. She could almost feel the weight of the time turner she\u2019d carried all those years ago on her chest. \u201cA little.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey kept up a brisk pace as the doors rotated quickly around the room, stopping in front of one with the rune for time carved into the stone. \u201cDon\u2019t be coy, Miss Granger! We know all about you dabbling with time during your third year. We also know the implications of your blatant disregard for time law regarding the outcome of not only Sirius Black but\u2026what was that bird's name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHeat licked up the sides of her throat as Hermione squeaked, \u201cBuckbeak.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, yes! That naughty little hippogriff. Well, don\u2019t fret about all that now. We can hardly hold you accountable now for the blatant disregard for time law as you were a minor. Your headmaster on the other hand\u2026\u201d With a cluck of her tongue, Cicely approached the Time Room and the door swung swiftly open.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione had been here before; although it had looked slightly different after the battle had run its course. The walls were still fixed with magical time devices of every shape and size, and the light still glittered throughout the room, entrancing her as she walked through the narrow passageway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBack in the 1800s, the Department of Mysteries studied Time Travel for upwards of nine years. During that time, one Unspeakable, Eloise Mintumble, caused a chain of catastrophic events. Have you heard of her?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione nodded absently, her gaze transfixed on a glowing jar near the far side of the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, Eloise Mintumble traveled back in time to the 1400s. She was trapped there for no less than  five  days, and when she returned, her body rapidly aged in the process. Dozens of her ancestors ceased to exist, simply vanishing and become unborn. The entire thing was a mess and the statutes of time laws have been heavily guarded ever since.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCicely paused, allowing Hermione due time to take in the grandeur of the room. \u201cWe still study magical artifacts and how time affects magical beings and the like\u2014but the use of time travel has been banned from even this department. We\u2019ve no idea what implications something as small as a sneeze in the past or future could have on the present.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA door appeared, tucked in the side of the room and opened without preamble. Cicely\u2019s cool touch rested on Hermione\u2019s arm, garnering her attention as she smiled kindly and gestured for her to enter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is all terribly fascinating,\u201d Hermione said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ve just no idea what any of this has to do with me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next room was far colder, lined with a giant trench similar to the one in the Death Chamber that Hermione had seen some years prior. In the middle loomed a giant, crude archway, golden magic dusting down towards the stone floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat on Morgana\u2019s green earth  is  that?\u201d Hermione blanched, stepping forward as the pull of magic thrummed in the air all around them. The magic was old and powerful, running deep into the walls and floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis,\u201d she paused, letting out a long breath, \u201cis a Tempus Motus. In layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s how Unspeakable Mintumble was able to travel through time. There are a few portals throughout the world, and this one is probably the newest, built and forged under Minister Gambol in the 1400s.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Hermione\u2019s brow puckered as she struggled to make sense of the overwhelming information being laid out plainly before her. \u201cThis is how one time travels?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is.Though as I said, the use of it has been banned for centuries.\u201d Cicely\u2019s tone turned serious as she gestured towards the other door in the room. Hermione had a hard time tearing her gaze from the grand archway but begrudgingly followed her guide. \u201cWhich is why you can imagine our surprise when yesterday afternoon this man fell through.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione turned, shifting her attention to the final room. It was by far the least exciting of them all: devoid of much furniture or any of the interesting accouterments the other rooms had boasted. Instead, it held two simple metal chairs and a single large window in a nondescript holding room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInside sat the same prat from the night before, his hands laid plainly on the table, and Hermione huffed out an annoyed breath. \u201cThat\u2019s Draco Malfoy. He works in the Auror Department. He probably snuck his way in here and poked around the wrong room\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCicely rounded on her, her eyes flashing as she studied Hermione\u2019s face. \u201cImpossible\u2014Auror Malfoy wouldn\u2019t be able to sneak into these rooms.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Hermione challenged, her head canting to the side as the excitement in her belly extinguished. \u201cAnd we did it as kids. Draco Malfoy can get into all sorts of trouble if left unattended.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut then\u2026she\u2019d been with Malfoy last night at the pub. So, unless he\u2019d somehow stumbled in here drunk off his arse, someone had their story wrong.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake a closer look, Hermione.\u201d Cecily stepped aside as Hermione approached the charmed glass.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was no doubt he was Draco Malfoy; that much was painfully obvious. But, upon closer inspection, however, she noticed a few subtle differences. His hair was a little longer, pushed back instead of cropped tight. Rather than the clean shave he sported just the night before, a thin layer of stubble peppered his jaw. Creased around the same silver eyes, she saw wrinkles that she had never noticed before\u2014that hadn\u2019t  existed  before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou mean to tell me, thatDraco Malfoy fell through this  Tempus Motus  last night from...  when exactly? The future?\u201d Hermione quipped haughtily, disbelief coloring her tone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd how does this all affect me? I may have dabbled in it, but I\u2019ve never really studied time travel or anything of the sort.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCecily\u2019s gaze darkened and she reached for the door into the holding cell. \u201cAuror Malfoy won\u2019t speak to anyone but you. He\u2019s insisted upon it, actually. He\u2019s agreed to comply with the laws to the best of his ability, and cooperate with our investigation into how and why he\u2019s here, as well as how to get him back\u2014but not before he speaks with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s head whipped back to study the man through the glass once more. \u201cHe asked for  me?  Did he say why?\u201d\n\u00a0\nUnspeakable Sanders straightened her spine, and tucked her chin into her chest, peering up at Hermione with a serious stare. \u201cHead on in, Miss Granger. Everything said in this chamber is recorded so no need for notes. Just see what he needs from you so we can continue our investigation.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe door slid open and Hermione sucked in a harsh breath before stepping over the threshold. Her arms crossed tersely across her chest. When he lifted his head, he didn\u2019t miss the sagging of his shoulders, nor the relief that flooded his features.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank, Merlin. There you are!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer brow puckered as she crossed the room; up close, the discrepancies in his age were far more prominent. Some of his hair was no longer the blond of his youth, but shimmered in a silvery-white near his temples. There was a nasty scar across the side of his neck that disappeared into his collar. The most arresting discrepancy of all, however, sat proudly on the third finger of his left hand\u2014a wedding band.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Malfoy ?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are you, love? Surprised to see me?\u201d His lips quirked up in that familiar smirk she knew all too well and his brows lifted as he reached towards her. With a start, she flinched away from the friendly gesture and stared at him seriously. \u201c Ah , I was worried about this. Say, what\u2019s the date?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the twelfth of September, 2003. Where are you from?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy\u2019s grin widened and he carded a hand through his silvery strands. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean  when , love?\u201d Her brow pinched and he chuckled under his breath. \u201c2023.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAn incredulous little noise burst past her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You\u2019re from twenty years in the future?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what on earth do you want with me? I have work I could be doing, you know. How is it twenty years later and you\u2019re still going out of your way to infuriate me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMalfoy\u2019s chin dropped to his chest and he laughed mirthlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re always saying shite like that, you know? The last time you were so cross with me, was because I\u2019d forgotten to feed the cat. You actually accused me of starving him just to annoy you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione pulse thundered deep within her ears and she felt the blood slowly drain from her cheeks. \u201cCat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, you insisted on adopting the ratty little thing and I was powerless to stop you.\u201d Malfoy peeked up through his long lashes, a lopsided smile pulling at the corner of his mouth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco Malfoy, speak plainly this instant,\u201d she breathed, her hands coming down to brace herself on the back of the metal chair opposite him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere I\u2019m from, you\u2019re Hermione Granger-Malfoy and have been for nearly two decades.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKnees buckling, Hermione steadied herself on the chair as she sucked in short, desperate breaths.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c I\u2019m your husband, Hermione. \u201d\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\nA/N: Hope you enjoyed this first installment! I'll be back in a few days with another for you.\u00a0\n\n\nAlpha Love: MCal\n\n\nBeta Babe: DreamsofDramione\n\n\u00a0\n\nMake sure you're following both of their author pages! They have so much amazing work coming up and I can't waiiiit for you all to read it.\u00a0\n\n\nYour thoughts are always appreciated!\u00a0\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m your husband, Hermione.\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nThe words were plain enough, laid out simply for her to grasp and mull over; yet, it was the most ridiculous thing she\u2019d ever heard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne breath.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA chuckle bubbled past Hermione\u2019s lips, escalating into a roaring guffaw as she clutched to the stitch forming in her side and fell into her seat. After a few minutes, her laughter quieted and through her watery gaze, she found that Draco was far from amused, his jaw clenched and eyes narrowed contemptuously.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you quite done, love? This is serious.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, stop it, Malfoy!\u201d Hermione deadpanned, her laughter ceasing without warning as she rolled her eyes and drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cWhat is this? A prank? How did you get them to allow the Department of bloody Mysteries to play along\u2014or,\u201d she paused, peering over her shoulder, \u201cis the prank on them, too?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a prank, Hermione.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s skin bristled; it was such a strange sensation to hear her given name roll off his tongue as if it belonged there\u2014as if he said it every day. She gulped, her spine straightening infinitesimally. \u201cYou don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Yes , I do. And I call you things much more familiar than that, I assure you.\u201d There was a flash behind gaze and Hermione felt a blush stretch up to the tips of her ears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith an indelicate little snort, Hermione leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs as she leveled him with a pointed stare. \u201cOkay, future Draco Malfoy. How can I help you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a prodding at the front of her mind that felt unfamiliar but surprisingly gentle, and when her gaze lifted to Malfoy\u2019s, she could see the intent etched in his eyes. Her eyes fluttered for the briefest moment and she could  feel  him in the confines of her mind, brushing against her like a curious kitten, before they snapped open and his voice flooded her consciousness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Oh, stop it with your panicking. I need to get out of here and it\u2019s of the utmost importance that you help me.  Hermione raised a skeptical brow, but he continued.  You can just think. I\u2019ll hear you, love. \n\u00a0\n For starters, stop calling me that.  She shifted in her seat as her head canted to the side.  Secondly, I\u2019m not helping you with anything, Malfoy. Oh! And third, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been a legilimens this entire time. It\u2019s wholly unethical and I should report you to\u2014 \n\u00a0\n \u201c  We were traveling and I fell through a Tempus Motus in Greece. It spit me out here and I\u2019ve no idea why or how.\u201d His lips quirked up in a barely visible smirk.  Lies. Don\u2019t worry, darling. I\u2019ve got a plan, I just need you to play along. \n\u00a0\nThe door behind her opened and Cecily stepped through, leaning against the charmed glass and crossing her arms seriously over her chest. \u201cAll caught up, Miss Granger?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Showtime. At that, Draco retreated from her mind and turned to face the newcomer with a narrowed, almost accusing glare.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,  Auror  Malfoy\u2014\u201d Cecily\u2019s voice dripped with suspicion. \u201cAs you\u2019ve said, you fell through a Tempus Motus. Do you know anything about how time travel works?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNever dabbled with it.\u201d Malfoy sat back, smug indifference plain on his features. \u201cJust an ol\u2019 humdrum Auror these days.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away, there was something so bloody different about him. He was still confident, erring on the side of arrogant, but it was of a quieter sort.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs much as I do want to believe that, I\u2019ll tell you right now that one does not fall through a Tempus Motus without great intent and some pretty serious wand work. I can go into the adjacent room and walk right under it and nothing would happen. So, there are some holes in your story, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClucking his tongue, Malfoy shrugged. \u201cNot sure what to tell you,  Cecily .\u201d His tongue was laden with contempt as his mouth curled around her name. Hermione wondered if maybe they didn\u2019t know each other in the future. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s something for your Unspeakables to jump on. Don\u2019t want people stumbling through time on accident like this. In the meantime, I demand to be released into my wife\u2019s care\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione huffed and turned towards Cecily. \u201cI\u2019m not his wife.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, but love, you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRage twinged her vision, her jaw clamping shut as she forced a breath through clenched teeth. \u201cI assure you, Malfoy, I am not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Noooo,  I assure  you , Mrs. Malfoy, that you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou two are behaving like children!\u201d Cecily admonished, pushing away from the wall to rest her palms on the metal table. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t give a shite if you\u2019re married or not. Mister Malfoy, you are not being released from the Department of Mysteries under any circumstances. You are going to go back through that portal before you cause any more damage to the future timeline.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Bollocks\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione interjected. \u201cLet\u2019s say by some strange twist of fate you and I are actually meant to end up together. I know about that now and I\u2019ll be looking for things, clues. That might change the entire fabric of what happens next. You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRising to her feet, Hermione stared down at the strange version of Malfoy, her shoulders sagging as she saw defeat painted over his features. There was that prodding again, this time more insistent, and Hermione\u2019s brow puckered as Malfoy\u2019s voice filled her mind once more.  I have to be here. I need you to trust me. \n\u00a0\nIntuition flared hot in her belly and her heartbeat picked up furiously as Malfoy rubbed his palms over his face and let out an exaggerated groan.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it seems you two brilliant ladies have found me out.\u201d Reaching into his pocket he procured a small, wooden box and laid it on the table. \u201cJust so you know, in the future, you two aren\u2019t quite so chummy. And it\u2019s nothing on you, Hermione.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnxiety twisted in her chest as he lifted the lid of the small box. Neither of them paid any attention to his earlier statement as they tried to peer inside. It was\u2026a salt shaker. Hermione scoffed, a sneer pulling at her lip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cecily\u2014I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Malfoy made meaningful eye contact with Hermione, before throwing her a sly wink and brushing his fingers against the salt shaker, disappearing in a pucker of magic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith an audible huff, Hermione\u2019s jaw fell open, her eyes rounding at the now empty seat. Cecily seemed far less impressed, mumbling expletives under her breath as she waved her wand at the far wall, revealing a door which promptly burst open.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d A woman about Hermione\u2019s age with a thick accent exclaimed, entering the room with two men hot on her heels.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPinching the bridge of her nose, Cecily bared her teeth. \u201cAre you telling me you didn\u2019t pat him down? He\u2019s an illegal time traveler and Death Eater.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Reformed  Death Eater,\u201d Hermione interjected, but upon earning the curious stare of the four Unspeakables in the room, she shrank back, pulling a face. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, he was acquitted because he was acting under extreme duress and mostly as a minor.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger.\u201d Cecily\u2019s friendly disposition faded fast and her nostrils flared as she struggled to manage long even breaths. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse our team as we hunt for your\u2026 husband.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione was silenced with a dismissive wave from the lead Unspeakable. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. You may return to your day and we will most certainly be in touch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTurning for the door, Hermione\u2019s hand froze over the handle as Cicely called out to her once more, her voice tight and frigid. \u201cMiss Granger?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione hummed in response, a chill shooting down her spine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you have any contact with Auror Malfoy, I expect you to get in touch with this department  immediately.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of the gravity of this situation, and the issues that may arise if timelines are disturbed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer throat tightened and Hermione gave a stiff nod. \u201cOf course, Unspeakable Sanders. If I hear anything at all, I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe wasn\u2019t even sure if she was lying.\n\u00a0\nHermione stepped over the threshold, prepared to see the Tempus Motus yet again, but instead, she blinked into awareness on the lift. Startling at the familiar surroundings, she was completely unaware as to how she managed her way here at all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe lift gates opened\u2014to the appropriate floor, might she add\u2014and with a worried brow, Hermione made her way through the department and towards her cube. What on earth had just happened\u2014and more importantly, had she imagined the entire thing?\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019d spent enough time in the Department of Mysteries to know that there were strange and terrible magicks at work in the belly of the Ministry, but by no stretch of her imagination did she foresee finding a time-traveling Malfoy demanding her attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger,\u201d a familiar, slow drawl crooned. \u201cHow are you feeling today? Need this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione turned, ready to snap at Malfoy in her normal greeting, but he unceremoniously tossed a small vial in her direction. Her reflexes were still slow to wake, even though it was now nearing lunch, and the vial bounced off her chest and onto the floor. Baring her teeth and muttering under her breath, Hermione scooped it up and stared at it closely.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPoison?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, come now, Granger.\u201d He grinned, entering her cube and leaning casually against her desk. \u201cI\u2019m a Slytherin. If I\u2019d wanted you poisoned, I would have chosen something far more clever than this. It\u2019s Pepper Up, you twit. Feeling alright this morning? I\u2019ve never seen anyone quite so sloshed on Butterbeers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione pulled the stopper out of the vial and sniffed it a few times to be sure before downing the potion and feeling some welcome relief spread across her skull. \u201cThank you, Malfoy. That was oddly kind of you, but you know full well I was not drinking Butterbeer.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d His finger slid under her arm, poking her in the ribs and she batted wildly at him, even managing a kick in his general direction before he scooted from the cube. His bright smile gleamed at her as he retreated backward, his hands shoved in his trousers and the flutter of a flirtatious wink. \u201cYou\u2019re just so fun to mess with, Granger. Of all the things I\u2019ve outgrown, I wonder if I\u2019ll ever outgrow riling you up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can assure you,\u201d Hermione muttered under her breath, \u201cyou never do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nStretching the stiffness from her neck, Hermione rested back in her chair, noticing that the department was now mostly empty. Only a few over-zealous overachievers such as herself remained, and even they seemed to be packing up for the night.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry peeked over the edge of her cube, chin resting on his forearms as he grinned. \u201cHeading out, Hermione?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe took a final look at her desk, at all the work she had fit into the ten-hour day, and yet, nothing felt accomplished. Loosening a breath, she gave him a lopsided smile and rose to her feet. \u201cGuess so.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a flick of her wand, her desk straightened itself up the way she liked it: parchments rolled, lining up in the corner, and her inkpot refilled.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay,\u201d Harry mused, helping her with her robes and then leading her through the department, \u201cI heard you had a clandestine meeting down in the Department of Mysteries today.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, nothing around here stays quiet, does it?\u201d Hermione rolled her eyes, thinking about how utterly ridiculous this morning had been\u2014and more importantly, if there was a chance she might be seeing the future Draco Malfoy again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you say what it was about?\u201d he whispered as they slid behind a few straggling Ministry employees on the lift. \u201cMust be  something to call in the Brightest Witch of Her Age.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione groaned loudly as he nudged her with his elbow, his lips curling in a wicked grin. She wasn\u2019t even sure what idiot started using that title, or how it became so widespread, but she did know she abhorred it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer mouth fell open, ready to explain it was really nothing at all\u2026 but, nothing came. Harry stared at her as though her tongue had turned to a snake and was currently hissing in Parseltongue as she stood there gaping at him. Clamping her jaw shut, she huffed and then went to start again, but a similar phenomenon occurred as her words failed her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t,\u201d she managed, skirting around the issue as her brows knit closely together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAhhh, I have been under a similar oath, my friend.\u201d The lift stopped abruptly in the Atrium and the gate slid open, the few people filtering out towards the Floos. \u201cWe call it a Cat\u2019s-Got-Your-Tongue Oath. Annoying isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLips pursing tightly, Hermione nodded once. She\u2019d made the vow, so she shouldn\u2019t be surprised; but she found that being censored was not something she was at all fond of.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWant to come by for dinner? Theo\u2019s cooking and you know you\u2019re always welcome at ours.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA genuine smile pulled at her lips and she leaned in to kiss him sweetly on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re far too good a friend, Harry. I\u2019m exhausted though, next time?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. Night, Hermione.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNight,\u201d she breathed, watching her friend disappear through the grate. She turned, staring at the massive entrance to the grandest building in Wizarding London.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019d been a time when this was all she had dreamed of.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow, she couldn\u2019t bloody well figure out why she hadn\u2019t thought to dream up more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHermione didn\u2019t go home right away. She made her way to the Leaky and snagged an empty barstool near the end, eating supper and nursing a pint of beer as she made small talk with Hannah behind the bar.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen she could no longer put off the inevitable task of heading back to her empty flat, she made her way to the Apparition point up the road. She lived in a nice little district of London that was popular with young wizards and witches alike. There were a few places nearby that she could frequent and Diagon and Wizarding London were just a snap of magic away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething felt off about the air tonight, though, and Hermione had a distinct feeling that she was being watched. Surreptitiously, she retrieved her wand as she approached her building, burrowing under the confines of her cloak to fight off the Autumn chill.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a flash of a shadow off to her left, and as someone stepped from the darkness, Hermione whipped around, wand drawn and light pulsing from its tip as it revealed none other than Cicely Sanders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe woman\u2019s high cheekbones no longer made her look statuesque; no, in the harshness of the street light, they cast hard shadows over her face. Hermione\u2019s wand hand held strong, unwavering even as Cicely\u2019s perfectly manicured brow inched towards her hairline.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger, I\u2019ll ask you to lower your wand, please.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione breathed out a sigh of relief as two somewhat familiar Aurors flanked Unspeakable Sanders. \u201cMerlin, did you need to lurk in the shadows like that? I might\u2019ve hexed you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy apologies. We were just double-checking to make sure that Auror Malfoy wasn\u2019t accompanying you home, or spotted near your flat.\u201d The streetlight flickered overhead and Hermione couldn\u2019t help the ill-feeling that twisted in her belly. \u201cFor your protection, I assure you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d Hermione\u2019s lips folded in as she lowered her wand to her side. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, Unspeakable Sanders, but I spent the rest of the afternoon in my cube, my supervisor can attest to that. Then I was escorted out by Auror Potter and stopped at the Leaky for dinner, Hannah can corroborate that if you pop over. And now, you see, you\u2019ve found me here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI find only guilty parties feel the need to list their alibis before asked, Miss Granger.\u201d Cicely\u2019s lips pursed unpleasantly, deep wrinkles lining her mouth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I being accused of something?\u201d\n\u00a0\nCicely\u2019s stern disposition faded and she smiled falsely at Hermione. \u201cOf course not. And, even if I wanted to, I\u2019m an Unspeakable so that\u2019s unfortunately out of my jurisdiction. Would you mind if I came up to your flat for a few moments? We\u2019ve been out here a while and I fear the chill of the evening is getting to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWordlessly, Hermione cast a heating charm over the pair of them and canted her head to the side in a silent challenge. \u201cSpeak plainly, Unspeakable Sanders. It\u2019s been a long day and I\u2019m eager to get some rest.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be permitted to check your apartment for traces of Draco Malfoy. As you said, you weren\u2019t here, nor did you have contact with him, but he may have breached your wards and be lying in wait for you now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI highly doubt anyone has breached my wards, ma\u2019am. And if he is a snake in the grass up there, I\u2019ll be sure to get ahold of the authorities right away. I do thank you for your concern, and as previously stated, I will inform you if I have any contact with him.\u201d Hermione\u2019s patience was growing thin. There was not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that this woman was setting foot in her flat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have to insist\u2014\u201d Cicely began and Hermione interjected with a quiet hiss.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou forget I work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. I took the same entrance exams and passed the same practical and theoretical law standards as every Auror and Investigator in my department\u2014did better than them all, too. You\u2019ve no right to enter my property without a warrant from the Wizengamot and a hell of a lot of due cause.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCicely\u2019s dark eyes flashed, widening fractionally before narrowing in Hermione\u2019s direction. \u201cAs you wish, Miss Granger. This is Auror Haverfield and Auror Jacobs.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss,\u201d they replied in unison, bobbing their heads politely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be taking shifts over you and your home. Haverfield, you\u2019ll take first watch.\u201d Cicely vanquished the warming charm, fussing with her scarf as she turned down the sidewalk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c First watch ?\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI thought you said I wasn\u2019t being accused of anything!\u201d\n\u00a0\nCicely froze misstep, twisting at her waist to meet Hermione\u2019s disapproving glare. \u201cYou\u2019re not, Miss Granger.  Not yet.  The Aurors will be placed here for your protection and the protection of our very precarious future. Draco Malfoy is a criminal at large: Undesirable No. 1 as of this afternoon. Unfortunately, due to the nature of his crimes, we aren\u2019t able to publicly hunt him. But I assure you, I am doing everything in my power to bring him into custody before irreparable damage has been done to our timeline. I urge you to take this matter seriously and comply with the Department of Mysteries as well as the Ministry itself. Time Law is a  very  serious matter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s chest heaved, deep, enraged breaths pushing past as her lips. \u201cHave a safe evening, Unspeakable Sanders.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou as well, Miss Granger. I\u2019ll be in touch with that warrant from the Wizengamot presently.\u201d Cicely nodded, then resumed her march down the pavement, her collar tugged high over her neck and her posh wool coat snug around her trim waist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWell, that settled that. Hermione loathed Cicely Sanders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHermione paused outside her door, her wand drawn to manage the intricate unlocking charms. Her wards hadn\u2019t been breached, of that she was certain. There would have been an unmistakable tingle across her skin if someone had done anything from jimmied a window to bust her door in.\n\u00a0\nBut, that didn\u2019t stop her from being absolutely certain that the future version of Draco Malfoy was inside. Call it intuition or logical deduction, but there was no doubt left in her mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione stepped over the threshold, locking it swiftly with her wand behind her and then sweeping her hand through the air as the lights dimmed on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer eyes narrowed at the man at the end of  her  couch, drinking  her  Firewhisky and sitting in all his smug tenacity. He had  her  book laid out in his lap and  her  cat curled up next to him. Dropping her bag on the counter and shrugging from her jacket, she stood tersely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFinally, after an annoyingly long minute, Malfoy\u2019s crinkled gaze lifted to meet hers, his stubbled jaw tilting to one side. \u201cOh, darling! You\u2019re home.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\n\n\n\n\nA/N: I am speechless by the wonderful reception of this story! Thank you all so much! This was one of my Nano Projects and it makes my muse purr to know you all are so excited for the story, too!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would love to know your guys thoughts on the story so far and hope you\u2019re ready for some answers in the upcoming chapters!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlpha Love: MCal\n\n\nBeta Babe: DreamsofDramione\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, honey.  You\u2019re home .\u201d Malfoy's signature smirk seemed to stretch wider as Hermione made her way into her sitting room, taking a prim and proper seat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe levyied an arched brow at Malfoy, his smug posture setting her teeth on edge. \u201cUnspeakable Sanders was outside waiting for me; she almost came up to check the flat for you. What would you have done then?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy snorted, snapping the book on his lap shut and leaning towards her. \u201cYou forget how well I know you, Granger. There\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re letting that woman in your flat because I know you can sense she\u2019s bad news\u2014\u201d he paused, tilting his head to one side as he shrugged. \u201cWhich she is, by the way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get in here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPortkey.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s features flattened in severe disapproval. \u201cRight. And  how  did you obtain a Portkey to  my  flat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. We still live here\u2014some of the time at least.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe live in this little flat\u2026 together?\u201d \n\u00a0\nMalfoy chuckled, his eyes sparkling at her. \u201cAs married couples often do. I wanted someplace bigger and you insisted we didn\u2019t need the space.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo I won?\u201d Hermoine smiled, her brow flickering up in a challenge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe compromised. We kept the tiny, useless flat and bought a summer home in France. Although\u2014using the term \u2018home\u2019 does it injustice\u2014it\u2019s quite grand,\u201d Malfoy mused, seemingly to himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMassaging the thrumming of a soon-to-be migraine away from her temples, Hermione begged the universe for patience. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start from the beginning. And for real this time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy\u2019s features turned somber as he finished the rest of his firewhisky with a wince. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink cheap liquor in the future, a habit you should consider adopting sooner rather than later.\u201d Pausing, Malfoy dragged a tired hand over his face and settled into his seat. \u201cRight, so I\u2019m from the future.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve mentioned, Malfoy,\" she sighed, her patience quickly running thin. \"It\u2019s the rest of it I\u2019m curious about.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClearing his throat, Malfoy poured two drinks and pushed one across the table towards her. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange for me\u2014seeing you like this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoung?\u201d Hermione quipped, eyes rolling as she sipped from her tumbler.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Healthy .\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSnapping her gaze to his, Hermione swallowed the knot of anxiety that\u2019d settled in her throat. Grey eyes bored into hers; the serious set to his brow and his clenched jaw caused her to pause. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sick?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCursed, actually. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Strange timing of it all, if you ask me. There you were, about to announce your candidacy to unseat the current Minister for Magic, and then\u2014\u201d Malfoy let out a long breath, rubbing his hand over his stubbled cheek. \u201cEverything went to hell.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Minister for Magic?\u201d  Awe was heavy on her tongue as she listened in rapture.  Her?  Running for Minister for Magic?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m biased\u2014I\u2019m your husband\u2014but you\u2019re a shoo-in, love. But this curse...you\u2019re getting worse. We've no idea what you\u2019ve been hit with or how it was administered since you fell ill during dinner with Theo and Harry\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNottPott is still together?\u201d Hermione asked hopefully, leaning forward absently. Somewhere along the line, she must have begun to believe this wild narrative.\n\u00a0\nBarking a laugh, Malfoy nodded. He fussed with his wedding band, twirling it around his third finger as he stared at her; she was entranced by the simple gesture. \u201cMarried eighteen years last spring, one year longer than us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2014as in,  you and I \u2014have been married for seventeen years. And we haven\u2019t murdered each other?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMalfoy laughed again, a strange but delightful deep belly laugh she couldn\u2019t remember hearing before. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten close a few times, but we\u2019re both still kicking for the time being.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s brow furrowed and she toed off her pumps, curling her feet under like a cat as she sipped from her drink. \u201cDo we love each other? Or is this some marriage of convenience situation?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA slow grin stretched across his lips as his eyes studied her rug, spinning his ring another time. \u201cNo, we love each other\u2014very much.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeems impossible.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d His shoulders lifted in a shrug as let go of a long, drawn out breath.\n\u00a0\nThe firewhisky settled some of her nerves and she studied at him for a long minute. He was stupidly attractive now at twenty-three, but Merlin, give him another two decades and the man was stunning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere did we get married?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cA vineyard in southern France.\" His gaze flickered, lost in a memory. \"You left your curls wild the way I like and your dress was the most stunning thing you\u2019ve ever worn; it showed off the freckles on your shoulders and the little birthmark on your neck that I love so much.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnfamiliar emotions coursed within her; he spoke about her as if she were the sun, like his whole world revolved around her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do I like my tea?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSplash of milk before work; milk and a teaspoon of honey when you\u2019re at tea with friends.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFavorite book?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMuggle or magic?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMug\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Pride and Prejudice  ,\u201d he interrupted, smirking at her. \"For magic? You\u2019ll say  Hogwarts: a History  but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just the book you\u2019ve read the most. Your favorite is  Muggleborns: A Comprehensive History . I bought it for you for Christmas our first year together and you loved it so much; you still keep it in your nightstand.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe gulped, her gaze intent on him as she felt this magnetic pull between them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere did we first kiss?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother smirk. \u201cThe Leaky on your twenty-first birthday. Then it took a few years for you to give me a real chance. We kissed for the second time on our first date. I took us to the Malfoy summer home in France; we had a picnic.\u201d He paused a moment, lips curling as remembered. \u201cYou got  way  too drunk off the wine and climbed on my lap and snogged me breathless.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Malfoy!\u201d  she admonished, the tips of her ears burning hot with embarrassment.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis bright laughter chased any shame away and she found herself smiling too; she rather liked this version of Malfoy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He shrugged, chuckling to himself. \u201cI can answer just about any question you throw at me, love. You sleep on your side and you snore when you\u2019re exhausted; at Christmas you like to spend the evening curled up in my arms reading The Night Before Christmas aloud and drinking hot chocolate with a candy cane melting inside; when you\u2019re cross you call me Malfoy and like to bring up the  one time  that I got pissed drunk with the boys at their bachelor party and a girl wrote their Floo number on my arm even though everyone can attest that I did nothing inappropriate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA twist of surprising jealousy coiled hot in her belly. \u201cWell, if you got close enough to another woman that she could write something on you, then you were clearly already in the wrong.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin.\u201d Malfoy paused, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer lips betrayed her, quirking up in a small smile as she rose to her feet and set the tumbler down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d His eyes narrowed as she walked from the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to change. Then we\u2019ll figure out exactly what you need so you can get back to this strange alternate reality where we don\u2019t loathe each other.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, symptoms of the curse include weakness, pain, grogginess? Malfoy, it doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a curse\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I\u2019d know if my wife\u2019s been cursed,\u201d Malfoy deadpanned. \u201cWhen you say it like that\u2014yeah, it doesn\u2019t sound so bad. Like the Black Cat Flu or some shite, but it\u2019s not. You\u2019re not you\u2014you\u2019re gone. And I\u2019m not just gonna sit by and watch you fade away from me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis tone softened her and she tucked her legs under her as she considered what he was saying. \u201cI\u2019ll check the Ministry Archives and the Library. We\u2019ll find something.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m here in this time specifically. If memory serves me correct, my mother has just liquidated the Black family vaults. She forfeited the dark artifacts to the Ministry, sold the paintings to various museums around the world, and taken the family jewels to the Manor.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s brows knitted tightly as she listened, cradling her whisky as the clock inched towards midnight.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy grandmother, Druella Black, told me about a necklace when I was a kid. I\u2019ve seen it. It's silver with an ornate black opal the size of my fucking fist.\u201d His fingers tightened into a knot and he lifted his hand in example. \u201cIt\u2019s been in the Black heritage for centuries and it syphons the curse from the wearer, holding it until it\u2019s destroyed. Curses were a lot more popular back in the days of old magic when disputes were settled by wand fire and loved ones were often targeted.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s hand came back to massage the nape of his neck, his plain white t-shirt riding up on his bicep as he sighed. \u201cThat necklace will save you. I know it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour plan has too many variables, Malfoy. You may have seriously altered the future timeline already, I\u2019d almost guarantee it really. I might not even be cursed. Hell, we might not be married.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShaking his head, Malfoy ran his fingers through his overgrown locks and her attention caught on the silvery tendrils near his temple. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that. We\u2019ll find a way to each other. There\u2019s no other option.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione sighed. She didn\u2019t want to believe him, it\u2019d be easier not to, but he spoke with such conviction that she found herself delving deeper. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get the jewels from your mother in your timeline?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy shifted awkwardly in his seat. \u201cMother passed away some years ago, now. I took a few heirlooms, but you\u2019re not one for such ostentatious pieces. What in the fuck are you going to do with a tiara?\u201d He chuckled darkly. \u201cI took pieces for future generations and donated the rest. I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks tracking them down, but it\u2019s not yielded anything and I can\u2019t wait any longer. I'll get the necklace and travel back through the Tempus Motus .\u201d\n\u00a0\nClucking her tongue, Hermoine regarded him seriously. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how I can help.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need to get to the Manor.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Hermione snorted, giving him a pointed stare. \u201cAs stated, you and I are not exactly chummy, Malfoy. You don\u2019t invite me over for tea with your Mother or anything of the sort.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA knowing smile pulled at his cheeks as he reached between his thigh and the corner of the sofa, lifting a heavy envelope from it\u2019s home and shaking it at her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis,\u201d Malfoy paused, eyeing the elegant script inscribed on the cover, \u201cis your invitation to the Malfoy Annual Charity Gala.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to that,\u201d Hermione gaped. \u201cI assure you that invitation is for show only. Pureblood society would have kittens if I showed up on their estate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst, Mother adored you. Second, you  love  this event! It\u2019s your favorite of the year. You\u2019ve organized it the last five years.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione felt a tingle at her temples as he talked about her\u2014though, it wasn\u2019t really her at all. It was some strange version of her that existed only in his mind. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d Her lips pulled into a tight pout. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about me like you know me, and you  don\u2019t . At least not who I am right now. I don\u2019t plan fancy parties and I don\u2019t know your mother and I\u2019m not going to some stupid party to play these games of yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe couldn\u2019t listen to any more of this, jumping to her feet, she stomped towards her room. However, as always, she\u2019d underestimated Malfoy\u2019s quickness. He was off his feet and gripping her elbow before she could cross the threshold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust stop, Malfoy.\u201d Tears welled in her eyes as the onslaught of new information settled painfully in her chest. She was dying somewhere and this man loved her, loved her enough to cross decades and criminalize himself to save her life. \u201cThis has been the longest, most preposterous day of my life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, love\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Stop! Stop calling me that! You\u2019re Malfoy and I\u2019m Granger and you flirt with me just to get a rise out of me and nothing else.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a beat of silence as his fingers tightened on the tops of his arms and when she dared to sneak a glance up at him, his eyes were dark, intense, brimming with unexpected emotion. The lines near the corners of his eyes were new, etched deeper with concern.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he conceded quietly. \u201cI know this is a lot for you and I\u2019m pushing it. You hate when I push. I just\u2014I  do  know you, some version of you, at least. It\u2019s hard to sit across from you and pretend that you\u2019re not my wife.\" He paused to card a hand through his tousled hair. \"But I\u2019ll try. I just desperately need your help because the woman I\u2019ve been in love with for thirty years is dying right now. And whether or not you believe that to be you, it\u2019s someone. Please, Granger?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey were so close, close enough to feel the rise and fall of their chests meeting and pushing against each other as she stared up at him. His eyes drifted to her lips and against her own volition, her own gaze did the same. Dipping his mouth towards her, Hermione startled and jumped from his grip.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey stared at each other, a chasm now between them as she focused on her breathing. \u201cThere\u2019s a guest room over there\u2014which I guess you already know,\" Hermione said quickly. \"Get some sleep.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe turned then, disappearing into her bedroom and hiding under her covers until dreams of a life she may never have took over her consciousness.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s eyes snapped open to the sounds and smells of sizzling bacon wafting through her flat. It was impossible to tell which emotion was layered on top: rage that stranger-Malfoy had helped himself to her kitchen, or ire that, despite her best efforts, her stomach churned with hunger.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a soft growl, she threw her legs over the side of the mattress and grabbed her robe from the end of the bed. Padding from her bedroom, she stopped abruptly at the sight in her kitchen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was caught off guard by the vision of him casually standing shirtless over the stove. Different than she would\u2019ve imagined\u2014not that she\u2019d spent much time doing such things, of course not\u2014but, well he was still lean, just a little less defined... thicker,  bulkier.  A nasty scar crawled over his shoulder and up his neck, silver and puckered and almost  angry. \n\u00a0\n\u201cMorning, lo\u2014\u201d Malfoy paused mid-word, the endearment dying on his tongue. \u201c Hermione,\" he amended. \"Breakfast?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d she quipped, her tone short. \u201cShirt?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe turned, flirtatious smirk fixed perfectly on his face. Against her own volition, her gaze fluttered down to his abdomen, studying the smattering of smaller scars littered over his torso, the dusting of pale hair across his chest and under his belly button. She gulped.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"What happened to your shoulder?\" she queried, resting on the wall near the kitchen without entering it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy's face screwed to one side as he tried to peek at the marring on his skin. \"Oh! Merlin, that was a while ago now. Fight down in Knockturn turned nasty\u2014spent almost a week at St. Mungo\u2019s.\" His lips quirked in thought. \"It's when you first told me you loved me, actually. Merlin, you were so worried. You sat by my bedside the entire time, even took off work. Then one night, as I was drifting off, you whispered it like a secret you didn't want to let go of yet.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe thrumming of her heart picked up its pace, frantically beating against her ribs as she listened in strange rapture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI made you a cuppa.\u201d Twisting his wand through the air, a teacup lifted and settled on the counter between them, followed by the teapot which poured a perfectly steeped cup of coffee, milk next. \u201cYou\u2019ll be leaving for work soon, I assume? G\u2019on and get ready. I\u2019ll have some breakfast ready for you before you leave.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn exasperated huff pushed past her lips and she marched into her small kitchen with a gaping jaw. \u201cYou should get ready, too. Then you can head in with me and we\u2019ll get you back to your time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere without that necklace. So, please give up on that ridiculous notion so we can move forward with the plan. I\u2019ve already sent in your RSVP to the event this weekend. So, as far as a plan goes\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c MALFOY!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014try to secure a date with the current Draco. He\u2019ll pick you up, unless I\u2019m more of a sod than I remember, and when he arrives, we\u2019ll stun him and I\u2019ll go in his\u2014 my \u2014 place.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione was sure the blood had drained from her cheeks, her eyes wild and round as she stared at the elder Malfoy with a bewildered edge to her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking crazy, Malfoy. Get ready! You\u2019re going back\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c I\u2019m not!\u201d  Malfoy snapped, dropping the spatula on the pan with a loud clang and turning to her, his cheeks flushed pink with rage. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m not going back without that necklace. I\u2019m  not  losing you. Cecily Sanders and her dirty fucking hands are all over this. I\u2019ve been investigating her arse for years. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m marching back through that arch without knowing that both current and future versions of you are safe from her corrupt little fingers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe familiar name sobered her, and she stepped back as her brows furrowed. \u201cCecily? What does she have to do with any of this?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger\u2014\u201d Malfoy snorted, picking up his spatula and turning back for the stove. \u201cShe\u2019s the current Minister for Magic\u2014the one you\u2019re trying to unseat.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: Thank you again for all your lovely reviews, kudos, favorites and overall response to the story. You guys make my day :D\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo my American friends celebrating tomorrow, Happy Thanksgiving!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWould love to know what you think!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlpha Love: MCal\n\n\nBeta Babe: DreamsofDramione\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Cecily Sanders is the  current  Minister for Magic?\u201d Hermione supposed it seemed likely enough, manipulation appeared to ooze from the woman\u2019s pores.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Malfoy nodded, poking the sizzling bacon around the pan. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain she\u2019s been tampering with Time Law for decades, though I\u2019ve not been able to prove it just yet. And she wasn\u2019t happy when you let her know you\u2019d be running for Minister. It\u2019s all too coincidental,\u201d he said, circling his spatula in the air like a wand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that complicates things,\u201d Hermione muttered from the side of her mouth, turning back for her bedroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile dressing for the day, a plan formulated. As soon as she was able, she\u2019d quickly escape to the Ministry library. Unspeakable Sanders had mentioned something about another time traveler, Mintumble or something, but surely, there had been other, more successful exploits.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTucking her blouse into her trousers, she reached for her briefcase and reentered the main room, scanning for Malfoy but coming up short. Her heart sank, eyes blowing wide at the cup of steaming tea with milk next to crispy, almost burnt, bacon, sunny side up eggs, and a muffin. It was the exact meal she made for herself every Sunday when time leant itself to such luxuries as breakfast. And he\u2019d known it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMalfoy?\u201d There was a nervous edge to her voice as she craned her neck towards the guest room, desperate for confirmation he hadn\u2019t disappeared\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe nearly groaned in relief as he emerged, still shirtless, but with a jumper in hand and a smile on his face. \u201cYou bellowed, my dear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nUnder her breath, she mumbled a soft,  \u201cPrat,\u201d as she nicked a slice of bacon and bit into it. \u201cWhy are you getting dressed?\u201d she asked around the bacon working its way down her throat while he tugged the fabric over his head.\n\u00a0\nWith a gaping grin, his brows inched towards his forehead. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather I remain shirtless\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe moved to yank the jumper back over his shoulders, but she cried out, waving her hands wildly. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Pulling an incredulous face, she finished her bacon and reached for the muffin, ignoring the smug smirk coming from the blond still looming in her doorway. \u201cI meant only, did you decide to wise up and accompany me to the Ministry and back to your own time?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuite the opposite, darling. I need to pop into Gringotts to make sure the vaults have been properly emptied. I\u2019ll see if they have an archive of what went where, seeing as this isn\u2019t considered an actual dark artifact, it might still be in\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMalfoy!\u201d Waving her hands through the air, Hermione choked out an indignant little noise. \u201cAre you fucking mad? You can\u2019t waltz into Gringotts\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike hell, I can\u2019t! I\u2019ve got my wand. I  am Draco Malfoy after all. Those vaults are mine\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to Gringotts,. You\u2019re currently Undesirable No. 1\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c That\u2019s hippogriff shite,\u201d  Malfoy deadpanned, reaching over to pluck the muffin from her hand and slice his teeth through the crust. \u201cCicely is exaggerating. How on earth are they going to go about spreading that Draco Malfoy\u2014current Auror and partner of the Chosen One\u2014is  Undesirable No. 1?\u201d he mocked, his lips pulling into a cocky pout.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith an audible pop, her jaw unhinged, hanging uselessly as she gaped at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee, love? I\u2019m more than this roguishly handsome exterior, I keep trying to tell you.\u201d He tossed her a sly wink as he swallowed  her  muffin and turned on his heel.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a wild yelp, she scurried around the counter and planted herself between him and the door just as he reached for the handle. His lips curled into a smirk and he took a small step forward until his chest was brushing against hers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess Gringotts can wait.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA slow realization dawned on her as his tongue darted out to wet his bottom lip and his free hand curled around her hip. She snorted and swatted at his hand with a scowl. \u201cYou\u2019re married.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c To you.  And you would understand, I\u2019m quite sure of it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a withering roll of her eyes, she pressed her palms into his chest and backed him up a few paces, but he surprised her by bringing her with him, pressing her against the short stretch of wall next to the door. Before she could think of a proper protest, his knee was sliding between her thighs, and both hands were placed firmly on either side of her head as he loomed over, his breath fanning over her lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInhaling a shaky breath, her gaze lifted to his. A fevered blush bloomed on her chest, crawling up her neck as her breaths turned slow and deliberate. When he pressed farther in, the muscle of his thigh touching her where she hadn\u2019t been touched in, admittedly, far too long, she couldn\u2019t help the way she arched into it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith all the force of the Hogwarts Express, reason returned, earning a few long blinks as she cleared her throat and pressed him away again. \u201cSpeaking as the current Hermione Granger, I will tell you that, at any age, I would not approve of my husband sleeping with other women\u2014whether she is another version of me or not.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis lips pulled up in a smirk and he gave a hollow laugh as he backed away. \u201cWhatever you say, dear. Now,\u201d he paused, clapping his hands and rubbing his palms together, \u201cthere is the matter of Gringotts and, unfortunately, I must insist I go.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow many different ways can I say  no?\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHis smirk stretched into a grin and he shrugged. \u201cWell, however many it is, I can say it in at least two more ways than you. I\u2019m fluent in French  and  Spanish and you can barely work your way around a menu when we are at the country house.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA flurry of rage overtook her and she gesticulated her hands wildly through the air. \u201cEnough of that! Enough talking about future me! If what you say is true, then I will discover all your awful habits for myself when the time comes. I don\u2019t want to hear about anything else.\u201d Ignoring the obnoxious rolling of his eyes, she began again, \u201cNow, you\u2019re not leaving this flat. Give me today, alright? I have some ideas and I want to dig into the Archives. If it all proves fruitless, we will  discuss  getting you to Gringotts.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do here all day?\u201d Though the man was nearing his mid-forties, his voice took on all the whiny tones of a petulant child.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. Read, twiddle your thumbs, think of plans that don\u2019t involve me going to the Manor after stunning the current Draco Malfoy and having an imposter twenty years his senior attend in his stead?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith another roll of his grey eyes, Malfoy finally retreated into the flat, crossing the space until he was flopping down on her favorite chair. \u201cI did plan on glamouring myself, you know. I\u2019m not so stupid as to try and waltz into the Manor having gotten this much better looking.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer gaze shot to his, narrowing when it landed on his smug, lopsided little smile. \u201cI\u2019ll come home at lunch. Do you want anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a loud groan, he kicked up his heels on the coffee table and folded his hands neatly behind his neck. \u201cTurkey on rye, if you can manage it, love. Would you mind maybe popping by Diagon for an extra set of clothes for me?  Cecily ,\u201d he spoke the name contemptuously, \u201cstole my luggage.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was barely seven-thirty in the morning, and Hermione could already feel the all too familiar thrumming of a headache forming as she made her way through the Floo.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\n Squeak. Squeak. Squeeeak. \n\n\u00a0\nRocking back in forth in her flat, uncomfortable chair, Hermione couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from Malfoy\u2019s arse. It had absolutely nothing to do with enjoying the view\u2014although, one could presumably argue that she did\u2014but she was trying to figure out what size he wore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you checking out Malfoy\u2019s arse?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice in her ear startled her and she batted wildly over her shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTurning swiftly, Hermione picked up her quill and began scribbling nonsense on the report in front of her, grimacing when she realized she\u2019d now have to begin again. \u201cMorning, Harry.\u201d\u00a0 A thought dawned on her and she swiveled again, \u201cSay, what size pants do you wear?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThirty or thirty-two waist, why?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione rocked back in her chair, her eyes locking again on Malfoy\u2019s bum, as he leaned across her colleague\u2019s desk. \u201cAnd him?\u201d she asked, jerking her chin. \u201cWhat size do you think he is?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c What ? Hermione, are you daft?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe turned, eyes narrowing. \u201cAnswer the question, Potter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHis skinny arse is probably a twenty-eight.\u201d Harry scoffed, leaning on the edge of her desk, picking up a caramel candy from her dish and unwrapping it with his teeth. \u201cWhy do you suddenly care about Malfoy\u2019s waistline?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHeat rushed to her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t. I just find that I\u2019m\u2026fascinated by the discrepancies between men\u2019s and women\u2019s trousers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a loud snort, Harry popped the candy in his mouth. \u201c Right.  What are you doing for lunch?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe was making an utter fool of herself. Groaning, she rushed to her feet and piled up the parchments on her desk. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2014I need to go. I have to get the Archives and look something up for this case. I\u2019ll see you later, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer feet carried her quickly towards the lift, and as soon as the grate doors closed, she sank down into a crouch and buried her face in her knees.\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nThe weight of Auror Jacobs stare bored into the side of her cheek as she pulled another tome from the stacks and added it to the buckling pile hovering next to her. Well, if Cecily insisted on having her followed under the thinly veiled excuse of protection, said protection could watch her read. How scintillating.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQuite satisfied with the books she\u2019d collected, Hermione turned for a table in the back. Jacobs followed, standing just far enough away to give her a false sense of privacy, but close enough that it only took one-pointed stare over her shoulder to notice the reach of Cecily Sanders\u2019 power.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSurely the Head of the Department of Mysteries could not have enough clout to order twenty-four-hour protection over Hermione. There was no due cause, she was in no way a threat, nor had the suspect at large threatened her\u2014so why on earth was Cecily so paranoid?\n\u00a0\nAs she flipped through the first book,  Mishaps and Misfortunes in Time Travel: A Cautionary Tale , she found herself only idly scanning the pages. The book was more of a recollection of stories from those who had managed short jaunts, such as what she\u2019d done in her third year and their accounts of what had happened after. They amounted to little more than children\u2019s stories.\n\u00a0\nSnapping the cover shut, Hermione gently pushed it to the side to check out from the Archives. The second book was by a D.K. Rumage and was aptly titled,  The Rumage Theory of Time.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t a terribly long book and upon cracking its spine, the photos on the pages burst to life. Intricate drawings and graphs detailed his theory. Rumage, having traveled through time himself, believed that time did not only exist on a linear plane, always driving forward, but that due to the meddling of time, there were multiple simultaneous realities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nForgetting where she was entirely, Hermione toed off her pumps and curled in on herself like a cat, tucking the book into her lap.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTime, in all its troublesome complexities, does not simply exist in the reality that we are currently aware of. From the point of travel, a new ripple effect begins. The present splits into a shifted but ultimately parallel timeline.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe traveler would then return to an unaltered timeline, allowing the altered reality to continue on in its own plane.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt can be argued that the multiverse is actually infinite, as realities have now been split time and again.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThose who study the art of Divination will tell you that regardless of the journey, our souls eventually end up where they are meant to. We can not change the ultimate ending, only the means of which we arrive. Skeptics believe that each reality is its own separate and unique universe with different outcomes and consequences.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTraveling between Multi-verses is, at this time, unsustainable. Therefore, we have no way of studying this phenomenon. All we can deduce is that by messing with the timelines, we are causing massive and permanent changes to the future; whether there is only one, or infinite.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSitting back, Hermione gnawed on her lip and tried to make sense of the obscure subject and what that could mean for her. In theory, by Draco traveling back at all, he had already caused a splice in the timeline, creating a new and parallel reality. He would be attempting to then travel forward to his own time, thus exiting their reality altogether and leaving a blank slate for her own future. One where she quite possibly didn\u2019t marry Malfoy\u2014no weddings in the countryside or hot cocoa on Christmas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven thinking it made her stomach pang. She didn\u2019t know why it bothered her so much that she might lose something she never really had. Adding that book to the stack, Hermione stared at the other five and loosened a long sigh. A sense of hopelessness settled over her, it didn\u2019t matter what she read in these pages, the future had already been compromised.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nDiagon was bustling. Witches and wizards in a hurry to complete their lunchtime errands bumped into her until she was scowling and tripping into the deli, quite nearly colliding with the dingy tile until two sure hands found her waist, helping to right her stance.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWotcher, Granger.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer hurried gaze focused on the smug smirk of one, young, Draco Malfoy. Instinctively, her brows furrowed and she frowned back at him. \u201cThanks, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a strange tension hovering around her. After all, she\u2019d now seen Draco with his shirt off and knew just where the start of his blond curls began under his belly button. It felt like a strange intrusion of privacy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s your day going? Didn\u2019t see you at your desk,\u201d Malfoy said pleasantly, gesturing for her to take the place in line before him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Had he been looking for her at her desk?  \u201cI had some research to tend to in the Archives, so I\u2019ve been down there most of the morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s hand came up, resting on the back of his neck as he squinted and peered at the ceiling. \u201cYour owl arrived, by the way.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione hadn\u2019t sent any owls. \u201cOwl?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour RSVP for the party this weekend.\u201d Hermione\u2019s features flattened, making a mental note to berate the elder Malfoy for his meddling upon her return home. The line shifted forward, and they both moved along with it. \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to come for once, is all. It\u2019s such an extravagant event, and I\u2019ll admit a little pretentious, so I can see why you never have. But if you wanted, just so you aren\u2019t, you know, showing up alone or anything\u2026 well, we could always\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNEXT!\u201d the irritable clerk shouted in Hermione\u2019s face. Shooting her a fatal glare, Hermione stepped forward, ignoring the riotous nerves in her belly at the revelation that Draco Malfoy had been about to ask her to attend the party  with  him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have a chef\u2019s salad and a turkey on rye with crisps please.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMake it two turkey on ryes,\u201d Malfoy interjected, stepping forward to slip a banknote across the counter which the clerk promptly snatched up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Hermione flustered, her shoulders bristling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShrugging, Malfoy replaced his money clip inside his robes and his hand settled low on her back, ushering her to the end of the counter. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever paid for your lunch before?\u201d he snorted. \u201cCo-workers and even  friends  do it\u2014often. If I\u2019m mistaken, please do tell Potter he can stop letting me buy lunch anytime now. I\u2019ll need to pick up a second job soon.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere it was\u2014that dry humour that always made her smile, even when she didn\u2019t want to. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize we were friends is all, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis grey eyes shot up to hers and there was a split second, a breath, that felt heavy and important, before he blinked himself back into the moment and his hand fell away. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had my tongue in your mouth, Granger. Friends seems like a safe place to start.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a loud groan, she swatted at his flat tummy with the back of her hand and grabbed her paper bag off the counter. \u201cThank you for lunch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnytime Granger. And that offer extends to all sorts of meals, lunch\u2026dinner\u2026hell,\u00a0 even breakfast. \u201d He waggled his eyebrows and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh as they slid through the deli patrons and towards the front door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer eyes landed on her own private security looming outside and she cursed under her breath as she realized she still needed to somehow purchase men\u2019s clothing without raising suspicion from her ever-watchful eye. An idea bloomed and with a start, she grabbed onto Malfoy\u2019s arm. \u201cCan you do me another favour?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe seemed to genuinely consider it before shrugging and nodding his assent. \u201cI suppose so. You\u2019ll owe me one though. It\u2019s never like a Slytherin to give without getting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever, Malfoy,\u201d she said, waving a dismissive hand in his direction. \u201cI need you to distract Auror Jacobs for me. I need to sneak out of here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn the run from the law? You  know I\u2019m an Auror, right? Can\u2019t be seen aiding and abetting a criminal.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you just do it?\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cI need to get out of this building without him seeing me. It can\u2019t be that difficult.Talk to him about your many hobbies of spending money and watching Quidditch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor needing a favour, you\u2019re acting like quite the tyrant. But, I\u2019m in a good mood today, so you\u2019re on.\u201d He began retreating backward, keeping his gaze on her and fluttering one eye closed in a wink. \u201cBut you owe me!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait! What size pants do you wear?\u201d Her cheeks burned, but when his smirk widened and amusement crinkled his eyes, she couldn\u2019t bite back the answering smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwenty-eight around the waist. Buying me something to wear around your flat in the morning?\u201d His brow lifted in a mischevious dare as he grinned back at her. Without another word spoken between them, Malfoy was out the door, clapping Jacobs on the shoulder and walking wide around him to steal his attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione darted for the door. Ducking behind a rather large bloke, ignoring the way he leered down at her, she turned sharply once the cool air nipped at her cheeks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce she was a block away, she managed a quick peek back and saw Malfoy still chatting happily with her security, glancing only once in her direction before returning to his conversation. The flutter in her belly still hadn\u2019t quieted, and against her better judgment, Hermione couldn\u2019t help but ponder a reality where they might end up together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: You all continue to just blow me away with your lovely response to this story. Thank you for all the wonderful reviews, kudos, and favorites. They mean so much to me!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll be back in a few days with another update!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlpha and Beta thanks to the wonderful MCal and DreamsofDramione!\n\n\nCHAPTER WARNING: This chapter touches on the topic of infertility.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAs Malfoy demolished his lunch, Hermione couldn\u2019t help but stare at him with a renewed fascination. The similarities were striking to be sure, but they were nothing compared to their differences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Malfoy she knew, while smug in his own self-righteousness, still seemed unsure. The man before her now was more confident, having the power of knowledge secured in his grasp. He was self-assured, secure in their relationship, and in her. And as she spent more time in his company, she realized that in some way, he did  know  her... at least some version of her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you have a good morning, love?\u201d.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlinking away her wandering thoughts, she brought her attention back to the present. \u201cI did. I was able to spend most of it in the Archives and brought back a few books for you to go over.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs she pulled them from her bag, Draco snorted and tossed the rest of his sandwich back on its wrapping. \u201cGranger, I don\u2019t  need to do any research. I\u2019ve read every book on time travel while sitting by your bedside twenty years from now. I managed to get here, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a swift inhale she collected her rage, cataloged it and started again. \u201cThis book, here,\u201d she paused, grabbing the one documenting Mimtumble\u2019s time travel and the Unborn. \u201cEloise Mimtumble\u2014she traveled back  four hundred years , where she lived for five days. When she returned, her entire timeline had been compromised! Dozens of people disappeared.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco shrugged, swallowing another bite. \u201cPropaganda.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a pop, her jaw fell open and she gaped back at him. \u201cHow can you say that? You could be erasing people from existence by even being here. You might save my life and in doing so damn a generation of magical beings.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRolling his head towards her, he snorted loudly. \u201cThat reference,  that story  , is from the 1800s. After that information got out, time jumping for any duration was outlawed. But you see, there\u2019s no further information about these  unborn  . They just ceased to exist, yeah? Well, all record of them ever existing  before  the incident vanished as well. Suspicious, eh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCuriosity piqued, Hermione sat back with heavily knitted brows, listening in rapture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Department of Mysteries, and furthermore the Ministry of Magic as a whole, has been corrupt for far longer than our lifetime. People who have control of time travel,  fuck with time travel . I\u2019d bet our last galleon that Sanders has gone both forward and back to secure her own climb to the top. And how do they continue to do this? They outlaw it for the general public and keep it hidden in the deepest, darkest corners of the DoM.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPausing, he raked a hand through his hair before clasping his fingers together between his knees and leaning towards her. \u201cNow, you\u2019re too smart to trust research that is  this  antiquated, especially when far newer documentation exists. Such as this\u2014\u201d Grabbing the small tome from the middle, he tossed it unceremoniously on the table between them.  Mishaps and Misfortunes in Time Travel: A Cautionary Tale .\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeople are still learning, still traveling; and the present timeline,  my  timeline remains unaltered until  I  alter it. When I go back, you and I will exist on two separate but parallel planes.\u201d He held this palms out, one hovering two inches above the other. \u201cBoth moving forward to the same destination.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDisbelief painted over her features as she stared back at the sodding little prick who was upheaving her entire existence. \u201cHow can you be so flippant about my future? You\u2019ll return, make the change you need to, but  my  reality has been compromised! Who\u2019s to say we even end up together in this timeline? Don\u2019t you care about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a loud scoff, he leaned back, folding his arms behind his head as he stared back at her. \u201cListen, you can make it sound as horrible as you want, but you\u2019d do the same for me, and yes, this timeline may not follow the same order of events. You might have a grander wedding or get rid of this flat. Might spend a little less time at the office and more in bed with me. Hell, you might even have kids, but\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat small wisp of information slammed into her, and he must have been able to tell by the blood draining from her cheeks because he paused mid-sentence, eyes widening. \u201cWe\u2014we never had kids?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFraught, haunting silence stretched between them, heavy and pulsing as her heart thundered in her chest. She\u2019d always wanted kids\u2014not now, surely, or even soon\u2014but  someday . A reality where that never came to fruition hurt more than she could have possibly imagined.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat timeline won\u2019t exist for you and you can make whatever changes you want. Nothing is written in stone.\u201d His tone was softer now, soothing the inevitable ache in her heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to know\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco,\u201d she pleaded, fingers curling into the thick fabric of her trousers. \u201cPlease just tell me.\u201d Everything hung on a taut line of suspension and she  couldn\u2019t breathe. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. We never had kids.\u201d\u00a0 The words settled heavily on her heart, a picture of her life barren, without children solidifying in her mind.\n\u00a0\nHer gaze watered as the racket of emotions inched up her throat. \u201cWhy? Did you not want them?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPulling a face, his hand moved up to massage the back of his neck. \u201cI did\u2026once. But, we soon realized that we didn\u2019t need children to make our life full. We have each other. We travel and explore, work our arses off but most importantly,\u201d he paused purposefully, silently imploring her to listen before continuing, \u201cwe love each other very much.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmoothing her palms flat against her thighs, she loosened a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand. If you want kids, and  I  want kids, what happened? We just\u2026changed our minds?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe muscles in his throat tightened, his jaw clenching. After what felt like an eternity, he lifted his gaze to hers and her stomach twisted painfully at the tears lining his red-rimmed eyes. \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOne breath. Two.  Three. \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSurprising her entirely, he was then on his feet, skirting around the coffee table just to sit on its edge right in front of her. A weak smile graced his lips as his hands reached out for her, curling around the back of her knees while his thumbs trailed back and forth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt was Bellatrix. Prolonged use of the Crutiatis can have unknown consequences. We found out about two years into our marriage that we wouldn\u2019t be able to have biological children.\u201d His fingers tightened gently and she felt something in her harden before splicing away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-me?\u201d she stuttered. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c Absolutely-fucking-not  . There is  nothing  wrong with you, love. You aren\u2019t defective, there\u2019s nothing that needs to be fixed. It didn\u2019t work out for us, but we have a wonderful life. And if  you  want kids, you can. There were options to be explored, but we were so heartbroken\u2026  so devastated , that we weren\u2019t ready. When the topic came around again\u2014\u201d Draco paused, seemingly chewing on his next thought, \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right time. But you\u2019re young, and if it\u2019s what you want, you can still make it happen.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTears began striping their way down her cheeks as she wrestled with the idea that not only was she  not  a mother, but that she and Draco had survived this horrible time in their lives  together. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWarm hands cradled her jaw, tugging her gaze up to his and she was rendered speechless by the devotion in his eyes\u2014the pure, all-consuming love.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for you to know that we\u2019re not living a life of want and what-ifs. We don\u2019t wander around pining after things we didn\u2019t get. We\u2019re happy and we\u2019re the best aunt and uncle around. We give the most obnoxious gifts and when we sit for Theo and Potter\u2019s kids, we load them full of sugar and let them fly their brooms wherever they want. I got more than I could have dreamed of when you decided to marry me\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut  you wanted kids. And you didn\u2019t get to have them because of me... \u201d Her brows furrowed and, suddenly struck with the gravity of these revelations, she hopped to her feet, wiping frantically at the tears still staining her cheeks. \u201cI should go. I have work.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFixing a mask that she wore so well back on her features, she smoothed her clothes and turned for the door. Before she made it even two steps, Draco\u2019s fingers were curling around her slender wrist, dragging her back into his arms. She should have fought it, shouldn\u2019t have latched onto the comfort he was offering, but she did\u2014she didn\u2019t even try to pretend otherwise.\n\u00a0\nHis arms banded around her, one hand cradling the back of her neck as she buried her face in his chest. Gentle, soothing words and coos surrounded her. \u201cI wanted  you.  I know you don\u2019t believe me, and that this entire thing is fucking strange, but I  do  love you, Hermione. I love you when you\u2019re forty-something and I love you when you\u2019re twenty-four. I\u2019ve loved you longer than I care to admit and have no intention of stopping anytime soon. And as long as you and I are together, that\u2019s all that matters. Everything else will work itself out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione pulled back a fraction so she could see him, waterlogged lashes stuck together as she blinked. \u201cSomehow, I believe you. Even if it\u2019s all utterly fucking ridiculous.\u201d She choked out a laugh, dragging the back of her hand across her tear ridden cheek. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, you would\u2019ve been a good father, I think.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis brow twitched, a ghost of a smirk playing on the edge of his lips as he gave a weak laugh. Pushing the curls from her forehead, he stared at her as though everything revolved around her. She\u2019d never had anyone look at her quite like that. \u201cYou would have been the best mum, Hermione. But instead, I get you all to myself. Sometimes you even let us sleep until half eight on the weekends.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA watery laugh slipped past her lips and she made to pull away, but his hold tightened. His gaze darkening for a moment before drifting to her lips and stealing her breath. It\u2019d be easy\u2014 too easy \u2014to close the short distance between their lips and steal more of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight,\u201d she breathed, eyes fluttering shut for a fraction of a second, before coming to her senses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a long, resigned sigh, his hands trailed up to the tops of her arms, squeezing gently before releasing her and stepping back. \u201cHave a good afternoon, love.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe disappeared in a flare of green flames with a sinking, ill-feeling forming in her gut.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d Cicely\u2019s bright voice, dripping with false camaraderie, caused her to jump, ink splattering across her third attempt of the report. Glowering at the mess now littering her once pristine parchment, she cursed under her breath before turning towards the culprit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakable Sanders.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust checking in!\u201d Her bright white smile gleaned against her dark skin and Hermione bristled as she entered her small workspace and began poking at the items on her desk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDesperate for a false sense of equal footing, Hermione pushed her squeaking chair back and rose to stand. \u201cOn anything particular?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPlucking a small pewter otter from a stack of parchments, Cecily took a long moment to inspect it before dropping it with a loud thud back where it\u2019d sat. \u201cNot unless there\u2019s something you want to tell me, Miss Granger.\u201d Her smile impossibly widened but it was chilling the way it didn\u2019t touch her eyes; they remained black and fathomless\u2014cold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAsk Hermione seventy two hours ago if she would have an ally in Draco Malfoy or Cecily Sanders, there would have been absolutely no question whatsoever. But mere hours changed everything, and the surge of protectiveness she felt for the blond stowed away in her flat steeled. \u201cNothing comes to mind.\u201d Hermione shrugged and kept her intent glare tight on the woman across from her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTucking her chin into her chest, Cecily chuckled darkly and rose tall, now towering over Hermione by several inches. There was a sense of superiority rippling through the air as she stared down her perfectly straight nose that sent a long shiver bubbling over her skin. Every instinct in her body screamed at her, clawing at her belly to bloody  do something\u2014 but what?\n\u00a0\nCecily\u2019s lips parted, ready to weave more thinly veiled threats, but they were both startled by Harry slamming his palm against the top of her cubicle. \u201cHermione! Drinks?\u201d Quickly sensing the tension, his gaze darted from Cecily back to her. Behind him, Malfoy appeared, shrugging on a thick gray coat, inspecting the scene with a keen eye.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d love a drink!\u201d Eyes glittering at the salvation of the two wizards, Hermione quickly swished her wand in the general direction of her desk. The parchments neatly stacked themselves and hid away in her drawers, the locks clicking into place as she grabbed her own cloak. \u201cUnspeakable Sanders\u2014\u201d She nodded politely. \u201cAlways a pleasure.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn a frenzy of wild curls and robes, she stormed past Harry and Draco, ignoring the many strange looks she was garnering. She didn\u2019t take a proper breath until she was behind the safety of the grates, and when she did, she sucked them in greedily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nAnother pint was delivered at the behest of Draco, and with a long, suffering sort of sigh, she relented and lifted it to her lips. She ought to be getting back to the  other  Draco, the one that was bound to be pissy that she was later than she\u2019d intended.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut  this  Draco seemed intent to steal her company as long as she\u2019d allow it, his arm slung lazily across the back of the booth and his body angled towards her. Theo and Harry sat across from them, pretzeled around each other in a casual lover\u2019s embrace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor some time now, she\u2019d tried to bring up the situation without  bringing up the situation,  and after many failed efforts of getting around the aptly dubbed \u2018cats-got-your-tongue\u2019 curse, she finally managed to phrase it properly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I ask you guys a question?\u201d she began in an almost conspiratorial tone, leaning forward. All three men nodded. \u201cWhat kind of power does the Department of Mysteries hold? Do they, say, trump the DMLE?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHarry pulled a face, canting his head back and forth a few times. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure how to answer that. It\u2019s not they are higher in any sort of hierarchy, but, I mean, it\u2019s the nature of their work to take precedence. We would probably apprehend the person in question, but they would seize most of the evidence.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith an indignant snort, Hermione choked on her ale and slammed it back down on the knotted table between them. \u201c Why ?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe three men shared a skeptical little look, brows furrowed in silent conversation, but it was the blond to her left to speak. \u201cWhy  wouldn\u2019t  they? Let\u2019s say there\u2019s an artifact causing a false sense of, I don\u2019t know, euphoria or love. Unspeakables study those, so they would immediately go into their custody for dissection. The DMLE would then corroborate with the DoM and bring it to those fine solicitors like Theo here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBehind his dewey glass, Theo grinned and tipped its edge in her direction. \u201cI\u2019m curious about your sudden infatuation with the DoM, Granger. Something you care to share?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer jaw fell open, the thought dying on her tongue before quickly mashing her lips together in a furious pout. Harry guffawed and reached his arm behind Theo\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s under oath, love; can\u2019t talk about it with the likes of us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGlaring at her friend for a long moment, Hermione finally thought of another question that seemed innocuous enough. \u201cSo, who oversees the Department of Mysteries? Surely they don\u2019t just have this vast, limitless power.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakable Sanders oversees the DoM,\u201d Harry responded with a shrug.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. But  who  oversees  her? \u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger, it\u2019s the Department of Mysteries .\u201d Draco paused to take a long swig of his whisky. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going on down there. That\u2019s kind of the point.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the problem! No one should have access to every department, able to move around unseen and unchecked. Has anyone ever considered there might be some level of corruption down there? They have access to things the rest of Wizarding society couldn\u2019t dream of and they do so without anyone knowing the difference.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry and Draco shared a long, meaningful look and they both tilted in towards her with a worried brow. \u201cHermione, if there\u2019s something we need to know\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a soft growl, Hermione pushed the curls from her forehead and tilted her face towards the dim light hanging overhead. \u201cI can\u2019t bloody  say  anything. I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m just frustrated is all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the strangest gesture of affection, Draco\u2019s hand came to rest on her shoulder, his thumb rubbing small, soothing circles. With half her pint left, Hermione rushed to her feet and grabbed her cloak, ignoring the soft thud of his hand on the seat she\u2019d just occupied. Blinking frantically, she shoved her hands in her pockets in search of galleons. \u201cI really ought to go, anyway. What do I owe you for the drinks?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing at all.\u201d Theo gave a weak, lopsided smile that Hermione gratefully accepted and mouthed a silent thank you, before turning and rushing from the pub.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe brittle October air flooded her lungs and Hermione paused in the soft drizzle to calm her racketing nerves. She was sinking deeper into an impossible situation, unable to climb her way out or, hell, even ask for some bloody help. The more she began to understand and even believe the motives of the future Draco Malfoy, the closer the one in the present seemed to press in. He was everywhere, all the time. Brushing his hand against her back and staring at her as though she was\u2026 important to him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe soft, ever-present London mist glistened on her cheeks, and it was all too easy to pretend that it was the cause for her wet lashes. Behind her, the door opened and promptly closed, and without turning, she knew who it was. In her peripheral, shrugging on his coat and bringing his wand up above them, was none other than her would-be-future-husband.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWalk you home, Granger?\u201d His voice was low, the words almost muffled like he was speaking from the corner of his mouth, and Hermione couldn\u2019t help the dry chuckle that bubbled forth when she thought of the other Malfoy in her home right now who did quite the same thing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? You think I need two Auror chaperones?\u201d Jerking her head over her shoulder, Malfoy\u2019s gaze followed, finding Auror Haverfield standing there with an abashed grimace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA low hiss sounded from her right. \u201cMerlin, Granger. What kind of mess have you gotten yourself into?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf only you knew, Malfoy.\u201d She laughed dryly, mostly to herself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a disapproving hum, he turned back towards the Auror lurking in the shadows. \u201cHaverfield, how long are you on duty tonight?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTil, morning.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cG\u2019on and take a quick break and you can meet us back at Miss Granger\u2019s flat. I\u2019ll escort her home.\u201d Malfoy spoke with a firm authority that left little room for debate, and before Haverfield was able to produce a proper thought, a hand was placed at the curve of her lower back, guiding her down the street. Once they were out of earshot, he spoke again, \u201cCare to tell me what in the world has landed you round the clock Auror protection?\u201d He paused for a moment, his fingers finding the crook of her elbow and slowing her step. \u201cIf\u2026 if you\u2019re in some kind of trouble or danger\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she rushed, meeting his intent gaze and studying this familiar version of Malfoy in close proximity. His eyes were dark in the ambient light of the street, fewer wrinkles, no wisps of silver near his hairline, but it was the way he  looked  at her. Had he always? Was she just now noticing? \u201cI promise. Just a silly precaution that I can\u2019t get rid of.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter a long swallow, Malfoy\u2019s lips lifted in a half-hearted smirk, before guiding her forward again. \u201cReady for the party this weekend?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGroaning loudly, Hermione took a step closer to him, until their shoulders were brushing and she was safe from the now steady rain. \u201cI\u2019m still considering not going. I don\u2019t do well at those types of things. It\u2019s all schmoozing and beautiful people and champagne from places I can\u2019t pronounce.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a loud bark of laughter, they rounded the corner onto her street. \u201cYou\u2019re underestimating how very Slytherin I think you can be, Granger. And I\u2019ll be disappointed if you don\u2019t come\u2014\u201d There was a pause as a whole riot of pixies seemed to break loose in her belly, a warm blushing rising to the apples of her cheeks. Malfoy stuttered, grasping at words until they finally formed a weak excuse. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to having another friendly face in the crowd.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer teeth cut into the flesh of her lower lip so hard she actually winced and feared she might\u2019ve drawn blood. \u201cWell, with purpose like that, how could I  ever  decide to stay home on my very comfortable sofa with a good book. Why, I\u2019ll rush to Madame Malkin\u2019s first thing so I can buy some gaudy dress and put on uncomfortable heels and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you want to come with me?\u201d he blurted, interrupting her incoherent rambling. \u201cNot that you have to, or should feel obligated. I don\u2019t normally bring anyone, so you won\u2019t be putting me out. But, I\u2019ll have a seat next to the wonder boys and I can pronounce all the champagnes, so it could be kind of fun.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIndecision clawed at her insides, swelling until she was positive her lungs were going to burst from the inside out. \u201cLike a date?\u201d she finally managed through impossibly tight vocal chords, her eyes widening into saucers as she stared ahead, seeing nothing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe paused and idly she recognized the stoop to her flat, lifting her attention to the dim light coming from her sitting-room window.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be. We could go as friends, or if that\u2019s still too familiar, colleagues who work in adjacent departments.\u201d There was a mischievous cadence to his words and her gaze shot back to his, finding it playful, fighting a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just, well\u2014\u201d She shifted, face screwing up on one side. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on a date in quite some time. And\u2026 are you sure you even  want  to go with me? It\u2019s me and it\u2019s  you  and that comes with a fair bit of baggage.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomething flashed behind his squinted stare, and before she could think more of it, he was taking a step away from her. \u201cThink about it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo pressure. Do you want me to walk you up?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShaking her head, Hermione mourned the sudden loss of his warmth and her lips pursed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow at work?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee you.\u201d His umbrella charm fell away and with a quick turn, he was gone, a small wisp of magic remaining in his stead, before drifting off into the wind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe rain smattered against her cheeks, turning her curls soggy. Ignoring everything that had just happened, she quickly jogged up the stairs towards her flat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to go with Malfoy; the honest truth of it was that she desperately  did.  But she\u2019d no way of knowing which Malfoy she was seemingly falling for. The real one, who pestered her relentlessly and couldn\u2019t go a day without inserting himself in her path, or the one behind that door, who so clearly loved her beyond reason.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith an exhausted sigh, she unlocked the door and slid through the smallest opening possible. Most of the lights were off except the small lamp by the end of the couch that he seemed to favour. As if drawn to him, her gaze quickly settled on Malfoy; much like the first night she\u2019d found him, he had one ankle slung over his knee, a book resting in the hollow that now existed between his thighs, and a tumbler of her firewhisky resting in his hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHullo, darling. Couldn\u2019t Floo that you\u2019d be home  hours  late?\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her, didn\u2019t so much as have an ounce of inflection in his tone as he licked the pad of his thumb and turned the page.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRolling her eyes, she shrugged off her wet cloak and slung it across the counter. In a few purposeful strides, she found herself falling onto the cushion directly next to him, her knees curled up, just barely resting against his thigh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStill, his gaze didn\u2019t waver. Narrowing her glare, she stared at the side of his face, watching as the corner of his mouth twitched for a fraction of a moment before he steeled it back into place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething you needed, love?\u201d He brought his drink to his lips. As soon as he\u2019d taken his demure little sip, she quickly nicked it from his grasp and settled deeper into the couch.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuckling dryly, Draco must have decided that this impudent gesture deserved his attention, and promptly closed the book on his lap, shifting to face her, amusement etched in every line of his face. \u201cYou\u2019re acting odd.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour wife doesn\u2019t normally sit next to you on the sofa?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c She  does, but as you seem so fond of reminding me,  you  are not  her .\u201d There was a softness behind his expression that she hadn\u2019t expected, and it quite nearly stole her breath away as she sipped from the glass cradled in her hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess I can be for a few minutes,\u201d she said with a small rise and fall of her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDraco moved again. This time his hand came up to detangle her legs and he tossed them across his lap. With a swift tug, he pulled her impossibly closer, her bum now pressed against him while his hand rested casually on her thigh. Her eyes widened as a daring grin crept across his lips.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to tell me about this day of yours?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this something we do?  Cuddle?\u201d  Her lips moved disdainfully around the word and the man next to her rumbled with a throaty laugh, his fingers tightening for the briefest moment on the thick of her thigh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider this cuddling. Although, we sometimes partake in such salacious activities, I suppose. This is just me being affectionate and asking you about your day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStudying him for a long moment, the truth finally spilled, unbidden, from her lips. \u201cYou asked me out. Well, younger you, that is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c I did? \u201d Draco pulled a surprised face, chuckling under his breath, before stealing the drink back for his own. \u201cAtta boy, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that surprising to you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA little, I guess. I didn\u2019t get the nerve for a while yet. I played a long, slow game, wooing you over many, many pints. Merlin, the number of Potter\u2019s reports that I had to do just so  he would ask you for drinks, so I could then gate crash is deplorable.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA smile cracked on her lips and a warm flush spread across her cheeks. \u201c You did what ? That\u2019s what the current Malfoy is doing, then?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI presume so,\u201d he said after swallowing another long pull of whisky. \u201cBut looks like I found some bollocks I didn\u2019t know I had. I hope you said yes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShame coloured her features and she stared down at her fingers, winding them together in her lap. \u201cI didn\u2019t. It\u2019s so complicated\u2026 I didn\u2019t say no, either. I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a moment of quiet between them, and with a flick of his wrist, their glass was refilled and offered to her. \u201cHe\u2019ll understand. He\u2019s waited this long, love.\u201d Her stomach folded in on itself and she felt a strange longing twisting in her belly. Soft fingers found her chin, tilting her face back up to his. \u201cYou can talk to me, you know. I know you better than most; I can practically  hear  you overthinking.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wish I knew what it was. Maybe I\u2019m starting to feel something for him\u2014for you\u2014but it\u2019s too murky. What if a part of me is just falling in love with this life that you keep telling me we have\u2014a life I\u2019ll never have. I\u2019ll admit, there\u2019s always been this strange\u2026 chemistry between you and I. Mostly it\u2019s volatile but sometimes it\u2019s not. You\u2019re different in twenty years than you are now.  Now,  you\u2019re still snarky and combative and  impossible  and\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSoft lips silenced her, slanting over her mouth and pressing again and again until she lost all reasonable thought. Her wide, startled eyes fluttered closed of their own volition and, surprising them both, she responded. A soft, contented noise passing from her lips to his as her fingers curled in the thin cotton of his shirt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDespite the chasm of time that distanced their lives, she knew these lips already. She\u2019d kissed them until she was dizzy and breathless, pressed against the wall at the Leaky. And possibly even more so, he intimately knew hers. The kiss wasn\u2019t one of nervous new lovers still exploring, but instead, that of a seasoned traveler, revisiting their favourite place with a reverence she couldn\u2019t fathom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPillowing her lips, he gently dragged her full bottom lip between his own, earning another soft hum as she arched into his touch. The hand on her thigh flexed, inching up towards her bum.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was everywhere, leaning her back, and settling between her thighs; the hand on her bum drifted back towards her knee and hitched it higher, and she gasped when she felt his thick erection press into her core. Not wasting a breath as they parted, he trailed his lips down her jaw, finding and sucking gently on a spot on her neck that made her cry out and cling to his thick shoulders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA confident palm skimmed up her shirt, delicately tracing the curve of her breast, before filling his palm with her. With a start, she realized that her own hands remained limp and useless. Quickly, she set forth to make amends, exploring the scar crawling up his neck, the thick strips of muscle on his back.\n\u00a0\n Merlin,  she wanted him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMaybe she always had.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut now, here, in this dark little flat that they\u2019d someday call home with the rain pelting against her windows,  she wanted him. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith all the force of a wayward bludger, reason returned and her hands stilled. Sensing the shift in her, he froze, hands ceasing their tracks and tongue retreating back between his lips. Pushing up on his hands, he caged her in, eyes darting nervously over her face as she panted away the desire boiling in her veins.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlinking up at him several times, she finally mustered the courage to speak. \u201cWe should\u2014I mean,  I \u00a0should go to bed. Yes. Yes, that\u2019s what I need to do.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe space between his brows crinkled for a hair of a breath and he quickly masked it with a slow smirk. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said simply, crawling off her and back into the safety of his corner of the couch. \u201cRest well, Granger.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione couldn\u2019t move. She laid there for close to a minute as she stared up at the dated ceiling of her flat, wondering why in the hell she\u2019d just stopped herself from quite possibly the best shag of her life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to sleep?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Right.  Sleep .\u201d Finally dragging her body off the couch, she righted her clothes and turned for her room, managing only a single look back at the blond on her sofa, sitting exactly as he had been when she\u2019d walked in half an hour ago. \u201cIs it hard not sleeping next to someone after you\u2019ve done it for twenty years?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA wry smile cracked on his lips but he didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose you could sleep in there.  Sleep ,\u201d she repeated for her own good just as much as his. \u201cIf you wanted. If it would help, I mean.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis gaze slid slowly from the pages of his book to her, fidgeting with a button on her blouse and gnawing on her lip.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI might take you up on that, Granger. Get some sleep.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRetreating to the confines of her bedroom, she instinctively reached for the raggedy shirt she\u2019d slept in the night before, but paused, eyeing it warily. Instead, before she could think better of it, she pulled open her first drawer and selected a nightgown that barely kissed the middle of her thighs and exchanged her clothing for it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSliding into bed, she stared at the ceiling for hours, before finally she was dragged under, dreaming of wet kisses and wandering touches, completely unaware when the bed dipped next to her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: Whoop whoop!

As noted in the story tags, it really depends how you look at it. If this is triggering to you, or not something you are interested in, please take that into consideration.\n\n\u00a0\nMost mornings the gentle buzzing of her wand or the soft rays of early morning light streaking through her curtains woke Hermione. But not this morning. No, on this particular morning, while dreaming of the Giant Squid wrapping its long tentacles around her and dragging her under the surface of the Black Lake, she woke with a thin sheen of sweat covering her body, and a too warm arm draped over her middle. Her cheek was pressed against a bare chest, her palm splayed wide on a smattering of scars over his heart.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA gasp slipped from her lips, and driven by instinct alone, she attempted to detangle herself, moving the leg that was draped dangerously across his. Before she made it an inch, his hands tightened around her, one snaking behind her knee and pulling her impossibly closer until the supple curves of her body were pressed hard against him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoing somewhere, love?\u201d he asked around a yawn, curling around her until their limbs were pretzeled. The hand on her knee slid up her thigh and continued to the dip of her waist, barely skimming the side of her breast, before finding her curls and burying his fingers there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a reasonable thought somewhere in her brain, surely there had to be; but when his nose brushed against hers, his lips ghosting around hers, it shriveled and died wherever it had been stowed away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTightening his fingers in her curls, he lightly tugged her head back until she was staring up at him,  him  who was still sleepy eyed and grinning, while  she  was positively mortified in the thin little slip she\u2019d brazenly decided to wear, feeling the pulsing warmth of his erection pressing into her hip.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d His name lilted quietly in the air, breathy and  begging,  but he didn\u2019t move. Even as her hips rolled against his and her hands moved to thread in the hair at the nape of his neck, he remained still.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe sun broke over the horizon, flooding her room with the hazy orange glow of sunrise and with it, her gaze snapped up to his, meeting his dark, hungry stare with one of her own. Without ever having made a conscious decision, her lips were crushing against his, back arching as his hands slid over every inch of her body they could reach.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a surprisingly pleasing roughness, he palmed her breasts through the thin cotton of her nightie, causing the strap to slip over her shoulder as he moved his mouth from hers and began laving wet, open mouthed kisses along her bare shoulder. His touch never stopped exploring\u2014 stopped worshipping\u2014 and under his reverent, skillful fingers, she lost herself, head falling back as he sucked on a spot just under her jaw that made her cry out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tips of his fingers dug into the thick flesh of her arse as he grinned against the thin skin of her neck. \u201cYou forget, love,\u201d he paused, dragging his tongue up her neck and finding her earlobe with his teeth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA shiver rippled across her flesh, wakening every hair follicle on her body as her skin tingled and tightened. \u201c I know you . I know you like it when I do this\u2014\u201d The tip of his tongue dragged up the shell of her ear. \u201cAnd this\u2014\u201d The hand not groping her tugged her hair lightly and she moaned at the onslaught of sensation coursing through her body. \u201cAnd even if you won\u2019t admit it right now, I know you like this\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRucking up the hem of her nightie, a flat palm came down hard on her arse, the hard slap earning a sharp inhale and  fuck,  she  did like it. Her hips answered for her by bucking into him again and a low, throaty chuckle rumbled against her neck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn a swift push, she was flat on her back, his knee pressing against her aching sex as she wantonly pushed against him, a vain attempt to crush her body into his. Lips trailing down her chest, pausing only briefly to pull the top of her slip down and wrap around her nipple, he began to crawl his way down her body. She squirmed with anticipation and anxiety, terrified of anything  else  when\u2026 well, it\u2019d just been so very long since anything like this had happened.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe moved quickly, purposefully , sliding her knickers off and tossing them over his shoulder. With another practiced move, his face was between her thighs, hitching a leg over his bare shoulder and she twisted away the rush of cool air on her bare sex, stopped only by one hand curling around her leg and pulling her hip flat against the mattress.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA loud, strangled gasp tore from her throat, her hands rushing down to tangle in his hair when the tip of his tongue ran along her seam, flicking her clit once, before thrusting the thick muscle inside her. Her back arched off the mattress and Draco quickly took advantage of the new angle by burying his face deeper.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBucking against his face, she was sure that the humiliation would settle in later at the least opportune time. His tongue slid up to her clit, lips closing around the aching bud as two fingers quickly pushed inside her drenched folds, curling and finding a spot inside that made her moan again and again. He didn\u2019t stop, didn\u2019t let up, his tongue, fingers, and lips working in perfect rhythm until she was overcome, cresting and falling and fucking  flying  as wave after wave of undulating pleasure washed over.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe final vestiges of her orgasm faded away, and her body sank uselessly into the mattress, gathering her wits as she prepared to feel his cock at her entrance, but it never came. Instead, he flopped on the bed next to her and stared at her with a wide, amused grin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPanic crashed over her when she realized, with her breast still hanging out and thighs parted, that they were not about to have sex. \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d Her eyes widened as she fussed with her nightie, covering herself in a watery attempt at modesty.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco barked out a laugh, his hand curling around the nape of her neck and dragging her in for a quick but firm kiss. When he pulled back, he stared down at her with a bewildered expression. \u201cWhy on Earth would you think you did anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, a hot blush blooming on her cheeks, \u201cum, I thought you might want to\u2026  you know .\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I do .\u201d His eyes crinkled in playful mischief and he kissed her once more, before rolling from the bed. In the brief moment of silence, she couldn\u2019t help but appreciate all of his long, hard lines, and when he turned, and she caught sight of the bulge in his sleep trousers, she gasped. \u201cAnd we will. But, you\u2019ll be late for work, and I\u2019ve got time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer jaw unhinged, hanging agape like a buffoon as he sauntered to the front room. There was a soft rummaging noise and he called back to her, as if the events that had just happened were the most commonplace thing in the world. \u201cLove! Where\u2019d you put those clothes for me? I\u2019ll get a pot of tea started if you want to shower before work!\u201d\n\u00a0\nSnapping her mouth shut, Hermione rolled back on the mattress, staring up at the hideous hanging light over her bed completely confounded.  What on earth had she just done? \n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nThe morning stretched on with no end in sight. One report blurred into the next, and stacks of parchment piled high in the outbox on her desk. As the minutes dragged into hours, Hermione tried, in vain, to keep her mind off the man still holed up in her apartment. Every time her mind drifted back to the early hours of the morning, a warm blush blossomed on her skin and a riot of nerves twisted in her belly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d been annoyingly right; he  did  know her. Her gaze went hazy, the feather of her quill running along the underside of her chin as she stared at absolutely nothing in particular, lost in the memory of the toe-curling orgasm\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer reverie was snapped by the familiar intrusion of her dear friend, and she blinked herself back into the moment, eyes landing on Harry and Malfoy. With a start, she stared wide eyed and horrified at the blond smirking down at her. One hand came up, massaging the thick of his neck, and Hermione couldn\u2019t help but lock onto the simple movement with a gaping jaw. She now knew those hands, knew the way they felt digging into her hip and curling inside her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, you had sex\u2014 didn\u2019t you ?\u201d Her gaze shot to Harry, grinning as he closed his cloak around him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStuttering and floundering, she didn\u2019t miss the way the corner of Malfoy\u2019s eyes tightened for a fraction of a second, before the synapses between her brain and tongue finally began responding. She steeled her glare at her friend. \u201cI did  not  have sex, to be clear.  And  if I had, could you not announce it to the whole bloody department.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve had sex,\u201d Harry said with a shrug, gesturing at her face with a single finger. \u201cYou always get all moonfaced. Lunch?\u201d Her face felt too hot all of a sudden, and she rushed to her feet, before her ridiculous friend could find a way to humiliate her further.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying.\u201d Throwing her cloak over her arm and tucking a curl behind her ear, she came around her cubicle and finally met Malfoy\u2019s keen eye. \u201cComing, Malfoy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe corner of his mouth quirked and he shook his head. \u201cNot this time. My mother demands my attention for lunch. If I don\u2019t look at the bloody table linens, then surely the entire event will come crumbling down.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Disappointment sat heavy on her tongue and Harry\u2019s brow knitted as he stared at the interaction. \u201cI hope you have fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFolding his full, perfect lips in on themselves, Malfoy turned for the Floos, and unbidden, Hermione called out to him, \u201cMalfoy!\u201d When he paused his step and turned, her heart fluttered to life and she couldn\u2019t  breathe.  \u201cYou know the question you asked me last night? The one you said I should think on?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d One pale brow rose above the other and there was the slightest flash in his silver eyes.\n\u00a0\nWith a tilt to her chin and one hard swallow, she squared her shoulders and gave the answer she should have last night. \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe swore the apples of his cheeks pinked as his smirk widened to a grin. \u201cBrilliant, Granger. Looking forward to it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a final flirtatious wink, he was gone, leaving her fighting a smile as she turned towards her wide eyed, amused friend. \u201cShut it, Potter.\u201d Their laughter followed them through the lifts as Harry poked and prodded her about her soon-to-be date.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nThe plates were cleared. The bill was paid. Now all that was left was staring at her dopey eyed friend who, for the life of him, couldn\u2019t stop talking about the fact that Hermione Granger was going on a date with none other than Draco Malfoy himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you knock it off?\u201d Hermione glowered over her water glass as they prepared to leave. \u201cYour goofy grin is grating my nerves.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m keen on it. Would sure make dinner plans a lot easier. But what changed? You couldn\u2019t stand the bloke a week ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a hot blush staining her cheeks, she shoved away from the table and grabbed her cloak. \u201cThat\u2019s not  entirely  true. And besides, I can barely stand him now. I just\u2014\u201d Words failed her. Merlin, it would make her life so much easier if she could just tell Harry what was going on. \u201cI\u2019m seeing him in a different light, is all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you going to wear?\u201d he asked, eyebrows waggling excitedly as they pushed the door to the cafe open only to be met with frigid autumn gusts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a loud groan, realization slammed into her. Bollocks it all, she still needed a dress. \u201cShite. A dress\u2026 I don\u2019t suppose I could wear the one I wore in May?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry deadpanned, his bright eyes dulling in disappointment. \u201cLet\u2019s stop at the robes shop around the corner. Work can piss off a while longer. If Malfoy\u2019s not there, I shouldn\u2019t have to be either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine. But we need to hurry. I can\u2019t stay late tonight.\u201d She blushed and bit back a smile as the vivid memories of the morning rushed back to her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should wear plum\u2026 oh! Or maybe silver!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer lip curled disdainfully as she stared ahead, dreading every step that brought her closer to the robes shop.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou better be nice, Hermione. If you aren\u2019t, I\u2019ll let you walk into that party in something truly horrendous\u2014like  yellow.  It\u2019s just not your color, I don\u2019t care how much you like it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nHarry appeared in the floor-length mirror behind her, grinning like a fool. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna lose his fucking mind.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHarry! It\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of it than it is. It\u2019s one night. It\u2019s not like\u2014\u201d All of a sudden, her heart felt heavy, thudding sluggish in her hollow chest. She turned once in the mirror, inspecting the scooping back of the crimson silk, her voice dropping low. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting married.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay, Hermione? You seem\u2026  off lately.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmoothing the cool fabric down her stomach, she gave herself a final appraising once over and decided that this was the one. With a weak smile and a nod, she answered her friend that she was indeed okay before disappearing behind the curtain of the changing room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe dress was lovely, and probably too expensive, but as it slid over her curves and pooled at her feet, she found she cared very little about the cost, and much more about what either Draco would think of her in it.  Or out of it.  Another furious blush blossomed as she hurried to dress, eager to return to work and her mind-numbing research.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith the gown slung over an arm and her work clothes back in place, Hermione exited to the main floor of the shoppe only to stop dead in her tracks, eyes blowing wide at Malfoy standing next to her friend, chatting easily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen his gaze landed on hers, his lips pulled into a familiar smirk and she felt her stomach flop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione! Look who I saw passing by,\u201d Harry said, jerking his chin towards his partner. \u201cHow was lunch, mate?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a start, he tore his gaze from Hermione. \u201cLunch? It was\u2026 good. Lunch was good. Hi, love.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Love.  Suspicion washed over her as she narrowed her gaze surreptitiously. Even Harry seemed to notice, cocking his head back once and pulling a face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you back so soon. Hell, I thought you\u2019d be out the rest of the day. Your mum didn\u2019t end up needing you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy\u2019s face pinched to one side, his hand rising to rest on his scarred neck, the other flailing about as he struggled to articulate an actual sentence. But then, her gaze caught again on the long expanse of his neck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Scarred. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs in the scrawling, nasty scar that he received  after  he and alternate-Hermione began dating. The very one that she supposedly worried and fretted over, sitting at his bedside, before finally confessing her love for the stupid prat. The scar that the younger Malfoy, the one who was presumably still at tea with his mother, did  not have.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy mum\u2026 right. Well, she finished early with me.\u201d Pausing, Malfoy appeared to consider his next words carefully, and finally, with a grand gesticulation, seemed to have his  aha!  moment. \u201cBut! She\u2019s sent me on a rather important errand. One that I shouldn\u2019t put off. So, you\u2019ll have to excuse me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFolding his lips into a flat line, Malfoy turned to leave the quaint little shop and Hermione snagged his elbow, before he made it a single step, dragging him a few paces away. \u201cAre you bloody kidding me?\u201d she hissed, gaze darting over her shoulder and smiling too brightly at her friend. \u201cWhat in the hell are you thinking? There\u2019s an Auror right outside.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a loud, watery snort, the little prat actually rolled his eyes. He\u2019d glamoured his face and hair, although the cut wasn\u2019t exactly right, but the etching of time near the corners of eyes was missing. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not. I confounded that poor twit when Potter called me in. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve not been doing that so far.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d she stopped. The realization that he was right and she  should  have been confounding him pushed her shoulders down and she let out a blunt huff. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt that, he had the audacity to guffaw in her face, and she was no longer responsible for her actions when she punched him  hard  in the shoulder. Served him right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow, I have to go. I\u2019m sure you understand, Granger.\u201d His palm met the curve of her arse in a sharp  slap,  and she yelped at the sting, before turning to glower at his back. He paused briefly at the register, whispering something to the giggling little witch behind the counter, before disappearing through the front door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione\u2014\u201d Harry started, his voice low and cautious, like if he spoke too fast she might spook and run away\u2014or hex him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this now, Harry. That stupid, rotten, no good\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHermione Granger! Tell me what\u2019s going and  now!\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \u201cI can\u2019t!  Remember? I\u2019m sorry, Harry. You\u2019re a talented Auror, you\u2019ll just have to figure it out for yourself. Will you tell Peterson that I couldn\u2019t come back in today? Blame it on a stomach bug or something, but I do have to go.\u201d She pushed past him, shoving the dress at the still blushing witch and mumbling that she\u2019d be back for it later.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, but Miss!\u201d The tinkling sound of the girl\u2019s voice caused her hackles to raise and she paused briefly with her hand hovering over the door knob. Malfoy could already be inside bloody Gringotts by now. \u201cMister Malfoy asked that I charge the gown to his personal account. It\u2019s been paid in full.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe slow curling of the witch\u2019s smile as she waved her dainty little wand through the air, sending her new gown into a garment bag, made Hermione quite sure that she should hex this dingbat to spit slugs for the next twelve hours. \u201cHow thoughtful of Mister Malfoy. Please have it sent to my home. Mister Potter will tell you the address.\u201d She turned to Harry then, mouthing a silent apology, before tearing onto the street corner and frantically hunting for that familiar shade of blond.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe had to assume he\u2019d not already been to Gringotts, he seemed to still be in too much of a hurry. Shoving through the throngs of people rushing about on their lunch break, she couldn\u2019t help but growl unintelligibly and rue the day that she ever met that pesky little ferret. Stupidly in love her arse. If they did somehow end up contractually bound together in matrimony, surely she would have killed him before he reached his mid-forties. He was far too infuriating.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe crowd parted and  finally  the looming doors of Gringotts came into view. A loud, relieved breath passed her lips, and just as she began marching for its entrance, a hand shot out of the alley and dragged her back into the shadows.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss me?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s face was too close, his smirking mouth hovering over hers, and if she focused hard enough, she could feel the soft pattering of his heart against hers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWrinkling her nose as if she\u2019d just smelled sewage, she shoved him back and away. \u201cYou are in so much trouble! Why on Earth did you leave the flat? If Cec\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCecily Sanders can suck a knob. I\u2019m not worried about that little string bean witch any more than I am a pygmy puff. In fact, I have half a mind to march into the Auror office now and open up an investigation on her myself\u2014if I weren\u2019t presently occupied.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Presently occupied? \u201d she mocked, crossing her arms tersely over her chest. \u201cWhat in the hell is so important that you\u2019re risking getting caught?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI told you, love. I need to get Gringotts and make sure that the necklace was indeed released into the care of Narcissa Malfoy and not shipped off to Andromeda or some obscure trinket obsessed relative. It\u2019ll be in their records of what went where. Although, I\u2019m quite positive it\u2019s at the Manor. Then, I will get  to  the Manor\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nInhaling sharply through her teeth, she clenched her eyelids and massaged the bridge of her nose, feeling the familiar thrum of a headache creeping up on her. \u201cMalfoy. You  can not  go to the Manor. You shouldn\u2019t even be roaming about. If younger Malfoy sees you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe won\u2019t. Stop worrying! Come with me to Gringotts and then I\u2019ll go home with you and we can do more of what we did this morning, eh?\u201d Hermione growled and slapped him in the chest, ignoring the obnoxious waggling of his brows and moving quickly for the mouth of the alley.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, you\u2019re bloody annoying. Let\u2019s go so we can get back.\u201d She paused, halting her step and narrowing her gaze back at him once more. \u201c And not for sex!  That\u2019s not at all what I meant, so don\u2019t even think about it. You\u2019re not leaving that flat again\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, he was behind her, warm, rigid planes of muscle pressed hard against her rear, his fingers curling around her hips, and she gasped as he pulled her back into him. \u201cYou might have to tie me to the bedpost to get me to stay, love.\u201d His lips brushed against that particularly sensitive spot on her neck and her skin prickled under his attention. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s usually you who likes to be hitched up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cAck! \u201d Shooing him away, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh, a blush staining her cheeks as he followed her out into the street.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nGringotts was bustling; a long line of patrons stretched nearly to the door and every teller was working at a painstakingly slow, leisurely pace. They\u2019d be here forever, and the longer this version of Draco Malfoy was in public, the more anxiety ridden she was bound to get. He, however, seemed unfazed, meandering to the back of the line and whistling to himself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re having such a lovely outing,  dear.\u201d Contemptuous was quite possibly the best way to describe her particular brand of venom today, and when she was met with a bright smile, she nearly bat bogey hexed him on the spot.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been kept prisoner for the better part of a week in the least favorite of our properties and I\u2019m just happy to be out enjoying the day with my wife.\u201d Her eyes snapped down to the wedding ring on his finger and she gasped, snatching his hand and trying to yank it off.  \u201cWhat on Earth, witch?!\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nThe fray caused a few wandering stares as he closed his hand into a fist, but she didn\u2019t relent, instead pulling hard on his fingers as he wrenched away from her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a defeated grunt, she gave up, hands falling heavy at her sides. \u201cYou\u2019re not married, you prat!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re paranoid, Granger!\u201d His eyes blew wide and round as he clucked his tongue and stared at her with stern disappointment. \u201cPull yourself together! It\u2019s you who\u2019ll get me caught if you don\u2019t act at least a fraction less fucking high-strung. Now shush, my teller is coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMister Malfoy! I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t see you there!\u201d A goblin who stood just under waist high appeared, his skin a peculiar shade of green and his black eyes appraising the situation too keenly for her liking. \u201cPlease, I\u2019ll escort you to a private room.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Griszul. Miss Granger will be accompanying me; that is, if she can promise to behave.\u201d Both the goblin and the insufferable git to her left stared at her with arched brows, as if bloody waiting for her to actually say she was going to behave. She stared pointedly back at Malfoy who swallowed a chuckle and nodded at the banker to proceed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey were quickly escorted into a small private room, decorated with high back chairs and a velvet settee in the corner. Griszul took his place behind the desk, folding his long, knotted fingers together and canting his chin in their direction. \u201cMister Malfoy, your wand?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, shite. Yes, of course.\u201d Malfoy quickly set it on the desk, watching as the Goblin tested it for validity, before gesturing that he could take it back. \u201cRight. The Black family vaults, I need itemized records of where the pieces were sent. Dark artifacts are inconsequential; in particular, I\u2019m looking for a necklace.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe goblin\u2019s wiry, overgrown brows furrowed and his stare flickered back and forth between them for a long minute. \u201cThat\u2019s all, Mister Malfoy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a soft hum\u2014that almost sounded like a growl\u2014Griszul hopped from his seat and disappeared behind a door on the back wall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s suspicious.\u201d Hermione\u2019s lips pursed into a tight pout and she straightened in her seat, a vain attempt to feel taller.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco hummed, his eyes narrowed and fingers steepled under his chin. He said nothing, letting the uncomfortable silence stretch on like a cord pulled too tight, begging to be plucked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMere minutes later, the door re-opened and Hermione jumped in her seat, wiping the sweat from her palms on her trousers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe ledger you requested, Mister Malfoy.\u201d With a snap of his fingers, a scroll materialized on the table in front of them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank y\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI assume you\u2019ve arranged some other exit from the bank today, Mister Malfoy?\u201d A knowing brow quirked in their direction and  fuck  if Hermione couldn\u2019t hear her own heartbeat rattling in her chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo I need another exit, Griszul?\u201d Draco stood, lifting the parchment and shoving it in his robes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d suggest it, Sir. As you and your mother are now in the lobby waiting to be seen.\u201d The goblin\u2019s voice was tight, almost an annoyed drawl that Draco met with a soft chuckle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTiming was never my strong suit. For your discretion, Griszul.\u201d Tossing a small satchel of galleons on the table, he quickly reached into a pocket and pulled out a silk handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the flat, love.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cWait!\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nHis finger brushed a small jewelry box, and with a soft pucker and a snap, he was gone. Why on fucking Earth would he not let her Portkey as well? The ridiculous little shite.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBaring her teeth in an uncomfortable, awkward grimace, Hermione rose to her feet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood day, Miss Granger.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMister\u2026 erm, Griszul. Don\u2019t suppose you have a back door for me to sneak out of? Perhaps a dragon who needs rescuing? That\u2019s my specialty\u2026\u201d She laughed weakly, flinching when all he did was glare back at her, his lip curling in disdain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a resigned sigh, she turned to leave, giving a silent prayer that the Malfoys were not on the other side of the door. A question pushed past her lips before she had the forethought to think better of it. \u201cWhy\u2019d you help him\u2014Draco, that is, if you knew?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s his vault.\u201d His features were void of even a trace of interest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Well, thank you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCreaking the door open, she sighed in relief when there was no platinum blond hair in her immediate line of sight. But, as she snuck from the smallest sliver of an opening possible, the voice she\u2019d dreaded to hear sounded from her left.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a loud shriek, she nearly toppled over, stopping only when two hands caught her. The same hands, more or less, that had brought her to orgasm several hours earlier and the same lips she\u2019d kissed swollen in her bed.  Bollocks.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Malfoy.\u201d She stared up at the bewildered young Malfoy, gulping as she righted herself. \u201cI bet you\u2019re surprised to see me here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChuckling softly, his hands fell away from her arms and for the first time, she noticed the unfairly beautiful women over his shoulder. Jealousy roiled in her stomach at the arch of her aristocratic brow and pristine robes. Hermione was all wild hair and sweaty appendages as she panted in the face of London\u2019s most eligible bloody bachelor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMother, this is Hermione Granger, officially.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger.\u201d Missus Malfoy tilted her head, a pleasant smile adorning her perfect face. \u201cI hear you\u2019re accompanying my son to the gala this weekend\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cMother\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d His mother\u2019s palm came down flat on her chest as she feigned surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked about nothing else all afternoon and I\u2019m not even allowed to bring it up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cMother!\u201d  Draco hissed over his shoulder, his cheeks staining a bright pink.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiting back a giggle, Hermione nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m excited. I just bought a dress actually.\u201d Well,  they  just bought her a dress.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, out of sheer curiosity, why are you here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cMe?  Oh\u2014\u201d A dry, awkward chuckle flitted through the air and she pulled on a curl. \u201cJust... financial matters, you understand.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith Griszul?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s brow arched and she felt an uncomfortable twisting in her belly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cErm, yes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco cocked his head to the side and she could feel the palpable tension press in around her. \u201cWith the private banker for the Sacred Twenty-Eight?\u201d  Fucking, brilliant. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d With a firm swallow, she said nothing else, silently imploring the universe to give her a bloody break already.\n\u00a0\n \u201cRight.  Well, we better off. We need to tend to our donation for the event tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLooking forward to that, Malf\u2014er, Draco. Mrs. Draco,  I mean Mrs. Malfoy!\u201d \n\u00a0\nNow Narcissa Malfoy was all out grinning, a completely strange phenomenon that Hermione was not sure ever existed before this moment. She dipped her head in a goodbye and Hermione curtseyed\u2014 fucking curtseyed,  before promptly disappearing, praying to be swallowed into the void.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nxXx\n\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: This chapter is coming to you a bit early because LK is having a rotten, horrible, bad, no-good kinda day. WAH! Only a few chapters left, which I know seems bizarre because we\u2019ve got a lot of ground left to cover, but I promise all shall be dealt with!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBig thanks to my beta, DreamsofDramoine; she worked tirelessly on this heap and finished beta\u2019ing the other day! I have all the remaining chapters back!   WOOHOO!   Just have to edit and I\u2019ll work on getting them posted over the next few days. I\u2019m sorry, to those who would like a schedule so they know when to check! It will most definitely be up in its entirety before Wednesday!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nI know we had some sheisty gray area stuff going down, and our poor sweet BB Draco lost out on something special\u2026\u00a0 but I hope you\u2019ll trust me to see you through until the end! I don\u2019t necessarily like to give it to them too easy, yeah?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI like to call it the \u201cSpank and Soothe\u201d \u2122 lol It\u2019s gonna sting, but I\u2019ll make it better ;)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkay, longest AN in the history of AN\u2019s. Mcal is a dream for her alpha work and I love you all!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks for all your feedback! It makes my day to hear from you!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLK\n\nSure, maybe she was being a little dramatic. But  her husband  had left her to fend for herself trapped in Gringotts with an irritable goblin and not one, but  two curious Malfoys ready to pounce outside.\n\u00a0\nOh, and then it\u2019d started pouring before she could get an umbrella charm up and soaked her through and through. So, when she arrived back at  her  flat, curls heavy and sodden, clothes clinging to her body, she was ready to fight. She kicked the door open and marched over the threshold only to freeze, mouth agape at the scene before her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere, on her sofa, in the same spot he seemed so fond of occupying, was the older Draco Malfoy. And  there , in her favorite armchair, the one she loved to curl up in on lazy Sunday afternoons, was Harry-bleeding-Potter, his emerald eyes in near slits and his lips pulled into a disapproving frown.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDarling! You\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nAll of her ire returned tenfold and she glared at the blond prat grinning from across the room. \u201cShove it, Malfoy! You\u2019re in enough trouble.\u201d Shrugging her cloak off and depositing it on her kitchen counter, she slowly made her way into the room. Unfazed by the idiot who\u2019d left her high and dry, all her attention locked onto her friend. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s told you, but\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, voice dripping with condescension.  \u201cHe\u2019s  told me enough.  He\u2019s  not under oath you see. Never had the chance when he tripped through a fucking Tempus Motus and Merlin\u2019s fuck, Hermione do you know how much trouble you\u2019re going to be in? You\u2019re harboring a fugitive!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a loud, obnoxious groan, Malfoy tipped his face to the ceiling and suddenly, all eyes were on him. \u201cYou guys are seriously buying into Cecily\u2019s power trip too much. She\u2019s annoying\u2014and Potter, I highly recommend you look into that time-hopping business, because I can guarantee you that witch has been dabbling in some illegal time travel to secure her own future\u2014but you are very much overestimating her reach. Time travel is illegal, yes, but I cannot be prosecuted in this time. I most certainly can when I return, but I don\u2019t plan on being caught, now do I?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd how is it, Malfoy, that you know so much about Unspeakable Sanders and the consequences of time travel?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice took on a new, genuinely curious, quality.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSnorting, Malfoy leveled Harry with a flat stare. \u201cI\u2019m an  Auror,  you twit. And listen, I don\u2019t mean Cecily\u2019s completely harmless, she  did  curse my wife,\u201d he paused to gesture to Hermione, still soggy and glowering, \u201cbut, her power is perceived, mostly by herself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve now altered  your timeline? How do you know what you\u2019re going back to?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Potter. I  will  alter the timeline when I return. Think about when you and Granger dabbled third year\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a long sigh, Malfoy\u2019s features flattened  \u201cI\u2026 am\u2026 married\u2026 to\u2026 Hermione.  Merlin, you two are slow on the pick-up. Now listen, from the moment you returned to a previous time, the timeline spliced. When the two of you \u2018disappeared\u2019 after setting things right, you didn\u2019t  actually  disappear; time is not circular, you didn\u2019t go right back to that moment in an endless loop. Those two versions of you continued on in the timeline that would have been. My being here won\u2019t affect my time until I return, but yours will. You have a real chance to put Cecily\u2019s reign to an end, which means Hermione will not be cursed at all. She\u2019ll be protected in both lines.\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cDraco\u2026\u201d  Hermione\u2019s heart pained as she took a step into the room. Her shoes squelched against the hardwood and she felt tears well in her eyes. Things were whirlpooling, now affecting her friends and her life and she felt fucking exhausted. \u201cWe can\u2019t mess with time like this. This is\u2026 it\u2019s too much. I need out.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMerlin, it hurt, like a blunt knife shoved in her belly, twisting until she felt her breath leave her painfully.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your call anymore, Hermione.\u201d Harry pinched the bridge of his nose before giving her a placating little smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want you dead in any reality. How can I help, Malfoy?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst, get the Aurors off Hermione\u2019s arse.\u201d Harry nodded in agreement, waving his hand as if it\u2019d be no problem at all. Producing a small photograph, Malfoy tossed it on the table between them. \u201cThis is what I need. It\u2019s at the Manor, most likely in the heirloom room on the second floor of the west wing. You will  not  have access to it during the party, that should be obvious. I need to get to the Manor in my younger self\u2019s stead.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRed twinged her vision and she sliced her hands in the air, magic sparking off the tips of her fingers, causing the lights to flicker. \u201cYou are  not stunning my date and impersonating him! We\u2019ll just have to figure out some other way since I seem to be the only person here with any common sense. I\u2019ll get up there.\u201d At that moment, something steeled and fortified inside of her. \u201cI promise, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe shared a meaningful look with Malfoy, both of them smiling weakly before she disappeared to change, returning and curling up on the cushion next to her possible future husband as the three of them churned over an ill-formed plan to steal a Black family heirloom from Malfoy Manor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nThere was a delightful hiss as the hot water rained over her, finally washing away the chill from being caught in the rain earlier. Steam billowed around her,\u00a0 swallowing her thoughts as her mind drifted to wandering touches. Her neck craned, letting the jets hit that spot that made her keen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMemories of the morning and being wrapped around Malfoy in her sheets flooded her mind, and then with a happy smile, she remembered the bumbling wizard from Gringotts. In the last few days, she\u2019d gone and fallen for the git, much to her own surprise.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe harsh scrape of metal against metal as the shower curtain was pulled back probably ought to have startled her, but it didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nInstead, a knowing smile graced her lips as she turned, lips seeking his without a single word spoken. Large hands molded to her waist, traveling down to her bum and filling his palms with the thick of her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnder his guidance, they were turned, her back pressed against the cool tile as the spray slapped against his shoulders and their bodies crushed against each other.  Fuck.  She wanted him. Forever. The thought of ever being parted from him physically twisted her heart and she clung tighter to him, letting their slick bodies slide easily against each other as their kiss\u2014impossibly\u2014deepened.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe ached for him, arching into him as his fingers traced the crease under her bum and teased her sex. Mouth leaving hers, his kiss traveled to her breasts, sucking her nipple between his lips, while one hand toyed with the other. Merlin, had she ever felt this fucking wanton before? She was out of her body and positively lost under his touch. Squirming and whining, her fingers threaded through his soaked blond locks and she pulled him back up to her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fully aware\u2014 hnunghhh \u2014\u201d she stuttered as two fingers slipped inside her, pumping slowly until she felt knees buckle. \u201cThat\u2026 well, that we\u2019ve crossed some lines here already. But, you\u2019ve a wife, and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a soft protesting rumble in the back of his throat as he pulled back, hand stilling as he stared at her with a flat expression. \u201cHermione Granger, if the you in twenty years could go back and fuck the younger version of me, I guarantee you\u2019d do it. You think you\u2019re someone different than her, but you\u2019re not. Not to me. And trust me, you\u2019d indulge.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer gaze flickered between his blown pupils and she gnawed on her lip for a moment before deciding that not only would she shag the younger Malfoy if given the opportunity, but she would also make sure to forgive her husband in the future for doing the same. That had to count for something, right?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed, rolling her hips on his fingers and fuck it all, but he smirked before claiming her mouth. One hand slid easily over her slippery skin, stopping to roll her nipple. A soft growl rumbled against her skin and his fingers, sadly, slipped from inside her. Both rough hands then trailed around the curve of her spine, grabbing her arse and lifting her so that her ankles could lock around his lower back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith more care and skill than Hermione could ever pray to possess, he carried them from the shower. In a few long strides, she was trapped under his body as they fell on top of her duvet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe tip of his cock teased her entrance as their still slick bodies slipped easily against each other, soaking the duvet. Their lips parted only when he began inching inside of her, sinking so slowly that she could feel each push of his hips. Her eyes rolled back as she arched off the bed, wanting  more-more-more even as he hilted himself inside her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco,\u201d she managed between broken breaths, nails digging into the thick muscles of his back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis face buried in the crook of her neck, droplets of water dripping from his hair hit her cheek as he sucked on the tender spot just  there  and then pulled out only to slam into her again in a single thrust. Muffling her cry with the rough skin of his neck, where the scar mangled his porcelain complexion, she lost herself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne hand slid down the gentle curve of her thigh, finding the crook of her knee and bringing it higher so he could hit that spot that made her fucking  keen.  Writhing underneath him, she let him do it  all,  each thrust and roll of his hips bringing her closer, closer, closer still.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen she felt nearly boneless, he pulled back onto his haunches, his cock still buried inside her as he seated her bum on his lap and began driving into her with a renewed vigor, his thumb easily finding her thrumming clit.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDr-Draco\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked as she crested, every last muscle tensing as a powerful orgasm flooded her body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, love,\u201d he managed through labored breaths, falling back over her and finding her ear through her wild mane of her curls.  \u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHer heart fissured in the best way, quaking and shaking, and as all her limbs wrapped around him, she didn\u2019t\u2014 couldn\u2019t\u2014 stop the confession from slipping past her lips. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFingers stilling over a teardrop earring, Hermione caught sight of Draco behind her. He was wearing denims and a Hufflepuff t-shirt she\u2019d bought for him at the store the other day just to annoy him. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m really not.\u201d A throaty laugh rumbled through the air as he came up behind her and nuzzled his nose into her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind not to let you leave in such a gown.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBiting back a smile, Hermione finished her fussing and smoothed the cool silk of her dress against her skin. \u201cFirst of all, you bought it. Second, if you did that, how would I get the necklace you are so sure is going to save my life, hmm?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlas, my plan is foiled\u2026\u201d His lips brushed against her shoulders, fingers tracing the subtle curve of her hip. \u201cHowever, if I\u2019d known the dress looked  this  good on you, I\u2019d never have bought it for you to wear with another man.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \u201cNot  another man. You. Just a better-looking version of you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would take offense to that, witch, except that I already know I\u2019m far better looking now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer chin tucked into her chest and she let out a dry laugh, mind wandering to the night ahead whilst unable to stop herself from replaying the night before. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just us. And I know that doesn\u2019t mean much to you yet, but we\u2019re good together. Better than good. Just cut the poor sod some slack when he inevitably puts his foot in his mouth, yeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomehow, I\u2019ve got to get away from him and through that massive house. I have no idea how I\u2019m going to do it\u2026\u201d She\u2019d been so overly confident the day before, so sure that nothing would stand in her way when she put her mind to something. But now, in a dress made for a witch with far more confidence, and a tremble in her limbs, she wondered how on Earth she was going to pull it off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAsk him to take you there.\u201d Draco shrugged.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRolling her eyes, Hermione snorted and leaned back against his broad chest. \u201cBrilliant. Say, Malfoy, mind showing me up to where you keep your precious family heirlooms? I want to steal one.  And  you forget, I can\u2019t say anything to him. Not even if I wanted to.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean  why?  That stupid oath! I can\u2019t say anything to anyone who\u2019s not directly involved in the\u2026\u201d Her voice drifted away, brows furrowing as pieces began clicking to place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere she is! Brightest witch and all that.\u201d Draco grinned, swatting her encouragingly on the bottom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco! I can tell you! Or rather,  him . It\u2019s still you! Oh, you\u2019re brilliant!\u201d She turned, eyes bright and grinning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs I often try to tell you, you just never listen.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA knock rapped on the door and Hermione squealed\u2014she actually squealed. Pressing her painted lips to his cheeks, she rushed for the front room and smoothed her dress one final time. With a long, fortifying exhale, she opened the door and her breath hitched at the sight of the man waiting for her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTall and lean, hair neatly styled, his face was turned down to his shoes. His robes fit him  perfectly , made for him and him alone with crisp black lines and a perfectly knotted tie. In his hands was a bouquet of calla lilies and a genuine grin curved her lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt that, his chin lifted, gaze traveling along the subtle curves of her body until finally resting on her face. Sucking in a cracked breath, he smirked. But it wasn\u2019t the one she was used to, there was no smugness, no thinly veiled insult waiting\u2014he was nervous.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger,\u201d he said with a gulp, proferring the white flowers to her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe simple words lanced through her, breathing new life into her lungs. Suddenly, she could see it: a life with him that was full of bickering and jabs but also nights filled with quiet and good books, traveling and exploring and learning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a strange inevitability to it all. As if the last decade, all the moving pieces\u2014bad and good\u2014were guiding them together. And even if the roadblocks changed, they were still driving forward, towards each other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t clean up so bad yourself.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cReady for tonight? I was thinking we\u2019d Floo into the study and have a celebratory drink first if that\u2019s alright by you.\u201d Shoving his hands deep in his trouser pockets, there was a serious set to his mouth that felt off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCelebratory?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, Granger.\u201d A lopsided smile pulled at the corner of his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re finally giving me a chance.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA furious blush stained her cheeks as she bit back a smile. \u201cI can\u2019t do this if you\u2019re going to be like,\u201d she paused to wave in his general direction, \u201cthat all night. Can\u2019t you just make fun of my hair or my swottiness or something? Break the ice?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA chuckle rumbled from deep in his chest and his smirk widened. \u201cYou could always start. You haven\u2019t called me a prat or git at all, you\u2019re equally to blame.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRolling her eyes, she stepped aside so that he could enter, muttering a low, \u201cPrat.\u201d. But he didn\u2019t pass her, instead, he paused and stepped into her until her back was pressed against the door and their noses were nearly bumping.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if we broke the ice a different way?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-oh?\u201d Heat billowed off him, warming her until she was nearly fucking panting. Cradling her cheek, he gently tilted her face, his thumb dragging along the sharp line of her jaw. His silver gaze darkened, moving from her parted lips to her eyes, a silent question crinkling the corner of his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never told me if this was a date or if I was just escorting you. And I\u2019d really planned to play it by ear\u2014but, Merlin, that dress on you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnxiety swelled and crashed in her chest and the hand that was resting on the doorknob tightened, the free one coming up to rest on his chest. \u201cI suppose it could be a date\u2026 if you wanted. Although, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m not very good at dates so maybe\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe swallowed her rambling, pillowing her lips with his impossibly soft kiss. Inhaling sharply through his nose, he took another step, his body pressing hard into her. And she couldn\u2019t help but smile against his lips. It was tender\u2014 tentative,  like at any moment he was waiting for a hex or a punch, both of which he\u2019d received from her on various occasions over the past decade.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir lips parted and he stepped away as if nothing had happened. Eyes wide, Hermione steadied herself with a breath before swallowing. \u201cThat is certainly one way to break the ice, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all sorts of tricks up my sleeve, Granger. Potter said he handled your pesky little Auror problem?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep. Sorry if you were wanting to see Jacobs or Haverfield in a tux\u2014it\u2019s just me tonight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to do, I suppose.\u201d With a sly wink, he retreated as she caught her lip between her teeth and stifled a laugh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet me grab my things, I\u2019ll be just a moment and we can go.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCrossing the small room, she slid into a crack in her bedroom door and nearly barked out a laugh at the glowering Malfoy laying on her bed. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky I don\u2019t hex him. Kissing my wife\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re insufferable, truly. However, you\u2019re not a bad kisser at twenty-three.\u201d His lip curled into a sneer and she chuckled to herself as she gathered her wrap and clutch, safely stowing her wand inside. \u201cAny advice on how to tell him that I\u2019ve been stowing away his older self in my flat for a week or that I need to steal his family heirlooms?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d lead with that.\u201d He winked as she waved and said a quiet goodbye, returning to her much younger date in the other room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe paused, studying the tense hold to his shoulders as he studied the knick-knacks on her mantle. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTurning, his lips curled in a lopsided smile and he nodded. \u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: As always, thank you for reading!! And to my wonderful Alpha and Beta, MCal and DreamsofDramione, you both are angels and I send you all the heart eye emojis.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tremor crawled through her muscles, causing her shoulders to shake violently as she stared wide-eyed at Draco Malfoy. He seemed fully at ease, idly swirling the firewhisky in his crystal tumblr. His study was poshly decorated, almost modern in a way.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? If it\u2019s because I kissed you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cNo!\u201d  She all but shouted, then quickly slinked back into the sofa in shame. \u201cNo, I liked that. That was\u2014nice.\u201d Flinching away from her anticlimactic word choice, she noticed Draco begin silently chuckling across from her. \u201cIt was  very nice.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe silence stretched on and on as she stared at random points of interest around his study. \u201cYou said you normally don\u2019t bring anyone to these types of events.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, no.\u201d He barked out a laugh as he finished his drink. \u201cIt\u2019d be an absolute nightmare. If I were to bring someone to these things, the press\u2014and my mother\u2014get all sorts of ideas.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat sort of ideas?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat I\u2019m serious about them.\u201d He shrugged, rising to his feet and making his way towards the small wet bar.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA smile stretched across her painted lips. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t mind if they think you\u2019re serious about me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis shoulders tightened and he took a long moment, faced away, before he finally returned, decanter in hand so he could top off her drink. Clearing his throat, he took his seat again, this time with a serious expression as he stared back at her. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind if they think I\u2019m serious about you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll of a sudden, her throat felt too tight and her skin too hot. He was taking a risk by bringing her, one that she hadn\u2019t fully understood, and she had secrets\u2014 big secrets. Secrets like she\u2019d slept with someone else\u2014or rather him\u2014in the wee hours that very morning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she managed, swallowing too much firewhisky immediately after.\n\u00a0\nHis gaze tightened, fighting back a smile from behind the rim of his glass. \u201cYou\u2019d have made an alright Slytherin, Granger, but a far superior Ravenclaw. Surely, you can surmise the rest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGaze falling to her lap, Hermione tried her best to steel her nerves. \u201cDraco, I should tell you something\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe scoffed. \u201cWhat do you mean  no?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t tell me right now. If you still want to tell me, tell me later.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat was a dangerous offer, one that allotted her too much time to chicken out and revel in his company. \u201cIt\u2019s important and something you should know before we continue on and people think you\u2019re serious about me\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know everything I need to know about you. I wouldn\u2019t have asked you here if I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d He rose swiftly from his seat, depositing his glass on the end table and closing the button on his jacket. Offering her his palm, Hermione stared at it for far too long. She should tell him. There was no question. But instead, her jaw snapped shut and she laid her fingers in his.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey spoke quietly as they moved through the halls of the Manor, finally emerging on a landing looking down on a grand entry. Her breath caught as they stood at the top of the wide staircase leading into the foyer. Clusters of guests lingered outside the ballroom where the constant thrumming of idle chatter lilted through the air.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNervous, Granger?\u201d A warm palm came down on the curve of her spine, and she chanced a look in his direction, catching the end of an encouraging smile as he readied himself for the party below.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad  and there\u2019s a lot of alcohol.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOffering his elbow, Hermione couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to herself as she wound her arm through his. \u201cYou know, as awful as you were in school, part of me hoped you were going to ask me to the Yule Ball. So, this is all a very strange teenage fantasy of mine come to life.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir steps synced as they descended the stairs, his gaze snapping to hers. \u201cYou wanted  me  to ask  you?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so shocked, Malfoy. You were a right an utter arse, but you were pretty fit. I don\u2019t think there was a single girl in the school who wasn\u2019t secretly hoping you\u2019d ask them. And  still,  you chose Pug-faced Parkinson.\u201d Rolling her eyes, she bit back a smile, enjoying the gaping look on her date\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA few bright flashes from the cameras waiting at the foot of the stairs stole their attention, and with a quiet cough, she fixed a bright smile on her face. Malfoy followed her lead. They paused there a minute as the press took their photograph until finally, he leaned in, his breath tickling a wayward curl.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought you were the prettiest girl at Hogwarts that night,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand every night after. Once I locked that brooding oaf, Krum, in a broom closet so he couldn\u2019t make it to the library to see you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA blush bloomed on her cheeks and she laughed quietly as Malfoy led her through the throngs of reporters and into the ballroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nDinner was delicious, the pudding, too. Their champagne flutes were never empty and she spent the night nearly doubled over in laughter, wiping happy tears from the corner of her eyes as Theo and Malfoy attempted to best each other with the most embarrassing secrets. During which, she\u2019d learned that Theo Nott had actually lost his virginity to Milicent Bulstrode, and Harry immediately said that it was no wonder he never again returned to women. She also learned that Draco Malfoy had kissed\u2014with tongue\u2014Blaise Zabini on a dare.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt some point, Draco\u2019s hand had come to rest on the back of her chair, his thumb rubbing soft circles on her shoulder blade. It was innocuous enough, barely noticeable if not looking for it. But the simple gesture was something the older Draco had done along her thigh and she was reminded with a jolt why she was here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA shadow fell over the table and every set of eyes snapped to the newcomer, Cecily Sanders, dressed to kill in a formal black gown and crimson lips. Her eyes danced with fire as she fixed her gaze on Hermione.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood evening, Unspeakable Sanders,\u201d Malfoy said politely, rising to his feet alongside Theo. Hermione and Harry remained seated, both glaring back at the beautiful witch in question.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor a splinter of a second, Cecily\u2019s gaze flickered to Draco. \u201cAuror Malfoy. This year\u2019s event is even more grand than the last. Your mother has outdone herself.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs she always strives to do.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was wondering if I might have a moment with Miss Granger?\u201d Cecily\u2019s black stare returned to Hermione and her stomach lurched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Hermione said quietly, turning towards Draco with a polite nod.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFollowing Cecily a few paces away, Hermione tried to silence her rioting nerves. There was something about the hard edge of her glare; they were both playing the same game but Hermione had the ill feeling that Cecily Sanders had more pieces than she did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnspeakable Sa\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSave your well rehearsed lies for someone else, Miss Granger.\u201d The Unspeakable\u2019s lips curled in a disdainful sneer and a fresh surge of rage bloomed to life in Hermione\u2019s chest. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing here. I know what you\u2019re after and that you\u2019ve finagled your way out of your Auror protection.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA loud, indignant scoff pushed past Hermione\u2019s lips and she rolled her eyes. \u201cBullshite, Sanders. Protection? We both know full and well that\u2019s not what they were doing.\u201d Taking a hard step into her, Hermione fixed a hard cut to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m here with my date to enjoy a lovely party. If you have a problem with that\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a big fucking problem with that. You see, it\u2019s all too coincidental that with the situation being what it is that you\u2019ve decided to strike up a romantic relationship with the one person who might be able to save your sorry arse.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCecily knew. Malfoy was right.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, Unspeakable Sanders, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to. My sorry arse is just fine for the time being. I\u2019d be far more concerned with your own.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFull lips parted, ready to spit out another nasty retort when a gentle hand brushed her arm and Malfoy came to stand at her side. \u201cCare to dance?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStartled from the moment, Hermione offered him a weak smile as they turned for the dance floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d Cecily shouted at her back. Blood boiling, Hermione turned, lips pursed into a tight line. \u201cIt would be a grave error to think just because you\u2019ve dismissed your protection detail that the Department of Ministries is not taking extra special care in your case.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a tight throat and a sharp inhale, Hermione forced a smile on her face. \u201cNoted.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer mind wandered, replaying the conversation as she was led through a thick crowd of people. Before she knew it, she was pulled into a formal waltz, falling quickly in step with him. It took all her strength to focus on this moment, which deserved all her attention. Because while a future Hermione might live on with her husband,  this  Hermione still needed hers. His palm burned through the crimson silk of her dress and after a moment, she was tugged a step closer, his lips tugging into a smirk as he stared down at her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is awfully close for a gentleman,\u201d she breathed, ignoring the thundering of her heart in her ribcage.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find I\u2019ll play hard and loose with the term. For instance, I can most certainly lead you through a proper waltz  but  I have absolutely no control of my left hand.\u201d As he spoke, his fingers dipped to the curve of her bum, seeming to search for something as his brows furrowed. \u201cMy, my, Granger. If I\u2019m not mistaken, you aren\u2019t wearing any knickers. Cheeky little witch.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer jaw fell open, eyes rounding at his crass\u2014albeit, true\u2014statement. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas, Malfoy. This material doesn\u2019t go well with knickers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got all sorts of ideas, love. But zero expectations, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Despite what was said, his gaze darkened and his mouth drifted dangerously close. Over his shoulder, Hermione\u2019s gaze caught on Cecily, standing at the fringe of the dance floor with a murderous glare and a champagne flute at her lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we get some air?\u201d she managed, her chest suddenly far too tight. Her gaze flickered nervously over her date\u2019s shoulder, landing on Harry, who said nothing, instead folding his lips into a tight smile. He rose from his seat, closing the buttons on his jacket as he nodded to a few well placed Aurors around the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d When she returned her attention to her date, she found his brows furrowed and a serious set to his mouth. Hands dropping away, he quickly escorted her from the ballroom. With each step, her nerves heightened, painful bursts fluttering to life in her chest as dozens of eyes followed them from the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut her attention was elsewhere, tracking Cecily Sanders being approached by Harry and two other Aurors. She couldn\u2019t hear what Harry said, but she knew well enough when Cecily\u2019s eyes widened to saucers and her jaw dropped. Their gazes locked a final time, Hermione dipping her chin quickly at the Unspeakable before being ushered gently from the room. Harry bought her the most coveted commodity: time.\n\u00a0\nThe cold air nipped at her skin on the back veranda, sobering her, and for a quiet moment, she took in the sprawling gardens, peppered with tiny golden lights under a clear night sky. Truth set heavy and ugly and  painful  on her chest, and she sucked in a stunted breath as she tried to make sense of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAbsently, she rubbed at the prickled gooseflesh spreading on her arms, lost in the haze of her own thoughts. A thick jacket was draped over her shoulders, a warm breath following, ghosting across her neck.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid I do something? You know I was just being a prat earlier\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA soft chuckle slipped past her lips and she tugged the front of his jacket closed. \u201cYou\u2019re  always  a prat.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAppearing in the side of her vision, hands shoved in his trouser pockets and gaze locked forward, he spoke quietly,  seriously  . \u201cAfter all these years, I\u2019m still utterly intimidated by you, Granger. And sometimes, when intimidated, I slip into the kid I was. I\u2014\u201d he paused, inhaling sharply through his nose. \u201cI hope you know that\u2019s not  really  who I am.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThoughts of the man he\u2019d become and the hard times he\u2019d shelter her from floated across her mind and a small smile graced her lips. \u201cFunny enough, I do. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco, dear?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer words drifted away in the night air as Narcissa Malfoy appeared in the giant door frame behind them, calling for her son. An ache settled deep in her gut and she dipped her chin towards his mother with a tight smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d he mumbled from the corner of his mouth, retreating and leaving his jacket still wrapped around her shoulders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMerlin, the moment stretched on, quiet rumblings finding her ears until finally, Draco groaned and trudged back towards his date. \u201cMy mother requires my assistance inside. Do you want to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait here,\u201d she rushed, guilt climbing up her throat disguised as bile that threatened to betray her. This was it.  Third floor of the west wing and back.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be back as quick as I can.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLips pulling into a thin smile, she tucked her chin into her chest to hide the tears welling in the corner of her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t rush.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe crossed the room, disappearing into the crowd with a final smirk over his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs soon as he was out of sight, she buried her guilt and pulled the photo from her clutch, staring at it intently for a long moment. A small voice, growing louder by the minute, implored her to wait for him, to just tell him what was happening but\u2014she couldn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwisting her wand just so at the photo, she cast her spell in a low whisper.  \u201cAvenseguim.\u201d The image folded in on itself, making a small airplane and twirling in front of her face for a moment. \u201cDiscreetly, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Bobbing up and down in an almost nod, the airplane zipped down the few stairs and followed a cobbled path hugging the back of the house.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe followed its steady flight for several minutes, its wings happily curling in the evening breeze as it tracked forward. Her paranoia, however, screamed with each click of her heels against the stones. Somehow, she\u2019d gotten herself so caught up in this mess of time travel that she\u2019d lost sight of the very obvious issue at hand, which was that she was robbing the Malfoys. Hugging Draco\u2019s coat tighter around her, she spied a smaller veranda near what she assumed was the western wing of the house. Nearly there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe small plane hovered over the glass panes on the door, much smaller and far less grand than the ones on the back of the foyer. Its nose bumped into the surface several times, before taking a large loop up and around, poking her hard in the back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOuch! I get it, alright! I\u2019m going\u2026\u201d Knowing better, she tried the handle, finding it dutifully locked. Pointing her wand at it next and ignoring the ever-persistent plane ramming her shoulder, she steadied her voice with a long breath.  \u201cAlohomora.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nFrowning, she found the handle still locked and tried one more time.  \u201cAlohomora.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nA loud  crack  from her left sounded and two house elves in smart little tuxedos with brightly colored bow ties appeared, eyes wide as they stared at one of their guests trying to break into their house. They didn\u2019t say a word, not even as Hermione\u2019s hand shot out for them and she cried into the darkness when they simply Disapparated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she hissed, turning in a flurry, looking for the way she\u2019d come. Of course, she  should  have known better, but she\u2019d gone and followed a bleeding paper airplane on her quest without taking any wards or locking charms into consideration. Bugger it all.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA quieter  pop  pierced the air, and with it, her heart plummeted. She froze, shoulders rising up to her ears as she awaited a hex\u2026 or worse.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger?\u201d  Worse, then.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nA tremble began in her chest, quaking through her limbs violently. She couldn\u2019t move.  Couldn\u2019t breathe. \n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger?\u201d he repeated, his voice lower and laced with worry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKnees buckling, she turned, tears welling in her eyes as she stared back at him, jacket-less, hands shoved in his pockets. \u201cDon\u2019t hate me,\u201d she breathed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy on earth would I hate you? Did you get turned around or\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need your help, Draco.\u201d Clenching her eyes shut, she steeled herself for the rest of it. \u201cAnd you very well  might  hate me after.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe corners of his eyes crinkled, the silver darkening as he took a step towards her. Another hard poke from the airplane and she could almost  hear  it groaning at her ineptitude, before zooming past her and prodding at the door again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d she chuckled, tucking a curl behind her ear and kicking at the stones at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s all such a mess.\u201d Voice cracking, she felt a familiar sting in her chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe snorted, clearly becoming agitated at the encounter as he gestured wildly at her. \u201cMaybe at the beginning? For fucks sake, it can\u2019t be that bad\u2014can it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a final hard swallow, she tipped her chin up to him and locked her gaze onto his. \u201cLast week, I was called to the Department of Mysteries. Unspeakable Sanders swore me to an oath of confidentiality, so I haven\u2019t been able to speak to it about anyone outside the case.\u201d For the first time in days, her tongue and teeth moved freely, the truth falling past her lips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you have Aurors following you? So, what changed? Why can you suddenly speak about it now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I have Aurors following me around. And, nothing changed, except that I realized I could have told  you  all along.\u201d A thin, slick coat of sweat covered her palms as a  whooshing  filled her ears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe?\u201d Another step towards her and she could feel the tension thick around them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou see, funny enough, someone fell through the Tempus Motus in the Time Room. I was called down because the man that came through was from twenty years in the future and demanded to speak to me before anyone else.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026Okay?\u201d Confusion was still plainly painted over his features and he was suddenly close enough that she could see the flecks of blue peppered in his grey eyes, the dim light casting a hazy golden glow on one side of his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe man that came through claimed to be my husband, twenty years from now at least. He was\u2014 is  \u2014you. The future version of you fell through time and you did so to get this\u2014\u201d Flicking her wand at the persistent little airplane still crashing against the windowpane, she summoned it back to her side.  \u201cFinite.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith trembling fingers, she peeled open its folds and presented it to him. There was a long, tenuous moment of silence as he studied it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the future, at least that version of it, I\u2019ve been cursed. I\u2014well, I\u2019m dying, and apparently you weren\u2019t exactly keen on that happening. So, you came back for me, for this necklace, rather. It\u2019s supposed to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know what it does, Granger.\u201d His voice was tight, strained to the point it sounded painful. \u201cSo, this alternate version of me is where exactly?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt my flat. He\u2026  you  have been, mostly, since the day you arrived\u2014not that you\u2019re very pleasant about it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re married? How\u2019re you sure it\u2019s even really me?\u201d His voice carried a trace of awe, or maybe it was disbelief, but his eyes still hadn\u2019t lifted from the photograph.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA dry laugh filled the air as her eyes widened. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m sure and yes. Married almost seventeen years, it seems. We seem happy, from what you say. We have a house in the French countryside and I\u2019ve just announced my bid for Minister of Magic, which is why Cecily Sanders has seen fit to curse me, the stupid bint. And, you know how I like my breakfast on the weekends and how I take my tea. You\u2019re still driving me crazy, even two decades later, which doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest\u2026\u201d A tear streaked from the corner of her eye and she sucked in a watery breath, desperate for him to hear it all and fall as madly in love with the idea of  them  as she had. \u201cWe\u2019re in love.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe taut muscles of his neck flexed as he swallowed, his eyes finally flicking up and locking on hers. He remained painfully quiet, studying her for long, immeasurable moments. Finally, when she felt her chest was going to actually burst, he turned on his heel and easily turned the door handle that had given her so much trouble, holding it open and gesturing for her to step through.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBreathing a deep sigh of relief, she followed suit, entering the west wing and following him on a quiet trek through several halls, finally pausing at a pair of double doors with intricate runes engraved on the surface. With a knitted brow and a downward turn to his mouth, he pushed them open.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUpon entering, her breath caught at the sheer number of items in the vast room: case after case of beautiful jewelry, magical artifacts, and statues. Hermione moved farther into the room, though Draco remained near the door, hands clasped in front of him. Approaching a few mannequins standing tall against the far wall, her jaw fell open as she studied the stunning vintage robes, delicate threading woven in complicated patterns.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNext to those sat a table of tiaras, each one encrusted with gems of every size, shape, and color. Then she saw a case of books so old they must have been handed down for generations and generations, after that was an array of medieval weapons and wands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is all so incredible,\u201d she breathed, brows lifting as she made a small turn in the room.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem at all shocked that we end up together.\u201d He was still\u2026  strained.  The lilt of his voice didn\u2019t sit well with her and a whole coven of pixies erupted in her belly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was. I didn\u2019t believe it, honestly.\u201d A half-smile graced her lips as she happened upon rows of rings behind a glass enclosure. Idly, she tried to pick out the one Malfoy gave her, her eyes catching on a large, clear diamond near the back nestled in a bed of rubies. \u201cBut, you\u2019re very convincing,\u201d she mumbled from the corner of her mouth, turning her back on the jewelry and smiling fondly at him. \u201cThe things you\u2019ve told me about the life we have, I hardly think you\u2019d make them up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe weight of his gaze seared into her, a fevered flush crawling up her neck and staining her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit odd that you know me so intimately,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to believe any of this at all.\u201d Moving towards the far wall, he pulled open a drawer and lifted the black opal from its resting place, holding it out to her as if it were nothing more than a dime-store necklace.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Her mouth ran dry as she crossed the room to him, studying the giant gem up close.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe huffed and pushed it at her. \u201cIf you need it that badly, it\u2019s yours. At least it was given freely.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Malfoy,\u201d she said earnestly, her shoulders sagging as she took it from him and stowed it safely in her bag. \u201cYou are making yourself very happy right now.\u201d She laughed easily, but found his presence still tight and unsure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you call him Draco?\u201d His gaze fluttered between her eyes, taking in every small detail, seeming to catalog it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe gulped. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m not annoyed with him, which I usually am.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does he call you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA happy smile fought to break free. \u201cUsually, you call me love, though I fought you on it for a good few days. When you\u2019re being cheeky it\u2019s darling. Sometimes it\u2019s still Granger and, even more rare than that, Hermione.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeering at her through half-lidded lashes, his lips twitched in a barely-there smirk, before falling into a displeased turn again. \u201cHas he kissed you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere it was, that sinking pit in her stomach, twisting and gnawing at her insides until she felt she might vomit it all out onto their shoes. \u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe turned, waving him off, but his hand shot out and wrapped around her slender wrist, halting her.  \u201cYou  don\u2019t call me Draco. Has he? It\u2019s just a question, Granger. A pretty easy one in the grand scheme of you almost robbing me of my grandmothers necklace tonight.\u201d There was an angry edge to his voice that at one time felt familiar, a lifetime ago when he was still an angry kid, but it\u2019d been so long since she heard it that she recoiled from him entirely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin,  Malfoy.  Can you lay off a bit?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn exaggerated snort escaped him and he moved too fast, cutting into her route and causing her to halt. \u201cHe kissed you! The fucking prat\u2026\u201d There was a disgusted twist to his features before realization seemed to slam into him. \u201cDid you fuck him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHermione\u2019s head cocked back, hand twitching to slap or hex him, before tightening into a hard fist instead.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe blood drained from his face, lips parting in utter disbelief as he fell back two steps. \u201cYou actually slept with him\u2014 with me?\u201d \n\u00a0\nAngry tears crept over the rim of her eyes and she batted furiously at them, trying to wipe them from existence. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s just anyone, it\u2019s you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah!\u201d he shouted, regaining his stature and sneering at her. \u201cThat\u2019s the fucking point, Granger! You fucked me, without me knowing. You\u2019ve now already had that experience, so let\u2019s say that this grand life that was awaiting us still panned out\u2014you took something from us! From me! How would you feel if I already knew you intimately? Already seen you naked? It\u2019s a violation of  my  privacy!\u201d Draco paused, running an agitated hand through his hair. \u201cYour little play-husband? He\u2019s going back to his wife, and you? Well, you\u2019ve got one very pissed off Malfoy who can barely stand to look at you right now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEach word gashed into her heart, leaving it bleeding and broken as she tried to form words with a trembling jaw and soaked cheeks. \u201cDraco, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n \u201cIs that why you came with me tonight?\u201d His voice was acidic, face pinched in revulsion. \u201cIt had nothing to do with me, or any future that we might have together, did it? Merlin, I thought you might actually fucking liked me!\u201d Hands slicing through the air, he marched over to the looming fireplace and grabbed the bag of Floo powder off the mantle. \u201cGo, Granger.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDraco, I  do  like you! I know it sounds crazy, but I love\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare fucking say that. You don\u2019t know me. You know some time-traveling version of me that will now never happen anyway, so go back to him. Take your jewelry, take whatever you want, just fucking go.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her. Dropping the bag back where it\u2019d sat, he stormed from the room, the doors slamming shut in his wake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nStepping through her Floo, a sullen drag to her features and mascara stained cheeks, her eyes drifted towards the empty spot on the couch. After kicking off her heels, she made a weary trudge to her bedroom. On her bed, Draco was dozing, a book spread open on his chest and his lips barely parted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe crossed the room and perched in her fancy dress on the edge of the bed. He\u2019d be leaving soon. This strange, silver-haired husband of hers that she\u2019d gotten to borrow for a week. It was still him, the Draco from moments before that yelled at her until his face was pink, but the one very big difference was that the one in her bed already knew that he was in love with her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSure, Malfoy might fancy her currently, but he didn\u2019t love her, not even close. Clicking open her clutch, she withdrew the necklace that this man had traveled through space and time for and rested it gently on his chest. Her fingers lingered, splayed against him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlinking awake, he squinted back at her, smiling groggily until he noticed her tear-stained cheeks and waterlogged lashes. \u201cLove? What happened?\u201d Pushing up, his hand caught hers and he startled, feeling the cool temperature of the necklace under his fingers. \u201cYou got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. I got it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis brows furrowed, one hand coming up to cradle her cheek and she couldn\u2019t help but press into the gentle touch, her breath stuttering as she struggled to steady it. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLifting her teary gaze to his, she tried her best to smile, but instead, her lips fell into a trembling frown. \u201cI lost you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\n A/N: AH! We are almost at the end! I can\u2019t believe it and I want to shout it into the universe how thankful I am that you\u2019ve all enjoyed this story! I wish it was longer so I could write more of it haha but alas, Zaddy Malfoy has a wife to return to so this story must sadly draw to a close. I will get the next chapter ASAP! I promise not to keep you waiting! \n\n\u00a0\n\n As always thanks to MCal and DreamsofDramione! Extra special shout to MCal who took a second pass at a chunk I added to this last minute. Please forgive any errors, I change stuff after my lovely beta picks at it so all the remaining misplaced comma\u2019s and poor uses of \u201cit\u2019s\u201d are mine.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n Be back soon! LK \n\n\n\n\n\nWaking, still wrapped in fine silk with a warm hard body curled around her, Hermione flinched away from the memories crashing behind her clenched lids: visceral visions of how she\u2019d totally and utterly fucked things up the night before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco shifted behind her, his hand curling around her waist and face nuzzling into the curls splayed over the pillow. She chuckled and turned in his arms, peeking up at him through puffy eyelids.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t my hair bother you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said around a yawn, tightening his hold on her. \u201cBut, it\u2019s become almost another person in our relationship, and I find that in order to be next to you, I must tolerate  it.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nA surprising laugh pushed past her lips and she batted as his chest, pulling herself from his arms to sit on the edge of the bed. But again, a heavy weight settled on her shoulders and she felt her very soul sag.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, love. He\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Draco moved behind her, resting his forehead on her exposed shoulders. Since she\u2019d explained the volatile situation the night before, he\u2019d been careful of how he touched her. Holding her as she cried herself to sleep, but never kissing her, not even a single straying touch, and for that, she was thankful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat she\u2019d had with him was special, something she would never forget, but it was over. Especially if she wanted to patch things up with the only Malfoy she was about to have left.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Left.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nHunching under the weight of a tangible pain, her gut twisted and her chest tightened until her breath was only coming in tight wheezes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was going to leave her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSoon.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower,\u201d she croaked, quickly rushing for the bathroom and pressing the door shut, resting her forehead against it as she sucked in greedy lungfuls of air. From the other side, she could hear a muffled groan followed by footsteps leading out of the bedroom and her heart splintered, a piece of it going with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nFreshly showered, Hermione stared at herself in the foggy mirror. Splotchy pink cheeks and sodden curls stared back at her. Long gone was the pretty, done up witch from the night before.\n\u00a0\nAfter drying her hair and applying minimal makeup to ready herself for the day ahead, she left the bathroom. Slipping into a comfortable pair of denims and her favorite jumper, she exited to the front room, finding Draco at the window, handing a treat to an owl before it quickly flew off into the late Sunday morning light.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid something arrive?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe turned, eyes misty and a weak smirk on his lips. Shaking his head, he rose to stand, and she noticed that he\u2019d changed into the same outfit he\u2019d worn when he\u2019d arrived. \u201cNo, sending something off.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d Her throat closed, unable to speak the words into existence. Tears pricked the back of her eyes and she supposed she ought to just get used to being a tear-stained wreck for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLips quirking in that way only his could, he held his arms out for her. \u201cIt\u2019s time, love.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut her feet were rooted to the floor and she fought to keep from sobbing as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s too soon. You could stay the day and leave tomorrow. I could take you to the Ministry myself and make sure you get back\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, love,\u201d he crooned, crossing the room to band his thick arms around her. Pressing his lips into her hair, she felt her tears stain his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. Don\u2019t worry about me. Although, I admit, I\u2019m going to miss you. I forgot how tenacious and fiery you were before\u2014you still are, by the way, just not always at me.\u201d A throaty laugh rumbled from his chest and into hers as she buried her face deeper, sucking in the familiar scent of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d she cried, breaths broken and ugly as she wrapped her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019re such a stupid prat. You come back here and make me fall in love with you and then just\u2026 then just\u2026  leave.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cI was never meant to stay, love.\u201d His lips brushed her temple before he rested his chin on the top of her curls. \u201cBesides, you\u2019ve got stuff to do. You\u2019ve got a man to win back, a corrupt Unspeakable to put into Azkaban, and I\u2014well, I\u2019ve got a wife who needs me. And I very much need her.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCradling her cheeks between his palms, he tilted her face up to his, studying her with a deep reverence. She brought her hands up to wrap around his forearms and felt the static of their magic flare to life. Gasping, her eyes locked on his.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe do that sometimes when we have to part. Our magic doesn\u2019t like it when we\u2019re separated\u2014it can always tell when we say goodbye.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be without you,\u201d she confessed, lashes fluttering shut as fresh tears tracked new courses down her cheeks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA soft snicker chased his breath as he kissed her forehead and then the tip of her nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Hermione. Take some solace that in two decades, and for as many decades as we\u2019re allowed after that, I love you exponentially more. This isn\u2019t the end, love, it\u2019s the very beginning.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you, Draco,\u201d she breathed, reaching up for his face and pressing a soft kiss against the corner of his mouth. As she pulled away, he turned, catching her lips and deepening what she\u2019d started, winding his arms around her waist, breathing hope into her lungs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir lips moved frantically against each other, saying goodbye with press after press, tears coating their lips. Sucking in a sharp breath, they parted, foreheads resting together as she watched a few wayward tears stripe down his cheeks. \u201cYou know, after I heard what an absolute git I was last night, I promised myself not to cross any more lines. But maybe he\u2019ll give me this last one.\u201d He smirked, pressing a final, lingering kiss to her lips and she couldn\u2019t help but sob as he backed away, her fingers slipping from his chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn endless ache built in her chest as he made his way to his cloak on the back of the chair. \u201cWhat if Cecily arrests you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSnorting, he closed his cloak around him and gave her a wink. \u201cI\u2019ve a Portkey and a letter telling her to fuck off that I plan to leave on her desk. It\u2019s Sunday, no one will be there and I\u2019ll be landing right next to the Tempus Motus. Perks of being married to Hermione Granger and best mates with Harry-bleeding-Potter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSmiling weakly through a trembling jaw, she wrapped her arms around herself and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo find me, love. I\u2019m not that far away.\u201d He paused, breath catching as his eyes rimmed with tears yet again. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you too, more than you could possibly know.\u201d Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a small handkerchief and grinned at her.\u00a0 \u201cLove you, Granger.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBrushing his finger against the knick-knack, he was tugged away, leaving behind only a soft pucker of magic and a hollow feeling in her chest.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYesterday, she had two Draco Malfoys. Today, she had none.\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nShe wallowed a good bit, as was her prerogative she surmised. It\u2019d been a truly terrible twenty-four hours and a good bit of pure, unadulterated self-loathing seemed just the cure. Before she knew it, the sun began to dip below the horizon, signaling the end of the day, and with a hazy sort of recollection, she realized that she\u2019d not yet eaten.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPulling herself up from the center of the bed where she\u2019d curled in on herself for the afternoon, she found her limbs heavy and useless, weighing her down. Slipping on her boots, she stepped into the Floo, calling for Number Twelve Grimmauld Place as the green flames stole her away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nIf the looks on Harry and Theo\u2019s faces were anything to go by, then she looked like absolute shite.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking hell, Hermione.\u201d Harry rushed to her side, wrapping an arm around her and guiding her to the sofa. \u201cYou look like\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Harry.\u201d She held up her palm, quieting him before he put his foot in his mouth. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay, Granger?\u201d The simple use of her surname brought forth a fresh round of humiliating tears and, after kicking off her boots, she curled her legs up under her and tucked herself into Harry\u2019s side.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you still can\u2019t talk about it?\u201d Harry pressed, brows tugging together. \u201cI assume it has to do with one or two Malfoys.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe tried, but her lips froze as tears welled in her eyes and she finally just collapsed further into his arms.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe boys shared a look; Harry pulled a soft throw over her legs and Theo disappeared into the kitchen, returning with a pint of chocolate ice cream and a glass of red wine, which he offered with a sad smile.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter demolishing the pint of ice cream\u2014and the rest of their bottle of wine\u2014Hermione fell asleep, waking only slightly when Theo leaned down to kiss Harry goodnight, offering to bring her up to their guest room, which her friend declined. She drifted back off to the constant thrumming of Harry\u2019s heartbeat and the soft roar of the fireplace.\n\u00a0\nWhen she woke, it was nearly ten o\u2019clock at night. Harry was still knocked out, head fallen back and lips parted as his snores filled the room. She chuckled and shook him gently awake; she should have known better, he woke in full Auror mode, wand trained on the door as he mashed his crooked glasses on his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMerlin, Harry, it\u2019s just me.\u201d A dry laugh fell from her lips as she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to go\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? No. Stay! We\u2019re happy to have you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I need to go. First, I\u2019m starving and second, you should go up and be with Theo. I\u2019ll be alright. Might take tomorrow off though. See you Tuesday?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry stared down at her, still wary as he blinked the sleep from his eyes, but he eventually nodded. He wrapped her in a hug before waving goodbye outside Grimmauld.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter purchasing an unhealthy amount of Chinese takeaway, Hermione found a secluded corner and Apparated just down the street from her flat. The walk sobered her, cold air biting at her cheeks and she felt a sad sort of resignation settle into her bones.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHermione Granger had never been one to believe in the art of Divination, but staring up at the inky black sky peppered with stars, she had to allow herself some small bit of hope that Draco was right, that they were inevitable.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClimbing the rickety stairs, she fumbled for her wand, eyes finally lifting and catching on the blond leaning against her door. Every fibre of her being began to tremble as she made her way down the hall, the heavy thudding of her footsteps finally drawing his attention.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStopping just a few paces in front of him, she sucked in a shaky breath and smiled tightly. \u201cMalfoy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a definite air of annoyance about him, a pull to his brow and a hard edge in his silver eyes that Hermione was far too familiar with. \u201cGranger. Got a minute?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d she squeaked, suddenly far too aware of how she must look, wrinkly clothes and swollen lids. Trying her best to quell the shaking of her hand as she unlocked the door, she gestured for him to enter and then set the food on the counter, stomach-lurching as she thought of the sesame chicken buried inside.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyone else here?\u201d Malfoy asked, voice tight as he stood tall and rigid near the door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClearing her throat, she pulled her curls up on the crown of her head, a vain attempt not to look such a fright, and shook her head. \u201cUm, no. No, he went back this morning.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why you look you\u2019ve been crying all day? Sad your boyfriend left?\u201d His tone had that nasty jeering quality that she hated and her nose wrinkled at the sound of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMassaging the throbbing in her temples\u2014from wine too early in the day or Malfoy\u2019s petulant little temper, she wasn\u2019t sure\u2014she closed her eyes and let out a long breath. \u201cI\u2019m sad for lots of reasons today, Malfoy. Honestly, I haven\u2019t eaten and I\u2019m exhausted, so maybe you could just drag me a bit later in the week?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a long beat of silence and finally Malfoy stepped forward, pulling a folded letter from his robes and holding it up in the air. \u201cHave you read this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, she pulled up to look at the missive pinched between his fingers, his eyes scrutinizing her every move. \u201cHow would I know? I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you tell  him  to write it?\u201d There was an edge accusation in his tone and it made her bristle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d she repeated slowly, eyes narrowing. \u201cBut no, I didn\u2019t tell anyone to write anything that I can recall. If it\u2019s something for work, maybe I did last week? I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s from me. Well, me in twenty years, it would seem.\u201d He took a few more pointed steps forward, dropping the folded parchment in front of her.  Her  parchment, the lovely heavyweight stock that she was so fond of it with a slight pearly sheen to it. Dragging her finger across the neat scrawl, her lips quirked in a sad smile. \u201cG\u2019on\u2014read it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStaring at it for a long moment, as if expecting it to somehow transform into a howler that Malfoy wrote just to scream at her some more, she finally found the nerve to pull it open. Tears slipped through her lashes as she read.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Morning Malfoy, \n\n\u00a0\n\n Bet you\u2019re curious as to why you\u2019re receiving a note in your own penmanship, eh mate? Well, by now you know it\u2019s me\u2014or well, you. I realize that I\u2019ve made some errors in all this, but while I do (kind of) regret shagging your future wife, I also know the women you\u2019ve been shagging in recent years, so I find that my sympathy is rather thin.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n Currently, our witch is heartbroken. Not only is she losing me, but she\u2019s quite certain she\u2019s lost you as well. And for that, I simply can not stand. She is, for lack of a less kitschy term, your soulmate and losing her over something as ridiculous as this would be a grave error. \n\n\u00a0\n Maybe not for you\u2014at least not yet\u2014but she\u2019s everything, mate. She\u2019s the sun and the moon and all the bleeding stars. She changes you and challenges you and   loves you   more unconditionally than we ever thought possible, or deserve, if I\u2019m being honest. So you see, I had to come back to save her.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n I was losing her, watching her wither and forget me. And you know all too well how stubborn we are, I couldn\u2019t let that happen. \n\n\u00a0\n\n When I arrived back here, I was on a mission. I just wanted to get this bleeding necklace and get back to my wife. But, as always, Hermione Granger happened. I forgot how much I adored her when she still hated every breath I took, although some days she still does. I forgot how she looked before life had thrown us some of the hard shite.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n Listen, I know she\u2019s meant to be yours, but once\u2014she was mine. I was twenty-three and pining for the girl I was sure I\u2019d ruined all my chances with. I was desperate for moments of her time, so much so that I was also doing Potter\u2019s reports just so I\u2019d get to sit with her for a pint, knowing I was in for a night of scowling and innocent little insults. I\u2019d walk by her desk half a dozen times a day, hoping she\u2019d look up from her work, but also, strangely okay if she didn\u2019t, just so I could stare an extra minute. So you see, we are not so different you and I. \n\n\u00a0\n\n There are things you inevitably won\u2019t get to experience organically now, and for that I am sorry. But, even so, I hope you take her to the Chateau in France and let her crawl in your lap and snog you after a bit too much wine. The first time you make love to her, hell, try and show me up, kid. You\u2019ve got a lot more flight time left in your broom than I do.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n And learn from some of my mistakes\u2014yeah? Take her on a proper honeymoon, even if she fights you, and Merlin, let the woman adopt however many cats she wants. (I assure you, the witch can hold a grudge for years to come, and she never stops finding new and creative ways of reminding you of all the cats she never got to take home.) And, when you find out you can\u2019t have kids, don\u2019t let her give up. The witch was meant to be a mother and she\u2019d be a hell of a good one.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n Lastly, don\u2019t take it slow and don\u2019t fuck this up, Malfoy. You\u2019ve loved her far too long to let her go now. If you want to blame someone, blame me for being the charming son-of-a-bitch we\u2019ve been all our lives and wanting to remember my wife as she was.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n It\u2019s the truly troublesome thing about time\u2026 the more you use of it, the more you want. And in any reality, any timeline, any universe: I want more time with Hermione Granger-Malfoy. Until no other options exist, I\u2019ll keep fighting. I hope you do, too. She\u2019s worth it.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n P.S. And just in case your keen Slytherin eye is still unsure if it\u2019s really you: first you\u2019re a git, and second, that pot of Amortentia sixth year smelled like the fresh grass of a Quidditch pitch, new heavy parchment, and cinnamon. Take care.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nSwallowing through an impossibly tight throat, Hermione raised her misty gaze to him. He was no longer scowling, his gray eyes almost pained as he stared back at her, his lips pulled down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGranger, I can\u2019t speak for any other me than the one I am today. However, I do know it\u2019s fucking weird that you slept with me, but I haven\u2019t slept with you. I think it\u2019s insane that you accepted my invitation with intent to rob me of my family\u2019s ancient magical artifacts, and I think you\u2019re positively mental if you don\u2019t realize that I\u2019ve been mad over you for years.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe world stopped, time ceasing to exist in the moment that followed. Her heart, which had been thudding uselessly all day, quickened, beating to a new, frantic rhythm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, yeah. I\u2019m pretty fucking pissed, but if that letter says anything about who you and I are, and who we\u2019re meant to be, then it seems we\u2019ll probably be pissed at each other a fair amount. Which, I\u2019m perfectly able to handle if you are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA watery laugh burst past her lips and she covered her face with her hands, shaking her head in pure and utter disbelief, before dropping her palms back into her lap. \u201cYou\u2019re insane if you want to be involved with me. I\u2019m an absolute wreck and I\u2019m really quite stubborn and almost always right\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith unsurprising quickness, his hands caught her damp cheeks between his palms, in a moment so painstakingly similar to that morning. Staring up at him, she found fewer wrinkles, his hair more blond than silver, but the same gray eyes, sparkling with mischief and adoration. Tracking his thumbs over her cheekbones, he studied the curves of her face as if she were the only thing tethering him to the planet. \u201cWant to give this thing between us a shot, Granger?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBefore she\u2019d nodded once, his lips were on hers, kissing her slowly, tentatively, learning her still. His hand moved to cradle the back of her head, tugging her hard into him before suddenly letting her go.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPanting and blinking back at him, she scoffed out an indignant little noise. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRolling his eyes, he shrugged from his cloak and tossed it over the counter, then began pulling small white containers from the brown paper bag. \u201cYou said you were hungry, you twit. I\u2019m not going to ravish you on an empty stomach. Merlin\u2019s sack, did you buy all this for yourself?\u201d A mocking brow lifted high on his forehead and she swatted at him before stealing back her food.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNone for you if you\u2019re going to be cheeky, Malfoy.\u201d Sticking out her tongue in the most immature way possible, she turned for her silverware drawer only to stutter to a stop as he rushed up behind her and wrapped his arms around her middle, a familiar chuckle tickling her curls. \u201cSo, there  will be ravishing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis teeth brushed against the thin skin of her neck as he grinned, a laugh rumbling through him. \u201c Oh.  There will be many,  many  ravishings. I\u2019ve got to show that old sod up, don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBiting down on her lip, she turned in his arms, staring up at him with a challenging smirk. \u201cThat\u2019ll be hard to do, Malfoy. You\u2019ve learned quite a bit about what I like in the next twenty years, topping it might take a  lot  of practice.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMasking his features into a playful glower, he plucked the container of food from her hand, tossing it unceremoniously onto the counter. Quicker than she thought possible, he slung her over his shoulder and marched across her flat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c Malfoy! \u201d Her giggles chased away all memories of her tears as he swatted at her bum and carried her towards the bedroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve brought this upon yourself, witch. Your ravishing has been moved up to now since I\u2019ve  so  much to learn. It seems it\u2019d be best if we start right away.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFalling back on the duvet, laughing as Draco crawled over her and captured her mouth in a slow kiss, she reckoned that dinner had waited this long. Surely, it could wait a bit longer.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nBlinking into the bright sunlight of early morning, she once again felt a familiar arm draped along her middle. Half-eaten cartons of Chinese takeaway still sat open on her end table, picked through after the first bout between the sheets and stowed there before Draco had disappeared between her thighs with a smug smirk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStirring behind her, she felt his palm close around her bare breast and his erection press against her bum. Throughout the night, they\u2019d found each other again and again in the darkness, sleeping only in short spurts. While she was happy to report he had nothing to prove to anyone and very little to learn, he didn\u2019t seem to feel the same way, desperate to flood her body with as many orgasms as possible before the sun rose.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWiggling her bum against his lap, she rested back into him with a loud yawn. \u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d she mused, chuckling as his lips trailed up the long column of her exposed throat. \u201cI\u2019d already decided to Floo in sick, but you\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShifting her onto her back, he quickly crawled on top of her, settling between her thighs. The tip of his cock kissed her already slick folds and her lips parted, sucking in a sharp breath as he inched inside her. \u201cI was thinking of doing the same,\u201d he managed gruffly, sighing in relief when he was buried fully inside her. \u201cI\u2019m far too busy to be bothered with work on a day like today.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith a grin, she pulled his mouth to hers, tongues tangling and brushing as he pumped languidly inside her. He seemed to be in no rush at all, his hands slowly mapping out new explorations over every curve and dip in her body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever get tired of this? Even in twenty years?\u201d he panted, rolling his hips with his cock still deep inside her and seating her on his lap.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurls fell in a thick canopy around them as his palm skimmed up her belly and he massaged her breast. Low pleasured cries slipped over her tongue as she rocked her hips back and forth in sporadic bursts, the first twinges of an orgasm flaring to life deep in her sex. The hand toying with her nipple slipped down, rubbing his thumb over her swollen clit until she toppled over the edge, nails cutting into the sinewy muscle of his chest. With a low grunt, he picked up a frantic pace, thrusting into her until he was spent, hips stilling as she fell in a heap on top of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo answer your question, no.\u201d She grinned, drunk on euphoria and new love. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get tired of this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\nAfter sending off their owls, stating they simply couldn\u2019t make it in for work today, Hermione found herself seated on her counter, dressed in only his haphazardly buttoned oxford and a pair of knickers. Her face was pulled into a tight grimace as she watched him destroy  another  round of toast, but she held her tongue as he grumbled to himself, sure he\u2019d figure it out  this  time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere is something wrong with this contraption\u2014\u201d A scowl formed on his handsome features as he stood in only a pair of trousers that hung low on his hips.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe turned, two charred slices of toast on a plate, and she couldn\u2019t help the laugh that bubbled forth. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you figure it out eventually.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just hire house elves, forego this entire ridiculous learning curve?\u201d But upon her narrowed glare, he relented, dropping his offering into the sink and settling himself between her bare thighs. \u201cOr I\u2019ll just run out and grab some proper breakfast.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d She chuckled as his palms slid up her thighs, halting only when an angry rapping sounded at her door.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSharing a curious look, Malfoy extricated himself. Sauntering towards the door, he peered through the peephole and barked out a sharp laugh. He didn\u2019t wait for Hermione to even inquire who was there, wrenching the door open and propping his palm against its surface.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Unspeakable Sanders,\u201d he drawled, his voice oozing charm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAuror Malfoy,\u201d she deadpanned, no longer awaiting an invitation as she marched into her flat. To Cecily\u2019s credit, she seemed unfazed by finding the two of them half-dressed and surrounded by the smell of burnt toast on a Monday at half ten. \u201cMiss Granger.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in Hermione\u2019s memory, Unspeakable Sanders looked dreadful, hair askew and clothes wrinkled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Cecily. How was your weekend?\u201d Hermione beamed, knowing full well that the woman was held in holding and interrogated after being escorted from Malfoy Manor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was an angry flare behind the Unspeakable\u2019s eyes.  \u201cClearly,  not well  .  I\u2019ve been detained and when I was released your awful friend informed that the situation from last week has resolved itself and you\u2019ve been\u2026  cleared  of all suspicion\u2014though not by me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well, I suppose.\u201d Hermione shrugged, eyes flitting to the blond gripping his wand behind Cecily Sanders\u2019 shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRunning her tongue over her perfectly straight teeth, their intruder\u2019s gaze tightened. \u201cSo it would seem. I\u2019m here just to make sure you understand that any connection you\u2019ve had with the DoM is now severed, you\u2019re not to step foot into the department unless summoned, and you should remember that what happens within its walls remains confidential in nature.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was the lingering trace of a threat in her tone and Hermione\u2019s hackles rose; hopping down from the counter, she crossed her arms tersely in front of her. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that, Miss Sanders. You see, my job is to do nothing  but  research. Research I do believe my dear friend has already begun in the Auror department. I would surely hate to uncover anything unsavory but I\u2019m positive that is a non-issue altogether. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I should be getting back to bed.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a dismissive wave of her hand, the door swung open, shaking as it slammed against the wall. Growling unintelligibly under her breath, Cecily exited, shooting Draco a warning glare before the door promptly closed behind her.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the last we\u2019ll see of her,\u201d Draco mumbled, stowing his wand in his trousers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a long huff, she crossed the kitchen and wrapped her arms around his trim waist, smiling brightly back at him. \u201cUnfortunately, neither do I, but her massive ego can wait another day. There was something about breakfast and bed and what was the last part\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cRavishings.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA bright peal of laughter bubbled past her lips as his finger dug in her side and he nuzzled his stubble against her jaw. \u201cAh, yes. More of that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPulling back, he stared at her in that way that stole the breath from her lungs, his fingers finding a stray curl and tucking it safely behind her ear. \u201cMore of everything.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy bride and I wanted to say a quick moment of thanks to our friends and family who gathered here today.\u201d Draco beamed in the golden light of dusk, the sun just dipping below the rolling emerald hills of the Malfoy estate in southern France. Grinning down at his wife, he tugged her neatly into his side. She\u2019d worn her curls wild, the way he liked, and her dress was elegant yet simple, created just for her. On the third finger of her left hand sat a beautiful, clear diamond surrounded by a cluster of rubies, and next to that, a thin wedding band, brand new and never worn before an hour ago.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy  wife  and I have not had a love story that most people would call classically romantic. Things started a little\u2026  tumultuous.\u201d Around them, their few dozen guests snickered as Hermione jabbed her elbow in her new husband\u2019s ribs. \u201cBut, as much as I hate to give credit to anyone other than myself, I have to admit that a fair bit of fate was involved in this. I have always felt this draw to her, this inevitability that I couldn\u2019t fight even if I\u2019d wanted to. And trust me, I tried\u2014hence the bullying and subsequently broken nose.\u201d He paused, letting more laughter lilt through the air as he turned to stare at his new bride. \u201cI tend to avoid sappy public declarations of love, but for you I will endeavor to do so at every opportunity\u2014I love you, and I\u2019ll spend all the rest of my days proving it to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCatching her lips in a kiss, their guests erupted into riotous applause and he swiftly pulled into her an intimate dance as the music swelled around them. From the moment her eyes had opened that morning, it had been the most magical day of her life, far surpassing the day she got her Hogwarts letter or even her wand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomehow, through all the mess they\u2019d trudged through already and would undoubtedly still fight, they were here\u2014eyes filled with stars and love and promises for the future.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry to interrupt,\u201d Harry piped up, him and Theo saddling up next to them on the dance floor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you want to twirl my wife around the dance floor, Potter, but as much as I love you Theo, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to decline a turn with you. You\u2019re an awful dancer.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSwatting at her husband, she turned back to her friend with a curious brow. \u201cWhat is it, Harry?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA wedding present.\u201d He grinned, reaching into his robes and pulling out an envelope with an official Ministry seal on it. \u201cI would\u2019ve given it to you even sooner but it was just finalized yesterday when she was safely locked into Azkaban. It seems, for now, you\u2019re future is safe from the likes of former Unspeakable, Cecily Sanders.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith an eagerness that surprised her, she ripped the envelope open, gaze falling on the angry moving mugshot of Cecily Sanders. \u201cWh-what happened?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMalfoy\u2014er,  older  Malfoy\u2014was right. Cecily has been tampering with time for years. It took us a few months to complete our investigation and bring it before the Wizengamot, but it\u2019s done now. She\u2019s locked up for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTears welled in her eyes as she remembered the last six months and the paranoia that had accompanied them. She\u2019d been constantly on the lookout for a well-aimed curse at her back or a brilliant flash of green that would end it all before she knew what happened. Barreling into her friend, she whispered her thanks, again and again, breaking away only when he began wheezing for air.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDraco shook his hand and thanked him as well, before stealing his wife back into his arms. \u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe brightest grin she could ever remember wearing gleaned in the evening light and she laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s that! Now what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis lips brushed against her temple and he pulled her closer into his chest. \u201cWhatever we like, I suppose. We\u2019ve got time.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \u201cTime,\u201d she repeated. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nxXx\n\u00a0\n\nA/N: The biggest hugest loudest of thanks to you my lovely readers for following me on this time travel adventure. I had so much fun writing it and even more fun sharing it with you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be possible with my Alpha and Beta\u2019s MCal and DreamsofDramione and I\u2019ll cover them in kisses at first opportunity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWould love to know your thoughts and can\u2019t wait to see you for another story hopefully soon!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUntil next time,\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLK\n"
