    "text": "Bruce had always assumed that Superman\u2019s bit about rescuing cat from trees was just that\u2014a bit. A publicity stunt. He\u2019d seen the photos, of Superman carefully plucking a kitten from top branches and handing it to some girl with pigtails. It was all so cute and All-American that Bruce always wanted to vomit.\nIt was just like Superman himself, all flash, no substance.\nAnd Bruce believed that wholeheartedly. Right up until Superman floated up next to him, not a camera in sight.\n\u201cHey, puss.\u201d His voice is softer than Bruce hears on television, or on the few disastrous occasions that they\u2019ve spoken in person.\nIt was pure sadism that had led the magic user Bruce had been facing to leave him in a tree.\n\n \u201cThe path you\u2019re on will lead to tragedy,\u201d she said, and her eyes had been sad. \u201cNot only for you but for the entire world. We can\u2019t afford to lose Hope, not this early.\u201d Bruce had been trying to apprehend her without hurting her, because so far she hadn\u2019t hurt anyone too badly. \u201cThis is a gift, though I doubt you\u2019ll see it that way.\u201d \n\n\n And she had snapped her fingers. \n\nSuperman reaches out to Bruce, who instinctively hisses and swipes at him, claws extended.\nHe\u2019s expecting Superman to evade, but he doesn\u2019t anticipate the way Superman looks at him afterwards; amused, affectionate. \u201cCareful. That won\u2019t hurt me any, and you\u2019ll damage your claws.\u201d\nHe reaches out with both hands this time, scooping Bruce gently in his broad palms. \u201cHow did you get up here?\u201d\n\n Bruce had yowled, furious. When the fog had cleared from his vision after her snap, he\u2019d been horrified to find himself looking up at her. \n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s alright, kitty,\u201d she had said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you stay safe.\u201d And he\u2019d been in this fucking tree. As a cat. \n\nSuperman runs a gentle finger under his chin, around his neck, ignoring as Bruce tries to bite him. \u201cNo collar. Do you have anywhere to go?\u201d\nWhat a moron. Talking to a cat like it could understand him.\nUnless. Was animal speech some Kryptonian power? He had thought the idiot had revealed all his powers in that first interview with Lane, but he might have been smart enough to hold something back.\n\u2018I\u2019m under a spell,\u2019 he tries to say, and it comes out as a strangled meow.\nSuperman only smiles down at him. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anyone looking for you, but,\u201d he glances up, \u201cit does look like rain.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019M BATMAN,\u2019 Bruce tries to shout. Nothing. Fantastic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for the shelters too,\u201d Superman continues. \u201cBut I think I know somewhere I can take you.\u201d\nHe tucks Bruce close to his chest. \u201cPlease don\u2019t move too much. I won\u2019t drop you, but you might get hurt.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong. Even held as carefully as this, he can feel the strength in those arms, the power. He may as well throw himself at a brick wall, for all the good it would do him.\nHe pushes the thought away, focusing on the constant murmur of Superman\u2019s voice, letting the frustration build. Even Dick had stopped talking to animals when he was 10. God, he was stuck with the biggest idiot on the planet.\nAnd the idiot was taking him even further away. Further away from Gotham, from his home. Further away from the sorceress who had done this to him.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce hadn\u2019t been able to see much beyond the leaves of his tree when he was stuck, but when Superman floats easily into the air, it\u2019s not the Gotham skyline he sees. It\u2019s Metropolis. The witch had dropped him in Metropolis.\nSuperman is flying more slowly than is his usual wont, his arms bracketed around Bruce, preventing him from moving. Bruce will give him this much at least, he is in control of his own strength. Bruce has seen him bend steel like paper mache, has seen him pulverize brick walls with a single punch. But his grip on Bruce is just tight enough to keep him in place, without hurting him in anyway.\nTo his further surprise, Superman floats gently to a stop outside of an apartment window, not too far from where Bruce had been left. He taps the glass gently, adjusting his grip to keep Bruce secure.\nA woman answers his knock after just a minute. Despite the hour, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s only recently awake, with hair pulled back into a sloppy bun, eyes and nose red and raw looking. She\u2019s wearing a too-big sweatshirt over pair of Metropolis University sweatpants, and when she sees Superman in her window, she flinches back.\nBruce automatically bristles at the reaction, the instinctive fear. Most of Metropolis was ready to throw themselves down at his feet, and this was a place Superman knew on site. The theories building in his mind aren\u2019t pleasant; reinforcing the worst of fears.\nThen she opens the window, color building in her cheeks. \u201cOh my god, Kal. Tonight, of all nights?\u201d Her voice is hoarse and rough.\nSuperman\u2019s perfect face creases into a frown. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\nShe covers her face with both hands. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m just\u2014Superman is seeing me in my sick clothes. Please just kill me now.\u201d She follows this up with a wracking cough, and the look she sends Superman is mortified when it subsides.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed by,\u201d Superman says. \u201cI have seen sick humans before.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gooood,\u201d she moans. \u201cTell me what you need so I can lie down and hide forever, please?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to bother you, Alys, if I had known you were sick,\u201d he trails off.\n\u201cI\u2019m just surprised you couldn\u2019t hear me coughing from all the way across the city.\u201d\n\u201cI would never!\u201d His indignation sounds genuine, perfectly pitched to create the illusion that he respects privacy, respects boundaries. As if he isn\u2019t an Orwellian nightmare, Big Brother embodied in a single man. \u00a0\nAlys buys is, leaning against the window frame and smiling out at Superman. \u201cI\u2019m joking. What can I do you for?\u201d\nSuperman shifts, revealing Bruce in his arms. Alys\u2019 eyes light up.\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s so sweet!\u201d She reaches out to pet him, and Bruce hisses at her. He can\u2019t swipe at her, contained as he is, but he refuses to be called sweet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is, actually,\u201d Superman says sardonically. Alys laughs, but the sound quickly turns into a hacking cough.\n\u201cI\u2019d take him if I could, Kal, but,\u201d she gestures weakly. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve even been awake today.\u201d She gives him a concerned look. \u201cDo you have somewhere else to take him?\u201d\nI might,\u201d Superman says hesitantly.\n\u201cIt better not be your place again. I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t think arctic fortresses are built to hold earth animals.\u201d\nBruce has to close his eyes. He still can\u2019t believe how easily Superman had revealed the location of his home, and to hear civilians reference it so casually actually pains him. It\u2019s to Bruce\u2019s advantage, Superman\u2019s abilities and weaknesses and home base all laid at his feet, and yet\u2014\nSuperman chuckles. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. I have another idea.\u201d\nAlys gives him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take the next one, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cJust focus on feeling better.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if Superman says so, I gotta,\u201d Alys gives him a sarcastic salute. Superman rolls his eyes, a surprisingly casual move from a man who Bruce has always seen as dour and unapproachable.\n\u201cHave a good night, Alys,\u201d Superman says, and he drifts higher into the air as Alys returns to the sentiment.\nHigher up, out of Alys\u2019 ranger, Superman sighs. \u201cAlright, I guess we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\nHe sets off again, faster than last time, tucking Bruce in his cape to protect him from the windchill. Bruce hates it. When he feels them land and Superman drops his the fabric, Bruce has no idea where they are. They\u2019ve landed on a shadowed roof, dark enough that even Superman\u2019s bright colors are hidden. Superman still looks around suspiciously before he pushes open the roof door and slips inside.\nBruce feels baffled, confused. Is Superman breaking into someone\u2019s apartment?\nWhen they get to the door that must lead to the rest of the building, Superman\u2019s gaze sharpens before he pushes it open. Then he takes a deep breath and the world blurs around Bruce. The next thing he knows, he\u2019s in a small apartment, shabby but comfortable. It looks lived in, well-used. What the hell is Superman doing in a place like this?\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Superman says, setting Bruce gently down on the floor. \u201cI usually change first, but I didn\u2019t want to set you down outside.\u201d\nThe second Bruce\u2019s paws touch the grown, he runs. There is no visible exit, but he darts across the apartment and ducks under the couch. It\u2019s utterly hideous, but it suffices as a hiding place. Not that such a thing matters to a man with X-ray vision and super strength, but it makes Bruce feel just a bit more comfortable.\n\u201cAnd that would be why,\u201d Superman says, sounding amused.\nBruce moves enough that he can see out from under the couch, prepared to pull back if he needs to. But Superman isn\u2019t even looking at him, is already moving to the fridge. He pulls out a gallon of milk, drinks directly from the jug, like a savage, and puts it back.\nBruce only feels more confused. What the hell is Superman doing here. Then Superman looks down at himself and wrinkles his nose. \u201cTry not to destroy my apartment,\u201d he says over his shoulder, moving down the hall into another room that Bruce can\u2019t see.\nHis apartment?\nThen Superman comes out of the other room and Bruce\u2019s mind reels. Superman is almost unrecognizable. His hair is down from his Superman style, curls falling loose around his face. He\u2019s changed into a pair of sweats and a loose Met U shirt, a pair of glasses perched on his nose. He can\u2019t possibly need them. He looks normal. He looks  human .\nBruce can\u2019t stop staring at Superman\u2019s bare feet, deceptively vulnerable looking on the wood floors. He watches them cross the apartment, watches them stop in the kitchen.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I still have some cat food,\u201d Superman mutters to himself. It seem absurd to call this man, with his sweats and his bare feet, Superman. What had the woman called him? Kal? He remembers Superman saying that was in name in that absurd interview. Still, in this moment, it feels more natural than Superman.\nKal stretches up to the highest cabinet, and pulls out a half-full bag of cat food with a small noise of triumph. He pours it into a bowl and sets it down on the kitchen floor. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come out to get it,\u201d he says, filling another bowl with water. \u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve had to take a cat home. Alys usually helps out with that.\u201d\nHe ruffles his hair as he looks over at where Bruce is still crouched under the couch. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to a shelter tomorrow,\u201d he says. Bruce hisses at him.\nKal rolls his eyes, unimpressed. \u201cNow, human food,\u201d he mutters under his breath. He opens the fridge again, peering inside before he lets out a long breath. \u201cLooks like takeout again.\u201d\nBruce watches incredulously as Superman,  Superman , speed dials a Chinese restaurant and orders with comfortable familiarity. What is happening? Is Superman pretending to be a human? The idea is laughably absurd. A man who can destroy mountains, who can fly through the air, ordering Chinese food.\nOrder placed, Kal reaches for a laptop that\u2019s plugged in at the table and crosses to the couch.\nBruce darts away from him, moving across the room and ducking behind a bookshelf.\nKal doesn\u2019t even react, just sits down at the couch and opens his laptop. Then he just sits there, typing away. He only stops when the door rings. When the door opens, Bruce debates trying to get out. But Kal is blocking the door, and Bruce can hear another voice in the hall.\n\u201cClark, man, you have got to try something else. I am literally begging you.\u201d\n\u201cI like the Lo Mein,\u201d Kal, Clark?, says.\nThe other man, what must be the delivery, says \u201cI know you do, that has been made abundantly clear, but please. Get like, Sweet and Sour Chicken next time. Get fried rice. Try something new, I am begging you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Kal says as he pays.\nThe other man groans. \u201cYou liar. You are the most boring man on the planet!\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, Kevin.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Kevin mutters, and Kal closes the door behind him.\nBruce\u2019s mind is whirring. So Superman pretends to be human. Is this something new? According to his interview with Lane, he had only arrived on Earth a few years ago, had he set up this identity in that time? Had it been set up by the government? What purpose does it serve? Is it just to gain information on humanity, to better impersonate them? What is his game?\nKal\u2014Bruce refuses to call him by his fake name that the delivery man had used\u2014takes his food to the couch and snaps open the chopsticks. He eats like that, cross-legged on the couch with his laptop open in front of him. There is something surreal about watching him eat, dangling noodles into his mouth. He eats like a teenager, like Dick does on the rare occasion that they order in.\nJust as Bruce is starting to wonder if his mind had somehow played a trick on him, that Superman had left the apartment and this other man had just come out of the bedroom at the same time, Kal\u2019s head jerks up. He still has noodles in his mouth, he looks ridiculous.\nThen he blurs, and in just a moment, Superman is standing in the living room. He tosses the glasses down onto the couch, opens the window and is gone.\nBruce concentrates, but he can\u2019t hear anything. Slowly, carefully, he pads out from behind the bookshelf. Upon closer inspection, the apartment is just as ratty as he had thought. The apartment has two other rooms, a small bedroom that barely fits the full-sized bed and dresser, and a bathroom. The bed is rumpled but the room itself is fairly clean.\nThere is a mirrored sliding closet door, and Bruce gets his first good look at his new form. He looks like any other black cat on the street, a bit bigger than an average stray but nothing unusual. He\u2019ll need to figure out how to contact the Manor. He\u2019s never not come home from patrol, Dick and Alfred will both be worrying.\nUsing both his front paws, he is able to get the sliding door to the closet open. He\u2019s surprised by what he sees. Inside the closest is a long row of terrible suits. And Bruce doesn\u2019t mean that in the way he refers to all off-the rack suits. These are genuinely awful. Some of them are just the wrong shade of gray. Some of them have elbow patches. Some of them just have absurd cuts, with too-wide lapels or an extra few inches at the bottom. They are all, to Bruce\u2019s experienced eye, too large even for a man of Kal\u2019s girth.\nIs it that an alien can\u2019t judge human apparel? Has Kal studied humans, using exclusively films from the 80s?\nHe slides the closet door closed again and begins to prowl through the apartment. His initial investigation is done, now he needs to find a phone. He can\u2019t talk, but he can still use morse code. Alfred and Dick both know it, will be able to at least know that he\u2019s okay, even if he can\u2019t explain the full situation.\nBut if Kal has a landline, he can\u2019t find it. There is a cell phone still on the counter from when he had ordered food, but it\u2019s locked and Bruce can\u2019t get it open as he is now.\nBruce crosses then to the laptop. It has gone to sleep, but he taps at the trackpad with his paw and it wakes up. This, too, is locked. The login screen just says Clark. It makes sense, he supposes: alias or not, Superman wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to have his login as Superman.\nHe hears a rustle from the bedroom, the sound of a window closing. From the couch, he can see the hall as Kal crosses from the bedroom, in the process of stripping off the Superman costume. He has soot on his face and hands. Then he disappears into the bathroom and Bruce hears the shower start up.\nWhen Kal emerges, he\u2019s back in his sweatpants and he looks tired. He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Superman got tired.\nKal drops down onto the couch, but doesn\u2019t reach for his laptop this time. He just lies there, one arm draped over his eyes, breathing quietly for a few minutes.\nThen he drops his arm, letting it fall down, until his fingers hang just above the floor, at eye level. Bruce contemplates biting him, but it would undoubtedly hurt Bruce more than Kal.\nHe hisses again, and Kal seems to remember that he is even there for the first time. He leans over to peer, upside down, under the couch. \u201cHey, puss,\u201d he says, soft. He stretches out his hand, more deliberately. Bruce ignores him. After a moment, Kal pulls back. \u00a0\nThen he sighs, and pulls his laptop to him again. This time, he seems less focused. Under the couch as he is, Bruce can\u2019t see him, but the typing is less determined, less continuous. He keeps stopping and starting.\nAfter what feels like an hour of this\u2014and Bruce\u2019s inner clock is well-honed\u2014Kal sighs again, and his arm crosses into Bruce\u2019s field of vision as he sets his laptop down, closed this time, on the coffee table. Then he stands and stretches, and heads into the bathroom. Bruce can hear him brush his teeth, going through a standard pre-bed routine. But surely he doesn\u2019t intend to\u2014 \u00a0\nAnd then he crosses into the bedroom, the light goes out, and Bruce hears the distinctive sound of someone dropping onto a mattress. Does he even need to sleep? If he doesn\u2019t why go through the charade? He must require sleep then, and that alone is enough to make this entire miserable experience worth it.\nIf he requires sleep, he can get tired. If he can get tired, he can be outlasted, defeated.\nAfter another hour, curiosity gets the better of him, and Bruce pads into the bedroom. Kal is very clearly asleep, stretched out on the bed like a starfish, in just his boxers and the t-shirt he had been wearing earlier. He doesn\u2019t look anything other than human.\nBruce lays down in the hallway, not wanting to take his eyes off of him.\nIn the soft noises of the city outside, in the moments between Kal\u2019s deep breaths, he falls asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce wakes up as he always does; all at once. It takes him less than a moment to remember the previous day, to place the unfamiliar location. There is an alarm going off somewhere else in the apartment, that had been what woke him up.\nSuperman, Kal, is sitting up in bed, knuckling sleep out of his eyes. Bruce is a genius, arguably one of the smartest men on the planet, and he can hardly conceive that this is the man who had caught a plane in his arms, who could shoot lasers from his eyes. Who could kill people in the millions in less than a minute, if he was ever inclined to do so.\nThen Kal sighs and pushes himself upright. This time, Bruce doesn\u2019t run, doesn\u2019t move out of the way. Regardless of his suspicions\u2014his fears\u2014he doesn\u2019t truly think that Kal is the kind of being who would kill an animal just for the sake of it. He doubts he is in any danger as he is now. Were he to be discovered, however, is another matter.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that even being here means leaving Gotham unguarded, with just Alfred and a fifteen year old boy to keep an eye on things, Bruce would view this as invaluable reconnaissance. Which means he may as well learn anything he can.\nKal passes him in the hall, bending to give him a quick scratch that Bruce dodges. He does take a swipe at Kal\u2019s hand though, but Kal avoids him just as easily.\nHe watches as Kal goes through the all motions of humanity, brushing his teeth, combing his hair. He uses gel and slicks his hair close to his head, which looks ridiculous. However, if his goal is to look less like Superman, Bruce has to admit that it works. The crowning piece of the performance is watching Kal put on one of the the over-sized suits, which make him look smaller in comparison. As soon as the suit jacket slides over those broad shoulder, he hunches in. The glasses hide his face, his striking cheekbones, his blue eyes.\nThe overall effect is impressive. If Bruce didn\u2019t know that this was Superman, hadn\u2019t seen the change with his own eye, he would have a hard time picking this man out of a crowd.\nHe isn\u2019t sure who could have set this up for Kal, whether it was the government, or Lois Lane, or simply through his own ingenuity, but Bruce has to admit that Superman is smarter than Bruce had given him credit for.\nWhat the disguise does not do, Occam's razor does the rest. Who would ever believe that this is Superman, walking about with a bad haircut and an ill-fitting suit.\n\u201cOff to work,\u201d Kal says, presumably to Bruce. \u201cI\u2019ll find a home for you soon, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t plan to be here when he gets back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter Kal leaves, taking his laptop with him, Bruce decides to do more research into the apartment before he breaks out. At the very least, he wants to figure out who is footing the bill. If someone has Superman in their pocket, Bruce needs to know about it. If Superman has someone in his pocket, Bruce needs to know that even more.\nIt\u2019s possible that this Clark persona functions for Superman as Matches Malone functions for Bruce. Or perhaps one of his less criminal names. Bruce has more than his share of safe houses under fake names, aliases he slips in and out of to get different pieces of information. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t thought that was Superman\u2019s style, but he won\u2019t rule it out.\nIn this body, he finds he can jump higher than he would have thought, proportional to his adjusted height. Getting onto the counter isn\u2019t even difficult, and he is able to find a pile of bills and other mail. The first one is addressed simply to \u2018Current Resident\u2019, but he nudges the stack until a name becomes clear.\nClark Kent.\nThe name rings a bell, which is surprising in and of itself. Bruce prides himself on being well informed, but he doesn\u2019t know the name of every man and woman on the streets, especially outside of Gotham. If he\u2019s heard the name before, that means Clark Kent is someone. A criminal, or someone in the public eye, neither of which fit with this fake persona Superman has set up.\nHe also can\u2019t remember where he\u2019s heard the name before, which is infuriating.\nAll he can do is investigate further, then work on his plan to escape.\nAs a whole, the apartment is jarrringly human. It\u2019s small, and homey, and there isn\u2019t quite enough space, none of which fits into the image he has of Superman. The couch is too small for a grown man to stretch out on, hardly more than a loveseat, and the bookshelves are packed with books and tchotchkes. \u00a0\nBruce has to climb onto the shelves to get a closer look, an undignified maneuver that bears little resemblance to his experiences in climbing buildings and scaling mountains.\nThere are souvenirs from all over the country\u2014all over the world. But then, it would be easy for Superman to travel. A ten minute trip to Japan, to Australia. It shouldn\u2019t surprise him.\nBriefly, the absurd image of Superman flying across the Atlantic with a snow globe held carefully in both hands crosses his mind. Ridiculous.\nEven stranger, the souvenirs are all cheap tourist nonsense. Snow globes or postcards or silver spoons. The kind found in a hotel gift store or even a convenience store. Why pick them up? Why keep them?\nThe climb higher feels precarious, not enough room on the packed shelves for his feline form. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s the goddamn Batman. He can manage a set of cheap shelves in a Metropolis apartment. At the higher shelves, his determination pays off.\nThere, at a man\u2019s eye level, a few carefully framed photos.\nAn elderly couple, arms around each other, smiling in front of a picturesque farmhouse. A modern American Gothic. If this is part of a pretense, an all-American alias, Superman couldn\u2019t have done better. A stock photo, perhaps?\nAnother photo of the same couple, standing with what appears to be a recent graduate\u2014high school or college isn\u2019t clear. The graduate is laughing, waving away the camera. Their face is turned away, making the angle of the cap obscure the face, but Bruce can see dark curls, a strong jawline, a pair of heavy frames.\nIt could easily pass for a young Superman\u2014a young Clark Kent. Perhaps not a stock photo\u2014a staged photo then? The kid is clearly younger than Superman, but with all the world to choose from, it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find a look-alike. There are at least three Bruce Wayne look-alikes, one of whom makes regular appearances on SNL.\nThe jump back to the floor is easier.\nThere is nothing meaningful in the rest of the apartment, nothing he hasn\u2019t already seen. A small TV sits facing the couch, a stack of books piled high in front of it. The coffee table is just barely kept organized, a small pile of National Geographic taking up a corner, a stack of Daily Planet copies in the other. Bruce glances at the top one, a Lois Lane byline covering a recent fire in an apartment complex and Superman\u2019s efforts in putting it out. Bruce wants to scoff at the aggrandizing nature of keeping articles like this in the apartment.\nBut what Bruce can\u2019t get past is the why. Why this pretense? Surely if Superman was going to play at human, he could live in more luxury than this? Even without tipping a hand to his identity, a man with his abilities could do anything, surely? Could crush coal into diamonds, could slip into any bank in the country, could pull lost riches from the ocean floor.\nOne thing is made clear. Superman is smarter, sneakier than Bruce had given him credit for. This apartment holds up to scrutiny, even with the knowledge Bruce has. It\u2019s as well put together, as well forged as any of Bruce\u2019s safehouses.\nIt\u2019s dangerous.\nHe curls up on the couch, tucking his paws\u2014how utterly absurd\u2014under him as he thinks. He needs to get back to Gotham, to his home and his patrols and his ward. But this is an unparalleled opportunity to observe Superman, to see who he is when he thinks no one is looking.\nHe confronted the sorceress on a Thursday. Today is Friday. Kal has left wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase. Assuming that he is feigning at a job, he will likely spend his evening or weekend hours here, in between heroics\nBruce can trust Alfred and Dick with Gotham for another night. He has to. The risk that Superman poses is greater than anything he has ever faced in Gotham. He can\u2019t waste this opportunity.\nOne thing that Bruce had failed to consider is the functional limits of this body. Cats sleep a lot. A lot. He finds himself drifting off if he stays still for too long, the only cure being more movement. He takes pleasure in racing around the apartment, knocking things over.\nWhen Superman does get home, he enters through the front door, still in his ill-fitting suit. Bruce understands aliases and disguises, but he doesn\u2019t understand this one. Why would a god walk among men, play at being one of them.\nZeus had walked among mortals, and had used the opportunity to mete out judgment, to take women and punish men. He had not used it to order Chinese food and wear bad suits.\nThis time, Superman, Kal, has brought food with him. Not Chinese food, but clearly more takeout. He eats like a child, like a teenager left off the leash for a weekend.\nHis eyes light immediately on Bruce, who had curled up on the couch after a nap had caught him by surprise.\n\u201cHey there,\u201d he says, and even knowing it\u2019s Bruce\u2019s transformation, it\u2019s a bit disconcerting. No one has ever been so pleased to see him. Then his eyes travel over the rest of the apartment, and Bruce feels himself tense. There is a certain mindlessness to being a cat. A certain number of behavioral impulses that even Bruce feels hard-pressed to suppress. It had made sense, at the time, to run about the apartment knocking things over, a certain satisfaction in it.\nBut now, under Kal\u2019s cool gaze, he thinks about the consequences. He does not truly think that Kal is the kind of person to hurt an animal, but there are things anyone might do in anger. At the very least, he could be thrown from the apartment, could lose the advantage of this position.\nThen Kal huffs out a breath, and his mouth twitches into a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected.\u201d\nHe sets down the food and moves through the apartment, righting the lamp that had fallen, putting things back on shelves. Bruce hadn\u2019t even noticed that he\u2019d knocked off one of the photos\u2014this form is dangerous, more than he\u2019d realized\u2014until he sees Kal linger over it.\nLooking at the position of the other photos on the shelf, the blank space this one left, Bruce can tell it\u2019s the one of the elderly couple, the picture-perfect American couple. The way that Kal\u2019s fingers linger on the pane, the careful way he sets it down, it\u2019s not the way one would treat a stock photo.\nThis family, that couple, they mean something to him. Bruce resolves to learn who they are. Another reason not to leave.\n\u201cNo harm done,\u201d Kal says, and Bruce thinks he picks up just the hint of an accent\u2014something midwestern and slow. Then Kal turns back to him, and his face is open, amused. \u201cI knew you were a troublemaker.\u201d\nThat is the least of what Bruce has been called. He stretches. Kal huffs a laugh as he crosses back to the counter, pulling out the food he\u2019d brought.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat anything,\u201d he says reprovingly. Bruce sniffs. He\u2019s not planning to eat cat food anytime soon.\nKal rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright then.\u201d\nThis time, he eats his meal standing at the counter, apparently unmoved by Bruce\u2019s unwavering, unblinking stare. \u201cYou\u2019re an odd cat,\u201d Kal says when he\u2019s done. He crosses over to Bruce and makes a move like he might pet him. Bruce hisses, recoiling on the couch.\nKal stills his hand, and rocks back on his heels. \u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m a bit odd myself.\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t try to hide his snort of derision. \u2018Odd\u2019 is putting it mildly.\nHe watches as Kal crosses back across the apartment, moving into the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m heading out!\u201d Kal calls, and Bruce can only assume it\u2019s directed at him. He\u2019s not sure how he feels about it. Talking to animals is absurd, foolish, but it\u2019s a very human kind of absurd and foolish. Not anything he would have expected from Superman.\nHe jumps off the couch, getting a view of the bedroom just in time to see the familiar red boots disappear through the window. It seems like a sloppy mistake to make, to so often leave from this apartment.\nBruce crosses to window and realizes that he has underestimated Superman again. This apartment is nestled in a dark corner, almost an alcove. There are no windows that look into this room, and in the evening gloom, the shadows more than obscure it from the street.\nHe has already seen Kal use the roof as well, which must be his exit and entrance when the light is not so forgiving. Unlike Batman, Superman is not only a creature of the night, he combats threats during all hours.\nWhat kind of job must this alias of his hold, if indeed it is a job, that allows him the time to be Superman?\nAnother prowl of the apartment yields no new clues. This time Bruce is careful not to knock anything over, not to disturb the apartment. Bruce himself comes back from patrol high with adrenaline, the thrum of violence echoing through his veins. He doesn\u2019t want to discover that the same is true of Superman.\nThis time, hours and hours pass before Kal returns, long enough that Bruce drifts off to sleep again. When Kal sees Bruce, lying on the bed this time\u2014the best vantage point of the window\u2014he just goes \u201cHuh,\u201d and draws the curtain closed.\nHe strips off the Superman costume with the unselfconscious air of someone alone in his own apartment, no reason to think that he should be embarrassed. It feels like an intrusion.\nKal is wearing plaid boxers under the Superman suit, so incongruous that Bruce doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s staring. A god, a perfect specimen standing in front of him, the image of physical perfection, undercut by plaid boxers.\nThe way that Kal then pulls on a worn-soft sweatshirt and loose pajama pants is not the way a man might pull on a disguise, but the tired actions of any man getting ready for an evening in.\nBruce follows as Kal pads, barefoot again, into the living room, watching as he spends another two hours typing away on his laptop. Bruce tries to angle himself to see what he is writing, but a proper view would require him to get close, closer than he is willing to get. All he can see is that it\u2019s clearly text document, all the typing towards one thing. A manifesto?\nHacking is nearly impossible with paws, but if he stays here long enough, he is sure that he will have the opportunity to read it. Something written like this\u2014the furrow in that strong brow, the way he stops and sighs, the way he deletes sentences and rewrites them\u2014something written with this level of passion would be an invaluable insight.\nIt\u2019s past three am when Kal folds up the computer and heads to bed. Bruce stays in the living room, listening to the sounds of someone getting ready for sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce, and he suspects Kal, is woken up by an insistent banging on the door.\n\u201cRise and shine, Kent!\u201d someone, a woman, calls. Even from his spot on the couch, Bruce can hear he groan that Kal lets out in response.\nThe woman bangs on the door again. The clock on the microwave gives the time as 7:30.\nKal all but stumbles to the door, his hair a mess of bedhead. He\u2019s down to his flannel pajama pants and no shirt. It\u2019s a good look on him. He yanks open the door, and Bruce is surprised to note that, despite the frustration in the movement, it still only opens the door. A move like that from Superman could take the door off its hinges, could crumple the handle, could pull the very wall down. Half-asleep as he clearly is, surely it would be harder not to ruin the door.\nWhat does that say about his control?\nKal barely has the door open before the woman is shouldering past him, and Superman turns into it to accommodate her, when she could so easily bounce off his broad chest.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you can distract me with your shirtlessness,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have places to be, names to take.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the expression, Lo,\u201d Kal says, looking tired and amused as he closes the door and leans against it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve expressed your objection to kicking ass, so I\u2019m yielding to your delicate sensibilities.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go get dressed,\u201d Kal says, not rising to her baiting.\n\u201cIf you have to,\u201d she says with a pointed once-over of his bare chest. The view of Superman spluttering, going red under her gaze is a fascinating one. A charming one.\n\u201cLois, c\u2019mon,\u201d Kal says.\nLois waves him off. \u201cYeah, yeah, do your thing. I\u2019m making coffee.\u201d\nShe is clearly familiar with the apartment, with Kal. She rustles casually through his cabinets and sets a pot of coffee on with easy familiarity.\nWhen she turns to the couch, Bruce gets his first real look at her. This face he knows. Lois Lane, Daily Planet\u2019s star reporter. Breaker of the Superman story. Infamously the only woman on the planet with a direct line to the Man of Steel. More direct than anyone had realized.\nAnd with that realization comes another, as Bruce finally places the name Clark Kent. He\u2019s read the name before, a byline in the Daily Planet, sometimes shared with Lane but increasingly getting more and more meaningful stories of his own.\nBruce had read a story of his about corruption in the mayor\u2019s office that had taken the front page, pushing even Lane\u2019s byline below the fold. Bruce can remember being impressed at the level of research, the attention to detail. He remembers that Kent had a tendency towards idealism in his articles.\nSuperman moonlights as a Daily Planet reporter. One who waxes poetic about justice and truth in his articles. One who genuinely writes well and writes often, who must take the job seriously to land front page by-lines and be so often partnered with Lois Lane.\nBut why? Why bother? As far as jobs go, a reporter is a good one to keep informed, to be able to run off as needed, but it\u2019s also a risky one. He has surrounded himself with people who do research into Superman on a daily basis, who are known for their investigative abilities. The only worse job he could take would be a police officer.\nWhich raises the question, does Lane know that her coworker is Superman?\n\u201cDid you get a cat?\u201d Lane calls to Kal, still in the bedroom.\n\u201cSort of. Don\u2019t pet him, he\u2019s trouble.\u201d\nLane, who had been moving towards him, rocks back. \u201cSo, not your usual style.\u201d\nKal emerges from the bedroom, slicking his hair back. \u201cHaha.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d Lane mimes pushing a pair of glasses up her nose. Well then.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d Kal says mildly, ducking into the bathroom. \u201cCoffee\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cYour hearing will never fail to impress and alarm me,\u201d Lois says, moving to the kitchen and pouring two cups. Bruce a surge of\u2014irritation? Amusement?\u2014when he sees that one of the mugs has a Superman logo on it.\n\u201cThat one was my nose, actually,\u201d Kal calls back. When he comes back he is fully Clark Kent, shoulders hunched in his suit, bright eyes obscured by glasses, dark curls tamed close to his head.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to chase a few leads, you can loosen up a bit, Smallville.\u201d She moves like she wants to tousle his hair loose, and he ducks under her hands. Bruce can feel his ears prick at the clue, dropped so casually. Is Smallville part of the cover?\nKal makes a clear face at the Superman mug, and very pointedly takes the other.\n\u201cOne of us has to look like a professional,\u201d Kal says.\nLane is wearing a loose blouse tucked into a pair of jeans. \u201cScrew you,\u201d she says amicably. \u201cYou look like a door to door salesman.\u201d\nKal pushes his glasses up his nose, and the move is so pointed that Lane snorts.\nLane turns her attention back to Bruce as Kal proceeds to doctor the coffee past the point of recognizability. \u201cWhere did you get this one?\u201d\n\u201cUp a tree.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a goddamn bleeding heart, Kent.\u201d She rounds on Bruce, \u201cAnd you are a cliche. Have some dignity.\u201d\nBruce hisses at her.\n\u201cLike I said, trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not the shelter? Or your friend?\u201d\n\u201cAlys has the flu, and all the shelters are full, I checked last night. I didn\u2019t want to risk just dropping him off.\u201d\nLane shakes her head, \u201cJesus. You\u2019re giving me cavities.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you had a new lead?\u201d\nLane leans back on the counter, watching as Kal tips another spoonful of sugar into his cup. \u201cI think it\u2019s dead, Smallville. You\u2019ve killed it.\u201d\nKal takes a pointed sip of his coffee and lets out an even more pointed sigh of pleasure. Lane rolls her eyes. Something about this, this casual playfulness, this strikes at Bruce more than the apartment itself, more than the ill-fitting suits and the heavy glasses. He doesn\u2019t know what to make of it, what to do with it.\nThey lean against the counter together, finishing their coffee as Lane explains a tip that she\u2019d gotten from a source, something that could give more info on a story that the two of them are apparently working together.\n\u201cHow\u2019s your O\u2019Hara story going?\u201d Lois asks as they\u2019re wrapping up.\nKal gives her a look over his mug, amused, skeptical. \u201cI\u2019m not falling for that.\u201d\nLane holds up one hand, an unarmed gesture. \u201cJust a question!\u201d\n\u201cHow is your story on the docks going?\u201d Kal asks.\nLane huffs into her coffee. \u201cYeah, yeah. Point taken.\u201d She set her mug down. \u201cAnd how is the,\u201d she makes a gesture over her head, like bunny ears, \u201cgoing.\u201d\nKal grimaces. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\nShe taps a fist on his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d\nKal makes a doubtful noise in his throat as he takes her cup, and his own, and puts them both in the sink. \u201cI\u2019m going to break that mug one day.\u201d\n\u201cYou do, and I\u2019ll buy you three more. A veritable hydra of Superman merch.\u201d\nKal laughs, and Bruce is struck again by how normal the sound is, how human.\nHe watches as Kal ushers Lane out of the apartment, two coworkers, two friends, off to work at their job. Nothing supernatural, nothing menacing about it. If it\u2019s all a performance for Lane\u2019s benefit, it\u2019s a good one. But why bother? If Lane knows that he is Superman, as she clearly does, why play at being human for her?\nHe curls up on the couch and thinks, and thinks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s asleep on the couch when Superman pushes open the door to the apartment.\n\u201c\u2014have to get a few more sources. I\u2019ll probably do that this week.\u201d Kal has his phone between his shoulder and his ear as he closes the door and sets his briefcase down. His suit is even more rumpled than it was when he left in the morning. A side-effect of changing into Superman during the day?\nBruce wonders who he\u2019s talking to. Is he speaking as Superman or the alias? He suspects the latter. His voice is lighter, less confident than the sure tone he adopts when in costume.\n\u201cI have a few leads, but nothing concrete yet. Do you need me to come by?\u201d He listens to the response from the other end of the line.\nBruce watches, refusing to move from the spot he\u2019s claimed, as Kal goes moves around the kitchen, setting up a pot of water on the stove, leaning back against the fridge as he talks. Something the other person says makes him laugh.\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say no,\u201d he says. Bruce finds his eyes drawn to the line of his throat, the gleam of his teeth. \u201cI always miss your cooking.\u201d Another pause. \u201cMe? Uhhhh. I\u2019m having a salad for dinner.\u201d This is a lie. Bruce can clearly see him mixing up a fluorescent orange bowl of mac and cheese.\n\u201cNo, Ma!\u201d Kal protests, laughing again. The word rocks through Bruce. Ma. He doesn\u2019t know what it means, can\u2019t understand it. Superman had said in an interview that he was the only one of his people here. Was it a lie? Is there a whole race of super-powered beings throughout the world? A sleeper-cell, ready to take Earth by storm?\nKal is still talking, his phone back between his shoulder and ear as he carries the bowl to the couch. Bruce is too startled to move off the couch. He does, however, make a reflexive swipe at Kal\u2019s hand when he reaches out to scratch Bruce\u2019s ears.\nKal makes a face at him. Then, to the phone, \u201cNo, Ma, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not like I need to\u2014\u201d the person\u2014his mother?\u2014on the other end must cut him off. Whatever she\u2019s saying has the overtones of a lecture, from the cadence that Bruce can now catch, and the long-suffering look on Kal\u2019s face.\n\u201cMaybe nothing can live up to your cooking,\u201d Kal suggests, with the same tone that Dick uses when trying to wheedle something out of Alfred. The look on his face says that is lands just as well. \u201cWould you believe pasta-salad?\u201d A beat. \u201cYes.\u201d Another pause. \u201cYes, Ma.\u201d\nThen his face sobers. Bruce tries to move closer as subtly as possible, hoping to get a better ear on the conversation.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been\u2014it\u2019s been fine. No, Ma. No, things are,\u201d he swallows, throat tightening, \u201cthey\u2019re fine.\u201d For the first time, Bruce feels as though he is intruding on something private, intimate. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nKal tips his head back against the back of the couch. He looks, for a moment, so tired. So human.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been\u2026 better. I think people are really starting to trust me. That\u2014they think I can help.\u201d Bruce can practically feel his fur go on end. Superman is all but admitting that he wants their trust\u2014that he needs it for some purpose.\nKal closes his eyes. Whatever the speaker is saying seems to smooth him, lines of tension relaxing around his mouth, his eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d Beat. \u201cI know. I\u2019m,\u201d another swallow. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d\nBruce has moved close enough that he can hear the words now, hear a woman\u2019s voice say \u201cThat\u2019s all they can ask of you,\u201d\nSuperman\u2019s laugh, when it comes out, is a tired as his expression. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d There is a moment of silence, echoing on both ends of the line. Then, like a confession. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just try, Ma. I want to do it right. I want to be perfect.\u201d\nThere is another long pause. Then the woman says, \u201cYou\u2019re not a god, Clark.\u201d\nIt means something, that she calls him Clark. Bruce doesn\u2019t know what. He doesn\u2019t have enough information, and it is infuriating. He has all the puzzle pieces in front of him, and he can\u2019t manage to sort them into a comprehensive picture.\n\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want\u2014I don\u2019t want anyone to think I am. I just want to help.\u201d\n\u201cThen help.\u201d\nKal takes a deep breath, then another. \u201cYeah. Yeah. Thanks Ma.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime, baby.\u201d\nKal\u2019s eyes catch on Bruce when he sits up. \u201cDo you need another mouser, by chance?\u201d\nIt breaks whatever mood had settled over the phone line. \u201cNo. And I swear, if you bring me another cat, you will regret it. These city cats you bring me, they can\u2019t catch a mouse to save a life. They sit outside by the door all day, crying until I bring the food to them.\u201d\nKal laughs, and it\u2019s lighter again, not heavy with something Bruce knows all too well.\n\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll find a home for him.\u201d\n\u201cCome by next weekend, once your article is done.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Ma.\u201d\nThere is one last, final pause. Then \u201cI love you, baby.\u201d\nKal ducks his head. \u201cLove you too, Ma.\u201d\nThe woman on the other end of the phone, who talks like a mother and sounds so very human, hangs up.\nKal settles back into the couch, and takes a bite of his congealed mac and cheese. It\u2019s gone cold. Bruce wants to laugh at the face he makes, disgusted and juvenile. He doesn\u2019t know how to feel about that.\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to feel about any of this.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce Kal is done with his abominable dinner, he picks up his laptop again. His work, whatever he is writing, is steady this time.\n\u201cWhat sounds better, do you think?\u201d he asks about a half an hour in. Bruce, lying under the coffee table, just looks at him. \u201c\u2019The lack of proper building materials in the Riverside housing complex contributed to the building collapse, an act of criminal neglect on the part of Bron Management\u2019, or \u2018In an act of criminal negligence, Bron Management used subpar building material in the Riverside housing complex, which ultimately led to the building\u2019s collapse.\u2019\u201d\nHe\u2019s working on an article, Bruce realizes. He has been all week. Not a manifesto or a call to arms. He remembers hearing about the Riverside housing complex, which had collapsed just a few days before Bruce had confronted the sorceress. It was only thanks to Superman that no one had died. Is this just his way to praise Superman, a self-aggrandising effort to make himself look good, call attention to Superman\u2019s good deeds?\n\u201cLois called dibs on the Superman saves people angle,\u201d Kal says, and there is something sardonic in the angle of his mouth, \u201cbut Bron Management needs to be held accountable. I could see\u2014\u201d he lets out a sigh, pushing his hair back. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to know things,\u201d he says, only partly to Bruce. \u201cIt\u2019s proving them that\u2019s hard.\u201d\nBruce wonders what it was he did see. While he was pulling families, children, out of a crumbling building. Was it faults in the wood, was it something in the makeup of the steel? Something that caught his attention even as he saved lives. Something that Superman could do nothing about. Something that Clark Kent might be able to fix.\nMaybe that\u2019s the point of all of this. Not a spy, not infiltration. Just a different way to accomplish his goals.\nBut what those goals were, Bruce still couldn\u2019t be sure. The idea that he really did just wanted to help, as he\u2019d said on the phone, was absurd. He could shatter mountains, could pull the earth out of orbit. Why would someone with that kind of power worry about the concerns of ants.\nKal works on his article for another twenty minutes before something catches his attention, something beyond human hearing and concern. Whatever he hears, it\u2019s urgent, no sardonic \u2018got to go,\u2019 like he\u2019s said before. There is hardly a pause between him hearing whatever it was, and his leaving the apartment, the window closing behind him.\nAnd the laptop, still open on the coffee table.\nIt\u2019s hard to navigate the keys with his paws, but it\u2019s not impossible. Bruce has managed keyboards and trackpads with most of his fingers broken before, this is nothing.\nHe reads over the document that Kal was working on, and it\u2019s exactly as it appears. Once again, Bruce is struck by the idealism, the call for justice. It rings through the entire article. Is it possible that Superman is just like this?\nNext, Bruce opens up an incognito window and looks up the news in Gotham. Nothing serious has happened, and Bruce breathes a sigh of relief. He trusts Alfred, trusts Dick, but neither of them are Batman.\nFrom there, Bruce snoops. There is a folder of Planet articles that he skims, each one as well written, well researched and idealistic as the last. If Bruce had ever met Clark as a reporter, without the knowledge of who he was, Bruce would have found him insufferable.\n\u2018Or irresistible,\u2019 a voice inside him says, reminding him of his past experiences with intelligent idealists. The voice sounds infuriatingly like Alfred.\nThere is something that strikes him, as he reads these articles. When looked at together, when one looks under the sheer optimism in them, there is a sardonic note to them, a thread of wit and humor that Bruce is coming to associate with a particular quirk to Kal\u2019s lips.\nHe closes out of that folder, opens up the pictures.\nUnlike the photos in the apartment, there is no reason to stage these, no reason to curate them for an audience. The elderly couple features prominently, moving around what is clearly a farm. Kal appears as well, most often alongside them, but occasionally by himself. And it is clearly Kal, no look-alike.\nHe\u2019s careful, there is no sign of his powers, but there is something about him, in the way that he carries himself, that is impossible to mistake.\nAnd he is also, unmistakably, younger in the photos. As he gets older, the man from the photos disappears, leaving just Kal and the woman. Is this the woman from the phone, whom Kal had called Ma with no pause or hesitation?\nBruce had taken it at face value, when the Lane article said he came here as an adult, escaping the wreckage of a dying world. But who knew what his culture considered an adult? And who knew how much of that had been real. These pictures, they tell the story of someone who has lived on earth for at least ten years. Has lived with a family.\nBruce closes out of everything he opened and leaves the computer where it is, settling back onto the couch. For every question he gets an answer for, the more questions he has.\nHe can feel Gotham calling, feels the need for it in his bones. But there is too much at stake here, too much still unanswered. He can\u2019t leave yet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce doesn\u2019t know what time Kal gets home, but Kal is there when Bruce wakes up the next morning. This time, there is no reporter to wake Kal up, but he is still up early. Up with the sun, one might say. He staggers around, half-awake for a few minutes before he shakes it off. Bruce is getting the horrifying impression that Superman is a morning person.\nThis time, when he gets dressed, he doesn\u2019t go full Clark Kent. Instead, he just pulls on a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt, frames pushed up his nose but hair loose around his face as he heads out. Bruce has resigned himself to another day of an empty apartment when Kal returns, a bag held in one hand.\n\u201cI got bagels for myself,\u201d Kal says, presumably to Bruce, \u201cand for you, lox!\u201d He pulls out a small box of smoked salmon with an air of triumph, and Bruce\u2019s stomach rumbles despite itself. He knows that Kal hears it, too.\nKal sets the lox on the floor for Bruce, and watched expectantly. Bruce looks back, tail twitching. Kal rolls his eyes extravagantly, and looks away. \u201cJesus, you\u2019re a drama queen aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nBruce wishes, dearly wishes, that he had hands, just to flip him off. He settles on ignoring him, digging into the salmon. It\u2019s good; rich and flavorful. And, best of all, not cat food.\nKal eats his own bagel, liberally coated in cream cheese, at the counter beside him, carefully not looking at Bruce.\nWhen he\u2019s done, Bruce watches as he paces around the apartment, muttering to himself. Bruce has seen him do this, once or twice, but never gotten close enough to hear what he\u2019s saying.\nToday, he leans into the cat side of his thinking, lets himself get close, to twine around Kal\u2019s feet, close enough now to hear what he is saying.\nIt\u2019s not in English, whatever it is, nor in any of the other languages Bruce knows. Which is more than a few.\nAfter a few minutes, he is able to discern a pattern in the muttering. A single word, than two or three variants on the same word. He\u2019s conjugating. Bruce has studied enough languages to know the pattern of someone else doing the same.\nAnd suddenly, he\u2019s sure, with the intuition he has honed over his entire life, that this is Kryptonian. Kal is practicing his Kryptonian.\nWhich means, which has to mean, that he doesn\u2019t already know it.\nBruce has had his suspicions, since the phone call last night, or perhaps since hearing Lane say \u2018Smallville\u2019 so casually, that Kal didn\u2019t come to Earth as adult as he\u2019d implied.\nBut to not even know the language of his own people. How young was he when he got here? Young enough to be taken in by a human family. Young enough to be raised as a human, with a human name. With human parents. Does Kal think of himself as human?\nBruce thinks that he might.\nThough Kal\u2019s face is creased with concentration and there is no sign of distress in his face or voice, it strikes Bruce as terribly sad, to study a language you should have been raised with. He had lost his own parents so young, but he had known them, had spoken with them. He doesn\u2019t think that Kal can say the same.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKal doesn\u2019t sleep much. Sometimes he gets home late, coming through the window as Superman. Sometimes he returns from work as Clark Kent, then leaves from the apartment. Sometimes, he makes all appearances of settling in, only to jerk his head up at some alert only he can hear.\nBruce unearths the remote from under the couch, keeps an eye on the news. He watches Superman help tsunami victims, and come back with mud on his boots. He sees him fight monsters, and return without a scratch. He watches all the reports with the single minded focus he devotes to everything, but has never had the time to fully dedicate to Superman.\nHe watches reports of a construction worker saved from a fall, of bank robbers apprehended, of fires put out and ships saved and kittens rescued, and he can\u2019t even blame himself for not thinking that Superman might have a civilian persona. He doesn\u2019t know how Kal has the time to do all that he does and hold a job.\nAnd yet. And yet, he spends his evenings, and some of his days, saving people. Then he comes home and eats crappy food and pulls out his laptop and does work for the Daily Planet and practices his Kryptonian and calls the woman he calls Ma faithfully. Not every night, but often enough to be notable. He brushes his teeth like a human, washes his face like a human, goes to bed like a human.\nThen he wakes up after one, maybe two hours of sleep, and does it again.\nOn Tuesday, it\u2019s one of the good nights, when Kal is back before sunrise and could get what a human might call a good night\u2019s sleep. Bruce has taken to sleeping just under the bed, to keep an eye on his comings and goings without getting in the way or being stepped on.\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night when Bruce is jolted awake, and for a split second the rattling of the bed makes him think of an earthquake. Then reality sets in, the solidness of the floor beneath him, the inexplicable sudden chill in the room. The noises from the bed.\nThere is no mistaking them; noises of fear, of terror. The bed shakes again, and Bruce gets out from under it.\nKal\u2019s face is twisted in fear, and every exhale leaves a pale cloud in the air, dropping the temperature in the room another few degrees. When he thrashes, the whole bed shakes. Bruce is suddenly, terribly aware that this is the most out of control he has ever seen Superman.\nAnd yet.\nAnd yet, there is no anger in his face, only pain and despair. There is nothing alien in that face, nothing that Bruce hasn\u2019t seen in his own face, on the faces of people he\u2019s saved. On the face of his ward, on the nights that Dick had crawled into his bed, shaking from nightmares.\nNo one who lives the lives they lead\u2014lives of never being fast enough, of fighting the odds with every life they save\u2014escapes unscathed. Nightmares are part of the deal, if you care. And Clark cares. Bruce has seen it, can read it in every word of his articles, in every late night, every time his head jerks up at something only he can hear. Bruce can see it now, in the fearful twist of his face.\nWhat does Superman fear?\nBruce thinks he knows, now.\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s an easy choice. It\u2019s easy to bury the fear of Superman\u2019s strength, or his other myriad of abilities and focus instead on Clark.\nBruce has woken from his own nightmares often enough to know not to startle him, but it\u2019s easy enough to get onto the bed, to press his paws to Clark\u2019s shoulder, settling his weight onto him. He leans into the cat side of his thinking, lets himself knead at Clark\u2019s shoulder, stiff with tension, until the thrashing slows. From there, he climbs carefully onto Clark\u2019s chest, curling up in the broad center of him. The room is still cold, and the warmth of Clark\u2019s body is not unpleasant.\nClark has gone still, though his face is still tense. Bruce follows some instinct he doesn\u2019t recognize and lets himself settle into Clark\u2019s warmth, focusing on the feel of his chest rising and falling until a low purr begins to fill the room.\nSlowly, the room gets warmer, the tension melts from Clark\u2019s frame. If Clark fully wakes up, Bruce isn\u2019t aware of it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the sun that wakes Bruce up next. Clark, he has learned, likes to sleep with his curtains cracked, so that the morning sun falls on him. It\u2019s disgusting.\nBruce is still curled up on Clark\u2019s chest, and it takes an effort of will not to recoil. Being a cat is bad\u2014terrible\u2014but there is something about the sheer vulnerability, the implied affection, of sleeping on\u2014with\u2014on someone like this that makes it worse.\nBut Clark\u2019s face is still, his chest rising and falling evenly, and Bruce finds that he doesn\u2019t want to disturb him. Instead, Bruce fights the purr that wants to escape him, and watches the beam of sunlight move up Clark\u2019s body until it hits him in the face.\nClark wrinkles his nose, scrunches his whole face, and comes awake. He seems startled to find Bruce on his chest, and he raises one hand tentatively to pet him, scratching gently behind his ears then dragging his hand down Bruce\u2019s spine. Bruce allows this for a few long strokes, until he feels the purr burst from his own chest, unbidden.\nHe immediately stands, dislodging Clark\u2019s hand, and hops off of the bed. Clark doesn\u2019t give any indication of remembering his nightmare; no traces of it linger on his face or body.\nBruce watches him from the couch as he gets ready, brushing his teeth, slicking his hair back, putting on the ill-fitting suit and bulky glasses. When he leaves, no one would ever guess he\u2019d had the kind of nightmares that could shake the building now. No one would ever think he was hiding anything.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClark hands in his article on Thursday, a full week after he took Bruce into his apartment. Bruce doesn\u2019t know what his deadlines are like, but he suspects Clark takes them seriously.\n\u201cThey\u2019re letting me choose more of my own assignments lately, if I can find something worth writing about. I\u2019m usually pretty good at it.\u201d\nBruce just bets he is. The two of them are sitting on the couch, Bruce sitting beside Clark, absently letting himself get pet.\nClark has a tendency to talk aloud, especially when Bruce is within petting distance. Bruce can find no reason not to encourage this. He\u2019s debating to Bruce the merits of two different topics when Bruce sees the familiar quick tilt of Clark\u2019s head.\nThis time, it\u2019s not urgent, no rush to leave. Instead, he looks puzzled. Thoughtful.\nBruce pushes his paw into Clark\u2019s stomach, slowly, so that he doesn\u2019t just bounce right off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026someone unexpected,\u201d Clark says slowly. \u201cSomewhere I\u2019m not supposed to go.\u201d Whatever he heard, he is still hearing it, because the lines around his mouth tighten. \u201cIt could be a trap.\u201d\n\u2018Then don\u2019t go,\u2019 Bruce wants to say. He digs his claws into Clark\u2019s thigh. Clark hisses, but Bruce knows better than to think he\u2019s hurt him. He\u2019s seen Clark make the same sound after touching the hot stove, a learned reaction to anything that might hurt a human.\n\u201cI think, it sounds genuine.\u201d Clark edges Bruce off his lap, and Bruce wants to curse at him. This stupid idiot. If even he thinks it\u2019s a trap, then it probably is. But he\u2019s going to go anyway.\nWhen the window clicks shut, Bruce curls up in the middle of Clark\u2019s bed to wait for him. He\u2019s not worried about Clark, of course. If Clark gets hurt, disappears, no one will feed him. He\u2019ll have to figure out how to walk from Metropolis to Gotham as a cat.\nWhen Clark does return, he\u2019s not hurt, not even ruffled. Instead, his face is creased in thought, his jaw clenched tight. He only barely pauses to change into his pajamas before he moves to the couch.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a trap,\u201d he says, but there is tension in his voice. Bruce follows him out, jumping up to lay near Clark\u2019s feet. Clark is more likely to talk to him if he\u2019s within reach. That\u2019s all it is. \u201cA\u2026\u201d Clark pauses, \u201can ally has gone missing. If you can even call him that.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI\u2019d like to call him that.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize he had such a big team. A sidekick, someone with him on the tech. People who notice when he goes missing. People who are worried,  personally worried.\u201d He\u2019s talking about Batman, Bruce realizes. Someone, Dick, probably, had called him, had told him.\nBruce is momentarily so furious that he can\u2019t breathe, can hardly think. He takes a moment to rein himself in. Clark won\u2019t understand this level of anger from a cat. It\u2019s not Clark\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not even Dick\u2019s fault, not really. He\u2019s just a kid, and Bruce has been missing for a week. A week with no word, no check in. The real surprise is that it took a week for Dick to reach out.\nWhen Bruce gets himself under control, he realizes that Clark is still talking.\n\u201c\u2026always saying that he works alone, and this whole time\u2014when I would give anything for\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off, putting his head in his hands, before Bruce can hear what he would give anything for. \u201cI\u2019m being selfish,\u201d he says. Bruce has heard him say it before, like a condemnation. Often about things, normal, human things that are not selfish at all.\nClark views any instance of wanting things for himself as unforgivable, and Bruce hurts every time he hears it. Bruce butts his head against Clark\u2019s hand, feels Clark absently move to pet him.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Clark says. \u201cHe\u2019s in trouble, missing. The kid, he wouldn\u2019t tell me how long it\u2019s been, but I highly doubt that anyone on that team would try to contact me unless it had been a week or longer.\u201d He lets out a breath. \u201cThat stubborn asshole.\u201d\nBruce is startled to hear Clark speak like that, even more to hear it applied to himself. Not that he disagrees.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying for months to get him to listen, to agree that we could be a good team, and then shit like this happens. I don\u2019t even know how to help. But there\u2019s a kid out there, who loves him and I can\u2019t not help. He, God, he\u2019ll be furious if I get involved. But\u2026\u201d Clark swallows. \u201cI never thought of him as someone who was loved.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s heart clenches. He knows that Alfred cares, that Dick cares. But to hear it laid out like this, by what should be an objective observer. For Dick to reach out to Superman, when he knows how much Bruce would hate it. But it\u2019s been a week, and Bruce has thought of Gotham, but he hadn\u2019t thought to let the people in his life know that he was okay.\nBruce is accustomed to his own selfishness, so different from Clark\u2019s, but this was an almost cruel oversight. He should have known they would worry, should have found a way to reach out. He could have sent an email, when he had access to Clark\u2019s computer.\n\u201cI checked Gotham,\u201d Clark is saying. \u201cIf he was there, it wasn\u2019t in the suit.\u201d\nAnd that is interesting, the Clark could recognize the suit, but not Bruce outside of it. Bruce had wondered, before, if Clark knew who he was. If he had looked through the kevlar and mechanics and found the clues of Bruce\u2019s identity. \u00a0Now he knows.\nHe wonders if there is something in the makeup of the suit that prevents him seeing through it, or if it was just Clark\u2019s own code of honor, a determination not to unmask another hero. Before, Bruce would have said he was certain of the answer.\nNow, in Clark\u2019s home, surrounded as he is by Clark\u2019s own secrets, he has a different theory. That Clark, who so clearly loves the life he has, and who works so hard to keep it a secret, would not want to take that secret from anyone else.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClark gets back late the following day, leaving Bruce with little to do around the apartment. The information he picks up here is invaluable but only in the hours that Clark is actually home. The rest of the apartment has been thoroughly explored, mapped out and dissected.\nBruce has gone through the apartment three times now\u2014updating his conclusions based on what he learns from Clark. The photos of Clark with his family, telling of a life on a farm, somewhere midwestern and rural. The tchotchkes, mementos of either Superman\u2019s travels or Clark\u2019s, Bruce isn\u2019t sure. He wants to find out. The cheap furniture, the acquisitions of a man on a budget. No facade, no safe house.\nHe\u2019d gone through the bills again, a few left out. Clark Kent is a man living just inside his means\u2014and that was considering the Daily Planet paystub that showed just how much of an already meager paycheck was sent to one Martha Kent.\nThe last feels like a cruel joke. Martha. Another Martha with a son who loved her, a son who wants to protect her. A son who wants to change the world.\nWhen Clark does get home, Bruce is pacing back and forth. His own thoughts make him agitated. He needs to get back to Gotham, back to his family. What else is there to know about Superman, about Clark Kent? But at the same time, Clark feels like a faceted gem, and Bruce will never stop learning about him.\nClark drops down onto the couch, and he pats the spot next to him on the couch almost absently. Bruce finds himself responding, jumping up beside him and curling up against Clark\u2019s thigh. God, he\u2019s becoming domesticated.\nStill, it\u2019s hard to protest when Clark gently scratches his ears, or when he begins to speak. His voice is tired in a way his body surely never is, and it\u2019s not hard to think that Clark needs this as well.\n\u201cI went looking again. Still nothing. I have no idea what they want me to do. I don\u2019t want to undermine him in Gotham by being too visible while he\u2019s gone, but\u2026\u201d he trails off. Bruce paws at his leg. \u201cI have to assume that they\u2019re looking for his civilian identity, but without the suit or him literally yelling for me, there just isn\u2019t much I can do.\u201d\nClark tilts his head back against the couch, and Bruce is struck by how much this bothers him. It bothers him that he can\u2019t help Batman, a man who has always professed to hate him, who has rebuffed every gesture of friendship or teamwork.\n\u201cI can\u2019t give up,\u201d he says after long moment. \u201cI just, I know that we could be a good team. If he ever gets his head out of his goddamn ass, I think he would see it too.\u201d Bruce bites at Clark\u2019s hand on its next pass by his head, but Clark hardly seems to notice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this alone forever,\u201d Clark confesses, and it\u2019s so soft that Bruce hardly hears him.\nWhat must it have been like, growing up in a small, midwestern town. Developing powers, learning to hide them like other people learn to ride bikes. Always knowing that he was different, always being afraid to hurt someone, equally afraid to be discovered. Never able to make close friendships, with so much to hide?\nBruce was wrong to push him away. He can see now, see what Clark has always seen. Together, they can be magnificent. Together, they can change the world.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Saturday, as promised, Clark goes to visit his mother. He doesn\u2019t take Bruce with him, because why would he?\nHe\u2019s back by midafternoon, his arms full of tupperware, with dirt under his nails and a chagrined look on his face.\n\u201cShe always gives me too much food,\u201d he says to Bruce, rueful. While he loads it into the refrigerator, Bruce amuses himself with the image of Superman flying back across the country with a week\u2019s worth of leftovers in his arms. He\u2019s almost glowing, though whether that\u2019s from seeing his mother or a morning spent under unrelenting sunlight, Bruce can\u2019t say. He would do terribly in Gotham, perpetually overcast and foggy even in the summer.\n\u201cThe tractor is acting up again,\u201d he tells Bruce. \u201cMa does her best, of course, but it\u2019s always been fussy. Says I\u2019m better with it.\u201d His mouth quirks. \u201cBeing able to pick it up for maintenance doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nBruce watches from his own spot on the couch as Clark browses idly for used tractors. Bruce can\u2019t imagine what a good price would be, or what Clark\u2019s budget is, but Clark clearly doesn\u2019t find anything he\u2019s looking for. He sets his laptop down with a frustrated sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can just pick up a few extra shifts,\u201d he mutters.\nHow hard would it be, Bruce wonders, to have a tractor replaced? A gift from an anonymous benefactor would raise red flags, of course, but there were other ways\u2026 He turns them over in his mind, drifting pleasantly as Clark pets him. He hardly stirs when Clark pulls his laptop back towards him and begins research on his newest article. \u00a0\nHe\u2019s roused later as Clark sets his laptop down with a decisive noise, face already turned to the window. \u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Clark doesn\u2019t finish, already off the couch. A blink, and he\u2019s suited up. Another, and he\u2019s gone.\nIt\u2019s the first time since Dick reached out to Superman that Bruce has had access to Clark\u2019s computer, already unlocked and open.\nIt\u2019s hard enough to open an incognito window with his stupid cat paws, much less open up the secure email address he uses when compromised. But, after more time then he would ever admit to, he gets a message to Alfred, an all-safe codeword that means he\u2019s not in immediate danger but will not be making it home yet. He doesn\u2019t know how long Clark will be gone, and he can\u2019t risk a longer explanation. He\u2019s not sure where to even begin.\nIt had already taken too much time to route the email through enough proxies that Alfred wouldn\u2019t be able to track the email back to Clark\u2019s address. There is nothing to be gained by having Alfred, or worse, Dick, storm the place looking for a hostage. No need to tip off to anyone that he knows that Clark Kent is anything more than he appears.\nAnd, more than he wants to admit, he doesn\u2019t want to betray Clark\u2019s secret.\nOnly when he\u2019s shut down the email, hidden all traces that the computer was in use, does he let himself turn on the television. He doesn\u2019t have to look to find what had caught Clark\u2019s attention\u2014it\u2019s the main story on every channel.\nBruce has seen a lot of crazy things over the years, not even counting the appearance of a flying alien in primary colors, but this\u2014this is something else.\nThere is a giant purple robot terrorizing downtown Metropolis. It\u2019s easily the size of a building, towering over the pedestrians in the street. In the center of its chest, a lurid green light seems to be powering it.\nSuperman is mid-battle, but he\u2019s hindered in ways the robot is not. His attention is split between the fight and his surroundings, clearly careful not to hurt any of the civilians or cause too much structural damage.\nBruce watches in horror as the robot backhands Clark through a neighboring building. It\u2019s can\u2019t have done much damage to Superman himself but then\u2014who knows how much damage Superman can withstand?\nSuperman flies from the building, back at the robot. He dodges the next swing of the robot\u2019s fists, and lands up uppercut to it\u2019s jaw that rocks it back. They\u2019ve been at this long enough that the streets have emptied out, but Bruce sees the cars crushed underfoot as it staggers.\nIf they keep the fight out in the open, in the middle of the city, someone will get hurt.\nSuperman knows it too, by the way he\u2019s trying to steer it back, but he\u2019s too close to it. As he fights, it\u2019s so easy to see the places where a partner would be able to help\u2014where Batman would be able to help.\nSuperman is smart, there\u2019s no denying that, but he\u2019s not a strategist in the way that Bruce has trained himself to be. Superman is bright and bold and strong, but he can\u2019t get in undetected, unnoticed. Together, with Clark as the focus, dealing heavy damage and Bruce there to get in close, sneak under its defenses, they might have already defeated it.\nIs it Bruce\u2019s imagination, or is Clark slowing down? He lands another hit, but this one doesn\u2019t send the robot staggering back, only rocks it in place. When he comes in again, the robot actually manages to catch him, throwing him to the ground.\nBruce barely has time to worry before Clark is up again, but his motions are stiff, labored. There is sweat on his brow. Another round of hits are exchanged\u2014Bruce is useless, only able to sit here and think how he would be able to help, if he were there\u2014and this time, when Clark comes up, there is blood in his mouth, smearing on his face. It looks wrong. Clark shouldn\u2019t bleed.\nIs it that the fight is strenuous, wearing him down? Or is it something in the robot itself? Is he vulnerable to robots? But no, that makes no sense. There is nothing unique to robots that wouldn\u2019t apply to other technology, and he\u2019s seen Clark use a laptop with ease.\nBut, maybe, something about  this robot. His eyes are drawn again to that green glow. A power system\u2014or a defense system? Clark seems to be steering clear of the chest, even though center mass would be an easier hit. Instead, he aims for the head, the legs.\nBut even he seems to realize that it\u2019s an untenable solution. Bruce seems him hit the chest cavity, sees the green light flare up.\nSees Clark falter.\nClark actually drops several feet, as if his ability of flight has given out on him, but he catches himself. Still, it\u2019s no imagination now. He\u2019s slower, weaker. Dangerously so. The robot knocks him to the ground again, and it takes too long for Clark to get up. Long enough for Bruce to fear\u2014\nThen Clark shoots out of the crater he had made, impossibly fast\u2014desperately fast. And maybe it\u2019s the speed, or just one last rush of adrenaline, but he manages to hook onto the robot, enough to lift it off its feet, carry it up and up. It\u2019s an effort, it\u2019s clearly an effort, but he manages to get clear of the buildings, then the city, until he\u2019s out of sight.\nThe news helicopters aren\u2019t fast enough to follow him. Bruce doesn\u2019t know what happens after that.\nAll he can do is wait.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA bit after dawn, Clark comes in through the window and, for the first time that Bruce has seen him, doesn\u2019t go immediately to change. He collapses face first on the bed, and doesn\u2019t move. For a second, Bruce thinks that he\u2019s being dramatic- he\u2019s seen Dick pull the same move when sulking or exhausted from training.\nBut Clark is still, terrifyingly still. There is no blood, not that Bruce can see, but that doesn\u2019t always mean anything. He can see Clark\u2019s face in profile, pressed into the mattress. He\u2019s pale, with sweat beading at his hairline, his temples. Bruce didn\u2019t think he was capable of sweat.\nAt a loss, unable to help\u2014a fucking cat\u2014Bruce jumps onto the bed and nudges at Clark\u2019s hand. The fingers twitch weakly, like Clark is trying to pet him. When Bruce looks up, there is one blue eye peering down at him. Not unconscious, then.\nBruce nudges his hand again, and it\u2019s clear that Clark is trying to lift his arm. Trying, and failing. It is terrifying to see him struggling, pulls at a part of Bruce he\u2019d thought reserved exclusively for Dick, Alfred and the ghosts of his parents. Then Clark groans, agonized, and his hand falls again.\nHe\u2019s shivering now, a tremble that runs through his entire body. When Bruce nudges at Clark\u2019s hand again, it\u2019s clammy, cold. Worse, it doesn\u2019t twitch this time. He\u2019s going into shock. Bruce doesn\u2019t know how to help. All his first aid training, all his experience, and he\u2019s going have to watch someone die in front of him.\nCarefully, mindful of any internal injuries, he moves to Clark\u2019s back, trying to see if there is anything he can do, any wound to which he can apply pressure, any sign of what\u2019s slowly killing him.\nWhen he moves, something catches the light, and Bruce stops. He turns his head, slowly, trying to catch it again. A fine green powder coats Clark\u2019s suit, the bits of skin Bruce can see, his hair. It\u2019s broken up only by larger green crystals like splinters, none of them larger than an inch. Bruce is sure, utterly certain, that this is the cause of Clark\u2019s sickness. And there is nothing he can do about it.\nHe bats away all the larger pieces, knocking them to the floor, but it does very little. He moves around to nudges at Clark\u2019s face, trying to wake him.\nThen the phone starts to ring. Clark had moved it to the bedside table before leaving, and it\u2019s easy to see the caller. Ma. The picture that comes up is the same woman from the living room photos, her face lined and friendly. Calling because she, surely, had seen the news report as well. Because she was worried about her son.\nClark seems to realize that as well, because he stirs again. He tries to reach for the phone, trying to - what? Reassure her? Give his last words to someone who loves him? Bruce isn\u2019t sure which thought it more devastating.\nClark can\u2019t reach it. The phone stops ringing, and Clark slumps back down. Bruce nudges at his chin again, trying to keep him awake. He has to stifle that cat impulse to lick him, but he has no idea what ingesting those crystals will do to him, especially with a cat\u2019s metabolism.\nThe phone rings again, and Bruce closes his eyes in despair. It\u2019s Lois Lane this time, and once again it rings through. Bruce is glad that smartphones no longer play voicemails out loud. He couldn\u2019t bear to hear their desperation, their concern.\nIt rings thrice more, two more times from Ma Kent and another from Lane. He feels utterly helpless. Clark is still groggily conscious, but only barely. He makes aborted reaches for the phone each time it rings, his face creasing with effort.\nBruce wants to say he doesn\u2019t remember the last time he felt so helpless, but of course he does. In a dark alley in Gotham, over fifteen years ago.\nThe worst part is knowing that, somewhere out there in the world is a woman who is desperately, terribly concerned for her son. Who had seen him fall and seen him fly away and hadn't even had the comfort that Bruce had, of knowing that he had gotten home, had made it at least as far as his apartment.\nAs far as Ma Kent knows, as far as Lane knows, Clark had lost the battle to the robot, out of sight of the camera. He could have fallen into the ocean or been knocked down and speared through and none of them would have any idea.\nHis desperation is mutating into something physical, something pressing. He can feel it in every part of his body, filling him like hot water, tingling and urgent and terrible. It builds in him, unbearably and irrefutably until, like a sudden drop in pressure, it pops.\nEvery part of Bruce's body hurts, every inch of him tingles in pins and needles, his fingers and toes arching with released pressure. And then he realizes that he has fingers and toes, that every inch of his body is his own. He's still in the batsuit, the cowl pulled up over his face, his cape brushing the hardwood floors of Clark's apartment.\nHe doesn't have time to be surprised, to be relieved. He rushes immediately to Clark's bed and turns him over.\nClark groans again, face twisted. He's still shivering, still pale and clammy. He's clearly deep in shock and it's a miracle he's still conscious.\nHis eyes focus blearily on Bruce's face, and Bruce thinks he's probably too deep in shock to be truly surprised.\n\"You,\" he says, and his voice is muddy, slurred.\n\"Me,\" Bruce agrees. He's startled by his own voice distortion, but there is nothing for it now. \"What do you need?\" He brushes the green glitter from Clark's hair, but it rains down on his pillow and doesn't help.\n\"I ws lookin for you,\" Clark says. He reaches out and clasps Bruce's shoulder with a weak hand. \"Found you.\"\nIt's more true than he knows. It he weren't so sick, it the situation weren't so desperate, it would be funny. \"What do you need?\"\nClark's stare moves past him, clearly fading out again. His hand on Bruce's shoulder goes lax.\n\"Superman,\" Bruce snaps, not letting any desperation into his voice. Then, with no response, \"Clark.\"\nThat works. Clark's gaze snaps to him, and then moves around the room. For the first time, he registers his surroundings, his own apartment, Batman's presence in it. He looks afraid. Bruce shakes his shoulder, gently. \"What do you need?\"\nClark focuses back on his face, and whatever he reads in it seems to relax him. \"Suit,\" he forces out.\nOf course. Between the two of them- mostly Bruce but with Clark's weak instructions and weaker help, the they get the suit off. It crumples to the ground between them, the crystals glittering in the folds. Without it, Clark is almost able to stand. He's back in a different pair of plaid boxers\u2014the suit is so tight, how does that even work?\u2014 and Bruce is hit by a wave of affection that almost knocks \u00a0him over.\n\"Shower,\" he says definitively, as Clark sways and almost falls. He has to all but drag Clark into the bathroom. He leaves the boxers on;, the suit seems to have stopped anything from getting through it, all newly exposed skin is tan and whole and free of crystals.\nBruce starts the water and all but shoves Clark under it. He ends up taking off his own gloves, just to dump a quart of shampoo onto Clark's hair and scrub vigorously. With his help, Clark is able to get his head back under the faucet to rinse.\nWhen it's all gone from his hair, Clark is already better. He stands straight instead of swaying, and when he meets Bruce's eyes, his own are clear and full of suspicion. \"I can take it from here,\" he says coolly.\nBruce wants to protest but, of course, he has no good reason to do so. If Clark can stand, he can certainly wash himself. He bites back his first response and just nods, heading back to the bedroom.\nAt a loss, and strangely unused to his own body, he reaches for the Superman suit. It will have to be washed, and thoroughly. He doubts Superman has a reliable dry cleaner for such things. Although, he'd has a designated cat-contact, so maybe he does.\nThe green crystals are embedded in the fibers, some of them worked so deep Bruce can could hardly see them. He picks out the shards he can, \u00a0lets them fall to the floor, and sets the suit aside.\nThen, worried that just returning to this room and it's crystal debris will make Clark worse again, he takes off the sheets and the pillowcase, where green dust still glitters, puts them with the suit. He unearths a small dustpan from under the bed and makes a small pile. And it is small, terrifyingly so. That this much, less than a handful of dust, could have reduced Superman to such an extent.\nHe surveys the pile, unsure what to do with it. He can't just throw it away or toss it out the window, but he can't keep it in the apartment either.\n\"Lead shielding.\"\nGod, he hadn't even heard Clark approach. He turns, and Clark is back in the Met U sweats and loose shirt that Bruce has become accustomed to.\n\"Hm?\"\nClark tilts his head to indicate to pile of green crystals and even looking at it seems to make him pale. \"If you put it in lead shielding, that helps.\" He gives Bruce another cold, suspicious look. \"I take it you aren't going to throw it away?\" The subtext is an accusation, that Bruce would take it with him. Bruce can't say the thought didn't cross his mind.\n\"Do you have any lead?\" he asks.\nClark doesn't answer, but turns on his heels and begins to rummage through the hall closet. He pulls out a brightly colored box, covered in striped wrapping paper. He hands it to Bruce with a look that dares him to comment on it.\nBruce peers inside, and, sure enough, the entire thing is lined with thin lead sheeting. He gently scoops up the crystal and tips it into the box. Mutely, Clark hands him a lid, and the second that it closes over the top, his entire face relaxes. He still doesn't come fully into the room, staying clear of the pile of sheets and suit and crystals.\n\"Did you want to?\" Bruce tilts his head towards the door and the living room beyond it.\nClark makes a face, he moves out into the living room. \"Coffee?\"\nBruce stares at his back. Clark is clearly furious, clearly scared, clearly thinking about how much Bruce knows, how much he can be trusted. And yet. And yet, he offers him coffee. Bruce's mouth twitches, hiding a smile. Clark Kent might be Superman, and an alien from another planet, but he is also clearly midwestern to the core.\n\"Yes, please.\"\nThey stand in silence while it brews, the sound of the coffee dripping into the pot almost overwhelmingly loud in the apartment.\nClark, pointedly, hands him the coffee in a Superman mug. Bruce has to stifle another smile.\n\"So.\" Clark leans against the counter and takes a sip of his own cup. For a man only recently recovered from near death, he looks remarkably solid. Healthy. \"You were my cat.\"\nBruce winces, takes a sip of his coffee to hide it, and winces again. It's very hot. Clark gives him amused look and very pointedly takes a long gulp from his own cup, and sighs in satisfaction. Bruce resists the childish urge to do the same, to scald himself just to prove a point. \u00a0\n\"Yes,\" he says, calm because he can't be anything else.\n\"Was it,\u201d Clark hesitates, his hands tight around the coffee mug. That grip is an illusion, Bruce thinks wildly. It would take only the slightest effort to crush the mug completely, to let it fall in tiny shards and powered ceramic. Instead, Clark takes another sip, gathering himself. \"Did you intend to spy on me?\"\n\"You picked me up, if you recall,\" Bruce says. \"I was minding my own business.\"\n\"In a tree, with a storm coming,\" Clark say skeptically. Bruce fixes him with a cold look.\n\"I didn't intend for it to be you who found me.\" After a moment, he adds, \"I didn't intend to be found.\"\n\"Is it part of your,\" Clark gestures at the suit, the ears and the cape, \"your thing? Turning into a cat?\"\nBruce snorts, he can't help it. \"If I could control it, do you think I would have stayed here for over a week?\"\nClark's stare focuses on him. \"Your son is worried about you.\"\n\"He's not my-\" Bruce cuts himself off. He supposes, in all ways that matter, it's not a distinction worth making. \"He shouldn't have called you.\"\n\"He was worried,\" Clark repeats. He take another sip of his coffee, then carefully sets it down. His hands curl around the edges of the countertop. \"I think you can understand why I'm feeling,\" he hesitates, \"angry.\"\nBruce considers all the words he could have used instead. Humiliated. Exposed. Vulnerable. He's sure they would all be true. He can't imagine having someone crawl into the heart of him and see every secret, hear those secrets fall from his own lips.\n\"I can,\" he says. He does understand. \"I think you can understand that none of this was within my control.\"\nHe sees Clark's hands tighten on the counter. \"I can,\" he admits, and the words sound torn out of him. \"I still don't\u2014I still\u2014\" He bites his lip, and Bruce tracks the motion with his eyes before tearing his gaze away. He watches, instead, as Clark moves around the apartment, takes a seat on the couch.\nFor a long moment, Clark just stares at his own hands. \"I\u2014this life means everything to me. Being Clark Kent, having this apartment. It's important. I know you don't like me, that you don't trust me. But please. Don't\u2014Please let me keep this life.\"\nBruce stares at him, taken aback. Is there no end to the ways that Clark Kent will surprise him? But, of course, Clark has no way to know how much Bruce's opinion of him has changed. Has no way to know that Bruce  knows Clark now, trusts him. Believes in him, and the good he does\u2014both as Clark Kent and as Superman. The world would be worse off without both of them.\nBruce Wayne is supposed to be good with words\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be his one saving grace in a life of vice. He can charm, he can schmooze, he can talk anyone into anything. But it\u2019s as much a ruse as the drinking and the women. He can say anything when it doesn\u2019t matter. But something like this, with Clark so raw and vulnerable before him\u2014he can\u2019t think of a single word.\nInstead, he reaches up and pulls the cowl up and off.\nClark, who had been staring at his hands as he awaited Bruce\u2019s reply, jerks. His eyes jump to Bruce\u2019s face, searching. His mouth falls open, and Bruce can\u2019t be distracted by that at the moment.\n\u201cI. Wow.\u201d Clark clears his throat. \u201cI did not expect that.\u201d\nBruce, feeling at a loss, hating the sensation, holds out a hand. \u201cBruce Wayne. Pleasure to meet you.\u201d\nClark stands, seemingly on impulse, and Bruce wants to laugh again. A good midwestern boy. \u201cClark Kent.\u201d He ducks his head. \u201cBut you knew that.\u201d\nAfter a moment Clark starts to laugh, slumping back down onto the couch. Bruce raises a brow and waits him out.\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d Clark asks, then has to stop to catch his breath, \u201cDid you know we had a meeting scheduled, this week? You missed it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to reschedule,\u201d Bruce says with a smile, with Bruce Wayne\u2019s easy charm. Clark frowns at him.\n\u201cYou hate me.\u201d\nBruce bows his head. \u201cI did.\u201d\nClark catches on the past tense, as Bruce intended him too.\n\u201cWhat changed?\u201d\nBruce looks at him incredulously. Then he looks around the apartment, as if to indicate all of it. When Clark just looks at him, he says \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be afraid of a man who calls his mother with such regularity.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Ma!\u201d Clark says. \u201cI have to call her.\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer, gone into the bedroom and back again in a blink.\nBruce tunes him out as he calls her, reassuring her that he\u2019s fine.\n\u201cNo, Ma, please don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m fine. I had a,\u201d he hesitates, \u201ca friend help.\u201d He makes a noise of protest. \u201cI have friends!\u201d\nBruce forces his attention away again. It had become clear, over their week together, that Clark was desperately lonely. He had his mother, and he had Lane, and he had no one else. He examines the pictures again, easier to see how that he\u2019s not almost the same size.\nClark doesn\u2019t exactly look like the man and the woman in the photo, but there is something in the curve of the smile, the tilt of the head, that makes him resemble his parents. Years of familiarity, shaping their expressions into the same lines.\n\u201cMy Ma says thank you. For helping me.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone would have,\u201d Bruce says, uncomfortable with thanks and even more uncomfortable with thanks from a mother. He looks down at the shelf again. Bruce looks around, his eyes falling back on that shelf, with the pictures and tchotkes. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how human you were.\u201d\nClark shrugs, minutely. \u201cI try to keep it out of the press. Lois knows, of course.\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe says I\u2019m too trusting. It\u2019s probably a good thing she did the interview, she helped edit anything too incriminating.\u201d\nBruce nods. \u201cNo one looks for a secret identity if they don\u2019t think that you have one.\u201d\n\u201cIt has downsides. It\u2019s easier to think of me as, as other. As an alien.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bruce agrees. Not accepting blame, but not absolving himself of any either.\nClark looks down at the photo closest to him. \u201cThat\u2019s our farm, in Kansas.\u201d Kansas. Damn. Bruce\u2019d bet himself it was Iowa. Bruce reaches out and takes the snow globe next to it, shaking it. A silent question.\nClark laughs. \u201cThat was from Paris.\u201d Obviously. \u201cThere was this little kiosk, I stopped a robbery. But the owner didn\u2019t see him at first, and thought I was trying to rob the place. I was still,\u201d he indicates his glasses and casual clothes. \u201cOnce we got it sorted out, she gave it to me.\u201d He grins down at it. \u201cShe\u2019d hit me with her broom.\u201d\nBruce wants to sit on the couch with him, listen to Clark tell him about every tchotchke on the shelf, to hear him talk his parents and how he\u2019d developed his powers. He wants to know how many languages Clark has learned, wants Clark to teach him Kryptonian conjugations. He wants to know everything.\nBut he has responsibilities he\u2019s put off for too long, a family to get back to.\n\u201cI should go.\u201d\nClark watches him, speculative. \u201cMy offer still stands, you know. I think we\u2019d be a good team.\u201d\nBruce watches him back. It\u2019s not easy to admit when he\u2019s wrong. But somehow, it\u2019s not too hard to say, \u201cI think you might be right.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth it for the smile that blooms across Clark\u2019s face, wide and radiant. At short range, in his human body, it\u2019s devastating.\n\u201cDid you want a lift?\u201d Clark asks.\nBruce shakes his head. \u201cYou should rest. And wash that suit, before you wear it again.\u201d\nClark makes a face, confirming Bruce\u2019s suspicions about a washing machine.\n\u201cOr\u2026\u201d he starts, tentative. \u201cI have an industrial washer in my, back at my place. I could, help?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strange offer, foreign. Clark seems to sense it. They both know how much trust that would require.\n\u201cHow would I get it back?\u201d he asks, after a moment. Not a no.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to come for dinner, sometime.\u201d He grins. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you eat, it\u2019ll be good for you.\u201d\nClark makes a face at him, and it\u2019s shocking that this is so easy. To talk with him, joke with him.\n\u201cAlright, yeah. You should borrow something too. You\u2019re a bit conspicuous.\u201d\nBruce looks down at himself, the Batsuit especially absurd in Clark\u2019s well lit apartment. It\u2019s a look that lends itself best to dark alleys and shadowed corners. \u201cGood idea.\u201d\nIn the end, he packs the Batsuit in a duffle and Superman\u2019s suit in a backpack that Clark lined with lead sheeting he\u2019d pulled from a kitchen drawer.\nAfter a moment, Clark offers the bedsheets to Bruce as well. \u201cThey\u2019re useless to me at the moment, and I\u2019d rather not corrupt the apartment washer.\u201d\nBruce is never giving these monstrosities back to him. Clark probably won\u2019t notice if the replacements are Egyptian cotton. Probably.\n\u201cAre you going to keep the,\u201d he indicates the box, incongruously like a birthday gift, still in the middle of Clark\u2019s bedroom. Clark goes a little green at the thought of keeping it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if,\u201d he hesitates. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done so much, but,\u201d\nBut to trust someone who, only a month ago, hated your very existence, with a weapon to kill you is asking a lot.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Bruce says. He does.\nClark surveys him for a long moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s your boy\u2019s name?\u201d\nIt would be easy to find out the name of Bruce Wayne\u2019s ward, if he doesn\u2019t already know. That\u2019s not the point of the question.\nBruce thinks of everything he\u2019s seen, of Clark waking in the middle of the night, torn apart by nightmares of the people he\u2019s failed. Of Clark, pained and pale after a fight only he could win.\n\u201cDick,\u201d he can feel himself smile at the name. Bruce has missed him, he realizes. Him and Alfred both. He wants to go home. \u201cDick Grayson.\u201d\nClark nods, like this is just a confirmation, and picks up the box. \u201cPlease be careful with it.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s hands close around it, instinctive. \u201cI will.\u201d\nClark sees him to the door. Bruce pulls his borrowed cap over his face, hiding his own distinctive features, and it seems to work. He takes three cabs back to Gotham, making sure that there is no connection between a small Metropolitan apartment and Wayne Manor.\nDick meets him at the door, launching directly into his arms, and Bruce barely has time to drop the bags he\u2019s carrying to catch him.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d Dick says into his neck.\nBruce puts his arms around Dick. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d\nHe meets Alfred\u2019s eyes when he looks up, reads the same sentiment in his look.\nThere will be explanations later. Later, Bruce will tell Alfred the whole story. He\u2019ll let Dick hang on his arm and tell him all about meeting Superman. Later, Dick will ask \u201cDid Superman find you?\u201d and it will be easier than Bruce expected to say \u201cYes, he did.\u201d\nBut for now, he steps back into the Manor, still holding Dick, and lets Alfred put a hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cWelcome back, Master Bruce.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEpilogue:\nIt\u2019s strange to miss his cat, now that Clark knows his cat was secretly a human man in disguise the entire time. But Clark has never pretended to be the most rational person. He misses having something to take care of, misses the way the cat would curl up on his chest while he slept and purr, keeping the nightmares away.\nIt\u2019s a mortifying thought, all of the things that Batman had seen. His stupid boxers and the calls to his mother were the least of it, though it had been nice of Bruce not to mention anything else. Not to mention seeing Clark complain about loneliness, or the way that he woke up with a bitten back scream more than once.\nHe feels terribly exposed at the thought, vulnerable. Clark is private out of necessity and he recognizes that none of the situation was Batman\u2019s fault, but still. To have so much of his private self shown to someone\u2014anyone. It sounds overly dramatic, but so few people truly know him. People know Superman, or they know Clark Kent, and no one except his mother has seen him truly be Clark. Not even Lois, though she\u2019s probably come the closest.\nAdd to that the stupid emotional reaction of wanting his cat back, and Clark has been on edge all week. Lois hasn\u2019t bothered him, clearly thinking it\u2019s a residual effect from Saturday\u2019s fight, but that hardly registers after everything that followed.\nHe needs to get his suit back. It had made sense to give it to Batman at the time, when Batman\u2014when Bruce\u2014had trusted him with more than he had too, when Bruce had saved his life. But now, Clark needs to overcome his awkwardness about the whole situation enough to contact him. Which is easier said than done.\nAll in all, Clark would rather take on the robot again.\n\u201cHey, Smallville! Earth to Smallville.\u201d\nClark blinks back into focus as Lois waves her hand in front of his face. \u201cFunny.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to answer your phone?\u201d Lois asks. \u201cIt\u2019s been ringing.\u201d\nGod, how out of it was he? It is ringing, and by Lois\u2019s expression, mingled concern and irritation, it\u2019s been ringing for a bit.\n\u201cClark Kent, Daily Planet.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Clark Kent, Daily Planet. This is Bruce Wayne.\u201d After a beat, \u201cWayne Enterprises.\u201d\nClark stifles his surprise. Does thinking of the man summon him? From what he\u2019s seen of Batman, it wouldn\u2019t shock him. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he says. Lois has planted her butt on the edge of her desk, and he doesn\u2019t want to incriminate himself.\nBruce laughs, low and intimate through the phone. \u201cI believe that we have an interview to reschedule? Terribly sorry to have missed that first one. Something came up.\u201d\nClark can picture him, can picture the Bruce Wayne he\u2019s seen on tv, waving a frivolous hand.\n\u201cI hope it was something important,\u201d Clark says.\nWhen Bruce replies, his voice has dipped, ever so slightly, into his Batman register, and Clark fights a shiver. \u201cVery important. World changing, even.\u201d\nClark swallows. \u201cWell, then I guess I can\u2019t fault you.\u201d\n\u201cI should hope not. I\u2019d hate to offend you so early in our relationship.\u201d He\u2019s back to Bruce Wayne, flirty and flighty, and Clark finds the dichotomy of him fascinating.\n\u201cWhat time would work best for you, Mr. Wayne,\u201d he says, and curses to himself when he sees Lois\u2019 eyebrows shoot up.\n\u201cOh please, call me, Bruce. Mr. Wayne was my father.\u201d \u00a0When Clark doesn\u2019t reply to that, he says, \u201cHow about 7 o\u2019clock? Dinner?\u201d\n\u201cFor an interview?\u201d Clark asks, amused. Lois is making a face at him, like she can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to blow this.\n\u201cI\u2019m very flexible,\u201d Bruce says, and Clark almost blushes at the way he rolls the words out. He doesn\u2019t think this level of flirtation is necessary, when he knows who Bruce really is.\n\u201c7 o\u2019clock it is,\u201d he says, rather than rise to Bruce baiting him. \u201cWhere would you like to meet?\u201d\n\u201cOh, why don\u2019t you just swing by the Manor,\u201d Bruce says airily. As though Gotham isn\u2019t three hours away for a normal man. As if Bruce hasn\u2019t had a strict no-press policy on the Manor for almost two decades.\n\u201cThat works,\u201d Clark grins. Then, partly for Lois\u2019 benefit, and partly for Bruce\u2019s, he adds \u201cIs there a dress code?\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t disappoint, laughing. \u201cOh, I think I have a suit that will fit you.\u201d\nClark can\u2019t help grinning as he hangs up, and it\u2019s so, so worth the interrogation he\u2019s about to get from Lois.\nHe doesn\u2019t tell her anything worthwhile. A little curiosity is good for her.\n\u00a0"
