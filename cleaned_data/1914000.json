    "summary": "<p>Anthony J. Crowley's life seems like it's finally falling into place: his floral shop has begun to gain an undercurrent of appreciation in the design elite of London, and he might have even finally found a boyfriend who looks just right lounging on his Tenreiro sofa. Things seem almost perfect, until one day the empty shop across the street is leased to frumpy fellow Oxford alumni, who doesn't seem to remember Crowley nearly as well as he remembers him, which really shouldn't bother him as much as it does - it was ten years ago after all, and it wasn't even <i>that</i> good of a kiss.</p>\n<p>CW: animal injury (but they're gonna be just fine)</p>",

    "text": "There's a lorry across the street. It's been there for some time, and it doesn't seem to have any intention of moving in the near future. The side of it reads \"Charles and Son\u2019s Moving\" in bold, chipped blue letters, with a small illustration of some obscenely radiant mover grinning along side, and all the shameful apostrophe usage one might expect. The traffic on the thin cobbled street outside the shop continues to weave around it awkwardly, clogging up the already limited passage.\nCrowley glares at the intrusive vehicle, eyeing it over the proud heads of his paphlopedilums, spritzing bottle waiting between his fingers. Seems strange, it's been there for over an hour without any sign of action or life to it. It's unusual that it's there at all, come to think of it. He hadn't known anyone was moving in. The shop it's waiting in front of has since he set up in the neighborhood, and that was almost a year ago now. Anathema had told him the last tenant had been some disowned Brazilian heiress who designed custom cat sweaters and had run off with the mail carrier to for a new life in Seattle. But he's never exactly sure how much embellishment she sprinkles over those stories.\nHe should ignore the lorry. It's useless to focus on it. If it looms at him for another hour he might, might call the police, but only if the beaming little man on the side continued to stare at him in that patronizing way.\nCrowley turns back to the shop. It always looks it's best at this time of day, when the light is slanting in from the eastern end of the street. It had taken him three months to get the place in shape when he first came, but now, it was finally settling into itself. \nIt's small, but not cramped, clean, simple, just right for his needs. He'd lined the north wall with a tiered display of his succulents, arranged in driftwood and recycled containers. The south wall holds the orchids and mosses on geometric shelving of restored wood. The floor he'd replaced first off when he arrived, crinkled linoleum torn out for smooth poured concrete which didn't slip after waterings like wood or tile would. His cutting table, solid wood with steel legs, takes up one side of the floor, shears and wrappings neatly arranged. The fridges glow in the back behind the counter for storage. There's always plenty of space by the front garage-door windows and around the register for arrangements. At first he hadn't been sure if he could do it, sit in a shop all day and actually work like a proper human being, after the law firms and fish-bowl offices and all the rest of it. But it had settled over him in a shockingly comfortable way, and he didn't know now how he'd ever done anything else. \nIt's been a slow morning so far, which maybe is at least somewhat of an excuse for obsessing over the lorry. Summer has finally set in good and proper over the city, slipping down London's streets with all it's sultry, lazy confidence. It's warm enough that he's opened the garage-doors on the front of the shop, letting the day make it's way inside in gentle pushes and soft breathes. One of the things he loves about their street is the lack of that particular oozing, pungent summer Thames scent that seeps out with greater vigor in warmer weather. Today the breeze easing through the open windows is wonderfully pleasant, the heat slinks around the young foliage of the trees that line the sidewalk, pressing itself through the open door of the bakery five doors down, circling around the musty cobbles of the road, and finally settling in around him and the usual watery, floral scent of his shop, which today is fairly dominated by the fresh order of lilacs waiting to be arranged on the cutting table.\nThe lilacs are next on his list of morning tasks. He'd watered the orchids first thing, then circled round to the succulents and mosses. He'd changed the water in the arrangements waiting for pickup in the fridges, and popped a few in the windows before flipping the sign. There had been the register opening, and a few emails with an espresso, and now he's just has the second pass on the orchids to finish off. The lilac arrangements will be enjoyable, he's received excellent palette variety for the season. The purples were starting to fade in the park, but these are still strong, and the whites and pinks are lush and full. There's ten arrangements due for the new bistro over on Dover Street, and he'll have another five or six for in-shop display. They'll be good for three days at least and he'll easily sell them off by then. That is if anyone can actually manage to find their way in through the clotted vein of traffic surrounding that blood lorry.\nThe bell above the door gives a light ring. Crowley glances over and tries not to smile too quickly.\n\"Hullo,\" Crowley calls idly, finishing a few spritzes on the dendrobiums.\n\"Same to you,\" Lucius smiles cleanly. He's wearing a precisely cut Armani navy today, color just light enough to be seasonal, with a pale pink pocket-square peering from the left breast. His hair's brushed back neat and tidy, sides close and fashionably undercut, top long enough to have just the right height. His Gucci sunglasses cut a sharp line under his strong brows, the tortoise shell frames matching his oxford's laces. \n\"How are you?\" Lucius asks.\n\"Alright,\" Crowley says, placing his spritzer neatly down on the cutting table, wiping his hands on his pristine and snugly tied apron. \"Not a terrible day thus far.\"\nLucius moves a few steps deeper into the shop. Even a meter or so away from him Crowley can smell the sandalwood edge of his cologne. \n\"Lovely lilacs,\" Lucius observes.\n\"Oh,\" Crowley glances towards them. \"Yes, they'll do nicely. Came in this morning. It's a strong selection.\"\n\"Any extras?\" Lucius smiles. His teeth shine, brilliant and straight, tidy as his tightly cropped beard.\nCrowley can't help smiling right back. \"There might be. If you're lucky.\"\n\"Good,\" Lucius returns. \"I'm feeling lucky.\"\nCheeky. Crowley narrows his eyes with a smirk. \"Is that right?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" Lucius answers, he leans back against the counter, running a finger along the smooth wooden top. \"I've finally leased that bloody antique across the street.\"\nAnd there it was. \"That's why that damned lorry has been there all day?\" Crowley almost shouts, suddenly crossing the floor quickly to glower at it again.\n\"That's right, someone's finally moving into the relic. They'll give the dust bunnies some company.\"\nCrowley stares at the shop across the street. The whole building has always looked slightly askew to him, as it someone wrapped two massive hands around it and twisted ever so slightly. The black paint on the door and the shop-front has chipped to reveal an ugly abrasive green underneath, windows misted with dust and age. The truth is he's always rather liked the old thing. It's quiet, and yes, there is a creeping Dickensian strangeness to the place that wasn't exactly fashionable, but there was just something so very London about it. It looked as if it hadn't changed in four hundred years, as ageless as the cobbles on the street before it, and he rather enjoyed that edged romance. \n\"It's a shame that the owner wouldn't cough up for a full renovation,\" Lucius says behind him. \"The street's come so far, and it would fetch twice the rent with some remodeling. But suppose it's beside the point now.\"\n\"Do you know what they plan to do with it?\" Crowley asks.\n\"Books,\" Lucius answers. \"Used.\"\n\"Interesting,\" Crowley hums.\n\"If you say so,\" Lucius shrugs. \"Ah look, seems the lorry will be out of your way after all. Here they come.\" Lucius nods down the street. Crowley can see pedestrians but not exactly who he's indicating. \n\"Oh,\" Crowley peers, \"do you know the name? Of the tenant I mean.\" \nHe hears Lucius step closer. \"Forget it actually. It's something absurd. Can ask him yourself in just a tick, see.\"\nHe does see; there are three of them, heading their way. They're all smiling, seemingly talking pleasantly. Two of them seem to be the movers, jeans, work-shirts, and the other...\n\n\u2014The bathroom was close, and cramped. The door didn't lock, but in his hazy drunken state it seemed good enough to simply push a foot against it and hope for the best. There was sloppy laughter, soft and clumsy, but he wasn't sure if it was his or not. A hand slipped through his, infuriatingly innocent. Crowley turned, shifting his body into the space between with heat and presence. There was a catch of breath, and before he even knew what he was thinking, he was kissing him\u2014\n\n\"Oh, fuck me.\" Crowley mumbles.\n\"Something wrong?\" Lucius's voice asks, miles away.\nCrowley doesn't hear hear him. He's too busy trying to convince himself that he doesn't recognize the frumpy pleasant-faced man stopping in front of the shop.\n\n\u2014His breath caught beautifully, mouth falling open easier than Crowley would have guessed was possible.\u2014\n\nThe man across the street covered in knit and tweed smiles kindly at his companions, fumbling with the keys in his unworked hands. He focuses on the lock, nudging his glasses further up his nose with a single knuckle. \n\n\u2014The glasses caught between them, but he didn't care, he was too busy slipping hands up into the vexing, gorgeous wave of his hair.\u2014\n\nThe man pushes a stray curl back in place and shoulders open the door, disappearing inside. The men follow him, and suddenly Crowley realizes Lucius has been speaking to him.\n\"Sorry?\" he just manages. His attention is still hazy, memories buzzing frantically around his mind. He tries to swat them away as quickly as they arrive. \n\"I know he's not exactly our kind of people, but he's not that bad is he?\" Lucius asks, eyeing Crowley's expression with concern.\n\"What? Oh! God no, no it's fine. I just thought... it's nothing. I'm sure he's fine.\"\nLucius still seems wary.\nCrowley swallows, loosening his posture to his usual attitude as well as he can manage. \"I'm just surprised\u2014I thought it was just a myth that used bookstore owners wore that much tweed.\"\nLucius laughs, light and clear. The tension eases away and he turns, stepping back towards the door. \"Still on for dinner? Tartaine?\"\n\"What?\" Crowley looks up sharply.\nLucius raises an eyebrow. \"Dinner? Tonight?\"\n\"Oh, yeah right. Yes, of course. Dinner. Still on, still good.\"\n\"Are you sure you're all right, Anthony.\" Lucius frowns.\nChrist, not the concerned first name usage... \"Yes, it's just I was up late,\" he pinches the bridge of his nose with mock focus, \"too many orders to complete for the weekend. Wedding season and all that.\"\n\"Well, we'll just have to make up for it tonight then,\" Lucius smiles. And lord, he really is bloody good looking, isn't he?\n\"We'll see.\" Crowley answers, smirking back, thin and charming.\n\"See you at eight,\" Lucius waves, and then he's gone. \nThe second he's out of sight Crowley's back at the window. He peers out through the flowers, trying to get a decent look. He could still be wrong, there's still a chance it isn't him. There are plenty of pudgy, be-speckled mildew enthusiasts who smile at the air like it's some kind of bloody gift. It could be someone else entirely. It's been ten years after all.\nHe squints, leaning out the open garage doors as far as he dares, but it's useless. The windows are filthily, all obscured with dust and grim, and the building's on the shadier side of the street. The movers come out again, once, twice, carrying boxes from their lorry back into the dusty interior, but there's no sign of the new proprietor.\n\"Did you see him?\" a voice asks suddenly.\nCrowley looks over. Anathema's standing just outside the window, arms crossed lightly in front of her chest, leaning on his wall.\n\"What?\" Crowley starts. \"Oh, no. Not yet.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" She frowns. \"I just saw him walking away. He didn't stop in?\"\n\"What? Who?\" Crowley blinks back at her.\nAnathema gives him a pitying look. \"Luscious Lucius, dear.\"\n\"Dear God, please please don't call him that,\" Crowley grimaces, falling back from the window. \"And just come inside, it's unsettling when you lurk out there. I feel like I'm working at a book-keeper\u2019s.\"\n\"Fine, fine,\" she turns around the corner, pushing open the shop door with a light jingle. \nCrowley turns away, heading for the lilacs with determination.\n\"What's got your knickers in a twist?\" Anathema asks, plopping down on the stool behind the counter with her usual vagrant familiarity.\n\"No knickers, no twisting,\" Crowley replies, picking up his shears and a few branches of pink flowers.\n\"He didn't come in, did he?\" \n\"He did, actually.\"\n\"Another date on the horizon?\" Anathema asks, pretty thick eyebrows lifting quizzically.\n\"Tonight. Dinner.\" He neatly clips the stems diagonally, trimming the lower branches so there's enough room in the vessels.\n\"What's that make, three now?\"\n\"Four.\" The flowers hang pendulous and languid in their containers, all weight and heady scent.\n\"Lucky number four?\" Anathema asks with a sharp smile.\n\"We'll see about that,\" Crowley answers. He props a few pink branches in the first vase, he's been using antique glass bottles lately, which the customers are enamored with. The flowers hang with just a touch too much sag. He plucks them out again and trims the stems shorter.\nAnathema's quiet for a moment. He can practically feel her narrow gaze evaluating him from behind the counter. He does his best to focus on his work.\n\"What's wrong with you?\" she asks finally.\n\"Plenty, if you don't stop asking,\" he snipes back.\nShe ignores him easily. \"Is it Lucius? Did he say something?\"\nCrowley sighs. She won't stop. If he's learnt anything about her by now, it's that. He sets the shears down on the table. \"No.\"\n\"What then?\"\nHe hesitates, but the truth is she might just be the closest thing he has to an actual friend. He'd been skeptical of her at first to say the least. He'd moved in and within three hours the leggy young woman who owned the shop next door had sauntered through the door, settling in as if she owned the place before even asking his name, attitude complete with earrings that looked as though they were designed to reflect star alignments, and hair that smelled of alternative medicine. But he'd realized very quickly that she was exceptionally clever, and cynically optimistic in just the right ways. She had a unapologetic perceptiveness to her character that was hard not to take a shine to. And for some reason, she seemed to like him back.\n\"Someone's leased the shop across the street,\" Crowley says.\n\"Oh, yes I know,\" her eyes widen, \"that bloody lorry's been there half the day. Mrs. Gustav bent my ear for thirty minutes over the damn thing. Have you met them? Are they wretched?\"\n\"I haven't met them,\" Crowley says warily. \"But I know them. Or rather, I know him.\"\nShe eyes him carefully. \"You still haven't answered the second question.\"\n\"He's not wretched. Rather the opposite actually,\" Crowley says. \"Or at least he wasn\u2019t when I knew him.\"\n\"When was this?\"\nCrowley sighs, running a hand through his thick hair. \"Ten years ago? More? It was at school, Oxford.\"\n\"Friend? Foe?\" She asks, leaning her sharp chin on her palm.\n\"Neither, really.\" His hands strip twigs from the lilacs idly. \"Just one of those people you saw around, you know? We were in different departments, shared a few friends, that sort of thing.\"\n\"Mmm, I can see why such a haunting presence would cause you distress,\" she teased.\nHe looks at her firmly. \"There may have been... an incident.\"\nShe looks back. \"... 'An incident'?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"Did you speak over him just loud enough in some Commonly Propagated Historical Fictions lectures? Beat him into Social Entitled Elitist Dinner Club?\"\nCrowley narrows his eyes at her. \"Do you want to know or not?\"\n\"I do know,\" she smiles back, \"you wouldn't be blushing like that unless you'd shagged the poor bastard.\"\nHis face heats up even more viciously. \"We didn't 'shag'. Well... not really I mean.\"\n\"You kissed him?\"\n\"Bit more than that,\" he admits.\n\"Snogged?\" she grins.\nCrowley's cheeks really do seem to be determined to be utter bastards. \"That's apt enough.\"\n\"Oh, well, what's the big deal?\" Anathema rolls her head to one side, long hair shifting over her back. \"I'm sure you did your fair share of snogging in college.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Crowley returns dryly.\n\"You're welcome, dear,\" she continues seamlessly. \"So, what's the big deal? It was ten years ago, right? What? Were you in love with him or something?\"\n\"No!\" Crowley says instantly. \"God, no. I just... I think it could be uncomfortable, that's all. Seeing him again. Working close quarters.\"\nAnathema smiles, raising one eyebrow. \"Oh so, you think he was in love with you?\"\n\"I didn't say that,\" Crowley says sharply. \"It can just be awkward that's all, running into people from your past. I tend to leave an impression.\"\n\"My God,\" Anathema grins, \"look at the bloody ego on you.\"\n\"It's not ego,\" Crowley says cleanly, \"it's just how things trend with me. It's not something I enjoy. I was almost assaulted in the produce aisle once when someone I ended up spending New Year\u2019s with in law-school reached for the same cantaloupe.\"\n\"What's he look like anyways? Besides misty-eyed with trysts of the past?\"\nCrowley shrugs, grabbing a few lilacs and easing them into an arrangement. \"Medium height, sturdy-build, terrible clothing.\"\n\"Curly hair almost that's a little too perfect?\"\nCrowley looks up. \"How'd you\u2014\"\n\"He's coming over here.\"\n\"What?\" Crowley scrambles around the table, peering out the windows. And indeed he's already crossing the street, with a polite half-hearted jog and a wave to the inconvenienced traffic. \n\"Should I prepare a bucket of ice water?\" Anathema grins.\n\"Fucking hell--\" Crowley looks frantically down at himself. He's wearing the bloody apron still but it's too late to take it off now. His tie's tucked neatly underneath, sleeves rolled up just past his elbows. He runs a hand through his hair hoping it isn't too disastrous, trying to ignore the way Anathema's grinning at him all the while.\nThe bell on the door jingles.\n\"Ah, hello,\" the voice calls, and god if he'd had any doubts before that's settled them. It's definitely him. No one else can sound that enamored with the universe and intelligently concerned over it at the same time. \n\"I do hope you'll excuse my intrusion, but I wanted to introduce myself.\" He gazes around the shop as he enters, a small smile easing onto his face as he takes in the flowers surrounding them on all sides.\n\"Of course,\" Anathema says, standing instantly. She holds out a hand. \"Pleasure to meet you, I'm Anathema.\"\n\"Aziraphale,\" he takes her offered hand warmly. \n\"That's quite the name,\" Anathema observes.\n\"I might say the same to you, dear. But I promise, I'm undeserving of mine's romanticism,\" he smiles. \"Is this your shop?\"\n\"Uh, no,\" Crowley clears his throat, keeping half behind the cutting table, making an uncomfortable attempt to lean on it casually. \"She's a squatter. It's my shop.\"\nThe man looks at him. Crowley swallows. His eyes shine exactly the same way they always have: kind and ferociously intelligent. Something shifts behind those eyes in confusion. He blinks once behind his round clear glasses.\n\"I see,\" Aziraphale says. \"And you are...?\"\nAnathema just manages to disguise her snort of laughter as an ugly cough.\nCrowley stares. \"... It's Crowley.\"\n\"Ah,\" Aziraphale's brows furrow slightly, \"last name or first name?\"\nHe's not sure wether to laugh or not. \"...Crowley. Anthony Crowley.\"\n\"Well, it's a pleasure,\" Aziraphale says extending a hand with a hesitant expression.\nCrowley ignores it. \"We've met before. Several times. Dozens even.\"\nAziraphale frowns. \"Oh goodness, I'm terribly sorry, but I don't think so.\"\nCrowley does laugh now, one short breath of disbelief. \"Well I do think so. Oxford -- class of 2001? You were theology; I was pre-law.\"\nThe man's brow wrinkles sadly. \"Well, now I'm sure I've been unforgivably forgetful. I hope do you'll excuse me.\"\nCrowley's still gaping. \"You honestly don't remember?\"\nAziraphale shrugs. \"As I said I'm terribly sorry. Unforgivable. Really.\"\n\"I was mates with Sasha Miller, Raji Patel,\" he gestures vaguely at his face, \"sunglasses all the time, drove that Bentley around campus.\"\n\"Something is ringing a bell,\" Aziraphale squints. \"The sunglasses sound familiar... not sure about the car. But look, I really am very sorry. The truth is if things aren't in text I'm like a sieve. It's terrible of me, truly.\"\n\"Oh no, it's not,\" Anathema smiles leaning against the counter. \"Books have far more colors for being so black and white. And he's very forgettable.\"\n\"I'm sure not,\" Aziraphale smiles kindly.\nApparently so, Crowley thinks, picking up the clippers from the cutting table a tad aggressively.\n\"It's a beautiful shop,\" Aziraphale tries to recover.\n\"Thank you,\" Crowley says without looking over. The darker purple lilacs make their way into three bottles in neat, quick succession.\n\"Mine's just next door,\" Anathema says. \"The Nine of Cups.\"\n\"Oh the, um, 'occult' shop just there?\" Aziraphale asks. Crowley can't help smiling. He does a wonderful job of trying to keep his voice kind but there's no hiding the skepticism.\n\"That's right,\" Anathema says, \"herbals and holistic healing. A few household spells as well, that sort of thing.\"\n\"That's very,\" the struggle's clear, \"...interesting.\"\n\"Isn't it just,\" Crowley returns, giving Anathema a look. She smirks back, utterly lacking any of the deserved self-consciousness for what in his opinion amounts to little better than snake-oil trading.\n\"Well, I should really make sure that those boxes are getting where they need to be. Some of the volumes are quite old I want to ensure they're being treated with due respect.\" Aziraphale says, \"but it's been a pleasure.\"\n\"It certainly has,\" Anathema says. \n\"See you,\" Aziraphale gives a small wave and turns, exiting the way he'd come.\n\"Not one word,\" Crowley grumbles as soon as he's gone.\n\"That's all right, I have several,\" Anathema says cheekily, \"including: pathetic, deluded, egotistical--\"\n\"All right, all right, that's enough of that.\"\n\"Seriously though, are you positive that's the same guy?\"\n\"Yes, I'm bloody positive.\" He glowers.\n\"He is cute, I have to admit.\"\n\"He looks like a potato in somebody\u2019s nan's jumper.\"\nAnathema grins. \"A cute potato.\"\n\"Potatoes have no sexual appeal,\" Crowley says sternly, brandishing the shears. \"Not even to each other. They self-fertilize.\"\n\"Of course they do,\" Anathema smiles, standing from behind the counter with a stretch and heading towards the door. \"You let me know if you end up self-fertilizing tonight won't you?\"\n\"Excuse me?\" Crowley starts.\nShe gives him a pitying expression. \"Tonight? Date? Luscious Lucius?\"\nCrowley huffs. \"Right of course, and why would I be telling you anything of the kind?\"\n\"Because, unfortunately for you, you've no one else to tell it to.\" She catches the door frame and turns back with a smile. \"I'll bring the booze.\"\nCrowley can't help smiling back. \"Sold.\"\n\u00a0\nLucius meets Crowley in front of the shop at eight. They take his dark green Porsche GT911 across town, leaving the roof down. The day cooled off exactly the right amount to be pleasant at dusk. The brightness of the day has burnt off into a luminescent cool evening, all indigos and pinks with the sun low on the horizon, hesitant to sink away completely. \nLucius compliments his Etro linen, a pale blue button-up with sharp lines and diagonally darted hems. Crowley returns the favor, noting his watch: Diesel, Black Gold.\nTheir dinner arrives on flat slates in dim lighting and soft music: hamachi folded with tuna, green apple wasabi, celery, and Maui-Meyer lemon spritzed across the top. \nLucius asks him about the lilacs, and he tells him they've been very happy with them. Crowley asks him about the flat closing in Hammersmith, and he tells him it continues to be troublesome. \nWhen dessert comes he feels a leg push against his under the table. He pushes back. \nLucius kisses as neatly as he shaves, urging Crowley back against the door of the apartment, opening him easily one press at a time. He's quick with the clothes, hands nimbly sliding under Crowley's belt, smoothly plucking the buttons open on his shirt, easing his coat off his shoulders.\nHe bounces onto an obscenely high thread count, all silk and easy under his bare skin. The hands find him again quick enough, clever and slow, easing out one groan at a time. Crowley comes with his face half sunk into the thick down of pillows and the sound of Lucius' gasps behind him. He bites down a curse against it, grinding his cock against the give of the mattress, dragging his climax out one pull at a time before finally falling still.\nLucius falls asleep quickly. \nCrowley doesn't. \nHe lays on his back, staring up at the skylight above them, one arm slung over his head. He waits for sleep to find him, but apparently he's hard to locate tonight. Up above the orange of the city glows against the dark of the sky. He tries to pick stars out of it. He knows it's impossible. He tries all the same, stretching his toes impatiently under the blankets.\n\"And you are?\" The clear eyes blink once behind round glasses.\nWith a sigh he rolls to his side. There are lilacs on the bedside table, the scent of them filling the room.\nIt only made sense, didn't it? He hadn't told him his name on that night. Why would he have? They hadn't known each other, not really, just familiar bodies that passed each other from time to time, and accidentally collided once when whiskey and youth pushed a little too hard.\nHe should be glad, if anything. From what he remembers he's a decent sort of fellow. In all likelihood he'll make a perfectly pleasant neighbor. \n\"--Unforgivable, really.\" He still smiles exactly the same way; as if he's more than intelligent enough to understand the world for exactly what it is and miraculously loves it all the same.\nHe doesn't remember. It's better that way. Best.\nCrowley rolls over, easing his body against Lucius' back and burying his nose in the short scratch of his hair. He smells of cotton and lily, and still just a bit like sex. Crowley shut his eyes.\nAll things considered, his current lot could be much worse.\nCrowley finds himself squinting in the sunlight, even through his sunglasses. He slips his hand into his pocket, fumbling for keys. It's not that he's hung-over, certainly not, he'd only had two glasses of Pimm's after all, and a gin and tonic to finish. Maybe it was just that liquor always seemed to hit him more precisely than wine or anything else that didn't jam twice as much gusto into half the volume. This morning was especially groggy, he felt as if there were little builders inside his head putting up layer upon layer of ugly wallpaper.\nHe gets the key into the lock with only a slight slip. The lock is rotated in the opposite direction of where it should be. He stares at it for a moment and then hesitantly tries the handle. It's open. Visions of shattered vases and ravaged orchids flood across his mind as he hurriedly shoves open the door.\n\"Morning!\" Anathema smiles pleasantly from behind the counter.\n\"Christ!\" Crowley swears. Everything is perfectly as it should be inside, except for the intruder in a long purple cotton dress that fits just right on her hips with a chain necklace of crystals and feathers swinging against her sternum. Her dark hair's tucked neatly behind one ear, the other side cascading over her shoulder.\n\"How was your evening?\" she asks.\nCrowley scowls, shutting the door behind him. \"I should call the police.\"\n\"Even when I come bearing caffeine?\" she asks, sliding a very tempting latte towards him over the counter. He takes it with a scolding look.\n\"Hot milk and breaking-and-entering are not strictly equatable.\"\n\"It's your fault anyways,\" she says. \"I've told you the lock needs replacing. It hardly took me a minute. Then again, you could always just give me your spare key, then I could come and go as I please. Wouldn't that be lovely?\"\n\"Right. Lovely. Exactly the word I'd use,\" Crowley says dryly.\n\"You should give someone your spare,\" she counters, \"even if it's not me for some enigmatic reason. What if you lost your key?\"\n\"I won't lose my key,\" Crowley says firmly.\nAnathema tilts her head, evaluating him as he takes a good long sip of the still-steaming latte in his long fingers.\n\"Have an interesting evening?\" she asks, a grin tempting at the corners of her pretty unpainted lips. \n\"Not especially,\" he returns.\n\"Liar,\" the grin invades her cheeks brazenly, \"you're twenty minutes later than usual. Not to mention the state of your hair.\"\nOne of his hands moves to it instantly. \"What's wrong with my hair?\"\nShe can't help laughing. \"Nothing.\"\n\"Don't lie to me, Anathema,\" Crowley says sternly.\n\"Nothing!\" she affirms, meeting his eyes firmly. \"I think it looks better a little less fawned over anyways, it's more natural.\"\nCrowley sighs, running a concerned hand through it all the same and adjusting his sunglasses. \"I was in a bit of a rush this morning, didn't get home until late.\"\n\"How late?\" she asks.\n\"Early,\" he answers, taking another deep sip. \n\"I knew it.\" The grin gains full territory.\n\"It's creepy when you smile like that you know,\" Crowley notes. \"You look like some haunted ventriloquist's dummy.\"\n\"So?\" she asks, ignoring him.\n\"So what?\" he feigns.\n\"You know exactly what, cheeky,\" she insists. \"How was it?\"\nCrowley slides onto the wooden stool behind the cutting table, crossing his legs neatly. He takes one more slow sip of his latte, letting the milky strength of it swirl around his tongue pleasantly. \n\"Good,\" he answers. \n\"Vivid,\" Anathema counters.\n\"I'm not here to sate your need for erotic narrative,\" Crowley says.\n\"Narrative isn't necessary,\" Anathema says. \"I'll settle for slightly more creative adjective selection.\"\nCrowley's quiet for a moment. The sunlight is just starting to slant through the glass of the garage-doors that front the shop. It's catching on the circular hanging vases for the succulents towards the front, the shine of Anathema's jewelry, his own brightly polished shoes as he taps his toe lightly up and down.\n\"Athletic,\" he starts, tone considering, \"precise, tidy...\"\nAnathema lets out a snort. \"Tidy! Seriously? Bloody hell...\"\n\"I like tidy,\" Crowley says, raising the paper mug to his lips again. \"In case you hadn't noticed.\"\n\"You're a liar,\" Anathema smiles, eyes shining sharp and devious. \n\"What makes you say that?\" Crowley asks. \"I'm very tidy.\"\n\"That's exactly what makes me say that,\" Anathema says. \"Trust me, I understand these things. Anyone who keeps their clothes as pressed and neat as yours is secretly hoping that someone will show up to muss them around.\"\nCrowley smiles at her thinly. \"That's an interesting theory.\"\n\"Of course it is,\" she teases, \"I'm very interesting.\"\nHe can't help letting out a light laugh. He stands up at the stool, arching his back into a stretch. Anathema watches his long, lithe body twist appreciatively. She often does. He doesn't mind. He can't really blame her can he? And after all, there's no question it's a strictly aesthetic appreciation.\n\"I should probably open up next-door,\" she sighs, standing herself, \"get these biddies their packaged placebos.\"\nCrowley waves to her as she moves to the door. \"Enjoy.\"\nShe steps out onto the street and then stops, turning back around the still open door with fingers curled against the frame. \"Hey.\"\nHe looks up. \"What?\"\n\"I know it irritated you, but you were a bit rude yesterday,\" she says.\nCrowley frowns. \"What? When?\"\n\"With the potato,\" Anathema says, \"you know,\" she gestures with her head across the street behind her.\nCrowley follows the gesture. The shop's windows are dark, although little less dusty than yesterday. \"Oh.\"\n\"Just thought I'd let you know,\" she says, \"you miss those things sometimes.\"\nCrowley glances back at her. \"Was I too rude?\"\n\"Yeah, a bit, rather,\" she answers.\n\"It's not my fault,\" he tries. \"Who doesn't remember college acquaintances?\"\nAnathema levels a look at him. \"Me. You. Everyone.\"\nCrowley sighs. \"I was just surprised, that's all.\"\n\"Look,\" Anathema continues, leaning heavier against the door-frame, \"you said it was a drunk snog. How drunk? He probably didn't remember it the next day, let alone ten years later.\"\n\"Right,\" Crowley admits hesitantly. \"You're probably right.\"\n\"Could you repeat that?\" Anathema asks. \"I need a new text-alert for you.\"\nHe scowls at her. \"You've made your point.\"\n\"Yes, I have,\" she smiles easily, turning back out the door. \"Let's all be neighborly, shall we?\" The door swings shut behind her, bell jingling lightly.\nSilence presses close as soon as she's gone. Crowley leans against the cutting table for a moment, sipping his latte. Finally, he pushes off it, walking across the floor to look out the glass of the door. The shop is darkened across the street, but then he's not sure how light it would look even with lights on. It's a shadowy, forgotten place. It looks like something that you might emerge from after walking through some mysterious door in a country hillside. He evaluates it, trying to notice any differences. The windows are clean of dust now he can see, and the front has been swept and tidied. Up above the shop there are three windows, one of which is slightly ajar. He realizes he's never seen them open before. Is it an apartment? Did the shop come with it, all one package: living space and a store-front? It wouldn't be unheard of by any means. \nHe had been rude hadn't he? It wasn't his fault he didn't remember. Did he even want him to remember? He wonders what the shop looks like behind the comfortable worn visage he sees each day, especially after a bit of care from a respectful tenant. Maybe a gift? Some welcome-to-this-strip-of-pavement-we-share thing? That's the thing neighbors do, isn't it? Worth a shot at least.\nIt's just past lunch by the time he makes it across the street. The day ended up clouding over after all, or at least in bits and pieces. Heavy white billows that look as though they've dragged themselves right out of a Vermeer pull across the sky overhead, rolling against the warm blue between them.\nCrowley pauses just outside the shop, the unfamiliar sidewalk under his shined shoes. Strange. He's been across the street for almost a year now but he's never actually walked over here. His own apartment was just around the corner on his side, half a block at the most, and, funnily enough, there has just never been cause to step to this side.\nHe peers at the gloomy visage of the shop, adjusting the plant he has in one hand. One of the advantages of his new job: shopping for gifts had become impossibly simple. \nThere wasn't an OPEN sign on the door, or a closed sign for that matter. One or two of the windows were cracked to let in some air, but not ajar.\nMaybe this wasn't the most brilliant idea. He's just moved after all, that's always a stressful experience. In all likelihood the place is still only boxes and mess. Any visitors would likely just cause embarrassment. He looks down at the orchid under his arm. The open face stares back at him accusingly.\n\"Fine, fine,\" he mutters, stepping up to the door neatly. He runs his hand through his hair and adjusts his tie, pressing it back into place under his blazer.\nCrowley gives the door a firm knock. The door swings open silently under the pressure of his knuckles. He gazes after it in surprise, peering at what he can see of the interior. Hesitantly, he takes a step inside.\n\"Hullo?\" His voice doesn't travel very far.\nThe store is filled with books. Literally. \nOf course every bookstore, by the laws of the stern mistress of definition, should be filled with books. But that wasn't really the case was it? At least not always. Bookstores, the better attended ones at least, were arranged with books more than anything else. They were taken by their handlers and placed neatly into zones for optimal browsing as one might with any other good, stories caged up and displayed prettily, like finches in some well-paid art-director's spanning flat, or some tidy garden that belonged to a very precise elderly woman who took her tea with only the thinnest slice of lemon.\nThis place is not a tidy garden, or a neat set of caged finches. It's a jungle, grown from black and white and leather bindings. Books tower, they weave, they fill the space around him. Of course Crowley has been in used bookstores before. He enjoys books. They have an audacity he adores: snatching the world, twisting it about, and trapping it between pages. But this, it looks like every used bookshop he's ever been lost in had gotten together some sweltering sticky summer night and rolled around together until this mutation emerged.\nHe's almost afraid to move any further inside, lest a stray biography snaps at his ankles or an anthology sweeps down from the rafters to snatch at his hair. If he were to wander down into the surrounding turns and curves of the towering shelves maybe he would end up ambling for days, years, turning corners of a labyrinth laced with the smell of words. He might not even notice the time slip by at all.\n\"Hullo?\" he repeats. The books muffle him, eating up his words hungrily, likely recycling them as some means of reproduction.\nMaybe their tender's not here after all. Shouldn't leave his door unlocked if he's out... Was anyone really that trusting? He wonders.\nCrowley glances down at the nearest stack looming at him. It's snuggled up with it's litter on the table beside the door, rising to just below his chest. He lets his hand drift out, lightly stroking the cover of the nearest. It looks like a nineteen-thirties edition, bound not with leather, but that woven material that most older hardcovers have. \nA Room With a View by E.M. Forester traces out in thin, worn gold type under the line of his finger. Crowley smiles.\n\"Hullo?\" a voice calls. Steps sound suddenly towards the back of the shop. Crowley's hand falls back to his side. Stairs. He can hear someone hurrying down them at a jolly pace.\n\"Hullo,\" Crowley answers, hopefully helpfully.\nThe stairs end, he can hear that much, there's a few more shuffling steps, and Aziraphale's face appears from behind one of the groves of shelves. \n\"Ah! Good morning,\" he smiles pleasantly, emerging from the chaos of it all with the look of some chipper explorer from colonist-propaganda children's stories. Crowley can almost see the pith helmet.\nAziraphale has four books under one arm. He sets them down gingerly on a table Crowley is starting to suspect is supposed to be the main counter thanks to the presence of a hulking ancient cash register.\n\"How are you?\" Aziraphale asks, turning to face him properly.\nCrowley stares back at him through the expensive tint of his sunglasses. God, he really hasn't changed. Maybe a touch heavier, but it's hardly noticeable. \n\"Not bad,\" Crowley answers, taking a bit longer with his answer than he probably should have. He steps deeper into the shop a few paces, feeling the books peer at him curiously all the while. \"I wanted to apologize for yesterday.\"\n\"Oh dear, please don't. It's my fault completely. You have every right to be irritated by someone so disgracefully forgetful,\" Aziraphale protests.\n\"I believe I was rude,\" Crowley continues. \u201cThere's few excuses for rudeness, and even fewer where people you haven't known long enough to find irritating are concerned.\"\n\"Ah, but we have known each other long enough for that, haven't we?\" Aziraphale asks. He's wearing a white button-up under a maroon sweater. The sleeves are pushed half-way up his forearms, likely from the moving he's still completing.\nAziraphale smiles at him. \"Here\u2014\" he turns, rummaging for something that seems to be hiding between the books behind him. He bends over to forge deeper and Crowley looks away instantly, cheeks flushing slightly as he stares firmly at a stack of very interesting looking volumes and not anywhere else.\n\"There\u2014\" Aziraphale says, righting himself again. Crowley lets himself look back. He's holding something between thick fingers, it looks like a photograph. \n\"I thought about it yesterday, after popping over. I think I do remember, bits and pieces at least,\" Aziraphale says, gazing at the photo. \"I think you had class in the same building right after I had Qur'an Theology second levels, senior year. I would sit out on the lawn with Katie Miller on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and she would always stare at you dreamily when you went past us and say something rather lewd about your sunglasses.\"\nCrowley can't help laughing. \"I don't recall.\"\n\"Roger Braun and Stephanie Jardin sat with us sometimes, and you'd stop for a moment and speak to them. I'd see you at Roger's sometimes? I think I stopped over for one of two holiday parties when he gave me enough trouble over attending.\"\n\"That sounds about right,\" Crowley answers, hoping it's not too obvious that it sounds exactly right, because he remembers it with all the glaring clarity of someone shouting the memories into his ear with a megaphone.\n\"There, see, I'm not utterly hopeless,\" Aziraphale smiles at him. Radiance is filtering in through the crowded books in the window, bouncing light up around his face and off the rounded glasses. With the sincere kindness of his expression and the bloody perfection of that hair, he almost seems to glow. Strange. The sun must have come out after all. \n\"Here, see,\" Aziraphale turns the photo towards him. Crowley leans forward enough to peer into it, letting his sunglasses slip down his nose enough to see above them.\nIt's a black and white photo, which is vexingly pretentious since it was only taken eleven years ago. But it's well shot, despite that. He can see Katie Miller's clever smile sitting beside Roger's broad shoulders on the lawn in front of Radcliffe. Aziraphale's to their right, just looking over his shoulder towards the camera as if he wasn't expecting the photograph. He's wearing an outfit almost identical to the one he's currently sporting except for the colors. Stephanie Jardin's standing behind the rest, off to the left. She seems to be telling a story with a low voice and mischievous eyes to a dark figure. He's taller than her by five inches easily, dark clothing, slim fitting, a cigarette neatly between his lips. Sunglasses. Maybe he hasn't changed all that much either.\n\"Huh,\" Crowley notes.\n\"I'm glad I found it,\" Aziraphale smiles, turning the picture back to himself. \"I don't have many from school.\"\n\"Mobile-phone technology really put a dent in that sort of thing,\" Crowley says.\n\"Shameful,\" Aziraphale says. His thumb traces lightly over the photograph before placing it carefully back on the desk behind him. \"What's that?\" he looks at the orchid.\n\"Oh!\" Crowley remembers the thing all at once. He glances at the desk but there isn't an obvious free space to place it, so he simply holds it out stupidly. \"For you.\"\n\"Oh my,\" Aziraphale murmurs, hesitating to take it but eyeing it appreciatively all the same, \"there's really no need.\"\n\"I insist,\" Crowley says, \"welcome, and all that.\"\nAziraphale smiles, taking it carefully with an indulgent smile. \"Well, if you insist.\"\nHe turns it over in his hand, giving it a good look.\n\"I just brought it from across the street of course,\" Crowley starts, \"it's\u2014\u201d\n\"A Beallara,\" Aziraphale says for him, eyes still on it. \"It's a hybrid cross between Odontoglossum and Cochlioda, isn't it?\nCrowley can't help being surprised. \"Exactly. Do you keep orchids?\"\n\"Not regularly, but I have done. I've read about them on occasion,\" Aziraphale says. He nudges a stack of volumes carefully to one side, setting the orchid down. \"Thank you.\"\n\"My pleasure,\" Crowley says instantly.\n\"I'll have to keep her upstairs though, there really isn't the proper light down here.\"\n\"Oh,\" Crowley begins innocently, \"is there more space above?\"\n\"Just an apartment,\" Aziraphale answers. \"More than enough room for me.\"\n\"Handy,\" Crowley notes.\n\"Mm, very,\" he agrees.\nOne of Aziraphale's fingers lightly traces the curl of a petal as he gazes down at it. Crowley looks away.\n\"So,\" Aziraphale says, pulling his attention from the flower and slipping his hands into his pockets, \"you were in law, is that right? At school? But now you run a flower shop? Interesting.\"\n\"You were going to be a priest, if I remember correctly,\" Crowley returns with a sharp smile, \"but I don't see a collar.\"\nAziraphale laughs. \"Ah, no, it didn't quite take. What about you?\"\nCrowley shrugs. \"Didn't quite take.\"\n\"Right,\" Aziraphale's smile tilts clever on the edges. \"Funny how that happens.\"\n\"Yes,\" Crowley agrees, \"certainly is.\" \n\"Well, what do you think?\" Aziraphale asks, gesturing around them.\n\"What do you mean?\" Crowley asks.\n\"Of the shop?\"\nCrowley stares. \"You're moved in? I mean... this, is moved in?\"\n\"Oh dear,\" Aziraphale frowns. \"Is it not apparent?\"\n\"No!\" Crowley tries to recover. \"No, no, I like it. It's very... sincere.\" \nAziraphale looks up at him with intrigued smiling eyes. \"Do you really think so?\"\n\"Yes,\" Crowley says, and he actually means it. He's not sure anyone else will enjoy it in the same manner, but that's not what he's been asked.\n\"Ah, good, thank you,\" Aziraphale says. He turns, stepping behind the desk and arranging a few volumes. Something catches Crowley's eye, a tall pale shape peering out between books.\n\"Is that Chateau d'Yquem? White Bordeaux? 2011?\" he asks instantly, unable to stop himself.\n\"What?\" Aziraphale says looking up. \"Oh!\" he looks back down, \"yes, it is. Do you know it?\"\nCrowley can't help laughing. \"I've been trying to find a bottle for two months. Any vintage.\"\n\"Ah well, have this one,\" Aziraphale says. He lifts it up, holding it out.\nCrowley stares. \"Oh no, I couldn't...\" But he wants to. Badly.\n\"Of course you can, dear boy,\" Aziraphale smiles, nudging the thing into his hands. \n\"Don't you want it?\" Crowley asks, fingers betraying his words to close around it greedily. \n\"I have a case upstairs,\" Aziraphale says with a shrug. \"It\u2019s not a rarity, and 2011 isn\u2019t an extravagance. It's really no trouble. And it's lovely for summer.\"\nCrowley cradles it under his arm. \"Well, in that case I'm more than happy to relieve you of it.\"\n\"And I'm happy to be relieved,\" Aziraphale smiles back.\n\"I'll let you get back to...this,\" Crowley says gesturing to the inky jungle around them.\n\"Oh,\" Aziraphale sounds slightly disappointed, \"well, feel free to stop back anytime.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Crowley says, turning back for the door. He steps out, turning back, \"enjoy the Beallara.\"\nAziraphale waves, clever eyes already inside an unfolded volume on the desk. \"Enjoy the Bordeaux.\"\nCrowley smiles and steps back out onto the street. He jogs across, back to his side, unlocking quickly and leaving the door open behind him. He sets the wine down on the counter carefully, taking a moment to eye it appreciatively. \nHe slips a hand into his pocket and pulls out his phone. It only takes a moment to dial.\n\"Hullo?\" the voice on the other side answers.\n\"What are you doing tonight?\" Crowley asks.\nLucius voice smiles. \"Nothing interesting.\"\n\"Come over?\"\n\"Of course,\" Lucius answers. \"Do you want to go out?\"\n\"I'd rather stay in,\" Crowley says. \"I can cook something.\"\n\"Lovely,\" Lucius says. \"Should I bring anything?\"\n\"No need, I've got a bottle of white Bordeaux here I'd love to pair.\"\nLucius' voice teases through the phone. \"Lord, Anthony, haven't you heard? No one's drinking white this summer.\"\nWhat in God's green and snail-infested earth had ever possessed him to agree to a wedding? \nHe'd sworn when he started the store that he would never do nuptials. They were terrifying business. The clients were either brimming with acidic anxiety or searching for any flaw on which to vent fury from all lingering regrets and fears. And then there was the whole greatest day of your life business, which ridiculously wheedled him into the habit of wasting far too much time nitpicking the arrangements.\nHe's turned away two dozen wedding requests in the past month, especially after the feature he received in April's House &amp; Garden. But then, some mad woman who wouldn't take no for an answer had barged in demanding that he do her arrangements; unfortunately he'd always found Anathema particularly difficult to refuse. Anathema's wedding to a most absurdly common-place IT fellow wasn't for another three weeks, but he didn't want to go into it completely unprepared. \nSo, when a woman in her early twenties with a soft expression and a gentle last-minute request had come in two weeks ago, he'd agreed. Idiot that he is. \nAnd of course, it had to be baby's breath. \nThe girl, Clarice, said that it was her favorite, that her mother had always put bunches in her room when she was a little girl. There was no avoiding it, and now mountains of the stuff is piled up on the cutting table. Few people realize that once you get enough baby's breath in a condensed space the scent of cat urine pours out of the damn stuff. He's assembled a makeshift breathing mask from his linen pocket-square, but it makes little difference. What's most terrifying is that he'll likely adjust to the smell soon enough, adopting it himself and bringing it with him everywhere he goes for the next three days.\nBloody Anathema. What right did she have to suddenly become a normal human being who wants beautifully arranged flowers at her wedding? Since when do women who sell celtic fertility pendants even get married, anyways? He imagines it\u2019ll probably be held in some field where no one will be wearing shoes, and he'll have to drive the Bentley down a hellish dirt track to get there, then wade through half a marsh in his Armani to reach the ceremony. She'll likely end up looking so beautiful, and so happy that he'll forgive her all of it, which really just makes the entire thing worse.\n\"Bloody bastards,\" he mutters down to the flowers. They stare dumbly back at him as if they don't know exactly what they're doing. Anathema is not getting baby's breath when her time comes, not unless she sits in here with him and endures their putrid presence while he cuts and assembles every single damn arrangement. She certainly wasn't there now; she\u2019d been off on some wedding errand for a few days, probably inspecting the Scottish bog they'll all have to clamber through, or making sure it's substantially obstructed by boulders and sheep shit. \nCrowley sighs. He has twenty arrangements left. Then the bridesmaids\u2019 hand bouquets. He's already been at it since 8AM, stopping for just an hour to open the shop. It's almost noon already. There's a gentle ring at the door\n\"Am I interrupting?\" Lucius asks, peering inside. \n\"Yes,\" Crowley answers, \"and if you stop it, I won't forgive you.\"\nLucius grins, easing the rest of the way into the shop. He's looking especially sharp due to that face that he's been showing that four-million flat off of the river today. He's sporting a grey suit, rolled once about the ankles, slim fitting. There's a broadly painted floral pattern shirt underneath, Crowley recognizes from Dolce and Gabbana's most recent spring line. He chosen a navy tie to lie against it, and a pocket-square to match. Shit. Crowley snatches his own pocket-square off his face and tucks it quickly back in his jacket.\n\"I thought I'd bring lunch,\" Lucius says, setting a neat paper-bag down on the counter. \"I know you've been busy.\"\n\"Very thoughtful.\"\n\"I don't know about very. Moderately, maybe.\"\nCrowley steps away from the table, shaking out his hands and eyeing the paper bag hungrily.\n\"My Lord, that stuff is putrid!\" Lucius glares at the baby's breath. \"Why on earth do you have it in here?\"\n\"It's that bloody wedding I agreed to,\" Crowley says.\n\"Well, that's nothing to regret, you should do more weddings. It's such a profit margin,\" Lucius notes. \"But you shouldn't agree to these things, terrible working conditions and all that.\"\nCrowley's fairly sure he's in no way justified in describing his medium-to-high-income shop job as terrible working conditions. \"It's not that bad.\" He can practically feel the flowers grinning snidely at him from the table.\n\"It is that bad!\" Lucius insists. \"Honestly, you should have told her no. It's likely driving off some customers, losing you business.\"\n\"They were her mother's favorite,\" Crowley hears himself saying. \n\"God,\" Lucius sighs. \u201cSometimes I think society is utterly infected with sentimentality.\" \nCrowley pulls the paper bag into his hands, intent on ending the conversation before that remark sinks in too deeply. It sounds like something he might have said four years ago, across the bargaining table from opposing counsel, with a corporate eight-figure client at his side. Something he would have said, and felt fiercely in that treacherous spot behind his ribs, that he didn't believe it for one instant.\n\"What do we have?\" he asks, trying to distract himself by opening the bag and peering inside.\n\"There's a new sandwich shop two blocks up,\" Lucius says as Crowley pulls out the smooth white rectangles wrapped in paper, all and neatly taped shut. \"They're doing Moroccan today, so yours is lamb curry.\"\n\"Sounds bloody perfect,\" Crowley sighs, sliding onto the stool behind the counter. He puts his hands to the paper, eager to unfold. \nA noise bursts out on the street. No, several. Loud ones.\nThere's a screech, vicious enough to turn both of their heads. It lasts a second, maybe two. It's followed instantly by another sound. This one far more organic, and far more wretched. Crowley's standing before he can think, hurrying around the counter towards the door. He tugs it open with one tight pull and rushes out onto the street. There's a red car trying its best to rush down and out of their street. Trying, and only half succeeding given the tightness of their road. \nThere's a woman standing near his front door, one hand pressed over her chest. \"Awful, just awful\u2014\"\nThere's a cat in the road. It's twisted in a way it shouldn't be. It's grey, round. One white ear. Half its fur has gone dark and wet. \nCrowley\u2019s across the street in less than a second. But even so, someone beats him to it. \n\"Oh goodness,\" Aziraphale mutters, kneeling down.\nCrowley comes to a stop, panting. \"Is it...?\"\nAziraphale squints down at the twisted creature. \"It's breathing.\"\nIt is. He can see that now. It's mouth is partly open, body rising and falling with fast panic. One of its legs looks mangled. There's blood, but it's face, its body, all seems intact at least.\n\"What's happened?\" Lucius's voice asks behind him.\nCrowley turns instantly. \"Give me your coat.\"\nLucius frowns. \"What for?\"\n\"To wrap it up,\" Crowley hurries, \"we can take it somewhere.\"\nLucius frowns at the injured cat. \"I'm allergic.\"\nCrowley stares at him for just a moment before hurrying to undo his apron.\n\"It's all right,\" Aziraphale says. Crowley notices he's gotten his olive jumper off already and is easing the cat from the cobbles within it.\nThe poor thing groans and hisses wretchedly, but Aziraphale hushes it gently holding it close to his chest.\n\"Careful,\" Crowley can't help muttering.\nThere's a honking sound half way down the block. The car is still trying to get away.\nCrowley's eyes narrow. \n\"Do you have it?\" he asks Aziraphale hurriedly.\n\"Yes,\" Aziraphale answers, \"I'll run her to the vet up the block. See what can be done.\" He's holding the cat firmly, the olive of his jumper already darkening with blood. Aziraphale presses tighter, frowning down with concern. \"I'm going now.\"\n\"Good.\" Crowley turns, rushing back across the street. He knocks his sunglasses out of his hair and down onto his nose with a quick tap. His Bentley's parked out front, just where it always is, where he can keep a firm and close eye on it at all times.\nHe slides into the leather and instantly has the engine roaring to life. The Bentley tears off of the curb, rushing after the car just as the sleek red shape it makes it onto the main road. \nThe traffic is tight on their street, a few people have even stopped their cars to peer out and see what's caused the fuss, only making matters worse. Best not to bother. The red car went right, so Crowley swings the wheel early, sweeping the Bentley around a corner and urging it along the winding back street. The main street reveals itself around the next corner and his quarry shoots past just as he reaches it. Crowley nimbly spins the wheel, kicking out the back a foot of two as he skids after it. He has a brief flashing image of his mechanic lunging at him with a spanner in his hand and murder in his eyes, but he pushes that thought aside.\nHe's hardly two cars behind in now. He can see the enemy zigging and zagging through the groaning London traffic up ahead. It's an expensive car, and practically screaming the fact. BMW M5, red. He's always had a particular hatred for red cars. \nThe BMW takes a sharp corner, so sharp Crowley almost misses it, but he just manages the turn, only now they've gained three cars on him. He closes the distances as quickly and sharply as he can only to watch the red blur snap around another corner, and another all too quickly after. \nThe chase lasts half an hour before finally it's one corner too many. He's halfway across the city on the other side of the river, in some posh neighborhood he's not familiar with, when he turns to only see an empty street staring back at him. His pulse is still racing, breathe still quick in his chest. But there's nothing. \nHe slams his hand on the wheel with a quick swear. It's his fault for not driving like that for so long, and now what's he have to show for it? An injured cat that's in all likelihood lying dead on some veterinarian's table right now, and no one to hold responsible. He bitterly thinks of Vonnegut quotes and turns the Bentley back the way he came.\nBy the time he rolls back onto their street, the sun's hanging pendulously over the buildings of London\u2019s West End. He'd gone farther than he'd realized, and, despite the straighter course back, it had been almost an hour-long trip back with the thicker traffic at the day's end. And the time he spent circling the three block radius half a dozen times trying to catch sight of the enemy vehicle hadn't helped either. \nLucius's car is gone. It looks like he's locked the shop up for him at least. Crowley's grateful. He hadn't thought about that at all when he ran off on this useless chase.\nHe parks the Bentley neatly in his obscenely expensive space out in front of the shop, uncurling his legs and stepping out onto the cobblestones. He takes a look around the street. It seems any chaos the event had caused has been dissipated for sometime. The street seems exactly the same as it was just a day before. The same, except for the dark splotch of blood still sunk into the cobbles where the cat had been. Crowley wrinkles his nose. He'll have to get his hose extension and take care of that soon.\nHe glances at his shop behind him. Through the window he can see the bloody baby's breath waiting exactly where he\u2019d left it. The arrangement still looks lively enough after a handful of hours out. There's so many left to do. He gazes through the window a moment longer and then turns and cross the street.\nAziraphale's door is locked. Crowley cups his hands and presses against a window, peering in through the ancient glass. It seems all gloom inside, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's closed. He gives a polite knock. Nothing. He gives a less polite knock. Still nothing. He takes two steps backwards, turning his head up towards the second-floor windows. They seem dark as well. He can just see the edge of an orchid peering down from one age-fogged pane of glass. \n\"Hullo!\" he calls up. \"Aziraphale?\"\nNothing.\nCrowley sighs, looking about for a moment, considering. He pulls his sliver of a phone free from his pocket, nimbly working the touch screen with elegant fingers. The nearest vet isn't far. Four blocks or so. He remembers it now. That must be where he went with it.\nCrowley turns east and heads towards the blinking marker on the screen.\nIt doesn't take him long to get there. He pushes open the door to get a face full of that distinctive smell all veterinarians' offices seem to have: dog hair, antiseptic, and the perfume of cat ladies. The waiting room isn't crowded. There's a young boy sitting with a turtle held tenderly in his lap, a young couple with a German Shepherd sits opposite, and a middle-aged woman with a carrying case the contents of which remain a mysterious. And then there's Aziraphale, sitting closer to the desk, with what looks like a bloody gossip magazine unfolded neatly in his lap.\nCrowley heads towards him. \"Diagnosis?\"\nAziraphale looks up, startled. \"Oh, hullo.\"\n\"How's the cat?\" Crowley repeats, standing stiffly in front of of him.\n\"Alive, poor thing,\" Aziraphale answers with a sigh. He leans back in his seat for a small stretch. \"She's in surgery, has been for a little while now. They took her in right away. Said they'd do their best.\"\nCrowley gazes towards the hidden interior of the place. \"How much longer till you know.\"\nAziraphale shrugs. \"An hour? Less?\"\nCrowley nods. He thinks of the baby's breath With a sigh he sits in the glaring indigo seat beside Aziraphale.\n\"You don't have to wait,\" Aziraphale tries.\n\"I want to wait,\" Crowley answers quickly. He narrows his eyes at some wretched painting of kittens in a basket adorning the wall across from him.\nAziraphale doesn't look over but Crowley thinks he might be smiling. \"How was your chase? Successful?\"\n\"He escaped,\" Crowley grumbles. \n\"Well,\" Aziraphale shrugs, \"so it goes.\"\nCrowley can't help staring at him for a moment. \"That's what I... I mean, yes, I suppose it does.\"\nThey're quiet for a few seconds. They boy to their right tries to feed his tortoise some lettuce from his pocket.\n\"Although,\" Aziraphale says, \"sometimes, I wish it wouldn't go quite so disgracefully.\"\nCrowley's mouth quirks upwards on the left side. \"Seconded.\"\nAziraphale flips a glossy page in his magazine, tutting quietly with his tongue. \"Goodness, why can't they leave these poor women alone?\"\n\"What's that?\" Crowley asks, glancing over.\nAziraphale's finger taps the page neatly. \"Moss finds a simple ponytail enough for her market run. And why shouldn't she? These \u2018journalists\u2019 are disgraceful.\"\nCrowley snorts. \"I wonder what the fucks who cash in those snapshots look like when they trundle off to the market.\"\nAziraphale laughs. It's a nice sound. Polite and quiet but honest and easy. Same as it always was.\n\"Why are you reading it anyways?\" Crowley asks, leaning closer to evaluate the brash text plastered over glossy pictures.\n\"I have absolutely no idea,\" Aziraphale answers. He nods in the direction of the woman with the carrier. \"She nabbed Time. Although, honestly, I'm not sure the contents are superior to this masterpiece.\"\n\"Doubtful.\"\nAziraphale glances at him before closing the magazine. \"Your young man had to leave. He locked the shop up for you.\"\n\"I saw,\" Crowley says. A smile slinks onto his face. \"My young man? I think he's a year or two older than you are.\"\nAziraphale smiles sharper than Crowley would have expected. \"Fine. Your old man, then.\" \nCrowley laughs. \"That's quite good, maybe I'll start using that.\"\n\"I don't think he'd appreciate it,\" Aziraphale says.\n\"Likely not.\"\nHe realizes Aziraphale's still missing some apparel, wearing his simple button-up shirt without an over layer. \n\"How's your jumper?\" Crowley asks.\n\"Oh, ruined I'm sure.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" Crowley tries, \"I have a magician of a dry-cleaner, I could\u2014\"\nAziraphale shrugs. \"Don't bother. It's only a jumper.\"\nCrowley gazes back at him. \"Yes, I suppose so.\"\nAziraphale's hand is resting on the armrest now that the magazine is shut. Crowley stares at it. He imagines reaching down, slipping his long fingers easily around it and rubbing a thumb along his.\n\"How was the wine?\" Aziraphale asks.\nCrowley looks away quickly. \"What? Oh, good.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cVery good. Thank you again.\"\n\"It's my pleasure,\" Aziraphale says easily. \u201cAny time, dear boy.\"\nHe still talks like a seventy-year-old nodding to young people in the park, Crowley notes. Back in school there had always been several keen impersonations of his unique tenor floating around parties.\nA young woman in scrubs suddenly emerges from one of the swinging doors behind the desk. Aziraphale looks up to her instantly standing. Crowley follows his lead. \nShe steps up to them neatly. \"She's stable now, and resting. It seems that she's going to make it after all.\"\nAziraphale lets out a breath Crowley hadn't realized he'd been holding.\n\"Does she belong to you two?\" the young woman asks, eyeing them curiously.\n\"No,\" Crowley says rather too quickly. \"I mean, she was hit by a car on our street.\"\n\"And you brought her in? That was very kind,\" the woman smiles.\nCrowley feels his stomach twist slightly. He's not sure he's too pleased with the idea of living in a world where that's considered exceptional kindness. \n\"Do you know who she belongs to?\" the woman asks. \"If she belongs to anyone?\"\n\"No, I'm afraid we don't,\" Aziraphale's forehead wrinkles in concern. Crowley can practically see him playing scenarios behind those glasses: some young child sitting at their window looking for their kitty, laying out milk and it's favorite toys, waiting for it to come home again.\n\"Well, not to be indelicate,\" the woman struggles, \"but we will need someone to pay for the procedure.\"\n\"Don't worry about that,\" Crowley says instantly. \"It will be taken care of.\"\n\"Thank you,\u201d the woman smiles. \u201cThe only remaining concern is where she will go if you don't know her owners. She's going to require some care and attention for at least a few weeks in order to make a full recovery. Someone will have to keep an eye on her stitches, she won't be able to move much, so feeding will require some time and care. There are antibiotics that I would like to give you as well, to prevent infection and help her heal.\"\n\"She can come with me,\" Aziraphale says before Crowley gets a chance to answer. \"I work from home, or just about. I can easily keep an eye on the poor thing. We can post adverts and try and find the owners while she recovers.\"\nThe woman nods. \"Most cats in hit and runs aren't so fortunate. She's a very lucky girl; it seems she has guardian angels looking out for her.\"\nOr at least halfway decent human beings, Crowley can't help thinking.\n\"I'm sure whomever she belongs to will be incredibly grateful, if you manage to find them.\"\n\"We'll certainly do our best,\" Aziraphale smiles gently. \n\"She'll be ready soon, there will be some care instructions we can go over and schedule some check-up visits,\" the woman says, turning back to the doors.\n\"Understood,\" Crowley answers.\nIt's past dinner-time when they finally get back to their shops. Crowley had run back and gotten the Bentley in order to bring her to Aziraphale's without jostling her too much by the walking. They'd gotten halfway back only to remember neither of them had anything at all to properly provide for even a healthy cat, so they'd diverted to a pet-shop and purchased a few necessities. Aziraphale had spent almost fifteen minutes learning about the benefits of the organic food selections. Crowley had strolled along the line of bird cages, frowning at the budgies behind his sunglasses as they cheeped and fluffed on their perches. And then, finally, they'd made their way home.\nIn the evening light of the street, Aziraphale carefully lifts the cat's carrier out of the car. Crowley follows him inside, carrying one bag of medicine from the vet and another from the pet-shop, a kitty bed under one arm. He just manages to lock the car behind him. \nThey make their way into the paper jungle. Aziraphale switches on the lights, sending the whole place into a low golden glow. He's speaking to the cat all the while, soft absurd things, telling it about the shop and other nonsense that Crowley can't help smiling over. Finally, he follows him up the stairs to the apartment above.\nIt's a simple flat, just as he'd said it was. There's three windows facing the street in the living space, a tiny kitchen attached with old heavy appliances and a refrigerator that seems to be from the before the advent of color television. The floors are wooden and creak under their feet, welcoming them with worn deep voices. There's a half ajar door to the left which Crowley guesses leads to a bedroom. The place is furnished simply. Tidy. Bookcases line the walls and volumes cover the tables. There's a simple round table by one of the windows. The orchid is in the middle, a few open volumes to keep it company with a mug alongside. Aziraphale sets the carrier down on an empty space by the books and opens the squeaking metal door, muttering his soft comforting voice all the while.\nCrowley drops the cat bed down on the floor near his feet and places the bags beside the table. Aziraphale eases the cat out of the carrier. It groans unhappily, and he clicks his tongue, with soft poor dears and goodness graciouses and other ridiculous nothings, before settling it down on the bed.\nIt's stoned enough on whatever the vet had given it to collapse readily into the circle of stuffing and fabric, letting its head slump down as its yellow eyes slip drunkenly shut.\n\"There now,\" Aziraphale says, straightening his back at looking down at it. \"Should be all right?\"\n\"I'd think so,\" Crowley affirms. \n\"I'm sorry to have put you to so much trouble,\" Aziraphale says, looking down at the bags. \"I could have managed it alone.\"\n\"I want to be put to the trouble,\" Crowley says firmly. \"And if you need anything else you'd better not hesitate to ask for it.\"\nAziraphale smiles. \"If you insist.\"\n\"I do,\" Crowley says firmly.\nThey both watch the cat as she drifts into unconsciousness. The ear that's white on the tip has a few stitches. There's more along her side, about a quarter of her fur shaved to make room for the operation. The vet had told them exactly what had happened, but he hadn't listened that carefully. As long as he knew how to take care of it, that was all that mattered, wasn't it? And listening to the list of damages had only made him think of that red car speeding away without a care in the world. \n\"I don't remember you being quite so soft-hearted at school,\" Aziraphale notes.\n\"I'm not soft-hearted,\" Crowley frowns. \"I'm very hard-hearted. Steel plated ventricles, that's me.\"\n\"Of course, so sorry.\u201d Aziraphale's still smiling. \"Should we take a picture? For posting signs?\"\n\"Right,\" Crowley had forgotten. He fishes his phone out of his pocket and kneels down, carefully framing the cat. \"There.\" He stands again. He thinks briefly it\u2019s a rather haunting picture. What if it were his lost cat and he saw its picture, complete with unconsciousness and stitches up the side? Well, all considered, he\u2019d likely still be grateful above all else.\n\"I really shouldn't keep you any longer, you've lost a whole day of work already for this,\" Aziraphale says.\nCrowley doesn't answer. The cat's breathing is strangely calming to watch, the soft grey fur rising and falling in an easy rhythm.\n\"You should come visit, sometime,\" Aziraphale says. \"Any time, really.\"\nCrowley looks over to him.\n\"If you'd like,\" Aziraphale qualifies. \"You can check in on her at any time. I'm glad to offer you some wine. I'd be happy to have you. I don't know if you realize this, but you're rather good company.\"\nCrowley smiles. \"Rather good?\"\n\"Well, not bad,\" Aziraphale smiles back.\nCrowley glances down at the cat. \"Good. I mean, I'd like that.\"\n\"Good,\" Aziraphale returns.\n\"Well. See you, then,\" Crowley heads back for the door with a wave. \nAziraphale stays where he is, watching the cat curled gently into the bed at his feet. \"See you.\"\nCrowley steps onto the stairs and wiggles his phone out of his pocket. There's three missed texts.\n\nLucius - 12:34\nHad to run. Locked up the shop. Your neighbor took the cat.\n\n\nLucius - 17:13\nDinner plans?\n\n\nLucius - 19:10\nI'm sure you're still out. Going with a friend. Catch you tomorrow.\n\nCrowley stares down at the phone, the blue light illuminating his face in the dark of the stairs. He slips it back into his pocket and turns back the way he came. \"Any time?\" he asks.\nAziraphale looks up. \"What? Oh yes, any.\"\nCrowley glances at him over his sunglasses. \"How about now?\"\nAziraphale smiles.\nThe sky still seems to be intent on punishing them for some global sin, sprawled out above the city all grey looming weight, spitting rain in a manner that varies every half an hour or so from a dribble to a downpour. But Crowley doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s been so long since it properly rained. And this is one of his favorite ways to spend wet, gloomy-looking mornings.\nThe halls of the Tate spread out around them, footsteps of all the patrons echoing vast in the wide space. Up above, the sound plays amongst the criss-crossed steel beams and glass that forms the ceiling for the main body of the museum: a sprawling foyer, which leads to almost every exhibit. Crowley glances up at the ceiling, peering above his sunglasses. The sound of the rain on the glass pours into the museum, making everything feel cushioned and somehow closer than it would on another day.\nA tour filled with eager faces bustles past them, its guide leading the way towards temporary exhibits.\nLucius slips his hands into the pockets of his Marc Jacobs slacks. \"They should ban them.\"\n\"Ban what?\" Crowley asks.\n\"Museum tours,\" Lucius smirks, nodding after the gaggle that's now turning to the left with wavering coordination. \"Can you imagine, actually choosing to participate in something like that? Paying to participate in something like that?\"\n\"No, I can't,\" Crowley says honestly. They do look utterly absurd, the woman at the front with her little plastic flower, all the tourists\u2019 feet shuffling quickly behind.\n\"Imagine seeing everything in a place like this through someone else's eyes, through someone else's words,\" Lucius continues. \"It's almost perverse. Such things should be left to sink into individuals on their own terms. Imagine if Warhol had known people would be guiding others through his work. He'd have thought it utterly farcical.\"\n\"I'm sure he would have.\" Crowley had never cared for Warhol. But he suspects that in addition to some mock-offense at the absurd nature of museum tours, Warhol\u2019s ego might inflate to ten times its normal size at the idea. \nThat\u2019s one of the reasons he can never truly enjoy Dada, or at least some Dada of the Duchamp variety. He finds it quite clever, and the part of himself that presents as a cynic who\u2019s sunglass-shrouded vision sees all the shaded parts of the world finds such a playful critique extremely laudable. But another part of himself, the part that stays up late watching \u201980s-to-\u201990s sitcoms about saucy old ladies, the part that chases red BMWs for hours for hitting one cat (when cats die every day in this city by the hundreds), that part of himself can\u2019t help but feel sad looking at such work. \nFor truth was, at its heart, something composed of spite, something designed to take the piss out of something else, someone else. And while some of its victims maybe deserve to be knocked about a bit, is art as a whole really deserving of such vindictiveness? \nCreating art, truly creating art, takes courage. Not creating in the way Warhol did, with society sunk into everything, leaving the impact as valuable as the execution, but creating in the way that a lonely man, who can just afford paints, walks out into a field and tries to understand the world does. Such endeavors do not deserve mockery.\n\"Let's not follow them,\" Lucius says. \"At least those people with the damn headphones don't let their tainted perspectives infiltrate anyone else's.\"\n\"Are your perspectives so easily infiltrated?\" Crowley hears himself ask.\n\"I'd just rather not bother with it,\" Lucius says. He turns to him. \"Why? Do you want to follow the tour?\"\n\"No,\" Crowley answers, \"no, let's not. Let's just look at something. We've been here far too long without looking at something.\"\nThey turn into one of the exhibits. Crowley looks over his shoulder as he leaves the main foyer. The tour is still making their way into the opposite hallway. They do look ridiculous, all jammed together, shuffling feet, craning necks. But they look rather happy as well. Quite happy, even.\nAs soon as they approach the exhibit\u2019s works Crowley slips his sunglasses off and secures them in the pocket of his blazer. His lips twitch into a small smile. It's one of his favorite exhibits. The permanent Turner collection, largest in the world.\n\"Lunch after this?\"\n\"What's that?\" Crowley turns.\n\"Lunch, after? We'll be what, half an hour more or so here? I have another tour through the four-mil flat on the river. I think this buyer's serious. If we pop out in half and hour I'll have time for some lunch before the showing.\"\nThe four-mil-flat-on-the-river had become a regular party in their conversations. He can't say he completely blames him; a ten percent commission on four million is a juicy opportunity. And people have jobs, responsibilities, schedules. There's no faulting anyone for that. But sometimes he wishes it was just the-flat-on-the-river with the four-mil prefix, and that it reared its head a little less often during their time together.\n\"Sure, lunch is good,\" Crowley answers.\n\"Half an hour?\" Lucius asks, handsome eyes locking with his.\nCrowley shrugs. \"All right, half an hour.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Lucius squeezes his hand quickly before letting it go. They turn back to the gallery. \"Honestly, I prefer art on a schedule anyways. Galleries, museums. I feel as though I can pace myself better with a schedule.\"\nCrowley hums quietly, focusing on the nearest Turner. He doesn't have much to say back to that. He's not sure whether it would be an admission or not to explain how he loses all track of time in museums, how he once wandered the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay for five hours without realizing it. But it doesn't matter. \nThere's all manner of people in the world, some like schedules, and some get lost in places like this, as if wandering some unknown slice of countryside. He can't help it; everything about museums acts like some strange trance-inducing drug on him. The space, the stillness, the quiet, and then the stories have all that much more room to leak in, slipping out the edges of their frames. There's the stories of the works themselves, the worlds and characters they unwind and lay out before the viewer, and then there's the stories of the artists, the ages, the periods, all mingling together into a tiered and faceted tale unique to each and every work. There was a labyrinth of stories inside every painting and he couldn't help wandering around the corners, and sometimes misplacing the ball of yarn he needed to escape once again. They stop in front of one particular work.\n\"The Dogano, San Giorgio, Citella, from the Steps of Europa,\" Lucius reads aloud. \"Rather literal.\u201d\nCrowley can't help turning to him. \"Pardon?\"\n\"Oh, nothing. Just a long name, is all.\"\n\"That's what it is. The name is what it is,\" Crowley says simply.\n\"Right, exactly.\"\nThey both turn back considering it in silence.\n\"It's rather between worlds, isn't it?\" Lucius says after a moment.\nCrowley glances at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Well, it's neither here, nor there.\" Lucius tilts his head slightly, considering the work. \"It lacks the craft of the classic, and just touches the brazenness of the modern.\"\nCrowley watches him for a moment before turning back to the painting. \"I think it's quite brazen.\"\n\"Oh, of course, for the time,\" Lucius continues. \"It just makes you realize.\"\n\"Realize what?\"\n\"How much further the world, art as a whole, still had to come to reach true insight, true genius. You can still feel the pressures of conformity tugging at this one's corners.\"\nCrowley focuses on the painting, on the sweeping, fearless strokes. He thinks of Turner, with his easel propped up on those steps, peering through the humidity of the day, watching as the light turned from gold to clear to gold all over again. Trying to see, just to see, and capture something he must have known would forever elude him. But he stood on the steps all the same, with the sun on his face, and the voices of the city around him.\n\"What do you think?\" Lucius asks.\n\"I like it,\" Crowley answers, \"very much.\"\n\u00a0\nThe rain's lost some of its gusto by the time he pulls up to the the curb in front of the shop. He considers the umbrella but decides against it, stepping out with it in hand rather than opened. It's still warm outside, which doesn't make the weather as much of a bother as it might be otherwise. Truth be told, he's happy for a true rainy day, rather than just the damp and drizzle and grey that\u2019s been haunting them. Rainy days are wonderful in their own way. There's a real sense of cleansing about them, and it will be good for his gardens out in the countryside.\nHe glances across the street as he heads for his shop. There's a young man by Aziraphale\u2019s. Quite young. Twenty-two? Twenty-four at the oldest, certainly. \nCrowley suspects it's the same young man he's seen two times already this week, even though he's only glimpsed him before. He takes his chance and gets a good look now as the lad considers the shop door, presumably wondering, like anyone else who passes by, whether it's open or not. \nHe's attractive. Taller. A sort of sun-kissed color to the short brown hair. Even a few freckles. He has that sort of strong jawed, peering-eyed, innocent-meets-masculine air that Crowley's always imagined belonging to young aristocrats in 1910 before the Great War chewed them up and swallowed.\nThe boy takes his phone from his pocket, tapping on it quickly. He glances over at Crowley, and hell, maybe he's been staring. The lad gives half a wave. Crowley's about to return it when the door opens from the inside. He can't see Aziraphale but he must be welcoming his guest because the lad smiles in a shy but immensely happy way, passing a few unheard words with the figure inside, before slipping into the darkened interior. The door shuts behind them.\nCrowley turns away, heading for his keys and the shop door. Absurd, really; he shouldn't be thinking of him as such a boy. What was twenty-four? He wasn't that much older than that, was he? Nine years isn't that much. Christ, he needs to stop that. Did he want to be twenty-four again? Not a chance in hell.\nHe gets the door open and leans his umbrella beside the door, hanging his coat on its hook by the front as he ties on his apron. The orchids will need the first pass of the day, then he'll check on the window arrangements and replace the ones that need it. The damned baby's breath has finally been purged, although he felt as though the smell was hanging around for days afterwards. The clothes he'd worn those dreadful days are still at the cleaners. \nHe pauses suddenly. Something doesn't feel quite right. He turns back towards the counter. Something's certainly off, but what? He takes a tentative step closer.\n\"SURPRISE!\"\nHe doesn't scream. Certainly not a scream. It's a very contained, very masculine yelp.\n\"Bloody hell, Anathema!\" he swears.\nShe's in near hysterics where she\u2019s popped up from behind the counter, leaning on it with a gleeful expression, one foot kicking up in the air behind her.\n\"How old are you? Seven? Seven and a half?\" Crowley shouts.\n\"How old are you? Eighty-nine? You actually put a hand to your chest like some scandalized Victorian, or a neglig\u00e9e-clad silent movie starlet who's seen a dastardly dandy creeping round her room.\"\n\"I don't think dandies can be dastardly. And you should be careful! I might have attacked you.\" He picks up his shears and holds them in what he hopes is a menacing way to prove his point.\nAnathema raised both eyebrows. \"Attack me! You still look like you need a fainting couch!\"\n\"Well, it's very shocking! Dangerous.\"\n\"Fun,\" she grins.\n\"Not that. Opposite of that.\"\n\"Not happy to see me?\" she asks.\n\"Horrified to see you is more accurate,\" he says. He takes a step closer, putting his own hands on the opposite side of the counter. \"How was your bloody trip?\"\n\"Hardly a trip,\" she argues. \u201cJust looking at a location.\"\n\"All of this is really disgustingly last-minute, you know.\"\n\"It will come together,\" she says.\n\"Famous last words.\"\n\"It will,\" she insists calmly, \"for me.\" And the terrible part was she's completely right. Everything seemed to come together for her; it was like the universe, time, fate, any of that, was affected by her gravity, easing into her orbit and turning according to her whims and effortless designs.\n\"How's Newt?\"\n\"Nervous. He shares your lack of faith in the alignment of things.\"\n\"Shares a sense of reality,\" Crowley corrects.\n\"Well he needn't, and you needn't, everything will come together,\" she repeats, commanding the spin of existence to obey her wishes.\n\"Miss me?\" she asks, pretty clever smile filling her face from the eyes first. \n\"I was enjoying some peace and quiet.\"\n\"There wasn't much of that I heard.\"\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\"What did you hear?\"\nShe leans back, smile slipping into a frown. \"Some dreadful business with a poor cat and disgusting humans.\"\n\"Hey there, not everyone was disgusting.\"\n\"No,\" her eyes sparkle, grin returning. \"I heard you were like, and I quote, James Bond.\"\nCrowley tries not to smile. \"Is that right?\"\n\"I'm sorry I missed it, honestly,\" she continues. \"It all sounds as though it was very exciting. Running out onto the street, traffic stopping, chaos, screams. You rushing after the villain, a thrilling car-chase, all Hollywood, complete with the suit and pretentious sunglasses.\"\nCrowley hardly even hears her snark. \"Who told you all of this?\"\n\"Potato,\" she answers. \"It was quite the exciting recounting.\"\nCrowley raises a dark brow. \"Pardon?\"\n\"It's your nick-name, not mine,\" Anathema insists, tossing up her hands.\n\"Oh, yes, right,\" Crowley remembers. \"Well, I was still feeling a little irritated back then. Did he really say James Bond?\"\nAnathema smirks. \"I assume we're on better terms with the neighbors now?\"\n\"I wish you wouldn't ask questions you know the answers to. You get a very snide expression.\"\n\"I know my answers,\" she insists, \"but I don't know yours.\"\n\"Then yes, all right. Better terms.\"\n\"Good terms?\"\n\"Maybe even those.\"\n\"He said you've been going over there to check on the cat. How often are you doing that?\"\nCrowley picks up his spritzer, keen on ignoring her tenor. \"I don't see how it's any of your business.\"\n\"Defensive much?\" she laughs.\nHe turns to the orchids, lightly spraying them. \"Nosy much?\"\n\"Just curious,\" she shrugs.\n\"Well, what if I do go over most nights? Is it that terrible for me to be friendly?\"\n\"Terrible, no. Bizarre, yes.\"\nSpraying down the orchids almost makes them look as though they are outside, just past the glass behind them, enjoying the bath with the rest of the city. \"It's not bizarre. I'm very charming.\"\n\"Charming is completely different from friendly. You're charming with everyone; you're friendly with no one. Charming is all surface; friendly's sincere. Hell, I came in here half a dozen times before you warmed up to me.\"\n\"I still haven't warmed up to you. You're a pest.\"\n\"And this is my point,\" she returns, gesturing to him.\n\"What's wrong with me being friendly?\" Crowley insists, crossing to the other side of the shop. \"You like him. Don't you?\"\n\"Very much,\" Anathema admits freely.\n\"So why can't I?\"\n\"Why can't you what?\"\n\"Like him very\u2014\u201d He catches himself just in time. \"Why can't I be friendly?\"\n\"You can,\" she shrugs, \"I haven't said you can't. I just said I'm surprised, is all. You were so irritated with him. I wasn't sure your pride could take being friendly.\u201d\nThe sad truth is, she isn't terribly wrong. He still does feel hurt in ways. He knows it\u2019s dramatic, and absurd, but there\u2019s a part of him that hates not being remembered. He\u2019s prideful. There\u2019s no use denying it. It\u2019s a pretty decent sin to call your own,considering the other options. And thanks to it, there\u2019s a small, but wheedling sense of injury within that he can't quite silence.\nIsn't he worth remembering? Isn't it worth remembering? He himself certainly seems to think so\u2026\n\"He's pleasant and clever,\" Crowley says, \"and you were away. What did you expect?\"\n\"Oh, have I been replaced?\" Anathema mocks affront.\n\"Maybe you have. You just watch it, I have options now.\u201d\nHe turns back to give the displays in the front window his attention, and suddenly, stops dead as his heart jumps two feet up into his throat. He lets out a small whining noise of discomfort, stepping quickly backwards. He slips behind the cutting table, keeping his eyes firmly on the front displays.\n\"What the hell's wrong with you?\" Anathema asks, staring in surprise at his wide eyes.\n\"There's one of them in here,\" he hisses, eyes still locked on the front display.\n\"One of what? Oh God, Anthony, this really is the stupidest thing!\"\n\"It is not stupid!\" he whispers through his teeth. \"Do you call people who are afraid of spiders stupid? Snakes?\"\n\"Those are poisonous!\" she insists.\n\"Only a few! And no one calls anyone stupid for being afraid of those that aren't.\"\n\"You can't be serious,\" Anathema steps around the counter looking towards the oh-so-terrifying display with mirth on her lips.\n\"It's not funny! It's just...get it. Can you get it? Please. Get it out.\"\n\"You get it!\" she laughs.\n\"No! I don't want its bloody spindly hooked legs anywhere near me, or the flapping, or that wretched face.\"\n\u201cCrowley! It's just a butterfly!\" she exclaims.\n\"It's an intruder,\u201d he corrects. \u201cAnd I don't want it here. It must have come in with you. They know better than to get near me. You get it out.\"\n\"Maybe you should just swat it.\"\n\"I don't want to swat it! It might panic, get in my face, or my...\"\n\"You were going to say hair weren't you?\"\n\"Please,\" he glares at her, \"please, just get it out.\"\n\"Maybe I should just kill it,\" she shrugs.\n\"Don\u2019t,\u201d he says too quickly.\n\"You're that disturbed by it, but you don't want me to kill it?\" she teases. Bloody girl.\n\"No, I don't want you to fucking kill it,\u201d he snarls.\n\"Softie,\" she grins.\n\"I just don't want the family seeking vengeance, just please, get it\u2014oh God!\" The thing has taken flight. He ducks down instantly, hiding behind the table. \"Get it, get it, get it, get it\u2014\"\nAnathema can't seem to stop laughing. He can hear her scooting around the cement of the floor, hopping up after it. \"God, it really likes it in here. Maybe you should keep it.\"\n\"Very funny. Do you have it?\"\n\"Almost\u2014\" she makes a stretching sound and then stops. \"All right. Got it.\"\n\"Put it outside.\"\n\"I sort of know what you mean,\" she says, not moving. \"The feet do feel a bit creepy, and that's not a very nice face. Still better than spiders though.\"\n\"Outside. Now. Please.\"\nShe finally steps across the floor. He hears the door open, pause, and then shut again.\n\"You\u2019re safe,\" she says, \"the villain has been banished.\u201d\n\"You promise?\"\n\"Yes!\" she laughs.\n\"You're not still holding it? You're not going to hurl it at my face when I stand up?\"\n\"No! God, just stand up, you look like a complete idiot!\"\nHe does, carefully. She appears to be honest in her assertions, leaning on the counter again, hands rested there, not cupped around a little winged demon in front of her.\nHe clears his throat, wiping off the knees of his pants. \"Well, fine. Good.\"\nShe's staring at him like he's grown a second, far more amusing, head. \"You're a wonder. You know that, don't you?\"\n\"Yes, I do, thank you very much.\"\nAnathema sighs, turning towards the door. \"Thrilling as this is, I should be opening up. I won't get many business days this month.\"\n\"Right, sure,\" Crowley says, returning to open the register. He stops suddenly, looking up. \"Wait, what do you mean?\"\n\"Well,\" she stops halfway out the open door, tossing her hair over one shoulder, \u201cwhat with the wedding and all of that. It's ridiculous, really. You want to keep it as simple as possible, but simple takes its own time, and I do want it to be fun for everyone so there's that as well. It's time consuming. Even in its most unadulterated form.\"\n\"You're going away again?\" Crowley asks.\n\"There,\" she smiles, \"I knew you missed me.\"\n\"When are you leaving?\" he continues, ignoring her.\n\"I'm here for a few more days, two, three? Then I'll be off up North for most of the time until the wedding. I'll be back again for a night sometime right before the Event.\"\n\"What for?\"\n\"Getting too drunk and singing too loudly.\"\nCrowley stares. \"You're not doing a bloody hen night?\"\n\"Hopefully it won't be a bloody hen night. I wouldn't want any injuries. And you're coming, by the way, so best start warming up to the concept. Don't worry, it won't be a screaming clich\u00e9. Just three women who can hold far too much whiskey without vomiting, and you trying to avoid sticky pub seats.\u201d\n\"Excellent.\" \n\"Yes, I think so,\" she waves, stepping outside finally. \"See you.\"\nThe door swings shut behind her. Perfect. It's not as though a day or so before her wedding he should be arranging the flowers she demanded from him, or anything of the sort. Although he is curious to see what her other friends might be like. Curious or terrified. Maybe a bit of both.\nIt takes him less than an half an hour to open up. The new bouquets and arrangements slot nicely into the windows, and the orchids glitter in the early light, little orbs of moisture from the sprayer glowing like gems. It's still early by the time he's done with morning chores. Before noon. He rarely gets anyone before noon. After lunch people will pop by for some arrangements, but towards the end of the day is always when he's busiest. Last-minute remembered anniversaries. Dates that need artillery. The craving for a spark of beauty to take home after a long work day.\nCrowley leans on the counter, gazing idly out towards the street. He should balance some accounts while he's unoccupied, issue some invoices, adjust the receivables, but he can't quite seem to move towards those ends just yet.\nAcross the street, a door opens. It's Aziraphale's. Crowley focuses. The young mans steps out. \nHe isn't carrying anything. There's no books under his arm, no gripped paper bag hiding purchases. Interesting. Maybe he was just browsing. For an hour.\nCrowley frowns at him as he moves down the street, apparently not bothered by the rain. Eventually he's out of sight. Crowley turns his attention back to Aziraphale\u2019s door, eyes narrowed. He glances at the register, then the bare cutting table, then the street. Well. Who goes out to buy flowers in the rain at 11AM anyways? He's around the counter quickly, tossing his apron on a hook and grabbing his jacket on the way. The door swings shut behind him, swaying sign turned to CLOSED.\nAziraphale's door pushes open easily. The rain's picked up, and he hasn't taken his umbrella. There's a speckling of raindrops on the shoulders of his jacket and his hair's just a touch damp. He hustles into the bookshop with the same rushed air and bustled concern that most demonstrate when coming indoors out of the rain. The warmth of the place and the smell of books rises up on all sides. The lights are on, sending the whole interior into a warm, dim, golden glow.\n\"Oh, hullo,\" Aziraphale's voice calls. \nCrowley turns, glancing for him. \"Hullo?\u201d\nHe emerges from behind an over-burdened shelf, glasses low on his nose, one volume still open in his hands. \"Still raining?\"\n\"Still raining,\" Crowley affirms, \"but its conviction has been rather erratic.\"\n\"Mmm,\" Aziraphale hums, eyes glancing over the volume before he shuts it. It's a pleasant sound. That hum. Calming. Strangely it reminds him of the sound of others moving about a house when as a child you tried to sleep. You\u2019d hear your mother just next door, continuing her day, the world moving calmly on, lulling you into a peaceful state of unconsciousness. He finds himself imagining lying out on the absurdly plaid sofa just upstairs, slipping into sleep on kitschy throw pillows with the noise of Aziraphale humming and moving about between the rustling of pages just down stairs. \nCrowley distracts himself from the lulling mental image, looking about. \"Oh,\" he takes a step closer to the counter. \"You brought her downstairs.\"\n\"What?\" Aziraphale glances back over. \"Oh, yes, it felt silly to leave her upstairs. And it's easier to give her attention when she's down here.\"\nCrowley stands beside the cat, looking down. She looks back at him, eyes far less glazed than they had been only a few days ago. He lets his hand drift over, and she nods her head into it as if she's doing him the favor. He smiles. \"She seems better.\"\n\"Mm, much,\" Aziraphale agrees, stepping over himself and placing the volume on the counter. \"She's eating much easier, and you can see she's more lucid.\"\n\"Is she moving around much?\"\n\"A little, but it's not safe just yet. It's good for her to rest.\"\n\"Of course.\" Crowley crooks a finger behind her ear and she she starts to purr. \"Busy day?\" he asks, focus still on the cat.\n\"Not at all, only Justin.\"\nCrowley focuses harder on the cat. \"Right.\"\nAziraphale leans on the counter. He reaches his hand out and joins in, gently running a knuckle down her spine. Slowly. Again. And again. \nCrowley can't help watching it, even though the rhythmic motion is making him feel dangerously relaxed. With the golden warmth, the closeness of the books, he can feel his eyelids drifting down slightly, settling into a lazy, comfortable weight. \n\"I posted adverts, for her,\" Aziraphale says, leaning his chin on his free hand.\n\"Do you think anything will come of it?\"\n\"I don't know. If she's someone\u2019s, I certainly hope so.\"\n\"What if she's not?\" Crowley asks.\n\"Well, she's not such a bother.\u201d Aziraphale smiles.\nThere's a pause. Even within the forest of literature it's still easy to hear the rain drip-dropping to the sidewalk and the gutters outside. \n\"I should get back,\" Crowley says, not moving.\n\"Ah, right,\" Aziraphale rights himself, and that brings Crowley back. He drops his hand back to his side.\n\"Are you coming back? Tonight, I mean...to check in?\" Aziraphale asks. \"I have a decent Zinfandel I'd like to try.\"\nCrowley eases back. \"Can't. Dinner plans.\"\n\u201cOh, well. Enjoy,\" Aziraphale smiles, open and kind.\n\"I will,\" Crowley steps away. \"See you. Make sure she takes those antibiotics. I think she might be spitting them out. She has a suspicious air.\"\n\"I make sure,\" Aziraphale comforts, then, \"Oh!\" he calls, suddenly remembering. \"I didn't know Anathema was getting married, the dear thing.\u201d\n\"Oh, right, yes. Soon.\" Crowley turns back.\n\"Have you met her young man?\"\n\"Yes,\" Crowley sighs.\nAziraphale frowns. \"Is he deserving?\"\nCrowley laughs. \"No one's that deserving.\"\n\"What does he do?\"\n\u201cHe\u2019s in IT.\u201d\nAziraphale gazes off. \"That doesn't seem right...\"\n\"I think that's part of the appeal,\" Crowley returns. \u201cNot right. Right off.\u201d\n\"She invited me,\" Aziraphale says. \u201cTo the wedding, I mean.\"\n\"Did she?\" He can't help feeling surprised.\n\"It's rather extraordinary. You've both been so kind. Hardly anyone could expect so much from neighbors.\"\n\"Will you go?\"\n\"What?\" he looks up.\n\"To the wedding?\" \nAziraphale smiles. \"Yes. Yes, I think so.\"\nCrowley smiles back. \"Good.\"\nBy the time he steps back onto the street, the rain's picked up even more weight. He hurries across, shutting the door behind him, trying not to wonder if only Justin will also be making it to Anathema's hillside ceremony.\nBed, really is an excellent place to be. Come to think of it, why does anyone ever leave bed at all? Especially on mornings like this.\nCrowley hasn\u2019t summoned the energy to move just yet, even though Lucius rolled over with a contented grumbly sigh a few minutes ago.\nCrowley\u2019s always particularly enjoyed these moments. Post-coital, still awake and aware, just choosing to be less so. There\u2019s a paradoxically comfortable soreness lingering, giving him subtle silent permission to loll against the high-thread count and simply marinate in all those messy post-orgasm chemicals sloshing around his brain.\nAlthough he\u2019d be loathe to admit it, there\u2019s something so deliciously indulgent to these moments that he can\u2019t help but fantasize. He thinks of French mistresses stretched out settees, sighing beneath undone corsets and reaching with finely manicured hands to pluck petit-fours from silver trays. He thinks of Egyptian princesses, loose and all unfolded by pleasure, stretching back on silk covered couches to purr against the smell of their own sun-kissed skin. There\u2019s something he relates to vividly in those images during these moments, more than he\u2019d ever confess to. But sometimes, it just feels so lovely, to lean back with an indulgent sense of lethargy, like some form of sexual royalty.\nLucius rolls back over, kissing him open and soft against the side of his neck, edging his nose just under his ear, before turning back again with more purpose. He sits up, standing to walk across the room to where he left his trousers the night before.\nCrowley rolls, leaning on one elbow to watch him. It\u2019s a pleasant picture. Lucius\u2019s fit, but not in that obnoxious way where abs look like they might start a conversation with you. Just right. He\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s how Men\u2019s Health would describe it. The musculature is there, defined but not boasting, just enough to accentuate all the lines of his body, and maybe a little more so in the arms. A very pleasant picture\u00a0\nHe lets himself gaze at his lower-half as Lucius tugs up his Calvin Klein\u2019s and Marc Jacob\u2019s after them, covering one of the more favorable portions of the view. He starts to do up his belt, looking out at the city through Crowley\u2019s expansive windows. The sun is catching in his dirtied-blond hair, the shadow of stubble on his cheeks looking almost casual.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to the country today,\u201d Crowley hears himself say.\nLucius turns. \u201cIs that right?\"\u00a0\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Crowley hums, stretching back again into the eager arms of the pillows. He stretches one leg off to the side, letting his foot and the calf behind it slip out into the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to check the gardens. I keep some out there so I can stock from them. It\u2019s pretty. I want to see what\u2019s looking best for Anathema\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnathema\u2019s what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWedding,\u201d Crowley says, suddenly look back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? It\u2019s less than two weeks off now, almost a week even.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lucius acknowledges, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot, there\u2019s just been quite a lot to keep in mind this week.\u201d\nCrowley nods appreciatively. He watches as Lucius pulls a shirt off the floor, tugging it over his shoulders.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cWell, what?\u201d Lucius answers through the shirt still half over his head.\n\u00a0\u201cWhat about the country?\u201d\n\u00a0Lucius\u2019 head pops free. \u201cWhat? Going out there? Today? Together?\u201d\n\u00a0Crowley shrugs. \u201cIf you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI would like,\u201d Lucius insists, grabbing his button-up, \u201cI would like very much, but I have to show the four-mil on the river again. And I think these ones are likely to bite.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not disappointed?\u201d Lucius asks.\n\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley lies.\n\u00a0Lucius looks relieved as he buttons up the rest of his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s why I have to rush out honestly, they\u2019re starting soon and I want to get home and change these clothes. I don\u2019t know how anyone can wear the same thing twice in a row.\u201d He shifts his shoulders uncomfortably. \u201cIt feels ghastly.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cMmm,\u201d Crowley agrees. He\u2019s not really listening, suddenly feeling a bit distracted.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m honestly glad to be showing for so much of the day, it\u2019s a good excuse not to pick up the mobile when my sister calls again.\u201d\n\u00a0Crowley half turns. \u201cNot a fan of your sister?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not that. I love her, truly. I suppose as you do with family. She\u2019s just going away for two weeks on some Thailand escapade and wants me to watch her cat and I keep insisting I won\u2019t, but she keeps insisting I could\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0Crowley sits up a little straighter. \u201cI thought you were allergic.\u201d\n\u00a0Lucius stops buttoning, looking back at him. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cAllergic. To cats. That\u2019s what you said the other day, when I asked for your jacket.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cRight, right. Well, yes, that\u2019s exactly why I can\u2019t do it,\u201d he answers, turning back to his dressing. \u201cBut she continues to insist. Insufferable.\u201d\n\u00a0Crowley leans back again, a tiny voice in his head muttering that he said he \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d take it the first time, not \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d.\n\u00a0Lucius steps back towards the bed, dressed again. All tidy. With the condition he keeps his clothes in no one could ever guess that they were a second-day wear. In fact he looks ready for an editorial as it is.\n\u00a0He lifts Crowley\u2019s hand from the sheets, kissing the knuckles. \u201cEnjoy the country.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cBest of luck with the showing,\u201d Crowley returns.\n\u00a0And he\u2019s gone. It\u2019s thirty seconds before Crowley hears the door shut behind him out in the living room, and then it\u2019s just him, the silence of the sunlight, and the hum of the city outside his half opened windows.\n\u00a0Suddenly, the bed doesn\u2019t seem half as indulgent and exquisite as it had just a moment ago. He feels naked, and sticky, and rather uncomfortable. He stays there for a moment, trying to remember the feeling and force it with firm metal language to come back to him again, but it\u2019s no use. He sits up with sigh, swinging his feel over the side.\n\u00a0He stands, giving a quick stretch. Now he just has to decide: coffee first, or shower?\n\u00a0Coffee wins. It usually does. He\u2019s never been what you\u2019d obnoxiously call \u2018a morning person\u2019. And showers always make him sleepy all over again if they come too soon.\n\u00a0He snags his trousers off the floor, pulling them on without consideration for anything else. Pants alone would do just fine, but there\u2019s especially tall windows in his kitchen and there\u2019s only so much exposition he\u2019s comfortable performing for his neighbors.\n\u00a0The coffee\u2019s a fairly quick operation thanks to the shiny silver \u00a0wonders of the kitchen. He leans on the counter, taking slow sips, and flipping through a newspaper Lucius left on the counter. He lingers on the weather. For now it\u2019s grey, a lingering mist rolling out of the river. But it\u2019s claiming to be an almost sunny day overall. Possibly, hopefully. The country will be pleasant.\n\u00a0It\u2019s a pity to go alone. He\u2019d like to bring Anathema. She always lights up in the country, like something in the air out there reacts chemically with her skin to produce a glowing air of radiance and contentment. It\u2019s as if she falls into some harmony with things that he\u2019ll never understand, nature welcoming her home again.\n\u00a0He enjoys the country well enough, but it\u2019s certainly never welcomed him with especially open arms. He thinks of Lucius in the country and imagines that would be even less the case. It\u2019s probably for the best. They might get stuck out there for some unknown reason, have to walk through a field, ruin their shoes, likely get into some vicious row in front of gossipy sheep. It\u2019s for the best.\n\u00a0Then why does he still feel a lingering sense of disappointment?\n\u00a0He shuts the paper, attempting to shrug it off with a change of pace. It doesn\u2019t take long to get back to the bathroom. He finishes the coffee as he turns on the shower, letting the steam start to ease up around him comfortably. He critically eyes the floral arrangement he left sitting on the sink as he slips off the trousers once again. It\u2019s a very pleasant selection. Foxgloves, honey-suckle. But it needs something more\u2026 billowy. He should have added the peonies after all.\n\u00a0The shower feels utterly perfect as he eases in, and he sighs contentedly as the water rushes over him, all comfort and cleansing heat.\nIt\u2019s useless to be disappointed about the country. It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s not as if he even enjoys it that much himself anyways, and of course work is important, that sale is important. There\u2019s nothing to worry over. And thinking that should really stop the worrying. It\u2019s quite illogical that it does nothing of the sort.\n\u00a0He twists off the water eventually, reaching for a towel on the other side of the door. He glances over at the mirror as he pushes the towel into his hair. Funny. The mirror\u2019s usually fogged right up, but there\u2019s hardly any condensation. Did he leave the bathroom door open by mistake? He looks.\nIt\u2019s not a shriek. Certainly not. Just a perfectly normal exclamation of surprise and a decent helping of reasonable fear. Although dropping his towel on the wet floor doesn\u2019t help any.\u00a0\nCrowley glares at the door.\nThere\u2019s a butterfly. In the bathroom. In his bathroom. And it\u2019s sitting, right on the door handle.\nHow the hell did it get in?\nHe needs to get another towel but he\u2019s a little wary of moving outside the sealed in security of the shower. He needs to look around for clues but if he takes his eyes off the bloody thing who\u2019s to say when he looks back it won\u2019t be gone and then he\u2019ll know that it\u2019s still there, just unseen. Waiting. Watching.\u00a0\nAfter a deep breath he takes two seconds to whip his eyes around the bathroom for clues. It\u2019s not hard to find the critical one. The window is open. It\u2019s a small windows, just a thin rectangle above the toilet. Lucius must have opened it last night, not noticing that there\u2019s no screen. It must have come in, maybe after the flowers on the sink. Bloody hell why did he ever put flowers in here?\nWell. Source located. The things is still on the door. It shifts slightly, wings opening and shutting twice with slow but firm flexing movement. Crowley shudders.\nHe swallows, and very carefully, very slowly, reaches around the door and grabs another towel, tugging his hand back the instant he has it.\nThe butterfly doesn\u2019t move. It doesn\u2019t seem to mind him being dry.\nWhat the hell is he supposed to do here?\nHe\u2019s trapped. By a damned butterfly. Is that dramatic? Is he overreacting?\n\u2026 No. He really is trapped.\nIt\u2019s on the door. If it were somewhere else, across the bathroom, sitting on the lid of the toilet, maybe then he could summon the courage to bolt for the door, hoping to have enough time to tug it open and escape before it took flight.\nAnathema was merciless with her teasing, but it was entirely possible that once it took flight it would land on him. They did that. He\u2019s seen pictures. Children with their hands out in gardens and the bloody things landing right on them with their spindly legs and massive eyes, extending that long, horrible, tentacle of a mouth to feel about against the skin.\nHe shudders again. No. It\u2019s too awful. He can\u2019t risk it.\nOf course one might say he could just bat it out of the air, or slap it with a towel. But, ironic as it might seem, he didn\u2019t want to hurt it. Although he\u2019d never admit it, the idea of killing anything made him physically ill. It took him long enough to get used to cutting flowers for the sake of arrangements, and even now he\u2019ll own cut those on the end of their season. So, disgusting and dreadful as the things were, the wretchedness he\u2019d feel if he needlessly took something else\u2019s life for the sake of his own insecurities was far far worse.\nSo, what was he supposed to do? Wait for it to fly out the window again? That could be hours, days even. It has everything it needs in here thanks to his tireless efforts in home decoration.\nHe glances around the bathroom, assessing his resources. Trousers. Trousers are important.\nCrowley keeps his eyes firmly on the intruder. He slips an arm out of the shower door, carefully, carefully. He hooks the pants and tugs them back, fumbling in the pocket. He mutters a small prayer of thanks to whomever\u2019s listening when his hands close on his phone.\nHe suddenly realizes he has a problem. Who the hell is he supposed to call? And worse, what the hell is he supposed to say?\nAnathema is the first instinct. She\u2019s teased him about this before, and yes, now it will doubtless be, far, far worse than it ever was, but she\u2019s the best option.\nAn impossible option. She\u2019s gone. Again. Out of town. He curses her, and Newt, and bloody matrimony as an institution at large.\nWho else? Well\u2026 isn\u2019t \u201crescuing\u201d typically something boyfriends are supposed to do?\n\u00a0His finger pauses on Lucius\u2019 name against the glowing screen. He tries to play out the conversation in his head.\n\u00a0\u201cOh hello, yes, I was hoping you could pass on that vital showing for just an hour or two in order to come shoo a butterfly out the window.\u201d\nWell, that nixes that. And since when did he have so few friends? Was he really that miserable of a person? Was Anathema right after all?\n\u2026Oh. Oh no.\nCrowley glares at his phone. But it\u2019s not it\u2019s fault he\u2019s left with only one option. He dials before he can regret it.\nHe keeps the conversation as short as possible. When it\u2019s over he tugs on his trousers with slow and steady movements, watching the intruder all the while, and finally, he scrunches up in one corner, waiting for the inevitable ten-ton load of shame to dump right on top of him\u00a0\nIt doesn\u2019t take long.\nHe hears the door to the apartment open about fifteen minutes later. Luckily he forgot to lock it. The door shuts again. Soft steps move through the apartment.\n\u201cHullo?\u201d a muffled voice calls.\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Crowley just manages.\u00a0\nThe steps move closer. Crowley hurriedly tugs a towel over his shoulders to try and cover at least some of his torso.\nOutside the door, there\u2019s a gentle knock. \u201cHullo?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yeah,\u201d Crowley starts.\n\u201cShould I come in?\u201d the voice behind the door asks.\n\u201cYes, but, just\u2014 it\u2019s on the doorknob. So, try not to\u2026 jostle.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d the voice says comfortingly.\nSlowly, the knob starts to turn. It gets half way round before the thing takes flight.\u00a0\nCrowley squishes even deeper into the corner with a very uncomfortable noise, but the door is open now and Aziraphale hurries in. The butterfly doesn\u2019t go far, landing lightly on the flowers by the mirror.\nAziraphale makes a few soft sounds, moving quickly but carefully to scoop it up.\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Crowley mutters miserably.\n\u201cI am,\u201d he calls back. And he is. He cups it successfully, standing on his tip-toes to press it up to the open window.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he mutters. It flexes his wings once in his open hand, and then it\u2019s gone. \u201cThere.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCan you shut the window. Please,\u201d Crowley says.\nHe does just that, and then turns back to him. He\u2019s not laughing at him, so that\u2019s an unexpected bonus. It\u2019s miraculous really, considering how he must look, crouched on towels on the floor of a shower with wet hair in slacks and nothing else.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Aziraphale says, leaning back against the counter, \u201ctouch of lepidopterophobia?\u201d\nCrowley grumbles, standing up properly. \u201cJust a touch.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s cheeks suddenly go rather pink. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201c He\u2019s performing some awkward facial gymnastics as he tries to not look and not not look at Crowley all at once.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Crowley frowns. \u201cOh-\u201c No shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\u201cRight, of course,\u201d Aziraphale shrugs. He\u2019s suddenly giving off the impression of someone\u2019s dad trying to act like he understands the appeal of Vines.\nCrowley can\u2019t help smiling as he steps out of the safety of the glass shower doors. The situation\u2019s really turning around quite positively. He\u2019s not being teased for unreasonable phobias and he\u2019s even making someone else unreasonably uncomfortable with his torso. It\u2019s like an embarrassment baton pass.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says sincerely.\nAziraphale shrugs, still doing his ocular averted-attention dance. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\nCrowley snorts, running the towel through his hair one last time. \u201cPleasure might be a tad strong.\u201d\n\u201cNot a problem then,\u201d Aziraphale concedes.\n\u201cMaybe a bit of a problem,\u201d Crowley insists, tossing the towel into his hamper.\n\u201cFine, it\u2019s an utter trial. Devastatingly inconvenient. Unforgivable assault on my good will.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles. \u201cFeel free to assault my good will any time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not nearly as helpful, but there\u2019s coffee in the kitchen if you\u2019d like some.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, thank you,\u201d Aziraphale says quickly, latching onto any excuse to get out of the bathroom.\n\u201cHelp yourself. I\u2019ll get dressed. You might have to warm it up again.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cRight, good,\u201d and with that he hurries out again.\nIt doesn\u2019t take Crowley long to properly prepare for the day. It\u2019s less than fifteen minutes before he\u2019s stepping out into the kitchen once again.\u00a0\nAziraphale\u2019s standing by one of the tall windows, a steaming cup between his fingers. He\u2019s looking out at the city with a small pleasant smile.\nHe glances over his shoulder as he hears Crowley enter the room. \u201cYou have a beautiful view.\u201d\nCrowley moves back towards the coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. When it\u2019s not so foggy you can see the river just past that steeple.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Aziraphale hums, gazing out. \u201cThe fog is supposed to lift anyways, come ten or eleven. At least that\u2019s what they said.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, I heard,\u201d Crowley says tapping the paper by the kettle as he refreshes his own coffee. \u201cThankfully. It\u2019s always miserable heading out into the country when it\u2019s nothing but wet and slosh.\u201d\nAziraphale turns. \u201cYou\u2019re not going into the shop today?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Crowley says, adding just a splash of cream for this second cup. \u201cI should go and check on some of my gardens. I keep a few out in the country, there\u2019s a lovely little lady who looks in on them and makes sure they\u2019re up to snuff. But I still like to stop by and keep them in line myself once a month or so. And anyways, with Anathema\u2019s wedding coming up so soon I want to evaluate which ones will be ready when the bloody event descends.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s not too bloody,\u201d Aziraphale returns. \u201cNever a good thing for a wedding.\u201d\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know, Catholics can\u2019t seem to do without a little bit of \u2018blood\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cShameful,\u201d Aziraphale smiles, turning to look back out the window.\nCrowley smiles after him, and lets his attention linger. He looks\u2026 interesting, in his apartment. Minimalist chic has always been his Crowley\u2019s go-to when it comes to interiors. He\u2019s had this flat for almost five years now, and the open floor plan always worked with that aesthetic. He left the poured cement floor, smoothed to perfection, and the tall ceilings, one side slanted with three large skylights to let in the light.\nIt\u2019s mostly colorless, but minimal and colorless allows anything else to pop, and that was what furniture and plants and art were for. His selected furnishings could stand like sculptural pieces, and the flora he kept inside sang against the rest of it. He had one favorite orchid that he kept on the kitchen counter and even with it\u2019s subtle shades it was the focal piece of the room.\nOverall, the place matched Crowley. Sharp. Sleek. Stylish. It matched Lucius just as well, and when they were standing around in it together Crowley could almost see the World of Interiors feature spread they would make.\nIt did not match Aziraphale.\nHe wasn\u2019t stylish. He\u2019d taken his shoes off at the door in his insufferable consideration, so he was standing in a pair of colorful knit socks that matched but also didn\u2019t in a way that spoke to someone\u2019s inexperienced craft rather than a store purchase. His clothing was neat, but far from interesting or notable. Just a sweater, in a rather assaulting plaid, and a pair of corduroys that were nostalgically hanging onto some dreadful cut from 1998. The glasses, while almost fashionable again by now, really just tied the entire thing together. They looked like the exact same pair he\u2019d worn in school, and they probably were. He was just the type of person who would never lose a pair of glasses.\nHe certainly wasn\u2019t sleek. In fact if there was an opposite of sleek, there would probably be a footnote under it\u2019s dictionary entry to reference Aziraphale for further clarification. If Crowley himself were a Bugatti, Aziraphale was a 1988 Volvo four-door. And he wasn\u2019t sharp, at least not in any aesthetic sense. He was rounded edges, not hard ones, smoothed and simple and utterly unassuming.\nBut there was something sharp about him underneath all of that, something quick and bright and edged. Maybe it was just his intelligence. Crowley was already suspecting he was the cleverest person he\u2019d ever meet underneath the gentle voice and humble mannerisms. There was certainly something about that. Something about someone so clever, who couldn\u2019t care less if anyone thought him so. But, it was something else as well, something in the way his eyes caught the light sometimes. Crowley felt like if he were ever angry, ever truly, truly angry, he might be capable of incinerating something just with one glare.\nMaybe that\u2019s what made him so watchable. And he really was watching him now, there was no point in denying it. He was rather like some exceptionally clever puzzle, all outward simplicity hiding impossibilities within, or some little old woman\u2019s pierogi shop that was actually a front for a hub of international intelligence. But then at the same time, amidst all of that, he was just\u2026 Aziraphale. Standing in his living room, smiling at the possibilities of the day, and something as common-place and miraculous as a couple of London roof-tops.\n\u201cWould you like to come?\u201d\u00a0\nAziraphale turns. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cTo the country?\u201d Crowley asks.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s brow furrows for a moment. \u201cI did have a few things to do.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d Crowley says instantly, \u201cit\u2019s nothing\u2014\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019ll cancel them.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Crowley\u2019s blushing and he has no idea why. Probably residual trauma from his bathroom intrusion. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Aziraphale says simply, taking another sip of coffee. \u201cI\u2019d like a day in the country. It sounds lovely.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\nAziraphale smiles at him as if he\u2019s far younger than he is. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nCrowley tries to peddle back to the safe grounds of ambivalence. \u201cWell, if you\u2019d like. I wouldn\u2019t mind the company.\u201d\n\u201cNeither would I.\u201d\nCrowley narrows his eyes. He thinks he might be teasing him, but he can\u2019t be sure.\n\u201cOh\u2014\u201c he suddenly remembers, \u201cwhat about the cat?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Seti?\u201d\nCrowley stares. \u201cYou named it?\u201d\nNow it\u2019s Aziraphale\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cIt felt disrespectful calling her \u2018cat\u2019 all day.\u201d\n\u201cJust don\u2019t get attached,\u201d Crowley levels. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for her owners remember?\u201d\n\u201cIf she has them. But yes, yes of course. And she\u2019ll be fine. I checked her stitches and gave her her antibiotics this morning. She\u2019s happy enough to rest upstairs now that she knows where everything is. As long as we don\u2019t get back terribly late so I can give her another dose it will be fine.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Crowley takes a steady sip of his coffee. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Aziraphale agrees.\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment.\n\u201cAre you wearing that?\u201d Aziraphale asks, eyeing him.\nCrowley glances down. \u201cYes, why? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s smiling again. \u201cYou wear suits to the country?\u201d\n\u201cLocation doesn\u2019t affect the value of a well-tailored jacket,\u201d Crowley sniffs.\n\u201cMmm, of course,\u201d Aziraphale smirks, stepping closer.\nHe\u2019s finished his coffee and brushes past Crowley to get to the sink he\u2019s leaning beside. Crowley knows he should scoot to one side to make room, but he doesn\u2019t. Aziraphale\u2019s elbow brushes his arm where he\u2019s leaned against the counter as he eases on the faucet.\nCrowley focuses on his own coffee, taking slow steady sips, all the while wondering if he\u2019s close enough that he could smell him if he really wanted to try. He wonders if he would smell the same as he did back then. Sharpened pencils, and book pages printed before 1970, and just a hint of something rounder, earthier. Clover. He thinks he remembers it being something like clover.\nAziraphale\u2019s arm just brushes him against as he grabs a dish-towel. He leans back, away, wiping off his mug.\n\u201cWhen would you like to leave?\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d Crowley says. He drains the last of his coffee in one sip, trying to convince himself that he hasn\u2019t made a massive bloody mistake.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Bentley dives over another hill and Crowley takes the curve by the scruff of the neck.\nAziraphale barely smothers a terrified noise in the back of his throat. His body presses closer to the median space between them and Crowley can\u2019t help smiling. He takes the next corner ever harder.\n\u201cGoodness gracious,\u201d Aziraphale squeaks. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014 don\u2019t you think you should maybe slow down, just slightly?\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Crowley grins. \u201cI\u2019ve done this drive hundreds of times. There\u2019s rarely sheep, and only occasionally have I had to slip off road for a moment. Then it\u2019s back on again in no time.\u201d\nAziraphale shudders. Crowley only notices at the feel of it that his arm has pressed against his. Nerves no doubt.\nHe doesn\u2019t slow down. It feels good out here. Great even. Its been too long since he\u2019s gotten out in the country. Its always made him a little uncomfortable up too close. He\u2019s never enjoyed walking particularly, seeing all the little living humming bits of the natural world right up near enough to nick and dirty and scuff. But tearing past all in a rush of air, nothing but green and glorious, it feels like life\u2019s bursting on all sides and he\u2019s sweeping through it, the vivacity staining and sticking, like driving in rain.\nIt isn\u2019t a date. He\u2019s reminded himself of that at least a dozen time since they left, and he does so again now.\nHe\u2019s just invited him out, that doesn\u2019t make it anything more than an outing. Yes, he had intended it as a date originally, but that was when he\u2019d invited Lucius, and now that a friend has filled in, the purpose has shifted accordingly.\nThe fact that he\u2019s enjoying thrilling him is simply because he thrills so easily. It has everything to do with the way he twitches and frights on every hill, and nothing to do with the fact that each scare makes him shove a little closer, hands fluttering as if they might grab hold of Crowley\u2019s arm, and occasionally forgetting themselves and doing just that.\nIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that he hasn\u2019t felt sun that wasn\u2019t bounced off buildings for a long time. There\u2019s wind in his hair, and it\u2019s warm enough that he\u2019s left his jacket in the back seat. The tint to his sunglasses makes the world seem a whole new range of colors, all fantastical and amber edged. The hills roll past in waves, all green, all flashing.\nThere\u2019s three more curves, a short sprint through a few small stony buildings, and Crowley pulls to a stop.\nAziraphale lets out a breath Crowley hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he mutters. His hair is wind-tousled, askew and blown back in such a way that his bangs fall messy around his glasses and face. \u201cI don\u2019t supposed I might drive back?\u201d\n\u201cDo you like driving?\u201d Crowley grins behind his sunglasses.\n\u201cNo, not particularly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cI find it\u2026 stressful.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Crowley smiles, \u201cthat\u2019s too bad. Probably best if I handle it.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s eyes narrow as if he knows exactly what he\u2019s up to, and the worst part is Crowley\u2019s sure he does.\nHe pulls his eyes away and opens the door, unfolding the length of his lengths and stepping out onto the dirt of the road. It crunches pleasantly under his feet and he stretches, twisting his spine as he wriggles it up to full length, bracing his arms behind his head. The day feels marvelous, especially without a jacket, or a tie, and two buttons undone at the top of his shirt. He feels like the world\u2019s getting a taste of him and it\u2019s a pleasing sensation.\nHe hears a door shut behind him, and he rights himself again, turning.\nAziraphale\u2019s looking just past him, admiring the day. There\u2019s a soft smile on his face. Strange. He looks correct out here, in the sunlight, and the summer. Like a missing piece of something that\u2019s found its way home.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see many flowers,\u201d he notes.\nCrowley turns towards the small path that was for cattle less than thirty years back. \u201cJust a short stroll.\u201d\nIt\u2019s quite close, just far enough down to be off the road really. Crowley leads the way. The path cuts down to a little wooded patch stuck amongst the fields. The trees shade the softness of the forest floor, only broken by a small cattle gate that Crowley easily hops over before realizing that his companion might not be so inclined, but as he turns back to open it for him Aziraphale\u2019s already hoisted over it and landed on the other side. \nThe wood is hardly ten meters deep and then they\u2019re emerging into the sunlight again. Larks and swallows dart through the meadow before them, chasing each other with bright trills and chirrups. The fields spread, all hay fields, still just barely golden as summer approaches its height.\nThere\u2019s a feeling of a sigh. Crowley\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s his own, or Aziraphale\u2019s, or something else together. Perhaps the entire season was just letting out a contented breath all at once.\n\u201cJust over here,\u201d he says, turning where the path splits. The right path climbs further up the hill, and the other, the one they take, turns and meets a stone wall, broken by another gate. Crowley tips the latch up and pushes the gate back, opening the way. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\nAziraphale slows behind him. \u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\nThe garden is in full bloom, overflowing with top heavy peonies, tight budded roses, and the last of heavy lilacs. The fences bust with morning glories that peek between ivy, and the turns of the trail are surrounded with peering cornflowers, eager bright faced marguerite\u2019s, and brilliant delicate flax. \nIt is impressive. Even Crowley has to admit that. In the soft, warm light of the afternoon it takes on a fairy-tale quality that seems to slow time and give the air a relaxing, summer heavy weight. There\u2019s a hum on the air of insects, the occasional flit of a bird darting across the space between trees and singing out enthusiastically when it lands again on another twig.\nThere\u2019s a slight breeze that eases the flowers from side to side. They\u2019re not far off from the sea here, and it\u2019s still possible to smell a tinge of salt on the air.\nAziraphale moves towards the flowers as if there\u2019s a magnetic field pulling him forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he exclaims, \u201cabsolutely, utterly, beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley admits, stepping forward himself. \u201cIt is rather.\u201d\nAziraphale turns suddenly with concern. \u201cYou\u2019re not worried about\u2026 winged insects?\u201d\nCrowley shakes his head, blushing despite himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same when it\u2019s outside. It\u2019s the intrusion I think that\u2019s the real unsettling bit, the fact that they\u2019re in when they should be out. Close quarters. All that. Here there\u2019s plenty of space.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see.\u201d\n\u201cBut, um,\u201d Crowley tries, \u201cdo just give a call if you happen to see one. I wouldn\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\nCrowley circles first, carefully, keeping an eye out for the best blooms. \n\u201cI was thinking peonies for sure, they\u2019ve really come into their own this season.\u201d\n\u201cYes, lovely. And how about these freesia?\u201d\nCrowley eyes them. \u201cThey\u2019re quite popular for weddings.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to be commonplace.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful though,\u201d Aziraphale says, leaning down to turn peach toned blooms towards him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what matters?\u201d\nCrowley smiles. \u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Aziraphale asks eagerly.\n\u201cLisianthus\u2019s maybe?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, certainly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd stock?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\nCrowley turns another corner, investigating the blooms. He loses track of time, or must have, because when Aziraphale speaks again he realized they haven\u2019t for a while. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really lovely out, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCrowley looks up again. \u201cWhat? Oh, yes. Very.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s this light, I think. The flowers of course, but the light especially. It has this radiance, almost as though the air itself is humming in the season. You know? Everything\u2019s so content with itself and the general state of things.\u201d\nHe really does look just right out here, lower half obscured by the bobbing heads of white and pink and yellow. His glasses and hair catch the sunlight and everything about him seems to sigh.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much like Turner you know, this light.\u201d\nCrowley furrows his brow. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, Turner, when the summer gives things this gold. It\u2019s magical. I greatly enjoy Turner. Do you?\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s throat is feeling rather dry so he swallows, looking away, back to the few flowers he\u2019s gathered. \u201cYes, yes\u2026 greatly.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take them much time in the garden to assess things and determine just what to bring back for Anathema\u2019s. Aziraphale seems loathe to pull himself away when the time goes, but he goes all the same, albeit with a slightly more lingering gait as they make their way back to the car.\nIt\u2019s later in the afternoon by now, and the fine weather\u2019s holding so they stop for some tea just the next town over. It slows them down more on their return, but it\u2019s a day out after all. There isn\u2019t any need to hurry, is there? And if he takes the long way back to London again it\u2019s only because driving with Aziraphale\u2019s nerves is so uniquely interesting. \nAll of it comes together to make it well into the evening by the time they finally pull back onto their street. The shops look all settled in after a long day, snuggled together up and down both sides. The sun is still shining but its sunk low enough that there\u2019s nothing direct, only the soft bounce light of it having its last hurrahs elsewhere.\nHe pulls the Bentley into the usual space, having a stretch as he steps out into the lazy smell of summer evening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for supper,\u201d Aziraphale says, stepping out of his own side. He still seems rather rattled from the drive, but he\u2019s already looking around at the twilight and the calm of it appears to be settling him.\n\u201cMm, yes. I guess it is,\u201d Crowley notes.\n\u201cPlans?\u201d Aziraphale asks.\nCrowley glances over at him. He could have plans. If he was particularly motivated to. It can\u2019t have taken this long to show the four-mil-on-the-river.\n\u201cNo, no plans,\u201d he answers.\n\u201cIndian maybe?\u201d Aziraphale asks, shrugging his ancient tweed jacket back over his shoulders.\n\u201cIndian definitely,\u201d Crowley confirms.\n\u201cDo you need to go back to yours first at all?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well let\u2019s check in on Seti first. She\u2019ll need her antibiotic and some supper of her own.\u201d\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t named her you know,\u201d Crowley says, following Aziraphale\u2019s quick pace across the street on the uneven cobbles.\n\u201cIt felt insensitive to just call her cat.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think she minded.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know?\u201d\nCrowley grins, \u201cI suppose I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve reached the bookshop and Aziraphale\u2019s fiddling with the lock. \nCrowley\u2019s own hand traces his keys in his pocket and suddenly he\u2019s speaking. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d\nAziraphale half glances over his shoulder. \u201cYes?\u201d\nCrowley charges forward before he lets himself think what a terrible decision this likely is. \u201cWould you mind keeping a spare key for me?\u201d\nAziraphale pauses with the door. He turns to face him. \u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\n\u201cYes, well, I don\u2019t have a spare with anyone, and Anathema\u2019s been bothering me about it. She\u2019s right really, but I\u2019ll be damned if I give her one. She\u2019d likely enact some immersion therapy on me without my permission and flood the place with damned butterflies before I got in one morning. Or worse.\u201d He fishes a key out of his pocket. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d\nAziraphale stares at the key for a moment, and then back up at him with an open smile. \u201cOf course not. Happy to.\u201d He takes the key, brushing his finger for just a moment. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nCrowley laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re the one doing me the favor.\u201d\nAziraphale looks back at him. \u201cAll the same.\u201d\nCrowley swallows. There\u2019s a sarcastic something on the tip of his tongue but it doesn\u2019t quite make it past his lips, and all the same as Aziraphale\u2019s gotten the shop unlocked.\nThe door gives with a gentle creak and Crowley slips inside after Aziraphale.\nIt\u2019s quite dark without the lights on and the sunlight retreating out on the street. The books loom all around, especially ominous and wild looking in the dark. He half expects to hear rustlings in the back of piles, maybe a few whispered words escaping from the pages that would give a sense of clustered life they seem to hold. But there\u2019s nothing but a dense quiet, and the occasional muffled noise from the street.\nAziraphale doesn\u2019t switch on a light and heads right for the stairs to the second floor instead. Crowley follows and as soon as their up them it\u2019s brighter. The apartment isn\u2019t nearly as crowded and up off the street level the sunlight has more room to dance inside the outdated decor.\nThere\u2019s a soft noise off to one side and Aziraphale\u2019s already moving towards it. Down in her bed the cat gives a tentative stretch, turning her face up towards Aziraphale. He smiles down at her, giving her a few long and loving pets from head to rump, followed by a handful of more precise ear scratches.\n\u201cShe\u2019s looking much better, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nCrowley turns. \u201cWhat? Oh, yes. I think so. Much.\u201d\nHe steps closer, looking down at her. She eyes him with a lazy sort of skepticism. He smiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. I don\u2019t even really like cats.\u201d\nAziraphale glances at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYes. They\u2019re very cruel things. Though I suppose it\u2019s not their fault if they\u2019re designed that way.\u201d\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Aziraphale notes.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou, not liking cats.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\nThe corner of Aziraphale\u2019s lip pulls upward. \u201cYou\u2019re rather like one.\u201d\nCrowley let\u2019s out a huff. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you really are,\u201d Aziraphale insists. \u201cYou have this sort of refined aura, just like cats do. You seem like you could crawl out of a cardboard box in an alley and still make it look fashionable.\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help laughing.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re like cats with people too. I remember that from school. I see it with Anathema. You act as though you don\u2019t need anyone, but you always have one or two whose laps you\u2019ll crawl into and start purring in despite yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is that right?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well, if I wanted a strained metaphor with psychological understatements I\u2019d go find Anathema.\u201d\n\u201cApologies,\u201d Aziraphale said as if he doesn\u2019t intend any.\n\u201cAnd what do you mean you remember from school? Has your memory improved all of a sudden?\u201d\n\u201cThings are coming back,\u201d Aziraphale shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s helped being around you. You\u2019re different of course, but the same as well. I suppose that\u2019s how it is with everyone.\u201d\nCrowley wants to say that Aziraphale\u2019s not different in the slightest. But he doesn\u2019t. For some reason it sounds like a compliment and he doesn\u2019t want it do.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t popular, but in that sort of subtly aggressive unpopular way that\u2019s dark, fashionable way and makes you actually quite popular indeed. Everyone knows of you, few know you sort of thing. People knowing your name, your look, but not anything close to camaraderie. Rather ridiculous really.\u201d\nCrowley grins. He likes him when he\u2019s like this. All that polite care momentarily beaten back by the brute strength of his sincerity. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\u201cMm, and you had a reputation you know?\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Crowley says, rather smugly, as if he didn\u2019t know. \u201cOf what kind?\u201d\n\u201cThe girls used to all have you on speed dial.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault women find me attractive.\u201d\n\u201cNot like that,\u201d Aziraphale rolls his eyes. \u201cThey had a theory about you. They said that if they ever wanted to do something rather wicked, and had some misgivings, all they had to do was call you and you\u2019d have convinced them to wander down any sinful road within eye-shot.\u201d\nCrowley laughs. \u201cWell, they were often very pretty roads no matter how sinful. And imagine if they went on forever always wondering what was down them and never knowing?\u201d\n\u201cI think there was more than one heart broken for all their knowing,\u201d Aziraphale chides.\n\u201cHearts break. Then they spring back together again. They\u2019re rather marvelous like that. And it\u2019s a rather boring heart if it doesn\u2019t have any stories to tell.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes they don\u2019t spring back so easily.\u201d\n\u201cIs this why you never hung around me very often?\u201d Crowley grins. \u201cAfraid of heart-shattering shrapnel?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, very intimidating.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my key back,\u201d Crowley threatens.\n\u201cNonsense.\u201d Aziraphale gives Seti a few more strokes. \u201cLet me just get her supper and we can go. She won\u2019t take the medicine without some vittles. Can\u2019t say I blame her. It looks beastly.\u201d\nHe bustles into the kitchen. Crowley follows with idling steps, leaning against the small door-frame that separates the kitchen from the rest of the apartment.\n\u201cHow much longer do you think it will be till she\u2019s moving about properly again, anyways?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure exactly,\u201d Aziraphale says from inside a cupboard, \u201cbut I suppose no one can be. The vet told me that it wouldn\u2019t be too much longer, though. If things go as they should. Less than a week hopefully. Ah!\u201d He emerged from the cabinets again with a can of cat food between two fingers. \u201cNow where\u2019s that vagrant can opener.\u201d\nCrowley looks about along with him. \u201cHere,\u201d he snatches it off the counter just beside him. \u201cThis it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, lovely.\u201d Aziraphale takes it from him and leans over the counter nearby, trying to get it into the grove correctly.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Crowley starts, \u201cthere\u2019s a lovely Turner collection at the Tate.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know. It\u2019s one of my favorite places,\u201d Aziraphale answers. The can opener takes with a satisfying metallic click and he begins turning the handle round, opening the thing\u2019s steely mouth inch by inch and allowing the smell of salty shiny meats into the kitchen. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in a year though. Shameful. Anything new?\u201d\n\u201cA few actually.\u201d\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d he\u2019s suddenly looking at him, face lit up with something ecstatic. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2014 ah, fuck!\u201d\nCrowley freezes. The cat food drops to the counter.\nAziraphale hisses through his teeth, pulling his finger up to his mouth. He begins sucking on the edge of it, muttering to himself. Crowley sees a little smear of red and looks to the jagged metal edge of the cat food tin. He cut himself. Must have. \nHe should ask if he\u2019s alright. Why isn\u2019t he asking if he\u2019s alright? Why does he feel as if he\u2019s suddenly gone rather pale? And why can\u2019t he stop looking at the way he\u2019s sucking at the end of his finger?\nAziraphale pulls his finger back again. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d he says, cheeks a little pink. He peers down at the finger, eyeing it critically. \u201cI never, ever swear, really, it\u2019s quite rude. Well not for some I suppose, I don\u2019t really mind it, I just don\u2019t like to. Feels wrong. Not that it is\u2014\u201d he was rambling \u201c\u2014I was just surprised. I am sorry.\u201d\nCrowley opens his mouth. Then closes it. Then opens it. \u201c \u2019S alright.\u201d His voice sounds off. Croaky. Not alright. \u201cReally,\u201d he says, just to confirm.\nAziraphale tuts, still preoccupied with the finger. It doesn\u2019t seem to be too bad. More of a deep paper cut than anything. Then why does he still feel as if there\u2019s no color in his face? He\u2019s never had problems with blood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not deep,\u201d Aziraphale notes, pulling a bit of paper towel off the roll and wrapping it around. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will stop bleeding in a moment. Let me just get her fed and put a plaster on it.\u201d\nHe shuffles past Crowley who\u2019s managed to make some dumb raspy agreeing noise. He doesn\u2019t follow him into the living room. He can hear him scraping out the food and talking to the cat and then bustling in what must be the bathroom. \nCrowley stares at the space he left behind in the kitchen. \nHe he\u2019s never heard him swear. Not in school. Not in the past weeks. He thinks he almost did once. Once in a close bathroom. Close and breathless. With the sound of a party going on just through the door. But he\u2019d bitten it back, through closed teeth and eyes shut tight as he ground back against\u2014\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Aziraphale declares, stepping back towards him. \u201cGood as new.\u201d He steps closer, and suddenly his smile weakens. \u201cAre you alright, you look a bit off?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley clears his throat with one hard sound. \u201cI\u2019m fine, fine.\u201d He tries to convince himself it helps to say it out loud. \u201cFine.\u201d He\u2019s not convincing anyone. \u201cJust don\u2019t like blood.\u201d\n\u201cAh, right, sorry,\u201d Aziraphale says sincerely.\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Every time he bloody says that it feels less true.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale tries, smile weakened but still optimistic. \u201cShould we?\u201d\nCrowley turns sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nAziraphale peers back. \u201cDinner?\u201d\nThe color rushes back into Crowley\u2019s face as a hard blush. \u201cRight, yes, yes,\u201d he catches himself. \u201cI mean no. No. I just realized I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d the optimism falters. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it really is, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Crowley says. The rhythm of speech is coming back to him. It\u2019s easier to lie like this, to weave and spin half truths. Feels familiar, comfortable. \u201cI just got a call. I forgot about some plans I made.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Aziraphale doesn\u2019t seem convinced. He should be. It\u2019s almost annoying that he isn\u2019t. Crowley\u2019s an excellent liar. World class. Certainly good enough to lie to a damned bookshop owner.\n\u201cMaybe another time,\u201d Aziraphale says.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Crowley answers. He smiles, as flash as he can manage, but he knows it\u2019s likely a wavering 60% of maximum charm.\nHe hurries towards the steps, feeling the blush returning. He can hear Seti hungrily swallowing her food as he turns the stairs. He manages to get out through the shop with only knocking one or two books off their stacks and then he\u2019s out onto the street.\nThe heat of the day suddenly isn\u2019t lovely at all. It\u2019s stifling and muggy. He pushes through it like an angry local in a crowd of tourists and by the time he gets home he\u2019s almost panting. A glass of filtered ice water doesn\u2019t seem to help much.\nHe finds himself leaning back against the stainless-steel counter top, staring blankly at the kettle on the stove opposite. It stares back. Or rather he stares back out of its reflection. He looks slightly disheveled and wide-eyed, which is the fault of the heat of course, and rather oblong, which is the fault of the kettle.\nHe takes one deep breathe. It doesn\u2019t help. The moment is playing on repeat in his head like some flashback in a spy movie.\n\n\u201d \u2014 Ah, fuck!\u201d Hand rising. Finger to lips. Lips open.\n\nCrowley closes his eyes and takes another breath.\n\n\u201d\u2014Ah, fuck!\u201d Hand. Finger. Lips. Open.\n\n\n\u201dAh\u2014\u201c Crowley\u2019s hand catching the his. Aziraphale catches a breathe. Close. Pulling closer. The smell. Same as before, all that time ago. Sunshine. Clovers. Aziraphale\u2019s finger. Crowley\u2019s lips. Aziraphale\u2019s mouth dropping open. \u201cFuck\u2014\u201c\n\nCrowley opens his eyes. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nWhat the bloody hell has he done?\nHe knows he\u2019s done something, something terrible and wrong and very, very stupid. He must have, or else he wouldn\u2019t be thinking quite loudly about spinning the frumpy fool around in that little kitchen, shoving his mouth against his, and working a hand between\u2014 \nHe pulls the nearest bottle of wine off the counter without bothering to check the label. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever opened a bottle so quickly in his life. He takes the first drag right off the top and moves for the cabinets while swallowing, thumbing one open and grabbing a glass. He lets himself get one more good gulp before pulling the thing back with a wet popping noise and filling up a massive helping.\nAnd this might not be such a good idea. If he has too much, hell, if he has just a little too much, the overwhelming instinct to simply say \u201cfuck it\u201d and fall back into bed, drunkenly thumbing open his trousers and wanking to the image of Aziraphale huffing out curses into the curve of his shoulder.\nAnd fuck, that sort of thing really isn\u2019t helping at all.\nCrowley grabs the wine, and the glass, and walks decidedly into the living room. He flicks on the TV and drops into the leather of the sofa. Such occasions call for proper distractions, and no one\u2019s around to mock his viewing history so why shouldn\u2019t he flip on four straight hours of Golden Girls? He needs something comforting and sexless in a 90\u2019s floral prints sort of way right now.\nHe drains the first glass and makes it through one whole episode before he realizes the thoughts aren\u2019t going anywhere.\nDropping his head back he closes his eyes and lets himself go. If the thoughts aren\u2019t going away he might as well let them have their say. Maybe once they give him a good trashing they\u2019ll move onto greener pastures.\nHe\u2019s been trying to distract himself. Distract himself from what? An image? An inclination? Was that really it?\nHe doesn\u2019t think so. He\u2019s never been shy of his inclinations when they do raise their heads. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of after all. He\u2019s always been perfectly comfortable in his sexuality. He isn\u2019t ashamed of the occasional lewd thought or image. All it takes is indulging the image, giving in, letting it wash over, and then it\u2019s a thing of the past.\nSo what makes this different?\nHe\u2019s his friend. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. Maybe he doesn\u2019t like to think about friends like that. But if you think about friends like that that\u2019s when they turn into something else other than friends, isn\u2019t it?\nMaybe he should just ask him out.\nThat idea comes out of the mists like a ship too close to rocks and the panic that lights up in his chest almost shocks him.\nBut why not? Why not ask him out? If he\u2019s a friend who he thinks about in certain ways. Suddenly, almost violently. Then why not?\nBecause he has a boyfriend. And for all he knows \u201cOnly Justin\u201d is hanging around for more than disorganized books. \nBut is that really a reason? He\u2019s certainly broken it off with people before when something else interesting comes along. He\u2019s never been disloyal. Infidelity always rather turned his stomach. Hell, with other relationships he\u2019d have broken things off well earlier, given the thoughts he\u2019s been having. But these were only recent thoughts weren\u2019t they?\nAnd this feels more complicated. Stickier. When he thinks about breaking it off with Lucius and asking Aziraphale out for a coffee his stomach twists in a wretched uncomfortable way. It never did that in those other cases. \nWhy? Why is this different?\nBecause he wasn\u2019t interested before. So why would he be now?\nCrowley feels his stomach sink behind his ribs. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? All of this? They had something. A moment. A nice one. No matter how short. But it was gone the next day.\nPart of him had expected a call. An acknowledgment. Something. But there had been nothing. And then he sees him again ten years later, politely jogging across a street as if nothing could be further from his mind, and suddenly it really was nothing. It really couldn\u2019t matter less.\nThat was it. That was all it was. Some wounded pride. He didn\u2019t want to ask him out. He simply wanted to patch something up that had started leaking nastiness all over his well tended self image. \nHe didn\u2019t want to ask him out. He didn\u2019t fancy him. He had a someone and it wasn\u2019t him. He didn\u2019t want to be. He was altogether the wrong someone. That was obvious to anyone. Him most of all. \nIt wasn\u2019t that he was an unlikable bloke. Not at all. Just the opposite in fact. Just not for him. So what if there was some forgotten drunken moment squished between ten years of ancient history? There were bound to be a few of those weren\u2019t there? \nSo what if he had some thoughts? They were just thoughts. Like dreams. Sometimes thinks pop into your subconscious. Things you don\u2019t really want. They\u2019re just fancies. No. Less than fancies. Synapses. Synapses firing wherever they please and occasionally hitting an image that\u2019s especially vivid. But that doesn\u2019t make it anything more than a few microscopic jolts of electricity.\nWhy would he be interested in someone who couldn\u2019t even be bothered to remember him when he had exactly what he\u2019d always been looking for already?\nThat settles it. Neat and tidy.\nHe opens his eyes again. The television cackles back at him in familiar voices.\n\u201cYou know what they say: you can lead a herring to water, but you have to walk really fast or he'll die.\u201d\nHe smiles, but not as easily as he knows he should. \nOne episode passes and the images are still hanging about. Five episodes, and he realizes that settled or no, the mental image isn\u2019t leaving him alone. Ten, and he finishes the bottle in hopes of being unconscious as quickly as possible. \nIt only half works. By the time he hits his bed he\u2019s half asleep. The words slip. Memories run together. Dreams spill in, and the thoughts are crowded with fresh senses as sleep slinks in all around.\nThe restaurant is new to him, but that\u2019s nothing noteworthy. It\u2019s London after all. It seems like every half-bearded lost soul lately was scrambling about in a mad craze to spawn milkshake delicatessens, or nuts only patisseries, or mead bars, or american hot dog gourmets. Some of the absurdities manage to hit a decent note, but like any improvisation, many fell flat. Although, Crowley couldn\u2019t deny he rather enjoyed watching such a circus trickle through his town.\nLucius seemed to have a knack for rooting out the particularly amusing ones. The one they\u2019re at now, just as with many of the others, apparently hadn\u2019t been open for more than a week. The places always seemed to be \u201cjust in\u201d or \u201cunspoiled\u201d when they arrived, and funnily enough they never went to the same one twice. Novelty seemed the deciding factor, and the places slipped in and out of obscurity with the speed of celebrity diets.\nThe place today is quite cozy, which is a novelty within the novelties. It\u2019s a ramen nook, tucked into a long, thin space along a set-back street. The area isn\u2019t anything sought after, and the exterior doesn\u2019t turn heads. But the interior is warm, and close, with a homey feeling that lacks pretension. There\u2019s two long wooden tables, one for each wall, ending with a sturdy worn door on one side to enter, and a tiny crawl-space of a kitchen on the other. \nCrowley and Lucius sit side-by side on the windowed side of the long space, tight with the other patrons. There are no menus. You had what they were serving. Each day was a particular broth and a particular preparation. With a kitchen that size Crowley can\u2019t really blame them for limiting themselves. It may be a coincidence that what the chef would call simply efficient quality control, the ever-growing \u2018foodie\u2019 populace decided to label as a intentionally designed elitism. Either way, what he\u2019d seen thus far looked quite appealing, and the steam of pork-broth, heavy with fresh leek and soy-drenched mushrooms filling the place is prying at his stomach already.\n\u201cSupposed to be very good. Excellent pork I heard, and Genevieve would know. She was vegan for three or so years, until meat made a come back and everyone realized just how idiotic they\u2019d been. In any case, she\u2019s mad for the stuff now, and she\u2019s been raving.\u201d Lucius is focusing on the table, nudging his paper napkin in polite yet efficient circles against the heavy lacquered wood. When the surface seems to meet his needs he delicately rests on elbow against it. \nHe\u2019s wearing a light blue blazer, a linen blend with white silk in the inside, visible under the one rolled cuff around his wrists.\n\u201cSmells lovely,\u201d Crowley notes, picking up his sake cup with two fingers and tipping some back.\nLucius picks up his own, studying it. \u201cPity they serve it warm. You\u2019d think they\u2019d know better.\u201d\nCrowley ignores him, pushing back the thought that the Japanese owner of the restaurant likely knows exactly how he wants his sake served.\nTheir waiter presses into the small space behind them, two large white bowls high in each hand. \u201cTwo?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Lucius smiles, leaning back. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe man slides the bowls down and instantly hurries back to the kitchen. Crowley pulls a napkin and a pair of chopsticks out of the communal holder in front of them, snapping them open and letting himself lower into the heavy aromas of the steaming broth. It tastes exactly as fantastic as it looks, all herb and fat and just a hint of anise on the edges. \nLucius a polite approving sound, consuming the tricky noodles with practiced ease.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the shop?\u201d Lucius asks between mouthfuls.\nCrowley looks up. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s your shop? You seem to have been spending more time away the past week or so than usual.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all fine. Good. There\u2019s no reason for the time really, I just,\u201d Crowley blinks and regathers. \u201cI know that with the wedding I\u2019ll be going flat-out for several days, so I wanted to take some time before then.\u201d\nLucius shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. It\u2019s been nice seeing more of you.\u201d He lets the sentence hang with a sly edge that Crowley reads perfectly well.\nThere have been quite a few frantic, short-breathed moments: shoved between sheets, pressed against counters, pushed up onto sinks. More than usual perhaps, yes, but that hardly means anything. Weddings mean stress, and stress means a need for relief. And it isn\u2019t that he\u2019s been avoiding the shop. That would be ridiculous. He simply hasn\u2019t seen a pressing need to be present, and it\u2019s a nice to have a little break. A little break clustered so tightly with warm skin and taut limbs that his brain might actually stop working for at least five minutes or more once in a while.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those advantages isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Crowley asks.\n\u201cHaving your own business. Taking whatever time you like,\u201d Lucius says. \u201cI mean I know that\u2019s something business owners never like to hear, because of course it\u2019s quite a bit of work and freedom comes with it\u2019s own responsibility. But it\u2019s different than what you did before isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCrowley laughs. \u201cYes. It is different.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stick with it?\u201d Lucius asks. \u201cLaw, I mean? You must have been very good.\u201d\nCrowley pauses over his noodles for a moment. It\u2019s not a long moment. The easy answer comes out just as it always has.\n\u201cI was bored.\u201d\nLucius laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it just is rather dull, you know. \u2018What do you do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a lawyer\u2019. Rather a dull answer. Much more interesting what you\u2019re up to these days.\u201d\nCrowley stares out the window. People drift by on the small street. Suits. Shoes. Shirts. Faces. Some bright. Some clouded. He finds himself turning back.\n\u201cWhat if I was just a bloke?\u201d\nLucius is still focus on his bowl. \u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean, what if I wasn\u2019t featured, or sought after, or did something \u2018much more interesting\u2019? What if I didn\u2019t have a \u2018tastefully avante-guard\u2019 flower-shop? What if I was just some bloke? Would you have looked twice?\u201d\nLucius turns, face keen and manicured. \u201cRather hard not to look twice.\u201d\nCrowley almost feels himself start to smile, but he pushes it aside. \u201cHonestly.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d Lucius asks, eyeing him carefully. \u201cWould you be you if you weren\u2019t interesting?\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help pausing. \u201cI might be.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of being \u2018just a bloke\u2019,\u201d Lucius continues. He starts to smile. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing Gucci sunglasses in a bloody ramen shop for christ\u2019s sake.\u201d\nCrowley does flush then despite himself. He tugs the damn things off and pushes them into his breast-pocket as Lucius laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it! Goodness, what\u2019s gotten in to you? Do you want to be just a bloke?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley says. But the flush might be crawling against his neck now for being the first one to add \u201djust\u201d to the beginning of that label.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for them to finish lunch, and Lucius, still doing his best to unload that four-mil-by-the-river, settles for a quick kiss against his car before turning it back to the main streets. Crowley watches the Audi leave, all shine and smooth edges against the sharp lines of the city. He decides quickly it\u2019s a nice enough day for a walk. \nHe\u2019s a ways from the shop and his apartment but he doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s pleasant enough winding in and out of the streets for an ambling return. And he does let the amble work it\u2019s way into his limbs, slowing his pace considerably more than usual. It\u2019s the weather he thinks. The day is startlingly pleasant. In the morning there had still been a drizzle sulking in the corners of the sky, but a good breeze midmorning had convinced it to shove off for everyone\u2019s good. Now there\u2019s only a smattering of clouds, basking in the sunlight with as much pleasure as the rest of them.\nThe warmth of the beams feels glorious against his back as he weaves through alleys and side-streets, doing his best to stay in the light.\nAbout half way back, his pocket gives a rumble. He glances down, pushing a hand inside to make sure. Definitely ringing. With a sigh he begins to fumble. The phone\u2019s being difficult. That\u2019s three rings already. He\u2019ll miss it. He tugs it out with one final pull, just glancing down at the ID. Anathema.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\nSomething jingles to the ground. He looks down just in time to see his keys vanish into a sewer-grate.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\u201cNice to hear your voice too,\u201d Anathema returns, tone all tin and amusement through the mobile.\n\u201cOh bloody christ!\u201d he continues, circling the grate and glaring down.\n\u201cBad timing?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only made me drop my damn keys.\u201d\n\u201cYou only have trouble getting things out of your pants because you wear them too damn tight.\u201d\nHe\u2019s only half listening. With the sun as it is it\u2019s easy enough to peer down into the depths of the sewer. There\u2019s nothing but fast flowing water, likely run-off from that morning\u2019s rain. No sign. Not even a glimmer.\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u201cA tragedy, really. Look, sorry to be unsympathetic but I\u2019m right in the middle of something here and I just wanted to call and remind you about the thing,\u201d she continued quickly.\n\u201cYeah, right, the thing,\u201d Crowley continues, hardly hearing her. He tries circling the other way. Maybe they got stuck on a bit of stick or something half way down.\n\u201cSo you remember then?\u201d\n\u201cRight, of course.\u201d Nothing. Still. There\u2019s even a friendly bit of cable hanging out where they might have caught, but no. Of course he isn\u2019t that lucky.\n\u201cRight so tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cMm, right.\u201d They\u2019re really gone. He can\u2019t see a thing. \n\u201cRight, good. Have to dash then. Newt\u2019s family seem to have lived in test tubes most of their lives and are still adjusting to the realities of the natural outside world. See you then!\u201d\nIt takes him a moment to realize she\u2019s hung up. He pockets the phone.\nNo keys. Certainly a problem. Which keys exactly. Well, the apartment. That\u2019s alright, the handyman keeps spares for the tenants somewhere or other. The car. He has a spare in the little drawer on his night-stand. The shop \u2026 \nSuddenly the sun doesn\u2019t feel quite as excellent against his cheek. Why the hell hadn\u2019t he bloody drove?\nIt doesn\u2019t take more than half an hour to finish the walk back to the shop street. The sun hasn\u2019t let up yet, pouring heavily over his shop on the bright side of the street. Someone\u2019s looking in his window at the closed sign with a perturbed expression. He ignores them.\nThe bookshop\u2019s in the shadows, as usual. Funny. Just a few weeks ago it was only an old shop that had always been there, rather lopsided, depending on the good will and support of other buildings to keep it upright and correct. Just an old shop he\u2019d always rather taken a shine to, and now it was what, something to avoid?\nThat\u2019s the truth isn\u2019t it? He has been avoiding it. It just seemed the right thing to do under the circumstances. Things have gotten rather muddled, like taking a stick to a placid stream bed and giving things a good stir about.\nIs it worth all that fuss? What had Aziraphale even done? Cut himself on a can and accidentally made Crowley feel like someone nailed him into a sauna the size of a locker? He didn\u2019t mean it. And in any case it didn\u2019t matter, did it? He needs the keys, and discomfort isn\u2019t changing that fact anytime soon.\nHe crosses the street in a few quick strides, pausing at the door. The inside seems dim and clustered as usual, books piled high in the window, making it hard to peer beyond them inside. Who knows, maybe he won\u2019t even be in.\nCrowley reaches for the doorknob. The door pulls open from under him.\n\u201cOh!\u201d he manages.\nA boy blinks back at him from inside. A rather tall boy. Early twenties. Brown hair, a sharp, classical line to his features. Justin he remembers. \u2018Only Justin.\u2019 \n\u201cOh, hullo,\u201d the lad smiles. He has several books in his arms, and it seems to be a challenge to keep them all in place. They appear older, but well bound.\n\u201cShopping?\u201d Crowley can\u2019t help asking.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Justin says, following his attention down to the volumes, \u201cI\u2019ll bring them back. I\u2019d better, or else he gets in one of his moods. You know,\u201d the lad winks. \n\u201cThat right?\u201d Crowley tries not to glower.\n\u201cOh yes, take my word for it,\u201d Justin continues, edging past him onto the sidewalk. \u201cAll the best.\u201d\nCrowley manages a nod after the boy as hurries back into the sunshine, books tight under his arm. He watched him for a moment longer and then turns inside himself.\nThere\u2019s no one in the shop, which frankly isn\u2019t shocking on a day like this. There\u2019s no sound, only the muffling weight of books against the air, sitting silent and comfortable on all sides, watching him with lulled indifference. No sign of Aziraphale.\nIt doesn\u2019t feel quite right to call out. Everything seems so still, it seems almost heretical to break it. He glances around instead. Funny. It always seems so close and dingy under the old lights and the ancient walls, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a spec of dust on any of the books. Not even the tiny volumes slid high in the farthest reaches of the shelves.\nThere\u2019s a soft sound by his ankles. He looks down. Seti blinks up at him, golden eyes round and brilliant. She presses her side along his shin in one smooth line, opening her little mouth to let out a one mew.\n\u201cHullo lovely,\u201d Crowley smiles. \u201cLook at you now.\u201d\n\u201cSeti?\u201d Aziraphale calls. His head pops around one of the back bookcases. \u201cOh!\u201d\nCrowley suddenly isn\u2019t sure what to say. But Aziraphale is too quick for the need to present itself. \u201cGoodness,\u201d he pulls himself around the counter, \u201cwe haven\u2019t see you in days! Shameful. Look at how well she is. She\u2019s been moving about everywhere, all on her own.\u201d\nSeti stretches up, putting her front paws on Crowley\u2019s knee and looking up at him expectantly.\n\u201cCould I\u2026 do you think?\u201d Crowley asks.\n\u201cOh yes, of course,\u201d Aziraphale agrees.\nCrowley scoops her up in one carefully motion. She feels lighter than she ought to, but then again the last cat he held was one Anathema was sitting for a friend half a year or so ago. He was convinced she\u2019d been feeding it nothing but buttered scones.\n\u201cThere see,\u201d Aziraphale smiles, adjusting his glasses. \u201cShe missed you.\u201d\nCrowley looks down at the rounded face, floppy body melted into his elbow, all vanilla ice-cream fur and softness. She sticks out a paw in the way that cats will, pushing it flat against his sunglasses.\n\u201cRude,\u201d Crowley mutters at her.\n\u201cWedding preparations?\u201d Aziraphale asks.\n\u201cPardon?\u201d Crowley looks up.\n\u201cJust you haven\u2019t been around the shop. I assume the wedding has been quite demanding.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Crowley manages. \u201cQuite.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ve uncovered a secret, while you were away.\u201d\nCrowley looks up at him, perhaps a little too quickly. \u201cIs that so?\u201d \n\u201cMmm,\u201d Aziraphale nods. It\u2019s that pleasant sound again, a sound like there\u2019s nothing wrong in the world, and even if there are, a few wheedling nasty bits in the darkness, they won\u2019t be any trouble at all at the very end of things. His eyes are curious and sharp, with all that intelligence carefully layered in amongst humility and curiosity. True curiosity. Not the common brand that heads out into unknown worlds just to shoot everything that looks interesting enough to hang on a museum wall and \u2018understand\u2019. It\u2019s the kind of curiosity that wants to see badly enough to know exactly how far off it ought to stand and exactly how little it should claim to already know.\n\u201cWould you like to see?\u201d Aziraphale presses.\nCrowley isn\u2019t sure when he started smiling. \u201cWhat sort of secret is it?\u201d\n\u201cEasy to keep. A joy to uncover. A treasure to hold.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a riddle?\u201d\n\u201cJust come have a look, would you?\u201d\nSeti pushes her warm, pink paw against Crowley\u2019s lips. He can still feel the scar on her side against his palm, just a patch of her fur, shorter than the rest, with a puckered hidden line running clean across the middle.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Crowley agrees.\nHe follows Aziraphale up the close steps towards his apartment, but they don\u2019t go inside. Crowley sets Seti down on the steps and she skips in with a swish of her upright tail.\n\u201cJust here,\u201d Aziraphale mumbles. He swings the door to his apartment shut, revealing a door that leads further up the stairs behind it. Crowley hadn\u2019t realized the steps continued. Of course the building was more than two stories but he\u2019d never seen Aziraphale\u2019s door closed before.\nAziraphale fiddles with the knob and with a complaining creak it opens. The smell is different beyond it, dusty and tired, like the smell behind new walls laid over old bricks. \n\u201cHere we go,\u201d Aziraphale says, pushing onward up the stairs. Different stairs, older boards that didn\u2019t seem to have ever received a coat of paint.\n\u201cWatch your head,\u201d Aziraphale calls back, tapping a low board. Crowley ducks under it, following him up into the growing dark. \nAt the top of the stairs it\u2019s almost entirely hushed shadow. Aziraphale tugs at a bulb on a string but the luminance stays close-at-hand, huddled sleepy against the dusty air.\nCrowley stares for a moment. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s an attic.\u201d\n\u201cVery keen,\u201d Aziraphale moves across the attic floor. It has that cobweb and mothballs smell that most attics do. It\u2019s hard to see just how large it is, but Crowley can see some wooden crates further back that he assumes are against walls, the sort of crates you only see in films that involve ports and steamers and shouting Irish accents. The wooden beams along the roof are ancient, never been treated. Aziraphale\u2019s footsteps leave ghost imprints in the dust as he moves.\nCrowley follows him hesitantly, trying not to be too obvious as he checks for cobwebs and arachnids lying in wait under each beam.\nHe reaches Aziraphale\u2019s back eventually. Aziraphale\u2019s fiddling with another door. This one seems rather out of place with the others, heavy and apparently a newer make.\nThe latch clicks open. Aziraphale wiggles it but no luck. He gives it a shove. Still nothing. He let out a small sigh, the sort that Crowley imagines a special sort of granny making when her marmalade gets a bit messy during canning. Aziraphale leans back and jams his shoulder against the door for one last push. The thing swings open and sunlight crashes into Crowley\u2019s face. He\u2019s instantly glad he hadn\u2019t taken off his sunglasses, blinking against the brightness, attempting to adjust enough to actually see.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Aziraphale says with a satisfied tone. Crowley must have followed him the few steps out onto wherever they are because he hears the door swing shut behind them without latching. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nCrowley takes a proper look around, eyes adjusted finally. It\u2019s \u2026 quite extraordinary. He didn\u2019t know buildings this low could have such sunlight in the city. It isn\u2019t a large rooftop. He\u2019s realizing now that it\u2019s only half of one. The attic\u2019s behind them, with a slanted roof that comes to a stop at it\u2019s apex and drops into a the brick wall behind them, before flattening out for the rest of the length of the building, giving it a open flat roof. There\u2019s a clothes line ready along one side, and a few empty, long forgotten planters on the other. There\u2019s a bench against the brick wall, wooden and simple, left behind by whomever came before them. And it seems someone had taken a more recent effort with the place. Strung along the half a meter or so high wall that prevented a drop straight down to the street, someone had strung fairy lights. There was even a helpful outlet in the brick. Crowley walks over to it curiously and gingerly plugs them in. To his surprise they flicker into life. \n\u201cLucky,\u201d he notes.\n\u201cI may have done those,\u201d Aziraphale admits behind him.\nCrowley stands up again, slipping his hands into his pockets. The light is exceptional up here, truly extraordinary. It\u2019s coming from the south-west, where there\u2019s a few low buildings on the other street, as old as Aziraphale\u2019s, and then a little park it seems beyond, if the leaves peering over the rooftops are anything to guess by. It\u2019s a decent view. Better than decent, really.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Aziraphale asked.\nCrowley leans back on his heels. He closes his eyes for a moment. There\u2019s a slight breeze that still smells a little of rain. \u201cGood secret.\u201d\nAziraphale seems pleased with that. They stand in silence, letting the sun fill the space between them.\n\u201cI thought it might make a nice spot for a garden,\u201d Aziraphale notes.\nCrowley turns to him.\n\u201cNot to presume,\u201d Aziraphale says hurriedly, \u201cand not that your country garden isn\u2019t lovely, because it is, there\u2019s just space up here, and light, and it being so close\u2014\u201c\n\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nThe silence folds back in. \n\u201cThank you for taking care of the cat,\u201d Crowley says finally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure. As I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\u201cI should be helping more. I didn\u2019t mean to stay away for so long.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a few days.\u201d\nCrowley shrugs. It hasn\u2019t felt like only a few days.\n\u201cNot to impose,\u201d Aziraphale says, \u201cbut I do have a lovely new bottle of merlot, or two, I managed to find last week. We could\u2026\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s smirk finds it\u2019s way up his cheek. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no idea really,\u201d Aziraphale says, \u201cI tend to loose track of it.\u201d\nCrowley checks his own phone. \u201cRather early.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles back at him, that hesitant, and yet oddly practiced, mischievous look in his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that the Americans say?\u201d\n\u201cFive-o-clock somewhere?\u201d Crowley tries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\nThe sun is strong against his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. He shuts his eyes again under the sunglasses. The air smells fresher up here somehow. He must be imagining it. \n\u201cI should go into the shop,\u201d Crowley says.\n\u201cRight, of course.\u201d \nHe looks at Aziraphale. \u201cFor a bit.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll come back. Just a little later.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles back at him. He has his hands in his pockets. The sunlight\u2019s caught in his glasses. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d He\u2019d forgotten. How had be forgotten? \u201cI need keys! Mine fell down a bloody drain. You have the spare set I gave you?\u201d\nAziraphale reaches into his pocket and tosses something to him. Crowley stares down at the small brass key in his hand, with a simple ring and a small leather label printed in perfect handwriting. Crowley\u2019s Shop.\nThe day moves by lazily. It\u2019s hardly five by the time he\u2019s back across the street, bearing a few treats from the Italian deli around the corner along with him. There\u2019s an Italian loaf, as thick and decedent as cake, some genoa salami thin enough to see through, and a messy rolled mozzarella, warm from an afternoon sitting in the sunny window. Aziraphale gathers it all up gleefully, muttering to himself as he assembles a small dinner kit in the kitchen while Crowley gives Seti a proper petting down, taking some more time to inspect her scar. It\u2019s almost invisible under the fur, and feels as uniform as can be. \nThe steps up to the roof seem shorter the second time up, and the attic much smaller when he knows the destination. \nThe sunlight isn\u2019t nearly as brilliant against the roof this much later the afternoon. It\u2019s slipped low enough to hide behind the buildings further off, but the orange light is still pooling in great warm piles all across the space. He\u2019s surprised to see that Aziraphale\u2019s put a few cushions against the bench. He\u2019s even brought a small wooden end-table up, where the wine\u2019s already waiting. It\u2019s simple, but Crowley suddenly finds himself feeling more relaxed than he has in days at the sight of it, and after the first bottle of wine starts to come to an end he wonders if when the last time he felt so relaxed even was.\n\u201cRight down the drain?\u201d Aziraphale asks again. \u201cWell, it hardly sounds like her fault, dear boy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always her fault. She wills these things I swear. She was on me for years about keeping a spare set.\u201d\n\u201cJust her luck then, because you listened, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Crowley grumbles. \u201cShe probably hexed them, mixed up juniper for peppermint and threw the thing off a few days is all.\u201d\n\u201cOh, very likely,\u201d Aziraphale smiles into his wine. \u201cI\u2019m sure with a wedding approaching she\u2019s most concerned with causing you annoyance.\u201d\n\u201cYou joke, but it\u2019s all too real.\u201d\n\u201cAre you always so dramatic?\u201d\n\u201cNot dramatic,\u201d Crowley insists. Maybe he is on his fourth glass. He\u2019s dropping words a little too easily, leaving them behind with hardly a glance in the rear-view. \u201cDramatic is loud.\u201d\n\u201cAh, then what are you?\u201d\nCrowley pauses for a moment, eyeing in consideration the distant leafy treetops catching the last of the light. \u201cRefined.\u201d\nAziraphale actually snorts into his glass before muffling his laughter. Crowley gives him a look, but can\u2019t help smiling himself. The sun must be on the horizon by now, with the light all flushed and brilliant. He reaches over with a slight stretch and plugs in the fairy light.\nAziraphale gives a brief, considerate applause beside him.\nCrowley leans back. He follows Aziraphale\u2019s glance out, towards the old rooftops. He gives his glass a few taps with the tip of his finger. Ah well. It\u2019s as good a chance as any. Might as well give it a go. \u201cHow\u2019s the shop been?\u201d\nAziraphale gives a shrug that again reminds Crowley of that very particular sort of gran, the sort who names all her chickens and maybe knits them vests for the colder months. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anyone it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a salesperson,\u201d Aziraphale notes.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not strictly true I suppose,\u201d Crowley forges on, boldly sticking to his course. \u201cI did see someone on my way out today.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, Justin.\u201d\n\u201cSeemed to have a decent stack of merchandise.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s only borrowing.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a special customer privilege,\u201d Crowley asks, jumping for the last hurdle.\n\u201cTo an extent,\u201d Aziraphale says. \u201cHe has a classics course he\u2019s having trouble with.\u201d\n\u201cIn the business of tutoring?\u201d Crowley can almost feel his toes catching the edge of the hurdle but it\u2019s too late now to fall back.\nAziraphale\u2019s smile rises. \u201cFortunately not. He\u2019s just a student. His teacher is a friend, and I have an arrangement with several of the libraries for the local universities. Many of my volumes are sought after, but I refuse to donate them despite being pressed. It would be like abandoning old friends. So select students are allowed to come and review the materials. Some can borrow take them under very particular instruction.\u201d\n\u201cAh I see. Book nanny,\u201d Crowley grins.\nAziraphale wrinkles his nose. \u201cVery flattering.\u201d \n\u201cBook warden.\u201d\n\u201cWorse.\u201d\n\u201cThe Guardian of the Tomes.\u201d\n\u201cThat will be quite enough of that, thank you.\u201d\nCrowley grins into his wine, and tries not to focus on that fact that Aziraphale, quite on his own, added \u201cjust a student\u201d to the description. It\u2019s an easy thing to ignore. It\u2019s the perfect temperature, warmth just under hot with a breeze almost the same temperature pushing it\u2019s way past. That sort of temperature were the breeze almost feels like swimming through the air. And the wine is very good, all oak and plummy accents chasing each other around his tongue. Added all up with the face that the light is putting on quite a show with the last moments it has. It\u2019s hard to see the horizon from here, with so many buildings between them and it, but it must be spectacular, judging by the hard blush that everything around has taken on. Overhead there\u2019s nothing but that pale blue that always feels conceding when the rest of the sky decides to put on a big finale. \n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any of that sort of thing when we were in school,\u201d Crowley says, staring up at the wispy blue above. \u201cSeems there\u2019s less need for books these days.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s always need for books. Some things don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Crowley tilts his head to one side. His sunglasses feel a little lower on his nose. He thinks they do that on their own when he\u2019s had more than two drinks, as if they\u2019re trying to make a run for it while he\u2019s distracted. \u201cSomethings change. I\u2019m not a lawyer. And you certainly don\u2019t seem to be a priest.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, now how did that happen?\u201d Aziraphale muses.\nCrowley likes that. Aziraphale does it very well. Avoiding questions that have only been implied and turning them back around on themselves. It was unassuming, and would give anyone the impression of modesty if they didn\u2019t see quite how clever it was.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid your in a better position to answer that than I am,\u201d Crowley says.\n\u201cOnly half of it,\u201d Aziraphale returns. \u201cWhat about you? What happened to watching the pulse of justice and turning the country\u2019s wheels from the inside out?\u201d\nCrowley snorts. \u201cPlease, no one is that naive.\u201d\n\u201cThen what were your motivations?\u201d\nCrowley lets the rounded girth of the red-wine glass rest on his lip for a moment before taking another swallow.\n\u201cI thought I would be good at it.\u201d\nAziraphale leans back against the bricks, watching him. \u201cWere you?\u201d\nCrowley smiles, but he can taste the bitterness on it. \u201cVery.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that skills we have don\u2019t always amount to happiness, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nCrowley glances over. \u201cIs that what happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a collar.\u201d And damn that came out sounding massively awkward, but Aziraphale doesn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\u201cOh, well, I suppose\u2026 although I don\u2019t know how good I ever was at being a priest.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem as though you\u2019d be quite good.\u201d\nAziraphale looks at him. \u201cReally? What makes you say that?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Crowley leans back, easily crossing one long leg over another, \u201cyou\u2019re rather\u2026 a nice sort of person.\u201d\nAziraphale can\u2019t seem to help smirking. \u201cHigh praise.\u201d\nCrowley eyes him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know how many nice people I can name. But it\u2019s not just\u2026 you have a way about you.\u201d\n\u201cA way?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Crowley stares off at the edges of the sky, trying to focus but his mouth seems to be doing all the work for him. \u201cYou listen. When people speak. It seems simple. It isn\u2019t. You listen and you seem to genuinely care wether people are miserable or not. And you even seem as though you\u2019d take an effort to try and change their misery into something less, given half a chance. Less than half a chance. Hell. None of a chance.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s looking at him. He can sense it without looking back. He takes another drink of wine. The glass should feel heavier. He leans back with a sigh, tipping it in his companion\u2019s direction. \u201cAt least that\u2019s my sense. Seem good priesting traits. Listening. Caring. Helping. All that nonsense.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles, tipping the bottle and refilling Crowley\u2019s glass before topping off his own. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I thought as well. Back then.\u201d\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d\nAziraphale sighs, leaning back and setting the wine down on his side of the bench. \u201cSeveral things. Life mostly. It moves on, and things reveal themselves. You reveal yourself along with it. I knew that priests weren\u2019t angels. I didn\u2019t want them to be. I certainly didn\u2019t want to be one.\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help it. \u201cI think you did. A little.\u201d\nAziraphale actually blushes. \u201cWell, alright. Maybe a little. I just\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Wanted to help.\u201d Crowley finishes. He can hear the hollowness in his own voice. \n\u201cI thought that if I could help, that\u2019s what I ought to do. There\u2019s something so beautiful in theology. Something so perfect about an empty church, all echo and vastness and with all that you can almost feel something there with a hand on your shoulder. There\u2019s a peace there, a peace that I loved. I still love. I just wanted\u2026 to share that feeling.\u201d\nCrowley gazes off at the crisp lines of the buildings, empty windows staring back at him. He feels Aziraphale\u2019s shoulders sag next to him.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a good priest.\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s glasses are catching the light. He takes another long sip of his wine. \u201cIn many ways I was actually a very bad priest indeed.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s tempted to say that sounds like a romantic novel he might pick up but manages to keep it down.\n\u201cI listened. And I do like to listen. But sometimes when you really listen it just seems quite misplaced, and even rather cruel, to tell the lad who\u2019s so soft-spoken you can barely hear him through the confessional grates, that if he just sits in front of a cross and says a few words for half an hour the feelings will go away. That they\u2019re supposed to go away. Or worse yet that the pain he feels is somehow making something else love him.\u201d\n\u201cI think if you described Christ to a therapist she\u2019d tell you to get out of the relationship as quick as you can run,\u201d Crowley let\u2019s slip. \nThe regret floods in as soon as the words are free. It\u2019s not his place, and he really has no right to address anyone\u2019s religion let alone their personal relationship to it. He\u2019s about to apologize but Aziraphale\u2019s already laughing.\n\u201cThat was exactly it, really,\u201d he continues. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand how anyone could accept suffering as a form of love. I didn\u2019t understand how people could bring their beautiful, perfect infants to me to \u2018purify\u2019 them, when nothing could be more faultless. And I felt shame, when I watched my brothers sacrifice things that gave them happiness, while I dreamed of getting fat on wine and well cooked lamb, sitting on a comfortable chair rather than a stern bench, listening to the world\u2019s stories one at a time, without waiting for my turn to tell them the \u2019truth\u2019.\u201d\nThe fairy-lights glow a little brighter against the low wall. A smooth breeze catches, pushing up and over the roof with a lazy stretch. Crowley sits exactly where he has, and tries to remember if he\u2019s ever heard anything quite as perfect as that in his life.\n\u201cSo, I suppose you can pawn my crucifix, and label me a sinner,\u201d Aziraphale smiles. He raises his glass towards Crowley\u2019s. Crowley manages to come back to himself. At least enough to knock his glass against Aziraphale\u2019s with a crisp ting. \u201cCheers.\u201d\nThey drink for longer than usual.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse then?\u201d Aziraphale asks.\nCrowley turns. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI was a poor priest. Good enough reason to avoid the habit. But you said you were quite a good lawyer. Why stop?\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help smiling. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the second person to ask me that today.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you popular,\u201d Aziraphale teases.\n\u201cOh, quite.\u201d\n\u201cAnd? What did you tell them?\u201d\nCrowley focuses on the roll of the wine-glass against his hand. He watches the weight of the liquid catch along one side and linger there before slipping back down again. \u201cSome nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to have a knack for that.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense?\u201d\n\u201cAvoiding truths.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to have a knack for finding them.\u201d\n\u201cJust a hobby.\u201d Aziraphale holds his glance with that same gentle smile. It\u2019s quiet on the street down below. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a car on their road, all the sound of traffic distant, muffled behind layers of warm summer air.\nCrowley sighs, leaning back against the bricks. They\u2019re still warm from the sun of the day. He\u2019d hung his jacket on the door and he can feel the heat easing up through his shirt. It feels even better than the breeze pushing against his skin, sleeves rolled up just to the elbows, top button given a break from it\u2019s duties on the Marc Jacobs oxford.\n\u201cI wanted to help,\u201d he admits. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever really knew that myself. On the surface, in the mind I knew clearly, it seemed an elegant way to spend one\u2019s time. Rich. Intelligent. That all seemed just right. I understand people. They\u2019re quite fun to understand, and it makes law rather easy. But one day, all at once it seemed, I was tired of liar\u2019s smiles and people who knit fate as passively as though they were making bloody mittens. The next day I was exhausted. And the next I knew, that if I kept going, I\u2019d simply fall apart, one piece at a time, day by day, like some breeze on cigarette ash. And there\u2019d be nothing left to see the color of flowers any more.\u201d\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment. Somewhere a few streets over a woman laughs loud and clumsy.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Aziraphale says finally.\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Crowley frowns.\nAziraphale looks at him. \u201cI think you\u2019d always see the color of flowers. No matter what happened to you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a strange feeling behind Crowley\u2019s stomach, as though someone\u2019s looped one very thin string around something he never knew was there, and given one quick tug.\nHe puts his wine to his lip very quickly. Half the glass vanishes.\nAziraphale\u2019s chuckling to himself. \u201cYou are different you know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\u201cThen when we were in school. Quite different.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d Crowley presses.\n\u201cNot for me to say,\u201d Aziraphale shrugs. \u201cBut you dear boy, have settled right down.\u201d\n\u201cBugger that,\u201d Crowley can\u2019t help muttering, turning back to the view.\nAziraphale laughs. \u201cOh come now, you certainly don\u2019t seem to be the same menace that you were.\u201d\n\u201cI was no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cThere were quite a few yarns. It was like something Olympian, really.\u201d\n\u201cWere hurdles involved?\u201d\nAziraphale gives him a look that might have been scolding if it weren\u2019t quite so lazy. Maybe he\u2019s as drunk as he is. And christ, he really is drunk isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s still sitting down, that always makes it hard to tell. Maybe he should stand up just to test. But no. No that rarely goes well.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me it was all hearsay?\u201d Aziraphale asks. \u201cI have to admit that would almost be disappointing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there was exaggeration involved,\u201d Crowley says, perfectly aware of how that was just as good as confirming every story while maintaining a guise of modesty.\nAziraphale smiles back at him as if he sees right through that trick. \u201cWell, now I just don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d Crowley says, wiggling his glass. Aziraphale fills it right back up, and his own, which Crowley notices has since emptied.\n\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re a practiced liar, quite the rouge,\u201d Aziraphale says. Crowley pretends he isn\u2019t describing him like a highwayman in a romance novel who sweeps noble women off into highland love-nests for a good deflowering. \u201cAnd I can see how the image of a shadowy Don Juan could have helped you ascend advantageous social ladders in the dormitories\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 \u2018A shadowy Don Juan\u2019? How about I run back to my apartment and fetch my cloak and saber, would that satisfy you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only curious,\u201d Aziraphale tuts. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. I told you already, I enjoy stories.\u201d\n\u201cPervert,\u201d Crowley chuckles.\n\u201cNot those sorts of stories!\u201d Aziraphale blushes. \u201cGoodness gracious.\u201d\nCrowley could easily say that with that sort of blush he obviously quite does enjoys that sort of story, but even thinking that is somehow making his mouth feel dry and his collarbone a little itchy so he swallows it. \n\u201cAlright, alright, what sort of stories?\u201d\nAziraphale settles back and takes another sip. \u201cI was curious, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you a story,\u201d Crowley says. His brain catches up half a second later. His tongue is heavy and loose and tastes like plums gone sultry after years cooped up in big mean oak casks.\n\u201cI was only teasing you.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll tell you a story. I feel doubted. \u2019S never good.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel doubted,\u201d Aziraphale hurries.\nCrowley reaches up a takes off his sunglasses. They\u2019ve slipped almost halfway down his nose and it\u2019s getting absurd. He manages to tuck them neatly in his shirt pocket without too much trouble. He blinks against the light. Everything\u2019s so sharp thrumming with reds and brights and life. \nHe tilts his head to one side. \u201cDo you want to hear a story?\u201d\nAziraphale can\u2019t seem to help looking back. He smiles that small smile that knows so much more than it lets on. \u201cIt better be a jolly good one.\u201d\nCrowley let\u2019s his head fall back against the bricks with a dull thunk. \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d His memory slips over moments like a hand drifting against tall grasses in a field, catching now and again on the bright face of a buttercup or the rough graze of wheat. Faces. Mouths. Fingers. Fewer than he\u2019s sure anyone might guess. \nThe corner of a dark stairwell. Shiny shoes, slipping against flagstone. A breathe caught beneath his fingers. \nOrange hair. Short. A greedy grin. A smell he thinks is hay. He\u2019s not exactly sure. He\u2019s never really been all that close to hay. \nA bedroom. Small. Close. There\u2019s a warmth all around from the kitchen down below. The older boy\u2019s voice. He kept apologizing. Crowley still wasn\u2019t sure if the boy was talking to him or himself.\nA smile. A smile that knows so much more than it lets on, hitting like an arrow shot from meters away. Just a smile. A little messy. Not afraid. Maybe never afraid. Not really. Not deep down in the heart of all things. Faces passed between, shapes and shadows. Music. But the smile hit, and some shard of that smile seemed to dig into his chest, twist, lock, and slowly, it began to drag. He didn\u2019t mind. In that moment, he\u2019d seemed to know, that he\u2019d been waiting for it to strike for sometime, that he\u2019d known all along as soon as it did, there\u2019d be nothing he could do to stop what came next.\n\u201cThere was a party,\u201d Crowley says. \nAziraphale rolls his eyes. \u201cAh, of course.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like parties. Don\u2019t like them,\u201d Crowley continues. The words feel pleasant on his lips, like the warm fingers of summer air easing against his hair. \u201cEspecially college parties, noise and crowds and mess. Everyone trying on different personalities to see which ones flash the brightest and loudest.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and you\u2019re very subtle.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said you wanted a story?\u201d\nAziraphale just grins into his wine.\n\u201cIt was a special party,\u201d he continues. \u201cSome holiday or birthday or other.\u201d Sarah\u2019s Birthday. April 22nd. \u201cAnd someone or other had convinced me that I really ought to go, don\u2019t remember who.\u201d Renee Martinez from Medieval Philosophies. \u201cSo I went.\u201d\nHe takes another sip of wine before continuing. \u201cIt was some dorm in one of those old stacked buildings, where it seems like a labyrinth of old flooring smells and tight stair-cases that circle forever. Music. Loud and everywhere. People talking ten times louder to hear themselves over it. The entire building was filled, must have been after finals or something along those lines, because there was this sense that no one was planning on leaving early and there was not bit of guilt on any face over that.\u201d\nIt was so easy to slip back into it. The feeling of stairs tight with bodies, so many voices against the music, all writhing and twisting together into nothing but a pressing warm noise. Squeezing up the narrow space, holding a bottle of wine high enough to avoid any trouble. His bottle.\n\u201cI may have been a little drunk.\u201d Sarah spotting him as he pushed through the last bodies on the stairs, yelling out. Him grinning back at her like an idiot before remembering himself. And then Renee had been there, pushing a knee into the back of his legs and he just managed not to fall right back down the stairs while both of them tumbled into hysterics. \u201cIt may have felt rather nice to be a little drunk.\u201d\nRenee and Sarah pushing him from place to place, just about carrying him between them, voices familiar and warm on either side, the wine tangy on his tongue and just right fizzling down his limbs. And then he was alone, the two of them dancing, close and eyes sleepy with drunken interest, Renee\u2019s hand on her hip. There was a wall behind him, so he leaned on it, and lifted the wine bottle for another sip, scanning the room with hazy interest. Laughing faces, heavy eyes, flying hands, open mouths. It was the perfect image of what it should be, exactly what could be expected, so much so that he could shut his eyes and likely play out the rest of the party perfectly well behind his lids. And that\u2019s exactly why it was so surprising. He wondered later if that\u2019s all it was. Someone surprised him. It had been a long time since he was properly surprised.\n\u201cSomeone was there. Someone I didn\u2019t expect.\u201d\n\u201cDid you have a roster?\u201d\nCrowley smiles. \u201cAt that point I like to think I had a sense of things. I like understanding places, or rather people in them, seeing how they knit together and fall into individual pockets of lives. It\u2019s always been entertaining understanding people. In college I felt I had everything neatly lined up in rows and columns. There were the ones who went to parties no matter how much homework they had, the ones who went only once their desk was clear, the ones who went when they finally short circuited and were compulsively drawn towards anything unacademic, the ones whose friends dragged them by the ankles once out of every ten times, and the ones you never saw at parties no matter whats. One guess which category this one fit into.\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t been the only one to notice. Sarah and Renee tumbled towards him, all drunken smiles and hands off the tether of self control, looping around each other freely. \n\n\u201dDid you see who\u2019s here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201dThere\u2019s quite a few people here.\u201d\n\n\u201dHe\u2019s being coy.\u201d Smiles. Bright and young.\n\n\u201dHe\u2019s not very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThing was, there was a sort of unspoken bet around this person.\u201d\n\u201cAh, the plot thickens.\u201d\n\u201cNo one had ever seen them with anyone, despite interest. Stories floated around of invitations extended and offers levied, all to no avail. Which wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise really, but still interesting.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it surprising?\u201d\nBecause theology students tended to have that dreamy-eyed lost expression that was always looking for something more than earth-bound to solve their problems. But he caught himself.\n\u201cMathematics student,\u201d Crowley continues, taking another deep sip. It was getting darker, the thick colors soaking as blue crept in from the corners. \u201cThey usually just circled around their own pond and had too much work to do to focus on anything else, even off season. Like some rare nocturnal mice.\u201d\n\u201cWould I have known them?\u201d\nCrowley manages a shrug. \u201cDoubtful. But maybe. Name was Richards, Edmund, or Edward Richards or something along those lines. Don\u2019t exactly recall.\u201d\n\u201cMm. And this bet?\u201d\n\u201cUnspoken.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you said.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026 everyone rather wanted to see what it would take.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an easy lie. Easier than the truth that somehow one tentative smile had sliced away the world.\n\u201cAnd what did it take?\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help but notice that he\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s probably had two glasses too many. Aziraphale doesn\u2019t exactly slur, it\u2019s almost as if rather as if there\u2019s no one watching the gates as closely as they ought, like a window left open in summer for the breeze even though a storm might sweep in any minute. His tone is loose and comfortable and that slight concern he seems to have normally, that tone that might in dramatic circumstances be called clucking, eases, loosens, relaxes.\n\u201cDid you ask them to dance?\u201d\nCrowley almost laughs. He tries to imagine what Aziraphale\u2019s imagining this post-grad party to be and a 1943 dance hall is probably the closest to.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley answers. There\u2019s a quarter of a glass left and he\u2019s nursing it as well as he can. If he fills it up again he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll make it off the bloody roof. Instead he focuses on the horizon of the building, that short raised wall separating them and this close quiet from millions of other huddled lives, slipping into night as the dark settles down around them.\n\u201cI normally talked to people,\u201d he continues, voice quiet, \u201cto get what I was after. At least I used to, back then. I suppose I still do. There\u2019s something about that which uncurls people, or rather shows off all their little locks and hinges and makes it easier to snap ease open. You can see how they glance and shift their weight and you can mimic it just enough and contrast it in just the right ways. It\u2019s interesting. Intriguing. And with things as simple as words you can draw someone in. Clicks on a fishing reel. One at a time. But this was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDifferent.\u201d \nHe\u2019s not sure if he said it or not. It\u2019s getting so dark. The fairy lights prick through the deepening indigo like ships, bobbing far off out on a darkened sea.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I said a single thing. Not one word. It was as though all the words had been said already somehow. I don\u2019t know how or when, but that\u2019s how it felt. It felt as if there were centuries of words, close and far and lost and found. There was nothing left to say. The reel had finished clicking. And there we were.\u201d\nThe wine glass is warm under his fingers. He\u2019s been holding it so long.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t press. I didn\u2019t need to. I didn\u2019t follow, and they didn\u2019t come. It was as if we both knew that everything would come together, leaves on a pond with the wind blowing the same way.\u201d\nHe laughs. It\u2019s quiet. It feels so close. Like no one in the world can hear it but them, despite the entire city leaning back into the summer air, just out of reach. \u201cIt was new. I spent so much of my time back then looping little strings about people and plans so I could just give them a bit of a tug when I felt I needed to. It was a strange thing to feel as though there had been a little string around me all along. Strange. But wonderful too. Thoughtless and easy. So, very, very easy.\u201d\nWhen did it get so still? The warmth of the air is so pleasant, thick, like the wine in his head, luxurious and silken.\n\u201cA hour passed. Maybe a few. I don\u2019t know exactly. There was laughter, and girl\u2019s hands on my arms easing me from one corner to another. Smells. Women\u2019s jasmine perfume and spilled beer and old plaster. A buzz. Just a buzz all of it. And through it all the glance of a smile, a look, silencing everything, painting it for just what it was, time slipping past that didn\u2019t matter, because soon enough\u2026 soon enough everything would align.\u201d\nHe can feel the bricks behind his head. Lower than before. Is he sinking? The fairy lights wink. A few lights in distant windows have clicked on to join them.\n\u201cIt was late. There weren\u2019t nearly as many voices as there had been. Just a handful of the loudest. There was a hall, towards the back. It was dark. Close. Likely felt closer with that much wine in the veins. I was heading\u2026 I don\u2019t know where. Because then he was there. And it felt as if, of course, I had always been heading towards him.\u201d Crowley smiles. It feels lopsided. \u201cI don\u2019t know what ever got in the way.\u201d\nHe\u2019s certainly sitting lower. There\u2019s no denying it. The brick is warm against his back. A shoulder, just as warm, and somehow more solid, against his. He lets himself lean. He\u2019s feeling rather off balance. He doesn\u2019t want to fall.\n\u201cIt was\u2026\u201d His throat feels dry. He doesn\u2019t know why. \u201cHe took my hand. I\u2026 I didn\u2019t remember the last time anyone had done that. He just eased it, so careful, so sure, right into mine. And for a moment I actually didn\u2019t know what to do. The reel had stopped. Time had come together. He was there. Right there. And for a moment it felt as if I\u2019d never actually\u2026 seen anyone, no one, before this man, standing in this darkened hall, with his hand in mine.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all so sharp suddenly. The entire moment, close and deep.\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think I could have stayed there a long time.\u201d\nSafe. Seen. Seen and not afraid.\n\u201cBut his hand tightened on mine. I heard his breathe catch. Lips opening. Just a touch. Surprised. Staring at his hand in mine as if it was some sort of miracle, and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from kissing him.\u201d\n\nWarm. Shocked and open in a way that was almost terrifying.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd suddenly the world and time and place and the rest of it snapped back into place, all hands and fumbling limbs. I don\u2019t remember if I pushed or he pulled but there was a wall behind him and our joined hands tight above his head and he just\u2026 god, the way he opened. It felt like spring.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere miles away a sober version of himself is trying to yell something, but he can\u2019t hear it. He suspects it\u2019s something along the lines of \u201dshut up now for the love of christ you unprecedented idiot\u201d. It couldn\u2019t matter less. After all he\u2019s not leaning against warm bricks on an splintery bench. He\u2019s holding the past against the wall of a shadowy hall way, hardly believing how hard he\u2019s breathing in such a short amount of time. \n\n\n\n\nHis hand had slide down the wall, clumsy, a cool metal handle catching under it.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a bathroom. Something. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. I just opened the door and we stumbled back. More clumsy than anything else. He didn\u2019t seem to want to let go of me, and in that moment, well, I understood that feeling. I remember the feeling of his hands on my hips, fingers and bones. I remember getting a hand in his hair, easier than I thought. Tilting his head just \u2014 he didn\u2019t seem used to kissing. There was something so intoxicating in that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a tightness hiding under his stomach. His voice is quieter. Almost a whisper. But he feels so close. He knows it\u2019s not too quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSelfless. Shameless. It was\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019d pressed him back. Up. The counter. Legs tangled. Mouths warm. Open. He\u2019d pushed closer, urgent suddenly, desperate even. He\u2019d felt the heat of him through his jeans, tight between his thighs. He\u2019d gasped, and then, even then, he held his hand.\n\n\n\n\nHis can feel hair tickling his cheek. He\u2019s not sure who\u2019s leaning on who. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s strong enough to turn the half an inch it would take to look.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d His voice feels rough in his throat. The thing in his stomach twists meanly. \u201cI never wanted to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy did you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe question settles. So close. Warm against his skin.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSo close. He can feel his forehead against his now. Warm. Smelling of spring and open fields heavy with promises of life. \n\n\n\n\n\nRenee pounding against the door. Sarah laughing hard enough to break behind her ribs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA moment of fear staring back at him. Just a moment. But it sliced all the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought you wanted me to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe can feel a nose just against his. Breath so close. Close enough it might just be his own.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow could I\u2026 how could I possibly?\u201d he whispers back.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley blinks.\n\n\n\n\nThe tightness in his stomach jumps. The warmth of skin eases. He only realizes half a second later he\u2019s the one who pulled back.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale seems as if he\u2019s trying to focus. His eyes are heavy, but there\u2019s confusion clustering in already. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\nThe tightness is getting worse. Crowley tries to make the world fit properly again. \u201cYou-\u201c He\u2019s even further away from him now. It seems to be happening all on it\u2019s own. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s cheeks are flushing, his eyes darting down. He seems so lost suddenly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you think\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\nCrowley moves to stand. The wine sweeps up to his head in one motion and he stumbles. Aziraphale catches his arm. He pulls it away.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou lied to me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale stares back at him agonized. \u201cI\u2014 it wasn\u2019t that. I didn\u2019t mean for it to be that. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t isn\u2019t a part of it!\u201d Crowley tries to stand straight. His voice is louder suddenly. He thinks he might be yelling. \u201cYou did. You said you didn\u2019t remember me, and you did!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale looks utterly miserable, suddenly unsure of wether to sit or stand, stay back or move towards him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a bother! I saw you before, well before you saw me. Your\u2026 Lucius showed me the shop, the space, and afterwards, he crossed the street and you were just arriving. He met you at the door. And I knew you. Instantly. Of course I did. How could I not? But it was obvious that\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to think I wanted anything, needed anything. I didn\u2019t want you to assume I would be any bother. It seemed the easiest thing. The cleanest thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley tries to think. It\u2019s hardly working. He feels sick. The wine is suddenly far too heavy in his stomach, the lightness of his head infuriating.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 I \u2014 you let me believe that you just forgot me. Even then. After that night. Do you know what the next week was for me? The next month?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe distant sober voice is yelling at him again but he still can\u2019t seem to listen.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey slammed on that door and you looked so afraid, so startled, as if you remembered who you were, what you were training for, and I couldn\u2019t help stopping. And you didn\u2019t tell me not to!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say? What? Wait for me to make myself something that doesn\u2019t care? That pulls no matter what pushes against it? That\u2019s what you hoped for?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t keep it. You let it slip past. And when they shoved the door open you simply slipped out. Away. What was I supposed to think?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014 it was a confusing moment. I wasn\u2019t\u2014 I didn\u2019t understand what to think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI actually waited.\u201d Crowley laughs, but it sounds broken even to him. \u201cI actually waited for you to say something. To be in touch. I went to places where I saw you and pretended I had some other business just to see if I might catch you. But you were gone. Just gone. And then what? You arrive here, and you act as though you don\u2019t remember a single thing?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to cause discomfort,\u201d Aziraphale tries, voice pathetic and wrung.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley laughs again, only this time it doesn\u2019t stop nearly as quickly. The fairy lights blur against his eyes. The wine feels like wet cement in his veins.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s voice is quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Aziraphale stands. \u201cJust\u2026 I am so very sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to cause anyone pain. I shouldn\u2019t have left without a word. I\u2014 I didn\u2019t think it mattered to you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nThe words slice despite everything else. For a moment he can\u2019t bring himself to move.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Aziraphale says. \n\n\n\n\nCrowley takes a deep breathe. He hurries past him, tugging open the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you have to be sorry for?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ever started any of this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe door swings shut behind him, heavy and final.\n\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t fall down the stairs, which is a small miracle. He doesn\u2019t hear anyone following him. He\u2019s not sure if that makes him feel better or worse.\n\n\n\n\nIt takes four tries to get the keys in the lock of his apartment. Inside it\u2019s dark except for the orange flood of the city. Dark and empty. Utterly empty. \n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a bottle of wine in the fridge. A note. Lucius\u2019 neat handwriting. Some apology for not being around more often. Some promise of taking him away for the weekend when the four-mil-flat sells.\n\n\n\n\nIt takes Crowley under ten seconds to cork it. It takes ten minutes to finish half. Thirty more to vomit. And hardly five to hit the bed.\n\n\n\n\nHe falls asleep in his shirt and trousers. The fresh sheets are probably supposed to smell like spring. But there\u2019s nothing of spring there, only a lie knitted out of chemicals, and soon enough there\u2019s only darkness.\n\n\nHe can\u2019t remember the last time he was hung over. At least not like this. Maybe never like this. \nIt\u2019s past eleven by the time he drags himself out of bed, sunlight beaming in like some agonizing friendly neighbor. He manages to make it a few feet before charging into the bathroom for another vomit. But that\u2019s alright, the aspirin is in there anyways. And the shower. Very important the shower.\nCoffee for lunch. Two cups. He drinks them half collapsed on the counter, bony elbows propping him up, hair still a little damp where it hangs loosely getting in the way of his eyes. He sweeps his bangs back and they thankfully cooperate. The coffee steams up his sunglasses but he\u2019s glad he put them on all the same. The sun is still far too persistent.\nWhat\u2019s left of the wine bottle from the night before is sitting in the sink next to him. He gives it a good scowl. The note isn\u2019t where it was stuck. He\u2019s pretty sure he crumpled it up and threw it somewhere. He considers looking for it now so finding it later won\u2019t spur a whole new wave of guilt then thinks better of it. Anyways, it\u2019s easier not to think right now. Thinking seems the worst idea, like pouring a handful of worms onto his brain to dig in and have a good munch.\nNo. No thinking. Anyways, what is there to think about? He said everything he had to say. Perhaps, lurking somewhere, there\u2019s the thought that this entire situation was his fault after all, that he never should have gone over there at all, that he was asking for it to happen, that he was just about gagging for it, and what else was he expecting, and why didn\u2019t he just check his phone, and when did Lucius come up, and where did he think he was when he wasn\u2019t home, and did he try to call, and where was he now?\nCrowley groans out-loud, slipping a little lower on the table. The sunlight is starting to shove off at least, it\u2019s more shaded in the apartment than it was just a few minutes ago. He glances out the window, over the smaller buildings where his view gives him a good look at the sky. There\u2019s a heavy mass of grey stretching it\u2019s fat fingers over half of the city. It was just a matter of time now before the sun was obscured altogether.\n\u201cThank the lord.\u201d\nHe very carefully peels himself off the counter and shuffles closer to the couch. There\u2019s a white faux fur blanket neatly folded behind the cushions. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t take long to fashion a crude shroud and hunker down into the folds of the sofa. \nHe\u2019s not sure how many Golden Girls episodes go by, curled into the corner of the couch, his temple pressed into the armrest. He\u2019s just as unsure of what time it is when there\u2019s a sudden, loud knock at the door. \nHe jolts, instantly bracing for the rush of pain to his head, but it doesn\u2019t come. In fact he realizes he hasn\u2019t felt ill for an hour or more. He blinks as the faces on the screen, bathed in pastel light, roll their eyes and purse their lips.\n\n\u201cHere you are, Sophia. The perfect after-dinner treat, a nice dish of Jell-O.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI hate Jell-O. If God wanted peaches suspended in midair, he would have filled them with helium.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another knock at the door. Louder. With some flair.\nCrowley squints, sitting up better with a groan. The sunglasses wound up on the coffee table some time ago and he gives both eyes a good knead before blinking again. It\u2019s darker in the room. When did that happen?\nThe knocking sounds again. This time it doesn\u2019t stop.\nHe manages to pull himself up and shuffle to the door. He reaches the handle and suddenly stops. Who\u2019s knocking anyways? It could be anyone. I could be Lucius curious about why he didn\u2019t pick up his phone. Or worse it could be someone else entirely.\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not home,\u201d a muffled voice comes from behind the door.\n\u201cHe\u2019s here. Just knock louder.\u201d\nHe knows the second voice. The knocking becomes a pound and he tugs open the door.\nA small frizzy haired woman almost falls in at the sudden lack of door under her tiny, furious knuckles. Crowley steps out of the way instantly, avoiding any possible tumbles, but she catches herself again easily.\n\u201cOh, hullo.\u201d\nCrowley blinks. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\u201cI told you yesterday!\u201d Anathema beams, pushing directly into the apartment. There\u2019s three of them total and all flooding in without a word of invitation: Anathema, in a very sharp vegan leather jacket and a deep purple maxi dress that fits her perfectly, the frizz, who\u2019s sharp and wide eyes are darting around his apartment with hardly contained judgement, and the last one, a woman almost as tall as him, with long sharp eyeliner, broad shoulders, and strong-jaw, who steps in as if no one would be stupid enough to ask her to leave.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d the tall girl asks. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve eaten too many eggs.\u201d\nCrowley stares.\n\u201cHe\u2019s hung-over.\u201d Anathema observes, narrowing her eyes critically. \u201cWhy are you hung over?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any lager?\u201d a voice calls out. The frizzy one is evaluating the contents of his fridge.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any\u2014 what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sound drunk when we talked yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cEven if you are hungover, I still think you\u2019re eating too many eggs.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Crowley levels, \u201cI\u2026 yesterday was complicated. So I\u2019m sorry if I don\u2019t remember, but\u2014\u201c\n\u201cHen night.\u201d \nCrowley instantly feels his stomach drop. \u201cOh god.\u201d\n\u201cI told you about it. Every week. And yesterday. And it\u2019s today. We\u2019re going out.\u201d\n\u201cSo strap one on skinny,\u201d the frizzy girl grins. She smiles like something that roamed plains feasting on smaller reptiles until the sky told it to stop that.\n\u201cOh christ,\u201d Crowley sighs. The realization almost slaps him in the face. \u201cBloody hell does this mean your wedding is tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cKeen this one,\u201d the tall one notes. The one in the kitchen\u2019s found a bottle of very expensive tequila under one of his counters and is rising out one of his mugs.\n\u201cOh no, no no, I should have been in the shop today. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. There\u2019s still arrangements to finalize and work to be done, and the van is coming in the morning\u2014\u201c\n\u201cCalm down, calm down,\u201d Anathema hurries. He can tell by the way her eyebrow is tilted that she\u2019s evaluating him, worried, but hiding it well. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the damn flowers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re perfectly fine.\u201d\n\u201cI should go now,\u201d he insists, \u201cI should go and make sure they\u2019re ready for the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the flowers,\u201d Anathema says, voice calm and clear. \u201cI want you to come out with us.\u201d\nCrowley looks back at her pitifully. \u201cI am hungover.\u201d\n\u201cToo many eggs.\u201d\n\u201cEnough with the fucking eggs, Radha!\u201d\n\u201cEnough yourself Chris, you\u2019re drinking fucking tequila out of a mug.\u201d\n\u201cShut up both of you,\u201d Anathema says. \u201cNow, at the risk of sounding like something off of american television: it\u2019s my wedding tomorrow. You forgot about this, even though I reminded you at least a dozen times, so no, I don\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re hung-over. I want to go out with my friends before I get married. So we\u2019re taking you out, even if we have to carry you ourselves. And that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\u201cYou tell \u2018im sarge!\u201d Chris calls from the kitchen.\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d Anathema adds half-heartedly, \u201cI\u2019ve known you long enough that I can tell you\u2019ve gotten over the worst of it. At least judging by the netflix and the fuzzy blanket.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cIs that Golden Girls?\u201d Chris grins.\nCrowley takes a deep breathe.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a kicker is he?\u201d Redha asks.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Crowley sighs, \u201cthat\u2019s fine, of course, just give me a few minutes. And please stop drinking that tequila, or at least get a proper glass.\u201d\nChris carefully lifts her pinky up from her grip, holding dead-pan eye contact all the while.\nCrowley stares back. \u201cIs it raining?\u201d\n\u201cLike god finally saw Diehard 4.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe bar isn\u2019t what he was expecting. It takes them squeezing down three flights of noisy metal stairs to get there, and when the steel door at the bottle scraps open across the concrete floor, music oozes out with a gooey warm weight that drags them in and slams the door behind them.\nCrowley notices Redha give a short salute to the bouncer as they move inside, and Chris is already bouncing her hips as she walks to the constant, low, driving beat of the music, pressing though the bodies all around. It\u2019s a small place, close and dark, but from what he can see it actually looks clean and the bartender is responsive when they slide onto the corner of the steel counter.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d\n\u201cMartini ple\u2014\u201c\n\u201cTequila.\u201d\nRedha gives Chris a look.\n\u201cMartini\u2014\u201c\n\u201cTequilllllllaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence.\n\u201cTequila.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right! One for every one!\u201d\n\u201cOh god, not me,\u201d Crowley groans.\n\u201cIgnore him. Just slide it on in front and let him warm up to the idea,\u201d Chris tells the bartender. She grins toothily at Crowley, \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty to not be drinking.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s might be one of the more disturbing things anyone has ever said to me.\u201d\n\u201cHe is very pretty,\u201d Redha agrees, giving him a good critical look over.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Anathema says. \u201dIf you inflate his ego anymore he\u2019ll have to lease a larger flat.\u201d She\u2019s slurring in a way that\u2019s just barely audible. He wonders how many drinks they had before they came to fetch him.\n\u201cHow do you all know each other any how?\u201d Crowley asks.\n\u201cShe hit me on her bike,\u201d Chris says. \u201cAh! The shots! Ready?\u201d\nAnathema tips hers down quick and elegant. The other two follow.\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 she hit you with her bike?\u201d Crowley repeats.\n\u201cShe was crossing against the light,\u201d Anathema shrugs.\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t looking where she was going!\u201d Chris insists.\n\u201cWe yelled at each other for about fifteen minutes on the street and then went to properly sort it out over drinks.\u201d\n\u201cJust been peaches since,\u201d Chris says. \u201cHey, hey - Damian Lewis, could we get another round, please and thank you?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d Crowley asks Redha.\nRedha nods in Anathema\u2019s direction, \u201cI do her taxes.\u201d\n\u201cAh, right. Okay.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Anathema asks.\nCrowley looks at her. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cSo what the hell happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Crowley tries to shrug off, \u201cjust had a long night out.\u201d\n\u201cLook man,\u201d Chris levels, \u201call day Netflix burrito blanket is not a \u2018just a long night\u2019 sort of activity.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, really,\u201d Crowley insist, \u201cI already forgot about your damned wedding, you should be having fun not concerning yourself with me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Anathema says. \u201cPoking and prodding at you is the highlight of my week.\u201d\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Redha says, \u201cyou finished a bottle of wine. Alone.\u201d\nCrowley stares. \u201cHow the hell would you know that?\u201d\n\u201cEmpty bottle in the sink. No glasses.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I washed the glasses.\u201d\n\u201cNo one drunk enough to be that hung-over washes their glasses but leaves the bottle in the sink.\u201d\nCrowley narrows his eyes at her. \u201cYou\u2019re an accountant?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a good accountant.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, so fine, maybe it wasn\u2019t a perfect night.\u201d\n\u201cDid it have anything to do with the very distressing call I received this morning from our lovely neighbor?\u201d Anathema asks.\nHis gut clenches. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe calls me first thing this morning, sounding almost as terrible as you, and tells me that he\u2019s terribly sorry but he thinks it would be for the best if he didn\u2019t come to the wedding.\u201d\n\u201cOh god.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it gets better. He says that he\u2019s already \u2018caused enough trouble\u2019, and that he\u2019s been thinking things over and it\u2019s likely for the best if he starts looking for someone to lease his space.\u201d\nCrowley lets out a groan, dropping his head into both hands.\n\u201cJesus christ, what did you do?\u201d Chris asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very good question,\u201d Anathema says.\n\u201cGod, you told him not to be that ridiculous didn\u2019t you?\u201d Crowley presses.\n\u201cI certainly did, not that it will make any difference. He sounded quite distressed, and simply insisted it was the best way to continue.\u201d\nHe wants to put his head right on the bar. It will be cool and solid, but the damn tequila shot is in the way.\n\u201cBoyfriend troubles?\u201d Redha asks.\n\u201cHey, how do you know he\u2019s gay?\u201d Chris chimes.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah point taken.\u201d\nCrowley digs two fingers into his temple and closes his eyes, trying to focus. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to tell him to stop the nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cTell who?\u201d Redha presses.\n\u201cOur neighbor,\u201d Anathema says. \u201cAnd it seems like that would mean a lot more coming from you. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cYeah what happened, A.J.?\u201d Chris grins.\n\u201cOh god, please don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not? Ana said it was your name.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a nice name. Sounds like a Fun Time.\u201d\n\u201cAzirphale,\u201d Anathema continues, \u201csaid he\u2019d managed to upset you.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it takes much,\u201d Chris snorts. \u201cAziraphale? Is that a name? For real? That\u2019s not like\u2026 a pain killer?\u201d\n\u201cThe opposite,\u201d Crowley groans. \u201cChrist, I, just\u2014 this is completely absurd. He doesn\u2019t need to skip the wedding, he doesn\u2019t need to move, for god\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what might have given him the impression that he has to?\u201d\nCrowley furrows his brows, eyes still closed. The conversation slices back across his mind in bits and pieces. God, why the hell had he ever gone up on that roof? And now here he is, surrounded by Anathema\u2019s coven, hung-over, lost, and, god. There really wasn\u2019t much left to loose is there?\n\u201cHe lied to me.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Anathema asks.\n\u201cRemember, I told you about that\u2026 thing, that happened. Back at school.\u201d\n\u201cFucking,\u201d Redha deadpans. \n\u201cRim\u2014\u201c Chris starts.\n\u201cNo! Christ, no, just, a snog, in school, some party. He acted as though he didn\u2019t remember me. You saw,\u201d Crowley tries, waving a hand in Anathema\u2019s direction.\n\u201cI watched you lament the inevitable awkwardness that he would lay at your door. That is before he came in to simply say hello like a perfectly lovely person, and didn\u2019t have a clue who you were.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes there, see\u2014\u201c Crowley points firmly. \u201cLies. He knew. Remembered the whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Anathema frowns. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure he just didn\u2019t want to start a conversation with, \u2018oh hello, remember me? We sucked face once upon a time.\u2019\u201d Chris asks.\nCrowley tries to forgot that expression instantly. \u201cNo of course not, but he knew he was being deceitful. He said as much himself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he say, exactly?\u201d Redha asks.\n\u201cHe said,\u201d the words are already sounding wrong in his head. He tries to wrangle them into an appealing shape. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want to make things awkward.\u201d The words aren\u2019t being helpful.\n\u201cGod, well, heaven save us from such sin!\u201d Anathema decries.\n\u201cJesus dude,\u201d Chris stares, \u201care you really pissed at this guy for that?\u201d\nCrowley stares down at the tequila. It\u2019s made it\u2019s way into his hand somehow. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s not going to drink it, but the glass feels slightly comforting under his fingers.\n\u201cHe got to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that now?\u201d Chris pushes.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly a\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNice person?\u201d Anathema tries.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he sighs. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t a nice person. Back then. I\u2019m not sure I was ever a nice person.\u201d\nHe can feel Anathema\u2019s eyes on him. He doesn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cJeez. Downer.\u201d Chris stares.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 that\u2019s not a surprise. At least it shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhat was surprising was him. Back then. That night. He surprised me. And I surprised myself in being so surprised. It was\u2026 different.\u201d\n\u201cMy god.\u201d Anathema looks almost pitying. \u201cYou liked him. You really liked him.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said. Surprising.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he look like?\u201d Redha asks.\n\u201c\u2018A potato wearing a nan\u2019s jumper\u2019,\u201d Anathema quotes neatly.\n\u201cMmm. Sexy,\u201d Chris notes.\n\u201cIf you liked him why was it just a one time thing?\u201d Redha asks. She\u2019s watching him very keenly now, obviously drawn in.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the really pitiful part. I tried to make it more than a one time thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh jeez,\u201d Chris sighs.\n\u201cI looked for him. Tried to get in touch. Nothing. He just\u2026 vanished.\u201d\n\u201cBummer man.\u201d\nAnathema leans back on her stool, expression considering. \u201cWasn\u2019t he\u2026 training to become a priest?\u201d\n\u201cHey-o!\u201d Chris calls. \u201cThis just got ten times more interesting!\u201d\n\u201cHe was a theology student,\u201d Crowley tries.\n\u201cWho wanted to be a priest?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe yes?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe yes.\u201d\n\u201cSo maybe it\u2019s fair to say this \u2018experience\u2019 might have rattled him slightly?\u201d\n\u201cYes, maybe, alright, but look, none of this really matters at all.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Redha asks.\n\u201cPeople were upset. Yelling was had. Drinks followed. I was hung over. Now I\u2019m not. The end.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you still like him,\u201d Redha says.\n\u201cI do. He\u2019s a nice person.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you like like him,\u201d Chris grins.\n\u201cI like Lucius,\u201d Crowley says firmly. He repeats it a few times in his head.\n\u201cOh boy, love triangle, gag me now.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Chris.\u201d\n\u201cMake me. Grab that ginger while you\u2019re at it, get us another round.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Lucius?\u201d Anathema asks carefully.\n\u201cWhat about him? We\u2019re still together. Everything\u2019s going well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing actually\u2026 happened last night?\u201d\n\u201cWhat besides me getting drunk and yelling on a roof, no nothing \u2018happened\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cLame. Can someone tell a better story?\u201d Chris asks, drumming her fingers on the table, keen eyes trying to pull the bartender in by sheer force of will.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Anathema continues.\n\u201cSo nothing!\u201d Crowley insists firmly. He eases slightly. \u201cLook, it\u2019s just like I said. I liked him. He went away. He hurt my feelings. He didn\u2019t really do anything wrong. And in the end, none of it matters. I\u2019m with someone. I\u2019m happy.\u201d He tries to ignore how forced the word sounds. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d That one sits a little better. \u201cWhat matters is no one doing anything drastic and ridiculous. So please, just try to convince him not to do anything so absurd as miss your wedding or bloody move.\u201d\n\u201cI did. Already. I don\u2019t know if it made much difference,\u201d Anathema admits.\nCrowley shakes his head. \u201cGod, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He grabs the shot and tosses it back. It burns like hell. Chris let\u2019s out a decent hoot. \u201cIt\u2019s your night. I\u2019m being far too depressing. Go ahead, all of you, get as sloshed as you like. I\u2019ll keep an eye on things.\u201d\n\u201cAwwww!\u201d Chris exclaims. \u201cOur knight in shiny sunglasses!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. So hurry up. There\u2019s only so many hours in a night.\u201d\nAnd it works. Mostly. Anathema seems hesitant to let things drop, but after Chris coaxes two shots down her throat she seems to forget all about awkward conversations and distressed bookshop keepers. \nThe night actually turns into a rather spectacular distraction, what with Chris convincing the DJ to turn the music from trance to country for at least twenty minutes before the rest of the place threatens to riot, Anathema getting drunk enough to actually attempt dancing, which is something Crowley really hopes against hope he never had to witness again, and Redha beating the bartender in armwrestling, which means, as per Chris\u2019 insistence, he has to spend the rest of the night topless. He only keeps the shirt off for half an hour because of \u2018health violations\u2019, and when Chris starts screaming \u2019TREASON\u2019 at him, Crowley decides it\u2019s probably time to make a quick exit. \nHe drops them all off at the same place, Anathema\u2019s apartment. Apparently they\u2019ve all brought their things for the trip north tomorrow. The wedding. He swears at himself again for forgetting, making a mental note to get up as early as possible to ensure the flowers are actually finished before the van gets there. God, he really is going to be exhausted after all of this.\nThey tumble out of the car all together, laughing at something his hair has done that he hasn\u2019t noticed, but they at least seemed capable of keeping each other upright. They turn to the building when suddenly Redha spins back on him, collapsing against the window.\n\u201cHey, hey hold on\u2014\u201c\nHe holds on. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all gonna be fine,\u201d she slurs.\n\u201cOh yes, I know,\u201d he indulges.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she says firmly, reaching in the window to grab his chin. She turns him far too easily, looking him firmly in the face. \u201cYou\u2019ll find it in the end. It\u2019s not up to you. He\u2019s got your red string. I can see it. \u2019S obvious. So don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nShe let\u2019s go of his jaw. Crowley\u2019s so grateful he doesn\u2019t try to understand what she\u2019s on about.\n\u201cGoodnight, pretty,\u201d she smiles.\n\u201cGood night yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe van is on time at nine the next morning. Thankfully. He\u2019s still tired, exhausted if he\u2019s honest, but the thrill of actually watching the men load the flowers in, secure them properly, and give him a wave as they head off, is giving him a second wind. It\u2019s done. Mostly. Now he just has to get there. \nHe locks up the shop neatly behind him, already dressed after changing inside. He went with the navy suit. He usually hates the color, but this one had such a sharp modern cut that it almost made it look a whole new color altogether. He checks his pockets. Car keys. Good. Phone. Good. He turns to the street, and can\u2019t help seeing the shop across the way.\nIt\u2019s dark inside, not that that\u2019s anything novel. But there\u2019s a sign hanging on the door that reads CLOSED in neat print. He can\u2019t remember ever seeing that sign before.\nHis free hand finds his phone in his pocket. He pulls it out, running a thumb tentatively over the screen. He glances at the shop once more before dialing.\n\u201cHullo?\u201d Lucius voice sounds on the end.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Crowley asks, looking away from the shop and unlocking his car.\n\u201cJust about. Look, I\u2019m sorry about this, I\u2019m terrible, I know, but that client, the one who\u2019s already looked at the four-mil twice, wanted to come back for one last look. I wouldn\u2019t have indulged them if I didn\u2019t think this was the one to close. We\u2019re just wrapping up now.\u201d\nCrowley tries to swallow a Tone. \u201cWell, we should be leaving soon. I don\u2019t want to be late and it\u2019s a long drive.\u201d Oh look at that, the Tone comes out anyways. \n\u201cI know, I know, but I am all dressed, ready to go. I promise. It won\u2019t take any more time and we can still leave when we planned. If you could just meet me here instead so we can leave right after I finish this.\u201d\nCrowley sighs. \u201cYes, alright.\u201d\n\u201cYou remember how to get here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, you showed me that time. I\u2019m leaving now. Is that alright?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, we\u2019re just wrapping up. Like I said, I think they just wanted one last look before taking the dive.\u201d\n\u201cRight, see you soon.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to drive to the flat, despite the weekend traffic in town. There was a drizzle this morning that left the road wet, but it looks to be clearing up. He\u2019s glad. He doesn\u2019t want it to rain on Anathema\u2019s day, that is if she had managed to crawl out of bed after last night. Anyways, it\u2019s not as if she wasn\u2019t asking for rain, having her nuptials in a bloody field. \nHe does the math idly in his head as he navigates the crowded stop-lights and narrow one-way streets. It will take two hours to get out of the city and to the location, it\u2019s hardly mid-morning now, so a bit of time to kill before the wedding right after noon. Maybe this would be alright after all.\nHe curls the car off the main road and onto the finely pruned street the fabled four-mil-on-the-river called home. It\u2019s one of those aggressively perfect streets, cobbles obeying the rules set out for them god knows how long ago, trees impossibly all the exact same size. He can never understand how anyone could possibly want to live on a street like this. It seems like someplace far above, an old man with too many hobbies, is turning a gear to make all the perfect people spin out and about on clockwork tracks. He couldn\u2019t stand feeling as though he was rolling down anyone else\u2019s designed path.\nHe knows it\u2019s right here somewhere. There\u2019s an open space on the right side of the street so he nabs it, trying to remember just what the house number was. \nSomething catches his eye, and all at once, ever thought of flats and numbers sweeps out of his mind in one gust.\nThere\u2019s a car parked on the street. It\u2019s on the opposite side. Maybe four car lengths down. It\u2019s a red car. A limited edition BWM. He\u2019s only ever seen one other like it.\nThings start to happen quickly. Without thinking his hand goes right to the space under the seat, grabbing what\u2019s there. He opens the car door. He doesn\u2019t walk quickly. He walks steadily. There\u2019s a dull hum behind his ears.\nHe steps towards the car. It\u2019s still a distance off, but close enough now to see there\u2019s a small scuff and dent in the front fender. And miracle of miracles, the headlights blink alive as someone unlocks the doors.\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Crowley yells.\nThe man walking towards the car glances up. He doesn\u2019t stop walking. He sees Crowley. He ignores him.\n\u201cOI! YOU!\u201d Crowley yells again.\nHe man stops this time, just at the door. \u201cAre you speaking to me?\u201d \n\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking to the asshole behind you.\u201d\nThe man looks behind him. Actually looks. When there\u2019s no one there him he turns back to Crowley with a slick smile that turns the noise in Crowley\u2019s ears from a hum to a sudden roar.\n\u201cPiss off. Alright?\u201d the man levels smoothly.\n\u201cI know you,\u201d Crowley insists. \u201cI know that car. I know that dent. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to get replacement parts for that edition quickly. I saw you. You hit a cat. A few weeks back. In that car. On my street.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d the man says. It\u2019s not really a question. His expression hasn\u2019t shifted. It\u2019s all the confirmation Crowley needs.\n\u201cSee that?\u201d Crowley asks, gesturing behind him to his own car.\nThe man follows his gesture and suddenly his expression darkens to anger. \u201cYou\u2019re the bastard\u2014 you almost ran me off the bloody road! What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cYou hit a cat. You hit a cat and you left it on the road to die.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s worth causing bloody riot on the roads of London over?\u201d the man yells.\n\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Fields, is there a problem\u2014\u201c Lucius is standing on the stoop of one of the picture perfect houses. He sees him and his expression twists with confusion. \u201cAnthony? What on earth? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d\n\u201cYou know this lunatic?\u201d the man calls back to him.\n\u201cYes, goodness, Anthony, what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s that in your hand? Is that a\u2026 tire-iron?\u201d\nCrowley ignores him, gesturing right at the man\u2019s smug expression with the thing. \u201cHe hit the cat. Seti. My cat. Our cat. He hit it and left it on the street to die.\u201d\n\u201cThis bastard chased me half across London! Almost caused half a dozen accidents on the way! It\u2019s a miracle no one died!\u201d\n\u201cThen why not stop? Ask what was wrong?\u201d\n\u201cStop for a damned mad-man!?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t stop because you knew what you did, you absolute bastard! You knew and you didn\u2019t want anyone to hold you responsible!\u201d\n\u201cMy god, I\u2019m sure this is all a misunderstanding,\u201d Lucius pushes, expression almost panicked.\n\u201cTake responsibility,\u201d Crowley continues, hardly hearing Lucius at all. \u201cTake responsibility for what you did. Now. It\u2019s the least you can bloody do.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re on about,\u201d Mr. Fields insists, eyes telling a completely different story.\n\u201cYou know exactly. Exactly!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re off your head!\u201d\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Lucius yells. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nCrowley falls silent, glaring back at Mr. Fields and silently willing his wretched smug head to spontaneously burst into flames. \n\u201cAnthony,\u201d Lucius says tersely, \u201cmay I speak to you aside for a moment?\u201d\nCrowley swallows.\n\u201cPlease?\u201d Lucius says, voice gentler this time.\nCrowley tugs his eyes from the man\u2019s regrettably-not-on-fire face and nods curtly.\n\u201cThank you, and please Mr. Fields, I am so sorry for this trouble, just give me one moment and I\u2019ll get you those signing papers.\u201d\n\u201cI do have things to get to, you know,\u201d Mr. Fields grumbles.\n\u201cI realized that, just a moment, thank you,\u201d Lucius is already across the sidewalk, grabbing Crowley\u2019s arm a little too tightly and turning him away. They get about four steps before Lucius hisses through his teeth, \u201cWhat the bloody hell do you think you\u2019re playing at?\u201d\nCrowley spins on him, wrenching his arm from his grip. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThis man is about to pay me four million dollars for this damn flat. This is why I haven\u2019t been to make half the things we ought to have done together for the past three weeks! He\u2019s ready to sign the papers now, and you come in here looking like something out of a bloody Tarantino film, half mad with rage, dressed for a wedding, wielding a damned tire-iron?\u201d\n\u201cHe hit that cat,\u201d Crowley says firmly.\n\u201cHow do you know that? How on earth do you know that with any manner certainty to justify this type of mad response. I mean, do you see yourself? Do you have any idea what you look like?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does it matter what the hell I look like? He hit that cat. And he doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t care about it at all because he has his car and he\u2019s about to have his four-mil-on-the-fucking-river, and no one is going to tell him no, and he needs to be held responsible!\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are you? Bloody Batman?\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s stunned. So stunned that he can\u2019t seem to speak and Lucius seems to take that silence as some manner of acknowledgment, because with a tired, vexed look he shakes his head. \u201cFor christ\u2019s sake darling, it\u2019s only a damned cat.\u201d\nCrowley stares back at him. No. Not at him. Past him. Through him. He turns back towards his car and starts to walk away.\nLucius calls out to his back. He ignores it. He\u2019s just about at the Royce when he stops. He turns around again and walks back towards them. \n\u201cWhat the hell else do you want?\u201d he hears Mr. Fields call.\nThe tire-iron makes an immensely satisfying sound going straight through the BMW\u2019s windshield. \nThe silence that follows is almost equally satisfying. \nCrowley looks to Lucius\u2019 horrified expression. \u201cDon\u2019t call me. Ever.\u201d\nThe walk back to the Royce feels a hundred pounds lighter.\nHis heart doesn\u2019t catch up with him until twenty minutes later, as London falls away behind the Rolls. His heart\u2019s thudding harder than he realized, pounding up and down and there\u2019s something tight in his chest, something terrified, and the worst part is he knows that the frankly criminal act sitting in the middle of the city behind him has nothing to do with that feeling.\nHe shoves his foot on the gas, ripping past every other vehicle on the road, and he doesn\u2019t slow down until the road ka-thuds into dirt under the spinning tires.\nHe parks right next to the neatly painted sign pointing the way down to \u201cNewt &amp; Anathema\u201d, which just happens to be directly into a field.\nStumbling out of the car he realizes he must look a bit of a mess. He can feel where his hair has fallen into his face. He\u2019s not sure where his sunglasses have gone. Somewhere. Lost maybe. He looks wryly at the marshy ground waiting just past the dry safety of the road, swallows, and heads in.\nThe signs are a help, and the handful of other nicely dressed individuals wandering through the field in the same general direction are a comfort. The sun has actually made it\u2019s way out, but it isn\u2019t a hot day in the end after all. The breeze makes that certain, blowing it\u2019s way across the rolling hills laces with old crumbling stone walls and the occasional patch of ancient oak trees.\nThankfully a tent rises just above the very next hill. It\u2019s just a small tent, modest even. The crowd is thickening now and he slows his pace enough to glance about at the faces, scanning them as quickly as he can, heart still thudding against his chest. All he has to do is find the right one. It will be there. It has to be. Just like it was before. \nA hand snatches his arm and he actually jumps. \u201cJesus!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry,\u201d a thoroughly apologetic voice hurries.\nNewt looks almost exhausted as Crowley must. He has a sort of stressed, thrilled, terrified expression that\u2019s just managing to hold itself together with poor packing tape and loose bits of string. \u201cOh, thank god.\u201d\nCrowley frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nNewt catches his breath. His hand\u2019s on Crowley\u2019s shoulder. Crowley can\u2019t remember Newt ever touching him before but it seems he needs something, absolutely anything to hold onto at the moment, so Crowley lets him. Even if it is rather painful.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been looking for you everywhere!\u201d\n\u201cGod, I\u2019m not that late!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, come on, you have to come on,\u201d Newt tugs at his arm firmly.\nCrowley follows him because frankly there\u2019s nothing else to do.\nNewt manages to get him behind the tent, which is sitting off the the side of a small grove of apple trees. Newt stops just around the corner of the tent, maneuvering Crowley in front of him. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s in there waiting for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Crowley asks, turning back to him. \u201cWhy do I feel like there\u2019s a stun-gun at the end of this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really, please, just, please, she made me promise to find you, and we have to start soon, and I think the officiator lost a shoe on the walk over - please, just please. Please?\u201d\nHe sounds so utterly overwhelmed that Crowley actually finds himself attempting a Manly Shoulder Pat. \u201cYes, of course, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThe pat doesn\u2019t seem to help. He\u2019s not surprised. He hasn\u2019t had much practice.\nNewt\u2019s gone as quickly as he arrived, leaving Crowley alone with the distant mulling noise of the guests, and the gentle flapping of the tent in the smooth breeze.\nHe clears his throat once, and ducks under the closest apple branches.\n\u201cUh, hullo?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d a voice yells from within. A voice that\u2019s all too familiar after last night. Chris\u2019 sharp little hand snatches him, tugging him the rest of the way in.\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous scene. It almost looks like something out of one of those absurd women\u2019s fashion spreads. Anathema is standing in the middle of the apple-trees, wedding dress spread out underneath her. Redha is leaning back in one of the folding chairs from the tent, dress flowing out over the grass with one arm slung behind her holding a can of something, and then there\u2019s Chris, hurrying in her own short bright-red number over to them with a hand full of safety pins and flowers.\n\u201cWelcome to our boudoir!\u201d Chris calls, swinging her arms out wide and proud.\n\u201cFinally!\u201d Anathema cries.\n\u201cI can\u2019t be that late!\u201d Crowley insists.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she says quickly, almost gently, \u201cyou\u2019re not, now please, can you two find that veil for me? We will have to get started soon.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course, come on,\u201d Chris tugs at Redha\u2019s arm. The tall girl gets up, winking at Crowley as they head past him and back towards the tent.\nAnd then it\u2019s just the two of them, and the wizened apple trees all around. \nAnathema smiles at him, relief all too apparent on her face. \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d\nCrowley stares back at her. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d Because she does. She really, truly does.\nAnathema\u2019s eyes brighten, which just makes it that much more striking. \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014,\u201d he tries to get his thoughts organized. It isn\u2019t really working. \u201cThere was a red car, and I am fairly certain I did something illegal. I might be sued. And I dumped Lucius.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cGood?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d she nods. She holds out her arm, bare in the summer breeze, fingers lightly extended. \u201cNow come take my arm. You\u2019re going to walk me down the damn aisle.\u201d\nCrowley stares. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. Come on, shake a leg.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t think I could have possibly heard you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic. It\u2019s just a walk.\u201d\nCrowley splutters. \u201cIt is not \u2018just a walk\u2019! It\u2019s your bloody processional!\u201d\n\u201cRight. Mine. And I want you to walk with me.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there someone better? I mean anyone, really, family?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nAnathema sighs. She really does look perfect, especially out here as the sunlight spreads across the field. Although there\u2019s no way he isn\u2019t going to give her hell later for her little group convening in the grove before securing another male sacrifice.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Anathema says, \u201csit down for a minute, we still have a little time and you look like you haven\u2019t slept in three days.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t, no thanks to you.\u201d But he takes Redha\u2019s abandoned folding chair all the same. \nThey sit there in silence, together, for a moment, the susurrus of the leaves on all sides, sounding in sequence as the breeze folds around them. There\u2019s a few birds, here and further off still. Somewhere on the other side of the tent music is starting to play, ushering the mingled voices into a lower buzz.\n\u201cThe shop was closed,\u201d Crowley says gently.\nAnathema plops down in a folding chair of her own next to him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cThere was a sign on the door. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a sign on the door.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No me neither.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking. All this time. God, I feel as though I\u2019ve been such a bloody fool.\u201d\nAnathema almost laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him. What else did you expect?\u201d\nCrowley can\u2019t help but stare at her, expression open and lost.\nAnathema smiles back and gives him a shrug.\nHe lets his head fall into his hands. \u201cOh christ.\u201d\nBehind them the music begin to shift on the breeze.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our cue. Come on now, don\u2019t want to make Newt any more stressed or he might pop a blood vessel.\u201d\n\u201cRight, right,\u201d Crowley mutters, managing to get to his feet properly. He brushes off his slacks quickly, not that it\u2019s making much of a difference to his overall appearance. \nAnathema smiles. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nHe turns to her and she steps in close, quick hands adjusting his tie. She smooths it down and then reaches up and sweeps his hair out of his face very carefully. Her hands come to rest on his shoulders, and he before he can do anything about it she props herself up on her toes and kisses his cheek. She smells like his flowers, the ones he realizes now she\u2019s been holding the whole time.\n\u201cReady?\u201d she smiles.\nHe let\u2019s out half a laugh. \u201cI should be asking you that.\u201d \n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here,\u201d she says, calm as anything.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure,\u201d Crowley smirks, \u201cthe car\u2019s just down the field, if we make a dash for it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd miss that cake? Not on your life,\u201d Anathema grins. She wraps her arm under his. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just about as perfect a ceremony as he could imagine in the end, and exactly the one she deserves. Anathema\u2019s hair tossed by the breeze that rolls across the fields, the sun brilliant and easy, sending everything into golds and yellows and clear whites, Redha and Chris standing off to one side, making face at him every now and again, the small group of guests enthusiastic and casual, the vows brief and sincere. Newt only gets too choked up to continue once. But Anthema squeezes his arm firmly and he beams back at her and making it through in the end. \nEven though he would vehemently deny it later if anyone was the ask, Crowley can\u2019t help being affected himself. Even if he manages to keep it contained to a few hard blinks and a handful of firm swallows. And diverting as the ceremony is, perhaps because of just that, he can\u2019t help his mind wandering.\nWhat is he going to do? Was he gone? Again? Things are different this time surely. He can find him, can\u2019t he? It isn\u2019t 2002 anymore. There\u2019s the damned social media and all manner of supply for people who want to stalk someone without their permission. Which is exactly why Crowley doesn\u2019t have any of those accounts. And perhaps is why Aziraphale doesn\u2019t either. Ah well, there\u2019s still phone\u2019s. He can still call him, manage to say something along the lines of: \u201cI was an idiot. Please don\u2019t disappear.\u201d That is unless he\u2019s changed his phone number. Or more likely, just doesn\u2019t pick up when Crowley calls. Which all comes back to, what on earth is he going to do?\nSomeone in the back of the crowd behind him blows their nose. Loudly. \nCrowley can\u2019t help wincing at the interruption. He tries to focus back on the ceremony again, they seem to be wrapping up and he really shouldn\u2019t be this distracted.\nBehind him the someone starts apologizing quietly and quickly to their neighbors for the interruption. \u201cGoodness, I\u2019m so sorry, so sorry, I\u2019m always such a mess at these things.\u201d\nCrowley turns instantly.\nHe\u2019s there. \nThere\u2019s no mistaking him. Absolutely, utterly, no mistaking him. \nHe\u2019s dabbing a lace-edged handkerchief under his nose. He\u2019s wearing plaid pants. Actual plaid pants. And not the sort that fit just tight enough to maybe be considered for a 1981 call-back with some modern lines to compensate. He thinks this particular type of plaid pant haven\u2019t seen the light of day since some slightly mad scotsman burst onto a gold-course in 1908, beaming at the horrorstruck faces in front of him. The outfit comes with a khaki blazer that doesn\u2019t fit quite right, with tweed elbow pads, and a bowtie. And honest to goodness bowtie, that just happens to be a plaid that\u2019s miraculously different in every possibly way from the one down below.\nCrowley doesn\u2019t stop looking at him until clapping, cheering, pulls his eyes back to the front, where Anathema\u2019s wrapped her arms around Newt, tugging him close and fast.\nCrowley\u2019s smiling. He realizes he\u2019s been smiling for a while now.\nHe doesn\u2019t hurry to him as soon as the ceremony ends. Things seem simpler suddenly, as if the world\u2019s sighed around him and he\u2019s followed it\u2019s example. He doesn\u2019t rush. There\u2019s no need. Things will turn on their own. Just like they did before. He\u2019s sure of it, with a clarity that would be shocking if it wasn\u2019t quite so comfortable. \nThe ceremony slips out into the fields and the tent as the sun sinks, deepening each and every color in it\u2019s descent. The breeze keeps it up, easing the clouds across the clear sky in rounded, lone puffs. \nThe music starts as the sun skims the distant hills, comfortable easy music. Django Reinhardt, Crowley recognizes, in some sleepy part of his brain. The sound seems so natural with laughter and cheers around it. \nThere\u2019s a glass of champagne in his fingers, delicate stem balanced carefully. He can still taste the floral tones of it on his tongue, bright and easy. He turns to glance over the fields, sunlight still tracing all the edges. There\u2019s a figure, standing on the edge of the dancers. Simply there. Off to the side. His own champagne glass in his hand, watching the rest of them, with a small, familiar smile.\nAnd there it was. The moment. Easing around him, them, all of it. Just as he knew it would. \nIt doesn\u2019t take him long to reach him. Or maybe it\u2019s taken him a lifetime. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s tipsy enough yet to make that sort of call.\n\u201cHullo.\u201d\nAziraphale turns quickly, eyes widening in surprise. \u201cOh, hello.\u201d\nCrowley frowns. Aziraphale looks nervous. Even if just sightly.\n\u201cYour shop was closed.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well, wedding, you know. The flowers look lovely by the way. Very well done.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence. Crowley takes another sip of his champagne. Somewhere a few meters away Chris shrieks out a laugh.\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s just for today,\u201d Crowley notes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Aziraphale says. Nervous. Still. Ridiculous.\n\u201cClosed. I hope you\u2019re not planning on doing anything so silly as leaving us.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, well, I couldn\u2019t just leave could I? Not with Seti as she is.\u201d\nThe cat. The bloody cat was saving his damned love life.\n\u201cRight, no of course, at least not without letting me say goodbye.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201c Aziraphale falters. He hasn\u2019t looked at him. Not properly. He seems to be having some trouble with it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure that was anything you\u2019d worry yourself over.\u201d\n\u201cI did bust up the car that hit her today with a tire-iron, so I certainly do care, at least a bit.\u201d \nAziraphale looks at him then, wide eyes stunned under those absurd glasses. \u201cGoodness. You didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Crowley sips his champagne again, \u201cI\u2019ve never committed a felony and dumped someone in under ten seconds. Rather thrilling.\u201d\nSomething under Aziraphale\u2019s eyes changes. \u201cIs it?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. Much more exciting I expect then shoving off for no good reason whatsoever. Especially when you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s acted like an ass.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a smile teasing at his bright eyes. Exactly as it always has. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go that far.\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d Crowley says firmly. \nAziraphale shakes his head. \u201cNow, look, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201c\nCrowley kisses him.\nIt\u2019s embarrassingly clumsy. He has to lean in the completely wrong way, and he\u2019s still got his champagne glass which makes this especially interesting. He just manages to actually hit his lips, albeit rather sideways, shoving Aziraphale\u2019s glasses the wrong way at the same time. And none of it, no squished frames or colliding noses, or knocked cheekbones, could possible matter less.\nIt\u2019s not a long kiss. Almost chaste really. Or might have been if it wasn\u2019t quite so hurried and lacking in poise. In fact, it\u2019s the moment just after the kiss that strikes sharp and bright. Crowley pulls back, just enough, just a breathe, and Aziraphale sighs. So quietly. So\u2026 earnestly. It\u2019s close, and still, and no one but him could have possibly heard it. But he did. It slips through him with instant vigor, pouring down his throat and pooling in a suddenly very warm region behind his chest. And all of a sudden, he can\u2019t possibly remember, how he lived for so long without feeling this whole.\nHe pulls back to himself finally, only this time, he stands a little closer. They don\u2019t speak. There\u2019s no need. There will be time for that. He can feel it even now, all that time, the time yet unspent, but so sure, that it\u2019s as though all the conversations that will ever be, all the touches yet to come, all the moments waiting just past the present, are snuggled right around their shoulders. It\u2019s as if someone snapped away the past and the present, and any nonsense that could be mistaken for time, and just left them. As they were, as they are, as they will be, standing in a field, watching a young couple dance badly, but happily, under the gathering dusk.\nIt\u2019s two more glasses of champagne before Anathema drags Crowley after her out onto the floor (if you could properly call a trodden circle of slightly damp grass a floor). She only manages to keep her hands on him for three songs, before Chris squeezes her way in, shouldering Crowley off to the side for herself.\nWhen Crowley glances back over Aziraphale\u2019s taken up Anathema himself. He can\u2019t help being surprised. He\u2019s actually a very good dancer. All simple but precise steps, perfectly in time, easing naturally around Anathema\u2019s horrific sense of rhythm.\nHe\u2019s not exactly sure how many songs go by, or how many glasses of champagne follow each of them, but somewhere along the way he realizes there was a familiar hand in his.\nCrowley can\u2019t help huffing. \u201cYou\u2019re leading?\u201d\n\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d Aziraphale asks. He maneuvers him easily from one step to the next. His hand is warm on the small of his back. Present. Comfortable.\n\u201cHow are you so good at this?\u201d Crowley asks, narrowing his eyes down at him.\n\u201cWe all have our little talents,\u201d Aziraphale hums. He\u2019s closer than when they started.\nCrowley breathes in deeply. He\u2019s close enough that there\u2019s nothing but the sunlight, spring-like smell of him. Or maybe that\u2019s just the daylight easing out of the land, and the life clinging close to the field under their feet. It\u2019s all so similar. It\u2019s hard to tell which is what. \nThe music doesn\u2019t stop, but it sounds different now. Further off than it had before. He let\u2019s Aziraphale lead. It\u2019s easy. He\u2019s so good at it. He lets his hand curl around his, adjusting, fingers slipping in between his own. His hands are different than he remembers. Crowley\u2019s own look so thin and delicate in comparison. He shifts, running his thumb against his as he imagines it carefully flicking pages, easing under Seti\u2019s chin or behind her ears. He realizes he\u2019s staring, watching their hands knit together. He looks away, but Aziraphale\u2019s much closer when he turns to him again. The hand against his back has become an arm, holding him firm and close. He can feel his chest against his, just. Crowley\u2019s eyes feel heavier suddenly, everything closer, weighted, each movement seems to overwhelm the rest of the world, and for the life of him, he can\u2019t seem to stop looking at his eyes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inn,\u201d Aziraphale says.\n\u201cMm?\u201d Crowley tries. He\u2019s not sure he heard him. Everything\u2019s gone rather blurry on the edges.\nAziraphale just smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nCrowley smiles back.\nHe\u2019s too tipsy to drive. Not drunk. Not quite. Just that lovely floaty place where things move a little slower and it seems the easiest thing in the world to smile and not stop. Although, it\u2019s altogether possibly that\u2019s due to more than just champagne.\nThe road\u2019s winding, but it\u2019s only a short walk to the inn all the same. There\u2019s a few other guests ambling along, meters ahead and meters behind. The day\u2019s faded just as it settled, easy and pleasant, with a soft breeze rustling the grasses and wildflowers on either side on the dirt road. Indigo has seeped into all things, but it\u2019s a clear night and easy enough to see the way.\nThe music from the wedding is still playing, rolling gently over the fields behind them, through the thick warm of summer air. All the other sounds of summer mingle amongst it, insects chirping and humming, the breeze ruffling the grass, the muffled voices of those ahead and behind. \nThey don\u2019t speak, foot-steps crunching the dirt road underneath. It\u2019s comfortable, natural. Every once and again their arms brush as they walk. Crowley has his jacket slung over one shoulder. He forgets when that happened, but it feels right against the night air. \nThe inn is simple, small and old. It\u2019s a stone building, and it has a settled feeling, as though it\u2019s eased into the land after all this time. The windows glow, yellow and welcoming against the dusk. When they enter it smells faintly of peat and old plaster, but there\u2019s open windows, letting the summer push it\u2019s way though, fresh and lively.\nThere\u2019s no one at the front desk, but just behind it are a number of keys with labels for the guests laid out in a row. He takes the worn metal key with his name. They don\u2019t wait for the receptionist to return.\nSecond floor. End of the hall. With each step everything between them, each breath, each brush, seems so much sharper and louder, while the rest of the world is hardly noticeable at all. \nCrowley stops in front of the egg-white wooden door. He fits the key into the lock. Aziraphale waits, and gently, he rests his head gently against Crowley\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s a simply gesture, but suddenly all the fogginess of the night and the champagne and all the rest of it seems to clear at once. Crowley\u2019s fingers turn quickly, and the door falls open. He catches Aziraphale\u2019s arm and pulls him in after him.\nAziraphale\u2019s breath goes out of him and Crowley pushes him back against the door, shutting it again behind them. He kisses him fast. This time Aziraphale\u2019s mouth is half open when he reaches it, and it\u2019s obvious now that things are going to go rather quickly. It feels as though that string wrapped around them both has knitted snug and been given one sharp tug, sending them over some ledge. And it is terrifying, terrifying how easily he opens under him, how each huff, each soft sound leaves Crowley\u2019s own breath tighter in his lungs. It\u2019s terrifying how easily Aziraphale\u2019s hands slip around his waist as Crowley drops his jacket on the floor without thinking. It\u2019s terrifying how it\u2019s the furthest thing from hard. As easy as falling. And he must be falling, because everything feels so close, so rushed, with a heavy, persistent anticipation growing in the tight space beneath his lungs.\nHe kisses almost like he remembers. Before it was clumsy, but eager. It similar, but there\u2019s something new there as well. It\u2019s open now, thoughtless. Utterly thoughtless, as if Aziraphale isn\u2019t aware of himself at all, as if he doesn\u2019t wonder and analyze and concern himself with him actions, he just, let\u2019s it happen. There\u2019s something terribly intoxicating in such a lack of consciousness. Especially when he seems so aware of causing concern or fault at any other time. But not here. Not like this. \nCrowley can\u2019t remember the last time someone lost themselves in him like that. He can\u2019t remember the last time he lost himself.\nAziraphale\u2019s hands tighten on his thin hips, pulling him closer. Crowley steps in, his dress shoes making a soft sound on the carpet underfoot. The music is just audible through the window open a few inches back by the bed. It\u2019s dark in the room, but the fairy lights from the patio outside and below shine enough to give everything in the room shades of blue in the blackness.\nCrowley pulls back, resting his forehead against Aziraphale\u2019s. He\u2019s falling faster. He knows it. The world\u2019s slipping away again, leaving nothing but the body against the door, the hands on his hips, the taste in his mouth. Spring. And champagne.\nHe looks down at him. He\u2019s not that much shorter he realizes now. Aziraphale gazes back at him, well, not at him exactly, on him. His gaze is heavy, easing over his visage with something reverent, curious, and thirsty in a way that has Crowley tensing, the warmth behind his chest, sinking, deepening. \nAziraphale let\u2019s out a little laugh, his hand rising up to slip over Crowley\u2019s cheek. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Crowley asks. His own voice sounds strange.\n\u201cI missed you. Quite a bit,\u201d Aziraphale smiles back at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the most absurd thing you\u2019ve heard?\u201d\nSomething tightens behind Crowley\u2019s throat. He wants to say so many things. It suddenly feels as if years and years of words lost and moments squandered crowd up, struggling to find a way out. But nothing finds it\u2019s way free, nothing seems quite right, and all he can seem to manage is to shake his head.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, turning his face into Aziraphale\u2019s open hand. He kisses his palm, sliding his own fingers around his. He kisses his wrist, lips parted. He kisses his knuckles. He lets the pad of his thumb run along his open lip.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Aziraphale swears. He sounds breathless, and when Crowley looks at him, tilts his head just enough, his fingers still laid against his mouth, the flush charging up Aziraphale\u2019s neck is obvious.\nAziraphale\u2019s staring at his mouth, transfixed. He moves his thumb, slowly, carefully. He pushes, just a little deeper, just until his thumb grazes Crowley\u2019s lower teeth. The hand on Crowley\u2019s hips tightens, a few fingers easing tentatively to the edge of his arse.\nCrowley\u2019s cock gives a hard pulse in his trousers and there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s hard now. He suspects he has been for sometime. But there\u2019s an urgency that\u2019s stealing around his limbs, slipping from the thumb against his lips down his throat like some tonic and setting the rest of him into slow, licking flame. He eases his tongue forward, just enough to press warm and soft against Aziraphale\u2019s thumb.\nAziraphale let\u2019s out a curious noise, so soft he almost missed it, but he doesn\u2019t miss it, and somehow that\u2019s the final shove.\nCrowley darts forward, catching his mouth again, open and greedy. Aziraphale meets him with a huff, glasses knocking against Crowley\u2019s nose, hand sliding all the way around his arse and tugging him close. Their hips meet as Crowley urges forward and the sudden feeling of Aziraphale, hard as him, right there, so close \u2014 Crowley let\u2019s out a soft, lost moan, pulling his mouth from his and easing it down his neck. Aziraphale lets his head fall backwards, hips rolling forward with a steady rhythm. Crowley\u2019s hands tighten, digging into that damned perfect hair even deeper as he lets his teeth drag just enough against the taut line of Aziraphale\u2019s throat. He can\u2019t get any lower, his collar\u2019s too tight. Crowley glances down. The bowtie. The damned bowtie. \nHe laughs aloud. He can\u2019t help it. And Aziraphale seems to see what he\u2019s getting at and let\u2019s out a laugh himself.\n\u201cGod it\u2019s so terrible,\u201d Crowley can\u2019t help snorting, his head against Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, their hips still rolling all on their own.\n\u201cIt was a bargain. Two pounds,\u201d Aziraphale grins.\n\u201cOh god, please don\u2019t ruin this,\u201d Crowley can\u2019t help grinning back, locking one thumb easily around the damn thing and tugging it free, chucking it down next to his certainly-not-two-pound jacket, crumpled on the floor.\nHis fingers make quick work of the top few buttons, but Aziraphale\u2019s pushing off the wall, attempting to shrug out of his coat. Crowley shoves it off, badly. It gets stuck around his wrist, but by then Aziraphale\u2019s got a hand around the back of his neck and is kissing him again so he let\u2019s it go. He must have gotten it off himself because soon he has a hand on Crowley\u2019s hip again, and he\u2019s pushing him back, into the room.\nCrowley toes out of his shoes, which can be rather awkward when you really really would rather not stop pressing your tongue into someone else\u2019s mouth. He makes an utter mess of it, falling backwards and letting out a shocked yelp, but there\u2019s a mattress under his back, and he catches himself on it. He props himself up on his elbows, trying to peer through the dark and his own lust-fogged mind to get a sense of things when he feels hands on his thighs. There\u2019s a noise like someone\u2019s knees hitting a carpet and then everything stutters and the world ceases to matter. \nCrowley falls back against the quilted bedspread with a thick moan, hands sliding up the sides of Aziraphale\u2019s face into his hair with tight knuckles. Aziraphale opens his mouth against the clothed line of him, pushing firm and warm, hands dragging up his thighs. Crowley\u2019s hands realize they could be getting up to far better things and take their own initiative to scramble down to his belt, tugging it open frantically. Aziraphale catches one wrist gently, and it only takes a moment for him to ease the rest of him free. Crowley just as time to catch a breath.\nAziraphale\u2019s mouth finds him and Crowley let\u2019s out an utterly embarrassing whine, long spine arching, hands grinding into the bedspread beside him. It\u2019s so warm and wet and god he can feel himself blushing. It just feels so shockingly wrong in the most blasted perfect way to know that the mouth, clumsily, eagerly working it\u2019s way down him is the same mouth that just a week ago was elegantly apologizing and smiling so quietly as it\u2019s owner pushed his glasses back on his nose.\nAnd hell, thinking about that doesn\u2019t help. He feels his hips give a kick all on their own, making Aziraphale fumble, only to pull back and ease down again with even more focus.\n\u201cGod\u2014\u201c He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s more of a mumble or a gasp, but either way Aziraphale\u2019s hands tighten on his thighs. Well one hand. The other\u2019s not there any longer, it\u2019s\u2014 \u201cgOD!\u201d Aziraphale wraps tight around him and everything gets so much more challenging. \nCrowley can feel the tension pouring into him, pooling deep and hot and pushing him far far too easily towards the edge. One of his hands locks onto Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, trying to tug at him with whatever he has left.\nAziraphale eases off of him, hand still stroking messy but persistent. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d His voice is soft, but there\u2019s something dark underneath it, something tight and rougher than before.\nCrowley swallows hard, trying to reel himself back in. He props himself up on one elbow, his other hand hurrying to open the buttons on his shirt. He shakes his head with a wry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re too good at that.\u201d\nAziraphale smiles back at him, flushes. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d He twists his grip, adjusting slightly and Crowley blinks hard, mouth falling open on it\u2019s own. \u201cJust\u2014 god just\u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Azirphale adjusts again. Grip tighter.\nCrowley groans loudly, head falling back. He can almost hear Aziraphale\u2019s soft smile. He\u2019s teasing him.\nCrowley can\u2019t help grinning. \u201cBastard.\u201d\nAziraphale does it again, twice, hand sliding firmly down with a slightly curl. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\nCrowley falls back again. Helpless. His hips grind up into his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not, God\u2014!\u201c His words feel rambling on his tongue, caught with swallowed moans and stuttered breathes. \u201cNot enough\u2014 I want, christ! I want\u2014 I want you, I want to feel you, to know, just, I\u2019ve wanted\u2014 it\u2019s not, it\u2019s more. I need- I need you. You. God, please\u2014\u201c\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s hand is off of him instantly. The same hand is behind Crowley\u2019s neck, Aziraphale\u2019s voice swearing something he doesn\u2019t hear. He pulls him up, and then he\u2019s kissing him again.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley\u2019s breathless, so breathless he\u2019s feeling a little light-headed, but he ignores that, kissing him even deeper, biting his lip without thinking. His hands scramble at Aziraphale\u2019s shirt, shucking buttons, snatching at his belt, shoving off those bloody plaid pants.\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale snatches him suddenly, and to Crowley\u2019s surprise he actually picks him up, dropping him again properly on the bed, his head against the pillows. Crowley tries to make proper sense of things, but all he seems able to process is the fact that he\u2019s somehow ended up in only his open shirt and one damn sock. He leans forward quickly to tug the stupid thing off but suddenly Aziraphale\u2019s in his lap, all skin and warmth and there\u2019s an open mouth on his collar bone and hands spreading his thighs and the blasted sock couldn\u2019t possibly matter any less. \n\n\n\n\nCrowley let\u2019s himself fall back again, the pillows under his back giving him a slightly better angle than before. Aziraphale\u2019s captivated, dedicated with sudden ferocity to his torso, easing his mouth down his collarbone, along his chest, against where his ribs press against his sides.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley swears, struggling for reason, one hand snatching towards the floor and managing to tug his pants into his grasp. He blinks hard, trying to focus as Aziraphale\u2019s hands slip under his back, easing into the muscles there.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley manages it finally, tugging the two small foil packets out of his wallet. \u201cHey- hey,\u201d he says gently. \n\n\n\n\nAziraphale looks up, and god, if he hadn\u2019t been half out of his mind over him before\u2026 \n\n\n\n\nHis hair\u2019s gone to chaos, all curls and mess. He still has his damned glasses on but they\u2019re askew on his nose. He\u2019s flushed, eyes heavy, mouth red from kissing and half open on heavy breath. Crowley can\u2019t wait any longer. He shoves one of the packets at Aziraphale and starts fumbling with the other himself.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201c Aziraphale manages, he rips the side open, lubricant oozing out onto his fingers. His face goes impossibly more red. \u201c\u2014Oh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley can feel his own cheeks heating up but he doesn\u2019t have time to talk through things. He snatches Aziraphale\u2019s wet hand and slides it between is own legs. \n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s cock jumps against his thigh and he takes the hint, easing two fingers hesitantly into him with a huffed breath. Crowley swears. Louder than he should.\n\n\n\n\nAzirphale slides tentatively. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201c he starts, words rough and worn in his throat.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley arches his hips slightly. \u201cJust, there, ah!\u2014 just do that again, and, and, bend you\u2019re fingers a little\u2014\u201d the groan drags out of him suddenly, long and heavy. Aziraphale\u2019s brow folds with absurd focus, and he does it again, exactly the same way. Crowley swears thickly, hips rolling against his hand, feeling the slick warmth, the increasingly confident strokes andgod he really, really isn\u2019t going to last long like this. He has to focus. Just for a moment. It won\u2019t take long.\n\n\n\n\nHe fumbles back for his own packet, tearing it open in his teeth and working the condom out easily. Aziraphale\u2019s watching him, but with a lazy distracted interest, attention flitting between the look on his face and the sight on his hand working him open with persistent strokes. \n\n\n\n\nCrowley gets a hand around him easily and Aziraphale let\u2019s out a soft surprised noise, hips stuttering against him. He eases the condom down, grabbing the other packet off the bedspread and emptying what\u2019s left into his palm, sliding it down Aziraphale instantly with a practiced grip.\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale can\u2019t seem to help staggering then. He lets out a muffled groan, attention shifting from his hand to his hips that eagerly ease into Crowley\u2019s hand. Crowley swallows. Focusing. He works him, once, twice. Aziraphale\u2019s breath hurries out of him, rushed and eager, one hand sliding onto Crowley\u2019s hip for something to hold to.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley swallows, easing him back. He catches the back of his neck and meets his eye. Aziraphale looks right back at him, eyes that might have seemed nerve-wracked if they weren\u2019t too heavy with lust to care. His cock slides against him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright?\u201d Aziraphale asks. Because of course he does. Of course he bloody does.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley swears, locking his knees around his thighs and tugging him closer. Aziraphale takes the hint. He eases into him. \n\n\n\n\nCrowley falls back, one gasp fluttering free, hand tight on Aziraphale\u2019s hip, encouraging. Aziraphale pushes deeper. And deeper. A breath punches out of him, hot against Crowley\u2019s throat.\n\n\n\n\nThey stay like that for a moment. He\u2019s not sure if their catching their breath or loosing it. Outside there\u2019s still the sound of the wedding, distant, and barely there.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley swallows and with one small motion he arches his hips just right. Aziraphale let\u2019s out a shocked noise. His hips do the rest on their own, easing out and back in. They can\u2019t seem to help doing it again. And again. Crowley let\u2019s the feeling wash over him, overwhelm him. He falls. Hard. And fast. His own hips working, the muscles of his stomach flexing as he brings himself up to meet him. \n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s hand catches his over his head, working him as hard as he seems to dare. He tilts slightly, adjusting his angle as he shoves back into him and Crowley\u2019s eyes flutter open, hand snatching painfully tight on Aziraphale\u2019s. \u201c\u2014God!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale huffs, speed increasing, pace going frantic and thoughtless. Crowley grits his teeth. The tension is pooling tight and low, and growing, pressing. He drives his hips up one more time, knocking Aziraphale against just the right spot and suddenly everything\u2019s tightening.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck\u2014!\u201d Aziraphale swears. Loudly.\n\n\n\n\nThat does it. The tight heat drives through him, and Crowley can feel his hips start to stagger as Aziraphale swears again against the suddenly pressure, his own orgasm starting to tug free. Crowley\u2019s lost in it already. His hips jerk and stagger, Aziraphale\u2019s hand white-tight in his. He let\u2019s out one low groan and feels the warmth against his stomach as Aziraphale crashes into him, once, twice, his name falling clumsy out of his lips as he crashes right behind him. \n\n\n\n\nIt takes more than a moment to come back to the world. The lights blink just the same outside. The music drifts easily though the window.\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale kisses his head, hands still shaking as he stands. He must have found the bathroom because when he comes back his hands are warm and still a little wet. Crowley finds it just as easily. When he returns the sheets are pulled back. He slides under them, falling back against the pillows, sex and champagne making his head hold onto a haze. \n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s hand finds his, pulling it up as he knits his fingers in between him. He holds it curiously, tilting it back and forth, watching the movement with lazy eyes. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Crowley asks. His voice sounds a little raw but mostly silky as sleep sneaks in on it.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Aziraphale murmurs.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust seems strange. It looks right like this. Funny it went so long without it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley smiles. Watching the hands himself. \u201cIt\u2019s alright now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes. I suppose it is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRed strings,\u201d Crowley says, half into the pillows.\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale glances over. \u201cWhat\u2019s that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Something Redha said. Red strings. Don\u2019t really know what she\u2019s on about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale smiles that modest and all too clever smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat sort of story?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale watches their fingers lazily. \u201cChinese traditional. A legend, two destined souls connected by a red string that cannot be seen. The string\u2019s always between them, regardless of time or circumstance. Wether it\u2019s your first life or your hundredth. The thread can tangle, but it can never be cut. And it will always bring them together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley gazes at their hands with a smile. \u201cSilly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Aziraphale teases back. He kisses his hand once. \u201cQuite.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s ten in the morning by the time they slide into Crowley\u2019s car and shut the doors behind them. They\u2019ve been up for hours, but the morning stretched with warm sheets and bright sunlight giving everything from the night before a whole new taste. Aziraphale leans against the car door, so relaxed he hardly seems to tense at all as Crowley grips the country corners, wheeling the Rolls back towards the weekend traffic of London.\n\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s happy. Stupidly happy. Aziraphale\u2019s hand finds his on the gear shift and he turns his palm, letting Aziraphale drag his fingers between his. Rather absurd, how quickly, how easily it seemed that their lives just fit together. They had hardly spoken about what would come next but it didn\u2019t seem necessary. Everything seemed as though it would just fold around them. Exactly as it was meant to.\n\n\n\n\nBy the time they pulled up the the shops Aziraphale\u2019s hand has found his thigh.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI should check in on the shop,\u201d Aziraphale says, lazily watching his own thumb trace the inseam of Crowley\u2019s trousers.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley switches off the ignition. \u201cMmm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCare to join me?\u201d Aziraphale leads.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley sighs. \u201cOh, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s smile widens.\n\n\n\n\nThey step out onto the sidewalk, too distracted by each other to notice until they\u2019re at the door that there\u2019s someone there already.\n\n\n\n\nSitting against the door is a young girl, maybe eleven or twelve years old, her brown hair tied into a simple braid behind her head. She looks up as soon as they arrive, hurrying to her feet. \u201cHello!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Aziraphale answers, voice gentle and concerned. \u201cWaiting for the shop to open? I\u2019m afraid I have to gather a few things first\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she says quickly, fumbling in the pocket of her jeans, \u201cI saw this.\u201d She pulls out a printed paper. \u2018Found Cat\u2019 reads in in crisp letters across the top. Crowley recognizes it. Aziraphale put them up weeks ago. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my cat,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you find her?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAzirphale and Crowley stare. \n\n\n\n\nCrowley\u2019s the first to recover. \u201cWell, yes.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh god!\u201d The girl looks as though she might cry, small hands tight on the paper. \u201cCould I\u2026 could I see her? I know it might not be her. Da said that with the photo I couldn\u2019t get my hopes up, that it might be another cat, and lots of cats go missing, I know, but could I see, just to check, just to be sure?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale\u2019s already hurrying with the lock. \u201cOf course, of course dear, goodness me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe door falls open and they all stumble in together. Aziraphale finds a light switch Crowley didn\u2019t know existed on the wall and flips it on. \u201cShe must be in here somewhere.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a soft sound from the desk. The girl hurries forward.\n\n\n\n\nThe cat is lying on the desk, looking just about as healthy any other. You\u2019d never know looking at her what had come before. As soon as she sees the young girl her ears perk up and she stands, giving a low long stretch before sitting up properly, eyeing her expectantly as the girl hurries towards the desk.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMitten?\u201d the girl exclaims hesitantly. She reaches out and the cat ducks under her hand, easing into her touch. \u201cOh my god, it is you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley and Aziraphale watch in shock as the girl scoops the cat off the counter, holding her close. When she turns back to them her eyes are sparkling with tears. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, you really found her!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley tries to focus. He thinks he hears Aziraphale sniff next to him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asks anxiously.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley clears his throat. \u201cWell, she, um. She was hit. By a car. Out on the street.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe girl\u2019s hand jumps to her mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Aziraphale hurries, \u201cyou can see she\u2019s fine. We took he right to the veterinarian. She\u2019s had some surgery, and she has some medicine now that I can give you. She\u2019s still a little delicate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe girl instantly shifts her grip to something less firm, but the cat couldn\u2019t seem to care less. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou saved her?\u201d she asks.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if would say that,\u201d Crowley insists.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou did though, you saved her!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just glad she\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just\u2026\u201d the girl holds onto the cat tightly, staring up at both of them. \u201cThank you. Thank you so, so much.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley blinks firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Really. I\u2019m just happy you found her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know, I know, um,\u201d she says, \u201cwould it be alright if I came back for that medicine in a little while? I want to get her home right away. Da won\u2019t believe it and James has been asking about her every day. Do you think she\u2019ll be alright?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Aziraphale manages, \u201cyes, certainly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGreat! Oh god, thank you, thank you!\u201d she hurries towards the door, car tight in her arms. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to come back,\u201d Crowley calls after her.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t, really soon, I promise. I can\u2019t wait to get you home!\u201d she says to the cat, \u201cI\u2019ll be back so soon!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAnd with that she\u2019s gone.\n\n\n\n\nCrowley gazes at the empty door. \u201cWell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale agrees.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s quite for another moment. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMittens?\u201d Crowley asks.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGoodness, I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t just me!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even have mittens.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNot one!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSeti\u2019s far better I think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, thank you for saying so, I can\u2019t say of course, she\u2019s the young girl\u2019s and that\u2019s what matters, but I did like it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s quite for another moment. Aziraphale sighs and turns to the desk, giving it a little wipe. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be rather strange without her isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Crowley says, stepping up behind him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s plenty of cats. I suppose we could always get another one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale looks at him, eyes wide for a moment before they smile. The \u2018we\u2019 hangs in the air between them, calm and comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says finally, \u201cyes, I suppose we could.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley leans against the counter, closer than before. \u201cAlthough we\u2019d have to find a new name I think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProbably for the best.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou could find one again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh no, it would be your turn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley smiles. His hand has found his again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not very good with names. Probably just name it after someone. Anathema maybe. She\u2019s done us more favors than I think we\u2019re worth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAziraphale smiles back. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d find it flattering.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCrowley grins. \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n"
