    "text": "\u00a0\nFor the first few weeks, Harry sniggers along with everyone else, looking on as Malfoy is tripped up, as his robes are spelled to stick to the floor, as the sugar bowl is charmed to fill with salt just as he\u2019s helping himself.\nHarry doesn\u2019t think twice about it as he snorts under his breath and looks away, refusing to watch on and note how Malfoy reacts.\nOr rather, doesn\u2019t react.\nMalfoy remains impassive, quickly catching himself when he stumbles over a leg stuck out across his path; quietly mends his robes when they give away at the seams and rip along one side; splutters soundlessly into his salty tea before calmly dumping it down the sink.\nHe holds his head up high, sweeping away in an infuriatingly dignified manner, and barely seems to hear the cruel snickering that follows him.\nHarry hates that Malfoy doesn\u2019t whip his wand out and threaten to hex everybody\u2019s eyeballs out of their sockets. He hates that he doesn\u2019t throw murderous glares over his narrow shoulders. He wishes Malfoy would show some semblance of the utter arsehole Harry tells himself he is.\nHarry hates that now, he has to force out a laugh as he watches Malfoy\u2019s quill spurt long jets of green ink into his pale face, the grey eyes squeezing shut, the pink lips pressing together in a grimace to avoid letting in some of the ink.\nHarry, eventually, stops joining in altogether, merely looking away or pretending to be immersed in his notes as Malfoy\u2019s hair is spelled pink, or his seat hit with Prickling Jinxes.\nIn their last term, they finally start practising in the simulated training arenas and Harry notes with grudging admiration that Malfoy is incredibly nifty; he\u2019s lightning quick on his feet, is nearly robotically calm in the face of hexes and curses thrown his way and is unbelievably skilled at casting multiple spells with a single strike of his wand.\nHead Auror Robards is generous with his praise for\u00a0Malfoy and Harry can\u2019t even bring himself to resent it. He and Malfoy rank among the top five and, unfathomably enough, he\u2019s almost as happy for\u00a0Malfoy as he is thrilled with himself.\nUntil he notices that the commendation received by Malfoy only seems to make matters worse for him. The others pick on him worse than ever and Harry finds himself covertly throwing hexes off of Malfoy\u2019s belongings while the others are waiting around for\u00a0him to set them off, quietly blocking jinxes; furtively Vanishing the vial of Babbling Potion that Trent Gibbons carries to slip into Malfoy\u2019s tea, silently replacing the notes that Carla Walters steals from Malfoy\u2019s bag.\nDuring their final exam, Harry doesn\u2019t notice when one of the numerous, charmed mannequins, dressed in flowing black robes with black masks across their inanimate faces, lifts its arm stiffly and shoots what would have been a severely painful Scalding Hex at him.\nHe drops and rolls instantly, but the scarlet jet of light heads right at him before bouncing off of a sudden Shield Charm that bubbles around him out of nowhere. Jumping up to his feet, Harry Reductos the mannequin to smithereens before he dives back down behind a low brick wall and peers over it, just in time to see a flash of platinum blond hair disappearing around one of the thick, artificial trees.\nHe wants to be furious with Malfoy \u2013 wants to yell into his stupid pointy face asking him how he dared to think that Harry needed his help, especially during their fucking final exam; which self respecting Slytherin does that?!\nInstead, he simply throws out the prank shampoo that Gibbons replaces Malfoy\u2019s shampoo with and watches everybody\u2019s disappointment with deep satisfaction when Malfoy emerges from the showers, towelling his gold hair into an artfully tousled mess,\u00a0totally unaware that he\u2019d nearly been rendered temporarily bald.\nOn the day they\u2019re all officially named Aurors, Harry is surprised to find Malfoy hanging back with the rest of their loudly celebrating peers, talking softly with Amanda West, a shy, quiet girl who\u2019d sat next to Malfoy through all their theory classes.\nHe watches as Malfoy gallantly takes Amanda\u2019s empty glass from her, walking over to the long table in the corner for a refill, ladling out two glasses of sangria that at least three of their classmates have further spiked with Ogden\u2019s.\nMalfoy has just turned around to head back over to Amanda when it happens.\nHarry is a split second too late to pull his wand out and he looks on in horror as the enormous bowl of wine rises into the air, and in the blink of an eye, shoots forward and tips its contents onto Malfoy\u2019s fair head.\nHarry hears the little gasp that escapes Malfoy as the cold liquid drenches him right through his thin white shirt, staining the material a deep crimson, trickles of it running down his white face, his eyes round with shock, mouth slightly open.\nThere\u2019s silence for three seconds before there\u2019s raucous laughter and vile hooting filling the room and Harry\u2019s ears are ringing unpleasantly, viscous fury thundering through his veins.\nTrent Gibbons dances forward with a fucking camera and approaches Malfoy who\u2019s still rooted to the spot, blinking down at the puddle of wine around his feet. He jerks back when the flash goes off in his face, his nostrils flaring, his lip curling.\nHe doesn\u2019t remember getting to his feet, but quite suddenly Harry is grabbing Gibbons by his collar, eliciting a yelp from him, and roughly dragging him backwards, jerking him around and yanking the camera out of his hand.\nHarry takes fierce pleasure in chucking the device onto the floor with a crunch of breaking lenses, and stomps on it with one booted foot until nothing remained of it but a scattered pile of mullock.\nThen he\u2019s hoisting the rat faced twat up by the collar, barely registering the muffled gasps sounding around the room, before slamming him onto the floor, the boy yelling out in pain and unmistakable fear.\n\u201cNever again will you go anywhere near him, do you understand me?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t sound like his own at all. \u201cYou will not rag him, harm him, touch him or anything that belongs to him, ever again. Do you hear me, Gibbons?\u201d\nThe mousy idiot simply holds his hands up in front of his face and nods fervently, visibly trembling.\nHarry stands there, glaring around the room in extended warning for a few seconds too long, and when he turns around, he sees a trail of wine leading to the door and a shiny loafer disappearing around it.\nHe runs.\nHarry runs out and down the corridor, wondering if Malfoy had learnt how to Apparate in and out of the Ministry wards, because\u00a0he seems to have simply disappeared.\nBut then he rounds the corner and finds Malfoy standing in front of the lifts, impatiently jabbing at the button, glancing around at Harry when he bursts into view and then quickly looking away.\nHe\u2019s still soaked and as Harry approaches him, he can see Malfoy\u2019s round nipples through his shirt, the ridges of several ribs, the shallow dip of his navel.\nThroat suddenly dry, he drags his eyes away and back upto his face, across which Malfoy is running a sleeved arm.\nHe\u2019s just opened his mouth to say something utterly inane when the lift jangles up onto their floor, grilles opening noisily, that cool voice announcing the floor.\nMalfoy steps in quickly and the grilles are about to slide shut behind him when Harry stops them and follows him inside.\nThere\u2019s five deafening beats of silence before, \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for a thank y--\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cGood. I don\u2019t need you to fucking rescue me, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need your Shield Charm either.\u201d\nMalfoy turns his head and regards him coolly. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nThe grilles clatter open and Malfoy strides out, heading straight for the Floos.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever give it back to them?\u201d\nThe question Harry had promised to never ask out loud has rung out across the deserted Atrium before he can stop himself.\nMalfoy halts in his tracks, not turning around, his back poker straight.\n\u201cIf you think, on some stupid, masochistic level, that you deserved all of that--\u201d Harry breaks off when with an angry hiss, Malfoy turns around, his eyes blazing with fury.\n\u201cDon\u2019t presume to know me on any level, Potter,\u201d he spits, and bizarrely enough, Harry is delighted to see the man looking like himself after months of aggravating passivity. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking doormat, but I\u2019m certainly nothing like that foul cretin Gibbons and his fucking posse of blithering idiots. I will not retaliate and thereby stoop to their fetid level.\u201d\nHe finishes rather abruptly, panting slightly, glaring at Harry for a few seconds before whipping around and hurrying to the nearest Floo, disappearing in a burst of viridian flames.\nThe next day, Robards, in a show of blatant favouritism that makes Harry uncomfortable in his own skin, summons Harry into his office to ask him if he, only he, Harry, specifically had any preference regarding whom he\u2019d like to be partnered with.\nHarry has blurted out Malfoy\u2019s name before Robards has finished speaking and the thickly moustachioed wizard blinks at him.\n\u201cWell, alright then.\u201d He seems a little taken aback. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d make a good team; he\u2019s terribly good at tactics and strategies and you\u2019re undeniably the best at combat and duelling.\" He gives Harry a fond, fatherly smile that makes him cringe the slightest bit.\n\u201cMalfoy is pretty darn good at duelling too,\u201d he mumbles, before being waved out with a warm chuckle.\nHarry discreetly keeps a close watch on Malfoy when Robards pairs everyone up that evening. He\u2019s expecting, if not an enraged glare, at least a sullen lip-curl thrown his way.\nBut when Robards calls out their names, Malfoy simply blinks once before stepping forward and accepting his name badge and official robes, completely ignoring Harry, his expression carefully controlled.\nHarry doesn\u2019t acknowledge his slight disappointment at the complete lack of a reaction.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTurns out Harry couldn\u2019t have picked a better partner for himself. He\u2019d felt no small amount of regret, and intense trepidation, at his split-second decision, completely sure that Malfoy and he would fuck every single case up and that he\u2019d have to amble back into Robard\u2019s office and shamelessly request to be reassigned.\nBut fuck, he and Malfoy are flawless together out in the field and Harry feels ridiculously proud of his impulsive decision.\nWhile indoors, they\u2019re... less flawless. They sit in their cramped little office with its adjacent desks, both of which seem to be perennially covered in ridiculous amounts of paper work, and they, well, bicker.\nAlmost non-stop.\nMalfoy glares holes through Harry when he\u2019s late; he hates it when Harry leaves countless mugs of tea, some half finished, all over their office; he gnashes his teeth every time Harry paces restlessly around the tiny space griping about wanting a new case, or suddenly drops into vigorous push-ups to occupy himself, loftily lecturing him on the benefits of cultivating patience; he complains loudly when Harry lags behind on his reports, claiming he would earn the reputation of a lazy lout, and not Harry.\nHarry, in turn, hates it that Malfoy doesn\u2019t let him eat at his desk; he grumbles in an incessant stream under his breath every time Malfoy bullies him into staying back late to finish his reports, resenting him even more the next day when he comes in to a smug smirk and the relieving absence of paper work; it irritates him that Malfoy is always perfectly turned out, and that he makes better tea than Harry himself does; it irks him that he finds himself admiring Malfoy\u2019s pouty mouth, long neck, and skilful fingers, and that he\u2019s started featuring in more than an acceptable number of Harry\u2019s dreams, most of them blatantly sexual in nature.\nHarry stares at Malfoy every time he thinks\u00a0he isn\u2019t aware, noting little details about him that he\u2019s sure he can\u2019t pass off as just friendly observation. The way his light hair falls into his eyes and the exact amount of time it takes Malfoy to become aware of it and push his fringe back behind his ear; the way he chews constantly on his lower lip while he makes all of those copious notes on whichever case they\u2019re working on, fastidiously covering every little detail, going over it carefully before grudgingly making Harry a copy; the soft sighs that escape him as he massages the nape of his own neck at the end of the day, grey eyes falling shut, pink mouth slightly open, the sight unfailingly leaving Harry\u2019s cock half hard.\nHarry doesn\u2019t spend too long dwelling on the fact that he apparently, quite desperately wants into Malfoy\u2019s pants. He\u2019s bent and has made his peace with that, and Malfoy is one of the most attractive men in the Ministry. It would honestly be weird if Harry didn\u2019t want into Malfoy\u2019s pants.\nIt\u2019s all good, he tells himself on repeat.\nAnd so when they\u2019re pressed up against each other and leaning around a wall, watching for any signs of the suspected perpetrator exiting\u00a0the illegal potions lab, Harry doesn\u2019t think twice before surreptitiously breathing in Malfoy\u2019s fresh, sweet scent as deeply as he can.\nThen they\u2019re busting the lab and find themselves faced with more numbers than they\u2019d anticipated and by the time Malfoy sends out a Patronus and re-enters the fray, Harry has a sprained ankle and several stinging welts all over him. He\u2019s just sent out a Body-Bind Curse flying out at random when Malfoy rams his shoulder into his chest, sending him flying back, a curse whizzing past them both with a hissing sizzle.\nHe\u2019s well aware that Malfoy merely did what any responsible partner ought to have done, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from angrily shoving Malfoy against the wall the second the Ministry medic leaves the room after patching him up later that day.\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re the only competent wizard around here, Malfoy?\u201d he snarls, leaning in a little closer than he ordinarily would have during an argument, haphazardly buttoning his shirt up over his freshly Healed chest.\n\u201cI think that curse would have melted the flesh\u00a0right off your bones had I not pushed you out of the way,\u201d Malfoy answers calmly, propping one foot up against the wall and crossing his arms, cocking an eyebrow at Harry.\n\u201cI had it under control.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, as was clearly evident,\u201d Malfoy drawls, mouth lifting into a one-sided smirk. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look like you needed my help at all, what with all that apish hobbling around you were--\u201d\nHarry cuts him off by grabbing him by his pointy chin and sucking his mouth into his own.\nMalfoy gasps softly, his hands coming up to press flat against Harry\u2019s chest, first applying gentle pressure as if to push him away, but then, a split second later, curling around the material of his half unbuttoned shirt.\nThen he actually presses into Harry, leaning up into the kiss, and Harry feels a triumphant rush not unlike the one he experienced when his hand closed around the Snitch.\nHarry coaxes the warm mouth open with his own and carefully pushes his tongue in, stroking and teasing Malfoy\u2019s tongue to join in, delighted when\u00a0he actually responds further. Malfoy\u2019s tongue twists around his own, and Harry\u2019s breath huffs out of him in an excited burst. He wraps his arms around the thin waist and pulls him even closer, Malfoy\u2019s soft moan making its way straight to his stirring cock.\nHe nips at the full lips between his own and Malfoy gasps again, immediately nibbling at Harry\u2019s lower lip, slanting his head and deepening the kiss--\n--before suddenly jerking away as if stung, breathing heavily through his mouth and staring almost accusingly at Harry, lips wet and dark, face flushed a delicate pink.\n\u201cMalf--\u201d Harry has no clue what to say which is probably why he doesn\u2019t stop Malfoy when he firmly pushes Harry away and leaves the room, Harry vaguely wondering if the mild pain potion the medic had given him came with the side effect of inducing terribly vivid hallucinations.\nOnes in which Malfoy\u2019s mouth tasted better than treacle tart and which left Harry almost delirious for more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey don\u2019t talk about it \u2013 or acknowledge it in any way at all. And Harry isn\u2019t the least bit surprised.\nWhat Harry is, is flat out obsessed with Malfoy \u2013 again.\nThe fact that he spends nearly every hour of the day right up in Malfoy\u2019s sharp, arrogantly pretty face doesn\u2019t help. Malfoy doesn\u2019t seem upset and isn\u2019t any less annoying than he ordinarily is, but he also shows no indication of wanting to talk about what had happened and Harry is afraid he might tip the scales the wrong way if he initiates The Conversation.\nSo every time they make casual physical contact, like when their fingers accidentally brush when Malfoy hands him his tea or as Harry passes over files, Malfoy barely even blinks, while Harry instantly starts mentally undressing him. It\u2019s rather maddening, really.\nAnd over two weeks later when Malfoy continues to go about his days like he hadn\u2019t clung to Harry and snogged him back rather skilfully, Harry is nearly completely out of patience. He\u2019s tightly wound up round the clock and finds himself childishly picking a fight every chance he gets only for Malfoy to nearly never take the bait; he\u2019d instead stare impassively back at him before quietly enquiring whether he\u2019d like a cuppa.\nUntil the day Harry leaps between Malfoy and a stray curse during a raid, gets hit right in the chest, and promptly passes out. He then drifts in and out of consciousness, registering nothing in particular till he hears Malfoy\u2019s angrily gritted, \u201cYou fucking dung-brained berk,\u201d right next to his ear, and a warm hand crushing his own.\nWhen he finally comes around, he\u2019s at Mungo\u2019s and Malfoy is glaring down at him looking absolutely livid, bloodless face streaked with grime, his spun gold hair endearingly messy, arms crossed tightly across his thin chest.\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you think you were doing back there?\u201d he spits and Harry grins, pushing himself up, wincing slightly as faint pulses of pain streak through his whole body.\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He tilts his head.\n\u201cIs everything a joke to you?\u201d Malfoy\u2019s expression darkens further. \u201cYou were electrocuted, Potter \u2013 they said your heart nearly stopped.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up, I\u2019m alright, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Harry coolly breaks the spell cast to monitor his heart rate.\nMalfoy takes one long step forward and smacks him up the side of his head \u2013 hard.\n\u201cOW! Fucking git--\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again!\u201d Malfoy yells into his face, jaw clenched tight, silver eyes wild. \u201cJust cast a fucking Protego! Merlin, Potter, why are you such a fucking idi--\u201d\nHarry grabs him by one arm and yanks him down, kissing him silent, and Malfoy responds instantly.\nHe responds beautifully.\nHe props one knee on the bed next to Harry, grabs him by the hair with two nimble fingered hands and kisses him hard, biting at his lips and licking into his mouth and growling these fierce little growls that makes Harry yank him forward by the hips and push up further into the kiss.\nDespite the murmurs of pain still thrumming through him, his cock starts to fill gleefully and Harry\u2019s hand, quite out of his control, slides down to firmly cup Malfoy\u2019s arse over his robes, making\u00a0him gasp out of the kiss, his eyes glazed, his mouth already swollen.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he breathes, his forehead pressed to Harry\u2019s, his fists painfully tight in Harry\u2019s hair.\nHarry simply pulls him down further and kisses him again, Malfoy yelping into his mouth as he falls half onto his lap. Crushing him to himself, holding him firmly in place, Harry takes his mouth hungrily, lapping and sucking, nipping at his tongue and lips, swallowing his little sighs and moans, brazenly rubbing circles over Malfoy\u2019s round bum.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Malfoy groans, breaking away once more, closing his eyes and pressing his arse back lightly into Harry\u2019s hand.\nJust as he\u2019s about to lean back in to snog him some more, there are voices heard from outside and Malfoy quite literally throws himself out of Harry\u2019s lap, very nearly falling onto his face, stumbling across the room unsteadily.\nHarry quickly pulls the covers over his tented groin and slips on his straightest best face while Malfoy turns to the window, leaning his hands into the sill, blinking rapidly, trembling lightly.\nHe\u2019s given a quick once over, his vitals being noted down carefully, before he\u2019s reluctantly declared fit for discharge. Malfoy silently hands him his outer robes, signs the relevant hospital documents and politely thanks the Healer.\nHe\u2019s about to sweep out of the room after the nurse when Harry stops him with a crushing grip around one wrist, slams the door shut, pins him against the wall and buries his face into the side of his neck, biting and sucking. Malfoy gasps and tips his head back, bony fingers tangling in Harry\u2019s hair as he whispers inaudible encouragement. Harry\u2019s head spins and he shivers at the feel of Malfoy\u2019s erection against his thigh, groaning a hoarse, \u201cWant to fuck you,\u201d into the hickeys he leaves on the alabaster skin.\n\u201cI- I think that can be arranged for,\u201d Malfoy breathes, his whole body lurching as Harry sucks on the fragrant spot under his ear.\nHarry Apparates them straight to his bedroom at Grimmauld Place and wastes not even a single second before roughly stripping\u00a0Malfoy down, pausing to stare in wide-eyed wonder at the stunning stretch of lean, wiry muscles and flawless, milk-white skin once he\u2019s ripped his boxers off him.\u00a0Malfoy lets himself be pushed back against the pillows, moaning and crying out as Harry touches and tastes him.\nAs prickly and difficult as he is at work, Malfoy is incredibly pliant in bed.\nHe doesn\u2019t resist when Harry pushes his thighs apart, nor when he fingers him loose. He arches up into Harry as he pushes into him and shakes violently while he\u2019s fucked, coming hard with a low, tremulous moan.\nHe\u2019s silent afterwards, panting quietly into the semi darkness for a while before sliding out of bed, gathering his clothes and slipping into the en suite.\nHarry leans back against the headboard, charms the lights on and sits there for several agitated minutes wondering if they\u2019d just fucked everything up, when Malfoy emerges, fully dressed, hair neatly in place. He\u2019s Healed the hickeys on his neck, and wears a calm, unruffled expression.\n\u201cRight,\" he walks up to the bed, pulling something out of his robe pocket, \u201cI\u2019m going to nip into work and tell Robards his most prized Auror is okay.\u201d He suddenly grins, eyes twinkling merrily and Harry instantly feels the knot in his chest unclench. \u201cYou need to take this after dinner,\u201d Malfoy adds, placing a vial of a pellucid green potion on his bedside table. \u201cYou might want to take the day off tomorrow.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Malfoy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Healer said to avoid physical strain,\" he shrugs gracefully, \u201cSomething to do with your heart rate and all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me this after sex?\u201d Harry grins, \u201cYou mean I could have died with my cock up your arse just now?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s answering blush is enough to make Harry want to risk dying all over again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMalfoy is ridiculously strict when it comes to fooling around at work. He scowls darkly every time he catches Harry staring at him; he elbows Harry away when he\u2019s pinned against various surfaces and when Harry tries to cop a feel, he slaps his hands away sharply with a growled, \u2018Control yourself, Potter, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\nHarry suspects that part of why he grabs Malfoy\u2019s arse several times every day is just so he can see those immensely amusing glares thrown at him. The other reason he is does it is, well, because Malfoy\u2019s superb arse is just there, like all the time, and to be very honest, Harry\u2019s never had much self-control.\nUnyielding as he is while at work, Malfoy is putty in Harry\u2019s hands in bed - and if that doesn\u2019t just go straight to Harry\u2019s head. The way\u00a0he simply melts into the mattress, the way his tiny, pink pucker practically opens itself up for Harry's fingers and cock, the helpless cries he muffles into the pillows or against Harry\u2019s neck \u2013 all of it is enough to keep Harry riding a near constant high.\nHarry thrills in the bruises he leaves on the white hips, the long thighs and especially the slender, graceful neck; he loves brushing his fingertips over the patches of discoloured skin the next day at work, Malfoy shuddering involuntarily before weakly pushing him away with a hoarsely murmured, \u2018Later.\u2019\nThe look in Malfoy\u2019s eyes in those moments, the naked heat in them for that fraction of a second, is nearly enough to send Harry reeling.\u00a0Malfoy is shamelessly submissive in bed but at the same time is wildly enthusiastic, giving himself up completely to Harry and readily taking everything Harry gives him, desperately begging for more.\nMost evenings, Harry takes Malfoy back to Grimmauld Place to fuck, Malfoy going willingly enough, but never staying too long. He\u2019d slowly catch his breath, let Harry roll him over for another round if he wanted to, and then set about getting dressed.\nThey don\u2019t cuddle, they don\u2019t talk about their relationship (or lack thereof) and they certainly never fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms. Malfoy never invites Harry over to his place, and never shows any interest in spending time with him outside work or outside his bedroom.\nNot for lack of trying on Harry\u2019s part; he finds himself filled with a curious thrill at the thought of waking up next to a warm, sleepy Malfoy; or at the prospect of cooking a meal together or eating straight out of take away boxes on the sofa in front of the telly.\nThey are strangely delightful, if slightly fuzzy, mental pictures and Harry doesn\u2019t really know how to go about turning them into reality. If and when he ever slung an arm around Malfoy after sex,\u00a0he would simply sigh softly, push Harry away and hurry out of bed. On the few occasions Harry suggested getting a bite to eat before heading over to his place, Malfoy invariably claimed he had other plans and would rather they get done with the sex so he can get on with them.\nAt work, Malfoy spoke of nothing but work, and looked rather baffled if ever Harry asked him personal questions.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite ice cream?\u201d Harry asks one evening as they prepare to leave work. Malfoy, halfway through Vanishing the contents of the wastepaper bin, looks almost startled.\nHe lifts an eyebrow, putting the bin back down and coming around his desk. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0\nHarry shrugs. \u201cMine\u2019s butter pecan.\u201d Malfoy simply continues to blink at him. \u201cYou want to go grab a pint somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Malfoy\u2019s reply is too quick to be genuine, \u201cI mean, I have oth--\u201d\n\u201cOther plans, yes,\" Harry rolls his eyes, \u201cTell me, what are these other plans?\u201d\u00a0\nMalfoy is instantly annoyed. \u201cHas nobody taught you not to stick your nose in other people\u2019s business?\u201d\n\u201cOther people, sure. But you\u2019re not other people; you\u2019re my partner.\u201d\nMalfoy splutters softly and his eyes bulge. \u201cI\u2019m your what?!\u201d\nHarry frowns and indicates around their shared office. \u201cWe\u2019re partners, Malfoy.\u201d Malfoy goes pink and Harry\u2019s stomach flutters at what \u2018partner\u2019 could otherwise mean.\n\u201cWhatever, Potter. Can we go fuck now?\u201d\nCock stirring at the casually presented question, Harry steps forward and flicks open Malfoy\u2019s outer robes with one hand, his breath catching audibly as Harry prowls closer.\n\u201cNot-- not here.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s breath shudders out of him as Harry leans down and licks his way up the side of his neck.\n\u201cJust lock the door, Malfoy.\u201d\nHarry hears the whoosh of an industrial strength Locking Charm and several different Silencing Charms falling into place and smiles into Malfoy\u2019s collar bones, swiftly getting\u00a0him out of his clothes.\n\u201cPotter,\" Malfoy\u2019s moan is like warm honey, and Harry bites down gently around one pebbled pink nipple, lifting him onto his desk by the waist, \u201cLet\u2019s... let\u2019s do this properly in a bed, yeah?\u201d he whispers, his hands flying up to grip Harry\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cWe always do it in a bed,\u201d Harry breathes, flattening the fine line of downy golden hair leading down from Malfoy\u2019s navel, wetting the thin strands with his tongue and pushing it flat against the flushed skin. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m rather in the mood to eat your arse out right this second.\u201d\nMalfoy gasps, bucking slightly. \u201cPotter, oh god, please,\u201d he whimpers as Harry licks the foreskin off the head of his rapidly stiffening cock, pushing the folds down gently. \u201cPotter, this is so in...inappropriate--oh!\u201d\nHis weak complaints evaporate into nothing as Harry hitches his knees up and prods the tip of his tongue into him. Cupping the underside of his knees, Harry pushes the knobbly joints onto the table on either side of his heaving chest, Malfoy\u2019s arsehole glinting moistly up at him, perfectly displayed just for him.\n\u201cBeen wanting to do this all fucking day,\u201d Harry growls shortly before sucking wetly on the pink flesh, relentlessly tickling the inside of his rim until Malfoy is screaming into the back of one hand. He licks his way easily into the unresisting, lightly quivering channel, pushing his tongue in as far as he can, opening his mouth wide. Malfoy\u2019s sweaty hands slip over the surface of the desk, smearing streaks across the wood, his neck strained as he throws his head back, his vague\u00a0cursing about how he\u2019d always known that Harry was going to be the death of him making Harry chuckle.\n\u201cTell me... What do you need, Malfoy?\u201d He licks roughly along the length of his crease, slicking it with spit.\n\u201cPlease!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cPlease what?\u201d\n\u201cGet the fuck away from me if you\u2019re not going to fuck me right this instant!\u201d Malfoy thrashes in his grip and Harry grins against his loosened hole.\n\u201cSo those are my only two options?\u201d he releases his knees and presses a thumb into Malfoy, undoing his fly with his free hand, \u201cEither fuck you, or fuck off?\u201d\nMalfoy spreads his legs wide open. \u201cCan you stop being a fucking twat for just two minutes?!\u201d he hisses.\n\u201cAlready that close, huh?\u201d Harry slicks his cock and lines himself up, laughing and jerking away when Malfoy half-heartedly throws a punch at him.\nHarry catches his hand and then looks right into his eyes, pushing past the initial resistance and then sinking into him completely. Malfoy\u2019s fingers lace themselves through his as they both groan out of synch.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s whole front is flushed right up to his pink cock, and he seems to be having trouble keeping his eyes open. \u201cFuck, yes... Potter- Potter, move, c\u2019mon.\u201d\nHarry slings both arms under his knees and begins a rough, terribly satisfying fuck, pounding into Malfoy at a quick, steady pace. His balls slap crudely against Malfoy's arse, Malfoy emitting incoherent sounds of pleasure as he wanks himself.\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Harry snaps, his hair plastered to his sweaty forehead, his breath coming out in short huffs. Malfoy whimpers pleadingly, his back bowing and straightening in repeated undulations as he bucks up into Harry\u2019s thrusts, shoulders pressing into the table as he arches, his hand not leaving his cock. \u201cMalfoy, I said stop,\u201d Harry growls, hips pausing as he firmly pulls Malfoy\u2019s hand off his cock.\nMalfoy squirms. \u201cLet go,\u201d he pants, simultaneously bucking onto Harry\u2019s cock. \u201cFucking hell - fuck me, dammit!\u201d\nHarry pulls out and Malfoy swears loudly. \u201cTurn over,\u201d Harry rasps, not waiting for Malfoy to obey before reaching down and manhandling him so he\u2019s bent over the edge of the desk, arse in the air.\nReaching for his wand, he grabs both his hands and pins them to the small of his back. \u201cIncarcerous,\u201d he murmurs, directing the silver cords until they\u2019re twisted firmly around his wrists.\n\u201cPotter, you--\u201d Malfoy\u2019s shoulders flex as he pulls experimentally at the firmly knotted ropes. \u201cYou bastard,\u201d he whimpers suddenly, his forehead thumping onto the table, hips moving as he slides his cock over the smooth surface of the desk, desperate for friction.\nHarry presses one hand over Malfoy\u2019s bound wrists and slowly plunges back into him, watching the way his cock splits open the dusky rim nestled between the shadowy cleft.\n\u201cFucking love your arse, Malfoy,\u201d he groans, immediately rutting brutally, holding him in place with a punishing grip on his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s made for cock, your arse.\u201d\nMalfoy cries out as Harry almost accidentally finds his prostate, and a few seconds later he\u2019s coming under him with a shrill, garbled sound, canting his hips out, tightening\u00a0his arse deliberately around Harry.\n\u201cYou wanker!\u201d Harry squeezes his eyes shut as the increased pressure shoves him violently over the edge. He comes in several sharp bursts into Malfoy, pulling out to spurt warmly onto the spotless globes of his arse before pushing back in and finishing with a soft grunt.\nStraightening up after a few winded seconds, Harry watches his cock slip heavily out of the sticky wet hole, thin trickles of white following it. He collects his come on two fingertips and then pushes the digits into Malfoy,\u00a0Malfoy gasping and clenching around him, whining out a soft, \u201cMorgana\u2019s tits, Potter.\u201d\nLaughing quietly, Harry fingers him with vigorous jabs, watching avidly, biting his lip as his cock twitches feebly at the incredibly erotic sight of Malfoy\u2019s loosened, dripping hole eagerly devouring his digits.\n\u201cAt least untie me now,\u201d Malfoy pleads, tugging fruitlessly against the bonds.\nHarry relents, waving one hand carelessly over the ropes, the gleaming length immediately disappearing. Malfoy pulls his arms over his head, rubbing his wrists lightly, pushing his arse up onto Harry\u2019s fingers with a soft sound when Harry reaches out to rub his come into the spheres of his bottom, pushing it into his skin.\n\u201cWhat plans do you have?\u201d Harry tries again. Malfoy rises onto tip toes, panting softly, ignoring his question completely. Harry pushes his fingers in as deep as he can and curls them downwards, Malfoy\u2019s body twitching wildly as he squeezes his prostate. \u201cMalfoy,\u201d he says, slightly threateningly, now circling the nub lazily but not touching it.\n\u201cFuck you, fuck you,\u201d Malfoy\u2019s blunt nails scrabble across the desk. Harry grazes one fingertip over the tight knot and Malfoy keens loudly, \u201cDrinks, I\u2019m going for drinks!\u201d\nHarry\u2019s fingers stop moving altogether. His gut tightens and he stares blankly at the gorgeous white mound of flesh quivering around his fingers.\nAnd, no, he doesn\u2019t want to think about why the mental picture of Malfoy smiling up at a faceless man in a bar somewhere with his eyes sparkling and hair shining bothered him so fucking much. It just fucking did.\n\u201cPotter?!\u201d Malfoy sounds beyond irritated. He shifts, Harry\u2019s fingers falling out of him as he turns around and perches on the desk like earlier, his half hard cock bobbing red and glossy against his belly as he pulls Harry forward by the collar with one hand, the other hand tugging his hand back between his legs. \u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201d he suddenly stops trying to get Harry\u2019s fingers back inside him, peering into his face with narrowed eyes, \u201cPotter, are you having a fucking stroke?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry rolls his eyes and unceremoniously shoves the two fingers back into him, making him arch back with a cry, \u201cWho\u2019re you having drinks with?\u201d\n\u201cJesus fucking Christ, shut the fuck up, you tiresome prat!\u201d Malfoy wails and Harry is snorting and pursing his lips over a grin, his fingers steadily stabbing in and out of the velvety grip of Malfoy\u2019s arse.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he murmurs, leaning forward to run his tongue up his sweat-sticky neck, his cock hardening further against Malfoy\u2019s thigh. \u201cWho\u2019re you having drinks with, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy\u00a0has his mouth slightly open, eyes fluttering shut, only the whites visible through the narrow slit, his pale, unnervingly long lashes brushing his flush stained cheeks. \u201cPotter...\u201d he pulls Harry closer almost involuntarily, \u201cPotter.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re having drinks with me?\u201d\nMalfoy clicks his tongue exasperatedly, but his mouth curves into a tiny, reluctant, truly stunning little smile as he pants. \u201cNo!\u201d He wraps his legs firmly around Harry\u2019s hips, ripping his robes and shirt open with shaky hands.\n\u201cWho then?\u201d Harry twists his fingers as he bites on a fleshy earlobe, shivering as Malfoy runs soft hands over his bare chest.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Malfoy is close; Harry can tell, \u201cFuck, Potter.\u201d\nHarry stops moving his hand and Malfoy makes a sound that\u2019s angry and plaintive all at once. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cPansy!\u201d\u00a0he bursts out fiercely, his bum rising off the table in a wild buck. \u201cPansy fucking Parkinson; you may know her as the bint who tried to sell you out to the fucking Dark Lord?!\u201d\nRelief washes over Harry in such a powerful wave that he\u2019s leaned forward and kissed Malfoy feverishly without further thought. \u201cI remember her.\u201d He pulls his fingers out to grab his erection and spear it into Malfoy in their place.\nHe fucks him just as hard the second time, firmly holding him with two handfuls of soft, fleshy arse, yanking him onto his cock even as he rams into him. Malfoy doesn\u2019t seem to be able to make any sound and simply wheezes gasps into Harry\u2019s shoulder, trying to press a line of kisses over his skin but shuddering into a loud orgasm within seconds, ending up whimpering with his mouth open against his instead.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry pants, grabbing his mouth in a hard kiss. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d he groans up at the ceiling as he comes, this time stilling with his cock as deep as it would go, coming far up inside him. \u201cChrist.\u201d\nThey pant noisily, fighting for air as their heart rates slow, Harry lazily stroking his hands over Malfoy\u2019s damp skin.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an evil fucker, you know that?\u201d Malfoy pushes at him, but keeps his legs wrapped tightly around him. He draws back to blink slowly up at him, still looking slightly stunned. \u201cAn evil fucking arsehole who uses sex to get his way.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s answering grin is the definition of \u2018shit eating\u2019 and Malfoy promptly snaps out of his dazed state to glower at him. He shoves him away, hissing as Harry and he are abruptly uncoupled, sliding off the desk and shuffling over to his carelessly scattered pile of clothes.\n\u201cYou could have just told me the first time I asked.\u201d Harry is still grinning as he leans back against the vacated desk, running his hands through his sweat dampened hair as\u00a0Malfoy steps into his trousers.\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Malfoy says grumpily. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you shit. Just you try doing that again!\u201d He shrugs his shirt on jerkily.\n\u201cHave to do whatever it takes, right?\u201d Harry sniggers, putting his clothes back together. Malfoy is frowning down at his shirt.\n\u201cYou broke off three buttons!\u201d he hisses. \u201cJesus, Potter, you\u2019re a fucking uncivilised brute!\u201d\n\u201cThere exist civilised brutes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m this close to breaking your face, Potter,\u201d Malfoy grits, the gap between the fingers he holds up negligible. Then he sighs resignedly. \u201cMight as well just go change first, I need a shower anyway...\u201d he mumbles to himself, gathering his robes up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Harry has blurted the word out before he can fully formulate a thought.\n\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d One dark blond eyebrow lifts as he straightens up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t shower.\u201d Harry reaches out, loops one finger through a belt loop and tugs, Malfoy tripping forward with a soft \u2018ummff\u2019 into his chest. \u201cGo meet Parkinson with my come still in you,\u201d he deliberately cups his arse with both hands, \u201cStill on you, soaked into your skin.\u201d\nMalfoy goes brilliantly pink even as his lips twist into a disdainful sneer. \u201cThat\u2019s--\u201d He struggles for words as Harry starts pressing kisses along his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d he eventually manages, slightly breathless.\n\u201cGo drink your drinks,\u201d Harry says softly, licking around the shell of his ear before suddenly landing a sharp smack on his arse, drawing out a lovely gasp of shock from Malfoy, his slight body jolting heavily.\nMalfoy stumbles back a step, pupils blown, breath stuttering out of him. Harry grins lewdly, presses a parting kiss to the slightly open mouth and after unlocking the door, breezes out, his mind chock full of Malfoy, but smugly convinced that\u00a0he, in turn, would be thinking about Harry\u00a0in return for the rest of his evening too.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA week later, they hit a bit of a snag in what had\u00a0until then been a relatively smooth sailing affair (no pun intended).\nHarry and Draco are enlisted to help a team of Senior Aurors on a Level One case. They\u2019re assigned with basic surveillance but they\u2019re both thrilled at simply being involved in such a high profile case. They\u2019re on stake-out for three nights in a row and on the final night, it proves to be worth the stiff necks and bags under their eyes.\nThe suspect they\u2019d been observing, believed to simply be the main mule responsible for the distribution of a highly potent hallucinogenic potion that had been on a steady rise in the market, turns out to be the actual supplier, the head of the whole operation, having used several different Polyjuice guises.\nHarry had nearly given them away when they saw the kingpin casually strolling out onto the front porch of the dilapidated shack and lighting a cigarette; he\u2019d gasped Malfoy\u2019s name and scrambled noisily for his wand, laying out a quick plan in fervent murmurs.\nRight before Malfoy cuts him short and reminds him that they didn\u2019t have the permission, the authority, to make this particular, extremely crucial arrest, causing Harry to simply stare at him as if he\u2019s sprouted a second nose, before roughly telling him that he\u2019s doing it alone if Malfoy is too much of a wuss.\nMalfoy glares before promptly grabbing him in a vice like grip and Dispparating.\nHarry is nearly blind with fury. He sits rigidly in his seat in Robards\u2019 office, paying no attention to the elaborate scheme being drawn out for the arrest, and the second he and Malfoy are dismissed with a warm, \u2018Good job, boys\u2019, he\u2019s bounding out of the chair and storming out of the room.\nMalfoy is hot on his heels, talking very fast, going on and on about protocol and regulations, attempting to follow Harry into the lift before Harry shoves him away with a growled, \u201cLeave me the fuck alone,\u201d and ignoring the slightly distraught expression on Malfoy\u2019s face.\nWhen he goes into work the next day, he doesn\u2019t go up to their office, instead idling away his time in the cafeteria, Flooing out early in the afternoon to George\u2019s shop to pay Ron a surprise visit. They chat over shepherd\u2019s pie and beer at the Leaky until Harry, silently worried he\u2019d get into trouble for taking the day off without notice or reason, decides to head back.\nHe stomps into the cramped office, not bothering to look around or spare a glance for\u00a0Malfoy as he throws himself into his chair behind his desk. And then he spots the fat yellow tub with its vivid purple lettering \u2018Fortescue\u2019s Best\u2019, sitting there under the pale blue cloud of a Stasis.\n\u201cButter pecan, right?\u201d Malfoy's voice is quiet; subdued.\nHarry finally looks up, the sudden, inexplicable flare of affection in his belly quickly diluting the anger that had been simmering there all day.\nMalfoy is looking over at him rather meekly, his usual air of aggravating self-importance all but completely missing. He bites his lip when Harry meets his gaze and then quickly looks down, pretending to go over his notes.\nHarry can hardly believe it when he realises that\u00a0he is trying to make amends; that Draco Malfoy is actually being apologetic.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry says gruffly, before clearing his throat and adding, \u201cYou want some?\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth quirks up in a small smile and Harry notes that he looks rather relieved. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he answers softly; and then, quite hesitantly, \u201cMy favourite is pistachio... Since you asked that day,\u201d he mumbles awkwardly.\nHarry Summons a spoon. \u201cGood to know.\u201d\u00a0\nMalfoy takes Harry\u2019s hand for a brief moment in the lift as they leave work that evening, not meeting his eyes and wordlessly following him to the Floo, spilling in through the fireplace at Grimmauld after Harry.\nHe still doesn\u2019t say a word as they tumble onto Harry\u2019s enormous four poster, but that by itself isn\u2019t really unusual; Malfoy preferred when they silently got right down to it.\nWhat is unusual is that Malfoy, for the first time, takes charge. He strips down to nothing and then pushes Harry\u2019s hands away, undressing him with neat, swift movements; he crawls down Harry\u2019s body in a slow, hot press of warm hands and his wet, teasing mouth; he blows Harry for ages, refusing to let him come, tirelessly working his mouth and hands over his turgid, leaking cock, lips stretched wide and dark around him, his jaw twitching with the strain.\nHarry is very nearly in tears with aching need by the time Malfoy finally straddles him, reaches behind to grip Harry\u2019s cock and slide down onto it, inch by tiny inch, until his arse rests on Harry\u2019s pelvis and his breathing is considerably quicker.\nHe whispers Harry\u2019s name on loop once he starts to move, grinding down hard, twisting his hips around in graceful, nearly hypnotic movements, his palms pressed flat over Harry\u2019s pectorals.\nHarry, having been repeatedly driven to the edge, comes in no time at all and his ferocious orgasm nearly knocks him right out. When he finally forces open his eyes, panting heavily, Malfoy is still moving frenziedly over his softened cock, his head thrown back, his thighs trembling, his cock leaking onto Harry\u2019s stomach.\nHarry grabs him by the waist, flips them over and rolls Malfoy onto his knees, pulling his arse open and eating him into climax, shoving two, then three, fingers into him,\u00a0Malfoy sobbing helplessly into his arms, gripping Harry\u2019s tongue and fingers, bucking into his mouth.\nHe\u2019s silent even as Harry stretches out beside him and throws an arm across his waist, staying in bed for a lot longer than he usually did before gingerly sitting up and swinging his legs over the edge.\n\u201cD\u2019you like Chinese?\u201d Harry asks suddenly, reaching out and running a finger lightly down his spine. Malfoy shivers at the touch, looking back over his shoulder with a bewildered expression.\nHe frowns. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cChinese food, Malfoy,\u201d Harry intones very seriously, \u201cWould you like some?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Malfoy doesn\u2019t seem inclined to lie back down next to Harry, but he doesn\u2019t show any signs of proceeding to get dressed either.\n\u201c\u2019cause we\u2019re human and we require sustenance,\u201d Harry deadpans. \u201cAnd sustenance in the form of crispy pork belly and lo mein sounds fucking fantastic right now,\u201d he adds, patting his belly.\nMalfoy, to Harry\u2019s total shock (and utter delight), breaks into a sudden, warm grin that crinkles his eyes up at the corners and rounds out some of his pointy angles.\n\u201cSold,\u201d he declares, fishing something up from the floor before throwing Harry\u2019s pants at his head. \u201cMove it, Potter.\u201d\nHarry had had no idea he could spend a whole evening simply watching Malfoy eating Chinese. He watches as\u00a0Malfoy tucks in, eating in quick, neat bites, licking the grease off his shiny lips with sharp flicks of his pink tongue. He lets him talk as they eat, listening to him narrate what he\u2019d learnt about the arrest, and rests his chin on one hand, staring unblinkingly at him.\nThey stroll leisurely towards no particular destination afterwards, and when it starts to rain, Harry is fully expecting Malfoy to curse irascibly and whip out his wand to cast an Impervius right there in Muggle London.\nInstead,\u00a0Malfoy pauses in his tracks and blinks up as little drops catch on his lashes, unexpectedly letting out a soft chuckle. Harry\u2019s answering laugh is one of pure surprise. He grabs Malfoy\u2019s hand and they run, both of them drenched by the time they leave the bustling sidewalk behind. Harry draws them under the dark stoop of an old building, pulls Malfoy towards him and kisses him deeply.\nHis kiss is returned at once and just as passionately, Malfoy throwing his arms around his neck and opening his mouth with a soft sound of approval. Harry cradles his damp, warm face and kisses him hungrily, realising for the first time in all these months that he doesn\u2019t kiss Malfoy just as much as he would really like to. Despite the way they\u2019d started out, with those heated, stolen kisses, they didn\u2019t really spend much time kissing before, while or after they fucked.\nAnd Merlin, Harry loves kissing Malfoy. He loves the faint whines and mellow sighs that are breathed into his mouth; he loves the soft fingers that card through and stroke his hair, the firm press of Malfoy\u2019s long body against his own.\nHe and Malfoy become aware, nearly at the same exact moment, that they\u2019ve been kissing for several long minutes, slow, intense and almost painfully sweet, and that neither is trying to lead it to sex.\nMalfoy pulls back with a slight jerk, quickly brushing his fingertips across his swollen mouth before looking away, still standing pressed into Harry and shivering lightly. Harry pants quietly into\u00a0his\u00a0hair for a few seconds before he speaks softly. \u201cGo take a hot shower; you\u2019ll catch your death otherwise.\u201d\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth twitches and he takes a step back, eyes twinkling as he rolls them. \u201cDon\u2019t baby me around, Potter.\u201d Then he smiles at his shoes. \u201c\u2019night.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s murmured reply is lost in the rush of rain against asphalt as he watches Malfoy Disapparate.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe following month, Robards summons Harry to his office again.\n\u201cMACUSA*--\u201d he starts without preface, \u201c--has requested assistance \u2013 again.\u201d He looks supremely smug and obscenely gleeful. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking for a competent young Auror to be transferred out there for a few months \u2013 maybe longer \u2013 to help out with a case similar to the one you and Malfoy helped crack. They can\u2019t do anything without us holding their finger, can they?\u201d he adds with a chortle.\nHarry isn\u2019t happy with where he believes the conversation is headed.\n\u201cAnd imagine their faces when I tell them I\u2019m sending Harry fucking Potter.\u201d He slaps a hand onto his desktop, guffawing loudly. \u201cThat is, if you\u2019d like to go,\u201d he suddenly clarifies, and Harry\u2019s stomach unclenches a little. \u201cI\u2019m sure most of you Juniors would love the opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWould it be...just me?\u201d he has to ask the most important question first, \u201cOr would Malfoy and I both be--\u201d\n\u201cJust you,\u201d Robards waves a hand, \u201cWhy would they need two agents when they have Harry Potter?\u201d He looks genuinely confused.\n\u201cCan I sleep on it?\u201d Harry asks quickly, before Robards sends him off right then and there.\n\u201cSure, sure,\" his boss shoos him out, nodding vigorously, \u201cLet me know by the end of the week. Make \u2018em wait a bit longer,\u201d he adds with a grin.\nThe thought of being away from Malfoy and his haughty scowls, his endless nagging, his sharp tongue; his warm flesh, his hot mouth, his perfect face \u2013 Harry wants to turn right back around and assure Robards that nope, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\nHe isn\u2019t even going to wait until the end of the week to tell him that. He\u2019d just go over tomorrow and say he isn\u2019t keen.\nFuck being professional and eager to learn.\nHe responds with a noncommittal shrug when Malfoy asks him why Robards called for him and for once, thankfully,\u00a0Malfoy doesn\u2019t push it, burying his nose back into the report Harry had filled out, probably correcting every alternate word in it.\nLater though, as they\u2019re lounging in Harry\u2019s bed in their boxer shorts, eating sticky rice and egg rolls, Malfoy handling his chopsticks with enviable dexterity, Harry finds himself blurting it out without further thought.\n\u201cRobards asked if I\u2019d like to be transferred to MACUSA for a few months.\" He pokes his chopsticks into his rice, keeping his eyes on his dinner, holding his breath as he waits for a reply.\nHe doesn\u2019t get one and eventually looks around to find Malfoy staring at him in silence, egg roll held halfway up to his mouth.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put in a request, apparently,\u201d Harry lifts a shoulder, \u201cRobards probably thought I\u2019d like the opportunity, you know, for the exposure or whatever,\u201d Harry says, rolling his eyes, waving his chopsticks around.\nMalfoy still doesn\u2019t say a word and Harry spends the next several seconds having a mini aneurysm.\n\u201cYou should go,\u201d comes the cool reply finally, and then Harry feels like his heart has stopped altogether, \u201cIt will be good exposure.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s mouth is slightly open as he watches Malfoy calmly take a bite of his egg roll, his stomach churning with disappointment.\n\u201cI was going to pass up the offer,\u201d he says quietly, placing his box of rice on his bedside table. \u201cI\u2019m not really keen.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Malfoy doesn\u2019t look at him as he manoeuvres a clump of rice into his mouth, \u201cSounds like a brilliant opportunity.\" He chews in silence for a few seconds before adding, \u201cI\u2019d have gone.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go?\u201d Malfoy still isn\u2019t looking around at him and Harry feels the anger beginning to creep in.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he answers quietly, looking down at his hands, valiantly trying to keep his temper at bay, knowing he\u2019d end up saying something completely stupid and meaningless if it got the better of him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you have some specific reason.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s tone is light \u2013 careful. Harry feels like Malfoy is waiting for him to say something in particular and so decides to give him the truth.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like the thought of us...not being together for that long.\u201d\nMalfoy is silent once more, and each second that goes by without him saying something in return rips into Harry\u2019s gut.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he finally says, putting away his dinner as well, \u201cthis is your career we\u2019re discussing. Don\u2019t you feel like you ought to put it before... Don\u2019t you think it ought to come before...\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t complete the thought, and Harry\u2019s nostrils flare in irritation.\n\u201cWhat, Malfoy?\u201d he clenches his hands, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I should put us first?\u201d\nMalfoy looks at him now; actually looks at him, and his face is devoid of any emotion.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he says softly, and Harry thinks he can detect something in his voice. Was it...pity? \u201cThere is no \u2018us\u2019.\" He tilts his head slightly and yes, Harry is certain he sees pity in his eyes.\nHeartless bastard.\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s hands tremble in his lap and his stomach is like lead; and he feels nothing but pure, all-consuming rage.\n\u201cI see,\u201d he repeats. \u201cThanks for the information,\u201d he says nastily and notes the exact moment Malfoy\u2019s own temper kicks in.\n\u201cWhat, Potter, what did you think we were?\u201d he asks in a low voice. \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t believe we\u2019re boyfriends?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Harry says, forcefully airy. \u201cWe just shag.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cYou disgust me.\u201d\nMalfoy flies out of bed and starts to dress before Harry can draw in his next breath.\n\u201cI disgust you?!\u201d he spits. \u201cWhy, Potter? What the fuck is it about me that disgusts you?!\u201d\n\u201cDid you honestly think we\u2019d just \u2018casually fuck\u2019 for the rest of our lives?\u201d Harry gets to his feet as well, \u201cOr did you plan to eventually find someone else and dispose of me?\u201d Harry realises just how incredibly vulnerable he\u2019s making himself sound.\nMalfoy lets out a mirthless, derisive laugh. \u201cAre you honestly going to play the victim here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing the fucking victim,\u201d Harry grits. \u201cI just assumed you\u2019re a better person than you apparently are; totally my fault there.\u201d\nMalfoy buttons up his shirt in silence before looking Harry dead in the eye. \u201cDid you hope that this would eventually turn romantic?\u201d\nDespite his wounded ego, Harry goes for the truth again. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d He bundles up his robes and turns to leave.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a fucking coward,\u201d Harry retorts, and Malfoy pauses. \u201cWhat exactly are you afraid of, here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d Malfoy hisses, whipping around. \u201cYou think everyone except you is a coward?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about everyone; you certainly are one though.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Potter,\u201d Malfoy\u2019s teeth are bared and he looks like he\u2019s angling for his wand, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between cowardice and pragmatism.\u201d\nHarry laughs humourlessly. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re being? Pragmatic?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and I invite you to do the same. It\u2019ll save us all this drama.\u201d\n\u201cDrama?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes bulge slightly, before something just snaps, \u201cFuck off. Just fuck off, alright?\u201d\n\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Malfoy immediately turns back around and sweeps out.\n\u201cOh, and thanks for helping me make my decision. I guess I\u2019m going to the States after all.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck, arsehole.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRobards is exceedingly pleased and immediately sits Harry down to brief him on the case he\u2019d be helping out with. Harry is relieved when, two interminable hours later, he\u2019s handed the files to go through in his own time because he\u2019s barely heard a word Robards has said to him.\nHe\u2019s barely slept, is exhausted and irritable and wants to yell some more at Malfoy, still holding on to hope that he\u00a0would ask Harry not to go.\nWhen he enters their office however, it\u2019s Carla Walters who greets him with a high pitched, \u201cHey there, partner!\u201d\nFrozen in place, Harry stares at her in blank silence until the woman shifts uncomfortably in her (Malfoy\u2019s) seat, visibly unnerved.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Harry says quickly, moving over to his desk. \u201cWhat...What are you doing here?\u201d He aims at sounding airily curious even as his heart sinks to rest somewhere in his boots. Malfoy must have come in early and requested a new partner.\nShe looks slightly hurt that he isn\u2019t already aware of this. \u201cI- I\u2019ve been reassigned.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Right. Yeah, of course; sorry. I\u2019m only just getting in here today.\u201d Harry rummages noisily in his drawer, looking for nothing, ignoring the distress spreading out steadily from the pit of his stomach. \u201cWho\u2019s Malfoy with now, by the way?\u201d\n\u201cAmanda West.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry is oddly relieved \u2013 Malfoy likes Amanda.\nCarla seems almost nervous to be working alongside him and that in turn makes Harry edgy. He spends the day biting down the surges of despondency that regularly creep up and then feels a sick sort of glee that he\u2019d be getting the fuck out of here in three days.\nHe doesn\u2019t run into Malfoy; not until the day he\u2019s actually leaving.\nHe\u2019s trying to put together a cup of tea just like the one he\u2019d watched Malfoy make a hundred times, when\u00a0Malfoy himself walks into the break room, freezing in place at the sight of Harry already there. They stare blankly at each other, Harry\u2019s heart thudding loudly against his ribcage as he stares at the pale, wide eyed face, before Malfoy turns away and stiffly reaches for a mug.\nHarry desperately wants to say something - to ask him if he knows that he\u2019s leaving soon, whether he genuinely doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Instead he stirs sugar into his tea and discreetly sniffs at the faint waves of Malfoy\u2019s fruity scent wafting over.\n\u201cAh, Potter!\u201d\nHarry jumps and looks around as Senior Auror Watson breezes in and slaps him on the back. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cYou all packed?\u201d the balding man asks, ripping open a fresh packet of biscuits.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time\u2019s your Portkey?\u201d\nHarry shifts awkwardly on his feet, one eye on Malfoy\u2019s stiff back. \u201cSix,\u201d he mumbles under his breath.\n\u201cWell, good luck, son,\u201d he squeezes Harry\u2019s shoulder, \u201cShow \u2018em how it\u2019s done.\" He raises a fist as he walks out.\nHarry picks up his mug, waits two beats, and then follows him out in silence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmanda West is extremely content with her life.\nShe has a wonderful fianc\u00e9 who loves her very much, their pair of incorrigible Kneazles, a rather decent flat and a job that she, on most days, likes.\nAuror training had been as trying as she\u2019d known it would be. Still, she\u2019d got through it and actually made Auror because she\u2019d promised herself when her father had died in the War that that she\u2019d honour his memory by following in his footsteps; even if she didn\u2019t spend too many years in the corps afterwards.\nShe didn\u2019t complain when her cases were dull \u2013 she wasn\u2019t particularly fond of drama. She basically just looked forward to filing her daily reports and going home to Carl, old pyjamas, wine and her hyperactive little fuzz buckets.\nAnd so, although she was adequately fond of him, she was a little wary when Draco Malfoy was assigned as her new partner.\nThat boy has drama written all over him.\nShe knows about him and Potter \u2013 honestly, one had to be blind not to notice how they were around one another, they way their gazes lingered on each other; and apparently everyone else in the department is blind.\nDraco walks in now, clutching his mug in a white knuckled grip, his eyes dead, face completely colourless.\nShe sighs \u2013 Potter is leaving today. Of course he looks like he\u2019s about to burst into tears.\n\u201cYou alright there?\u201d she asks carefully, watching the shutters come down over his handsome face, noting the false, overly bright smile.\n\u201c\u2019course,\u201d he answers.\n\u201cHave you said goodbye yet?\u201d she asks bluntly.\nHe looks over at her, nostrils flaring. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe smiles, and it\u2019s not smug or teasing \u2013 she\u2019s too decent for that. \u201cHave you said goodbye to your boyfriend yet?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my-- we\u2019re not talking,\u201d he mumbles, biting his lip.\n\u201cIs that why you asked to be reassigned? Because he agreed to go?\u201d\n\u201cI told him to go,\u201d he replies sharply, not meeting her gaze. \u201cThe idiot wanted to pass it up.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she straightens her glasses, and then despite knowing better, presses further, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he sneers, \u201cAt least I am concerned about his career. He certainly isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I meant--\u201d Amanda purses her lips for a second, \u201cWhy\u2019d Potter plan to pass it up?\u201d\nDraco opens his mouth, makes an odd, croaking sound, and then abruptly presses his lips together tightly. Then he begins opening random files, feverishly turning pages, his expression slightly crazed.\n\u201cIt would never work, alright?!\u201d he suddenly snaps and Amanda jumps in her seat. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking Potter. And me. It would never fucking work!\u201d He slaps his hand impatiently on the desk, glaring over at her as if she\u2019d been nagging him all along. \u201cIt would never work,\u201d he repeats more calmly. \u201cAlright? It would never work... Right?\u201d He blinks at her, looking anguished.\n\u201cI mean... It might?\u201d she says carefully, shrugging lightly. \u201cThey say opposites att--\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he spits and she falls silent again. He picks up another file and flips through it so roughly that she hears several sheets tearing. \u201cI mean, we were just fucking! It was just sex. Who chooses casual sex over going out and learning something new?! ...Getting exposure, broadening your skill range,\u201d he adds under his breath, throwing the file aside and accidentally knocking his tea over with it. He stares at the mess in horror. \u201cIt was just sex,\u201d he tells her weakly, looking up again.\nAmanda doesn\u2019t say anything, simply looking over at him in silence, fingers laced in front of her.\n\u201cHe wanted to stay back for... you?\u201d she eventually asks softly.\nDraco lets out a dry sob as he clumsily mops up the spilled tea instead of using magic, his expression pained. \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking idiot,\u201d he says to the pile of soaked tissues before trashing them. \u201cA complete... I don\u2019t even like him,\u201d he says harshly. \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He was always one of them; always laughing along with the rest of them.\u201d\nAmanda makes a face. \u201cMaybe at first; but he basically made Gibbons shit himself that time when--\u201d\n\u201cPotter likes creating a scene,\u201d Draco waves a dismissive hand, \u201cHe likes reminding everyone that he\u2019s the Saviour and all.\u201d\nLicking her lips slowly, Amanda tries again. \u201cNo, even before that; he was always looking out for you... He did it for months before that last incident.\u201d\nDraco frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cHe blocked hexes, found and got rid of prank items, threw off jinxes... that sort of thing,\u201d she shrugs, \u201cI doubt the others were even aware.\u201d\nHe simply stares, swallowing hard and looking away, shaking his head slowly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s leaving. He has to go.\u201d\n\u201cOh...\u201d\n\u201cHe has to go,\u201d he repeats more vehemently. \u201cIt\u2019s too late now-- I can\u2019t-- He has to go.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even like him,\u201d he repeats, his lip curled derisively. \u201cI hate him, really.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she says quietly.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he whispers miserably, staring into his hands.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Amanda says firmly, \u201cGet the fuck up. His Portkey doesn\u2019t leave for another hour. Go.\u201d\nDraco just sits there trembling lightly, his hands clenched now on the desk. \u201cI can\u2019t just--\u201d he starts weakly.\n\u201cI said go,\u201d she repeats, a little louder this time, and Draco jumps up as if he\u2019d been hit with a Stinging Hex.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say--\u201d\n\u201cJust go find him; you\u2019ll know when you see him.\u201d\nDraco hurries out, looking terrified, slamming the door after himself.\nA second later he pops his head back in. \u201cI-- Thanks,\u201d he says awkwardly and Amanda sighs, rolling her eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you drama queen.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry checks his watch \u2013 he\u2019s got plenty of time before the Portkey.\nHe\u2019d left way too early simply because he couldn\u2019t stand being at the Ministry any longer; he\u2019d gotten tired of fighting the temptation to go scream at Malfoy again. And then snog him a little.\nAnd then not go.\nHe nods as he\u2019s handed his ticket and then rolls his trunk behind him, heading over to security to get his luggage scanned.\nHe\u2019s only just turned towards the waiting lounge when he hears it; that voice. And his heart nearly leaps up his throat and out his mouth.\n\u201cGet out of my way you daft bint, didn\u2019t you hear me when I said I\u2019m an Auror?!\u201d\nHarry whips around, almost falling over backwards at the sight of the blond vision elbowing his way past the security witch.\n\u201cSir,\u201d she calls out desperately, and Harry feels slightly sorry for the obviously newly recruited witch. \u201cSir, please, you need a tick--\u201d\nShe drifts off as Malfoy simply stalks past with his nose in the air, making a beeline for Harry who\u2019s rooted to the spot with his mouth hanging open.\nMalfoy strides right up to him and then just stands there, jaw clenched, round grey eyes boring into his. He looks slightly frantic, but his mouth is held in that characteristic, stubborn moue.\nSuddenly he ducks, grabs Harry\u2019s trunk and makes off with it, marching away purposefully.\n\u201cEr...\u201d Harry slowly follows him, \u201cMalfoy? I\u2019m kind of going to need that back...?\u201d\n\u201cNo; no you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going with that?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting out of here, I hate Portkey stations!\u201d\n\u201cBut why are you taking my case with you?!\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re not going!\u201d he whips around so abruptly that Harry walks right into him, sending the trunk flying before hastily steadying\u00a0Malfoy with a firm grip on his arms, \u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d he repeats, voice slightly higher than normal.\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Harry asks, and he can feel a massive grin fighting to take over, his whole body thrumming with elation, his heart blooming to twice its size.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought you said--\u201d\n\u201cSince when have you started listening to me?!\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice rises, his lip trembling slightly as he shoves Harry roughly, \u201cYou never listen otherwise!\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry yanks him forward by the collar, \u201cGet to the point,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cThe point is, I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d he blurts out, fighting Harry\u2019s grip on his collar for a second before reaching forward and fisting his hands in Harry\u2019s robes. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking hate you, alright?!\u201d he yells, shaking Harry roughly.\nHarry bursts out laughing. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll come to saying the real thing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat real thing?\u201d Malfoy asks sullenly, and then Harry kisses him.\nRight there, in front of dozens of people openly gawking at them, he kisses Malfoy.\nMalfoy\u00a0lets out a little sob and then presses into him, wrapping his arms around him and leaning bodily into the kiss.\nHarry gently runs his fingers over his face as he pulls back, moving his mouth to Malfoy\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible, you know that?\u201d\nMalfoy pushes his face into is neck, pressing tiny kisses. \u201cOh, because you\u2019re such a walk in the park?\u201d\u00a0\nHarry grins, burying his face in his fragrant hair. \u201cIf I get fired for this, it\u2019ll be on you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve killed a Dark Lord; nobody will dare to fire you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy.\u201d\nThey kiss again, licking into each others\u2019 mouths, fiercely clutching at each other, finally breaking away wetly. \u201cYou going to carry that for me?\u201d Harry indicates to his poor trunk lying upside down.\n\u201cLike fuck I am,\u201d Malfoy huffs snootily before turning around and sweeping away, pausing to add over his shoulder, \u201cWell, come on then. We need to go get you in trouble.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLater that evening, some cynical little part of Harry refuses to believe that he\u2019s actually got Malfoy under him again, naked, writhing and wonderfully clingy.\nHe kisses him slowly, doing nothing but that for a very long time, soaking in all of his little breathy sounds. When he draws away, Malfoy tightens his grip on him, pulling him back down, nudging his chin up with his nose, nibbling on his neck.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d he whispers, dropping kisses onto the angular face, slowly making his way lower. The slender body arches up into his mouth, Malfoy letting out little cries of pleasure as Harry runs his tongue over his peaked nipples, his ticklish sides and his gorgeous, hard cock.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Malfoy bends his legs, digging his feet into the bed as he presses against his touch, \u201cYes, yes...\u201d he breathes as Harry inches lower, moistening his rim with the very tip of his tongue.\nHarry slicks his fingers up, pushes one, then another in quick succession, before idly teasing his prostate with feather light brushes. Malfoy cries out again and bucks up into him, begging in a way that makes Harry\u2019s chest tighten.\nHe worms in two more digits and scissors them the best he can, feeling the silken walls constrict and throb around him, and he has to bite down on his lip hard at the indescribable feel of it.\n\u201cJust fuck me already,\u201d Malfoy keens, hips lifting off the bed, fingers curled around handfuls of the covers beneath them. \u201cPotter, for Merlin\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really pretty,\u201d Harry blabs out unexpectedly, surprising even himself. Malfoy stops squirming at once, opening his eyes and fixing Harry with a slightly incredulous glare as he pants loudly.\n\u201cI\u2019m really what?!\u201d\nHarry gently pulls his fingers out, lines his cock up and slowly pushes into him, Malfoy\u2019s expression softening into one of blissful ecstasy, his breath huffing out of him warmly, his hands automatically pushing into Harry\u2019s hair as he leans over him.\n\u201cPretty,\u201d Harry says shakily, pressing his mouth to Malfoy\u2019s cheek. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, I\u2019m ruggedly handsome,\u201d Malfoy gasps as Harry finds his prostate on his very first thrust, Harry sniggering atop him, \u201cPotter,\u201d he groans, his ankles locking against Harry\u2019s back.\n\u201cYou fucking drive me crazy, you know that?\u201d Harry breathes into his neck, licking broad stripes, hips snapping forward in firm, hard strokes.\n\u201cIn a good way?\u201d Malfoy asks hopefully, pulling him even closer.\n\u201cIn the best way.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t ask to be transferred to MACUSA?\u201d he beseeches, nails digging into Harry\u2019s back.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, you fucking tosser,\u201d Harry promises tenderly, bumping their noses together.\nAnd then Harry kisses him again, this time not stopping until they\u2019re both seconds away from climax and Malfoy is moaning desperately with his head thrown back.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he whimpers, as Harry grabs and presses his hands above his head, thrusting even deeper. \u201cFuck me... Harder, please-- Yes!\u201d his fingers tighten around Harry\u2019s as he comes loudly, gasping for air as he thrashes wildly.\nHips pumping almost out of his control, Harry follows, claimed by huge, full-body shudders, sucking fresh bruises onto Malfoy\u2019s neck\u00a0as he emits faint mewls, clinging tightly to Harry.\nHarry doesn\u2019t want to move, doesn\u2019t want to pull out; doesn\u2019t want it to end. He\u2019s still reluctant to be the first one to talk about it \u2013 this \u2013 and despite the fact that Malfoy had made it clear that he wants Harry to stay back for him, for them, Harry is worried that\u00a0Malfoy would simply revert to how things had been between them.\nBut when Harry finally does pull out of him and falls heavily beside him, Malfoy instantly turns into his chest, nuzzling his face into his neck, tossing one thin leg around him.\n\u201cPull the covers up, Potter, I\u2019m cold.\u201d Harry does as he\u2019s told, hiding a smile in the blond hair, pressing a kiss into the glossy strands. \u201cGod, I always suspected you\u2019d be like this after sex.\u201d\n\u201cLike what, Malfoy?\u201d\n\u201cCuddly.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one cuddled up to me.\u201d\n\u201cShall I leave, then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tie you down, you prat, I swear to god.\u201d\nHe feels Malfoy grin into his collarbones. \u201cYou\u2019d like that wouldn\u2019t you, you kinky bastard?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me going again already,\u201d Harry groans as his cock twitches, tightening his arms around him. Malfoy laughs softly.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap now and then I want some egg rolls.\u201d\n\u201cDone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n Epilogue \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you want to stay partnered with West?\u201d Robards looks slightly weary.\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Malfoy replies.\n\u201cBut Potter has requested you bac--\u201d\n\u201cPotter doesn\u2019t know what he wants,\u201d he cuts in quickly.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s a little dim like that.\u201d\nHarry scowls. \u201cI\u2019m literally standing right here.\u201d\u00a0\nMalfoy glances sideways at him, hiding a grin. \u201cPoint is, sir, we\u2019d really appreciate it if you just... let things remain as they are.\u201d\n\u201cBut we--\u201d Harry starts.\n\u201cWe are in a romantic relationship, Potter,\u201d Malfoy interrupts looking exasperated, \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s against regulations to be partnered with your... partner,\u201d he finishes, frowning confusedly. Robards looks stunned.\n\u201cI see,\u201d he says, looking slightly bewildered as he turns to a furiously blushing Harry for confirmation. Harry gives him a jerky shrug, nodding awkwardly. \u201cRight,\u201d he looks like he\u2019s struggling to pull himself together, \u201cOkay so... So get out, then,\u201d he says, waving a hand at them vigorously. \u201cNothing to discuss further, is there?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d Malfoy nods smartly and immediately strides out, clicking his tongue impatiently when Harry takes a few extra seconds to follow him, slouching grumpily.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d Harry grouches, once outside. \u201cFucking wank--\u201d\nMalfoy steps forward and kisses him firmly. \u201cDo shut up, Potter,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cNow you can grope my arse whenever you like, think about that.\u201d He grins cheekily, presses another swift kiss on him, and saunters away jauntily, leaving Harry to stare after him.\nSmirking, Harry follows, deciding that he\u2019d very much like to indulge in some groping right about now.\n\u00a0\n\n~end~\n"
