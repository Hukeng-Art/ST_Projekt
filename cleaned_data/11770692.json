    "text": "\u201cHey,\u201d Kirishima says, poking Kaminari with the tip of his pencil. \u201cd\u2019ya think if I asked him on a date, he\u2019d say yes?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m talking about!\u201d\nKaminari looks up from the worksheet he\u2019s struggling to complete, and he raises an eyebrow. \u201cBakugou.\u201d\nKirishima bristles. \u201cWell, I mean -  objectively - \u201d \n\u201cI bet he\u2019s never even been on a date in his life,\u201d Kaminari says, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnyways, it\u2019s  your  death wish, dude.\u201d\n\u201cHey, he totally wouldn\u2019t explode me if I asked him out!\u201d Kirishima hisses, eyes darting up just in case anyone else happened to be listening to their conversation. \u201cUh, right?\u201d\n\u201cAre you guys even  friends ?\u201d Kaminari sighs. \u201cLike, I feel like that would be a better first step to take here. Friendship.\u201d\n\u201cDude, Bakugou is totally my friend,\u201d Kirishima says, and then he stands up from his chair, waving obnoxiously over at Bakugou a few desks over, staring intently at his own worksheet. \u201cHey, hey, Bakugou!\u201d\nBakugou growls at the interruption, his head shooting up and red eyes landing on Kirishima.\nKirishima grins warmly. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d\nBakugou explodes the pencil in his hand. His eyes fall back onto his worksheet.\nKirishima sits back down, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \u201cOkay, fair point,\u201d he says to Kaminari. \u201cFriends first?\u201d\nKaminari nods, albeit a bit nervously at the prospect. \u201cYeah, dude. Friends first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBecoming friends with Bakugou turns out to be a surprisingly hard task. He\u2019s always the first one out of the classroom when Aizawa dismisses them, and he\u2019s always the last to arrive in the morning, seconds before class even  starts  . It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to get in as little social interaction as possible, get his work done as fast as possible, and spend the  least amount of time ever  in the vicinity of other people.\nHonestly, it\u2019s a little amazing, how well Bakugou can evade his fellow students. Unless he\u2019s provoked in some way, he tends to keep to himself.\nThough, in all actuality, he seems to be provoked quite a bit.\n\u201cI\u2019ll  kill you!\u201d \nTodoroki raises an eyebrow when Bakugou overturns his own desk and explodes it halfway across the classroom. Aizawa is late - again - so the students are currently unsupervised.\n\u201cKacchan - c-calm down!\u201d Midoriya frantically waves, somehow still feeling responsible for the reckless behavior of his childhood friend - enemy? Frenemy? Honestly, Kirishima has no clue what to call them.\n\u201cShut the  fuck  up,\u201d Bakugou hisses at Midoriya. If Kirishima was smarter, he would stay completely out of it, but this could be a potential wasted friendship opportunity (how, he doesn\u2019t know yet) so he waltzes over and crosses his arms over his chest.\n\u201cYo, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Kirishima asks. Bakugou growls and Kirishima can see the way his palms spark.\n\u201cStay out of it,  shithead .\u201d\nKirishima pouts. \u201cSo mean.\u201d\n\u201cI just asked him if he needed help on the homework,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s face is deadpan, but Kirishima  swears  he sees a smug glint in his eye. \u201cIt looked like he was struggling.\u201d\n\u201cLike  hell I was struggling, you half\u2019n\u2019half fuckmunch - \u201d\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Kirishima says, gently, because that\u2019s the kind of approach no one ever seems to take with Bakugou. It can\u2019t hurt to try. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way, okay?\u201d\nTodoroki is a sly motherfucker, and in reality, he  could\u2019ve  meant it in a bad way, but still.\nBakugou looks about ready to blow a damn fuse again, so Kirishima bites the inside of his cheek before reaching out and circling one of his twitching wrists. He holds it tightly in his hand (hardening himself just in case) but surprisingly\u2026.. It works?\nBakugou freezes at the touch, mouth going a little slack, and for a hot second Kirishima thinks he broke him. Midoriya\u2019s eyes are wide, darting between Kirishima and Bakugou, completely frozen as if one wrong move might set off a mine, but then Kirishima slowly takes his thumb, and presses it comfortingly against the bone of Bakugou\u2019s wrist.\nBakugou swallows, but then he\u2019s yanking his hand back with too much force and stalking to the back of the classroom, plopping down in an unoccupied desk since he blew up his own.\nMidoriya is still staring slack-jawed at the empty space where Bakugou was, and Kirishima purses his lips and shrugs before walking back over to Kaminari and sitting down.\n\u201cDude what the hell?\u201d Kaminari whispers. He looks over to Bakugou, who\u2019s currently sitting in silence, eyebrows furrowed as he sinks further into his seat.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re friends now?\u201d\n\u201cNo - well,\u201d Kaminari furrows his eyebrows. \u201cMaybe?\u201d\nKirishima grins.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKirishima knows that Bakugou goes to the little market store around the corner almost everyday after school and gets a drink and an apple. He only knows this because Tooru\u2019s cousin works there and she told him, snickering loudly like she  knew. \nTooru probably knows every damn secret of their class.\nThe chair of his desk squeaks when he stands up, taking a breath, and Kaminari shoots him a reluctant thumbs up for good luck. Kirishima nods in thanks before turning on his heel and stalking towards Bakugou\u2019s desk. The blonde is currently shoving his books back in his bag, and when Kirishima skids to a stop next to him, Bakugou looks up with narrowed eyes.\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cWanna do something?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy us drinks from the store!\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nKirishima pouts. \u201cBut you\u2019re going there anyways, right?\u201d\nBakugou glares. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nKirishima flushes a bit. \u201cUh.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Bakugou rolls his eyes. \u201cYou can come if you want, I don\u2019t give a shit either way.\u201d\nKirishima grins, turning towards Kaminari and giving an eager thumbs up. Kaminari makes a lewd motion with his hands that has Kirisima choking on his tongue and grabbing Bakugou by the sleeve, dragging him out of the classroom.\n\u201cFucker - what the -  let me go ,\u201d Bakugou yanks his arm free once they\u2019re a good distance down the hall, headed towards the front doors of the school. \u00a0He eyes Kirishima hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 weird.\u201d\nThe sun is shining, the air is clear, Kirishima is  hanging out with Bakugou . It\u2019s a good day, and so Kirishima just grins and shoves his hands into his pockets, bumping shoulders with the blonde next to him.\nBakugou growls and tries to trip him.\nYeah, this is totally a step in the right direction. Something is blossoming, okay, Kirishima can  feel it .\n\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how close are we as friends?\u201d Kirishima asks, kicking a pebble as they wander down the sidewalk.\nBakugou grunts. \u201cNegative four.\u201d\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon,\u201d Kirishima whines. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\nBakugou just shrugs and \u00a0hunches in on himself. Kirishima at this point is used to his outbursts and exclamations, so it\u2019s his silences that are always super surprising. Kirishima takes this time to observe, taking in the way the sun hits Bakugou\u2019s blonde hair and makes it look lighter than it really is. The slope of his nose curves down, and his brows are furrowed like he wants to say something but can\u2019t think of the right words. It\u2019s warm out, and there\u2019s a light sheen of sweat on his face. When he wipes his forehead with his sleeve, Kirishima swallows.\nFuck.\nBakugou shoves the door open when they get to the store, and Kirishima darts in behind him before the door closes on his face.\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Kirishima moans when the air conditioned air hits his face. \u201cIt\u2019s so  hot  out today.\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s already over at the cooler, grabbing a melon soda and then an apple from the basket on the counter, and Kirishima makes a noise before scrambling over and shoving himself in front of Bakugou.\n\u201cIt\u2019s on me!\u201d He exclaims to the girl working the register, grabbing a few crumpled up bills from his pocket and slamming them on the counter.\n\u201cThe fuck, shitty-hair?\u201d Bakugou hisses.\n\u201cI\u2019m paying,\u201d Kirishima says, putting his hands on his hips and beaming widely.\n\u201c Why?\u201d  Bakugou growls. \u201cI don\u2019t need your money, I can pay for my own damn self.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cBut that\u2019s what friends do! They do nice things for each other.\u201d\nAnd then Kirishima rocks on his heels, leaning a bit closer. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m gonna move my rank up from negative four, I have to step it up!\u201d\nKirishima\u2019s fully expecting Bakugou to grab his money back from the cashier and blow it up in his palm, but what Kirishima\u2019s not expecting is for Bakugou to turn red and purse his lips. He clenches his hands into fists, and then grabs his items and storms out of the store.\n\u201cSee you tomorrow at school!\u201d Kirishima calls out with a wave.\n\u201cHere\u2019s your change,\u201d the cashier says, and Kirishima turns to her with a smile.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d\nShe nods towards the door curiously. \u201cNegative four?\u201d\nKirishima sighs and leans on the counter, propping his chin in his palm. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re at least a five. Maybe even a six, after today.\u201d\n\u201cO - kay,\u201d the girls says slowly, popping her gum. \u201cWell, good luck with that.\u201d\nKirishima salutes her before grabbing his change and darting out of the store. Progress has been made today. He can\u2019t wait to tell Kaminari.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d Kirishima sighs happily, \u201cthat Bakugou\u2019s ears turn red when he blushes?\u201d\n\u201cGross,\u201d Kaminari says, digging around in his locker. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know Bakugou  could blush. He\u2019s capable of human emotions? Shocking.\u201d\n\u201cI bought him a drink yesterday after school and I thought for sure he\u2019d throw a fit, but he just kinda.... went quiet and then ran away?\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a preteen girl with a crush,\u201d Kaminari snorts. Kirishima perks up.\n\u201cOh man, d\u2019you think he  likes me? \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Bakugou likes anyone,\u201d Kaminari says, hitching his bag higher on his shoulder as they head towards class.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cI saw him petting a stray cat the other day by the gym.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t - wait, seriously? No fuckin\u2019 way.\u201d Kaminari looks interested now, as if the thought of Bakugou showing compassion to  anything  is worthy to contemplate. Let alone a  cat  . If anything, Bakugou comes across as a dog person, through and through. But Kirishima saw through the window last week (he was stuck behind taking a makeup test) and Bakugou was  totally  coddling an orange tabby. His back was turned, so Kirishima couldn\u2019t see his face, but the lines of his body were relaxed without their usual tension.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an animal lover, it\u2019s so  cute ,\u201d Kirishima coos as they walk into the classroom.\n\u201cWho\u2019s an animal lover?\u201d Ashido pipes up, hopping over her desk and seating herself across from Kirishima and Kaminari.\n\u201cBakugou, apparently,\u201d Kaminari says, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cThe  fuck  are you guys talking about?\u201d\nBakugou must\u2019ve just walked in and heard his name, and he stalks over to them with his arms crossed. Kirishima, Ashido, and Kaminari look up at him blankly, but then Ashido grins.\n\u201cYou.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Kirishima says you\u2019re an animal lover!\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck I am,\u201d Bakugou scoffs, \u00a0but there\u2019s a nervous tick to his fingers as they tap at his arm. \u201cStop fuckin\u2019 gossiping and get out of my seat, alien bitch.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally a cat person,\u201d Kirishima whispers to his friends.\nBakugou blows up his desk. Again.\nAizawa gives all four of them detention, but it was  totally worth it.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019ve been going to the store after class together for a few weeks now, and Bakugou usually begrudgingly lets him tag along. He\u2019s stopped letting Kirishima pay for his things (\u201cOkay, fucking fine! You\u2019re not at negative four anymore, you douche face! Stop fucking  buying me shit!\u201d ) but he doesn\u2019t protest when Kirishima asks for a sip of his soda, so. That\u2019s something.\nNormally, Bakugou stomps off without saying a word once they get back to the dorms, and Kirishima usually texts Kaminari to meet him in the common room to fuck around, but today, Bakugou throws a glance over his shoulder impatiently as he\u2019s about to head inside the doors of the dormitories.\n\u201cWell?\u201d he asks, tapping his foot. \u201cAre you fucking coming, or not?\u201d\n\u201cAm I - \u201d Kirishima asks, confused, but then his eyes widen because  oh  . Bakugou is  asking him to come up to his dorm room . Holy shit, yes. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d\n\u201cHurry the fuck up, then,\u201d Bakugou grumbles, but his voice sounds softer than usual.\nKirishima scrambles after him happily.\nWhen Bakugou opens the door to his room, Kirishima\u2019s not expecting the intense cloud of lavender scent to wash over him. He inhales deeply, and when he spots a small little machine near the corner on his desk, whirring quietly, he immediately goes over to it and bends down to inspect further.\n\u201cOh, yeah, just make yourself at fuckin\u2019 home then, I guess,\u201d Bakugou grunts sarcastically, shutting the door and toeing his shoes off.\n\u201cAromatherapy?\u201d Kirishima asks, turning towards Bakugou and raising an eyebrow.\nBakugou shrugs, loosening his tie. \u201cI get nightmares. It helps.\u201d\n Oh, right , Kirishima thinks. Bakugou doesn\u2019t talk about what happened to him, not to anyone, but Kirishima can\u2019t help but shiver thinking about what the other teen has been through. Bakugou\u2019s strong, stronger than most of them for sure, but he\u2019s still just a student. He\u2019s not unbreakable completely, no matter how hard he tries to be.\nBakugou\u2019s words are said with confidence though, as if he\u2019s testing Kirishima or something.\nKirishima hums. \u201cIt smells really nice.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it does, you dumbshit,\u201d he grumbles, glancing down, and Kirishima grins with glee as he notices the other boy\u2019s ears turning pink. \u201cAnyways, you have your school books and shit, right?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yeah, right here?\u201d Kirishima says, patting his backpack lightly.\nBakugou settles on the floor, taking his tie off completely and tossing it onto his unmade bed. \u201cC\u2019mon, sit down and get your shit out.\u201d\nKirishima blinks, and his lips part in surprise. \u201cWait - are you\u2026 are you gonna  help me  with my homework?\u201d\nBakugou rolls his eyes. \u201cI know for a fact you haven\u2019t even fuckin\u2019  started on the worksheet due tomorrow, you irresponsible dickhead. Sit the fuck down.\u201d\n\u201cOh man, we\u2019re at  least  at a five out of ten now, right?\u201d Kirishima exclaims, scooting closer to Bakugou as he pulls out his books and a pencil. Helping someone with their homework is like, five notches up on the friendship scale. Kirishima knows this as fact because only close friends will sacrifice their free time for a cause such as this.\nBakugou scowls. \u201cFuck off. We\u2019re barely at zero.\u201d\n\u201cA four, then?\u201d\n\u201c Zero ,\u201d He hisses. \u201cWhat the fuck, this stupid scale is complete bullshit, you goddamned airhead.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re  definitely pushing level four.\u201d\nBakugou glares. \u201cWe\u2019re at a  three .\u201d\nKirishima fist pumps the air. \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\nBakugou rolls his eyes, but the corner of his lips twitch upward. Kirishima counts it as a win.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019d say yes if I asked him out now?\u201d Kirishima asks as he picks at his lunch. He doesn\u2019t know where Bakugou goes during lunch, and he hasn\u2019t asked. It\u2019s cool. He doesn\u2019t want to overwhelm Bakugou and get knocked back down to zero on the scale.\n\u201cDepends,\u201d Kaminari says, stealing a bite of rice from Kirishima\u2019s lunch. \u201cHow high are you on the scale?\u201d\n\u201cBakugou says we\u2019re a three,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re definitely at at least a five?\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta get to nine on the scale before you ask him out,\u201d Kaminari says matter-of-factly. \u201cMaybe even a ten? I dunno, Bakugou seems like a tough one to crack.\u201d\n\u201cScale? What scale?\u201d\nKirishima looks up when Midoriya and Uraraka sit down across from them at the table.\n\u201cThe friendship scale!\u2019 Kirishima says.\nMidoriya furrows his brow. \u201cFriendship has a scale?\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds silly,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cFriendship isn\u2019t determined by a  scale .\u201d\n\u201cSure it is!\u201d Kaminari argues. \u201cLook, it\u2019s just like the hotness scale, but - \u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a  hotness scale?!\u201d Midoriya exclaims, eyes widening. \u00a0He looks pale.\n\u201cNot the point, but yes,\u201d Kaminari says, nodding. \u201cAnyways, Kirishima and I? We\u2019re at like, a level twelve on the friendship scale.\u201d\n\u201cTwelve out of ten,\u201d Kirishima nods solemnly. \u201cThe truest of bros.\u201d\n\u201cMy ride or die.\u201d Kaminari adds, slinging an arm around Kirishima\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Uraraka says slowly, taking a bite of her food. \u201cWhat does this have to do with Bakugou, then?\u201d\n\u201cKirishima is trying to work his way up Bakugou\u2019s scale, so he can then work his way into his - \u201d\nKirishima flushes and slaps a hand over Kaminari\u2019s mouth. \u201cHaha, uh. What he\u2019s trying to say, is - \u201d\n\u201cOh, I get it,\u201d Uraraka says, smiling. \u201cDeku, it\u2019s like you and Todoroki, right? You\u2019re  super  high up on Todoroki\u2019s friendship scale, huh?\u201d\nMidoriya blushes so hard Kirishima\u2019s concerned he might pass out, \u201cUh, um, a-anyways! Bakugou!\u201d he says shakily, trying to calm himself as Uraraka laughs lightly at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m on his friendship scale at all.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think  anyone  is on his friendship scale,\u201d Kaminari adds.\n\u201cDude, I am,\u201d Kirishima says proudly.\nKaminari raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re barely at a three.\u201d\nKirishima pouts, because okay, Kaminari does have a point, but. Still. Kirishima\u2019s working super hard to climb the ladder of success here, okay? He\u2019s determined, and when Kirishima wants something, he goes and gets it without hesitation.\nLunch continues on, the topic switching to something new, and Kirishima picks idly at his food as he thinks about how all of Bakugou\u2019s clothes probably smell of lavender and ash.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nSometimes Bakugou will let Kirishima come with him on his morning runs, and though Bakugou doesn\u2019t say much, Kirishima is always eager to tag along.\nSix in the morning is the usual time, so when Kirishima arrives at Bakugou\u2019s dorm at 6:02am, and Bakugou isn\u2019t already opening the door and shoving past him, Kirishima frowns. Usually it\u2019s Bakugou waiting on  him  to be ready on time, not the other way around. Kirishima\u2019s learned that Bakugou is kind of a morning person. Kirishima wonders if he\u2019s well rested, or if it\u2019s just the nightmares that cause him to wake up so early.\nHe knocks once, twice, but when he fails to get a response, he shrugs and decides to try the door knob.\nSurprisingly, it\u2019s unlocked.\n\u201cBakugou?\u201d Kirishima calls out, slowly peeking his head inside. The blinds are down, but soft peeks of early sunlight are streaming in, illuminating the room in a gentle glow. The scent of lavender is strong, as expected, and when Kirishima\u2019s eyes scan over to Bakugou\u2019s bed, he frowns as he sees the covers flipped but no body in sight.\nHe\u2019s just about to shoot a text to Bakugou when something soft brushes his leg.\nKirishima yelps and stumbles back, eyes darting down to the ground, and when his eyes lock with bright feline green, his mouth falls open in surprise.\n\u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit.\u201d\nThe fact that Bakugou has a cat hidden in his dorm should be more alarming than it is, but Kirishima is a little distracted at the moment, and he falls to his knees to pet the creature. The cat is orange, and Kirishima\u2019s eyes widen in recognition. Is this the same cat he saw Bakugou with a few weeks ago? Oh my god.\n\u201cOi,  fuckface  ,\u201d a low voice hisses at him from behind, and Kirishima jumps and spins around on his knees, falling on his ass and making the cat dart under the bed away from the commotion. \u201cWhat the  fuck  are you doing in my  room .\u201d\n\u201cUh, it was unlocked?\u201d Kirishima offers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s past 6am. We usually go running, remember?\u201d\nBakugou curses as he checks the time on his phone. \u201cShit, I was out longer than i thought,\u201d he mutters.\nIt\u2019s then that Kirishima notices the bag in his arm.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNone of your fuckin\u2019 business.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you have a secret cat in your room?\u201d\nBakugou\u2019s face flushes. \u201cNone of your  fuckin\u2019 business .\u201d\n\u201cYou know pets aren\u2019t allowed,\u201d Kirishima says cheerfully, and Bakugou\u2019s palms spark as if he\u2019s getting ready to dispose of Kirishima\u2019s skull. Kirishima holds his hands up in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I won\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d\nBakugou seems to relax a little.\n\u201cBut only if you say we\u2019re at a level five on the scale.\u201d\nBakugou looks like he wants to protest, but he sighs and runs a hand over his face tiredly. \u201cDoes blackmail even fucking count?\u201d\n\u201cIt does now,\u201d Kirishima responds, standing up. The cat pokes it\u2019s head out from under Bakugou\u2019s bed, and Kirishima watches as Bakugou sets the bag down and then crouches low, holding out a hand for the cat to sniff.\n\u201cS\u2019okay, Cherry,\u201d Bakugou says quietly.\n\u201cHer name is  Cherry ?\u201d Kirishima exclaims excitedly, and Bakugou growls and doesn\u2019t look at him, keeping his eye on the cat.\n\u201cNo, you dumbass, her name is Cherry bomb .\u201d\n\u201cCherrybomb? Oh my god.,\u201d Kirishima whispers, pressing a hand to his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s so cute,\u201d Kirishima says louder, clearing his throat. Shit.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bakugou says, proudly almost, and when the cat is close enough, Bakugou scoops her up in his arms. His hands are large compared to her smaller body, and though she\u2019s not a kitten, she\u2019s still a fairly young cat. Kirishima guesses no older than a year.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Bakugou says lowly. \u201cI know I can\u2019t keep her. I\u2019m not a fucking idiot.\u201d His gaze lowers, to where the cat is kneading at his arm, tail swishing happily as she purrs. \u201cI\u2019m just watching her for a bit, until the shelter I contacted can find her a home.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, if you wanted to keep her,\u201d Kirishima says.\nBakugou frowns. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to her. I\u2019m not gonna keep her locked up in some stupid fucking dorm room. She needs a real home.\u201d\nKirishima resists the urge to physically clutch at his heart. He\u2019s sure no one but him has seen this side of Bakugou before, and Kirishima was  so  right about the cat lover thing. His life just keeps getting better and better. Bakugou shouldn\u2019t look so damn  good  with a cat in his arms and a distressed scowl on his face, but he fucking does, and Kirishima pinches his arm to make sure he\u2019s not dreaming or something.\n\u201cI can, uh, help you take care of her, if you want?\u201d Kirishima offers, stepping closer hesitantly, watching Bakugou\u2019s eyes follow him. \u201cUntil you can find her a home?\u201d\nIt\u2019s quiet for a few moments, and when Kirishima reaches a hand out to scratch behind the cat\u2019s ears, Bakugou lets him. Kirishima rocks back on his heels, his chest feeling full.\n\u201cSix,\u201d Bakugou says, after a while. His voice is gruff, and he shuffles the tiniest bit closer so Kirishima doesn\u2019t have to stretch so far to pet the cat.\n\u201cSix?\u201d Kirishima asks, confused.\nWhen Bakugou looks up, Kirishima is blessed to see that familiar blush across his cheeks.\n\u201cOn your stupid fucking scale, you  idiot . We\u2019re at a six.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Kirishima breathes. \u201c Oh  , shit. Hell  yes!\u201d \nBakugou rolls his eyes and goes back to coddling the cat in his arms, and Kirishima feels like he could take on the whole  world .\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBakugou finds a home for the cat a few days later, which is probably good because it had been getting increasingly harder to keep her a secret. Kirishima is pretty sure Aizawa knew, and he knows for a fact that Ashido knew too, because Kirishima would find her visiting Bakugou in his dorm way more often than she ever would normally (and way more often than Bakugou would ever let her).\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have named her,\u201d Kirishima says as he sits down on the grass, two melon sodas in his hands. \u201cWhen you name things, it just makes it harder to let go, dude.\u201d\nBakugou doesn\u2019t say a word, just sits down on the grass next to Kirishima and snatches one of the sodas out of his hands. The cat went to a good home, the shelter made sure to reassure Bakugou, and though Kirishima wasn\u2019t there for the official goodbye, by the tenseness in Bakugou\u2019s shoulders it wasn\u2019t easy at all.\nKirishima bumps their knees together. \u201cHey, man, you did the right thing! I\u2019m sure Cherrybomb is super happy with her new family.\u201d\n\u201cI  know that ,\u201d Bakugou grumbles, but his voice is quieter than usual. He drinks his soda in three long gulps, crushes the can in his fist, and then turns towards Kirishima and says, \u201cI\u2019m going for a run.\u201d\nKirishima is fully prepared for Bakugou to just jump up and leave him, but when Bakugou just stares at him, his face carefully blank save for a tiny crinkle between his brows, Kirishima frowns. What?\nWhat does he - oh, right. It\u2019s an invitation.\n\u201cMe too!\u201d Kirishima says quickly, a smile breaking out on his face, and he almost misses the way the tension in Bakugou\u2019s shoulders melts just a bit.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, shitty hair,\u201d Bakugou says, standing up, and when he holds out a hand for Kirishima to grab, Kirishima can\u2019t help the stupid little jump his heart does as he grabs the outstretched palm.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou and Bakugou seem to be getting pretty close, huh?\u201d Sero says as he sits next to Kirishima on the couch in the common area. Kaminari is sprawled on the floor, half asleep on his worksheet while Ashido attempts to braid his hair, and Tooru is seated behind Ashido attempting to braid  her  hair. Kirishima\u2019s pretty sure none of them know how to braid hair at all, but he admires their diligence.\n\u201cWhen are you gonna ask him out?\u201d Ashido interrupts before Kirishima can respond to Sero, and Kirishima frowns and crosses his arms.\n\u201cI have a plan!\u201d Kirishima exclaims. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush me, okay? This is a highly delicate situation, here.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should skip the whole \u2018asking out\u2019 process and just grab him and plant a big, fat kiss right on his - \u201d\nKaminari makes a few tired, fake-gagging noises, and Kirishima snorts on a laugh. His hands tremble though, his face growing incredibly warm at the thought of kissing Bakugou. He wonders if Bakugou would be a rough kisser? Or maybe Bakugou would be tentative, worried about being absolutely perfect because he has to be the best at everything, kissing included.\nKirishima wonders what Bakugou\u2019s mouth would taste like.\n\u201cHe has to work his way up the scale first,\u201d Kaminari says after a moment. Ashido has given up on braiding and now has given him two twin ponytails atop his head. \u201cWhat level are you at?\u201d\n\u201cThat scale is  dumb ,\u201d Ashido points out, and when Tooru make a noise of confusion, Ashido quickly explains the supposed importance of the Friendship Scale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dumb, it\u2019s a stepping stone!\u201d Kaminari exclaims, and Sero laughs.\n\u201cI dunno, it sounds\u2026.. implausible? You can\u2019t really just put whatever you want on a scale and live by it, you know. Especially like, emotions and stuff.\u201d\nKirishima hums in thought. He  has  been thinking less and less about the scale recently, when he\u2019s with Bakugou, and instead has been paying more attention to\u2026. well, to  Bakugou . It\u2019s like, when they\u2019re together, Kirishima forgets why he was even trying to climb a scale in the first place, because everything seems to just make\u2026. sense?\nEugh. Kirishima\u2019s heart throbs. He\u2019s way deeper into this than he originally thought.\nHe\u2019s about to say something, but then Bakugou storms into the common room, sweat dripping off his face and jacket tied around his waist. It looks like he just got back from the gym, his face flushed with exertion, and Kirishima  almost  visibly shivers. Sometimes he forgets how fucking attractive Bakugou is -\nNo, that\u2019s a lie. Kirishima could never forget that.\n\u201cFuckface,\u201d Bakugou says to Kirishima, wiping his forehead with the back of his arm. \u201cCome with me to the store, I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 thirsty.\u201d\nKirishima scrambles off the couch in record speed, his heart stuck in his throat. \u201cYes - uh, yeah. Me too. I'm - I'm totally thirsty too.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure are,\u201d Sero says.\nAshido laughs so hard she falls on top of Kaminari, who squawks in surprise.\nKirishima wills his stupid blush away and watches Bakugou\u2019s back as he turns to leave.\n\u201cI hate you guys,\u201d he whispers, stumbling over his own feet in his haste to catch up to Bakugou.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBakugou is never late to class.\nSure, he\u2019ll show up literally .5 seconds before class begins, but he\u2019s always shown up on time. Bakugou\u2019s hot headed, but he\u2019s way serious about his education and his heroism, whether he likes to admit it or not. He\u2019s smart, and always turns his assignments in on time, and he\u2019s  never  late.\nThat\u2019s why, why Bakugou walks into class 10 minutes late with bloodshot eyes and an exhausted scowl on his face, Kirishima knows something\u2019s up.\n\u201cNice of you to join us, Bakugou,\u201d Aizawa says lowly, (As if he\u2019s one to talk, Kirishima thinks).\nBakugou says nothing, though Kirishima can see the way his finger twitch, with the need to blow something up most likely. It looks like his patience is being tested, like one wrong move could teeter him right over the edge and into rage mode.\nHe sits himself in his normal seat, sinking low enough that his leg splay completely under the desk in front of him, and crosses his arms over his chest. His face is set in a glare, and Kirishima averts his eyes quickly to avoid getting caught staring. He\u2019s more a little concerned, but he pushes the thoughts away and tries to focus on the lesson.\nHe can feel a weird tension in the room, though. Everyone knows how diligent Bakugou is about school, and the fact that he\u2019s late and also not seeming to be paying much attention, has piqued everyone\u2019s curiosity.\nAizawa hands out the daily worksheets to each row of desk, and when Midoriya reaches behind him to hand Bakugou his worksheet, Kirishima\u2019s eyes widen to see Bakugou practically asleep on his desk. Kirishima\u2019s eyes dart to Midoriya, who\u2019s turned around in his desk curiously, and Kirishima winces when Midoriya reaches out and gently shakes Bakugou\u2019s arm. This can\u2019t end well.\n\u201cUh, Kacchan?\u201d Midoriya says softly, as sweet as ever, and Bakugou  jolts  upright in his seat, palms sparking as his eyes lock with Midoriya\u2019s.\nBakugou\u2019s eyes narrow in a glare. \u201cWhat the  fuck  do you  want  - \u201d\n\u201cY-You were sleeping and... \u201d\n\u201cI  wasn\u2019t fucking sleeping ,\u201d Bakugou yells, standing up abruptly. \u201cDon\u2019t ever fucking touch me again.\u201d\n\u201cI was just trying to - \u201d\n\u201c Shut up!\u201d \nKirishima flinches when Bakugou slams his palms down on his desk, singing two hand-print shaped marks into the wood as Midoriya flinches back. Bakugou looks like he\u2019s about two seconds away from strangling the kid, jesus. To be honest, Bakugou hasn\u2019t been this testy in a long, long time. Sure, he\u2019s always kind of harsh, but he\u2019s calmed down a lot since\u2026.\nWell, since Kirishima started hanging out with him, really.\nThe outburst is bringing back memories from the first few months of UA together, and Kirishima can\u2019t stop his legs from standing up when Bakugou makes to lunge at Midoriya.\n\u201c Bakugou ,\u201d Kirishima says, hopping over his desk until he can grab onto Bakugou\u2019s sleeve. Bakugou, predictably, yanks his arm away, but it\u2019s with enough force that he stumbles a bit, lagging on his feet, which is completely unlike him at all.\nAizawa looks like he\u2019s one second away from giving both of them a week\u2019s worth of detention for the childish outburst, and Kirishima reaches for Bakugou\u2019s wrist again, fingers curling around the bone tightly, hardening himself just in case.\n\u201cAizawa-senpai, sorry! Just - can you give us a moment?\u201d Kirishima calls out, and then he\u2019s tugging Bakugou out of the classroom quickly, shooting a slightly apologetic look to Midoriya as he passes.\nSurprisingly, Bakugou lets himself be dragged, having resigned himself silently, and once they\u2019re a good few feet away, the classroom door shut and the silence of the empty hallway deafening between them, Kirishima lets out a shallow breath before turning to the blonde.\n\u201cDude, what the hell?\u201d Kirishima says, but his voice is gentle. \u201cYou can\u2019t just freak out like that.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Bakugou scoffs, and his gaze is drawn down, hands shoved in his pockets.\nKirishima looks at him - really looks, this time - and there\u2019s bags under his eyes, his skin looking paler than usual. He looks completely  exhausted , like he hasn\u2019t slept in days, and Kirishima frowns, because Bakugou\u2019s weirdly conscious about taking care of himself. He eats three square meals a day, keeps sanitizer in his bag for his hands so he doesn\u2019t get sick, and gets eight hours of sleep a night.\nHe doesn\u2019t look very well rested right now, though.\n\u201cHave you been sleeping?\u201d Kirishima asks, and Bakugou shrugs.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThat\u2019s an answer in itself, and Kirishima frowns. \u201cOf course it matters. You turn into a massive dick when you don\u2019t get enough sleep, apparently.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a massive dick all the time,\u201d Bakugou bites back.\nKirishima sighs. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. If you were a massive dick all the time, then I wouldn\u2019t be your friend, you know.\u201d\n\u201cMy - my fucking diffuser broke,\u201d Bakugou says suddenly, rubbing a tired palm over his face. \u201cI just\u2026 haven\u2019t been sleeping, okay?\u201d\n Oh  , Kirishima thinks, his heart sinking a bit at the realization.  He\u2019s getting nightmares again. \nKirishima opens his mouth to respond, but a voice interrupts him.\n\u201cAre you two quite finished?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Aizawa, peeking his head out of the classroom door a few feet away, an impatient scowl on his face. \u00a0\n\u201cUh, yes! Sorry, we\u2019re coming back now!\u201d Kirishima reassures, bowing quickly.\nWhen he turns to Bakugou, the blonde is already shuffling back to the classroom, shoulders hunched and tense.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nHatsume squints down at the device, humming in thought and flitting around it like it\u2019s a new specimen of alien or something and not just a small, broken little humidifier.\nKirishima wrings his hands together tightly. It\u2019s lunch time, and most of the students are in the cafeteria or outside on break. Kirishima doesn\u2019t know where Bakugou went off to, but he\u2019s hoping to god he went to go take a nap or something.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Kirishima asks nervously, leaning forward as Hatsume picks up the diffuser and brings it closer to her face. \u201cD\u2019ya think you can fix it?\u201d\nHatsume grins, holding the diffuser above her head like a goddamned newborn baby. \u201cOf  course  I can fix it! I can even upgrade it, if you want! What\u2019re you looking for? Weaponry? Laser beams? Oh! I could turn it into some sort of pocket shield, perfect for surprise combat - \u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Kirishima interrupts, \u201cif you could make it just like it was before? That would be amazing!\u201d\n\u201c Boooooring ,\u201d Hatsume whines, but then shrugs and sets the diffuser back on the table, pulling a few tools from her belt and leaning down so she\u2019s eye-level with the machine.. \u201cIt\u2019s doable though, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOh man, sweet!\u201d Kirishima exclaims, throwing his fist in the air. \u201cThank you! How long do you think it\u2019ll - \u201d\n\u201cDone.\u201d\nHatsume holds the diffuser out, and Kirishima\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cThat\u2026 was fast,\u201d he says slowly, carefully taking and diffuser in his hands and holding it to his chest. Hatsume is incredibly talented, Kirishima notes, watching as she shrugs and goes back to fiddling with whatever item she was working on before Kirishima came and interrupted her. \u201cSeriously though, I really appreciate you doing this for me.\u201d\nHatsume waves a hand, offering a bright grin. \u201cNo problemo! Now, would you like to see the beautiful,  amazing  baby that I\u2019m working on now? It\u2019s a modified version of the boots i used during the sports festival, but this time - \u201d\n\u201cSorry, uh, maybe later!\u201d Kirishima says sheepishly, grinning and waving as he bounds away, \u201cThanks again!\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKirishima\u2019s doing push-ups in his room later that night when three loud, rapt knocks on his door interrupt him. He finishes his current push-up before hopping up and rolling his shoulders back, swinging open the door to come face to face with none other than Bakugou.\n\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Bakugou says, pushing past him and sitting on Kirishima\u2019s bed, kicking his feet up and crossing his arms over his chest. Kirishima raises an eyebrow but doesn\u2019t stop him. He closes the door before turning back to Bakugou, and when he inhales, he can faintly smell lavender.\n\u201cSurprise?\u201d Kirishima offers, grinning hopefully and hoping to god Bakugou doesn\u2019t explode his face off for breaking into his room not only once (to steal the broken diffuser) but  twice  (to  return  the fixed diffuser).\n\u201cWhy the fuck would you - I don\u2019t get it,\u201d  Bakugou says after a moment, and Kirishima feels his heart jump into his throat, because Bakugou looks lost and frustrated, but grateful, and he sits up so he\u2019s propped against the headboard, knees pulled up to his chest. \u201cWhy are you so fuckin\u2019  nice  to me? Is this about your stupid fucking scale again?\u201d\nOh shit, Kirishima thinks, Bakugou seems to think - Bakugou thinks this is some sort of  game . Kirishima\u2019s stomach drops, and he can feel his hands start to clam up as he takes a hesitant seat on the bed, a good distance away from Bakugou to be safe.\n\u201cDude -  no , forget the scale,\u201d Kirishima says, \u201cI mean, like, it was helpful, for a bit I guess? It helped me get closer to you, so\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI just - I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bakugou growls softly, and when he looks up, his eyes are full of some sort of emotion that Kirishima can\u2019t place. \u201cWhy would you put so much fucking effort into getting close to me?\u201d Bakugou furrows his eyebrows, rubbing his eyes, frustrated. \u201cYou\u2026 you said we\u2019re\u2026.. at a six, right?\u201d\n\u201c You  said we\u2019re at a six,\u201d Kirishima says without thinking, flinching when Bakugou extends his leg and kicks him roughly.\n\u201c Whatever ,\u201d he hisses, but then he pulls his legs back, crossing his arms over his knees and resting his chin on top, eyes curious. \u201cOkay, so, what the fuck happens when we get to ten?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kirishima asks. His throat feels dry, and Bakugou is looking at him with this - this  vulnerable expression on his face.\n\u201c Kirishima  ,\u201d Bakugou\u2019s voice is quiet when he speaks, talking slowly and deliberately. \u201cWhat  happens\u2026  . when we get to  ten ?\u201d\nKirishima scoots closer to him on the bed without thinking, until he\u2019s nearly nose to nose with the blonde. He swallows, the sound deafening in the quiet of the room, and his hand shakes a bit when he reaches up and brushes Bakugou\u2019s hair away from his face.\nBakugou looks like he\u2019s about to throw up, but he also looks anxious, watching Kirishima\u2019s every move with a calculating stare. He doesn\u2019t get up and shove Kirishima away though, so Kirishima pushes his doubts down, hiding them behind every other emotion he\u2019s feeling at the moment, and he grips Bakugou\u2019s chin gently.\n\u201cWhen we get to ten I\u2026. I guess I do this?\u201d Kirishima whispers, nudging his nose against Bakugou\u2019s before surging forward and pressing their lips together.\nBakugou makes a gentle noise against his mouth, and Kirishima is about to pull back and apologize profusely, to forget this ever happened at all, but then Bakugou\u2019s unfolding his legs and grabbing Kirishima by the collar of his shirt, tugging him forward roughly.\nKirishima squeaks when his nose collides with Bakugou\u2019s jaw, but then Bakugou\u2019s  kissing him , mouth warm and wet against his own. Bakugou\u2019s hands are in his hair, but his touch is tentative, as if he\u2019s scared Kirishima still wants to pull away.\nWhich is, of course, the  last thing  that Kirishima wants to do.\nHe makes sure to prove this fact by wrapping his arms around Bakugou\u2019s waist, holding him close as he deepens the kiss, making a pleased noise when Bakugou tilts his head to the side for a better angle. It\u2019s so warm, and Kirishima feels his heart spinning around in his body, shaking just as hard as his hands probably are, and wow, he likes Bakugou  so  damn much.\n\u201cAre we - \u201d Kirishima pants, breaking apart from the kiss in order to trail his lips across Bakugou\u2019s cheek, down to his jaw where he nips gently just to feel Bakugou jolt against him. \u201cAre we at a ten, then?\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up about your shitty scale,\u201d Bakugou breathes out, \u201cAnd  kiss me .\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Kirishima says, pulling back and running a hand through Bakugou\u2019s hair, down the side of his neck, over his chest. He can\u2019t seem to stop  touching him , and Bakugou is pressing up into Kirishima\u2019s hands like his body is unconsciously connected to his fingertips. Kirishima kisses him again once, twice, and gasps against his mouth,\n\u201cI like you  so much, dude.\u201d\nBakugou makes a strangled, broken sound, and Kirishima pulls back to see him flushed across his cheekbones. It\u2019s  so  much better, seeing it up close like this, close enough that Kirishima can see the very faint freckles over his nose. He kisses them, because he can, and Bakugou lets out a shaky breath, glaring up at Kirishima because somehow they ended up horizontal within the past few minutes.\n\u201cWill you go out with me?\u201d Kirishima asks, puppy dog eyes wide and eager, and Bakugou groans. \u201cKaminari said you wouldn\u2019t say yes, but I think, now, you  totally would.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if I say  no , you fuckass?\u201d Bakugou responds, but his hand is still fisted in Kirishima\u2019s hair, grip tight and not letting up anytime soon.\n\u201cIf you say no,\u201d Kirishima says, curling his fingers over the curve of Bakugou\u2019s waist. \u201cThen I\u2019ll back off, and let you go back to your room, of course.\u201d\n\u201cIf I say yes?\u201d Bakugou manages, squirming a bit underneath Kirishima\u2019s weight. \u201cWhat then, huh?\u201d\n\u201cThen I kiss you again,\u201d Kirishima grins, \u00a0\u201cand again and  again and - \u201d \nBakugou slaps a palm over Kirishima\u2019s mouth, face hot with a fresh blush. \u201c God  , shut the fuck  up .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you  all night ,\u201d Kirishima laughs, muffled behind Bakugou\u2019s palm.\nBakugou closes his eyes and lets his head fall back against this pillows. \u201cStop  talking , holy shit.\u201d\nKirishima pulls Bakugou\u2019s hand away from his face. \u201cYou like it.\u201d\n\u201cI  don\u2019t .\u201d\nKirishima presses closer. \u201cYou like  me .\u201d\n\u201cI...\u201d Bakugou trails off, peeking his eye open to see Kirishima smiling at him, fond and happy. \u201cUh.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Kirishima says, cupping Bakugou\u2019s face in his hands. He leans down, kissing him again soft and gentle but with the tiniest hint of teeth that has Bakugou\u2019s lips parting on a breath and eyelashes fluttering slightly.\nIt\u2019s way better than Kirishima had ever imagined, and he\u2019s hit suddenly with how much he  wants  this. Over the past few months, he was so focused on his stupid scale that he failed to notice just how much his feelings were growing with every passing interaction him and Bakugou had. With every civil conversation, every study session, every silent after-school walk to the store to get drinks and snacks. Sure, Kirishima knew it was  there , deep in his chest, swirling around in his heart, but now that he physically has Bakugou in his arms, beneath the palms of his hands, it\u2019s so, so much better than he could\u2019ve ever predicted it would be.\nBakugou pulls back with a gasp, once Kirishima\u2019s hands have migrated from his face down to his hips, fingertips slipping underneath to touch bare skin.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bakugou blurts suddenly, his face flushed with exertion and something else. It looks like he\u2019s trying his best not to scowl, his brows twitching as he clears his throat and averts his eyes. His hands are pressed flat against Kirishima\u2019s chest.\nKirishima raises an eyebrow. \u201cYes...?\u201d\n\u201c Yes ,\u201d Bakugou mumbles, nails digging into Kirishima\u2019s collarbones. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll\u2026 go out with you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Kirishima breathes, sitting up slightly. \u201cOh,  fuck yes. Kaminari\u2019s gonna be - \u201d\n\u201cNevermind, I take it back,\u201d Bakugou deadpans, sitting up and shoving Kirishima off of him.\n\u201cNo,  no, babe,\u201d Kirishima whines, draping himself over Bakugou\u2019s back and winding his arms around his shoulders. \u201cI can call you that now, right? Babe? Baby? Sweetheart?\nBakugou\u2019s ears go red, his body going stiff as he tries to squirm out of Kirishima\u2019s grip. \u201c No,  you fuck, you can\u2019t call me  any of those things. Ever. What the fuck.\u201d\n\u201cHow about\u2026. Katsuki?\u201d\nImpossibly, Bakugou\u2019s ears turn even redder. His palms spark.\nKirishima grins into his neck.\nTen out of ten. Would  definitely woo again."
