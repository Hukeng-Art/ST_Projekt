I've been neglecting my original work for about . . . six months now . . . which is obviously a bit Not Good. That's going to be my next writing priority, but that's not to say I'm going to drop away from fan fiction entirely! I've got a prompt for another Merlin fic, my Not All Stories AU needs a conclusion, and my Untainted AU has at least one more potential installment waiting for it. </p>\n<p>Those could come at any time, although that least won't be at least until February.

I've loved writing for it, and the response has been amazing, but it's difficult to write for a fandom when your beta/brainstorm buddy has no experience with it.

Until then, happy reading!</p>\n<p>Damian's name's meaning comes from the meaning-of-names website. His name can actually mean a number of things. I went with the Indian meaning in MHR and mentioned the Greek because it fit there; here I chose the Spanish meaning because it was funnier.</p>\n<p>The idea for this can probably be traced back at least partially to Jessica Day George's Dragon Slippers. In it, dragons all want hoards but WHAT they hoard is widely individual. It might be shoes, or stained glass, or, if you're rather eccentric, dogs. But there's a moment when one dragon sees that another has a human in his cave and is horrified to think that the other dragon might have started to hoard humans.</p>\n<p>Then, years after I read the books, I'm writing MHR, and Bruce gets a bit possessive just as Tim is suggesting picking a draconic hero name based on his last name . . . And, well, this resulted.</p>\n<p>I'm marking this as two chapters because haven written this, there are a couple of missing scenes (mainly, exactly what went down when Bruce met his first three boys and possibly Stephanie) that I want to write.</p>\n<p>One last thing: I literally wrote just yesterday that I would probably never write Terry McGinnis because I am not qualified to do so and have no interest in becoming so. Then, today, I got the idea for his section, which goes to show that I should never say that I will never write something. I did my best to do some research to make this as in character as possible. If I failed horribly, just assume that living in a world with dragons profoundly affected him. Or pretend that he's a totally different character who just happens to share the name.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is now amazing fan art! https://jackgoodfellow.tumblr.com/post/678861455013117952/behold-bruce-wayne-the-dragon-and-his-majestic</p>",
    "text": "Alfred had hoped that the young master would hoard gold.\nBoth of his parents had hoarded it, after all; there was a large hoard of it already in the caves that made up their home, and the surrounding city-states still sent a tribute of it each year for lack of anyone telling them to stop. Providing him with sufficient amounts to keep him happy and healthy would have been relatively easy, and gold was gratifying simple to maintain.\nIt did have an unfortunate tendency to attract thieves, but now that the young master was nearing the end of adolescence, any who came would find themselves faced with a dragon more than prepared to defend the hoard. Even before that point, Alfred had prided himself on being a fairly efficient guard.\nGold would have been so simple.\nThese days, he was just hoping the young master would hoard anything at all. He was nearly out of adolescence; if he didn\u2019t form and fulfill the hoarding urge soon, he never would, and dragons who didn\u2019t maintain a healthy hoard had a distressing tendency to go mad in their latter years from lack of direction. Alfred had no desire to fail his charge that way.\nIt was just . . . Well, he wasn\u2019t qualified for this. He had been hired all those many, many years ago to be a liaison between the dragon lords of the Gotham Mountains and the human inhabitants and to help maintain the caves they lived in. That he was well qualified for and had done.\nHe had just never thought that both the master and mistress would fly off to do battle for their territory and never return. He had never thought he alone would be left to raise their hatchling. \nAnd as hard as he tried, Alfred very much feared that he was not at all qualified for that.\n\u00a0\nAlfred always fretted when the young master went out to patrol his territory. A forgivable failing all things considered.\nFor once, however, his alarm was not eased by the young master\u2019s return. The young master was holding something gently in his claws, something he was peering down anxiously at -\n\u201cIs that a child?\u201d Alfred demanded.\nThe young master looked up in relief. \u201cOh, Alfred, good. I need your help. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him. I breathed on him all the way here, but he\u2019s still so quiet - \u201c\nIt was a child. A small boy, to be exact. The young master had let go of him now, but he was still curled up in a small ball. There weren\u2019t any visible injuries on him, but his clothes were wet with half dried blood.\nAlfred sighed and knelt next to him. \u201cHello,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll just look you over, young sir, alright?\u201d\nThe boy might have given a small nod, but he was shaking so hard that Alfred couldn\u2019t be sure.\nHe checked him over quickly before standing back up and glaring at the young master. \u201cPhysically, he is fine, but as much good as dragon breath may do for ordinary injuries, I am afraid it does little for shock.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll be alright?\u201d the young master asked anxiously.\n\u201cEventually, yes.\u201d Alfred\u2019s glare intensified. \u201cNow please tell me you didn\u2019t kidnap the poor boy.\u201d\nThe young master reared back in shock. \u201cI found him! The bridge, the one over the chasm a few miles from here, got destroyed. It must have happened when his caravan was halfway across.\u201d He nudged the boy gently with his nose. The boy leaned into the warmth. \u201cHe was the only one I could find that was still - \u201c He cut off, looking down guiltily at the boy.\nStill alive, Alfred finished for him. He was ashamed of his assumption. \u201cAh. Well done then, young master. Have you discovered what was responsible?\u201d\nThe young master\u2019s eyes darkened. A few sparks darted out of his nose. \u201cA zucco. It was coming back just as I got there.\u201d A low growl was building in his chest. \u201cI took care of it.\u201d He nosed the boy again. \u201cIt won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d\nWith the boy in shock, the warmth of a dragon would do him a world of good, but perhaps a blanket would be comforting as well. Alfred would be glad to give up one of his own for the time being. And some supper, of course. The young master might be able to only eat once a week or so, but the boy would need something.\nHe hurried to retrieve the blanket. \u201cI\u2019m Alfred,\u201d he told the boy as he wrapped it gently around him.\nThe boy\u2019s shudders had eased. \u201cDick,\u201d he said quietly. He looked up at the dark dragon still hovering anxiously above him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nThe young master told him. Alfred gave the boy full credit for trying to repeat the long string of syllables, but Alfred had been trying for years. Some dragon names were simply beyond human tongues.\nDick latched onto the first syllable and the hiss in the middle. \u201cBruce,\u201d he decided. \u201cI\u2019m going to call you Bruce.\u201d\nThe young master didn\u2019t seem to have an objection, so that, Alfred supposed, was that.\nHe might even grow rather fond of it himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going into town today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \nAlfred looked up from the breakfast he was preparing. \u201cI had intended to,\u201d he agreed. He nodded to their still sleeping guest. \u201cDo you need me to change my plans?\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely sure just how long Dick would be with them, or what the young master\u2019s plans were. Presumably, he would take him to one of the city-states so he could be cared for - Sir Gordon\u2019s perhaps, the man could be trusted to handle the situation, and he was the closest - but the young master might think the boy could use a few days in relative solitude first.\nThe young master shook his head. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d fetch the gold for you.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be very kind, thank you.\u201d Dare he hope that the young master was starting to take a more possessive view of the gold?\nBut when the young master returned, it was with more than Alfred would need. \n\u201cI won\u2019t need quite that much, I don\u2019t believe.\u201d\nThe young master looked at him with those wide blue eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019ll need more than usual to get things for Dick.\u201d\nAlfred was starting to feel a bit of concern. \u201cFood for the next few days, you mean?\u201d he asked cautiously.\nThe young master nodded and then continued on. \u201cAnd some more clothes and bedding, of course, and anything else he needs. Some toys, maybe? He\u2019s still small enough for those, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nThe feeling of dread was growing. \u201cJust how long do you intend for him to stay?\u201d\nThe young master appeared confused by the question. \u201cHe\u2019s staying.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Alfred agreed. \u201cBut for how long?\u201d\nHis tail lashed in agitation. \u201cHe\u2019s staying,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHis parents are gone. He\u2019s going to stay.\"\n\u201c . . . Permanently?\u201d Alfred asked, dread heavy in his stomach now.\nThe word seemed to settle the young master somewhat. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, relieved that Alfred understood. \nAlfred prayed this wasn\u2019t what he thought it was. \u201cChildren need to be around others of their kind,\u201d he said carefully.\nThe young master appeared confused by this. \u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he pointed out.\nAnd look how that\u2019s turned out, Alfred thought despairingly.\n\u201cBesides, you\u2019re here.\u201d\nAlfred was hardly a substitute for the entirety of human society, particularly considering his own history. \u201cHe cannot stay,\u201d Alfred said firmly.\nThe young master\u2019s wings rose in a subconscious effort to make himself look bigger. His tail was lashing in earnest now. \u201cHe will.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying?\u201d a small voice asked. Dick had woken up at some point in their conversation and had wandered over. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Alfred said in one last attempt to salvage the situation.\nBut the boy had thrown his arms around the young master\u2019s leg and was clinging to it. \u201cThank you, Bruce.\u201d\nThe young master - Master Bruce, Alfred supposed with a sigh - wrapped his wings around his protectively. \nOn the bright side, Alfred supposed, at least Master Bruce had found something to hoard.\nOn the downside, this was not what he\u2019d had in mind.\n\u00a0\nThe situation was concerning for a number of reasons. A dragon\u2019s cave was hardly a prime location to raise a young boy, for one thing, and for another, an inclination to hoard living things rarely ended well for the dragon in question. Or for the humans involved, for that matter.\nBut four years passed without Master Bruce bringing home anyone else, and Master Dick seemed happy enough. Alfred did his best to educate him, and Master Bruce had been happy to outfit the cave with the equipment to help Master Dick keep up his acrobatic skills and to provide anything else he wanted or needed. He even bit back his protests at Master Dick joining Alfred on his trips to the village, although he was always anxious the whole time they were gone.\nAlfred had hoped that hiring young Mistress Gordon, a warrior well on her way to equalling her famous father, to teach Master Dick to fight would help ease Master Bruce\u2019s concerns.\nInstead, he was beginning to see hints that Master Bruce was starting to consider her his as well which was rather alarming all around.\nAs such, his first reaction to seeing Master Bruce return from patrol with a wildly struggling figure held gently in his claws was relief that it wasn\u2019t Mistress Gordon. Her kidnapping would put a strain on their relation with Sir Gordon\u2019s city, to say the least.\nHis second reaction was shame at his first and growing concern at the situation. He ran over.\n\n\u201dMaster Bruce!\u201d\n\nMaster Bruce released the boy from his claws rather guiltily. The boy immediately scrambled out of immediate claw reach. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, alright! I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d Master Bruce said.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you said,  right before you took me back to your cave to eat me.\u201d\nAlfred had a headache forming. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d\n\u201cI found him in the Narrows,\u201d Master Bruce said.\nThe Narrows. The crime ridden waste of a city-state that the master\u2019s parents had died defending. Alfred\u2019s headache intensified. \u201cThere are many young boys in the Narrows. May I ask what this one did to draw your attention?\u201d\n\u201cI gave it back,\u201d the boy said instantly. His gaze kept darting to the cave entrance. Alfred was fairly certain that only Master Bruce\u2019s bulk blocking most of it kept him from making a run for it.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s installed a new perch for me,\u201d Master Bruce explained. \u201cOne with some copper ornaments attached. Jason took one.\u201d\nAlfred looked over at the boy. His grimy clothes hung loose around a rather thin frame.\n\u201cI was hungry,\u201d Jason said defensively. \u201cThat thing would have kept me fed for a month. You hadn\u2019t even seen it yet. I thought you wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\nNonetheless, stealing from a dragon took a certain amount of backbone. \u201cDare I hope that your indignation arose over a sudden desire to hoard copper?\u201d\nHe held out very, very little hope for this, but he still felt he had to try.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the copper,\u201d Master Bruce said impatiently. \u201cHe can keep it. But he was freezing out there, Alfred, and he\u2019s obviously starving. I couldn\u2019t just leave him.\u201d\nThe cave, like most dragon inhabited structures, was unnaturally warm. The weather outside it was, admittedly, not.\nMaster Dick had emerged from one of the side tunnels at some point in the discussion and had bounded over to Jason. \u201cAre you staying here now? Cool!\u201d\nJason\u2019s eyes darted warily between the three of them. \u201c . . . Staying here? So you\u2019re not gonna eat me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Master Bruce said.\n\u201cBruce doesn\u2019t eat people,\u201d Master Dick said, clearly horrified. \n\u201cSo why am I here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome here!\u201d Master Dick said, which did not actually answer the question, Alfred thought sourly. \u201cAlfred makes the best food, and Babs is teaching me how to fight, and I\u2019ve got this really cool set up back here, let me show you - \u201c The young master dragged the other boy off.\n\u201cHis parents are dead,\u201d Master Bruce said a moment after they had disappeared. \u201cHe needs a home. And you keep saying Dick needs company.\u201d He peered after them. \u201cHe seemed happy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nAlfred stared at him for a long moment before stalking off to prepare supper. Perhaps if it was substandard, the boy would be less inclined to stay, and Alfred could nail into Master Bruce\u2019s head exactly what he was doing wrong.\n\u00a0\nDick\u2019s set up was pretty cool, Jason had to admit. Even with all his experience breaking into places in the Narrows, and even though he had to be at least a couple of years older than the kid, he couldn\u2019t do half the things Dick could on it.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure how seriously to take Dick\u2019s offer to teach him.\nAnother set of items drew his attention, though.\nBooks.\nThere was a small stack of them in a corner of the room, next to a chest that might contain clothes and a pile of blankets that looked like they\u2019d be perfect for nesting in. Jason couldn\u2019t help gravitating toward them.\nMom hadn\u2019t been able to teach him much, but her family had been better off when she was young, and she\u2019d at least been able to teach Jason to read out of the lone, ragged book they had left.\nThese were nothing like that.\n\u201cAlfred\u2019s been using them to teach me history and stuff,\u201d Dick said cheerfully from behind him. \u201cYou like to read?\u201d\nJason\u2019s shoulders hunched defensively, but the older boy didn\u2019t seem to be mocking him. \u201cWhen I can,\u201d he finally said.\nDick\u2019s grin was blinding. \u201cGreat! Alfred\u2019ll finally have a good pupil then. I can never sit still for as long as he wants.\u201d \nHaving seen the insane flips Dick was doing just a minute ago, Jason could believe it.\n\u201cAnd once you\u2019ve read through all the ones here, I\u2019m sure Bruce\u2019ll buy you some more.\u201d\nJason eyed the other kid warily. \u201cWhat exactly does he want us for, anyway?\u201d\nDick shrugged. \u201cAlfred thinks he\u2019s hoarding us, but I don\u2019t think two people really count as a hoard, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think I know anything about the hoarding practices of dragons.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d Dick flipped back and caught himself with his hands so that he was standing on his head. \u201cI think he\u2019s lonely.\u201d\n\u201c . . . Huh.\u201d Jason looked around the cave again. It looked comfortable. Fun, even.\nAnd it was warm which was already more than he could say for his squat in the Narrows.\nAnd there were those books, waiting tantalizingly in reach.\n\u201cSupper!\u201d\nDick flipped back to his feet and flashed another grin at Jason before running for the door. Jason followed after only a momentary hesitation.\nSupper was delicious. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this is the best thing I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d\nJason wasn\u2019t sure why the old guy looked pained at that. His mouth hadn\u2019t been full or anything.\n\u201cI told you it was great,\u201d Dick said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe dragon . . . Bruce . . . looked up at that.\nAnd, well, he wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint a dragon. And besides, this was honestly a better situation than anything he could have gotten in the Narrows.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\nThe old guy sighed.\n\u00a0\nThe third time it happened, Alfred was forced to admit that this was a pattern. This one, at least, wasn\u2019t struggling. Instead, he was sitting very still in the protective cage of Master Bruce\u2019s claws.\nWhen he was gently set down, it only took one look to confirm that this was no starving street child.\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s better than bringing home a princess, sir. We wouldn\u2019t want to grow cliche.\u201d \nThe boy wilted a bit under Alfred\u2019s stare as he staggered to his feet. Flight sickness or something else?\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Master Pennyworth.\u201d The poor boy was desperately pale, save for a feverish flush across his cheeks.\nThen the rest caught up with him. \u201cI see Master Bruce has already told you about me. And you are quite welcome to call me Alfred, young sir.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no. I heard about you from some of the traders who came from Gotham - \u201d The boy cut himself off, flushing deeper. \u201cBut. Um. You don\u2019t want to know about that. I\u2019m Tim, by the way.\u201d This speech was apparently too much, and the boy broke into a coughing fit. Alfred winced at the deep, hacking coughs.\nMaster Bruce hovered anxiously, huffing warm, healing breaths over him. \u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d he told Alfred. \u201cThe breath isn\u2019t helping enough. You know how it is with illnesses.\u201d\nAlfred did. The boys had been mother henned by both of them through several illnesses because of it.\nAlfred conceded defeat and smiled at Tim. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel better once you lie down somewhere warm, and we get some soup in you.\u201d\nTim hurried to scoop up a leather satchel Alfred hadn\u2019t noticed before and walked towards him. \u201cThank you, M - Alfred.\u201d\nAs he got closer, Alfred could better see the device pinned to Master Timothy\u2019s clearly insufficient cloak. \nThe Drake family crest. Well, there was some irony, Alfred thought wryly, made even more perfect by the boy\u2019s hinted at previous interest in dragons - \n\u201cTimothy Drake?\u201d he asked incredulously.\nThe boy froze. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \nMaster Bruce growled warningly, but Alfred ignored him. \u201cI was under the impression you were your family\u2019s sole heir.\u201d\n\u201cI was,\u201d Tim admitted, \u201cbut Father\u2019s remarried recently, and my stepmother\u2019s young enough that getting another one shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I was never . . . quite what my father wanted in any case, so things are probably better this way.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me,\u201d Alfred asked, tone very dangerous now as he slowly turned to Master Bruce, \u201cthat your family is still alive?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Tim was looking between the two of them, plainly anxious now. \u201cI understand why you\u2019re angry, but we really couldn\u2019t scrape the tribute together this year, we didn\u2019t mean any disrespect - \u201d\nAlfred remembered, vaguely, that one city\u2019s payment hadn\u2019t come in this year. Master Bruce had gone to check on the city out of a concern that it might be under attack, not to extract the gold; with the amount Master Bruce\u2019s parents had hoarded, they were set for several human lifetimes even if they never received another coin.\nAlfred could see it all too plainly. Master Bruce had never been the most tactful of creatures. He would have come flying straight in, someone would have read too much into his questions, and in an attempt to appease an angry dragon, they had offered Tim up.\nAnd Master Bruce had accepted him.\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d His voice had gone deathly quiet now.\nBut Master Bruce did not appear ashamed. Instead, he was swelling up in anger. \u201cThey left him out there,\u201d he hissed. \u201cThey left him out there on the wall, chained up like a dog for three days. If I hadn\u2019t come when I did, who knows how long they would have let it go on?\u201d\nThat . . . did rather put a different spin on things.\n\u201cWhat, exactly, happened?\u201d he asked wearily.\nTim jumped into the tale. \u201cWe started getting reports of a basilisk roaming around near the city. When it became obvious that it wasn\u2019t going to pass us by, we started getting desperate. We sent out knights to try to kill it, but . . \u201d He shrugged helplessly.\n\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t think I would come,\u201d Master Bruce said grimly.\nTim nodded. \u201cWe broke the contract. If we\u2019d had the money, we would have sent it then, but,\u201d he took a shuddering breath, \u201cit had been a bad year all around. But, well,\u201d He bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019ve always been . . . interested . . . in dragons.\u201d He hugged his satchel a little tighter. \u201cSo I collected all the stories on you that I could, because you were the closest and because the way you dealt with that trickster was really cool, and - \u201d The tips of his ears turned red and he hurried on. \u201cAnyway. People have known for a while about Dick, and I\u2019d heard more recently about Jason, and there are a couple of rumors about how you act around them that made it . . . kind of obvious that you were hoarding them. And I fit the profile, and it was my idea, so I volunteered.\u201d\n\u201cAnd his father let him,\u201d Master Bruce snarled. \u201cAnd let them chain him up outside with winter coming on.\u201d\nTim flinched a little at the reminder. \u201cThey were afraid I\u2019d change my mind when you got close,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d He rubbed at his wrists absently, and Alfred was horrified to see that they were rubbed raw.\nTim noticed the direction of his gaze and got defensive. \u201cI didn\u2019t get scared,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get free, it\u2019s just - The metal got really cold at night. It was hard to get comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cQuite.\u201d Alfred had a headache coming on.\nTim moved on quickly. \u201cAnyway, Bruce took out the basilisk, so now the city\u2019s safe, my father\u2019s free to get a new heir, and Bruce gets something new for his hoard. Everyone wins.\u201d He paused for a second. \u201cExcept for the basilisk, I guess.\u201d\n\nYes, but what about you?\n\nMaster Bruce\u2019s attention had caught on another part of that horrifying statement. \u201cSomeone. Someone new to take care of, not something.\u201d His giant head nudged Tim gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you got meet the others? I know they\u2019ll be happy to meet someone new.\u201d\nTim looked a bit confused, but he did as he was told.\nThe moment he was out of sight, all of Master Bruce\u2019s rage bubbled to the surface. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve him,\u201d he growled.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Alfred agreed with a sigh. \u201cI suppose we shall have to strive to provide a better home for the boy.\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d The young master brooded darkly for a long moment. Alfred went to start supper, knowing from experience that this could take a while.\nMaster Bruce interrupted him, though. \u201cAlfred?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you always assume I kidnapped them?\u201d There was a slightly hurt tone in his voice.\nTechnically, of course, he rather had, but - \u201cIf you knew the stories of what your father got up to his youth when his hoarding instinct first struck, you wouldn\u2019t be asking me that question,\u201d Alfred said wryly.\nMaster Bruce perked up. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cThat is not justification for anything you might be cooking up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\nThe other boys had accepted his presence far more easily than Tim had feared. Frankly, he was relieved just to see them up close, whole and seemingly happy, even if they were a bit younger than he had expected. He had hoped so, based on the rumors, but he hadn\u2019t been sure. Tales of dragons hoarding humans didn\u2019t always . . . end well.\nIn comparison to what he had feared, a little curiosity about what was in his satchel was fine, but he still blushed a little when he saw Jason start to flip through it. \u201cIt\u2019s, um, my sketchbook. I think Stephanie managed to put the rest in here too . . \u201d He rummaged through the bag and emerged triumphant with the little bag of drawing supplies.\n\u201cStephanie, huh?\u201d Dick asked with a knowing grin on his face.\nTim\u2019s face grew hotter. \u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cShe snuck this out to me once everything was . . . decided. She wanted to try and get me loose, but she didn\u2019t exactly have enough to bribe the guards to ignore that.\u201d\n\u201cGood friends, then,\u201d Dick said. He peered over Jason\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, is that her? She looks cute.\u201d\nWhile Tim had considered the possibility that he might die in the next few days, he hadn\u2019t thought it would be of embarrassment. \nJason kept flipping through the book and got to one of the parts where Tim had tried to draw more interesting subjects than the things and people he saw every day.\nA firebird - he\u2019d actually seen one of those once, and had sketched it from memory - winged horses, like they had in the stables, a basilisk from the scattered reports they\u2019d received.\nAnd dragons. Always dragons.\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d Jason actually looked impressed.\nTim couldn\u2019t repress a small swell of pride. \u201cI had to base those off of what I saw in books,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten a closer look, I can see some of the mistakes I made. Do you think - Do you think Bruce would let me draw him?\u201d\n\u201cI think Bruce would absolutely let you draw him,\u201d Dick assured him, throwing an arm around his shoulders. \u201cThese are incredible. Hey, if I teach you how to do a triple flip, will you sketch me too?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll teach you that anyway,\u201d Jason informed him. \u201cHe literally can\u2019t help himself.\u201d\nDick made a face at him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Tim said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll need to try and get it right the first time, though. I don\u2019t have much space left.\u201d His paper would probably run out before the graphite did.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Jason assured him. \u201cBruce\u2019ll get you some more.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be any trouble . . . \u201c\nJason snorted. \nDick was the one to actually explain. \u201cBruce knows, like, intellectually that humans don\u2019t hoard, but on an emotional, instinctive level I\u2019m pretty sure he feels like he\u2019s depriving us if he doesn\u2019t help us build one. Which is why Jason has a small library, and I have an ever-growing obstacle course of acrobatic equipment. Drawing supplies won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d \nTim . . . did not know how to respond to that.\nDick had apparently grown tired of letting Jason be the one to set the pace on the drawing examination, because he\u2019d tugged it out of his hands and was flipping through the pages himself. He paused on one of the last ones - a picture of him with his parents that was more based on fantasy than reality. He\u2019d drawn it just before volunteering his plan.\nDick paused on it. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked quietly.\nTim hadn\u2019t told them the full story, and after how badly it had upset Alfred, he didn\u2019t really want to. Not tonight at least. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019ll miss me,\u201d he evaded.\nWell - Stephanie might. But she\u2019d move on soon enough.\n\u00a0\nThe fourth time Master Bruce arrived with someone grimly gripping his claws, Alfred decided he had earned the benefit of the doubt. Thus it was not with judgement but with wry resignation that he stepped forward.\n\u201cAnd who is this young lady?\u201d\nShe slipped free of the master\u2019s grip almost immediately. Her hands were clenched into fists, which was . . . concerning . . . but Alfred was relieved to see that she was in plain, functional clothes. Still not kidnapping princesses, then. Her pack suggested that she\u2019d had time to prepare, even - \n\u201cWhere\u2019s Tim?\u201d she demanded. \n- or perhaps that she had been already traveling when she was caught. \nFortunately, that question was quickly answered. The boys, it appeared, had been close enough to hear Master Bruce\u2019s return, unlike the last two times a new arrival had come. Masters Dick and Jason came running in with Master Tim a slightly shy half-step behind them.\n\u201cBruce! You\u2019re back!\u201d Master Dick crashed into Master Bruce\u2019s leg and held onto it tightly. Master Jason was already climbing up onto his favorite perch on Master Bruce\u2019s shoulder. Master Bruce practically radiated relieved contentment. His tail, much longer now than when this whole endeavor had started, stretched out to curl around Master Tim.\nFor once, though, Master Bruce did not have Master Tim\u2019s full and undivided attention. Instead, he was staring, gape-mouthed, at the girl.\n\n\u201dStephanie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dead!\u201d she cheered and ran forward to throw her arms around him.\nMaster Tim\u2019s arms came up a half second late, but he held on just as strongly. \u201cWhat happened? What are you doing here? Something else didn\u2019t attack, did it?\u201d\nStephanie finally let go and stepped back a bit, looking a touch sheepish. \u201cNo. The city\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t heard anything about you, and I was worried, and no one else was going to do anything - they actually held a funeral for you, if you can believe that - so I decided I had to try and find the dragon\u2019s cave.\u201d\n\u201c . . . And then what?\u201d Master Tim asked somewhat dubiously, his eyes flicking to the tiny knife Alfred had not previously noticed that was shoved into her belt.\nStephanie\u2019s face went red. \u201cYou try buying weaponry on a maid\u2019s salary.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were going to fight a dragon with a dinner knife?\u201d Alfred asked incredulously.\nStephanie bit her lip. \u201cI was planning to sneak past him actually. Until he - \u201d Here she gestured violently at Master Bruce - \u201cspotted me on the road and wanted to make sure I was alright.\u201d\n\u201cTo be more accurate, I spotted a man trying to rob her,\u201d Master Bruce said dryly. \u201cBy the time I had dived down to intervene, she had taken him down by hitting him repeatedly with a rock.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . might have forgotten I had a knife.\u201d\nThey\u2019d have to train that out of her, Alfred thought before he caught himself. \u201cAnd what do your parents think of your little adventure?\u201d\nStephanie\u2019s mouth twisted sourly. \u201cMy dad\u2019s in jail pretty much indefinitely, and I don\u2019t really care what he thinks. And Mom - \u201c She took a deep breath and started again. \u201cThe plague finally caught up to her two years ago.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a healer in the lower town,\u201d Master Tim explained quietly. \u201cStephanie was supposed to follow in her footsteps, but she never got the chance to finish her apprenticeship.\u201d\nThus becoming a maid, Alfred assumed. With the Drakes, presumably, and from there an unlikely friendship must have bloomed.\nAn incredibly strong friendship, if it had led her out here, which brought them to the next point. \u201cAnd what are your plans now that you see that Master Tim needs neither rescuing nor avenging?\u201d\nFor the first time Stephanie looked truly uncertain. \u201cI . . . might not have thought that far ahead. At this point, I don\u2019t think I can get my job back. I might have . . . said some things.\u201d\n\u201cShe should stay here!\u201d Dick said brightly.\nMaster Bruce failed to look at all surprised by this suggestion, and, instead, looked rather satisfied. One might even go so far as to say that he looked pleased with himself.\nJust for that, Alfred shot him a look.\n\u00a0\nStephanie wasn\u2019t at all sure about this, really, but she was still a little worried about Tim, and she didn\u2019t have any better ideas, so she figured she should at least stay for a couple of days.\nNightfall did present a question, though. \n\u201cWhere do we sleep?\u201d She supposed it probably wouldn\u2019t really be a problem to sleep in the same room as the boys since she trusted Tim and both of the other boys looked younger than him, but she wanted to know.\n\u201cWhen Bruce is gone, we all sleep back here,\u201d Tim said, leading her to a corner of one of the smaller caves that basically looked like a giant nest of fluffy blankets. \u201cBut when he\u2019s here, we\u2019ve got something better.\u201d He grinned at her and grabbed several blankets to dump in her arms before grabbing more for himself. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nHe led her back into the main cave where the dragon - Bruce, she reminded herself - was curled up to sleep. The little kid, Dick, had already claimed a spot on his back, and Jason was tucked into a little ball on his shoulder.\nTim was laying his blankets on the curled up tail. \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable than it looks,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really warm.\u201d\nWhich up in the mountains would be good in all seasons, she conceded. She\u2019d suffered through some viciously cold nights on her way here.\nHesitantly, she laid her blankets down next to Tim\u2019s. Curling up in them was more comfortable than she expected, but it was kind of strange too, so she reached out and grabbed Tim\u2019s hand. Just to make sure she didn\u2019t fall off in the night or something.\nTim went absolutely still for a moment before squeezing her hand. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you came,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re not dragon chow,\u201d she whispered back.\nTim huffed a laugh. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTheir next addition, like Mistress Stephanie, was not entirely Master Bruce\u2019s fault.\nIt was, of course, still mostly Master Bruce\u2019s fault, but not entirely. It started, after all, while he was on patrol.\nWhen Alfred first noticed there were small bits of food missing, he thought little of it. He assumed that one of the children had simply gotten hungry.\nIt was only when Master Bruce returned and immediately tensed at the smell of an intruder in the cave that Alfred realized they had a problem on their hands.\nA problem that would be easier to deal with if Master Bruce was not wrapped around the children and growling.\nOr, at the very least, if Alfred was not trapped in the middle of it too.\n\u201cMaster Bruce,\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cI agree that this is most unsettling, but considering that they took the food and left both the gold and the children alone, it seems that we have a most unusual intruder on our hands. If they meant any harm, surely they would have done it already.\u201d\nIt took an unfortunate amount of time, but at last Alfred was able to convince him of this, and Master Bruce slowly unwound.\nAnd it seemed that in the interval he\u2019d had time to think.\n\u201cJust the food,\u201d he confirmed.\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\nMaster Bruce\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cThen perhaps it\u2019s time to set a trap.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe had anticipated many possibilities when he set the trap. Some supernatural being intent on mischief that was able to slip invisible into his cave. One of the al Ghul\u2019s Dragon Guard come to punish him for some offense by plotting to hurt those that were his, his to protect, his to cherish, his to care for -\nThe seething ball of rage in his chest had burned all the hotter at the possibility.\nHe had not anticipated a girl.\nShe was young. Small. If the little one had come to do harm, then surely it was not of her own volition.\nShe used the netting she was caught in to raise herself up slowly. Dark eyes, wide with confusion, blinked up at him from behind a mess of tangled black hair. From what he could see through the furs she\u2019d wrapped around herself, she was thinner than even Jason had been when he had first been found.\nJust the food.\nHe was gentler than he had intended to be. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nThe girl just let out a soft keening sound and reached for the food that had been used to bait the trap.\n\u201cIn a few minutes,\u201d he promised her.\nShe made the sound again, except - \nExcept it wasn\u2019t just a noise, Bruce realized suddenly. He\u2019d heard that sound before from warg pups who were begging their parents for food.\nHe did his best to mimic the call he\u2019d heard repeatedly during the years the rain was scarce.\n\nLater. Later.\n\nThe girl sagged sadly, but she didn\u2019t make the keening noise again.\nShe\u2019d understood.\nWhat had happened to this girl? Where was her family? Why hadn\u2019t they protected her?\nHe tried to replicate the long call that wargs used when an unfamiliar warg approached. When it failed to elicit anything more than confusion, he tried again.\n\nWho are you? Whose pack are you from? Are you foe or friend?\n\nThe girl bared her neck and made a small, puppy like sound before making a sharp \u201ckuh\u201d sound followed by a hiss.\n\nFriend! Friend! Small! Harmless!\n\nThat, aside from the battle-sounds, the fear-sounds, and the dying-sounds, was about all he knew. He didn\u2019t know what that last bit might mean.\nUnless.\nHe brought up his tail and tapped himself on the chest. \u201cBruce.\u201d Then he tapped hers, ever so gently and repeated the sound she had made.\nShe repeated it, and then patted his tail. \u201cBruce,\u201d she said awkwardly.\nSo that sound was her name. Kuh-hiss. Kuhss. \nOr, to make her name more manageable as the children had made his, \u201cCass,\u201d he tried, tapping her chest again.\n\u201cCass,\u201d she agreed. \u201cCass, Bruce.\u201d Then she made the hopeful keening sound again.\nDespite what she said, she wasn\u2019t completely harmless, and he knew it. If she\u2019d been raised by wargs, then she must be able to fight and fight viciously. He\u2019d have to watch her carefully when she was with the others.\nBut he couldn\u2019t just let her go back into the wild. She was obviously starving, she was covered in scratches, and she was just so small.\nHe used his claws to cut the netting and then carefully lowered her down. She scampered over to the food immediately and began shoving it in her mouth.\nHe curled up in front of the cave entrance so that he could be sure she wouldn\u2019t run off once she finished. He kept his eyes fixed on her.\nSo small. So precious.\nHe exhaled long, warm breaths over her and felt instant relief when the cuts, even the angry red one that might be infected, immediately began to heal.\nCass looked up immediately and made a noise he didn\u2019t know how to interpret. She tried it again when he didn\u2019t respond before hesitantly reaching out to touch his scales.\nHe leaned into the touch.\nCass made a happy noise, and this one, he realized, he knew.\n\nPack.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he rumbled. Pack.\nShe was part of his now, and he\u2019d take far better care of her than her last one.\n\u00a0\nAs resigned as Alfred had become to the fact that they would periodically be adding new people to the cave, he hadn\u2019t expected to ever reach a point where he would miss the moment human children were brought in.\nThat was before the point a dragon child showed up.\nAn adolescent, Master Bruce could have simply chased away, but this was truly a child. There was no possibility that he could have flown this far; if someone had not carried him, then he must have made it to the cave in a series of short, gliding flights and jumps.\nAnd he knew the distance had been far because while the little dragonet might have had his father\u2019s rare black scales, he had his mother\u2019s viciously green eyes.\nAnd at least something of her temperament, more\u2019s the pity.\nAll of which he registered later. What happened first occurred as the children\u2019s lessons under Mistress Barbara devolved into a mass play-fight, as if they were warg pups instead of civilized children.\nWell. Mostly civilized children.\nWhat happened first was that Master Timothy ducked out of the fight, still laughing, hands up in temporary surrender so that he could run and get some water from the jug Alfred kept on the other side of the clearing so that was safely out of the way of the children\u2019s exertions.\nWhat happened was that as he did so, a little black dragonet pounced from an unseen perch in a tree and snapped down on his shoulder in an impatient bite.\nMaster Tim\u2019s scream was not a sound Alfred was ever likely to forget.\nGiven more warning, Master Tim might could have won the fight, but he had no room to move now, and blood was pouring out of him at an awful rate. Alfred raced forward, the sword he was never without when they left the safety of the cave already drawn.\nThe children turned, only a little slower, and then let out screeching war cry and ran forward. \nIf any more of them got hurt, Master Bruce was going to be furious.\nAlfred leaped forward and used his momentum to ram the beast\u2019s shoulder. If he could just get him off Master Tim, could just keep him from taking another, potentially fatal, bite - \nThe dragonet was light enough to be moved by the force, but Master Tim let out another cry of pain as the claws raked over him. The other children were there in another instant, leaping on the dragonet and pinning his wings, bashing at him with their practice weapons. Mistress Cass was tearing at the vulnerable membrane with her teeth, Mistress Barbara was lunging forward to try and get the eye - \nA terrible roar shook the trees. Master Bruce landed with a thump that rattled the ground. \nEveryone froze.\nMore snarls ripped their way out of his throat. The children rolled off the intruder and hurriedly backed away.\n\u201cWhat. Have. You. Done?\u201d\nThe dragonet shrank against the ground. \u201cI was hungry.\u201d\n\u201cSo you tried to eat a person? So you tried to take one that is mine?\u201d Master Bruce pinned him to the ground with one clawed foot and held him there with contemptuous ease. His voice was considerably gentler when he turned to Master Tim. \u201cTim?\u201d\nMaster Tim\u2019s breath was coming in little shuddering sobs. A whole chunk of his shoulder was just gone.\n\u201cShh. It\u2019s alright. You\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Master Bruce kept a steady stream of soft words over the boy, each puff of warm breath slowing the blood loss and mending the jagged hole. \u201cI got here as soon as I could, Tim. I should have come with you out here, but it\u2019s alright now. It won\u2019t happen again. You\u2019re alright.\u201d\nThe hole was gone, but not even dragon breath could fix everything. Master Tim was still pale with blood loss and the memory of pain. His breathing was beginning to be a bit steadier.\n\u201cThere you go. That\u2019s better.\u201d Master Bruce reached out a clawed hand and cradled the boy close. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fixed?\u201d Stephanie checked.\n\u201cAs much as can be,\u201d Alfred assured her. \u201cMistress Barbara, perhaps you should escort the others back to the cave.\nThe young woman - and goodness, it was hard to remember that she was a woman now, despite the fact that she looked a few years younger than her real age - nodded and began to herd the reluctant mass of children back to the safety of the cave.\nMistress Cass refused to leave. Instead, she sat crouched as she hadn\u2019t for months now, growling a threat at the small dragon still trapped under Master Bruce\u2019s claws.\nAlfred sighed. Well, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let her stay since Master Bruce was here to handle the situation.\nWhen the children had disappeared from view, Master Bruce let the dragonet up just enough that he could look at him. \u201cExplain,\u201d he growled.\nGiven the fact that Master Bruce had yet to take him by the neck and shake some sense into him, and considering Master Bruce\u2019s intelligence, Alfred later suspected that Master Bruce had already guessed.\nThe little dragonet shook the grass off and tried to raise himself into a proud posture. \u201c I am - \u201d He let loose the usual rockfall sound of a dragon name. \u201cSon of - \u201d The next name was no more repeatable, but it was familiar.\nThe favored daughter of the al Ghul clan. Alfred suspected that the children would simplify her name to something starting with a \u2019t.\u2019 Talia, perhaps.\nThe next bit, however, was more concerning. \u201cMy grandsire grows old. He wishes to prepare me for the high magics that I may be his next vessel.\u201d He drooped a little. \u201cMy mother, however, believes me unworthy of this honor. She sent me here.\u201d\nAlfred rather doubted that worthiness had been what plagued Talia\u2019s mind. Remnants of conscience, perhaps, or a mother\u2019s love.\n\u201cThe egg.\u201d Master Bruce\u2019s eyes had narrowed to slits. \u201cShe told me the egg was broken.\u201d\n\u201cShe did not wish to,\u201d the dragonet said defensively. \u201cGrandsire did not want you to know of me. He feared you would interfere with his purpose.\u201d\n\u201cSo instead she raised you in that place of death,\u201d Master Bruce spat. \u201cAnd taught you to kill when you did not have to.\u201d\nThe dragonet shrank back even as he tried to pretend he didn\u2019t.\nMaster Bruce took a deep breath. \u201cYou are staying here.\u201d It was half statement, half order. \u201cYou will not harm any of the others again. You will apologize, sincerely, to Tim. And if your grandsire comes anywhere near here, I will rip him to shreds.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe had no wish to offend his sire further - his earlier mistake was still heavy on him - so he had not intended to provoke further hostilities when he curled up at the base of his sire\u2019s neck when it was time to sleep.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dick\u2019s place,\u201d one of the little humans said. Jason, possibly. His jaw was set like he was ready to fight. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep there.\u201d\nThe littlest one, Dick, presumably, just tilted his head in consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll just sleep on Bitey instead.\u201d\nAnd then the boy promptly climbed on top of him!\nOutrage seemed too weak a word. He was tempted to shake the insolent boy off, but his sire was already tensing, and he had no desire to provoke him further.\nDick leaned down and patted his sire\u2019s scales. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure something else out tomorrow. Won\u2019t we, Bitey?\u201d\n\u201cDo not call me that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we have to call you something,\u201d the boy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pronounce your real name any better than we can pronounce Bruce\u2019s.\u201d\nA sleepy voice called up from his father\u2019s tail. \u201cAs the one he took a bite of, I think I should get to name him.\u201d\n\u201cFair point,\u201d Dick conceded. \u201cAny objections?\u201d\n\n\u201dYes.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, it seemed none of the other imbecilic children did, so he was outnumbered. \n\u201cSo what\u2019s the verdict, Timbird?\u201d Jason called.\nTim was silent for a long moment before announcing, \u201cDamian.\u201d\n\u201cDamian?\u201d the girl beside him demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the perfect opportunity for revenge, and you choose Damian?\u201d\nBut even in the dark, the newly dubbed Damian could see that Jason was grinning. \u201cOh, I think the name Damian is a great revenge. \u2018Cause I\u2019m betting Tim knows what it means.\u201d\nDamian did not know what it meant. He refused to admit it.\nFortunately, the other girl made a questioning noise, and he did not have to.\n\u201cTame,\u201d Tim announced smugly. \u201cIt means tame.\u201d\nHe could have born the other\u2019s laughter better if he had not felt his sire\u2019s rumbling beneath him.\n\u00a0\nAfter that, well, the others failed to faze him much. Duke, Helena, Carrie - all were easy enough after that.\nEven when, as Master Duke did, they had questions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you know how when Jason got kidnapped Bruce went kind of crazy until he got him back?\u201d\nAlfred paused in the act of washing the plates. \u201cThat incident would be rather hard to forget.\u201d They had gotten him back quickly enough, and there had been no damage that Master Bruce\u2019s breath couldn\u2019t fix, but they had been a traumatizing few days all the same.\n\u201cHow\u2019s he going to handle it when we die?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d That was a relief. Alfred had been half afraid that Master Duke\u2019s previous statement had been some strange attempt into easing him into the news that there had been another abduction. He continued washing the plate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here for two years now. Haven\u2019t you ever wondered at Master Dick\u2019s age?\u201d\nMaster Duke frowned. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s not really growing a lot if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cImperceptibly,\u201d Alfred agreed. \u201cAnd have you noticed how in some ways he is treated as the oldest despite to all appearances being the youngest?\u201d\n\u201cI have a weird feeling about where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d\nAlfred smiled wryly. \u201cDragon breath cures many things, Master Duke. Not quite including mortality, but it does slow it down quite a bit.\u201d\n\u201cHow much are we talking here?\u201d he asked cautiously.\n\u201cHow old would you guess that I am?\u201d\n\u201cWell, before I would have guessed sixty or seventy-something. Now . . . over a hundred?\u201d\nAlfred laughed. \u201cMy boy,\u201d he said with amusement, \u201cI barely remember being a hundred.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe upside to not advertising where a dragon\u2019s cave was located was that it significantly cut down on the number of thieves who came looking for gold.\nThe downside to not advertising where Master Bruce\u2019s cave was located was that bandits there on other business didn\u2019t know to stay away.\nThat was a downside to both parties, really. It was an inconvenience to Master Bruce and the children, and it was a considerably greater one to the criminals involved.\nParticularly when those criminals had the nerve to style themselves after a certain trickster spirit that Master Bruce had thrown out of his territory after considerable bloodshed.\n\u00a0\nIt figured that his first trip out of Gotham that wasn\u2019t even vaguely shady was also going to be his last.\nTerry bolted up the winding mountain path, but his legs weren\u2019t going to hold out much longer. He might have the advantage of youth, but the men behind him were running on some kind of crazed power.\nWhich, knowing his luck, needed to be fueled by the blood of stupid teenagers who actually thought they could turn their lives around. Magic could be weird like that, couldn\u2019t it?\nIf he could just find a place to fight them before his legs gave out - Well, he would still die horribly, but he could at least die with a little self-respect. And possibly with enough breath to have actual last words instead of just last gasps.\nHe could just make out an opening in the rock up ahead. It was big, too big to hold them at, but at least it was something to aim for. Maybe it would narrow as it got deeper.\nIf he could make it that far.\nA figure dropped from the rocks above him and landed in a crouch right next to him, a long staff balanced in both hands.\nTerry skittered back, fists coming up to fight, but this wasn\u2019t one of the bandits. At least, he wasn\u2019t dressed like them.\n\u201cStop!\u201d the figure shouted. His voice was powerful enough that the bandits actually came to an abrupt halt for a moment.\nThen they came to the same realization Terry had: this kid was a couple of years younger than even he was.\nThey started to stalk forward. Slowly now, with that low, steady cackle building amongst them.\nThat was when the kid\u2019s face abruptly got kind of . . . dangerous. \u201cLast chance to leave the mountain,\u201d the boy warned, spinning the staff in his hands.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna stop,\u201d Terry warned. Not that the kid seemed inclined to back off, so Terry sucked in as many deep breaths as he could so he\u2019d be ready to fight.\nThe leader\u2019s smile was stretched unnaturally wide. \u201cYou really think you can kick us off your mountain, kid?\u201d He sneered on the word \u2018your.\u2019\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one whose laid claim to these mountains,\u201d the kid said calmly. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you would have known that.\u201d He let loose an ear piercing whistle.\nSuddenly, more kids were dropping from the rocks above them. All landed perfectly and with weapons in hand.\nMore importantly, two adolescent dragons dove from the sky with shrieks that split the air.\nAnd behind them, something was walking forward. Something that made the rocks on the path jump and the whole earth shudder a little beneath his feet. Something that cast a long shadow over them.\nTerry dared to take a quick glance back and promptly gulped.\nSuddenly the smaller dragons overhead seemed positively manageable.\nThe bandits, sensibly, ran. \n\u201cHelena,\u201d the nightmarishly large dragon ordered. One of the smaller dragons zipped after them, spitting flames to keep them running.\n\u201cBarbara may get to spring her trap today after all,\u201d the kid beside him said with satisfaction. \nThe other smaller dragon - although that was a really relative term - crashed down beside them. \u201cSpeaking of plans gone awry,\u201d it - he? - said sourly.\n\u201cThe rest of you weren\u2019t in place yet. I improvised.\u201d\n\u201cYou idiotically put yourself in pointless danger. The victim could have made it a bit further.\u201d\nTerry kind of resented that labeling. He just wasn\u2019t sure if he was up to arguing with a dragon about it.\nMaybe when he got the rest of his breath back.\n\u201cIs that caring I detect, Damian?\u201d The other kid was actually grinning at the dragon, and you know what? Maybe he should slip away while they were still distracted.\nNaturally, as soon as he took a step, the nightmare dragon looked down at him and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re the one who distracted the Jokerz from their usual habits.\u201d\n\u201cNot intentionally, believe me. Why don\u2019t I just get out of your way, and - \u201d\n\u201cNot while you\u2019re hurt, young man,\u201d an elderly voice said firmly. An old man appeared out from under the shadow of the dragon. \u201cThere\u2019s blood leaking out from under your sleeve there.\u201d\nHe\u2019d forgotten about that.\n\u201cAnd some water probably wouldn\u2019t go amiss either.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the water,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut after that, I\u2019ve really got to go. I was trying to lead those guys away from my girlfriend, and I need to go make sure she\u2019s alright.\u201d She\u2019d been injured, so he\u2019d been forced to hide her, run, and hope to lead them away from her. If it hadn\u2019t worked . . . \n\u201cIf you\u2019ll tell us where you left her, Damian can go check now,\u201d the big dragon offered. \u201cHe could get there far faster and bring her back here. If she is injured, we can help.\u201d Then he leaned forward and breathed on Terry, which was weird.\nRight up until he noticed that his arm didn\u2019t hurt anymore. \nOkay, maybe these guys could help. Now that he\u2019d calmed down some, and was thinking it through, Gotham had some kind of deal with the dragon in the mountains, right? He helped defend them and didn\u2019t eat people, and they sent up big wagons of stuff to his cave every year. Terry had never paid much attention to the details.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThat would help a lot. Maybe I can still get back to Matt before the city gates close tonight.\u201d\nSomething about this caught the dragon\u2019s interest. \u201cMatt?\u201d\n\u201cMy little brother.\u201d There couldn\u2019t be any harm in sharing that, could there? And he was kind of worried. Their neighbor had agreed to watch Matt for a couple of days while Terry was gone, but Terry wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d do when the time was up.\n\u201cWon\u2019t your parents watch him?\u201d The dragon\u2019s interest was definitely caught now.\nTerry winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a possibility anymore.\u201d \nOne of the taller kids, the one with a red hooded cloak, walked up behind and put an arm around him. \u201cNow you\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWelcome to the family, kid. I don\u2019t suppose the girlfriend\u2019s orphaned too? And what\u2019s this about a brother?\u201d\nIt had been hours since the zucco had been chased away by the big black dragon. Dick slowly uncurled from his hiding spot in the ruins of their wagon. His mother had thrown him clear of it, and he\u2019d caught hold of the slats of the bridge and held on until the whole thing stopped falling -\nDick froze in place until the horrible swooping sensation of the fall had faded enough for him to move again. The wagon had provided cover from the zucco, but he couldn\u2019t stay there forever. He had to get out and find the others. They had to be hurt or they would have found him by now.\nBright splotches of color dotted the floor of the ravine. The long half of the ruined bridge lay draped across the dirt. The short half swung in the breeze. \nThe little flutters caused by the wind were the only movement.\nDick moved slowly through the wreckage. He stopped when he got to his parents. They had been flung away from the wagon by the fall.\nNo one else was moving.\nDick curled up in a little ball by his dad. A small, choked sound worked its way out of his mouth. He clapped a hand over it instantly. The zucco could still come back.\nAnd if it did . . . Dick had seen a lot of dead things as their caravan travelled from place to place. He knew what animals did to bodies.\nThe soil of the ravine floor was loose. Sandy. He didn\u2019t have any good tools, but he could at least try.\nHe scooped up two handfuls of dirts in his small hands and determinedly poured them . . . down. He couldn\u2019t think any more specifically than that. He just had to keep moving, keep working, and not think.\nThe little choked noises kept trying to come, and his breathing felt kind of funny, but Dick just reached for more dirt.\n\u00a0\nThe zucco safely taken care of, Bruce flew back to the ravine. He\u2019d need to get a good look at the bridge so he could give the nearest prince a better idea of how to fix it.\nSeeing the remnants of the caravan below made him growl. They had been on his territory and thus under his protection. He should have stopped this.\nThe brooding thoughts were interrupted by a scrap of movement. He peered down.\nA little boy was moving slowly around two larger bodies. One of them was slowly being covered by a thin stream of dark earth. \n\nOh.\n\nThere were two stone cairns, slowly built with his own juvenile claws, covering the bodies of his parents. Alfred had been with him the whole time, but he had still felt alone.\nHe couldn\u2019t just leave the boy there. He couldn\u2019t. He could - he could help him with the burial. His claws could dig up masses of dirt far quicker, or he could carry down some of the readily available stones and build a cairn for the caravan. Yes. He should do that.\nThere was just enough room for his to fly down, so he dove down beside the boy.\nThere was nothing to say. He knew that. Nothing could possibly help. \nThe boy had jumped away at the sound of his landing, but he hadn\u2019t screamed. A second later, he had moved back, arms stretched back protectively around his parents\u2019 bodies. His eyes were wide, and his whole body was shaking, but he didn\u2019t move.\n\u201cI won\u2019t bother them,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll help if you want.\u201d\nThe boy had jumped again when he spoke, but then he nodded slowly. \n\u201cI can get stones if you like,\u201d he offered, and the boy nodded again.\nHe worked more slowly than he needed to. The boy needed time to say goodbye, and he needed - something. He wasn\u2019t sure what. He couldn\u2019t leave the boy in the ravine, that much was obvious, but he didn\u2019t want to leave him somewhere else either. His instincts were telling him it was important to keep the boy with him, but he wasn\u2019t yet sure why.\nThe boy\u2019s parents got a grave together. The rest, he gathered gently in his claws and laid out for a larger one. \nAs the hours wore on, the boy\u2019s eyes jumped warily to the top of the ravine. Eventually, he realized what was going on.\n\u201cThe Zucco\u2019s gone,\u201d he assured the boy. \u201cI took care of it.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s shoulders relaxed a bit as he got back to work. \nThere was blood on the boy\u2019s hands from scrapes, and he was concerned at the way the boy still hadn\u2019t spoken. He kept surreptitiously breathing on him, but although it fixed the scrapes, he still didn\u2019t talk.\nWhen the work was done, the boy looked around in bewilderment. \nObviously, he hadn\u2019t worked out what to do next. That was fine. He had a plan now. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back with me?\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe can come back tomorrow for anything you need.\u201d\nThe boy only hesitated briefly before nodding.\nThe anxiety in his chest calmed. Good. He couldn\u2019t fix this, but he could help. \nAnything that wanted to hurt the boy now was going to have to get through him.\n\u00a0\nFor the record, Jason had known stealing from a dragon was a bad idea, but he\u2019d been out of good options. He hadn\u2019t been able to turn anything else up for days, and if he stayed out in this cold much longer, he wasn\u2019t going to live to feel the spring\u2019s thaw. \nHe\u2019d been smart about it too. He\u2019d done it at night with the tools he needed to break one of the little ornaments off all ready. No one had been expecting the dragon for another week.\nSo it hadn\u2019t been as stupid as it could have been, and it was just his rotten luck that this had been the one year the dragon had decided to come early.\nHe hadn\u2019t even realized the dragon was coming until a sudden gust of wind had come straight down, and he had looked up to see leathery wings settling into place after one last flap.\nHe gulped as he backed away. Maybe the dragon wouldn\u2019t see him -\nThe dragon\u2019s head turned towards him. The enormous eyes glowed gold in the dark. \u201cHello, there.\u201d\nThe sound that came out of Jason\u2019s mouth was absolutely not a squeak. \u201cHi. I was just, just taking a look at your new perch there, it\u2019s very nice, so I\u2019ll just leave you to it - \u201c He\u2019d been backing away as he spoke, but he\u2019d misjudged in the dark. His back hit a stone wall, and the copper figurine tumbled out of his cold numbed fingers. It bounced across the cobblestones before coming to a stop right in front of the dragon. The moonlight glinted off it.\nHe was dead.\nJason bolted. Maybe, maybe the dragon wouldn\u2019t realize what it was? He\u2019d never seen the ornaments before, it would at least take him a second, surely - \nA large scaly tail whipped around and curled around him, cutting off his retreat. \nSo this was it. Jason Todd, killed by dragon.\n. . . Which was admittedly more impressive than dying in a miserable, frozen little huddle, but it also sounded at least potentially more painful.\nNot like he was going to get a choice in the matter. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he blurted out. Maybe the dragon would at least kill him quickly? \u201cI only took the one, the others are still there, I swear!\u201d\nThe dragon blinked at him and then looked down at the little figurine. \u201cWhat do you - Oh. That?\u201d He glanced down at the perch. \u201cThose are new.\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t even noticed. He had stopped Jason for some other reason, maybe just because he\u2019d been stupid enough to run, and now he was going to die because he hadn\u2019t been able to keep his mouth shut.\nFantastic.\n\u00a0\nStopping the boy had been impulsive, Bruce admitted, but he\u2019d just looked so cold. His teeth had been chattering even as he sped through his nervous explanation, and there was a faint blue tinge to his skin that even the warmth of his tail hadn\u2019t entirely gotten rid of. And he was so thin.\nThere was so much food back at the cave. He had a hard time judging warmth himself, but Dick certainly never shivered like that.\nSomeone obviously wasn\u2019t taking care of him properly. \nBut - Well, he had to check. \u201cAnd what do your parents think about you going out at night to steal from dragons?\u201d Personally, Bruce was rather impressed at the audacity.\nThe boy tensed, but he shrugged and answered the question. \u201cDad got hung for thievin\u2019. Mom . . . Mom got real sick.\u201d\nThere was more to that story, but Bruce understood. Far too well. \nAlfred had given several long lectures about how Bruce couldn\u2019t start stealing people just because he\u2019d found Dick. Bruce understood that, but taking the boy with him wouldn\u2019t be stealing. There was no one left to claim him for their family-hoard. And if he left him out here, he would die.\nBesides. Dick would love a brother, and Alfred had been talking about how important it was for children to socialize with their own kind. Maybe this would cut down on some of Dick\u2019s nerve wracking trips out of the cave. Everyone won.\nHe did have business in the city, but he was early for it. He could just come back.\nHe curled his tail tighter around the boy, so he could gently lift him closer to his claws. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cJason,\u201d the boy said warily. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t eat someone once you know their name, that\u2019s just not right.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to eat you.\u201d Breathe on him, yes. He needed to make sure Jason was safe and healthy. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s wrists ached. He knew he should stop moving them, but with the cold metal pressing into them, it was hard to stop himself, especially when he coughed and they automatically jerked.\nThe grey, watery dawn had finally come around again. That was something. It should warm up a little soon, possibly even enough that his shivering underneath the cloak wouldn\u2019t be visible.\nNothing, however, was going to make the fact he could hardly breathe through the congestion any easier to conceal.\nTim slowly forced himself to his feet. The chains had just enough slack to allow him to sit against the wall and try to sleep at night, but the effort was useless. He hadn\u2019t slept more than a handful of hours since he\u2019d come up with this plan.\nThe effort of standing pulled loose a few more bone rattling coughs. Tim was losing hope that the illness would pass before the dragon arrived.\nMaybe, he thought desperately, just maybe, it could work in their favor. Jason had been a street kid when he\u2019d been claimed, so surely he hadn\u2019t been in the best of health, and Dick had just survived a zucco attack. Maybe the dragon liked claiming those who were a bit worse for wear, like a collector who took pride in restoring old pieces to their former glory.\nEqually possibly, he would see Tim\u2019s state and grow offended that they were trying to give him damaged goods. Tim wasn\u2019t sure what they\u2019d do then.\nThe leather of the satchel Stephanie had brought him pressed against his knees. He could just feel the four corners of the book she\u2019d slipped into it.\nMaybe his illness was irrelevant. There had been a dragon to the south several hundred years ago that had collected beautiful people and had them killed and preserved to look at the height of their beauty forever. Another dragon had collected bones, and so had ripped the flesh off his still living victims so that -\nTim tore his mind away from the book and steadied his breathing. Jason and Dick were still alive. \nWhich didn\u2019t mean they were happy or that the dragon might not arrive, decide him unsuitable, and then make a snack out of him just so as not to have wasted the trip.\nFor the city, he reminded himself. For the people. This was his duty. He wouldn\u2019t shirk it now.\nNot that he could if he wanted to. The chains made sure of that.\n\nPlease let the dragon not think he was damaged goods.\n\nIf his mother had still been alive, she\u2019d have been sensible enough not to keep him out here until the dragon arrived. Although if his mother had still been alive, they might not have been in this situation in the first place. She could have found a way to squeeze gold out of ash.\nBut his mother was dead, and it was too late for anything else now. This would work. This would be fine. \nThat was about the time it started to rain.\n\u00a0\nTim wasn\u2019t sure how long it had been raining when he gave up and just curled up in a miserable little ball. There was nothing to shelter him from the rain, so all he could do was duck his head and hunch his shoulders as the icy water slid down his back.\nShockingly, this did his cough no favors. And judging by the way everything was getting a little foggy, Tim was coming to the slow conclusion that he might have developed a fever.\nYou\u2019d think a fever would at least do him the favor of keeping him warm.\nHe noticed it vaguely when the guards started shouting, but he couldn\u2019t muster up the energy to try and figure out what was going on. The wind picked up suddenly, but it died down just as quickly, so he didn\u2019t much care. He couldn\u2019t muster up the energy for much of anything until the rain abruptly stopped falling on him. He could still hear it, but none of it was hitting him.\nHe stared forward blankly for a second before daring to look upward.\nA large black wing was being held protectively overhead.\n\nOh.\n\nA warm breath blew over him, and he soaked in the heat gratefully. The warmth lingered as it settled into him. It might be his imagination, but it seemed like he could breathe a tiny bit better, and his thoughts were definitely clearer.\nDragon\u2019s breath.\nHe turned to look at the dragon properly, but the dragon\u2019s head had already risen to address the guards.\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t sound happy.\nThe guards agreed with his assessment. \u201cThe - the - the boy,\u201d one of them stammered out.\n\u201cI can see there\u2019s a boy,\u201d the dragon snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t see any possible justification for punishing him like this.\u201d The wing lowered protectively.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a punishment,\u201d one of the older guards hurried to explain. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent a runner to Prince Drake, if you\u2019ll just wait for him he can explain everything - \u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to wait.\u201d\nThe dragon was just growing angrier. Tim couldn\u2019t risk him deciding to take it out on someone else.\n\u201cBasilisk,\u201d he said. Then, drawing in a breath so he could speak louder and praying it wouldn\u2019t set off a coughing fit, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a basilisk.\u201d\nThe dragon turned back to him immediately. His voice was noticeably gentler when he spoke. \u201cSo this is some plan to deal with it that\u2019s gone horribly wrong?\u201d\nSort of. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill it,\u201d he explained. \u201cNeed you to. But we couldn\u2019t afford the tribute. Tried - \u201c It was important that the dragon understand that, but jagged coughs ripped out of him before he could explain further.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d the dragon said. More warm breaths washed over Tim until the coughs eased. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\nTim relaxed into the stone wall. \u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cBut how did that lead to you out here?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t pay with gold,\u201d Tim reminded him. \u201cBut there were - rumors.\u201d He coughed again, but the fit was much briefer this time. \u201cRumors you hoarded kids.\u201d A specific type of child, although two weren\u2019t really enough to be a definite pattern. Tim was just glad he fit the profile so they didn\u2019t have to find out.\nBut he\u2019d said something wrong. The dragon was growing angry again. \u201cSo they ripped you away from your family as a sacrifice.\u201d His head swung around to glare at the guards.\n\u201cIt was his idea!\u201d one of them yelped. \u201cWe swear! Prince Drake will tell you!\u201d\n\u201cI volunteered,\u201d Tim confirmed. \u201cMy father . . . agreed.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t hurt. It was ridiculous to propose a plan and then be hurt when his father didn\u2019t oppose it for once. It was a sign of respect, not an eagerness to get rid of Tim. He knew that.\n\u201cHe agreed.\u201d There was something truly terrible in the dragon\u2019s voice now, and it took all of Tim\u2019s courage not to cringe into the stone. This could go so badly, and it would be all his fault if it did. This was his plan. He had to make it work. \u201cThe chains don\u2019t exactly support the \u2018volunteer\u2019 story.\u201d\nTim\u2019s head ducked a bit in shame. If he\u2019d just proven to his father that he was brave enough for this . . . \u201cI did,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThey were just afraid I\u2019d change my mind.\u201d\nThe dragon growled.\n\u201cPrince - Prince Drake is almost here,\u201d one of the guards reported. He pointed a shaky finger down the stairs to where a hastily put together entourage is quickly approaching.\n\u201cGood,\u201d the dragon growled. \u201cGet the boy loose from those chains. The prince and I are going to have a talk.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDespite what Alfred kept insinuating, Bruce fully understood that he couldn\u2019t just steal people from their family-hoard. \nHe remembered all too well the feeling that had come when Talia had told him what had happened to their egg. He wouldn\u2019t inflict that on anyone else.\nIt was tempting sometimes, he admitted, but he was not without self-control. Getting explicitly offered a child was pushing said self-control, but he could have held on. He could have.\nIf not for the prince himself.\nHe finally arrived with his entourage in tow and a speech all prepared. A lot of flowery apologies. A repeated explanation of the situation. \nAbout the only thing of value he got out of it was the boy\u2019s name. Timothy. Or, more likely, Tim.\nWhat he did not get was a satisfactory explanation as to how the prince could have even considered going along with Tim\u2019s plan - or, worse, how he could have driven to such a further extreme. \nProtecting territory was necessary. Giving up gold-hoard for it was admirable. Giving up book-hoard, food-hoard, animal-hoard, even - But family-hoard?\nIf you were willing to give up family-hoard, you didn\u2019t deserve it. \nIf the prince\u2019s eyes had stayed locked on his son as he spoke, Bruce might have had it in him to fly away. If he had been unable to look, even. But instead he shot him periodic apologetic looks during his speech, and with each weak expression of emotion, Bruce\u2019s rage grew.\nHe knew what it was to properly value a family-hoard. He knew how to treasure young.\nTim was his.\n\u00a0\nStephanie admitted two weeks into her journey that maybe she hadn\u2019t fully thought through her plan. It had all seemed so simple when she was storming out of the city, but now . . . \nWell, there hadn\u2019t been a warrior in the city that could take out the basilisk, but the dragon had done it with ease. She didn\u2019t like what that said about her odds against the dragon if it caught her.\nBut she couldn\u2019t just abandon Tim. Even if it was . . . too late . . . she could at least do the proper funeral rites. \nOf course, she\u2019d have to get his body a fair distance away from the dragon to do that, so that would mean carrying - \nStephanie pulled her mind firmly away from such thoughts. Tim would be fine. She would be fine. Everything would be just fine.\nShe kicked a rock for emphasis. It bounced across the packed dirt road before coming to a rest at the bottom of the hill she had just crested.\nSpecifically, it came to a rest against a man\u2019s boot.\nA rather unsavory looking man.\nStephanie leaned down and grabbed another rock.\n\u00a0\nBruce landed beside the unconscious man with a thump. He touched one claw gently to the man\u2019s bleeding face. \u201cImpressive.\u201d\nThe girl yelped something that could have been an agreement. Then something bounced against his snout.\nBruce looked down at the ground. A rock had just fallen next to his foot. He looked back at the girl. \u201cDid you just throw a rock at me?\u201d\nThe girl lowered her arm. \u201c . . . Reflex?\u201d\nBruce snorted a laugh and peered at her more closely. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNope. I\u2019m good.\u201d Her voice was still a bit concerningly high. Bruce breathed on her a bit just in case. \n\u201cWhat are you doing traveling out here alone?\u201d\nThe girl crossed her arms. \u201cI can travel alone if I want to.\u201d\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Bruce agreed. It was brave to the point of recklessness, but she could. \u201cBut seeing as even most seasoned warriors don\u2019t, I assumed you must be doing so to some purpose.\u201d\nShe bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d\nBrave and loyal then. Dick would like her - \nBruce stopped that thought before it could get out of control. Remember what Alfred would say, he told himself firmly. \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got better things to do than to help me,\u201d she hedged.\n\u201cFinding people is important,\u201d he said firmly. His eyes caught on the symbol embroidered on her dress. A maid\u2019s uniform, likely, but that wasn\u2019t the important part. \u201cYou\u2019re from Tim\u2019s city!\u201d Which was not the actual name, and he would have to explain -\nBut no. Red had rushed to her face, and she had taken a wary step back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for Tim.\u201d\nThe girl jutted her chin out. \u201cAnd if I am?\u201d Her voice shook a little despite her best efforts.\nThis was perfect. He\u2019d heard Tim talking about a girl named Stephanie. It must be this one. He could bring her back to the cave, and the others could talk her into staying. Even Alfred couldn\u2019t object to this one.\n\u201cThen I am happy to say that I know exactly where he is. May I offer you a ride?\u201d\nThis, Bruce thought smugly when Stephanie gave a hesitant nod, was an excellent plan."
