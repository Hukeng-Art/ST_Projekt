    "text": "Eleven year old Izuku stood as still as he could as the man in front of him rambled. He could barely hear the garbage he was spouting about \u2018no heroes coming to save him\u2019 over the pounding in his chest. Thankfully, or maybe not, the thump of footsteps makes both of them pause for a moment. They both turned to see a hero (was that Endeavor?!?) walking past the alley entrance. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHelp! There\u2019s a guy trying to mug me!\u201d Midoriya shouted in a desperate attempt at not getting injured. The man started to shake in fear and ran off, tipping over trash cans as he ran from the scene. Izuku took his hint and ran as well, to where he last saw the hero, only stopping to catch his breath. As soon as he could breathe again he grabbed the hero\u2019s arm- not a great idea, he did have flames rippling over him- and started bowing. Endeavor turned to look at him with distaste in his eyes. \n\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Endeavor sir there was a man- and he- there was a knife- and he was asking for my money- and he got away, but I lost what I had on me. And I really needed that money to get groceries for my mom. Please help me, sir.\u201d He added on the sir as an afterthought. However, it didn\u2019t do much good, for the tall hero turned around and continued to walk. Izuku stared at him, confused, as the flame \u201chero\u201d walked away. Seeing the departing figure Midoriya tried again, a little more forcefully than he had intended. \n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease sir I was just mugged. You\u2019re a hero aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re supposed to do something.\u201d \n\u00a0\nNow, Midoriya couldn\u2019t see Endeavore\u2019s face, but he could almost feel the hero\u2019s annoyance. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to deal with some stupid mugging. If I walked around handling all the back alley shit that happens all day I\u2019d be no better than some worthless sidekick; I\u2019d never become the number one hero. Go find someone who cares.\u201d He turned and stormed off leaving the young child dumbfounded in his wake. As he watched the flame hero exit his vision, Midoriya slowly sunk down onto the pavement and tears dripped from his eyes.\n\u00a0\nHow could he not care? Heros are supposed to be the ones who help people. If my teachers won\u2019t care what kids are doing in school, the heros won\u2019t help outside of school, and mom won\u2019t notice anything wrong then who am I supposed to turn to? I mean it seems like the only person who cares about me is me! Midoriya laughed, but it was dry and mocking. Then his eyes got wide and he smiled. That\u2019s it! I have to be the one to help. I don\u2019t have a quirk so it\u2019s not like I can go vigilante, but I\u2019ll figure something out. Then the smile grew dangerous. And first I\u2019ll figure out how to get that mugger in jail.\n\u00a0\nWith that thought in mind, he walked home with a new pep in his step and a light in his eyes that hadn\u2019t shown in years.\n____\n\u00a0\nWhen Midoriya got home he plopped down on his bed and began to search for any evidence he could against his attacker. He soon realized though that, while there were cameras in the alley, he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach them without either permission or hacking. \n\u00a0\nGod, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t want people to get condemned. Sighing, Midoriya turned to the internet to see if there were any other options, because, when in doubt, turn to Google. Oh hey, free online coding and hacking classes, that could work! Seems sketchy, but I don\u2019t have any other options at the moment.\n\u00a0\nThe eleven year old leaned back, satisfied with this achievement. It was his first step, kind of, towards his end goal. Even if it had only been a Google search and finding some online classes, it was still more than he had ever done before. Pride rippled through him and Midoriya smiled to himself. Soon, soon I\u2019ll bring that man to justice. I hope.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t until he heard his mother open the door that he remembered the reason he needed to do this in the first place. He scrambled downstairs to see the short, plump woman hanging up her coat. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHi honey how was your day at school?\u201d She said as she grabbed Midoriya in a large, warm hug. \u201cYou remembered to go shopping right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cActually, there was an issue. So, you see, I was going to, but then this guy stoppedmeandhehadaknifeandhetookthemoneyandItriedtogeta herotostophimbuthedidn\u2019tandtheguygotawayand-\u201d He stopped as he felt his mom\u2019s shaking hands on his shoulders.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my gosh you were mugged! Are you okay baby?!\u201d The woman began to cry as she embraced him again and began petting his hair. \u201cOh don\u2019t you worry about the groceries we can go together tomorrow. It\u2019ll be alright. Now tell me what happened.\u201d\n____\n\u00a0\nThe next big change didn\u2019t happen until a couple weeks later. Izuku was walking home from school again when he heard crying from the alley across the street. Carefully he slipped inside and walked toward the source. \n\u00a0\n\u201cA villainous piece of shit like you? You\u2019d be better off in a prison then as a doctor. It\u2019s almost naive that you think a quirk that can take people apart isn\u2019t perfect for a villain like you.\u201d It sounded to him like a highschooler. Peaking around the corner of a dumpster he could see two kids in what he thought were the uniforms of middle school third years, one year younger than what he originally thought. The taller of the two was leaning over a shorter kid who had fallen to the ground against the dirty alley wall. \n\u00a0\n\u201cBut what if someone needs surgery, or an amputation, and I could help!\u201d The smaller boy retorted. Izuku could see his hands shaking from where he stood a few meters away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa! Yeah right! You\u2019d probably screw up and get them killed like the worthless fuck-up you are.\u201d The younger kid, or at least he looked younger, curled in on himself. Satisfied, the bullies walked away down the other end of the alley, laughing. Deciding that now would be the best time, Izuku stepped out of his hiding spot and began to walk over to help up the still shaking boy. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey are you alright? Man that guy was an ass. I know someone just like him, and let me tell you he\u2019s the worst!\u201d The older boy gave him a look of bewilderment before giving a small laugh and nodding.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah that guy is the worst too; he broke my phone yesterday too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh that sucks, I would have asked to trade numbers.\u201d Izuku said in the most caring voice he could. \u201cBy the way what you said about your quirk was really spot on. It would be really good for a surgeon or even an EMT. Does it work selectively or does it only remove the entire object? Because if it was selective you could even use your quirk to remove tumors! Or take out bullets! Oh my god that\u2019s such a cool quirk!\u201d He almost started one of his muttering tangents but stopped at the look on that guy\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI- it does work selectively!\u201d The kid was looking at Izuku like he hung the stars in the sky, \u201cAnd wow, that\u2019s a lot of ideas. I\u2019ve never even thought about my quirk that way and trust me I\u2019ve thought about it a lot. What\u2019s your quirk, analysis?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, funny you say that\u2026\u201d Midoriya rubbed the back of his head nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t have a quirk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, um, cool.\u201d Suddenly, his face turns into one of pity and awkwardness. \u201cSo, yeah. Thanks, I guess. Anyways, see you around.\u201d The middle schooler picked up his stuff, dusted himself off, and started jogging down the alley away from Midoriya.\n\u00a0\nWow. He forgot how much that hurt. Everyone at his school knew he was quirkless so he hadn't gotten that kind of reaction in a while. Ugh. Midoriya kicked the ground under his worn shoes and stared towards the sky. Well, dinner won\u2019t make itself and I\u2019m in charge of it tonight. Gotta get home.\n\u00a0\nStill, during the final minutes of the walk home, Midoriya couldn\u2019t figure out which hurt more: the kid\u2019s reaction, or the fact that it was so normal he was able to just brush it off. However, he did know that it would be the last time anyone would get away with anything without him knowing about it. And without the police knowing about it, because Midoriya wasn\u2019t about to be walking around beating heads in. No, Midoriya grinned, he\u2019d let the police do that.\n\nThree years later\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Midoriya stretched his hands over his head and felt his back pop, \u201cthis is gonna take a while.\u201d He pushed away his computer and brought his notebook towards him. \u201cSo, first up is the villain Ground Breaker. He was last seen in these coordinates, which is a bar. Welp, I guess he\u2019s an idiot, but I mean, it helps me a lot. So, if I hack into this camera, then I can see when he leaves and where he goes.\u201d Midoriya smiled and switched his notebook for his computer. He brought up his version of the city map and looked for the camera nearest to the bar. Camera 5623. An easy enough one to hack. Once Ground Breaker left the bar, Midoriya slowly followed the villain\u2019s path using the cameras- in a totally legal way- up until he entered an abandoned warehouse. The villain didn\u2019t leave the building for the rest of the night.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Izuku slithered from his chair and collapsed onto the floor, \u201cthat took a while. Yeesh, what time is it?\u201d He turned his head slightly to allow for the bright red light of his alarm clock to assault his eyes; it was blinking a simple 4:21 am. \u201cDangit, I missed 4:20. I\u2019m an embarrassment, a disgrace, and I really should message the others about this soon.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: u\u2019ll never guess what just happened\nDadzawa: Why are you awake?\nApparition: i could ask the same of u\nDadzawa: But you won\u2019t, because you know why.\nApparition: u take all the fun outta this\nTsalty: Both of you, shut up.\nApparition: oooooo we made dad #2 mad\nApparition: did we wake u up\nTsalty: Yes, you did so you\u2019ve better jump straight to the point.\nApparition: oof that be kinda hard cause straight aint in my dna\nDadzawa: Do you have something for us?\nApparition: yea yea im getting to that\n\nApparition sent you a location\n\nApparition: there u go\nApparition: ground breakers famous and cobwebed hideout\n\u00a0\nMidoriya grinned as he could almost see Tsukauchi scrambling to get all of his other police and hero buddies on high alert. Not to mention that Aizawa was probably already running across rooftops to try and scope the place out. It would be so easy to go back to his computer and confirm it, but he doesn\u2019t want to take any unnecessary risks. Just because he hasn\u2019t been found out yet doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDadzawa: How do we know you aren\u2019t lying?\nApparition: ur already there right\nApparition: u can confirm for yourself\nDadzawa: \u2026\nTsalty: Ever going to tell us how you know this?\n\u00a0\nMidoriya almost laughed at Tsukauchi\u2019s predictable text. Four years ago, he completed his first arrest: the person who tried to mug him. Tsukauchi had immediately wanted to know who he was. And Midoriya almost told him. But then he remembered the one kid in the alley. If Midoriya told the police force, they would figure out he was quirkless and maybe think that his evidence was faulty. So, he gave them the name Apparition and told them that only after he put 100,000 deserving people in jail would they finally get to know.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: imma magical unicorn\nDadzawa: You\u2019re at 86,017 people in jail already. Why not just cut it short\nApparition: idk\nDadzawa: I give up. Go to sleep.\nApparition: u first\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparition: rude\nApparition is now offline\n____\nTwo hands slammed onto Midoriya\u2019s desk and startled him awake. He almost kept pretending to be asleep anyway, but then he smelled the smoke. He whipped his head up and stared into the crimson eyes of Bakabitch Katsuki.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, hi. Kacchan. Fancy seeing you here.\u201d Midoriya cringed internally. That was not a good idea, but nothing is ever a good idea when Bakugou is around.\n\u00a0\nBright light flashed from underneath Bakugou\u2019s palms and Midoriya flinched away. \u201cFancy seeing you here,\u201d Bakugou snarled in a bad imitation of Midoriya\u2019s voice, \u201cYou think you can make fun of me? Especially after ignoring me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to say that--wait, when did I ignore you?\u201d Oops. That was the wrong thing to say. Anger sparked in Kacchan\u2019s eyes and he leaned closer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleeping in class like you\u2019re better than the rest of us. Ha. Like a quirkless freak could ever be better than me.\u201d The heat from Bakugou\u2019s explosions almost burned Midoriya\u2019s skin and he tried to back away, which is easier said than done when one is in a chair. Said chair then tipped over and Midoriya\u2019s head slammed into the ground. He scrambled out of it and stood up with the grace of a baby fawn.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you see, I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. It was an accident. I just stayed up too late last night and yeah. So, um, can you ever find it in your heart to forgive me?\u201d As soon as Midoriya realized what he just said he freezed.\n\u00a0\n\nOh god. This is going to be the day that I die. I just talked back to Kacchan. I\u2019m doomed. Poor Easerhead and Tsukauchi, they\u2019ll never know who I am. I\u2019ll never get to 100,000 people. I\u2019m too young to die! I have too much to live for!\n\n\u00a0\nThankfully, no more words were exchanged. Bakugou just used his signature glare and quirk to escalate the situation, and once it was smokey enough, he left. Actually, Midoriya thinks while walking home and looking down at his burnt uniform and skin, I might have prefered if there was more talking and less burning. His backpack was chafing on one of the worst burns and the pain was getting to the point where he couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore. Thankfully, he had already made it to the park and was able to find a secluded area.\n\u00a0\nOnce he got there Midoriya quickly sat down and took off his backpack. Then, he took out his mini first aid kit and applied the burn cream to his shoulder. The relief was immediate. Thank God for quality burn crea-what the fuck!\n\u00a0\nThe thing responsible for surprising Midoriya was a boy, around Izuku\u2019s age, running full speed into his hiding spot. The middle schooler then proceeded to trip over Midorya\u2019s outstretched legs and fall flat on his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god are you okay?\u201d The fallen boy had a uniform that Midoriya had never seen before, and purple hair. He, honestly, looked to be dead. This just in, Apparition killed an innocent boy. The entire police force is coming together to find this criminal-\n\u00a0\nA groan stopped the greenette\u2019s internal monologue and he looked down to see the boy was slowly getting up. The middle schooler didn\u2019t look very injured, besides from a bump on his head, so Midoriya breathed a sigh of relief. He was about to ask the boy\u2019s name when shouts came from the same direction he had come from. The kid\u2019s expression soon turned to fear and Midoriya, who had had that exact expression many times, could guess who was chasing him. A lightbulb went off in his head, and Izuku quickly climbed one of the trees, took his phone out, and started recording.\n\u00a0\nThree new boys came into the clearing cracking their knuckles and smirking. In their hands they held a muzzle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you think you could run from us, villain?\u201d The purplette shook his head and opened his mouth to defend himself. \u201cShit, he\u2019s gonna talk! Quickly!\u201d The two other boys jumped on their victim and wrestled him to the ground. Their leader quickly walked over to the struggling boy and put the muzzle on his head. \u201cThere, now you can\u2019t brainwash anyone. Man, feels good to be a hero doesn\u2019t it guys,\u201d His two lackeys nodded.\n\u00a0\nSatisfied, they walked away and left the boy curled in a ball, tears falling from his tired, sunken eyes . Midoriya took that as his que to stop recording and climb down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d a flinch, \u201cit\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a friend. Can I take that muzzle off?\u201d A nod. Midoriya quickly put on the gloves he kept with him and bent down. Once he had taken the muzzle off he then put the offending object in a police evidence bag and stuffed it in his backpack. Can never be too careful. \u201cUm, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShinso Hitoshi.\u201d Sarcasm leaked into his voice and Midoriya wondered if that meant he was lying or was a coping mechanism.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool. Hi Shinso, I\u2019m Midoriya Izuku. Are you hurt? I have a first aid kit in my bag for when things like this happen to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt that last sentence Shinso looked up wide eyed. He paused a moment, taking in the various burns on the shorter boy. After a moment, his inner turmoil seemed to die down and he spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Midoriya, but I think I\u2019ll be okay. And anyways, I don\u2019t think a first aid kit is going to be enough for those injuries. You should go to a hospital!\u201d His eyes were filled with concern and no sarcasm was found. Apparently fellow bullied students get a free pass.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeh, no, I\u2019m good. I have top class burn cream in it so I\u2019ll be good. Although, I\u2019ll need to get a new uniform, but this is why you order spares!\u201d When Shinso looked ready to argue Izuku decided it was time to get back on his walk. \u201cI\u2019ll, um, see you around? Hopefully?\u201d Midoriya started walking away and then said one more comment. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. Things will get better.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLeaving the confused boy behind him, the burnt middle schooler started jogging back to his house, carrying his backpack in his hand instead of over his shoulders. As soon as he got home, Midoriya yelled a quick \u201cI\u2019m home\u201d and raced to his room. Shinso Hitoshi. Now that I know his name I can find his school and hack into the cams. Maybe I\u2019ll get his number while I\u2019m at it and text him? Midoriya cracked his knuckles and began.\n\u00a0\nTwo hours later, he had about an hour's worth of footage of poor Shinso being bullied. The footage also shows the teachers not doing anything, or helping it along. Izuku compiled it all, including the recording he got in the park, and put in on his flash drive. This specific flash drive was decorated so it has a smiley face on one side and a ghost on the other. Midoriya also added some general info like names so that Tsukauchi can deal with it faster. He then put on some dark clothes, got out the bag with the muzzle, and told his mom that he was going on a walk.\n\u00a0\nThe walk to the police station is pretty quiet, so Midoriya spent the time hacking their cameras. Well, the one in Tsukauchi\u2019s office. Once he got there, the greenette walked to the side of the building and checked the camera to make sure no one\u2019s inside that room. There wasn\u2019t. Perfect. Then, a click of a button and the camera is looped.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya walked over to his favorite police officer\u2019s office window, and quickly peeked in. Still no one there. Then, he fiddled with the window lock a bit and slid the window up. Jeez, it took me forever to figure out how to deal with that lock. Like bitch, what the fuck. That bitchass window lock stopped me for a fucking month! I had to enter through the vents! Fuck no, never again. Once he got into his office, Midoriya placed the muzzle and the flash drive on his desk and made a speedy escape, unlooping the camera once he was off the premises.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparition: @Tsalty i gave u a present\nApparition: its not time sensitive but i would like u to deal with it soon\nTsalty: Yeah. I see it.\nDadzawa: What\u2019s it about?\nApparition: bullying, quirk discrimination, suicide baiting, middle school\nDadzawa: That\u2019s different from what you usually do. Why?\nApparition: i saw it myself &amp; wasnt about to let it go\nApparition: plus i knew that dadzawa would be interested\nDadzawa: I hate that you\u2019re right.\nTsalty: In any case, we\u2019ll get right on it\nTsalty: Thanks for this\nApparition: omg\nApparition: parental acceptance and appreciation\nApparition: u do care\nDadzawa: Parental, really? Now is not the time to act like a teenager.\nApparition: i honestly feel so betrayed that you think a kid could do the same things i do\nDadzawa: Your behavior is kind of childish.\nApparition: disowned\nDadzawa: That\u2019s...that\u2019s not how it works\nApparition: wait, do u finally admit ur my parents\nApparition: i have been blessed\nDadzawa: I admit no such thing.\nTsalty: Daily Reminder:\nTsalty: Apparition, you should leave this kind of stuff to the professionals.\nApparition: is over 86,000 successful arrests of bad people not professional enough 4 u\n\nTsalty is now offline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\nApparition: imma go with it is then\n\nApparition is now offline\n\nThe next morning Midoriya woke up to a whole eight hours of sleep. He usually didn\u2019t stop until he had arrested at least two people, but he had already done that with Shinso. That was how he got over 86,000 arrests in only three years. That, and villains like to be in groups. Safety in numbers I guess.\n\u00a0\nAn hour later, Midoriya had already made himself breakfast, gotten dressed, gotten a lead, and was walking to school. He had his phone out and was investigating a new criminal. Their name was Cameleon and they could change their entire appearance to fit their needs. It made them a pain to try and follow. But Midoriya had figured out their most used appearance and was now looking into that person\u2019s information.\n\u00a0\nSchool started before Izuku could figure out anything super useful, but that didn\u2019t really matter. Midoriya\u2019s school was pretty average academically, so the classes were a breeze. All he had to do was start investigating on his computer instead of his phone.\n\u00a0\nIt was during the lunch break that Midoriya finally found a clue. Chameleon's main persona\u2019s name was Nakamoto Takashi and went to school at \u2026 UA?? Oh shit. A villain got into UA? This could get bad. With new fervor Midoriya tried to get as much evidence as he could that Nakamoto and Chameleon were the same person. Time passed in a flash and soon school had ended. Still, during all that time, there was a piece missing. Midoriya\u2019s research was enough that anyone with a brain could figure out that his suspect and Chameleon were one and the same, but it wasn\u2019t enough to get the civilian version of the criminal in jail and make him stay there.\n\u00a0\nQue the muttering tangent: \u201cOkay, so look at all the times when Chameleon went and wreaked havoc,\u201d Midoriya paused as he scrolled through different newspapers. \u201cWait, what\u2019s that. He robbed a store with a bunch of other villains at noon. On a Tuesday! That\u2019s during school! Which means that I might be able to get footage of him leaving UA or transforming into something using Chameleon\u2019s quirk! So all I have to do is hack into UA\u2019s cameras! Wait, shit. Well, let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDuring this tangent, Midoriya had walked under a specific underpass like always. Behind him, a grate rattled as if something was trying to get out. Midoriya didn\u2019t stick around to find out. He ran like hell.\n\u00a0\nI have watched way too many horror movies, villain fights, and just random camera footage to stick around when a sewer grate rattles. No way! Plus, I can always see what's going on from the safety of my house. He felt something brush his feet and arm and Midoriya somehow sped up. Huh, adrenaline does wonders. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, stop! Get back here!\u201d An unknown voice screams out from behind him, however Midoriya didn\u2019t stop running until he had gotten to his apartment complex, and even then, he only slowed to open his door and get inside. Once inside, he stopped and leaned against the door until he caught his breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat...the hell...was that?!\u201d He gasped. Walking further into the house he found the nearest comfortable object and collapsed onto it. \u201cDid\u2026 did I just almost die? Ugh, I guess there is only one way to find out.\u201d Sighing, he rolled off the oh, it was a couch, and shuffled towards his computer.\n\u00a0\nHe quickly located the right camera and pulled up the footage from not even half an hour ago. Okay so I\u2019m walking, I\u2019m walking, and- Holy Shit! What the fuck is that thing?! Omg is that All Might?! No way! Damn that was sick, it only took one hit? He watched on the screen as All Might lept off, and then leaned back in his seat and exhaled. Even if the number one hero had been there it had taken him a couple minutes to arrive and he might have suffocated in that time. Okay, back to the case at hand. Let\u2019s go.\n\u00a0\nIt took almost four hours to break through the wall blocking the public from UA\u2019s cameras. Midoriya cheered as the files finally popped up onto the screen of his virtually untraceable computer before he began to click through various footage links. He eventually was able to locate the student in question. \n\u00a0\nNakamoto Takashi\u2026 AHA! Gen Ed huh? Okay room 2-D\u2026 Yup, just as I thought. Sneaking out with the lunch rush, very clever. Aaaaaand...yup reentering just before class. Got you. He worked swiftly now that he had confirmed this lead to find the matching cameras and follow the Nakamoto boy into the city. Once he had a full timeline of the events that occurred that afternoon he loaded it on a file and saved it to his phone.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: hey dad #1, dad #2, guess who i fouuuuuund~\nDadzawa: Just spit it out I have grading to do.\nApparition: geez no need to be to cranky\nApparition: here\u2019s your hint: it rhymes with Sylvion \nDadzawa: What?...Chameleon?\nApparition: wow one guess! yep!\nDadzawa: Okay I don\u2019t know what Sylvion is but I know it doesn\u2019t rhyme with Chameleon.\nApparition: yeah but it worked so who cares about the nitty gritty details\nTsalty: So are you going to send us the evidence or not?\nApparition: wow both of you are cranky today\nApparition: did someone poor salt in your coffee instead of sugar owo\n\nDadzawa is offline\n\nApparition: he doesn\u2019t appreciate my genius\nApparition: anyway here\u2019s the file\nApparition: b95cca5-...0f670.MP4 \nTsalty: Thanks. I would give you the daily reminder now but, honestly, I doubt you even read it. \n\nTsalty is offline\n\nApparition: tru tru\n\nApparition is offline\n\n\u00a0\nWith that completed he moved on to trying to find the new villain in Musutafu- ding. He looked down at his phone in confusion. What the hell??? No one texts me other than my mom and she\u2019s still at work? He unlocked his phone and opened the messages app. No way! I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually respond?!\n\u00a0\n\nUnnamed chat\n\nShinso Hitoshi: Hi, sorry I didn\u2019t respond to your text. I was caught up with something. How are you?\nMidoriya Izuku: im doing pretty good, u?\nShinso Hitoshi: I\u2019m fine and you\u2019ll never guess what happened!\nMidoriya Izuku: oh? do tell\nShinso Hitoshi: Okay so the day I met you, that afternoon, this policeman came to my house and told me that he wanted to take a statement against the school!\nShinso Hitoshi: He told me he\u2019s going to build a case against them because of all the shit they ignore the kids doing. Then, my parents were trying to stop him, and he started to question them, and now he\u2019s building a case against them too on the basis of like 10 different abuse issues!!\nMidoriya Izuku: hold up. u\u2019re being abused?!?!?!\nShinso Hitoshi: ah shit.\nShinso Hitoshi: ...yeah. But now my parents are being investigated so I\u2019m going to be fine soon, I hope. I mean the detective, Tsukauchi I think, seemed really nice and caring\nMidoriya Izuku: what r ur parents names??\nShinso Hitoshi: why??????\nMidoriya Izuku: no reason\u2026\nShinso Hitoshi: Shinso Safu and Shinso Aru\u2026\nMidoriya Izuku: cool thank bye ttyl\n\nMidoriya Izuku is now offline\n\nShinso Hitoshi: okay???????? Should I be scared?\n\nShinso Hitoshi is now offline\n\n\u00a0\nWelp, and here I thought I was going to get some sleep today. Honestly who was I kidding? Pushing aside the Chameleon evidence Midoriya starts to rifle through all possible residences for a certain Shinso family. However, it was easier to find them than he expected.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, how was this not pushed into the light sooner? Multiple complaints from neighbors and even onlookers and nothing was ever done? See, this is why I created Apparition.\u201d Slowly, Midoriya got access to the family\u2019s security measures, which he found out was none. \u201cNot a single fucking camera. What the fuck. You know, this might take the cake of annoying things I\u2019ve been forced to deal with. Do they even have security?\u201d He pauses. \u201cOh, of course, they have window locks. The only goddamn security they have are window locks. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m getting a metal bat and smashing their windows. No one can stop me now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: c106ddb6-...1g781.MP4\nApparition: just in case u need some evidence\nApparition: i know its not much but im lazy\nDadzawa: Wait, for what criminal is this used for and what is it\nApparition: boi can u not read\nApparition: its for the Shinso case and its a list of complaints\nDadzawa: Go to sleep\nApparition: ill sleep when im dead\nDadzawa: Go to sleep\nApparition: fine dad T^T\nDadzawa: No, don\u2019t use those\nApparition: (\u00b4\u0f0e\u0eb6\u0f7c\u03c1\u0f0e\u0eb6\u0f7c`)\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\nApparition: no one appreciates me\n\nApparition is now offline\n\nA month passed and Apparition had completed around 90,200 total arrests. To go along with that, Eraserhead had adopted Shinso, and Shinso, soon after, figured out that Midoriya was Apparition (\u201cA couple of days after I first met you, the people who bullied me got arrested. Then when I texted you my parent\u2019s names- and I still don\u2019t know how you got my number- they got arrested. And Eraserhead told me that Apparition helped. I\u2019m not an idiot\u201d was Shinso's reasoning for putting two and two together). So, it\u2019s not like anyone was slacking off.\n\u00a0\nIn fact, at the moment, Midoriya was leisurely hacking on his phone while his math teacher droned in the background. Math was always his best subject, so he didn\u2019t really need to be paying attention. Plus, the teacher never called on Midoriya because, you know, he was quirkless. And obviously quirkless people can\u2019t be smart. The one time quirk discrimination works in my favor. Basically, Midoriya was not and did not have to pay any attention in this class. So, when someone knocked on the classroom\u2019s door, Midoriya was unsurprisingly startled. He looked over to see that it was the janitor. Huh? That janitor only starts working after school hours. What\u2019s he doing here?\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, I was sent here by the principal to ask you about the missing window locks?\u201d The janitor stated, looking very apologetic.\n\u00a0\nThe teacher stopped her explanations for some type of equation, that Midoriya was 85% positive he already knew, to question, \u201cWindow locks? I\u2019m not quite sure what you mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, all of the little latches that keep the windows from opening after school hours have been taken off the windows. And the principle can\u2019t find any evidence of who it was, because we don\u2019t have enough money for cameras, so he instructed me to ask around,\u201d the janitor started walking to the next classroom but stopped to give one more message, \u201cSo, if you have any information on who did this please tell the principal. This is qualified as a safety breach.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs soon as the janitor left the room exploded in chatter and questions. It took the teacher forever to calm everyone down. \u201cNow, does anyone have any idea who would do this? Speak up please and don\u2019t be shy to tell me after class instead, if you want to.\u201d All of the students looked at each other, silently questioning who they thought it could be. Of course, no one looked at Midoriya. He was just a quirkless kid, what could he do? \u201cOkay then. So, who can tell me what x equals?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo, maybe taking the window locks off the windows in my school wasn\u2019t the best idea. Oops, too late now. Midoriya tunes the sensei out and turns back towards his phone. At least there were no cameras to pick it up, not that that would have mattered.____ \n\u00a0\nMidoriya was sitting on his couch after school, trying to finish another case- because he didn\u2019t have enough time during math class thanks to the janitor- when a knock jolted him out of his thoughts. Someone was at his front door.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya got out of his seat to open it and see who was there. When he opened the door, what greeted him was a large rat(??). Or is it a small bear? Maybe a dog? In a suit? WAIT! Nezu????!!!! No way no way no wa-\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I a rat, a dog, a bear? Who knows. However, I am the principal of UA. Also, I like the crocs and socks look.\u201d \n\u00a0\nMidoriya shut the door. \n\u00a0\n\nWait, shit, I just shut the door on the principle of UA! Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku ripped open the door again to see the small principal looking up at him with a creepy glint in his eye. \u201cHello Midoriya Izuku, or, rather, Apparition. It took rather a long time to track you down, a feat that I can say has occurred very few times. You are the one who broke into my camera network and got my student arrested weren\u2019t you?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that question optional?\u201d Midoriya responded, blanking on a way out of the conversation at hand. \u201cI mean\u2026 come on in? I\u2019ll make you some tea if you\u2019d like?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Jasmine would be lovely.\u201d The two shuffled into the house. Izuku left awkwardly to prepare tea as Nezu sat patiently on his sofa. He returned with a tray of tea a few minutes later and placed it on the table, hoping Nezu might start the conversation. Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m still at a loss as to how you managed to hack into my cameras with only the experience of some free online coding courses, but I suppose that question will be answered in due time.\u201d The small mammal spoke calmly, taking a long sip of his tea before continuing. \u201cBut, the real reason I am here is to give you an offer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh\u201d Izuku responded smartly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI recognize a brain with potential when I see one. I\u2019ve done my research into your arrests as well, and your morals are impeccable. I request that you allow me to take you on as a personal student. I would love a chance to shape your brain. Not only that, but this mentorship would allow you to get into UA for your high school years by direct recommendation from me. You wouldn\u2019t have to take the hero exam, so your lack of quirk wouldn\u2019t be an issue. What do you say?\u201d Nezu\u2019s beady eyes staring into Midoriya\u2019s soul and he shuddered, but not only in fear. This was a once in a thousand lifetimes chance and he was not going to give it away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly if you don\u2019t tell Eraserhead and Tsukauchi about any of this, including Apparition\u2019s identity.\u201d Wait, what! Why did I say that? Now he might not accept! I\u2019m an idiot!\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. I would hate to lose you to them.\u201d Nezu replies, and he then extends his paw(?). Midoriya reaches out and grabs it. \u201cWelcome to UA Midoriya Izuku.\u201d \n\u00a0\nNezu hopped off the couch and placed a small badge on the table. It was a UA student badge. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow then, after school!\u201d The principal then sauntered towards the door. Right before he got to it, however, he stopped. \u201cOh,\u201d Nezu turned around and smiled at Midoriya, \u201cand thank you for the tea.\u201d With that, he opens the door and exits.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat the fuck?! \n\nA short, 14 year old Izuku walked into UA the next monday ridden with anxiety and stress. He didn\u2019t know what to expect from joining THE UA nine months early! Not to mention in the middle of the school year! And as the student of the principal! Oh god, this is how I die.\n\u00a0\nHe walked up to the principal's office, waving to the receptionist as he passed, and knocked twice on the door. It opened swiftly to reveal Nezu who didn\u2019t look shocked at all to see him 20 minutes early. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHello Midoriya! I\u2019m quite pleased to see you here so early!\u201d The principal turned and grabbed tea from a counter in the back of the room before gesturing for Izuku to join him on the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, I just wanted to avoid other students\u201d Midoriya awkwardly responded, laughing a little. \n\u00a0\nMidoriya quietly sat down on the couch only to jump a foot into the air as a single knock rang from the door he had just passed through. He watched as Nezu walked to the door and opened it to reveal\u2026 Dad #1! Shitshitshit what if he recognises me?! Wait, he has no idea who I am. Calm down Izuku, don\u2019t look like you recognize him. Jeez, I honestly forgot he worked here, though. This\u2019ll be interesting. Hold on is that Shinso?? What is going on?? \n\u00a0\n\u201cNezu, you asked to see us?\u201d Aizawa said in a gruff voice. If I didn\u2019t know better I might think he was nervous. I mean I guess anyone would be to bring their child around Nezu, but still. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYes I did\u201d responded the small mammal, sipping his tea. \u201cDue to the circumstances that brought young Shinso\u2019s case to light and his budding friendship with my personal student here I figured you might be more that happy to allow me to use your son as a tour guide for a moment.\u201d \n\u00a0\nAizawa\u2019s eyes widened, a glint of fear in them before it\u2019s covered it up by glaring at Izuku. Oh no, is Dad going to kill me? I\u2019m too young to die!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand. Who is that kid and why do you want to use Shinso and not someone else?\u201d Aizawa narrowed his eyes and subtly stepped in front of Shinso. Shinso, on the other hand, tilted his head and stared at Midoriya. Midoriya waved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I forgot to introduce him. This is Midoriya Izuku. I found him after he hacked into UA. Quite a feat if I do say so myself.\u201d Nezu answered only one of the questions and began to pour himself tea. \u201cAnyone want any?\u201d Midoriya nodded, too afraid to do otherwise, while both Shinso and Aizawa shake their heads. Izuku doesn\u2019t miss the suspicious glance Aizawa gives him. \n\u00a0\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer what you want with my son.\u201d Aizawa growled out. Midoriya mouthed \u2018oooo, son. Nice\u2019 before snickering at the embarrassed glare Shinso shot him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, yes. In all honesty the biggest reason is because of his friendship with Midoriya. Because they already know each other it would help the atmosphere and make the situation more comfortable. So, I thought that Shinso would be the best person to show Midoriya around.\u201d Nezu sipped his tea and stared straight into Aizawa\u2019s soul, almost daring him to object.\n\u00a0\nTension started to leak into the air after that declaration, and Shinso motioned towards Midoriya. \u2018Do something\u2019 he mouthed. \u2018What?\u2019 Midoriya replied. Shinso glanced around the room and then shrugged. Ugh, fine. I\u2019ll save the day and stop Dadzawa from murdering Nezu over his son.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, Nezu, do you mind?\u201d Midoriya walked over to the window and motioned towards it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. Feel free to open it. Oh, your tea is ready by the way.\u201d Nezu nodded and turned back towards the argument at hand. Got to distract him before he starts to speak again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot what I meant, but okay.\u201d All three of them whipped around and stared at Midoriya. Quickly, Midoriya flicked out a pocket knife and moved towards the window lock. He slipped the knife underneath it and yanked it towards the ceiling. The rusty lock smacked the ceiling with a loud crack and then plopped onto the ground next to Midoriya. Midoriya then placed the knife back into his sleeve and shuffled towards his chair. From the corner of his eye he could see both Eraserhead and Shinso looking at him like he was insane. Nezu just looked thoughtful.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the tea now. Thanks.\u201d As Midoriya grabbed the small china cup, Shinso spoke up for the first time in that day.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you have against window locks?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey stop criminals from getting arrested,\u201d Shinso opened his mouth again, but Midoriya continued with a simple, \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya then waved his hand in a \u2018continue\u2019 motion as he sat down and sipped his tea. He then used years of experience to ignore the stares he was getting from both directions. I cannot believe I just did that. Oh my God, I just lost my once in a lifetime chance to be taught by Nezu. Why did I think that vandalizing his office was a good idea!? He looked nervously in Nezu\u2019s direction, but the principal was calmly sipping his tea. The rat(?) looked like he had seen this happen enough times that it did not ruffle him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright! Aizawa, do you have any more questions?\u201d All the attention shifted to the mammal as he looked in the teacher\u2019s direction. Eraserhead opened his mouth to speak but was swiftly cut off. \u201cNo? Well, that\u2019s good. In any case, you need to be creating Monday\u2019s lesson, correct?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...yes,\u201d Aizawa did not look very happy, but he left the room without a word. Midoriya\u2019s shoulders unconsciously relaxed while Shinso tensed up a bit. Neither of them knew exactly what was going on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, well, now we should begin,\u201d both Shinso and Midoriya perked up and were ready for whatever Nezu was going to say. \u201cFirst off, let me go through exactly what I want to teach you. If you have any concerns, please wait until I\u2019m done talking and then you\u2019ll be able to speak,\u201d he claps his hands together. \u201cShinso, bear with me for a moment. Once I\u2019m done I\u2019ll let you two get on your way. Now, Midoriya. Although you work mostly online we should probably fix the fact that you have the strength of a string bean. So you will have a two part day. The first part will be physical training. Aizawa will be in charge of that. Then, once you are done, I will teach you the online and in person versions of psychological warfare and strategy, as well as help you along with your hacking, and, if need be, your cases. How does that sound?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt sounds great!\u201d I wonder what weapons he\u2019d let me have? I don\u2019t like physical violence but it would be handy to have capture tools and maybe something for breaking and entering!\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. Now that that\u2019s settled I\u2019ll give the ropes to Shinso. Your guardians have already shown you around I presume.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d Shinso appeared to be wondering if he could start the tour immediately. I mean, Nezu does have a creepy vibe when he shows how much he knows. Wait, I wonder what people think of me when I do that? I don\u2019t know if I want to be as scary as Nezu, but it kinda would be fun.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlrighty then!\u201d Nezu stood up and took the stack of papers off his desk. He then walked over to Midoriya and gave them the stack. \u201cThis is going to be your schedule. You still have nine months until school ends, so you will not be here all the time. Even if I wanted to, I cannot take you out of school early,\u201d Midoriya looked down to see a time management chart on the paper. Every hour was scheduled out perfectly. \u201cNow, as you might have noticed, your physical portion will slowly get quicker. For example, if you go to the back of the stack, the ten kilometer run is now only an hour slot instead of three hour slots. As that happens, your intellectual time with me is slowly going to get longer, to take up the time you don\u2019t need. Any questions?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya was worried that Nezu was going to overestimate his physical abilities, but it looked like everything was planned out in a possible fashion. Nezu really knows what he\u2019s doing. Wow, I wonder how many people got a sheet exactly like this that are now heroes?\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd, finally, a word of advice. You are the first private student I\u2019ve ever taken on.\u201d What! That- that\u2019s incredible! Oh...wait. That means I\u2019m going to get a lot more attention doesn\u2019t it. \u201cSo, at the moment, only the teachers know about this. You can decide exactly how much you want people to know about our relationship yourself. Alright, now, look at the first page!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso and Midoriya both looked down to see \u201cThe tour\u201d starting at five o\u2019clock. A glance at the clock showed that it was, in fact, five o\u2019clock.\n\u00a0\nNezu smiled again, but it looked a little sadder. \u201cSo, as you\u2019ve probably figured out, it\u2019s time for you to leave. I will not see you again until Monday. But, in the time between now and then, you will need to give me a portfolio. Midoriya, you need to give me your most impressive cases, or just intellectual things you think I should know about.\u201d As Midoriya and Shinso tentatively stood up, Nezu herded them towards and out his office door. \u201cSee you Monday!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya spent more time staring at the office\u2019s closed door than he\u2019d like to admit. Shinso was the one to pull him out of it, by shaking him and starting the tour. He walked around, explaining the important landmarks and pointing stuff out.\n\u00a0\nAfter about an hour, Midoriya had gotten a in depth tour UA and knew more than most third years. The two boys said their goodbyes at the gate, and Midoriya continued on his way home. His face might have looked impassive, but his mind was a flurry of activity.\n\u00a0\nOh my God, did that really just happen?! I\u2019m Nezu\u2019s first ever private student! That\u2019s so scary! But, at the same time, I can use that to further my career. Wait, but I\u2019m probably going to be an underground hero, so that would be the opposite of what I want to do! It was only when he reached the door of his apartment that he asked the biggest question: What am I going to tell Kacchan when he finds out?!\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts who Smile Back\n\nDadzawa: I think I found a kid that\u2019s even crazier than Apparition\nApparition: uwu i have been summonedApparition: do tell me more\nDadzawa: His name is Midoriya Izuku and he used a pocket knife to destroy a window latch\nApparition: i think they called window locks\nTsalty: No, it\u2019s latchTsalty: And how did you find this kid?\nDadzawa: He was at UADadzawa: He\u2019s Nezu\u2019s personal student\n\u00a0\nMidoriya fell off of his chair and rolled onto the ground. His laughter echoed through the house and tears leaked from his eyes. Someone weirder than me, is me! Oh my god, this is so funny! \n\u00a0\nIt was nice having something to laugh about. Midoriya was still a little anxious about being Nezu\u2019s first student. It felt like he had so much more responsibility and had to live up to higher expectations. Midoriya wasn\u2019t sure that he could do it.\n\u00a0\nAnyway, not the issue, for now. I\u2019m two cases short for my quota and I don\u2019t have as much time as normal. So, what have I got? Midoriya migrated to his room and pulled a stack of folders from behind his bookshelf.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got Harbringer, but I\u2019m still kinda stuck on that and they seem to have gone underground.\u201d The manila folder was thrown towards his bed, and the next one was swiftly opened. \u201cThen there is Whisper, but I\u2019m pretty positive she\u2019s a reformed villain now, so I should probably burn that at some point. After that is Mind-twist, but so far they haven\u2019t really done any extreme crimes so far, so that\u2019ll go in the maybe pile. Next is Endeavor, but I don\u2019t have enough backing in the legal area to go after him\u2026 Wait!\u201d Midoriya tossed all of the remaining files to his desk and scrambled towards his phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello? Who is this?\u201d The faint mousy quality of Nezu\u2019s voice transferred over the phone and Midoriya smiled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, as your soon to be favorite student, how would you feel about supporting me in the legal field while I destroy Endeavor\u2019s life?\u201d Midoriya asked, which was probably extremely confusing to Nezu.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have sufficient evidence?\u201d That was Nezu\u2019s only response.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, want me to send it to you so you can check it over?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nUnnamed Chat\n\nMidoriya Izuku: d2yua5-...og666.MP4\nNezu: Thank you.Nezu: I\u2019ll look into it and see what I can do.\nMidoriya Izuku: ty\nNezu: But I do have a request of my own\nMidoriya Izuku: wut is it Midoriya Izuku: hit me bro\nNezu: Don\u2019t go taking people\u2019s phone numbers without their permission\nMidoriya Izuku: y notMidoriya Izuku: it doesnt hurt them\nNezu: Yes, but one day you might get caughtNezu: And I am having too much fun to let that happen\nMidoriya Izuku: wii both know the only person who could catch me is u \n\nMidoriya Izuku is now offline\n\n\nNezu is now offline\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkie dokie,\u201d Todoroki, hahahaha, get it? \u201ctime to find out how to ruin the number two hero\u2019s life. You know, normal stuff.\u201d Midoriya stuffed his phone into his pocket and tried to sort the files back into an attempt of order. Throwing this across the room wasn\u2019t really the best idea. Oops.____\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, so right now I have documented child abuse and neglect. I can probably get Todoroki Rei to give a statement, and maybe one other. But he\u2019s kind of a villain, so it might be hard. Anyway, I\u2019ve also got him for breaking a multitude of laws while fighting villains. Not to mention not paying for all of the property damage he has caused. So, yeah. Can you help?\u201d Midoriya finished and stared at his phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I had known you would call me at 3:45 in the morning I would never have agreed to help you.\u201d Nezu\u2019s voice ghosted over the line and Midoriya giggled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen too often. Hopefully. Anyway, you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. I can. With that evidence and my support I\u2019m sure we can take him down. Later. As in not now. Go to sleep Midoriya.\u201d The line goes dead and Midoriya collapses onto his bed. Slowly, he shoved his phone over into a corner and slid the Endeavor file back behind the bookshelf. \n\u00a0\nWelp, that was fun. Too bad I didn\u2019t get my two villains like I wanted. Midoriya paused in his mental dialogue and lifted his head to look at his clock. 3:46 blinked back at him. I have 3 hours and 30 minutes before I need to be up for school. That\u2019s probably enough time. A pause. Yeah, why not. Izuku stretched and sat back up. Without getting up Midoriya grabbed his computer and pulled it onto his lap. \n\u00a0\nThe green-haired teenager flicked onto incognito mode and started to look through easily accessible cameras. Then he remembered something. Wait, I\u2019ve seen a lot of villains going in and out of that one bar. Maybe I can see someone if I take a look over there. Midoriya didn\u2019t usually go over to that part of town, as it wasn\u2019t really filled with villain attacks, but watching that bar seemed like a good idea.\n\u00a0\nAnd, turns out, it was. As soon as Midoriya switched into the outside camera he saw a person walking out. This person had a very distinctive gait and an even more distinctive fashion sense. Lotus. I haven\u2019t seen you in a while. Midoriya had looked into Lotus a while back, but could never find anything concrete. It was a rumor that he had started his own organization and was never seen in public again. Perfect. You know what they say, cut off the head, and hope it doesn\u2019t grow back while multiplying. Actually, I don\u2019t think that last part is part of the saying. Oh well, it\u2019s too late now!\n\u00a0\nAs Lotus swiftly walked away, Midoriya followed, but from the confines of his room. The villain was super paranoid, it took him forty minutes to get to his hiding place when it should have only taken him fifteen. Sadly, as Lotus entered the building, Midoriya was stuck outside. There was nothing he could access. So, Midoriya hunkered down in his chair and got ready for a long wait. However, two hours after Izuku got bored and brought out his phone.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: i think i might have somethingApparition: like im 99% positiveApparition: and am hoping that the 1% doesn\u2019t get u killed\nDadzawa: What did you find? Dadzawa: And why this late?\nApparition: u know the answer to that by now\nApparition: so basically i-Apparition: asiuefaskldj\n\u00a0\nMidoriya was gaping at his screen. People had been coming in and out ever since Lotus went in, but Midoriya didn\u2019t know what they were doing and didn\u2019t recognize them so he put it to the back of his mind. But, now, it was obvious. They were loading a truck with crates. Each crate was about one foot wide and two feet tall. But the most important thing was the logo on the top of each one. A raven in a plague mask: The Shie Hassaikai. If those are the people making the stuff inside the creates, that means those crates contain Trigger!\nDadzawa: Apparition are you okay?\nApparition: aw im glad to see u careApparition: anyway anyone down for a 4 am drug bust? im talking at least one trucks worth of Trigger\n\nDadzawa is typing\n\n\nTsalty is typing\n\nTsalty: I've never known you to lie but Trigger hasn\u2019t been seen more than four ounces at a time in one place. If you\u2019re serious then this either means the Shie Hassaikai are somehow getting way more resources than we thought or this could cripple them at their beginning. \nDadzawa: I\u2019ve already contacted a backup team. What are the coordinates? \n\nApparition has sent you a location \n\nDadzawa: Thank you so much.\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\nApparition: aww youre gonna make me cri! Apparition: i feel so loved!\nTsalty: Really Apparition. Thank you.\nApparition: ncjbdhhcbhqahqubqiuduiqqbcaffectionnnnn\n\nApparition is now offline\n\nTsalty: Did I just break him?\n\nTsalty is now offline\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku sat back and flipped his screen to the news. Okay. It should be a bit before the news of the bust airs so I might.. as\u2026 well\u2026 He fell forward, face hitting the keyboard as he fell asleep, and didn\u2019t get any more work done that night.\nUgh, what time is it? Midoriya lifted his head from the keyboard and swiveled it until he could find his alarm clock. 6:58 blinked back at him. Time to get up. Midoriya quickly changed into his uniform and started on his hair. After what seemed like hours, actually only around ten minutes, his hair didn\u2019t resemble a bush. However, that was only thanks to a lot of product that Midoriya swirled in.\n\u00a0\nSatisfied with his appearance, Midoriya left the confines of his room and ventured down towards the kitchen. He opened the fridge and couldn\u2019t see anything worth eating, so he took out the cereal he kept around just in case this happened. Halfway through pouring himself a bowl, Midoriya Inko entered the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi mom. We need to go grocery shopping soon.\u201d Midoriya broke the silence. Inko startled, locked eyes with him, and then looked away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d She tried to add a happy note to her voice, but it still felt too fake. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d Still without looking at him, she turned and left the room.\n\u00a0\nGod I hate when she\u2019s like this. I mean I know she cares and stuff, but I can\u2019t remember the last time she tried to talk to me about the school bullies. And she doesn\u2019t ever say anything about my sleep schedule either. Hell she didn\u2019t even notice I wasn\u2019t in school yesterday! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about me being quirkless or something normal like that or if it\u2019s just about me\u2026 He looked down at his empty bowl and sighed before placing it in the sink, grabbing his bag, and leaving without another word. ____\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh look, it\u2019s Deku!\u201d One of Bakugou\u2019s extra\u2019s announced right after Midoriya entered the classroom. Quickly, Midoriya glanced around the room, but after not spotting a teacher, or anyone who would (was supposed to) care, he just lethargically meandered over to his desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, with all of those bags under his eyes, maybe we should change his nickname.\u201d Another one speaks up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo what? Zombie? Raccoon?\u201d A third extra sputtered into laughter and the rest joined in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah,\u201d this time it\u2019s Bakugou who speaks up. \u201cDeku is more accurate. I mean, who could be more useless than this quirkless freak!\u201d Midoriya finally reached his desk and he quickly hid all of his stuff underneath it. Through trial and error, Midoriya quickly learned that Bakugou was less likely to destroy something if it was hard to get.\n\u00a0\nThankfully, the group was too busy insulting him to change to anything physical. So it was easy to tune them out. Especially when Midoriya had something else on his mind.\n\u00a0\n\nNow\u2019s not the time to be worried about mom. There\u2019s more important stuff going on. Okay, so I have my Endeavor case in my portfolio, as well as Chameleon. I feel like Nezu would enjoy reading how I figured out one of his students was a villain. But I don\u2019t know what to add to it. I mean, all I do is look around some cameras. That\u2019s not very intellectual. Actually, I can show him how I learned to loop cameras and just hack into them! It\u2019s not about a case but it\u2019s still something I\u2019m proud of!\n\n\u00a0\nThus, the rest of the school day was filled with work. Midoriya went through all of his old files and research and compiled it into a file. The end result was a concise guide of how he went from eleven year old Midoriya to Apparition.____\n\u00a0\nThe only relief Midoriya got throughout the day was when we stood in front of UA. Bakugou\u2019s lackies had harassed him throughout the school day and even afterwards they tried to follow him to wherever he was going. This kind of behavior usually didn\u2019t get to him but having it go along with his mother\u2019s actions that morning Midoriya was feeling kind of down.\n\u00a0\nWhen Midoriya walked through the door into Nezu\u2019s office, the rat(?) immediately knew that the child was sad, but decided not to comment on it. So, as Midoriya sat down in his chair, Nezu started his speal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, so as you can see on your schedule, the first two hours will be a baseline test. I want to get a general idea of where you are and what you need to work on or don\u2019t need to work on. So, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u00a0\nNezu shuffled towards the door and motioned for Midoriya to follow him. As they went into the hallway Nezu took out his phone and sent off a quick text.\n\u00a0\n\nUnnamed Chat\n\nNezu: Hey, can you get them to Ground Beta?\nYamada Hizashi: Sure! Now? \nNezu: Yep! I\u2019m bringing someone for them to meet\n\u00a0\nDuring the walk, Midoriya got lost in his own thoughts. He hadn\u2019t even realized they had arrived until he looked up to see that they were in a fake city. What shocked him more was the group in front of him. He recognized them from the last Sports Festival as class 2-A. Oh my god this is so cool these kids are going to be heros!\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello class!\u201d Nezu greeted, making Izuku jump. Present Mic, aka Yamada Hizashi, nodded towards him and then left. Holy shit they\u2019re all looking at me what do I do whatdoIsayahhhh. \u201cLet me introduce my new private student Midoriya Izuku. I\u2019m trying to get a baseline about his mental capacities so if you all would be so kind as to allow him to analyze your quirks it would do me a great service.\u201d \n\u00a0\nA chorus of confused \u201csure?\u201ds and \u201cYeah why not\u201ds rang out and Nezu led him over to a bench in the shade to observe. The principal handed him a notebook, Where did he even get that?, before pulling out a computer to work. Midoriya looked between the group and the principal before getting to work. Okay so if I split this up into 19 sections then I\u2019ll have enough room for five pages on each student. That... should be enough? Alright who to- OH MY GOD HE\u2019S NAKED! Why would they not give him a gym uniform that he can\u2019t (is it teleportation?) lose. Okay I guess we\u2019re starting there. \n\u00a0\n\nWith the way he\u2019s moving I don\u2019t think it\u2019s teleportation. Usually teleporters have some type of visual alteration like a warp or faze. I wonder\u2026 maybe he\u2019s not teleporting but going through things. I mean if you look closely at the way he angles himself before he disappears and then again when he pops back up\u2026 Permeation? I\u2019ll write it as a possibility. Wait, his arm is through that girl? And it still looks full so he didn\u2019t teleport it, it must be Permeation. Okay so then maybe he could-\n\n\u00a0\nHe continued like this for around an hour as the class before him worked. By the time he had finished his notebook was filled to the brim with ideas and theories for each of them. He looked toward where Nezu was still typing away. \n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, Nezu Sir?\u201d He said, raising his hand awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ve finished, so you think I could interrupt their practice to ask about some of my theories?\u201d \n\u00a0\nThe rat(?) skimmed through the boy\u2019s notebook, or at least it looked like he was skimming. In all actuality he was taking in every word. After a minute or two he shut the notebook and handed it back with a smile playing on his lips. Does he even have lips?? \n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course! With analysis skills as lovely as yours I\u2019m sure they would love to hear what you have to say. Especially since they\u2019re working on preparing for their Midterms and would probably appreciate the help.\u201d Midoriya took the notebook back from his teacher and made his way over to the group of high schoolers. \n\u00a0\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d He said loudly enough for them to hear. The activity stopped and he had to stop himself from cowering under their eyes. \u201cI would like to share my notes with you all. I have a lot of theories about your quirks and how you might be able to use them and I would love some feedback.\u201d At first it was silent before a blond (thankfully no longer naked) boy spoke up. \n\u00a0\n\u201cSure dude! I\u2019d love to hear what you got on us!\u201d The others chimes in their agreement. While some were less open to the judgement than others, they all knew it would probably help to have input.\n\u00a0\nLuckily Nezu had thought ahead and had gotten him a notebook with pages that could be removed and reattached. Midoriya began to take out his pages and pass out each person\u2019s quirk analysis to them.\n\u00a0\nSoon the area was filled with the sound of shocked and enlightened students. Satisfied, Midoriya slid next to Nezu and asked, \u201cdid I pass your little test?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Midoriya. It\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n\nUnnamed Chat\n\nShinso Hitoshi: Yo Mido, where do you live?\nMidoriya Izuku: y do u want to know\nShinso Hitoshi: Because I want to know where your base of operations is\nMidoriya Izuku: weird but okay\nMidoriya Izuku sent a location\n___\nMidoriya was forced away from his computer when he heard a knock on the door. He heard his mother get up to open it, her footsteps light on the floor. The door creaked open and he could almost make out Inko talking with someone else. They sounded vaguely familiar. Then two sets of footsteps entered the house and one came towards Midoriya\u2019s room.\n\u00a0\nSomeone knocked on his door, \u201cMidoriya? I know this is kind of sudden, but I wanted to hang out. Hope this is okay?\u201d Midoriya leapt up from his bed, ran to the door, and threw it open. In front of him was a surprised purple-haired boy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShinso? Come on in! It\u2019s great to see you. Those bullies aren\u2019t giving you any trouble are they?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso hesitantly walked towards Midoriya\u2019s bed and sat down. \u201cNo, I just wanted to hang out. I mean, we only really met that one time so I figured it would be good for us to actually officially meet in person.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya beamed. It had been such a long time since someone actually wanted to hang out with him. Then the awkward silence came in. Neither of them really knew what to say because neither of them had ever really wanted to start a conversation. Thankfully, Inko coming in the room holding snacks brought the tension down.\n\u00a0\nThe plate held one drink and a small sandwich. It was obviously meant just for Shinso.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMom, why is there only one sandwich and drink?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman looked at least a little apologetic, \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t gone shopping lately so we didn\u2019t have enough food for two snacks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought I told you to go shopping a couple days ago? And I thought you did!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s words were mad, but his tone was resigned. This was obviously a normal occurrence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, yes, I did go shopping, but not for snack foods. There\u2019s always a snack bar at my work so I guess I forgot,\u201d The plump greenette put the tray down and made a hasty escape from the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, is that normal?\u201d Shinso turned to look at Midoriya, and then glanced back at the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, no. This week has been pretty stressful for her so\u2026\u201d Midoriya didn\u2019t feel the need to finish his lie. I wonder if she actually forgot or if she just decided I didn\u2019t need any food.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, do you want it or should I eat it?\u201d Midoriya picked up the plate and moved it towards Shinso. The purple boy quickly digged in and smiled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re hungry. Is Dadzawa not feeding you enough?\u201d Shinso choked on the sandwich and whipped around to face Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDadzawa?\u201d Shinso repeated. Midoriya nodded and laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019ve never heard me say that before?\u201d Midoriya teased.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, can\u2019t say I have. And to answer your last question, he has been, but he\u2019s also been training me. That alone makes me hungry. Being taught by two pro her-\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s in a RELATIONSHIP?!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Yeah, he\u2019s married.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI HAD NO IDEA! I HAVE THREE DADS?!\u201d Midoriya jumped up and started to pace around the room mumbling. \u201cWait, I shouldn\u2019t automatically assume that they\u2019re a guy, but whocoulditbeit\u2019snotanyundergroundhero-.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPresent Mic.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re kidding!\u201d Izuku sat down on the floor and began to laugh hysterically. \u201cIt\u2019s like if an old cat was married to a golden retriever puppy! Oh god I\u2019m never letting him live this down!\u201d At the puppy comment Shinso joined him in his laughter. After a few moments Midoriya sat up looking like he had had an epiphany. \u201cOh my god we should go to a cat cafe!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey shared a look before rushing to get their things and running out the door. Quickly, they put on their shoes and ripped open the door. They finally reached the street, and as they walked the few blocks to the cafe they chatted calmly. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, bud, pal, my boi, tell me everything about Dadzawa and Present Mic. Their lifestyle, pets, relationship, anything I can use against him. Be my spy.\u201d Midoriya began.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, sure. Did you know Aizawa has three cats?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cGasp! No way what are their names? Tell me everything!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid- did you just say gasp??\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. I do that. Get over it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, well he has a big, chunky, brownish gold one named Fax Machine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my GOD!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s a black long thin boi named Sonic; he probably has a speed quirk. According to Yamada they once had him race Ingenium and he only lost by like four milliseconds!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGeez.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, and then his last cat is a small light brown one named Chicken.\u201d Shinso finished.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI never thought I could love him more but there you go.\u201d Midoriya laughed. They stopped at a crosswalk and Midoriya turned towards Shinso. \u201cOkay, tell me more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUmmm, I\u2019ll sometimes find Aizawa in the living room in his sleeping bag. He\u2019s not even asleep though. He just stares at me when I enter and then goes back to looking at the ceiling. Once, Yamada entered and dragged him back into their room muttering something. It was a time.\u201d As Shinso finished telling the story Midoriya started to hysterically laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe-has a what now?! When did that happen?! And why don\u2019t I have one?!\u201d Is all he said when he could finally breathe again. \n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Ask him. You do have his number.\u201d Shinso replied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup. I\u2019ll do it when I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Midoriya answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMood. Anyway, nothing too exciting has happened. Yamada tries to curve Aizawa\u2019s insanity around me, so that stops me from having funny stories.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNoooo, Present Mic! I need the blackmail material!\u201d Midoriya wailed and this time it was Shinso\u2019s turn to start laughing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOmg Midoriya no. Why do you-\u201d Right before Shinso could finish the sentence someone else interrupts him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi! Shitty Deku! What are you doing here? And who\u2019s your dumbass boyfriend? Did he know you were quirkless when he agreed to hang out with you? Or did you have to bribe him?\u201d Bakugou sneered as he stalked towards the duo. His palms were sparking threateningly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-it\u2019s not like that Kacchan! Shi- my friend knows that I\u2019m quirkless! And he still decided to hang out with me!\u201d Shinso looked at Midoriya in confusion, and saw the quirkless boy\u2019s face. Midoriya was obviously trying to be brave, but his eyes were terrified and face pale. Looking back at the stranger in front of them, Shinso decided to intervene.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd, who exactly are you?\u201d The bully started to answer, but was quickly cut off. His eyes turned glassy and his body grew slack. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wait here for five minutes, forget this entire encounter, and then snap out of my brainwashing,\u201d the blond boy nodded and Shinso pulled Midoriya away.\n\u00a0\nIt was only when they had gotten to the cafe and sat down that Shinso looked back at Midoriya. He couldn\u2019t see any trace of the previous fear. In fact, the boy looked ecstatic.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was your quirk!? It\u2019s fantastic! I mean, I already kind of knew what it was but seeing it in person was just so cool! I really hope you get into the hero course- not that I didn\u2019t already- because that kind of quirk has so many applications!\u201d Midoriya trailed off at the look on Shinso\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice. And you can ask me as many questions as you want about it, but first I have a question for you. What was that guy\u2019s quirk?\u201d Shinso had seen some sparks on the blonde\u2019s palm, but he wanted to be sure.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s explosions.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWas he the one that gave you those burns I saw when I first met you?\u201d Midoriya looked down. That was a yes then. \u201cHow come you felt the need to get all up in my life? You got me away from those kids, you got me fucking ADOPTED, and yet you\u2019re barely being fed it seems, and you get bullied, and you haven\u2019t done ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF. How is that fair?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere- there aren\u2019t any c-camera\u2019s in our school,\u201d Midoriya said. Shinso was taken aback by how scared he looked. \u201cAnd M-Mom\u2019s fine. I mean there\u2019s usually s-something in the house be-because she needs to eat t-too s-so\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey. Hey look, I\u2019m sorry I got so mad. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you. And why don\u2019t you tell Aizawa about what\u2019s going on? He and Tsukauchi could help you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo they can\u2019t!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s eyes were a mess of fear and rage. Shinso didn\u2019t know what to make of the way he was acting but it was obvious he had hit a sore spot. \u201cI learned a long time ago that the only person you can trust to take care of you is yourself! You deciding that, just because he says he cares about you, is enough to put your life in his hands is a mistake that you can make by yourself!\u201d \n\u00a0\nShinso was stunned. Tears began to fall from Midoriya\u2019s eyes as he sat back down from where he had risen. \u201cPeople say they care about you but really the only person anyone can afford to look out for is them, and I\u2019m not going to risk being able to help people just because I think they can help me. Nobody truly cares about a quirkless boy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYa know.\u201d Shinso soothed, trying to get the boy to relax. \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, kind of, about not trusting others. I still haven\u2019t told anyone a lot of things because I don\u2019t want to ruin the few decent relationships I have. I mean, everyone already hates me for my quirk. It's not like they need another thing to hate me for on top of that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know you can tell me anything you want to. And if this is about someone else I\u2019ll get them for it.\u201d The shorter of the two looked up at the purple boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about anyone else, don't worry.\u201d The taller took a deep breath. Midoriya could tell that this was hard for him and put his hand over the other\u2019s. \u201cUm, so I might be non-binary...?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey that\u2019s cool! I get it. I\u2019ve been wondering about my sexuality for a while and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m pan!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m asexual, but I\u2019m romantically attracted to guys.\u201d The two sat in silence for a moment. Oh god I really fucked up didn\u2019t I. I shouldn\u2019t have blown up at him- wait shit, them- like that. I was just really scared they\u2019d tell Aizawa and I-. God I\u2019m so glad they aren\u2019t mad at me though. Or maybe they\u2019re just not showing it. What if they are mad and don't want to be my friend any more?? \n\u00a0\nShinso could tell that Midoriya was inwardly freaking out, so they did their best to get him out of his head. By, of course, throwing a cat at the boy. The cat did not actually hit him in the face but instead gracefully landed on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder and curled up, looking like being thrown happened all the time. Shinso looked towards Midoriya who was standing super still, looking just a little terrified.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you not like cats? Oh I am so sorry I just thought that since it was your idea and-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Midoriya waved off Shinso\u2019s concerns, \u201cI love them but I\u2019ve never had one as a pet so I don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso giggled, walked over and taught Midoriya how to deal with a cat. By the end of their time at the cafe both middle schoolers were laughing and talking. Sadly, they had to go their separate ways but they went home with plans to hang out again and a deeper understanding of one another.\n\u201cStop.\u201d At the harsh tone Midoriya immediately stopped typing. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong. Instead of trying to sneak around the firewalls, break them and then patch them up before they notice. For one, it\u2019s faster, and two, you can make a backdoor for yourself at the same time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that would work in this situation. If you look at the code you can see alarms written in. It would take longer to find a spot to break down the wall than to pick it apart.\u201d Midoriya countered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. Look closer. Those alarms aren\u2019t for people trying to bypass the wall, it\u2019s for people trying to change it. The code is slightly different, but it\u2019s understandable that you missed it.\u201d Nezu stepped away and went towards his tea pot. \u201cTea?\u201d Midoriya doesn\u2019t answer and continues to work on breaking into the government quirk registry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTADA! Haha suckers, nothing is safe from me.\u201d Midoriya finally broke through and pushed his feet up, chair spinning backwards.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd just in time. It\u2019s already six, so it is time for you to leave. Have a great day Midoriya.\u201d Nezu replied from behind his desk, while sipping tea. Why does Nezu like tea so much? Like I know it's good for brain power, but yeesh. Midoriya bowed before slipping out of the office. He walked down a few halls before turning into the boys bathroom.\n\u00a0\nAfter closing the door behind him he flipped open his trusty pocket knife, and made quick work of unscrewing the bolts keeping the vent cover in place. He looked around for anyone who may be watching and jumped up. Midoriya grabbed the edge of the vent and hauled himself into it. Replacing the cover and dropping the bolts into his pocket he began to crawl through the conveniently large vents. \n\u00a0\nOkay, where to first. So, there\u2019s a classroom a few lefts over, but I don\u2019t think anyone would be in there. After that, the next interesting place would be the closet that everyone conveniently hides in when they\u2019re having a bad day. Midoriya had found people there crying at least five times. He always leaves the vents to try to comfort them, and has left multiple people thinking he was a fever dream. One even screamed and tried to kill him. Alas, I don\u2019t want to be attacked again, so I\u2019ll give that one a pass. Okay, the next best gossip corner\u2026 would be the teacher's lounge. Welp, let\u2019s see what they\u2019re talking about today.\n\u00a0\nA few turns and bumped heads later, Midoriya reached his destination. Looking down from the vent he could see his favorite group of teachers causing their usual chaos.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, gossip time. What weird shit has your guy\u2019s classes done?\u201d Conveniently, Midnight asked exactly what Midoriya wanted to hear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, someone blew up my classroom.\u201d Powerloader began. \u201cThey decided that mixing two very explosive chemicals would be a good idea. Thankfully, no one was hurt, although they are now blue.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, like everything blue, or just skin or hair?\u201d Present Mic asked. Oooooo, Present Mic, the husband of my soul father. Must learn more. \n\u00a0\n\u201cEverything. Their clothes, hair, eyes, skin. They\u2019re blue now.\u201d Powerloader turned towards Aizawa. \u201cNow I can understand why you expelled your entire class.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not surrounded by idiots.\u201d Aizawa sighed. \u201cSo, you know how Nezu asked me and Shinso to go to his office.\u201d Everyone nodded, and Midnight leaned closer, eager to know what happened. \u201cWell, a kid, Shinso\u2019s age, was already there. And apparently he has something against window latches,\u201d locks \u201cbecause in the middle of the meeting he goes over and uses a knife to flick Nezu\u2019s window latch into the ceiling.\u201d Now done, Aizawa zipped up his sleeping bag, and closed his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh THAT\u2019S why my classroom doesn\u2019t have any window latches!\u201d Midnight responded. \n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought all of mine had lost their lives to explosions. Huh, maybe that kid did it all along.\u201d Powerload added.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, on that note I have a fun fact: did you know oxygen can actually kill people that have breathing problems?\u201d Present Mic broke the silence and looked around with a shit-eating grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo can I, what\u2019s your point?\u201d Midoriya replied. Aizawa\u2019s eyes opened and everyone\u2019s head whipped towards the vent. \u201cOops, didn\u2019t mean to say that out loud.\u201d Quickly, Midoriya took out his knife and unscrewed the vent. Gracefully, he dropped out and gave a bow. \u201cGreetings, it is I, Nezu\u2019s personal gremlin.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe teachers just kept staring. It was getting kind of uncomfortable. Then, Aizawa closed his eyes and sighed, cocooning once more. \u201cWait, so you\u2019re the kid Aizawa was talking about?\u201d Midnight questioned. Midoriya walked over to the sink and started to pour himself a glass of water.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup. That\u2019s me. And Powerloader, I will have you know that I only got rid of half of the window locks. The other half were missing when I got there.\u201d Midoriya sipped the water and stared down the teachers, most of which looked like they were contemplating the downside of yeeting themselves out of the lockless windows of the lounge. \n\u00a0\n\u201cGreen hair, green eyes, freckles, short. Hold up, are you the guy in that one closet that only appears when someone is crying?\u201d Snipe asked. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAgain, yep. Nice to know that I have a reputation.\u201d The teachers all seemed to have gotten over their shock and began to ask him questions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, so why are you here?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cNezu found me\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a uniform on?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cEw\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you meet Shinso?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cSaved the- him from some bullies.\u201d  Come on Midoriya, don't out Shinso. You don't know who knows and who doesn't. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s so awesome. Are you aiming to become a hero?\u201d Midoriya looked like he\u2019d been hit by a very angsty bus. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHold up on the questions please. I think it\u2019s time for me to ask some of my own.\u201d He responded, clearly dodging the question. The teachers nodded, Aizawa looked worried. \u201cSo, you guys have known Present Mic for a while, yes?\u201d They nodded again. Present Mic looked both scared and intrigued \u201cGreat. So, if Present Mic died would he be Past Mic??\u201d What the heck? Why did I ask that? Where has my brain and anxiety gone?\n\u00a0\nThen the room exploded in laughter. Present Mic was rolling on the floor clutching his chest as he struggled to breathe. The other teachers were either looking nonplussed, or were also dying of laughter. Thankfully, for Midoriya\u2019s mental stability, it was mostly the latter.\n\u00a0\nMidnight was trying to choke out some words, \u201cI...had...never...thought...of...that! Here...lies...Past Mic\u201d A big pause as she tried to catch her breath, \u201cwe...will...miss...him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya took this as his que to continue on his journey, creeping out of the room and leaving UA. Well, I think I made a good official first impression?\nMidoriya walked into his room and flopped on his bed. Wow as fun as working with Nezu is, it\u2019s honestly super exhausting. Especially with the whole Endeavor case. I keep slacking on my vigilante work too, I really should catch up with that. Okay, come on, get up! The tired boy forced himself to move to his computer. Searching the news he realized how much he\u2019d been slacking off. Pulling up different taps he quickly had over twenty cases from the past few days that he hadn\u2019t yet handled, all of which looked simple (Thank God criminals are stupid), and got to work. \n\u00a0\nWhen he next looked at the clock it read 6 am. Shit. I have school tomorrow. Eh too late now, I only have two left, I might as well just finish them. \n\u00a0\nHalf an hour later he had compiled the twenty completed cases into a folder and opened his dad chat.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for ghosts who smile back\n\nApparition: sorry for the delay stuff happened and chaos ensuedApparition: here ya goApparition: 27asd...98hsa36k\nDadzawa: OH THANK GOD YOU\u2019RE OKAYDadzawa: Where have you been?! We were worried sick!\nTsalty: Ha, Aizawa you owe me thirty bucks, I told you he wasn\u2019t dead.Tsalty: But seriously, WHERE WERE YOU?!\nApparition: like i said stuff happenedApparition: its fine im okay i kinda got found out but its fine and everything is good now\nDadzawa: Someone found out who you are?! Who?!\nTsalty: How much money do you want for the name of the person who found you\nApparition: geez and here i was starting to think u loved me\nTsalty: I just looked at the folder you sent. Did you seriously solve twenty three cases in one single night?\nApparition: yup im just that good\nTsalty: Okay I\u2019m off to go file these.\n\nTsalty is now offline\n\nDadzawa: I still can\u2019t believe whoever found you hasn\u2019t spoken up to the police about it yet. \nApparition: oh that part was easy i just befriended them\nDadzawa: Why would I expect anything else honestly. \nApparition: wait dont u have class soon ure a teacher???\nDadzawa: No. I expelled my entire class. \nApparition: thats\u2026 terrifying but not unbelievable \nDadzawa: Thank you.\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\nMidoriya got startled by his alarm clock ringing beside him. Jeez, I\u2019m already awake. Yeesh. Slowly, the hacker rubbed his eyes, got dressed, and set off to make breakfast. The morning routine was practically muscle memory to do, so it didn\u2019t really matter that Midoriya was falling asleep where he stood.\n\u00a0\nSadly, that was not the case once school started. Even if all the studies were easy, the teachers weren\u2019t really fond of him falling asleep in class. The sound of a textbook hitting the floor was ingrained in his memory, as that\u2019s what the teachers used to wake him up. Still, they went easy on Midoriya with the punishments- that is to say that they didn\u2019t give him any- because no one wanted to spend more time in his presence then they had to.\n\u00a0\nBakugou especially was annoyed, because, apparently, falling asleep was looking down on people and not just trying to get some rest. The more you know I guess.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE YOU DEKU?!\u201d Bakugou snarled as he gripped Midoriya\u2019s uniform. I hope he doesn\u2019t decide to ruin this one as well, you can only have so many spares. \u201cFALLING ASLEEP IN CLASS LIKE YOU\u2019RE BETTER THAN ALL OF US!!!\u201d Midoriya, although his internal monologue was snarky, paled while facing the explosion boy\u2019s wrath. \n\u00a0\nBakugou saw this reaction and smirked, like he had won that round. Like he had never not won. Then, he let go of Midoriya\u2019s collar and strutted away. He\u2019s like a damn peacock.\n\u00a0\nAs Midoriya walked home from school he could only sigh in relief at the lack of burns on his skin or uniform. Maybe I should invest in learning how to sew. It would be useful for patching up any holes in my uniforms and then I won\u2019t have to buy as many. Or I could learn how to fireproof them! I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a thing. In any case, that\u2019s a project for another time. I might have figured out twenty cases last night but I\u2019m still behind. As Izuku got to his house, he quickly walked in and got to his room. From there, he moved onto the villain spotting forums and looked to see if there was anyone new. No one. So he kept going until his phone started ringing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is Nezu. I was calling you to see if you wanted to go to UA during your school hours tomorrow to see the recommendation exams,\u201d Midoriya had heard about the recommendation exams, but had never thought he would be able to see them!\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! That would be great. But, uh, I have a couple questions. When is it, how would I get there, and what would I be doing?\u201d The greenette had no idea how he could possibly get out of school, even if it was to go to UA.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it will be at 10 am tomorrow, I would probably send a car with a pro hero who can use their influence to get you out of school, and you would be using your analysis skills to not analyze the examenes quirks, but their mental state. Todoroki would be there so I figured it would be a good lead into psychoanalysis. I mean I would have you take the exam but considering you\u2019re my personal student you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve already guaranteed your spot in class 1-A,\u201d Just hearing those words made Midoriya giddy (and also made him kind of want to cry). It was still almost impossible to believe that he was going to be an official student at UA.\n____\nThe next day Izuku woke up the second his alarm rang. He quickly jumped out of bed, rushed through his routine, and sat on his couch to wait. Bouncing a leg he looked at the time on his phone, only to realize that he had more than three hours before the exam. Much less excited, he went back up to his room and pulled up the news, hoping to get some work done before his escort arrived. \n\u00a0\nHe ran downstairs as soon as he heard the door shut, only to find that it had been his mother leaving. Geez I really really need to calm down. Okay back to work. Then, a few seconds later, the doorbell rang, which jolted him from his thoughts and he raced to the door. He ripped it open with far too much force, facing the hero before him with a large grin on his face. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHi Fatgum, sir.\u201d Midoriya stuttered and stared at the high level hero.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello! I\u2019m gonna assume that you are Midoriya Izuku!?\u201d Fatgum questioned and Midoriya nodded his head. \u201cGreat, come with me.\u201d Together, they close the door and walk down towards his car. It was a sleek black color, and obviously high tech. Fatgum opened the door, and Midoriya scrambled inside. Fatgum then squished into the front seat, after making himself smaller. \n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, Midoriya, we\u2019ll need to go to your school first. Mind giving me the name?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, of course. It\u2019s Aldera Middle School.\u201d Midoriya responded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Aldera.\u201d Fatgum started the car and pulled into the street. \u201cI know it. Seemed like a good school.\u201d Yeah, if you\u2019re not quirkless. Then it\u2019s just a nightmare. \n\u00a0\nA few minutes later they arrived in front of Midoriya\u2019s school. Wow, driving is a lot faster than walking. Usually it would take me thirty minutes to get here!\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s go get you signed out.\u201d Fatgum reached for his door and Midoriya panicked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I can go myself. They\u2019ll let me sign myself out, you don\u2019t need to bother.\u201d Midoriya stumbled through his words, trying to convey the feeling of \u2018please don\u2019t come with me\u2019.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat school would let a kid sign out by himself? Plus, it\u2019s no problem Midoriya; I have time. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d Fatgum pushed open the door and Midoriya did the same. Almost immediately, his classmates locked on to the fact that a hero was there, and that he was with Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Midoriya. Finally getting yourself locked up I see!\u201d One yelled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks Fatgum! We really owe you for taking out the trash!\u201d Fatgum looked horrified at what the students were saying. Midoriya just stared at the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa I bet he\u2019s getting taken in \u2018cause a hero saw him try to kill himself, the little shit bastard! HAHA.\u201d Another voice shouted from behind them, snickering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, let\u2019s move quickly. I want to get out of this place as soon as possible.\u201d Fatgum sped up, making Midoriya move faster as well. In record time, Midoriya was signed out and back in the car. I guess being a hero really does have its perks. No one dared to question him.\n\u00a0\nOnce inside the safety of the car, the hero turned to face him. \u201cMidoriya, what was that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think you know what that was.\u201d Midoriya whispered back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need to hear you say it. Are you being bullied?\u201d Midoriya nodded, but Fatgum kept staring at him. \u201cYou have to say it. I can\u2019t do anything without a verbal response.\u201d \u2026Why does he care? It doesn\u2019t matter, he won\u2019t do anything anyway. I\u2019m not worth it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m being bullied.\u201d Fatgum turned back towards the front and started the car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s time to talk to Nezu then. Good thing we\u2019re already going to UA.\u201d\nThe car pulled up to UA\u2019s back entrance. The ride had been silent, both of them too lost in thought to notice. They stepped out of the car and made their way into the school, walking through the halls until they reached Nezu\u2019s office. After knocking swiftly on the door they found it unlocked and moved inside, taking a seat on the couch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWere you aware,\u201d Fatgum began, \u201cthat Midoriya is being aggressively bullied and suicide bated at his school?\u201d Midoriya flinched and looked towards the ground. Don\u2019t bother. He won\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d The principle responded coldly. \u201cI was in fact not made aware of this. Care to explain?\u201d Both heads turned to Midoriya who looked about ready to crawl into a hole and die. \n\u00a0\n \u201cH-Hey I mean th-there\u2019s n-not much to explain r-really. I\u2019m qu-quirkless and\u2026 yeah\u201d God, that went awful. And I thought I\u2019d gotten better with my stuttering what was that?! Why are they still talking about this?\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, I don\u2019t want to come off as intrusive or rude, but that wasn\u2019t nothing.\u201d Fatgum seemed scared, as if he was going to set Izuku off somehow. \u201cThe second they saw you they began to taunt you and insinuate that you were either an awful person or had severe depression. It\u2019s concerning to say the least.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook i-it\u2019s nothing really. And I mean I just had this conversation with Shinso a few days ago I really don\u2019t need to have it again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNezu leveled him with a glare. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between saving Shinso from his bullies and saving yourself from yours? Why let this go on for however long? I want you to give me one good, logical reason why you haven\u2019t turned in these kids before I go and do it myself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, i-in the beginning, it w-was because ther-there weren\u2019t any cameras,\u201d Midoriya didn\u2019t look up from the ground, \u201cb-but then it was ju-just too much effort. No-nothing was go-going to come from it a-anyway. Pl-plus, it-it\u2019s better if they hu-hurt me, because th-then they are-aren\u2019t hurting anyone else. An-and it\u2019s not like anyone w-would have believed me anyway. They never did before at least.\u201d The last part was whispered under his breath but the two adults heard it anyway. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that is all going to change.\u201d Nezu leaned back into his chair. \u201cAldera is going to dread the day they got on my bad side.\u201d His words were so final that Midoriya was forced to believe them, which went against everything he believed. Oh god this is going to be a disaster.\n\u00a0\nAn alarm went off near Nezu\u2019s paw and he shut it off. \u201cWell, enough chit chat. We have an exam to watch.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I guess it\u2019s time I leave then.\u201d Fatgum headed towards the door. \u201cNice meeting you Midoriya. I hope we can see more of each other.\u201d He pulled the door open and left. Nezu moved towards the door and motioned Midoriya to follow him. The two then made their way to the room that held the recommendations students. \n\u00a0\nThere were six in total. However, Midoriya only recognized two of them, Shoto Todoroki and Shinso Hitoshi, but the girl with the dark ponytail definitely rang a bell as well. Huh, I\u2019m shocked Iida Tenya isn\u2019t here, I know he\u2019s my age. I guess he\u2019s taking the normal exam. Probably wants to prove himself to his brother. Man, I\u2019ve only seen him once on camera, but he really has an issue with rule-breaking and anything not \u2018perfectly amazing and good\u2019.\n\u00a0\nOh right, I\u2019m not here to just watch. I have to analyze their mental states. Okay who should I- oh. Oh god. Midoriya took one real look at the Todoroki boy and instantly knew something was severely wrong. Between the look in his eyes, his hard expression, the scar on his face, and the way he kept looking at his father it was so obvious that Midoriya wanted to personally punch any and everyone who didn\u2019t instantly see it. Todoroki radiated \u2018abuse victim\u2019 so heavily that he actually had to look away from the boy\u2019s dull, pained eyes in order to not cry. Midoriya had known that the man was abusing him, but he hadn\u2019t expected the young Todoroki to be like this!\n\u00a0\nMidoriya didn\u2019t know if it was Endeavor himself who gave him that scar but considering it was on his fire side that wouldn\u2019t make any sense. Logically, shouldn\u2019t that side be fireproof\u2026? Then\u2026 freezer burn maybe? Oh. OH. And it\u2019s on his- Oh my god. No wonder his mom is in a mental hospital, what did Endeavor do to her that would make her do that to him? I mean, it has to be his mom. I knew Endeavor was the fucking WORST but it\u2019s so much worse in person. He was shaken out of his muttering spiral by Nezu who simply gave him a look that seemed to say \u2018yeah I see it too, revenge will be drawn out and painful\u2019. \n\u00a0\nOkay, so Todoroki has too many issues to deal with right now. Let\u2019s move on to the other people. After an analysis of the others in the room he had deduced that the only other visible issues would be ponytail-girl\u2019s clear self-confidence shortage and the tall, loud boy\u2019s attitude, which wasn\u2019t exactly an issue, but it was definitely not great for a hero to be so brash, loud, aggressive. It also seemed to either scare or annoy the others in the room. However, the tall kid also seemed to radiate a hatred of Endeavor, and Todoroki. Huh, let\u2019s go see what I can find out.\n\u00a0\nBut, before Midoriya could get to that kid, a familiar face blocked his way.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShinso! Hi, how are you?\u201d Midoriya ran up to the middle schooler and hugged him tightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTerrible. I haven\u2019t slept and my anxiety is through the roof.\u201d The kid\u2019s words were deadpan, but their eyes were light.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOof,\u201d Midoriya scowled. \u201cIn any case, are you excited?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you I\u2019m scared out of my mind?! Anyway, are you going to take the exam as well?\u201d Shinso asked, not quite believing that Midoriya wouldn\u2019t die going against the other contestants.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just doing some stuff for Nezu.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be doing that then? We wouldn\u2019t want you to get caught just talking to me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCaught? Don\u2019t know her,\u201d Shinso pointed over to Nezu, obviously thinking about how the rat caught him. \u201cOkay, yeah, but now he\u2019s on my side!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t be if you don\u2019t do your job,\u201d Midoriya huffed and nodded his agreement, giving the purplette a good luck hug before scanning the room once more.\n\u00a0\n\nAlright! Let\u2019s get this party started. First off, dude with a probably unhealthy amount of hate for Todoroki!\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Midoriya left Shinso and creeped up on attitude-boy. The boy whipped around and stared at him in surprise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy name is Inasa Yoarashi! Who are you?\u201d Midoriya flinched away from the influx of noise coming off of the hopeful UA student. God he\u2019s like a walking headache.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya Izuku.\u201d Midoriya glanced around and was happy to see that the Todorokis were nowhere near them. \u201cSo, what do you have against the Todoroki family.\u201d Inasa immediately looked annoyed. I guess it\u2019s a sore subject.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEndeavor is a terrible hero. He doesn\u2019t have the passion to be a true hero.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve got to agree with the terrible hero part,\u201d Inasa looked at Midoriya in surprise, \u201cbut Endeavor has plenty of passion. I mean, not for the correct things, like being a good person and not \u2018accidentally\u2019 killing hundreds of people, but he has passion for being the best. So, that specific emotion isn\u2019t an issue. And besides, hero\u2019s don\u2019t need passion,\u201d A pause, and Midoriya rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cAnway, thought I would give you a little life lesson from a fellow recommendation student.\u201d Ha, me, a recommendation student. I mean, kinda I am, but not in this situation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for your wisdom! I have realized the error in my thinking,\u201d Inasa bowed, almost hitting his head on the floor in the process and started to move away from Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. I\u2019ve got more wisdom. Can\u2019t back out now,\u201d Inasa looked slightly worried, but stayed where he was. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal with Todoroki?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe has Endevor\u2019s eyes. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone other than himself.\u201d Inasa glared at the younger Todoroki. What the fuck! His eyes?! There is something wrong with this guy if he judges a person based off of their eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not gonna touch the eye thing for a few seconds. Have you ever met the guy?\u201d Inasa slowly shook his head. \u201cOh my god you\u2019re an idiot. For one, I\u2019ll have you know that Todoroki has lived a worse life than you will ever know. So, give him the benefit of the doubt. Second, DON\u2019T JUDGE A PERSON YOU DON\u2019T KNOW! Third, let\u2019s talk about judging someone because they have the same eyes as a person you hate. Don\u2019t. He\u2019s Endeavor\u2019s son. It\u2019s not a mystery as to why he has his eyes. They\u2019re related. Don\u2019t get me wrong, being related to a flaming trash can doesn\u2019t make you a flaming trash can, but it is possible to inherit a flaming trash chan's eye color.\u201d Inasa stared at Midoriya as he started ranting. He looked like he wanted to step away, but every time he started Midoriya would glare at him. \u201cSo, what have we learned?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot to judge a person you don\u2019t know.\u201d Inasa mumbled. Ha, I even scared him into being quieter. If I had known that would work I would have done it from the beginning. And I got mad enough not to be shy. It was a win win.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood. Goodbye.\u201d Midoriya flipped around and walked away. Ugh, now I should probably talk to Todoroki. His eyes alight on the insecure girl. Or her. Sure, why not.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, how are you?\u201d Midoriya again snuck up on the student and she stepped a few steps away from him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh, good.\u201d Shaking her head, she stared Midoriya head on, and held out her hand. \u201cYaoyorozu Momo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya shook her hand and answered, \u201cMidoriya Izuku. So, are you excited?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor?\u201d Midoriya motioned around him. \u201cOh, not really. More like nervous.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy? You got this far. That means you have to have the mind and ability to do well. Plus, there are always other schools. I\u2019m sure one of them would be smart enough to accept someone like you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d Yaoyorozu questioned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone smart and talented.\u201d Well, at least I\u2019m more subtle this time. But now it sounds like I\u2019m flirting. Which was not the point. Oh, well. Maybe it will help in the long run. I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, she\u2019s beautiful, but she\u2019s not really my type. Ya know what? I\u2019m just gonna shut up now. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great. See you later.\u201d\nMidoriya walked away and found an empty area of the room. He sighed, and then pulled out his phone.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghost Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: kids r literal demons\nDadzawa: Yes, yes they are.\nApparition: y do u teach them for a living\nDadzawa: Peer pressure\nTsalty: Why are you talking about kids? Did you find a young villain?\nApparition: yes, ill send it later, but thats not whyApparition: kids are bad at feelings and i have to fix their feelingsApparition: which makes me want to stab something\nDadzawa: This is why I don\u2019t care enough about my students to get invested in their mental states\nApparition: ha but now u have a sonApparition: u have to deal with his shitApparition: also ive seen the UA security cams and we all know ure the class dad so shut up \nTsalty: He\u2019s not wrong\nDadzawa: Why are you attacking me? And what do you mean youe seen the UA cams?!\nApparition: r u really surprised. im everywhere\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\u00a0\nMidoriya pocketed his phone and turned to the main issue in the room. Todoroki Shoto, let\u2019s see what demons you\u2019ve got locked up tight.\nMidoriya walked over to Todoroki, trying to startle him like he did the others, but Todoroki saw him before he could.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Todoroki spoke before Midoriya could, while staring him down, and Midoriya met his gaze head on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, you should try to be better than your sad excuse for a father.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened and surprise colored his face. \u201cMaybe start with a hello next time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello. What do you want?\u201d Todoroki amended.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just wanted to talk. You seem like you have a lot of baggage, and I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019m a great therapist.\u201d No I haven\u2019t, but sometimes lies are for the greater good. \u201cSo, tell me all the incriminating evidence against Endeavor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Todoroki asked. \u201cAm I going to be a project for you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSlow down there. I\u2019m not using you. And I just don\u2019t want you to feel alone. Plus, I hate Endeavor.\u201d Midoriya held up his hands in a placating manner. \u201cSo, what have you got?\u201d Todoroki glared at Midoriya, the boy radiating distrust. Ugh, he\u2019s going to be annoying. However, although it took a bit more convincing, Midoriya finally got him to open up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEndeavor wants a perfect child to defeat All Might, so he\u2019s using me. I won\u2019t be his tool, which is why I refuse to use my fire. I won\u2019t give him the satisfaction of me using his power to become number one.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, so that\u2019s the issue.\u201d Midoriya mumbled. \u201cSee, here\u2019s the thing. While the flaming trash can is your father, it\u2019s not his power. Your power is fire and ice. You\u2019re the only person that can use your fire, unless there is a pyrokinetic, but that\u2019s another issue. Don\u2019t let him control you. You\u2019re your own person, with your own gifts. You can use them for yourself.\u201d Todoroki looked startled and Midoriya smiled. That\u2019s probably all I should say for now. \u201cHave a great day Todoroki Shoto.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya turned around and disappeared into the depths of the classroom. He scanned the room for Nezu, and walked over to talk to the rat(?).\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was the most awkward thing anyone has ever asked me to do. And I\u2019m pretty positive Yaoyorozu thought I was flirting with her, but I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Sensing that he was going to go on a tangent, Midoriya put his head in his hands and groaned. \u201cLike, I\u2019m fine with just analyzing them on the sidelines, but talking to them was just \u2018ugh\u2019. Thankfully I only had to talk to three of them. The others looked to be mentally sound, but I could be wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNezu looked on in amusement. \u201cWell, at least it was good practice. You never know when you\u2019re going to have to do stuff like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be an underground hero.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly my point! Underground heroes talk to people more often than you\u2019d think. Usually vigilantes though.\u201d Nezu looked around and saw the students looked more confused than they did before, although their eyes still had determination for the exam. \u201cI suppose that could have gone much better. You definitely need to work on your tact. Eh, maybe I\u2019ll just give you lessons with Present Mic. In any case, the exam will be starting soon so we should get to the commentator\u2019s booth.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya nodded, and so they both walked out of the room. Midoriya already knew where they were going, courtesy of Shinso, but it was still nice to have a guide. As they walked Midoriya allowed his thoughts to wander.\n\u00a0\n\nNezu was certainly right about my lack of tact. I should have had some more introduction and then slowly went into their issues. Plus. I doubt they even listened to me. I mean, I\u2019m just some random student that went up to them and told them to fix themselves. Well, they needed to hear it so hopefully it won\u2019t backfire too badly!\n\n\u00a0\nAs the greenette sat down he looked out of the glass and saw the examenes start getting ready. They all looked very concentrated, and ready to go. Well, most of them. Midoriya looked at Inasa and saw that he was conflicted. Oh God, I hope that what I said isn\u2019t gonna affect how he does! Then, the boy walked over towards Todoroki. Midoriya couldn\u2019t see what they were talking about, but he did see Todoroki look very surprised and then shake hands. Inasa then went back to his place in the line looking a lot calmer. Oh thank goodness. Not quite sure what happened, but I\u2019ll count it as a win in my book!\n\u00a0\nAs soon as Present Mic saw that all of the recommendation students were ready (sans one; Midoriya, but he\u2019s an unofficial recommendation student) he started to detail how the event would go.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMight as well analyze their quirks while you\u2019re here!\u201d Nezu reminded him from his seat beside Midoriya\u2019s. Midoriya nodded, as if I wasn\u2019t already planning on doing that, and flipped open his notebook. As the event went on Midoriya couldn\u2019t help himself from filling two entire notebooks with notes. Their quirks are so cool!! The teachers around him had all subconsciously moved to the edges of the room, his mutter-fest scaring them off, but Nezu still sat and listened to every word as he speed wrote.\n\u00a0\nThe recommendation exam passed in a blur, at least for Midoriya. Soon the only people left in the school were a still rambling Midoriya and a somewhat fed up Nezu.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShinso was amazing, as always, but did you see what Todoroki did with his ice in that last part?! BOOM!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, I know, I was there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know but it was so COOL!!! LITERALLY! Hahaha\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYes it was very cool.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Yaoyorozu was so smart! She made a cannon! How does one memorize the atomic structure of a cannon?! She\u2019s definitely getting in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMhm. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway, Inasa was pretty cool, now that he got past his whole Endeavor and his relatives should burn in hell thing. He\u2019s got great control over his wind. I think I\u2019ve got about six pages on him alone! That\u2019s almost a new record. Actually, not really close to a new record, but still impressive.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShow me them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShow you what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe notebook. It\u2019s your job to tell me what you analyzed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOops. I forgot. Here you go.\u201d Midoriya shoved the two notebooks towards him and smiled. \u201cSorry about going on the tangent. I got excited.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could see that.\u201d Nezu responded while he grabbed the notebooks. \u201cThank you. Aizawa will bring you back home, so don\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Thank you Nezu. Wait, Dadzawa?!\u201d Midoriya turned to see Eraserhead glaring at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be suspicious. Don\u2019t act like Apparition. Don\u2019t sass. Do not sass. Do not aggravate Dadzawa. Don\u2019t point any clues towards me being Apparition.\n\n\u00a0\nMidoriya and Aizawa walked to Eraserhead\u2019s car, Midoriya panicking in the back and Aizawa ignoring him in the front. Midoriya repeated his inner chant as he opened the back door. He watched with fearful eyes as Aizawa opened up the front door and they both slid into their seats. Silently, Aizawa started the car and pulled into the street. I never thought that being alone with Aizawa would be this awkward. Oh, who am I kidding, of course it was going to be.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Aizawa broke the silence with the statement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeh? For what?\u201d Midoriya answered. What does he mean? We haven\u2019t even talked, I can\u2019t have given it away. Ohgodwhatifheknowshowdoeshe-\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor being friends with Hitoshi.\u201d Ahhhh, I\u2019m in the clear. \u201cThanks to you they felt comfortable enough to come out to me and my husband.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow that sentence was gay- I mean, I\u2019m glad I helped.\u201d What did I say?! Do not act sarcastic or sassy. God social anxiety, why leave me now. You work fucking fine around everyone else! It\u2019s just my luck that you skidaddle when it\u2019s Dadzawa! OF ALL FUCKING PEOPLE?! \u201cWhere is Shinso though?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHizashi is taking him- sorry, them, out for ice cream.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe car devolved into silence once again. And again, Eraserhead broke it. \u201cSo, why were you at the exam? Are you a recommendation student as well as Nezu\u2019s personal student?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, no. I was there to do a job for Nezu. I would probably fail that exam if I took it. I\u2019m more of a computer person, an informant, sorry, analysis, type. I inform people of my analysis. Which is why I was at the exam. I was informing Nezu of my thoughts after I analyzed the student\u2019s mental states...\u201d Where the fuck is my brain to mouth filter?! I mean HELLO?! Honestly I feel like I just outed myself. Or made myself look like the biggest idiot alive. Probably both. God that was a train wreck. \n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, okay. Is this your apartment complex?\u201d Midoriya looked out the window and relief flooded him at the sight of his home.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Thanks for the ride! Bye!\u201d Midoriya didn\u2019t let Aizawa reply as he leapt out of the car and raced towards his apartment. Once inside, he slid down the door and onto the floor. That- was the biggest disaster- ever. What the fuck. Do I need to practice with a photo of him or something cause clearly there\u2019s some work to be done. I mean logically I guess it\u2019s because I know him so well that I feel comfortable around him but still, what was that?!\n\u00a0\nMidoriya sighed and flopped from the doorway and into his room. Okay, I had almost finished a case before Fatgum picked me up, so I should probably start on that. Midoriya reached behind his bookcase and pulled out the file. It wasn\u2019t as big as most other cases, Endeavor\u2019s was around 50 pages, but it had enough evidence to get the criminal in jail. The villain was named Lioness, and, as the name suggested, can turn into a lion. Wow, people\u2019s names are so unoriginal these days. But I guess there most have been taken already, so that makes sense.\n\u00a0\nHe spilled all of the information onto he desk and started to sift through it. \u201cOkay, I left off at camera #21 so let\u2019s start at camera #22. And let\u2019s go to camera footage from a while ago. Hopefully I can find her base quickly.\u201d Sadly, that didn\u2019t work out too well. Camera after camera, Lioness kept walking. \u201cIs she nocturnal? She\u2019s been walking for 8 hours!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: yall villains hate me\nDadzawa: What have you done this time?\nApparition: im trying to catch a baddie but she wont stop walking\nTsalty: I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand\nApparition: nvmApparition: nobody understands my pain\nDadzawa: You sound like a whiny teenager. So\u2026 basically like all of my students. Are you 15?\nApparition: u think a teenager could be this goodApparition: shame on u\nDadzawa: You\u2019re right. My students could never be this good. What was I thinking?Dadzawa: You must just have the maturity of a 15 year old.\nApparition: oof r00dApparition: anyway gtg baddie to catch\nApparition is now offline____\n15 cameras later and Lioness finally stopped. \u201cOh my god, finally! I thought I\u2019d have to pull an allnighter again. Contrary to popular belief, I do actually sleep at least an hour a day.\u201d Midoriya murmured to himself. Lioness slunk into a populated apartment and walked up the stairs. Boi-, that\u2019s a well known villain, how does no one recognize her? Midoriya hurriedly tried to switch to a camera inside the apartment complex, but he didn\u2019t have any backdoors created. Welp, there goes my potential sleep.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya stretched his arms and back, feeling and hearing about ten joints pop and crackle, and turned to face his computer. He typed quickly, and hacked into the camera faster than ever before; a new record of 5 minutes. Huh, I guess doing something around 500 times really makes a person get good at it. Oh, and Nezu teaching me. That helped too. \n\u00a0\nFollowing her inside, he watched as she placed her key card into the elevator slot and headed down to an unregistered floor. Bingo. There were no cameras below so Izuku decided to send what he had to the pros and have them take care of it. It was definitely something. Speed watching through the rest of the couple days until the cameras were live (it only took a few hours) he could see a large group of well known villains entering and leaving the apartment. How the hell did no one find this shit yet. Like what??? Anyways, time to contact the pros.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\n\nApparition has sent a location\n\nApparition: a hideout for a group of villains containing lioness, creatyn, and dragari\nTsalty: A group? What do you mean?\nApparition: i mean what i saidApparition: there have been some low level villains entering and exiting the same apartment and these three over the past three daysApparition: kinda stupid but makes my life easier\nDadzawa: Thanks for the info Dadzawa: I\u2019ll get right on it; I\u2019m in the area\nTsalty: I\u2019ll send some people to join you\nDadzawa: Thanks\n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\nApparition: it feels good to have 17 hours of work appreciated\n\nDadzawa is now online\n\nDadzawa: 17?!\n\nApparition is now offline\n\nMidoriya woke up the next day with much more energy than he usually had after that amount of sleep. Or, rather, the ability to pretend that he had more energy than usual. I guess my physical training has helped in more ways than one. Being able to continue doing stuff while being dead on my feet is a good skill to have! Midoriya winced. That sentence sounded better before it was completed.\n\u00a0\nAlthough he was usually doing stuff with Nezu, Midoriya was in fact doing physical training. He was learning some fighting styles and weapons with Midnight. The reason for this being she also doesn\u2019t really like to resort to violence, liking to use her quirk before things get that bad. But, no matter if Midoriya didn\u2019t really enjoy violence, he still needed to be able to defend himself and others, so he had learned to use a lot of different tools such as grappling hooks, smoke and capture bombs, and even a large bat (his choice). Also how to walk and fight in heels because ya know\u2026 why not? I mean it\u2019s like having knives on your feet!! So again, why not?! To go along with that, he had parkour lessons with Aizawa twice a week. Mostly because the pro hero didn\u2019t have a class. However, those were the classes he most feared. After the terrible car incident, as he had become prone to calling it, Midoriya did not like interacting with Aizawa unless it was through text or in a large group.\n\u00a0\nBeing the quick learned Midoriya was, he had made more strides in these things than most people did in a year. I also gained some good muscle mass, so it\u2019s a win-win! Not that anyone really noticed the change. I wish they did, and then maybe left me alone. I mean I could always, ya know, FIGHT BACK, but that would end poorly for me. They\u2019d probably suspend me for bullying, honestly, haha...ha\u2026 yikes. Plus, doing that could ruin Nezu\u2019s master plan. Wouldn\u2019t want that to happen. God it\u2019s still such a weird concept. I mean, someone doing something productive against the bullies? Who\u2019s she? I mean I know it\u2019s probably just an excuse to gain revenge on humanity and all that but...still.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya broke out from his thoughts and left his room. As per normal, he opened the fridge and saw that nothing was in it. What am I supposed to do now? We\u2019re almost out of cereal and I don\u2019t have any money! Plus, mom isn\u2019t going to do anything, she eats out most days. And she has a food court for most meals at work. Oof, I\u2019m starting to think I should tell nezu I need to eat lunch there. Maybe Lunchrush would make me something? Probably not, why would he haha\u2026 double yikes. Midoriya yanked himself out of the self-deprecating thoughts and started to make himself breakfast. He poured some cereal into a cracked bowl, but couldn\u2019t add milk because there was none. \n\u00a0\nSighing, he poured some tap water into his bowl and ate the mediocre breakfast. Usually this would be when his mom would quickly look into the room, see him, and then leave. Oddly enough, the house was silent. Maybe she left early? Then he got an idea. God I really shouldn\u2019t do that brain. No. No way\u2026 Fine. Sneaking into his mom\u2019s room and seeing no one there he quickly opened her dresser drawer and stole $50. If she\u2019s not going to consciously feed me then she\u2019ll have to not know. \n\u00a0\nSlipping out of the house he headed to school, content that he would be able to eat for the next week or so. I mean, she can eat the food I buy too, so it\u2019s not stealing or anything.\n____\nWhen he arrived home there was a cop car out front of his house. Oh no\u2026 As he slipped in, hugging the groceries to his chest, he was met with the sight of his mother talking to a cop. She looked to be in hysterics and was sobbing about something. Making his way into the kitchen to put his groceries in the fridge he heard his mother scream his name out. \n\u00a0\n\u201cIZUKU, I KNEW IT WAS YOU! Ungrateful brat! Stealing my money and eating all our food! I have to work THREE JOBS TO PAY FOR YOU AND YOU GO TAKING MY MONEY?!\u201d He looked at her in confusion and fear as she slumped into the couch crying. What the heck. This is the first time she talks to me for a month and it\u2019s to yell at me? It was only 50 dollars! It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re not feeding me! The cop looked back up at him, at the groceries, and down at her before swiftly standing and moving toward him. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, HEY! What are you doing?\u201d Was all he could make out as he was pinned and handcuffed. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d Izuku was stunned as he was dragged out of his house and shoved into the police car. He could see his mom sobbing from the doorway, her disgusted, angry eyes looked smug through her tears. He silently turned to face the front as he was driven to the Masutafu police station.\n____\nLet it be said, that sitting in a holding call with 17 villains you just got arrested is NOT. FUN. Midoriya looked around at the faces of many of the small-time villains he had seen in Lioness\u2019s apartment complex. I\u2019m so fucking lucky they don\u2019t know it was me who put them here, and that they\u2019re wearing quirk suppressing cuffs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s an innocent looking runt like you doing here?\u201d One of the villains, Viper I think? Wow real fucking original man, spoke up and Midoriya flinched away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI, um, bo-borrowed some of m-my mom\u2019s mone-money to b-buy grocer-ries cause she ha-hasn\u2019t fed me in a w-while an-and she called the cops.\u201d Midoriya stuttered quietly, not looking at any of the people near him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that really illegal?\u201d Midoriya could hear the confusion in his voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike you would know. But damn. And they call us villains. At least we don\u2019t let children starve.\u201d Another villain spoke up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, te-technically you c-could c-cause that. Yo-you ste-steal money which hu-hurts people and can cau-cause people to n-not be able to feed their children.\u201d Silence coated the cell and Midoriya curled in on himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMan. You have guts for a whimpy teenager HAHA. Yeah that\u2019s fair I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya Izuku?\u201d He heard a cop say from the other side of the bars. He hadn\u2019t even heard the cop walk up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yes? Sir?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t have anyone listed as a contact and your mother isn't paying bail, is there any other contact you\u2019d like to give us before we give you a trial?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, yes, sir.\u201d Midoriya answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell who\u2019s your contact?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNezu, sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...what??\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou heard me. Nezu. Principle of UA. sir.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sure, okay, give me a sec.\u201d The officer walked off with a \u2018yeah right, please\u2019 look on his face. He looked around at the silent cell.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf all the fake contacts. That\u2019s a new one.\u201d A villain laughed and Midoriya didn\u2019t reply. \u201cWait, are you serious?\u201d This time, Midoriya nodded. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was only twenty minutes before the officer returned with a murderous Nezu in tow. The villains around him shivered at the pure rage he was giving off. \n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, I would like your side of the story. Now.\u201d While the others were terrified of the rat(?) Izuku was used to his company and instantly felt his anxiety melting away, replaced by his usual sass. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you see sir my mother decided that instead of just hating me for not having a quirk she needs to pretend I don\u2019t exist and not buy food...ever. So I, like a rational, responsible person, bought myself food with her money, ya know, the thing it\u2019s supposed to be being used for. I mean as a single mother I\u2019m sure you could sue her for insurance fraud at this point, with the fact that she hasn\u2019t even talked to me or fed me in around a month. Anyway, back to the story, she decides that me using her money to buy food is reasonable grounds for having me arrested for robbery. Not only that but I was never questioned! The cop that arrested me, Mineta Ito, Just saw my mom crying and fucking pinned and cuffed me!\u201d \n\u00a0\nBy the end of his story the villains were either enraged or impressed, Nezu looked like he was going to murder every citizen in Japan, and the cop looked mortified.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure I can fix this little misunderstanding and get your mother in jail.\u201d Nezu turned to the cop and began to talk, but Midoriya couldn\u2019t hear it over the rioting of his jail buddies / villains he captured.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! Put that bitch in jail!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWooo, protect the green bean!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the midst of the chaos another detainee crept up to Midoriya. \u201cIgnore them. They\u2019ve had nothing to do for a day, they\u2019re using you to have something to care about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m j-just hap-happy to have some-someone care about me.\u201d Midoriya smiled sadly and looked at Nezu. The poor cop next to him looked traumatized and quickly sprinted away at Nezu\u2019s command. \n\u00a0\nNezu turned back to a teared up Midoriya and spoke. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out of here. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nA little while later, Midoriya was moved into a interrogation room along with his mother, Nezu, and Dad #2. In the interrogation room, Midoriya Inko looked everywhere except where her son was sitting. She usually alternated from glaring at Nezu or she just stared at Tsukauchi. Wow, this is a lot more awkward than the other cell. Unsurprisingly, at least to Nezu, he had made friends with most of his cellmates at that point.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I would personally like to apologize.\u201d Nezu spoke up and Izuku looked at him, surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the time to ruin Aldera Middle School yet, and have only been able to threaten them for the time being. Not only that, but I let my personal student be neglected in his home. Which is why we are here today, to fix that issue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nInko looked enraged at Nezu\u2019s speech. \u201cI am not neglecting my son! I have no idea why this has become so blown out of proportion! All I wanted was some retribution for Izuku stealing my money.\u201d Inko stared down the rat and the police officer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat issue has already been resolved Ms. Midoriya. Nezu has paid bail.\u201d Tsukauchi spoke for the first time. If you didn\u2019t know him you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell, but the detective was also fuming. \n\u00a0\nIn the background Izuku could be heard mumbling \u2018you di-didn\u2019t h-h-have to do that Nezu.\u2019 Hearing this, the rat(?) walked over to comfort his student and Dad #2 continued to speak. \u201cWe are here to discuss the concerning things that Mr. Midoriya has said about you, which there is evidence to support. Also, I have a quirk that tells if someone is lying, so please don\u2019t bother doing so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, y-you can ca-call me Izuku.\u201d All eyes, except for his mother, turn to him and he stumbled to add more to his sentence. \u201cIt-it would be l-less conf-confusing.\u201d For once, I am so happy to be in a stressful and anxiety inducing situation. Well, not really, but at least I won\u2019t sound like Apparition! Oh my god my mother is getting interrogated and this is what I\u2019m thinking of? \n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Cold crept into Inko\u2019s voice and Izuku knew the detective was finally getting to her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am saying, ma\u2019am, that you are being investigated for child abuse and child negelect. What do you have to say on those accusations?\u201d Dad #2 could obviously feel the tension in the air and met her gaze head on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have to say that they are complete bullshit. My son is a big part of my life, but, being a single mother, I\u2019m gone often and forget things. I\u2019m not perfect, but I have never raised a hand to my child.\u201d Midoriya retorted, and Izuku knew that all of it was accurate except the first sentence. She never once said that she forgot to get groceries, which would get her caught, and she has never hit me. She got around everything.\n\u00a0\nThankfully, Tsukauchi noticed the possible lie as well, even if his quirk didn\u2019t. \u201cSo, are you saying that forgetting to buy food for your son is a common occurrence?\u201d Dad #2 always looking out for me, even if he doesn\u2019t know it. That thought put a warm feeling inside the \u2018vigilante\u2019s\u2019 chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that. Please don\u2019t put words in my mouth.\u201d For being such an open person, Midoriya Inko was very skilled at misdirection.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a question and I need you to answer with a simple yes or no. Do you ever intentionally let Midoriya Izuku go hungry?\u201d Tsukauchi\u2019s eyes narrowed as Inko hesitated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019s still trying to get away with it. Midoriya turned towards Dad #2 and tried to plead with his eyes. She\u2019s lying, please, please believe me. I know you\u2019re a good person, please don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthless. Please care, I need this. For once, don\u2019t let her get away with it.\n\u00a0\nTsukauchi doesn\u2019t return Izuku\u2019s gaze, but he seems to hear the boy\u2019s plea. \u201cLie. I told you, don\u2019t bother lying. I\u2019ll know. Now, let me ask it again, are you neglecting your son, Midoriya Izuku.\u201d He\u2019s still trying. He cares. Tears began to streak down Izuku\u2019s face. Things are finally starting to change, all thanks to Nezu.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! Having a quirkless son is terrible for me. All of my friends separated from me. The pity glances I get at work, I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d Inko tried to plead her case, but both Nezu and Tsukauchi didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cI wasn\u2019t about to pay hard earned money to feed someone who destroyed my life!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, please shut up. You\u2019ve said enough.\u201d Finally, Tsukauchi turned to face the younger Midoriya. \u201cNow, Izuku, have you ever purposely done anything to hurt your mother.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d Midoriya quietly whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we need anything more today. Do you agree, detective?\u201d Tsukauchi gave an affirmative and Nezu continued. \u201cIn that case, it would please me if you could escort Midoriya to her cell. I\u2019d like to speak with Izuku alone if at all possible. Thank you for coming, Tsukauchi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d Tsukauchi grabbed Midoriya Inko, cuffed her hands, and began dragging her out of the room. \u201cPlease ma\u2019am, don\u2019t make this harder than it has to be. You are under arrest for child abuse and making me drag you won\u2019t change that.\u201d With that, they exit the room, but not before Inko gave one last hateful glare to her son.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid that just happen? Did Tsalty actually do that? Is she gone? Is she finally gone?\u201d Midoriya continued to silently cry, overwhelmed by what had just occurred.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re free Izuku. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it sooner.\u201d Nezu walked over and put a comforting paw(?) on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya fell out of his chair and hugged the small animal.\u201cThank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNezu returned the hug and murmured, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s okay now. Nothing bad is going to happen to you again.\u201d Nezu slid out of the hug and turned serious. \u201cHowever, we do have to discuss what to do about housing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I forgot about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust so you know, Aizawa would probably be happy to adopt you,\u201d Oh please no. That would be a dead give away and I don\u2019t know how I would get anything done \u201cbut I believe that would not be the best option. Another option is living at UA, and becoming my ward.\u201d Um, yes please. That would be amazing. Or is it too good to be true. Is this a trick? No, Nezu wouldn\u2019t do that to me. I trust him. I-...I TRUST HIM! Oh my god! \u201cHowever, that will only be available when you are accepted into UA, so in only a few months.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, I-i can go in-into foster c-care.\u201d Midoriya interrupted Nezu. \u201cI-it would be the b-best option. Th-that way n-no one has to go out of the-their way for a wh-while. It\u2019s fi-fine with me. Plus, in-infiltrating the sys-system cou-could help me f-find some good villains.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNezu laughed at the last part, surprising Midoriya. \u201cI suppose you are correct. Well, if that is what you want, then I\u2019ll get that taken care of.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you Nezu, for everything.\u201d Midoriya muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnything for my favorite student. Plus, I couldn\u2019t possibly give you an excuse not to finish the homework I assigned. And you have to get two villains today correct? Well, technically one villain. You did just put one in jail.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nI mean it Nezu. Thank you for everything. Thank you for believing in me, even though I\u2019m quirkless. Thank you for not turning me in. Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\nAs Midoriya and Nezu walked out of the police station, another thought occured to the boy. It\u2019s strange. It doesn\u2019t feel weird to me that my mother\u2019s gone. Huh. Maybe I took calling all the adults in my life \u201cDad\u201d a little too seriously. Worth it.\nThe next couple weeks were a messy blur. Between his mother\u2019s case, foster papers, finding a new school (because there is no way I\u2019m going back and the school is shutting down soon anyway) and his vigilante work, Izuku was running around like a headless chicken. Having no processing time certainly didn\u2019t help his mental state either. By his third early-morning breakdown he had had enough and finally decided to step back. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay maybe I should try meditation? Hypnosis? I dunno something relaxing. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Nezu.\u201d Oh yeah, there\u2019s that, I\u2019m fucking LIVING WITH NEZU?! I mean who knew that when your mom was finally in the process of being arrested for years of obvious trauma and neglect and the people putting her in jail are your father figure and teacher would cause you to move in with someone who actually cares about you...haha who kneeeeew\u2026? I mean to be fair it\u2019s only until I get a foster home but still. And then there\u2019s the fact that Aldera is being slowly but surely torn apart. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI guess I\u2019m just not used to anyone trying to even pretend to care or help. I mean it\u2019s the whole reason I went vigilante in the first place! The fact that Tsukauchi is actually trying to help someone like me makes me wonder if it would be okay to reveal myself. I mean, I want to thank him so badly but I\u2019m...scared. What if this is all an act like those bitch-boys at Aldera who used to pretend to be my friends and then ditch me, or maybe it\u2019s \u2018cause he and Dadzawa are on to me and want me to confess, or maybe he\u2019s doing it\u2019s for his reputation, or maybe he wants me to owe him so that he gets all the credit for my work in the future, or MAYBE-\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku was interrupted from his spiraling panic by a knock on his door. \u201cHey Izuku? I\u2019m making tea, would you like some?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure dad- I mean Nezu. Shit. DIDN\u2019T MEAN THAT!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Okay then. I\u2019m just going to go make tea.\u201d Midoriya crab-crawled off of his bed head first and out of his room and down the hall. He quickly entered the kitchen and Nezu whipped around. At this angle, the rat was only a tiny bit taller than his ward.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, Midoriya?\u201d Nezu asked, a concerned look on his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cScuttle scuttle bitch.\u201d Midoriya flipped upwards and walked to grab the kettle that had just started to whistle. \u201cHere let me help you with that.\u201d He shuffled over and poured the boiling water into the china cups. Taking a seat on Nezu\u2019s, normal sized, tiny couch, I\u2019m short okay I get it shut up, he began to pleasantly chat with Nezu. They were interrupted by the rat(?)\u2019s phone ringing. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAh hello Tsukauchi,\u201d Nezu greeted. \u201cGood of you to call! I have another case for you,\u201d Midoriya could almost feel the groan that came from the detective, even if he couldn\u2019t actually hear it. \u201cYes, that does mean more paperwork. But, don\u2019t worry, it will be right up your alley. We shall be taking down a quirk discriminatory school,\u201d Midoriya almost choked on his tea, and looked towards the rat. Man I forgot about that. I honestly still can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s actually doing something about it. Nezu, although hearing Midoriya\u2019s intake of breath, continued on as if nothing was happening. \u201cIt is called Aldera Middle School,\u201d A pause. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to have to go on a wild goose chase for evidence. That was only one time Tsukauchi, let it go. In any case, I already have all the evidence you\u2019ll need. Keep a look out!\u201d Nezu cheered into the phone, and then hung up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting Dad #2 involved in this? Again?? Won\u2019t it seem suspicious?\u201d Nezu turned to face him and sipped his tea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best detectives I know. I\u2019ve asked him to do a lot for me before, so he won\u2019t connect the dots.\u201d Then a scary grin crossed the rodent(?)\u2019s face. \u201cWait, Dad #2? Does that make me Dad #3?\u201d Midoriya promptly spit out his tea. Nezu\u2019s grin widened.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, I think you\u2019d be #4 actually, Fatgum claimed that role when you weren\u2019t listening. It was during the recommendation exam.\u201d Why do I have so many dads? All I wanted was a supporting family, now I have an attack squad!\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I took you in as a student first, he can\u2019t call dibs if he was after me.\u201d Are we seriously arguing about this?\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut, he brought Aldera to your attention and stood up for me. Oh, now that I think about it, you might be #5, Present Mic is married to Dadzawa after all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI put your mother in jail.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTechnically that was Dad #2.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI took you on as a student and you are currently living in my home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou got me there. Fine, you\u2019ll be Dad #4, because Dadzawa, Tsalty, and Past Mic have to be before you, but Fatgum will be placed after you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is Pre- wait why are you called Present Mic Past Mic?\u201d Midoriya snickered and didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out. Anyway, why is he before me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe beauty of marriage.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t even done anything for you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDadzawa has done enough for both of them and they\u2019re taking care of Shinso. Anyway, thanks for the tea.\u201d With that, Midoriya skipped out of the room and headed to his computer. Time to do vigilante work.\n____\nMidoriya cracked his back and looked to see what the time was. The bright alarm clock flashed 3:21 and Midoriya flopped onto his bed. Why does it always take so much time to do vigilante work. Ugh, I\u2019m thirsty, Ima go get a drink of water. Okayyyy, geeet up. Let\u2019s go.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya rolled out of the bed and hit the floor as softly as one can when falling off of a bed. Then he shuffled to the door and exited his room. While doing this, a crash sounded from the living room. What the fuck? Is Nezu still awake?\n\u00a0\nRolling his blanket around himself into a cocoon he tossed himself onto the railing and flew down the stairs before flying three feet into an armchair. Wow, I would never have been able to do that before I started training at UA. He opened his eyes to see a man (is that Groot) standing in his living room. \n\u00a0\n\u201cI am Tree Boy! With my nature powers you CANNOT STOP ME! Don\u2019t try to resist.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, for one, if you\u2019re going to break into my house don\u2019t be crashing and yelling, I was about to go to sleep, and also, you have NATURE POWERS?! And you named yourself fucking TREE BOY?!\u201d The groot wannabe stopped what he was doing and stared at Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t insult my name. And don\u2019t try to stop me from stealing your stuff. If you do, you\u2019ll DIE!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn, I came down to get water, not death.\u201d Again, the robber stopped what he was doing in surprise. Using this to his advantage, Midoriya rolled off the chair and ducked behind it. From there, it was a straight shot to the kitchen, which he could do without the Tree Boy ever seeing him.\n\u00a0\nOnce he arrived in the kitchen, Nezu\u2019s ward stopped at the sink and began to fill up a glass with water. I wonder if I should do anything about Shrub Youngster. Nah, Nezu probably has it covered. The glass was finally full and Midoriya turned off the water. Sighing, it is way too late for this, Midoriya walked back towards the living room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAha! You cannot defeat me with water, in fact, it only makes me stronger!!\u201d Izuku stood there staring at the guy as he shifted uncomfortably before taking a long and very loud sip and sitting back on the banister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBitch, don\u2019t take my water. It\u2019s not for you.\u201d Sleep deprevation really makes you say stupid things. He quickly rolled up the banister and made his way to Nezu\u2019s room. Not even trying to be quiet at this point, Midoriya burst open Nezu\u2019s door and walked in. Nezu was found sitting at his desk watching the live living room footage.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, hello Midoriya. How are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTired. So, you already know about Sapling Son?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe police are coming?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. Goodnight.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep well.\u201d God, the shit I go through.\nThe next day Midoriya woke up very well rested. Hold up, did Tree Boy actually happen! Nah, that was a dream. Midoriya shook his head, and walked downstairs, still in his pajamas. Then he took in the scene that was the living room. Okay, maybe not a dream. Huh.\n\u00a0\nIgnoring the mess that was the living room, the hacker sat down and pulled out his phone.\n\u00a0\n\nChat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: wow im at 94,107 arrests\nApparition: r u guys proud\nTsalty: You know what would make us more proud...?\nDadzawa: Yes. You should quit while you\u2019re ahead.\nApparition: \u2026 hounding me for my identity again i see\nApparition: cant believe u\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnnamed Chat\n\nMidoriya Izuku: hey shinso!!\nShinso Hitoshi: Hey Midoriya. What\u2019s up?\nMidoriya Izuku: well my mom got arrested\nMidoriya Izuku: so now im living with nezu\nMidoriya Izuku: and the living rooms a mess because someone broke in last nite\nMidoriya Izuku: and im not sure whats gonna be happening with my schooling and all\nMidoriya Izuku: cause nezus trying to take them down for quirk discrimination\nMidoriya Izuku: but im good. U?\nShinso Hitoshi: I\u2019-I\u2019m good.\nShinso Hitoshi: Wait, you\u2019re living with Nezu???!!!\nMidoriya Izuku: ye its a blast\nShinso Hitoshi: Well then.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya looked up to see Nezu padding down the stairs. The rat(?) smiled once he saw Izuku in the living room, and sat down across from him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep well?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, actually!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood. So, we need to figure out what you\u2019re going to be doing now that Aldera is going down and your mother is in jail.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya sighed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. I...thanks for letting me stay with you for now. But for schooling\u2026\u201d he shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I am already technically fostering you. And if you would feel more comfortable we can always find an online school for the next three-ish months until UA?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you\u2026 serious?\u201d Izuku looked like he was about to cry. \u201cYou\u2019d actually invite me into your home for the next three months?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve already claimed my title as Dad #4 after all, and you deserve to be cared for. I\u2019d be happy to be your guardian for now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo the shock of both of them tears actually did start to fall from Izuku\u2019s eyes. Suddenly, all of the pent up emotion from the past weeks flooded the gates and burst out. \u201cW-why? Why are you being so nice? Why are you saving me again and again? Why are you wasting your time on me? Why do you care?! I- I don\u2019t get it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re a hero. You are the definition of a true hero. You save people anonymously because you care even though you don\u2019t get anything in return. When others need you, even the students of UA who were crying in closets, you step in and save them. Everyone deserves to have that. You\u2019re a great kid Izuku.\u201d Nezu placed his paw on Midoriya\u2019s head as the tears streamed down his face and ruffled his poofy hair. \u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes! Yes that sounds like a dream come true da-Nezu.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, just call me Dad #4 at this point, we all want it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-okay. I won\u2019t lie to you, I still don\u2019t understand why so many people suddenly want to help, but, thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure. Now, I\u2019ve already gotten links to five online school options. I\u2019ll email them to you and you can pick which ones you prefer. However, even with this new learning environment, your personal classes with me will not stop.\u201d Nezu smiled and Midoriya remembered why people are so scared of him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course. I understa-\u201d A knock interrupted Midoriya. Both the rat(?) and the human blinked and looked at each other. \u201cAre you expecting anyone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo. You?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot that I know of. I\u2019ll go see who it is.\u201d Midoriya silently meandered to the front door and opened it. \u201cShinso?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSup. Can I come in?\u201d The purple haired friend stood outside and Midoriya widened the gap to let them inside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Shinso took off their shoes and closed the door behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI asked Aizawa where Nezu lived. He looked at me like I was insane, but told me. So, now I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut why are you here?\u201d Midoriya led Shinso to the living room that was now empty, but still a mess.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour mom just got arrested and now you\u2019re living with Nezu. I came to see how my best friend was doing!\u201d Shinso had a concerned look in their eyes, but Midoriya lost sight of it when they turned around. \u201cAlso, what happened here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Tree Boy, or something stupid about a shrub and a kid, trashed it when trying to steal stuff. He got arrested real quick and I got a glass of water.\u201d Midoriya plopped on the couch and patted the spot next to him. Shinso tried to navigate the chaos without stepping on anything, and overall he succeeded. The purplette then sat next to their friend and asked their question again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot exactly sure what water has to do with that, but again, not what I came here for. How are you Izuku?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Midoriya remembers Tsukauchi dragging his mom away, Nezu taking him in, Fatgum bringing up Aldera to Nezu, Aizawa driving him home and answers, \u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell good, because I brought Uno. I thought that that would be a great way to ruin our friendship.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s that? I\u2019ve never played.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso looked at him like he\u2019d killed their cat in front of them. \u201c...Are you shitting in my soup right now? There\u2019s no way you\u2019ve never played UNO!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell to be fair I haven\u2019t had friends or parents in my life since I was four\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Oof, that\u2019s rough buddy...anyway, UNO TIME!\u201d A deck of cards appeared from out of nowhere in Shinso\u2019s hand. They started to shuffle them and Midoriya looked on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds fun, but I still don\u2019t know how to play.\u201d Shinso paused and turned to face Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, so basically you can put down either a card of the same number or the same color. There are special cards but those are pretty self explanatory. The goal is to get rid of all of your cards. If you can\u2019t put down a card then you take from the deck until you get one you can use. Makes sense?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s easy enough, shouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d Shinso grinned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think now, but just wait.\u201d Midoriya became concerned and Shinso went back to shuffling.\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Midoriya threw his cards down on the draw pile as Shinso won for the fourth time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLanguage.\u201d His friend deadpanned and Midoriya glared at them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the fourth time you have won and during it you made me draw 26 cards. I think I can curse this once.\u201d Midoriya flopped onto the ground and groaned. Shinso smirked and began to shuffle the cards again. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAt least it hasn\u2019t lasted an hour yet.\u201d Midoriya stared at Shinso and then laid back down with a loud thump. While all of this was going on Nezu meandered in the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, Uno. Such a fun game. Mind if I join?\u201d Nezu asked. Both Shinso and Midoriya freezed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. No way. I\u2019m not letting a strategic mastermind play Uno with me. My ego can only take so much.\u201d Midoriya stated from the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll make tea then. Would you like some Shinso?\u201d Shinso nodded and continued to shuffle. Nezu left the room and Shinso spoke up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMido, you just talked back to a literal god of chaos. How did you do that?\u201d Shinso asked, really wanting to know.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSpite and sleep deprivation. It also helped that Nezu wants to be called Dad #4, so he\u2019s not that scary anymore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad #4?\u201d Shinso started to deal the cards while they watched Izuku with confusion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s Dad #1, also known as Dadzawa. Dad #2 is Tsukauchi, or Tsalty. Dad #3 is Past Mic through Dadzawa. Dad #4 is Nezu, and Dad #5 is Fatgum, Dadgum?, Dadgum. I\u2019ve got a lot of dads.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d The purple haired insomniac finished dealing the cards and motioned for Midoriya to pick them up. \u201cSince I won, I\u2019ll start.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you win again I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell now I don\u2019t know if I should intentionally sabotage myself or not.\u201d Shinso played their card and the game began.\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cI CALL BULLSHIT! IT CANNOT BE POSSIBLE TO WIN 7 TIMES IN A ROW!!!\u201d Midoriya screamed while Shinso laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa, I am the Uno GOD!\u201d Midoriya screamed like an enraged goose and launched himself at his friend. Shinso barely managed to avoid the small green ball and began to run. Midoriya followed, still screeching.\n\u00a0\nShinso, who had not seen Midoriya in many months, had not realized how fast the anxiety bean had gotten and was soon tackled to the ground. They then could not get back up, seeing that they were laughing too hard to breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, how...did you...even make that noise?\u201d Shinso questioned. \u201cActually, nevermind. The smaller you get...the higher your pitch!\u201d The middle schooler\u2019s laughter doubled at their own joke. Midoriya, on the other hand, was nonplussed.\n\u00a0\nShinso had no time before the smaller boy picked him up and threw them over his shoulder. It would have been more intimidating if the taller kid\u2019s fingers hadn\u2019t almost touched the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI invite you to my house-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your house and you didn\u2019t invite me,\u201d Shinso interrupted, not helping mollify Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBeating me at Uno every single round wasn\u2019t enough for you, huh?! You have to go and add insult to injury, don\u2019t ya!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a skill.\u201d Shinso giggled and Midoriya threw them to the ground near the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up. You\u2019re a terrible person.\u201d A pause. \u201cThanks for coming by Shinso.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnytime.\u201d\nIt was almost strange that high school was coming closer and closer. Because of this, Midoriya\u2019s training was kicked up a notch. Now that he was living with Nezu, the rat(?) would randomly ask him riddles throughout the day, as well as post sticky notes on what he had to hack into. Midoriya would be going about his day and then on the bathroom mirror there would be a sticky note that says \u201cMedical History of China Anne McClain\u201d and Midoriya would have to have to get that information by the end of the day. It was tiring to say the least. I mean how am I supposed to find the medical history of some random american Disney actress from like a hundred fucking years ago.\n\u00a0\nMidnight also started working him harder. Instead of just teaching him basic moves and weapons, they started to spar everyday. Sometimes with weapons, sometimes without. Still, Midnight was always full of praise, which made feeling like a truck ran you over a little more fulfilling. \n\u00a0\nAizawa, although he would never say it out loud, was also proud of Midoriya\u2019s improvement in parkour. They would now take longer routes, and more dangerous ones. Thankfully, Midoriya usually came out relatively unscathed from those workouts. Except for the time Eraserhead started sparring with him on the middle of a roof. Recovery Girl had to see him afterwards.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya was now pretty proficient in self-defense, parkour, metal bats (as a weapon), capture weapons, and tasers.\n\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t to say that he was slacking off on his work as Apparition. With Nezu\u2019s help he had brought in 67 criminals by the end of the week (a new record). Tsukauchi and Eraserhead were both appreciative and wary, although Tsukauchi was also annoyed at the amount of new paperwork. They were both hounding Midoriya at every turn for his identity.\n\u00a0\n\nChat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nDadzawa: You don\u2019t think that you could give us a hint?\nApparition: neh but i can give u something else to think about\nDadzawa: Not gonna lie, kind of scared, but also bored.Dadzawa: Give me something to think about\nApparition: so i got an idea and i just want to run this by uApparition: past mic and eraserdeadApparition: the ultimate ghost couple\nDadzawa: Why does your brain think of these things?Dadzawa: And also, literally no, never.Dadzawa: ...Do I need to fear for the lives of my husband and myself now?\nTsalty: Honestly, a good joke, but I would enjoy you telling us your identity more.\nApparition: 1, i gave you the number 100,000 for a reasonApparition: and 2, no, you don\u2019tApparition: i would never kill my parental figures\nDadzawa: Somehow, I am not comforted.\nApparition: come on its only like two months before i meet my quota anyway Apparition: oops gtg Dad #4 is summoning me\nDadzawa: How many people have you claimed are your dads?!\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cIzuku?\u201d He heard Nezu call again from downstairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah D4?\u201d He yelled down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSince we have some time now do you want to work the Endeavor case for a bit?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, HELL YEAH! One sec!\u201d Quickly grabbing his files and computer he ran down the steps and into the dining room. Nezu joined him soon after with his own computer and tea. Taking slow sipps they both opened their online files and websites that they had found. Okay so I need that one about the lawsuit, the folder of camera records and audio records, then the house fire articles, his son\u2019s official comment, oh and the livestream that guy did, and the email chain, okay I think that\u2019s it for online. \u201cOkay so we need to properly organise everything because my stuff is super messy right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay so we can section off the evidence into domestic abuse, child abuse and neglect, property damage, illegal bribery of court martials, and other.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d It took them twenty minutes of sorting and collecting files but they finally managed to gather everything into some attempt at order. In total they had over a hundred video files, 32 audio files, 14 articles, the records of 18 forgotten lawsuits, and five statements from the man\u2019s maids as well as his youngest son. Not to mention a string of emails and transactions that could, on its own, land the man in jail for years for different counts of bribery and threats. Sadly, they couldn\u2019t get the oldest son to talk and didn\u2019t want to bother Todoroki Rei. God Endickwhore really is the worst. It\u2019s like he wants to be arrested.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay Izuku. Today\u2019s mini-lesson: If you do something illegal, hide it better than this idiot. You\u2019d think it was obvious, but apparently not, so there you go.\u201d By the end of Nezu\u2019s little rant Izuku was dying of laughter. Nezu patted him on the back. \u201cWell, get your phone out. You need to give all of this to Tsukauchi and Aizawa!\u201d Midoriya nodded.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: 7xya8..sj3hsApparition: here u go!!\nDadzawa: Am I going to have to get out of my bed for this?\nApparition: na, this is just 4 tsalty\nTsalty: Before I look at that, I have a quick question.Tsalty: Do you think that I am the only person capable of handling any legal matters/arrests??Tsalty: Cause I have to deal with at least two arrests a day plus paperwork plus PR and stuff because you send me this kind of stuff every day.\nApparition: its incriminating evidence against endickwhoreApparition: should be enough to get him in jail for real\nTsalty: I\u2019ll get right on it.\nDadzawa: Wow Apparition, that's a lot of work.\nApparition: ye it took me like 3 months to do that\nDadzawa: I'm impressed.\nApparition: *squeal*\n\nDadzawa is offline\n\nTsalty: This is gonna help a lot of peopleTsalty: I\u2019m going to start filing all of the evidence right away.Tsalty: Thanks.\n\nTsalty is now offline\n\nApparition: *blushing* aww parents that care\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\nTwo months later\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nNezu: Come to the school please. Meet me in Class 1-A\nMidoriya Izuku: y\nNezu: Shinso\u2019s there and we need to talk\nMidoriya Izuku: k be there in 5\n\nNezu is now offline\n\n\nMidoriya Izuku is now offline\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh, Shinso\u2019s there. Wonder why?\u201d Midoriya peeled his face off of the desk and dragged himself towards his closet. Slowly, he shoved clothes on without regard to fashion and stumbled to the exit. Walking the short distance to the school, he finally checked the time on his phone. He woke me up at fucking 7:30?! Aren\u2019t classes in UA starting now? Why would he want me there??\n\u00a0\nEntering the building he couldn\u2019t help but feel out of place. Not only was it his second time in the school during class hours, and he hadn\u2019t been in any school since he begun to learn online, which for some reason had ended two days ago, but he was wearing his pink \u2018cornbread\u2019 sweater, orange shorts and green knife stilettos (he sharpened the heels). To be fair, they were the first things I saw and I didn\u2019t read what the sweater said. I really hope that no one sees me.\n\u00a0\nAfter having to duck and run to avoid students for around 15 times, Midoriya found himself hiding in a storage closet. Huh, this is the closet that everyone cries in. Wait, that means I can access the vents from here! Midoriya looked around the dark closet and, sure enough, he can make out the vent opening. Finally, some good luck. Midoriya whipped out his pocket knife that he had equipped with a screwdriver and started to unscrew the nails holding the cover in place. Putting months of experience to work he made quick work of it. You know, I thought window locks were bad. They\u2019ve kept me out of a lot of places, but vent covers are also pretty annoying. There are just so many of them.\n\u00a0\nSlipping into the vent it only took him a couple of minutes before he was looking down at the top of Shinso\u2019s head. Nezu must have seated them there on purpose. \n\u00a0\n\u201cUmmm Sensei? Who\u2019s in the vents?\u201d Oh yo she has headphone jacks for ears. That\u2019s awesome. Wait, why is she here? I thought Eraserhead had expelled his class?? Oh, fuck, wait are they the new kids? Shit, Nezu planned this! He\u2019s going to make me join the class isn\u2019t he! F U C K!\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah I was just about to ask that.\u201d Omg he has so many armssss. I bet he gives great hugs. All eyes were on Izuku as he unscrewed the vent and dropped onto Shinso\u2019s desk. His friend didn\u2019t even look startled to see him, but they were the only one.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, um, sorry for d-dropping in.\u201d Omg I just made a pun. I didn\u2019t even mean to. \u201cN-Nezu sent m-me here. I th-think I\u2019m supposed to j-join this class.\u201d He watched as Aizawa slammed his head through the podium.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf all people I had to be stuck with, it just had to be you.\u201d Blood began to drip from Aizawa\u2019s head and onto the floor. Snark wormed its way past anxiety and Midoriya plopped into Shinso\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m like a pixie stick; I\u2019m sweet and I\u2019ll get you high yet everyone hates me.\u201d Midoriya commented while staring Aizawa in the eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d Shinso commented, taking this a lot better than everyone else in the room. Some people were staring, others were videoing, a bird kid was whispering about chaos and revelry, and Iida, oh he did get in, seemed torn between helping Aizawa and reprimanding Midoriya. Is it just me or does he look constipated to everyone else too. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not everyone are you?\u201d Midoriya countered.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...what??\u201d Now Shinso\u2019s brain had joined the not working club. ANXIETY COME BACK! BRAIN TO MOUTH FILTER COME BACK! WHY DO YOU HATE ME?!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a fever dream.\u201d Yep, I really don\u2019t ever think. Not with Aizawa around at least. Shinso was about to respond when the door opened. The whole group turned as Nezu walked into the class looking creepily overjoyed at the chaos his son-figure has caused. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re on time. Aizawa, I am too busy with this school, and another one that we shan\u2019t mention, too continue one on one teaching with my private student here. Enjoy dealing with him.\u201d He was about to leave, but the rat(?) turned back around. \u201cOh, and if anyone bullies my son I will have you know that I won\u2019t hesitate to arrest you. I\u2019ve already sued over 100 families for hurting him and you don\u2019t want to be on the growing list.\u201d The door shut with a bang.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid he just call you his son?\u201d A bright red haired boy spoke up and everyone looked interested to see if he confirms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, y-yes. But he-he\u2019s only fo-fostering m-me for the mo-moment.\u201d Great, now my anxiety comes back. I hate my brain. Aizawa\u2019s sigh brought Midoriya\u2019s, and everyone else\u2019s, attention to him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, now that that\u2019s over, meet me outside wearing your gym clothes.\u201d He moved towards the door, but paused. \u201cAnd Midoriya,\u201d Aizawa\u2019s gaze burned into the boy and Midoriya gulped, \u201cI expect you to follow the dress code this time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSir yes sir. Although for the record, I didn\u2019t know I was going to be in school today either sooo...\u201d Aizawa sighed louder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust...leave the locks on the bathroom stalls please?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, I have no problem with those.\u201d And I\u2019m still forgetting TO NOT SASS DADZAWA. DO NOT BE SUSPICIOUS!\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d With another sigh Aizawa left, leaving a very confused group behind him. ____\nSoon the entire class was gathered on the pitch. It was then that Izuku remembered what shoes he was in. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god WHAT ARE THOOOOSE?!\u201d Ah, Lightning boy is cultured. Nice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThese. Are. My. CROCS! A-actually, th-they\u2019re heels th-that Miss M-Midnight g-gave me. The heels a-are kn-nives.\u201d Yellow-boy and Pink-girl were both openly gaping at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAttention everyone.\u201d The class turned to look at Aizawa. \u201cOkay, I know Midoriya has the entertainment level of crack cocaine but it\u2019ll be easier on my mental health if everyone ignores him. I\u2019m begging here.\u201d That brought some concerned looks and snickers from the group.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes sir. I will do everything in my power to ignore him!!\u201d Man, Iida, I\u2019m hurt. And who are you trying to karate chop?\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but he\u2019s very hard to ignore.\u201d Shinso deadpanned and Aizawa sighed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait Mr. Aizawa aren\u2019t we going to orientation?\u201d Ooo she has toe beans on her fingers! I love her already. Hopefully she doesn\u2019t decide to beat me to a pulp for no logical reason\u2026 I\u2019m so lucky Nezu blacklisted Kacchan from UA. Maybe I can finally lose that fucking nickname. I mean It\u2019s not even clever! Deku?! Seriously, if you\u2019re trying to call me useless and worthless or whatever then at least get creative. For example \u2018you\u2019re like the dull end of a knife, pointless and useless.\u2019 Boom. Original, unique, stress inducing, you remember it, everything you want when you\u2019re attempting to drive your childhood friend to suicide. Oof.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya were you listening to a word I just said?\u201d Aizawa sighed. Oh shit I was mumbling wasn\u2019t I. Yep those are \u2018you were mumbing\u2019 looks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t lie to you and you can\u2019t expel me, so by that logic my answer is no I did not.\u201d I\u2019ve stopped trying to stop myself at this point. Go, Apparition in me, be free. If I get arrested it\u2019s your fault. \n\u00a0\n\u201cI liked you better when you were a walking anxiety attack. Yaoyorozu, you go first, use your quirk and natural strength however you want to throw the ball as far as you can. Just don\u2019t leave the circle.\u201d Aizawa said, looking like he needed a break and a drink. \n\u00a0\nThe class watched as she walked up to the pitch before turning from the class and unzipping her shirt. Holy shit this got PG-13 real fast. Hiding herself by holding out the sides of her jacket she proceeded to make an entire cannon, load in the ball while ignoring the freaking out of her classmates, and launch it 1,492.53 meters. Damn, I knew she was great, but, like, wow. I somehow totally forgot about the cannon, not gonna lie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d\n\u201cBro that\u2019s so manly!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d\n\u201cWow\u201d\n\u00a0\nThankfully, Aizawa was able to quiet the class. The next events all went by in a similar fashion. Izuku, for his lack of quirk, was doing surprisingly well. Wow. Gotta remind myself to thank Nezu later for all of those P.E (but worse and with more chance of death) classes. He had managed to stay in the upper middle of the group the entire time, even with 3 inch heels on. I mean I have been training with the teachers here for like half a year, but yeah it\u2019s still dope. He managed to earn himself 7th place.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, how did you beat me? I mean, you are wearing fucking heels.\u201d At some point Shinso had walked up to the green haired boy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did?\u201d Sure enough, Shinso was in 10th and Midoriya beat them by three spots. \u201cHuh, probably a mix of being taught by more heroes than just two and manic energy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mood. Anyway, now that Dad\u2019s excuse to torture students is over I think it\u2019s lunch time.\u201d Shinso began to follow the group and walk away, but Midoriya stopped them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, Dad? Does that make us siblings?\u201d At this point, the short boy had made sure to lower his voice so as to not let anyone overhear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, if he ever figures out who you are, then yeah.\u201d Shinso had also lowered their voice even though Aizawa was not anywhere near the two.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid Dadzawa put you up to this? Trying to get me to confess my identity. Not. Gonna. Happen.\u201d Midoriya whipped his hair, didn\u2019t really work, not enough hair, and sashayed away. The heels really added to it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLunch, lunch, lunch, lunch!\u201d A girl with pink skin and the cultured pikachu boy chanted while they skipped arm in arm. Iida looked like he was about to have an aneurysm. Ah, the poor boy. But, to be fair, I kinda expected more from the future of heroes too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow imagine being that skilled at making friends.\u201d Shinso groaned while he used the diversion to sneak into the cafeteria unnoticed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know right?\u201d Grabbing a bowl of Katsudon and waiting for Shinso he quickly surveyed the room. Not finding a spot where he felt comfortable sitting, I mean can you blame me? Have you heard my school history?, he grabbed Shinso and helped the two of them slip out of the school and onto a patch of land where a few groups of third years were eating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Izuku- can I call you that? Seems better than your bitch mom\u2019s name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah sure, what should I call you? Are you sticking with your given name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care about the whole name thing too much. It\u2019s Hitoshi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay you got it Hito-chan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh ho ho, that is NOT happening. No fucking way. Nu uh. Nada. No.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cToo late, I already love it!\u201d Their chatting and wandering was interrupted by Izuku hearing his name. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey! Midoriya! Over here! Remember us?!\u201d Oh it\u2019s Tintin and his squad from class 2-A! Or I guess they\u2019re 3-A now...that\u2019s...that\u2019s kinda weird.\n\u00a0\n\u201cH-Hey guys!\u201d Grabbing Shinso\u2019s arm in his free hand he led them over to the group of three. \u201cThis is m-my f-friend Shinso H-Hitoshi. Hito-chan, th-this is Mirio, T-Tamaki, a-and Neijire. They\u2019re my f-friends from cl-lass 3-A!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, you know the coolest people. Hi, I\u2019m Shinso.\u201d The purplette introduced themself to the older students. Huh, usually Hito-chan would be more guarded when meeting new people. I guess that since they\u2019re my friends they trust them.\n\u00a0\nThe three third-years smiled, well two of them did, one of them was trying to become a rock. Greetings went back and forth for a bit before the two groups broke off again. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Hito-chan wanna eat in that tree?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...You know what? Sure. Why not.\u201d Making their way up into the tree, Shinso found a good branch. Midoriya then passed up both trays and joined them on a nearby branch, just a bit higher. They ate calmly, chatting a bit in between bites, until Midoriya caught sight of something in the tree across from them. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHey\u2026 Is it just me or is that bird like, human sized.\u201d \n\u00a0\nShinso squinted at the tree before reeling back. \u201cNo, not you, that\u2019s a huge bird. Wait...Oh my gods is that Tokoyami?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTokoyami, from our class, they\u2019re super chill and kinda androgynous. I don\u2019t remember seeing them in the boy\u2019s locker room, so I\u2019d go with they/them pronouns until otherwise stated. Let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...yeah okay, I\u2019m done with lunch anyway.\u201d Using the same technique they had used to get up they made their way down and crossed the lawn. Sparing a wave at the trio from earlier, they looked up Tokoyami\u2019s tree. \u201cHey! C-could w-we join y-you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe bird kid looked confused but nodded nonetheless. The two friends made their way up to Tokoyami\u2019s level, leaving their trays at the base of the tree. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHi, we saw you from the tree over there so we figured we\u2019d join you.\u201d Shinso greeted\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, are you creatures of the night sky as well?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cN-no w-we just wanted t-to av-void kids. Which I g-guess is hy-hypocritical cons-sider-ring we just climbed y-your t-tree.\u201d Midoriya stumbled out. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I see. Shinso was it? You seem like kin. One of the void of nothingness that sits within me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...If you mean you\u2019re non-binary too, then yeah.\u201d Wow, they can understand Tokoyami? Color me impressed. I need to brush up on my goth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIndeed. My pronouns are They/Them. I also accept Jack/Hen for my birdly side. Please...don\u2019t refer to me as cock though. While it is similar in meaning to jack in this context, it is also\u2026 well you get it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-you g-got it. No cock.\u201d The trio burst out in laughter at that. Okay you know what we\u2019re first years you can\u2019t expect us not to laugh.\n\u00a0\nBy the time he heard the bell ring Izuku had succeeded in making another friend. Wow, I never thought I would enjoy school. But being here, surrounded by supportive, caring people, I\u2019m honestly so happy. Who knew things could get so much better.\n\u201cI am here! Coming through the door like a normal person!\u201d All Might shouted as he bursted into the classroom, admittedly not like a normal person. \n\u00a0\nThe class was ecstatic. Midoriya on the other hand kept scrolling through news reports to see if there were any new villain attacks. Although it was hard to keep up with his schedule, with all his extra training, Midoriya had gotten to 98,376 arrests. Gah, I\u2019m so close!! I bet Tsukauchi and Aizawa are almost vibrating with excitement to see who I am. Well, their suffering fuels my amusement.\n\u00a0\nWhile Midoriya was in Aldera, he would randomly scroll through cameras and see what was up. This led to him figuring out All Might\u2019s identity and basically everything about him. The guy\u2019s not subtle. He\u2019ll talk about All for One in an alleyway by himself. And then he pretends like the guy\u2019s a secret. I found out about One for All and All for One on the same day for crying out loud! Midoriya still liked the guy as a hero, he did a lot of good, but he didn\u2019t think he would be that great of a teacher.\n\u00a0\nIn any case, Class 1-A had to change into their hero outfits and was brought to Ground Beta to do Battle Simulations. Midoriya\u2019s costume could be mistaken for a normal outfit, if one didn\u2019t look too closely. Dark green combat boots, made to allow him to walk silently and land safely, were found underneath black, slash-proof, water-proof, and fire-proof cargo pants that offered protection and movability. They had pockets all over them that held different capture tools. He had freeze grenades, flash bombs, smoke bombs, and exploding glue grenades, as well as zip ties and handcuffs. \n\u00a0\nOn his waist sat a belt that held stun darts, a taser gun, a whip that could harden into a staff, and his phone. His top was a black exercise shirt that fit his form and across his back sat his favorite metal bat that he had carved flowers into. On the back of his left forearm sat a touch screen that worked like a tablet and was connected to his photo through bluetooth. It had a titanium protective casing so that it wouldn\u2019t break in battle. \n\u00a0\nHis favorite part was definitely the matte black biker-themed helmet that sat on his head. However, it had more than one twist. Both sides looked like the one that Midoriya was looking out of. It was to, hopefully, stop villains from thinking they could sneak up on him. Other than that, on the outside it looked like a normal helmet, but on the inside it doubled as a command station. He could send visuals from his tablet onto the helmet\u2019s visor allowing him to layer a map or recording over his vision. On the side of the helmet sat buttons that allowed him to switch his view to heat sensing or night-vision. He could also access a projecting microphone for crowd control, had access to police radio networks, and had a feature that would send out a distress signal to all registered hero devices within two miles. \n\u00a0\n\u201cNice costume.\u201d Shinso emerged from the shadows and spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks. Looking pretty good yourself. Very Eraserhead. Like literally, is that just his costume and a mouth guard?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, the guard can make my voice mimic other people\u2019s, and I\u2019ve got Dad\u2019s projectors to expand my control range.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour hero name should be EraserMic haha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah laugh it up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFinally, after All Might got the class to quiet down, he began to explain the simulation. All Midoriya could think as the exercise was getting explained to them was: Thank God Kacchan isn\u2019t here. I definitely would have gotten paired up against him.\n\u00a0\nAn excited tap on his arm from Shinsou brought the greenette out of his thoughts. The hero student looked like they were going to lose their mind they were so excited. Confused, Midoriya looked towards the board and saw that the two of them were paired up. Oh hell yeah. And that they were first up. Could be worse I guess. And that they were the villain team. It got worse. And that they were against Todoroki and Tsuyu. We\u2019re screwed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cVillains!\u201d Came the booming voice of All Might. \u201cYou have thirty minutes to prepare! Please enter the building!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya and Shinsou both quickly walked into the building and got to the room with the bomb. Without saying a word, Midoriya picked the paper mache statue up and walked towards the staircase.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey! Where are you going?\u201d Shinsou asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are going to the farthest room possible from the entrance, that also has no windows. I\u2019ll explain why when we get there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya and Shinsou carried the bomb to a room on the fifth floor without any windows. They were pretty sure it was a supply closet. Placing the bomb there, the two caught their breath. Jeez, it takes a long time to maneuver a giant paper mache bomb up 5 floors. Who\u2019d have thought.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGonna tell me why we\u2019re here?\u201d Shinsou drawled, looking exasperated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Yeah. So, basically, UA uses these buildings for a lot more than just battle simulations. They can use them for obstacle courses or rescue simulators. I hacked into the schematics of this building and-\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso looked very impressed. \u201cWhen the hell did you have time to hack into the schematics?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya shuddered. \u201cI learned a lot during my training with Nezu. I never knew when I would have to hack anything. And let\u2019s just say that my phone is a very fancy phone. In any case, Ground Beta is primarily used for obstacle courses, but also sometimes rescue operations. Thus, there\u2019s a lot of technology inside the building that I can hack and use, even though it just looks like a big stone box. In conclusion, this building has a lot of booby traps and trip wires and stuff like that pre set up here and I\u2019m going to activate them all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOhh, that\u2019s why we want to be as far as possible, so they have to go through all of that first before they can get to us!\u201d Midoriya nodded. Shinso smiled and looked around. \u201cSo, are we just gonna spend the entire time sitting in this closet?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, we both are usually in the closet anyway, but hopefully. They don\u2019t know your quirk so we can probably do this without fighting anyone. As underground heroes these simulations aren\u2019t really ideal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwo minutes left villains!\u201d Midoriya took out his phone and pulled up the schematics. He then went through the digital building and clicked every single room except the one they were in. With a click of a button both hero students could hear a bunch of moving equipment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSounds like it\u2019s working,\u201d Shinso commented.\n\u00a0\nThey both got comfortable on the floor and started to discuss strategy. \u201cOkay, so Todoroki is probably going to freeze this entire building. With the support equipment I have at the moment, there is nothing we can do about that. So get comfortable. In any case, your quirk will still work even if we\u2019re trapped in ice so if he gets to this room just make him talk about his dad or something. Oh, and I\u2019ll be in the security feed so we\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on. Sounds good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! I think we have a good chance at winning this!\u201d Shinso seemed super pumped even though all they were going to do was wait.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour time begins now heroes, Go Go Go!\u201d All Might yelled into their mics. Oh I have an idea. \n\u00a0\nHacking into the main control room with his arm tablet he split his screen between the security feed and controls of the building and the footage of the people watching. This\u2019ll be fun to watch.\n\u00a0\nNot a second later he was encased from his waist down in ice. He looked over, and saw that Shinso was too. With a glance at his phone, Midoriya could see the sad looks on the viewer\u2019s faces. Ah, seems they think it\u2019s already over. Then an explosion rang out, and their faces turned into ones of surprise. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Shinso inquired, looking very cold and uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, I think it was the robots.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRobots!?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I turned off the death rays.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeath rays?!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cPlus Ultra I guess.\u201d\n___\n\u201cCan I get an update?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Midoriya paused the show he was watching and switched screens. \u201cThey both just fell into a pit trap that brought them to the first floor, and we only have three minutes left. I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you jinx it no one will ever find your body.\u201d They watched as Todoroki was forced to carry a now half frozen and definitely hibernating Asui across a field of trip wires. By the end he had enough stun darts in his sides to take down a minor deity. \n\u00a0\n\u201cBoth Asui and Todoroki have passed out. The villain team wins! Can young Kirishima go chip them out of the ice?\u201d The two of them high fived while laughing at the utterly bewildered faces of their comrades. \n\u00a0\n\u201cBoom! Villain and Useless\u2122 for the win!\u201d Izuku shouted at no one in particular, fists punching the air. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHaha, fuck yeah.\u201d They both looked up as the door opened to reveal their cold classmate. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOh h-hey K-Kirishima, a h-hand please?\u201d He made quick work of the ice. Soon the two of them were free and, with Kirishima\u2019s help, managed to carry Asui and Todoroki back to the viewing room. As soon as they opened the door sound exploded from inside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYo how did you do that!\u201d\n\u201cThat was so awesome is that your quirk?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you set up those traps without even moving?\u201d\n\u201cThey deserved a fair fight, you didn\u2019t even fight them!\u201d\n\u201cTo be fair, Todoroki wasn\u2019t planning on fighting either.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you beat Todoroki without using your quirks?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cH-hey now. Calm down. Calm down!\u201d All Might\u2019s booming voice finally cut through the others. Soon everyone was quiet. \u201cCan anyone tell me who the MVP was?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can sir.\u201d Yaoyorozu, huh? \u201cThe MVP was Midoriya. Not only did he come up with a quick and effective plan, but he monitored and updated his partner on the heroes' situation. Todoroki, while he did have a good plan, put his partner out of commission. Similarly, Asui was unable to assert herself in her partnership and was incapacitated upon entering the building, even while knowing she wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter in the first place due to her quirk. Shinso did nothing wrong, but still ended up leaving the planning and action all to Midoriya. Now that is not saying anything about Shinso, I understand that due to distance your quirk may not have worked and that you just didn\u2019t have a chance to show your skills, but from what I have seen, Midoriya was the MVP.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cV-very good young lady. You got...everything.\u201d Geez. She\u2019s good. I wonder if I can befriend her, she reminds me a bit of myself. Something to look into, I\u2019ll have to ask Hito-chan later if we can adopt her like Tokoyami. Maybe Ochako too, she seems nice. Obviously Todoroki needs to be on our list of kids too. \n\u00a0\nMaking his way back over to Hitoshi he couldn\u2019t help but notice how uncomfortable All Might looked. Hah. I was right. He has no fucking clue what he\u2019s doing. Haha. He put his elbow on Shinso\u2019s shoulder and watched as the next battle trial began. \n\u00a0\n\u201cSo Hito-chan, what are your thoughts on adopting Yaoyorozu and Todoroki?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs it because they\u2019re your people or because they\u2019re rich?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shut up! They\u2019ll fit right in with us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d Shinso looked at Izuku skeptically. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Yaoyorozu is the quiet, kind type, and has a knack for analysis, perfect for our squad. Todoroki needs companionship and doesn\u2019t know it. They\u2019ll be our children by the end of the week, trust me.\u201d Suddenly changing his voice to a whisper he spoke into his friend\u2019s ear. \u201cIt may also have something to do with the fact that I\u2019m having Endeavor arrested but ya know whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBro are you kidding? Why? How? You know what, why am I even asking?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...What about lighting boy?\u201d Are...Are they blushing? Oh ho ho! \u201cI\u2019m just thinking-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this a crush I smell?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-what noooo~\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou like him!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, he\u2019s like super hot and he\u2019s flirted with me twice already. I\u2019m not used to this!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cAsk him out! Ask him out! Ask him out!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShhhhh! Be quiet! And no, he can ask me out if he likes me, which he probably doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh come on you just said he keeps flirting with you!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGahhh I know!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey ended up chatting through the rest of the battles, and before they knew it class was over. Heading back to the locker room, they were shocked to be stopped by none other than Yaoyorozu.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Yoayorozu said, \u201cI remember you two from the recommendations exam, would you like to sit with me at lunch today?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUmm, y-yeah sure!\u201d Midoriya replied. \n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat! See you then!\u201d With that she left for the girls locker room, leaving her classmates confused behind her.\n\u201cSo, Midoriya, I didn\u2019t see you at the rest of the recommendation exam, yet you\u2019re at UA. How does that work?\u201d Yaoyorozu set her lunch down on the table to join Shinso and Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I-i nev-never was a re-recommendation stu-student. Nezu, m-my foster fa-father, took me under his w-wing and I became his perso-personal student. Bec-because of that, I g-got a free pass into UA.\u201d Midoriya stopped eating to answer, and Yaoyorozu started eating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, that makes sense.\u201d The girl was going to continue, but Midoriya interrupted her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTODOROKI!!! C-come sit ov-over here p-please!!!\u201d The boy in question startled and slowly turned to face the screaming one. He seemed to contemplate, and ultimately decided to walk over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello.\u201d Todoroki\u2019s face did not portray any emotion as he sat down. \u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo s-sit and talk. A-and maybe be-become friends. And your dad\u2019s a bitch. So, y-yeah.\u201d At the last part, emotion finally shone through Todoroki\u2019s mask.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, way to be subtle.\u201d Shinso remarked, and got a hit on their arm for the comment. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s true!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are so rude. Why did I ever help you?\u201d Midoriya groaned and slammed his head on the table. Yaoyorozu looked afraid for him while Todoroki still looked startled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you love me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hate that you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, not to interrupt this moment, but what did you mean before.\u201d Todoroki spoke up and Midoriya lifted his head from the table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, t-the part w-where I hate Endeavor?\u201d Todoroki nodded. \u201cWell, he sucks. N-not that t-that makes y-you suck, I m-mean, y-you aren\u2019t h-him. He\u2019s j-just a ter-terrible h-hero and f-father.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, I understand you have your own opinions, but maybe you shouldn\u2019t be so vocal about them in this situation.\u201d Yaoyorozu spoke up and Midoriya curled in on himself. All food was forgotten.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, y-you\u2019re r-right. B-but, I think T-todoroki a-agrees with me on t-this.\u201d Midoriya spoke up and recognition passed through Todoroki\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do. I\u2019ve told it to you before. You\u2019re the kid at the recommendation exam.\u201d Midoriya nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot to stop this touching moment, but we should all eat. Aizawa might get mad if we enter the room hungry. And we only have five minutes left.\u201d Shinso reasoned from the corner.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d Midoriya started to stuff his face with food, while Yaoyorozu and Todoroki ate like civilized folk. Ah, rich people. Always act better than the rest of us.___\nMidoriya held his head in his hands. UA\u2019s academics are so weird! I thought I would be ready but turns out I could take this class a thousand times and never be ready for the curriculum!\n\u00a0\nEctoplasm, their math teacher, had given Class 1-A a pop quiz to see how much information the students already knew. From what Shinso could see, Midoriya obviously didn\u2019t do so well. He was looking pretty stressed. So, like the good friend they were, Shinso looked over to see what Midoriya got. It was an 85. Shinso had gotten a 64.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear to God Izuku if you tell me that you didn\u2019t get a good grade on this test I am going to lose my mind!\u201d Midoriya looked up guilty. \u201cYou're not even supposed to know the information on it for crying out loud!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHahaha, yeah. I\u2019m overreacting, aren\u2019t I.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, ye-\u201d Shinso activated their brainwashing and Midoriya went slack. Ten seconds later, Midoriya looked around and saw his classmates laughing. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d It was less like a question and more like a statement.\n\u00a0\nShinso looked around in mock-innocence. \u201cWho, me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya sighed and walked over to Yaoyorozu, who gladly gave him her compact mirror. \u201cAnxiety Bean\u201d was written on his forehead in blocky letters. Midoriya sighed again, gave Yaoyorozu back her mirror, and walked back to his seat. Shinso was snickering the entire time. Well, can\u2019t fault them for writing the truth. Actually, no, I can.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad #4,\u201d Was all that came out of Midoriya\u2019s mouth, but it was still enough to make Shinso pale.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Midoriya gave them a look. It might have looked threatening, but in reality the boy was just trying not to laugh. Sadly, it didn\u2019t work, and the two friends were almost on the ground they were laughing so hard. The rest of the class just looked on in confusion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s Dad #4?\u201d Kaminari asked. Everyone just shrugged.____\nThe rest of the day was pretty uneventful. They even got a study hall instead of English because Present Mic wanted to give them a couple days to get used to UA before he started teaching them hell. Midoriya used that time to take down Gunslinger, a new criminal.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: 73asd86...as230Apparition: gunslinger\nDadzawa: You are so lucky you sent that while I didn\u2019t have a class.\nApparition: i thought u expelled ur class\nDadzawa: I didDadzawa: Now I have a new oneDadzawa: Complete with a problem child and everything.\nApparition: while that is a big oof you might want to go arrest this guyApparition: im not sure how long hes going to stay there\nDadzawa: Yeah I\u2019m on itDadzawa: @Tsalty you gonna back me up?\nTsalty: *long suffering sigh*Tsalty: Yeah.Tsalty: Also, Apparition, you may be interested in knowing that Endeavor\u2019s trial is being kept under wraps for now but will be broadcasted live in a week.\nApparition: oh thank the gods \n\nDadzawa is now offline\n\n\nTsalty is now offline\n\n\nApparition is now offline\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cOooo, who were you texting, little listener?\u201d Present Mic asked from over Midoriya\u2019s shoulder. Where the hell did he come from!?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, uh j-just my dad. H-he was wondering when I w-was getting home,\u201d shit shit shit shitshitshit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, isn\u2019t Nezu fostering you? Wouldn\u2019t he already know?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s pure panic must have shown on his face because Present Mic took pity on him. Laughing he said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll let you have your secret!\u201d He shook his head and gave Shinso a look, \u201cKids these days.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya turned to see Shinso laughing wildly besides him. \u201cOh my God, you were texting Dad weren\u2019t you! I\u2019ve never seen you so scared in my life, and I watched you try to pet a cat for the first time!\u201d The purplette was cracking up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d Midoriya hissed. \u201cHe almost caught me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t though! You were just so suspicious!\u201d Looking back on it, Midoriya realized that that was a true statement. Another failed attempt at not being suspicious I guess. Maybe that\u2019s what I should get Nezu to teach me. Improv.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually a great idea!\u201d Shinso looked on in amusement and confusion. \u201cI should learn how to improv more! Then I can be less suspicious and also it could work in many different hero situations!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso nodded and hummed in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s not a half-bad idea. Maybe I should do that as well since my quirk is reaction based,\u201d Midoriya grinned. \u201cBut don\u2019t think I forgot about what just happened,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s grin disappeared. \u201cI will hold it over your head for the rest of time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHito-chan!!\u201d\n\u201cClass, shut up.\u201d At the commanding, and terrifying voice, every mouth in the room shut. Eraserhead looked pleased with himself and continued to speak. \u201cToday we are doing something different.\u201d Tension spiked. \u201cPick a class representative.\u201d Tension lowered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wanna be class rep!\u201d\n\u201cSo do I!\u201d\n\u201cVote for me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile all of this was going on, Aizawa lowered himself into his sleeping bag and zipped it up. Well, he\u2019s clearly not going to be any help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Ahh, rule abiding Iida to the rescue. \u201cWe should take a vote instead of just screaming at each other.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut then everyone will just vote for themselves.\u201d Shinso spoke up from their seat, looking absolutely done with everything. Shush, let Iida have this. At least he got everyone to shut up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d Okay, now I\u2019m lost. \u201cNot everyone will vote for themselves, which means that the person with the most votes will be the most trusted.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s so manly. Let\u2019s vote!\u201d Kirishima commented and muttered agreement swept around the room.\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, now that you forced me to count all of the votes, we've got Midoriya with 3 votes and Yaoyorozu with 2. Congratulations, Midoriya is president and Yaoyorozu is vice.\u201d Aizawa did not seem congratulatory when he said it. Midoriya, on the other hand, was having a hard time understanding what happened. \u2026 what? Nope, I\u2019m not doing that. Public speaking is not my thing, either I get too sassy or I stutter my way through a sentence that doesn\u2019t even make sense. And I don\u2019t really have the time to deal with this and my \u2018vigilante\u2019 requirements.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya turned to Shinso, trying to convey his horror about this arrangement. They seemed to get the message, and responded by trying not to laugh. Traitor. \n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s all for this class. Goodbye.\u201d Aizawa disappeared into the bright yellow sleeping bag just as the bell rang. As the entire class got ready for the next class Shinso meandered next to Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReady for the next class, pres? I think it\u2019s English.\u201d Midoriya put on his pitiful face and slumped onto the desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t vote for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you vote for yourself?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen how did you have a vote?\u201d Midoriya questioned while he waited for Present Mic\u2019s to appear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t notice I had a vote.\u201d Shinso explained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait a minute. You voted for pikachu didn\u2019t you.\u201d Shinso\u2019s eyes widened and a small blush graced their cheeks. \u201cYou did! But Kaminari only had one vote, which means he voted for someone else. That means he probably voted for you!\u201d The blush got bigger.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d Midoriya leveled his friend with a look that said \u2018yes we do, stop intentionally being an idiot\u2019.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, now you have to ask him out. Or at least talk to him some more. You should probably talk first, but I don\u2019t really know anything about dating etiquette.\u201d Shinso looked ready to murder while also being the color of a tomato. \n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m not doing either of those things.\u201d Midoriya kept staring and Shinso relented. \u201cFine, I\u2019m probably going to speak to him again, but not now.\u201d The stare did not stop. \u201cShut up.\u201d Shinso stalked back to their desk right as Present Mic kicked open the door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood Morning! How is everyone?\u201d Half the class responded by blinking, having only a vague idea of what the teacher just said. This is another reason I am indebted to Nezu. English is no match for a sadistic mastermind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood, how are you?\u201d Midoriya spoke up after the silence had gotten a bit too heavy. Shinso gave him a confused glance and motioned for him to pull out his phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat! Thanks for asking! Now for today\u2019s class we are going over common phrases. Can anyone tell me what good morning is in Japanese?\u201d Yeah, I don\u2019t have to pay attention to this. Midoriya quickly pulled out his phone and Shinso did the same.\n\u00a0\n\nSib from Another Crib\n\nPurple: How do you know English?\nGreen: nezu made me learn it\nGreen: and many criminals use it to try to stop people from overhearing them\nPurple: huh, fair enough\nGreen: shouldnt u be paying attention tho\nPurple: Mic adopted me\nPurple: I\u2019m an English god\nGreen: rite i forgot\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, since you seem to be good at English, can you tell me what this is?\u201d Midoriya pocketed his phone and on the board was a simple What time is it?\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat time is it? That's what it says.\u201d Present Mic smiled and nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCorrect! Now, can anyone tell me the word that shows that it is a question.\u201d\n\nSib from Another Crib\n\nGreen: this is so boring\nGreen: ima go die\nGreen: b rite back\nPurple: I\u2019ll miss u\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cFinally, lunch.\u201d Shinso said from the lunch table. \u201cI thought it would never come.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSame, class was boring. And I\u2019ve still not figured out a way to get out of the fancy smancy president position that only idiots want.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d Yaoyorozu spoke up from her seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t really have the time for it.\u201d Midoriya mentioned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPower is always a burden, but someone must carry it.\u201d Todoroki entered his own thoughts to the conversation, and then kept eating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was deep, not gonna lie.\u201d Shinso commented, looking shook.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI agre-\u201d A loud alarm interrupted Midoriya\u2019s statement and everyone froze. That\u2019s a code 3 alarm. Someone has broken into UA! \n\u00a0\nMidoriya whipped out his phone and logged into the camera system. He moved from gate to gate until he saw the one that was destroyed. It was the press? But how, no one that I know of has that power. That\u2019s when he saw someone that didn\u2019t belong there. A blue haired teenager in a hoodie. Quickly, Midoriya froze the screen on the person. Let\u2019s see what I can find about you.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone! Calm down! It\u2019s just the press.\u201d Iidas voice broke Midoriya out of his thoughts and he looked up. Why is everyone so bundled together? And how did Iida get on top of that sign? Slowly, everyone stopped screaming, which Midoriya had somehow not noticed up until this point, and just stood around. Welp, time to get to class I guess. I\u2019ll just have to get around all of these people first.\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-i\u2019d like t-to give my po-position to Iida. H-he really st-stood up for ever-everyone and st-stopped a bad situation fr-from getting worse.\u201d Midoriya stood up in front of the class and everyone, except Shinso, looked shocked to hear what he had to say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that even allowed?\u201d Iida asked and Aizawa shrugged. \u201cWell, I would be grateful to take the position. I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThank goodness, I\u2019m really glad that worked. Midoriya sat down and felt his phone vibrate from his backpack.\n\u00a0\n\nSib from Another Crib\n\nPurple: I knew you were going to do that\nGreen: shut up\nIzuku walked into school the next day feelings like it would be his last. He had been searching until his alarm rang that morning for the hooded figure but the guy simply didn\u2019t exist. He didn\u2019t have a quirk file, school record, hospital visit, nothing. He literally was a ghost. That\u2019s...a real fuckin bad sign. Even texting dads 1,2, and 4 didn\u2019t work since they\u2019ve never seen him before. I wonder if I can get Tamaki to give me dad #5\u2019s number, that\u2019s a thought. Oh ho ho, I should ask Mirio for Sir Nighteye\u2019s! That would be so much fun, my dad senses are tingling already!\n\u00a0\nHe was knocked out of his thoughts by Shinso coming up behind him. \u201cYo bro you good? I\u2019ve been trying to call your name over your muttering for like three minutes now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaha yeah I\u2019m good, bad feeling is all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...okay dude. I trust you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAwww trust! Hito-chan I feel so loved! You\u2019re like the parent I never had! Oh wait\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shut up! Seriously though, ugh, if you need me to tell Dad about this I will.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah yeah... thanks.\u201d The rest of the short walk to their classroom was quiet.\n\u00a0\nThey passed a few students on the way, but none that they recognized. Even though the duo didn\u2019t recognize anyone, they kept giving them weird looks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are people staring at us?\u201d Shinso commented after the fourth person.\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably because you\u2019re Dadzawa\u2019s and Past Mic\u2019s adopted child and I\u2019m a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma wearing 4 inch heels. People are bound to be curious.\u201d Shinso groaned and tried to hide behind Midoriya. Dude, you\u2019re like two feet taller than me. Even with the heels that\u2019s not going to work.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan they not?! I don\u2019t like the attention.\u201d Midoriya shrugged.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t really do anything about it,\u201d Wait a minute, \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d Shinso began to look distrustful. \u201cEver want to go through the vents?\u201d____\n\u201cGood morning Aizawa-sensei.\u201d Midoriya dropped into an almost empty classroom through the ceiling. Iida ,why is he always here, looked aghast.\n\u00a0\n\u201cProblem child, it\u2019s not okay to get everywhere through the vents,\u201d Aizawa seemed to be considering the pros and cons of slamming his head through the podium again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shinso responded as he also landed on the desk. Aizawa\u2019s eyes widened. Iida passed out. And Midoriya could just make out the teacher\u2019s horrified whisper: \u201cOh my god there\u2019s two of them.\u201d \n\u00a0\nFollowing all of that, the two \u2018siblings\u2019 broke down in hysterical laughter. Midoriya going as far as to tip and fall off the desk, he landed in a ball on the floor.\n\u00a0\nAizawa ran his hand down his face and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for this. Sit down and be quiet until class starts.\u201d He then copied Midoriya and curled up in a ball, but in his very bright yellow sleeping bag of course.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAye aye sir.\u201d Shinso snickered. Midoriya slowly picked himself off the floor and sat on Shinso\u2019s desk. Aizawa just sighed and closed his eyes.____\n\u201cOkay, I have an announcement to make.\u201d Aizawa had finally decided to grace the students with his presence. Is the announcement about how he\u2019s going to finally murder me? That would be funny. I think it would make Iida pass out again. \u201cWe are going on a field trip today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally! I was expecting something more life threatening.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like so much fun!\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s hair began to float and his eyes glowed. \u201cWhoever decides to keep talking will find themselves unable to join the rest of the class,\u201d Silence descended upon the room. \u201cI\u2019ll explain where we\u2019re going on the bus. Get into your hero costumes and meet me at the front gate in five minutes.\u201d As soon as Aizawa stopped talking Midoriya was out of his seat and through the door. Five minutes isn\u2019t a lot of time and I really can\u2019t afford to get on Dadzawa\u2019s worse side.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya looked behind him and saw Shinso also scrambling out of the room. Huh, guess they\u2019re afraid of what will happen if they\u2019re late too. \n\u00a0\nThe green haired student changed into his costume in record time and was at the front gate in 3 minutes and 30 seconds. It\u2019s really helpful that I don\u2019t have one of the ultra fancy costumes. And that I\u2019m fueled with fear right now. Aizawa was already standing there, looking unimpressed even though Midoriya was the first one out.\n\u00a0\n15 seconds later Shinso was also seen sprinting out of the building and towards their adopted father and their friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice job Hitoshi. That was very fast.\u201d Aizawa commented. I WAS HERE BEFORE THEM! WHY DO YOU HATE ME?!\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow thanks for the praise dad,\u201d Izuku replied sarcastically.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shit. I said dad. End me now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The boy who was totally not Apparition replied, feigning ignorance. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Shinso asked just to feel included and because they\u2019re petty.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Asked Asui as she entered the waiting area.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Aizawa answered. \u201cNow, we have one minute left. You guys have better hope that your fellow classmates show up soon.\u201d I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the ones who should worry if they\u2019re late.____\n1 minute and 23 seconds later everyone was loaded onto the bus and the group set off to who-knows-where because Aizawa had decided not to tell everyone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI tend to always say what\u2019s on my mind.\u201d Asui broke the silence with the random statement. \u201cSo, I have to ask, how are you here Midoriya?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you see, when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much-\u201d He was cut off by his arm being smacked by Shinso, reminding him who his audience was. \u201cI-I m-mean, w-what do y-you mean A-Asui?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCall me Tsuyu. To clarify, no one here saw you at the entrance exam and Yaoyorozu said that you didn\u2019t take the recommendation exam. So, how are you at UA?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-oh, w-well I\u2019m N-nezu\u2019s per-personal student, s-so I g-got a fr-free pass.\u201d Midoriya stammered out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I see. Thank you for the answer.\u201d Asui leaned back, satisfied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re Nezu\u2019s personal student?! That\u2019s insane! So manly!\u201d Kirishima parroted from his seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, how does that work? How did that even happen?\u201d Shinso\u2019s crush asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-i\u2019m n-not re-really sure. He kinda j-just found me h-hacking into UA\u2019s-\u201d He froze at the sight of Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrowing from the front of the bus. \u201cI-I-I mean whaaaaaa~t?! I totally didn\u2019t do that! I-I meant he just found my house and kidnapped me! Y-yeah! A-and then he arrested my m-mom, took over my school, sued my childhood friend, and fostered me!\u201d Shinso face palmed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cToo much information buddy. I don\u2019t think you helped your case at all.\u201d This time it was Midoriya who hit them on the arm. Silence covered the bus as everyone was trying to process what he just said. He could see Aizawa typing on his phone and silently prayed to the gods that he hadn\u2019t just outed himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I can see that.\u201d____\n\u201cWelcome to Unforeseen Simulation Joint, also known as USJ!\u201d Oh, so that\u2019s the name. I always thought it stood for Universal Studios Japan. \u201cMy name is Thirteen and I\u2019ll be your host for today.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\nOmg okay they\u2019re so freaking adorable! I need to find some way to get them to adopt me. My parent senses are vibrating off the charts. I wonder what a better word for that would be\u2026 Dad-scan? No, that\u2019s way too non-inclusive. Son-dar? Nope sounds like a bad ripoff of gaydar. Son-ar. Haha it\u2019s like sonar but with a soft \u2018o\u2019. I\u2019m a pun genius. Why is Hito-chan snickering\u2026? Oh shit I\u2019m mumbling aren\u2019t I. Yep, definitely. \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god Izuku how many parents do you need? Don\u2019t you have like ten dads?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor your information I only have five, which is nowhere near enough, and a long list of candidates. And you\u2019re no-OH MY GODS WHAT IS THAT?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe entire class turned to look at the growing smoke-ish cloud in the center of the plaza. While the group turned to see what it was villains started to emerge from it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this part of the simulation, because it\u2019s pretty unforeseen.\u201d Uraraka joked nervously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, those are villains.\u201d Aizawa responded.\n\u201cNo, those are villains.\u201d Aizawa responded urgently, \u201cEveryone get back! Kaminari, Midoriya, send out a distress signal, I\u2019ll handle these guys.\u201d By the time he had finished talking he had already jumped into the fight. \n\u00a0\nIzuku worked quickly, sending out texts, emails, alarms, anything he could, to the teachers. In the end, only his helmet\u2019s special alarm got through. Oh thank god that worked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working! They must be jamming our signal!\u201d Kaminari shouted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I got out a signal!\u201d Midoriya responded, trying to calm the spreading fear. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hack into the main control frame but there\u2019s a quirk corrupting my tablet. I think I can get through though, it\u2019ll take a minute, cover me!\u201d \n\u00a0\nHe missed his classmates responses, fully focused on his slowly corrupting device. Come on come on...there! Shit! \u201cI can\u2019t access the controls! They\u2019re all manual machinery!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck fuck fuck.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die!\u201d\n\u201cWe need a plan!\u201d\n\u201cLook out!\u201d \n\u00a0\nThe group all turned to see the mist man appearing out of thin air. Midoriya took the distraction that Kirishima provided to rush under the stairs to the control panel. Taking his bat he smashed through the door\u2019s lock and entered the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey!\u201d Some villain yelled. Okay I\u2019m counting three guys...wait is that Viper? How did he get out of jail?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, my mom bailed me out.\u201d Huh, I must have spoken out loud.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude what are you doing? Aren\u2019t we supposed to kill the kid or something?\u201d Said one of the other two villains. I\u2019m calling him Billy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, this one\u2019s chill. Speaking of moms, did yours get arrested yet?\u201d Holy shit this is not happening.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm y-yeah she d-did. I\u2019m staying w-with N-Nezu now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly SHIT you\u2019re Nezu\u2019s kid?! Fuck no! I\u2019m not fighting a kid who\u2019s dad is that freak!\u201d Bitch! No one says that about my D4! Breaking his \u2018no violence\u2019 rule he made quick work of smashing his metal bat full force into \u2018Billy\u2019s head. Viper didn\u2019t even flinch while the other villain crept backwards.\n\u00a0\n\u201cViper, why are you here? I didn\u2019t know you were a hacker.\u201d Midoriya commented while he stepped over the unconscious villain. Huh, I guess my anxiety is gone? Maybe I should bash heads more often!\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just hired protection. Hackers aren\u2019t usually the most fit.\u201d Viper answered, not even caring that Midoriya was coming closer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair. Although, I do kinda take offense to that seeing as I\u2019m a hacker.\u201d Midoriya retorted. The other villain looked like Iida: about to pass out and very confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOops. I meant no offense little man. Anyway, so you said your mom is in jail?\u201d Viper asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s gone. Thank goodness.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s great! Good for you. I hate that bitch.\u201d Midoriya nodded. Me too. Wait, this is not the time for casual conversation with a surprisingly nice villain. I have a job to do.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind if I messed with the controls a bit would you?\u201d Midoriya cautiously took another step forwards.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYa know what? Go for it. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I really want to see what all of these buttons do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe other villain finally stepped in. \u201cHey! You can\u2019t do that, he\u2019s a hero brat!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah but he\u2019s one of us.\u201d The villain looked surprised, but Viper wasn\u2019t about to back down. \n\u00a0\n\u201c... fine. But I don\u2019t want to get arrested.\u201d The other (conscious) villain, I should really learn his name, stepped back and into the corner.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise that, but I\u2019ll vouch for you and I\u2019ll tell the cops you helped me out. Fair? Also, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Midoriya responded.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...yeah okay. And it\u2019s Hacman.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...you\u2019re kidding.\u201d This is the weirdest interaction I\u2019ve ever had. Actually, Tree boy might have been worse.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod damn it.\u201d Izuku muttered. \u201cWelp, I\u2019ve kinda got to save my friends, so\u2026 yeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh right. I forgot this was supposed to be a fight.\u201d Viper murmured. Then he moved aside to allow Izuku to access the control.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, so, first I\u2019ve got to stop the block on communication.\u201d Midoriya cracked his knuckles and turned to all of the fancy buttons.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. It isn\u2019t a bug. It\u2019s someone\u2019s quirk.\u201d Hacman responded and Midoriya sighed. Why is my life never easy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat, then I can at least take control of USJ.\u201d Midoriya began to type.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Viper asked. At this point he was leaning over Midoriya\u2019s shoulder, trying to see what he was doing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis place has a bunch of different equipment hidden. That includes a bunch of robotic \u2018villains\u2019 and other little inconveniences. All I have to do is activate them all and then\u2026\u201d Midoriya did jazz hands, \u201cchaos!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh. Interesting.\u201d Viper replied. Midoriya had stopped listening, too busy trying to save all of his classmates' lives.\n\u00a0\n\nOkay, Aizawa is down in the main square, but everyone else is scattered throughout the place. This means I\u2019m going to have to tailor the hidden inconveniences to not happen if my classmates are nearby. That shouldn\u2019t be too hard.\n\n\u00a0\nQuickly flipping through cameras he began to activate different robots and disaster effects. He started in the landslide zone. Waiting until all of his classmates were behind cover he activated the area before moving to the fire zone and dropping the emergency water support. He then drained the shipwreck zone, set loose the snow avalanche, altered the coding of and let loose the robots in the downpour zone so that they\u2019d only attack the villains, etc. \n\u00a0\nIt went like this for the next two minutes until a loud bang alerted him of the teachers\u2019 presences. Oh good, my helmet alarm worked. Flipping his camera to the main square he could see Aizawa still efficiently making his way through the large group of thugs, only halfway to the leader-looking guy. \n\u00a0\nHe and Viper (and the other guy, but I don\u2019t really count him) watched as All Might rounded up the, all relatively unscathed, students before going for the leader and his black muscle friend. Present Mic, Midnight, Ectoplasm, and Snipe all started to help Aizawa with the villains while the other teachers helped the students and Thirteen to evacuate.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWelp, I guess I\u2019m done.\u201d Midoriya powered down the mega computer and strapped his forgotten bat onto his back. As he started to move towards the door he saw that Hacman was nursing the now conscious villain back to health. \u201cI should go see if everyone is okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh yeah. Have fun!\u201d Viper responded and opened a hidden passage. \u201cI\u2019ll be going too. See you around.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup! Bye!\u201d Midoriya waved and left the room. The sound of fighting was still going on, so he slowly peaked from behind the stairs. Just as he did, All Might punched a giant bird-man-thingy through the roof of USJ. Wow, overkill. With another look, he saw that all of the villains had been taken down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello Problem Child.\u201d Midoriya whipped around to see that Aizawa had walked up behind him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUmmmm. I was in the control room helping you guys. So, yeah.\u201d Aizawa just noticed to door behind the small child and sighed. He does that a lot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s get you with the rest of the class.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\nThe students and teachers all looked up as Aizawa approached with a pleased looking Izuku.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude where were you?!\u201d\n\u201cWe were so worried!\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku was taken aback by the concern of his classmates. I honestly forgot again that people care now haha. It\u2019s nice. \u201cGuys it\u2019s chill! I was in the control room helping you all.\u201d He watched the wave of understanding and gratitude roll over the group. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWait so did they not have anyone guarding the control room? That\u2019s so stupid.\u201d Yaoyorozu spoke up. \n\u00a0\n\u201cNo they did. There were only three guys though. One of them is I guess a friend from when I was arrested, one I made friends with pretty quickly, and one I smashed in the head with my bat!\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were arrested?!\u201d\n\u201cYou did what to that guy?!\u201d\n\u201cHow on earth did you befriend a villain?\u201d\n\u201cAnd they just let you use the controls?!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s SO MANLY dude!!\u201d \n\u201cOf course you did\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe reunion was disrupted by a familiar voice. \u201cMidoriya, right? I\u2019m so sorry to interrupt but I need your statement.\u201d Omg it\u2019s Dad #1! When did he get here?\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure Tsukauchi!\u201d At the suspicious look he realized his mistake. God, pretending to be dumb is harder than I expected. \u201cI remember you from when you helped me with my mom. Midoriya Inko?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cAh yes, I remember now. Anyway, please follow me.\u201d The two of them left USJ and walked the short distance to a cop car, where Izuku sat himself on the hood. \u201cNow, please give me all of the details of what just happened. And I\u2019m sure you remember my quirk?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d It helps that I\u2019ve known you for a lot longer than you would think. \u201cOkay so when we entered the building Thirteen was there and Yagi was missing.\u201d He saw Tsukauchi give him a shocked look. Oh right. I know he knows who All Might is, but I guess that would be jarring to hear from a kid. \u201cI was talking with my friend when I noticed the portal form in the center of the plaza. I shouted out, and Da-Aizawa told me and Pik-Kaminari to send out an emergency signal before jumping at the villains. \nI managed to get out the emergency signal in my helmet and made my way to the control center. I recognized the villain Viper from my time in holding and he helped me out with making friends with one of the other two, Hacman, who then let me pass. There was a third villain but he insulted my dad so I beat his head in with my bat. He didn\u2019t wake up until much later. Anyways, then I started to carefully activate the different sites in order to help my classmates take out the villains. Once that was done we, me and the other villains, just watched until Aizawa found me.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u00a8Wow, I\u2019m extremely impressed.\u201d Oh my gods I never knew how much I needed to hear those words\u2026 \u201cYou kept calm in a tough situation, managed to call for help, and even succeeded in safely and mostly non-violently handling a villain situation even while outmatched and alone. You even were able to help all of your classmates. You did everything right...you\u2019re going to be a great hero.\u201d I think he\u2019s layering it on a little thick, but I love it.\n\u00a0\nShinso and Aizawa, who were watching this go down, both smiled to themselves as Izuku almost broke down into tears. Dad #2 \u2026 thanks for believing in me.\n\u00a0\nAt that moment Midoriya almost up and said that he was Apparition, but thought better of it. He might have been close to 100,000 arrests, but he wasn\u2019t there yet. Granted I\u2019m only like 500 off but still. Wiping the totally nonexistent tears from his eyes, Midoriya smiled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cT-thanks Tsukauchi. That means a lot to me. I\u2019m really glad I could help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, you did good and didn\u2019t lie, so that really helps me out. You know, you remind me of a friend. He\u2019s a vigilante, so not the greatest person, but he helps a lot of people from the shadows like you did. \u201d\n\u00a0\nOkay, time to stage my escape before I accidentally expose myself. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I remind you of a vigilante. Totally the look I was going for. On another note, Hito-chan let\u2019s go over there!\u201d Wow, that was a lot less smooth than it was in my head. In any case\u2026\n\u00a0\nShinso was slightly more amused then they should have been as they were pulled away from the two adults. Only once they got to a little clump of trees did Midoriya let go of his friend\u2019s hand and sit down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou just did that to not blow your cover didn\u2019t you?\u201d Shinso looked down at the mortified boy below him.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya nodded, \u201cAs much as I want to tell them now, I should wait. There\u2019s more things I can do with my anonymity than if they knew who I was. And with my track record of being super suspicious and losing my anxiety around them I decided it would be better if I just left the area.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShinso sighed, \u201cYou do realize that exit was still very suspicious though, right?\u201d Midoriya slapped them on the leg and huffed, sadly knowing that his friend was right. Shinso glared and hopped out of the greenettes reach. Humph. I need longer arms. Or I could get up and go over to them. Yeah, I definitely need longer arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear that after I just saved all of your lives!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s valid. What a day am I right?\u201d Shinso plopped down next to their friend. Aizawa and Tsuckauchi were seen talking where Midoriya and Shinso just left.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, that was actually pretty chill for me. I mean, I hacked and I talked to some friendly villains. Pretty normal. Well, not the friendly villain part, that doesn\u2019t usually happen.\u201d That's still super weird to say out loud. Especially because it\u2019s correct. That was a pretty normal day.\n\u00a0\nShinso seemed to be thinking the same thing because they sighed and patted the short boy on the head. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t all be semi-famous vigilantes with names no one knows how to pronounce.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cApparition isn\u2019t that hard to pronounce!\u201d He yelled. The vigilante quickly quieted down and looked towards Tsukauchi and Aizawa, but, thankfully, the two didn\u2019t seem to have heard him. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly fine vigilante name thank you very much.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you even come up with it? I\u2019ve watched all of these tv shows that show that the police usually pick the name.\u201d Shinso asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPolice usually pick the name for serial killers. I am not a serial killer. And, seeing as I am in direct contact with the police I got to choose my name.\u201d Midoriya explained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs Apparition really the best you come up with?\u201d Midoriya pouted. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s bad, just that there are so many better options.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up, I was like ten. However, I think it is a very good name that fits me well. I\u2019m like a ghost! But being called Ghost is lame and generic, thus Apparition. To be fair, at first I wanted to be called Alley Apparition, but that makes me sound like a drug dealer or a horse girl and now that I say it out loud it really is a terrible name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, that is so bad.\u201d Shinso burst into laughter and Midoriya slapped them again. \u201cIn all seriousness though, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. It was pretty scary in there. And I know that you see danger all the time- although not in person I guess, still counts- but \u2026 but for the rest of us, it was really terrifying to be attacked like that,\u201d Shinso paused and looked at their classmates, who were scattered around the area, \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay though. No one got very hurt, and the pros got here before it got any worse. I guess that\u2019s kind of thanks to you, Alley Apparition.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were having a moment Shinso and you had to go ruin it didn\u2019t you. You know what, did you become a vigilante at age like 10 and now almost have 100,000 arrests? No, I didn\u2019t think so. So stop commenting on my alias!\u201d Midoriya stood up and started to tickle the purplette viciously before stopping when he noticed that Tsuckauchi was coming towards them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, hi Tsuckauchi sir. Why are you coming over here?\u201d Shinso immediately shut up and turned around.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just got a text from Nezu.\u201d Both of the teens blanched. \u201cHe said that with the recent attack it is not safe for Midoriya to stay with him.\u201d That\u2019s so much better than I expected. But still also the worst thing he could have said honestly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo where will I be staying?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, well, Nezu said that you trust me, so you\u2019re staying with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Well, that was unexpected.\u201d\n\u201cSo, um, er, I know that Nezu\u2019s scary and all, but are you really okay with housing me?\u201d Midoriya broached the subject while the two were driving to Tsuckauchi\u2019s house. Yeah, I might have asked this a little late, but better late than never!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this of my own free will. I mean, you needed a place to go, and you\u2019re a great kid, and I have the space, so why wouldn\u2019t I want you to stay?...Is this about your mom?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I mean, kinda, but also not. I was just wondering; you don\u2019t know me but you\u2019re taking me in. Why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Tsuckauchi looked like he wanted to say more, but stopped once he saw where they were. \u201cAh, we\u2019re here.\u201d The car pulled into a driveway and stopped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. This is a nice house.\u201d Midoriya looked out the window and smiled. So this is Tsalty\u2019s home, and I\u2019m going to be living here. Wow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Dad #2 got out of the car and walked towards the trunk. Midoriya slid out too, and moved to join him.\n\u00a0\nTogether the two pulled out all of Midoriya\u2019s belongings and dumped them on the driveway. Midoriya bent down and picked up two of the heavier boxes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d \u2026 what?\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Midoriya questioned while barely being able to see Tsuckauchi over the boxes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry anything. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut it\u2019s my stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should rest. You just got attacked by villains.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah that happens. You have a job. I shouldn\u2019t take up any of your time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m your guardian. You\u2019re supposed to take up my time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do hope you realize you can\u2019t win this.\u201d Midoriya turned around and began to walk towards the front door. He could hear Tsuckauchi\u2019s sigh from behind him. Ha, don\u2019t underestimate my annoyance factor. \n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, you kind of need to open the door.\u201d Midoriya said from behind the stack of boxes in his arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d Tsalty appeared out of nowhere and produced a key. Midoriya moved out of the way and Tsuckauchi quickly opened the door. As soon as the door opened, something launched itself onto Midoriya and he stumbled backwards. Sadly, to his back was the stairs and he quickly tumbled down them.\n\u00a0\nWell, this is embarrassing. What if the boxes break?! Midoriya tried to maneuver in midair to both protect the boxes and himself, but it didn\u2019t work very well. The teenager hit the ground with a resounding thud and groaned in pain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya! Are you okay?!\u201d He looked up to see Tsuckauchi\u2019s concerned face. He groaned again. Putting the boxes that were still in his arm down, he looked to see what had hit him. It was a god. A medium sized, chunky, black weiner-dog-ish dog had knocked him over. And there goes my dignity.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice attack dog Tsa- Tsukauchi,\u201d Midoriya moved himself into a standing position and started picking back up his boxes of stuff. Tsukauchi sheepishly helped his new charge and led them both inside.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHer name is Mira. She, as you can tell, likes new people. I didn\u2019t expect her to bowl you over like that though. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Midoriya nods and the detective pauses, something occuring to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not allergic to dogs are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya laughed, \u201cNo, I have no allergies that I\u2019m aware of. Thanks for your concern though.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe boxes were quickly deposited in the middle of the living room, and were sorted into clothes, hygiene related stuff, and other. Midoriya went to pick them back up, but was stopped by Tsalty telling him to get ready for dinner. Yeah, I suppose the boxes can wait until later. Stepping into the hall bathroom he washed his hands before looking at himself in the mirror. Huh, his bathroom looks a lot like my mom\u2019s. That\u2019s kinda ironic considering Tsalty was the one to put her away. I should thank him later. \n\u00a0\nStepping out of the bathroom he met Tsukauchi in the kitchen, who already had rice going and was cutting up vegetables. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind stir fry, I suppose when I offered to host you I didn\u2019t consider the state of my fridge haha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh it\u2019s totally fine. I can go shopping tomorrow.\u201d Izuku replied sincerely. \n\u00a0\n\u201c...what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Oh shit I should have considered that he might not be willing to pay for that. Shit shit shit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you offering to go shopping? Obviously it was my mistake and as the adult I\u2019ll be going shopping tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...No, I\u2019m the kid so obviously I\u2019m supposed to do the shopping? It\u2019s my fault you need more food.\u201d The two looked at each other, both thoroughly confused with the conversation. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, we both need food and I\u2019m here to care for you...did Nezu make you buy your own food??\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, no, but he never went shopping either.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh, did your mom\u2026? Oh. Oh I understand now\u2026 look Midori-um Izuku, your mom obviously wasn\u2019t treating you right, it\u2019s why she\u2019s in jail, as a parent she was supposed to be buying food and clothes and making sure you had the things you needed.\u201d Well I mean yeah but I\u2019m not- \u201cBut now that you\u2019re staying here, I\u2019m going to promise to make sure you always have those things. You don\u2019t need to go shopping because, as your guardian, it\u2019s my responsibility. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm.\u201d Shit I can\u2019t say no or else he\u2019ll think I\u2019m stupid and throw me out! But if I say yes he\u2019ll know I\u2019m lying!\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to say no Izuku\u2026\u201d Fuck I must have mumbled that... does he mean it? Why am I so worried about this, this is Tsalty we\u2019re talking about.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, not really, I don\u2019t get why you would have to take care of me when it\u2019s me who's causing this.\u201d He said, looking down at his hands and subconsciously expecting backlash. He even failed to subdue his flinch when he felt Tsukauchi\u2019s hands on his shoulders. \n\u00a0\n\u201cIzuku, I need you to look at me. You\u2019re a kid. I\u2019m fostering you for now so it\u2019s my duty to look out for you. You\u2019re not my roommate who\u2019s leeching off of me or something, you\u2019re someone I\u2019ve agreed to care for and host, okay?\u201d Tsukauchi gave him the kindest and most sincere look he could, hoping that it had worked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-Okay.\u201d I can try this. It won\u2019t be like Nezu, but maybe it\u2019ll be fine! I mean he\u2019s a great guy who only wants what\u2019s best for people, it\u2019s why I give him all of my work, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling like this. His train of thought was interrupted by the small, fat dog running up and bonking into his leg. He laughed before reaching down to pet his new friend.\nWaking up in Tsukauchi\u2019s guest room was not how Izuku imagined the day after his first villain fight. Omg, yesterday was a nightmare. For some reason, Dadzawa decided to text the group chat and both of their phones went off at the same time. Midoriya freaked out and ran from the room. Thankfully, Tsalty didn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\u00a0\nEven though Midoriya was fully awake, it took him a few minutes to realize where he even was, and even longer to notice the note on his door. Squinting at it so that he didn\u2019t have to get up, he managed to read it. \n\u00a0\n\u201cI apologize for having to leave early. I know this must be stressful for you, being in a new place, but there is an extremely important case that I have to attend in court today. I should be back before dinner, I hope. ...What case is he- ENDICKWHORE! Holy shit, I can\u2019t believe I forgot that the hearing was today! I should really text small Todoroki.\u201d He grabbed his laptop from his bag and made quick work of hacking into the security cameras in the courtroom before messaging the younger Todoroki. \n\u00a0\n\nUnnamed chat\n\nIzuku Midoriya: good luck with your sperm donor\u2019s case today\nShoto Todoroki: How did you know about that?\nIzuku Midoriya: i have my waysIzuku Midoriya: ill tell you in a few days\nShoto Todoroki: ...OkayShoto Todoroki: Thank you for your support\n\u00a0\nTurning his attention back to his computer screen, he saw that they were still setting up on the other end. Oh wait, they\u2019re live streaming this, I can just watch it on the news\u2026 eh oh well, it\u2019s more fun this way anyway. I just realized how lucky I am that Dad #2 isn\u2019t here right now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi I\u2019m Kageyama Machi, and I\u2019m reporting live from number 2 hero, Endeavor\u2019s trial. Endeavor has been tried many times for many crimes in the past, ranging from property damage to overly using force, but he has always been released uncharged. This time, however, the police are sure that the charges will stick. Why do you think this, detective Tsukauchi?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe camera turns to the detective. Holy shit Dad #2! I knew he would be there but I didn\u2019t think he would be interviewed. I guess that makes sense though, because this is such a big deal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, well, this time, it isn't just one person suing him for one crime. This is a file filled with all the necessary evidence for over 50 crimes, ranging from parking tickets to murder. It\u2019s everything that anyone with a brain could possibly need to put this man in jail.\u201d Tsukauchi looked very proud of himself, and also excited.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow exactly did the police get this information?\u201d The reporter was obviously trying to make Tsukauchi make a mistake, but he already had an answer ready.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, this was all from an informant known as Apparition. And, before you start asking me about them, everything Apparition does if perfectly legal.\u201d Oh, boy, now that\u2019s a lie. Hacking isn\u2019t legal. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get into the courtroom.\u201d The reporter tried to ask a few more questions, but Tsalty wasn\u2019t having any of it. Quickly, Tsuckauchi left the view of the camera.\n\u00a0\nBy now, Midoriya was practically bouncing off the walls. Tsalty mentioned me! And now everyone is going to know that I arrested Endeavor. Oh man that feels so nice to say. Although I guess there is a slight chance he will get free, but I doubt it.\n\u00a0\nA smile on his face, the boy went to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast. The teen opened a few cabinets until he found the one containing the cereal. Wow, there\u2019s actual cereal! Yay! With practiced ease, Midoriya made himself a bowl of cereal, feeling only slightly guilty that he used Tsuckauchi\u2019s milk. After that was done, the kid made his way to infront of the tv. I can\u2019t wait to watch the trial!\n\u00a0\n\u201cWelcome to the third, and maybe last, trial of Endeavor! Now, most of you may know him as the number two hero, but some probably know him best by the damage he has caused over the years. Today, I will be documenting exactly what is happening in this court case.\u201d The shot transfered over to the interview with Dad #2 that Midoriya had already watched. Using this as an opportunity, Midoriya put his bowl in the sink and wandered back in front of the tv.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow, as you heard in the interview, this trial is all because of an informant. And not just any informant, but one that even the police often work with. Which begs the question, who is this anonymous person, and how much have they done for us in the past?\u201d Midoriya smirks, a lot more than you know.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHowever, that is not the topic for this segment, and the real show is about to begin.\u201d The shot changed to one inside the court house, and Midoriya saw that the trail had already begun. Tsuckauchi was standing up and saying what all of the accusations towards Endeavor were, and evidence to support each claim. The defending lawyer attempted to save the case by sharing what Endeavor had done as a hero but she was quickly overrun with the sheer amount of evidence against the man. Then, everything was really settled with a live testimony from the three remaining Todoroki siblings. Izuku found himself grinning at the screen as he watched the gavel come down, proclaiming him guilty and sentencing him to 20 years in jail. \n\nUnnamed Chat\n\nMidoriya Izuku: u did so wellMidoriya Izuku: endickwhore will rot in jail forever\nTodoroki Shoto: Yes, I hope soTodoroki Shoto: I am happy that he\u2019s gone\nMidoriya Izuku: mood\nTodoroki Shoto: ?\nMidoriya Izuku: nvmMidoriya Izuku: also do u want to hang out todayMidoriya Izuku: should b early enough that no 1 knows about ur dad and such\nTodoroki Shoto: Sure. I was actially wondering if you might be interested in visiting Thirteen in the hospital with me and Momo Tomorrow?\nMidoriya Izuku: sounds gud to me, we should ask everyone\nTodoroki Shoto: Okay\n\nTodoroki Shoto is offline\n\n\nMidoriya Izuku is offline\n\n____\nSurprisingly, Todoroki had been able to corral most of the class into coming. And by that, Midoriya meant he had gotten Yaoyorozu to corral most of the class into coming. Thus, a day later, Midoriya was standing with the class (minus Hagakure and Sato who were busy) in the waiting room of the hospital. After around half an hour a nurse emerged. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, class 1-A?\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s us Ma\u2019am!\u201d Kirishima responded for the group.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLovely! If you\u2019re ready you\u2019re free to enter. Keep in mind that they are still recovering though, so don\u2019t be too aggressive please?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course ma\u2019am.\u201d Iida said, waiving his arm around. The group walked in an attempt at a double file line into the waiting room. Thirteen honestly didn\u2019t look that bad anymore, having mostly recovered in the couple of days since the incident. The hero greeted them politely as they walked into the room. The class snickered as Uraraka instantly went in for a hug. \n\u00a0\nIt was less tense than Midoriya had been expecting. Thirteen chatted pleasantly with the (dubbed by the end of the afternoon) Cinnamon Bun Squad: Uraraka, Kirishima, Mina, Izuku, Todoroki, and Momo. The others chose to talk somewhat quietly in their own groups. \n\u00a0\nThey stayed for around an hour before people started to trickle out. Eventually, at around the hour and a half mark, Izuku decided it was time to leave as well. Wow, that was really nice! Okay when I get home I have got to work on a step two for getting spiritually adopted by them. I guess I still forget sometimes that heroes can be amazing after everything with Endickwhore. I wonder if they\u2019ll still like me after the reveal. Izuku looked at the counter on his phone. Only 22 more people to go.\nMineta Minoru, a sad excuse for a person. After his father put Midoriya in a holding cell because of his mom and the green haired boy found out that the younger Mineta was in UA, Midoriya had been watching the creepy student. Sadly, Midoriya\u2019s worries had been confirmed after witnessing multiple attacks by Mineta on female students. That perv. I hate him.\n\u00a0\nAt that moment Present Mic entered the classroom, effectively breaking Midoriya from his thoughts. Oh, it\u2019s time for English already? Huh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I get a HELLO?!\u201d Present Mic screamed as he walked to the black board. Midoriya watched as all of the class (sans Shinso) yelled the greeting back, their pronunciation horrific. Probably got bored of Past Mic\u2019s shenanigans. They do have to live with Dad #3 after all. Seems funny that Aizawa hates loud noises even more than Shinso does but he married the man. \n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, Shinso, let me guess, you\u2019ve already done the work?\u201d Yamada-sensei asked. Once the loud teacher and Nezu realized that Midoriya and his sib from another crib were fluent in English they started to get their homework ahead of time. They were supposed to do all of their after school work during class, but since it was far too easy for them, they just did it when they were bored. That meant that English became a study hall for Shinso and a time for Midoriya to do vigilante stuff, just like he was doing now. It was wonderful for him because it meant that he didn\u2019t have to do his work around Tsukauchi, even if it was moving a bit slower than normal. \n\u00a0\n\u201cYep!\u201d Midoriya replied. Shinso had settled for just a nod.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat! I expect you to give it to me before class is over.\u201d Present Mic turned away from the duo and faced the rest of the class. \u201cNow, who can tell me the time and date is in english?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTuning out the chatter, Midoriya started to think. Oki doki, I think I have enough evidence to put the other Mineta in jail. Yay! Go me! Midoriya grabbed his phone and started to organize all of the clips of videos and even a few statements from his classmates into sections. Midoriya was very surprised at how trusting the general education girls were to a random hero course guy, but what works works. I don\u2019t blame them for trying to get back at that pervy grape motherfucker. Alright, if this isn\u2019t enough then I am not doing my job very well. Time to send it to the dad chat.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chat for Ghosts Who Smile Back\n\nApparition: uw38v!p0\nApparition: tada some info about a perv that should rot in jail\n\u00a0\nHa maybe they should get his dad to arrest him. Nah, I trust Tsukauchi more. And I hate the elder Mineta. Satisfied, Midoriya looked up just in time to see Aizawa barge into the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShou- I mean, Aizawa? What are you doing here?\u201d Present Mic asked as Aizawa stalked towards him. Shinso and Midoriya looked at each other, and both shrugged. I have no idea what\u2019s going on here.\n\u00a0\nWith Yamada still looking confused, Aizawa grabbed a piece of paper and a pen. He then started to write, and whatever he wrote caused Present Mic to gasp. At that exact moment, Midoriya\u2019s phone started to ring, \u2018Show Yourself\u2019 from Frozen 2 blasting from its tiny speakers. Why is Tsalty calling me?\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya, why is your phone interrupting class? If you want or need to answer it, put it on speaker.\u201d Aizawa glared at the young boy and Midoriya frowned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure? I would hate to be annoying to whatever you obviously have to do,\u201d A glare. \u201cOkay, to be fair, you interrupted class first, but sure.\u201d Midoriya clicked accept and put the phone on speaker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Tsuckauchi\u2019s voice filtered through the speakers, and Izuku watched Aizawa\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cyou reached 100,000 arrests. Now, honor your agreement and tell me who you are.\u201d Oh god, was Mineta my 100,000th arrest?! I had no idea! Oops. The class all looked on in pure shock, jaws on the floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTsuckauchi, are you calling Apparition\u2019s phone? Are you sure you got the right number?\u201d Aizawa gathered his thoughts and walked up to Midoriya\u2019s desk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAizawa? What are you doing there? Why are you with Apparition? Better question, who is he?!\u201d Tsuckauchi sounded more and more confused, while Aizawa looked more and more angry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, okay. I can explain.\u201d Midoriya spoke for the first time. Everyone waited in silence, they really wanted to know what he was going to say. Especially the people who had no idea what was going on (most of the class). \u201cSo, yes, I, Midoriya Izuku, am Apparition, and Aizawa had barged into my classroom so that\u2019s why he\u2019s here.\u201d Shinso started to shake with laughter in their seat.\n\u00a0\nIzuku watched smugly as the two men started yelling. \n\u201cYou\u2019re Apparition?!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re a child!!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been living in my house?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my kid\u2019s best friend! Wait, why are they laughing\u2026 Hitoshi you knew?!\u201d \n\u00a0\nAt that point the rest of the class joined in too.\n\u201cHe\u2019s your kid?!\u201d\n\u201c100,000 arrests?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been right under our noses this whole time?!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been hacking into government databases since you were 11!!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been WHAT?!\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re quirkless!\u201d\n\u201cYou were the one that gave the info on Endeavor!\u201d\n\u201cYou turned in my dad?\u201d\n\u201cOh shiiiiit you messed up!\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you so much Izuku, you\u2019re my hero.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt that point Izuku was just watching as everything played out. Todoroki was almost crying and looking at him as if he was Jesus, Hitoshi was on the floor with laughter, Aizawa looked like his brain had exploded and was simply staring at him, mouth open. Tsukauchi was rambling on the phone, Mic had passed out, and the rest of the class was screaming.\n\u00a0\nFinally, Aizawa pressed the end call button on Midoriya\u2019s phone and yelled \u2018quiet\u2019. Once everybody had shut up, Aizawa motioned towards Midoriya and Shinso.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou two, Nezu\u2019s office. Let\u2019s go.\u201d With that, Aizawa left the room. Midoriya slowly followed him, Shinso by his back. Ah, I can feel everyone\u2019s gaze on me. If I had realized Tsalty would call me then I would have waited until after school to send him Mineta\u2019s information. Soon the whole school will know! I made a mistake.\n____\nNezu didn\u2019t even blink when Aizawa slammed open his door. Instead, all he did was begin to speak. \u201cWelcome Aizawa. What can I do for you?\u201d In this moment, Midoriya and Shinso sneaked into the room, both trying to mesh into the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou knew didn\u2019t you.\u201d Aizawa accused. I think Nezu\u2019s going to die. Then me. Shinso will be the only one alive after this is all over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know many things. You\u2019ll have to be more specific.\u201d DON\u2019T ANTAGONIZE THE ANGRY HERO!\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya\u2019s Apparition.\u201d Aizawa spit out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, I see he reached 100,000 arrests then. Congratulations Izuku. Though, I am surprised that he didn\u2019t give it away before now. He did always act very suspicious.\u201d Nezu replied calmly. I feel so offended right now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen why did you decide to keep that from me?\u201d Aizawa demanded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI saw no reason to tell you. Midoriya would tell you eventually, and he has. It all worked out. Plus, some of those arrests would be impossible if I hadn\u2019t taught him some hacking tips.\u201d Nezu sipped a cup of tea that had appeared out of nowhere.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine.\u201d Aizawa finally turned to face the two students. \u201cHitoshi, why did you keep this from me?\u201d Shinso looked torn and worried, so Midoriya stepped in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDadzawa, this isn\u2019t their fault. I think you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d Aizawa\u2019s gaze shifted to him, and it was murderus. \u201cI\u2019m Apparition, surprise. That doesn\u2019t change anything. I, we, are still the same people, you just got an insight that surprised you. Calm down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEraserhead sighed. \u201cI see the resemblance now.\u201d The fire went out of his eyes and his posture got more relaxed. \u201cI suppose you are right, nothing has truly changed. However, if you think that you\u2019ll get special treatment then you have another thing coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Crisis averted. \u201cI know my sibling will get all the doting anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s another one?\u201d Aizawa asked. Midoriya did jazz hands towards Shinso and Aizawa sighed again. \u201cWhy is Hitoshi your sibling?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re our dad!\u201d Dadzawa\u2019s eyes widened and Midoriya grabbed Shinso\u2019s arm. \u201cWell, this has been fun and all, but we have a class to get to. Bye Dad 2, bye Dad 4.\u201d Midoriya rushed out of the room while pulling Shinso behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad 4?\u201d Was heard from the principal\u2019s room before the door shut. Both Shinso and Midoriya started to snicker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I think that went well.\u201d Midoriya commented and Shinso burst into laughter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat was so much better than I thought it would be. I\u2019m so glad I witnessed it. You just talked Dad out of murdering us! I\u2019ve only ever seen my other Dad do that before.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just really glad it worked!\u201d Midoriya stated. \u201cBut I do think that that was comedy gold. I think Tsalty\u2019s in shock though. I mean, he\u2019s been living with Apparition for the past week! Imagine how that must feel.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHa. This was great.\u201d Midoriya and Shinso meandered down the hallway. There were no students there so they just kept talking about everyone\u2019s reactions. Sadly, they forgot about class, but were reminded when the bell rang.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit. We\u2019ve got to run!\u201d Midoriya raced off with Shinso hot on his trail. I really can\u2019t afford to be very late. If I am, I might not be able to stop Dadzawa from killing me.\n____\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did well on Thursday. You guys handled villains well even though it was only your second week at UA.\u201d Aizawa stood at the front of the room, pretending that the reveal hadn\u2019t happened less than 20 minutes ago. Everyone else was doing the same thing, not wanting to get on Aizawa\u2019s bad side. \u201cHowever, your troubles aren\u2019t over.\u201d Good feelings: gone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs class president I feel obligated to ask what you mean by that.\u201d Iida stood up from his chair and waved his arms like a robot.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe sports festival is coming.\u201d I feel like he wanted us to worry. He is so mean sometimes. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHold up,\u201d Shinso started from the back row, \u201cshouldn\u2019t that be cancelled, because of, you know, the villain attack that just happened?\u201d Many students nodded in agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUA, and by UA I mean Nezu, decided that, because of said villain attack, we needed to look stronger than ever. Thus, the sports festival.\u201d Aizawa deadpanned from where he was standing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut what about our safety? If villains can get into USJ who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t get here?!\u201d Ashido spoke up from her seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s a valid question. However, there will be so many heroes there and security has been upped, so it would be stupid for a villain to even try to reak havoc during it.\u201d As Aizawa finished his sentence, the bell rang. \u201cAnd Midoriya, just Midoriya, stay after class please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku froze. Shit what if he\u2019s going to tell me I can\u2019t talk to Hito-chan anymore! Or that I can\u2019t turn in evidence, or that I\u2019m getting booted from the hero program, or I\u2019m arrested, or- \n\u00a0\n\u201c-doriya. Midoriya! Apparition!\u201d That got Izuku\u2019s attention. He looked up to see Aizawa giving him a concerned look from the front of the classroom. \u201cPlease come here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya walked up to the front, dread making his body shake. He refused to meet Eraserhead\u2019s eyes, and so was surprised when arms wrapped around him. Izuku was expecting many things, but getting hugged by the pro hero wasn\u2019t one of them. He shakily wrapped his arms around the teacher. After a few minutes the both pulled away. \n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Izuku said wearily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think?! We\u2019ve been looking for our so- you for so long and suddenly I find out you were here this whole time! And your mother...why didn\u2019t you tell us? We would have helped you! And your old school too! I-.\u201d Izuku was stunned to see the tears in the corners of his \u2018father\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you actually cared\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWh-what?! We\u2019ve been trying to find you for so long why would we if we didn\u2019t care.\u201d What\u2026?\n\u00a0\n\u201c...because I\u2019m a vigilante?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re an informant, and what you do isn\u2019t that illegal, just confusing.\u201d I don\u2019t get it I\u2019m...\n\u00a0\n\u201cI- I\u2019m quirkless.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo why would you care? Quirkless people don\u2019t\u2026\u201d \n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you believe that? Do you honestly believe that all quirkless people don\u2019t deserve to be cared about? To have a home? Or friends?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo of course not!\u201d He\u2019s right\u2026 of course he\u2019s right.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you figured it out, so tell me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t think I deserve it.\u201d The two looked into each other\u2019s eyes. Izuku didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever gotten that look of sincere concern from anyone. But there Aizawa was, breaking through that barrier that Izuku had put up at age 11, finally allowing him to see how he truly felt, caring. \n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course you deserve it. The Apparition I know is someone who worked for four days straight because some woman was being abused, who isn\u2019t afraid to take down the #2 hero, who lived with abusive classmates for years and then went as far as to make sure my child got adopted because they were in need.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd the Izuku I know is the one who got into UA\u2019s hero course quirkless, who saved his teacher and classmates from a villain attack on the spot, who managed to befriend a group who had closed themselves off in fear of being hurt and gave them compassion. You, not just the anonymous Apparition, not just any quirkless person, you, are a hero, and you deserve everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cB-but I-I...\u201d Tears had begun to slide silently down his face. \u201cI don\u2019t g-get it! What do you mean I deserve this! I\u2019m just a waste of space! My mom knew the truth, the kids I grew up with knew it, Endeavor knew it, I\u2019m nothing! You- you can\u2019t just say that!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a waste, kid.\u201d Aizawa looked confused and sad as he watched the kid he\u2019d subconsciously learned to love like a son break down. \u201cThink of all the people you\u2019ve saved. You\u2019ve completed 100,000 arrests for god\u2019s sake! You deserve to be saved just as much as everyone else and I\u2019m so, so sorry we weren\u2019t able to show you that sooner.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe two hugged and stayed that way, crying, for a few minutes before Izuku composed himself. \u201cWe should go back to Tsalty\u2019s house and talk about what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, come on.\u201d The two made their way off school grounds, ignoring the soft, understanding looks of the teachers, and walked in silence. After about 15 minutes they were both sitting comfortably in Tsukauchi\u2019s living room. He was still on the way to join them, having gotten stuck in traffic, but luckily Izuku had a key. I don\u2019t know why this whole thing is so hard to process...I mean I knew it was going to happen obviously, I guess I didn\u2019t realize they actually cared too. It\u2019s still weird to think about...the caring, even after all this time. I mean I knew Tsalty cared about me as Izuku but I dunno, It didn\u2019t click...\n\u00a0\nWhen a somewhat distraught and shaken Tsukauchi entered the room his eyes instantly found Izuku and the boy was wrapped in a tight hug. Here we go again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Oh no, maybe I was wrong. Maybe Aizawa only cared because of Hito-chan and they\u2019re mad at me and it was all fake and he doesn\u2019t want me anymore and they hate me Shit shit what do I do what do I- \u201cIzuku calm down! Hey, hey it\u2019s okay. Shhh, it\u2019s okay, breath with me, that\u2019s it, deep in, deep out, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m not mad at you, I\u2019m just...this is a really big deal and I\u2019m hurt you didn\u2019t tell us about what was going on with you. Me and Aizawa care a lot about you and want you to be safe, and we\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here with us, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-Okay\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I shouldn\u2019t have freaked out like that. I\u2019m just not used to\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not used to having people genuinely care about you, we get it, and it\u2019s okay, whatever your reason for not telling us was it\u2019s okay now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c...I was so scared that you\u2019d find out that I was quirkless and decide you didn\u2019t want to accept info from me, or that you wouldn\u2019t want me around or would leave me like-. Anyway,\u201d He wiped a tear from his cheek, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I was wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re freaking All Might, you save people everyday, literally, and as heroes and police officers it\u2019s our job to turn in criminals, we never would\u2019ve turned you away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAizawa tapped in with a hand on Tsukauchi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAnd we get that it\u2019s hard for you to trust us, of course it is, but try to believe me when I tell you that we love you like our kid, Apparition or Izuku, and we just want you to be safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMidoriya burst into tears and sank into the floor with Tsalty following him down. Aizawa stood on the side and ruffled Midoriya\u2019s hair. This has been the best day ever.\nMidoriya was sitting in his room when his phone started to ring. \n\u00a0\n\u201cHewwo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m outside your house,\u201d Oh, Hito-chan. The call ended. Okay then.\n\u00a0\nMidoriya carefully put his laptop down and moseyed towards the door. Right before he got there, he poked his head into the living room. \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna go hang out with my sib!\u201d Aizawa nodded, and then started sputtering when what Midoriya said caught up with him. The boy laughed. \u201cSee ya Dads!\u201d Gotta love embarrassing your parental figures! It\u2019s so much better in real life!\n\u00a0\nMidoriya opened the door to see Hitoshi standing on the porch. \u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d check in, see how you are,\u201d Shinso lazily replied before hopping down the steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou care! I feel so loved,\u201d Midoriya laughed and jogged until the two UA students were side by side. \u201cI\u2019m doing pretty good. I\u2019ve already replaced all of Tsuckauchi\u2019s window locks with robotic ones.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRobotic window latches?\u201d Shinso asked, looking slightly concerned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep! I got Hatsume Mei to make them for me! All I have to do is log into an app and press a few buttons for them to open with me! It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Midoriya giggled and started to skip besides Shinso. Midoriya then began to speak again after a short pause. \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Shinso answered. The two friends kept walking for about five minutes, Midoriya being totally confused. Then, suddenly, he saw a couple buildings that he recognized. Wait, are we going to-. Trying to get a better idea of where they were, the hacker kept a sharp eye for any other identifying features he recognized. Then, suddenly, he saw a little clump of trees that were very familiar.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAww Hito-chan! This is the park where we met!\u201d Midoriya grinned up at his friend.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...yeah. I felt that everything\u2019s come full circle now. You\u2019re in a better place, I\u2019m in a better place, it just seemed right.\u201d Shinso rubbed their head nervously and smiled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHah, I guess you\u2019re right. You know, this could be qualified as very romantic,\u201d Shinso choked on air. \u201cBut I know you have the hots for pikachu so..\u201d Midoriya squaked and ducked as Shinso tried to whack the boy on the head. \u201cAlright, alright. Still, thanks. I honestly forgot this place existed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d They kept walking in silence until Midoriya spotted a few familiar people behind a few trees.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHito-chan, why are some of our classmates here?\u201d Midoriya questioned, making eye contact with Todoroki.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI invited them. I felt that it would be a fun get together.\u201d Shinso replied, looking sheepish.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAww!\u201d Midoriya launched himself and hugged his friend. \u201cYou are soooo sweet!\u201d Then he spotted Kaminari. \u201cWait, did you just do this as an excuse to talk to Kaminari without asking him out.\u201d Shinso\u2019s face turned red.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNO! I was just trying to be nice to you. Shut up.\u201d Midoriya snickered. Finally, the two \u2018siblings\u2019 entered the open field where their friends were waiting for them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello Shinso, Midoriya.\u201d Todoroki greeted from where he was sprawled out on the grass.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi Todoroki!\u201d Midoriya chirped. When the group heard Midoriya\u2019s voice, they made their way over to where he was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya! Shinso! Glad you could come!\u201d Yaoyorozu smiled and hugged the smaller of the two.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI literally put this all together. Why wouldn\u2019t I be here?\u201d Shinso spoke up and Momo blushed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOops.\u201d The group, except for Todoroki, laughed and most joined the before mentioned student on the ground. Momo had already took it upon herself to produce a bunch of soft picnic blankets, and the weather was beautiful. All in all, life felt pretty good.\n____\n\u201cWait is that who...OMG Hito-chan look look look!\u201d Shinso gave him a confused look as he pointed to a couple on a bench.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Am I supposed to know who that is?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh right you haven\u2019t met! Hang on.\u201d The group of friends watched as Izuku stood up and started waving. \u201cHEY, VIPER, OVER HERE! HI!\u201d Midoriya shouted and someone on the bench he had pointed to looked up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, is that who I think it is? HEY ABUSIVE MOM KID!! IT\u2019S BEEN A WHILE!\u201d Viper shouted back and stood up. He motioned for his friend? girlfriend? to stand up and they quickly made their way towards Midoriya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait WHAT?!\u201d\n\u201cIs he talking to you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does he mean by that?!\u201d\n\u201cIs everything okay??\u201d\n\u00a0\nBoth Viper and Izuku realized their mistake and winced a little. Midoriya made quick work of settling the group though. \u201cGuys calm down, everything is fine! This is the...friend of mine that was at the USJ, the one from my time in holding! We met right before my mom was arrested for being the worst, and kinda never formally introduced ourselves I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait, he was at the USJ? But only villains were at the USJ.\u201d Todoroki commented. Viper and Midoriya flinched again, but both decided to ignore the question.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I should probably introduce myself. I\u2019m Hiro Natto, reformed villain, and this is my girlfriend Tamasi Rena.\u201d He held out a hand to Izuku who gladly took it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya Izuku, although you may know me as the hero Apparition.\u201d Midoriya added the last part quietly, remembering how he was the one that put Viper in prison in the first place.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...That was you?! Oh man! How did I not see that coming? That\u2019s like anime tropes 101! I gotta say though, while you did put me in jail you\u2019re also the reason my life got turned around, so...thanks for that. I wouldn\u2019t be here without you, and I never would have met Rena.\u201d Viper smiled sappily at his girlfriend and she smiled back. Then Hiro paused. \u201cJust checking, you\u2019re not like, in the foster system are you?\u201d Izuku laughed at Shinso\u2019s groan.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, but I do have a sixth dad slot if you want it?\u201d The rest of the group looked very confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...haha yeah man! You got it!\u201d Viper looked around and saw that everyone else in the group looked left out. \u201cWell, we should probably go. See you around!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll text you!\u201d Midoriya waved and the two walked away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou have an interesting group of acquaintances.\u201d Kaminari said. The rest of the group nodded in agreement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeh, yeah.\u201d Midoriya laughed sheepishly and flopped on the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you meet him as Apparition?\u201d Todoroki asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I put him in jail for a bit.\u201d Midoriya answered while staring at the sky.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re Apparition.\u201d Tokoyami mentioned. \u201cI heard about you in the Endeavor trial. It\u2019s insane that you put that terrible hero behind bars. No offense Todoroki.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d Todoroki replied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you have no idea the amount of good Midoriya has done. He\u2019s even helped me.\u201d Shinso commented.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow. You\u2019re amazing Midoriya!\u201d Yaoyorozu spoke up and Izuku blushed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Midoriya smiled and the rest of the group did the same.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey Izuku?...I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Izuku watched as Hitoshi got up and went over to where Kaminari was sitting before saying something and leading him away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOOOOOOOOO! Rrrrrrromance~!\u201d Midoriya shouted, earning some snickers and a very flustered \u2018fuck off!\u2019.\n____\nThe day went pretty calmly after that. There was lots of story sharing; such as Hitoshi puppy-dog-eyes-ing Aizawa into adopting six more cats, Kaminari asking Hitoshi out and them finally getting together, Todoroki living with his sister, and many more. Finally, the sky turned dark and the group had to split ways.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, did you enjoy yourself?\u201d Shinso asked, sounding pretty pleased.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I really did.\u201d You know...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this happy."
