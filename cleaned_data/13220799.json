    "notes": "<p>Bucky's characterization is based off that in Owlet's series called Infinite Coffee and Protection Detail, which I'd highly recommend reading if you haven't already.

However, one reader informed me that Japan actually made moves to surrender before the US bombed them, but that the US bombed them anyway, potentially just to test out their bombs and show their power. That being said, another reader informed me that unconditional surrender seemed unlikely on Japan's part, especially since Japan didn't make an offer to surrender after the first bomb. The various sources I've looked at tend to contradict each other, but just keep in mind that history is far more complicated than it's portrayed in the history books\u2014the bombing of Japan is clearly far less black and white than we think it is. It's realistic for Peter not to know any of this, given what we get in history classes here in the US, but I reworded that line so as not to spread misinformation either way.</p>\n<p>Bucky's character is heavily influenced by that in Owlet's series Infinite Coffee and Protection Detail.

    "text": "Peter flopped from his desk chair onto the floor, burying his face in a dirty shirt before realizing how disgusting it smelled and rolling away from it.\n\u201cYou appear to be in mild distress, Mr. Parker. Should I call Mr. Stark?\u201d\nPeter flailed. \u201cNo! No, I\u2019m fine. Thanks though, JARVIS.\u201d\n\u201cIs it accurate to presume that the primary stressor is your history test tomorrow?\u201d\nPeter lifted his head and looked suspiciously at the ceiling. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cContrived from your emotional state, I have calculated that the chance of your test being tomorrow is high, and that it is exceptionally likely your test is for your history class, based on the available content.\u201d\n\u201c... Available content?\u201d\n\u201cThe papers on your desk cover material on the second World War, Mr. Parker.\u201d\nPeter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m screwed. I can\u2019t remember any of the dates or the names of the battles or the leaders and there\u2019s too many countries\u2026 I should\u2019ve paid attention in class, but I was tired\u2026 I didn\u2019t get enough sleep. What even is sleep? I should be fine. I just have to remember stuff. Why are there so many countries in the war?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a World War, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter buried his face in his arms. \u201cUrgh.\u201d\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\nPeter sat bolt upright to find Steve in his doorway. \u201cH- Wh- What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cJARVIS said you needed help,\u201d Steve said, looking a mix of worried and bemused. \u201cAre you okay? Why are you on the floor?\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding me? Not cool, JARVIS! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter crossed his arms indignantly.\n\u201cThere is a high probability that my actions will lead to an improved outcome, based on Mr. Rogers\u2019s knowledge of World War II and your unwillingness to ask for help,\u201d JARVIS told him. Peter watched as Steve ambled over to his desk, scanning through the papers. Peter\u2019s eye twitched a little, and he glared at the ceiling.\n\u201cI can help with this stuff. What are you having trouble with?\u201d Steve asked, stepping forward and offering Peter a hand. Peter chewed on his lip before ceding with an exhale and letting Steve help him up.\n\u201cI get the basics, I just can\u2019t keep track of the dates. And who started what, where, and why.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIs memorizing things usually difficult for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Peter, slightly frustrated. \u201cIt just won\u2019t stick. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\nSteve put a hand to Peter\u2019s forehead, and Peter jumped.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\u201cMaking sure you\u2019re not sick,\u201d Steve said lightly. \u201cThat can make memorization difficult.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d Peter sounded a bit defensive. He stepped forward and started shuffling through his papers.\n\u201cHave you slept enough?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Steve. I just need to pass the damn test.\u201d Peter rubbed his forehead. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry. That was rude.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Steve reached out and gripped his shoulder, steering him towards his bed. Peter didn\u2019t register the fact that he\u2019d moved until he found himself lying down; Steve was pulling blankets over him. \n\u201cWhat- Steve, I have to study!\u201d Peter tried to get up, only to be pushed back down by Steve. \n\u201cTo study, you need to be well-rested. Take a nap, eat dinner, then I\u2019ll help you study.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit on you,\u201d Steve threatened, looking half-serious. \u201cSleep, Peter.\u201d\nPeter yawned in spite of himself, then frowned. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t stop me, y\u2019know.\u201d\nSteve raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m pretty heavy.\u201d\n\u201cI lifted part of a building.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s face went hard and soft at the same time. He didn\u2019t reply, just tucked the blankets under Peter\u2019s chin and straightened up, an unreadable expression on his face through Peter\u2019s droopy eyes. He headed for the door, and Peter\u2019s eyes fell shut. He was asleep before Steve had left the room.\n----\n\u201cPeter. Wake up, kid.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was uncharacteristically gentle as Peter blinked himself into a state of relative consciousness. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d He sat up, scrubbing at his eyes. \u201cWha\u2019 time is it?\u201d\n\u201cSix thirty. Time for dinner. You feeling alright?\u201d\n\u201cFeeling- yeah! I feel fine.\u201d Peter scrambled to his feet, nearly tripping over his blankets. He straightened his rumpled clothes and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cGrilled cheese. The fancy kind that Barnes makes.\u201d\n\u201cMm. I\u2019m starving.\u201d Peter made for the door, but Tony grabbed the back of his shirt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter said, slightly confused. \u201cI\u2019m not sick or anything, I was just a little tired.\u201d\nTony released him. \u201cAlright, kid. Let\u2019s get you fed.\u201d\nThey headed out to the elevator; almost everyone was already in the dining room when they arrived. \n\u201cThere\u2019s the baby,\u201d Clint said, messing with Peter\u2019s hair as he sat down.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a baby,\u201d Peter grumbled, but it held no heat. He piled grilled cheese sandwiches onto his plate and dug in, his mouth bulging with huge bites. \u201cGod, theth are delithiouth.\u201d\n\u201cConfirm,\u201d said Natasha, and her eyes twinkled as Bucky glared at her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cConfirm,\u201d Clint said. Bucky huffed and took a bite of his sandwich. \n\u201cThankth for the grilled cheethe,\u201d said Peter, his mouth stuffed. A hint of amusement flashed across Bucky\u2019s face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full,\u201d Pepper reprimanded. Peter ducked his head.\n\u201cThorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou let me talk with my mouth full,\u201d Clint said. \u201cI\u2019m offended on Peter\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Clint.\u201d Peter grinned. Pepper rolled her eyes.\n\u201cClint, I\u2019d have send you to etiquette class years ago if I had any control over you.\u201d\n\u201cYou could blackmail him,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThat might work.\u201d\nPepper brightened. \u201cAnybody know his deepest, darkest secrets? Natasha?\u201d\n\u201cI know a few,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cThe first being that he still has his-\u201d\n\u201cNat!\u201d Clint squeaked. \u201cYou promised not to tell!\u201d\n\u201cWill you go to etiquette class?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cHe still had his te-\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d Clint said, throwing his hands up. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to etiquette class. But that was cruel.\u201d\n\u201cConfirm,\u201d Natasha said, throwing a glance at Bucky, who planted his face on the table with a thud.\n\u201cStop teasing him,\u201d Steve scolded. \u201cIf you tease him, he\u2019ll never make any of you grilled cheese or cookies again.\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s a threat. Wow,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAll of you shut up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky lifted his head and smirked faintly before taking another bite of sandwich. Peter finished his food in record time and reached for seconds, but none were left. Nobody seemed to have noticed his aborted movement, yet he found half a sandwich on his plate when he looked down after listening to Clint and Steve argue over country music. He scrunched his eyebrows, and he found Bucky watching him when he glanced back up. Bucky gestured for him to eat. Peter opened his mouth to argue, but Bucky fixed him with a terrifying glare and he quickly dropped his eyes, taking a bite of the half-sandwich. When he looked up a second time, Bucky was gone. Peter sat in confusion for a few moments before tuning in to the conversation, which consisted of Tony aggressively insisting that Clint\u2019s taste in music was trash and should never be trusted. This lasted five minutes before Clint argued that at least his taste in clothing was better than Tony\u2019s; Tony firmly disagreed. After five minutes of that, they moved on to teasing Steve about his old suit and how he looked like a floppy baby penguin, at which point Peter heard something drop onto his plate. He jumped, surprised to find two more grilled cheeses in front of him.\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d Bucky said almost inaudibly. \u201cCareful. Those are hot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said. \u201cDid you just make these? You really didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBucky shrugged. \u201cForgot you eat as much as Steve.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t have to. I was mostly full. I\u2019m sorry you had to do extra-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI like to cook,\u201d Bucky grunted. \u201cNo hardship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBucky nodded. Peter wolfed down his new sandwiches, then took his plate to the kitchen. Steve followed.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFeeling better?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter admitted. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of yourself, kid. Get enough sleep and all that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Peter looked at the ground, shuffling his feet. Steve clapped a hand on his back.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReady to study?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReady.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan we start with dates?\u201d Peter asked.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Steve said. \u201cWhen did World War II begin?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201c1939. Um\u2026 September 1st?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Peter asked, slightly hesitant.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a whole lot of not knowing what would happen next. I don\u2019t think anyone really expected it. I mean, there was the threat of war, but nobody thought \u2018oh, this is the start of a world war.\u2019 It was just gradual, until it wasn\u2019t. People getting called to fight. War being the sole focus. Rations, fear, Pearl Harbor\u2026\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cSpeaking of which, when was Pearl Harbor?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201c1941. December\u2026\u201d Peter chewed his lip. \u201cDecember\u2026 Early December.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe seventh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDecember seventh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSteve gave him a soft smile. \u201cHow about the Battle of Midway?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was in 1942. In June, I think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight. Why was it important?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of the Japanese aircraft carriers got destroyed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSteve nodded. \u201cAnd what do you know about the battle of Kursk?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt happened in 1943. It was an air strike? With the Russians against the Germans?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlmost. It was a tank battle, but there were forces in the air as well. It\u2019s considered one of the greatest tank battles of the war.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou were close,\u201d Steve said. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. You\u2019re doing well. What happened on June 6, 1944?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter looked up. \u201cD-day, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Allies invaded France. They took back Paris a couple months later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd what happened at the Battle of the Bulge?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Germans staged an attack and lost.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood. What army crossed the Rhine in 1945?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe US Third Army. Under General Patton.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd what happened next?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHitler committed suicide. The Germans surrendered. The US bombed Japan. The war ended.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter nodded. \u201cCan we review it one more time?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSure. When did the war start?\u201d\n\n\nPeter didn\u2019t mean to procrastinate, he really didn\u2019t. They\u2019d been given two weeks to read Fahrenheit 451, and he\u2019d intended to get it done in the first week, but he kept pushing it back and pushing it back until it was the last night and they had an in-class essay to write on it the next morning. A plethora of choice words streamed through his head, and he chose three of the best to mutter under his breath. He was going to need coffee for this. He grabbed the book and hurried up to the kitchen, crossing his fingers that nobody was there at midnight. He was in luck. \nHe tried to make coffee as quietly as possible, wishing he could web the coffee maker and dangle it out the window as it gurgled and poured. He mixed in an appropriate amount of sugar and cream, then sat down on a bar stool and began to read under the dim lights, coffee clutched tightly in hand. It lasted him through the first thirty pages, and he got up to make another. His eyes burned from exhaustion. He hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep the night before, and had been planning on making it up. Plan foiled. \nHe took a sip of the coffee and sat back down, gluing his eyes to the page and reading until he ran out of coffee again. He set his book down and just about jumped out of his skin when he saw Bucky watching him from the doorway. He clutched his chest, breathing hard. Bucky tilted his head.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice me.\u201d\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter squeaked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re usually more aware of your surroundings.\u201d\n\u201cI was focused.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. You should be in bed.\u201d\n\u201cSo should you,\u201d Peter shot back, plopping his mug under the coffee maker.\nBucky shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t have school tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI have to read this book for tomorrow. If I don\u2019t read it, I\u2019ll get a zero on the in-class essay.\u201d\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve done it earlier,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Peter hissed. Then, more resigned, \u201cI know.\u201d\nBucky watched as Peter picked up his fresh coffee and took a long gulp, wincing at the sharp taste. He returned to his seat, resting his head on his arm for a moment before sitting up straight and picking up the book. Bucky made his way into the kitchen and began shuffling through the cupboards, pulling out ingredients and setting them on the counter. Peter turned around when he started cracking eggs.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\u201cMaking cookies.\u201d\nPeter raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSo you can eat them.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m making cookies to throw out the window.\u201d\nPeter stared at him for a moment before huffing out a laugh. \u201cI thought you were serious.\u201d\n\u201cGet back to work. Maybe I am serious.\u201d\nPeter snapped back around in his seat and continued to read. God, he wanted cookies. His stomach rumbled. A small bowl of chocolate chips was placed in front of him, and he poured them into his mouth like he hadn\u2019t eaten in a week. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d he sighed.\n\u201cFocus,\u201d Bucky replied. Peter took a sip of coffee and stared determinedly at page 63. He reread the first paragraph five times without absorbing any of it before dropping the book and rubbing aggressively at his eyes.\n\u201cMy brain hurts.\u201d\n\u201cBook boring?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m too tired. Have you read it?\u201d\nBucky shook his head. \u201cIt was past my time. Haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet these days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t decided. Read All My Sons by Arthur Miller earlier. Thought it was interesting.\u201d Bucky squinted at him. \u201cGet back to work. You procrastinate, you face the consequences.\u201d\nPeter exhaled. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Bucky said, suddenly softer. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nPeter picked up the book and forced himself to read, guzzling his coffee like it was his lifeblood. When he ran out, Bucky snatched the mug away and placed it in the sink.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cCookies in five minutes. You\u2019ll live.\u201d\nPeter massaged his temples and looked back to the swimming words. He pushed through to page 85 before he heard to oven open and abandoned the book again.\n\u201cKeep reading,\u201d Bucky said, and he groaned, reaching for the cookies. \u201cThey\u2019re too hot.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cWrong answer. Keep reading.\u201d\nPeter definitely didn\u2019t whimper. He felt a hand ghost across his back and slouched forward, exhausted.\n\u201cKeep pushing,\u201d Bucky said quietly. \u201cCookies in a minute.\u201d\nPeter propped himself up with his elbow and turned the page. \u201cI should\u2019ve just read the SparkNotes summary.\u201d\n\u201cBuilding. Define spark-notes,\u201d said Bucky.\n\u201cSparkNotes is a resource intended to assist readers with concise summaries of books. It is not a replacement for the text itself,\u201d JARVIS said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d Peter muttered. He let the book fall out of his hands when Bucky placed a plate of cookies in front of him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\nBucky watched as Peter gobbled down cookie after cookie, only looking up after he\u2019d eaten almost all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCrap. Did you want some?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter pushed the plate over, and Bucky took a cookie. Peter inhaled the last few and brought the plate to the sink, teetering a bit as he walked.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGo lay down and read,\u201d Bucky told him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI might fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nPeter didn\u2019t. Bucky was very talented at pinching toes. Every time Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered, a decent amount of pressure was applied to his big toe, and he squeaked appropriately. Bucky seemed to be a toe-pinching veteran; Peter didn\u2019t have the nerve to ask why. He was pretty sure that the vast majority of Bucky\u2019s past was miserable. Regardless, he kept his focus well enough and only had twenty pages to go by two in the morning. His vision was blurry, and he had to squint to process the words in front of him. His eyelids drooped, and Bucky gave his toe a firm pinch from his seat at the end of the couch.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re almost done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter rubbed his eyes and forced them to focus. The last half of an hour felt like torture, and he threw the book on the floor when he finally finished. Bucky gave his toe a rewarding pat. Peter tried to get up, but his head spun and he sat back down with a thump. The couch was so comfy\u2026 he could sleep on it, right? He was ninety-nine percent sure that he was dreaming when he felt a metal arm under his knees and a flesh one under his back scooping him up, his head lolling to rest on a well-muscled shoulder as he was carried to the elevator.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nPeter awoke blearily to his alarm less than four hours later. He squinted around, expecting to see the living room; he was surprised to find himself in his own bed, the covers wrapped warmly around him. He closed his eyes for just a moment before forcing himself out of bed, pulling on clean clothes and heading to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth, used the toilet, and splashed water on his face, wiping it off with a towel. He fixed his hair, cringing at the bags under his eyes upon studying himself in the mirror. Satisfied enough, he hurried up to grab breakfast before he had to leave for school. To his surprise, Bucky was standing in front of the stove, flipping pancakes. Nobody was usually up so early, except for Pepper, but she was always busy. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Bucky grunted without turning around. \u201cYour plate\u2019s on the table.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said, surprised. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI told you last night, kid, I like to cook. Eat the damn food.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter plopped down in his seat, shoveling the pancakes into his mouth, barely pausing to pour syrup on them. \u201cMmm.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nBucky set another plate down next to him as he gulped down his last bite.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAre these for me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re for building.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSergeant Barnes is only joking, Mr. Parker,\u201d JARVIS said. \u201cThough I would delight in a stack of pancakes if I could eat them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re for me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re for you.\u201d Bucky rolled his eyes and simultaneously looked fond. It was an odd expression to see, especially on Bucky. Peter didn\u2019t think too much on it though, instead deciding to inhale the second plate of pancakes. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said when he finished. \u201cI usually just have cereal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou worked hard last night,\u201d Bucky told him. \u201cHard work means reward. Keep that in mind today.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter nodded, stacking his empty plates and placing them in the sink. He scooped up his bag and headed for the elevator.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Bucky. Seeya later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Bucky said, inclining his head.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nBy lunchtime, Peter was definitely suffering. He was relieved to have gotten the essay out of the way; he did better than he thought he would, but he felt like he was going to fall asleep at any moment. His eyes were burning and his head felt heavy on his shoulders. He didn\u2019t want to go to gym at all next block. Or see Flash. He ran his fingers through his hair, then forced himself to sit upright so he didn\u2019t faceplant in his half-eaten nachos. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Peter jerked his head up to find the principal\u2019s secretary standing behind him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Ned said. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d the secretary squinted at him, somewhat suspicious now.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019re about to give him detention for?\u201d Ned sounded unsure.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving him detention,\u201d the secretary huffed. \u201cThough maybe I should give you one. Peter, someone\u2019s here to take you to a doctor\u2019s appointment. He said you forgot about it. He\u2019s very menacing and I\u2019d suggest that you get moving.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d Peter said dumbly.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the secretary replied, impatient. She flapped her hands, and Peter stood up, swaying a bit before he steadied himself and picked up his backpack. He tossed the remains of his lunch in the trash on his way out of the cafeteria, giving Ned and MJ a small wave. When he got the the main office, the last person he expected to see was standing by the door.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBucky? What-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re late,\u201d Bucky said briskly. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHe steered Peter through the front doors and down the steps onto the sidewalk, slowing his pace as they retreated from the school.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow come-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHard work means reward. You read the book, you wrote the essay. Now you get to go home.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou- How- What? I don\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would you have a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter said weakly. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBucky shrugged. \u201cYou just had gym and a study hall left. We have motivational Steve at home. No need for gym class version.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter snorted. \u201cThose videos are ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey really play them in your school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Peter groaned. Bucky\u2019s lips twitched. He watched as Peter yawned, almost tripping over a crack in the sidewalk. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou look terrible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou kinda do too. How much sleep did you even get?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo point three hours.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow? How are you functioning? I feel like death.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to functioning on little to no sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter tilted his head, studying Bucky, who shoved his hands deeper in his pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t seem dizzy or tired at all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUsed to it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time you slept enough?\u201d Peter asked, curious now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith or without sedatives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBoth?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlmost got cut in half last year. Required heavy sedatives to undergo medical treatment and recover. Without sedatives\u2026 a long time.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice cracked slightly. Peter stared at him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 That sucks, man. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter yawned again, scrunching up his face. He stumbled, and Bucky caught him by the handle on his backpack and pulled him back upright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Bucky said. Sure enough, the entrance to the tower was just a block away, and Peter wanted to collapse when they finally entered the lobby. He dragged himself into the elevator and leaned against the wall, closing his eyes as they shot upwards. When he opened them, Bucky was shepherding him out of the elevator and into his room. He dropped his backpack and flopped onto his bed; Bucky tucked the covers neatly beneath his chin and stepped back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you cookies when you wake up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony said, waiting until Peter had a mouthful of potatoes. \u201cI got a call from your school today.\u201d\nPeter almost choked. Clint thumped his back sympathetically as he coughed. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d he wheezed, his eyes watering. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten detention this month.\u201d\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d Steve said, smiling. Pepper frowned.\n\u201cNo. Well, yes, but he shouldn\u2019t ever be getting detention.\u201d\n\u201cYour standards are too high,\u201d said Clint. Pepper flicked his ear, and he yelped.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThey were wondering why we haven\u2019t signed up for any parent-teacher conferences.\u201d\n\u201cConferences?\u201d Natasha suddenly looked interested. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go!\u201d Clint said.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go,\u201d said Steve. \n\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Tony crossed his arms. Peter hid behind his hands.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Steve prompted.\n\u201cI knew this would happen,\u201d Peter mumbled.\n\u201cSo you conveniently forgot to tell us?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026 Maybe.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d Peter fixed his gaze firmly on his potatoes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want them to embarrass you,\u201d Bucky said. Peter\u2019s silence was his downfall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not embarrassing!\u201d Clint exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re super cool!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be embarrassed by Clint too,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not going, so you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m totally-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cTony and Steve are going, because even though Natasha and Bucky would do a better job, Tony and Steve are insufferable idiots who can\u2019t stand the thought of missing out on something fairly trivial in the scheme of things.\u201d\n\u201cConferences aren\u2019t trivial!\u201d Tony argued. \u201cThey\u2019re very important. Peter agrees.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t form Peter\u2019s opinions for him,\u201d Pepper scolded. \u201cHe\u2019s at an impressionable age.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not impressionable,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cYes you are,\u201d everyone chorused.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cJust\u2026 don\u2019t go all\u2026 y\u2019know.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll behave,\u201d Steve promised. Tony held up his hands.\n\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth, Steve.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s at an impressionable age,\u201d Clint said. Tony sulked as everyone laughed at him.\n\u201cWhatever. I scheduled conferences with your chemistry teacher and your history teacher for tomorrow afternoon. You\u2019d better patch up your selective memory, kid.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Tony.\u201d\nTony waved the apology away. \u201cTell us next time.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n----\nThe next day, after chemistry class, Peter\u2019s teacher pulled him aside. \n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you wasting my time with practical jokes, Mr. Parker.\u201d\nPeter stared at him, confused.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit in an empty classroom after school today and wait for Tony Stark and Steve Rogers to show up for a conference. I don\u2019t fall for things like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cNice try, Mr. Parker. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t be sending an email to your parents about this.\u201d\nPeter opened his mouth to argue, then closed it. There was no point. He shrugged, making for the door.\n\u201cThere are better ways to get attention,\u201d the teacher told him as he left. He gritted his teeth, shoving his hands in his pockets as he headed for his English class.\n----\nWhen he got back to the tower, he was surprised to find Natasha, Bucky, Pepper, and Clint waiting outside when he stepped out of the elevator into the hall. His eyebrows pinched together, and he blinked.\n\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Clint said cheerfully, fluffing his hair.\n\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a party in your room.\u201d\nPeter was arrantly confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Pepper said, her smile slightly impish. Peter rarely saw the look on her; she was usually the responsible one. It made him increasingly curious.\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Natasha, waving everyone toward Peter\u2019s room. Peter opened the door, letting everyone in. Clint flopped onto the bed, Pepper took the desk chair, and Natasha sat cross-legged on the carpet. Bucky scanned the room, then lowered himself into a bean bag in the corner. Peter plopped down on the fluffy carpet, tossing his backpack aside. \n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\n\u201cHaving a party!\u201d Clint repeated.\n\u201cWhat kind of party?\u201d asked Peter.\n\u201cA listening party,\u201d Natasha said airily.\n\u201cSo\u2026 music?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d Clint grinned. \u201cIs it almost time?\u201d\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Pepper said. \n\u201cWe could turn it on early,\u201d said Natasha, glancing at Bucky, who nodded. He pulled out his phone, tapping at it until Steve\u2019s voice filtered clearly into the room.\n\u201c... is ridiculous, we\u2019ve passed these lockers already!\u201d\n\u201cAll the lockers look the same,\u201d came Tony\u2019s voice. \u201cThey\u2019re probably different ones.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re the same! We must not have seen it. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cWe can ask the secretary for help,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for help. It can\u2019t be that hard to find a fucking classroom.\u201d\n\u201cIt is that hard! See, that\u2019s the gym! There\u2019s the entrance! We\u2019ve made a big loop!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a different gym,\u201d Tony huffed. Peter covered a snort. Everyone looked extremely amused.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late if we don\u2019t ask! We can\u2019t be late to the conference!\u201d Steve was probably wringing his hands. Tony made a sound of annoyance.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCalm down, Steve. We\u2019ll find the damn room.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSteve muttered something unhappily, and the two men fell into silence.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow is it doing this?\u201d Peter asked, gesturing to Bucky\u2019s phone.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBugged,\u201d Bucky answered.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou bugged Steve? How?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard. Just stuck it on his clothing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give Peter any ideas,\u201d Pepper said. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bug any of you,\u201d said Peter. \u201cProbably. I mean, unless I had a good reason for it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nClint laughed, but cut himself off when Tony\u2019s voice came through the phone\u2019s speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFound it! Room 162. Suck it, Rogers!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a school!\u201d Steve hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere was a faint squeaking noise that sounded like a door; the two of them presumably filed inside.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming we\u2019re in the right place and you\u2019re Peter\u2019s chemistry teacher?\u201d said Tony. The teacher didn\u2019t reply, and Clint grinned.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI bet he\u2019s speechless,\u201d he mouthed. Natasha looked pleased.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cH- Y-yes, I\u2019m\u2026 You\u2019re Tony Stark! And Captain America!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Steve said pleasantly. \u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMichael Hayes\u2026 It\u2019s- What a surprise\u2026 I-\u201d Mr. Hayes faltered, stumbling over his words before evidently composing himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. Please, sit down.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nPeter snickered a bit, and Pepper clasped her hands together in amusement. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf only we had cameras,\u201d Clint whispered.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d given me more time\u2026\u201d muttered Bucky. \u201cA few more hours\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNext time,\u201d Natasha said. Peter\u2019s face lit up.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNext time? There\u2019s gonna be a next time?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMore likely than not,\u201d Clint told him.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c...can talk about Peter\u2019s academic performance,\u201d Mr. Hayes was saying. \u201cOverall, as you can see, he scores well on his tests but, his grade isn\u2019t as high as it could be. He misses homework assignments as often as once a week, and his focus in class had been lacking. His participation-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bored,\u201d Tony interrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTony!\u201d hissed Steve.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? He is! The kid\u2019s brilliant, I don\u2019t blame him for not paying attention. Lemme see those tests\u2026 Look at this, Steve! Redox reactions? He could do this in his sleep!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTony!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth, Steve! If you want Peter to pay attention, you have to challenge him. Why isn\u2019t he in AP Chemistry?\u201d\n\n\n\n\nClint clapped his hands together, trying not to laugh. Peter\u2019s cheeks were pink.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is AP Chemistry, Mr. Stark. I think that as a\u2026 guardian, you see Peter in a different light than some of his teachers do. In my opinion, he hasn\u2019t displayed much-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe passes his tests, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Tony, sounding furious.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe does. His scores are exceptionally high,\u201d Mr. Hayes admitted. \u201cBut that could be because-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter does well on tests because he\u2019s an extremely intelligent young man,\u201d Steve said, his voice low. \u201cSorry, but for a moment there it sounded like you were implying that he\u2019s been cheating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking that, are you?\u201d Tony asked, aggravation bleeding though his polite facade. \u201cYou seemed very reasonable when we sat down.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026 I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s no cheating going on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page. Anything else you need to tell us about?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cN-no. Not that I can think of.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI really appreciate you taking the time to meet with us,\u201d Steve said, his voice slightly gritted but even. \u201cI\u2019m glad we cleared things up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it was good to-\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThere was a loud screeching sound, and everyone winced. It sounded like a chair being pushed back. Steve sighed.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHave a nice evening,\u201d he told Mr. Hayes. The door creaked, and as soon as it clicked, Steve started on Tony. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible! At least pretend to be nice! You can\u2019t just interrupt the man-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou did it too,\u201d Tony shot back. \u201cHe was a dickwad, I\u2019m not going to act like that\u2019s okay. Can you believe his nerve? He said-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI heard him. But Tony, you have to-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to do shit! I didn\u2019t like his implications, that man deserved-\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSee? You can\u2019t say things like that! We\u2019re in a school!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, Steve! I won\u2019t have him talking about Peter like that!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSteve took a sharp breath, but didn\u2019t speak. His exhale ruffled the microphone, and the sound of his heavy footsteps echoing in the hall died off.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got another meeting, c\u2019mon,\u201d Tony said, his voice quieter from the distance that had increased between him and Steve. Peter held his breath.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Steve muttered. \u201cI just\u2026 I was as pissed as you were.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Peter puts up with him every day,\u201d Tony replied after a moment.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve huffed out an empty laugh. \u201cJesus. Sorry. Cheating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSchool is bullshit,\u201d Tony said. \u201cC\u2019mon. We\u2019ve got places to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe footsteps picked back up, and Peter breathed again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would\u2019ve been so much better, Barnes,\u201d Natasha sighed. \u201cWe should go to the next one. Tie up the losers so they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky shook his head. \u201cGoes against mission protocols.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky looked at Natasha like she was stupid. \u201cMission, protect. Tying up Steve would likely harm more than protect.\u201d He paused. \u201cThough I\u2019ve wanted to. He\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll agree with you on that,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cClint, would you tie up Tony and Steve with me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWould I get to go to the conference?\u201d asked Clint, his eyes twinkling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen no. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha frowned, then looked up. \u201cPepper?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a no,\u201d said Natasha. She seemed pleased. Pepper shifted her eyes over to Peter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEnjoying yourself?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter nodded, his eyes slightly wide. \u201cDo you guys do this often?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. Well, not anymore, in Bucky\u2019s case. He used to have most of Steve\u2019s clothes bugged.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky shrugged. \u201cMission is protect. Pre-contact, I used bugs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPre-contact?\u201d Peter repeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBucky was a creepy stalker,\u201d said Clint, smirking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUnlike most stalkers, he had good intentions,\u201d Natasha replied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPepper hushed them; Steve had started talking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c... Rogers, nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2026 it is an honor, Captain Rogers\u2026 Really, I\u2026 And Mr. Stark, I can\u2019t believe\u2026 It\u2019s really such a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChairs scraped the floor; Peter guessed that they were sitting down. There was a faint rustling noise that sounded like paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are Peter\u2019s unit tests and major writing assignments from the year so far. He\u2019s in the A to B range, which is perfectly acceptable. He generally meets expectations and has exceeded some. He does seem to have trouble paying attention sometimes, but his grade doesn\u2019t generally suffer for it. I\u2019ve noticed that he has an impressive memory, especially for a child his age. When he puts in adequate thought, his analyzation skills are really spot-on. He\u2019s never disruptful, which I appreciate. Overall, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a strong student and a pleasure to have in class.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Tony said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart kid. We\u2019re proud of him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you should be. He did especially well on his last test for our unit on World War II. I imagine he had some excellent primary sources to help with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say he has an advantage in that particular field with me around,\u201d said Steve. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t mention it, though.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like drawing attention to himself,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI think that\u2019s understandable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCertainly. I\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s generally pretty quiet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you noticed other kids bothering him?\u201d Steve asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBothering him, not much. Not in this class, anyway. He doesn\u2019t talk to many of his peers, but he seems to avoid some more than others. The rowdier ones.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you let us know if that changes? If anything happens?\u201d Tony cleared his throat. \u201cSometimes it feels like he doesn\u2019t tell us everything.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFew teenagers do. I\u2019ll send you an email if I see anything specific.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you. We really appreciate you taking the time to meet with us,\u201d said Steve, sounding sincere. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. It was quite a pleasure to meet the two of you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky disconnected his phone and set it down after they heard the classroom door click. Peter was sitting with his mouth slightly agape, cheeks flushed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGot any bullies you want to tell us about, kid?\u201d Clint asked. Peter shook himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, nope! Everything\u2019s fine at school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d said Pepper, looking stern. \u201cIf people are bothering you, I\u2019d like to know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter looked down. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter.\u201d Natasha glared ferociously at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t optional. Either you tell us, or we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing,\u201d Peter insisted. \u201cJust some kids being kids. Everyone gets pushed around in high school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou deal with enough,\u201d said Bucky quietly. \u201cYou should feel safe at school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Peter pressed his lips together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t feel safe at school.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2026 Flash wouldn\u2019t hurt me, I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFlash.\u201d Clint raised his eyebrows. \u201cThe kid\u2019s name is Flash.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo- well, yeah.\u201d Peter looked frustrated. \u201cI mean\u2026 I don\u2019t feel unsafe, really.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d Natasha asked. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe just\u2026 bothers me. Insults me, I guess. I think it bothers him that he\u2019s not as smart as he wants to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as smart as you, so he takes it out on you,\u201d Pepper said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Sort of, I guess.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something about it?\u201d Natasha\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t as hard this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would make it worse. I can\u2019t let him know he bothers me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo he does bother you,\u201d Clint said, raising his eyebrows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI- Yes, he bothers me!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was high. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine! It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t make you do anything about it-\u201d Bucky was cut off by Pepper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe most certainly will!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Bucky said, giving Pepper a sharp look. \u201cUnless you display signs of emotional distress. Which, by the way, you can not hide from us. Don\u2019t try.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I am obligated to share this conversation with Mr. Stark,\u201d said JARVIS. \u201cIt falls under the harm prevention protocol.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClint reached over and ruffled Peter\u2019s hair sympathetically. \u201cSorry, kid. We just care about you is all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter made an unintelligible noise and flopped back onto the bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you freaking out?\u201d Clint sat up and studied him. \u201cGood, not really freaking out. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s mad?\u201d Peter asked faintly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be,\u201d Pepper told him, sounding sharp. \u201cAnd if he is, I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re scary sometimes,\u201d Clint said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYour girlfriend is a menace too,\u201d Bucky muttered. Natasha looked pleased. She got up from her place on the fluffy carpet and took over the mussing of Peter\u2019s hair. Clint protested, making grabby-hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMine!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t belong to anyone,\u201d Pepper chided. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so soft,\u201d said Clint, sounding plaintive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou already had your turn,\u201d Natasha told him. \u201cSharing is caring, or whatever people say.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you ask Peter if you could play with his hair?\u201d said Pepper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeter, can I play with your hair?\u201d Natasha asked, and Peter laughed in spite of everything. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs this even real life?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucky stood up, walked over, and pinched his toe.

Natasha offered a vaguely shark-like grin and started running her fingers through his hair. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do you get it so soft?\u201d she asked. \u201cBarnes, feel this.

They were almost as scary as Natasha\u2019s, possibly even more, depending on the lighting. Hill sat down and separated tiny strands of Peter\u2019s hair, carefully plaiting them together and tying them off with little rubber elastics. It was surprisingly relaxing, Peter decided, his eyes drooping a little as he watched Pepper teaching Bucky an elaborate braid on Natasha.

Peter looked somewhat alarmed.\n\u201cYou guys\u2026 want to help me with the video?\u201d\n\u201cSure we do,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cSteve\u2019s going to be thrilled.\u201d\nThe elevator doors opened a minute later. Steve, Hill, and Bucky were already there; Bucky was perched on top of the climbing wall while Steve and Hill stood in front of a tripod, poking at a camera. Steve looked up, seemingly puzzled.\n\u201cDo any of you know how to work these things?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get here so fast?\u201d Clint asked. \u201cAnd no, unfortunately not.\u201d\n\u201cWe were already down here,\u201d Hill replied. \u201cPeter, can you work a camera?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Peter, making his way over and fiddling with different buttons. He hadn\u2019t touched a camera in months, but it felt achingly familiar in his hands. \u201cSomeone go stand there, I have to focus it.\u201d\nHill stood in the middle of the room and waved at the camera, and Peter adjusted the lense. \n\u201cDoes everyone your age just know how do do things like this?\u201d Steve asked, waving a hand at the camera. Peter shook his head.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re making a workout video?\u201d Hill called. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cFor my gym class,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cYou guys really don\u2019t have to help me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of workout?\u201d asked Steve.\n\u201cAnything. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do yet.\u201d\n\u201cBrainstorm time,\u201d Clint said cheerfully. \u201cYou could do a bodyweight workout, one with free weights, or one with machines. Do you want to do cardio, strength, or a bit of both?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 A bit of everything?\u201d\n\u201cHow about push-ups, two sets of ten reps? Then sit-ups, three sets of ten reps. Then bench presses, then maybe bicep curls? And finish with the treadmill, increasing speed and incline every minute.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 Sure!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, go stand in front of the camera,\u201d Clint instructed. Peter made his way to stand next to Hill, who was still in the middle of the room, her eyes on Bucky. She waved, and Bucky inclined his head in return from the ledge he was crouched on. Peter noticed that his shoulders looked tighter than usual, and spared a moment of concern before turning to face the camera. Steve and Natasha were poking at it, confused.\n\u201cIs it on?\u201d\n\u201cI think so, I can see the picture. Is it recording?\u201d\n\u201cWhy is this so complicated?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably fancy,\u201d Clint said. \u201cHere, press the big one on top.\u201d\nNatasha clicked it, and Steve peered into the lense.\n\u201cCan you see me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be able to see you whether it\u2019s recording or not,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cBut I think so. This little light thing is blinking.\u201d\n\u201cPeter, it\u2019s recording!\u201d Steve said. \u201cDo push-ups!\u201d\n\u201cHe has to introduce the push-ups first!\u201d said Hill. \n\u201cReally? Yeah, I guess that\u2019s how this works.\u201d\nPeter smiled, amused. He stepped a bit closer.\n\u201cTo start, do two sets of ten push-ups.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to drink water!\u201d added Steve, and Hill facepalmed from where she was standing behind Peter.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t interrupt him!\u201d Hill called. \u201cNow he has to do it again!\u201d\n\u201cNo, keep it!\u201d Clint said. \u201cIt was funny!\u201d\n\u201cAlso, you\u2019re not much better!\u201d Steve told Hill. \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the shot!\u201d\nHill looked from the lense to the ground beneath her feet. \u201cOops.\u201d\nClint snickered. Hill made her way out of the camera\u2019s view.\n\u201cNow do some push-ups!\u201d Steve said. Peter dropped down and did twenty push-ups, pretending to struggle at the end. Steve threw a water bottle at him, which he caught easily and took a few gulps from. He stepped forward towards the camera again.\n\u201cNext, do three sets of ten sit-ups!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to drink water!\u201d Clint shouted, mocking Steve, who grumbled. Peter swallowed his laughter and dutifully did his sit-ups. Hill leaned in front of the camera and gave a thumbs-up. \n\u201cTime for the bench press,\u201d Steve said. Natasha picked up the tripod and carried it over to the machine equipment, setting it down and stepping aside so Peter could focus it.\n\u201cHow much weight should I press?\u201d he asked once he was satisfied with the camera.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, how much do kids your age usually lift?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t usually use machines in gym class,\u201d said Peter. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d\n\u201cHow much weight should someone Peter\u2019s age and size lift?\u201d Hill asked. \n\u201cHow much can you lift, Peter?\u201d asked Natasha, sounding curious. Peter shrugged, scratching the back of his head.\n\u201cA few tons? I got out of that building.\u201d\n\u201cBuilding?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Peter said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll just press\u2026 a hundred pounds?\u201d \n\u201cSure,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cAlright, do the intro part.\u201d\n\u201cNow move on to strength training,\u201d Peter said to the camera. \u201cUse the bench press first, doing three sets of seven reps.\u201d\nNatasha helped Peter load weights onto each end of the bar; Peter reclined on the bench and began his reps. He got through a set and a half before he caught Hill waving her arms out of the corner of his eye.\n\u201cLook more like you\u2019re struggling!\u201d Hill mouthed. Peter nodded slightly and forced his arms to shake a little, breathing harder, like he was lifting a bus instead of a puny bar. 100 pounds was nothing to him. When he finished, he took another drink of water per Steve\u2019s prompting, and they moved on to free weights. It went easily, and afterwards, Clint tried to teach him to juggle with kettlebells. That came to a quick halt when one of the kettlebells went flying at Steve\u2019s head; Steve caught it with a disapproving look.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Peter squeaked. \n \u201cStop goofing around,\u201d Steve scolded. \u201cYou\u2019re not done yet. Time for the treadmill.\u201d\nPeter carried the tripod over to the treadmill, looking slightly guilty. Clint held a sheepish grin on his face as he put the kettlebells back. Bucky was glaring daggers at him from his perch. \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t hit me, Buck!\u201d Steve shouted. Bucky didn\u2019t seem appeased.\n\u201cTo finish, hop on the treadmill. Start at an easy run, and increase the speed and incline until you\u2019re sprinting. Then go back down,\u201d Peter said to the camera. He got on the treadmill and did just that, remembering to pretend he was having a hard time. Hill gave him a thumbs-up. He glanced up at Bucky as he ran; Bucky was still looking at Clint with displeasure. Clint seemed to notice this, drooping a little. \n\u201cHe\u2019s still giving me murder eyes from up there,\u201d Clint said.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cJust juggle kettlebells somewhere safer next time.\u201d\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll never join Hair Club,\u201d Clint groaned.\n\u201cYou never had a chance,\u201d said Hill. \u201cYou don\u2019t qualify.\u201d\n\u201cPeter qualifies!\u201d\n\u201cPeter has great hair. Yours is average at best.\u201d\n\u201cAverage at best? I take offense to that! I have beautiful hair!\u201d Clint exclaimed. Peter disguised his laugh as a cough and kept running, increasing his pace.\n\u201cDon\u2019t distract Peter,\u201d Steve reprimanded.\n\u201cYou think I have nice hair, don\u2019t you?\u201d Clint asked. Steve sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really the best person to ask about style or fashion.\u201d\nPeter watched as Clint trotted over to the wall. \n\u201cDo you think I have nice hair?\u201d he shouted to Bucky, who glared back as lethally as ever. Clint retreated, calling an apology over his shoulder.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll forgive you,\u201d Hill said with a smile, patting Clint\u2019s shoulder upon his return. Peter finished his treadmill workout and hopped down before the belt had come to a stop. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go edit the footage,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cHair Club?\u201d\n\u201cHair Club,\u201d Peter agreed. Natasha turned and beckoned to Bucky.\n\u201cHair Club!\u201d she called. Bucky began his his descent and made his way over to where everyone was standing.\n\u201cSorry Steve almost got hit,\u201d Clint said earnestly. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nBucky waved him off, edging closer to Steve. It looked like dismissal, but Clint relaxed. They all headed for the elevator; the Hair Club ended up in Peter\u2019s room. Natasha and Hill were looking over Peter\u2019s shoulders at the computer when Pepper showed up with a basket of snacks and assorted items.\n\u201cWhy are we meeting today?\u201d she asked, depositing a bag of chips in front of Peter. \u201cI brought everything to cover the bases.\u201d\n\u201cPeter has to do homework and Steve almost got hit in the head with a kettlebell,\u201d Natasha said, stealing some chips from Peter. Pepper nodded and sat next to Bucky. \n\u201cBraids?\u201d\nBucky sank to the floor and let Pepper section off his hair. His shoulders visibly loosened as she wove the strands together. Peter refocused on the computer, nibbling at his lip.\n\u201cWhat should I cut and what should I keep?\u201d\n\u201cTheoretically, you could keep all of it,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThough I don\u2019t know if you want kids at your school to know about Hair Club.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d said Peter. \u201cI\u2019ll just cut that\u2026 or maybe mute the audio? That way the video is still long enough.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d Natasha nodded. \u201cNot too hard a project, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I guess it was the idea of it that was bothering me. I mean, Flash is still going to find something, but it could be a lot worse.\u201d\n\u201cI want to slap that kid sometimes,\u201d Natasha said, \u201cand I don\u2019t even know him.\u201d\n\u201cI want to slap him too,\u201d Peter sighed as he selected the chunk of footage to mute. \u201cDo you think I should add something in the background so it\u2019s not silent?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Hill. \u201cYou could add music, or you could just add treadmill noise.\u201d\n\u201cHow would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cFind treadmill noise on YouTube and upload it, maybe?\u201d\nPeter nodded. He found a good clip on YouTube and definitely didn\u2019t illegally download it, patching the audio over the silent chunk.\n\u201cGood enough,\u201d he said. Natasha gave him a congratulatory pat on the back. Pepper plucked a bottle from the basket she brought and waved with her free hand.\n\u201cI brought coconut oil,\u201d she told them. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if Peter\u2019s hair will get any softer.\u201d\n\u201cNot possible,\u201d Bucky mumbled.\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to prove you wrong,\u201d Natasha said. She tugged Peter over and sat him next to Bucky, in front of the bed. She and Hill plopped down behind him, opening the coconut oil and beginning to slather it onto his head. He startled at the texture, but relaxed into the feeling of fingers roving through his hair. \nHe yawned, suddenly sleepy. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt such\u2026 nothing. He wasn\u2019t afraid, he wasn\u2019t upset, he wasn\u2019t elated. It was peaceful. The last thought he remembered having before falling asleep was that he didn\u2019t want the moment to end.\n----\nHe was still sitting on the floor when he woke. He was slumped over, pressed against something warm. The thing shifted slightly, and Peter sat bolt upright. That was a someone he was sleeping on, not a something. His wide eyes fell upon Bucky, who was looking at him with a neutral expression on his face. \n\u201cI- I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d\n\u201cIf Barnes didn\u2019t want you sleeping on him, you would\u2019ve been rudely awakened a long time ago,\u201d Natasha interrupted, brushing a hand over Peter\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d Peter asked, rubbing his chest in attempt to steady his heart. \n\u201cJust half an hour,\u201d Pepper told him.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said again. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Hill replied. \n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary. To feel vulnerable sometimes,\u201d Bucky added quietly. \n\u201cLet\u2019s rinse your hair,\u201d Natasha said, standing up and offering Peter a hand. Peter took it and let her pull him up, following her into the bathroom. She turned on the sink and fiddled with the tap until she was satisfied with the temperature, then gestured for him to put his head under the faucet. He complied, finding the water pleasantly warm as she washed the coconut oil from his hair. When she finished, she wrapped his head in a towel-turban thingy, which Peter found both fascinating and amusing. They returned to the bedroom, where Bucky looked imploringly at Peter.\n\u201cHis hair\u2019s still wet,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch it yet.\u201d\nBucky nodded, his gaze resting on the towel on Peter\u2019s head.\n\u201cThis is what excitement looks like on him,\u201d Pepper told Peter. \u201cHe really wants to touch your hair.\u201d\nBucky glared at her, but he didn\u2019t look annoyed. \u201cHis hair is the softest. Coconut oil makes things softer. I predict mind-melting levels of soft.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Natasha said. \n\u201cI won\u2019t do a chocolate pudding,\u201d said Bucky. Peter\u2019s forehead wrinkled in confusion. \u201cFirst time I had it, it was so good I threw it.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to throw me?\u201d Peter said, his face curving into a smile.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Bucky confirmed. He tilted his head at Peter. \u201cDo you know how to braid.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cPepper, can we use your hair.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Pepper said, moving to sit on the floor in front of them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do the fancy ones,\u201d said Peter. \u201cThey look complicated.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s practice,\u201d Bucky told him, combing his fingers through Pepper\u2019s hair before dividing it and showing Peter how to cross them into a braid. \u201cStart simple, like this.\u201d\nHe took out the braid, and Peter tentatively took a turn. He was exceedingly gentle, and Pepper laughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to rip my head off by pulling a little, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cBeauty is pain,\u201d Natasha added cheerfully. Peter tried again, this time pulling the strands more firmly into place. \n\u201cBetter,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cNatasha. Do you think his hair is dry.\u201d\n\u201cGive it five more minutes.\u201d\nBucky let out a small sigh that sounded almost petulant, and Natasha laughed. Peter practiced braiding, and Bucky gave him pointers while watching the clock out of the corner of his eye. When five minutes had gone by, Bucky turned to Peter, eyeing the towel on his head again. \n\u201cGo on,\u201d Hill said, waving her hand. Peter tugged the towel off, and Natasha handed him a comb. He ran it through his hair, which glistened under the light. Bucky\u2019s flesh hand twitched.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit damp.\u201d\nBucky let his head drop back against the bedframe, looking somewhat put out. \n\u201cThis is like giving a kid a puppy and not letting them pet it,\u201d Hill commented.\n\u201cDoes that mean my hair is a puppy?\u201d Peter asked at the same time that Bucky said,\n\u201cAre you calling me a kid.\u201d\n\u201cI like that metaphor,\u201d Natasha said.\n\u201cI am not a kid.\u201d Bucky glared at her. She smiled.\n\u201cPeter, how\u2019s the braiding going?\u201d\n\u201cIt could be worse,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThe last few actually looked like braids.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing better than I did,\u201d said Bucky grudgingly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself,\u201d Pepper told him. \u201cHe has an advantage.\u201d\nPeter opened his mouth to ask, confused, but Natasha nudged his arm lightly. He looked up at her, and she tapped his arm again, looking significantly from Bucky to him. He followed her gaze from Bucky\u2019s metal arm to his own flesh one, and- oh. Braiding with a metal hand was probably pretty difficult. Peter doubted that Bucky could even feel hair with those fingers.\n\u201cWe should watch cartoons,\u201d Hill said. \u201cMy vote\u2019s on Bob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d\n\u201cI second that,\u201d said Natasha. \n\u201cI\u2019m indifferent,\u201d Pepper announced. Bucky nodded in what seemed like agreement. \n\u201cPeter?\u201d Hill said.\n\u201cWhatever you guys want.\u201d\nHill grinned. \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers, then. Here, pass your laptop.\u201d\nPeter got up and grabbed his laptop from his desk, opening it and handing it to Pepper, who gave it to Hill.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope there\u2019s nothing embarrassing in your browser history,\u201d Natasha said cheerfully. Peter\u2019s cheeks turned pink, and he shook his head.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teenage boy,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cOf course there is.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Peter insisted. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put poor JARVIS through that.\u201d\n\u201cHow very considerate, Mr. Parker,\u201d JARVIS said, sounding as warm as an AI could.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a good kid,\u201d said Natasha, tousling his hair. Her eyes widened. \u201cWow. Soft.\u201d\nBucky almost shoved her out of the way, his hand hovering above Peter\u2019s head.\n\u201cYou can touch it,\u201d Peter told him. He carded his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair, his face melting into an expression that Peter hadn\u2019t seen on him before.\n\u201cAdding this to the good list.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, Barnes,\u201d Pepper said fondly. Bucky nodded.\n\u201cPeter\u2019s hair is a mission-assist?\u201d Natasha asked, and Bucky gave her an unimpressed look. \n\u201cPeter\u2019s hair is not sentient.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s alive,\u201d Hill pointed out.\n\u201cBut not sentient. It is not a mission-assist. Peter is a mission-assist.\u201d\nPepper nudged Peter. \u201cYou\u2019re a mission-assist!\u201d\n\u201cA friend,\u201d Natasha clarified, and Peter\u2019s face stretched into a smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friend, too,\u201d he said to Bucky.\n\u201cThis is so wholesome,\u201d said Hill. \u201cWhich episode do you guys want to watch?\u201d\n\u201cThe one with the boy band,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u201cObjections?\u201d Hill looked around. Upon hearing none, she pressed play and set the laptop in front of them. Bucky hadn\u2019t taken his hand out of Peter\u2019s hair; Peter didn\u2019t mind. His eyes grew heavy for a second time, and his head lolled to the side before he snapped it upright.\n\u201cDid you sleep enough last night?\u201d Pepper asked softly.\n\u201cSort of,\u201d Peter mumbled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t really turn my brain off.\u201d\n\u201cRest,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wake you up for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to-\u201d he started to protest, but someone tugged a blanket over him and pulled him sideways so his head was resting on something soft and Bucky\u2019s hand in his hair felt so relaxing that sleep was pulling him under before he could really think about it. Home, his brain supplied before he was out like a light.\n----\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Peter walked into gym class, fiddling with the fabric of his shorts. The teacher had a projector pointed at the wall of the gym, displaying a folder of videos from his laptop. \n\u201cI hope everyone sent me their videos!\u201d the teacher barked. \u201cI know my hope is misplaced, because I\u2019m missing five, but this serves as a warning! You\u2019ll be getting half credit if I don\u2019t have it by the time the bell rings!\u201d\nThe bell rang. \n\u201cFive of you get half credit! Everyone, sit down. We\u2019re going to watch the videos, then each of you pick three that you want to try next class. I expect your full attention!\u201d\nPeter sat next to Ned, as far from Flash as he could. The first video was a girl called Casey\u2019s, which consisted entirely of core exercises. She did a pretty good job, Peter thought. Next was a kid named Josh, who showed five martial arts exercises. When the teacher pulled Peter\u2019s video up, his heart skittered nervously. He hadn\u2019t really double-checked his editing, hopefully he hadn\u2019t missed anything. He facepalmed as Steve\u2019s voice streamed from the speakers.\n\n\u201cCan you see me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be able to see you whether it\u2019s recording or not,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cBut I think so. This little light thing is blinking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeter, it\u2019s recording!\u201d Steve said. \u201cDo push-ups!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe has to introduce the push-ups first!\u201d said Hill. \n\n\n\u201cReally? Yeah, I guess that\u2019s how this works.\u201d\n\n\nPeter smiled, amused. He stepped a bit closer to the camera.\n\n\n\u201cTo start, do two sets of ten push-ups.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to drink water!\u201d added Steve.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t interrupt him!\u201d Hill called. \u201cNow he has to do it again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, keep it!\u201d Clint said. \u201cIt was funny!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlso, you\u2019re not much better!\u201d Steve told Hill. \u201cYou\u2019re standing in the shot!\u201d\n\n\nHill looked from the lense to the ground beneath her feet. \u201cOops.\u201d\n\n\nClint snickered from behind the camera. Hill made her way out of the camera\u2019s view.\n\n\n\u201cNow do some push-ups!\u201d Steve said. Peter dropped down and did twenty push-ups, pretending to struggle at the end. Steve threw a water bottle at him, which he caught easily and took a few gulps from. He stepped forward towards the camera again.\n\n\n\u201cNext, do three sets of ten sit-ups!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to drink water!\u201d Clint shouted, mocking Steve, who grumbled. Peter swallowed his laughter and dutifully did his sit-ups. Hill leaned in front of the camera and gave a thumbs-up.\n\nPeter rubbed his forehead, wishing he could maybe disappear. At least Steve had been too close to the camera to be recognized, and nobody would likely know Hill. Everyone was snickering as the footage cut to Peter introducing the bench press, but they quieted after there was no further commentary from the peanut gallery behind the camera. That didn\u2019t last long, however, because apparently Peter had forgotten to turn off the camera during the kettlebell juggling. The class tittered as Clint juggled, half out of view, and Peter tried to copy him. They didn\u2019t see Steve catch the stray kettlebell, but they laughed at Peter\u2019s horrified apology. \nThe camera wobbled as it was carried to the treadmill, and thankfully Peter had been successful in muting the Hair Club discussion. The patched-in treadmill sound was believable enough, and the video came to an end a few minutes later. Could be worse, Peter decided. Flash raised his hand, and Peter braced himself.\n\u201cDo you have a comment?\u201d said the teacher.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that Peter had help.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a valid concern, but I don\u2019t think that Peter\u2019s friends succeeded in helping him much,\u201d the teacher said. Flash crossed his arms.\n\u201cWhatever. Where did you film that, anyway, Parker?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Peter said, his heart rate jumping.\n\u201cThat gym was huge. You don\u2019t have the money for that.\u201d\nPeter flushed. \u201cOne of my friends owns it.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Sure, Parker. I-\u201d\n\u201cAre there any other comments for Peter?\u201d the teacher cut in. One of the guys sitting near Flash raised his hand.\n\u201cWho was the creepy dude in the background? He was just -like- sitting on top of that big wall, staring at you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s B- \u2026 Jim,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe does that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nPeter shrugged. \n\u201cAlright, this is irrelevant,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving on.\u201d\nThe next video started to play, and Peter relaxed. He was off the hook, at least for now.\n----\nFlasha caught up to him after school as he was heading out the front doors. \n\u201cHey Penis!\u201d\nPeter sighed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the real story behind the gym? How many dicks did you have to suck to-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d someone said, stepping in front of Flash, who skidded to a stop. Peter looked over to find Hill successfully towering over Flash, despite not being much taller than him. Flash had the decency to look slightly nervous.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you were in Peter\u2019s video,\u201d Flash said, squinting up at Hill.\n\u201cYou saw that, did you?\u201d said Hill, smiling and tilting her head. \u201cWasn\u2019t it good? I thought it was very nice.\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201d Flash cut himself off as Hill leaned closer to him, her eyes cold, the curve to her mouth falling away. \u201cYeah, yeah, it was great!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we agree,\u201d Hill said sweetly, stepping back. \u201cCome along, Peter. Emergency meeting. Pepper\u2019s had a bad day.\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t look back as he followed Hill away from the school.\nPeter never usually panicked about tests or papers, but this time, he was the closest he\u2019d ever been. He had a Spanish cumulative test, and yeah, he\u2019d been paying attention, but maybe not enough attention do well. He sat on his desk chair, hunched over, his chest constricting. He went to stand up, suddenly realizing that he hadn\u2019t been getting quite enough oxygen when his vision darkened. He collapsed back in his chair, his anxiety spiking. \n\u201cYou seem to be experiencing a panic response,\u201d JARVIS said. \u201cMr. Stark is in a meeting. Can I call Mrs. Potts for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter said, his breath hitching. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies, Mr. Parker. That is not an option. I\u2019ve notified Mrs. Potts.\u201d\nPeter swore under his breath, gripping the edge of his desk. He was fine. He was being stupid. He didn\u2019t want to bother Pepper. Maybe if she couldn\u2019t find him, she\u2019d leave? Peter got to his feet shakily and stumbled over to his bed. Breathe, dammit. He lifted his bedspread, shuddering at the dusty, dark space beneath the frame. He had no choice, he told himself. He dropped down and wiggled underneath, his breath coming sharply as he let go of the fabric, leaving himself in the near-complete dark. He didn\u2019t like it. Too small, too tight. The slats of his bed pressed against his shoulder, and his lungs burned with panic when he realized that he couldn\u2019t lift his head. Maybe this was a mistake- No. He couldn\u2019t bother Pepper. He was fine. Fine. Fine. \nHe heard the door to his room open and Pepper call his name. Her footsteps crossed his room, soft on the carpet and clacking against the bathroom tile. She said his name again, more worriedly. \n\u201cI can\u2019t find him, JARVIS.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Parker is under the bed, Mrs. Potts.\u201d\n\u201cUnder the\u2026\u201d Her footsteps drew closer, and light flooded Peter\u2019s eyes as she lifted the bedspread. Her face was scrunched with concern. \u201cPeter, sweetheart. What are you doing under there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter said hoarsely. Pepper shook her head.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not doing you any good. Come on out.\u201d\nPeter wanted to argue, but Pepper crouched down and held out her hand; he couldn\u2019t stop himself from taking it and gripping on like a child. Pepper helped him out from under the bed, and he let out a shaking breath. She dusted him off, sitting him down and studying his face.\n\u201cWhat were you doing down there, Pete?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Peter said, swallowing the lump in his throat.\n\u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you,\u201d Peter whispered, twisting his shirt between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cPeter, you could never bother me. You\u2019re like the son that Tony and I never had. I don\u2019t want to see you upset, but I\u2019d much rather see you upset than see you trying to hide it, do you understand?\u201d\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cNow what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d Peter mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s really stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Pepper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I have a Spanish test, a cumulative one\u2026 and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to pass. I just really want to do well and I know it\u2019s my fault for not studying more but\u2026 I dunno. It\u2019s worth a lot of points and my grade is already lower than it should be\u2026 I\u2019m just really stressed out.\u201d\n\u201cTake things one step at a time, okay? Do you have a review sheet?\u201d\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see it.\u201d\nPeter made his way over to his desk and pulled the paper from his bag. He smoothed it out so Pepper could read it.\n\u201cOkay. Why don\u2019t we go down the list and check off what you feel confident about?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Peter said quietly. Pepper pulled out a pencil and handed it to him. He checked off a the present, future and conditional tenses, skipping the preterite and imperfect. He checked demands, pronouns, and adjectives, which left a long list of irregular verbs and ways to conjugate them. Peter felt dizzy looking at them. Pepper squeezed his shoulder.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make online flashcards,\u201d she said, reached forward and opening his laptop. \u201cJARVIS, can you input the terms we give you?\u201d\n\u201cI can,\u201d JARVIS replied. \u201cI can randomize the form and tense of conjugation with any given set of verbs. Would you like me to do that?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please. I have the list here. Can you read it?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would just lean back\u2026 Thank you. I\u2019ve uploaded the list and randomized the terms. They should be available on Mr. Parker\u2019s laptop momentarily.\u201d\nSure enough, a new window popped up with terms and answers. Pepper clicked a button, and the first term was displayed at the top of the screen. An answer box sat below it.\n\u201cOnce you get the answer, the next one pops up. You can skip them and come back if you need to,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you work on this for a little while? I have some phone calls to make, but I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m really sorry I bothered you. You probably have so much to do-\u201d Peter cut himself off after Pepper gave him a severe look.\n\u201cIt was a welcome break,\u201d Pepper told him. \u201cPeter, I\u2019d much rather spend time with you than talk to dickwads on the phone. I\u2019d drop everything in a heartbeat if you\u2019re having a hard time. Don\u2019t isolate yourself because you think that people have better things to do, alright?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Peter said weakly. He rested his hands on the keyboard of his laptop, his fingers trembling a little bit. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour or so. Hang in there. If you need anything, you tell JARVIS to let me know. I mean it.\u201d\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cYou can do it. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d Pepper pressed a kiss to the top of his head and headed out the door. Peter lifted a hand and touched his hair, his heart pounding, but not from anxiety. Nobody had kissed the crown of his head in years, not since he was short enough for May to reach. Pepper had said that he was like her son. His eyes watered, and he sniffled a bit. \n\u201cWould you like me to call Mrs. Potts?\u201d JARVIS asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s good. Things are good here,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said JARVIS. Peter focused his eyes on the screen in front of him and began to type.\n----\nPepper returned forty minutes later, Bucky in tow. Peter had gone through the set of verbs three times, just starting the fourth. He wrung out his hands and spun his chair to face them.\n\u201cDoing alright?\u201d Pepper asked. Peter nodded. Bucky studied him, then stepped forward and offered him a plate of cookies.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter said, sounding reverent. He shoved a cookie in his mouth, sighing happily. \u201cTho good.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s lips twitched. Peter noticed that Pepper didn\u2019t scold him for talking with his mouth full. He ate another cookie.\n\u201cYou know how it works,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cHard work, reward.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one more phone call,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cThen you can have a real break. I just thought you\u2019d appreciate Bucky and his cookies right about now. Eat one more, then back to work, alright?\u201d\nPeter took his last cookie, savoring it this time. Bucky set the plate out of sight on the bedside table and jerked his head, motioning for Peter to keep typing. Peter set his hands back over the keys; Pepper hugged him around the shoulders before making her way to the door.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m s-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you apologize,\u201d Pepper chided. \u201cNo more of that.\u201d\n\u201cSor-\u201d Peter clapped a hand over his mouth, and Pepper laughed kindly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nShe stepped outside, closing the door behind her. Bucky remained, glancing around the room, his eyes catching on the bean bag in the corner. He edged over and settled into it tentatively before getting comfortable. When he noticed Peter gazing at him, he waved his hand.\n\u201cWork,\u201d he prompted. Peter complied, turning his attention back to the verbs on the screen. He made his way through the set one more time before slumping back in his chair, rubbing the sides of his head. \n\u201cWhat else do you need to study?\u201d Bucky said.\n\u201cPreterite vs imperfect, ser vs estar, saber vs conocer.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. Potts is almost done with her phone call,\u201d JARVIS announced. \u201cMight I recommend beginning your break? She will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, JARVIS,\u201d Peter said. Bucky got up and grabbed the plate of cookies, setting it on the desk beside Peter, who took one eagerly.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nBucky dipped his head. \u201cThe test\u2019s tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. After lunch.\u201d \n\u201cNo staying up late studying tonight. You have enough time. Finish early and get enough sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Peter said. Bucky nodded and took a cookie for himself. The lines around his eyes softened a bit as he ate it. The door opened, and Pepper stepped inside.\n\u201cReady for a break?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201d\n\u201cSomething simple,\u201d Peter answered.\n\u201cWe could take a walk somewhere, we could watch TV, we could go bother Steve or Tony or Clint\u2026\u201d\nPeter bit his lip. \u201cMaybe go for a walk?\u201d\n\u201cSure!\u201d Pepper said. \u201cWhat do you think about Bryant Park?\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds good, but don\u2019t you both probably have better things to be doing?\u201d\n\u201cPeter, what did I tell you earlier?\u201d\n\u201cYou said\u2026 you\u2019d rather spend time with me than with dickwads on the phone, but now you\u2019re done with your phone calls, so-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather spend time with you and the others than do anything business-related,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cAnd today, my schedule isn\u2019t full, so let\u2019s go to the park. Barnes, can you come?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Location is within walking distance.\u201d\n\u201cCan we bring a frisbee?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Pepper replied. \u201cI\u2019m not much good, but Barnes might play with you. Barnes, do you play frisbee?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Bucky paused, his eyes growing momentarily distant. \u201cMaybe. I caught Steve\u2019s shield and threw it back.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can do that, I\u2019m sure you could play frisbee. Would you like to try?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Bring multiple frisbees. Amount of force needed to throw a frisbee unknown. I might break them.\u201d\nPepper smiled good-naturedly. \u201cJARVIS, do we have frisbees?\u201d\n\u201cWe have two. One is in the third storage closet by the gym, and the other is on a shelf in Mr. Stark\u2019s tinkering lab. May I suggest purchasing new frisbees? There is a sporting goods store by the southernmost corner of the park that should meet your needs. Directions are on your phone.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, JARVIS. Alright boys, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n----\nThe walk to Bryant Park was quick; Peter noticed some of the tension drain from Bucky\u2019s shoulders as they stepped onto the grass. The sidewalks hadn\u2019t been terribly crowded, but it was still enough to make Bucky hunch over, his jaw tight. Pepper led them down to the corner of the park, then stopped.\n\u201cYou two stay here. I\u2019ll be back in a couple minutes,\u201d she said, gesturing to the sports store. Peter nodded, and he and Bucky watched her cross the road and disappear into the building. As promised, she returned a few minutes later with four frisbees tucked under her arm. She handed one to Peter and one to Bucky.\n\u201cWhat do I do,\u201d Bucky said, looking down at the disc.\n\u201cTo throw forehand, you just kind of flick your wrist and keep the frisbee parallel to the ground,\u201d Peter told him. \u201cHere, watch.\u201d\nPeter stepped forward and snapped his wrist, releasing the frisbee. It sailed for a little while at shoulder-height before losing altitude and skidding across the grass. Bucky copied him; the frisbee blurred through the air before smacking into a tree and cracking into pieces, denting the tree\u2019s bark. Bucky dropped his gaze, looking dejected.\n\u201cI ruined it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I got four,\u201d Pepper said, smiling and giving him another. He held it like it was made of glass, and Peter noticed that his flesh hand was trembling a little.\n\u201cYou did really good,\u201d he told Bucky. \u201cYou just threw it a bit too hard. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nBucky frowned. He stepped forward and released the new frisbee, which wobbled and fell to the ground after ten feet. Peter bounded forward and retrieved it, handing it back to Bucky.\n\u201cThrow a little bit harder, but not much.\u201d\nBucky nodded, and this time, the frisbee arced nicely through the air, only banking right a little bit before sliding across the grass.\n\u201cThat was great!\u201d Pepper exclaimed. \u201cGood job, Barnes.\u201d\nShe passed him the fourth frisbee, which sailed higher than the previous, descending and stopping near a family who were having a picnic. A young girl hopped to her feet and picked up the frisbee, throwing it back it their direction. Peter grinned and waved.\n\u201cThank you!\u201d he called. He handed the frisbee to Bucky. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand over there, and you throw it to me. We\u2019ll see how many times we can pass it back and forth. Pepper, do you want to play?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll watch,\u201d Pepper replied, looking content. \u201cI\u2019ll be Barnes\u2019s moral support. Don\u2019t ask me for advice, though.\u201d\nBucky nodded, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly, and Peter jogged to where the other two frisbees were resting in the grass. He held up his arms and Bucky tossed the frisbee, which listed left. Peter jumped to the side and snatched it, sending it back to Bucky, who caught it in his metal hand and crushed it. Bucky frowned, looking terribly forlorn. Peter\u2019s sharp ears picked up muttered apologies and Pepper\u2019s reassurances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called. \u201cWe have more, don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d\nHe picked up one of the frisbees on the ground and threw it gently to Bucky, who grabbed it with his flesh hand this time. It didn\u2019t break, and he slung it back to Peter looking marginally less upset. They passed back and forth a couple times with no incident before Pepper stepped forward.\n\u201cI\u2019ll play,\u201d she said, and Peter grinned. Bucky handed her the frisbee and she threw it, somehow managing to send it behind her. She laughed, heading over to pick it up and try again. This time, the frisbee sailed up and returned like a boomerang; Bucky snatched it just before it hit him in the face. \n\u201cSorry!\u201d she said quickly, looking horrified. \u201cSorry, Barnes. I don\u2019t know how that happened.\u201d\nPeter swallowed a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to keep it parallel to the ground!\u201d\nPepper gave a thumbs up before grabbing the frisbee and throwing it again. It flew off to her left, almost hitting a young couple who were walking by.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d she shouted, clapping a hand over her mouth. \u201cReally sorry!\u201d\nPeter ran over and retrieved the errant frisbee, passing it back to Pepper, who caught it between her hands like a pancake. She looked surprised, and promptly dropped it. Bucky snickered a little. She pretended to be offended, but Peter could see the wrinkles around her eyes. She picked up the frisbee and tried to throw; it flew upward again, but instead of coming back, it got wedged firmly in a tree. Bucky snorted, looking rather mirthful. Peter tried desperately not to laugh and failed.\n\u201cReally feeling the love here,\u201d Pepper said, somewhat indignant.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get it,\u201d Peter replied, but Pepper waved a hand at him. \n\u201cWe still have one more.\u201d\nShe picked up the last frisbee and threw it, falling short, but Peter dashed forward and grabbed it before it hit the ground. She punched the air happily.\n\u201cSuccess!\u201d\nBucky smiled at her, and Peter gave an enthusiastic thumbs-up. He tossed the frisbee to Bucky, who caught it easily with his flesh hand. Bucky sent it flying to Pepper, who made a lunge at it but couldn\u2019t grab it. She trotted after it and scooped it up, tossing it at Peter. He jumped up and caught it, and Pepper grinned. Peter threw the frisbee back to Bucky, who pitched it at Pepper, who managed to catch it using her alligator-hands technique. She tried to throw it to Peter, but it sailed off to the side and came down on the nearest path. A young boy darted forward and picked it up, looking around and meeting Pepper\u2019s eyes. The boy hesitated, but made his way towards her and held it out. Pepper took it, thanking him. She threw it to Peter, who caught it and jogged after the boy.\n\u201cHere, you can have it.\u201d\nThe boy looked up at him. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you can keep it. Me and my friends have to go home soon anyway.\u201d\nThe boy grinned, displaying a wide gap in his teeth. \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Peter said, watching the kid trot happily back to his parents. He smiled.\n\u201cThat was really nice of you,\u201d Pepper told him, looping an arm around his shoulders. Peter shrugged.\n\u201cWe have to go back anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a great kid, Peter.\u201d\nPeter ducked his head as they headed back over to Bucky, who was studying him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re selfless,\u201d Bucky told him. \u201cLike Steve.\u201d\nPeter looked up, smiling. \u201cYou think I\u2019m like Steve?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that was a compliment,\u201d Bucky returned, but his voice was warm and Peter laughed. \n\u201cI\u2019ll take it as a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d Bucky said once they sobered. \u201cMeans that you\u2019re good, but you have to be careful.\u201d\nPeter tilted his head.\n\u201cBeing selfless means caring about others before yourself. Don\u2019t forget that what others care about might be you.\u201d\n----\nPepper had returned to her work when they got back to the tower; Bucky followed Peter back to his room.\n\u201cPreterite vs imperfect, ser vs estar, saber vs conocer,\u201d Bucky stated. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said earlier.\u201d\nPeter nodded. \u201cI can never remember when to use one versus the other.\u201d\nBucky nudged Peter to the side and typed something into the search bar.\n\u201cPreterite vs imperfect,\u201d he read. \u201cImperfect implies that the past action did not have a definite beginning or a definite end. The preterite tells us specifically when an action took place.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter said. \u201cDo they have examples?\u201d\n\u201cJamie spoke from one until two o\u2019clock. Preterite or imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 Preterite.\u201d\nBucky nodded. \u201cJuan spoke with the student.\u201d\n\u201cImperfect?\u201d said Peter.\nBucky shook his head. \u201cThe beginning and end are implied.\u201d\nPeter rubbed his forehead. \u201cSee? It\u2019s really confusing.\u201d\nBucky picked up a pencil and pressed it into Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cWrite things down. The beginning and end can be implied in the preterite.\u201d\nPeter scribbled down Bucky\u2019s words and looked up. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cThe girls used to speak in English. Preterite or imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cImperfect?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cNo definite beginning or end. They arrived at eight o\u2019clock, preterite or imperfect?\u201d\n\u201cPreterite.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Preterite is used for single events.\u201d Bucky nudged Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cWrite.\u201d\nPeter complied quickly.\n\u201cWe lived there for four years. Preterite or imperfect?\u201d\n\u201cPreterite,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cGood. Preterite is for specific time periods.\u201d\nPeter scribbled that down.\n\u201cShe got up, dressed, and left the house. Preterite or imperfect,\u201d said Bucky. Peter bit his lip.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cIs it definite?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So preterite?\u201d\n\u201cPreterite.\u201d Bucky nodded. \u201cUsed for chains of events.\u201d\n\u201cChains of events,\u201d Peter muttered as he wrote.\n\u201cWe would eat lunch together every day. Preterite or imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cPreterite?\u201d\n\u201cImperfect,\u201d Bucky corrected. \u201cUsed for habitual actions.\u201d\nPeter started a new column of notes.\n\u201cI was reading when my friend entered,\u201d Bucky stated.\n\u201cThere are two verbs,\u201d said Peter, knitting his eyebrows together.\n\u201cHint. One\u2019s preterite, one\u2019s imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cImperfect, then preterite?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Bucky. \u201cImperfect sets the stage for the preterite. The girl was five years old, preterite or imperfect?\u201d\n\u201cPreterite?\u201d\n\u201cImperfect. Age and time are always imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cAge and time are always imperfect,\u201d Peter mumbled as he scribbled the words.\n\u201cI spoke with my mother from two o\u2019clock until three o\u2019clock. Preterite or imperfect.\u201d\n\u201cPreterite.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he was three years old, he was very small.\u201d\n\u201cImperfect.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was a child, I used to play with dolls.\u201d\n\u201cImperfect.\u201d\n\u201cHe called you three times.\u201d\n\u201cPreterite.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s move on. Ser vs. Estar. Ser is for characteristics of the person or thing you are describing. Qualities. Estar is for mood or appearance. Condition.\u201d\nPeter nodded, writing as quickly as he could. \n\u201cWhat something is, use Ser. How something is, use Estar.\u201d\nBucky waited until Peter had caught up before speaking again. \n\u201cSer. Day, hour, date, place of origin, occupation, possession. Estar. Location, temporary states, things continuing in the present.\u201d\nPeter mumbled as he wrote, his hand flying across the page. He raised his head. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cPractice. I am Bob. Ser or Estar.\u201d\n\u201cSer?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cThey are students.\u201d\n\u201cSer.\u201d\n\u201cMy grandmother is standing.\u201d\n\u201cSer.\u201d\n\u201cEstar,\u201d Bucky corrected. \u201cShe\u2019s not permanently standing.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cIt is six-thirty.\u201d\n\u201cSer.\u201d\n\u201cThe bathroom is on the right.\u201d\n\u201cEstar.\u201d\n\u201cI am baking cookies.\u201d\n\u201cEstar.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not necessary.\u201d\n\u201cSer.\u201d\n\u201cHe is sad.\u201d\n\u201cEstar.\u201d\n\u201cYou did fine,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need as much practice as you thought.\u201d\n\u201cI think\u2026 the idea is sort of overwhelming.\u201d Peter scuffed his feet against the carpet.\nBucky nodded. \u201cSaber vs Conocer. What do you know.\u201d\n\u201cUm\u2026 Saber is for facts, I think. Conocer is more\u2026 familiarity.\u201d\n\u201cGood. We\u2019ll practice. I know how to bake. Saber or Conocer.\u201d\n\u201cSaber.\u201d\n\u201cI know Tony.\u201d\n\u201cConocer.\u201d\n\u201cFred knows Manhattan.\u201d\n\u201cConocer.\u201d\n\u201cSarah doesn\u2019t know how to swim.\u201d\n\u201cSaber.\u201d\n\u201cCarrie knows an interesting movie.\u201d\n\u201cConocer.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cDo you want to practice more, or do you feel okay about these?\u201d\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think I feel okay. It\u2019s just a lot to remember. Thank you for helping me, I really appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Review your notes in the morning. You\u2019ll do fine.\u201d\nPeter let his head fall forward onto his desk. \n\u201cMy brain feels like mush.\u201d\nBucky dropped a hand on his shoulder carefully. \u201cYou did good.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was muffled. There was a long pause. \u201cI feel like such an idiot. For freaking out earlier.\u201d\n\u201cIt happens.\u201d\n\u201cCaptain Rogers would like me to inform the two of you that dinner is ready,\u201d JARVIS said. \u201cHe recommends hurrying. The pizza is going fast.\u201d\nPeter perked up at the mention of pizza. He stood so quickly that he wobbled a bit, and Bucky steadied him by the arm.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said sheepishly. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Bucky, amusement faint on his face. The elevator was already waiting, and in less than a minute, Peter was skidding into the kitchen, grabbing a plate and snatching up half a pepperoni pizza before anyone could take it. \n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky Natasha is busy,\u201d Clint said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d fight you for that.\u201d\nPeter made a noise of agreement, his mouth full. Pepper gave him a warning look, and he stopped himself before he started talking and swallowed first. \n\u201cEarly bird gets the pizza.\u201d\nClint laughed. \n\u201cI heard you have a big test tomorrow?\u201d Steve said, ambling over with a plate of pizza to rival Peter\u2019s.\n\u201cYeah, Spanish cumulative. I just finished studying. Bucky was really helpful,\u201d Peter replied, shoving a slice of pizza in his mouth. Steve smiled.\n\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d Peter said. \n\u201cBarnes knows Spanish?\u201d said Clint, raising his eyebrows. \n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Steve said, thoughtful. \u201cI never\u2026 Hey, Buck!\u2019\nBucky turned, his mouth full of pizza. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know Spanish?\u201d\n\u201cI just know a little.\u201d Bucky shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know why. Briefing isn\u2019t giving me anything.\u201d\nSteve nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s probably good.\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cWell, tell me how it goes,\u201d Steve said earnestly, turning back to Peter. \u201cYou\u2019ll do great.\u201d\n----\nPeter sat down at his desk, fiddling nervously with his pencil. He watched as the teacher scooped up the stack of tests and began passing them out, face-down. He gulped as one of the packets landed on his desk. A kid beside him tried to peek and got a stack of papers to the head from the teacher for his effort. Once everyone had a copy of the cumulative, the teacher returned to the front of the room.\n\u201cYou have until the end of the block. Raise your hand if you have a question. Anyone with their phone out will receive a zero. You may begin.\u201d\nPeter flipped the packet over, scribbling his name at the top. He scanned the questions and let out a little breath. He and Bucky had practiced this. He could do it. He inhaled, exhaled, and began.\n----\nPeter was shocked. Utterly floored. His hands shook as he stared at the little B+ circled in red pen at the top of the page. He made a sound like a creaky door and flipped through the test, just to make sure it was the right one. He double-checked that it was, in fact, his name at the top of the paper, and made another sound of surprise. He got a B+. He got a B+. On the cumulative. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d scrape up a C+, and that was if he was lucky. He made another funny sound and flailed a little, then slouched in his seat so nobody would stare at him. He shoved the test in his backpack, his leg bouncing excitedly. He didn\u2019t hear a word the teacher said for the rest of class, but he didn\u2019t care. He got a B+. Life was good. When the bell rang, he shot up out of his seat and booked it for the door, weaving around his peers in the hall and skidding out onto the sidewalk. He sprinted back to the tower, dodging other pedestrians with little incident. He slowed to a brisk walk as he entered the lobby and headed into the elevator.\n\u201cYou seem to be in a particularly fine mood today, Mr. Parker,\u201d JARVIS said as Peter shot upwards.\n\u201cI got a B+ on the cumulative!\u201d Peter exclaimed. \u201cA B+! I can\u2019t believe it! Don\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t, Mr. Parker. Congratulations,\u201d said JARVIS warmly.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d \nThe elevator dinged, and Peter scrambled into the shared space, where Steve and Clint were watching TV.\n\u201cGuess what guess what guess what!\u201d Peter fumbled through his bag, looking for the test.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve said, bemused.\n\u201cWhat are you looking for? Is it alive?\u201d Clint sounded slightly nervous. Peter pulled out the test and shoved it in Steve\u2019s hands, bouncing a little.\n\u201cI got a B+!\u201d\nSteve\u2019s smile stretched into a grin, and he reached up and cuffed Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCongratulations! I knew you\u2019d do well!\u201d\nClint bumped Peter\u2019s fist. \u201cGood job, kid!\u201d\n\u201cThanks!!\u201d Peter squeaked. \u201cI have to tell Bucky! Do you know where he is?\u201d\n\u201cSergeant Barnes is reading a book on the couch in his and Captain Rogers\u2019s apartment,\u201d JARVIS said. \u201cMay I warn him that you are coming?\u201d\n\u201cSure!\u201d Peter said, heading back for the elevator. \u201cBye, guys! Seeya!\u201d\n\u201cBye, Peter!\u201d Clint called as the doors slid shut.\nA few floors down, he scurried up to Bucky and Steve\u2019s place and knocked softly. The door was pulled open, and Bucky stepped back to let Peter in.\n\u201cI got a B+! On the Spanish cumulative! I did it!!\u201d\nBucky\u2019s face softened into a warm, fond smile. \u201cGood for you. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who helped me study! I really really appreciate it, thank you so much!\u201d\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s arms twitched; he fought to keep them by his sides as he vibrated excitedly. He didn\u2019t want to invade Bucky\u2019s personal space. Bucky studied him with soft eyes, then set down the test and pulled him into a careful hug. Peter inhaled, surprised, but melted into the embrace.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again.\n\u201cAny time.\u201d\nPeter threw his phone across his bed, burying his face in his pillow. He had a group presentation due the next day, and nobody was replying to him. He\u2019d done his part; his five slides were thorough with supporting evidence from Fahrenheit 451. Unfortunately, nobody else was as timely. Two people hadn\u2019t even started, and the other one had a single, messy slide. It was already past ten, and they showed no signs of getting any work done. \nPeter sighed. He picked himself up and sat down at his desk, rubbing his eyes. He opened the SparkNotes page on 1984 and began gathering examples of destruction caused by lack of freedom. It took him nearly an hour to organize it all into slides, and he let out a very manly whimper when he realized that he still had two books to pick through. He managed to get a couple slides of information out of the summary for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale before exhaustion got the best of him and he hauled himself up to the shared floor to make himself a strong cup of coffee.\n\u201cMight I recommend getting some rest, Mr. Parker?\u201d said JARVIS in the elevator back to Peter\u2019s room. \u201cYou slept less than four hours last night, as well as the previous one, and you are displaying signs of sleep deprivation.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta finish the project.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you could ask for help, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s late. I don\u2019t want to bother anyone.\u201d\n\u201cSergeant Barnes, Mr. Stark, and Ms. Romanova are all currently awake,\u201d JARVIS replied.\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably busy,\u201d Peter said, stumbling a bit as he stepped out of the elevator and made his way into his room. His coffee sloshed onto his shirt a bit, and he swore. He sat down, scrubbing his blurred eyes as he stared at his computer. His brain was starting to feel like sludge, and he downed the cup of coffee before pulling up a PDF of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and skimming through it as best he could. He found a few good quotes, but he seemed to have to read things twice before he could process them. His eyes got stuck a few times, and he had to force them onwards. The edges of his vision were dark, and he wasn\u2019t entirely surprised when his head fell to his desk with a thud and everything went black.\n----\nTony was working on refining his parachute release design when his music softened, and he looked up, slightly irate.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Parker seems to have fallen unconscious from exhaustion. He is uninjured and his vitals are stable, but it would do him good to be put in his bed.\u201d\nTony dropped the screwdriver he was holding and hurried to the elevator, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he stepped in. He fidgeted as the elevator descended and was out the doors as soon as they slid open, slipping into Peter\u2019s room and frowning deeply at the sight of him passed out at his desk. He picked up an empty coffee mug that seemed to have fallen on the ground and set it quietly back on the desk.\n\u201cJARVIS, any abnormalities in his vitals now?\u201d\n\u201cNothing terribly out of the ordinary. His blood pressure is slightly high and his coordination was poor when he was awake.\u201d\nTony wrapped his arms around Peter\u2019s midsection and hefted him up, the boy\u2019s head lolling against Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony carried him across the room to his bed, laying him down and pulling the blankets over him. He remained limp, and Tony tried not to worry.\n\u201cMonitor him,\u201d he told JARVIS.\n\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\nTony turned out the lights and made to leave before turning back to Peter\u2019s still-bright computer screen.\n\u201cWhat was he working on?\u201d\n\u201cHe was trying to complete a group project. His groupmates failed to complete their share of the work,\u201d said JARVIS.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s due tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cI would presume so.\u201d\nTony hesitated before crossing the room one more time, scooping up Peter\u2019s laptop before heading out and pulling the door shut behind him.\n\u201cWho else is up?\u201d he asked, stepping into the elevator.\n\u201cSergeant Barnes and Ms. Romanova, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cTell them to meet me in the common room with their laptops.\u201d\n\u201cWill do, Sir.\u201d\nThe elevator stopped once as he ascended, and Bucky stepped in. He gave Tony an assessing look as the doors closed, then nodded. Tony returned the gesture.\n\u201cPeter\u2019s alright?\u201d Bucky asked after a few moments.\n\u201cJust exhausted.\u201d\nBucky relaxed a little, though he was still frowning. They didn\u2019t speak again until they entered the shared living room, where Natasha was already waiting.\n\u201cJARVIS said something about a project,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPeter passed out working on some group presentation that the other kids weren\u2019t helping him with.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cLet\u2019s do a project. Show me.\u201d\nTony handed her Peter\u2019s laptop, which she set on the coffee table next to hers. Bucky sat to her left and Tony on her right.\n\u201cIt looks like the theme is how lack of freedom can be destructive to people and societies as a whole. He\u2019s got some good stuff, it looks like he just had ten slides left or so. I\u2019ll share it with myself and you, Barnes, so we can all work at once.\u201d\nBucky opened his laptop, clicking on the presentation and scrolling through it.\n\u201cHave you read any of these, Elsa?\u201d Tony asked. Bucky scowled a bit.\n\u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d he said. \u201cJARVIS recommended that I didn\u2019t read the others.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou can do formatting, then. Make things look pretty. Prettier than you make your hair.\u201d\nBucky glared again, but began scrolling through themes.\n\u201cNat, can you finish the stuff on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale? JARVIS, pull up a summary and a PDF of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick. Heh, Dick. Hey, isn\u2019t that what Blade Runner is based off of?\u201d\n\u201cIt is, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cKnew it. Alright, let\u2019s get started.\u201d\n----\nIt was nearing one in the morning when the three of them were finally satisfied. A solid twenty two slides were complete and well put-together, the font was consistent, and the layout was appealing. The Works Cited slide at the end was neat and properly formatted, thanks to Bucky\u2019s discovery of EasyBib and Purdue Owl.\n\u201cMrs. Potts woke up and would like to know when you\u2019re coming to bed, Sir,\u201d JARVIS said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d said Tony.\n\u201cMrs. Potts would like me to inform you that \u2018soon\u2019 is not an adequate response.\u201d\nTony made a sound between a laugh and a sigh. \u201cTen minutes.\u201d\nHe stood up, Peter\u2019s laptop under his arm. Natasha and Bucky followed him to the elevator.\n\u201cStop at Peter\u2019s room,\u201d he told JARVIS.\n\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d\nWhen the elevator stopped, Bucky and Natasha filed out after him. He opened Peter\u2019s door slowly, and they followed him inside. \n\u201cHow is he,\u201d Bucky said, looking to the ceiling.\n\u201cStable. Sleeping deeply,\u201d JARVIS replied. Bucky nodded. Tony set Peter\u2019s laptop on his desk, and Natasha stepped forward and brushed a hand over his cheek. He didn\u2019t stir. She moved back, making room for Bucky, who had been fidgeting minutely. He pulled Peter\u2019s blankets snugly to his chin, then smoothed down his hair. It was slightly greasy, like the boy had forgotten to shower. Bucky frowned, but made his way out of the room after Natasha and Tony.\n----\nWhen Peter awoke, he stretched peacefully and lay for about ten seconds before panic hit him. He hadn\u2019t finished the presentation. He was screwed. He would fail and there was nothing he could do and everyone would be disappointed-\n\u201cMr. Parker,\u201d JARVIS said, interrupting his quickly-derailing train of thought. \u201cYour presentation has been finished. There is no need to panic.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brian ground to a halt. \u201cFinished?\u201d\n\u201cFinished,\u201d JARVIS confirmed.\n\u201cBy who?\u201d Peter finally managed.\n\u201cMr. Stark, Sergeant Barnes, and Ms. Romanova.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou passed out due to exhaustion. They moved you to bed and finished the project.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a joke? Am I dreaming?\u201d\n\u201cI could summon Sergeant Barnes to pinch your toe,\u201d JARVIS offered.\nPeter snorted, half in amusement and half in disbelief. He dragged himself out of bed and flopped into his desk chair, opening his laptop. Sure enough, the presentation was complete. Peter grinned. He almost wanted to cry. He brushed his teeth and pulled on fresh clothes, then packed his bag and hurried to the elevator for breakfast. Steve was the only one in the kitchen, a bowl of cereal on the counter in front of him. He turned at the sound of Peter\u2019s footsteps.\n\u201cHey there,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Peter said cheerfully.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully chipper,\u201d said Steve. \u201cHad a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied, pulling out a bowl and pouring himself some cereal of his own. Steve passed him the milk and he nodded in thanks, sitting down to eat. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you eat such sugary cereal,\u201d Steve said, studying Peter\u2019s Froot Loops.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m used to it,\u201d Peter replied, his mouth curving. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you eat that stuff. It looks sort of like shredded cardboard.\u201d\nSteve laughed. \u201cI guess it does. What do those taste like, anyway? They\u2019re so colorful.\u201d\n\u201cSwap,\u201d Peter said, pushing his bowl toward Steve, who obediently handed over his own. Steve took a bite of Froot Loops and his eyes widened.\n\u201cThat is\u2026 sweet. Very sweet.\u201d\nPeter suppressed a laugh and took a spoonful of cardboard. He made a face as he chewed and swallowed.\n\u201cIt tastes like cardboard got bored of being cardboard and got even more boring.\u201d\nSteve chortled and gave Peter his Froot Loops back, returning to his cardboard.\n\u201cI would suggest leaving for school within the next three minutes, Mr. Parker,\u201d JARVIS said. Peter checked the time and squeaked, shoveling cereal into his mouth like there was no tomorrow. When he finished, he plopped his bowl in the sink and scooped up his bag.\n\u201cHave a good day at school!\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Peter chirped, darting for the elevator. \u201cSee you later!\u201d\n----\nThe presentation went well. Peter\u2019s groupmates read from the slides despite having done none of the work, and Peter seethed a bit, but what could he do? It was finished, anyway, by cause of Tony, Bucky, and Natasha. He\u2019d have to thank them somehow. His group got scattered applause and they sat down, watching others until the bell rang. Peter grabbed his bag and headed for the door.\n\u201cCan I speak with you, Mr. Parker?\u201d\nPeter turned to find his English teacher behind him.\n\u201cSure?\u201d\nThe teacher waited until everyone had filed out before speaking.\n\u201cI got an email from your guardian saying that you stayed up quite late and did the vast majority of the work on your project. I know that I said on the rubric that you\u2019d be getting group grades, but I\u2019m going to make an exception this once, and only because I looked at the editing history of the presentation. You did most of the work, and you\u2019ll get credit where credit is due.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter said, surprised. \u201cI\u2026 I really appreciate that.\u201d\nThe teacher nodded, shooing him to the door.\n\u201cOh, and Peter?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cGet enough sleep, alright? It\u2019s important at your age.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n----\nAfter school, Peter kept going past the tower to Target. He grabbed a cart and made his way to the aisle filled with cards. He selected a thank you card with different shapes on the front for Tony, one with cartoon animals for Bucky, and one with red swirls for Natasha. He picked out different items as he went down aisles and between racks of clothes, including a plaid handkerchief for Bucky, coconut conditioner for Natasha, and a little Iron Man Lego set that Tony would definitely play with for fun at some point (or maybe he\u2019d throw the pieces at people), a bag of mixed chocolates for each, and three little wicker baskets. He paid and gathered up the plastic bags, hurrying back to the tower as it started to rain. \nHe assembled the baskets carefully, writing thoughtful notes in the cards before adding them in. He went to Tony\u2019s workshop first, tiptoeing in and watching Tony sing along with his loud music for a little while. Tony finally looked up and jumped a mile when he saw Peter.\n\u201cJeez, kid. Warn a guy, would you?\u201d he said, but his voice was warm and he messed with Peter\u2019s hair playfully. \u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d\nPeter handed him the basket. \u201cAs a thank you.\u201d\n\u201cA thank you? For what, the presentation? That was nothing. You didn\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d Tony rooted through the basket, laughing at the legos and popping a chocolate into his mouth before opening the card. \n\nTony. Thank you so much for working on my project. I really appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d look up to anyone like a dad after Uncle Ben, but I was wrong about that. You mean a lot to me. Thanks again, love, Peter.\n\nPeter wasn\u2019t sure if it was a trick of the light, but Tony\u2019s eyes looked a little damp before he wrapped an arm around Peter and squeezed him tight.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kid.\u201d\nTony released him, stepping back. Peter grinned and headed back to the elevator. \n\u201cJARVIS, can you warn Bucky I\u2019m coming?\u201d he said.\n\u201cRight on it, Mr. Parker.\u201d\nWhen he knocked, Steve\u2019s voice called \u201cCome in!\u201d\nPeter pushed the door open, basket in hand, to find Bucky reading a book and Steve sprawled out next to him, watching the news.\n\u201cThis is for you,\u201d Peter said, extending the basket to Bucky. \u201cAs a thank you.\u201d\nBucky lifted the corner of his mouth in a small smile as he pulled out the handkerchief buried under chocolates.\n\u201cLook what I got, Steve.\u201d\n\u201cOoh!\u201d Steve grabbed a handful of chocolates and tried for the handkerchief, too, but Bucky held it out of his reach.\n\u201cNope. It\u2019s mine. You have to do something nice for Peter to get one.\u201d\nSteve pouted. \u201cBut I lost mine.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad.\u201d\n\u201cCruel,\u201d Steve sighed, unwrapping a few chocolates and munching on them. Bucky pulled a flower crown out of the basket that Peter had mostly picked out as a joke and studied it before putting it on.\n\u201cSteve. How do I look.\u201d\nSteve grinned. \u201cAdorable.\u201d\nBucky looked satisfied and opened his card.\n\nBucky. Thank you for finishing my project. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if you guys hadn\u2019t. JARVIS said that you did the formatting, and it looked great. The teacher seemed impressed. You\u2019re honestly one of the nicest people I know, even if you don\u2019t think that. You\u2019re also one of my favorite people. Your cookies are delicious and you let me fall asleep on you that one time and you didn\u2019t get mad. I mean, I probably would\u2019ve been annoyed. I don\u2019t know why you put up with me sometimes. Thank you so much for everything. Love, Peter.\n\nWhen Bucky finished reading, he read it again, then used his new handkerchief.\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of my favorite people too,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThank you. This is\u2026 really kind.\u201d\nHe got up and set the card on a shelf by a tall potted plant, next to a wrinkled letter. Then, he wrapped an arm around Peter and gave him a little squeeze. Peter smiled broadly; Bucky looked warm and tranquil, especially in his flower crown. Bucky released him, moving to sit by Steve again.\n\u201cSee you later,\u201d Peter said, heading for the door and giving a little wave. Bucky and Steve returned the gesture and Peter pulled the door shut, making his way into the elevator.\n\u201cJARVIS, where\u2019s Natasha?\u201d\n\u201cShe is currently training in the gym with Mr. Barton. Would you like to go there?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Peter said, and the elevator began to sink. He stepped out into the vast gym; Natasha and Clint were sparring. Natasha was quick, soon delivering a succession of hits that unbalanced Clint. She took him down, and he used his weight to pin her, but not for long. He let out a pained yelp and she wriggled from beneath him, looking pleased with herself. She caught sight of Peter and beckoned him over with a wave. Clint looked up from the ground.\n\u201cOh, hey kid!\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d Peter said, looking at Clint in amusement.\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me,\u201d Clint warned. \u201cShe played dirty.\u201d\n\u201cStill won,\u201d Natasha said cheerfully. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019s up, Peter?\u201d\n\u201cThis is for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a thank you.\u201d\nShe took the basket, smiling at the chocolate and her eyes lighting up at the conditioner and assorted hair elastics. She took out the card, scanning it.\n\nNatasha. Thank you for helping with my project. It was really nice of you and it saved me a ton of panic. I really look up to you because you\u2019re kind and strong and calm and the type of person that I wish I was more like in a crisis. You\u2019re one of the coolest people I know. Also, thank you for inviting me to join Hair Club. It\u2019s like having the family that I never got. Love, Peter.\n\nNatasha\u2019s face slid into her trying-not-to-show-emotion expression. \n\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, Peter,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve always got your back, alright?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Peter. She pulled him into a quick hug and kissed the top of his head. Peter didn\u2019t trust his voice not to waver, but he grinned when he stepped back and headed for the elevator. \n\u201cWe\u2019re damn lucky to have that kid, Clint,\u201d Peter overheard her say as the doors closed. Peter rubbed the moisture from his eyes and beamed up at the ceiling. They liked him. They honestly liked him.\n\u201cAre you alright, Mr. Parker?\u201d JARVIS asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter replied, his voice thick. \u201cI\u2019m really, actually fine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said JARVIS. \u201cYou are a fine young man.\u201d"
