    "summary": "<p>Bakugou Katsuki was now Japan's #1 Pro Hero, he just got off of work and was looking through twitch to find something to watch to keep himself awake for a few hours.<br>That is until he sees a cute guy with beautiful sea green hair, and emerald eyes talking about heroes.</p>\n<p>So what if Katsuki dropped the guy some money, and so what if he was accidentally developing a crush on the guy.<br>This was fine.<br>Its fine.<br>After all its not like the guy is gonna send Katsuki a message-<br>Oh no, is that a notification sound?</p>\n<p>AU Where Izuku is quirkless and a twitch streamer and Katsuki has to keep his identity as DynaMight hidden while the two slowly develop feelings for the other</p>\n<p>Clicking the stream his jaw hung he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. This fucker. Not only did he have that beautiful ocean green hair, but he has gorgeous long dark eyelashes, soft full pink lips, and freckles. Holy shit. The freckles! A beautiful plethora of constellations across his cheeks and down his neck. And wait, where are they on his arms too?! Each time the guy waved his arms around Katsuki could see some along his forearm, beautiful soft angel kisses all over. God fucking damnit.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s hands hovered over his phone's keyboard. What the fuck do you say in this kinda situation? He was never good with feelings, let alone helping people with THEIR feelings.<br>But fuck.</p>\n<p>And one thing that kept pulling at him. \u201cMaybe cause I\u2019m qurikless?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>KaboomKing: I don\u2019t have a mic for my PC.<br>Deku: Oh heck. Really??<br>KaboomKing: Never needed one.<br>Deku: Aww\u2026 we could call on your phone?<br>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p>\n<p>Fuck, he completely forgot about his phone!</p>\n<p>Maybe the shit mic quality would mask his voice? And if he wasn\u2019t yelling and just talking calmly Deku might not even realize who he is. No, this could work. This could for sure work.</p>\n<p>With shaky hands, Katsuki typed out his message.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d Katsuki groaned out, staring down at his phone. This has to be illegal to be this adorable. There no fucking way a human being could look like that and be allowed to walk down the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhhhh~\u201d Denki now had a cheshire grin. \u201cSo it's a boy!\u201d </p>\n<p>That was not what he was expecting the other blonde to say. \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, it makes sense. You never were into girls back in high school. Its okay Kats, you know I\u2019d never judge you for being gay.\u201d Denki reached out, placing a hand onto Katsuki\u2019s broad shoulder. </p>\n<p>Error, error. Katsuki has stopped working.</p>\n<p>WARNING: THIS CHAPTER COVERS TOPICS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND PHYSICAL ABUSE!<br>PLEASE BE WARNED BEFORE READING</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, my poor kitten. You look so upset. I\u2019m sorry, but you were trying to get away and I just couldn\u2019t have that.\u201d The raven haired man said gently, pushing Izuku\u2019s curls out of his face and brushing at his soft cheeks.\u201dYou\u2019re far too cute for me to just let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a sad reality before them both. They were both alone, but in different ways. Katsuki had chosen to be alone, and had chosen to push people away. while Izuku had been pushed away, he had no choice in this isolation. But in the end, both longed to be found, long to find someone else that could understand them in a way that no one in this society could. It was poetic, in some sad messed up way. Each wanting the other for different but all to similar reasons, two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Kacchan, c-could you do something for me?\u201d Izuku mumbled out, feeling his ears start to burn up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWassup nerd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you read to me until I fall asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cK-Kacchan\u2026?\u201d Izuku could barely speak, fear spiked through his entire being. He felt sick.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, I need you to breathe. You\u2019re hyperventilating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cK-Kacchan he found me! He knows who I am!\u201d Izuku rasped out.</p>\n<p>DING DONG</p>\n<p>the doorbell? </p>\n<p>Izuku froze, staring at the entrance way to his apartment. Another ring, and Izuku slowly stood to walk towards the door. His body felt woozy, his vision going blurry as he made his way over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-who is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d Katsuki could feel a toothy smile creepy across his sharp features. \u201cI can beat this guy to a pulp.\u201d</p>\n<p>A piece to this puzzle that life dared hand them and all this time they had been desperately trying to put together but never knowing where the final piece lay.</p>\n<p>It was here.</p>\n<p>The piece was found.</p>\n<p>\u201cP-pretty? Me? I\u2019m not a girl, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah no shit Sherlock. Men can be pretty. You\u2019ve called me pretty before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck-CRAP! No! Ugh!!!\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that. \u201cIzuku Midoriya! Was that a swear? My, what would your mother think!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, your swearing has rubbed off on me!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMe? Swearing? I don\u2019t know what you mean! I\u2019m an Angel! I never swear and I am always very very polite.\u201d Katsuki coos, sarcasm dripping from his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHardy harr harr.\u201d Deku huffs, but a smile clearly on his lips. \u201cBut, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are very pretty.\u201d</p>",

I tried writing that scene over and over again but it clashed badly with this ending, but yes he did tell him.<br>and Izuku about melted from it. The piece was originally planned for that scene but like I said, everything I wrote just didn't seem good.</p>\n<p>Is Izuku still going to nursing school?<br>Yes~! He still dreams of being a nurse even if he's dating the top hero! He wants to save lives too!</p>\n<p>Is Izuku still streaming?<br>yep~ Though now from the safety of Katsuki's home ;) Aint no one getting in there</p>\n<p>What about inko????<br>Well, with Katsuki's money she's been able to get better care and is doing a lot better now.</p>\n<p>Is this really the ending??<br>Yeah. I didn't want to just keep writing for the hell of writing and end up getting writers block because I can't figure out where to go next.<br>I haven't written a big story like this in YEARS and there's nothing worst than writing yourself into a hole just cause you don't want to be done.<br>But don't worry~!<br>I have two fics in the works! One with Deku being trans and he owns a cafe where his old childhood bully wonders in (should be out by next week. waiting on a logo) and one about android Deku~! :&gt;<br>So please follow my twitter to get those post~</p>",
    "text": "Katsuki sighed, slowly slipping off his boots as he entered his apartment. He had just worked a 16 hour shift and exhaustion was slowly starting to seep in. As the new Symbol Of Victory, Katuski had an extremely busy life, but one he was extremely thankful for. He had everything he could ask for though, something still felt like it was missing.\n\u00a0\nThe time was 5:32, and he knew if he fell asleep now he\u2019d wake up at 2am and wouldn\u2019t be able to get back to sleep. He needed to stay awake just a few hours longer to try and have some semblance of a sleep schedule.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde made his way into his kitchen and started cooking up dinner, hoping food might wake him up some. While cooking he opened his phone and began looking for something to watch and keep his exhausted brain stimulated.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was never one for streamers but he had hoped having something live might keep his brain more awake. Looking through Twitch however, nothing seemed interesting. That was until he saw it. Or rather him.\n\u00a0\nThe thumbnail showed a boy with wild viridian hair and matching bright eyes. He couldn\u2019t see much of him from just the thumbnail alone but the guy sure had a hell of a look. Katsuki wondered if his hair color was naturally green or if he dyed it like Kirishima. But the thing that REALLY caught his attention was the title.\n\u00a0\nPRO HERO DYNAMIGHT: VILLAIN FIGHT BREAKDOWN AND ANALYSIS!\n\u00a0\nThis dude was really doing a breakdown of his last battle on twitch? Really? Now this he HAD to see.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClicking the stream his jaw hung he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. This fucker. Not only did he have that beautiful ocean green hair, but he has gorgeous long dark eyelashes, soft full pink lips, and freckles. Holy shit. The freckles! A beautiful plethora of constellations across his cheeks and down his neck. And wait, where are they on his arms too?! Each time the guy waved his arms around Katsuki could see some along his forearm, beautiful soft angel kisses all over. God fucking damnit.\n\u00a0\nThe best way Katsuki could describe him was like a fae from some fantasy story he might have read as a kid. He looked ethereal and beautiful. Katsuki felt like he knew this guy from somewhere but also didn\u2019t, it made his heart beat faster and his stomach do flips just looking at the guy. Like some weird connection he couldn't even explain.\n\u00a0\nHe was so distracted by how gorgeous the man was he didn\u2019t even register he was talking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs you can see here, during his fight DynaMight was attempting to try out some new types of explosions. His quirk is made from the sweat on his hands so I theorize that he\u2019s been trying out new techniques since it\u2019s winter and he can\u2019t get as much sweat as he\u2019d need for his other explosions he\u2019d have during summer.\u201d The freckled beauty remarks.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s brain nearly short circuits. His voice was so soft and airy. Like a warm cup of cocoa after playing out in the snow. It was like if warm hugs had a sound. The blonde couldn\u2019t believe his ears, there\u2019s no way someone could look so adorable and have the sweetest voice as well. This was some absolute bullshit! He HAD to have some kinda flaw!\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared intensely at his phone as he listened to the greenette talk about his last battle, now even MORE impressed by how intelligent the guy was. He talked wildly with his arms, going off on long tirades about quirks and how they were used, every now and then giving praise to how amazing DynaMight was during his last battle.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki had nearly forgotten about his food as he had gotten so sucked into the nerds' ramblings. Grabbing a bowl and scooping up some of the curry he had just made he wandered into his room and turned on his PC to sit and watch the stream from the comfort of his desk.\n\u00a0\nAs he loaded up the URL, he watched the chat from his phone. The guy was clearly pretty popular, and gathered quite a few \u201csimps\u201d, as Mina would call them. The chat was going a mile a minute, he\u2019s honestly impressed the greenette could keep up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEach time there was a donation he would pause his ramblings to thank them then go back to rambling or answering questions in chat.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce the stream was loaded on his PC he noticed a few things when he scrolled down. It was a short introduction panel he couldn\u2019t see on mobile.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nHey there!! (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727 my names Deku! Yep you read that right! \u30fd(\u309c\u2207\u309c)\u30ce I\u2019m a biiiiig fan of heroes, if you can\u2019t tell. My favorites being DynaMight and All Might!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u30fd(^\u25c7^*)/ I\u2019m actually quirkless myself, but I had big dreams as a kid to become a hero. Didn\u2019t exactly work out but hey! Now I can talk to YOU guys about heroes! So it\u2019s okay!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI go to college so my schedule is a bit busy. I stream Mondays, Wednesday and Saturdays\u00a0\n\u2229(\ufe36\u25bd\ufe36)\u2229 so please come by!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeku | 22 | he/him | Quirkless | Cancer sign | This stream is a safe space for everyone! (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f) If you\u2019re a bigot you will be banned\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at it all. The emojis alone were ridiculous, but the guy seriously went by Deku? There HAD to be a story behind this weird nickname and he was hoping to find out.\n\u00a0\nThough, something did catch his attention even more than the weird nickname. The dude was quirkless? That was pretty rare in today\u2019s world, and it looked like he was pretty loud and proud about it too. Having it put down twice on his little about section.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLooking back to the stream, he kept seeing all the donations pooling in. Each time a big number would pop up Deku would get flustered and start sputtering out a thank you. Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but think how awkward the freckled nerd acted was pretty cute.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis sparked a dangerous idea in his head.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\nMintyLove: Deku-Chan is soooo cute!!\u00a0\nRainyDayz: dude is such a DynaMight simp LOL\nRagingPuppies: Deku how\u2019s school going?\nKaboomKing Donated \u00a5100,000\nShadowEons: HOLY SHIT\nMintyLove: WHAT\nChaoticSandwhich: the fuck did I come back to\nOrangePeeledRice: DEKU HOLY SHIT LOOK\nKaboomKing: lol\nRagingPuppies: lol?!?!? You donate that then just say lol?!?!?\u00a0\nKaboomKing: lol\n[mod] ManicDreams: DUDE WHAT?!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nDeku was yet on another rant when the notification popped up. He nearly bit his own tongue seeing the number flash before his eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWh- HUH?! E-Excuse me?! D-did you mean to donate that much?! That\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki smirked from behind his monitor. Cute. This reaction was very cute.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeku\u2019s face was bright red, and he kept wrapping his arms around his face to hide the blush. He looked so embarrassed and frazzled.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Yep. Was the amount I meant to put in.\u00a0\nChaoticSandwhich: dude that\u2019s INSANE!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-\u201c The greenette takes a deep breath, trying to collect himself. \u201cWow, I cannot thank you enough! Holy cow! Thank you KaboomKing! You\u2019re literally the nicest person. Holy crap, I just- I have no words.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but flush at the praise he was getting. Sure he was used to praise, hell he got it pretty constantly. But for some reason this made him feel butterflies in his belly. Like his heart was leaping out of its chest with each word the beautiful freckled man spoke.\n\u00a0\nWithout even thinking, the blonde dropped 50 gifted subs and another \u00a5100,000. Fuck it.\n\u00a0\nThe minute the pop up came the chat was going absolutely ballistic and Deku looked like he was about to cry. Katsuki didn't even know it was possible for someone to get even redder and yet here we were\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh!! Oh my God!! Are you for real? K-Kaboom you seriously don\u2019t need to do this! You\u2019re so sweet! Oh wow\u2026 I\u2019m- I might cry?! Wait no I think I am crying?! I don\u2019t have enough words. You\u2019re the sweetest person. Oh gosh I hope you\u2019re having a good day cause you seriously deserve it!!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blonde sat back in his chair now having the biggest shit eating grin on his face. He was practically eating up the compliments thrown at him by this cutie. He felt like his own heart was racing from all the endorphins running through his body. Denki would probably say some dumb shit like \u201cThank you for the serotonin!\u201d or whatever, which honestly felt fitting right now. Even if Katsuki hates to admit it.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: It\u2019s nothing. Just felt like it\nMintyLove: Hh you just casually felt like dropping \u00a5200,000 and a ton of subs?!\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: pretty much.\nMintyLove: Mmmmm! Sureeee, likely story.\ncandycorn69: Dude is a simp like the rest of us. Can't blame him though. Deku is cute af\nCreepyKitten: I wish Deku was my boyfriend u-u\u00a0\nLovely1113: Ugh same. He\u2019s so cute. I bet he\u2019d make an amazing bf\nTonedBeans: I bet the guy is gay though, I mean look at how much he simps for DynaMight. None of us gals in chat got a chance with this hottie\nCrispy2489: guess that means I might be able to date Deku. Hahaha\nDekuIsMyLove178: I wonder what he looks like naked hehehehe\u2026\u2026.\nTonedBeans: you\u2019re speaking my language now!\nCreeptKitten: oh don\u2019t be weird you guys :/\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Shut the fuck up\nLovely1113: ohhhh someone\u2019s angy. Touch a nerve rich boy?\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: No. You all are just gross.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nRight. Creeps were always online, and with someone as adorable as Deku then they\u2019d come in droves. He watched as Deku\u2019s face contorted slightly reading the chat, clearly annoyed at the nasty comments but didn\u2019t say anything. Which honestly was a smart choice. Had it been Katsuki in that situation he\u2019d start yelling at the chat about being freaks and how none of them are worthy to date him. Was probably best he didn\u2019t dare try and stream.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d the greenette starts, snapping Katsuki out of his train of thought. \u201cFor real. Thank you so much. You\u2019d not know how much that money means to me.\u201d Deku smiles. It was a genuine smile. None of that fake crap Katsuki saw all too often with streamers. The guy was genuine and every word he meant felt honest.\n\u00a0\nGod, this guy was gonna make his wallet hurt if he kept this up. But fuck it was so word it.\n\u00a0\n\u2014-\n\u00a0\nAfter another hour Deku had started his sign off for the stream. It was now 7:40, and Katuski honestly didn\u2019t expect that he\u2019d be here the entire time but the guy had a way with words. He could sit and listen to Deku talk about literally anything for hours.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright guys! It\u2019s getting late and I need to get dinner and go study. Thank you all for hanging out with me tonight and an EXTRA big thank you to Kaboom for his donations! You're absolutely amazing! I hope you all have a good night too, and stay safe. I\u2019ll see you all next stream. And don\u2019t forget to join my Discord if you want regular updates or to chat with me! Deku~! OUT!\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd with that the stream ended and Katsuki was left in silence.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDiscord\u2026?\u201d Katsuki mumbled, scrolling back down to see Deku\u2019s bio.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt had all of his social media links, which Katuski was for sure going to look through later. And then there it was, the link to whatever the Hell this discord thing was.\n\u00a0\nKatuski clicked on it and it immediately opened a second window. Ah, of course. He needed to sign up.\n\u00a0\nAfter a few minutes he made his account, linked his twitch, got the desktop app for it as well, and he was all set to join whatever this weird app was.\n\u00a0\nDeku\u2019s Nerd Zone was the name of the server. Extremely fitting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith his account linked to his Twitch he saw his name was a unique color in the server as well. Must be some special thing for donors? He wasn\u2019t sure. But what he was sure or was the ping sound he heard as he got a DM.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho the fuck is messaging me? I just got this stupid account.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnnoyed, Katsuki clicked on the icon and then he saw it. There was no fucking way.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nDeku: (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727 Hey! I\u2019m assuming this is the same Kaboom from my stream?\nKaboomKing: Yep\nDeku: \u30fd(\u309c\u2207\u309c)\u30ce wonderful! I just wanted to thank you again! I don\u2019t really talk about this on stream cause it\u2019s kinda a downer but my moms been sick lately so she can\u2019t go to work as often. So I\u2019ve been paying for her doctor bills and some of her rent, along with college and my own rent. So I\u2019ve been pretty stressed out this month haha (o\u00b4\u03c9\uff40o) so you hella saved me there!\nDeku: Sorry that\u2019s kinda a downer. But idk, I thought you had the right to know where your money is going and another big thank you!!\u00a0\nDeku: \u00f4\u30ee\u00f4 I\u2019m so shocked you gave so much too when it\u2019s your first stream you\u2019ve seen of mine!\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared at the message in complete and utter shock. His mom was sick? How sick? What was happening? Was it bad? And how the hell was this guy still so fucking sweet even now?! Was it wrong to ask? He should probably wait and ask another time, that seemed like a touchy subject.\n\u00a0\nKatuski felt a lump in his throat, he had no idea how to even respond. He didn\u2019t even expect the freckled boy to message him! He hadn\u2019t thought any further if the two were to actually fucking talk! Fuck!!\n\u00a0\nCalm down Katsuki. Calm down. He\u2019s just a cute guy on the internet. No big deal. You\u2019re fucking DynaMight!! Japan's number one hero! You can talk to a cute guy! It\u2019s fine! This is fine!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: Sorry I ramble a lot. You just seem like such a kind person, idk. Made it seem easy to talk to after what you did. Sorry if I\u2019m assuming \u2510(\u2018\uff5e`\uff1b)\u250c\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nThis was not fine!!\n\u00a0\nWhy was he so sincere in everything he said? And absolutely adorable?! Fuck!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nKaboomKing : No it\u2019s fine. I liked what you had to say about DynaMight and other shit.\nKaboomKing: just got off a 16 hour shift and your stream kinda helped perk me up after the shit I had to deal with today. It was one big fucking mess so your peppy little nerd ass was kinda just what I needed. Felt like you deserved a tip for helping keep me sane.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t a lie. Katsuki had one hell of a day and all he wanted to do was crawl into bed and physically evaporate so he no longer had a physical form. Hero work was shit sometimes and exhausting.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeeing how excited those gorgeous ocean green eyes were as he talked about Katsuki made it all worth it though.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku:\u00a0 Oh!!! Oh wow!! I\u2019m honestly so glad I could make your night somehow! That\u2019s such a big honor omg. (\u25d5\ufe4f\u25d5\u273f) you\u2019re gonna make me emotional again!\nDeku: I\u2019m so sorry you had a bad day Kaboom (\u2565_\u2565) you seem like such a sweet person, you really don\u2019t deserve that.\u00a0\nDeku: I don\u2019t usually talk to my viewers since a lot of them can get kinda weird. But I saw you in chat telling people to stop being creepy, and after all the kindness you gave me today I felt like I just HAD to talk to you! And then you joined my server so! Bam!!\nDeku: if you wanna vent about your day I\u2019m all ears, honestly. It\u2019s the least I can do for all the kindness you\u2019ve offered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThis guy! There\u2019s no way someone this sweet could possibly exist. Dude was like if sugar was in human form. He was so damn sweet and genuine in everything he did and said. It made Katsuki\u2019s stomach feel all kinds of weird.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: Wow. Are you even real? There\u2019s no fucking way someone as nice as you fucking exist. This some kinda act? Am I being pranked?\nDeku: fjjsjfjsjfjebajs oh!! Haha this is just how I am! I\u2019m sorry fjejfjsjdhsjxmfk\u00a0\nKaboomKing: You actually wanna hear me bitch about my day? Don\u2019t you need to eat dinner?\nDeku: oh don\u2019t worry! I ran of the conbini and got dinner (\u30ce\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\u30ce\nKaboomKing: You\u2026 went to the conbini? You didn\u2019t make dinner?\nDeku: I\u2019m kinda a real bad cook, I\u2019ll be honest. I try my best but I can only make basic stuff. So the conbini is the best answer most days. Plus I don\u2019t eat too much anyways.\u00a0\nKaboomKing; The fuck??? You should be eating better! Going to the damn conbini this late. That\u2019s not only dangerous but you need a proper cooked meal you dickhead\nDeku: (\u25d5\ufe35\u25d5) weeeeh Kacchan scary!\nKaboomKing: Kacchan???\nDeku: Thought it might be cute. Idk. You need some kinda nickname since Kaboom isn\u2019t exactly a name. So I shortened it to Kacchan (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727\nKaboomKing: That\u2019s so dumb\nDeku: Awww\u2026 well I don\u2019t gotta use it\nKaboomKing: Naw. Use it. I don\u2019t fuckin care\nDeku: Kacchan it is then! (\u273f\u25e0\u203f\u25e0)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s face was burning up. Sure as a kid he has been called Kacchan but other kids, but reading it now as a grown adult? Given to him by some cute nerd? It felt so different.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome weird feeling rose in Katsuki, wanting to make the nerd proper meals, walk him to the store so he\u2019d be safe, make sure he was healthy and fine.\n\u00a0\nFuck he was in deep.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: So about your bad day, what exactly happened? I don\u2019t mean to pry.\u00a0\nKaboomKing: It\u2019s fine. I work for a big company, and we gotta do a lot of physical shit along with paperwork. So I was busy doing a ton of labor intensive BS all day then once that was over and I thought I could finally go home and rest my sore muscles I got tossed a stupidly huge amount of paperwork.\nKaboomKing: It fucking felt endless. I was trapped there for 3 more hours just filling out stupid shit. And I know for a fact there\u2019s gonna be more on my desk when I get there tomorrow. Because of fucking course there is.\nKaboomKing: So by the time I got home I wanted to physically melt into my bed and forget I existed\nDeku: Oh god. That sounds like an absolute nightmare to deal with!\nKaboomKing: yeah. It is. I got into this job and didn\u2019t once think there\u2019d be so much stupid paperwork.\u00a0\nKaboomKing: it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t fuckin do it. Cause I can. I\u2019m amazing! But sitting and doing that shit for hours when I could be using my time to be out in the field is some BS!\nDeku: So you prefer hands on work instead?\nKaboomKing: Damn right! I\u2019m strong and can do more with my hands!\nDeku: hfjwjdjsj\u00a0\nKaboomKing: What???\nDeku: Sorry! It\u2019s laughing basically!\nKaboomKing: I know! But what are you laughing at??\nDeku: I don\u2019t know, just something about that sentence made me giggle. It\u2019s kinda cute in a funny way. Fienjfjwjrw\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nCute\u2026? Deku thought something he did was cute? Oh if Katsuki wasn\u2019t blushing before he sure as hell was now!! Oh he was SO fucked!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: Cute?\nDeku: Oh sorry!! That might be weird to you!\u00a0\nDeku: (\u2299\ufe4f\u2299\u273f) I didn\u2019t mean it in a mean way! Or was trying to make this weird!\nKaboomKing: Nah, you\u2019re fine. Just not use to people calling shit I do \u201ccute\u201d\nDeku: What do people usually say?\nKaboomKing: That I\u2019m scary.\nDeku: Really\u2026?\nKaboomKing: Yep. I\u2019m 6\u20193, and constantly have a pissed off look on my face. I swear a lot and don\u2019t usually care what people think of me. So people tend to be intimidated.\nDeku: hmmm\u2026. Well, you seem perfectly nice to me. And very sweet.\u00a0\nDeku: it\u2019s not often that people yell at my twitch viewers to stop being creepy. Even my mods can be a little scared to do it haha\nKaboomKing: I have 0 energy for fuckheads\u00a0\nDeku: That's quite the word!\nKaboomKing: I have a lot of 'em.\nDeku: I can tell~\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nWhat the fuck was happening? Was this flirting? No, there\u2019s no way. No. This is just Deku being nice. Don\u2019t read too into it. Just calm the fuck down Katsuki.\n\u00a0\nWith a deep inhale, Katsuki looked over at the clock, 9:23. It was getting late and Katsuki needed to sleep. He really enjoyed talking to this guy, which was rare for him. Most people pissed him off or were annoying. Even his best friend was someone he mostly put up with.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nKaboomKing: Yo, nerd ass. I need to get some sleep. Was actually nice talking to you. Most people honestly annoy me but you\u2019re not too bad. Might poke your brain more on quirk stuff if you don\u2019t hate that idea.\nDeku: (\uff61\u2665\u203f\u2665\uff61) Waaaah really?! That\u2019d be amazing! Alright Kacchan, sleep well! Get lots of good sleep. You deserve it.\nKaboomKing: Night nerd\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nWith that, Katsuki powered off this computer and moved to bed. This wasn\u2019t at all how he thought his night was gonna go but here he was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll he could think about were those gorgeous viridian eyes and that soft tangle of hair. He wondered how many freckles the boy had. How long it\u2019d take to count each individual one, watching Deku giggle as he got close to count. His cheeks red from embarrassment. Those long dark lashes fluttering each time he let out a giggle.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was in deep, but lucky for him. He was a good swimmer.\u00a0\nIzuku Midoriya, your average quirkless 22 year old that attended college. He was a great student with a 4.0, he\u2019d gained praise from all of his teachers for how bright his mind is. He was smart, analytical, and good at reading people.\n\u00a0\nSo tell him why some guy that he met in his stream made his brain turn to mush and his hands tremble at each message he sent. Who the hell was KaboomKing and why did he randomly decide to stop by his stream and drop so much money?!\n\u00a0\nIzuku laid in bed, his mind going a mile a minute. He was so extremely grateful for what the stranger had done, and honestly couldn\u2019t thank him enough. It was perfectly reasonable to DM someone that did something so generous. But what he wasn\u2019t expecting was for the two to hit it off so easily. Kacchan swore a lot, sure. But he was funny and pretty easy to talk to all things considered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku had always struggled to talk to people, most people tended to scare him or were just plain rude to him. Especially after finding out he was quirkless. Growing up wasn\u2019t exactly easy because of it, but as an adult he\u2019s tried to own it. Sure he couldn\u2019t be a hero in the sense he wanted but he was pretty happy with his life now. He had grown an equally nerdy audience and they all accepted him for his quirklessness. And anytime someone came into chat to spout bigotry his audience was quick to shut it down.\n\u00a0\nIzuku sighed, rolling around in his bed. He didn\u2019t think his life was gonna turn out like this, but here he was. He was happy. Even if his dear mom was sick, she was slowly getting better and improving each day. Things were gonna be okay.\n\u00a0\nWrapping himself in his sheets, Izuku slowly closed his eyes to get some sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-6:10am KaboomKing: Hey nerd ass, you up?7:40am KaboomKing: I\u2019m off to work, pray it's not another shit day.8:22am KaboomKing: Damn bitch you sleep late.9:15am KaboomKing: The fuck10:34am Deku: Kacchan! Sorry! Haha! \u00d4\u30ee\u00f4 class doesn\u2019t start until around 11am for me10:35am Deku: Wow you woke up early!! (\u25cf\u2312\u2207\u2312\u25cf)10:37am KaboomKing: Yeah, I go to the gym when I wake up. Less people there to annoy me.10:39am Deku: Whoa!! \uff08\u2609\u2200\u2609\uff09 You go to the gym that early? And after you wake up?!10:42am KaboomKing: Duh. I gotta stay fit, dork ass. Not all of us are scrawny nerds.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help but feel his face heat up. He remembered from last night that Kacchan had mentioned being tall and having a physical job. But the guy was buff too? What did he even look like? Izuku couldn\u2019t help but wonder who this mysterious man was.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Excuse you! I\u2019ll have you know I work out!KaboomKing: Oh yeah? Doing what? Lifting pens for your nerd shit?Deku: Ruuuuude! o(\u2267o\u2266)o I go to the gym a few times a week!KaboomKing: A few times a week? Weak shitDeku: Hey! I\u2019m busy most days with school, streaming, and checking in on my mom \u22cb_\u22ccDeku: I only have so many hours in the day, we can\u2019t all be you mister swolKaboomKing: Alright, that got a laugh out of me.KaboomKing: Fuck you.Deku: (\u25e1\u03c9\u25e1\u273f) one point to Deku, zero points to KacchanKaboomKing: Fuck you x2Deku: \u10da(\u2579\u03b5\u2579\u10da) You gonna fight me now?KaboomKing: I\u2019d absolutely destroy your nerd assDeku: Naw, I\u2019d win. \u25d53\u25d5   KaboomKing: Hah?! I\u2019ve SEEN you on stream. You\u2019re so scrawny! How tall even are you?Deku: (*~\u25bd~) uhhhhKaboomKing: uhhhh?Deku: (\u00b4\u30fc\uff40) umKaboomKing: You gonna say? Or just keep me waiting?Deku: 5\u20195\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026KaboomKing: You\u2019re shitting me.Deku: (\u114c\u1d17\u114c* )KaboomKing: You\u2019re so fucking short.Deku: \u0ca5_\u0ca5 I\u2019m not! I\u2019m just a little below average is all.KaboomKing: Y\u2019know what they call that right? Short.Deku: Oh shut up, Mr. 6\u20193. Not all of us can be tall \u2609\u25b5\u2609\u51f8KaboomKing: What the fresh hell is that emoji even???Deku: \u2609\u25b5\u2609\u51f8\u00a0 \u2609\u25b5\u2609\u51f8 \u00a0 \u2609\u25b5\u2609\u51f8KaboomKing: Oh fuck offDeku: No~ (\u25d5\u203f-)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help but giggle as he typed to Kacchan in his DM\u2019s. The stranger was pretty funny and had a rather short temper, which honestly only made Izuku laugh more. He didn\u2019t have any fear talking to Kacchan since he was so playful, so the snarky angry comments just filled Izuku\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\nHe was usually so anxious around people and tended to keep to himself. But for some reason Kacchan helped him be more himself, open up some and even show off his sassy side.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: Alright, Kacchan. I gotta go for a bit. My train is nearly at my stop.KaboomKing: WaitDeku: Huh?KaboomKing: Did you eat breakfast?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s face started to heat up at that. Did\u2026 Did Kacchan care? Was he worried about Izuku?\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Uhhhh about that. HahaKaboomKing: Are you shitting me right now Deku?!Deku: ListennnnnDeku: I was busy! And didn\u2019t have time!KaboomKing: ExcusesDeku: o(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)o Weeeeh Kacchan scaryKaboomKing: Kacchan gonna shove his foot up your ass if you don\u2019t eat!Deku: \u2510(\u2018\uff5e`\uff1b)\u250c I don\u2019t even eat at this time thouuuugh. I always end up eating when I get home.KaboomKing: Which is when\u2026?Deku: u-uhhhDeku: Like 8pmKabomKing: WHATDeku: Oh geez, my train is here. Man. I uhhh gotta go. Talk to you later Kacchan (\u25cf\u00b4\u03c9\uff40\u25cf)KaboomKing: FUCKER!!! NO!! GET BACK HERE!!KaboomKing: Are you fucking telling me you eat ONCE a damn day?!KaboomKing: DEKU I WEAR TO FUCKING GOD!KaboomKing: I\u2019m gonna fucking doordash you food or something what the FUCK!!KaboomKing: When you get back you\u2019re gonna have HELL to pay!!Deku: \u2665KabomKing: YOU MOTHERFUCKER\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKatsuki ran his hands down his face, staring at his phone. Unbelievable! So his fears were correct, the nerd IS indeed terrible at taking care of himself. Now his next worry was if he was properly sleeping if he already didn\u2019t eat well. He had noticed bags under his eyes when he was streaming but he didn\u2019t pay too much mind to it, figuring maybe it was just discoloration or maybe that specific night he didn\u2019t sleep.\n\u00a0\nBut now he was starting to wonder. After all, Deku did say he was extremely busy. Between school, streaming, checking in on his mother, and still making time to work out, the dudes schedule was ridiculous.\n\u00a0\nHis classes also went on pretty late, it got Katsuki wondering what the little nerd was studying for. What job did he want after college, what plans did he have for his future? And fuck why did Katsuki care so much?!\n\u00a0\nWhatever. Those were questions for later. He needed to get back to work.\n-------\n\u00a0\nIzuku tucked his phone into his pocket and made his way to class. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at how much Kacchan seemed to care. They had only met yesterday but the guy seemed so kind to him, and he didn\u2019t know why. He remembered how Kacchan had said other people found him scary, which only made his nickname cuter. He was imagining some buff 6\u20193 man with angry fiery eyes and a scowl on his face answering back to Kacchan. The thought alone made Izuku nearly burst out laughing, it was too precious.\n\u00a0\nThe man may have said he intimidated people, but all Izuku could see was a gentle giant. A gentle giant that swore a lot however. Like a wild wolf that could rip out your throat, but also liked belly rubs and was very protective. Izuku giggled at the thought.\n\u00a0\n------\n\u00a0\nMost of the day had gone by in utter boredom. Katsuki took down some low level villains and over all not much had happened. Which to most heroes would be a good thing, but for Katsuki it was absolute hell. And not only that but the cute green bean he had started talking to was busy in class doing who knows what, so he couldn\u2019t even annoy him.\n\u00a0\nSince yesterday his thought were filled by those stupid ocean green eyes, those dumb freckles that spread across his tanned cheeks, the way his hair bounced around while he talk, his-\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, DynaMight!\u201d Katsuki was snapped out of his train of thought.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShitty hair\u2026\u201d Katsuki growled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey! Its Red Riot! C\u2019mon man.\u201d Kirishima sighed, though he didn\u2019t look annoyed. Honestly, he rarely ever did. Dude was like sunshine if it was a person. \u201cYou looked distracted, you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep. Just bored out of my damn mind is all.\u201d Katsuki grumbled as the two patrolled. Today was too damn slow for Katsuki\u2019s liking. Hell at this rate he\u2019d prefer to be home taking a nap or at the gym.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, a slow patrol is a good sign! Means there isn\u2019t a lot of villain activity so civilians are safe.\u201d Kirishima beamed, his brightness nearly blinding. God, fuck that guy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Was all that Katsuki said, trying to keep his mind sharp. It was then that his phone started buzzing.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki pulled his phone from his pocket and checked his messages. He was well aware he shouldn\u2019t while on patrol, but he figured hey, fucking nothing is happening and he might have a message from that damn nerd.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Alright alright, here. Happy?Deku: [Attached is a picture of Katsudon]Deku: [Attached is a selfie]\n\n\n\nDeku: I\u2019d usually study through lunch but because sooooomeone got upset\u2026Deku: I decided to actually get lunch this time.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared at his phone for a few moments, looking at the photos that Deku had sent. He looked too damn cute. And now that Katsuki could get a close up picture of him instead of the shitty webcam Deku had been using he could see even MORE details.\n\u00a0\nDeku had even more freckles than Katsuki had been able to see last night, his eyelashes were a mish mash of dark green and black, all of them extremely long. It made his already gigantic eyes much more pronounced on his face. Deku had a pretty andorgoynous face because of it. It made him honestly look like he had makeup on, but Katsuki figured it was all natural. Hell, makeup might just be overkill with how pretty he\u2019d look. Oh no, now Katsuki\u2019s mind was wondering\u2026\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s heart was fluttering in his chest from the images. He was glad Deku took his threat- I mean words to heart and actually grabbed some food. The guy was too scrawny for his own good, and needed some meat on his bones.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: You got rice on your face, nerd ass.Deku: (\u25d5\ufe35\u25d5) Weeeh I didn\u2019t even notice!KaboomKing: That\u2019s why you need me. Point out rice and other shit on your nerd face.Deku: (\u25cf\u00b4\u03c9\uff40\u25cf) Guess I\u2019ll keep Kacchan around then~KaboomKing: You guess? Tch.Deku: \u30fe(\u3003^\u2207^)\uff89 Not entirely sure yet. Maybe you\u2019re secretly a serial killer! Dun dun dun!KaboomKing: I wouldn\u2019t waste my time on a nerd like you if I wasDeku: Saying I\u2019m not worth killing? (\u25d5\ufe35\u25d5)KaboomKing: NopeDeku: How cruel. Or kind? Hmmm\u2026.KaboomKing: I\u2019ll let you think on that one.Deku: Wow, thanks.Deku: How's work by the way?KaboomKing: Boring as shit. Nothin\u2019 is happening so I\u2019m just wandering around with shitty hair.Deku: Shitty hair???KaboomKing: A co-worker of mine. I GUESS he\u2019s my friend or whatever.Deku: Why do you call him shitty hair???KaboomKing: Cause his hair is shitty, you see.Deku: Oh, of course of course. Makes sense.KaboomKing: Yep. I\u2019m a genius with nicknames. I know.Deku: Oh truly. What a big brain you have Kacchan.KaboomKing: The biggest.Deku: So you\u2019re saying you have a big head..?KaboomKing: Oh fuck you.Deku: \uff8d(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3*)\uff89 heheheheheDeku: I\u2019m slowly painting a picture of how Kacchan might look.Deku: Tall, muscular, and a giant head.Deku: Very unique looking person.KaboomKing: Fuck you x2!KaboomKing: I\u2019m fucking hot, I\u2019ll have you know.Deku: mmmmmm sure~~KaboomKing: Your ass is grass, Deku!Deku: Um! Actually my HAIR is grass.KaboomKing: Alright, fuck you again. That actually made me laugh.KaboomKing: And now shitty hair is wondering what the fuck I\u2019m laughing at.KaboomKing: I fucking hate youDeku: \u2605~(\u25e1\u203f\u25d5\u273f) So you say~\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki let out another soft chuckle, Kirishima squinting more at his friend. This was something entirely new for the redhead to witness. Was Katsuki seriously laughing at something? Not just his usually threatening laugh he did at villains, no. A genuine soft laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cS-so\u2026:\u201d Kirishima clears his throat. \u201cWhatcha laughin\u2019 at? Something funny on your phone?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat brought Katsuki back to reality. He angrily shoved his phone back into his pocket and shot daggers at the redhead.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's none of your business shitty hair.\u201d Katsuki growled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh, sorry man. I just haven\u2019t seen you so\u2026 well.\u201d Kirishima tried to pick his words carefully. \u201cSoft I guess?\u201d\u201cSoft?!\u201dClearly the wrong wording! Oh no! \u201cWell, like. I only ever hear you laugh when you\u2019re about to win a battle, or taunting your enemy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHah?! I laugh at other shit too!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot from what I\u2019ve heard!\u201d Kirishima waves his arms in front of his face, the man looking nervous. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a little shocked is all. Kinda curious what would make my friend look so gentle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck off. I don\u2019t look fuckin\u2019 gentle or whatever the fuck it is you\u2019re on about. Your brain really is just full of hair if you think I\u2019m actin\u2019 soft or gentle. Fuck off with that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKirishima lets out a soft laugh. \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d He clearly wasn't getting any answers this way. Might as well drop the issue for now.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nStretching out his back, Izuku was finally done for the day with class and he could go home and relax a bit before studying more. It was exhausting but it\u2019d all be worth it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe greenette stood and gathered his things before heading to the bus station, but before he was even out the door he heard that familiar notification sound.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: You done with class now?Deku: Yep~! \u2605~(\u25e0\u203f\u25d5\u273f) Heading to the train now.KaboomKing: By yourself?Deku: Yeah, hahaKaboomKing: Why not get a friend to walk with you?? Kinda dangerous.Deku: OhDeku: Well uhhhDeku: See that\u2019s the thing is uhhDeku: I don\u2019t really have any friends hahaKaboomKing: Hah\u2026???Deku: LikeDeku: I know people, but none of them are really my friends?Deku: No one really talks to me outside of class.KaboomKing: Fucking why???Deku: Idk. Maybe cause I\u2019m quirkless? Maybe cause I talk too much?Deku: Maybe they just find me annoying, haha.Deku: But likeDeku: Its fine!Deku: I\u2019m honestly pretty use to it so I don\u2019t really mind.KaboomKing is typing\u2026..KaboomKing is typing\u2026\u2026..\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Katsuki\u2019s hands hovered over his phone's keyboard. What the fuck do you say in this kinda situation? He was never good with feelings, let alone helping people with THEIR feelings.But fuck.\n\u00a0\nAnd one thing that kept pulling at him. \u201cMaybe cause I\u2019m qurikless?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWas Deku bullied for being quirkless? Shit of course he was. Katsuki wasn\u2019t an idiot. Back in school he used to pick on the very few quirkless kids he knew. He was pretty relentless about it too. The thought made Katsuki\u2019s stomach turn, he imagined soft emeralds staring up at him. Tears running down soft freckled cheeks.\u201cKacchan\u2026 Why are you being so mean?\u201d The smaller boy would cry out, trying his best to seem tough.\u201cQuirkless Deku, can\u2019t even protect himself!\u201d The blonde would laugh, shoving the greenette to the ground.\n\u00a0\nIn another lifetime, another world, Katsuki would have been his bully. Would have treated the poor kid like shit. And he knew it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDuring his second year of high school Katsuki had started anger management and therapy to help with his emotional state. It did him a lot of good, even if the entire experience sucked. But he needed it. He needed to be told his behavior was shit and he needed to improve.\n\u00a0\nAnd Katsuki was never one to half ass something, even if it was just therapy. And improve he did. He wasn\u2019t perfect by any means, but he was a hell of a lot calmer now in his 20\u2019s. He didn\u2019t snap at people as much, he could calm down far easier. He wanted to be a better person than he was as a kid.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared down at his phone, swallowing the lump in his throat and decided to ask a question he might regret.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: Were you bullied as a kid for being quirkless?\nDeku is typing\u2026\u2026.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: Were you bullied as a kid for being quirkless?\nDeku is typing\u2026\u2026.Deku is typing\u2026\u2026.\nDeku: Yeah\u2026 hahaDeku: Actually, that\u2019s where I got the nickname.KaboomKing: Huh??Deku: The name Deku. My actual name can be read like that, so uh\u2026Deku: A few kids started calling me Useless DekuDeku: Since Deku means useless\u2026 haha\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s heart sank. Why the hell was this guy using Deku as a nickname when it was what his bullies used to call him? What the fuck was wrong with him?!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: Why would you keep going by Deku then?Deku: Well, I wanted to turn it into a positive.Deku: Prove to them that I wasn\u2019t useless or worthless.Deku: A lot of the kids were pretty relentless. One in particular really hated me.Deku: I used to carry around notebooks that I\u2019d fill with analysis on quirks and heroes.Deku: I\u2019d spent most of my time writing in them.Deku: One day some of the kids came by and threw one of them out the window.Deku: One kid even told me to off myself.Deku: It wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 easy\u2026Deku: But I\u2019m in a lot better place now, and I\u2019m okay with not having a quirk!Deku: I found other ways I could help people, so it's fine now!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-There was something about how Deku typed. Like he was lying to himself just to keep going. The greenette clearly wasn\u2019t fine, and clearly still wanted to be a hero and have a quirk. Katsuki may be bad with emotions but he wasn\u2019t stupid. Deku wanted something far beyond what he could have, and that alone broke Katsuki\u2019s heart.\n\u00a0\nDeku was so open and honest. But he also didn\u2019t want others to feel bad or pity him. He wore his heart on his sleeves, but even then\u2026 He clearly kept a wall up for others.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but feel drawn to this man, like fate itself was pulling him closer and closer. He wanted to know more about the pretty green haired boy, he wanted to know his thoughts and feelings. He couldn\u2019t explain it but something about him just beckoned him closer and closer.\n\u00a0\nWithout even properly thinking, Katsuki started to type.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: It's not fine.Deku: Excuse me?KaboomKing: You\u2019re not fine with it. I can tell.KaboomKing: Deku, its okay to be upset at this kinda shit.KaboomKing: You don\u2019t gotta act like it doesn\u2019t suck.KaboomKing: It's okay to not be okay.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku stared at his phone in absolute shock. For a second he was mad, he felt a little betrayed at Kacchan for saying something like that. But then he felt\u2026 almost relieved? Relieved that someone could see past his bullshit and understand something that even Izuku didn\u2019t fully grasp about himself.\n\u00a0\nIzuku rubbed at his eyes trying to get the tears to stop as he made his way to his train. No sense worrying strangers cause he was crying on the train, that\u2019d just be rude. And probably a little weird.\n\u00a0\nWith a shaky breath, Izuku tried to gather his thoughts. What do you even say in this situation? \u201cNo I\u2019m fine.\u201d \u201cWell duh its okay not to be okay.\u201d \u201cShut up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Yeah\u2026\nDeku: I uh\u2026Deku: That easy to tell huh?KaboomKing: You\u2019re clearly very passionate about heroes.KaboomKing: You\u2019re allowed to be pissed off at the world, DekuKaboomKing: Hell I know I would beDeku: Yeah\u2026Deku: I use to try and test out different things to see if I could summon a quirk hahaDeku: I\u2019d try to breathe fire (cause my dad can) or levitate things (cause my mom can)Deku: I\u2019d read up on how other people\u2019s quirks appeared and would try doing what they did.Deku: How lame is that? hahaKaboomKing: It's kinda cute.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Izuku nearly dropped his phone at that. Cute\u2026? Cute?! He thought the dorky stuff he did as a kid was cute?! For real?!\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s entire face was bright red as he stared down at his phone. He couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just read. It was probably just some silly comment, don\u2019t think too into it. You JUST met the guy and he\u2019s just being polite. Calm DOWN Izuku!!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it \u201ccute\u201d, maybe pathetic.KaboomKing: I\u2019m imagining a young Deku with wild green hair everywhere, probably in some All Might t-shirt, running around trying to activate a quirk. Probably tripping on his own feet and getting skid marks everywhere.Deku: That\u2019s\u2026 Actually extremely accurate.KaboomKing: HahDeku: Hah?KaboomKing: It's just kinda cute to think about.Deku: What about you? What were you like as a kid?KaboomKing: I was a shithead.KaboomKing: I bullied kids that didn\u2019t deserve it, I was loud and too proud for my own good.KaboomKing: Got to go through the joy of \u201cgifted child burn out\u201d in my teens.Deku: You were a \u201cgifted child\u201d?KaboomKing: Yep. Had perfect grades I barely had to work for, a pretty cool quirk I could show off, and everyone praised me for everything I did.KaboomKing: Made me into a real shithead.KaboomKing: Around high school I was forced into anger management and therapy for my shit behavior.KaboomKing: Its not perfect per se, but I\u2019m doing a lot better than I was as a kid.Deku: You seem nice to me (\u30ce\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\u30ceKaboomKing: I\u2019m nicer to you.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Oh God. There it is. Those words that make Izuku\u2019s stomach do backflips inside of him. Nicer to me?! What does that even mean?!\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s mind was going a million miles per hour, in his chaotic brain fog he nearly missed his stop and quickly ran out of the train. The cool winter air was a blessing from how embarrassed Izuku felt, his face now bright red. He didn\u2019t even know much about Kacchan but every time they talked his stupid heart felt like it was going to explode.\n\u00a0\nHe never would have thought the nice donor he met yesterday in his stream would keep talking to him, let alone be so interesting and make Izuku\u2019s heart flutter in his chest every time he got a notification.\n\u00a0\nJust calm down Izuku. Don\u2019t be stupid. Be rational. You barely know this guy so there\u2019s no point in getting a crush on some stranger you just met. That\u2019d just be dumb.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nIzuku had finally made it to his apartment after a short 15 minute walk in the cold. It honestly did him some good to just breathe and calm down from his and Kacchans conversation. Izuku entered his apartment, and slowly took off his shoes and sat down his backpack.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d The greenette called out to no one.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t sure why he did this. Maybe a habit from living with his mom? Maybe it just made him feel less alone? Who knows.\n\u00a0\nIzuku opened up his phone to see he had a few missed messages from Kacchan, and noticed the poor guy seemed a little worried by the silence.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: You good?KaboomKing: Did you get murdered or something..?KaboomKing: Hello\u2026?Deku: Sorry! I was walking back home from the train, didn\u2019t mean to worry you!KaboomKing: Tch, I wasn\u2019t worried.Deku: yeaaaah, sure. (\u0398\u03b5\u0398)KaboomKing: Anyways!KaboomKing: You better not forget to eat dinner, idiot.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku honestly hadn\u2019t even thought about dinner. He was busy thinking about the assignments he needed to finish, plans for his next stream, and other work that desperately needed done.\n\u00a0\nIzuku stared at the time. 8:35. It was already getting pretty late, but he could probably go to the conbini and pick up a simple dinner. Maybe just a few rice balls and coffee.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: I honestly hadn\u2019t even thought about dinner aaaKaboomKing: Are you serious?!Deku: Was thinking about homework I gotta do and stream stuff hahaKaboomKing: The fuck are you even studying at school??Deku: Oh!Deku: I\u2019m gonna be a nurse (\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*:\uff65\uff9f\u2727KaboomKing: A nurse?Deku: Yeah! Since I\u2019m quirkless I figured I could save lives another way (^\u25bd^)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was in the locker room of the HQ he worked at, now changing back into his civilian clothes. He stared down at his phone, picturing Deku in cute nurse scrubs. Wafting about the hospital to help those in need, bringing the brightest smile in the world to the sick.\n\u00a0\nThe thought brought a soft smile to Katsuki\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: So you\u2019d get to wear dorky scrubs?Deku: They\u2019re not dorky!Deku: Okay\u2026 They\u2019re a little dorky\u2026KaboomKing: Extremely dorky.Deku: But! I\u2019d be helping people in my own way! And that\u2019s what matters!KaboomKing: Nerd\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku let out a soft chuckle at that. Yeah, Kacchan was right. He was indeed a nerd. But he was proud of his nerdiness!\n\u00a0\nNow, back to the task at hand. Dinner. With a sigh, Izuku started putting back on his winter attire and shoes, then grabbing his phone to tell Kacchan he was indeed getting dinner.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Brb, going to the conbini for dinner.KaboomKing: Fucking what?KaboomKing: Are you shitting me? You\u2019re going back to the stupid conbini??Deku: (\u114c\u1d17\u114c* ) y-yes\u2026KaboomKing: Its nearly 9pm!Deku: I\u2019ll be fine~KaboomKing: You\u2019re a 5\u20195 shrimp ass nerd. Someone could just pick you up and put you in their damn pocket.Deku: What??KaboomKing: Fuck it, I\u2019ll just give you money to fucking order food.Deku: Kacchan I\u2019m okay, really! I do this all the time, and nothing bad has ever happened.KaboomKing: Your Venmo. Hand it over.Deku: Nooooo, you\u2019ve given me enough money!!KaboomKing: I\u2019ll go through your twitch if I have to, nerd ass.Deku: Hhhhhhh, fine\u2026. Thank you Kacchan\u2026KaboomKing: No problem.KaboomKing: I have one request however.Deku: Huh?KaboomKing: Take a picture once it arrives so I fucking know you\u2019re eating dinner.Deku: lol, okay Kacchan (*^ -^*)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nAfter typing Kacchan his Venmo he gets a pretty instant notification, and oh GOD he nearly drops his phone.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a520,000 Sent From KaboomKing To Deku\n\u00a0\nIzuku stared at his phone in complete and utter shock. That\u2019s way too much! How much did he think food delivery cost?!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Kacchan!!!Deku: That\u2019s way too much! I can\u2019t accept this!KaboomKing: Damn bitch that sucks, cause that's your money now.Deku: Are you for real??KaboomKing: As real as they get.KaboomKing: Order some food, idiot.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nWith a short laugh, Izuku accepted his fate and ordered some food. To literally no one's surprise, he ordered Katsudon, his favorite.\n\u00a0\nOnce the food arrived, Izuku sat at his kitchen table, practically drooling over it. He pulled out his phone and took a picture of the food, then him taking a bite. Hopefully that would suffice for Kacchan.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: It arrives!!Deku: [Attached a picture of Katsudon]Deku: SEE! Look I\u2019m eating dinner (\u251b\u25c9\u0414\u25c9)\u251b\u5f61\u253b\u2501\u253bDeku: [Attached a Selfie]\n\n\n\nIt was another selfie. Fuck. Katsuki\u2019s face lit up like a Christmas tree on fire! And was that his own merch?? Fuck! Play it cool! Play it cool! Don\u2019t let him know you\u2019re excited he\u2019s in your own merch.\n\u00a0\nFuck he looks so good in orange and black. He\u2019s practically Halloween colors. Fuck. Katsuki was so FUCKED. He\u2019d known this guy for barely 2 days and every time he saw him or talked to him his heart melted. How fucking dare Deku be this cute. Fuck him.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: Katsudon again??Deku: It's my favorite!KaboomKing: You need some fucking vegeatables or something, Jesus Christ!Deku: It has\u2026 green onion on it\u2026.KaboomKing: NOT GOOD ENOUGH!Deku: (\u25d5\ufe35\u25d5) But tasty\u2026KaboomKing: Fuck off with that. Your scrawny ass needs proper food.Deku: o(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)o WeeeehKaboomKing: I\u2019m gonna kick your ass, holy shit.Deku: Well, there\u2019s a lot of space to do so.KaboomKing: \u2026..KaboomKing: Wh\u2026 WhatDeku: (\u25cf\u00b4\u03c9\uff40\u25cf) Nevermind\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki smashed his head into his pillow at that last comment. This guy was going to be the fucking death of him. He just knew it.\n\u00a0\nBut GOD DAMN was it going to be a wonderful death.\n\u00a0\n-------\n\u00a0\nIzuku finished up his dinner and went to his room to study, still messaging Kacchan until he finally went to bed around 11pm. Izuku however stayed up until 3am trying to finish the rest of his homework and study for finals. Tomorrow he needed to stream, and he had ideas.\n\u00a0\nBut those had to wait until later once his brain had some sleep. Izuku crawled in bed, exhausted and sore from sitting at his desk. His bed wasn\u2019t exactly the softest thing but it did its job. Izuku wrapped himself in his childhood All Might blanket and finally passed out, exhaustion taking hold.\n\u00a0\n-------\n\u00a0\nWaking up to the sound of his alarm blaring, Izuku sat up groggy and annoyed. It was 11:30am, Izuku usually let himself sleep in just a bit on his streaming days since he stayed up so late the night prior. He slowly rose out of bed and wandered into the kitchen for some much needed coffee. Checking his phone he saw a bunch of notifications from none other than Kacchan.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-6:02am KaboomKing: Hey shithead, you awake?6:20am KaboomKing: I\u2019ll take that as a no. Why the fuck do you wake up so late??8:23am KaboomKing: Finished my workout, you up yet nerd ass?8:40am KaboomKing: Deku &gt;:( Get a better sleep schedule!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help but laugh. An emoji?? This was the first time he\u2019d seen Kacchan use one! How cute. Kacchan was being really cute.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n10:20am KaboomKing: Shitty hair won\u2019t stop asking who I\u2019m messaging all day. Fuckin\u2019 annoying. Dude needs to stay out of my shit.10:50am KaboomKing: Is it illegal to murder your own friend for being a snooping piece of shit? Cause it's starting to feel deserved.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku snorted at the last message. Oh Kacchan, you dork. The freckled boy started up his coffee maker, and for once actually looked in the fridge to see if he had anything for breakfast. He had eggs and a few random things in there to make a half decent omelette.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile he was preparing breakfast, Izuku grabbed his phone to shoot Kacchan message to hopefully help the man wanna murder his friend less.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Well good morning to you~KaboomKing: Fucking hell, you\u2019re finally awake.Deku: Someone seems needy. You\u2019ve known me for 2 days lolKaboomKing: Oh fuck off. You\u2019re the least annoying person I talk to.Deku: I have great news. I\u2019m actually making breakfast for once.KaboomKing: Deadass? Wow.Deku: I know~! I\u2019m preeeeetty cool.KaboomKing: Alright nerd ass, dial it back.Deku: Never~\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nNearly 3 weeks had passed since the two started talking to each other. It was a constant and daily thing for the two to send each other memes, text late into the night, and of course every time Izuku streamed Katsuki was there to yet again throw money at him.\n\u00a0\nHe needed to maintain that Top Donor status.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy now the chat knew who \u201cKacchan\u201d was, and the others would tease him in chat. Katsuki didn\u2019t pay them much mind though. He was too enraptured by the green beauty that could talk his ear off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEven if he was at work filling out paperwork, if he saw that notification he would grab his earbuds and start watching the stream. It was honestly amazing how quickly the man's voice could calm him down. He\u2019d go from raging at paperwork and how stupid everything was, to having a soft smile on his face, his eyes gentle and endearing.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d watch as Deku went on a long tirade about heroes, sometimes muttering to himself and stopping before apologizing to the audience. It was honestly one of the highlights of Katsuki\u2019s week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe two felt inseparable at this point.\nThis was all until one day, one of Katsuki\u2019s biggest fears had finally happened. It was now over a month since the two had started talking, or rather, texting. See, no actual words had been shared between them. It was all text.\n\u00a0\nOne day, it seemed Deku wanted something a bit more than that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: Hey Kacchan~ (~\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)~KaboomKing: What nerdDeku: You wanna play Stardrew Valley together? We could voice chat and just hang out.Deku: That is if you want to! I\u2019m sure Stardew isn\u2019t exactly your speed for games.Deku: But we could just hang out and chat. Make a little farm together.Deku: Honestly, I\u2019m pretty curious how you sound haha.Deku: We\u2019ve been friends over a month and a half now but never voice chatted.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki sat at his desk nervously twiddling his fingers. This was bad.\n\u00a0\nUp until now he had kept his identity a complete secret, and Deku seemed pretty okay with it. He never pried into his life, which honestly Katsuki appreciated a lot. He was clearly curious but didn\u2019t want to over step things.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki actively wanted to voice chat with Deku however. But the issue now was his voice. He had such a recognizable voice that anyone with two brain cells could figure out who he was.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared at his monitor trying to figure out what to even say. He wanted to hear Deku\u2019s voice just talk to him, just say his own stupid nickname to him and not an audience.\n\u00a0\nBut on the other hand\u2026 What if he figured out who he actually was? Would that be so bad\u2026?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFuck this was too much for Katsuki to think about.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: I don\u2019t have a mic for my PC.Deku: Oh heck. Really??KaboomKing: Never needed one.Deku: Aww\u2026 we could call on your phone?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nFuck, he completely forgot about his phone!\n\u00a0\nMaybe the shit mic quality would mask his voice? And if he wasn\u2019t yelling and just talking calmly Deku might not even realize who he is. No, this could work. This could for sure work.\n\u00a0\nWith shaky hands, Katsuki typed out his message.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: That might work\u2026KaboomKing: I need to buy and download this game though. Where the fuck do I get it??Deku: Oh! On steam! I can just gift it to you. Hang on let me get the links to help you out~!Deku: Its really fun! I promise! You can murder things in the game too so don\u2019t worry!KaboomKing: PFFFFT. Thank you for your consideration, Deku.Deku: Any time~\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nAfter 30 frustrating minutes Katsuki had gotten a steam account, gotten the game, downloaded it and was ready to play whatever the fuck Deku had wanted him to get. Katsuki could honestly care less what the game was, he cared more about the fact he could hear the dumb nerds voice privately.\n\u00a0\nThe thought alone had his ears feeling warm. Just him and Deku in a call. Alone. Why the hell did this make him feel so flustered? It's just another guy he befriended online. Calm down Katsuki!\n\u00a0\nWith bated breath Katsuki stared at his phone, preparing for Deku to call him. His phone lit up with Deku\u2019s icon on the screen and an accept or decline button.\n\u00a0\nNervously, Katsuki clicked accept. This was it. No going back now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan?\u201d Deku\u2019s voice came through his earbuds.\n\u00a0\nOh no. Oh no.\n\u201cKacchan? You there?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFuck. It was like liquid gold hearing that stupid nickname. It made Katsuki\u2019s head spin, he felt his very soul leave his body as he heard this angel speak to him. He was gone, sent to another dimension.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah.. Yeah I\u2019m here.\u201d Katsuki let out, his voice clearly shaky\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. Oh wow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat..?\u201d Oh fuck. Its game over, he realized. Well, it was fun while it lasted. Time to throw himself into a river and sink to the bottom. Maybe he could move to another country? Change his name, get plastic surgery so no one knew who he was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just- oh wow. Sorry. Haha. I just wasn\u2019t expecting your voice to be so\u2026\u201d Katsuki can hear Izuku moving around, probably talking with his hands again. Katsuki let out a soft chuckle at the thought, which he can only assume his phone picked up cause he heard Deku\u2019s breath hitch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA-amazing? Wait no! Sorry that sounds weird! You just sound really, ahem. R-really cool is all. Y-your voice is way deeper than what I imagined in my head. O-oh geez, not that I was imagining it in a w-weird way either, maybe I should just stop talking!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHeh\u2026 I can picture your arms flailing around while you talk.\u201d Katsuki chuckled, leaning back in his chair to fold his arms. Okay maybe this was worth all the anxiety.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah, kinda what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Deku sighs out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you stutter this much before.\u201d The blonde hums, enjoying how nervous the other is.\n\u00a0\n\u201cS-sorry, just uh- t-trying to adjust to this. I-I wasn\u2019t really e-expecting you to have a deep voice...\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki lets out a snort. \u201cDid you think I\u2019d have a high pitch voice?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cN-no! I uh\u2026 Oh gosh, I d-don\u2019t even know w-what I was expecting at th-this point.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmmm.\u201d Katsuki lets out a soft hum at that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hears another sound from Deku\u2019s mic, though he isn\u2019t sure what it is. He really wasn\u2019t expecting Deku to be so nervous, actually Katsuki was the one he figured would be nervous and freaking out.\n\u00a0\nDeku cleared his throat, clearly trying to gain some composure. \u201cS-so! Did you m-make your character yet Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot yet, was trying to figure that out.\u201d The blonde groaned, now looking at the character screen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWould it be too on the nose if he made the character look like him? Maybe it\u2019d be funny since Deku is such a DynaMight fan.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was just a bunch of pixels anyway, how could he possibly tell if he just made his avatar blonde? There\u2019s tons of blonde people in this world. Yeah it\u2019s fine.\n\u00a0\nFinally making his avatar, Katsuki watched the dumb cutscene and was at his garbage farm. The entire time he was grumbling and nagging at the game to go faster, which garnered him soft cute giggles from Deku.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright now I have this shithole of a farm. Now what? Just wait around for you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHang on, let me start up a co-op game.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter a few minutes the game was set up and the two were able to finally see each other in the pixelated world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeku\u2019s avatar had green hair and eyes, of fucking course, along with teal overalls. Katsuki knew it was just a bunch of pixels, but something about being this close, even in the digital world, made his butterflies fester in his gut. He could almost imagine being on a real farm with Deku, the two of them planting seeds and watching their crops grow together. He\u2019d walk outside with a glass of ice tea as Deku stood and wiped the sweat from his brow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou looked thirsty.\u201d Katsuki would say, handing over the ice tea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know me so well, Kacchan.\u201d Deku would laugh, taking the ice tea with a grateful expression.\n\u00a0\nThe two would lock eyes, emeralds meeting rubies. Nothing else in the world mattered. Just them and their little farm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan! Your avatar looks cute! Wait are you blonde in real life?\u201d Deku\u2019s voice snapped Katsuki out of his daydream and back to reality.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? Oh\u2026 yeah. I\u2019m blonde.\u201d Katsuki says, his tone awkward. Again hoping Deku won\u2019t connect the dots.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, that\u2019s cute. Blonde hair is such a pretty color.\u201d The greenette giggled.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s breath was stolen from him in that very instant. His face started to heat up and his hands felt sweaty. Shit don\u2019t use your quirk you nervous idiot. Calm down!! It\u2019s just a dumb compliment, don\u2019t think too much about it!\n\u00a0\nThe blonde bit at his lower lip anxiously trying to think of a reply. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d he began. \u201cGreen is also a pretty color.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nDeku went silent. He could hear some kind of mumbling on the other end of the call, until Deku finally spoke up. \u201cI-I uh. Ahem. Y-you think so?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but smirk. The poor nerd was just as anxious, maybe more so. \u201cMmm\u2026 kinda reminds me of the ocean. That real fuckin\u2019 specific green it has.\u201d The blonde pauses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I was a kid my parents would take me to the beach, and I\u2019d go to some of the darker areas to search for clams \u2018n shit. I\u2019d sit and watch the tides go in and out, and just watch. It was one of the few times I was actually calm as a child.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence yet again comes over the two. There\u2019s a sound from the other end of the call that Katsuki can\u2019t place, then Deku finallly speaks up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you have a lonely childhood?\u201d\n\u00a0\nOut of all the things Katsuki could imagine Deku would say, it wasn\u2019t that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-\u201c the blonde shifts uncomfortably in his chair. \u201cYeah I guess so. I didn\u2019t really have any friends. But, I didn\u2019t really want any either. People annoyed me. Hell even now I don\u2019t really have many friends.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Deku hums. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you hang out with me then.\u201d He lets out a soft laugh. \u201cMost people find ME annoying.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki could hear the anxiety in Deku\u2019s tone. He honestly felt bad, but it was the truth. Most people DID annoy him and he was ridiculously picky about friends. But something about Deku was different, almost special in a way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt made Katsuki want to protect him, keep him safe from the hurt the world dared to inflict upon him. He wanted to let him know just how special he was in his eyes and how wonderful and intelligent he was. How he deserved confidence and support for his ideas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t even explain it to himself why he felt so connected to the greenette. But every time he saw those gorgeous emeralds, it was like the stars were speaking to him. Each consolation spreading across his beautiful tanned skin, the universe in his eyes lighting up with each word he spoke.\n\u00a0\nIt made Katsuki feel soft. Every time he saw Deku all he could think in his heart was \u201cHome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t find you annoying.\u201d Katsuki said, in almost a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re interesting. You may be a nerd but your nerd brain has a lot of good ideas. I like hearing you talk\u2026\u201d Katsuki could feel his ears heating up again.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s weird to say but\u2026 Fuck whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a small almost gasp sound from the other end, then\u2026 Oh God was that sniffling?!\n\u00a0\n\u201cD-Deku\u2026?\u201d His tone was now worried. Maybe he overstepped? Maybe he said something wrong? Oh fuck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah I\u2019m here. S-sorry. Just.\u201d There was a deep inhale. \u201cSorry sorry! No one has ever said anything that nice to me haha. I guess I got a little emotional.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was in utter shock. He wasn\u2019t the best with words, he knew that. So if THAT was the nicest thing he\u2019s ever heard, what the fuck had he been hearing up until now?\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s fucking true. You got a big ass nerd brain, but that nerd brain has some damn good ideas.\u201d Katsuki grunted. He was well aware his voice was getting a bit louder now and he needed to calm downs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTone down the DynaMighta bit and bring back the calmer Kacchan, idiot. Cant have Deku figuring out who you are!\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck anyone that says different. I-\u201c Katsuki brakes a deep breath. \u201cI like talking to you\u2026 or whatever.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a soft giggle from Deku. Ugh that laugh, like warm sweet honey. He could listen to it all day. It wasn\u2019t fair how cute this guy was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are\u2026 quite the wordsmith Kacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m great at everything I do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnother laugh, this time muffled slightly. Deku was probably covering his mouth with his hand or sleeve. Fuck that was too cute.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, shall we play?\u201d Deku chirps, his character running circles around Katsuki\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, right. Yeah, let\u2019s play this dumb game.\u201d The blonde chuckles, making his character move back and forth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo uh\u2026 how exactly do I play?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter 30 minutes Deku had fully taught Katsuki how to play, and the two started building up their little farm. Deku helped explain the mechanics while Katsuki would grumble and do the opposite or even wander off to do something else and be a stubborn ass.\n\u00a0\nAfter 3 hours the two were finally gonna call it quits for the night as it was getting late and both needed rest.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s heart felt warm, listening to that dweeb ramble for hours and the two chatted like they had been friends since forever.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The greenette mumbled anxiously. \u201cIt was amazing talking to you Kacchan. I hope y-you sleep well! N-night!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmm. Night Deku.\u201d Katsuki grunted before leaving the call. Honestly he didn\u2019t want to. He could probably just fall asleep talking to the nerd.\n\u00a0\nStretching out his back and hearing a few satisfying pops, Katsuki moved to his bed to get some sleep.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis dreams filled with beautiful ocean green hair and soft emerald eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku was sitting at his desk in absolute shock. He has finally talked to Kacchan on voice call and it was NOT at all what he expected.\n\u00a0\nNothing could even mentally prepare him for what he was going to hear. The man's voice was like liquid gold, it was like the finest melted chocolate you could ever dare taste. Everything about it was rich and velvety.\n\u00a0\nIzuku sat there with his face bright red, his hands still shaking. All he could think was  Oh God Kacchan has such a hot voice. Oh god he\u2019s probably so attractive too!! Why the hell is he talking to a dork like me?! Oh God Oh Crap!! \n\u00a0\nHis heart was still pounding in his chest, he felt a little dizzy from all the endorphins rushing through his body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was well aware this wasn\u2019t a normal reaction, and especially towards a guy. It\u2019s not like Izuku hadn\u2019t questioned his sexuality a few times. Girls made him nervous and blush but sometimes in the boys locker room he\u2019d start feeling embarrassed from how the other guys' bodies made his face flush.\n\u00a0\nHonestly for the past few years Izuku had been so busy with school he didn\u2019t get a chance to properly think about his sexuality. But he was pretty positive this was some kinda crush he was developing on this guy he met nearly two months ago.\n\u00a0\nAt first he had worried those feelings were just him overreacting to being sent so much money at once and feeling obligated. But now those emotions were turning into something else, something Izuku himself was trying to understand.\n\u00a0\nKacchan made his heart get caught in his throat, he made him get flush and nervous. He didn\u2019t even know what the guy looked like but he was positive he had to be attractive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis mind started to try and piece together what the man might look like. He knew he was blonde, and he knew he was tall and muscular, and he knew he looked intimidating..\n\u00a0\nImmediately DynaMight pops into Izuku's head and the greenette nearly screams.  No no no. It can\u2019t be him. Try imagining a DIFFERENT blonde, Izuku!\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nMaybe he had short straight hair and blue eyes. Very piercing and intimidating. Deku tried to piece together any kind of face but it was difficult given the info he had.\n\u00a0\nHe was anxious to ask for a selfie since Kacchan seemed so private about his life. But to be fair, so was Izuku. Neither knew their real names, where they were born, hell Izuku didn\u2019t even know the guy's age. He assumed early 20\u2019s like himself by how he talked and now by his voice.\n\u00a0\nHe knew so much and yet so little about the mysterious Kacchan, and honestly it only pulled him in more.\n\u00a0\nEvery time he mentioned work or his childhood he was so fascinated. Izuku wanted to know more about the mysterious man that donated large sums of money.\n\u00a0\nBut he also didn\u2019t want to scare him off or annoy him. It would be a slow battle to unravel the mystery that was Kacchan. And Izuku was absolutely thrilled to do so.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nThe date was December 21st, only a few days until Christmas. Katsuki had now known Deku for nearly two months and had their first voice call a few days ago. Katsuki was absolutely over the moon.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t think ever in his life that knowing someone could make him feel like this. Everyone he\u2019d ever met made him either wanna deck them in the face or scream. But for some reason Deku was different. He made Katsuki laugh, made his heart feel warm, he couldn\u2019t get the green haired boy with stars on his cheeks and a cosmos in his eyes, out of his mind.\n\u00a0\nEven in his dreams he dreamt of the boy. His cute face flushed against his while he wrapped his arms around his slender frame. Kissing along his cheeks and down his neck, counting each and every freckle.\n\u00a0\nDeku would shudder under his grasp, his eyes fluttering shut from the feeling. \u201cK-Kacchan\u2026\u201d The greenette would breathe out, grasping at Katuski.\n\u00a0\nFuck. He was in deep. Way too deep. He didn\u2019t even know the guy's real name, and a ton of information on the guy remained a mystery. But yet something about him just made him get pulled in even closer. Like the string of fate had connected them and pulled them in closer and closer. His hands reaching out for those gorgeous green curls that felt so familiar and yet so distant.\n\u00a0\nPING!\n\u00a0\nA notification went off on Katsuki\u2019s phone, yanking him from his daydream. He was in the office today filling out more useless paperwork. His quirk was \u201ctoo destructive\u201d so he usually was left filling out paperwork on the buildings he\u2019d accidentally damaged. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why that was HIS job when he's a hero. He was out there saving lives! And could be saving even more if he wasn\u2019t stuck in this stupid office building!\n\u00a0\nGrabbing his phone he clicked on the Twitch app and tuned into Deku\u2019s stream. Looks like he was reacting to hero memes or something today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey there my lovelies! Before I start stream I have two things to show you! I recently treated myself a bit since Christmas is around the corner, sooo~\u201d the greenette reached behind his chair and grabbed for something before turning back to the camera.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFirst of all, you all have been complaining my headset is old and ugly. And you\u2019re right. So I finally got myself a new pair!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom between his lap he pulled out a pair of black headphones with glowing teal rabbit ears on the top. He nestled them atop his fluffy green mound of hair and cupped his cheeks, a clear blush rushing over them. Katsuki\u2019s breath hitched. Deku looked too damn cute for his own good. This shouldn\u2019t be allowed. And clearly the chat agreed because everyone was going absolutely apeshit.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\nDekusWifey: SOOO CUTE!! Yes Deku-Chan!!!\nPoppinrocks: that\u2019s too cute oh my gosh!! Deku stop my heart!\nHoneyButterLover Donated 7,000 bits \u201cMarry me Deku-channnn\u201d\nStckyFingers70: lol he\u2019s not gonna marry you, idiot.\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: ew\nMintedChaser: oh shush Kacchan! You\u2019re one to talk, Mr. Top Donor.\nDekusWifey: yeah besides! If He marries anyone it's gonna be ME!!![TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: stop being weird before you get banned, idiot.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nStupid simps, always made the stream a bit less enjoyable. Luckily Deku ignored the weirdos in chat, in the beginning he would read the creepy messages aloud and start to get frazzled or anxious. But he\u2019s pretty quickly learned to tune them out. He always paid special mind to ignore this \u201cDekusWifey\u201d person and a few of the others who didn\u2019t seem to stop being creeps. It took all of Katsuki\u2019s willpower not to tear them all a new asshoke.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAren\u2019t they the cutest?! But wait I have another thing to show you guys!\u201d Deku was practically bouncing around in his seat with excitement. \u201cI saw this at the mall and I couldn\u2019t really pass it up. He was way too cute and soft not to get. Though the price tag was\u2026. pretty ridiculous I\u2019ll admit. But just- let me just show you guys.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTurning again he pulled out something from behind his desk. It was hard to tell at first, just a big mound of pale yellow. Then it hit Katsuki like a bullet train.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTada!! Look!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis face began to heat up, the blonde now chewing at his bottom lip. Nothing could have mentally prepared him for what he was about to see.\n\u00a0\nIt was a big ass plushie of DynaMight. Katsuki specifically remembers getting this design sent to him and thinking it was stupid and didn\u2019t fit his badass look, but his PR department said it\u2019d be good to make more cutesy items for kids that are his fans. Clearly they never considered cute twinks who might be into his brand as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d Katsuki groaned out, staring down at his phone. It has to be illegal to be this adorable. There no fucking way a human being could look like that and be allowed to walk down the street.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he the cutest? I wonder if the real DynaMight gives soft hugs like this little guy does.\u201d Deku giggled, squeezing the giant plushie closer. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop holding him around my apartment. I even slept cuddling him last night. Kinda\u2026 dorky I know, but he\u2019s just so soft and cute!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s mind was going a mile a minute, did Deku really think he was cute? Or was he just gushing over the squishy plushie? He looked so happy holding onto the dumb doll it honestly made it all worth it to go through the nightmare of getting the thing made. And it might have made Katsuki a little jealous, but not that he would admit it.\n\u00a0\nHe was well aware that Deku had a lot of money troubles and from what he saw Deku owned 2 DynaMight shirts, one figure and now a plushie. A pretty sizable collection, but absolutely dwarfed compared to the All Might collection that Katsuki was very well aware of. Clearly, that needed to be fixed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd Katsuki had an idea on how.\n\u00a0\n--------\n\u00a0\nIzuku stretched out his back, it was another good stream. Thought the amount of creeps seemed to have been growing as of late. Izuku was gaining a bigger audience and while he was extremely grateful, he wasn\u2019t used to people treating him the way people did online.\n\u00a0\nAll his life he was often scribed as \u201cplain\u201d or hell, even ugly. Izuku didn\u2019t think he was bad looking by any means, but he didn\u2019t exactly have a ton of confidence either due to being bullied for so long. So people complimenting him or demanding his attention like they did was an entirely new concept to the greenette.\n\u00a0\nPING!Speaking of wanting his attention.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014KaboomKing: Hey loser, you got a P.O Box or something?Deku: Yeah, but why?KaboomKing: Why the fuck do you think? I\u2019m gonna send you a Christmas present, nerd ass.Deku: Wait what?? Noooo! You really don\u2019t need to!KaboomKing: I don\u2019t NEED to do shit. Now gimme the address.Deku: Should I get you something??? o(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)oKaboomKing: Naw. Keep your dork money.KaboomKing: You gotta open it on stream though. I wanna see your reaction.KaboomKing: That can be my gift.Deku: Deal! (\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Izuku let out a soft chuckle. Of course Kacchan wanted to send him a gift, and of course the guy didn\u2019t want any presents. He was probably rich from what Izuku could gather, so if he did want anything he could just buy it. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure why some mysterious rich man wanted to even talk to him, but either way he was grateful. Kacchan was funny, nice, and gave him confidence when he needed it. Every conversation with the mysterious man made his heart swell.They\u2019d known each other for close to two months now, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel oddly attached to him. Even if he didn\u2019t know a ton about the other man, he just wanted to be around him.\n\u00a0\nWith shaky hands Izuku started to type. Maybe it was a stupid idea, maybe it was overstepping. But something in him needed this.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Deku: Hey Kacchan.KaboomKing: What?Deku: What are you doing for Christmas...?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Deku: Hey Kacchan.KaboomKing: What?Deku: What are you doing for Christmas...?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stared down at his phone in absolute shock. What was he doing for Christmas? Well probably working if he knew his work schedule. But did Deku want to do something with him\u2026? Maybe play games again? Hopefully not try and meet up cause Katsuki couldn\u2019t handle that.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014KaboomKing: Probably working. Why?Deku: Oh\u2026Deku: I was hoping we could maybe do something.Deku: Like, I dunno. Play a game or maybe try watching a dumb movie.Deku: If you want!Deku: You don\u2019t need to!Deku: Clearly you\u2019re busy so it's fine!Deku: What I mean is!!Deku: Its entire up to you and-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The typing continued, Katsuki pinched the bridge of his nose. Fuck it. He clicked the call button on his phone and waited.\n\u00a0\n\u201cH-hello Kacchan\u2026 Are you mad?\u201d\u201cMad? No, fuck head. You seemed like you were having a damn panic attack or some shit.\u201d\u201cS-sorry\u2026 I guess I got anxious. I\u2019ve uh, never had anyone around to do stuff with on Christmas. O-other than my mom that is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki ran his hands down his face. Of course he was anxious, the guy had never really had friends up until now. To be fair, neither had Katsuki until recently. Most years he\u2019d spend them with his parents or hell sometimes alone. But he preferred being alone, or at least that's what he told himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku.\u201d Katsuki began, he heard almost a yelp on the other end of the line. \u201cI\u2019ll check my schedule nerdass. Stop freaking out, fuck.\u201d\u201cR-really?! You mean it!!!?\u201d Deku was practically vibrating.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. I gotta get back to work, I\u2019ll text you.\u201d\u201cO-okay Kacchan.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cHave a good rest of your day.\u201dKatsuki\u2019s cheeks started to flush. \u201cYeah\u2026 Talk to you later, Deku.\u201d The blonde said with a shaky breath. This was getting ridiculous.\n\u00a0\n---------\n\u00a0\nIzuku was standing at his P.O. Box, he remembered that Kacchan had wanted to send him something but he wasn\u2019t sure what exactly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMidoriya Izuku?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yes! That\u2019s me!\u201d Izuku stammered, walking up to the counter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCareful, it\u2019s a big one.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFrom behind the woman pulled out a large box and, nearly the size of Izuku\u2019s entire torso. The thing was gigantic!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d The greenette beamed, grabbing the box and leaving the post office. He could honestly barely carry the stupid thing it was so heavy. What on earth did Kacchan send him??\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: I got your package!\nDeku: [sent picture of the box]\nDeku: it\u2019s hard to carry!\nKaboomKing: I\u2019ll be honest, I forgot how small you are compared to me.\nDeku: huh?!?\nKaboomKing: it was easy to carry for me. Forgot you\u2019re short and skinny as hell.\u00a0\nDeku: rude!! \u255a(\u2022\u2302\u2022)\u255d\nKaboomKing: Just the truth.\nDeku: I\u2019m hopping on the train now. Once I get home I\u2019ll get ready for the stream \u00a0 (\u25cf\u00b4\u03c9\uff40\u25cf)\nKaboomKing: Cool\nKaboomKing: \u30fd(^\u25c7^*)/\nDeku: ARE YOU USING EMOJIS NOW?!?\nKaboomKing; FUCK OFF!! \u30fd(\uff4f`\u76bf\u2032\uff4f)\uff89\nDeku: Kacchan is cute (~\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)~\nKaboomKing: No, I\u2019m hot. Get it right.\nDeku: Kacchan is hot ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\nKaboomKing: Ew I hate that one. Stop.\nDeku: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku let out a soft giggle as he boarded this train. He couldn\u2019t believe he met someone like Kacchan not that long ago. He was always so kind to him and made him laugh.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe two had made plans on the 24th to watch a few dumb Christmas movies together, and Kacchan even bought a simple mic set up so they could watch at his desk. He seemed pretty nervous about the thing, which only added to the cuteness. Kacchan was indeed cute.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter a 30 minute train ride and a 15 minute walk, Izuku had made it home. It was one of his streaming days and he woke up early to go and get the package Kacchan had sent him. Usually he\u2019d detest waking up so early but for Kacchan\u2019s sake it was worth it.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nDeku: Just got home! Gonna shower real quick then stream~\nKaboomKing: OK.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe greenette took off his shoes and took a brisk shower to warm himself up from the freezing weather outside. He changed into a cute bunny hoodie his mother bought him a few years ago with a basic white T-shirt and black jeans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWith a warm cup of tea in hand he was ready to start his stream. He put his new headphones on and clicked the \u201cGo live\u201d button.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello my lovelies! So! Kacchan recently sent me a package! Can you believe that?! So before I get into the rest of the stream I\u2019m gonna open this here for you all to see!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nChat:\nEmoCrib: of course fucking \u201cKacchan\u201d sent him stuff\nLooneybuns: Simp alert!\nMatchaBean: Awww that\u2019s so cute of him!\nFlowerOHair: Deku you look so pretty today!\nCoinedFlip: I wonder what Mr. Money Bags sent oooooh~\nInkySquid Donated \u00a51000 Show is the goods!\nBeanedBurrito Donated \u00a55,000 Deku is so cute! Show us the box!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft laugh. \u201cThank you InkySquis for the donation and thank you BeanedBurrito for your donation as well! Okay! So onto the show!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku cut open the box with a knife, the chat screaming at him to be careful the entire time. As he opened it he could already see hints of orange and black. Of course Kacchan sent him some DynaMight merch. He was well aware of Deku\u2019s borderline crush on the Pro Hero, so it\u2019d only make sense.\n\u00a0\nIzuku finished cutting open the rest of the box and his eyes practically sparkled at what he saw.\n\u00a0\nThe greenette pulled out another plushie, this one looked extremely well made. It was his winter costume, and with each little detail added. It looked like even his tiny plush gauntlets could be taken off. How cute!\n\u00a0\nThere was also a DynaMight tank top and matching leggings. Work out clothes perhaps? A very large and cozy looking hoodie with the DynaMight logo plastered on it. Oh he was gonna wear this all the time now!\n\u00a0\nLooking deeper there were a few more t-shirts, all seemed to be a bit oversized, which was perfectly fine for Izuku. He preferred bigger shirts anyways. A pair of DynaMight shorts as well, were these for girls\u2026? They looked cozy for pajama bottoms atleast.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd buried in it all were two figures. Izuku couldn\u2019t even contain his excitement. These two alone had to be \u00a510,000 each! Not to mention all of the other merch! Izuku could feel warm tears building up in his eyes, staring down at the wonderful gifts he had been given.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWAAAAH!! K-Kacchan! These are so amazing! How did you even get a hold of this stuff?! Holy\u2026 wow!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe greenette rubbed at his eyes, feeling a flush run its way along his freckled cheeks. \u201cWow this is the sweetest thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me. I-I cannot thank you enough! Wow!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku zipped off his current hoodie and replaced it with the black and orange DynaMight one, the sleeves flopping over his hands. It was too big for sure but he absolutely loved it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nChat:\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Glad you like it.\nKindredFlame: Sugar Daddy Kacchan over here\nPinkNewt: some of that stuff isn\u2019t even out yet! How\u2019d you get it?!\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: I know a guy\u00a0\nPinkNewt: yeah sure. A \u201cguy\u201d\nLongingCupid89: man I wish I had a Kacchan in my life. Ugh\nRampager682: Dude we ALL wish we had a Kacchan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was stationed for another late night patrol, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t gonna check in on Deku\u2019s stream when things got slow. Leaning against a wall the blonde had a gentle smile on his face, Katsuki didn\u2019t need any fancy gift for the holidays, this was all he could have ever asked for. Watching the forested hair boy beam in excitement from something he had done for him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoooo DynaMight! What\u2019s got you smiling?\u201d Crap.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDenki had gone to scout a few of the nearby streets for any villain activity while Katsuki stayed back to \u201csurvey the area\u201d, but really just watch Deku\u2019s stream for a few minutes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing, dunceface.\u201d Katsuki growled, shoving his phone back in his pocket. Of fucking course the electric hero had to come back right then and ruin it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAwwww c\u2019mon! You were totally on your phone just now! Show, c\u2019mon!\u201d the electric blonde bounced up and down, moving closer to Katsuki.\u201cDon\u2019t test me Pikachu, I\u2019ll fuckin\u2019 kill you. It's none of your damn business.\u201d Katsuki spat, glaring daggers towards his \u2018friend\u2019.\u201cAww, don\u2019t be like that. Were you texting a girl? Is she pretty?!\u201d Denki was practically vibrating out of his skin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI said it's none of your damn business.\u201d The explosive blonde snapped, raising his hand to set off a few explosives.\n\u00a0\nDenki, however, was unphased. He had been around the angry blonde for too many years to take any of his threats seriously anymore. \u201cSo it IS a girl! There\u2019s no need to be shy~ Tell me about her!\u201dEven if Katsuki wanted to explain the situation, how the hell would he even begin?  \u201cOh I saw this cute guy streaming on Twitch and I might have donated a fuck ton of money the first night and now I talk to him every single fucking day, oh and the guy has no idea what my real identity is so I\u2019m basically lying to my internet crush! So that\u2019s SUPER awesome! Did I mention he\u2019s a gigantic DynaMight fan?! Oh and the best part,\u00a0 I don't even know if the dude is INTO guys so this crush is probably a wonderful one sided nightmare!\u201d \n\u00a0\nKatsuki pinched the bridge of his nose trying to calm himself down. He didn\u2019t endure 3 years of therapy to be set off by his nosy ass friend. \u201cIt's not a girl.\u201d Katsuki gritted out. Which was true, Deku is indeed not a girl.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOhhhhh~\u201d Denki now had a cheshire grin. \u201cSo it's a boy!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat was not what he was expecting the other blonde to say. \u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cY\u2019know, it makes sense. You never were into girls back in high school. Its okay Kats, you know I\u2019d never judge you for being gay.\u201d Denki reached out, placing a hand onto Katsuki\u2019s broad shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nError, error. Katsuki has stopped working.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026 Hah?!\u201d\n\u201cSo tell me about him! Is he cute?\u201d The electric blonde beamed, at this rate Katsuki couldn\u2019t tell if he was being made fun of or if Denki was being genuine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow in the fresh fuck do you even connect \u201cKatsuki is on his phone\u201d to \u201cHe must have a crush!\u201d, Who the fuck does that?!\u201d The short tempered hero retorted, again setting off a few explosives in his hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's written all over your face! You looked like you were in looooove~\u201d\n\u00a0\nAlright, that\u2019s it. Time to give up on being a hero because he might ACTUALLY kill Denki if he kept saying shit. Katsuki ran a gloved hand down his face, attempting to hold back his rage. \u201cFuck. Off.\u201d Was all he could manage to hiss out without going into a full blow rage induced episode.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki pushed past Denki and made his way towards the street. Maybe he\u2019d be lucky and some dumb villains would appear so he could let off some steam.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait! Don\u2019t leave without me!\u201d Denki cried after, running towards his explosive friend.\n\u00a0\n--------\n\u00a0\nIzuku was practically BEAMING with excitement! He couldn\u2019t believe Kacchan sent him so many kind and wonderful gifts! He didn\u2019t know what he did to deserve such kindness but it made his heart warm and filled with so many new emotions.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Kacchan!!Deku: You\u2019re literally the best!!!!Deku: (\u30ce\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\u30ceKaboomKing: I knowDeku: I\u2019m still vibrating from earlier!!!Deku: How did you get any of this stuff?!KaboomKing: I have my ways \u2605~(\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f)Deku: !!

(\uff9f\u30ee\uff9f) hehehe\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIt was nearly 6pm now and Izuku still had the rest of the evening to kill after his stream. Tomorrow was the day they had their\u2026 actually what would it even be called? A date? No. Don\u2019t be ridiculous Izuku. Kacchan is probably straight anyways.\n\u00a0\nWith a wistful sigh Izuku decided it. He was gonna make Kacchan proud and go to the gym! He always made fun of the greenette for being so scrawny, plus if he was gonna be a nurse he\u2019d for sure need to put on more muscle. And totally not an excuse to try out his new DynaMight themed workout attire. Noooope.\n\u00a0\nIt was decided then!\n\u00a0\n------------\n\u00a0\nWalking into the gym the greenette wandered his way to the locker room to change. The freckled boy reached into his large yellow backpack and pulled out the gym clothes he had brought with, though now he didn\u2019t even realize just how tight the leggings stuck to his body now that he had them on. Maybe he should have just worn his usual baggy shorts and graphic T\u2026\n\u00a0\nWell it was too late now, and he was already here. Nervously Izuku walked into the main area to start on his typical routinet. He wasn\u2019t exactly good at a lot of it but he did give it his all. He wandered around the gym, trying a few different machines, though some he was still too weak to use.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Kacchan you\u2019re gonna be so proud of me!Deku: [sent a selfie]\n\n\n\nDeku: Tadaaa! I\u2019m at the gym!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s phone went off with the all too familiar sound. Reaching into his pocket and ignoring Denki and Eijiro\u2019s inane screeching he opened up Deku\u2019s DM\u2019s, and it was at that very point he regretted it.\n\u00a0\nOh good God. There he was. Deku was in the merch he had sent him earlier today and he looked fucking GOOD. Katsuki wanted to smash his head into a wall just to stop the stampede of thoughts that cursed his mind.\n\u00a0\nHis face was bright red and he could feel sweat building on his brow. Calm down Katsuki, calm the fuck down! Don\u2019t let Deku know that you\u2019re having gay panic!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKaboomKing: Holy shitKaboomKing: You\u2019re actually taking care of yourself for once?Deku: \u30fe(\uff20\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\uff20)\uff89 yeh! Proud of me?KaboomKing: Text me after you\u2019ve actually worked out for an hour, then we\u2019ll see.Deku: Meanie! (\uff89\u0ca5\u76ca\u0ca5\uff09\uff89 \u253b\u2501\u253bKaboomKing: That emoji is awful.Deku: UwUDeku: Off I go to get SWOL!!KaboomKing: That\u2019s a real funny mental imagineDeku: \u30fd(\uff40\u0414\u00b4)\uff89 GRRR\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nIzuku let out a soft giggle and tucked his phone away and moved to the next machine.\nIzuku stepped onto a nearby treadmill and started at a slow pace before upping it to a brisk jog after a few moments once he\u2019d adjusted. He had been going for nearly 15 minutes when someone stepped onto the one next to him. Izuku paid him no mind, opting to keep running.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey there cutie~\u201d A voice next to him rang out.\n\u00a0\nIzuku looked over and saw a man with raven colored hair and intense yellow eyes. He was taller than Izuku, though most men were to be fair. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you \u2018round here before.\u201d The dark haired man purred out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-oh, w-well\u2026 I don\u2019t r-really get to go t-to the gym o-often.\u201d Izuku sputtered, averting his eyes back to the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally? Could have fooled me twice.\u201d The man chuckled, giving Izuku a look down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis was bad. This entire situation felt bad. Alarm bells were blaring off in Izuku\u2019s head to get out of this situation and go home. \u201cO-oh. Um, th-thank you?\u201d Izuku let out a soft laugh\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you from around here?\u201d The stranger quipped, now having his treadmill at a slow walk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no.\u201d Don\u2019t give him too much info Izuku, that's dangerous.\u201cMmmmm.\u201d The raven haired man purred. \u201cAnd exactly where are you from cutie? You in college? You look young.\u201d\u201cI- uh. Ahem. Oh crap is it really getting th-that late. S-sorry, but I really need to g-get going. M-my uh, b-boyfriend is gonna get worried.\u201d Izuku turned off the machine and slowly began to walk towards the locker room.\u201cA boyfriend huh? Well what he won\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt \u2018em, right sugar?\u201d The larger man practically pinned Izuku to the machine, his pupils blown out as he watched the greenette tremble under him.\n\u201cOh he\u2019s uh\u2026\u201d Izuku tried to think of any excuse, anything to get out of this situation. \u201cH-he and I h-had plans. I r-really sh-should go. It was n-nice talking to you. B-but I really need to go!\u201d Izuku shoves past the raven haired man and jogs towards the locker room.\n\u00a0\nBreathing a sigh of relief he noticed the stranger hadn\u2019t followed him in. As quickly as possible Izuku changed into his normal clothes, forgoing a shower and trying to get out of the gym as fast as possible.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-7:22pm Deku: Kacchan I\u2019m scared\u2026.7:22pm Deku: Some creepy guy kept talking to me.7:23pm Deku: He almost didn\u2019t let me leave.7:23pm Deku: I\u2019m leaving the gym now\u2026.7:23pm Deku: I\u2019ll text you when I get home.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nSetting his phone in his pocket, Izuku made his way towards the front of the building. The sun had already started to set, and it was pretty dark out by now. Izuku started making his way to the train station before an all too familiar voice stopped him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey there cutie~\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-------\n\u00a0\nKatsuki had just got done arresting a villain that attempted armed robbery on a small convenience store, their quirk absolutely no match for his own. His phone had gone off awhile ago but Katsuki had been so caught up in the robbery he didn\u2019t have time to check.\n\u00a0\nWhen the blonde turned on his phone he nearly dropped it seeing the last messages Deku had sent.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-7:22pm Deku: Kacchan I\u2019m scared\u2026.7:22pm Deku: Some creepy guy kept talking to me.7:23pm Deku: He almost didn\u2019t let me leave.7:23pm Deku: I\u2019m leaving the gym now\u2026.7:23pm Deku: I\u2019ll text you when I get home.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nThe time now was 8:47pm. Izuku would have had plenty of time to get home and text him. Anxiously Katsuki clicked the call button and waited for Deku to answer. Maybe he just fell asleep? Maybe he was cooking dinner? Calm down Katsuki, he\u2019s probably fine.\n\u00a0\nNo answer. He tried again. No answer. And again. Still no answer.\n\u00a0\nThis was bad.\nIzuku froze, staring at the man before him. Slowly he began to back away, panic rising in his chest.In the moment Izuku struggled to say anything, only managing to say a pitiful \"Uh...\"\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being ignored.\u201d The raven haired man growled, stepping closer to Izuku, a smirk darting across his angular features. \u201cHow about you and I go somewhere else, huh? Be a dear and follow me.\u201d\nIt was like his body was possessed by those words. Izuku found himself slowly beginning to follow the stranger, his legs practically moving on their own. Was this a quirk?? Fear collected deep into Izuku\u2019s gut, betraying the answer he already knew. This was bad.\nTerrified, Izuku looked around for anyone to notice what was happening, begging for someone to help. His mind flitted to DynaMight swooping in and saving him from this terrible situation. Holding him in his strong muscular arms, blasting this freak away.\n\u201cThere you go, that\u2019s my boy.\u201d The creep purred, wrapping an arm around Izuku. \nHe felt disgusted being touched by this stranger, desperately trying to push him away. Whilst his legs may have been moving on their own, Izuku discovered he sure as hell could still move his arms. He shoved at the taller man, trying with desperation to free himself with all the strength that he could muster. \u201cPlease stop!\u201d Izuku begged, no longer holding back his voice.\n\u201cBe a dear and stop hitting me.\u201d The amber eyed man growled in retaliation, and instantly Izuku ceased struggling . Undeniably, this was his quirk in use. \nAfter maybe twenty minutes of walking, the two had made it down a dark alley, Izuku\u2019s mind now filled with unimaginable fear. What was going to happen? Was this creep truly going to try to attempt THAT in this alley? \nA chorus of \u2018No\u201d overwhelmed all of Izuku\u2019s thoughts. He had to get away, regardless of whether he had a Quirk or not, this was bad. \n\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, you know that? Your eyes remind me of the forest at night. Such a cute little face...\u201d The taller man cooed. Such flattering words might have sounded romantic if they were by anyone else, yet Izuku wanted nothing more than to vomit in response.\nThe taller man shoved Izuku up against the alley wall and attempted to kiss him, only for Izuku to bite at his lip harshly, blood splattering between the two.\n\u201cOhhh, this Kitty has claws! I love when they fight back!\u201d The creep cackled, shoving Izuku down even harder. \u201cC\u2019mon kitten. Try and fight back. I dare you.\u201d\nIzuku hissed and shoved his knee right into the taller man's groin as hard as he could, earning him a harsh groan of pain before the stranger released his deathly grip on Izuku long enough for him to get a head start and run. \nRight as he felt hopeful he could get away from this volatile man, he felt a tug on his arm, pulling him backwards. This can\u2019t be happening!\n\u201cOh no no no, you\u2019re not getting away that easy!\u201d The man laughed as he pulled at the greenette harshly. \nIntense burning pain ran throughout Izuku\u2019s body, his vision going blurry. Then he heard it, a sickening snap. The taller man had broken his arm.Izuku let out a blood curdling scream as he writhed in pain. It was like molten lava had been poured over his arm as a horrific searing pain the viridian haired boy had never felt before consumed him. Everything began to go hazy.\nThe stranger scoffed, pulling Izuku back to the wall. \u201cBe a dear and stop screaming so much.\u201dThe greenette stared down at his now mangled arm, blood dripping to the floor below him. Izuku didn\u2019t stand a chance against him. His entire body was screaming, begging him to move and yet here he was frozen in fear. Just move dammit! Get out of there! But he couldn\u2019t, no matter how hard he tried.\n\u201cAw, my poor kitten. You look so upset. I\u2019m sorry, but you were trying to get away and I just couldn\u2019t have that.\u201d The raven haired man said gently, pushing Izuku\u2019s curls out of his face and brushing at his soft cheeks.\u201dYou\u2019re far too cute for me to just let you go.\u201d \n\u201cP-please, please just let me go.\u201d Izuku cried, his eyes burning from the tears begging to escape his emerald eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Be a dear and let me have fun with you.\u201d The man smiled, Izuku felt a shiver run down his spine as he peered into those awful yellow orbs. \nHe again thought of DynaMight rushing in to save him from this situation. He thought about that gorgeous blonde hair, and how he probably smelt like burnt sugar. He\u2019d blast this freak into the next century, then take him somewhere safe. Maybe the two would meet eyes and a blossoming romance could form between the two.\nIzuku kept his mind on that fantasy as a taller man before him did as he pleased, Izuku slowly losing consciousness from blood loss.\nSlowly everything went black.\n-----------\nKatsuki was a mess, an absolute panicked mess. He hadn\u2019t heard from Deku in hours now. It was nearly 3 in the morning, but still no messages. He didn\u2019t know Deku\u2019s address,but he knew at least what city he was in from the P.O. Box. However, even by plane it was 3 hours from where Katsuki lived in Tokyo.\nKatsuki paced in his office, trying to think of what to do as panic and fear flowed throughout his entire body. A knock came at his door, pulling the blonde from his thoughts. \u201cWhat?!\u201d \nIt was his closest friend, Eijiro. The redhead awkwardly shambles into the room, giving Katsuki a sympathetic look. \u201cHey man, got a call that you were still in the office and pacing around. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nHow could Katsuki even begin to explain? He ran a calloused hand through his ash blonde hair and sighed. \u201cA uh-\u201c Katsuki paused, trying to find the right words. \u201cA friend of mine hasn\u2019t texted me in a few hours. He said some freak was chatting to him at the gym and suddenly he went quiet.\u201d\nEijiro gave Katsuki a confused look, processing just what the blonde had said. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d was all that managed to come out.\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhen did he last text you?\u201d\n\u201c7pm\u2026\u201d Katsuki mumbled. \nEijiro gasped, now starting to understand his friend's panic.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 fuck, what nearly 8 hours?\u201d \n\u201cYeah. He said he\u2019d text me when he got home, but I haven\u2019t gotten shit since then. I\u2019ve called over and over again with no answer.\u201d \n\u201cShould\u2026 I mean, can we send out a missing person report? Maybe get someone to go check?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not even sure where he\u2019s at. Hell, I don\u2019t even know the guy's actual name.\u201d Katsuki let out a weak laugh. Yeah, this situation was fucked.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know your own friend's first actual name?\u201d Eirjiro asked, confusion in his voice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll explain later. Right now I just need to figure out if the guy is alive.\u201d Katsuki was shaking now, visions of Deku\u2019s body found dead in a gutter flashing before his eyes.\n\u201cHey hey hey, it\u2019s okay Kats. We\u2019ll find him. Give me any information you can and I\u2019ll forward it so we can try and find him, okay?\u201d Ever the ray of sunshine and hope, Eijiro clasped a hand onto Katsuki\u2019s and gave him a bright smile.\n\u201cYeah. Yeah okay sure.\u201d\nKatsuki gave a description of Deku and what information he could, and soon Eijiro was off to forward the intel. With luck, they might actually find him safe and sound. But those chances were slim.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIzuku regained consciousness, his body stiff and sore. He surveyed his surroundings and found that no one was around. He had been left in a dark dingy alley but could hardly remember how he got there. Izuku attempted to sit up but the worst pain he ever felt shot through his entire body. His arm and legs were broken. This was bad.\nWhat time was it even? How far was he from home? How was he gonna get help?\nAll these thoughts raced through the greenettes mind as he lay motionless, scared and alone. He wished Kacchan was here to talk to him, help him through his panic, his calm husky voice giving him comfort.\nBut he couldn\u2019t have that. He was alone. No one was here to save him.\nHot tears started to stream down Izuku\u2019s face as he laid motionless. Desperately Izuku tried to piece back what exactly had happened to him but every time he tried, nausea crept over his entire being and he wanted to vomit.\nMaybe this was it. This was how he died. Sad and alone in a dark alleyway with broken limbs, probably getting infected. What a hell of a way to go out. A quirkless loser nobody cared about.\nWith heavy eyes, Izuku started to feel his consciousness being taken from him again. Maybe sleep was a good idea. Yeah.\n-------------\n\u201cHey! I think I found something!\u201d A voice called out, waking Izuku from his slumber. \nHe could hear footsteps drawing close. With the last bit of energy that Izuku had he tried to call out. \u201cH-hello? P-please help\u2026\u201d Was all he could muster. His throat felt dry and hoarse, probably from screaming. Every inch of him was on fire and all he wanted to do was sleep. But help was coming, or at least he hoped so.\nThe footsteps came closer and closer, Izuku could barely make out who it was. A few figures stood before whim, clearly asking questions but Izuku couldn\u2019t hear it in his haze.\n\u201cHe\u2019s barely holding on. Get the EMT\u2019s now!\u201d One of the voices yelled, another person bending down to examine Izuku\u2019s body.\nHe felt a warm hand press against his face, tears yet again falling from his now red and exhausted eyes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s okay now. You\u2019re safe.\u201d A voice hummed, and Izuku believed them.\nHe was slipping back to the darkness, his eyelids feeling heavy again. \n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d was all he could say before passing out.\n----------\nIzuku woke to the sound of machines beeping and the smell of disinfectant. His entire body felt like he had just been hit by a freight train. Slowly, Izuku began to open his eyes and peered around, taking in his surroundings. A hospital?Looking down Izuku noticed his arm and both legs were in casts, seemingly his left arm the only thing left alone. He should have been thankful, but all he felt was dread. Izuku clicked the nurse call light, hoping for some answers and perhaps he could get his phone back to text Kacchan and his mother what had happened.\nAfter a few moments a nurse came in, with the brightest smile Izuku had ever seen. She had adorable lilac hair and bright sky blue eyes, soft star freckles littered across her cute pale features. \u201cAh! You\u2019re awake! That\u2019s wonderful! How are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cIn a lot of pain.\u201d Izuku admitted, giving a weak laugh. \u201cFeels like I got hit by a train, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you some more pain meds, you poor thing\u2026 you had a lot of injuries! I looked over your sheet and goodness! Multiple fractures through your arm and legs, it took nearly 12 hours of surgery to fix you up!\u201d\n12 hours\u2026? How much time had Izuku lost? The freckled boy started to feel panic rise in him once again. \u201cE-excuse me ma\u2019am, but how long was I asleep?\u201d\n\u201cOh let me see.\u201d The lilac haired nurse hummed, looking over Izuku\u2019s paperwork. \u201cIt says here you\u2019ve been out cold for four days now. Goodness! Your body needed a lot of rest, huh?\u201d The nurse beamed, still keeping her gentle smile. \nFour days?! Izuku had been out cold for four friggin days?! He was hyperventilating at this point, the kind nurse running to Izuku\u2019s side to calm him down.\n\u201cHey now, hey! It\u2019s okay honey. Shhh\u201d The nurse's hair started sprouting small flowers and a calming smell of gooseberries and lilacs filled the room. Izuku started to instantly calm, his eyelids feeling heavy.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s no sense in freaking out, okay honey? I\u2019ll get you your pain meds. Some police officers are gonna come by to talk to you here soon and ask you some questions. Are you okay talking to them?\u201dIzuku gave a weak nod to the nurse, his mind feeling foggy but calm.\n\u201cWhen they got me here, did they bring my bag? I\u2019d like to have my phone please.\u201d The viridian haired boy asked, his voice shaky from trying to keep conscious.\n\u201cI think the police officers took it with your other things, but I\u2019ll ask if you can have them back. Give me a moment, okay honey?\u201d The nurse smiled kindly, her quirk letting out more of that wonderful gentle smell.\nThe nurse went to get the greenette his medications, making sure to notify the officers as well as Izuku\u2019s doctor that he had finally woken up.\nThe freckled boy sat in the hospital bed, his emotions all over the place. His day had started out so amazing but ended in the worst way possible. All he wanted now was to curl up in bed, cuddle his giant DynaMight plushie, talk to Kacchan and cry. \nIf he had been here for 4 days then not only did he miss Christmas but he missed his and Kacchan\u2019s, er, \u201cdate\u201d thing. This realization made the greenettes mood sour even more. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong.\n--------\nAfter what felt like hours, two police officers walked into the room, both giving Izuku a gentle smile. \u201cI see you\u2019re finally awake, that\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m Officer Tsukauchi, and I was assigned to your case. What exactly do you remember? Do you know your name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Midoriya Izuku. I remember\u2015\u201c Izuku paused, nausea yet again coming back. Tears threatened to escape his eyes.\n\u201cTake your time.\u201d The taller man offered gently.\n \u201cA-a man, with r-raven hair and yellow eyes. H-he um. He h-had some kind of quirk that made me follow his c-commands.\u201d The greenette sobbed. It was all coming back now. \u201cI t-tried to escape a-and he b-broke my arm. After that I-I blacked out I-I think\u2026\u201d Izuku felt sick. He wanted to forget it all. Burn those memories to the ground.\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d The Officer said, his voice sympathetic. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky, three pro heroes found you in that alleyway and saved you.\u201d\nIzuku blinked back tears, Three pro heroes came to save him? Everything was a blur, but he remembers voices talking to him. He remembers seeing faint figures but no idea who.\n\u201cW-who may I ask found me?\u201d\n\u201cDynaMight, Red Riot and Chargebolt.\u201d The Officer stated, now writing in his notes. \u201cThere apparently was some big dispatch going on to find someone marching your exact description and multiple pro heroes and officers were on the hunt.\u201d\nIzuku stared at the man, his mind spinning. Did Kacchan call the police? He had to have, no one else knew he was missing and his last message to him was now days ago. Izuku\u2019s heart started to flutter, feeling warm that his friend had cared so deeply about him and hell bent on getting him safe that even pro heroes were out looking.\nThen something hit him. DynaMight saved him. Fucking DynaMight had found his body in that alleyway and saved his life! Holy SHIT! Izuku was nearly over the moon, despite the undesirable circumstances. DynaMight did come and save him from that horrible situation! Sure, it wasn\u2019t as he had envisioned but that didn\u2019t matter. \n\u201cC-can you please tell them thank you f-for me? Or anything?!\u201d Izuku stammered, now sitting up in his bed.\nThe officer stared at Izuku, looking panicked for the sudden movement. \u201cHey kid, calm down! Don\u2019t move so suddenly!\u201d \n\u201cP-please\u2026 I just need them to know h-how grateful I am\u2026\u201d the freckled boy sobbed out. \u201cI know it\u2019s just their job, but if you could somehow pass on a message I\u2019d be so grateful. Please.\u201d\nTsukauchi sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. \u201cJust uh. Here. Write down what you want to say and I\u2019ll see if I can pass it along.\u201d\nIzuku practically beamed at that. With his left hand Izuku attempted to write out a message on the piece of paper the Officer had given him. It wasn\u2019t perfect but he tried his best. The message was still legible in the end, which was all that mattered.\n\u201cAlright, if that\u2019s all then we\u2019ll be going. If we have any more questions we\u2019ll be in touch Oh and, here\u2019s the personal belongings that you had on you when you were found.\u201d Tsukauchi offered, sitting down Izuku\u2019s big yellow bag on the bed before leaving. \u201cHave a good day Mr. Midoriya.\u201d\nIzuku stared at the walls dumbfounded. Everything was terrible, he\u2019d gone through such a disturbing and painful event, and yet he was giddy. He had truly been saved by his favorite hero and he couldn\u2019t believe it. Not only that but Kacchan had probably put out a notice for him to be found.For once in his life he had a friend who cared about his well being, and was worried for him. Izuku had never had that kind of feeling before, and it made his heart warm at the thought.\nReaching into his bag, Izuku pulled out his phone. Thanking all the Gods in the universe, it somehow still had some battery after 4 days. It was at 15% but that was enough.\nIzuku opened Discord and saw he had 15 missed messages from Kacchan and 20 missed calls. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Kacchan really was worried for him!Each message made Izuku\u2019s heart sink, however.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-KaboomKing: Hey sorry work was busy, you home?KaboomKing: I\u2019m getting worried, dude. Please text me soon\u2026KaboomKing: Are you okay?KaboomKing: Deku please be okay.KaboomKing: Deku I\u2019m scared, are you alive??KaboomKing: Please god just reply!!KaboomKing: I\u2019m losing my fucking mind please call me or something so I know you\u2019re okay!KaboomKing: Deku this isn\u2019t funny, please call me or something KaboomKing: Deku please be aliveKaboomKing: I\u2019m so worried\u2026\u2026..KaboomKing: Deku please come back\u2026.KaboomKing: It\u2019s been 6 hours now\u2026.KaboomKing: I can\u2019t stop thinking about your body somewhere dead on the streets and it\u2019s eating me alive...KaboomKing: I\u2019m begging please just text me back!KaboomKing: Deku\u2026.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nIzuku held his phone tight in his only good hand, tears trailing down his face. Kacchan cared for him. Kacchan was worried.\nBefore he could even think, he called Kacchan.\nRing. Ring. Ring.\n--------\nKatsuki was sitting in his apartment, it was his day off but he had been an anxious wreck ever since this entire situation started. He knew pieces of what had happened but the police were now handing the investigation so he wasn\u2019t allowed much intel. \nAll of a sudden this phone started ringing, that all too familiar ringtone. \n[Deku Is Calling\u2026]\nKatsuki practically leaped for his phone to answer.\n\u201cD-Deku?!\u201d\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Deku cried out. \u201cM-my phone is at 15% battery but I-I\u2019m alive! I\u2019m so sorry for worrying you!\u201d\nKatsuki let out a low hiss. \u201cIdiot\u2026 Don\u2019t apologize for that. You\u2019re safe and that\u2019s what matters\u2026\u201d\n\u201cProbably won\u2019t be streaming for a while.\u201d Deku laughs weakly. \u201cThat guy uh\u2026 broke my arm and both my legs.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s stomach dropped. He remembers seeing Deku\u2019s small body covered in blood and bruises when he found him. The image of him haunted his dreams for the past few nights, but he had hoped it was all surface level. Katsuki wanted nothing more than to find the man who did this and kill him slowly and painfully. He felt a rage deep into his core that he had never felt before in his life.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay though! No need to worry about me now! I\u2019m-\u201c there was a pause. \u201cI assume it was who you contacted the police?\u201d \n\u201cYeah. It was.\u201d Katsuki could feel tears prickling at his eyes. He should be there. He should be there comforting Deku, making sure he\u2019s okay and taken care of. Feeding him soup or whatever you do to help injured people.\n\u201cThank you Kacchan\u2026 you\u2019re honestly the most amazing friend I\u2019ve ever had. No one has ever cared for me like this\u2026\u201d\nThat only made Katsuki\u2019s heart sink deeper. Has he never had friends before? Literally no one?\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The blonde pauses, thinking over his words. \u201cI care for you \u2018n shit. So get used to it, fucker.\u201d \nThere was a happy hum from the other end of the line. \u201cI care for you too, Kacchan. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d\nKatsuki could feel the tips of his ears heating up at that. Fuck, he wanted to run to the hospital right now, give that loser a big hug and make everything better. \n\u201cMy phone\u2019s at 5% battery\u2026 I gotta go, but I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026 keep me updated\u201d\n\u201cI will. Bye Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cBye, nerd.\u201d\nClick. \nKatsuki stared at the ceiling, contemplating what to do. On one hand, if he revealed himself now he would be Deku\u2019s hero. He saved him and he could finally go and see the nerd.\nOn the other hand, the poor guy was an emotional wreck right now and adding to it that his favorite hero has been talking to him for nearly 2 months (and might be in love with him), could only add to the emotional distress he was going through.\nThis was a mess. A gigantic mess that Katsuki wasn\u2019t even sure how to handle.\n------------\nIt has been a few days since Izuku had been at the hospital, and he was now being discharged. His legs and arm were doing better, a pro hero even came by to help the healing process. Recovery Girl is what they called her. She took off Izuku\u2019s cast and examined his limbs, giving him a once over.\n\u201cYour legs are fine thankfully.\u201d Recover Girl began. \u201cHowever, due to how your arm was broken there will now be scarring left over. Sadly even my quirk can\u2019t fix that. Be careful with it, it\u2019s gonna have some permanent damage after what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d \n\u201cI recommend you get lots of rest at home and try to stay off your feet as best you can. We\u2019re gonna send you off with crutches too so you don\u2019t put too much pressure on them.\u201d\nIzuku nodded, thankful he could finally go home. He was starting to feel a bit stir crazy being at the hospital for so long and being without his phone only drove Izuku more insane.\n\u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d The ocean haired boy gave a shy smile, looking over his arm. He couldn\u2019t believe one man had managed to do this, but he figured in a super human society anything was possible.\nIzuku packed up the rest of his things and slowly began his walk home, grabbing the crutches the nurse had offered him to make his way out of the hospital. Usually he\u2019d opt to take the train home, but given his limited mobility he got an Uber and accepted the fees that came with it.He\u2019d rather spend the extra money than hurt his body more than necessary.Once home, Izuku immediately plugged in his phone and plopped on his bed.Izuku had never been happier to lay on his own bed until now.He was home and safe now.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Guess who\u2019s aliveKacchan is typing\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKacchan is typing?!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Kacchan: Fucking hell, took you long enough. Are you okay now?Deku: You changed your username to Kacchan??Kacchan: Yeah. Thought it might make you happy or whatever\u2026.Deku: It does. Thank you KacchanDeku: I\u2019m okay, but uhKacchan: Uh?Deku: How do I put this\u2026Deku: Might be better if I explain it through words instead of text.Kacchan: Alright.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was quick to call Deku, his fingers practically smashing the call button. He couldn't admit it but he\u2019d missed hearing that nerd's voice, and with the lack of streams his longing only grew.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan?\u201d Deku\u2019s voice rang through, like a beautiful symphony that the forested man had conducted just for Katsuki.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki took in a sharp breath, trying to still his nerves. \u201cHey nerd.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMan, it's been awhile since I\u2019ve talked to you. Well, not really I guess, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get use to how you sound.\u201d A nervous laugh came from the other end of the line.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but feel a blush run across his pale features. The same could be said for how Katsuki felt towards Deku\u2019s soft gentle voice. Every time he heard the greenette speak, it was like electricity through his veins. A tidal wave of evergreen that he\u2019d longed to hear, taking his breath away in the process.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe best way he could describe Deku\u2019s voice was like a home he\u2019d never been to but knew it\u2019s where he belonged. A warm afterglow of fire in the cold winter months that wrapped itself around Katsuki. A song he\u2019d never heard but knew the lyrics to by heart. It was everything he\u2019d longed for but knew he couldn\u2019t have.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, you gonna tell me what happened?\u201d Katsuki barked out, getting a small whine from Deku.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d There was a pause, Deku clearly thinking through his words. \u201cThe man who was harassing me at the gym, he uh.\u201d Another pause as Deku took in a sharp breath. \u201cHe followed me outside, a-and uh. I think he had some kinda quirk that made you do what he said. S-so I followed him. Oh god, Kacchan I\u2026\u201d Deku sobbed out. \u201cI should have been stronger!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s blood went cold, slowly piecing together what exactly had happened. \u201cDeku\u2026 Oi! No! Deku, it's not your fault. Don\u2019t blame yourself for this kinda shit.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI tried to get away, a-and he grabbed me and broke my arm and legs. Everything started going black after that but\u2026 God, I feel so gross Kacchan. Crap, I\u2019m sorry. This is a lot right? I shouldn\u2019t be telling you all of this. You have enough to deal with.\u201d He could hear Deku sobbing at this point, desperately wanting to hold onto the smaller man. Deku was drowning, deep beneath the surface, and Katsuki wanted nothing more than to be someone to grab onto. To pull him back up and allow him to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi!\u201d Katsuki snapped, now feeling a rage boil beneath his skin. \u201cStop that shit! You didn\u2019t cause any of that shit, and I sure as hell ain\u2019t some weak shit that can\u2019t handle hearing this. If I didn\u2019t wanna know I wouldn\u2019t have asked!\u201d Katsuki was shaking, his palms sweating as he tried not to set off any small explosives. He could burn this entire complex down with the rage he felt boiling deep inside him. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d His voice was low, nearly a whisper. \u201cPlease Deku, just let me\u2026 Let me listen. Its the least I can fuckin\u2019 do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a low exhale, Deku clearly trying to calm his nerves. \u201cThank you Kacchan\u2026 I needed that. After they took my cast off, they said uh\u2026 ahem, they said there\u2019d be permanent damage. I have some pretty nasty scars now. Every time I look at them I kinda wanna vomit.\u201d A soft, anxious laugh escaped Deku\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure why he picked me, or why he did what he did. The police are still working on my case but don\u2019t have a lot of answers. But they think they might know why.\u201d Permanent damage? Christ how badly did this man fuck up Deku? When I find this man I\u2019m gonna blow his fucking head off so hard it\u2019d be sent to space.  Katsuki gritted his teeth, trying not to let his rage apparent in his voice else he scare Deku. \u201cWhy?\u201d Was all he could manage out, his blunt nails digging into the palm of his hand, nearly making him bleed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeems he has a thing for hunting down quirkless people, I guess. Least that\u2019s the current theory, since there\u2019s other cases like mine. But each person is quirkless that\u2019s been left like me.\u201d Deku sighs, some rustling sounds on the end of the line that Katsuki can only assume is the freckled man running a hand through his mass of curls. \u201cI guess I should count myself lucky, in a messed up way. A few were found dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat made Katsuki\u2019s blood turn to ice. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Dead?! And Deku dared to think he was somehow lucky after this fucked up thing that had happened to him?! Katsuki wanted to shake the man, yell at him, tell him how he deserved better and that this wasn\u2019t something he should be okay with. But he knew that would only make the situation worse, he knew that would just terrify the poor forested haired boy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre-... are you safe where you live?\u201d The blonde gritted out, fear running rampant through his body.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think so? The gym I go to is 30 minutes or more from where I live, so I doubt the guy could find me.\u201d Deku said, sounding more relaxed now. \u201cI guess the worst part is being alone through this all. Well, physically alone. I at least get to talk to you.\u201d There was a somber tone to how Deku was speaking, clearly wanting to meet Katsuki in person. But could he risk that? Every fiber in his being SCREAMED to meet up with Deku, to finally see the man that made his heart swell and his skin feel like he\u2019d been struck by electricity.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d wondered how the smaller man sounded without the filter of a microphone, how his gentle laugh would seep deep into his skin and pull out every anxiety and fear with it. How those gorgeous emeralds would sparkle looking up to him and him alone, the crinkle of his eyes as he smiled, every inch of him pouring out love.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki wanted that, but he didn\u2019t think he deserved it. Not after who he was as a teen. Sure he\u2019d gotten a lot better and been through years of therapy, but guilt remained heavy in his heart. He was no better than those bullies that pushed Deku down, who treated him like scum of the earth.\n\u00a0\nAnd at the back of his mind, remained a strange confusing memory of green that he couldn\u2019t seem to escape. Something that had drawn himself closer to the stranger he met that fateful day. Katsuki tried not to think about it too hard, but it kept pestering the back of his mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Katsuki grunted out. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you aren\u2019t alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-would\u2026 uh. Would it be weird if we talked longer? Like, if I went to bed and could s-still talk to y-you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA blush crept along Katsuki\u2019s cheeks, he moved his phone away from his face as he stared blankly at it. Did Deku want to fall asleep hearing Katsuki talk?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019dya mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-oh well? Um, I was wondering if\u2026\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cNever mind, forget it. Its dumb.\u201d Another anxious laugh. Katsuki wasn\u2019t having this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku.\u201d A small yelp from the other end of the line. \u201cI can talk to you while you fall asleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was silence, long enough silence that Katsuki was starting to worry Deku had hung up actually. Then, came the softest, gentlest tone that Katsuki had ever heard in his life. \u201cThank you Kacchan. You really get me, huh?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was like diving into the cold ocean on a hot summer day, your body submerged under the endless abyss. Feeling lost but found all at the same time. Katsuki could instantly feel his body slump, his nerves allowing in the calmness that overcame him. That beautiful song he longed for.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Was all Katsuki could rasp out, the feeling of sinking deeper into this man's life slowly encompassing him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe two talked for a few more hours, Katsuki going into his kitchen eventually to start cooking dinner while Deku listened and giggled when Katsuki would swear at something in utter annoyance. It felt like this was how it was meant to be all along. Up until now Katsuki enjoyed the silence his life had brought, the moments where he was alone and could just allow the world to fade behind him.\n\u00a0\nBut now he couldn\u2019t stand the quiet. Now he wanted to hear Deku\u2019s soft voice, the way he could ramble about nothing, how warm his presence felt and how every inch of Katsuki's skin lit up like a forest fire. Every part of his body had started to long for the freckled boy that was starting to steal his heart nearly two months ago.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki had never believed in love at first sight, but he was slowly starting to wonder about it.\n\u00a0\nWhen night began to make its way in, Katsuki couldn\u2019t help but look out his large window to see the sun set and stars creep their way across the sky. \u201cHey, Deku.\u201d Katsuki hummed, hearing some shifting sounds from the other end.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes Kacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou by a window?\u201d Katsuki ran a hand through his hair, wondering now if maybe this was a dumb idea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh, no. Why?\u201d Deku chirped out, now shifting from where he\u2019d sat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo near one, nerd.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust do it!\u201d Katsuki barked out, feeling the flush rise to his ears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Deku laughed, scrambling to get to a nearby window. \u201cAlright. I\u2019m by a window.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d There was a long pause before Katsuki spoke. \u201cAnytime you feel alone, try and look up at the sky. Cause we\u2019re always gonna be lookin\u2019 under the same sky, the same stars, the same moon. Got it?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nSilence came, Katsuki now feeling panicked he\u2019d said something wrong, or even gone too far. The blonde started shifting from foot to foot, feeling embarrassed and awkward. Then, Deku finally spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan\u2026\u201d His voice was shaky. \u201cThat\u2026 Wow. T-thank you.\u201d He could hear the sob coming out of Deku\u2019s throat, the way his words started to tremble into a mess before them.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThere was a sad reality before them both. They were both alone, but in different ways. Katsuki had chosen to be alone, and had chosen to push people away. while Izuku had been pushed away, he had no choice in this isolation. But in the end, both longed to be found, long to find someone else that could understand them in a way that no one in this society could. It was poetic, in some sad messed up way. Each wanting the other for different but all to similar reasons, two sides of the same coin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen the sky had finally gone black and stars had crept along the endless abyss, the two remained. No words spoken, just comfortable in the other's silence. A comfort that neither were used to but both welcomed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmm\u2026 Kacchan\u2026\u201d Deku finally spoke. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to have you as a friend. I don\u2019t really deserve your kindness but I\u2019m very glad I have it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s heart was pulled up into his throat, feeling each yank as Deku spoke.  No, It's me who\u2019s undeserving.  Katsuki thought, pulling on the hem of his shirt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou deserve better than what the world has given you.\u201d Was all Katsuki could say. And it was true, spoken as though it was as obvious as the moon in the sky or the ground beneath their feet. Katsuki was many things, but he wasn\u2019t a liar. Far from it in fact.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-\u201d There came another anxious laugh, one Katsuki hated to hear. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that Kacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI do.\u201d Katsuki said plainly. Time and time again the world seemed to knock down Deku, and time and time again he would stand back up. But this time, Katsuki only hoped he could catch him once he fell.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou seem so sure of that.\u201d Another laugh, but this time not full of anxiety. No, a genuine laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of everything I do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA roar of laughter that pulled Katsuki\u2019s heart came from the other end of the line, like a song that Katsuki had longed to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re a very interesting person, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m one of a kind.\u201d Katsuki beamed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY\u2019know, I can\u2019t help but believe you on that one.\u201d There was some sound of movement then a soft \u2018oof\u2019 sound and finally soft rustling. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you, Kacchan. I\u2019m honestly jealous of your confidence.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTch, ought to gain some confidence then nerd ass.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAn adorable soft chuckle came from Deku, making Katsuki\u2019s ears start to burn. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to add that to the list of things to pick up from the store, how about that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but laugh, this little shithead. \u201cYeah? I\u2019ll be sure to point it out at the market. Make sure you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll be taking me to the market, Kacchan~?\u201d Deku practically purred, only making Katsuki\u2019s face light up in flames. This. Little. Shithead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly to make sure you actually pick up groceries for once, maybe help your gangly ass build some mass.\u201d A spark had been set, and Katsuki was oh too thrilled to set the match ablaze and watch this fire burn. He dared this challenge.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOoooh, sure thing. And I\u2019m so positive you\u2019re the embodiment of manhood, huh?\u201d Deku chuckled darkly, his voice dipping into a lower octave. This was bait, and Katsuki was ready to take it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn straight I am! Over 6ft tall, with perfect muscular arms, a 6 pack, I\u2019m great!\u201d Katsuki boomed, letting his ego get to his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cProve it.\u201d Was all Deku had to say.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s brain nearly broke, feeling that threatening blush creep its way down his neck. There were many things the blonde loved, and a challenge was one of them. How dare this shitty nerd try and insinuate that he WASN\u2019T what he said! Katsuki knew just how hot he was, though, this nerd clearly didn\u2019t. And he couldn\u2019t exactly send a selfie, showing his face would be an entire mess. But, you also didn\u2019t need to show your face to show off how muscular you are.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright. Bet.\u201d Katsuki smirked, those wolfish teeth visible now as he charged to his home gym. \u201cJust don\u2019t blame me when you realize how hot I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHmmm, don\u2019t hold your breath, Kacchan.\u201d Deku giggled.\n\u00a0\nPositioning himself in front of his mirror, Katsuki made sure to align the camera so it wouldn\u2019t show any of his face, then took the picture. He was sporting his usual black tank top and black sweatpants with a white line down the middle. For extra show he flexed out his left arm to show the muscles along his biceps, allowing the tight tank top to pull to his pecs and grip to his body. He\u2019d have taken the damn thing off but knew he had some very obvious scars that a superfan would no doubt notice and pick up on. Alas, the abs were saved for another day.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTold ya.\u201d Katsuki smirked, sending the picture over feeling every inch of pride in his body.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was silence, which sent fear through Katsuki\u2019s mind. Did Deku figure it out? Did he figure out the truth? Fuck fuck fuck fuck! Katsuki\u2019s mouth felt dry as he stared at his phone, unsure of what to say next-\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Wait, did Deku just swear? \u201cI-I mean. Wow. Okay then.\u201d Deku paused to clear his throat, trying to settle down his nerves. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were serious, holy crap. What job do you have that you need a body like?!\u201d Deku sputters for a second. \u201cT-that?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA booming laugh left Katsuki\u2019s body as he wandered back into his living room. \u201cSo you like what you see, I take it?\u201d At this point Katsuki wasn\u2019t sure if he was just boosting his own ego or genuinely curious if Deku liked what he saw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan! D-don\u2019t make fun of me! Geez!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho said I was making fun of you?\u201d The blonde practically purred, earning a small yelp from the end of the other line.  Cute. \n\u00a0\n\u201cCause\u2026\u201d Deku paused, a loud sigh spilling from his lips. \u201cCause everyone makes fun of me for stuff like this.\u201d\u201cStuff like this?\u201d Katsuki sat on his large black leather sofa, a brow cocked though at no one in particular.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY\u2019know, the whole\u2026\u201d A long nervous pause, ss Deku thinks on what to say next. \u201cNot being straight, thing...\u201d His voice was practically a whisper as he spoke. Each word wobbles and is softer than the last.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki froze, his face turning 4 shades redder. Did he just hear that right? Did Deku seriously just confirm that he was into guys? \u201cSo, you\u2026\u201d Katsuki gulped, his hands feeling sweaty all of a sudden. \u201cYou\u2019re into guys?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, uh\u2026 sorry, is that an issue?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo! No\u2026 Not at all.\u201d The blonde cleared his throat, trying to carefully think of what to say. \u201cI uh, I\u2019m also \u2018not straight\u2019, as you put it.\u201d Never in his entire life had Katsuki felt so completely and utterly small. He\u2019d faced off against some of the baddest villains this world had seen, but in this very moment he felt unbelievably small. Maybe that was the power Deku had over him?\n\u00a0\n\u201cR-really? With how you talked I honestly figured you were extremely straight I\u2019m gonna be honest.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHah?! Stereotypes much?!\u201d Katsuki barked out, his face only growing redder by the second. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m gay as hell! How the fuck did you think I was straight? Let alone Extremely Straight\u201d Before Katsuki could stop the words, they had already spilled out and instantly he regretted it. Was it too late to move to another country and change his name?\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe whole \u2018macho man\u2019 thing, I guess. And all the swearing. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve met very very few LGBT people so I kinda just assume everyone is straight.. Kinda embarrassing, huh?\u201d Deku said meekly, which honestly only added to the cuteness.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do realize you can be gay and swear a lot? And be, as you call it, a macho man.\u201d Katsuki snickered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cY-yeah! I know!\u201d Deku gasped out. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to! Sorry, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said you\u2019ve never met many LGBT people before, right?\u201d Katsuki knew he was gonna regret asking this. He knew this was far too personal of a question to dare ask anyone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou ever dated a guy before?\u201d Welp, the question was out now. And the regret was already seeping deep into his skin.\u00a0\n\u201cH-have I ever dated a guy? Is that what you said?\u201d Izuku\u2019s face was bright red at this point. Had he heard him correctly? That can\u2019t be right?\u201cYeah.\u201d It was a simple reply, but it was laced in anxiety. Kacchan\u2019s voice unnaturally quiet and unsure.\n\u201cW-well, uh. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d consider it dating but I did hook up with a guy once. But that\u2019s really it. Y-you?\u201d Izuku was chewing on his bottom lip by this point, feeling the pressure of this entire conversation.\nHe had somehow fallen for this mysterious man and he couldn\u2019t even explain why or how. He didn\u2019t know his real name, how he looked, or much about him in general. And yet he felt so instantly connected to him and wanted nothing more than to be closer to the stranger.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never dated before. Hell, I\u2019ve never even kissed someone.\u201d Kacchan made a short anxious laugh, which was rare for the man. He was always booming with confidence, but in this very instant he felt small and unsure of himself.\n\u201cW-wait, really?! No, there\u2019s no way.\u201d Izuku giggled out, genuine shock laced in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026 well you!\u201d\n\u201cYeah well, most people annoy me. Back in high school girls would ask me out all the time, trying to \u2018fix\u2019 me or whatever the fuck. Annoyed the shit out of me. I had considered going out with a few guys but they were a distraction. Least that\u2019s what I told myself. I needed to focus on schoolwork and being the best at it.\u201d\nIzuku was floored, he couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Kacchan must have been extremely popular in school to have so many girls swooning for him, and to think he denied them all in favor of schoolwork. Back in school Izuku couldn\u2019t even GET girls to talk to him, let alone any that wanted him. And guys? Hah, no way.\n\u201cI- wow. Kacchan you\u2019re amazing.\u201d The forested haired boy laughed, feeling that familiar comfort wrap around him like a warm blanket. \u201cHow uh, how exactly did you know you were gay then? I-I mean, I\u2019m sorry that sounds rude right? Ugh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt's a fair question, all things considered. I uh\u2026 Hmmm. Every time I thought about being with a girl I felt nothing. I figured it was just cause I was so focused on school to care, but the more I thought about it the more I started to wonder why it was. Then I\u2019d look at guys and it felt so much different. I dunno\u2026 Something about being with a cute guy that was smaller than me, that I could wrap my arms around felt so much better. The term \u2018boyfriend\u2019 made me feel a certain kinda way that \u2018girlfriend\u2019 couldn\u2019t. Kinda lame huh?\u201d\nIzuku couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. His entire face, neck, and even chest were bright red and burning. His heart was hammering in his chest like a drum, his hands starting to feel sweaty and shaky. His mind went 100 MPH with thoughts he couldn\u2019t even stop.\nBig strong arms wrapped around his lithe frame, a hand pulling his face up to look into piercing eyes that could consume his entire being that he\u2019d welcome. Safety in those big hands that could protect him from anything. \n\u201cN-no, it's not lame. I uh, I felt the same way honestly. Something was nice about the idea of being another guy's boyfriend or heck, maybe his husband. I still like girls but, maybe I just have a preference for guys. But no one was really interested in me in high school or uh, even now.\u201d A soft anxious laugh escaped Izuku\u2019s lips.\nThere was a soft grunt from Kacchan\u2019s line that only increased the anxiety in Izuku\u2019s gut. Maybe he said too much? Crap!\n\u201cI think anyone who wouldn\u2019t want you is dumb as hell.\u201d His voice was soft, softer than Izuku was used to. Gentle like a current you just stepped into, cool and inviting against the blistering sun.\nIzuku stared down at his phone that sat upon his lap, his eyes fixed on the name and icon. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Was Kacchan serious? \n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Izuku laughed out, his hand moving up to his lips to press on the bite marks he started to make.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some bullshit! Deku, I\u2019m gonna come beat your ass! Fuck, you don\u2019t even see yourself how others see you, huh?\u201d Kacchan screamed, a loud bang heard from the muffled mic.\n\u201cS-see myself l-like others see me? What do you mean, Kacchan?\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d A loud grumble, followed by some moving sounds, and even more grumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking cute, dickhead. You have a cute smile n\u2019 shit. You\u2019re also fuckin\u2019 nice and make people smile all the damn time. Your entire audience is fuckin\u2019 in love with your nerdass. I\u2019m shocked you can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 see that shit.\u201d\nIzuku sat there in absolute shock, running a hand through his tangled curls in astonishment. Did Kacchan seriously just call him cute?! \u201cI- uh. Ahem. Wow that\u2019s a lot. Holy crap. I\u2019m sorry, I guess I just never had a lot of confidence. Got bullied a lot in school for how I look, as I\u2019ve told you. It was either how I looked \u2018too plain\u2019 or \u2018too girly\u2019. I was pretty nervous to even try streaming, let alone show my face. But I figured if it went badly I could just stop, y\u2019know? But it somehow worked out.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally the least plain looking person I know, freckles.\u201d Kacchan snorted a laugh, his anger seeming to diminish. \u201cGreen hair, green eyes, freckles everywhere? What the hell is plain about that? Sounds like the other kids were just jealous or some shit.\u201d\nA soft cute laugh escaped Izuku\u2019s lips as he listened to his far more explosive friend. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, Kacchan. Not much to be jealous of. Poor, quirkless, single mom, not exactly something people want.\u201d\n\u201cProbably jealous of your good heart. You radiate warmth, even when you don\u2019t try to.\u201d Kacchan spoke, his words honest and cut right through Izuku. \n\u201cWhat do you\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d \n\u201cYou have this weirdly magnetic pull towards you. You have a kind heart, and it pisses me off. Your stupid smile is all encompasing, like the damn sun. People see that shit, Deku. But most people have their heads shoved up their ass so they can\u2019t see it properly. You got something other people don\u2019t, and they\u2019re jealous of that kinda shit.\u201d\nThe world faded around Izuku as Kacchan spoke, he couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Was Kacchan right? Was he really like that? From what he knew, Kacchan never lied and spoke very matter of factly. \n\u201cYou\u2019re too sweet to me\u2026\u201d Izuku mumbled out, wrapping his arms around his head to hide his embarrassment. \u201cI don\u2019t really deserve this kinda kindness, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said before. You deserve better than what the world has given you, Deku.\u201d His words were gentle, calm and collected. Izuku couldn\u2019t help but believe the man.\n\u201cI- thank you Kacchan.\u201d Was all Izuku could think to say. He wasn\u2019t sure Kacchan was right, but he wasn\u2019t not sure about what he\u2019d said either.\nWith a loud yawn Izuku curled up into bed more, exhaustion slowly taking hold of him. It\u2019d been a long day, and felt even longer after he and Kacchan\u2019s talk. Izuku wrapped himself up in his large comforter with a heavy sigh. \n\u201cGettin\u2019 tired?\u201d Kacchan asked, his voice low and gravely. \n\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s been a long day. Long week really.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the hell you went through.\u201d \n\u201cHey Kacchan, c-could you do something for me?\u201d Izuku mumbled out, feeling his ears start to burn up.\n\u201cWassup nerd?\u201d\n\u201cCould you read to me until I fall asleep?\u201d\nKacchan was quiet for a moment, then came a shuffling sound and Kacchan clearing his throat. \u201cIt was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me.\u201d \nIzuku could already feel his eyelids grow heavy at the beautiful tones of Kacchan\u2019s voice. It was like a melody to his ears that he wished he could play on loop for all of eternity.\n\u201cI was a child and she was a child, in this kingdom by the sea, but we loved with a love that was more than love\u2014 I and my Annabel Lee\u2014 With a love that the wing\u00e8d seraphs of Heaven coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom by the sea, a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling my beautiful Annabel Lee;\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s mind began to wander, picturing him and Kacchan by the sea. His forested green hair tousled by the ocean air, the smell of sea salt flaring his nostrils. A cold cloudy day, just he and Kacchan, alone together. Hand in hand as they walk along the water, feeling the cool breeze run through his body but never truly feeling cold so long as he was with Kacchan. His warmth would be enough for him.\nThey would stare out into the endless nothing, watching the abyss below. Fearing nothing for they had each other, and needed no one else. They would be voyagers of their own paths, together hand in hand. \nKacchan would smile down at him, pulling his face up closer so their lips may touch. The smell of campfire and smoke radiating off of the taller man. A burning flame that had caught Izuku nearly two months ago that he never wished to extinguish. \nIn this kingdom by the sea, it was just them. Forever and endless.\n-------\nBEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP\nIzuku\u2019s head shot up, scanning his room as he tried to figure out where the noise was coming from. The freckled boy glared at his alarm clock, clicking the snooze button as he slumped back in bed. It was 10am, and Izuku wasn\u2019t ready for the day. \nGrabbing his phone he noticed that Kacchan had ended the call around 4am, probably when he\u2019d woken up. Izuku couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang in his heart at the sudden loss of Kacchan\u2019s voice, but was well aware the man had a busy schedule.\nWith a heavy sigh, Izuku got himself off his bed and wandered into his kitchen. Today was usually a streaming day but he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be wise to try and talk to so many people given what had happened. As much of a workaholic Izuku was, he knew his own limits. Usually at least.\nPeering into his fridge, Izuku was quick to realize most of his food had either gone bad or there wasn\u2019t enough to make jack diddly shit.\nWith yet another heavy sigh, Izuku walked to his bathroom to start getting ready to head to the shops. Lucky for him it was only a 10 minute walk, which made him feel far less anxious. Once dressed, and an attempt to manage his mess of curls, Izuku was off, though nearly forgetting his crutches in the process. \nThe weather was still pretty cold all things considered, but he couldn\u2019t really complain. The forested boy almost liked the cold, it made his own home feel all the more cozy. Even if the central heating was garbage. \nOnce he had made it to the store, Izuku went off to grab the basics. Eggs, meat, rice, ect and ect. It was in a particular isle that Izuku was attempting to grab an item off of a high shelf. Damn his shortness!!\nIzuku spotted a taller gentlemen, and with the worlds politest tone he spoke. \u201cU-uh, excuse me. Could you perhaps grab th-the nori for me off th-the top shelf? Sorry.\u201d\n---------\nThere was no fucking way this was happening. First Katsuki is stationed in Deku\u2019s fucking city, and then when he\u2019s out trying to pick up shit for lunch of all the fucking people he could run into its DEKU?! NO!\nLucky for Katsuki he was in his typical disguise, black medical mask, a black beanie to hide his intense spiky blonde hair, and even more black for his clothes. He stared down at the smaller man and oh fucking hell. Deku was so much smaller than him, and even when he had known this fact the impact wasn\u2019t lessened. He was adorably small, with the brightest eyes the man had ever seen. And those curls, those gorgeous soft curls that Katsuki wanted to run his fingers through. \nGod was clearly testing him, and it wasn\u2019t fucking fair. Some might consider this moment romantic, a moment he can remove his mask and reveal himself. Show Deku that he was Kacchan all along and absolutely ravage the boy. Kiss his beautiful soft lips, leave bite marks all along his neck as the two intertwine and never let go.\nBut no, Katsuki had to be a good boy and pretend this wasn\u2019t happening. This was like something out of this worst damn nightmare.\nKatsuki only let out a small grunt, knowing full well if he spoke Deku would figure out who he was and this would be over even faster than he could imagine. Again, his worst nightmare.\nReaching up, Katsuki grabbed the nori off the top shelf and handed it back to Deku. His hands shaking the entire time and his face showing clear signs of blush.\n\u201cOh goodness! Are you okay? You look flushed! Are you sick? Here, come with me. We can get you some water!\u201d Deku smiled, and god fucking damnit that smile. It lit up the entire room, no the entire world. It was brighter than the sun. His gorgeous emerald eyes practically sparkling as they crinkled up.\nKatsuki felt like he was gonna faint, this was way too much. He needed to get out of there ASAP before Deku figured out who he was, or godforbid his sunshine like happiness makes him fall even MORE in love with the guy.\nDramatically shaking his head, Katsuki stared at the smaller man with absolute panic in his eyes and made a break for the exit. Fuck getting lunch, he needed to get out of there and flee. Deku looked confused and honestly a little hurt at his sudden escape, but there was no time to worry about that.\n---------\nIzuku watched as the strange man in all black seemed to almost flee from him in a state of what he could only describe intense fear. Izuku couldn\u2019t help but wonder if there was something terrifying about how he looked. He still had left over bruises from the event, and being on crutches couldn\u2019t help his disposition.\nWith a heavy heart, Izuku made his way to the check out line to buy his groceries and head home. Maybe Kacchan could have a laugh about the entire ordeal? Izuku made his way home and slowly put his groceries away before starting on breakfast.\n\u201cKacchan would probably be so proud of me! Making breakfast and actually getting new groceries instead of trying to eat spoiled meat! You\u2019re really going up in the world, Izuku.\u201d He laughed to himself, sitting down for his breakfast on the end table of his very small kitchen. \u201cThank you for the food!\u201d Izuku called out to no one before clapping his hands together.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Deku: Kacchan! You\u2019d be so proud of me! I made breakfast and even went to the shops!Deku: There was a guy at the market though and I think I scared him\u2026 o(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)oDeku: I\u2019m not even sure what I did but the poor guy looked terrified for some reason. (\u25d5\ufe35\u25d5)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKatsuki still hadn\u2019t fully shaken off seeing Deku in person, and honestly felt a little wrong. He knew who Deku was, at least a lot about him. Meanwhile the forested haired man knew almost nothing about him. Was it even safe for Deku to know his real identity? It\u2019d make him susceptible to villain attacks.\nAnd yet, there was an overbearing pain burning in his chest that clawed at his ribs to get out. He so desperately wanted to tell Deku who he was and see if they could maybe attempt a normal relationship. He got the confirmation that the other was into men, and he seemed frazzled looking at the picture Katsuki had sent. Could that mean the other felt the same? Katsuki had never dated before, and he was shit with feelings, but something in him screamed that it had to be true. \nThough, now with the rise of that apparent Quirkless Killer on the loose, it only added to the stress Katsuki felt to reveal himself to Deku. Maybe if he did he could take him to his home, keep him safe and away from those dangers. But on the other hand, this might paint an even bigger tarket on his back.\nGripping at his hair, Katsuki let out an annoyed sigh. This was why he never bothered talking to people, the emotional turmoil sucked.\nPING\nKatsuki was brought out of his thoughts by that familiar sound. Reaching into his pocket the blonde pulled out his phone and thumbed through the notifications, a soft smile falling upon his lips. Thought maybe the turmoil was worth it after all.\nIzuku sat at his PC, staring at himself in the webcam. It has been two weeks now since he was let out from the hospital, and he was now able to get around without crutches finally. His limbs were fully healed, but his mind didn\u2019t. Often at night Izuku would have panic attacks, needing to call Kacchan to help calm him down in fear someone was going to break into his apartment.\n\u00a0\nWith a heavy sigh Izuku clicked Go Live and waited for his viewers to pile in. Izuku couldn\u2019t ignore them forever and sitting around doing nothing all day wasn\u2019t good for him either.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\nLooneyMoon: Deku is back!!\nShamblam: Ahhh Deku-Chan!!\nCatInBlack: Deku we were so worried for you!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku let out a soft anxious laugh, trying to put on his best smile. \u201cH-hey everyone! Sorry for being gone for so long. As you guys know, something pretty awful happened recently that left me in the hospital. The police are still trying to figure things out but they might have a lead!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\nCrispyCreams: Oh Deku baby what happened? You look exhausted :(\nLeoLion: Ahhh Deku!!! He returns!!\nDekusWifu: My baby :(\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Oh wow you\u2019re actually live today.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cAhh, hey there Kacchan.\u201d Izuku beamed, feeling a bit more at ease when he saw the familiar username pop up. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m still pretty tired. But I missed talking to you all. The guy who assaulted me got me pretty good.\u201d Izuku let out another nervous laugh, rolling up his sleeve to show off the scarring now littering his arm. \u201cThis arm got the brunt of it all as you can see. Sadly they couldn\u2019t do anything about the scarring so this is permanent now. B-but it\u2019s okay! I\u2019m just thankful to be alive!\u201d Izuku smiled, looking at his hand with a somber expression.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh! Another thing!\u201d The greenette smiled, remembering a critical detail of that night. \u201cAccording to the report none other than DynaMight came to save me! Can you believe that! Apparently he found me passed out in an alleyway and helped get me to the EMT! I\u2019m sad I couldn\u2019t thank him properly, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s busy anyways, and gets a lot of mail anyways from fans\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe forested haired boy twiddled his fingers some, looking over the now crooked fingers. \u201cI just hope he knows how much I appreciate him, yknow?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: I\u2019m sure he knows how thankful you are.\nBonesOfInk87: Yeah! Plus he got to carry your cute little self ;)\nBeansOfTruth: Okay don\u2019t be weird.Candy8223: I\u2019m sure DynaMight knows :D He\u2019s #1 for a reason! PokePop: Maybe send him an email? He has an official site right?\n77867: Hey there cutie~\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nIzuku froze on the spot, staring at the newest message that popped up. His blood went cold, and his vision started to blur. It had been exactly what that man said to him that night. Panic was rising beneath Izuku\u2019s skin and he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n Just calm down Izuku, it\u2019s just a coincidence. The greenette thought to himself, feeling his palms grow sweaty.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nChat:\n77867: it\u2019s a shame we had to cut that evening so short but I had places to be. I miss your cute little face though, kitten.\nKingDoom: Hey dude that\u2019s not funny, what the fuck?!\nAgentOfChaos: Dude fuck off!! This isn\u2019t funny!\nMermaidLover64: Can someone report this guy??\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Deku?? Hey are you okay?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku started to hyperventilate, his vision was going darker by the second. This couldn\u2019t be happening! Not now! This meant the man who assaulted him KNEW who he was! Had he been stalking him? Did he know where he lived?! Did he-\n\u00a0\nPING\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKacchan: Deku! Deku calm down!\nKacchan: You\u2019re okay!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku stared at the DM on his screen, his eyes brimming with tears that dared to leak out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Kacchan\u2026 \n\n\u00a0\nWith a shaky breath Izuku stared back at the chat, desperately trying to steel himself as he grabbed his mouse and clicked the ban button over the user.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n It\u2019s fine Izuku, you can just block the guy and move on. Calm down! \n\n\u00a0\n\u201cW-well that was annoying, but anyways as I was saying-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n77877: Now that\u2019s now very nice of you Izuchan~ You should know better than to just block me.\nMemerbread: izuchan???\nLovelyInsideOut22: What the fuck?! He has multiple accounts?!\nDangerSense: Stalker alert!! Everyone report!!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n No! No this can\u2019t be happening! \n\n\u00a0\nIzuku was trembling in his seat, he didn\u2019t know what to do. This was supposed to be a fun relaxing stream after being gone for so long!\n\u00a0\n\u201cP-please just to away\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n77877: You\u2019re so cute when you cry~\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: You\u2019ll regret saying that kinda shit here. I\u2019m gonna bust your face in you fucking freak.\n77877: Oh. Izuchans little boy toy. Don\u2019t worry, you can have him once I\u2019m done. Though I can\u2019t promise there will be many pieces left once I\u2019m through.\n\n User 77877 has been banned \n\n77887: Geez, all these bans. Kitten you\u2019re starting to annoy me.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Deku was trembling on stream while this freak was just toying with him! Katsuki had opened his IP tracker on his other monitor trying to figure out who this guy was, while still trying to pay attention to what was happening on stream.\n\u00a0\nHe wanted nothing more than to run over there to Deku and save him! Fucking explode this creep and be the hero Deku needed right now! Ugh! Fuck this!\n\u00a0\nPING\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKacchan: Deku! Please just breathe! Call me if you need to!!!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\u00a0\nKatsuki didn\u2019t know what to do, he wasn\u2019t exactly good at comforting people. He took courses on helping victims during tragedy but nothing could prepare him for this! His hands were shaking and small explosions kept getting set off by his own anxiety, this was the second mouse he had to plug in after he destroyed the first one when Creepy Fuck showed up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod Fucking damnit! Who the fuck is this guy?!\u201d Katsuki hissed, now going to grab his phone.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki didn\u2019t have many friends but the ones he did have he kept close and knew they were loyal. He had one particular friend in mind who might be able to help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBakubabe! You haven\u2019t called in so long, whats up-\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan it raccoon eyes, I need your help.\u201d Katsuki spat, his entire body feeling like it was going to rupture with the rage he felt deep into his bones.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I sense someone is a bit maaaad~\u201d Mina laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRemember that case I was on? With the guy that got attacked by a lead to the Quirkless Killer?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith the cutie with green hair?\u201d Mina cooed back into the phone.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki huffed, running a hand down his face. \u201cYeah. That one. Well the guy streams and it looks like the guy might also be his stalker.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait\u2026 you found the cuties twitch? Kitty Kat this goes beyond just checking in on someone you have a case for. What\u2019s going on? Isn\u2019t this kinda work left to detectives?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFucking- ugh! I\u2019ll explain later! I just need your fucking help! If you can\u2019t do shit then I\u2019ll go to dunce face!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGeez okay, okay! Text me the link and I\u2019ll see what I can do!\u201d Mina groaned, clearly wanting more of the \u201ctea\u201d on the situation, as she calls it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d Katsuki grunted before hanging up.\n\u00a0\nIn a flash he was texting her the link and any other information that might be helpful. As Katsuki moved back to his desk he watched Deku, who was still mostly frozen in his spot. His heart aches watching the poor man look so terrified, but Katsuki didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s when an idea struck him.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n PING \n\n\u00a0\n\n KACCHAN IS CALLING\u2026. \n\n\u00a0\nIzuku snapped out of his daze when suddenly his phone started going off, that familiar ring from Discord. Kacchan was calling him?! On stream?! Nervously Izuku went to grab his phone, slowly clicking the accept button.\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan\u2026?\u201d Izuku could barely speak, fear spiked through his entire being. He felt sick.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku, I need you to breathe. You\u2019re hyperventilating.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan he found me! He knows who I am!\u201d Izuku rasped out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay. I need you to keep streaming, someone I know is trying to trace his IP and find out who he is.\u201d Katuski sounded calm and reassuring, even in his own state of panic. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay, Deku. I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cB-but what if it isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Izuku wailed, tucking his knees into himself.\n\u00a0\nThe chat was going ballistic, everyone reporting the constant new accounts of the unknown user. New viewers flooded in to see what was happening and trying to help report or even making fun of Izuku. He just wanted to curl into a ball and cry. Shut off the stream and pretend this never happened.\n\u00a0\nThis was too much. When he started streaming he never thought THIS would become a reality!\n\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan I\u2019m so scared\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku felt like his world was crumbling around him, slowly suffocating him as the very air he breathed was ripped from his lungs. Wrapped up in the claws of the beast that came for him that night, unable to escape.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku\u2026\u201d came Kacchan\u2019s voice again. \u201cI am here. I won\u2019t let anything happen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLike snow thawing on the first day of spring, a warmth ran through Izuku\u2019s timid body. He was okay, he was going to be okay. Kacchan wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to him. He just had to stay calm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust keep streaming, okay? I\u2019ll call you once I know more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cO-okay K-Kacchan. Th-thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d Katsuki said simply, but it was the best thing that Izuku had ever heard in that moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmm\u2026.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku hung up, and faced the beast before him. He wasn\u2019t going to back down without a fight. Scared out of his mind and shaking like a leaf, Izuku stared into his camera, his eyes a burning forest fire he dared to set ablaze.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Come at me. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMina had been sat at her desk for nearly an hour now trying to track down this guy that Kats had asked from her. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard but the guy kept changing accounts and different IPs every couple of seconds. She felt exhausted, and just wanted some coffee but she knew she couldn\u2019t leave to grab any.\nThe boy before her had been talking the entire hour now, still trembling and trying to get his words out. But he was doing a decent job at keeping the stalker there and even entertaining Mina while he tried to track the man down.\n\u00a0\nShe was aware there was some kind of story with Kats and this Deku person, but today wasn\u2019t the day to learn about it. Hopefully in the future once this freak is behind bars.\n\u00a0\nWith a loud huff, Mina sat up to crack her back and stretch some before getting back to work but was paused by someone entering her little office space.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa! Hey I know that guy! He\u2019s the one Bakugou was adamant about trying to find!\u201d\u2019 Kirishima wandered in, his usual big toothy smile on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Kiri! Yeah he asked me to find some stalker on the guys stream. But the guy keeps changing accounts and it\u2019s hard to track him. Ugh!!\u201d The pink haired woman groaned, pulling at her fluffy locks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBakugou seems super invested in this little guy.\u201d Kirishima smiled, watching the greenette ramble on about heroes. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty cute actually, now that I see him without a bunch of bruises.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe looked that bad huh?\u201d Mina lamented, her eyes drawn back to the green haired man.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, the guy looked half dead when we found him. Heck, Bakugou looked like he just got told his parents were dead. Poor guy couldn\u2019t stop shaking. He wanted to be at the hospital with him too but we all had to go fill out paperwork and he didn\u2019t wanna terrify the green bean.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the story, there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEh, can\u2019t really say. You know how he is, dude is private about everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUgh\u2026!! But he tells you stuff! You\u2019re his best friend!\u201d Mina groaned, gripping at her hair again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry babe, I\u2019m left in the dark too.\u201d Kirishima laughed, patting Mina on the shoulder. \u201cMaybe once you can track this guy down he\u2019ll tell you the story as thanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat lit a fire under Mina that she didn\u2019t know she needed. With her new motivation she went back to trying to figure out who the mysterious stalker was and maybe get their cranky friend a cute boyfriend in the process!\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku had officially been streaming for 6 hours now. He felt exhausted, his throat was starting to hurt, and he was running out of topics to ramble about. His viewer count was great, but that seemed to be mostly because of people coming in to try and help report the stalker. But it\u2019s not like he could just sit there and do nothing while Kacchan tries to figure out who the mystery stalker was.\n\u00a0\nIt was now 11:47, and Izuku had to be up for class tomorrow. He had no idea how much longer he had to keep this up to help find the stalker, but he felt exhausting creeping up each hour he kept steaming.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEventually though Izuku\u2019s stomach began to growl, his face turned flushed with embarrassment. \u201cOh gosh! S-sorry about that! I haven\u2019t had dinner yet since I\u2019ve been streaming for so long.\u201d Izuku let out a soft nervous laugh, running a hand through his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat\n77990: Aw my poor baby is hungry. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll fix that for you\nAlienQueen: Ew, stop being weird dude\u2026\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: Fuck off creep!\nBonesOfAsh53: This dude needs to seriously stop.\n\n User 77990 has been banned \n\n77991: Again with that?\u00a0\n77991: Now now Kitten, you know I hate being ignored.\n\n User 77991 has been banned \n\n77992: Kitten, you\u2019re starting to annoy me. Keep this up and I\u2019ll have to do something drastic.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nIzuku was trembling again, unsure of what else this man could do. There\u2019s no way he knew where he lived, right? He was safe, he was fine he was-\n\u00a0\nDING DONG\n\u00a0\nthe doorbell?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku froze, staring at the entrance way to his apartment. Another ring, and Izuku slowly stood to walk towards the door. His body felt woozy, his vision going blurry as he made his way over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWh-who is it?\u201d Izuku asked, getting on his tiptoes to peer out the peephole. It was a man in a red baseball cap with grey hair that had a few pastel pink stripes in it, his skin a nice olive shade.\n\u00a0\nThis wasn\u2019t the man that Izuku had met that night. No, this was someone else.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGot a delivery for a uhh\u2026 Deku?\u201d The man answered.\n\u00a0\nSlowly Izuku unlocked the door, keeping his distance from the man. Least if he was attacked again he was on stream so they could see his face if Izuku simply ran back to his setup. The stranger gave an awkward smile before handing him the mysterious bag. It smelt amazing, whatever it was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust sign here, and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d The man huffed but Izuku did as he was told before closing the door and staring at the bag with a puzzled expression.\n\u00a0\nHe slowly wandered back to his desk, unsure of what to do now. Did Kacchan order him food? No he didn\u2019t know his address, so that would only leave\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuddenly Izuku felt sick. That delicious food no longer smelt good but like bile, he wanted to vomit.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nChat:\n77996: looks like my kitten got his food~\nAlienQueen: oh my god\n[TOP DONOR] KaboomKing: what the fuck?!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPanic and fear. That\u2019s the only feeling Katsuki could feel right now. That fucker had found Deku\u2019s address and ordered him food! What kind of sick twisted game was this guy playing?!\n\u00a0\nKatsuki was shaking with rage and fear, he didn\u2019t know what to do. If he went and got Deku from his home for safety that\u2019d only add problems but he couldn\u2019t just leave him there either! This was dangerous!\n\u00a0\nKatsuki quickly opened up Discord to message Deku, his hands trembling over the keys.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nKacchan: DO NOT EAT THAT!!!\nKacchan: This is ridiculous! Just end stream now! Fuck it we\u2019ll find this asshole another way! We need to get you somewhere safe!! Fuck this!!!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nKatsuki watched as Deku read the messages then quickly looked back to the camera. He gave a small awkward smile before telling everyone he needed to go. He looked like he was about to cry again, it broke Katsuki\u2019s heart.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOnce the stream was over Katsuki grabbed his phone to call Deku, his heart racing the entire time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan!\u201d Deku wailed, his voice sounding raw.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku, we need to get you somewhere safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t stop shaking! K-Kacchan what do I do?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki felt like his world was sinking in. This wasn\u2019t what was supposed to happen. Everything was wrong and he needed to fix it!\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku, I\u2019m gonna get you a hotel far from where you\u2019re at. I only know which city you\u2019re in, so I\u2019ll get a hotel outside of it. Can you get there? I\u2019ll give you money for a taxi or something if you need.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cN-no\u2026 please you\u2019ve spent too much money on me as is\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck if I care! Some psycho stalker is after you! I\u2019m getting the fucking hotel.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA-are you gonna be there\u2026?\u201d His voice was meek, anxiety laced in every word. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be alone\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki pondered that. Would now be a good time? It might make the situation worse. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do anymore, all that mattered right now was getting Deku somewhere safe and far away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI-\u2026\u201d he pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Deku. Let me figure shit out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Th-thank you Kacchan\u2026\u201d the greenette mumbled, his words overshadowed by his sobs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt hurt to hear. He just wanted Deku to be safe. But the world was unkind to such a gentle soul. He truly did deserve better than what the world has given him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n------------\n\u00a0\nIzuku started packing up any belongings he needed into his big yellow bag, unsure of how long he\u2019d be staying at the hotel. He felt anxious, even anxious of Kacchan. He didn\u2019t know who he could trust but he needed to get out of his apartment NOW!\n\u00a0\nHis phone pinged, looking at the notification he put in the address and saw it was 40 minutes away. Hopefully enough distance from the stalker trying to get to him. With a sad sigh, Izuku grabbed his backpack and made his way outside to get into the taxi he had called earlier.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll he really wanted to do right now was eat and sleep but he couldn\u2019t even do that. Izuku tossed out the food in a nearby trash can outside then entered into the taxi waiting for him. He just wanted this night to be over.\n\u00a0\n------------\n\u00a0\nAfter 40 minutes and Izuku nearly falling asleep Izuku arrived at the hotel and holy cow was it nice! He felt under dressed to even be there! Nervously Izuku wandered in and walked up to the desk where a nicely dressed woman stood practically glaring daggers into him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cH-hello, I-I believe I have a reservation\u2026?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cName?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2026 D-Deku?\u201d Izuku stuttered out meekly, unsure what he should be doing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMmmm\u2026 yes here you are.\u201d The annoyed woman stated, then handed Izuku a key card. \u201cFloor 15, room 408.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d Izuku rasped, grabbing the key and making a beeline to the elevator.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPING\n\u00a0\n\nKACCHAN IS CALLING\u2026.\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku felt the familiar buzzing of his phone, pulling it out of his pocket, Deku answered the call.\n\u00a0\n\u201cK-Kacchan!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you make it to the hotel?\u201d He sounded like he was doing something, his voice was heavy and for some reason Kacchan kept making small grunts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes! I-I mean yeah, I did. It\u2019s super fancy\u2026 Kacchan you didn\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSafer there. They monitor anyone and everyone who comes in. That freak won\u2019t be able to get to you from your window either, since you\u2019re gonna be so high up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope so\u2026\u201d he paused, taking in a shaky breath. \u201cKacchan I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if he finds m-me a-and\u2026\u201d he couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence, his tears were already flowing from those gorgeous emeralds.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d Kacchan said, the confidence he brought through his voice warmed Izuku. Like he somehow knew for a fact he could actually protect Izuku. What a silly thought. But it helped some.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026 I believe you Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause, Kacchan not saying anything for a moment. Then he finally spoke, his voice stern but still trying to stay calm. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re safe. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cG-got it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku exited the elevator feeling a new confidence he didn\u2019t know he had. He had lit the match that started this fire, and he was going to watch it burn. A burning ember around him as he waited for the beast's next move. He wasn\u2019t going down without a fight. He\u2019d swallow the beast up in an inferno before he dared let it lay another finger on him again. He was a forest fire and he was going to burn.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki was a man out for blood. When he was first called in that night he had learned of Deku\u2019s real name, an Izuku Midoriya. For days he couldn\u2019t figure out what it was about the name that pulled at him until one evening his mother had called and he happened to ask if he ever knew a Midoriya growing up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMidoriya? Suppose you were too young to remember. My friend Inko lived down the street from us when you were a brat. She had a kid you used to play with up until they moved when you were\u2026 I think around 7 or so? You two would always cry anytime we had to take the other home.\u201d Mitsuki laughed, thinking back to the memories fondly. \u201cHe was such a shy and soft spoken kid, nothing like you.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe son, what was his name?\u201d Katsuki questioned, trying to recall said boy his mother was talking about.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, the boy? Izuku. So much like that mother of his. Very gentle and soft spoken, with this big green eyes. Last time I heard from Inko he was studying to become a nurse, I think. Such a sweet boy, didn\u2019t deserve what happened to him.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKatsuki\u2019s heart skipped a beat, staring down at his phone. \u201cWhat happened to him\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh it was awful, they ended up moving away because of his fathers work. Well next thing they knew the man had got into an accident only a few years later and tragically passed away, then Inko was diagnosed with leukemia not long after. From what I hear she works part time to make ends meet while her son goes to school and does other work to pay for things when he can. Just terrible\u2026 According to Inko it was hard enough to get him into any university due to him being quirkless, let alone a nursing school. Apparently they prefer taking on students with healing quirks instead. Just one bad thing after another for the Midoriya\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIs Mrs. Midoriya doing any better?\u201d Katsuki asked, his voice caught in his throat. Had Deku really gone through so much? Had the world really been so cruel to such a kind and soft soul?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLast I heard she was on the up and up but I haven\u2019t spoken to her in a few years now, so I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019d offer her number but it looks like the one I have doesn\u2019t work anymore. I hope they\u2019re okay, they were both such kind people. Wish I could get in contact with either just to know if they\u2019re okay.\u201d Mitsuki huffed. \u201cMaybe you can use those Pro Hero contacts to find your dear ol\u2019 mom, her university friend, eh brat? You and Izuchan can even catch up. Maybe his softness could rub off on you, make you less of a hellion.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath, hag.\u201d Katsuki spat, feeling the familiar venom in his tone.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFigures. I raise you and this is the thanks I get! Can\u2019t even come home for dinner anymore, ugh. Your poor father misses you.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEhhhh, maybe just a bit.\u201d Mitsuki hummed, the two paused before laughter erupted from the two blondes. \u201cLemme know when you can come visit though, I\u2019ll make your favorite.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Katsuki grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t get dead out there, mom.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSame to you, Katsuki.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t believe it. The two had known each other as children! It explained why he was so drawn to the man the first night he saw those beautiful emralds and why he couldn\u2019t get the other out of his mind. For years he had felt like something- no, \nsomeone\n was missing from his life, and he was right! And now that he had finally gotten them back he wasn\u2019t going to let them go again!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMina was still trying to figure out who exactly the stalker was, but she found a promising lead on a Mako Osamu. The man even matched the physical description that Deku had given the police once he had woken up, though sadly that wasn\u2019t enough to arrest the guy. Not yet anyways.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMina noted that once the stream shut off it looked like Osamu was on the move and going in the direction of the hotel that Katsuki had sent Deku to. He hoped that Deku could remain safe while there, but he had a sickening feeling that something bad was about to happen.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was an hour out from the hotel now, having taken his company's private jet to get there sooner but nothing felt fast enough.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeku\u2026 please be safe\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----------\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku sat in his hotel room unsure of what to do next. It had been nearly 20 minutes since Kacchan had replied to him and each minute he didn\u2019t hear from the other only increased his anxiety.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had tried calling but he didn\u2019t pick up for some reason, and Izuku was praying it wasn\u2019t something bad.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen came a knock at his door.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hadn\u2019t called for anyone? Unless\u2026 Could that be Kacchan? No there\u2019s no way. If he was on his way he\u2019d have told Izuku, right?\n\n\u00a0\n\nNervously Izuku stood and made his way to the door before looking out the peephole. There stood a man with raven hair and cat-like eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku\u2019s blood turned to ice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs quietly as he could, Izuku backed away from the door and pulled out his phone. He felt bile build up in his throat, and with trembling hands he began typing out his next message.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nDeku: Kacchan he\u2019s here!!\n\n\nDeku: KACCHAN!\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother knock came at the door, then that sickeningly sweet voice. \u201cOh Izuchan, I know you\u2019re in there. Or should I say Deku? You seem to prefer that name. Why not come out willingly? I won\u2019t even hurt you if you do, how\u2019s about that?\u201d The raven haired man cooed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku didn\u2019t dare make a noise, but he remembered this man's quirk. He used his voice similar to Control Freak, but he needed to say a specific line. So long as Izuku couldn\u2019t hear it then he\u2019d be fine, right?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThinking fast Izuku put in his ear buds just loud enough so the man's voice was muffled, hoping that would be all he needed to avoid being caught by his quirk a second time. He wasn\u2019t going to get caught again! He wasn\u2019t going down without a fight!\n\n\u00a0\n\nBANG BANG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIzuchaaaan~!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n---------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki stormed into the hotel, his eyes a burning inferno as he reached the hostess desk. \u201cMy room, where the fuck is it?!\u201d The blonde spat.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cN-name?\u201d The young hostess asked, a frail brunette with big doe eyes that reminded Katsuki so much of those endless emeralds he had grown to love.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKatsuki fucking Bakugou. Room number. \nNow.\n\u201d Katsuki snarled at the timid woman.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cF-floor 15, room 408, sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNabbing the keys, Katsuki stormed over to the elevator. He questioned booking it up the stairs but even 15 flights was a task for the pro-hero and he knew the elevator was faster. Even if he didn\u2019t like the idea.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPING\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki nearly threw his phone at the speed of which he went to grab it, going through his notifications in a frantic state.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nDeku: Kacchan he\u2019s here!!\n\n\nDeku: KACCHAN!\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of his head, a bead of sweat dripping from his brow. That fucker was here! That piece of shit!! Katsuki nearly blew a hole into the elevator button trying to get the stupid thing to go faster, anxiety pooling deep into his gut. This couldn\u2019t be happening! This shouldn\u2019t be happening! Originally he was just going to keep tabs on the room and make sure nobody came by, but the fucker actually decided to show!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWaiting exactly 2 seconds, Katsuki eventually just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and ran to the steps. He didn\u2019t care anymore if this was or wasn\u2019t a good idea, he didn\u2019t give a shit. He was going to protect Deku if it was the last damn thing he did!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\nKacchan: Don\u2019t leave your room!!\n\n\n\nKacchan: Just stay where you are!\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki bolted up all 15 flights of steps, his body running on pure adrenaline at this point. \u201cDeku please just be safe\u2026\u201d The blonde swore to himself, after 10 excruciating minutes he finally broke through the door of floor 15.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHis name is Mako Osamu.\u201d Mina begins, bringing up the man in question's report. \u201cHe\u2019s 27 years old, and has only ever had a few minor misdemeanor charges through the years but overall a clear record. Guy works as a software engineer and according to his co-workers he\u2019s a very quiet and well mannered man.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell mannered my ass. Dudes a freak with some quirkless fetish or some shit.\u201d Katsuki spat.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPossibly. We can\u2019t say for sure this is our guy though. But he matches the description Midoriya- er, Deku, gave to the police.\u201d Mina continued, staring back to the man's profile. \u201cHis quirk is the most interesting part of this though, and what actually caught my eye. It's similar to Shinsou\u2019s, where he can control his target. But unlike Shinsou he doesn\u2019t need the other to reply verbally, he just has to say a specific phrase for it to work. The target is also fully aware of what they\u2019re doing but can\u2019t stop it. Creepy...\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHearing this made Katsuki\u2019s skin crawl. Had Deku had to endure that? Had he been fully aware of what was happening but helpless to stop? Katsuki\u2019s blood began to boil. \u201cSo how do you stop it?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, since he\u2019s not a villain there\u2019s no documentation on that. Only criminals get that kind of stuff filed away, but if I had to guess, if you can\u2019t hear him then it just won\u2019t work. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be sending you off with these.\u201d Mina smirked, pulling out a pair of noise cancelling earbuds. \u201cI\u2019ll also be notifying the hotel just in case this is our man and a fight breaks out.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d Katsuki could feel a toothy smile creepy across his sharp features. \u201cI can beat this guy to a pulp.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n---------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe world became muffled around Izuku as he stared at the door before him. He could still make out the sound of the beast aggressively banging on it even through the music drumming in his ears. With a shaky breath Izuku surveyed his surroundings.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf I unplug the lamp then I'll have a heavy weapon I can hit the attacker with. I\u2019ll need to be fast though, the second he realizes I have headphones in he\u2019ll attempt to rip them out and force me to hear him. If I can manage to get behind him and hit the back of his neck hard enough it might just knock him out, but only if I manage to hit him in the right spot and hard enough. I don\u2019t have any actual weapons on me though, so this might be my best bet\u2026\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce he\u2019s knocked out I\u2019ll break for the door and get help, calling the police while i head for the elevator- no steps! I can run down a few flights before going to another level to hide. Elevator is too risky if he wakes up and I can\u2019t get in fast enough.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nJust breathe Izuku, you\u2019re gonna be fine.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Izuku mumbled aloud and got into action.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnplugging the lamp, Izuku moved to the closet near the door then closed the bathroom. With luck, the stalker will assume he\u2019s hiding in there and check there first and he\u2019ll be able to get a sneak attack from behind. It was a long shot, but it was all he had.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe greenette got into place, and waited, trying to calm his nerves that dared to bubble to the surface. Fear and panic had become a common feeling these past few weeks, but today he was going to face the beast that had caged him in his own mind and free himself along with. He didn\u2019t know where Kacchan had gone but he prayed he was okay. Maybe if he was lucky Kacchan had contacted the police again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBANG\n\n\u00a0\n\nBANG\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe beast was here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku covered his mouth with a shaky hand, trying to still his breathing scared the man before he heard. The greenette would feel hot tears trickling down his freckled cheeks, his entire body trembling within the closet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe could hear muffled words as the man walked through the hotel room, clearly searching for him. Carefully, and as quietly as Izuku could manage with music still blasting in his ears, he opened the door to peer out and see where the beast had gone once he couldn\u2019t hear any more sounds beyond the door. Right as he started to creek the door open it abruptly slammed open and there stood the beast before him. Those intense cat-like eyes peering down at him as he trembled. Fear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo. Not again!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku charged! Using the lamp as a weapon to hit the stalker's head, he seemed almost amused of his fight, casually moving out of the way before Izuku could land a hit. He was saying something but Izuku couldn't make it out between the music blasting and his own heart beat thumping in his ears. Again Izuku swung, but nearly tripped over his own feet to avoid a hand attempting to slam him into the wall.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rage the greenette felt coiled down into his belly slowly outweighed the overwhelming fear that sunk deep below his skin. A flaming inferno that threatened to erupt. This man clearly knew what he was doing and this wasn\u2019t the first time he had done this. He was a villain, and Izuku knew he wasn\u2019t going to be his last victim. No, far from it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBefore Izuku could think, a hand was shoved onto his face and his head met a wall with a heavy hit. Those awful sharp teeth smirking down at his trembling form. Izuku wasn\u2019t a trained fighter, no, far from it. He was a nurse in training, here to help save lives! He was smart and analytical no doubt, but nothing could compare to real combat experience. He was outmatched.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis muscles ached, the back of his head stung, and he could almost swear he felt blood starting to drip down to his neck. It was just like last time. He was helpless.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe beast removed his earphones, still eyeing him up and down with an amused smirk. \u201cWell, you tried, kitten. I\u2019ll give you that. But sadly you and I are just on different playing fiel-\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd then, an explosion.\n\n\nKatsuki stood in the doorway, watching as Deku\u2019s face was nearly crushed. Before Katsuki could even think, his hands were steaming and a burning hot explosion was sent through his palms and right at the attacker.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku\u2019s body slumped to the ground as he rushed to the smaller man's side and held him steady. He looked shaken and confused, his mind still trying to catch up to what he had witnessed. Those gorgeous viridian peered up into Katsuki\u2019s scarlette embers, a whirlwind of emotions flooded through Katsuki\u2019s entire being. An intense burning inferno lit between the two as they scanned the other's features, like a pull deep in their hearts had been yanked out and connected them finally. A piece to this puzzle that life dared hand them and all this time they had been desperately trying to put together but never knowing where the final piece lay.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was here.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe piece was found.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut before they could lemette on this strange feeling, there was another issue at hand. Katsuki quickly snatched Deku up and hid his form behind his body, glaring down at the man before him. \u201cStay behind me and put these in.\u201d Katsuki huffed, handing over the noise cancelling earbuds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe moment he spoke, Deku\u2019s eyes grew to saucer plates, Katsuki\u2019s deep raspy voice all too familiar to the other man by now. \u201cK-Ka-\u201d He began, though quickly cut off by Katsuki speaking again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Earbuds. Now.\u201d Katsuki hissed, turning his attention back to the man before him. \u201cSo, you got some freaky quirkless fetish, or you just prefer victims who can\u2019t fight back with a quirk?\u201d The blonde sneered, giving Osamu a feral grin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOsamu slowly roused from where he had been blasted, turning his eyes to face the hero before him. Most men would be terrified to see the number one hero facing him down, but Osamu wasn't like most men. He let out a breathy laugh, standing to his full height as his cat-like eyes stared daggers down at Katsuki. It all made sense now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTruth be told, Osamu was jealous. It started happening before he met Deku, you see. The attacks. He couldn\u2019t really help himself, every time he saw an adorable quirkless person he just needed to devour them. And sure he\u2019d gone too far, and even killed a few. But it was their fault for being so tempting to Osamu. He had never wanted to hurt them, really! But he got too rough with them and their cute little bodies.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he had found Deku\u2019s stream he thought he could get his fix but at a safe distance. He wouldn\u2019t need to hurt anyone else anymore and maybe even get the adorable greenette to notice him. That was until \u201cKacchan\u201d showed up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\n rolled into chat one day and dared to throw money around like it was nothing. Who gave him the right? Then the fucker kept showing up, giving more donations, getting closer and closer to \nhis\n Deku. Did he think he was better than everyone else? That he deserved Deku\u2019s time more? Osamu worked his ass off at his boring desk job, he did his best to obey the law, and the one good thing he had started to have going for himself was taken away by some-- some loud mouth pervert on the internet! Kacchan can pretend all he wants that he\u2019s just doing this to be nice but Osamu knew how people were.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo when he had figured out where Deku- or should he say, his little Izuchan lived, and he planned on making a visit. A romantic meet up at the gym! Like something out of one of a movie! They could meet up, fall in love, and forget stupid Kacchan in the past.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut it didn\u2019t go that way. No. Osamu was far too late and the bastard had already taken him.\n\n \u201cI- uh. Ahem. Oh crap is it really getting th-that late. S-sorry, but I really need to g-get going. M-my uh, b-boyfriend is gonna get worried.\u201d\n\n Those words echoed inside Osamu\u2019s head after their encounter. He was going to make sure Deku never forgot about him for as long as he lived.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe dared to hurt his heart like that, so Osamu would hurt his body in return. It\u2019s only fair, right? Osamu was a good man, and he could have been such a good boyfriend to Izuchan, but just like all the others they tossed him to the side! They deserved the pain!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith teeth like a wolf, snarled into a viscous grin Osamu peered down at the man before him. He knew that wild blonde hair and blood red eyes from anywhere. DynaMight. The number one pro hero in all of Japan, beloved and feared by many. The Symbol of Victory. And here he was, standing right in front of him, with eyes like an apocalypse.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, the slut managed to hook the Number One hero. Izuchan, why don\u2019t we just start over? Your beloved DynaMight is gonna leave you the second he finds another piece of ass to replace you. Come with me! No one else will ever love you like me!! He doesn\u2019t love you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku was shaking like a leaf, his eyes wide and full of tears as he clung to Katsuki for dear life. Before Osamu could get another word out he put in the earbuds and accepted his fate into total quietness, just murmurs of the world around him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe didn\u2019t even know what this man was trying to say. Love him? This wasn\u2019t love! He had broken his legs, his arm! He had scars now from the assault and regular panic attacks every night! None of that was love, that was abuse! He might not know much about romance, but he wasn\u2019t stupid, and he sure as hell knew better than whatever this psychopath was trying to sell him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSteam began to rise off of Katsuki\u2019s palms again, a deep animalistic growl vibrating through his entire being. This was no longer a civilian, this was a full fledged villain. The Quirkless Killer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had nearly gotten Deku a second time, but Katsuki was gonna make sure there wouldn\u2019t be a third chance. Not now and not ever. In the time he had met Deku he had slowly begun to realize he fell for the boy with stars in his evergreen eyes and galaxies across his skin. Truly, it was the very night they met that his very heart was ripped from his chest that this gentle man now held. And in that time, Katsuki had learned not to hold onto the fear of this man\u2019s gentle hands holding it like it was the most precious thing on Earth. He knew Deku would keep it safe, and cherish it always.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was that night that he darted light the match of their feelings, watching as the embers burned around them. He was terrified of this roaring flame that had begun to spread around them, a Hellfire that wouldn\u2019t dare go down. And Katsuki was happy to watch it burn ablaze.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe would fan this flame with his dying breath, letting it spread around them until nothing was left. This warm afterglow of heat that he dared call their romance wasn\u2019t going to simply end, and not by some creep who tried to stand between them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki prepared himself, rearing back as Osamu ran at him, drawing a sharp blade from his back pocket. It was frustrating not being able to hear the world around them, even more so that he couldn\u2019t comfort the man behind him with soothing words, but that would need to wait.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a harsh step to the right, Katsuki managed to block Izuku\u2019s body from the attack as well as grab ahold of Osamu\u2019s arm to force it into an uncomfortable angle and force him to drop the blade. Katsuki however, underestimated his opponent and the raven haired man grabbed the blade with his other hand, quickly getting a low blow on Katsuki\u2019s thigh. Hissing in pain, Katsuki brought his leg up to knee Osamu in the ribs, only to be met with another sharp stab, this time in the side. Near the liver. Shit.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki let off an explosion near the man's ears, loud enough to deafen him and char the skin around. Izuku was practically pinned against the wall behind the blonde as the two continued their battle, his mind a racing thunder.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe knife was twisted deep into the blonde's body, an ear piercing scream escaping his lips as he attempted to escape. The pain surged up through his spine, making him feel woozy.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis was bad.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nOsamu\u2019s movement\u2019s halted, looking into those gorgeous evergreens from behind the explosive man before him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. Please just\u2026 just stop hurting him!\u201d Izuku wept, his eyes lined with red from all the tears he couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything you want, okay?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOsamu ripped the knife from Katsuki\u2019s bleeding form, letting it drop to the ground with a clatter. He looked absolutely ecstatic to hear those words, like he had been waiting for years to finally hear them. \u201cMy Izuchan~! Of course! I\u2019m going to make you so happy, I promise.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nShoving Katsuki\u2019s form to the side with a force like a truck, Osamu made his way over to Izuku with a feral cheshire grin. With none of the intensity and fury that Izuku had just seen, Osamu gently ran his fingers along Izuku\u2019s freckled cheeks and took in the sight before him. Warm blood smeared over Izuku, making his skin crawl, but he didn\u2019t dare show it. However he instead opted for a nervous smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki held onto his side, groaning in agony as he looked back up at the two men. This couldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cD-Deku\u2026 no\u2026\u201d Katsuki rasped out. His vision was slowly going dark as he bled out, feeling his warmth gush over his shaking hands. He came here to save Deku, not watch him be taken away!\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku gave Katsuki a sad look, his eyes an endless ocean of emotions that Katsuki couldn\u2019t yet decipher. He didn\u2019t want this to be the last time he saw those gorgeous star-like eyes, he didn\u2019t want this to be the last time he heard the man\u2019s angelic voice that made warmth pool in his gut. This just couldn\u2019t be it!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019ll be al-alright.\u201d Izuku managed, though he wasn\u2019t sure if Katsuki could even hear him at this point. Izuku allowed the larger man to slowly lead him out, a firm hold placed around the back of his neck as the two excited the hotel room. The air was thick with anxiety around them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter all, Heroes do what they must even if it costs them their life.\n\n Izuku thought to himself. \n\nAnd I want to be a hero.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI am here, Kacchan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNow, be a dea-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nQuick as a thunderstrike, Izuku pulled out a knife he had hid in his hoodie pocket he snagged off of Katsuki\u2019s belt and plunged it straight into Osamu\u2019s side, forcing the blade as deep as he possibly could. Thinking on his feet, Izuku shoved the taller man down to the floor, slamming his head down hard. He wasn\u2019t a fighter, no, but he wasn\u2019t useless either!\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku plunged the knife deep into Osamu\u2019s right arm between the shoulder and connective tissue. He made quick work of tearing apart the muscle fibers and damaging the area around, having noted that he was right handed and seemed to always go in with a strong right hook, similar to DynaMight but that\u2019s where the similarities end.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou will not hurt me or anyone else again!\u201d Izuku shouted, his voice a deep smoke that seethed from his lips. With a hard hit, Izuku smacked Osamu's face. Rage and fire coiling deep below his skin like a thunderstorm of emotions he had never felt before.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOsamu didn\u2019t even have the chance to fight back, his consciousness drifting by the final strike. Pain pooling deep into his being.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-holy shit\u2026\u201d came a horse rasp from beside Izuku, looking over to meet those deep scarlett rubies he could never get out of his mind.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Izuku wept, clambering off of the raven haired man and scooping up Katsuki into his trembling arms. \u201cKacchan are you okay!?\u201d Izuku cried, burying his face into his wild ashen locks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cH-hey there freckles.\u201d Katsuki hummed, looking up at Izuku like he was the sun itself. Blinding, beautiful, and all encompassing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cK-Kacchan we need to get y-you to the hospital! We need to-\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHelp is on its way, don\u2019t worry. Hhnng, fuck. Got me pretty good though.\u201d Katsuki let out a low rumble of a laugh, feeling his vision get spottier by the second.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku looked stunning, the lights above like a halo around him as his gorgeous ocean eyes continued to weeb. His skin a constellation of freckles, small worried lines etched into his brow and under his eyes. His face told a deep and beautiful story that Katsuki wanted to hear about time and time again, listening to those angelic words woft into his ears.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like an angel.\u201d Katsuki hummed, before feeling his consciousness finally go.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKacchan\u2026? Kacchan!?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n----------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nSlowly, Katsuki opened his eyes to the sound of machinery around him and a throbbing pain in his side. Beautiful viridian captured his gaze as Katsuki looked down to see the sleeping form of none other than Izuku Midoriya next to him. His mass of curls a mess from being half squished into the hospital bed, uncomfortably leaning his head only a few inches from Katsuki\u2019s lap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSlowly and cautiously Katsuki ran a callused hand through Deku\u2019s fluffy curls, feeling the soft hairs. He really did look like an angel like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku\u2019s long lashes started to fluffer, those gorgeous emeralds meeting his own rubies. Katsuki felt warmth coil in his gut and butterflies try to escape out through his throat. Suddenly his mouth felt very very dry, and he couldn\u2019t even think of what to say. The two stared at each other like they were the first person they\u2019d ever seen in their entire life.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cK-Kacchan? Or, uh- should I say DynaMight? Y-you are Kacchan right? Or am I just being dumb, oh god I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t even ask if you\u2019re feeling okay! I\u2019m sorry-\u201d Deku fumbled over his words, his arms starting to flail as he spoke.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Katsuki cut in, his cheeks feeling warm at hearing his nickname in person. He was too cute for his own damn good.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHoly crap, so-\u201d Deku took in a shaky breath, finally rising to sit up to his full height. \u201cSo y-you\u2019re actually DynaMight? Why didn\u2019t you say anything\u2026? I guess you couldn\u2019t huh?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSheepishly, Katsuki looked away, feeling guilt eat away at him. \u201cI wanted to, believe me. But I worried it might freak you out, or hell, put you in danger. Then the longer I waited I just- fuck. I started thinking and worrying more. Worried you\u2019d get mad I lied or some shit. Didn\u2019t wanna lose- y\u2019know. This.\u201d Katsuki averted his gaze, his hand motioning between the two. \u201cWhatever \n\nthis \n\nis.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku stared at him, his expansive forested eyes scanning Katsuki\u2019s entire face. Then, something strange happened. He laughed. The softest, most adorable laugh that Katsuki had heard fluttered out of Deku. \u201cYou were scared I\u2019d be MAD? At you!? Kacchan, you\u2019re the last person I could ever get mad at. And let alone because you had to hide your identity from me. I\u2019m just\u2026 Wow. I\u2019ve been friends with DynaMight for months now! And you\u2019ve had to sit through me gushing over well, you!\u201d Deku snorted a laugh, his cheeks turning a brilliant red. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t even feel real, holy crap.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Katsuki waved off, feeling his own face start to burn. \u201cGo ahead an\u2019 fanboy ya damn nerd. It's not like I choose to tune in multiple times a week to hear your nerdass word vomit about how amazing I am \u2018n shit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku let out another laugh, this time warm and bubbly. Nothing like those awful nervous ones he had to listen to earlier. These were kind and soft, they tickled Katsuki\u2019s ears in a way that no other sound could compare. \u201cI just, wow. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeku gave a soft, shy smile. Eyeing Katsuki as he bit his lip. Man had no right being so gorgeous, it was sinful.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIzuku Midoriya.\u201d Finally came from Deku, nn outstretched hand near Katsuki\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s um, that\u2019s my name.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki eyed at the hand before him, before giving a smug smile and clasping it into his own, noting just how much smaller it felt in his own massive one. \u201cKatsuki Bakugou.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's a pleasure to finally meet you, Katsuki.\u201d Deku beamed.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust stick to Kacchan, I like it better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cO-okay.\u201d Deku gave a soft smile, his cheeks turning a deeper shade of burgundy. \u201cKacchan.\u201d\n\n\nIt had been a few days now since Katsuki\u2019s release from the hospital and he had been kept painfully busy filling out paperwork on the case as well as preparing for an interview as the person who \u201ccaught the Quirkless Killer\u201d though in reality he knew it was he and Deku who did it together, but his publicist said it was safer if he simply said he was the only one. Keeps Deku out of the news so he doesn\u2019t get more stalkers and helps Katsuki\u2019s own reputation, though he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it wasn\u2019t his win to own, even if Deku said it was fine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt felt like poetic justice having the Quirkless Killer be taken down by none other than a Quirkless person, however.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKacchan it\u2019s fine, really.\u201d Deku laughed on the other end of the line. \u201cIt\u2019s better for your reputation anyways. I\u2019m not some vigilante, I\u2019m a nurse in training.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah but- ugh! Didn\u2019t you want to be a hero? This could be a good thing for Quirkless people.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHmmm, maybe. At this point I\u2019m just glad the guy is off the streets and far away from anyone that could get hurt by him.\u201d Deku hummed into the phone. \u201cDid they ever find out what his deal was?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHis deal?\u201d Katuski huffed, entering his apartment and sitting down his groceries.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, like, his motive and stuff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, guy was just a freak. Had a fetish for Quirkless people or some shit, and kept hurting them. Said they deserved it or some creepy shit. He found your stream and I guess that made him stop for awhile until-\u201c Katsuki paused. Should he tell Deku this?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUntil what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh, until I joined. I guess you giving me extra attention started to drive him over the edge. So, In some fucked up way I kinda caused this. Fuck\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat!? Kacchan you didn\u2019t cause this! It was entirely his fault not yours!\u201d Deku rasped, his voice cracking slightly as he yelled. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known this would have happened!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah well, I still feel bad. I was just trying to impress you or something I guess.\u201d Before Katsuki could stop the words they had already left his mouth and his cheeks were burning. \n\nGoddamnit Katsuki!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-Impress me?\u201d Deku gasped. \u201cWh-why would you want to do that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki looked up at the ceiling mouthing the word \n\nfuck\n\n, unsure of what to say next. He wasn\u2019t exactly known for his dishonesty but he also wasn\u2019t known for being the most emotionally open person either.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEating his own ego for once in his life, Katsuki finally spoke. \u201cThought you were pretty.\u201d His ears felt like they were on fire, hell if he didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d think steam was coming out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cP-pretty? Me? I\u2019m not a girl, Kacchan.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah no shit Sherlock. Men can be pretty. You\u2019ve called \nme\n pretty before.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh fuck-CRAP! No! Ugh!!!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki couldn\u2019t help but laugh at that. \u201cIzuku Midoriya! Was that a swear? My, what would your mother think!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShut up, your swearing has rubbed off on me!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMe? Swearing? I don\u2019t know what you mean! I\u2019m an Angel! I never swear and I am always very very polite.\u201d Katsuki coos, sarcasm dripping from his tone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHardy harr harr.\u201d Deku huffs, but a smile clearly on his lips. \u201cBut, you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAbout?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou are very pretty.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki almost felt dizzy at those words. He\u2019d been told he was handsome, pretty, hot, just about everything under the sun by fans all around the world. But something about Izuku Midoriya, something about the words he spoke sent electricity through his spine and lit up his world like nothing else could. It was addictive just how this man made him feel. He wanted to kiss bruises into his gorgeous freckled skin, hold him in his strong arms and never let him go. Always keep him safe from a world that dare damage someone so soft and gentle.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Deku. Come by my place tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was a sharp intake of breath followed by a long pause. Then, the softest tone that Katsuki had ever heard in his entire life. \u201cO-okay.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n-------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku stood outside of the Number One Heroes apartment complex, his head was still reeling. Was he really here? Was this really happening? The nearly 3 hour train ride felt like a fever dream, and Kacchan texting him every few minutes to make sure he was okay, the man clearly still a nervous wreck from what happened to them both. Izuku still didn\u2019t feel fully safe in his home and would jump at the slightest of sounds, so being around Kacchan sounded like a blessing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut in the same breath, a horrible curse. Kacchan wasn\u2019t just anyone, but friggin DynaMight! His celebrity crush! And that\u2019s what he thought it would remain, a celebrity crush! Now he was about to be face to face with the gorgeous man again and Izuku didn\u2019t even know if his heart could handle it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTentatively Izuku clicked the buzzer, waiting for the blonde to answer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-Its uh, me. Izuk-er, Deku.\u201d Izuku huffed out a laugh, running a scarred hand through his unruly curls.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was silence, and eventually followed by a loud buzzing sound, the doors to the complex opened. Nervously Izuku entered, making his way to the room number that Kacchan had texted him prior. Before he could even knock the door swung open, causing a small yelp to escape from the greenette and making him stagger back against the wall. There before him stood Dynamight. He really was pretty, and tall, all muscle with a broad chest. His eyes were a beautiful deep burgundy, framed by short pale eyelashes. Izuku\u2019s heart was stuck in his throat, his hands starting to sweat as his thoughts tried to catch up with him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou gonna just stand there? Or you comin\u2019 in?\u201d Kacchan finally spoke, moving to the side to allow Izuku to enter.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cO-oh right! Sorry!\u201d Izuku blushed, making his way past Kacchan and into the man\u2019s apartment.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was huge, it made Izuku\u2019s apartment look like nothing more than a shoebox in comparison. It was extremely modern, with a simplistic look to it. Kacchan never seemed like the sort to like clutter anyways so it made sense.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLeaning down, Izuku started taking off his red hightops, feeling Kacchan\u2019s eyes leer on him. It was amazing being around the man after so long, but also terrifying. What was he suppose to say?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAhem, um. D\u2019you want any tea or coffee? Or water\u2026?\u201d Did Kacchan seem nervous? That was strange.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cO-oh uh, maybe some tea. Tea would be nice, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a grunt Kacchan set about making two cups of black tea, constantly having to dry his own hands due to nervous sweating. Couldn\u2019t exactly hand over a cup of tea covered in nitroglycerin.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cD\u2019you like milk or sugar with it?\u201d Kacchan hollered from over his shoulder as Izuku made his way into the kitchen. It was, just like the rest of the house, beautiful.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nGorgeous marble countertops adorned with miscellaneous items, a dark wooden cutting board sat utop the counter as well as a knife block. Izuku had recalled Kacchan was a good cook, and was curious how his cooking tasted. Perhaps he could ask some time? Would that be weird?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNerd, you\u2019re mumbling. Sugar and milk, yes or no?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku\u2019s face flushed a brilliant bright red, his hands clasping over his mouth. \u201cS-sorry! Yeah, sugar and milk please.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was a beat of silence between the two before Kacchan spoke again, \u201cAnd yeah, I can cook you something. If you want...\u201d A clear deep red spreading across the blonde\u2019s ears. Izuku couldn\u2019t help but think it made him look cute.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter the tea had been made, the two made their way into the living room and sat on Kacchan\u2019s couch. A deep black leather, Izuku didn\u2019t know much about interior design but everything looked expensive. Holding the warm cup up to his lips, the freckled man couldn\u2019t help but notice the eyes scraping up and down his form. Katsuki\u2019s eyes were deep and intense, reminding him of burning magma beneath the surface that Izuku didn\u2019t know what to do with.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cS-so, why did you invite me over?\u201d Izuku finally spoke, taking a sip of the tea. It was delicious, though he wasn\u2019t sure what the brand was. A delighted noise lept from Izuku\u2019s soft pink lips as he took another rip.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh, well.\u201d Again, that nervousness that Izuku wasn\u2019t used to seeing. \u201cFigured it was better to ask this in person, then over the phone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAsk what?\u201d \n\nWhat on earth couldn\u2019t be asked over the phone? Was it more about the case?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nKacchan slowly sat down his drink, his face a deep burgundy similar to his eyes. \u201cDek- ahem. Izuku.\u201d Hearing his first name from Kacchan\u2019s deep gravelly voice was like electricity being shot through his system. A spark that trickled down his spine and met low and warm in his gut..\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next sentence out of Katsuki\u2019s mouth, Izuku could never have predicted, let alone fathomed. \u201cD\u2019you wanna, maybe\u2026 Date?\u201d A titlewave of emotions was sent flooring through Izuku like a punch to the gut.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHad he heard that right? DynaMight, THE DynaMight wanted to date him?! Number One Pro Hero in all of Japan, rated Japan\u2019s sexiest man alive, and the man that had saved his life twice?! He wanted to date him?!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou mumble like this all the fuckin\u2019 time, nerd?\u201d Kacchan spoke, his eyes focused and intent upon Izuku.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cS-sorry! I just\u2026 wow. You want to date me!? Me!? Did I hear that right?\u201d Izuku blabbered, feeling hot tears form in his brilliant evergreens.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone but you, Izuku.\u201d Kacchan said plainly, as though it was a fact as simple as the sky being blue or the sun a star.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEmeralds met rubies, forest meeting fire. A dance these two had been a part of since the day they met, each step in sync to the orchestra of their life. A song only the two of them could hear but they moved to like they had known it since the day they were born. Pulling and tugging them closer and closer. The string of fate tangling them, intertwining their very souls. Unable to escape the other in this life or any other.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0A thoughtful silence between the two, the air growing thick around them. Izuku swallowed his words, trying to think of what to say next. \u201cA-are you sure?\u201d He rasped out as though the air was ripped from his lungs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHave been since the day we met.\u201d Katsuki hummed, closing the distance. A large calloused hand running its way along Izuku\u2019s cheek. \u201cSince I saw those star-like eyes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku\u2019s face felt like it was aflame, he couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Had Katsuki really felt this way all those months ago? Was this even real!?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, what d\u2019you say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe only person I want is you, Kacchan.\u201d Izuku smiled softly up at the other, leaning into Katsuki\u2019s space even more.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m yours.\u201d Katsuki hums, their lips finally meeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt felt like lightning, an explosion that punched Izuku right in the gut. Pure electricity through his veins as that gorgeous hot mouth opened up for him. Izuku wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing, but Katsuki was quick to take the lead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir bodies intertwined as Katsuki pulled Izuku lithe form firmly onto his lap to take in more of him. He was like a livewire, a beautiful dancing flame that Izuku wished to hold and cherish for the rest of his life and into every next one.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTheir bodies melted together, the puzzle finally completed after this entire time. Perfectly completing the other in this fantastical dance they had started unbeknownst to them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA simmering flame that never could go out so long as their souls remained entangled together.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlways- ah, always and forever, Kacchan.\u201d Izuku groaned, allowing Katsuki to trail gentle kisses down his neck. \u201cAlways yours.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you, Izuku. \n\nFuck.\n\n\u201d Katsuki mumbled, burying his head deep into Izuku\u2019s shoulder. Holding him tightly, like if he dared let go the other might drift away and be lost forever. \u201cI\u2019m so unfathomably in love with you, and it's not even funny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love you too, Kacchan.\u201d Izuku hums, pulling Katsuki\u2019s face up until they were at eye level. \u201cI love you to the moon and beyond. For the first time in my life I feel happy. Truly and deeply happy, and it's all because of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki stared into those deep star-like emeralds, an evergreen forest deep with emotions. A past that Katsuki wished to know so much more about, a history he could only ever dream of knowing. He would kiss away all the hurt life had caused him, he would keep this man safe with his very dying breath.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe had lost Izuku all those years ago, but never again. He was here, before him. Fate had given him a second chance and he was never going to let this man go.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was home, and home was the most gorgeous shade of green Katsuki had ever seen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n"
