    "text": "The very last thing that Peter expected to find when he got home was Aunt May sitting on the couch, serving a cup of tea to Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier himself.\n\u201cUh,\u201d Peter said, looking around to make sure there weren\u2019t any other former assassins hanging around. \u201cHi?\u201d\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Aunt May flashed him a thousand-watt smile. \u201cWe have a visitor! Have you met Mr. Barnes yet?\u201d\n\u201cUm, no, no I haven\u2019t,\u201d Peter said, nearly tripping over his own bookbag in his hurry to get to the living room. \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\nBucky Barnes sat there calmly sipping his cup of tea, though he did look somewhat amused by Peter\u2019s outburst. \u201cJust thought we ought to meet.\u201d\nPeter realized a few things in quick succession: that he had left the Winter Soldier webbed to the ground in a German airport, that Bucky was Captain America\u2019s best friend, and that, given that he was in school clothes and had no web shooters on him at all, he was currently hopelessly outclassed by a century-old assassin with a freakin\u2019 metal arm.\n\u201cHi, nice to meet you, please don\u2019t kill me,\u201d Peter said in a rushed jumble of words.\n\u201cLighten up, kiddo,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cI don\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\nMay smiled at Peter, as though that statement hadn\u2019t been horribly unsettling. \u201cPeter, is that how we treat guests?\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Peter said. \u201cSorry?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Bucky said. He turned to Aunt May. \u201cI\u2019d be nervous if I was him, too. He has been calling out my good buddy Steve on the internet.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to him about how we should treat our elders,\u201d Aunt May said.\nPeter couldn\u2019t even honestly say, \u201cHe started it.\u201d He was defenseless. His hands pinwheeled at his sides, seemingly of their own accord, and he made a few uncertain, half-hearted syllables that did not add up to any actual words.\nThe Winter Soldier was definitely seconds away from laughing at him. \n\u201cHe deserved it,\u201d Peter muttered. \nThe Winter Soldier laughed at him.\nPeter wondered if he could just leave the apartment, come back, and try this again. \n\u201cYou might find this hard to believe,\u201d Bucky said once he\u2019d stopped laughing, \u201cbut I\u2019m not here to make your life miserable.\u201d\n\u201cI find that very hard to believe,\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve been publicly trashing your best friend, dude.\u201d\n\u201cYou got a best friend?\u201d Bucky said. He set his teacup down. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, wondering where this was going.\n\u201cMe and Stevie, we\u2019ve been close for a real long time,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cAnd this is the first real opportunity I\u2019ve had since the war to give him some payback for all the grey hairs he\u2019s given me.\u201d\nAunt May looked like she wanted to argue against the existence of any hypothetical non-perfect hairs on Bucky Barnes\u2019 head, but she kept her peace.\nPeter thought he wouldn\u2019t do something like that to Ned, but Bucky-- something about Bucky reminded him obscurely of MJ, and MJ would throw him under the bus without hesitation if an opportunity like this arose. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d Peter said finally.\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re interested in some dirt,\u201d Bucky said. He looked at Peter expectantly.\n\u201cAre you offering some?\u201d Peter said, perking up, because if anyone had the embarrassing deets on Captain America, it would be someone who\u2019d known him since the Depression. \u201cBecause I am all ears, my man.\u201d\nThirty minutes later, a video of Bucky Barnes cheerfully telling the world about the time a young Steve Rogers puked on a nun after eating too many caramel creams appeared on Peter\u2019s secret Instagram.\nIt had made the news cycles less than an hour later; Peter couldn\u2019t have asked for a better gift.\n*\nTony called three hours later. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t hunt down Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cHe showed up here,\u201d Peter said, choosing discretion over valor and tactfully did not mention the fact that Bucky and Tony had pretty much pulled the same recruitment move. It wouldn\u2019t go over well.\nTony sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s scary,\u201d Peter agreed, \u201cbut he wants to help me win against Captain America. Who better than someone who knows all the dirt?\u201d\n\u201cThat he does,\u201d Tony said. \u201cListen. I\u2019m never going to like the guy, but I\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s at least safe to be around these days. I would tell you to stay away otherwise, capiche?\u201d \n\u201cCapiche,\u201d Peter said awkwardly. He knew why Tony would never like Bucky, and he felt a little disloyal bringing the dude in on his team, but this was war and Tony definitely understood. \n\u201cAnd never trust him,\u201d Tony added. \n\u201cOkey dokey,\u201d Peter said, immediately regretting it and hanging up before Tony could do more than laugh at him. \n*\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned said that night, grabbing a slice of pizza and folding it before taking a huge bite. \u201cI almost fell out of my freakin\u2019 chair when I saw the Winter Soldier on your Insta.\u201d\n\u201cI came home and he was here, just hanging out with Aunt May,\u201d Peter said, gesturing with his own slice. MJ flinched slightly away, which was totally unfair, because Peter was a superhero, he had total control over his pizza.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ned said. \u201cIs this going to become a thing? First Tony Stark, now the Winter Soldier. What if Thor is next? Dude. Promise to call me if Thor is ever on your couch, okay? I have to witness that in person.\u201d\nIf Peter ever came home to find Thor on his couch, Ned wouldn\u2019t be getting a phone call, because Peter would die on the spot. He didn\u2019t say so in front of MJ, though. The less ammunition she had, the better it was for everyone.\n\u201cMy question is,\u201d MJ said, gesturing with her straw before sticking it into her drink, \u201cwhy the hell would you trust Captain America\u2019s best friend to help us?\u201d\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d Peter said, \u201cit\u2019s because he reminded me of you and that\u2019s absolutely what you would do to us?\u201d\nNed nodded in agreement.\nMJ said, \u201cWell. I mean, you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d\n\u201cSo the real question is, what do we do with him?\u201d Ned asked. \u201cBecause right now, it looks like we\u2019re kicking Cap\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d MJ said. \u201cToo much, and we\u2019re just going to look like dicks. And by we, I mean you.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe we already won,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI mean, the smart thing for him to do would be to just drop it here.\u201d \n\u201cSounds unlikely,\u201d Ned said. \n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m with the sidekick on this one,\u201d MJ said, reaching for another slice of pizza. \nNed snagged it before she got there. \u201cI am not the sidekick. I am the guy in the chair. It\u2019s a totally different and more awesome thing.\u201d\nMJ narrowed her eyes, glaring at the pizza in Ned\u2019s hand. \u201cKeep telling yourself that, Robin.\u201d\n\u201cRobin\u2019s actually really cool,\u201d Peter said loyally. \u201cAnd if anything, Ned would be Oracle, and she kicks ass.\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah she does,\u201d Ned agreed. MJ rolled her eyes and took a piece of pizza, even though she was clearly thinking it inferior to the one she lost.\n\u201cWhere is your aunt?\u201d Ned asked after a moment, looking around. \u201cDid she run away with Bucky Barnes?\u201d\n\u201cShe would have,\u201d Peter said, crinkling his nose. \u201cShe\u2019s in her room, pretending to work but really she\u2019s looking at pictures of Bucky Barnes on the internet. She\u2019s got a crush.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d MJ wondered aloud.\n*\nPeter\u2019s life goes suspiciously well for the next few days. He remembered to do all of his homework, Flash was distracted by MJ\u2019s academic decathalon reading schedule, he caught a pair of goons trying to rob a liquor store and Bucky sent him a short video of Captain America picking a wedgie, which instantly became the most popular gif on the internet.\nThen, that evening while on patrol, Karen announced that there was an incoming call from the Scarlet Witch.\nPeter hadn\u2019t actually had any interaction with her since the first time they\u2019d met, when he\u2019d failed to say it and instead sprayed it ft. cheese balls, but Karen accepted the call before Peter could do anything more than internally shriek about it for a moment.\n\u201cI am following a lead in Queens,\u201d she said as soon as Peter offered up a greeting. \u201cWould you like to join me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Peter said without hesitation. Superhero team-ups were the stuff of dreams. You didn\u2019t turn down a superhero team-up. \n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and told him where to meet her.\nPeter crouched down on the edge of the roof he was on and had Karen call Ned. \u201cNed, Ned, you\u2019ll never believe it. I\u2019m on my way to team up with the Scarlet Witch!\u201d\nPeter assumed the silence on the other end was stunned. \n\u201cThis is the best week ever,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2026 I mean, Peter my dude. Isn\u2019t it a little suspicious that she\u2019s calling you up out of the blue?\u201d Ned said slowly.\n\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Peter said. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin this for me, Neddy. I need a win.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ned said reluctantly. \u201cBut just stay on your toes, okay?\u201d\nPeter rolled his eyes and hung up. Scarlet Witch wasn\u2019t going to be on Team Cap. She\u2019d been cool with him the single time they\u2019d met. Karen had given her the virtual thumbs up! It was going to be fine.\nWanda was waiting for him outside a storage facility. \u201cWe got intel that a Hydra cell has been coming and going from here.\u201d\n\u201cCool!\u201d Peter said. He\u2019d never fought Hydra before. \nWanda nodded. \u201cCould you climb up and open that window? I don\u2019t want to cause any more property damage.\u201d\n\u201cProbably a good idea,\u201d Peter tactfully agreed, and scurried up the wall. Just before he got to the window Wanda had pointed to, he stopped.\nHis hands were stuck. He tried to pull his hand back to find a new grip, but it held tight. His hands were definitely stuck to the wall. When he moved his feet slightly up to try to get more leverage to pull himself off, they stuck too.\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d he muttered to himself, pulling a little harder. Nothing happened. He was stuck to the wall. \u201cKaren, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d\n\u201cThere is a substance on the wall,\u201d Karen said helpfully. \u201cA type of super-glue that adheres on contact.\u201d\n\u201cGlue.\u201d Peter stopped himself from resting his forehead on the wall just in time. \u201cI\u2019m glued to the wall?\u201d He turned as much as he could and yelled over his shoulder, \u201cHey, Scarlet Witch, did you glue me to the freaking wall?\u201d\nShe was standing in a different spot now, presumably one with better light as she was aiming her phone up at him and smiling.\n\u201cThis is\u2026 Oh my god,\u201d Peter yelled down at her. \u201cSeriously uncool! I can\u2019t believe you turned a building into a giant fly-strip!\u201d\nAfter a few more minutes of filming, a car pulled up and Natasha climbed out, smiling up at him. By that time Peter had managed to get one of his knees stuck, too, and felt more like a human pretzel than anything else. \n\u201cHave fun getting loose!\u201d Natasha called as she got back into her car. \n\u201cDo you have any idea how hard it is to get orange cheese goo out of clothes?\u201d Wanda called up before climbing in with Natasha. \u201cYou deserve this!\u201d\nThey drove off remorselessly.\n\u201cKaren,\u201d Peter said glumly. \u201cCall Ned, please.\u201d\nThere was absolutely no way he was letting Tony know about this disaster.\n\u201cI finished the AT-AT!\u201d Ned crowed triumphantly when he answered. \u201cPeter, you have the best timing, this is the most triumphant moment of my life.\u201d\nPeter sighed. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he said.\nNed cheered again. \u201cDamn right I am! What was I right about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d Peter said in his best Ackbar voice. \nTo his credit, Ned didn\u2019t laugh out loud at Peter. He just asked in a very careful voice what happened.\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck to the side of a building,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThere are a few people down there taking pictures of me? This is a nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be stuck? You already stick to buildings,\u201d Ned pointed out.\n\u201cThey coated it with glue, Ned,\u201d Peter said. He took a deep breath. \u201cHow the hell am I going to get down?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like my suggestion,\u201d Ned warned.\n\u201cLay it on me,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019m desperate here. I need to pee.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ned said. \u201cAre you glued to the wall, or is your suit glued to the wall?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t like this suggestion,\u201d Peter said. It would have been fine had there not been a captive audience who were probably livestreaming him right now. He took a deep breath. \u201cKaren, are there any other options? Like, is this glue soluble?\u201d\n\u201cInitial scans indicate that the adhesive is a Stark Industries prototype,\u201d Karen announced. \u201cSo no.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Peter said. \u201cNed, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\n\u201cJust remember, you\u2019ve got abs now,\u201d Ned said seriously. \u201dOwn it.\u201d\nPeter took a deep breath and had Karen scan to see how far the glue was spread. Once he freed himself from his suit, he should be able to leap to a clean section of wall and get out of here as quickly as possible.\nThe only real problem was that both hands were glued to the wall so he couldn\u2019t reach the spider emblem, but he asked Karen nicely and she released it for him. The mask remained, thankfully, so he was able to escape without revealing his identity, only his body.\nIt was incredibly difficult to extricate himself from his spidey-suit without accidentally touching the wall, but finally Peter just kind of flung himself backward and hoped for the best as he aimed himself towards a clean section of wall. He managed to grab hold of a windowsill and scurried up the wall towards the roof, extremely conscious of the hoots and whistles from the crowd below.\nOnce he reached the roof, he peered over the side, watching his suit wave limply in the breeze. \n\u201cTony is gonna kill me,\u201d he said before fleeing the scene in just his boxers and mask.\n*\nGetting back home while lacking in all of his clothes was definitely a challenge. Now that Aunt May knew, he got into his spidey-suit in his bedroom instead of random alleyways, which in turn meant that all his clothes were still safely in his bedroom. \nJust when he needed clothes in random alleyways. Great.\n\u201cKaren,\u201d he said into the mask, hoping it would still work. \u201cCall Ned back, please.\u201d\nPeter huddled behind a dumpster in an alley for twenty minutes before Ned showed up with a t-shirt and some shoes. Peter finally pulled off his mask, which Ned shoved into his pocket, and pulled on the clothes thankfully. \n\u201cHow are you going to get the suit back?\u201d Ned asked. \nPeter didn\u2019t even want to think about having to call Tony and explaining that a multi-million dollar suit was currently superglued to the side of a random building. \u201cThat is a problem for later.\u201d\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d Ned agreed. \u201cZero chance of failure, right there.\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be right all the time,\u201d Peter told him firmly. \n*\nPeter woke up to his phone buzzing next to his ear. He squinted at it, surprised to see it was MJ. She\u2019d never actually called him before.\nHe answered with a bleary, \u201cHi?\u201d\n\u201cDude, I thought I made it clear I was your first line of defense,\u201d MJ said. \u201cYou gotta keep me in the know.\u201d\nWith a sinking feeling, Peter remembered the night before. \u201cUm.\u201d\n\u201cI mean, obviously softball season\u2019s over,\u201d MJ continued. \u201cIt\u2019s time to destroy these mofos. You got Barnes\u2019 number?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, exactly, is on the internet?\u201d Peter asked hesitantly.\n\u201cEverything?\u201d MJ said. \u201cNamely, a mostly-naked you. Do you really not wear socks in the suit? Don\u2019t the boots get funky?\u201d\n\u201cThey get all bunched up and there\u2019s no way to pull them back up,\u201d Peter muttered defensively. His cheeks felt warm. But if MJ had been focused on his feet, maybe it hadn\u2019t been so bad---\n\u201cAlso,\u201d MJ added, and Peter could feel her smirk through the phone. \u201cNice undies. It\u2019s a bold choice, wearing your own face over your junk, but I respect that.\u201d\nPeter had been so focused on the embarrassment of getting stuck to a building that he had forgotten which boxers he had been wearing when he\u2019d been forced to shuck his suit. \u201cOh no.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like Tony Stark will be proud of you,\u201d MJ said. \u201cHe seems like the kind of guy to wear his own merch, too.\u201d\n\u201cLet me die,\u201d Peter said, smashing his face into his pillow. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic,\u201d MJ said. \u201cJust because millions of people saw you in your Spidey-drawers--\u201d\n\u201cMillions?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cracked and it didn\u2019t even matter, he was already at peak humiliation.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d MJ said, almost gently. \u201cIt\u2019s video of a superhero shedding his clothes and scampering up the side of a building in just his mask and underwear that have his name scrawled on the butt. It had its own segment on the Today show. Cap is winning and we need to call in the big guns.\u201d\nPeter agreed and hung up. He went into the kitchen to find food before having to make contact with the Winter Soldier, and Aunt May raised her eyebrow at him. \u201cFun night?\u201d\n\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to buy me merch from that sketchy kiosk. I don\u2019t even get royalties from it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wore Spider-Man boxers out to go Spider-Manning,\u201d Aunt May said with a you get what you get shrug. \nPeter poured a bowl of cereal and started eating it there at the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up showing my underwear to the entire world.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t have chest hair at your age,\u201d Aunt May said with a frankly evil grin, and Peter cut her off with a, \u201cAunt May, gross, stop!\u201d before she could get too deep into her second-favorite body hair speech.\n\u201cSeriously, though, Petey-Pete,\u201d Aunt May said, \u201care you okay? No one knows it was you.\u201d\n\u201cExcept for the people who do,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAnd probably this is going to replace the Port-a-Potty picture for the one they use when talking about Spider-Man on the news.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay. Just gotta get some serious revenge on Team Cap.\u201d\n\u201cYou went up a building because Captain America told you to?\u201d Aunt May asked skeptically.\n\u201cNo, because Scarlet Witch offered a team-up. She\u2019s working with Cap and Black Widow, apparently.\u201d Peter decided to leave off the why. \nAunt May tapped on the rim of her coffee cup. \u201cWhat\u2019s your game plan?\u201d\n\u201cMJ says it\u2019s time to call in Barnes,\u201d Peter said. He finished his first bowl of cereal and poured another. \nAunt May nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Let her take lead on this one.\u201d\n\u201cAye, aye,\u201d Peter said, saluting with his spoon.\n\u201cAnd at least it\u2019s not a school day,\u201d Aunt May said. \u201cGet in front of this before Monday, alright? I don\u2019t want this to affect your grades.\u201d\n\u201cWill do,\u201d Peter promised.\nFour hours later, he was sitting in a coffee shop with MJ, Ned and Bucky Barnes. It turned out that century-old supersoldier assassins liked frozen concoctions so sweet that Peter was pretty sure that a healing factor was the only reason Bucky still had teeth. \nMJ had ordered the same thing; Peter was unsurprised by anything she did.\n\u201cSo you might be wondering why I gathered you here today,\u201d Ned said gravely once everyone was settled.\n \u201cWe all know,\u201d Peter said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have to rehash the events again.\u201d\nMJ looked like she very much wanted to. Bucky chuckled into his whipped cream. \n\u201cI think we should,\u201d said Ned, the traitor. \u201cBecause I want it on the record that I told you before you went that it was a terrible idea and you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nPeter held his hands out and said, \u201cDude. Uncool.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to suppress the truth,\u201d MJ said before taking a slurping sip of her drink.\n\u201cThe important thing is,\u201d Peter said loudly, \u201crevenge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of vengeance are you thinking?\u201d Bucky asked. \n\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in,\u201d MJ said. \u201cYou\u2019re our key to an inside job.\u201d\nBucky raised an eyebrow at her. \n\u201cWe have access to video feeds from the public spaces in the Avengers HQ,\u201d MJ began. \n\u201cWe do?\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Ned said. Peter shot him a look. Ned shrugged. \u201cI get bored when you\u2019re on patrol. A man can only binge so many shows.\u201d\nBucky looked reluctantly impressed. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to want me to lure Steve into a public area.\u201d\n\u201cAre you an amatuer?\u201d MJ scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be on red alert after the prank he pulled. I mean, Peter\u2019s lucky in that he\u2019s used to public humiliation. Someone with less experience would still be hiding under their pillow. And you\u2019re good but he\u2019s got Black Widow on his side. No, you\u2019re going to pick a public spot that he already goes to and you\u2019re going to lay the trap.\u201d\n\u201cHow many prank wars have you been in?\u201d Bucky asked, looking fascinated. \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some shit,\u201d MJ said calmly. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve progressed to physical pranks. Are you okay with this?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u201cAnd your role has to be secret,\u201d MJ said. \u201cNo matter how tempting it is to make fun of him. Can you handle that?\u201d\n\u201cI think I can manage that,\u201d Bucky said.\n\u201cBut what are we going to do to him?\u201d Peter said. \u201cWe can\u2019t exactly glue him to a wall.\u201d\n\u201cCome on now,\u201d MJ said. \u201cYou\u2019re innovative. That was funny because you can crawl up walls. No, in order to achieve prank greatness, we have to get a real reaction out of Cap.\u201d She gave Bucky her sunniest smile. \u201cThink of some good locations, and I\u2019ll get back to you on the specifics.\u201d\n*\nAfter Bucky left, Peter said, \u201cSo, MJ, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you\u2019re keeping Barnes in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cDamn right I am,\u201d MJ said. \u201cThis is war, Peter, and that man is on a need-to-know basis.\u201d\n\u201cI have so much respect for you right now,\u201d Ned said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s heavily theorized that the Winter Soldier killed JFK, and yet you just made him your prank war intern.\u201d\nMJ propped her boots up on Bucky\u2019s abandoned chair and said, \u201cTo be fair, he\u2019s used to taking orders.\u201d\n\u201cYou two are never allowed in Avengers HQ,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019d get a lifetime ban or our asses kicked, but something bad would happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, that place is the soulless embodiment of the commodification of heroism,\u201d MJ said cheerfully.\n\u201cShut your mouth, you know it\u2019s the coolest place we\u2019ve never been invited,\u201d Ned argued. \n\u201cSo is it just Bucky in the dark or are you going to share with the rest of us?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the know, no worries,\u201d MJ said. \u201cYour job is to acquire a gallon of glitter.\u201d\nNed\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cMJ, you evil genius.\u201d\nShe preened and said, \u201cI know.\u201d\nThat was when Tony called. Peter stared at his phone in dismay. \u201cGuys, I forgot the suit. The ridiculously-expensive most important thing in my life! How did I not go back for the suit?\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned said. \u201cDon\u2019t answer it.\u201d\n\u201cChickenshit,\u201d MJ said and took the phone out of his hand, answering it with a, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Stark?\u201d\nPeter shamelessly used his superpowers to listen in. Tony said without missing a beat, \u201cHey there Chipette, I need to talk to Alvin about losing his sweater.\u201d\nMJ rolled her eyes. \u201cHow\u2019d you get it off the wall? I bet you just took the wall, didn\u2019t you, and you\u2019re going to hand Peter a new suit and pretend like it was the old one.\u201d\nThere was a marked pause. \u201cOf course not. That would be ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cCool,\u201d MJ said. \u201cRoll it in some corn chips before you hand it over and it\u2019ll smell funky enough that he\u2019ll believe you.\u201d\n\u201cMJ,\u201d Peter hissed, mortified. \u201cGimme the phone.\u201d\nMJ flashed him a winning smile and tossed his phone at him. He put it to his ear and started apologizing immediately. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark, but--\u201d\n\u201cCool it, kid, I\u2019m not the Spanish Inquisition,\u201d Tony said. Peter could imagine the way Tony would be holding his hands out, as if to ward off unnecessary apologies. \u201cI\u2019d give you more hell about abandoning the suit like that, but it sounds like you\u2019re already catching it by the bucketful.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAnd also the internet saw my underwear, so. There\u2019s that.\u201d\n\u201cI remember my first time getting papped in my skivvies,\u201d Tony said, sounding nostalgic. \u201cI was in a hardware store. Good times. Of course, I didn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure to advertise my brand at the same time, so obviously you kids today are ahead of the game.\u201d\n\u201cYes, absolutely, ahead of the game, that\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThanks for rescuing my suit.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta pick up after you,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThough the next time I see it just lying around\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Peter said reflexively, just like he did when Aunt May made similar threats. \u201cI\u2019ll pick up after myself next time.\u201d\n\u201cNow, more importantly,\u201d Tony said, \u201care you going to get back at Cap? Because I gotta say, he\u2019s been super smug today. I don\u2019t want to make you self-conscious but there\u2019s a very unflattering picture of you currently hanging in the lobby here.\u201d\n\u201cDude, it\u2019s your building, can\u2019t you take it down?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cI mean, in theory I could, but it\u2019s pretty entertaining,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAnd good for morale and all that jazz.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Peter muttered as he hung up. He looked at MJ and Ned. \u201cWe\u2019re moving the timetable up.\u201d\n*\nPeter and Ned spent the rest of the evening figuring out how to create what were essentially glitter landmines to scatter throughout the living areas frequented by Cap, Sam, Natasha and Wanda. There was a high chance of friendly fire if Tony or Rhodey or Pepper happened through, but MJ had declared it an acceptable loss. Probably Tony would find the humor in it. \nHopefully.\n\u201cI think these will work,\u201d Ned said, lining them up on the desk. \u201cIs this enough? I mean, MJ wants this to be epic.\u201d\n\u201cI think it will be,\u201d Peter said. He\u2019d pushed for making them remotely detonated but Ned had pointed out that put too much power in Bucky\u2019s hands. \u201cI think the red and blue glitter is a great touch.\u201d\nMJ had also found some Halloween spider and web shaped confetti that they\u2019d crammed in with the glitter. \n\u201cAvengers HQ is going to sparkle forever,\u201d Ned said. \u201cThis will be your legacy.\u201d\n\u201cAll we have to do is deliver these bad boys to Barnes and we\u2019re set,\u201d Peter said happily.\n*\nThe glitter bombs were even more spectacular than Peter thought they would be.\nThey were lucky in that all of their enemies were currently staying at the Avengers HQ. Bucky had confirmed Cap for the early to bed early to rise type, and had sabotaged the common kitchen, knowing Steve was often the first one up and about in the morning. \nThe security cams had captured everything: Steve Rogers entering the kitchen just past daybreak, looking annoyingly bright-eyed even at that hour, walking with purpose to the fridge. Opening the fridge. The look on his face going from calm to horrified as glitter exploded everywhere, filling the air with sparkles and confetti raining down. Steve saying, \u201cWhat??\u201d confusedly.\nSteve stepping back, his face entirely covered in glitter, opening a drawer for a dish towel only to have another glitter explosion happen, even more spectacular than the first.\nThis time, Steve was cognizant enough of what was happening to start swearing up a storm. \n\u201cRewind that bit,\u201d MJ said as they watched through the tapes. \u201cDid we really get Captain America on camera saying \u2018shit biscuits\u2019? We\u2019re going to break the motherloving internet, guys.\u201d\n\u201cThis is without a doubt the greatest day of our lives,\u201d Ned said happily. \u201cKeep going, my favorite bit is coming up.\u201d\nPeter hit play again. Glitter and confetti were still fluttering in the air when Sam hurried in, no doubt because of Cap\u2019s increasingly creative cursing. \u201cDude,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \nCap turned to him, his face sparkling red and blue, face grim. \u201cWe got Spider-ed.\u201d\nPeter had never felt so proud and/or badass in his life. Ned let out a whoop, and MJ even grinned.\nOn the screen, Natasha entered the scene, smirking at Sam and Cap as she leaned casually against the counter. She apparently had a favorite spot to lean, and Bucky had definitely done his homework, because when she pushed the slightly-ajar drawer in with her hip another glitter explosion hit the air.\nShe startled like a cat, jumping slightly and turning with unfortunate precision directly into the heaviest burst of glitter.\nBy this point all three were so heavily glittered that Peter was pretty sure that it was permanently embedded in their skin. Probably Peter had accidentally invented glitter tattooing. Probably he should enjoy this feeling of triumph because he was going to be utterly destroyed next time he came anywhere near the Avengers.\nNed stopped the video. \u201cThey haven\u2019t found the ones in the lounge yet.\u201d\n\u201cGlitter revenge part deux,\u201d MJ said. \u201cWe need to get this shit online.\u201d\nNed decided that a minimalist approach was the best, despite Peter\u2019s argument for a slow-mo shot of Cap\u2019s face as he first got blasted with glitter. \u201cWe have to give the internet some things to work with,\u201d he said \nThey uploaded the video with the description heck yeah you got Spider\u2019d #pottymouth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really too bad that this isn\u2019t eligible for an Oscar,\u201d Ned said. \u201cI really feel like we\u2019d be contenders.\u201d\n\u201cThat went even better than planned,\u201d Peter said, amazed. \u201cBucky really came through.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s legit,\u201d MJ agreed. \u201cGlitter is the most savage art supply. You don\u2019t do that to someone lightly.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably still trying to get it off,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI mean, that was so much glitter. Will it ever come off?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to have to burn the kitchen down and start again,\u201d Ned said.\nPeter high fived everyone. \u201cGood work, guys. We absolutely just won this prank war.\u201d\n*\nFour hours later, a courier dropped off a package. Peter was skeptical about opening it, but the card said, \u201cI\u2019m so proud -TS\u201d so he chanced opening it.\nIt was a glorious new laptop, far more powerful than Peter\u2019s current rigged-up one. Upon closer inspection it wasn\u2019t even anything that was on the market yet, and Peter realized it was one of Tony\u2019s personal prototypes.\nHe hugged it to himself and sent Tony a video of himself shrieking happily and waving the laptop over his head like a four year old on Christmas.\n*\nThe glitterbombing didn\u2019t quite break the internet, but Spider-Man\u2019s indecent exposure was dropped from the news cycles in favor of a sparkling, foul-mouthed Captain America, and Peter was eternally thankful. There was reference to Spider-Man\u2019s public humiliation, but Captain America was, well, Captain America, and Peter felt confident in the knowledge that he had totally won.\nWhen he went to school the next day, there were a few references to Spider-Man\u2019s Spidey-shorts, but not nearly the onslaught of mockery that Peter had been bracing himself for. \n\u201cI think the best part was he named the meme himself this time,\u201d Flash told Betty loudly in Chem. \u201cThat\u2019s legendary, right there. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a true hero.\u201d\n\u201cI bet he\u2019s still sparkling,\u201d Betty said thoughtfully. \u201cOne time I accidentally used lotion with body glitter in it and I sparkled for a week.\u201d\nPeter smiled down at his laptop. He was still bringing his trusty old one to school, unwilling to chance anything happening to the one Tony had gifted him with. His phone buzzed, somehow seeming urgent, and he dug it out of his pocket to see that Tony was calling him. \n\u201cCan I be excused?\u201d Peter said, shoving the phone back into his pocket and sticking his hand in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency.\u201d\nHis teacher waved him out, and he hurried out of the room, answering his phone as soon as he was safely in the hall. Tony didn\u2019t call often, and definitely not during school hours. \u201cYeah, Mr. Stark? Do you need me?\u201d\n\u201cI need you to tell me if there are any more glitter bombs planted in Avengers HQ,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an incident.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter said, \u201cJust the one in the couch?\u201d\n\u201cFound that one,\u201d Tony said. \u201cOr, I should say, Bruce found that one.\u201d\nPeter slumped against a locker, stomach twisting. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\u201cIt turns out that the Hulk likes sparkles,\u201d Tony said, \u201cand we avoided any major structural damage. The couch is a goner, though.\u201d\n\u201cThat was the last one,\u201d Peter said weakly.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Tony said. He paused. \u201cWhen you put it online, you should give it a kicky soundtrack. Something upbeat.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Peter said. \n\u201cPepper says it\u2019s actually my fault for encouraging the delinquency of minors,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re sure that\u2019s the last one, we\u2019re golden.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re golden,\u201d Peter agreed.\n*\nPeter peered over MJ\u2019s shoulder at lunch. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you texting Bucky Barnes right now?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a spiritual connection,\u201d MJ deadpanned. \nThe conversation appeared to be entirely gifs of adorable puppies tripping over their own feet. \u201cI thought you were a cat person,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cI am,\u201d MJ said. \nPeter didn\u2019t bother trying; as far as he could tell, MJ was the closest thing to a mysterious oracle that existed at Midtown High. Getting anything out of her was like pulling teeth. \u201cSo I guess we trust him now?\u201d\n\u201cHe did publically humiliate his best friend for us without telling him,\u201d MJ said. \u201cHe seems pretty solid.\u201d\n\u201cFair,\u201d Peter said, scooting over as Ned arrived to give him a better spot. He remembered his phone call with Tony. \u201cGuys, we miscalculated slightly.\u201d\nNed\u2019s face after Peter told him about the Hulk was a thing of wonder. \u201cWait, are we now going to have to fight the Hulk? The man is a scientist. He\u2019ll out-science us every day of the week.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think knowing science is a prerequisite of winning,\u201d MJ said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re missing the salient point.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Ned asked.\n\u201cWe have our follow-up video,\u201d MJ said triumphantly.\n*\nHulk Sparkles became the best-selling Halloween costume that year.\n*\nPeter was pretty sure that he had won. \nBucky was around a lot more -- trading books and snark with MJ, letting Ned prod at his newly constructed arm, and, most alarmingly, taking Aunt May out for lunch while they were in school. He confirmed that Steve still sparkled when the light hit him just right, and that Natasha and Sam had most definitely not forgotten what had happened, but that there were no current plans to take Peter out.\n\u201cIt would be hard to top,\u201d Bucky said with a shrug after they all decided that fro-yo was needed after school. He\u2019d met them there and had filled a cup to the brim with eight flavors and every topping available.\n\u201cCaptain America doesn\u2019t seem like a quitter,\u201d Peter argued. He looked at his friends for back-up.\n\u201cWell, you do have the advantage of having a secret identity, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be enough of a dick to compromise it,\u201d MJ said.\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d said Bucky, and he\u2019d known the guy since before the Depression, so Peter trusted his opinion.\n\u201cSo just stay away from superheros,\u201d Ned said with a shrug. \u201cYou managed it really well for most of your run as Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Peter said flatly. \u201cAppreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be your friend if I lied to you,\u201d Ned shrugged.\n\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d MJ said. \u201cI mean, I appreciate the scenery, don\u2019t get me wrong, but don\u2019t you have better things to do?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly have a job,\u201d Bucky said with a shrug. \u201cAnd your problems are less fraught than everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\nThat seemed fair. \nPeter narrowed his eyes at Bucky. \u201cBut why are you taking Aunt May to lunch so much?\u201d\nBucky gave him a shit-eating grin and Peter was forced to throw a balled-up napkin at the Winter Soldier. (He missed.)\n*\nBucky insinuated himself so smoothly into their lives that, a week later when he asked if Peter would meet him in Brooklyn, none of the three thought anything of it. Peter took the train to the address Bucky had sent him, squinting around as he stepped out into the sunshine.\n The favor itself had been unspecified, but Peter had his suit -- almost identical to the one that was still glued to a pile of bricks in the corner of Tony\u2019s lab -- tucked into his backpack just in case.\n\u201cI bet he just can\u2019t figure out how to work his tv,\u201d MJ had said when he\u2019d mentioned it at lunch. \u201cOld farts struggle with that sort of thing.\u201d\nPeter hoped not; he wanted very much to go on a real mission with the Avengers again. He\u2019d trained with them, but that was a very different thing than getting to actually get out there and fight.\nThe address Bucky had sent him was for a ground-level apartment with a slightly ajar door. Peter felt like something was hinky, but a quick glance around proved that the apartment was empty.\nIt was only once he was fully inside that the door swung closed and locked with a faint but audible click. \nHe immediately tried the door, but to no avail. It was locked. Peter attempted to force the handle, figuring that super-strength would win, but to his surprise the handle proved resistant. \nSo he was locked inside some random superhero-proofed apartment in Brooklyn. Awesome. \nPeter felt like a complete dolt when he only realized that he still had his phone in his pocket when it buzzed. He pulled it out to find a text from Bucky: sorry but all\u2019s fair. suit up.\nPeter sighed and called Ned first; no sense stepping into whatever horrible plan Cap and Bucky had for him without letting his friends know. Ned and MJ were together, thankfully, though Peter now deeply regretted letting them know the Instagram\u2019s password. \n\u201cHe infiltrated us,\u201d MJ said, betrayed, on speaker on the other end.\n\u201cWe really dropped the ball,\u201d Ned said. \u201cI mean. It\u2019s the Winter Soldier. We really should have had our guard up for sneaky tactics.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so stupid,\u201d Peter said. \u201cOf course Bucky Barnes wouldn\u2019t turn on Steve Rogers. There are actual books written about their friendship. They are such great friends that people write freakin\u2019 dissertations on them. We deserve to lose.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost yet,\u201d MJ said fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t do what he says.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when Peter got a flurry of texts from Bucky, telling him what he had to do. Peter\u2019s stomach sank.\n\u201cGuys,\u201d he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely lost. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d \nAnd he hung up and suited up. He went deeper into the apartment to a back bedroom, and there was a closet, door wedged shut with a familiar shield. Peter pried it loose - a feat that took superhuman strength to accomplish -- and the door spilled open immediately, Captain America stumbling out into the light, blinking owlishly.\n\u201cWho-- Spider-Man?\u201d he said, clearly at a loss. \u201cHere to gloat?\n\u201cI wish,\u201d Peter said. \u201cDid your bestest buddy lock you in there?\u201d\n\u201cWhile working for your team...\u201d Cap began, but trailed off. \u201cOh no. He\u2019s not working for you, is he?\u201d\n\u201cThe whole apartment is sealed,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI think he\u2019s gone rogue.\u201d\n\u201cI knew that things were going too smoothly,\u201d Cap said, which isn\u2019t how Peter would have described things, given that still glittered slightly when the light hit him just right. \n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I trusted him,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe even took my aunt out to eat, and it was all she would talk about for days. She\u2019s had a history-crush on him for as long as I can remember.\u201d\nCap blinked, but obviously chose not to comment on Bucky\u2019s commitment to his long game. Peter decided to help him out by holding out his phone and letting Cap read the instructions Bucky had left for them. He sighed. \u201cAre we sure there\u2019s no way out?\u201d\n\u201cI mean,we can try,\u201d Peter said, \u201cbut short of destroying the apartment, which Bucky was sure to mention belongs to a charitable organization and thus that would be an asshole move, I think we have to go with it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is poetic justice,\u201d Cap mused. \u201cAnd if I know Buck, he really won\u2019t let us out until we\u2019ve done it.\u201d\nPeter nodded; he had the same impression and he\u2019d only known Bucky a hot minute. \u201cAbout the ceasefire\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the smartest thing Buck had in there,\u201d Cap said. \u201cThis has been the most fun I\u2019ve had in ages, but it\u2019s getting a bit public.\u201d\n\u201cA bit?\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou saw how much of me was public.\u201d\nCaptain America snickered. At him. Peter was very glad that his mask completely hid how much he was blushing. \u201cSorry, pal, I didn\u2019t actually think about how you would get off the wall. If it makes you feel better, Nat was so cranky about the glitter that she dumped all the excess in my underwear drawer. I didn\u2019t notice until too late.\u201d\nPeter let out a loud, honking laugh that he would probably be embarrassed about if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Captain America had just admitted to having accidentally glittered his junk. \u201cMan, I recruited the wrong former assassin.\u201d\n\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Cap said. He held out his hand. \u201cTruce?\u201d\n\u201cTruce,\u201d Peter agreed, shaking firmly. \u201cNow\u2026\u201d\nCap nodded. \u201cI guess we should just get it over with?\u201d\nPeter agreed, and started to record.\n*\nThat evening, a video appeared on the account most people had come to assume belonged to Bucky Barnes, given the sheer number of selfies of Bucky with various foods that had appeared on it. \nIn the video, Captain America and Spider-Man, with forced smiles, giving a rousing speech about believing in yourself. \u201cRemember,\u201d Captain America said in a fake, smiling tone most often found in his promotional materials recorded for the Department of Education and Army recruitment, \u201cFriendship is a journey. Sometimes it starts out on rocky footing.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you have to overcome differences and embarrassing mistakes,\u201d Spider-Man added in a loud, equally fake tone, though considerably less commanding than Captain America\u2019s.\n\u201cBut in the end,\u201d Captain America said, turning towards Spider-Man.\n\u201cYou can always hug it out,\u201d they said in unison before giving each other a hug, Spider-Man standing on tip-toes and still getting smooshed into Captain America\u2019s shoulder.\nThen they high-fived and smiled at the camera -- at least, Captain America did, presumably so did Spider-Man -- while giving a thumbs-up to their audience.\nIt broke the internet."
