    "text": "Clark pushed through the crowd, camera slung over his shoulder, making a beeline for the bathrooms.\u00a0\nNot necessarily having to pee didn\u2019t preclude  Clark Kent, bumbling idiot, from wiping sweaty palms on cheap polyester and nervously eyeing the exits, mumbling about too much water and dashing off.\u00a0\nIt was a great way to get out of unfortunate conversations (how is Lois doing, anyway? I heard you aren\u2019t working together as much since--) and avoid unfortunate people (Lex Luthor, society hags who pinched rear ends indiscriminately).\u00a0\nConsidering he\u2019d used it twice already tonight, he was long overdue for actually making an appearance in the bathroom.\u00a0\nEyeing the overcrowded bathrooms near the main ballroom, he diverted toward the catering entrance, smiling at the staff until he found a quiet men\u2019s restroom tucked into the back corner.\u00a0\nWith a sigh, he pushed the door open, relieved to find it empty. Glancing at himself in the mirror, he considered leaving entirely. He\u2019d gotten enough photos, and--\nA quiet moan interrupted that line of thought, drawing him short. He hadn\u2019t heard another heartbeat--hadn\u2019t even been  listening for one, considering how far out of the way the bathroom was, but--\nHe tilted his head, smelling blood. Suddenly,  Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter  fell away. Someone was hurt. Someone was in  pain. \nFollowing the scent, he walked past the stall doors, one by one. Finally coming up on the handicap stall, he braced himself and opened it.\u00a0\nA dazed-looking Bruce Wayne blinked up at him, covered in blood.\u00a0\nHe was slumped against the wall, foot braced on the toilet. A broken champagne glass was scattered in pieces on the floor around him.\u00a0\n\u201cMr\u2026\u201d Clark swallowed, throat suddenly dry. \u201cMr. Wayne?\u201d\nThe billionaire winced, eyes closing briefly. One of them was already mostly shut, swollen by what must have been an impressive hit. Blood was dribbling from his lips, his ears...his nose...\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wayne coughed, holding his ribs gingerly. Blood continued to pour out of his nose--clearly broken--as he spoke. \u201cS\u2019not the worst position \u2018been found in...\u201d\nClark stared, at a loss for words.\u00a0\nBruce Wayne -- billionaire playboy, owner of at  most,  three brain cells -- beaten up at his own charity gala. Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises out of nepotism and dumb luck, whose business wasn\u2019t touched by corruption purely because of incompetence -- Bruce Wayne, airheaded and still generous, still kind, bloody in a stall and trying to  hide it.\u00a0 \nHis hand clenched on the stall door, crumpling it between his fingers. His eyes weren\u2019t burning yet, but barely.\u00a0\n\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d he asked, deceptively quiet. Sheer rage boiled in his chest.\u00a0\n\n It wasn\u2019t right.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wayne asked, sluggish. His eye had fully swollen shut, turning an ugly purple shade. \u201cM\u2019fine. Jus\u2019...tripped.\u201d\nClark released the stall door, kneeling carefully in front of the billionaire. He shrugged out of his cheap sport coat, wrapping it into a pad and pressing it gingerly to the other man\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Wayne...you need to go to a hospital.\u201d\nWayne smiled, an awful grimace of bloody teeth and swollen lips.\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018told you. M\u2019fine,\u201d he patted at his suit jacket, looking around, \u201cWhr\u2019s m\u2019phone?\u201d\n\u201cYou need medical services, Mr. Wayne,\u201d Clark said, panicking as the other man made to get up, \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding and your heart is going a million miles an hour--\u201d\u00a0\nWayne squinted at him, pushing nominally with the foot braced against the toilet in an effort to get up.\u00a0\n\u201cOh...you\u2019re takin\u2019 my...pulse?\u201d\nClark immediately moved his hand to Wayne\u2019s wrist, pretending to take his heart rate. \u201cY- Yes, Mr. Wayne. And I\u2019m very concerned.\u201d\nWayne, bless him, looked too concussed to argue. He blinked his one good eye, clearly trying to put the pieces together.\u00a0\n\u201cS\u2019just a...disagreement,\u201d he mumbled, glancing at the broken champagne glass remnants. With a moan, he tried to curl up against the wall, making himself smaller. \u201cM\u2019fine.\u201d\nClark saw red as soon as the pitiful noise registered, reaching forward in an aborted attempt to help.\u00a0\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d\nWayne stared at him, not understanding the question.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d he said in a far-off voice, staring up at him, \u201cy\u2019wearing...contacts or s\u2019mthing\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nClark felt his face flush, putting a hand up to his glasses. \u201cI--\u201d\nHis now  slightly-melted glasses. He blinked away the fire in his eyes, pulling off the glasses before Wayne could notice.\u00a0\n\u201cRed\u2019s your color...\u201d Wayne continued dreamily, \u201c...handsome w\u2019the hair. M\u2019all red now too\u2026\u201d\nClark watched as Wayne\u2019s head drifted toward the wall, resting against it for a moment.\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Wayne, are you...drunk?\u201d\n\u201cNot...on purpose.\u201d Wayne said, sounding dejected. It was hard to tell, muffled against the wall. \u201cThink I was...drugged.\u201d\nHe waved vaguely at the floor, where the champagne glass had shattered. There was glass embedded in his palm, slowly leaking blood.\u00a0\nSo they\u2019d drugged him, waited for him to feel sick, and then tailed him to the bathrooms. Effective. Quiet. Easy exit where they wouldn\u2019t be seen.\u00a0\nWhoever it was, Clark had a few questions.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay now,\u201d he said, placing a hand on Wayne\u2019s shoulder, rubbing slow circles. \u201cI\u2019m going to go call 911, and then I\u2019m going to find whoever did this.\u201d\nMore than a few questions, perhaps.\nIf his comm was still working, Bruce was pretty sure Alfred would be laughing at him.\u00a0\nHis evening was going swimmingly. Playing  Brucie never got easier, but at least it was familiar.\u00a0\nHe went through the motions at the entrance--smiled at the cameras, waved at the children in the crowd, said a few words about poverty--and dove into the crowd, waiting for his mark.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d thrown back the champagne when it was handed to him, playing into the part for the elder society ladies with a wink that left them tittering. Never thinking about what could\u2019ve been in it.\u00a0\nLying against a bathroom stall with an anxious Superman, covered in blood, and the proud owner of some newly-cracked ribs, he\u2019d clearly learned his lesson.\u00a0\nAt least he\u2019d stopped hallucinating. Half of the horror of the whole night wasn\u2019t even from the beating -- it was the way his father\u2019s face stared down at him from the mirror over their shoulders, cold and disapproving.\u00a0\n\n flecked with his mother\u2019s blood-- \n\nThe hits hadn\u2019t mattered, then. He could take them. It was the  after that pierced him to his core, shivering on the floor.\u00a0\nAnd how fortuitous was it that Superman himself had chosen the same bathroom, entering just as he\u2019d been released from vivid nightmares of death and blood.\u00a0\nSuperman, who was still desperately trying to be  Clark Kent, Kansas reporter, despite the clear gouges he\u2019d left in the bathroom stall door.\u00a0\nDespite the fact that he\u2019d melted his own glasses off his face, even with Bruce\u2019s half-coherent hints and nudges.\u00a0\nHe was holding onto his secret identity by a thread. There was no way he could let the idiot leave the bathroom.\u00a0\nAbove him, Kent was saying something about 911, going on intently about justice and  finding who did this to you. Internally, Bruce rolled his eyes, weighing his options.\u00a0\nHe really was quite handsome without the glasses.\nFace screwed up in an expression of righteous contempt, and therefore not looking at him, it was almost too easy to slip a hand around the other man\u2019s wrist, blinking up at him coquettishly.\u00a0\nOr, as coquettish as he could be with one working eye and potentially missing teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease...don\u2019t leave me,\u201d he said, letting a slight tremor into the words, \u201cD\u2019n wanna be alone\u2026\u201d\nAlfred would be in tears. He\u2019d teased him enough about his obsession with Superman. To hear him  beg\u2026 \nMaybe it was a good thing they\u2019d smashed the comm in his ear. Maybe it was worth the ruptured eardrum, after all.\u00a0\nKent, to his credit, immediately placed himself in between Bruce and the door, puffing out his chest.\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d he vowed, glancing down at the hand he had on his wrist. His cheeks pinked, and he looked away, breath hitching.\u00a0\n Tactile. Good. I\u2019ll remember that. \u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Bruce said, meaning it. He trailed off, glancing down at the floor. Was it actually spinning? \u201cM\u2019gonna nap now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll--wait, what?\u201d\nKnowing Kent couldn\u2019t track down people and blow his secret identity with his arms full, Bruce smiled, and gladly passed out against the other man\u2019s chest.\u00a0\nClark was panicking.\u00a0\nBruce Wayne --  the Bruce Wayne, and he still couldn\u2019t quite believe that -- had given him the most charming, bloody smile, and passed out straight into his arms.\u00a0\nHe shifted awkwardly so the other man\u2019s head was cradled against his shoulder, careful not to jostle his injuries. Wayne snuffled against his shirt, smearing blood against the collar.\u00a0\nIt was almost...endearing.\u00a0\nThe urge to leap up and chase after Wayne\u2019s mysterious attackers battled furiously with his desire to hold the billionaire close, sheltering him from the outside world. From those who would do him further harm.\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t leave him. Not like this. Not alone. But the press Wayne would get if he called 911 would be...obscene.\u00a0\nAnd, if he was honest, the desire to protect the man in his arms extended beyond this bathroom. Wayne... Bruce  ...didn\u2019t deserve to have photos of his bruised face on the front of the  Gotham Gazette. He didn\u2019t deserve to be mocked and abused further.\u00a0\nClark paused for a moment, listening to Bruce\u2019s lungs and heart. Despite the bruising to his chest, his airway sounded clear. His pulse was still elevated, but not dangerously so.\u00a0\n\n Lucky man... \n\nHe was still struggling to figure out what to do next when the bathroom door flew open, three masked men stepping in with guns drawn.\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, someone fou--\u201d\n\u201c--need him to open the phone--\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have room for extras!\u201d\nClark blinked up at the three figures arguing over him, at a loss for words.\u00a0\n\u201c...hi?\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the men gestured with the gun. \u201cGive us Wayne.\u201d\nHe tightened his arms around the billionaire, puffing his chest out and hoping it made him look more intimidating. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\nWithout warning, the man who\u2019d spoken raised his gun and shot him in the shoulder. Clark winced as the bullet bounced off him, whizzing around the room.\u00a0\nThere was a confused silence.\u00a0\n\u201cUm...ow?\u201d he wiggled his arm slightly, screwing up his face. \u201cThat really hurt.\u201d\nHe was pretty sure the three men were gaping under their masks.\u00a0\n\u201cMust have grazed me,\u201d Clark said quickly, panicking and grasping for a lie, \u201c wow, so weird how ricochets work, am I ri--\u201d\nA taser appeared out of nowhere, leveled at his chest. He curled around Bruce even further, debating simply dropping the pretense entirely, worried for the smaller man.\u00a0\nBut a taser meant they wanted them alive. And if they were alive, they could escape. And, with Bruce safe, Clark could finally deal with them on his own.\u00a0\nThe taser button depressed, sending out the prongs. With a sigh, he let them hit his chest, shaking his arms and dropping Bruce as gently as he could onto the floor, miming a seizure.\u00a0\nAs the taser clicked off, he made a big show of slumping over, eyes falling shut. Above him, he could hear the three masked men approach, stepping over his legs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cDid he just...pass out?\u201d\n\"...yeah, he did.\"\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 weirdo.\u201d\nAlfred parked behind a suspiciously-clean dumpster, narrowing his eyes. The back door to the kitchens was wide open, swinging on its hinges.\u00a0\nBefore he could exit the Rolls-Royce, a white van pulled out from the loading bay, tires screeching as it sped toward the mouth of the alley.\u00a0\nHe looked at the tracking program on his phone, sighing. The bright triangle that indicated Master Wayne\u2019s last known location remained in place, a few hallways inward and to the left.\u00a0\nAlfred had a sinking, inevitable feeling Master Wayne was no longer there.\u00a0\n\u201cOff we go, then,\u201d he said to himself, starting the car. \u201cAnother kidnapping. And he does this on  purpose.\u201d\nBruce woke up, to his surprise, somewhere that wasn't Kent\u2019s arms.\u00a0\nHe groaned as his shoulders were tugged back, wrists bound with something flat and plastic.  Zip ties.\u00a0 \n\n So they came back.\u00a0 \n\nSince he\u2019d dropped blatant hints about WE stock info on his phone for the past three excruciating weeks, hoping to identify them, it was really his own damn fault he\u2019d been targeted and beaten to a pulp. The goal of the night, even.\u00a0\nWas it his smartest plan? Absolutely not. Had he planned on being drugged and left to hallucinate in a bathroom until Superman stumbled onto him? No.\nThe idiots being unable to crack a simple phone passcode on the dummy iPhone hadn\u2019t been part of the plan, either. He\u2019d made it so easy for them --  Brucie had even hinted about the code being something \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cformative for me\u201d in a recent interview.\u00a0\nFive minutes after being plugged into their computer system, the iPhone was set to fry their servers and infect any connected CPUs with a Trojan he\u2019d designed specifically for their type of financial systems fraud.\u00a0\nHe had no love for the big banks and stock traders in Gotham, but the phantom dips and crashes had targeted the easiest victims -- bankrupting small businesses, 401k\u2019s, and devaluing nonprofit healthcare and provider stock shares.\nVictims, for the most part, who couldn\u2019t fight back.\u00a0\nAnd now, because he\u2019d underestimated how stupid Gotham criminals could be, he was tied to a chair, beaten, and his entire plan was worthless.\u00a0\nSomewhere, Jason was laughing at him.  Hard.\u00a0 \nHe forced his eyes open, groaning against the sudden light. Next to him, also ziptied to a chair, Clark Kent was doing a lukewarm impression of someone waking up from unconsciousness, squinting at the lamp hanging between them.\u00a0\n Could this get more clich\u00e9,  Bruce thought, glancing around the basement they were trapped in.  All we need is a table full of shiny knives and a leaky pipe-- \nThe fact that Superman had stayed with him, had cared enough about his safety (and, thank the lord, his own secret identity) to play along with their captors was...heartwarming. Adorable, even.\u00a0\nThere was a small voice inside of him, half-lucid from the drugs still, that insisted Clark Kent looked  good tied up to a chair and clearly disheveled, but he pushed it aside, taking stock of their situation.\u00a0\nHe had to get them to plug the phone into the computer without realizing it was a trick, and he had to do that in a way that didn\u2019t jeopardize his own secret identity, all while playing the part of the ditzy billionaire.\u00a0\nWith the added concern of keeping Kent from giving up his own secret. Considering the other man seemed to  want to be accidentally unmasked, it was an additional stressor he didn\u2019t need. Not while still concussed.\u00a0\n\u201cHey...you\u2019re okay\u2026\u201d\nBruce turned, spotting Kent leaning toward him eagerly. His eyes were wide, full of sincere desire to help.\nHe\u2019d seen the expression a million times in the  Daily Planet\u2019s coverage of Superman. Generally when he was comforting distressed civilians.\u00a0\nBruce wasn\u2019t a distressed civilian -- far from it -- but the motion was appreciated.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat...happened?\u201d he groaned, a part of him genuinely curious. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u201cThree men barged into the bathroom after you passed out,\u201d Kent said,  way too much Superman in the way his chest puffed out as he recounted their ordeal, \u201cThey tased me and then I woke up here...with you.\u201d\n\n Oh, Jesus Christ.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cI thought tasers didn\u2019t knock you out?\u201d he asked, almost afraid to hear what Kent would answer with.\u00a0\n\u201cOh! Um, they tased me,\u201d Kent exclaimed, eyes darting from side to side, \u201cAnd then they kicked me in the head! Haha. Forgot to mention that!\u201d\nBruce sighed internally. Externally, he put on an expression of mild concern, voice rising an octave. \u201cAre you  okay?\u00a0 You must be bleeding!\u201d\nIt was almost like grilling Dick on a hastily-constructed cover story. But Dick had been eight at the time, and a far, far better liar.\u00a0\nKent winced. \u201cIt\u2019s--uh. It\u2019s on the back of my head. Can\u2019t even see it.\u201d\n\u201cOh...okay.\u201d\u00a0\nPlaying airhead  Brucie  was taking a lot more out of him than usual. It was probably because of the concussion -- symptoms Kent should have been exhibiting if he\u2019d thought his lie through.\u00a0\n\u201cDid they say anything when they came back?\u201d\nKent flushed, looking sheepish. \u201cJust something about a phone, and getting it open.\u201d\u00a0\n\n Of course.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cDo you see any way to get out? I don\u2019t want to be here when those guys get back.\u201d\n\u201cUmm, hmm,\u201d Kent looked around the room, then widened his eyes comically at the far corner, \u201cOh my gosh! Look over there!\u201d\nBruce obliged with a deep, suffering internal sigh. He pretended to ignore the sound of Kent snapping his zip ties. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t see anything?\u201d\n\u201cI thought I saw a rat,\u201d Kent twisted in his seat, holding up a freed arm in poorly-feigned shock, \u201cWow! Look, I got one of my hands free!\u201d\nIf Kent hadn\u2019t been in the room, Bruce would have been out of the zipties as well. But unlike the other man, he was  actually good at maintaining a secret identity.\u00a0\n\u201cThink you can get the other one out?\u201d\nBruce politely ignored the second cracking noise. Kent triumphantly held up his other freed arm.\u00a0\n\u201cYup!\u201d\n\n It\u2019s going to be a long night... \n\nClark quickly stood up, moving across the room to Wayne. He bent down, reaching to help the other man out of his own zipties.\u00a0\nFor a second, he thought he saw something predatory flash in Wayne\u2019s eyes, gone as quickly as it\u2019d appeared. The billionaire gave him a guileless smile, teeth still streaked with blood.\u00a0\n\u201cCrazy how you found something to break the zipties with. I didn\u2019t even see anything in here!\u201d\nClark panicked briefly, then mimed holding a knife as he reached behind Wayne, snapping the plastic ties with a pinch of his fingers. His smile wobbled briefly as he looked back down at the other man.\u00a0\n\u201cGuess it was my lucky day,\u201d he said, feeling his cheeks redden slightly. \u201cAnyway, we should probably escape.\u201d\n\n And once you\u2019re safe, I\u2019m coming back... \n\nWayne nodded, glancing at the door seriously. It was almost cute to watch him screw up his face, rallying his three brain cells to think of a plan. \u201cWe need to figure out where we are, and then look for an exit.\u201d\nClark could see through walls, so the point was moot, but he digressed. \u201cRight. Do you think they\u2019ll notice us if we\u2019re gone?\u201d\nWayne winked at him, standing slowly. \u201cNot if we\u2019re quiet. And fast.\u201d\nHeat curled through his gut, snagging his attention. Clark shoved the attraction down, willing himself to focus.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nIf he\u2019d been anyone else other than  Brucie Wayne right now, he was sure Kent would\u2019ve caught on.\u00a0\nStumbling into the hallway, he\u2019d made himself giggle, catch Kent\u2019s arm, and flirtatiously declare that the reporter was a \u201cgood luck charm\u201d and that only his \u201cimpeccable bravery\u201d could lead them to safety.\u00a0\nPerhaps he was laying it on a bit thick --  Brucie might not know what \u201cimpeccable\u201d meant, but it seemed to shore up Kent\u2019s shoulders. Which was good, considering he was Bruce\u2019s only source of intel in an unfamiliar location.\u00a0\nDespite this, Kent blatantly using his X-Ray vision in front of him, confident that he wasn\u2019t intelligent enough to notice, rankled more than a little. A small  child -- not even one he\u2019d trained -- could tell something was going on.\u00a0\nIf anything, it made the charade a little easier on his end. All he had to do was giggle, pause at a hallway, and run a hand down Kent\u2019s arm, teasing.\u00a0\n\u201cLeft or right?\u201d he asked, deep down hating --  hating -- that Alfred would probably link up with them while he was still deep undercover like this.\u00a0\nKent paused, scanning the corridor with distant eyes. \u201cLeft. I think there might be an exit up ahead.\u201d\nInternally, Bruce rolled his eyes. Externally, he widened them, looking aghast. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\nKent blinked, obviously not prepared --  still -- to be questioned on the source of his miraculous information. \u201cI...uh\u2026\u201d\nBruce let him flounder, listening carefully as he let his own gaze go distant. Kent probably wouldn\u2019t even notice --  Brucie was always sort of living in his own world.\u00a0\nIf he wanted to escape with the mission completed, he still needed to get them to plug in the dummy phone. Short of walking into their tech room and plugging it in himself, that left him with limited options.\u00a0\n Especially  if he had to convince Kent to come with him, if only to preserve the idiot\u2019s tenuous grasp on his secret identity. Surely, with  Brucie safe and sound somewhere, the idiot would probably fly right back to the warehouse without even changing his clothes.\u00a0\n There. He could hear voices down the hallway to their right. Guards patrolling, most likely, which meant wherever they\u2019d put the phone, it was nearby.\u00a0\nNow to convince Kent to go that way.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we should go right,\u201d he pressed, tugging on Kent\u2019s arm. \u201cI have an  idea.\u201d\nKent blushed at his overly flirtatious tone, as he had been all night, then looked conflicted. Without giving away his powers, he couldn\u2019t exactly make an argument one way or the other why they couldn\u2019t go  Brucie\u2019s direction.\u00a0\nBruce prayed that it stayed that way, and Kent didn\u2019t take the risk of revealing himself, but he didn\u2019t have high hopes.\u00a0\n\u201cAwesome. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nClark felt a twinge of nervousness up his spine as Wayne led them  directly toward  the men who\u2019d kidnapped them, hanging off his arm and doing so much  insinuating with his eyes, Clark was worried he\u2019d break something.\u00a0\nIt was almost like Wayne  wanted  them to get caught. He shook his head, dismissing that thought entirely. If anything, Wayne probably thought he was  helping.\u00a0 \nWhich was, frankly, adorable. He\u2019d never sensed outright maliciousness from Wayne, only a desire to help others. It wasn\u2019t the billionaire\u2019s fault his worldview was so...limited.\u00a0\nNow, however, impressively recovered from his earlier injuries, Wayne seemed to be teasing the thread of attraction between them, flirting in between every breath until Clark was flustered enough to stop paying attention to their surroundings.\u00a0\nWhen they were a few rooms away from where the kidnappers seemed to be set up, he fought through the haze of embarrassment and lust, shaking his head.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should turn back. This definitely isn\u2019t the way out,\u201d he protested, looking around. \u201cWe might get caught again.\u201d\nWayne shrugged, looking around without a care in the world. \u201cI need to find my phone. Pretty sure it must be around here somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d Clark said, actually surprised, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for your  phone? \u201d\n\u201cI need it,\u201d Wayne said, like it explained everything. For him, it almost did. \u201cWhy do you look upset?\u201d\n\u201cWe  need to  escape,\u201d Clark said, voice rising, \u201cIt\u2019s not safe here!\u201d\n\u201cShhhhh,\u201d Wayne said, grabbing his bicep. \u201cCome here. I think I heard something.\u201d\nHe let the billionaire shove him into a small closet, closing the door behind them. To Clark\u2019s astonishment, two men walked down the hallway a second later, clearly patrolling.\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t even thought to listen to them, too busy being shocked by Wayne\u2019s materialism. It was just a  phone  -- Wayne could buy the entirety of Apple as simply as normal citizens bought new iPhones.  Several times over.\u00a0 \nThey waited until the footsteps passed in silence. Once Clark was satisfied they were far enough away, he reached for the door.\u00a0\u00a0\nWayne caught his wrist, shaking his head.\u00a0\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay in here forever,\u201d Clark said, anxiety growing, \u201cWe need to--hey. What are you doing?\u201d\nWayne had sunk to his knees, looking up at him imploringly through his lashes. His lips were pursed, heat simmering in his eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cThink you can stay quiet?\u201d\nKeeping Kent distracted and somewhat willing to adhere to his plan had been fairly easy, so far.\u00a0\nYet, as they clearly stumbled closer to the people Kent wanted to \u201cprotect\u201d him from, his resolve had strengthened, protectiveness flaring in the way he held his shoulders, in the way he gazed at Bruce.\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to distract him from the overall plan, but the tension between them seemed to  burn for a moment, as Bruce considered Kent\u2019s position -- that he was something to be protected. Cherished, even.\u00a0\nIt would be laughable to anyone back at the Manor, but that concern caught at something within Bruce, tugging at him. Something primal.\u00a0\nIt was almost too easy to kneel in front of the other man, mind whirring through a million other ways to distract the reporter other than this.\u00a0\nNo, he wanted to. He really, really kind of did.\u00a0\n\u201cThink you can stay quiet?\u201d he asked, looking up and knowing what kind of picture he made, pupils dilated and lips slightly open.\u00a0\nKent immediately went beet red, opening his mouth. No sound came out, and he closed it a moment later, clearly trying to find words.\u00a0\nBruce let a hand drift across the front of Kent\u2019s pants, teasing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say yes\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWayne --\u201d\n\u201cBruce, please,\u201d he said, letting his voice deepen. Not too close to the Batman\u2019s growl -- that would be too risky -- but close enough. \u201cJust a yes or a no, Kent\u2026\u201d\n\u201cClark,\u201d Kent insisted, swallowing hard. His throat worked up and down. \u201cC-call me Clark.\u201d\n\u201cClark,\u201d Bruce said, humming around the name. He looked up again. \u201cYes?\u201d\nThe other man swallowed again, eyes wide and pupils dilated. He was breathing heavily, despite the lack of need for it. \u201cY- yes.\u201d\nBruce reached for Kent-- Clark\u2019s-- pants, briefly debating the ethics of sexual intercourse under a false identity. He undid the zipper, sliding them down, and decided that their relative secret identities -- yet undiscussed -- probably cancelled each other out.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d prepared himself for a little warm up, knowing he hadn\u2019t given the other man much warning, only to find himself pleasantly surprised. Clark was rock hard against his stomach, his cock a long bulge that nearly sprung out the top of his boxers, precome already darkening the fabric.\u00a0\nImpressive. Bruce whistled his surprise softly, getting an aggrieved sound from Clark above him.\u00a0\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he said, ghosting a breath over the damp underwear. The other man twisted, a low keening noise escaping him. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nBruce rolled his underwear down, letting Clark\u2019s cock spring free. He made sure to lock eyes with the reporter, asking one final time for permission.\u00a0\nThe other man nodded, looking dazed. He was still breathing heavily, looking absolutely floored by what was about to happen.\u00a0\nBruce wondered about the last time Clark had let someone do this for him. It had to have been a while, considering how desperate he seemed, halfway to coming without even being touched.\u00a0\n So sensitive, he recalled, leaning forward. With a slow, agonizing pace, he swallowed the other man down to the root, throat working gently around him in tantalizing contractions.\u00a0\nClark made a muffled sound, like he\u2019d been punched, and let his head fall back, hitting the wall with a soft  thunk.\u00a0 \nBruce smiled around the cock in his mouth, slowly working it up and down, twisting his tongue around the head as he did. His lips strained slightly around the girth, so he made each move up and down  count.\nClark groaned as he sped up, his cock slamming into the back of his throat with every stroke. Bruce kept a tight hold on his gag reflex, smirking internally as he felt the other man\u2019s hips twitch against him.\u00a0\nHe pulled off with a  pop,  licking his lips. Above him, Clark looked absolutely  wrecked, blinking slowly as he processed the sudden halt.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can fuck my throat as hard as you like,\u201d he growled up at the reporter, \u201cbut you have to stay  quiet.\u201d\nClark\u2019s cock twitched at the words, growing impossibly harder in his hand. With a pointed look, Bruce took him into his mouth again, restarting with a pace that left the other man with little time to brace himself.\u00a0\nHe felt his amusement grow as Clark still held back, clearly worried about hurting him.  So goddamned polite\u2026 \nWith a hidden smirk, he reached his other hand between the reporter\u2019s legs, finding his perineum and  pressing down suddenly.\u00a0\nAbove him, something shattered, the pieces sprinkling down as Clark grabbed Bruce\u2019s hair with a shout, fucking deeply into his throat and coming in short, furious spurts that left him trembling.\nBruce swallowed obligingly, wincing internally. There was no way someone didn\u2019t hear that.\u00a0\nSure enough, just as he\u2019d coaxed a gasping Clark back into his pants, the closet door flew open, revealing two guards.\u00a0\nFrom his position on the floor -- still kneeling and flushed, covered in what looked like the pieces of a mop -- Bruce gave a casual wave.\u00a0\n\u201cHey boys!\u201d\nClark\u2019s face was burning in embarrassment as they were led down the hallway.\u00a0\nTo be fair, it had been burning on and off ever since he\u2019d run into Bruce Wayne -- just  Bruce, now, and how weird was that? -- but he was certain he was the reddest he\u2019d ever been in his entire life.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d also been the  hardest he\u2019d ever felt in his life, which was the cause of their current predicament.\u00a0\nTo his relief, they weren\u2019t taken back to the room they\u2019d woken up in. Instead, the guards took them to what looked like the main hub for their operation, full of computers, schematics, and a few corkboards with photos pinned to them, connected by red string.\u00a0\nThe sheer clich\u00e9 of the moment nearly overwhelmed him, and he let out a slightly-strangled chuckle. For some reason, Bruce turned toward him, and they shared a similar look:  what the fuck are these idiots doing.\u00a0 \nAt the front of one of the tables stood the man Clark suspected of being the ringleader in the bathroom extraction, mask finally off. He was older, grey in the temples and clearly displeased.\u00a0\n\u201cYou let them escape?\u201d he asked the two guards.\u00a0\n\u201cI have no idea how they got out of the zipties, sir,\u201d one of the guards said, looking nervous. \u201cWe found them in the hallway closet\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed off, to Clark\u2019s relief, feeling his face heat up.\u00a0\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d the leader said, \u201cI needed Wayne anyway. Might as well interrogate them here.\u201d\nClark glanced at Bruce, his worry spiking. The other man seemed to be... thinking? Or something close to it. Maybe he was just tired from their previous activities.\u00a0\nThe leader approached, stopping in front of the billionaire. \u201cMr. Wayne?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Bruce responded pleasantly, if a little distant.\u00a0\n\u201cI need the passcode to your phone. Don\u2019t make me  ask again.\u201d\nClark felt his eyes begin to burn, fists clenching at his sides. He remembered exactly how they\u2019d  asked  last time. It had left Bruce beaten half to death, drugged and  alone.\u00a0 \n\u201cI already told you. I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Bruce said, shrugging. \u201cI have too many phones.\u201d\n\u201cOh, for--\u201d the older man cut himself off, unholstering his gun and pressing it against Bruce\u2019s forehead. \u201cTell me what it is!\u201d\u00a0 \nClark\u2019s stomach plummeted as he watched the man\u2019s finger, hovering slightly over the trigger. Was he fast enough to get in between them if he chose to fire? He couldn\u2019t breathe, focused intensely on the way the muzzle pressed against the billionaire\u2019s skin.\u00a0\nBruce, unphased by the gun, shrugged again. He smiled up at their captor. \u201cI guess I could try.\u201d\nThe man dropped the gun, gesturing at one of the guards, and Clark could breathe again, chest unfreezing.\u00a0\nThey needed to get out of here --  quickly. \nSo far, Bruce\u2019s backup plan was going well.\u00a0\nBarring the brief moment Kent\u2019s eyes had flashed red, which he was certain no one had noticed but him, they\u2019d managed to get into the room with the phone and their central computer setup.\u00a0\nBut their captors were still in the room with them. And that made plugging in the phone and getting out before it fried everything with an EMP pulse a  tad bit harder. Not impossible -- but harder.\u00a0\nHis dummy phone was shoved unceremoniously into his hands, clearly still unopened.  God,  but these criminals were stupid. Jason would be  smothering him with the \u201cI told you so\u2019s\u201d when he returned to the Manor.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d really had higher hopes. Ah well. Maybe a dumber approach  was the solution, after all.\u00a0\nFor a moment, Bruce fiddled with the phone, drawing up one of the failsafe screens he\u2019d left, pretending to try and enter his passcode.\u00a0\n\u201cOh crap,\u201d he said, letting a hint of uncertainty thread through his voice. \u201cIt says I need to...update? Before I can open it again.\u201d\nThe older man -- Dominic Cass, if his intel wasn\u2019t mistaken -- frowned, glancing down at the phone. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt says I need to plug it in and let it update.\u201d He showed him the screen, keeping the innocent expression firmly on his face. \u201cSee?\u201d\nHe saw the gun whipping toward him and sighed internally, knowing he had to let the hit land. The gun caught him across the temple, slamming his head to the side.\u00a0\n\u201cSo plug it  in!\u201d \nA few feet away, Clark looked about ready to burst. He could see the red in his eyes starting again, and shifted their timetable up a few minutes. One of them had to get out of here with a little plausible deniability, and it wasn\u2019t going to be him, it seemed.\u00a0\n Whatever can\u2019t be explained by eccentricity isn\u2019t worth explaining, Alfred said in his mind. Bruce smiled to himself, tasting the bitter iron of blood again. Wise words indeed.\u00a0\nKent seemed gullible enough. It might work.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you have a cord?\u201d he asked their captor pleasantly. A second later, one of the guards handed him one, looking slightly sheepish. \u201cLovely. Thank you.\u201d\nHe crossed toward the computer, Dominic watching him, and plugged the phone into the main PC he could see. They had about two minutes, now.\u00a0\n\n Plenty of time.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cDid you know that a few years ago, I was thinking about buying a warehouse too?\u201d he asked the group. \u201cIt was going to be renovated into apartments. I always loved that industrial feel. Something about the old bricks.\u201d\nIn the ensuing silence, Clark finally obliged him. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know that, Mr. Wayne.\u201d\nBruce checked his watch, humming to himself. \u201cI thought I told you to call me Bruce.\u201d\n\u201cR-right. Of cour--\u201d\nBefore Kent could finish that thought, he was leaping into action, grabbing the barrel of Dominic\u2019s gun and slamming his fist into the man\u2019s unprotected elbow. With a howl, Dominic dropped the gun entirely, cradling his dislocated joint.\u00a0\nBruce wasted no time, dispatching the older man with a brutal kick to the temple, then catching a blow on his forearm from behind before he could remember he wasn\u2019t wearing armor.\u00a0\nThe two guards circled him, fists up. Bruce almost laughed.\u00a0\nA quick jab, a few kicks, and one somewhat show-offy flip later, the two men were down on the floor, out cold. Just on time, the desktop  pinged, signaling the start of his program.\u00a0\n\u201cTime to get out of here,\u201d he said to a gaping Kent, grabbing his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nWordlessly, Kent followed him into the hallway and out toward the doors, never questioning how he knew the right way. He was probably still in shock.\u00a0\nThey got out into the parking lot and Bruce paused, finally catching his breath. If Alfred wasn\u2019t already on his way, then the program activating would make sure he was.\u00a0\n\u201cHow-- how  did you--with--\u201d Kent babbled, wide-eyed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do that  before!\u201d \nNow it was Bruce\u2019s time to flounder for an answer.\u00a0\n\u201cThey, uh, took me by surprise,\u201d he mumbled, letting his head dip in faux embarrassment. \u201cAnd I was...scared.\u201d\nKent raised an eyebrow, clearly not buying that. \u201cThat didn\u2019t look like you were scared to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve only had a few lessons,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cI have this personal trainer shipped in from Israel once a month, she\u2019s  amazing.  Teaches a blend of  krav maga  and martial arts with added Zumba and Pilates frameworks. It\u2019s quite something. Lot\u2019s of kick-dancing and Pitbull songs, really. Have you ever tried Zumba? It\u2019s  exhausting !\u201d\nHe could practically feel the way Kent\u2019s eyes glazed over.  Good.\u00a0 \n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Gal all about this exciting little misadventure,\u201d he said, smiling wide. It wasn\u2019t solely for Kent\u2019s benefit anymore -- he could see Alfred\u2019s car in the distance, a few warehouses away. \u201cAnd my prince in shining armor.\u201d\nThat got the desired effect. Kent blushed prettily, ducking his head. His eyes were a piercing blue in the low light, warm and carefully amused.\n He really needs to stop wearing glasses , Bruce thought.\nClark was still processing Bruce\u2019s explanation -- and the last thirty minutes, frankly -- when a gleaming Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of them, beeping promptly.\u00a0\nBruce grinned at the driver, waving. \u201cAlfred!\u201d\nSo it was his butler. He couldn\u2019t find it in himself to be surprised -- Wayne\u2019s minder was infamous for his caretaking responsibilities. Of course he\u2019d managed to track them down.\u00a0\nAlfred leaned out of the window, looking only mildly impressed by the debacle his ward had gotten into.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you could get in the car, sir,\u201d he said, glancing at Clark. \u201cWill Master Kent be needing a ride as well?\u201d\nBruce jumped into the backseat, rolling his own window down. He leaned out toward Clark, hanging over the glass.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, winking at Clark, \u201cMr. Kent has his own transportation back to Metropolis, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cI do?\u201d he asked, confused.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something on the  fly, Mr. Kent,\u201d Bruce said, winking again. Clark\u2019s stomach dropped as the billionaire started rolling up the window, everything around him shuddering to a halt.\u00a0\n\n He knew. He knew the whole time.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, putting a hand out. Wayne paused accordingly, another guileless smile across his face. \u201cI--\u201d\nA thousand questions swirled within him, begging to be asked. Instead, he opened his mouth and asked the dumbest one.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about your, uh, phone?\u201d he said awkwardly, \u201cI know you wanted to go back for it.\u201d\nInside the building, something began to spark, spreading across the room they\u2019d just vacated. With a muffled  boom, the power for the entire building went out, leaving them in the dark.\u00a0\nWayne glanced at his watch, humming. There was a smirk curving his lips, ever so slightly.\u00a0\n\u201cI decided I didn\u2019t need it anymore, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Kent,\u201d Alfred nodded at him, shifting into drive. Clark stood back obligingly.\u00a0\nWayne winked at him as the car started to move, grinning wickedly. \u201cCall me?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have your phone,\u201d Clark said dumbly.\u00a0\n\u201cOh dear. You\u2019re right,\u201d Wayne said, looking momentarily perplexed, \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Clark said, grinning. \u201cMr. Wayne.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Kent.\u201d\u00a0\nThe window rolled up. By the time the Rolls-Royce was out of sight, he was still smiling.\u00a0\nThe End!\u00a0"
