This is pretty much just no-scenarios generic domestic tropes loosely strung together in a pretty bog standard fic but after the novel I needed a bit of that. Also realised I haven\u2019t written any kind of proper pairing fic in years? Feeling a bit rusty.</p>\n<p>Forgot to mention last chapter because sleepy, but special thanks to the marvellous Mythril this fic wouldn\u2019t exist without her prodding and ideas and encouragement and feedback.</p>\n<p>Trashtober still going can't stop won't stop why do I create made up challenges for myself why am I stupid.</p>\n<p>Anyway here's Yoo Mia.</p>\n<p>I think what I really wanted in my heart was just to write some bog generic sick and drunk fic and all the rest here is the excuse.</p>\n<p>Cutting it increasingly close on my daily challenge as I frantically try to edit chapters to be readable after work.</p>\n<p>This chapter definitely needs more work but oh well! I release it into the wild anyway.</p>\n<p>Again extra special thanks to Mythril for this chapter specifically! Anything good in this fic is definitely thanks to them.</p>\n<p>Is the ending abrupt? Maybe a little, because I can\u2019t be trusted to linger without introducing angst to this fluff fic. It took a lot of determination! Anyway thank you for reading my brain garbage.</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\nThere was a strange man standing outside of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s apartment.\nHe pulled out his phone, prepared to dial the police, and approached slowly. The man was fumbling in his pockets, a grocery bag from the nearby convenience store hanging awkwardly in the crook of his elbow. He hadn\u2019t noticed he was being watched yet as he cursed softly.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said.\nThe man jumped, startled, and glanced over at him. He tensed, shoulders hunching, but only dipped his head in a slight greeting, and returned to digging through his pockets.\nYoo Joonghyuk frowned. \u201cHey,\u201d he said again.\nThe man glanced back at him. He looked like a standard salaryman, thin and rumpled from the day\u2019s work, with pale skin and plain black hair and dark eyes an odd shade that made them look almost grey. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked, not quite so much nervous as wary. After a moment, he blinked, and glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s door. \u201cOh, uh, I didn\u2019t realise. I\u2019ll get out of your way. Sorry, just, I can\u2019t find my phone.\u201d He took a few steps away, towards the end of the hallway.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing here?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk threatened.\n\u201cWhat do I- I live here? I\u2019m your neighbour. Have been for\u2026\u201d He squinted, peering into the middle distance. \u201cMaybe five months?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk stared. His neighbours were a middle-aged couple who thankfully didn\u2019t know the first thing about games or streaming, and had an adult son who was away on military service for another year. He glanced towards their door.\nThe man shook his head, exasperated. \u201cNo, not them. Your other neighbour.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other neighbours.\u201d\n\u201cUh, you do though. You have me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s brow creased. \u201cWell, I guess we haven\u2019t been properly introduced. I\u2019m Kim Dokja.\u201d\n\u201cOnly child?\u201d\nHis shoulders drooped and he sighed heavily. \u201cYes, but\u2026 never mind.\u201d He returned to digging through his pockets, before finally retrieving a phone, sighing with relief.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk growled, stepping closer. \u201cAnd tell me who are you already.\u201d\n\u201cWhat- I told you! Your neighbour, Kim Dokja!\u201d He pointed at the door at the end of the hall, a few steps away. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He stalked over to the door, shielded the number pad with his hand as he entered the keycode, jiggled the doorknob a few times, pushed his shoulder against it, then the door swung open.\nYoo Joonghyuk stared. He\u2019d always assumed that door led to a janitor\u2019s closet, or some kind of storage. It didn\u2019t match any of the other doors on the third floor, didn\u2019t have a nameplate, didn\u2019t have a doorbell with a camera and intercom. Did the apartment even have windows? Based on the layout of his apartment, it couldn\u2019t even stretch the whole length of the building \u2013 Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s bedroom was a corner one, with both north and west facing windows. \u201cIs that even big enough to live in?\u201d\nKim Dokja hunched his shoulders. His voice came through stronger now \u2013 indignation stripping away his earlier shyness. \u201cExcuse me for not being able to afford to live in a palace? This isn\u2019t a cheap neighbourhood, you know? It\u2019s good enough to sleep in. It doesn\u2019t leak, and it has security, and electricity, and running water.\u201d\nThat was an alarmingly basic list of living requirements.\nStill, his suspicion began to cool. Kim Dokja, it seemed, really was his neighbour, and not some suspicious loitering fan trying to stalk him or break in or install hidden cameras. Yoo Joonghyuk hadn\u2019t had much to do with the building\u2019s landlord past the initial lease signing, but Gong Pildu struck him as the kind of man who would wring every cent of value out his land. On reflection, it wasn\u2019t surprising that he might take any shred of unused space on the building\u2019s floor plans and find some way to get rent out of it.\n\u201cFine. Don\u2019t cause any trouble,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk finally settled on.\nKim Dokja sputtered. \u201cExcuse me? You\u2019re telling me this now? I\u2019ve been here five months without causing trouble! You didn\u2019t even know I lived here! Ah, forget it,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019d say it was nice to meet you, Yoo Joonghyuk, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI never told you my name.\u201d\nKim Dokja scowled. \u201cYou\u2019re famous? Sue me for recognising your stupidly perfect face. You know you\u2019re on billboards, right?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk glared at him. \u2018Stupidly perfect?\u2019\nThe other man huffed, stepping across his threshold. \u201cExcuse me, then,\u201d he declared with false politeness so thick as to be sarcastic, and rudely slammed the door shut behind him.\nAnnoying. Yoo Joonghyuk turned back to his own door. Still, as far as meeting people who recognised him went, especially for a neighbour, Kim Dokja\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t the worst one.\nBesides, they\u2019d somehow gone without meeting for five months. The chances of him coming across Kim Dokja again with any regularity were vanishingly small. There was no more point wasting time thinking about it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk saw Kim Dokja again less than a week later.\nYoo Mia wanted cookies. Specifically, rather than the much superior cookies Yoo Joonghyuk had made that weekend, she wanted a store-bought brand that was running some promotion with free phone charms that was apparently all the rage at her school currently, so she could trade with her friends.\nYoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t really understand the appeal, but she\u2019d brought home a good report card that day, so after dinner he slipped on a plain black hoodie and a facemask, then headed out to go to the nearest convenience store. He didn\u2019t usually bother going to it, because he did all the shopping he needed at the grocery store, but it wasn\u2019t worth the longer walk for a single pack of cookies.\nHe stepped inside, and the first thing he saw under the harsh, flickering fluorescent lights was Kim Dokja staring at a row of discounted kimbap like they held all the secrets of the universe.\nIt was in the same aisle as the snacks. Yoo Joonghyuk glared, but shouldered past anyway. Kim Dokja didn\u2019t even react at first beyond a brief irritated glance, which quickly turned into a double take when he saw who was responsible. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk\u2019s gaze darted to the cashier, who luckily hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cShut up.\u201d\nKim Dokja followed his line of thought a moment later. \u201cOh.\u201d For a moment, Yoo Joonghyuk was sure that was to be the end of it. But Kim Dokja glanced between him and the cashier several times, as though debating whether to say anything.\n\u201cWhat is it? Spit it out,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk ordered, when it looked like the man was about to settle on minding his own business after all.\nKim Dokja flinched at his tone, but seemed to find his courage a moment later. \u201cJust, do you really think they won\u2019t recognise you when you checkout? That\u2019s not exactly much of a disguise.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been enough everywhere else,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk grumbled. In fact, he was a little surprised Kim Dokja had recognised him with one glance \u2013 he usually only got spotted by ardent fans, at which point he generally didn\u2019t return to those stores again. He perused the row of sweets, and finally found the right pack of cookies.\n\u201cRight. Sure. Of course. But, just entertain me here, have you looked at the posters behind the counter right now?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk looked.\nBlazoned on a 2-metre-tall poster behind the counter was his face, staring at the camera, with electric green lightning in the background and cans of energy drink in the foreground. It was repeated again on the smaller placards above the drink fridges, and again in an A4-sized flyer on the shop window.\nHe didn\u2019t even remember that campaign. That was to say, he remembered doing the product placement on one of his streams, and getting paid for it, and at some point attending a photo session, but he left the particulars to his agent in the management company he paid to handle his PR and accounts. Shit.\nHe considered his odds. Was there any chance the cashier still wouldn\u2019t recognise him if they spent half their shift staring at his face?\nIt wasn\u2019t worth it. He moved to put the cookies back, when Kim Dokja caught his hand. It was hard to tell who was more surprised by the gesture.\n\u201cUm- I\u2019ll check it out for you. Is it just this? Also, you\u2019re paying for it, just so we\u2019re clear,\u201d he muttered. Before Yoo Joonghyuk could protest, Kim Dokja snatched the cookies and shuffled to the counter with them and his three kimbap.\nYoo Joonghyuk checked his hoodie and mask were secure and moved outside, head down. It was paranoid, maybe, but he\u2019d had enough annoying run ins with fans that he didn\u2019t want to chance it \u2013 especially not somewhere so close to home.\nKim Dokja followed him out a moment later, bag on his arm. He fished out the cookies. \u201c2600 won,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was 2200,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, and handed over a 5000 won note. It was the smallest he had.\n\u201cOh was it? My mistake,\u201d Kim Dokja said, opening his wallet and slipping the note in.\nYoo Joonghyuk eyed the rest of the contents of the plastic bag hanging on his neighbour\u2019s elbow. Three kimbap, all from the nearly expired section, discounted to 500 won each. In fact, the cookies were more than what Kim Dokja had spent on his entire dinner.\nIt had been a nice gesture by his neighbour \u2013 in any other situation Yoo Joonghyuk wouldn\u2019t have even asked. But the sheer irritation Kim Dokja inspired in him had him flatly demanding, \u201cChange.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re real cheap, you know that?\u201d Kim Dokja dropped a few coins into his hand.\nYoo Joonghyuk checked it, and his eyebrow twitched. \u201cCan you not do the math? 2800 won.\u201d\n\u201cNot even a service fee? It\u2019s only a few extra won,\u201d he wheedled. This guy \u2013 that timid and withdrawn aura suddenly disappeared when a bit of money was involved?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to. You decided on your own. And that\u2019s more than double what it cost in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the exact right change-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk snatched his wallet from his hand. Kim Dokja squawked, and made to grab it back, but Yoo Joonghyuk was both taller and quicker, twisting to block him with his shoulder. He counted out the coins and snapped the wallet closed again. \u201c2800 won,\u201d he repeated, showing the coins in his hand, and slipping them into his pocket. He shoved the wallet back into Kim Dokja\u2019s chest \u2013 the other man stumbling back with the force of it.\n\u201cYou jerk! Hey! See if I ever do you a favour again!\u201d Kim Dokja complained.\nYoo Joonghyuk ignored him, turning to head home, cookies in hand.\nOf course, Yoo Joonghyuk had forgotten \u2013 they were neighbours, which meant they were walking home to the same place. Kim Dokja caught back up with him in moments, ambling along next to him, venting his displeasure.\n\u201cI wonder what the internet would say if they knew how cheap you are. And how violent. I was going to give you the change anyway, I was just messing with you.\u201d The man nattered on like a con artist. \u201cI could make the money back other ways, anyway, and it would serve you right. How much do you think your fans would pay to know your address- Urk!\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk had wheeled on him, grabbing his shirt, glowering. Kim Dokja held up his hands in defence, frantically waving. \u201cKidding, kidding! I\u2019m your neighbour, remember? I don\u2019t want hordes of your crazy fans breaking into our building any more than you do!\u201d\nSuspicious, Yoo Joonghyuk relaxed his grip, then a moment later let go. Kim Dokja smoothed his shirt down, and remained blissfully silent for the rest of the walk home.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnnoyingly, after that encounter, Yoo Joonghyuk seemed to run into Kim Dokja everywhere. He\u2019d go to drop off his garbage, and cross paths with his neighbour coming home from work. He\u2019d leave his apartment in the morning to go for a jog, and Kim Dokja would be running to the subway. He went to his grocery store one Sunday, and Kim Dokja was there, dressed in an oversized white t-shirt and loose dark blue cardigan and jeans. It was the first time Yoo Joonghyuk had seen him in anything other than his work clothes. His eyes followed the exposed curve of his collarbone, to the nape of his neck, to his fake polite smile, and he was abruptly irritated.\nHe loomed over him. \u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk demanded.\nKim Dokja backed up against the shelf of instant noodles to match his glare better. \u201cUm, excuse me? This is the grocery store closest to my apartment? Do we really need to do this again?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you here before.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you see anything? You don\u2019t exactly look around when you\u2019re trying to be incognito. Actually, aren\u2019t you worried about that here? Sorry, but I don\u2019t have enough money to buy your huge basket of groceries. Unless you wanna pay a service fee this time?\u201d\n\u201cUnnecessary. I\u2019ve been coming here for a long time.\u201d The staff all seemed to be perilously close to retirement, and even the one or two who recognised him had treated it with the same sort of dull excitement and confusion as someone they recognised from a toothpaste commercial. And avoiding the notice of other customers was easy enough, so long as he didn\u2019t shop in the busiest periods. Yoo Joonghyuk was famous, but he wasn\u2019t a household name.\nKim Dokja had a point though, so he backed up, then glanced at the shabby contents of his neighbour\u2019s basket. Instant noodles, eggs, rice, and nothing else. \u201cWhat kind of bachelor\u2019s shopping list is this? Are you trying to die of scurvy?\u201d\n\u201cIs that any of your business? I don\u2019t exactly have time to cook, you know? And who are you calling a bachelor, huh? That\u2019s awfully presumptuous.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d\nKim Dokja swelled up, squaring his shoulders, and Yoo Joonghyuk was immediately certain that the next words out of his mouth were going to be a lie. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I-\u201d He caught sight of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s dubious expression, and seemed to deflate before his eyes. \u201cOkay, fine, I am, but that\u2019s not any of your business either, you know? So what if I\u2019m alone.\u201d There was an edge to the words that made Yoo Joonghyuk wonder if he\u2019d just stepped on a landmine. Kim Dokja barrelled on regardless, as though he could cover up the awkwardness by burying it with more words. \u201cAnd it\u2019s rude to just assume. Not all of us are famous pro gamers you know, we can\u2019t all have beautiful girlfriends-\u201d\n\u201cI am too,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk cut in, reflexively, then frowned. He hadn\u2019t intended to share that, but then, they were neighbours, so it wasn\u2019t like Kim Dokja wouldn\u2019t notice eventually.\nHis neighbour blinked dumbly at him, eyes dark and wide. \u201cHuh?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk pointed at his basket. \u201cI\u2019m single too, but you don\u2019t see me shopping like that. Buy some vegetables, fool.\u201d\nIt broke the odd spell. Kim Dokja huffed, stalked over to the refrigerators, and grabbed a tub of the cheapest kimchi. \u201cThere, are you happy? I won\u2019t die of scurvy.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk scoffed, and went back to his own shopping. \u201cIdiot bastard.\u201d\n\u201cHey! Who are you calling a bastard? You stupid sunfish!\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of insult is that?\u201d\n\u201cOne that suits you. It\u2019s the stupidest animal I can think of. Ah, but it\u2019s much more handsome than you are, so it\u2019s really a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cYou called my face perfect before.\u201d\nUnexpectedly, Kim Dokja flushed. The red ran all the way down his neck and lit up his ears. \u201cPerfectly stupid.\u201d He scowled, and stalked past. \u201cThis is my precious day off. I don\u2019t have time to be talking to you.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the same place,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk reminded him.\nIt was too late, though \u2013 Kim Dokja had fled to the checkouts, and Yoo Joonghyuk hadn\u2019t finished shopping. By the time he had, and returned to his apartment, the door at the end of the hall was already firmly shut.\nThat was what he\u2019d wanted in the first place, he told himself. But he was still irrationally bothered.\nKim Dokja was annoying.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYoo Joonghyuk-nim, what about this one? Are you sure you don\u2019t want anything else?\u201d Some pompous executive was boisterously pushing another bottle in his face. In front of him sat an array of untouched appetisers. Next to him, his agent hurried to intercept.\n\u201cAh, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim is a competitor, you understand, like many professional athletes he is very particular about what he drinks and eats-\u201d\n\u201cOh is that so, very admirable! I suppose such talent does require some sacrifices after all, hahaha! What a shame though, it doesn\u2019t seem like much fun! Please though, order anything that you feel like!\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk ignored him. \u201cBathroom,\u201d he said, excusing himself.\n\u201cOh, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, I can show you where-\u201d\n\u201cUnnecessary,\u201d he interrupted, and stepped out of the room before anyone else could latch on.\nAt least fans he ran into in public would normally stop at bothering him for a picture. Fans working for companies he did sponsorship deals or paid promotions with always seemed to think that gave them the right to be extra annoying. He already regretted going along with this. The deal was signed \u2013 this was just a bothersome waste of time, a formality and social obligation that his agent had somehow convinced him was important.\nHe visited the washroom, taking his time and enjoying the moment of privacy. It wasn\u2019t until he left it, heading back to the group, that he spotted the ongoing thorn in the side of his life.\n\u201cKim Dokja?\u201d\nThe man in question stopped in the hallway. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk?\u201d he glanced around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my question,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk growled, stepping close, until he was backing the shady bastard against the wall. See him run away this time. \u201cYou are stalking me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat- me? Aren\u2019t you the stalker here?\u201d Kim Dokja sputtered. \u201cI don\u2019t even want be here. I\u2019m normally home by now.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cWait, you\u2019re not normally out either. Don\u2019t you live with your little sister?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s at a friend\u2019s,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said. He stared at him, at his loosened tie, and flushed cheeks, and started putting the pieces together. \u201cYou work for Minosoft?\u201d\n\u201cYes? How do you-\u201d Kim Dokja finally caught on. \u201cYou\u2019re the bigwig streamer they signed to do the promotion?\u201d\n\u201cYou really didn\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on contract! I\u2019m basically a glorified intern for the QA department. You think anyone tells me what goes on in this company?\u201d He grumbled, and loosened his tie further. \u201cSo they forced you into this stupid drinking party too huh? Even famous pro gamers can\u2019t get out of these sorts of things. Ah, but you\u2019re a celebrity, so they\u2019re probably all fawning over you. They put you in the VIP room, after all. The rest of us aren\u2019t even allowed in there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if they just watched me play,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk admitted.\nKim Dokja stared. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? You compete in front of thousands of people but you secretly hate attention? Ah, but I should have guessed. You always dress like a criminal when you\u2019re out, instead of like\u2026 like a graphics card box.\u201d He gestured vaguely at the black and electric green zip up sweater Yoo Joonghyuk was wearing \u2013 the same one he wore on stream, and any other official business.\nYoo Joonghyuk folded his arms. \u201cTechnically, the box was designed after my brand.\u201d\nKim Dokja blinked slowly at him, then suddenly broke into a smile \u2013 a genuine one, and it was startling to realise it was the first time he\u2019d seen it, the way it lit up his whole face and made his eyes sparkle like stars. \u201cHah! Haha! I didn\u2019t even- I was just making a joke, I didn\u2019t realise there was actually-!\u201d His words dissolved into breathless laughs. \u201cSometimes I wonder if you\u2019re even real.\u201d\nThe moment was broken by one of the other employees coming out into the hallway. \u201cAh, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, there you are \u2013 oh, Kim Dokja-ssi? Ah, he isn\u2019t bothering you, is he-?\u201d\nAs quick as it came, the Kim Dokja he\u2019d just witnessed vanished \u2013 his shoulders hunched, his eyes dulled, he seemed to become smaller. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he muttered gloomily, and slipped past, to the bathroom Yoo Joonghyuk had just come from.\nYoo Joonghyuk watched him go, perplexed and vaguely displeased. It was like, in an instant, the Kim Dokja he\u2019d become used to had vanished, and replaced with an even more standoffish, sour version of the neighbour he\u2019d first caught in front of his apartment.\nHe\u2019d seen more than one new face on Kim Dokja that night.\n\u201cSorry to rush you, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, but we were about to order mains so-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said, and turned to follow them back to the room. He\u2019d worry about it later.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe drinking party dragged on. Yoo Joonghyuk answered dozens of banal questions, glared at anyone who encroached too close on his personal space, and accepted a single bottle of beer which he proceeded to nurse for the next hour and a half. It was the absolute bare minimum necessary to not completely alienate everyone in the room, but the more the beer and soju flowed the less anyone cared about manners or propriety. He\u2019d weathered more than one drinking party or awards ceremony with strangers using the same strategy. It hadn\u2019t backfired yet.\nHe wondered what Kim Dokja was doing in the next room.\nWhich Kim Dokja was in there? Was he laughing, his whole face lit up, his shoulders loose and his tie looser as his cheeks grew rosy from alcohol? Or was he hunched and quiet in the corner fumbling to pour soju for his seniors? Or was he irreverent and talkative and shamelessly stealing food off other people\u2019s plates right in front of them?\nHe could picture all three. All versions would be more interesting than listening to his agent telling the same story about one of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s tournament wins for the twentieth time.\nIt had been long enough, he decided. Everyone was jovial, and distracted, and the food was mostly finished. Yoo Joonghyuk knocked back the last dregs of his long-lukewarm beer, and stood to leave. \u201cI have to head out. Early start tomorrow.\u201d It was a lie, but a socially acceptable one.\n\u201cOn a weekend? Pro gamers have it rough, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\u201cAh, Yoo Joonghyuk-nim, before you go, if you could sign this-\u201d\n\u201cJust one photo with everyone! For the company newsletter!\u201d\nHe bore the circus with forced patience, until his agent finally took pity on him and intervened, and he at last managed to slip out of the room without anyone trying to follow. Once in the hallway, he hesitated, then impulsively turned towards the other raucous room at the back.\nThey lived in the same building. It only made sense to share a cab home with Kim Dokja. If he didn\u2019t at least offer, his annoying neighbour would probably endlessly complain about it the next time they crossed paths.\nHe didn\u2019t even make it there though \u2013 the door opened as he approached, and one of the wait staff \u2013 a woman wearing slacks and white shirt with an apron, black hair done up in a business-like bun - was guiding the exact man he\u2019d been going to see out of the room.\n\u201cKim Dokja?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked. It hadn\u2019t even been two hours, and the man looked absolutely wrecked. The woman was half-supporting him as he lurched out of the room. He stepped forward to take him from her. \u201cHere, I\u2019ve got him.\u201d\nShe eyed him judgingly. \u201cDokja-ssi, do you know this man?\u201d\nHe raised his head from where he was focusing extremely hard on his feet and squinted at him. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk? But I\u2019m at work, what\u2019re you doing here-\u201d\n\u201cWe already went over this. I came to get you. We\u2019re sharing a cab back.\u201d Seeing the other man\u2019s state had changed it from a question to an order.\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford a cab, \u2018m going to catch the subway-\u201d\n\u201cAs though you\u2019d pay for the cab anyway,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk scoffed.\n\u201cAh, you do know him,\u201d the woman decided, and all but shoved him into Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s arms.\nKim Dokja stumbled forward, crashing into his chest, and then slowly started to sink. \u201cWow your chest is r\u2019ly firm,\u201d he mumbled, muffled, into the fabric of his sweater.\nYoo Joonghyuk grabbed his arm and dragged it over his shoulder \u2013 half holding him up, half helping him keep his balance. \u201cHe\u2019s not real, you know,\u201d Kim Dokja told the woman from his new position. She just seemed amused as she watched them. \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\u201cSure, Dokja-ssi.\u201d To Yoo Joonghyuk, she said, \u201cYou take proper care of this guy, okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked. He\u2019d assumed from her clothes that she worked for the establishment, but she seemed too familiar with him.\n\u201cTch, he helped me out once with a customer that was getting a little too bold. His company are regulars here, but he\u2019s an anti-social idiot who usually sneaks out of these things early. I\u2019d get him out of here myself, but I\u2019ve still got work, and he seems to actually like you, so you\u2019ll have to do instead.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t know where she got that from, but he grunted in acknowledgement, adjusted his grip, and started steering them for the door.\nKim Dokja suddenly struggled against him though, reaching out to catch the woman\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHeewon-ssi \u2013 you\u2019ll make sure-\u201d\n\u201cI would anyway,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. Worry about yourself, idiot.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk half-led, half-dragged his stumbling neighbour to the exit. \u201cWalk properly,\u201d he grunted.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m sorry. Can\u2019t even do one thing right-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk. You fool. How did you even let it get this far at a work party? Don\u2019t you know how to hold your drink?\u201d\n\u201cDepartment Head Han is a creep. He was trying to get Yoo Sangah-ssi drunk,\u201d Kim Dokja slurred. \u201cAnd- and all the other guys too. Vultures.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your solution was\u2026 to drink all of her drinks instead?\u201d\n\u201cDrink \u2018em under the table,\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled into his shoulder. \u201cThey can\u2019t try shit then.\u201d\n\u201cThe only one who\u2019s been drunk under the table here is you.\u201d He adjusted his grip around Kim Dokja\u2019s waist, and the other man leaned his weight against him, a bulwark of unnatural warmth.\n\u201cYoo Sangah-ssi shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that,\u201d he muttered, then raised his head and tried to poke at Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s cheek and missed completely. \u201cHow did- How did your thing go, though? You\u2019re not even\u2026 ah don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re such a cool guy you can even hold your drink like a pro?\u201d\n\u201cI only had one beer.\u201d\n\u201cThey let you get away with that?\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s shock was outsized, and he stumbled. Yoo Joonghyuk grunted, bearing the extra weight. \u201cAhhh, when you\u2019re beautiful and famous and rich it\u2019s not weird or anti-social, it just makes you eccentric. Unfair. When I try not to drink I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d His words melted into mumbles.\n\u201cKim Dokja, shut up,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said. Luckily, there were already cabs waiting out front, ready to whisk drunken patrons away. He helped his neighbour to the front one, bundling him inside, folding his legs in when he left them hanging out.\n\u201cYou shut up,\u201d Kim Dokja retorted, a full twenty seconds late. Yoo Joonghyuk ignored him, slamming the door shut and moving around to the other side. He got in, gave the driver their address, then took the seatbelt Kim Dokja was blindly stabbing into the seat and clicked it into the buckle. \u201cI had it!\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe other man folded his arms in a sulk. Yoo Joonghyuk, well used to Yoo Mia\u2019s sulks, ignored it like the seasoned pro he was. Still, as the bright city signs flew past, painting the car interior in rolling light and shadow, he was conscious of Kim Dokja\u2019s heavy, unrelenting gaze. He risked a glance, and met two dark, half-lidded eyes. They seemed impossibly, unfathomably deep. Like staring into an abyss.\nYoo Joonghyuk turned away, and fixed his attention firmly on the scenery outside.\nHe hated the way Kim Dokja could make him inexplicably self-conscious. It was a foreign sensation, one left behind long ago in insecure adolescence.\nAt some point, that heavy gaze finally drifted away. Ten long minutes passed peacefully, and the peculiar tension began to ease from Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s shoulders. The car was quiet but for the rumble of the engine, the low murmur of the radio from the front, and the erratic beep of the cab\u2019s price meter. Thankfully, the driver didn\u2019t try for conversation.\nStill, it was surprising for Kim Dokja to stay silent for so long. When Yoo Joonghyuk finally glanced back over, he had the answer why \u2013 his eyes were closed, his head turned and resting against the car seat, mouth very slightly open. He\u2019d fallen asleep.\nKim Dokja had shown him a third new face that night. His eyelashes brushing his still-rosy cheeks, his expression the most relaxed he\u2019d ever seen it, the long slow fall and rise of his chest, his pale fingers curled loosely in his lap around his phone.\nYoo Joonghyuk stared. This annoying neighbour \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t glaring, or making those insincere smiles, he wasn\u2019t such an ugly guy.\n\u201cIs this it?\u201d The cab driver\u2019s voice shattered the moment, and Yoo Joonghyuk tore his gaze away. They were pulling up in front of their shared apartment building. It was late, and the foyer was dark.\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d he confirmed, then turned back to his seatmate. \u201cKim Dokja. Wake up.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t stir.\nYoo Joonghyuk reached out, and shook him by the shoulder. This time, Kim Dokja grunted, and opened his eyes a sliver. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Get out.\u201d\nKim Dokja stared at him for a long moment, but fumbled for the door. By the time Yoo Joonghyuk had paid the driver and headed to the other side of the car, all he\u2019d managed to do was open it. Yoo Joonghyuk sighed, reached in, grabbed his arm, and hauled him to his feet.\n\u201cYou got him? He\u2019s about done, I think,\u201d the cab driver noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He shut the door and dragged his uncooperative cargo to the sidewalk.\nThe dismissal was enough, and the car peeled off back into the night. Yoo Joonghyuk was left standing under the streetlights with Kim Dokja sagging against his side, seemingly doing his very best to fall asleep standing up. He\u2019d hoped the cab ride would give him some time to sober up, but instead it seemed they were both the losers of that race.\n\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d he said.\n\u201c\u2019m sorry. I need\u2026 a minute.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk wasn\u2019t interested in standing out in the cold night air for a drunk man\u2019s definition of a minute. He sighed, and with a little effort, hoisted Kim Dokja onto his back.\n\u201cWha- Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you want to be left in the gutter? Shut up, Kim Dokja.\u201d His neighbour was surprisingly light \u2013 it wasn\u2019t effortless, but it would be easy enough to carry him that short distance to their doors.\nWhatever protests the other man might have had were evidently quickly given up on. He clutched ineffectively at Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s sweater with one arm, fingers dragging at the fabric, the other hanging uselessly limp. Yoo Joonghyuk wound up half-shifting his weight to accommodate, and a moment later, his neighbour\u2019s head dropped onto his shoulder, his hair tickling his ear and his breath faintly warm against his neck.\nStoically, Yoo Joonghyuk swiped his access card, and the foyer doors unlocked and automatically whirred open. \u201cIf you throw up on my sweater, I\u2019m sending you the bill,\u201d he warned.\nKim Dokja just mumbled in response. It sounded a lot like \u2018sunfish bastard\u2019.\nThe short ride in the elevator and the walk to the end of the third-floor hall seemed to last forever. Yoo Joonghyuk determinedly plodded past his doorway and came to a stop in front of his neighbour\u2019s.\n\u201cKim Dokja. What\u2019s your room code?\u201d\n\u201cHnnnn?\u201d\n\u201cYour room code,\u201d he repeated louder.\n\u201cAh\u2026. 9158.\u201d\n\u201cHash or star?\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019ar.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk entered it. The lock beeped. The handle jammed, and the door stuck on the frame, but with sheer force he was able to push it open.\nIt took some staggering and fumbling before he found a light switch \u2013 Kim Dokja, of course, was no help, beyond some incoherent mumbling and vague hand gestures. The small space filled with dim yellow light.\nIt was his first time inside Kim Dokja\u2019s bizarre apartment.\nGiven his personality, and his bachelorhood, he\u2019d expected a pigsty, or at least a room crammed full of mess, with every spare surface used.\nInstead, it was astoundingly clean. There wasn\u2019t even the expected layer of dust in the corners.\nMore than that, though, it was eerily empty.\nIt was incredibly cramped, as expected, and from the entrance where he toed off his shoes, he could see the entire place. One step past the foyer was a narrow kitchen, just large enough for a sink, a hot plate, and a cheap travel size rice cooker. It was tidy but for a lone white mug in the sink. Just beyond that was a short hallway with a sliding door he assumed hid a closet, before it opened up into a single room. Most of that was taken up by a simple bed mat on the floor, a plain blanket folded neatly by its feet. There was a phone charger plugged into the wall, a small pile of old books and free magazines stacked in one corner, a worn backpack slumped in the other. Opposite the bed, a makeshift clothes rack hung precariously from the wall, with dress shirts and jackets and slacks lined up neatly. A cloth set of hanging draws dangled awkwardly at one end, with underwear and socks and pyjamas and t-shirts stacked and folded tidily within.\nYoo Joonghyuk knew the man was frugal, and that it was astonishingly expensive to live alone in Seoul, but this seemed a bit much. No desk, no pictures, not even a television? It felt more like a prison cell than a home.\nGranted, a contract job in the QA department at a place like Minosoft wasn\u2019t likely to pay for anything better, especially not in this part of town, but most people who had the option would live with their family until they were ready to marry. Those who didn\u2019t, mostly students or workers who\u2019d come to the city from regional areas, found roommates to share with. There were boarding houses and other solutions. So why then did Kim Dokja insist on living like this?\nIt wasn\u2019t any of his business. He crouched, letting Kim Dokja\u2019s weight slide off his back onto the bed mat. He wasn\u2019t quite unconscious, but his head rolled and his eyelashes fluttered, so Yoo Joonghyuk propped him against the wall. He unlaced the man\u2019s shoes, tugged them off, and tossed them back towards the foyer. He grabbed his tie and gently teased it the rest of the way loose, and tossed that aside too.\nHe thought he should get him a bucket, though, in case he needed to throw up. Yoo Joonghyuk headed to the cupboard, only to discover that it was in fact the bathroom \u2013 a shower cubicle so small he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d able to turn around in it, and a toilet so narrow that that toilet roll could function as an armrest.\nNo buckets were hiding in there \u2013 there wasn\u2019t room for anything. He returned to the kitchen, and eventually settled for some empty garbage bags to place in easy reach. He grabbed the mug from the sink, rinsed it and filled it with water, and padded back to where Kim Dokja was slumped against the wall.\n\u201cDrink,\u201d he ordered, kneeling down and thrusting the mug in his neighbour\u2019s face. Kim Dokja blinked blearily at it, and made a half-hearted attempt for the handle.\nYoo Joonghyuk sighed, and held the mug to his lips. \u201cDrink,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me in the morning.\u201d He stared, as Kim Dokja\u2019s pale throat worked, as a line of water escaped, running a clear track from the edge of his lips to curve down the delicate line of his chin and then neck, carefully tilting the mug until it was finally empty. He clenched his fist in the fabric of his pants for a moment, before consciously relaxing it and turning his attention back to pertinent matters. \u201cJacket off,\u201d he ordered. He rolled the jacket off his shoulders, Kim Dokja lethargically lifting his arms free of the sleeves. Yoo Joonghyuk took it as well, and then helped him lie down, being careful to turn him on his side, just in case. \u201cGo to sleep, Kim Dokja.\u201d\nHe turned, hung the jacket with the rest of the clothes, then took his neighbour\u2019s phone from the pocket and plugged it into the charger in the wall. He headed back to the kitchen in search of painkillers. Most of the cupboards were empty of anything other than rice and instant noodles, but he finally stumbled on a fully stocked first aid kit. It was barely used \u2013 when he opened it, nearly everything was still sealed in sterile packaging - but given the minimalism of everything else in the apartment it was confusing to come across.\nKim Dokja was a cautious guy, he supposed. It didn\u2019t bear much thinking about \u2013 Yoo Joonghyuk grabbed some headache tablets from it, refilled the mug, and set both next to the bed.\nThat was everything, he decided. More than he should have had to do, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t particularly like leaving a task half-finished.\nStill, he stood there for another minute more, silently staring down at Kim Dokja, splayed sleeping on the bed mat, hair tousled by his pillow, edge of his mouth still wet.\nThis quiet, strangely pliant form of his neighbour was unnerving in ways Yoo Joonghyuk couldn\u2019t articulate.\nThat peculiar tension began to seep back into his shoulders.\nHe shrugged it off, let his gaze rove once more over the narrow, empty apartment, then turned and left, closing the door quietly behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk only saw Kim Dokja once since the encounter at Minosoft\u2019s drinking party \u2013 where his neighbour had blushed, profusely apologised, then more or less ran away, though it might have simply been because he was late for work.\nThe next time he saw him properly was a Sunday. Yoo Joonghyuk had been finishing up a daytime stream while Yoo Mia was out at the park with her friend \u2013 with the plan that they would return home before dark and eat dinner together, spend the night, and leave for school together the next day.\nHe\u2019d only just finished the stream and started to move into the kitchen to start dinner prep when the sound of children\u2019s\u2019 voices echoing in the hallway caught his attention. He hadn\u2019t expected Yoo Mia to be back so early. He opened the front door, to the sight of his sister clinging to the back of a grown man, and immediately contemplated murder.\nThe man in question flinched, stepping backwards. \u201cY-Yoo Joonghyuk. Hello?\u201d He plastered a shady, nervous smile on his face.\n\u2026It was only Kim Dokja. Kim Dokja, who was red-faced and very visibly struggling under his sister\u2019s weight, though doing his utmost best to pretend otherwise.\nStill, if there wasn\u2019t a good explanation for this\u2026 \u201cMia, what are you doing?\u201d he asked.\nShe kicked her leg at him from her perch on Kim Dokja\u2019s back. \u201cI tripped and hurt my ankle, oppa. Ahjussi gave me a piggyback ride home.\u201d She sounded smug about it.\nYoo Joonghyuk felt a little sorry for Kim Dokja, then \u2013 the park was a ten-minute walk away even normally.\n\u201cIt was my fault, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Shin Yoosung was there too, peeking out from behind his neighbour\u2019s legs.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem serious, but I didn\u2019t want her walking on it,\u201d Kim Dokja offered, still looking wary. \u201cUm, should I-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk opened the door wider. \u201cBring her in.\u201d\nKim Dokja kept that fake smile plastered on his face even as he looked like he was stepping into the lion\u2019s den. Yoo Joonghyuk pointed to the couch, while he detoured back to the kitchen to fetch the first aid kit and an icepack.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too bad at all, I bet you\u2019ll be back on your feet in no time,\u201d Kim Dokja was saying as he and Yoosung helped Mia settle on the couch. \u201cThough you want to get your shoe off just in case it swells. Yoosung-ah, want to help?\u201d\nHe hung back, watching, as Kim Dokja kept both girls occupied with some story about a similar injury he suffered that even Yoo Joonghyuk could tell had been heavily edited. He only moved forward when his neighbour glanced up and caught his eye. \u201cAh, your brother will fix it properly, though, right?\u201d\n\u201cOppa is the best,\u201d Yoo Mia told him drolly. \u201cHe can carry me a lot further than that without getting tired.\u201d\nKim Dokja just laughed, and something in Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s chest stuttered. \u201cI bet he could, couldn\u2019t he?\u201d He moved aside to make room.\nYoo Joonghyuk crouched in front of her with the ice pack. As Kim Dokja said, it didn\u2019t look too bad, though it was still a little early to tell how much it might swell. He held her ankle carefully and frowned at her. He was glad, of course, that she had help, but- \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just call?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you. Plus ahjussi was there,\u201d she said with a shrug.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be accepting help from strange men,\u201d he warned.\n\u201cEhhhh, but he\u2019s our neighbour? Isn\u2019t he your friend? I hear you two talking in the hallway all the time,\u201d she complained. \u201cAnd Yoosung was with me, so it wasn\u2019t like I was alone.\u201d\nHe was surprised she even knew him, considering how long Yoo Joonghyuk had gone without noticing his neighbour. But did he really cross paths with Kim Dokja that much? He tried to remember when Yoo Mia would have ever seen them together. Sometimes they exchanged a few words when crossing paths in the hallway, but that was usually more Kim Dokja calling him a stupid sunfish and Yoo Joonghyuk criticising his poor diet, as evidenced by the quality of the trash he brought in and out of his apartment.\n\u201cYou should listen to your brother though,\u201d Kim Dokja said gently. \u201cIt was okay this time, but it\u2019s good advice in general.\u201d\nYoo Mia just rolled her eyes. \u201cObviously.\u201d She turned her attention back to her big brother imperiously. \u201cWhat are we having for dinner then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d barely started,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re back early. What did you two want?\u201d\n\u201cYoosung?\u201d Yoo Mia asked.\nShin Yoosung smiled sunnily at her. \u201cEverything your brother makes is delicious, Mia! My mother likes having you over just because he sends food with you! Oh, but I don\u2019t think I was supposed to say that\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBibimbap, then,\u201d Yoo Mia commanded.\nIt was healthy, at least. \u201cFine. Are you two hungry now?\u201d They both nodded eagerly. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat early. Hold that on your ankle until the cold is gone, then we\u2019ll wrap it. You can watch TV.\u201d He handed Shin Yoosung the remote.\nKim Dokja shifted awkwardly in place, and started edging towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be going then,\u201d he muttered.\nYoo Joonghyuk thought of Kim Dokja sitting alone in the empty apartment next door eating instant noodles while the rest of them ate dinner together, and something unpleasant turned in his gut.\nHe caught him by the back of his shirt. Kim Dokja choked, and stumbled. \u201cWha-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cAhjussi, you\u2019re staying?\u201d Shin Yoosung asked brightly. Yoo Joonghyuk could see the instant Kim Dokja\u2019s resolve to deny it broke under the girl\u2019s hopeful gaze. Kids \u2013 they latched onto anyone new who gave them the slightest bit of attention.\n\u201cI\u2026 guess?\u201d He looked entirely bewildered by this sudden turn of events. Yoo Joonghyuk took advantage of it to steer him into the kitchen and point imperiously at a cutting board, where some carrots were already waiting.\n\u201cPeel those.\u201d He let him go, and turned his attention to pulling more ingredients out of the fridge, already mentally adjusting the amounts for four.\nKim Dokja, of course, once out of eyesight of Shin Yoosung\u2019s judgement, immediately tried to escape. \u201cAh, actually, you really don\u2019t have to you know, I know you value your space-\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t peel a carrot?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked.\nKim Dokja was immediately offended. \u201cOf course I can!\u201d He picked up the peeler and got to work.\n\u201cGood. At least this way I can make sure you won\u2019t die of scurvy, fool,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk grunted.\n\u201cAre you still worried about that? I\u2019ve lived this long, Yoo Joonghyuk, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem.\u201d He laughed, again. It was his normal laugh \u2013 the one that was fake, and faintly bitter.\nMaybe Yoo Mia had a point, if he knew Kim Dokja well enough to tell the difference.\n\u201cWhat happened, in the park?\u201d he asked as he started preparing the beef.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see. I was just walking past when I saw Yoosung trying to help Mia to a park bench. I suggested she call you, actually, but your sister didn\u2019t want to interrupt your stream?\u201d He discarded the peels, and started on julienning the carrots. \u201cBut leaving sprains for too long just makes them worse, so I decided it was better that she got home quickly.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for looking out for her,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said.\nThe sound of the knife paused for a moment on the other side of the kitchen before resuming. \u201cAh, well, I owe you, you know? For the Minosoft party. I don\u2019t really remember it that well honestly so\u2026 sorry, again, for the trouble. Hopefully I didn\u2019t say anything strange?\u201d\n\u201cNothing more than the usual stupid drivel that comes out of your mouth.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cAre you still doing the carrots?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked. \u201cYou\u2019re slow.\u201d\n\u201cNothing but criticism. I\u2019m tired, okay? Your sister is\u2026 perfectly light and not heavy at all,\u201d he quickly adjusted at Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s stare, and glanced over at where he\u2019d already finished the marinade and was busy salting the zucchini. \u201cHey, what are you, a chef? Isn\u2019t it that you\u2019re the fast one?\u201d He handed over the carrots to also be salted.\nYoo Joonghyuk scoffed, casting a critical eye over his work. They were cut meticulously uniform, even by his standards. He\u2019d been worried, for a moment, about what kind of disaster Kim Dokja might be in the kitchen, given the sad contents of his grocery baskets. But it seemed the man was at least perfectly capable of following instructions, even if he went about it far too slowly. He tossed him the spinach. \u201cCut that next.\u201d\n\u201cBossy sunfish bastard,\u201d he muttered, but the kitchen fell into comfortable silence as they worked.\nDinner itself was lively, thanks mostly to Kim Dokja asking Yoo Mia questions to get blackmail on Yoo Joonghyuk, and then prodding Shin Yoosung along on a lengthy series of stories about her dog which then turned into a commentary on dog breeds in general and ended in Yoo Mia badgering Yoo Joonghyuk for a dog which he shut down hard with the reminder that their apartment complex didn\u2019t allow pets. Then somehow he was pestered into sitting in the living room to watch some fantasy adventure Yoo Joonghyuk had zero interest in, but Kim Dokja had apparently read the web novel of so was similarly ordered to stay for. They sat on opposite ends of the couch, while the girls sat on cushions on the floor.\nThe show was, as predicted, terrible. Still, watching Kim Dokja\u2019s face contort in reaction to the developments on screen was entertaining enough.\nOnce the credits started rolling, though, their guest was quick to his feet. \u201cI should get going. Thank you for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou helped make it,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk reminded him, mostly to be difficult.\nKim Dokja made a face at him. \u201cI was trying to be polite you bas- you sunfish. As always, it\u2019s wasted on you.\u201d\n\u201cBye ahjussi, come play with us next time!\u201d Yoosung called. \u201cMia, aren\u2019t you going to say bye?\u201d\n\u201cHe lives next door, he\u2019s barely going anywhere,\u201d Mia said, gaze still fixed on the TV, but gave a half-hearted wave all the same.\nKim Dokja just awkwardly nodded farewell, and darted out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWinter arrived in a blast of cold wind and icy flurries. With it came a wave of competitions, cluttering up Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s schedule and consuming his every spare moment with practice.\nWith it also came the usual ailments of winter.\nYoo Joonghyuk eyed the thermometer in his hand, and ran a gentle thumb across Mia\u2019s forehead. The temperature wasn\u2019t worrying \u2013 not worth going to the doctor for - but it was still higher than he was comfortable with.\nStill, he\u2019d done all he could \u2013 rest and medicine, rice porridge and yuja tea, humidifier on. If he\u2019d noticed sooner\u2026 but his sister could be stubborn in her own way, not wanting to worry him, muffling her coughs in her pillow, keeping to her room until Yoo Joonghyuk had ordered her out for lunch and she couldn\u2019t hide it anymore. It was the same logic that had her refusing to call him when she sprained her ankle in the park.\nAt least it was the weekend, and she hadn\u2019t tried going to school sick like last winter.\nStill, he had a competition that night \u2013 finals, and a team event at that. Forfeiting the prize didn\u2019t particularly matter to him in the face of Mia\u2019s comfort, but it would make headlines, and break two of his sponsorship contracts \u2013 and some of his teammates needed the match more than he did. Even losing was better than a no-show.\nHis sister was more than old enough to be left on her own for a few hours usually, and any time he was going to be home particularly late these days, she spent the night at Yoosung\u2019s house. Yoo Joonghyuk had been careful not to abuse the arrangement, despite both girls\u2019 apparent enthusiasm for it, repaying the favour on the rare occasions he could and sending over food with Mia to lessen the burden. Sending her over there sick though \u2013 that was something he couldn\u2019t do.\nIt was too short notice to find a sitter that would pass his background checks. He refused to trust his sister to a stranger. But there was no one who\u2026\nYoo Joonghyuk moved into the hallway without properly thinking about it, and knocked on his neighbour\u2019s door. There was no answer, so he knocked harder. \u201cKim Dokja, I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d\nA moment later, the door swung open, revealing Kim Dokja dressed in his usual Sunday casual outfit. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk? What do you want?\u201d He looked wary.\n\u201cI need a favour,\u201d he said.\nKim Dokja looked as though Yoo Joonghyuk had just told him the apocalypse had arrived. \u201cA\u2026 favour? You\u2026 are asking me\u2026 for a favour?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk crossed his arms. \u201cWill you help or not?\u201d\n\u201cIt depends what it is? I\u2019m not signing up to a deal without knowing what it is. What if you wanted my organs? My blood? What if you\u2019re secretly a vampire? Or-\u201d\nIre rising, Yoo Joonghyuk interrupted him before he could get rolling. \u201cMia\u2019s sick, and I have an event tonight. Can you watch her?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIs it a problem?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk really didn\u2019t want to forfeit, but he would do it, for Mia.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it, I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d trust me with your little sister?\u201d Kim Dokja looked confused.\n\u201cYou gave her a 10-minute piggyback ride home because she hurt her ankle. She\u2019s already decided you\u2019re trustworthy,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk reminded him.\n\u201cWell, yes, that was her, but I was worried you were going to actually murder me for a minute when you saw us?\u201d Kim Dokja pointed out, apparently completely ignoring that Yoo Joonghyuk had invited him to stay for dinner afterward.\nAnnoying. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably the sleep the whole time. I only need someone to keep an eye on her, in case her fever spikes, and fetch her things if she wakes up.\u201d He paused, and offered, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you. Same rate as what I would pay a normal sitter.\u201d\n\u201cShit, do you really think- she\u2019s just gonna be sleeping, right? I already said I\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s not like I was doing anything anyway.\u201d Kim Dokja stepped out, and followed Yoo Joonghyuk the five steps to his apartment. \u201cThe great Yoo Joonghyuk is asking me for a favour, that\u2019s all the payment I need.\u201d\nHe eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWho are you and what did you do with Kim Dokja?\u201d\n\u201cHar har. It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re so good at games because you\u2019d never make it as a stand-up comedian.\u201d\nHe resisted the urge to rise to Kim Dokja\u2019s poor taunts. Instead, he pointed out everything he might need. \u201cThere\u2019s yuja tea in that thermos. Medicine is here, though don\u2019t give her another dose for the next two hours. If she\u2019s hungry, there\u2019s rice porridge in the fridge that can be reheated.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What for?\u201d Kim Dokja asked, holding it close like it was precious.\n\u201cMy number. In case of emergency.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He handed it over. Yoo Joonghyuk went to contacts, entered his number, and hit ring. Once his phone began to vibrate in his pocket, he ended the call and handed it back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t abuse it,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk warned.\nHe gasped in mock offense. \u201cI would never sell it on the internet, how dare you suggest such a thing?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk glared, and he waved him off. \u201cGet going, already. Actually, give me the wifi password first.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk pointed at a strip of paper tacked onto the fridge. \u201cSupremeKingTerrorOfStars1863? That\u2019s\u2026 kind of chuuni of you? I know you\u2019re a pro gamer, but you are 28, right? I didn\u2019t imagine that?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know-\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re famous? You don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t look up your bio when I realised we were neighbours? It\u2019s not stalking to check out someone\u2019s public social media these days. Maybe don\u2019t become a famous pro gamer if it bothers you. Speaking of, don\u2019t you have somewhere to be?\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Yet\u2026 \u201cI changed my mind. You can\u2019t be trusted in my home after all.\u201d\n\u201cStill with the bad jokes. Who is doing who a favour here? Go, shoo, murder all of your enemies.\u201d Kim Dokja all but herded him out the door. \u201cI\u2019m cheering you on, okay? Get going, Yoo Joonghyuk.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk let himself back in an hour after midnight, with bags full of prizes and confetti stuck in his hair.\n\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Kim Dokja greeted him at the threshold. \u201cWow they really went to town, didn\u2019t they? What, did they just back an entire gaming store up and unload it into your arms?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk grunted in greeting, shouldered past and dumped the lot on the couch. \u201cMia?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cShe woke up once. Convinced her to have a little porridge and take some medicine, she asked after you, we watched your competition for a few minutes on my phone until she fell back asleep,\u201d Kim Dokja reported, keeping his voice low. \u201cCongratulations, by the way.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk nodded, satisfied. It had been a good night, and the knowledge that his sister was fine as well meant even Kim Dokja\u2019s special brand of irritation couldn\u2019t reach him. \u201cThank you for looking after her.\u201d\nKim Dokja waved it off. There was a ding from the kitchen at that moment \u2013 his kettle. Yoo Joonghyuk glanced at him.\n\u201cI was making tea,\u201d Kim Dokja defended. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much longer you were going to be. The competition only ended an hour ago.\u201d\n\u201cYou kept watching?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything else to do.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk went into the kitchen, pulling out a second mug. Kim Dokja had shamelessly dug out the most expensive leaves he had. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for green tea,\u201d he criticised.\n\u201cI wanted the caffeine, in case you were going to be even later.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk swapped it out for a different kind and set it to steep, and started looking through his cupboards and fridge.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cChecking to see what else you raided.\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\nKim Dokja stewed, and admitted, \u201cI had some of the leftover kimchi fried rice in the fridge. It was good?\u201d As though the compliment absolved him of it.\nYoo Joonghyuk checked. \u201cYou ate half of it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026It was really good?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually care, fool.\u201d The tea was done, and he poured two cups, pushing one across the kitchen counter to his neighbour. \u201cHere. Chamomile is better for bedtime.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what, I didn\u2019t see this one. I\u2019ve read this helps you sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had it?\u201d\n\u201cThey only have the normal kinds at the office.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Kim Dokja avoided even paying for his own tea leaves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Kim Dokja said quietly after a few sips.\nYoo Joonghyuk hummed in agreement. It took the edge off the lingering adrenaline from the evenings\u2019 matches.\nThey drank tea in the quiet kitchen in comfortable silence. Kim Dokja drained his cup first, setting it down with a tone of finality. \u201cThanks for the tea, but I should get going. I have work in the morning.\u201d\nFor someone who shamelessly helped himself to leftovers and tea leaves and bothered him at every opportunity, Kim Dokja was always strangely eager and quick to leave whenever he was actually invited. Still, Yoo Joonghyuk simply nodded, following him to the door. \u201cThank you for looking after Mia.\u201d\n\u201cYou already thanked me. Like I said, I wasn\u2019t doing anything anyway.\u201d He slipped his shoes on, and smirked when he glanced at him. \u201cYou still have confetti in your hair you know.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk frowned, running his hand through it.\n\u201cNo, you missed it \u2013 ah let me.\u201d Kim Dokja reached forward, unexpectedly, and plucked the shred of paper delicately from his hair.\nYoo Joonghyuk had frozen still, as their eyes met, the only thought running through his mind, \u2018close\u2019.\nThey stood at the threshold for a long moment, the silence heavy with an odd anticipation.\nKim Dokja broke away first, opening the door and stepping outside. \u201cGoodnight, Yoo Joonghyuk.\u201d\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\nHe turned back, head tilted in question. \u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Never mind. Goodnight.\u201d\nKim Dokja nodded. Yoo Joonghyuk let the door fall shut between them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe weird lingering mood from the previous night was helpfully wiped out by the end of the following day, thanks to his terrible mistake of giving Kim Dokja his phone number in what had seemed like a sensible decision at the time, but was clearly a moment of insanity.\n\n \u2018Did you really already change your wifi password after yesterday? Cheap bastard.\u2019 \n\n\n \u2018I offered to pay you to babysit and you wouldn\u2019t accept it. Make up your mind.\u2019 \n\n\n \u2018I can\u2019t believe you trust me to watch your sister but you don\u2019t trust me with your wifi password.\u2019 \n\n \u2018The fact that you noticed proves you can\u2019t be trusted. What\u2019s wrong with your own wifi.\u2019  Yoo Joonghyuk had been too much in a rush to question why Kim Dokja hadn\u2019t been able to use his own in the first place \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like he wouldn\u2019t have been able to use it with only a wall between.\n\n \u2018I don\u2019t have wifi? I use the free service on the trains. And the neighbour\u2019s downstairs who forgot to password protect theirs, but the connection is kind of bad two floors up.\u2019 \n\n\n\u2018And you\u2019re calling me cheap, you rat bastard?\u2019\n\n\n\u2018You\u2019re rich! It\u2019s different! I\u2019m just being thrifty.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Kim Dokja. Shut up.\u2019\n\nKim Dokja was really annoying.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk stared into the darkness of his bedroom, utterly, annoyingly conscious that Kim Dokja\u2019s bed was on the other side of the wall.\nHe\u2019d lost more than a few hours of sleep to that knowledge over the past couple of weeks.\nAs neighbours went, Kim Dokja was actually incredibly quiet, which one would never guess if they spoke to the man in person. So much so that they\u2019d lived next to each other for months before Yoo Joonghyuk even realised it.\nHe\u2019d thought at first that the soundproofing must just have been exceptionally good. But they occasionally heard sounds of life from the neighbours on the other side. He could hear the murmur of their television from the kitchen, the occasional muffled conversation when it was quiet, the odd clatter and bang of pots and pans around mealtimes, all the normal signs of life that were easily backgrounded in apartment living.\nOnce he\u2019d become aware of his other neighbour, he\u2019d started to pay attention. He heard the door open and close, twice a day. Sometimes, the sound of water in the pipes, which he\u2019d attributed to his other neighbours but now knew better. Occasionally, the muted beep of an alarm in the morning. Very little else.\nNow, though, all he could hear was a rattling, persistent cough through his bedroom wall.\nIt confirmed, at least, that the apartment\u2019s soundproofing wasn\u2019t so above average after all.\nHe\u2019d probably caught it from when he minded Yoo Mia a week ago. Yoo Joonghyuk had caught it as well, but shrugged it off within two days with little more than a stuffed nose and a sore throat which had been easily managed by off-the-shelf medication. He hadn\u2019t even needed to take a break from streaming.\nKim Dokja, on the other hand, sounded like he was at death\u2019s door.\nYoo Joonghyuk sighed, and threw back his blankets.\nIt was guilt, he told himself. Kim Dokja was sick now because he\u2019d done him a favour. And more, he would never get to sleep listening to that racket all night. If Kim Dokja was too stupid to take medicine, Yoo Joonghyuk would make him.\nHe shrugged on a second shirt, then a sweater \u2013 even if he was only going next door, it had been snowing earlier, and it would only be colder in the dead of the night. He checked on Yoo Mia \u2013 comfortably asleep \u2013 then slipped out to the hallway. The sting of cold in the unheated corridor was sharp, and he hurried to his neighbour\u2019s door, knocking twice.\n\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d he called, voice pitched low so as not to wake the whole floor.\nThere was no response. He hadn\u2019t expected one. But he found himself thankful now that he already knew Kim Dokja\u2019s door code. He quickly entered it and stepped inside.\nThe coughing sounded even worse without the dampening of a wall between them. It was bitterly cold. He quickly made his way to the back where Kim Dokja slept, flicking on the light switch as he went.\nHis annoying neighbour was curled tightly under a blanket and a pile of clothing and pressed against the wall. The pile shuddered as another cough cracked the silence.\n\u201cKim Dokja.\u201d\nThe blanket retreated enough for his neighbour to half poke his head out. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk?\u201d he croaked, then coughed again, badly covering it at the last moment. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d His voice was like broken gravel. Yoo Joonghyuk let out a displeased hiss between his teeth.\n\u201cHave you taken medicine?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cAh, did my coughing disturb you? Sorry, I took a syrup, but\u2026 well, maybe it was expired\u2026 it\u2019s not working very well,\u201d he mumbled. He squinted at him. \u201cWait\u2026 how did you get in?\u201d\n\u201cYou gave me your door code last time.\u201d\n\u201cDid I? Doesn\u2019t sound like something I\u2019d do\u2026\u201d His words broke off into another coughing fit, and his chest was heaving for breath afterwards. He dragged the blanket tighter around himself.\nYoo Joonghyuk watched the motion with a frown. It was nearly as cold inside the apartment, if Yoo Joonghyuk dared call it that, as it was outside. \u201cYou fool. Why isn\u2019t your heating on?\u201d There was being cheap, then there was being dangerously stupid.\nKim Dokja gave him a strange expression. \u201cI don\u2019t have heating? Or air-conditioning, either.\u201d\nNot even something as basic as that? Air-conditioning might have been a luxury, but heating wasn\u2019t exactly optional in winter. \u201cIdiot, how do your pipes not freeze?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s building management\u2019s problem, not mine,\u201d he mumbled, then badly smothered another cough. It sounded painful, dragging in his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s heat enough, normally, from the unit downstairs. But it\u2019s empty right now, I think? There was that leasing notice out the front last week.\u201d\nIt seemed absurd they were even in the same complex. It didn\u2019t matter how little rent they charged for this offcut converted closet, weren\u2019t there minimum standards to be met?\nThat didn\u2019t solve the immediate issue, though. Yoo Joonghyuk thought for a moment, then in one swift move ripped the blanket back and scooped Kim Dokja up in his arms.\n\u201cA-ah? Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d Kim Dokja yelped, before dissolving into another coughing fit.\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying at mine,\u201d he said, swiftly heading to the door. He had to shuffle sideways to fit through the narrow kitchen with his neighbour in his arms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to you to catch it-\u201d Kim Dokja protested.\n\u201cAlready caught it. But unlike some weak fools, I took care of myself and recovered quickly.\u201d He shouldered the front door open. In only his pyjamas, Kim Dokja shivered violently as they stepped into the even colder hallway. \u201cBear with it for a moment,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk muttered. Entering his door code with his arms full was a trial, but he eventually managed, and the burst of warm air as they stepped past the threshold made it worth it.\nHe headed straight for his bedroom, dropping Kim Dokja onto the bed and wasting no time in getting him under the blankets, and then throwing another one of his spares on top. For good measure, he went to the thermostat, turning it up another couple of degrees.\nHe turned back, and something undefinable in his stomach curled, tight and satisfied, at the sight of Kim Dokja huddled in his bed.\nLater. Yoo Joonghyuk wasn\u2019t an idiot, after all \u2013 Kim Dokja just caught him off guard, at the most unexpected times. \u201cI\u2019ll make some tea. Wait here.\u201d As though his guest had the capability of doing anything else.\nThe kitchen was still, and silent, in the way only the dead of a winter\u2019s night could be, the reverent hush barely broken by the soft burble of boiling water and the gentle clink of a spoon settling into a cup. Two spoonfuls of honey sweetened the citrusy fragrance of the yuja tea. It took a few moments to dig out the meds they\u2019d been using the last week, then he swept back into the bedroom, closing the door tightly behind him.\n\u201cWhen did you last have the syrup?\u201d\n\u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d\n\u201cJust after midnight.\u201d\n\u201cHnnn\u2026 three hours ago?\u201d There was note of uncertainty in his voice.\nClose enough, especially if it had been expired. \u201cMeds first, then tea, then sleep,\u201d he decided, helping him sit up.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d\n\u201cDrink,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk ordered. Kim Dokja made a face, suppressed a cough, and took the pills and glass both. Once he\u2019d finished them, Yoo Joonghyuk took the empty cup from his hands. \u201cGood. Now sleep.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 this is your bed, where\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cUnlike you, I have a perfectly comfortable couch.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold though.\u201d Kim Dokja scrunched up his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kick you out of your own bed? Put me on the couch.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick. You need it more than I do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 that\u2019s not\u2026\u201d His normally silver tongue had abandoned him in illness, clearly. The meds were doing their work quickly \u2013 and Kim Dokja had already been visibly exhausted. With his throat soothed by the tea and finally in proper warmth, he was fighting to stay awake.\nYoo Joonghyuk pushed him back down into the pillows. \u201cSleep, Kim Dokja,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk did not sleep well on the couch. He was woken after a frankly disappointing amount of rest by his sister getting up for school. Normally he was up first so that breakfast and lunch could already be made for her \u2013 though Yoo Mia had simply lit up when he gave her money for both instead. \u201cThanks oppa! I hope that ugly ahjussi gets better soon!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t just buy snacks,\u201d he warned her, probably pointlessly. Yoo Mia did what she wanted most of the time anyway.\nHis morning routine thoroughly wrecked, he checked his calendar, and rescheduled the one stream he had planned for the day. It was supposed to be a quiet week anyway - intentional downtime following the punishing schedule of the last tournament. A brief glance in his bedroom showed Kim Dokja unmoving, a lump curled beneath the blankets, still quietly asleep. He went next door, found his phone, and called Minosoft for him. Then started making rice porridge, because who knew when the last time his idiot neighbour had eaten was.\nHe waited long enough for a bowl of it to cool to a comfortable temperature, then went to wake Kim Dokja up.\nThis time, though, when he checked on him, his neighbour had kicked off half the blankets he\u2019d previously been curled up under. His face was flushed red, and his black hair clung wetly to his forehead.\nYoo Joonghyuk frowned, setting the porridge aside. He didn\u2019t even need to check to know the idiot had a fever. He detoured back to the kitchen for a towel, a thermometer, and a cold compress.\nWhen he started dabbing the sweat from his face, Kim Dokja\u2019s eyes at last fluttered open. He stared into space for a long moment, before his dark gaze lazily wandered to Yoo Joonghyuk, and settled there. Thirty long seconds crawled by before he finally mumbled, \u201cYoo Joonghyuk?\u201d\n\u201cKim Dokja,\u201d he greeted in response, and shoved the thermometer in his mouth.\nIt was testament to how out of it his neighbour must have been feeling that he didn\u2019t react beyond a slow blink. His eyes roved the room, and squinted at the weak sliver of light leaking past the drawn blinds. Once Yoo Joonghyuk reclaimed the thermometer, he wet his lips and croaked, \u201cWhat time-\u201d\n\u201c10am.\u201d\nKim Dokja stared blearily at him, then sat up as though in slow motion. \u201cWait, I have work-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk pressed him back down. Kim Dokja collapsed back into bed far too easily. \u201cI already called you in sick.\u201d\n\u201cNo- I\u2019m contract, I can\u2019t-\u201d Kim Dokja had all the coordination of newborn kitten attempting to claw its way out of the blankets.\n\u201cKim Dokja. Even if you somehow made it to work without collapsing, they would send you home immediately,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk warned him. \u201cI already called you in anyway. It\u2019s too late.\u201d\nHis neighbour finally stopped struggling, defeated. He gazed at him far too long, then around the room again in bewilderment, as though only just registering where he was. \u201cWhere\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have heating in your apartment. That\u2019s not useful for recovering from sickness, fool.\u201d He glared at the thermometer. The reading was alarmingly high \u2013 worse than Yoo Mia had been, barely shy of requiring medical attention. How much higher might it have been if his idiot neighbour had shivered his way through the whole night? Only Kim Dokja would somehow find a way to die of exposure indoors. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d\nThe crease in his neighbour\u2019s brow suggested strongly that no, he didn\u2019t.\n\u201cNever mind. I\u2019ve got medicine and food. Eat, if you can handle it.\u201d\nIn the throes of fever, Kim Dokja was lethargically compliant, though he only managed a few mouthfuls of porridge before he let the spoon idle in the bowl and his hand fall limp. Yoo Joonghyuk took it away before it could spill. It reminded him sharply of that night he\u2019d dragged the man home drunk and put him to bed. He helped him lie back down, and was placing the cold compress on his forehead when Kim Dokja started coughing again, turning away, onto his side as he struggled to suppress it.\nIt went on for some minutes. Yoo Joonghyuk rubbed his back, waiting for the fit to subside. Kim Dokja\u2019s shoulders shuddered, his spine arching under the sweep of his thumb as he curled up, as though hiding. He really was alarmingly warm. \u201cYou should see a doctor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled into the blankets once he got his breath back. He tucked his face beneath his palms, curling his fingers to shield himself from sight.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk disagreed, but then, all a doctor would likely do was assign bed rest and care, maybe a script for some stronger medicine. Taking Kim Dokja out of the apartment into freezing temperatures would probably do more damage than waiting out the fever.\nIf it didn\u2019t break by the next day, though, Yoo Joonghyuk would deliver him to a doctor whether Kim Dokja wanted it or not. \u201cHey,\u201d he prodded, picking up the compress again. \u201cYou need this.\u201d He pulled Kim Dokja\u2019s hands clear from his head \u2013 then dropped them, startled by the tear tracks running down his face. \u201cAre you-\u201d\nKim Dokja looked away. \u201cThe coughing,\u201d he croaked, which made Yoo Joonghyuk immediately certain that the coughing wasn\u2019t the cause at all.\nHis gaze raked over his dishevelled form, looking for any other missed symptoms. Maybe a doctor visit should be imminent after all? \u201cAre you hurting anywhere?\u201d Kim Dokja shook his head. Yoo Joonghyuk frowned, and reached for the cold compress a third time. This time, at least, it settled over his neighbour\u2019s brow without incident. He carefully towelled away the sweat soaking into the collar of his pyjamas. Kim Dokja covered his face again, as breathless, half-aborted coughs continued to escape his lips.\n\u201c\u2026No one\u2019s ever done this for me,\u201d Kim Dokja eventually muttered weakly between coughs, as though sharing a shameful secret. \u201cNot since\u2026\u201d\nWas that why he was crying? In truth, Yoo Joonghyuk couldn\u2019t remember anyone doing it for him either \u2013 but then, he hadn\u2019t been properly sick since he was a child. He\u2019d always had a strong constitution, and his job wasn\u2019t one that brought him into regular contact with the public. Getting sick was a rare event for him. \u201cI have practice, with Mia,\u201d was all he said, rather than acknowledging the vulnerability in those words. He could respect that under normal circumstances, Kim Dokja would never have uttered them. \u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d he excused. \u201cSleep will help you recover faster. Get as much as you can.\u201d He stood to leave.\nKim Dokja caught Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s sleeve, though he only had the strength to grasp it for a moment. \u201cWhat?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked. \u201cYou need something?\u201d\n\u201cAh. No. Sorry,\u201d he whispered, fingers falling away.\nYoo Joonghyuk stared down at him, and sighed. He sat on the edge of the bed \u2013 Kim Dokja had rolled over enough for there to be room. \u201cI\u2019ll stay until you fall asleep.\u201d Given his condition, he doubted it would take more than a few minutes for his troublesome neighbour to drift off again.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk lent against the headboard, nonchalant. \u201cDon\u2019t expect any entertainment, though.\u201d\n\u201cHn. Your face is\u2026 entertainment enough.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk raised an eyebrow, glancing down at him.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if this was real,\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real. You just have a fever, fool.\u201d\n\u201cWish\u2026 I could just\u2026 stay like this f\u2019rever. It\u2019s\u2026 nice. Thought you were a bastard, but you\u2019re\u2026 so nice. And so\u2026 so cool.\u201d His voice was shredded, an entire octave deeper than his usual airy lilt.\n\u2018Nice\u2019 was not a term Yoo Joonghyuk had ever been called before. He glanced away, abruptly uncomfortable. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk. It\u2019s more strain on your throat.\u201d\nNaturally, Kim Dokja kept talking. \u201cCouldn\u2019t\u2026 believe it. When I found out that h\u2019ndsome guy from the billboards\u2026\u201d he muttered, his words slow, sleepy and stilted. He coughed again. \u201cN\u2019ver expected\u2026 that you\u2019d even remember my name. Wish it could\u2026 last\u2026 But someone like me can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t what, Kim Dokja?\u201d There was no response. \u201cKim Dokja?\u201d Carefully, he reached for the hand still shielding his face, and when he pulled it away, his eyes were closed, and his face relaxed.\nKim Dokja had fallen asleep.\nYoo Joonghyuk stared. \u201cFool,\u201d he murmured, and stood to fetch another compress.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t take another day off work,\u201d Kim Dokja bemoaned.\nYoo Joonghyuk ignored him. The day was half over as it was anyway. If he had his way, his neighbour wouldn\u2019t go to work tomorrow, either.\nKim Dokja had spent most of the previous day and night slipping in and out of feverish delirium. It finally broke in the early hours, saving them both from an imminent trip to the doctor, if not the emergency room. He wasn\u2019t interested in the man\u2019s attempts at undoing that work.\n\u201cI appreciate you helping me out, but I\u2019m fine now, so I can go back to my own apartment?\u201d he bargained.\n\u201cDid you suddenly get heating in your apartment while you were sleeping?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026No?\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re staying.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk collected the half empty bowl of rice porridge, but gave it a pointed look, and earned a shamefaced expression in response. That Kim Dokja still couldn\u2019t finish it was commentary enough on his recovery.\n\u201cAt least let me take the couch instead,\u201d he reasoned, pausing briefly to stifle a cough. \u201cYou look like you haven\u2019t slept.\u201d\nIn truth, Yoo Joonghyuk had barely slept at all, monitoring his neighbour\u2019s symptoms restlessly and unable to bring himself to leave his bedside even after his fever finally broke, for reasons he didn\u2019t care to examine too closely, not until the immediate problem was dealt with. \u201cIt\u2019s colder out there,\u201d he dismissed. Still, with exhaustion dragging on his limbs, a nap wasn\u2019t a bad idea. He eyed the bed, then eyed Kim Dokja.\nWhy not.\n\u201cShove over,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk ordered. Confused, Kim Dokja did, and Yoo Joonghyuk kicked off his slippers and slid under the blankets. The mattress was still warm from his body heat.\n\u201c\u2026E-excuse me?\u201d Kim Dokja spluttered.\nYoo Joonghyuk shoved the pillow at his neighbour and tucked his own arm under his head. The bed was a queen size, western-style, but he would need to get a second pillow out of the cupboard. Later, though. \u201cIt\u2019s more than big enough for us both. You barely take up any space anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?!\u201d\nIt meant Kim Dokja slept curled up like a child, in a way that probably wasn\u2019t doing his back any favours but left three quarters of the bed free. \u201cYou were the one complaining.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cShut up Kim Dokja,\u201d he mumbled, already drifting off. \u201cYou\u2019re staying.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDespite Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s displeasure, Kim Dokja extricated himself from the apartment and went to work the next day.\nAnnoying as that was, it did give Yoo Joonghyuk the chance to finally to catch up on some of his neglected obligations. He answered a backlog of e-mails, updated his schedule, and finally did the delayed stream. Then he sat in his chair for one long hour, and spent far, far too much time thinking about Kim Dokja.\nKim Dokja treated him with a frankly disrespectful level of familiarity that made him feel as though they had been friends for years even though they\u2019d only properly met a matter of months ago. He lied as easily as breathing with his words but was incredibly honest with his actions. He was hopeless and seemed to barely be able to take care of himself, but when it came to anyone else he was suddenly reliable. He would greedily steal everything he could and resolutely refuse anything he was given.\nHe was irritating in his contrariness. But he wasn\u2019t bad looking, with delicate features and smooth skin and eyes you could get lost in and legs that never seemed to end. Yoo Joonghyuk had never thought he liked men, but he had become interested, after not being interested in anyone in years. The last had been Lee Seolwha, all the way back in his senior year of high school. She\u2019d gone on to become a doctor, he\u2019d heard. They\u2019d broken up amicably while she was in college, lost touch, and he hadn\u2019t had the urge to reconnect. And despite ample opportunities \u2013 Yoo Joonghyuk wasn\u2019t unaware that he had an awful lot of \u2018face\u2019 fans \u2013 no one had caught his attention since. Until now.\nIt was momentous enough that he couldn't deny it, or ignore it. It had grown too strong even without his attention.\nAnnoying. Not least because his ridiculous and inconvenient crush seemed determined to kill himself with self-neglect.\nWith that in mind, he made chicken soup with ginseng for dinner, then went to knock on his neighbour\u2019s door. He waited a polite ten seconds, then keyed in the code and opened it.\nKim Dokja stuck his head out into the narrow hallway with a scowl. \u201cOf course it\u2019s you. Just letting yourself in now?\u201d\n\u201cWere you pretending not to be home?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to answer!\u201d\n\u201cIf you cared you would change your door code,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s dinner. Come over. And bring your sleep clothes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nSeeing Kim Dokja\u2019s lack of movement on the matter, Yoo Joonghyuk slipped off his shoes at the threshold and fetched them himself. After some consideration, he grabbed Kim Dokja\u2019s work clothes as well. \u201cHurry up, or dinner will get cold. Mia\u2019s waiting.\u201d\n\u201cW-wait!\u201d Kim Dokja stopped to suppress another coughing fit, then hurried after him. \u201cYoo Joonghyuk!\u201d\nIn the end, he followed Yoo Joonghyuk back to his much warmer apartment, still complaining. \u201cYou know I do really appreciate everything you did, but this is too-\u201d\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t have heating. You\u2019re still sick. It\u2019s going to get to -10 tonight. You\u2019re staying,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, in a tone that allowed no argument. He went and set Kim Dokja\u2019s clothes on a spare shelf in his closet and came back to the kitchen, where Yoo Mia was staring his neighbour down with her usual deadpan.\n\u201cIs he gonna be over here all the time now?\u201d she asked, in a tone of voice that implied that she didn\u2019t particularly care either way. She wasn\u2019t even a teenager yet, but was already moving into that phase of wanting nothing to do with the adults in her life and spending all of her time in her room on her phone with her friends.\n\u201cWhenever it\u2019s below freezing,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk answered.\n\u201cSo all of winter then,\u201d she remarked.\nYoo Joonghyuk made a vague sound of agreement. Kim Dokja made a strangled noise in his throat.\nYoo Mia stared at him, then smirked.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk gave Kim Dokja their door code. Kim Dokja proceeded to not use it, leaving Yoo Joonghyuk to all but physically drag him over nearly every night. It took two weeks of that and an actual blizzard for Kim Dokja to sheepishly let himself in clutching a change of clothes and his phone charger.\n\u201cJust until this weather clears,\u201d Kim Dokja promised.\nYoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t respond, consumed in the process of popcorn flavouring. Yoo Mia waved from her spot in front of the television. \u201cShut up, ahjussi, the ad break is nearly over.\u201d\n\u201cYou really are siblings,\u201d he muttered as he sank onto the couch behind her and started mindlessly scrolling through his phone. By now, Yoo Joonghyuk had learned that Kim Dokja was a voracious reader of just about anything he could get his hands on, which meant, given his cheapness, mostly free trashy webnovels.\nThat reminded him. \u201cHow did you get the wifi password again?\u201d\n\u201cSocial engineering,\u201d Kim Dokja replied. At Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s stare, he expanded, \u201cI asked Yoo Mia.\u201d\nYoo Mia held up her hand distractedly, and Kim Dokja obligingly reached forward to give her a high-five.\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d Yoo Mia complained. \u201cYou gave him the door code .\u201d\nShe had a point. Yoo Joonghyuk split the popcorn into two bowls. \u201cKim Dokja, did you eat dinner?\u201d It was later than he normally got home.\n\u201cKimbap.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the convenience store again?\u201d\n\u201cWhere else?\u201d he grumbled, then answered the implied question. \u201cThe subway was running late. Snow delays on some of the lines.\u201d\nYoo Mia perked up. \u201cDo you think school will be closed tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cWeather report said it\u2019ll pass by morning. Don\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk warned. Then to Kim Dokja, \u201cWe have leftovers.\u201d He\u2019d cooked assuming Kim Dokja would be there, but when he\u2019d knocked on his door, the apartment had still been dark and empty.\nKim Dokja waved him off. \u201cThe kimbap was enough.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk frowned, but dropped it. It was enough that for once, Kim Dokja had come over without having to be dragged here for his own good. It seemed his idiot wasn\u2019t quite stupid enough to try to get through a blizzard without heating when he had other options.\nHe took the bowls of popcorn, handed one to Yoo Mia, then sat down on the couch next to Kim Dokja, close enough that their thighs touched.\nKim Dokja leaned away, glancing up from his phone to glare. \u201cPersonal space? There\u2019s a whole other half of the couch, why are you sitting in the middle?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk just threw his arm over the back and offered the bowl of popcorn. \u201cIt's easier to share.\"\n\"Just put it between?\"\n\"It's my couch,\" Yoo Joonghyuk retorted flatly.\u00a0\nKim Dokja glowered, but took a handful of popcorn, shoved it obnoxiously into his mouth as though in challenge, and turned his attention back to whatever webnovel he was reading. As expected, he eventually got absorbed, relaxing back into the soft couch cushion, settling so close Yoo Joonghyuk could feel the warmth radiating from his side.\nOutside, the blizzard howled. Inside, the apartment was warm and inviting like a hug, with the scent of buttery popcorn hanging in the air and the soft blanket of murmurs from the television.\nYoo Joonghyuk tapped at his knee restlessly as another ad break started. \u201cStop that, you\u2019ll spill it,\u201d Kim Dokja chided him, shifting the bowl onto his lap instead.\nYoo Mia glanced back at him. \u201cHnnn? Oppa\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d she remarked.\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d Kim Dokja grumbled. \u201cIs that special sibling powers?\u201d\nYoo Mia just grinned between mouthfuls of popcorn.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKim Dokja\u2019s tiny, converted apartment didn\u2019t have a bathtub \u2013 its second worst feature, right behind the lack of heating. Yoo Joonghyuk had seized on that, and after the usual irritating back and forth, convinced his neighbour to use theirs instead of relying on the nearest public one that was inconveniently far away. It wasn\u2019t hard \u2013 after all, it saved Kim Dokja money, and the man liked to self-pamper. He moisturized, even, which for someone so cheap said a lot about where it laid on his priorities.\nThe etiquette normally would have been for Kim Dokja to go first, as a guest, then Yoo Joonghyuk, then Yoo Mia as the youngest, but practicality won out \u2013 Yoo Mia had the earliest bedtime, so went first. Yoo Joonghyuk often streamed or practiced gaming until late, so he usually went last. The routine had settled in quickly, within a matter of days.\nSo it was a surprise to them both when Yoo Joonghyuk was relaxing in the bath, and Kim Dokja stepped into the bathroom with his clothes over his arm.\nHis neighbour had his phone in his hand, attention caught by something on it, so didn\u2019t even notice until he\u2019d already closed and locked the door behind him, turned back around, and Yoo Joonghyuk said, \u201cKim Dokja?\u201d\nHe startled, a full body flinch that had him scrambling and nearly dropping his phone. \u201cY-y-yoo Joonghyuk? What are you doing here?\u201d\nOh. A frisson of disappointment ran through him, which he pushed aside \u2013 it had been an irrational idea in the first place, considering who he was dealing with. There was no way Kim Dokja would ever be that forward. \u201cIt was empty,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk explained. \u201cI thought you were already done.\u201d\n\u201cI got distracted! Reading,\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled, turning and fumbling blindly for the door again. \u201cExcuse me I\u2019ll-\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m finished,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk interrupted, rising from the bathtub, water sluicing down his legs as he stepped out. \u201cPass me my towel.\u201d\nKim Dokja squeaked. Squeaked. Like a startled rabbit.\nYoo Joonghyuk kept his expression carefully blank. This almost made up for his earlier disappointment.\nFlustered, Kim Dokja snatched the first towel on the rack and thrust it towards Yoo Joonghyuk with an air of desperately fake indifference and nerveless fingers. Those dark eyes darted to his bare chest, and away again, and Yoo Joonghyuk could see his struggle to keep his gaze up, away, and it wasn\u2019t just the swirling steam turning Kim Dokja\u2019s face red.\nYoo Joonghyuk stepped closer \u2013 in arm\u2019s reach, the bathroom wasn\u2019t that big \u2013 and plucked the towel from his hands. Watched Kim Dokja try not to watch from the corner of his eyes as he towelled his chest and arms dry, at the way his throat bobbed as he swallowed, the way his fingers tightened around his forgotten phone.\n\u201cAre you doing this on purpose?\u201d Kim Dokja accused. His voice was strangled.\n\u201cDoing what on purpose?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked, as he took pity on his neighbour and finally wrapped the towel around his waist.\nYoo Joonghyuk wasn\u2019t unaware he had a good body \u2013 he exercised in the mornings, ate well, and could attribute the rest to good genes. Enough people had commented on it before without seeing him naked. But to see Kim Dokja react\u2026\n\u201cYou really have no shame,\u201d Kim Dokja said, and even he looked embarrassed at how his words came out breathless instead of admonishing, and the shock of it seemed to finally make him look away. His next words came out steadier. \u201cI know we\u2019re both men but still have a little propriety, hmm?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who barged in,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk pointed out.\n\u201cThat-! I would have-! You-!\u201d Kim Dokja blustered.\nThe reaction was too much, for someone who\u2019d completed military service. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s ego didn\u2019t particularly need the help, but a bit of assurance never went awry. He\u2019d made a few assumptions about Kim Dokja. It didn\u2019t hurt to have them confirmed.\nHe leaned in close. Kim Dokja went still, as the leftover steam swirled around them like a misty cloak.\n\u201cBathroom\u2019s all yours,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk murmured, and unlocked the door.\nIt had been worth it. Even if Kim Dokja spent the next three days showering at his own apartment instead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey had arrangements, even if they were arrived at informally. One of those was that Yoo Joonghyuk did the cooking. He liked cooking, and was good at it, and his schedule was one that left him time for it. It had the added benefit that he could ensure that his annoying idiot of a crush would eat properly and not die of scurvy.\nExcept occasionally Kim Dokja did get home early, or had the day off, and for some reason on those days, insisted on helping.\nIt would have be fine if he'd just stuck to cutting vegetables. It might have even been enjoyable. Unfortunately, his neighbour frequently had other ideas.\nKim Dokja tried, and failed, to elbow Yoo Joonghyuk aside. \u201cLet me cook! I\u2019m not a leech!\u201d\n\u201cYou are a leech.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m trying not to be? What\u2019s your problem anyway?\u201d\n\u201cYour cooking is irritating.\u201d\n\u201cMy cooking? You ate my dumplings with no complaints last time! You even said they were good! You\u2019re the one who just tosses everything into a pot and it magically turns out fabulous! There\u2019s nothing wrong with using a recipe!\u201d He meticulously started shaking out salt into a tiny measuring spoon.\n\u201cWhat are you doing? That\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cThe recipe calls for a pinch of salt, and a pinch is 1/16th of a teaspoon-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk snatched the salt from him, and shook it over the bowl. \"This is why you're slow. We won't eat until midnight if we do it your way.\"\n\u201cDon\u2019t just toss it in there! You\u2019ll ruin it! That\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk dismissed. \u201cMore of the sugar will even it out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2026 really? Where does it say that?\u201d Kim Dokja started scrolling through the recipe on his phone intently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, fool.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying,\u201d Kim Dokja complained. Yoo Joonghyuk patted him on the hip, and he automatically shifted to the side to make room for him to reach around for the draw. \u201cAnd your personal space problem is getting worse.\u201d\n\u201cWe literally share a bed,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk pointed out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s-\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s face turned the colour of the sunset. It was an attractive shade on him. \u201cShould I-\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t snore and you sleep like the dead. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said before Kim Dokja could spiral his way into trying to sleep on the couch again, or worse, his own icebox of a live-in closet. He tossed a handful of sliced cabbage into the bowl, then cracked an egg one handed over it.\nKim Dokja scowled, only now realising that Yoo Joonghyuk had effectively taken over all of the cooking tasks he\u2019d been doing while he\u2019d been distracted. \u201cYou bastard,\u201d he muttered, but just went to the sink to start loading the dishes into the dishwasher instead. He seemed to get some unending joy out of using the dishwasher, so Yoo Joonghyuk let him have it without contest. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to cook if you\u2019re just going to take it over every time.\u201d\n\u201cI never asked you.\u201d\nKim Dokja threw the dishtowel at him. Yoo Joonghyuk caught it with his spare hand and used it to open the oven door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t find any socks,\u201d Kim Dokja said in greeting as he wandered past.\n\u201cCheck the clean laundry, I haven\u2019t put it away yet,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, absorbed in sifting flour. \u201cThey might have got mixed in with Mia\u2019s.\u201d\nThirty minutes later, when Yoo Joonghyuk had moved to putting the cake in the oven, Kim Dokja re-emerged, socks in hand. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you just left it all in the basket. I did the ironing and put the rest away.\"\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, pointlessly. Kim Dokja, he\u2019d discovered, was actually a bit of a neat freak, and especially particular about clothes. Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s closet hadn\u2019t been so well organised and folded in his entire life.\n\u201cJust because you don\u2019t wear clothes that crease doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us do.\u201d\n\u201cI iron Mia\u2019s uniforms,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, offended at the implication he didn\u2019t. He stared down at Kim Dokja\u2019s feet. \u201cWhy are you still wearing the guest slippers?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cThe blue and white ones. With the squids on them. Those are yours.\u201d He steered Kim Dokja back to the entrance, and pointed at the new and frankly hideous slippers lined up next to Kim Dokja\u2019s shoes.\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t need- I mean, the guest slippers are fine?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk dropped his hands on his shoulders, holding him in place. \u201cYoo Mia chose them for you.\u201d\nKim Dokja slumped. \u201cI can\u2019t refuse, can I?\u201d he mourned.\nYoo Joonghyuk just patted him on the back, satisfied.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYoo Joonghyuk fought back a yawn, shrugging off his sweater in the dark and tossing it haphazardly into a dark corner of the bedroom.\nKim Dokja stirred, blinking sleepily as Yoo Joonghyuk sat on the bed and slid under the blankets. \u201cStream ran late?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d It had been a team match, so he hadn\u2019t been able to dip out at his usual time. \u201cSorry if I woke you.\u201d It was another cold night \u2013 cold enough that Kim Dokja hadn\u2019t even tried to escape to his own apartment as he often did when Yoo Joonghyuk was too occupied to enforce his presence. He considered getting up to turn up the heat to compensate, but he settled for tugging on the blankets instead. \u201cHey, don\u2019t hog them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Kim Dokja protested sleepily, not moving at all.\n\u201cHn. Fine.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk scooted to the middle of the bed, reached over, and snagged Kim Dokja by the waist and dragged him and his nest of blankets to him.\n\u201cA-ah! Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d Kim Dokja made to roll away, but Yoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t budge, letting out a pleased hum low in his throat. Kim Dokja was already warm, from two hours buried under the blankets. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing,\u201d he whined.\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cHow do you get arms like this playing games?\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled, giving up on his struggles and dragging his pillow over in sleepy defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d They fell quiet, nestled in the warm centre over the bed under the mound of blankets.\nYoo Joonghyuk had always been the sort of fall asleep quickly and easily. Here, like this, with Kim Dokja trapped under his arm where he couldn\u2019t disappear without waking him, he almost regretted how swiftly he could feel himself drifting off.\nHe was moments from oblivion when Kim Dokja\u2019s voice pierced the darkness once more. \u201cThis is weird, isn\u2019t it, Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d His words were so small and quiet it was nearly a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019ve never had friends. But this is weird, right?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019re friends?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk muttered, a trifle incredulously.\n\u201c\u2026No?\u201d Kim Dokja ventured, everything in his tone suggesting that until a few seconds ago, he\u2019d thought \u2018yes\u2019 and was now re-evaluating that assumption.\n\u201cHm. Forget that. Are you uncomfortable?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked, opening an eye, staring down at the sleep-tousled head of black hair tucked under his chin, staving off slumber a moment longer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice, but- it\u2019s weird, right?\u201d\n\u201cAre you complaining about \u2018propriety\u2019 again?\u201d he grumbled. He bit back another yawn, and tightened his grip a little more, until Kim Dokja\u2019s back was flush against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. If you hate it, tell me. If you don\u2019t hate it, then it\u2019s fine. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\nIf Kim Dokja said anything else, he didn\u2019t hear it. But when Yoo Joonghyuk blinked back to awareness the next morning, he was still in his arms, body heavy and warm and still but for the slow draw of his breath.\nHe never thought, when they first met, that it would lead to this. But it wouldn't be so bad, he mused, waking up like this every morning. It was hard to picture getting sick of it.\nKim Dokja fit into his life better than he ever imagined. Yoo Joonghyuk didn't want to let go.\nStill, there were practical considerations to be dealt with. He reluctantly withdrew, and headed to the bathroom. He might have told off Kim Dokja for caring about it\u2026 but there were still lines of propriety that were best not crossed yet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of the wrong season for this?\u201d Kim Dokja asked, ducking deeper into the folds of his grey scarf as a biting gust blew across the nearby lake.\n\u201cLess crowded,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk grunted. He\u2019d gone for his usual incognito outfit, though had switched his normal hoodie for a thicker black down jacket. Yoo Mia skipped along next to him dressed in a smaller purple version of the same \u2013 Shin Yoosung scampered after her in red one, with a bright yellow scarf flapping over her shoulder as they rushed ahead to the ticket line.\n\u201cBeing popular and famous sure is hard,\u201d Kim Dokja remarked, then grabbed Shin Yoosung as they caught up and set about fixing her scarf. \u201cHow about this way, hmm? I think tying your scarf like this is much cuter, right?\u201d\nShin Yoosung watched intently. \u201cWhat? How did Dokja-ahjussi do it? Do it again!\u201d she demanded. Kim Dokja just laughed, undid her scarf, and retied it again, slower so she could watch. Yoo Mia tugged on his sleeve seriously, glanced at Yoosung\u2019s scarf, then back at him, eyes narrowed.\nKim Dokja sighed. \u201cHow about I do yours too, Mia? Then you two can match.\u201d\n\u201cIf you insist,\u201d she said blandly.\n\u201cYou really are siblings,\u201d Kim Dokja muttered. He glanced at Yoo Joonghyuk, hesitant. \u201cAre you really sure-\u201d\n\u201cTicket price is the same for four as it is for three,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, cutting off the argument before it could start again. \u201cTheme parks are better with even numbers.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you ever do anything with your days off anyway.\u201d\n\u201cRude. I do my grocery shopping.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk carefully didn\u2019t point out that Kim Dokja hadn\u2019t needed to do his grocery shopping for over two months \u2013 since Yoo Joonghyuk dragged him over for dinner nearly every night so the fool wouldn\u2019t die of scurvy, then kept him there for breakfast too, after he discovered that was a meal his neighbour didn\u2019t bother with on the altar of budgeting. Instead, he just mutely paid for the four tickets \u2013 two adults, two children, family pass \u2013 and ushered them into the theme park.\n\u201cOppa, we wanna go on Dokkaebi Wind first,\u201d his sister demanded. She and Yoosung had spent the entire journey there pouring over the park map.\n\u201cSure,\u201d he agreed. \u201cLead the way.\u201d\nKim Dokja ambled alongside him as the two girls forged a path to their chosen attraction. His gaze darted to the giftshops, to the gaudy store fronts, to the looming rides in the distance, greedily drinking in every detail.\n\u201cSee anything interesting?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all interesting,\u201d Kim Dokja admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a theme park before.\u201d\n\u201cToo expensive?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk guessed. There were enough of them local to Seoul that it was strange to find anyone who hadn\u2019t been at least once.\n\u201cThere\u2019s that, but more it\u2019s not the kind of place you really go on your own.\u201d He craned his neck catch the details on the rainbow archway overhead.\n\u201cHm.\u201d \u2018Never had friends\u2019 he\u2019d said once under the safe blanket of night. Yoo Joonghyuk had taken it as hyperbole, but sometimes, in such moments, he had to wonder.\nIt didn\u2019t make any sense to him. Certainly, he\u2019d seen firsthand that Kim Dokja could be reticent around others, and socially awkward, and especially socially oblivious. He had seen that his neighbour kept to himself even at his workplace, but there was nothing particularly objectionable about him beyond his obsessive cheapness and his bad habit of talking like a con artist and propensity for petty grade school level insults. Surely that wasn\u2019t enough to scare off everybody. Half of the other pro gamers Yoo Joonghyuk interacted with were far worse on all counts, and had no shortage of people willing to call them friends.\nTheir loss, he decided, as Kim Dokja bumped his shoulder and excitedly pointed out the giant fiberglass tiger half-covered in snow in the distance.\nThe benefit of their visit being in the off-season \u2013 in addition to choosing a less popular park \u2013 was the short lines for rides, even on the weekend. Mia and Yoosung corralled them to the top spin style ride in short order \u2013 of which the two girls only barely cleared the height requirements. They screamed with delight as the ride spun them high in the air. Yoo Joonghyuk kept an eye on them, glad to see Mia having such unrestrained fun.\nThen he glanced to the left, and caught sight of Kim Dokja, with his eyes screwed shut, knuckles clutching the bar over their knees so tight they turned white.\n\u201cKim Dokja, are you okay?\u201d\nHis words were swallowed by the joyous shouts of the kids. The ride stilled for a moment at the height of the arch, then dropped again, the air rushing past his ears and the ground looming before him, then tilting crazily as the ride spun them one full revolution. Kim Dokja, even with his eyes shut tight and body held rigid, seemed to grow even more distressed.\nAs the ride slowed once more near the top, Yoo Joonghyuk reached out to get his attention, patting the hand gripped on the bar. In a moment, that fierce grasp transferred to his wrist, punishingly tight. Yoo Joonghyuk twisted it, so their fingers were interlaced instead, and returned the grip just as firmly, trying to offer what little reassurance he could.\nThe ride only lasted for three minutes luckily, before it slowed, and with gentle rocking motions lowered them back to the initial platform. The harnesses and bars released with a click, and Mia and Yoosung scurried away immediately, laughing and already opening the map for the next attraction.\nKim Dokja, on the hand, hadn\u2019t opened his eyes or relaxed his grip at all. \u201cHey,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk prodded, squeezing his hand once more \u2013 though the pressure was already so tight he felt it in his bones. \u201cThe ride\u2019s over.\u201d\nHis eyes snapped open at that. His face was pale, and a moment later, he pasted a wan smile on his lips as he shakily relaxed his grip. \u201cAh\u2026 sorry.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t let go, though, ducking out of his harness and helping Kim Dokja raise his with his free hand. He grabbed his elbow to steady him as lurched from his seat and wobbled down the stairs. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I just\u2026 it caught me off guard,\u201d was all he managed.\n\u201cScared of heights?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk guessed.\n\u201cNot really, I go up to the roof at work all the time. Maybe ah\u2026 the falling?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk mentally crossed off the tower drop from their list of attractions. Actually\u2026 quite a few rides his adrenaline junkie of a little sister had wanted to go on. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit out the rollercoasters. Yoo Mia probably doesn\u2019t meet the height requirement for most of them anyway.\u201d\n\u201cYou can still go, I can wait outside. I\u2019m just a tagalong anyway,\u201d he suggested. Yoo Joonghyuk ignored him, and tried not to be disappointed when Kim Dokja finally pulled his hand away once they reached the main footpath.\nAt least some colour had returned to his face.\nHe bounced back quickly enough for the Haunted House, then the Time Machine 5D 360, then he and Yoo Joonghyuk stood in line for churros while Yoo Mia and Shin Yoosung rode the Galaxy Train coaster. They ambled among the gardens eating their treats afterwards, until they came to a vintage shooting range, and Yoo Joonghyuk shot a perfect score, the rapid ding of pellets against targets almost drowned out by Yoosung\u2019s excitement.\n\u201cWe should take you to those sideshow pavilions. Clear out all their prizes,\u201d Kim Dokja commented, in a way that only halfway sounded like a joke.\n\u201cThose are rigged,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk dismissed.\n\u201cYour brother is so cool Mia!\u201d Yoosung enthused. \u201cOh, isn\u2019t there laser tag here too? We should do that!\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a fair fight,\u201d Yoo Mia said, but was already unfolding the park map again. \u201cIt\u2019s called Sudden Attack.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if we all gang up on you, hey Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d Kim Dokja suggested with a grin.\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nIt was, of course, a massacre.\n\u201cThat can\u2019t have been very challenging for you,\u201d Kim Dokja lamented at the end of the third round, gasping for breath. He\u2019d come out with an abysmal result. Yoo Mia and Shin Yoosung had both done better than him \u2013 and combined the three of them didn\u2019t even make it halfway to Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s score. \u201cPro gamers are too strong. I thought you\u2019d at least go easy on the kids?\u201d\n\u201cThat was going easy.\u201d\n\u201cTerrifying.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ahjussi,\u201d Yoosung consoled him, reaching up to pat him on the back. \u201cYou did really well for your first time playing!\u201d\n\u201cYou suck,\u201d Yoo Mia said blandly, but she didn\u2019t seem too bothered by losing. \u201cOppa, I want lunch.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk checked the time. \u201cI made reservations. If we walk slowly, we should get there about the right time.\u201d\nLunch was to be in a decadently fancy restaurant by the rose gardens, which both girls loved and he and Kim Dokja stood out like sore thumbs in. The seats were all wrought iron painted white, the tables decorated with white tablecloths and floral centrepieces and delicate western-style silverware. Half the restaurant side-eyed them as they took their seats.\n\u201cDo you think you got recognised?\u201d Kim Dokja whispered next to him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why they\u2019re staring,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk replied. No one was trying to take stealth photographs, after all. And the clientele weren\u2019t the younger crowd who knew his face \u2013 it was mostly families or couples on dates or well-to-do gold misses out treating themselves. The reason why he\u2019d chosen this theme park instead of the more popular Lotte World or Everland.\n\u201cHmm, even dressed like that your face is eye-catching, I guess,\u201d Kim Dokja decided, bumping him with his shoulder, then frowning at the sound of giggles the next table over, craning his head to seek out the source. Finding nothing, he turned his attention to the red roses arranged artfully in the centre of the table instead, so tall they almost blocked their view of the girls on the other side. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the sort of place I\u2019d normally expect you to choose, though. It\u2019s kind of romantic, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk didn\u2019t comment, simply passing the menu over. Kim Dokja opened it and let out a low whistle. \u201cThe prices, too,\u201d he added. \u201cHey, you\u2019re paying right, Yoo Joonghyuk?\u201d\nShameless. \u201cYes.\u201d\nKim Dokja had the nerve to order the second most expensive thing on the menu. Inconsistent bastard.\n\u201cRevenge for laser tag,\u201d he told the girls with faux solemnness. \u201cYou should both order dessert too.\u201d\nYoo Mia grinned at him, and did exactly that.\nThey dawdled over lunch, soaking in the ambience and lingering over coffee and tiny artisanal cakes, until the girls finally grew restless enough to demand they move on. Yoo Joonghyuk shooed them ahead as he went to pay the bill.\nLunch was followed by a whirlwind tour of the Fantasy Land area, peppered with rides and snacks and soon, photos, as Yoo Mia and Shin Yoosung demanded their pictures in front of every other attraction as the sun set and the park became filled with fairy lights and twisted neon glows.\n\u201cI want one with oppa, too,\u201d Yoo Mia said. Yoo Joonghyuk obligingly leaned in so she could snap a selfie with the miniature castle lit up in the background. \u201cOppa, would it kill you to smile?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t smile either,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t.\u201d\nThey wandered the park a bit more, admiring the lights, when Shin Yoosung suggested, excited, \u201cWait! We should take a group photo in front of the globe! It\u2019s the most recognisable part, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Kim Dokja offered, already flourishing his phone.\nYoo Joonghyuk grabbed his arm, then flagged down one of the nearby staff \u2013 who seemed to be loitering for just that purpose. There was no hint of recognition in their eyes when he unhooked his face mask, so he asked, \u201cCan you take a photo for us?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! Everyone gather up!\u201d With fake cheer, the staff member waited for them to get into position. Yoo Joonghyuk dragged Kim Dokja in, arm around his shoulders, the two girls doing the same, flashing peace signs. The shutter sound went off several times, the staff member offered the phone back, and everyone gathered around to view the results.\n\u201cAh, Mia, you\u2019re blinking here!\u201d Yoosung laughed. \u201cOh, but this one is good! Everyone\u2019s eyes are open! And your brother is almost smiling, see? This one is definitely the best. Joonghyuk-ahjussi, can you send me a copy of this too?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send it to Mia, and she can share it with you,\u201d he promised, fiddling with his phone one handed. Mia\u2019s phone beeped a moment later.\nKim Dokja peered at the picture too, still trapped by Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s arm. \u201cDid you just make it your lock screen?\u201d He grinned at him. \u201cYou big sap. You\u2019re such a doting big brother. Hey, send it to me too.\u201d\nA few more taps on his phone, and Kim Dokja was happily going through his own photos. Yoo Joonghyuk reluctantly let his arm fall away as Yoo Mia tugged on his coat.\n\u201cOppa, when\u2019s the fireworks? Let\u2019s get a good spot,\u201d she urged him.\n\u201cOh oh, over here Mia! There\u2019s good seats over here! Look they even cleared the snow away!\u201d Yoosung waved, already running for the desired bench.\nYoo Joonghyuk doubted there was going to be crowds enough on a cold winter\u2019s day, even on the weekend, to rob them of a view, but it wasn\u2019t that long until the show anyway. He settled onto the middle of the bench with Mia \u2013 Yoosung squeezing in next to his sister on the end, and Kim Dokja squirming into the last gap left next to Yoo Joonghyuk, leaving them shoulder to shoulder, legs pressed together from thigh to knee. \u201cCozy,\u201d he remarked with a wry grin, but he didn\u2019t complain when Yoo Joonghyuk lifted his arm again and dropped it on his shoulders - instead turning his attention to his phone, snapping another candid picture of the park lit up.\nYoo Joonghyuk tapped his other hand against his thigh restlessly as they waited for the fireworks to begin. Yoo Mia smirked at him. \u201cOppa\u2019s in a good mood.\u201d\n\u201cHuh, how can you tell Mia?\u201d Yoosung asked.\n\u201cEhhh, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d\nWhatever else Yoosung had been about to say was cut off by the music swelling in the park speakers, and the first pop of light in the dusky evening sky. It sparkled, with reds and greens and oranges and yellows, bursts of air followed by the soft sizzle of fire and light and the crowd\u2019s collective gasps of awe and glee.\nOut of the corner of his vision, Yoo Joonghyuk watched the play of coloured light flash against Kim Dokja\u2019s pale skin and twinkle in his eyes, and had the thought that if he could make that moment last for an eternity, he would.\nHe sighed to himself.\n\u201cSomething the matter?\u201d Kim Dokja prodded his cheek with a finger.\n\u201cJust sad the day is ending,\u201d he said, truthfully.\nKim Dokja grinned at him, and Yoo Joonghyuk felt something in chest unfurl, warm and content. \u201cGod, you really are a sap, actually? I can\u2019t believe you said something that cheesy with such a serious face.\u201d He faced forward again, expression faintly wistful as the fireworks peppered the sky above their heads. \u201cI kind of agree, though. This was really nice. Thanks for bringing me along, Yoo Joonghyuk.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk tightened his arm, just a fraction, and was gratified when Kim Dokja didn\u2019t react beyond shifting slightly to get more comfortable.\nIt was the last week of winter.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFive days after the theme park excursion found Yoo Joonghyuk digging through his wardrobe \u2013 a full half of which had been overtaken by Kim Dokja\u2019s clothes. Which wasn\u2019t an issue normally, but these days if it wasn\u2019t his normal wear, he had no idea where anything was.\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Kim Dokja asked, leaning against his bedroom door. He squinted at him. \u201cAre you wearing your dress clothes?\u201d\n\u201cAwards ceremony tonight,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk explained.\n\u201cAh. I remember. So you have a hot date for it then or-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk paused long enough to give him a withering glance. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to come along.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to go Minosoft\u2019s awards ceremonies, why would I go to someone else\u2019s glorified work party?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk shrugged it off. Kim Dokja was an idiot, he already knew that. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a tie.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the tie. You only have one.\u201d Kim Dokja reached past him, to the shelf above his head, and dropped the green silk tie into his hands. \u201cAnd only one pair of slacks, and only one dress shirt, and only one jacket, which isn\u2019t even formal but because you\u2019ve got the shoulders of a gymnast you can turn business casual into all-occasions wear. I know you\u2019re a gamer but-\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, and pressed his lips fleetingly against his cheek as he took the tie and strode past to the bathroom. He pretended not to see Kim Dokja freeze, raising a furtive hand to his face, and focused instead on combing his hair.\nHe swept back into the living room, slipping his cards and phone into the inner pocket of his jacket, stuck his head into Yoo Mia\u2019s room to let her know he was leaving, then fetched his leather dress shoes from the shoe cupboard. Kim Dokja trailed after him, steps hesitant. There was the faintest dusting of pink still blooming in his cheeks, and his eyes didn\u2019t quite want to settle, darting to Yoo Joonghyuk before dancing away again. Still, he managed to ask, \u201cAre you going to be warm enough in just the jacket?\nYoo Joonghyuk paused, hand on the door, for a beat too long. \u201cI\u2019ll only be outside for a few moments,\u201d he eventually answered. It was only a couple of days until Spring, after all \u2013 the days weren\u2019t quite as cold as they had been. \u201cThanks for keeping Mia company.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain she\u2019ll hate it and spend the whole time in her room,\u201d Kim Dokja reassured him, words more confident as they settled back on more familiar ground. \u201cBut I\u2019ll make sure she eats something other than snacks for dinner, at least.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk nodded. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably run late. Don\u2019t wait up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpring heralded change. Yoo Joonghyuk knew that instinctively \u2013 had been pushing the matter, perhaps, with the spectre of winter\u2019s end threatening to upset the extremely comfortable status quo they had found themselves in. In the end, though, it was his little sister\u2019s blunt words that finally upended their routine.\nOne week into spring, when the snow had started to melt but the nights were still cold, they had spicy beef noodle soup for dinner. The appetising scent lingered in the kitchen even after they\u2019d finished eating. Kim Dokja cleaned the empty dishes from the table, while Yoo Joonghyuk had started making pudding for tomorrow\u2019s dessert.\nYoo Mia flounced back into the kitchen, waving a form in her hands. \u201cOppa, you have to sign this.\u201d\n\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk promised, in the middle of mixing.\nShe rocked back on her heels, waiting and watching impatiently. Her gaze caught on Kim Dokja wiping down the kitchen table. \u201cOppa, since you\u2019re dating, can this ugly ahjussi sign my form?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk added a little more butter to the mix, then a dash of vanilla. \u201cNot legally.\u201d\nKim Dokja sputtered. \u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cHnnnn.\u201d Yoo Mia shoved her form more insistently at her brother. \u201cYou sign it then.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk quickly washed his hands, and beckoned for the pen. He glanced over the form and scribbled out his signature in a careless sweep of someone far too used to giving autographs.\n\u201cThanks oppa!\u201d She skipped back to her room.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja started to say, visibly confused.\nYoo Joonghyuk poured the mixture into several prepared cups, covered them, and slipped them into the refrigerator. \u201cWe\u2019re not what?\u201d\n\u201cDating?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk raised an eyebrow, and folded his arms. \u201cThen what do you call it, fool?\u201d\n\u201cBut I- I\u2019m not-\u201d He looked lost. \u201cDating is\u2026 romantic dinners, right? And\u2026 night-time walks?\u201d\n\u201cAnd theme park trips?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked flatly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to come to the awards dinner. That\u2019s not my fault. Eating here is better anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s \u2013 that was for Mia-\u201d\n\u201cAnybody I choose to date has to deal with that fact that my kid sister comes first. You\u2019ve been good about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 how can we be dating? I just\u2026 sleep here. And eat here. And\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja paused, standing in the kitchen, cleaning cloth still hanging limply from his hands. \u201cI\u2026 haven\u2019t been in my apartment for\u2026 days?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk shifted, subtly, to block the doorway.\n\u201cAm I living here?\u201d Kim Dokja stared at him, the stirrings of panic in his eyes. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you-\u201d He whirled, looking around as though seeing everything for the first time. \u201cI\u2026 have my own slippers. My own mug. My own chopsticks and plate and towel\u2026\u201d He pointed an accusing finger at Yoo Joonghyuk. \u201cIt isn\u2019t even that cold at night anymore, why am I still sleeping in your bed?\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk raised an eyebrow, to say \u2018why do you think?\u2019\nKim Dokja started to pace in the narrow confines of the kitchen, trapped between the counter and the kitchen table, looking remarkably like a caged animal. \u201cBut we never \u2013 you never said anything!\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk scoffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking about it? Half of everything you say is a lie.\u201d\n\u201cI thought \u2013 I thought I was the weird one. But you! You stealth moved me into your apartment! Then acted like it was all normal! And there was all those times \u2013 I thought you were just joking! Or- I was right, wasn\u2019t I? It was weird!\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk shrugged, and looked away.\nHe wasn\u2019t unaware of what he was doing. He\u2019d taken Kim Dokja\u2019s contrary nature into account, and acted accordingly. That was to say, stealth moving his neighbour into his apartment hadn\u2019t exactly been planned, explicitly. It had mostly been Yoo Joonghyuk following a natural series of impulses to protect his idiot crush from himself. The rationalising came after.\nStill. \u201cIt\u2019s not weird if we\u2019re dating, fool.\u201d\nKim Dokja stopped his pacing, gesturing wildly. \u201cHow was I supposed to know that was dating? I didn\u2019t even know you liked men? Much less-\u201d He cut himself off.\n\u201cMuch less what?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked.\nKim Dokja voice this time was small. \u201cMuch less me.\u201d\nThis was annoying. \u201cKim Dokja, let me make it clear to you.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk stepped forward, curled a hand behind Kim Dokja\u2019s neck, and closed the distance between them.\nTheir lips met \u2013 Kim Dokja let out a faint gasp, and Yoo Joonghyuk pushed forward, until they were backed against the kitchen counter and Kim Dokja threw out a wild hand to brace himself.\nYoo Joonghyuk kissed him, deeply, pressing closer until their bodies were flush, and only once he felt Kim Dokja finally respond did he pull back \u2013 though kept his hand steady on his neck, thumb brushing his pulse point. Kim Dokja\u2019s cheeks were flushed, and his lips shiny with spit, and his eyes glistening with unshed tears.\nShit. Had he pushed it too far? Had he read his neighbour wrong? \u201cKim Dokja, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cIt- can\u2019t be real,\u201d he stuttered. \u201cIt never works out for me, something like this. Someone like me could never possibly even dream-\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk interrupted the words with another kiss. This time he didn\u2019t withdraw until Kim Dokja was left gasping for breath, both hands desperately gripping at his shirt, and unable to utter such stupid statements anymore.\nHe thought he could guess, anyway. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout your past.\u201d At Kim Dokja\u2019s shocked inhale, he huffed. \u201cWhat, isn\u2019t it normal to look up your neighbour on the internet? You\u2019re the one who told me that.\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t looked until after the trip to the theme park, truthfully, when he\u2019d felt that time was running short and Kim Dokja\u2019s bizarre lack of normal socialisation had become too strong to ignore. It hadn\u2019t been at all what he expected \u2013 it was much more melodramatic and upsetting - but it had explained enough. The insistence on living alone even when he clearly couldn\u2019t afford it. The lack of friends and family. His fear of falling. And his completely misplaced belief that he would never be allowed anything good.\n\u201cThen-\u201d Kim Dokja started to say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about any of it. It\u2019s not important. Anyone who does care is a stupid fool.\u201d He cradled his face, holding him close, so that he couldn\u2019t look away, and said seriously, \u201cKim Dokja. You can stay. Even when you\u2019re being annoying, even when you\u2019re being an idiot. I want you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 sunfish bastard\u2026 didn\u2019t even ask me if I wanted to\u2026\u201d Kim Dokja mumbled, face bright red and eyes watering.\nYoo Joonghyuk pushed a strand of loose hair back behind the shell of his ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cGod, all this time\u2026 I thought I was such garbage. For even daring to think about it.\u201d He laughed, then, though it was strangled. \u201cTurns out I was just wasting time?\u201d\nThen he slid a hand into Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hair, and tugged him forward again, mashing their mouths together hungrily.\nThey might have kept going, if Yoo Mia didn\u2019t choose that moment to open her door. They broke apart, right as she padded back into the kitchen.\n\u201cUgh, were you kissing?\u201d Yoo Mia asked. \u201cGross. Oppa, I want juice.\u201d\nKim Dokja made a strangled sound, and escaped to the living room. Yoo Joonghyuk let him go, since he could keep an eye on him there, and it was the opposite direction to the front door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for juice. You can either have milk or tea,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said, opening the cupboards to fetch her favourite mug.\nHis little sister scrunched up her nose, and decided, \u201cMilk.\u201d\nYoo Joonghyuk nodded, and flicked on the stove, ready to warm it up. Yoo Mia rocked back on her heels, waiting, and glanced over at Kim Dokja. \u201cWhy\u2019s the ugly ahjussi dying on the couch?\u201d\n\u201cHe figured out we were dating.\u201d\nYoo Mia looked unimpressed. \u201cI never realised you were stupid as well as ugly, ahjussi.\u201d\nKim Dokja made a sound like a dying cat. Yoo Mia wasn\u2019t swayed, peering at her brother judgmentally. \u201cI still don\u2019t get what you see in him, but since he makes you happy, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She paused, and added, rather magnanimously, \u201cAnd he folds my clothes nice.\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t mind if he moves in permanently?\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk asked, setting the milk to warm.\n\u201cI thought he already had anyway.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t I have a say in this?\u201d Kim Dokja\u2019s voice, muffled by cushions, floated to them.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the two siblings said in unison.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTwo days later, the corner of Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s bedroom contained a small bookshelf stuffed full of odd-shaped books and magazines, and his closet hid a worn backpack in the corner. The linen cupboard had likewise gained a new rolled up bed mat and plain blanket.\nFinishing moving Kim Dokja in had taken about eight minutes.\n\u201cOf course it did,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk said. \u201cYou had all of ten things in your apartment to begin with.\u201d And his entire wardrobe had already migrated into Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s over the past three months. Along with his phone charger. And his toiletries.\nKim Dokja blushed furiously, though it might have been less the remark and more Yoo Joonghyuk\u2019s hand resting low on his hip. Still, instead of freezing, now he stepped into the loose embrace, even if it was to argue his point. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford movers! When I first moved here I had to bring it all on the subway.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Well, you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk ducked his head, pressing his lips briefly against Kim Dokja\u2019s neck.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Though I still can\u2019t believe I actually get to shack up with my hot and famous neighbour,\u201d Kim Dokja said, though the words were accompanied by a pleased smirk as he tilted his head, inviting Yoo Joonghyuk with better access. Kim Dokja was rapidly progressing from astronomically embarrassed to extremely self-satisfied by the whole affair, in fact, stopping just shy of pretending it was his idea in the first place.\n\u201cNot your neighbour anymore,\u201d Yoo Joonghyuk corrected, and took the invitation by kicking the bedroom door shut behind them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
