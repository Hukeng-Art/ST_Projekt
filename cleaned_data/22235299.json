    "text": "\u201cLadybug?\u201d\nParis\u2019 spotted heroine jumped slightly after being pulled from her thoughts. She\u2019d been staring out over the city\u2019s glittering lights, lost to the maelstrom of voices and recalled memories swarming her mind with a thoughtful (at least she hoped it was) frown on her lips. So much so, that she hadn\u2019t noticed when her leather-clad partner had shown up to sit next to her on a night he was supposed to be taking off.\nWhen the hell had he gotten there?\u00a0She wondered, looking around quickly for any indication of how long she\u2019d been stuck in her own head.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Chaton, what are you doing out here? It\u2019s my night to patrol.\u201d She asked as another entirely panicked thought came to mind - that she\u2019d been so dazed she\u2019d missed the tell-tale signs of an Akuma.\nBut, before she could freak out any further, she took in Chat\u2019s relative ease - or at least, he didn\u2019t look like he was on the verge of jumping into a fight. He did seem apprehensive, though. She could tell in the way it tensed and squeezed his shoulders together like he wanted to be close, but wouldn\u2019t dare come in contact with her.\nWhich made her wonder if she\u2019d said or done anything recently to give him the idea he was overstepping his bounds. Or maybe he was mad at her for something? And wasn\u2019t that just the icing on the cake that was her day?\u00a0\nFirst, Lila had caused a major scene that got Marinette detention for the rest of the week (it all happened so fast, she barely remembers what the hell had even happened). Now she was having a panic attack over whether her partner was mad at her for something she didn\u2019t remember doing? Who else was she going to piss off today?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your stance on sharing your identity?\u201d\nPanic attack on momentary pause, a dark brow shot up at the question, and if she wasn\u2019t so wary of the way he\u2019d said it with that uncomfortable look on his face, she probably would have been angry. But he seemed so off tonight that it was throwing her usual emotions for a loop. So, choosing not to go off on her partner, she sighed heavily, trying to keep her focus on him despite the bubbling irritation,\u00a0\u201cChat, I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve talked about this. Our identities are a secret for a reason.\u201d\nFor the first time since he sat down (she thinks), she sees him glance her way if only slightly. The uncomfortable look on his face had softened a bit but he still has something unreadable in his eyes that makes Ladybug anxious,\u00a0\u201cSo... you\u2019ve never shared your identity? With anyone? Not accidentally or otherwise?\u201d\nIf she didn\u2019t know any better, she\u2019d say his words were a little accusatory.\u00a0\nWhich, okay first off, what the fuck? And second, why was he suddenly giving her the third degree?\u00a0\nAgain, though, the entire display was throwing her and she knew she had to be rational about this.\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Of course not. I promised you didn\u2019t I? Once Hawkmoth was defeated, you would be the first person I told.\u201d She stated as calmly and resolutely as she possibly can. She\u2019d been clear from the start where she stood on the subject.\u00a0\nAs soon as the words left her mouth, Chat Noir visibly relaxed. Shoulders slumping and a breath heaving from his chest as he nodded,\u00a0\u201cRight. Right, of course.\u201d He finally managed to turn to look at her and the discomfort was quickly hidden by a small smile.\nThe shift in his attitude was almost as disconcerting as his arrival.\n\u201cWhat is this about, Chatton?\u201d\nThat smile faltered a bit as he looked away from her again,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s this-\u201d he began but his words died before he shook his head,\u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s - it\u2019s nothing. Sorry for bothering you about this. It was stupid.\u201d\u00a0\nChat made to stand, but Ladybug caught his wrist before he could get away,\u00a0\u201cObviously not if it brought you out here as upset as you looked. I know I can be a real stickler about the secret identities thing, but Chat, I\u2019m not doing this to hurt you. I promise!\u201d She implored, feeling like she\u2019d missed something major.\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re being hurt or-\u201d\nBlonde hair flew as he shook his head quickly,\u00a0\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Really. I know why you do. I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t suck, but I get it. Really, I do.\u201d He tried to assure her, and while it did seem like he understood and he was being honest with her, he was still hiding something. Something that had driven him to come out and ask her these strange questions.\n\u201cThen what was all of this about?\u201d\nHe had the decency to look apologetic at least as the corners of his mouth pulled up and he shook his head again,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too personal - talking about it might give me away, Bugaboo, but I really am sorry about this. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d\nLadybug\u2019s eyes darted back and forth as she watched him closely, but eventually, hesitantly, she let go of his wrist and allowed him to get up.\nThe whole conversation left an unsettling anxiousness over her and a rather uncomfortable tenseness in the air between them as he backed away and saluted before she even had the chance to say anything - disappearing into the night.\nThat unease followed her home and through her restless sleep and when she woke up the next morning, she couldn\u2019t help but let it consume her thoughts. Distracting her as she made her way to class earlier than usual.\nDistracting her so much, in fact, that she almost didn\u2019t notice the crowd gathered around two individuals crammed into her usual seat next to Alya giggling and talking loudly.\nAlmost.\nAs much as she hated it, Marinette had developed something of a sixth sense for the Italian exchange student Lila Rossi. A personal radar to warn her of the liar\u2019s presence.\nAnd it was going off big time.\nIt wasn\u2019t uncommon for Lila to try and steal her spot when she could. Usually, it resulted in some sort of argument between Marinette and Alya when her supposed best friend defended the other girl for just wanting to hang out, and why didn\u2019t she try being nice to the girl for once?\nThis time, though, Marinette was quickly made aware of three things:\n1. Lila wasn\u2019t alone.\n2. Whoever this other girl was, she and Lila were already very close and that didn\u2019t bode well for anyone - especially Marinette.\n3. Adrien, who was an unfortunate captive in the crowd around his desk, looked really uncomfortable - more so than usual as he openly frowned at the desktop in front of him, trying not to associate with the things going on around him.\nWhat the hell was going on? Marinette had only been gone from class for one afternoon!\u00a0\nAlya was the first to notice her entrance to the class, giving her an unsure look from her seat (she had been pretty mad at her yesterday for whatever it was that landed her detention for the week), causing a ripple effect as Lila and her\u00a0\u2018guest\u2019 looked up at her too, quieting down and catching everyone else\u2019 attention.\nThe unfamiliar girl sized the noirette up before speaking,\u00a0\u201cIs this the girl you were telling me about?\u201d\nLila put on her biggest, fakest, puppy-dog eyes and nodded softly, watching Marinette like she might lunge at her any second now.\u00a0\nLike parting the red sea, the unfamiliar girl stood from her place at Marinette\u2019s desk and the crowd around her gave her room to move, allowing her to make her way to stand haughtily before her. The girl was a tad taller than Marinette, but the platform sandals she wore made it so Marinette would need to look up at her slightly. She had dark, almost black, shoulder-length hair that hung loosely, but the color of her brows made it clear that it wasn\u2019t natural. She\u2019d dyed it, recently too, if the lack of root discoloration was any indication.\nMarinette watched her approach with a raised brow, unimpressed by the superior gleam to the girl\u2019s blue-green eyes.\n\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend.\u201d She said, authoritatively, her hands propped on hips clad in\u00a0Gabriel\u00a0branded jeans.\nThere was a collective gasp among her classmates like this was some big reveal in a soap opera.\u00a0\nThe class rep merely blinked a moment, brow still raised because who the fuck even was this girl and why was she squaring up to her like she even had a chance? Actually, no, she didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you?\u201d Marinette asked, but her tone gave away how few fucks she actually gave about the girl\u2019s answer.\n\u201cFor your information, it\u2019s Bianca. I just transferred yesterday. But don\u2019t change the subject. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend Lila.\u201d\nBefore Bianca had a chance to say any more, Marinette gave her a deadpanned look,\u00a0\u201cWell, sorry to inform you, but your best friend is a liar.\u201d\nLila could immediately be heard breaking out into sobs somewhere in the background but Marinette was quickly losing interest in this conversation.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she is. I think you\u2019re the liar. In fact, I think people like you are what\u2019s wrong with Paris. Always trying to hurt others so they get Akumatized and I have to clean up your mess.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what?\u00a0\n\nThat had Bluebell eyes snapping to focus on the girl in front of her. Interest piqued.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you one chance. Stop being a menace to society or\u00a0my partner\u00a0and I will take action.\u201d\nThere was quite a bit to unpack from that. Like... a lot. Menace to society? Partner? Take action?\nWho did this girl think she was?\u00a0Ladybug?\nThe one thing that seemed clear to Marinette after reviewing the word choices in her own head a few times, was that this was not a friendly recommendation.\n\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\nShe probably should have sounded a little angrier. In fact, anything would have been better than bored. But she just couldn\u2019t find the energy.\u00a0\nA triumphant smile spread over Bianca\u2019s face, as she disregarded the lack of fear in Marinette\u2019s voice,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t threaten people. But that is a promise.\u201d\nMarinette was left to blink at her a little longer.\u00a0\nBecause what even was happening here? What on earth had she done that the universe saw fit to drop this steaming pile of bull on her morning?\nAnd why did it feel like the girl was hinting at something she wasn\u2019t picking up on? Why was her body telling her that she needed to react while her brain was taking its sweet time to catch up with everything?\n\u201cDude,\u201d someone from the peanut gallery stage whispered, finding it in their heart to give her a helping hand,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s Ladybug!\u201d\nLila shushed them loudly,\u00a0\u201cGuys, not everyone is supposed to know! We don\u2019t know who we can trust!\u201d\n\nOh.\n\n\noohhhhh!\n\nWow. When she\u2019d made that comment in her head before, she\u2019d been joking but... seriously? Did she really just?\n\u201cYou\u2019re Ladybug?\u201d Marinette asked, wanting to clarify and make absolutely certain that she hadn\u2019t just imagined that last forty-five seconds of her life.\nBianca\u2019s chin raised, literally looking down her nose at Marinette,\u00a0\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t share that information with someone like you.\u201d\nBehind her, Adrien stood from his seat looking absolutely livid, but Marinette barely had a moment to even register the malice in the gaze he pointed at Bianca before -\u00a0\n\nPfft...\n\nMarinette covered her mouth with her hand to stop it, but nothing could hold back the onslaught now.\u00a0\nThey were giggles at first, tumbling from her in waves as she tried to clear her throat and treat this seriously. But before long, she couldn\u2019t help it. She was laughing out loud, doubling over, completely ignorant (maybe not completely, but she didn\u2019t care at this point) to the looks of confusion on the faces around her.\nShe made the mistake of looking back up at Bianca and that only renewed her laughing fit until it literally brought her to her knees, clutching her sides as she laughed so hard she cried.\n\nFucking cried.\n\nIt was a solid five or six minutes before she could breathe again. Sitting back up, wiping the tears from her eyes, she beamed at the girl standing awkwardly before her,\u00a0\u201cWow. Thanks. I really needed that.\u201d\nShe cleared her throat, clearly unsure of the strange behavior. She couldn\u2019t blame her for that. \u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny.\u201d\n\u201cAll of it. Really.\u201d She stood up from the floor, making a show of dusting off her pants before turning her full attention back on the girl.\u00a0\nBecause this was going to be fun.\n\u201cSo, Ladybug, tell me this; if I\u2019m such a menace to society, why would you entrust me with a miraculous?\u201d\nBianca's smirk faltered, her eyes darting over to Lila for a moment, both of them looking a little lost for words. As was everyone else for that matter.\nEven Alya, whose mouth hung open at this revelation. But the reporter flew to her phone, swiping quickly, \"when?! There were no new heroes! How do we know you're not lying?\"\nOh good. They were playing right into it. One thing you could always count on with sheeple... they always follow.\n\"Huh, well, then I guess if you can\u2019t believe me at my word, it would be pretty easy to fact check.\" Her tone was a bit forced on those words and the reporter had the decency to look taken aback, \"You could always just ask Ladybug, here.\"\n\"Well I-\"\n\"Or you could ask her\u00a0partner. Seeing as how he saw me transform.\"\nBianca's mouth snapped shut. It was still hit or miss whether or not Marinette was bluffing. And it's easy to claim something like that when the only other person who could confirm or deny the facts was not present.\nThis had been Lila\u2019s game the whole time. The difference was, Marinette wasn\u2019t lying.\nBut neither of them could take that chance.\nBecause neither of them knew what she knew.\nAnd Ladybug was definitely in this room, but it wasn\u2019t who they all thought it was.\n\"I asked her to give you a chance. Because I wanted to help you. I thought being a hero would make you a better person. But you just kept bullying me!\"\n\"E-exactly.\"\nAh, so they were going to go this route, hmm? She could work with that. And given Lila\u2019s proclivity for being Akumatized, maybe she could mess with Hawkmoth too while she was at it.\u00a0\nBecause it was only a matter of time before\u00a0someone\u00a0was targeted.\n\"How very generous of you, Lila,\" She said in her sweetest voice possible, but even to her own ears, it sounded fake. How did Lila keep this up all the time?\u00a0\u201cBut, that\u2019s not what you said on the tower when we fought that Akuma together.\u201d\n\"What did you think I would say when you were obviously unfit to be a Hero! I didn\u2019t want to risk you turning on me.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was unfit when I helped save you and Chat Noir.\u201d This time, it felt a little more realistic when she put the hurt look on her face, glancing away.\nIn the process, she caught sight of Adrien giving her a strange look. One she couldn\u2019t really put a name to. But it was different than all of her other classmates. Why did he seem so much more confused than the others?\u00a0\nThe girl scoffed, \"leave my partner out of this.\" She demanded, and it felt like a desperate attempt at redirecting the conversation.\u00a0\nFine. She could work with that too.\n\"You... do know that your 'partner' is my best friend, right?\" She turned an apologetic look to Alya she only half meant, \"sorry Als, but - you know,\" Marinette pointed between the two of them indicating the distance that had grown between them. They weren't nearly as close as they'd used to be. And while they were still friends, Marinette had a hard time categorizing her as her 'best friend'.\nAnd the implication wasn't wasted on the reporter either. She was left staring wide with bewilderment and hurt. But Marinette was less positive it was because of not being best friends anymore and more that she hadn't told Alya that she spent time with one of the heroes she loved to chase.\n\"My partner would never hang out with someone like you.\"\nGod, she was just a broken record, wasn\u2019t she? Did she really still think she was bluffing?\nWith a scoff and a soft shake of her head, Marinette pulled her phone from her pocket and swiped through her pictures until she found what she was looking for.\nShe wasnt trying to be smug about the way she flipped her phone around so she could show the class, but she definitely couldn't help the little smirk that pulled at her lips as the class gasped again, pulling closer so they could study the photo.\nA photo of her and Chat Noir sitting a little too close together on her chaise lounge. Marinette sticking her tongue out at the camera, while chat gave the overly kawaii victory peace sign over his left eye like he was straight out of an anime. It was one of her favorites. They'd spent nearly the whole night binging on shows together after a particularly stressful day. The pictures had been a side effect of too much sugar, not enough sleep, and good company. And for some reason when Chat found out she\u2019d been Multimouse, that increased her\u00a0\u2018coolness factor\u2019 and they had something in common.\nOf course, she couldn\u2019t tell him that wasn\u2019t the only thing they had in common.\nEither way, it had brought them closer together as friends and they hung out often.\u00a0\nWhich was a reprieve given that most of her friends had abandoned her anyway.\u00a0\nAs Bianca stared a little blankly at the picture, a number of voices all began to pick up around them.\n\"You're actually friends with chat noir? That's so cool!\"\n\u201cDoes that mean you hang out with the other heroes too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is Chat Noir really like?\u201d\n\"Wait, then that means you really were a hero? I thought heroes had to keep their identities secret.\"\nThat\u2019s the one she\u2019d been waiting on. Quickly silencing the others with a pointed look back at Bianca,\u00a0\"They do. But I'm not a hero anymore, am I Ladybug?\"\n\"I-I...\"\n\"Why was it again that I\u2019m not allowed to be Multimouse again?\" She put a thoughtful finger to her chin, but she felt her own fire building in her core,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was nothing to do with being a menace to society.\u201d\nShe tapped her chin a few more times, looking around\u00a0deep in thought. Catching another glimpse of Adrien studying her carefully, but she refused to let his perfectness distract her because fuck these people.\nFuck the high road.\nIf he was going to be mad at her for standing up for her alter-ego then fuck him too.\nBut he didn\u2019t seem mad.\u00a0\nIn fact, as soon as she locked eyes with him, a slight smirk pulled at his lips. It was roguish and totally out of place on his angelic face, but goddamn did it do things for her.\nBut the smirk paired with the slightly raised brow aimed at her said,\u00a0\u2018Yes, what\u00a0did\u00a0Ladybug say?\u2019\nIt\u2019s sarcastic and playful and familiar in ways her heart is not ready to admit.\nBut that would have to come later.\nMarinette spun back to the imposter, narrowing her eyes dangerously, \"Oh right! Because I'd accidentally revealed my identity to Chat Noir. Because identities are supposed to remain a secret.\"\n\"W-well th-there are exceptions!\" Bianca tries to defend, but Marinette isn\u2019t going to let her.\n\u201cNo, I think you, just like your supposed best friend, are a liar. You\u2019re not Ladybug. You don\u2019t know a damn thing about Ladybug. Because if you were, you\u2019d already have been beaten. You\u2019ve been in this classroom all of what, one day? And the entire class already knows your\u00a0\u2018identity\u2019? We\u2019re all lucky you aren\u2019t one of the heroes, otherwise, Hawkmoth would already have won!\u201d\nShe was fuming now. All of the emotions finally catching up with her. She thrust an accusatory finger at Bianca, making the girl stumble back slightly,\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about what it takes to be a hero. What they have to sacrifice to keep people safe. Besides, Ladybug and Chat Noir don\u2019t even know each other's identities - why the hell would\u00a0Ladybug\u00a0share something like that with a classroom full of people who\u2019ve been Akumatized at least once and not share that with her own partner?!\u201d\nWhatever fear she\u2019d instilled in the new girl quickly swapped for something much closer to fury as she reclaimed her balance and advanced on Marinette with a fire burning in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you call me a liar, you little fucking brat!\u201d\u00a0\nSurprised at the outburst, Marinette didn\u2019t move when she saw Bianca raise her hand to strike her, instead, closing her eyes and bracing for the blow.\nA blow that never connected.\u00a0\nA gasp brought Marinette to peak open her eyes before they widened at the scene.\nBianca stood where she had previously, hand raised and poised to strike. But just behind her, Adrien had moved - impossibly quick, seriously when the hell had she gotten up? - and grabbed the girl\u2019s arm, hand clutching tightly at her, keeping her still.\n\u201cA-Adrien!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He hissed at her, voice low and threatening.\u00a0\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear before, it definitely is now. You\u2019re not Ladybug. She would never raise a hand to a civilian like that!\u201d\n\u201cB-but - !\u201d Lila tried to come to her\u00a0\u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 defense but was silenced when he shot her an equally terrifying look.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you trying to turn everyone against Marinette. I knew you both were lying when you\u00a0\u2018accidentally\u2019 revealed Ladybug\u2019s identity to me yesterday, but I didn\u2019t have proof to prove it. You\u2019ve been lying to everyone about everything!\u201d\nWait... The way he\u2019d said accidentally... why did it seem so familiar?\u00a0\nHer thoughts of the blonde-haired, green-eyed model were very suddenly replaced with thoughts of a similarly blonde-haired, green-eyed superhero who\u2019d come looking for her on his night off, asking if she\u2019d ever\u00a0\u2018revealed herself, accidentally or otherwise\u2019.\n\u201cAdrien! Y-you\u2019re hurting me!\u201d\nMarinette\u2019s eyes were drawn to the boy\u2019s hand, still tightly clutching Bianca\u2019s in a vice grip that would likely leave bruises.\nBut that\u2019s not what she was focused on. Instead, it was the familiar shape of his silver ring that drew her eye. Familiar because she\u2019d seen him wear it since the first day she\u2019d met him and never took it off.\u00a0\nExcept for the day they\u2019d done the shoot for her website.\n\nThe day she and Chat had to switch Miraculouses.\n\nAdrien.\nAdrien was Chat Noir.\nHer kitty had been there the entire time.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019d been so angry. That\u2019s why he\u2019d looked so upset. That\u2019s why he\u2019d come looking for her and asking such strange questions!\nBecause Lila and her lackey had chosen the one person who\u2019d know for a fact that they were lying.\nAnd if she thought she couldn\u2019t love him any more than she already did, she was\u00a0sorely\u00a0mistaken.\n\u201cWhat is going on in here?!\u201d\nGreat. of course the teacher would walk in then.\nShe didn\u2019t pay much attention to the chaos that ensued after Madame Bustier had walked in the room. Lila and Bianca had claimed Marinette attacked and Adrien had stepped in to help her and they were both sent to the hall because a number of people started speaking up and coming to their defense, suddenly not blinded by Lila\u2019s lies any longer.\nBut now, she was standing in the hall next to her crush and\u00a0her partner.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Marinette.\u201d\nHer thoughts came to a startling halt as she turned wide eyes on him.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have ever told you not to call her out. I was stupid. I just hope you\u2019ll forgive me someday.\u201d\nMarinette couldn\u2019t help the smile that pulled at her lips, because how could she not have noticed? Model or not, that was the heart of her partner beating in that beautiful body of his.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, Adrien. Besides, at least you checked your sources.\u201d She chuckled, finding so much irony in that statement. If he hadn\u2019t come looking for her, she probably wouldn\u2019t have put it together.\nHe turned a confused look on her.\nThe smile she turned on him in return was brighter than she\u2019d given anyone in some time,\u00a0\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? You\u2019d be the first to know.\u201d\n\n\nAdrien.exe has stopped working.\n\n\n\n\nYour Adrien ran into a problem and needs to restart. We\u2019re just collecting some error info, and then we\u2019ll restart for you.\n\n\n\n\n0% Complete.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Adrien Agreste was having a - maybe not terrible, but certainly not a \n\ngreat day\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nBeing yanked from bed at zero-dark-thirty for a surprise photoshoot after being up half the night catching up on homework from the previous day was bound to put him in a sour mood.\n\n\n\u00a0\nThen, getting to school to find the class in disarray after some sort of drama had unfolded, landing one of his closest friends kicked out of class for the rest of the afternoon and in detention for the rest of the week certainly didn\u2019t make his mood any better.\n\n\nAnd of course, this new drama had left the class divided over said friend\u2019s supposed change in character.\n\n\n\n10% Complete\n\n\n\n\nWhat a load of bull.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeople didn\u2019t just change like that. Not really. And Marinette wasn\u2019t the type of person to \u2018fake\u2019 being nice just so she could get away with bullying someone else. Marinette wasn\u2019t a bully, \n\nperiod\n\n.\n\n\nAnd okay, maybe he didn\u2019t know Marinette all that well, at least as Adrien, but he knew her well enough as Chat Noir to know that the only change in character around here worth being worried over was the addition of a liar to their class hell-bent on making things miserable.\n\n\nThis was really getting out of hand.\n\n\nHe\u2019d recommended Marinette to take the high road because, at the time, it had been harmless white lies. Things meant to make the new girl look more important than she actually was. Some misguided attempt to make friends in a new place. He could sympathize with that.\n\n\nSure, some of the lies were maybe not as harmless - claiming to be Ladybug\u2019s best friend was just asking for trouble, but he was sure \n\nthat\n\n one was going to come back to bite her quickly enough that she\u2019d learn that maybe putting herself on blast when a magical terrorist was out there, \n\nwas a bad idea\n\n.\n\n\n\n12% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Adrien!\u201d\n\n\nInwardly, the model had groaned, suppressing an eye roll as best he could.\n\n\n\nSpeak of the devil and she shall appear.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d wanted to spend his rare lunch at school - fielding drama from none other than the resident liar herself. But, before he\u2019d been able to make a move, take a bite, pick up a book - anything to indicate he was too busy to give her the time of day, Lila Rossi had placed herself directly in his space on the bench next to him, cuddling up way too close to be considered anything but sexual harassment.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet!\u201d she\u2019d sung a little too happily - especially given the civil war she\u2019d caused in the classroom.\n\n\nIf Adrien hadn\u2019t been so focused on the \n\n\u2018Bad touch! Bad touch!\u2019\n\n going off in his head, he might have noticed the other girl standing before him with a presence that, once acknowledged, demanded attention.\n\n\n\n20% Complete\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHi, Adrien. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d The unfamiliar girl smiled, something in her eyes flashing something that he caught, but couldn\u2019t really understand, \u201cWell, officially, at least.\u201d She chuckled to herself at some sort of personal joke.\u00a0\n\n\nThe model eyed the girl for a while.\u00a0\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t look familiar. But he worked with and met lots of people all the time.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, have we met before?\u201d\n\n\nThe new girl flashed a small grin and conspiratorial look at Lila, \u201cYou... you could say that.\u201d\n\n\nLila cleared her throat from his side, \u201cThis is Bianca Esposito. She\u2019s just transferred into our class today from another school.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAh. So Lila was trying to corrupt them as they came in now?\n\n\nGreat. He could only hope this one would be quick to see the lies for what they were.\n\n\n\u201cJust transferred, huh?\u201d He tried to sound interested - because, despite Lila, this girl had done nothing to warrant his ire, and he wasn\u2019t about to drive her any further into Lila\u2019s clutches if he could help it. \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere, actually. I\u2019m from Paris. I was just at another school in the city. But something about this school made me want to transfer.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWas that a meaningful look she was giving him? She was putting a lot of unspoken emphasis behind her words that he wasn't really making a whole lot of sense of, \u201cOh yeah? Like what?\u201d\n\n\nHer smile broadened at being asked, \u201cWell my best friend, for one.\u201d She gestured to Lila with a look he\u2019d only ever seen Alya give Marinette when they\u2019d been the bestest of best friends. \u201cLila and I have been besties for a long time.\u201d\n\n\n\n25% Complete\n\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWell... that could either spell the end of all the stupid drama in the class as Lila had a \u2018true friend\u2019 to spend time with or could be the beginning of something far worse.\n\n\nThough, something deep down told him it was the latter.\n\n\nBianca studied him for a moment, looking between him and Lila who was still uncomfortably close, seeming torn about something before she sighed, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not really supposed to do this, but I wanted to apologize.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBianca! We talked about this!\u201d\n\n\nHe looked between the two of them, watching as they had some sort of unspoken conversation.\n\n\n\u201cNo, Lila. It wasn\u2019t right. I have to.\u201d Bianca gave her \u2018bestie\u2019 a stern look before she turned back to him, \u201cAdrien, one of the last times you and I,\u201d her eyes trailed away for a moment as if literally looking for the right words to say, \u201c\n\nmet\n\n - I acted really immaturely and said something I didn\u2019t mean. And I wanted to apologize for that.\u201d\n\n\nOkay - now he was really lost.\n\n\nBecause in no way did his memory include a confrontation with this girl. He may not remember every face and name, but he remembered confrontation. Mainly because of how often he tried to avoid it if possible.\u00a0\n\n\nSo what on earth was this girl talking about?\n\n\nHis confusion must have been written all over his face because she looked around to check for something before getting closer and dropping her voice, \u201cYou know - the park? I... I called Lila out saying we weren\u2019t friends?\u201d\n\n\nThat sounded familiar. His brain was working double-time to pick up what she was laying down for him. And it was not being very helpful.\n\n\nHe definitely remembered a confrontation happening like that. Someone had come to discredit Lila about being their best friend as well as a lie about being a superhero.\n\n\nBut that hadn\u2019t been this girl.\u00a0\n\n\nThat had been -\u00a0\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\n30% Complete\n\n\n\nUnderstanding registered in his gaze, eyes widening slightly, making the girl - \n\nBianca\n\n - chuckle, \u201cFigure it out? I guess it \n\nis \n\na little hard to recognize me, huh?\u201d\n\n\nSo many emotions whirled up on him at that moment.\u00a0\n\n\nSure - there was that little traitorous part of him that was immediately elated. Because maybe this was his Lady - there were only three people (that he knew of) who knew about what had happened in the park that day. And maybe this meant -\u00a0\n\n\nBut just as quickly as joy had filled his chest, so did a foreboding sense of distrust and betrayal. Because if that really was Ladybug who stood before him unmasked - she\u2019d broken her own golden rule. She\u2019d shared her identity with \n\nhim\n\n. Not \n\nChat Noir\n\n. And while they were the same person, Ladybug had promised Chat would be the first to know her identity. And this wasn\u2019t exactly what he\u2019d always pictured when he would eventually (hopefully) find out.\n\n\nThey hadn\u2019t defeated Hawkmoth.\n\n\nThis was not a moment of celebration between the partners who\u2019d sacrificed so much for the safety of the city.\n\n\nAnd never ever in his dreams of their reveal, was Lila Rossi \n\never\n\n present.\n\n\nNot to mention, Ladybug had made it abundantly clear how much she distrusted Lila. And okay, fine, maybe someone \n\ncould\n\n chalk that whole thing up to a spat between friends, but that wasn\u2019t like his lady at all.\u00a0\n\n\nAt least... he didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d come to know of her. She did some things that were maybe a little questionable sometimes, but so did he. But taking out her frustration on a friend using her powers? That wasn\u2019t like the Ladybug he knew.\n\n\nAnd Lila had made it clear she wasn\u2019t a fan of Ladybug either.\n\n\nSomething was \n\nvery\n\n wrong here.\n\n\nEither he didn\u2019t know Ladybug nearly as well as he\u2019d thought, or this was not Ladybug.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Like I said though, I'm not really supposed to be saying this.\" Her words had brought him out of his thoughts and back to reality as he watched her wink and put a finger to her lips.\n\n\n\u201cThen why did you?\u201d Adrien found himself asking because he could not confirm or deny anything yet. He couldn\u2019t trust his mouth to not say the things clouding his head.\n\n\n\u201cBecause I trust you, and I wanted to clear the air.\u201d She answered simply.\n\n\n\n35% Complete\n\n\n\nApparently, that \n\ntrust\n\n was extremely cheap to attain, because most if not all of the rest of his classmates knew before the end of the day. He would hear them whispering in lulls during class, hushed mentions of \u2018Ladybug\u2019 spreading like wildfire around the room.\n\n\nWhich had only soured his mood further.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like he minded if she shared her identity with people she trusted - but if this was the real Ladybug, she hadn\u2019t spoken a peep of this to Chat Noir. And there was that little voice in the back of his head constantly droning on and on about how this meant that he was nothing more than a sidekick to her.\u00a0\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t trust him.\u00a0\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t actually know her the way he thought.\n\n\nAnd lastly, but probably the most distressing: \n\nLadybug is a liar.\n\n\n\nBut he kept pushing those thoughts away in the hopes that this \n\nwasn\u2019t\n\n his lady. She wouldn\u2019t actually do something like this. She wouldn\u2019t discard him like this.\n\n\nHe had to believe that.\n\n\nHe had to trust that the Ladybug he had come to know was the truth.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s how he\u2019d come to the decision to drop in on her during her solo patrol.\n\n\nTo ask her point-blank.\n\n\n\n40% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cLadybug?\u201d\n\n\nParis\u2019 spotted heroine jumped slightly after being pulled from her thoughts. Her head whipped around quickly after seeing him sit next to her, looking out around them for something. Probably trying to figure out how long she\u2019d been zoning out for.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich was a while, actually, and on any other night and with literally anything else on his mind, he probably would have said something about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHey Chaton, what are you doing out here? It\u2019s my night to patrol.\u201d She asked, surprise filling her face and tone.\n\n\nWas this Bianca Esposito he was sitting next to? He found that he couldn\u2019t look at her right away. He couldn\u2019t look at her at all. And the build-up of anger and unease about this confrontation from the day made it hard to be in her presence.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he had to confirm it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your stance on sharing your identity?\u201d\n\n\nFor a moment, out of the corner of his eye, he saw her tense up and her face clouded with something close to anger herself. But after a moment of watching him, she\u2019d quickly swallowed that back and took a deep breath, \u201cChat, I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve talked about this. Our identities are a secret for a reason.\u201d\n\n\nThat sounded a lot more like the Ladybug he knew. He glanced her way, catching her staring at him. He was being unfairly suspicious of her. He knew that, but he\u2019d been fighting those daunting thoughts all day that she wanted nothing to do with him and it was hard to immediately drop that. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019ve never shared your identity? With anyone? Not accidentally or otherwise?\u201d\n\n\nA raised brow shot at him and maybe a little hurt in her own gaze as she stared back, \u201cNo. Of course not. I promised you didn\u2019t I? Once Hawkmoth was defeated, you would be the first person I told.\u201d She stated calmly and resolutely.\n\n\n\n43% Complete\n\n\n\nAs soon as the words left her mouth, Chat Noir felt himself relax fully. Shoulders slumping and a breath heaving from his chest as he nodded, \u201cRight. Right, of course.\u201d He finally managed to turn to look at her and the discomfort was quickly hidden by a small smile.\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019d been such an ass to her. And he felt so bad for being suspicious but this had been something he needed to tackle head-on at the source.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is this about, Chaton?\u201d\n\n\nThat smile faltered a bit as he looked away from her again, \u201cThere\u2019s this-\u201d he began but his words died before he shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s - it\u2019s nothing. Sorry for bothering you about this. It was stupid.\u201d\n\n\nBecause it was. Why would he have ever believed anything Lila or anyone calling themselves her \u2018bestie\u2019 said over his partner?\n\n\nHe\u2019d let them get to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n45% Complete\n\n\n\nNow the big question was what he was going to do about it. Because something had to be done. But he couldn\u2019t risk exposing himself or Ladybug in the process.\n\n\nChat made to stand, but Ladybug caught his wrist before he could get away, \u201cObviously not if it brought you out here as upset as you looked. I know I can be a real stickler about the secret identity thing, but Chat, I\u2019m not doing this to hurt you. I promise!\u201d She implored, and if that didn\u2019t just break his heart for making her think she\u2019d done anything wrong. \u201cIf you\u2019re being hurt or-\u201d\n\n\nBlonde hair flew as he shook his head quickly, \u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Really. I know why you do. I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t suck, but I get it. Really, I do.\u201d He tried to assure her, but he knew he was doing a terrible job. It had been such a long and emotionally draining day. He needed some time to come up with the right way to make it up to her.\n\n\n\u201cThen what was all of this about?\u201d\n\n\nHe gave her the most apologetic look he could muster, the corners of his mouth pulling up as he shook his head again, \u201cIt\u2019s too personal - talking about it might give me away, Bugaboo, but I really am sorry about this. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d\n\n\nLadybug\u2019s eyes darted back and forth as she watched him closely, but eventually, hesitantly, she had let go of his wrist and allowed him to get up and make a quick escape.\n\n\nSomething he hated to have to do. And the guilt ate at him the rest of the night, making it near impossible to sleep. So he\u2019d tried putting his mind to better uses - coming up with ways he could disprove the fake Ladybug before things got out of hand.\n\n\nBecause he knew they would.\u00a0\n\n\n\n50% Complete\n\n\n\nThe next morning was tiptoeing somewhere close to \u201cterrible day\u201d real quick and he\u2019d only been in class for fifteen minutes.\n\n\nIt had taken all of three minutes of entering the classroom for Lila and her \u2018bestie\u2019 to proffer the seat behind him like they owned the place and start holding court.\n\n\nFor every student that entered, he found another obstacle blocking his ability to get up from his seat and escape - until he was literally trapped there; listening to the liar and the fake reminisce over their friendship and answering all the questions their classmates hurled at them.\n\n\nAll the while, Adrien was becoming increasingly angry.\n\n\nBecause \n\nhow dare they\n\n?\n\n\nThat was his partner they were lying about!\u00a0\n\n\nAnd listening in only made him angrier. So angry, in fact, he\u2019d been shocked when that anger didn\u2019t earn him a black butterfly. That shock only lasted a moment, because the rational part of his brain knew he needed to calm down before one actually showed up.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had to do \n\nsomething\n\n.\n\n\nBut what could he say or do that Marinette hadn\u2019t already tried?\n\n\n\nOh god\u2026 Marinette\u2026\n\n\n\nThings were only going to get worse for her now, weren\u2019t they? With the imposter, Lila\u2019s lies would only become more credible. And with \u2018Ladybug\u2019 backing her up, there was no telling what kind of trouble they\u2019d get Marinette into.\n\n\nNino was his best bro. Always would be. Aside from Ladybug herself, Marinette had become his \n\nbest friend\n\n. They shared something he only dreamed he\u2019d be able to share with Ladybug some day.\n\n\nHe knew, because she\u2019d told him, that she wasn\u2019t as close to her friends at school anymore because of all the nonsense with Lila. So he\u2019d been trying harder to be her friend both in and out of the suit. He\u2019d tried standing up and speaking out more about the lies Lila told.\n\n\nNot that it did much good. He was brushed off just as often. People just happened to be nicer about how they did it to him than they did to Marinette.\n\n\nAdrien had been so caught up in his spiraling thoughts that he\u2019d almost missed the quiet that swept over the crowd around him.\u00a0\n\n\nAlmost.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n57% Complete\n\n\n\nLooking up from his stare-off with the tabletop, green eyes immediately zeroed in on what had quieted the room. Or, rather, \n\nwho\n\n.\n\n\nMarinette stood staring at the group. The confusion evident in the way she examined what must look like quite the strange gathering around what was supposed to be her seat.\n\n\n\u201cIs this the girl you were telling me about?\u201d\n\n\n\nOh no\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nQuickly, Adrien glanced over his shoulder, taking in Lila as she put on her biggest, fakest, puppy-dog eyes and nodded softly, watching Marinette like she were a wild animal ready to strike.\n\n\nThis was exactly what he\u2019d been afraid of.\u00a0\n\n\nHe had to come up with something quick! And he was running out of time to get up and \n\nactually\n\n do anything as the crowd that blocked him in only got denser as Bianca was given a wide berth to exit the seat she\u2019d helped steal.\n\n\n\n64% Complete\n\n\n\nTo her credit, though, Marinette merely watched the girl\u2019s approach with a raised brow, seeming unimpressed by the superior gleam to the new girl\u2019s blue-green eyes.\n\n\n\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend.\u201d She said, authoritatively, her hands propped on hips in a way that demanded respect. Like the way an adult demanded respect from a child. Which just wasn\u2019t a good look on her - even when she was pretending to be someone she wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you?\u201d Marinette asked, but her tone was\u2026 well - quite frankly, she sounded like she had better things to do.\n\n\n\u201cFor your information, it\u2019s Bianca. I just transferred yesterday. But don\u2019t change the subject. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend Lila.\u201d\n\n\nBefore Bianca had a chance to say any more, Marinette gave her a deadpanned look, \u201cWell, sorry to inform you, but your best friend is a liar.\u201d\n\n\nLila could immediately be heard breaking out into sobs behind Adrien and all he wanted to do was turn around and yell at her to cut it out. But that wasn\u2019t going to help Marinette. It would only make it worse.\n\n\n\n68% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she is. I think you\u2019re the liar. In fact, I think people like you are what\u2019s wrong with Paris. Always trying to hurt others so they get Akumatized and I have to clean up your mess.\u201d\n\n\nUh\u2026 Excuse the \n\nfuck you??\n\n\n\nThat had Bluebell eyes snapping to focus on the girl in front of her. Interest suddenly looking piqued.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you one chance. Stop being a menace to society or my partner and I will take action.\u201d\n\n\nOkay, \n\none - go fuck yourself\n\n. Two, this wasn\u2019t how Ladybug and he operated! This wasn\u2019t how this worked. How was everyone still so caught up in this girl\u2019s lies?!\n\n\n\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\n\n\nEven while trying desperately and failing to keep a handle on his own rage, Adrien found it\u2026 off that Marinette seemed even more disinterested in this than she had been even in the beginning. She wasn\u2019t getting riled up or anything!\n\n\nA triumphant smile spread over Bianca\u2019s face as she disregarded the lack of fear (or emotion in general) in Marinette\u2019s voice, \u201cI don\u2019t threaten people. But that is a promise.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette was left to blink at her a little longer - his dear friend looking lost and completely bewildered at what was happening.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d someone from the crowd stage-whispered, probably thinking they were helping, \u201cThat\u2019s Ladybug!\u201d\n\n\nAdrien fought the visceral need to yell back how stupid they all were for buying this bull.\n\n\nOnly for Lila to shush them loudly, \u201cGuys, not everyone is supposed to know! We don\u2019t know who we can trust!\u201d\n\n\n\nFuck you and everything you stand for Lila Rossi.\n\n\n\n\n73% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Ladybug?\u201d Marinette asked, and Adrien knew he had to do something.\n\n\nAnd at this point, it didn\u2019t matter what he did (except for maybe revealing himself, because that was literally going to make all of this so much worse), because he\u2019d let this go on long enough.\n\n\nThe blonde stood from his seat, intent on pushing everyone out of the way if he had to. Hell, he would pick them up and toss them out of his way if necessary. But he wasn\u2019t going to let his best friend sit here and think that Ladybug was threatening her.\n\n\nHe was pissed Lila would go this far. And he would get her back ten-fold when all this was over.\n\n\nBut this was ending right here, right -\u00a0\n\n\nPffftt\u2026\n\n\nAdrien froze as Marinette covered her mouth with her hand to stop the snort that cut through the silent tension building around the two at the front of the class.\n\n\nThen watched in confusion that likely mirrored the rest of the class as she broke out into giggles first, then full-on belly laughs that echoed through the classroom. She was laughing out loud so hard that she doubled over clutching her stomach like she might be sick, and only laughing even harder when she glanced up at one point.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore long, she was almost literally rolling on the floor laughing and Adrien wasn\u2019t sure if he should worry or join her.\n\n\n\n75% Complete\n\n\n\nShe laughed like that for a solid five minutes.\n\n\nWhich was\u2026 Honestly, it was impressive.\n\n\nEventually, the laughing began to die until the designer was left wiping the tears from her eyes as she beamed at the girl standing awkwardly before her, \u201cWow. Thanks. I really needed that.\u201d\n\n\nHuh.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the wake of her \n\nunusual\n\n reaction, there was something Adrien caught in her eyes as she stood up and brushed off her pants.\u00a0\n\n\nA spark. A gleam that sent an involuntary shiver down his spine.\n\n\nIt was determined and sharp. Like a fencing match won before the second move. Absolutely disastrous for whoever it was used on.\u00a0\n\n\nHe\u2019d seen that spark before. It was so familiar and yet so foreign on his friend\u2019s face. But he \n\nknew it\n\n. Where had he seen it before?\n\n\nAnd then she spoke - and if the \n\nlook\n\n was disastrous, the \n\ntone\n\n was damn-near fatal, \u201cSo, Ladybug, tell me this; if I\u2019m such a menace to society, why would you entrust me with a miraculous?\u201d\n\n\nWait\u2026 what? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not what he\u2019d expected her to say. Not that he really had any clue how any of this was going to go in the first place, but outing herself like that?\n\n\nMost everyone had similar looks of confusion and shock, so luckily he blended in.\n\n\n\n79% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen?! There were no new heroes! How do we know you\u2019re not lying?\u201d\n\n\nOh, right - in the heat of all of this, Adrien had nearly forgotten about Alya. And this was probably going to be a much larger shock for her than anyone else. Her best friend being a hero, and the hero she thought she\u2019d been fawning all over the last day or so being a fake.\n\n\n\u201cHuh, well, then I guess if you can\u2019t believe me at my word, it would be pretty easy to fact check.\u201d Her tone was a bit forced on those words and the reporter had the decency to look taken aback, \u201cYou could always just ask Ladybug, here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr you could ask her partner. Seeing as how he saw me transform.\u201d\n\n\nThankfully, Adrien didn\u2019t flinch too much when she referred to his alter-ego. Because \n\nthat\n\n would have been a dead give away. But he was still confused as to why Marinette would tell everyone she\u2019d been a hero? He\u2019d been the only one (besides the real Ladybug) who\u2019d seen her detransform. And he couldn\u2019t exactly come to her aid as Chat Noir right now.\n\n\nNot to mention - in time, he may have even been able to talk Ladybug into letting Marinette try again as a hero, but that couldn\u2019t happen now.\u00a0\n\n\nShe\u2019d also never boasted about it before. Even when he came to talk to her about it a few days later, she didn\u2019t say a whole lot about being a hero - he\u2019d practically had to coax her reaction out of her!\n\n\nSo why now? Why this? What the heck was she planning that had her looking more and more confident with each passing comment?\n\n\n\n81% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cI asked her to give you a chance. Because I wanted to help you. I thought being a hero would make you a better person. But you just kept bullying me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cE-exactly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow very generous of you, Lila,\u201d She said in a syrupy tone that sounded nothing like her, actually, it was a little creepy, \u201cBut, that\u2019s not what you said on the tower when we fought that Akuma together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you think I would say when you were obviously unfit to be a Hero! I didn\u2019t want to risk you turning on me.\u201d Bianca argued loudly.\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was unfit when I helped save you and Chat Noir.\u201d She grumbled, actually seeming upset as she looked away.\n\n\nIn the process, she caught sight of him watching her, and they studied each other for a moment. He couldn\u2019t give himself up, but he wanted so desperately to ask her what she was doing. Which probably looked like a strange combination of emotions on his face since her brows pulled together as she watched him.\n\n\nThe girl scoffed, \"leave my partner out of this.\u201d She demanded, and it felt like a desperate attempt at redirecting the conversation. Marinette seemed to think so too as she turned back to study the girl again.\n\n\nUgh, but If he had to hear this girl call him her partner one more time\u2026\n\n\n\n86% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 do know that your \u2018partner\u2019 is my best friend, right?\u201d She turned an apologetic look to Alya she only half meant, \u201csorry Als, but - you know,\u201d Marinette pointed between the two of them, and the model was glad he didn\u2019t have a clear view of the reporter because he could feel the guilt wafting off of her from where he stood.\n\n\n\u201cMy partner would never hang out with someone like you.\u201d\n\n\nYup. There is was. God, what he wouldn\u2019t do for an Akuma to beat up right about now.\n\n\nWith a scoff and a soft shake of her head, Marinette pulled her phone from her pocket and swiped through her pictures until she found what she was looking for.\n\n\nStill \n\nvery\n\n angry, Adrien hadn\u2019t meant to allow the blush to overtake his face (not that anyone else seemed to notice, thank god). But the moment she smugly flipped her phone around so she could show the class what was on her device, he definitely couldn\u2019t keep the heat from traveling down from his head to his toes as the class gasped again, pulling closer so they could study the photo.\n\n\nThe photo they\u2019d taken together - she and Chat Noir cuddling close on her chaise lounge. Marinette sticking her tongue out at the camera, while gave a victory peace sign over his eye. It was one of his favorites. He had a copy saved to his phone as well.\n\n\n\n90% Complete\n\n\n\nAs Bianca stared a little blankly at the picture, a number of voices all began to pick up around them.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re actually friends with chat noir? That\u2019s so cool!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes that mean you hang out with the other heroes too?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat is Chat Noir really like?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWait, then that means you really were a hero? I thought heroes had to keep their identities secret.\u201d\n\n\nApparently, that\u2019s the question she\u2019d been waiting on, because she quickly silenced the others with a pointed look back at Bianca, \"They do. But I\u2019m not a hero anymore, am I Ladybug?\u201d\n\n\nAnd he suddenly understood what she had planned. He knew exactly why she\u2019d said the things she did.\n\n\n\"I-I\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy was it again that I\u2019m not allowed to be Multimouse again?\u201d She put a thoughtful finger to her chin, looking innocent, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was nothing to do with being a menace to society.\u201d\n\n\nShe tapped her chin a few more times, looking around deep in thought. Locking eyes with him briefly before moving on. But her eyes found him again not a moment later, and he \n\nreally\n\n couldn\u2019t help the smirk that pulled at his lips, anger almost entirely receding.\n\n\nBecause she was a \n\ngoddamn genius\n\n.\n\n\nAnd it was all he could do to not jump in on her perfect scheme for outing a liar and an imposter in one go.\n\n\n\n93% Complete\n\n\n\nShe studied him again for a moment, but just as quickly, Marinette spun back to the imposter, narrowing her eyes dangerously, \u201cOh right! Because I\u2019d accidentally revealed my identity to Chat Noir. Because identities are supposed to remain a secret.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cW-well th-there are exceptions!\u201d Bianca tried to defend, but Marinette was already in a \n\nparry\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I think you, just like your supposed best friend, are a liar. You\u2019re not Ladybug. You don\u2019t know a damn thing about Ladybug. Because if you were, you\u2019d already have been beaten. You\u2019ve been in this classroom all of what, one day? And the entire class already knows your \u2018identity\u2019? We\u2019re all lucky you aren\u2019t one of the heroes, otherwise, Hawkmoth would already have won!\u201d\n\n\nWas it wrong that he suddenly found \n\nangry Marinette\n\n really attractive?\n\n\nProbably, right?\n\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n95% Complete\n\n\n\nMarinette was advancing on her opponent, finger jabbing accusingly at Bianca and making her stumble a bit, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about what it takes to be a hero. What they have to sacrifice to keep people safe. Besides, Ladybug and Chat Noir don\u2019t even know each other\u2019s identities - why the hell would Ladybug share something like that with a classroom full of people who\u2019ve been Akumatized at least once and not share that with her own partner?!\u201d\n\n\nAnd didn\u2019t that just send all kinds of tingles over his body\u2026\n\n\nMarinette was a spitfire. He\u2019d known that from his time as Chat, but hearing her come to his defense like that, well, it was hard not to admire the fire she exuded.\n\n\nThat was until Adrien recognized a similar if not more destructive heat burning in the imposter\u2019s glare as she found her footing and reclaimed her advance on Marinette instead.\n\n\nHe had to move.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow\n\n.\n\n\n\u201cHow dare you call me a liar, you little fucking brat!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAdrien didn\u2019t even try to push past his stock-still classmates. Instead, he lept over his desk smoothly sliding over the wood and pushing himself so that he hit the ground just as Bianca had raised her hand to strike her intended victim.\u00a0\n\n\nNot happening. Not now. \n\nNot fucking ever\n\n.\n\n\nWithout much effort, Adrien caught Bianca\u2019s wrist before she could move, holding her tightly and making her wince with the force of his grip. Because he was not being gentle.\u00a0\n\n\nNo, Akumas who had no control over their emotions got \u2018gentle\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\nHe would not hesitate to destroy her if she lunged for Marinette again.\n\n\n\n97% Complete\n\n\n\n\u201cA-Adrien!\u201d Bianca cried out in surprise.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He hissed at her, voice low and threatening - not really recognizing his own tone, but not entirely caring either. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear before, it definitely is now. You\u2019re not Ladybug. She would never raise a hand to a civilian like that!\u201d\n\n\nAt least, not without good reason. But he wasn\u2019t about to say that out loud.\n\n\n\u201cB-but - !\u201d Lila tried to come to her \u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 defense but was silenced when he turned and shot her an equally terrifying look.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you trying to turn everyone against Marinette. I knew you both were lying when you \u2018accidentally\u2019 revealed Ladybug\u2019s identity to me yesterday, but I didn\u2019t have any proof to prove it. You\u2019ve been lying to everyone about everything!\u201d He snarled, and he was starting to wonder if he\u2019d accidentally transformed with the way he felt himself bristle in anger.\n\n\n\u201cAdrien! Y-you\u2019re hurting me!\u201d\n\n\nHe turned to say something maybe a little \n\nungentlemanly\n\n, but before he could, Madame Bustier walked in the class, \u201cWhat is going on here?!\u201d She shrieked, bag and class assignment papers falling from her hands as she took in the scene.\n\n\nOh, this was just \n\nfantastic\n\n.\n\n\n\n99% Complete\n\n\n\nIn the chaos that followed, Adrien and Marinette had been sent out to the hall while Madame Bustier got the story from the other students.\u00a0\n\n\nBut the only student he cared about was the one standing outside right next to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Marinette.\u201d He said, trying not to mutter because he needed to say it, but finding all the guilt suddenly rearing its ugly head when left alone with her.\n\n\nShe was his best friend. Why hadn\u2019t he tried harder to stand up for her?\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have ever told you not to call her out. I was stupid. I just hope you\u2019ll forgive me someday.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette watched him a moment, eyes wide, but soon replaced with a gentle smile that pulled at her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, Adrien.\u201d She said, shrugging as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, \u201cBesides, at least you checked your sources.\u201d She chuckled, finding something funny in what she\u2019d said.\n\n\nWait\u2026\n\n\nHe turned a confused look on her.\n\n\nChecked his sources? What did she mean by\u2026\n\n\nThe smile she turned on him in return was brighter than she\u2019d given anyone in some time, \u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? You\u2019d be the first to know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100% Complete\n\n\n\n\nRestarting Adrien Agreste\u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cAdrien? You\u2026 you okay there?\u201d\n\n\nWide-eyed and jaw hanging open, the blonde blinked a few (several) times as he was brought back to the present, having to take a moment to remind himself how to: a.) breathe, b.) speak, c.) remember his own name.\n\n\nAdrien was his name.\n\n\nRight. Of course. Cool.\u00a0\n\n\nNow if only he could do the other two things, he\u2019d be set!\n\n\nMarinette watched him with a strange (read: \n\nadorable\n\n) mixture of amusement and concern that had her biting her bottom lip and pulling it into her mouth while she watched and waited for him to react. Probably to keep herself from laughing at him. And he should feel \n\nsome \n\nway about that, but he couldn\u2019t stop staring at her lips and wanting to be the one biting them and -\u00a0\n\n\n\nAND BREATHE DAMMIT.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOh right.\n\n\nHe\u2019s supposed to be doing that thing.\n\n\nGiving in to the screaming need for oxygen, Adrien sucked in a deep breath, allowing for it to slowly ease back out of his mouth as he continued to watch his classmate with wide, unblinking eyes that were really starting to sting and water.\n\n\nAs he\u2019d reached the end of his exhale, though, his voice began to function again as little breathy chuckles started to escape him. A smile had begun to grow over his lips and as the chuckles turned to giggles and full-on laughter, and his eyes watered more, he was \n\nbeaming\n\n as he clutched at his sides.\n\n\nHe was smiling so large in his laughing fit there was no reason for his eyes to be watering this much - oh no, those are \n\ntears\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd he was shaking. And not because he was laughing.\u00a0\n\n\nThe laughter didn\u2019t petter off though, even when he swung around and gathered the girl in his arms, lifting her up, and spinning them both around in the empty hallway until she was laughing along with him. The combined sound between them so exuberant and joyful, not a single care for the world outside of the two of them at that moment.\n\n\nHe spun them until he was dizzy and even then he couldn\u2019t be bothered by the tilting sway of his world because he\u2019d set her down and she was blushing like mad and beaming up at him with those bright blue eyes that were always so familiar and-\n\n\n\nOh my god\u2026\n\n\n\nTrembling hands moved from her arms up to her face, cupping her cheeks gently; fingers brushing against the stud earrings she never took off. \u201cMy Lady?\u201d His tone was soft and questioning, and no one could possibly blame him for that because this was an absolute dream and he was terrified of waking up.\n\n\nShe chuckled back at him, soft tender gaze looking absolutely radiant as she lifted a hand to brush away the remains of tear streaks from his cheek, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Chaton? Cat got your tongue?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien\u2019s eyes widened once more because he will \n\nnever\n\n not love hearing her call him that without a mask, but also she just punned and it\u2019s doing things for him.\n\n\nBut none of that mattered. There was only one thing Adrien wanted to ask her at that moment.\n\n\n\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s surprise in her expression but she doesn\u2019t look upset by the request. In fact, there is a playful gleam in her eye as she smiled at him now, \u201cI\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\nLet no one ever say Adrien Agreste made it a habit of offending ladies.\n\n\n\nHis Lady.\n\n\n\n\nHis partner.\n\n\n\n\nHis best friend.\n\n\n\nAll wrapped up in this one amazing girl, who tilted her head up, eyes fluttering shut so sweetly, cheeks tinted the most adorable shade of pink.\n\n\nGod he almost forgot how to breathe again.\n\n\nWhich was absolutely fine. Because, as soon as he leaned in, lips pressing softly to hers, he realized with startling clarity that he would spend the rest of his life having his breath stolen away by this girl and he would revel in every moment of it.\n\n\n\u201cAhem-\u201d\n\n\nThe sound of someone clearing their throat brought the two of them out of their little bubble, making them part slightly, but Adrien refused to let her get very far out of his grasp, to look back to the classroom door.\n\n\nWhere half the class piled up nearly on top of one another to gawk at them.\n"
