    "text": "\u201cHuh,\u201d Jaskier says, frowning thoughtfully at the letter he\u2019s just received.\nAcross the table, Geralt ignores Jaskier and takes a bite of his lunch. It\u2019s been about five months since Jaskier started tagging along with him, and he\u2019s long since learned that the bard is perfectly capable of holding up both ends of a conversation without any actual input from Geralt.\nThe inn they\u2019ve stopped in, in northern Redania, actually has good food for once. Geralt\u2019s not generally too picky about what he eats, given that he spends nine out of ten nights camping in whatever wilderness his current contract takes him to, and eating meat roasted on a spit.\nIt\u2019s nice, though, once in a while, to taste something with actual honest-to-god spices in it. Geralt applies himself to the task at hand with vigor, and, when Jaskier\u2019s too busy staring at his letter to eat his own food, Geralt helps himself to a portion of that, too.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jaskier says indignantly, when he absently pokes at his plate with his fork and succeeds only in shifting the few remaining crumbs around.\nGeralt shrugs. \u201cThought you didn\u2019t want it.\u201d He gestures to the innkeeper for another plate for Jaskier.\n\u201cI was busy,\u201d Jaskier says, pouting. He waves the letter at Geralt. \u201cA friend of mine is in need of some assistance, so it looks like we\u2019ll be parting ways for a while.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll survive,\u201d Geralt says dryly, as a barmaid comes by with a fresh plate of food for Jaskier. The bard beams up at her, and the girl giggles, blushing a fetching pink. Geralt rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI saw that,\u201d Jaskier says once the barmaid leaves, pointing his fork at Geralt. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better survive. I can\u2019t write ballads about a dead witcher, that\u2019s no fun at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nGeralt spends the next month taking contracts in Redania, killing ghouls and drowners for coin. Which would have been just fine with him before, just him and Roach and a few thousand monsters waiting to meet the pointy end of his swords \u2013 but now, annoyingly, Geralt keeps feeling like there\u2019s something missing. It\u2019s like an itch that he can\u2019t quite reach, simmering just under his skin and making him feel short-tempered and irritable.\nFour and a half weeks after he and Jaskier parted ways, Geralt muzzily blinks awake in the middle of the night to find that his campfire has gone out. It\u2019s drizzling, the kind of light, dreary rainfall that can go on for hours without stopping, and the moon is a pale, narrow crescent behind thick grey clouds. There\u2019s a slight chill on Geralt\u2019s skin, which means that for any normal human being, it must be freezing.\n\u201cGet over here, Jaskier,\u201d he says; the bard has always been susceptible to the cold \u2013 then Geralt sits straight up in his bedroll, abruptly wide awake, and looks around at the empty, conspicuously bard-free campsite around him. He rubs a hand over his face.\n\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he mutters.\nThe next morning, he dispatches a group of harpies that\u2019s been terrorizing the nearby town. They aren\u2019t even much of a challenge, which just makes him more annoyed.\nGeralt makes a little more of an effort to stop by inns nowadays, instead of camping far off the main roads all the time. He gets recognized in some of the places he stops at because of the songs Jaskier\u2019s been singing about him, but nobody seems to have actually seen the bard recently.\nNot that Geralt\u2019s looking for him or something like that. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s been a while since he last saw Jaskier, and it\u2019d be nice to know that the idiot bard\u2019s still alive, that\u2019s all.\nGeralt\u2019s all the way on the southern border of Redania, about to cross into Temeria, when he enters one of the larger taverns near the border to cries of, \u201clook, it\u2019s the White Wolf!\u201d and tipsy singing of a song all about Geralt heroically and singlehandedly saving a village from devastation and ruin, which has Jaskier\u2019s fingerprints all over it.\nIt transpires that the bard who had composed that particular song had passed through the town a few days ago, which the chatty innkeeper tells Geralt as he brings him a mug of ale. The rowdy crowd in the inn, meanwhile, finishes singing the song about Geralt\u2019s heroics and segues seamlessly into a saccharine love ballad about the fairytale romance between the daughter of a baron and a lowly bard.\n\u201cAh!\u201d says the innkeeper to Geralt, who is concentrating very hard on his ale and hoping that the innkeeper takes the hint and leaves him alone. Alas, the man does not. \u201cThis song, it\u2019s by the very same bard who sang those songs about you, Master Witcher! So in love, he is, with his beautiful lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s so romantic,\u201d sighs the barmaid dreamily, appearing beside the innkeeper with Geralt\u2019s dinner in hand. She places the plate on the table. \u201cThat handsome bard, marrying a noble lady!\u201d\nGeralt squints up at them doubtfully. \u201cThis\u2026bard,\u201d he says. \u201cDark hair, blue eyes, never shuts up?\u201d\n\u201cAye,\u201d the innkeeper says as the barmaid scurries off to wait on another table. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. He\u2019s marrying the Lady Petra \u2013 the daughter of the new Baron of Tridam. Lovely girl, she is.\u201d He blinks at Geralt, looking slightly alarmed, then starts to back away slowly.\nGeralt frowns, then realizes that his hands have clenched themselves into fists on the table. He unclenches them with an effort. \u201cDid this bard mention where he was headed?\u201d he asks, a little stiffly.\n\u201cEr,\u201d the innkeeper hesitates, then stammers out when Geralt glares at him, \u201cBlaviken, Master Witcher! He said he was headed to Blaviken.\u201d\nGeralt gets to his feet, leaving his plate untouched. He has, for some reason, lost his appetite. The innkeeper scuttles back a few steps, eyeing Geralt nervously as he digs out a couple of coins from his pocket and places them on the table to pay for his dinner and ale. He nods curtly to the innkeeper, then strides back out of the inn, heading to where he left Roach, and rides out of town.\nHe\u2019s going to continue south into Temeria like he planned. Jaskier is fine; apparently he\u2019s doing very well, actually. Probably very excited about his impending nuptials. Anyway, point is, the bard is safe and sound, so Geralt can stop worrying, not that he was worrying anyway.\nSo. He\u2019ll go to Temeria, see if there\u2019re any contracts in the area, maybe look up Triss and ask if the princess is doing any better.\nGeralt makes it all of one mile before giving in with a resigned sigh. He fucking hates Blaviken.\nHe turns Roach around and rides back north as fast as she can carry him.\nGeralt reaches Blaviken in just under a week, and is promptly pelted with rotten vegetables. Again. Grumbling under his breath, he draws his swords and scowls at the villagers fiercely until they scatter, muttering \u201cbutcher!\u201d and \u201cmurderer!\u201d just loud enough for him to hear them.\nHe sighs irritably, sheathes his swords, and stomps over to the inn.\nHe almost provokes a brawl at the inn just by stepping into it. \u201cIt\u2019s the butcher! He\u2019s back!\u201d yells one man, and right away another six men jump in, howling curses at him. Resignedly, Geralt braces himself for a fight, when a familiar voice exclaims from behind him, \u201cwhat the \u2013 Geralt!\u201d\nWhen he spins around, Jaskier is standing right behind him. The bard grabs Geralt\u2019s arm, tugging him towards the stairs. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urges. \u201cBefore the good townsfolk decide to lynch you.\u201d\nGeralt shoots one final glare at the men still cursing at him, then turns and follows Jaskier up the stairs. It turns out that the bard has been staying in a room here, which he brings Geralt to.\nAfter shutting the door of his room behind him, Jaskier turns to regard Geralt quizzically. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou hate Blaviken.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Geralt.\nJaskier stares at him in puzzlement. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what are you doing here?\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s\u2026a damned good question. He\u2019d pushed Roach all the way here, almost a week of riding, right after hearing about Jaskier\u2019s impending nuptials, and he still has no explanation for why he\u2019s here, in goddamned Blaviken.\nAnd speaking of nuptials \u2013 \u201cwhy are you in Blaviken?\u201d Geralt demands in lieu of formulating an actual answer to the bard\u2019s question. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be in Tridam preparing for your wedding.\u201d\nJaskier beams at him. \u201cAh, yes, my wedding!\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cYou heard, then! You see, I \u2013 \u201d\nJust then, the door opens, and a blond young man who appears to be around the same age as Jaskier walks into the room. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he begins, then stops short when he sees Geralt, blinking in surprise. \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t realize we had company.\u201d\n\nWe?\n\nGeralt had been a little too preoccupied earlier to pay all that much attention to his surroundings, but now, after a quick glance around, it\u2019s clear that there are two persons\u2019 belongings strewn around the room.\nThere are, also, mercifully, two beds. Not that Geralt cares about that at all, of course. He eyes the newcomer mistrustfully.\n\u201cGeralt,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cthis is Piotr, an old friend of mine. He\u2019s the son of the Baron of Tridam, and Petra\u2019s twin brother.\u201d He turns to Piotr. \u201cAnd Piotr, this,\u201d he says, waving his hand at Geralt, \u201cis my friend, Geralt.\u201d\nAh. So Piotr is the brother of Jaskier\u2019s\u2026wife-to-be, then.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Piotr says cheerfully to Geralt. \u201cJaskier\u2019s told me all about you.\u201d He grins impishly at Jaskier.\n\u201cPiotr,\u201d Jaskier hisses. He looks a little flushed, warm color high on his cheeks. Geralt glances between them suspiciously.\n\u201cOn a more serious note,\u201d Piotr says, sounding apologetic, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to interrupt your conversation, but.\u201d He turns to Jaskier and says, urgently, \u201cthey\u2019re here.\u201d\nJaskier winces. \u201cAh. Well,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cWe\u2019d best get moving, then.\u201d\nAs Piotr scurries around the room, hurriedly shoving his belongings into his pack, Jaskier turns to grin at Geralt, who frowns at him questioningly. Instead of explaining, though, Jaskier just grabs his pack and his lute, and says, \u201ccoming?\u201d\nGeralt shrugs and follows Jaskier and Piotr out the door.\nThey dash through the corridor and back to the rear of the inn, then go up a flight of rickety stairs to the roof. As Geralt watches incredulously, Jaskier and Piotr drag a few dusty planks from where they\u2019ve been lying neglected in a corner, and lay them from the edge of the inn\u2019s roof to the roof of the next building. They\u2019re both laughing like a couple of children.\nFrom somewhere downstairs, there\u2019s a cacophony of shouts, followed by footsteps thundering up the stairs.\n\u201cCome on, Geralt!\u201d Jaskier urges, then follows Piotr across the planks to the roof of the next building. Geralt brings up the rear, glaring at Jaskier\u2019s back in disbelief.\n\u201cWho did you piss off this time?\u201d he demands of Jaskier, as the bard and his friend drag the planks down on the other side so that whoever\u2019s following them won\u2019t be able to cross. Geralt sighs, and helps to move a plank.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of\u2026a long story,\u201d Jaskier tells him, breathless, as they run down the stairs of the new building. \u201cI\u2019ll explain as soon as we get somewhere safe.\u201d\nThey wind through the narrow, dimly-lit streets of Blaviken, Piotr in the lead. Thankfully, it\u2019s now late in the evening so there aren\u2019t many people about, because Geralt is not exactly inconspicuous, and especially not so in Blaviken.\nHe automatically reaches out to steady Jaskier as the bard stumbles over a loose cobblestone in the near-dark. With deep irritation, Geralt reflects that he still doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and then wonders why he\u2019s even helping these two lunatics \u2013 except, if he\u2019s honest with himself, he knows exactly why, and the reason is currently three feet in front of him and giggling like a maniac.\nHe sighs.\nJaskier half-turns to grin at him as he runs, wild and gleeful, his cap of dark hair all mussed by their mad dash through the Blaviken streets, and Geralt\u2019s heart does a funny little twist in his chest.\nFuck, fuck, fuck.\nGeralt takes a deep breath, and reminds himself that Jaskier is\u2026well, the bard keeps insisting that they\u2019re friends, which Geralt will concede might not be entirely inaccurate \u2013 but more importantly, Jaskier is a soon-to-be-married man, and Geralt has no business wanting what he can\u2019t have.\nAs Piotr, still in the lead, rounds a sharp corner just ahead of them, Geralt catches a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye. Instantly alert, he reaches out and grabs Jaskier, slipping a hand over the bard\u2019s mouth to prevent him from making a sound. He hurriedly steps off the cobblestone path and tugs Jaskier with him into the dark, narrow space between two houses. Jaskier\u2019s breath is warm against his palm.\nHe\u2019s just in time; two armored men hurry out from the alleyway opening out onto where Geralt and Jaskier had been standing, looking around them as if searching for something \u2013 or someone. They confer with each other in low voices then stride briskly away in the direction of the inn, but not before Geralt catches sight of the insignia on their armor.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d he says evenly, keeping his voice low. \u201cWhy the fuck are the Baron of Tridam\u2019s men trying to kill you?\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s trying to kill me,\u201d Jaskier protests as they step back onto the cobblestones. His face is a little flushed. \u201cJust scare me and, uh, maybe maim me a little?\u201d\n\u201cJaskier.\u201d\nThe bard puts his hands up in a gesture of surrender at Geralt\u2019s murderous glare. \u201cOkay, okay! So, yes, those men chasing us \u2013 well, me \u2013 were sent by the Baron of Tridam, and no, the Baron doesn\u2019t know that Piotr\u2019s here with us. You see, Petra and I \u2013 \u201d\nAt that moment, Piotr returns from around the corner he\u2019d taken earlier, skidding to a stop in front of them. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d he demands. \u201cCome on, quickly!\u201d\nThey follow Piotr through the winding streets until he finally comes to a stop in front of a small cottage by the water. He raps sharply on the door, and after a few moments, it\u2019s opened by a kindly-looking older woman, who beams at him and holds the door open for the group of them to enter.\nThe woman looks startled when she sees Geralt \u2013 he does, after all, have a\u2026reputation in Blaviken \u2013 but she glances again at Piotr, then seems to make up her mind. She nods at Geralt and offers him a small smile, then shuts the door behind the group.\nThe cottage is small and cozy, lit warmly by the fire burning merrily in the fireplace. As Geralt and Jaskier look around them, the woman smiles fondly at Piotr, drawing him into her arms for a hug.\nAs Piotr and the woman converse in low voices, Jaskier clasps his arms around himself, shivering slightly, and really, that\u2019s just typical \u2013 Jaskier always either overestimates how much cold he can withstand or underestimates how warm his fancy bardic finery is, and months of travelling with Geralt still hasn\u2019t cured him of this particular failing.\nWith a firm hand on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, Geralt nudges the bard closer to the crackling fireplace. Jaskier shoots him a sheepish smile in thanks.\nMeanwhile, Piotr finishes his conversation with the woman and turns to the two men by the fireplace. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll be safe here. Eleonora used to be Petra\u2019s and my nursemaid when we were children \u2013 she won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re here.\u201d\nEleonora nods at them. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says warmly, \u201csit down. I\u2019ll get you boys something to eat.\u201d\nAs Eleonora bustles into the tiny kitchen, Jaskier goes over to Piotr, putting a hand on his arm. The two men move over to the small dining table and sit down, where they huddle together in deep discussion, close enough that their knees are touching. Geralt leans back against the wall, crossing his arms, and eyes them sourly. Their heads are very close together.\nGeralt thinks it possibly says something about him that he absolutely fucking hates seeing Jaskier\u2019s attention focused on someone other than himself. He\u2019s not sure that he likes what it says about him. Damn Jaskier, anyway. This is all his fault.\nGeralt is still absently glaring at the pair in front of him when Piotr glances up and meets Geralt\u2019s gaze. He looks a little taken aback at Geralt\u2019s menacing expression, then blinks and grins back at Geralt.\nAs Piotr stands, shouldering his pack, he claps Jaskier on the shoulder. \u201cBy the way, Jaskier,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might want to explain to your witcher about Petra.\u201d\nGeralt glowers at him. \u201cI\u2019m not his witcher,\u201d he growls. Jaskier, too, makes a face at Piotr, blushing.\nPiotr just returns their twin glares with an easy smile. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, \u201cit was very nice meeting you. And Jaskier,\u201d \u2013 he pauses here to squeeze Jaskier\u2019s shoulder \u2013 \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Eleonora says from the doorway of the kitchen, where she\u2019s holding a large wooden spoon. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying, Master Piotr?\u201d\nPiotr shakes his head. \u201cJaskier will be safe with Geralt watching over him, and I\u2019d best get back to Tridam,\u201d he says, then laughs. \u201cFather will probably be in a towering rage by now.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need watching over,\u201d Jaskier interjects, looking indignant. Geralt snorts softly, and Jaskier turns to scowl at him.\nPiotr shoots Jaskier a cheerful grin, then goes over to Eleonora, taking her free hand in his. \u201cThank you, Eleonora \u2013 Petra and I are very grateful. You\u2019ll look out for Jaskier and Geralt, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Master Piotr,\u201d Eleonora says, and turns to smile at Jaskier. \u201cIt\u2019s such a kind thing that Master Jaskier is doing for our Petra.\u201d Jaskier beams at her.\nAfter Piotr\u2019s left, Eleonora waves Geralt and Jaskier over to the dining table, then serves them a hot, delicious-smelling stew. She declines to join them, saying she\u2019s already eaten.\nAfter telling Geralt and Jaskier that there\u2019s a small room upstairs for them to sleep in, Eleonora disappears back into the kitchen. The moment she\u2019s gone, Geralt leans across the table, pinning Jaskier with a glare.\n\u201cNow,\u201d he says firmly, \u201care you going to tell me why your wife\u2019s \u2013 \u201d his throat closes up around the word \u2018wife\u2019, and he has to clear his throat \u2013 \u201cyour wife\u2019s father is trying to kill you?\u201d\n\u201cThe thing is, um,\u201d says Jaskier. \u201cPetra and I aren\u2019t actually getting married.\u201d\nDespite himself, Geralt feels a weight he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been carrying fall away from his chest. Damn it. \u201cExplain,\u201d he demands. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Piotr and Petra for several years now,\u201d Jaskier says, in between spooning stew into his mouth. \u201cI met them when I performed at one of the events their father \u2013 the Baron \u2013 held, and Piotr and I, we, er, well, we spent a very nice evening together.\u201d He clears his throat, grinning cheekily even as he colors slightly.\nGeralt scowls deeply at him, and does not feel resentful at all, not even a little, because that would be idiotic of him. \u201cIs that why the Baron sent men after you?\u201d he says. \u201cBecause if that\u2019s the reason, Jaskier, I swear \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d Jaskier says quickly. \u201cSo, anyway, Piotr wrote to me a few weeks ago, asking for my help. The Baron\u2019s always had ambitions for Petra to marry up, but she\u2019s fallen in love with a commoner \u2013 her father forbade them to marry, of course.\u201d\nHe stops to steal a slice of beef out of Geralt\u2019s bowl. Geralt glares at him, but makes no move to recover it. He shifts his bowl a little closer to his side of the table, just in case the bard makes a second attempt on his food.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jaskier says, chewing happily on the beef, \u201cthe twins and I decided we\u2019d pretend that Petra was planning to leave Tridam and marry me, as a\u2026distraction, if you will, for the Baron.\u201d He beams at Geralt proudly. \u201cI composed a ballad about it \u2013 quite a masterpiece, if I do say so myself! \u2013 and performed it at taverns throughout Redania until Piotr sent me a letter to tell me that word had gotten back to the Baron.\u201d\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Geralt says dryly, scraping up the last of his stew. \u201cThe Baron wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d\nJaskier laughs. \u201cWell, you saw how unhappy he was firsthand, earlier.\u201d He spoons up the last of his stew as well. \u201cSo, in his letter, Piotr told me to meet him in Blaviken to lay low, said he knew someone here who could hide me if the men the Baron sent after me found out where I was.\u201d He waves his free hand around to indicate Eleonora\u2019s house.\n\u201cYou told the whole damned world you were going to Blaviken,\u201d Geralt says irritably. \u201cNo wonder the Baron\u2019s men found you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d Jaskier asks, tipping his head to one side quizzically. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI found out you were here from an innkeeper,\u201d Geralt says, with deep exasperation. \u201cIn an inn near Temeria.\u201d\nJaskier blinks. \u201cHuh,\u201d he says. \u201cSo maybe I did mention it to a few people.\u201d\nGeralt sighs, putting his head in his hands.\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Jaskier says, perking up. \u201cSo you came to Blaviken to look for me?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d Geralt growls, but Jaskier is already beaming delightedly at him, so he gives it up as a lost cause.\n\u201cAnd I assume that Petra has married this man she\u2019s in love with, while you\u2019ve been leading the Baron\u2019s men on a merry chase?\u201d Geralt asks, mainly to stop Jaskier from smiling at him like that. It makes his skin feel too tight, his fingers itching to reach out and trace the upturned curve of Jaskier\u2019s lips.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Jaskier says cheerfully. \u201cAnd after they get back to Tridam and tell the Baron, he\u2019ll stop sending his men after me.\u201d He pauses. \u201cUm, I think.\u201d\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t decide to have you killed anyway, for going along with this harebrained scheme,\u201d Geralt points out mildly.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Jaskier looks alarmed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d\nGeralt scrubs one hand over his face. So\u2026Jaskier has a contingent of armed men after him because he wanted to help his friend marry the man she loves. It\u2019s so damned typical that it gives Geralt a fucking headache.\nHe hopes fervently that the Baron decides to be magnanimous and let the whole thing go, or Geralt is going to have to kill a whole bunch of people, and he really doesn\u2019t want to be known as the Butcher of Blaviken and Tridam.\nWell, Jaskier isn\u2019t getting married, at any rate.\nGeralt glares across the table at the bard with as much irritation as he can muster, but the expression on his face must not have been what he\u2019d expected, because Jaskier leans across the table and touches his hand lightly.\n\u201cBefore Piotr left, why did he say I should explain to you about Petra?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYou should ask Piotr that,\u201d Geralt says, \u201csince you two are so close.\u201d He shakes Jaskier\u2019s hand off.\nJaskier considers Geralt for a long moment, then says, \u201cthat was years ago, and it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d He pauses, then adds, eyebrows rising, \u201cspeaking of things that mean something, though, there\u2019s a certain witcher I\u2019ve been travelling with for months, spent every moment of my time with, but somehow he just won\u2019t take a hint \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Geralt mutters, and Jaskier laughs warmly, smiling up at Geralt, soft and fond.\n\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d Geralt growls, looking away.\n\u201cGeralt,\u201d Jaskier says, and there\u2019s a vulnerability in his voice that makes everything in Geralt snap to attention, all his protective instincts coming to the fore \u2013 and damn it, when had keeping Jaskier safe become a reflex? He shifts uncomfortably, looking back at Jaskier, whose eyes are wide and unguarded, and very, very blue.\n\u201cI\u2019m not reading you wrong, am I?\u201d Jaskier asks, and there\u2019s uncertainty creeping into his voice now, and that just won\u2019t do.\n\u201c\u2026no,\u201d Geralt admits gruffly. He clears his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\nHe looks up at Jaskier, startled, as the bard gets to his feet, the legs of his chair scraping loudly across the floor when he pushes it back from the table.\nJaskier smiles down at him and holds out a hand, inviting. \u201cTake me to bed, Geralt,\u201d he says.\nGeralt\u2019s barely shut the door of the room they\u2019re being loaned for the night, sat down on one of the two beds and taken off his boots before Jaskier, his own boots already off, pushes him down on the bed. The bard immediately clambers over him, straddling his lap and fitting their mouths together, kissing him hot and demanding, fingers deftly undoing the buckles on Geralt\u2019s leather jerkin.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this,\u201d he pants against Geralt\u2019s lips, \u201cfor months, Geralt. Months.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were about to marry,\u201d Geralt mutters fiercely, fingers flexing on Jaskier\u2019s slim hips as he plunders the bard\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\u201cI should announce my impending nuptials more often,\u201d Jaskier says breathlessly when he surfaces for air, \u201cif that\u2019s the reaction I get.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Geralt tells him, firm and possessive. \u201cMine.\u201d He tugs the bard even closer so that their clothed cocks rub up against each other, and they both groan fervently at the sensation; like Geralt, Jaskier\u2019s already fully hard, his trousers tenting obscenely in the front.\nJaskier laughs against Geralt\u2019s mouth, warm and intimate. \u201cVery prehistoric of you,\u201d he murmurs archly against Geralt\u2019s lips. \u201cI rather like it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you never stop talking,\u201d Geralt groans as Jaskier\u2019s hand creeps between his legs, caressing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my best traits,\u201d agrees Jaskier, with a pleased hum as Geralt palms his ass, then he moans as Geralt claims his mouth again.\n\u201cTake this off,\u201d Jaskier mumbles against Geralt\u2019s mouth in between frantic kisses, tugging at Geralt\u2019s jerkin, already hanging open with all the buckles undone. Geralt shrugs the jerkin off, and Jaskier promptly swipes the garment right off the bed with an impatient hand. The jerkin lands on the floor with a metallic clang of buckles.\nWithout releasing Geralt\u2019s mouth, Jaskier starts working on his shirt buttons, slender fingers brushing Geralt\u2019s chest. Geralt opts for the more expedient method of yanking Jaskier\u2019s shirt open, tearing the delicate silk garment right down the middle with a loud ripping noise.\nJaskier makes an indignant noise into Geralt\u2019s mouth, which melts into a low moan as Geralt kisses him again wet and hungry, curling one hand over Jaskier\u2019s groin to squeeze the promising bulge there. The bard\u2019s tattered shirt is forgotten as they wrestle each other out of their trousers and shorts, both of them almost falling out of the narrow bed in the frantic struggle to get the last of their clothing off.\nGeralt rolls them over so that the bard is lying beneath him, dark hair fanning out around his head, blue eyes dark with arousal. Jaskier\u2019s so beautiful naked, all pale perfect skin and lithe muscle, his cock fat and pink, precome welling from the tip. Geralt shifts to kneel between the bard\u2019s legs then ducks his head to lap at Jaskier\u2019s cockhead, the taste of him salty on Geralt\u2019s tongue, and Jaskier gasps, his hips hitching.\n\u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s looking down at Geralt, eyes wide and dark. Geralt\u2019s been with men only a few times in his life \u2013 before Jaskier, he\u2019d usually preferred women \u2013 and it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s sucked cock, but, gods, he wants this badly, wants to fill his mouth with Jaskier\u2019s cock, wants the taste of him on his tongue.\nHe ducks his head further, takes more of Jaskier into his mouth and Jaskier\u2019s reaction is immediate; he moans, the sound punched out of him as his hips jerk up sharply, shoving more of his cock into Geralt\u2019s mouth. Geralt pulls back a little, adjusts.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Jaskier gasps. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2013 but, your mouth, gods, Geralt, the songs I could write about it \u2013 \u201d\nGeralt determinedly takes more of Jaskier into his mouth to forestall any such urges, and the rest of the bard\u2019s sentence is lost in his choked moan as Geralt sloppily mouths at him, curling his fist over the part of Jaskier\u2019s cock he can\u2019t get into his mouth. Jaskier\u2019s hands come down to tangle in his hair.\nHe sucks Jaskier hard and wet until Jaskier is moaning incoherently, fingers clenched tight in Geralt\u2019s hair, hips rolling up as he fucks Geralt\u2019s mouth. Jaskier\u2019s cock swells in his mouth, getting impossibly harder, and Geralt knows that Jaskier is close even as the bard gasps a warning, pushing feebly at Geralt\u2019s shoulder to try to shove him off.\nGeralt hums low in his throat instead, bearing down, and Jaskier comes with a wordless cry, arching almost off the bed as he spills hot and bitter over Geralt\u2019s tongue.\nHe licks Jaskier clean as the bard\u2019s breaths gradually slow, then Jaskier\u2019s tugging him up, saying, \u201cGeralt, gods, that was amazing, you\u2019re so \u2013 \u201d then kisses him, licking the taste of himself out of Geralt\u2019s mouth. He wraps his hand around Geralt\u2019s stiff cock, which has been steadily leaking precome into the sheets, and Geralt groans.\n\u201cI want to ride you,\u201d Jaskier tells him without preamble, and all Geralt can think is oh fuck, pleasegodyes. He shifts to one side to make room as Jaskier reaches over the side of the bed to root around in Geralt\u2019s pack, finally pulling out the last bottle of healing salve he has left. Geralt can\u2019t even summon the willpower to put up a token protest; he\u2019d actually be perfectly happy to bleed to death the next time he has to kill something as long as he gets to put his cock in Jaskier right the fuck now.\nJaskier grins at him, as if he knows what Geralt\u2019s thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re not using all of it,\u201d he says, opening the bottle and tipping a small amount over his fingers. \u201cI am aware of the primary purpose of this \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cYou can use ten fucking bottles,\u201d Geralt rasps. \u201cWhatever the hell you want, Jaskier, just, for the love of god, hurry up.\u201d\nJaskier laughs breathlessly and hauls Geralt in to kiss him again, then pushes Geralt down on the bed and arranges himself so he\u2019s kneeling over Geralt\u2019s lap. He reaches around behind himself, a look of concentration on his face, and Geralt swallows hard, licking his lips.\n\u201cCan I \u2013 \u201d he says and Jaskier nods; Geralt tips some of the salve over his fingers with unsteady hands and reaches around so that his fingers can join Jaskier\u2019s to stretch the bard open. Jaskier\u2019s making these little grunts and whimpers that are going straight to Geralt\u2019s cock, and every single one of those noises is making his skin feel hot and too-tight, like he\u2019s going to shatter apart any second.\nWhen Jaskier finally sinks onto his cock, it\u2019s heaven, Jaskier tight and hot around him, Geralt\u2019s hands spread wide over the bard\u2019s firm ass, both their skin slick with sweat as Geralt rocks up into Jaskier. Jaskier\u2019s cock is already starting to fill again; he rides Geralt hot and hard, thighs flexing, hands splayed over Geralt\u2019s chest, until he\u2019s fully hard again and Geralt wraps his hand around Jaskier\u2019s cock, stroking him firm and quick as they move together.\nHe\u2019s just about getting close when Jaskier leans down to kiss him, deep and wet and hot, then slows down the pace just enough to keep Geralt on edge but not quite enough to tip him over into climax. He keeps Geralt there for what feels like hours, rolling his hips gently and murmuring things so filthy that if Geralt could blush he quite possibly would have, until Geralt\u2019s so wound up that he can\u2019t think, his fingers white-knuckled on Jaskier\u2019s thighs and his balls tight and aching \u2013\n\u2013 then Jaskier leans down, lips brushing the shell of Geralt\u2019s ear, and whispers, low and honeyed and velvet-soft, \u201ccome for me, Geralt,\u201d and clenches around him, and Geralt does: every single muscle in his body locks up and, gasping for air, he comes so fucking hard that he almost blacks out.\nWhen he can breathe again, Jaskier\u2019s kneeling over him frantically stripping his own cock, and gods, he\u2019s gorgeous like this, face and neck and chest all flushed a rosy pink, lips parted as he pants for breath. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he moans. \u201cGods, how you looked just now, you have no idea \u2013 \u201d\nGeralt tugs the bard down for a hard kiss then wraps his own hand around Jaskier\u2019s, and together they stroke him until he cries out and paints Geralt\u2019s chest and stomach with pearly white, both of them breathing raggedly into the shared space between them.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nRoach greets Jaskier affectionately the next day when Geralt brings the bard to where he\u2019d left her, a little ways outside town.\n\u201cTraitor,\u201d Geralt mutters as Roach immediately trots up to Jaskier and nuzzles him. Jaskier laughs, offering up a cube of sugar, most likely purloined from Eleonora\u2019s breakfast table. They\u2019d helped Eleonora to clean her living room and kitchen as an apology of sorts, for the sorry state they\u2019d left her spare bedroom in \u2013 Jaskier had volunteered them for the task, much to Geralt\u2019s disgust \u2013 although Eleonora had then cooked them the most delicious breakfast Geralt had eaten in months, so all in all, things hadn\u2019t worked out terribly.\n\u201cStop spoiling her,\u201d Geralt grumbles at Jaskier as the bard pats Roach\u2019s nose, murmuring endearments softly to her. He swings his pack onto Roach\u2019s back and tightens the straps.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Geralt,\u201d Jaskier teases, batting his eyelashes in an exaggerated manner. \u201cYou\u2019re still my favorite.\u201d\nGeralt turns to scowl at Jaskier, and loses his grip on his pack as it comes loose from where he\u2019d been tying it onto Roach. He makes a grab for it and just manages to retrieve it before it hits the ground.\nGods, but Jaskier is infuriating. Geralt would do anything for him.\n\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d Jaskier asks inquisitively.\n\u201cAway,\u201d Geralt says dryly, \u201cfrom the Baron of Tridam\u2019s men.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says, mildly sheepish. \u201cYes, I suppose that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\nGeralt sighs. \u201cLet you out of my sight for a month, and you go and get yourself almost married, then almost killed,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Jaskier ventures, looking hopeful, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to keep an eye on me all the time, then.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Geralt swings himself up on Roach and offers the bard a hand to pull him up behind him. \u201cI suppose I do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEnd.\n\u00a0"
