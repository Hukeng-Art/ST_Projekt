    "text": "The timing\u2019s right, if a bit abrupt.\nIt isn\u2019t so strange for them, when you think about it that way. Shouldn\u2019t be strange any way you think about it, really\u2014there\u2019s nothing more natural and instinctual for humans, She\u2019d seen to that, and their bodies feel human enough. \nAziraphale watched the way Adam and Eve reached for each other, easy as anything. How there\u2019d been no shame, no judgment, no embarrassed blush across their cheeks, there at the beginning of the world where it was just the two of them. Nothing else but the other.\nStill\u2014somewhat surprising. And not. Somewhat unexpected, and not, how it happens:\nA night of drinking and discoursing and drinking like any other, and when several bottles are drained they go together to search for more in order to increase their chances of success. \nCrowley has the run of the cluttered kitchen in the flat above Aziraphale\u2019s shop. He knows its cupboards just as well\u2014fair half of the ingredients have been contributed by him over the years, spices fetched back from far-flung locales\u2014so Aziraphale hardly minds as he opens and closes cabinets and yanks out drawers. There\u2019s something reassuring about seeing Crowley so at home.\nAziraphale is annoyed with himself, when his thoughts are clear enough to focus on annoyance, that he forgot to do the shopping that day to restock. That\u2019s until Crowley, after a not inconsiderable amount of time banging about, comes up with a dusty bottle of cooking wine wedged forgotten in the kitchen closet behind a vegetable spiralizer. \nCrowley emerges triumphant and smiling, brushing a cobweb from his hair, and Aziraphale watches as he gently transfers the small spider that\u2019s fallen to his shoulder back to its silken thread, which he restores with a glance. \nWarmth rises in Aziraphale\u2019s chest like a kettle set to boil. His cheeks feel warm, too, already flush with too much alcohol, and that\u2019s probably why he goes over to Crowley and takes the bottle from his hands. Their fingers touch against glass in the transfer. Aziraphale barely glances at the undrinkable liquid. \nWhat he does is tsk, \u201cOh, my dear, this will never do,\u201d and the miracle flows through his fingers and in an instant it\u2019s something else.\n\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley breathes then, sounding surprised first, then touched, then something like\u2014something like reverent. As close to reverent as a demon can sidle.\nAziraphale looks down and realizes what he\u2019s done. The bottle is now a vintage of red from a little town in northeast France they traveled through in 1912. During the terrible war that followed the town and all the fields around it had burned and burned and this vineyard never replanted. It was a wine that in passing, over dinner more than a hundred years ago, Crowley praised as the best he ever had. \nCrowley takes back the wine and sets it on the countertop with a careful click. One moment Aziraphale is observing him do that, and the next moment Aziraphale\u2019s back collides with the closet door. Crowley has spun him around and pushed him against it quite firmly. \nThen Crowley is kissing him, hot and urgent and with an awful lot of clever tongue-work, and Aziraphale is surprised and isn\u2019t. \nAziraphale kisses him back because that is what makes sense, kissing Crowley, why, the thought crosses his mind often enough\u2014he just never had the sort of momentum that seems to fire up Crowley now. Crowley whose hands are shaking before they ball up as fists on Aziraphale\u2019s lapels, Crowley who keeps kissing him and kissing him like otherwise he\u2019ll drown.\nThey\u2019ve long been building to this, Aziraphale knows, which is why he was never in any hurry. He supposes they have now arrived. The timing, in the post-apocalypse-that-wasn\u2019t, is as good as any other. Perhaps it isn\u2019t a bit abrupt at all.\nOnly when Crowley is drawing Aziraphale's lower lip between his sharp teeth does some sense intrude through the haze of intoxication and adrenaline. \u201cWait,\u201d Aziraphale exclaims, his head thudding against the door as he pulls away. Crowley lets go of him at once and casts his gaze down at the floor, clearly gathering himself up for guilt and all manner of self-castigation. Aziraphale shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re too drunk.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d says Crowley. \nAziraphale has never seen him look so unsure. Considering that Aziraphale has seen quite the variety of looks from him over more than two hundred thousand days, it\u2019s a remarkable feat.\nAziraphale is extremely good at taking pity. He is also extremely good at trying new things. He is even better at savoring those that are sampled and found to be scrumptious. He decides to pursue all three of these actions at which he is accomplished. He fixes Crowley with a stare to keep him in place. His head is swimming, and it\u2019s hard to know how to start. \u201cI didn\u2019t say\u2014what I meant was\u2014oh, bother.\u201d With a concentrated burst of thought he disinebriates them both.\nCrowley blinks those inscrutable eyes. Newly sober, he rocks back on his feet but otherwise doesn\u2019t move save to scratch his head, and\u2014if Aziraphale weren\u2019t watching, he\u2019d not have believed it\u2014to blush quite furiously. \n\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d he starts, and now Aziraphale can taste his apology in the air. \u201cAziraphale\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I am,\u201d says Aziraphale, soft, and when he smiles Crowley falters. Crowley stands so quiet and still that Aziraphale aches with his friend\u2019s uncertainty and the idea that he could be the cause of it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I,\u201d says Crowley.\n\u201cIs it wrong?\u201d asks Aziraphale. \u201cAre we wrong?\u201d \nCrowley stares at him, struck speechless for once, then shakes his head at a nigh-on frantic speed. That can\u2019t be good for his poor neck. \nAziraphale says, \u201cDo you have bad intentions, my dear?\u201d\nCrowley colors anew. \u201cWouldn\u2019t say. Bad. Might say, impure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m an angel,\u201d Aziraphale points out. \u201cNothing I do can be impure.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Crowley. He brightens a touch, spine unbending from its defensive slouch. \u201cWhen you put it like that.\u201d\nAziraphale considers him. Crowley is fair vibrating with pent-up energy and emotion, held back by fraying strings but held. If Aziraphale laughs it off and suggests they return to the den with their bottle of miraculous Azy-sur-Marne red, Crowley will laugh also, and readily agree. That\u2019s why Aziraphale doesn\u2019t laugh. Instead, Aziraphale says, almost stern, \u201cSay you\u2019ll remain my friend.\u201d\nCrowley\u2019s nature has more duality than he likes to put on, which is how he manages to look deeply offended and deeply adoring at the same time. He swallows hard. \u201cAngel,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s the only thing I know how to be with any degree of success.\u201d \n\u201cThen don\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d says Aziraphale. He feels fond to an extent that threatens to overwhelm. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything else there is to do together, haven\u2019t we?\u201d \n\u201cWe have at that,\u201d Crowley allows. It seems he doesn\u2019t know what to do with his hands, what he\u2019s allowed to let them do, where they\u2019re wanted, so he jams them into his trouser pockets. \u201cJust\u2014just tell me. If you\u2019ve ever\u2014has the thought ever\u2014would you have considered\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome here,\u201d says Aziraphale, surprised to find he\u2019s grown impatient. He reels Crowley back to him by his collar. \u201cAnd kindly stop questioning.\u201d\nCrowley does. Crowley takes the command to be quiet in a way he\u2019s never followed any orders issued by powers that are higher than Aziraphale. He shuts his mouth, and the next time he opens it is against Aziraphale\u2019s mouth, and he\u2019s licking in like he means to memorize the shape of Aziraphale\u2019s teeth. \nOh, that\u2019s very good. That\u2019s very good indeed. Crowley keeps crowding him toward the wall even though there\u2019s nowhere else to go, as though he can\u2019t get in close enough. Given permission, there\u2019s no hesitation in his fine-boned fingers as he touches Aziraphale. He touches Aziraphale everywhere that\u2019s polite: runs hands through his hair, pets the back of his neck, arcs over the curve of his shoulders, tickles the back of his elbows, smoothes down his forearms, circles fingers around his wrists like bracelets. \nWhen Crowley reaches for Aziraphale\u2019s hand and takes it, while his lips prove warm on Aziraphale\u2019s jaw, then at his ear, Crowley does nothing but hold on. \nIt\u2019s Aziraphale, some moments into this hand-holding, who slides Crowley\u2019s hand down, down, down, to press and then cup the hard growing length of Aziraphale\u2019s cock.\nCrowley turns the sound he makes into a bite sunk not unkindly into Aziraphale\u2019s neck. Then he raises his head and meets Aziraphale\u2019s eyes as he strokes him through linen. \n\u201cThis all right?\u201d Crowley asks. His voice is cracked, warped, like he\u2019s speaking with great effort from a distance, like he\u2019s calling for help from the bottom of a well.\nAziraphale smiles, for he\u2019s found that it\u2019s a good deal more than all right. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cCan I\u2014can I lose\u2014can I get rid of\u2014\u201d Crowley gestures expansively between them with the hand not dedicated in service to Aziraphale\u2019s cock. \nIt\u2019s a leap they\u2019re taking, but how else would they go along? They\u2019ve covered the preliminary activities that humans call courting for thousands of years. Should Crowley take him to dinner first? Perhaps a movie? They attended the first play in human history together, sat side by side on the stone with the Acropolis looming overhead. They\u2019ve dined on every continent, strolled beside every river\u2014arm in arm, during eras when that was fashionable for friends\u2014picnicked under the stars and upon stars far from here. What more need possibly be done?\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Aziraphale. \u201cSo long as you swear to bring it all back eventually. I\u2019ve had this tie since\u2014\u201d\n\u201cVictoria\u2019s jubilee,\u201d Crowley says, although he slept through it. \u201cI know.\u201d \nThe bowtie he undoes like any man might, deft fingers loosening the knot. He unravels it with an expression on his face that suggests he\u2019s wanted to get his hands on Aziraphale\u2019s tie for longer than Aziraphale imagined. Then a blink of those impossible eyes and his expression fades into something more properly lascivious, and then there\u2019s no tie or any fabric to separate them whatsoever.\nAziraphale is fascinated. Once he starts he can\u2019t stop looking, his gaze raking Crowley from crown to toe. He\u2019s always thought his amicable demon lovely\u2014admired Crowley\u2019s sharp edges and lanky lengths, so well-contrasted to Aziraphale\u2019s own softness and compact build. Everything about Crowley seemed to sprawl, to take up as much space as possible and prove the pronounced narrowness of him a lie. \nAnd whenever Aziraphale was able to look at anything beyond his eyes\u2014when Crowley showed him his eyes, there was little use in looking anywhere else\u2014he had, of course, noted that nose with its darling hook, the expressive forehead, the surprisingly lush lips. \nNow he knows just how lush, and there\u2019s much, much more of Crowley to take in beyond the eyes.\nHis limbs are well-turned, steely muscle underneath smooth skin, his whipcord strength coiled inward, but waiting to be sprung; his cock, fully hard, is a match for the rest of him, long and proud, strained toward Aziraphale; just past his hips, the pert swell of his ass, such a temptation on its own Aziraphale nearly asks him to turn in a circle and show it off, which he thinks Crowley would be only too happy to oblige; and his hips, oh, his hips, rough-hewn from marble, exceptional handles for Aziraphale to hold.\nHe holds. Gooseflesh breaks out on Crowley\u2019s skin when Aziraphale is the first to reach. Crowley, unblinking, held, gazes at Aziraphale in turn\u2014lips slightly parted, hands clenched at his sides as though still uncertain of how he\u2019s allowed to touch, and how much. \nAziraphale has never dwelled overmuch on his own physical beauty, but seeing himself reflected in Crowley\u2019s eyes tips him toward the sin of vanity. Because the look on Crowley\u2019s face is stunned. Awed. Inconsolable, for half a breath, before that\u2019s pushed away and Crowley says, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tease,\u201d says Aziraphale without heat. In any other venture he\u2019d suspect Crowley of having mocking fun, yet there\u2019s nothing but truth in his voice as he repeats, stubborn, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d\n\u201cPerfection is a state none of us are meant to achieve, nor should we try,\u201d Aziraphale says around what he hopes is a rather fetching blush. This body given to him has served him faithfully, and he likes it well, all rolling hills where Crowley has crevices, the white-blond down of his hair creeping across his chest and the same pale gold at the base of his cock. His cock has been praised before, he\u2019s been told its shape is impressive\u2014it appears in a more relaxed state on quite some statues whose sculptors Aziraphale saw fit to indulge across the ages.\nHalf-hard from their kisses and Crowley\u2019s linen-covered caress, it is here his friend\u2019s eyes keep catching.\n\u201cAziraphale,\u201d says Crowley. He looks ready to shake out of his skin as Aziraphale\u2019s thumbs stroke the deep-cut lines that make their vee along his hips, or perhaps ready to shed his skin and become something new. \u201cNearly almost utterly perfect angel. Can I.\u201d\nAziraphale grins at this address, at the query. That might mean any number of things, but as he watches the dart-quick way Crowley\u2019s tongue steals out to wet his lips, to taste the air, irrepressibly snake-like, he has a guess. \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, since Crowley seems to keep needing to hear the word repeated from him. \u201cAs you like.\u201d\nWhat Crowley likes is to fold to his knees. It\u2019s done without even a hint of grace\u2014it\u2019s a collapse, a supplication. It occurs to Aziraphale that he\u2019s never seen Crowley kneel for anything, neither Heaven nor Hell, but now he kneels in the in-between, in the space that is only theirs. \nHe keeps his head bent. He stays like that until Aziraphale reaches to touch his hair like a benediction. Then his yellow eyes come up blazing and ready.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Crowley, with his uncanny tongue, would be given over to using it. What is surprising is the way it feels: like he trails liquid electricity along Aziraphale\u2019s skin, brings Aziraphale\u2019s cock to full attention at the first kindling spark of it. By the time he\u2019s slow-licked his way from root to tip, Aziraphale is breathing faster than he\u2019d like to let on, his head dropped back against the door with a thunk that makes Crowley flicker a smile into his skin as he moves.\n\u201cThat\u2019s, oh,\u201d Aziraphale starts, stops, when after a full revolution of the Earth around the sun Crowley finally takes him into his mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s.\u201d\nWhat it is cannot be spoken yet, for there has never been anything like this.\nThat Crowley is highly skilled herein and anxious to demonstrate that fact might also be expected. He\u2019s always enjoyed the heat of the spotlight, always loves it when a situation allows for his braggadocio to be confirmed. \nHe\u2019s never precisely said to Aziraphale, I am an artful master in the pursuit of cocksucking, true, never out loud anyway. But once or twice or twelve thousand times with how he shaped syllables and rolled his tongue when they were so drunk Aziraphale wasn\u2019t meant to remember it\u2014now, that\u2019s another story.\nSo Aziraphale stands\u2014or rather leans loose-limbed against the kitchen closet\u2019s door\u2014unamazed by this newish knowledge. Then the thought crosses his mind that Crowley became excellently versed in cocksucking simply so that one day he might be able to swallow Aziraphale down with such ease and style. This idea astonishes even as Crowley\u2019s hollowed cheeks make thinking a more difficult task to follow through.\nAziraphale, for his part, has had his cock sucked before, of course. He\u2019ll try anything once, then gladly thrice, should it prove satisfying. \nHe\u2019d grown curious over the millennia, dabbled here and there, peered into what each new century dreamed up. Humans are endlessly fascinating, endlessly inventive. He was careful not to grow attached to any passing partner, knew he could not keep them, nor they hold onto him, not when their delicate mortal lives slipped by so quickly. \nBut Crowley\u2014well, Aziraphale is aware that when it comes to Crowley he\u2019s grown rather attached. How could he not, with Crowley his only constant, Crowley there to smirk and leer and joke and squabble and plot and laugh and drink and talk and stroll with him arm-in-arm across the ages. \nCrowley on his knees with Aziraphale\u2019s cock down his throat and a look in those serpentine eyes as though he\u2019s quite prepared to remain like this and never find his feet again. \nAziraphale strokes his hair in encouragement, and oh, Crowley seems to like that very much, so Aziraphale, experimental, makes his hand a fist in those fire-tinged locks and lightly tugs. Crowley gives a choking sound that travels through Aziraphale\u2019s cock and climbs the stairs all the way up to his brain, where it beats upon the gate. \nFor a moment they stare at each other. Then slowly, deliberately, Aziraphale pulls harder.\nCrowley moves back with a jerk of his head, his mouth coming free with the most obscene sound Aziraphale has heard since the Hellfire Club, and Aziraphale blinks, wonders if he misread. He does not often do so.\nHas not, in fact, for Crowley\u2019s tongue wets his lips and he gazes up at Aziraphale and says quite clearly: \u201cUse me.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re quite sure,\u201d says Aziraphale, unwilling to pretend they don\u2019t know what Crowley is asking for. His own continued interest can be observed by the unwavering length of his cock, which Crowley tilts up to tongue as though the momentary lack of contact between mouth and Aziraphale has proved unbearable.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nAziraphale nods. Easy enough to take Crowley by that pointed, stubborn chin, to tighten his hand until Crowley\u2019s lips part in a delectable \u2018O,\u2019 and then Aziraphale is thrusting in at his own discretion. He runs his hand up, makes it a new fist in Crowley\u2019s hair, a fist strict enough to keep him in place. He watches Crowley\u2019s eyelashes flutter against his cheek as his cheek distends with Aziraphale\u2019s cock. As Crowley calls on however many thousands of years of training to take him down without protest and with every indication of fierce, wanting welcome.\nUse me, please, Crowley had said, so Aziraphale takes him at his word. He thrusts into the wet heat of Crowley\u2019s mouth, finding it more remarkable with every slide out, then in, the pleasure building in his belly but not restricted there\u2014it courses through his blood and soaks into his bones. \nHis hand tightens in Crowley\u2019s hair, unrelenting, and sometimes he pushes Crowley\u2019s head down\u2014not hard enough to truly hurt, but insistent, in command. Whenever he does that it elicits desperate suction and a frantic tongue on the underside of Aziraphale\u2019s cock, silent encouragement beyond Crowley\u2019s low, muffled moans. \nThe truth is that Aziraphale likes this a great deal. It works because it\u2019s Crowley. He starts to think about how wonderful it is to finally have the means to make Crowley be quiet and concentrated for a length of time, to be able to control Crowley\u2019s speed. \nHe thinks, then, of every time Crowley has let his leaden foot fall on the gas, just to annoy Aziraphale with a burst of velocity, every time Crowley has taunted him for some anachronism of dress or turn of phrase, every single second that he walked next to Aziraphale with an exaggerated flaunt of his hips. \nAziraphale lets six thousand years of frustration and slights guide his motion, the pain of them riding alongside the pleasure. Whenever he thinks he may be going too far, too hard, too fast, Crowley gazes up from his knees with an expression on his face that is the closest Aziraphale will ever see there to worship. \nHe comes thinking that, feeling it leave him like a burst of light, and it leaves him that much lighter. The sensation of unburdening is incredible, and the bliss of his release is heightened as Crowley\u2019s eyes go wide and he drinks Aziraphale down so eagerly, so eager. \nWhen Aziraphale is finished and Crowley has swallowed his fill, he draws out, and Crowley presses his forehead to Aziraphale\u2019s bare thigh. He breathes fast, face wet with grateful tears born of their exertion. Aziraphale strokes his hair again, gently this time, and asks, \u201cIs that what you meant, my dear?\u201d\nIt takes Crowley some time to speak, and when he does his voice rasps. \u201cThank you. Yes. Spot-on.\u201d He looks up, the attempt to pull a cockier expression betrayed by the open, broken relief writ there. Even so, he tries to lighten the mood\u2014to deflect from how his hands are shaking. \u201cAlways thought you\u2019d have it in you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you now,\u201d drawls Aziraphale, and Crowley must still be recovering because it takes him precisely 1.7 milliseconds longer for the suggestion of his own words and Aziraphale\u2019s reply to register than it should. \n\u201cErm,\u201d articulates Crowley. He\u2019s still on his knees.\n\u201cDo return at once,\u201d Aziraphale says, and when he offers his hand Crowley takes it. Standing face to face, as though for a dance\u2014Aziraphale supposes it is, of a kind\u2014Crowley sways over him, tall again, and Aziraphale winds his arms around his neck. \u201cThere we are.\u201d\nCrowley is hard against Aziraphale\u2019s hip, hard to what must be far past the point of aching. Even so he keeps stock-still, except the thumb that he brings to trace the dash of Aziraphale\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cShame we\u2019re no longer filing reports with the home offices,\u201d he says, trying once more for levity. \u201cI\u2019d like to read this one.\u201d\nAziraphale purses his lips to hide his smile. Considers. He casts his eyes upward on cue, as though caught mid-filing. \u201cFinally found a use for that foul, mouthy fiend, Crowley,\u201d he dictates. \u201cHe sucks cock with aplomb, but I\u2019ve yet to put him through his paces. If he fucks like he walks he shan\u2019t last long. Advantage: Heaven.\u201d\n\u201cAziraphale!\u201d Crowley\u2019s exclamation is halfway between shocked horror and chaotic glee. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014angel, you can\u2019t go saying things like\u2014how could you even\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYou really must let me recommend a book or two,\u201d Aziraphale says soothingly. Against him Crowley is trembling with sudden agitation. Perhaps he went too far.\nBut then Crowley meets his eye, dead-on, unwavering. \u201cWell, do you intend to or not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, dear boy?\u201d\n\u201cPut me through my paces,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cSee how long I last.\u201d\nA delicious shiver of excitement tries to wend its way along Aziraphale\u2019s spine. \u201cI think that might please me very much,\u201d he answers, after a caught-breath moment spent studying Crowley\u2019s features, his eyes, his hips, his hands, his cock, and all around and back again. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve done a fine job already.\u201d \n\u201cNot nearly fine enough,\u201d says Crowley, almost at a growl, and Aziraphale finds himself backed against the closed door again. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand. I won\u2019t ever have enough of you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014oh\u2014terribly sweet,\u201d Aziraphale says, his \u201coh\u201d arising when Crowley bends to lick and suck at the line of his neck. He grins with his eyes closed, imagining Crowley\u2019s torment. \u201cYes, that\u2019s awfully lovely of you to say. Positively tender-hearted.\u201d\n\u201cNot sweet,\u201d Crowley hisses, lets himself be provoked. He nips at Aziraphale\u2019s skin, insists, \u201cNot lovely.\u201d But as he slips a clever, hungry hand around to Aziraphale\u2019s ass, which he squeezes, the game is up. If there is no beauty in his able fingers there is at least grace, as they are found to be miraculously slick and anointed with oil. \u201cNot tender-hearted,\u201d Crowley tries once more, his voice dropped lower than a hiss, even as his actions belie his words. He opens Aziraphale so carefully on his fingers that it is clear he is afraid that one or the other or both of them might break.\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d exhales Aziraphale, when Crowley has two tapered fingers sunk inside of him. Aziraphale is, at this point, leaning into the door at a right angle, as though reclining against a pyramid. His legs are spread, giving Crowley room to work, but it\u2019s not sustainable, and then he ponders\u2014the inclination, surely, has long been there\u2014\nIt is one of the precious times where they are aligned so well few words are needed, so ardent is their sympathy. Crowley seems to understand at once when Aziraphale lets an eyebrow climb in a question. His answering nod is fast enough, lightning-quick, his eyes of washed amber narrowing as he calculates.\nOf all the things they\u2019ve affected together, the temptations and damnations and distractions and divine interventions, this is but a little miracle. \nStill it feels quite wondrous to Aziraphale as for the first time in his storied existence, he is lifted from the ground without the help of wings. Crowley picks him up easily, still pressed firm against the wall, one arm under Aziraphale\u2019s ass and the other locked about his waist. He raises him high enough for Aziraphale to welcome Crowley between his thighs, for Aziraphale to hook his ankles snug behind Crowley\u2019s back. \n\u201cOh, well done, really,\u201d says Aziraphale, impressed, and a touch breathless even if he suggested the move with his eyes. He\u2019s never been able to hover like this in human-shaped form, and he likes it as much as he likes Crowley\u2019s dazed, hopeful smile, which he leans in to sample. Scrumptious. \u201cNot too much, I hope?\u201d\n\u201cLight as a feather,\u201d says Crowley. The curl of his smile shades more wicked as he resumes his interrupted attentions. Now he slides three fingers into Aziraphale, as expert in this as he\u2019d proved to be with his mouth. (Practiced for the same reason? For now? wonders Aziraphale.) \nAziraphale hums approval and Crowley kisses the pulse that jumps at his neck. Sealed against the door, Aziraphale with his eyes open thinks about how never once did they consider moving from the kitchen to somewhere more comfortable. Somehow it\u2019s right that they are here, that they are shoved together like this, the closet door creaking behind them. \nIt feels irresistibly, indulgently human at the same time they are aided by the arcane\u2014this is who they are. And it appears that Crowley might be content to stand until sunrise, learning all the little sounds he can pry free from Aziraphale with his fingers\u2019 tricks, but Aziraphale, electric with sensation, is losing patience. \n\u201cIt seems you desire for instruction,\u201d Aziraphale says, suggestive as a whispered secret. He\u2019s right: that\u2019s the ticket, because Crowley bites down on his own lip until it turns white, and his body bearing them both up shudders with reaction.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Crowley. His \u2018s\u2019 is drawn out between his teeth, as he slips for a breath into an old-fashioned manner of speech that reveals how close he is to the edge. \u201cAbsolutely yes, let\u2019s do that.\u201d He gives Aziraphale back the word he\u2019d so desired to hear when they began. \u201cTell me what you want, angel, and it\u2019s yours.\u201d\nAziraphale\u2019s hands are unoccupied at the moment, so he lets them come to frame Crowley\u2019s face. \u201cDear me, I thought it was already mine,\u201d he says, and the expression on Crowley\u2019s framed face shows him how a man can look happily ruined. \u201cBut what I want with what is mine is for you to fuck me\u2014thoroughly enough to make up for all of the times you threw me against a wall and didn\u2019t.\u201d\nCrowley, now appearing quite destroyed, kisses Aziraphale helplessly as he lines himself up. He doesn\u2019t need to be told twice\u2014he thrusts in with a swivel of those hips that makes Aziraphale\u2019s breath catch. But once inside him, for the first time in the uncountable stretch of days they\u2019ve known each other, Crowley goes slow.\nIt isn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not what Aziraphale expected, when he let his imagination drift and hold here. It\u2019s not like anything or anyone he\u2019s felt, because this is Crowley, and Crowley\u2014\n\u2014Crowley has adored him from the start, Aziraphale knows then. Crowley\u2014\n\u2014Crowley loves him, as no one has loved another before and will not again: for the entirety of existence, throughout the span of every age, loved even through a century of sleep, loved Aziraphale in his dreams. \nLoved him first and last, loved him enough to slip free the bonds of Hell and to no longer feel the loss of Heaven. Loved him enough to challenge the order of things, to challenge and change what order was, if it meant that Aziraphale would be restored to him. If it meant that he would one day be able to sit sprawled on a park bench beside Aziraphale, beside Aziraphale once more, on no other side but their own.\nThis and more Crowley tells him without words as he thrusts deep. Aziraphale, who can sense love, is so filled with it as to be incandescent. He\u2019ll become a star and go supernova if Crowley keeps loving him like this. And Crowley won\u2019t ever stop. He won\u2019t ever, ever stop.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d Aziraphale gasps aloud, as though they were any two humans caught up in the act of making love, but Crowley knows, Crowley watches the realization flood him. Still does Crowley respond as any human might, taking the admonition to heart, pulling back and thrusting in again, again, pinning Aziraphale to the wall, again, again, again. \nAziraphale cries out as Crowley lights him up from the inside, every drive delivered with only the purpose of pleasing him, of loving him, and Crowley touches their foreheads together as if that point of contact is all he needs. The restraint, the caution, are appreciated as thoughtful gestures, but really, enough of this:\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d pants Aziraphale, vocalizing their silent conversation, \u201ctake me, you sorry, spectacular excuse for a demon, you have me now, make me yours as you are mine\u2014you can\u2019t hurt me, Crowley, you couldn\u2019t if you tried, and you wouldn\u2019t try, you wouldn\u2019t\u2014oh, ah, yes, dearheart, that\u2019s better\u2014yes, harder\u2014ah\u2014you can go faster, I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m here, I love you, I\u2014\u201d\nThe report to the home office right then would read\u2014the demon Crowley displays remarkable endurance under strain, demonstrates an enviable resilience. More data is needed, much more, Aziraphale must keep testing him until the universe spins out before he\u2019ll be ready to write up his conclusions.\nHe comes again with Crowley molding him into the wall, describing now in detail every single instance he\u2019d wished to have Aziraphale like this. Crowley\u2019s gone unfettered as requested, fucking him irresistibly far and fast. Aziraphale comes spreading heat between them, saying in response to this event only, \u201cI do love you, I do,\u201d over and over, since Crowley has begged to hear it again, again, again, again, again. \nAziraphale feels Crowley hurry to follow him, Crowley\u2019s gasp, the pulse and spill of his cock that\u2019s held so tightly inside Aziraphale he may have to stay there. Perhaps they\u2019ll remain just like this until the end of days\u2014which they\u2019ll prevent once more\u2014so that they might return to this state, joined at body and mind and mouth, pressed heart to heart.\nEventually they unwind themselves and Crowley lowers him back to Earth. He doesn\u2019t let Aziraphale go far, chasing after kisses, tugging him back by the wrist for more. He wears an expression so brilliant he could ignite all of London, and so stunned that Aziraphale won\u2019t stop smiling against his lips to see it. \n\u201cI love you,\u201d says Crowley then. \u201cAziraphale. I love you.\u201d He declared it so in every motion that he took, every breath, but now he gives the words life. \n\u201cQuite,\u201d agrees Aziraphale in the understatement of sixty centuries, and kisses him. He\u2019s curious what his own face must look like, if the exhilaration and the depth of discovered joy shine through. Then he decides it doesn\u2019t matter. Crowley can sense his love now, just as he is newly aware of the dazzling heights of Crowley\u2019s. He\u2019s positive of it. He takes Crowley\u2019s hand.\nHow odd to know someone better than your favorite novel, to know that one day they were bound to find their way here, and yet not understand how much they loved without revelation. Love is the only secret worth keeping and it is difficult to give away, so it must be done by degrees. Kisses are a prelude, and bodies help, and confessions sing it into being. \nShe had given them this, Aziraphale realizes then, given her creations this greatest of gifts, to be like her in this alone. For love could be wrought out of nothing and then be called the most powerful thing in the world. Crowley knows now that Aziraphale loves him in return like a storm, more boundlessly than the seas, clear-eyed as all the knowledge contained in the books in the shop beneath them and in every book. \n\u201cYou\u2019re brooding, angel,\u201d says Crowley. He brushes Aziraphale\u2019s cheek with the back of his hand.\nAziraphale doesn\u2019t disagree, precisely. \u201cMore like musing.\u201d\n\u201cAnything I can do about semantics?\u201d\nAziraphale kisses him again. He is sure Crowley knows, but if he forgets, he\u2019ll be here to tell him how they love. He\u2019ll never be anywhere but here. He\u2019s always been here. It was only a matter of timing.\nIn the end it isn\u2019t strange for them at all. There began two in the garden, and two remain.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pour us some of that wine,\u201d says Aziraphale, as if they\u2019ve only just wandered into the kitchen, save that now Crowley\u2019s fingers are bound up with his. \u201cBe a dear and bring back my tie, won\u2019t you?\u201d"
