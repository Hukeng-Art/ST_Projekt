    "text": "Jaskier never expected to be back in King Vizimir\u2019s halls, not after the way he left them - not after having been dragged out, bound and gagged, to be thrown to the White Wolf like a bone to a hound.\nHe certainly isn\u2019t coming back the same way.\nHe left bound in silk ropes, but he returns clad in elegant silk clothing, his fingers glittering with jewels, the lute in his hands elf-made and priceless, the silver wolf\u2019s-head medallion about his throat gleaming. He left mute and weeping; he returns singing, the chorus of his Ode to Witchers light and merciless on his tongue. He left dragged between two human guards; he returns striding between two Witchers, Aubry on his left and Lambert on his right, and behind him through the portal come Geralt and Eskel and Yennefer, the White Wolf of the North and his right and left hands.\nJaskier left to the raucous relief of the entire court, all of them glad that he was the chosen sacrifice, not someone who mattered, and he returns to the dead silence of stark terror. They\u2019re not afraid of him, he knows that, but frankly he doesn\u2019t care. Seeing all those eyes fixed on him, all those faces that he knows so well twisted in fear and apprehension, is balm to the last few scars on his soul.\n\u201c...They stand beneath the banner of the Wolf!\u201d he finishes with a flourish, and bows to the assembled nobles of Redania with all the elegance he has. None of them seem to appreciate his efforts, though he catches Aubry\u2019s low snort of amusement.\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, King of remaining Redania, it is my honor and privilege to introduce the Warlord of the North, the White Wolf, ruler of Kovir, Caingorn, Kaedwen, half of Aedirn, and two-thirds of Redania, Geralt of the Wolf School!\u201d Jaskier carols, and steps to the side with another flourishing bow. Geralt steps forward, and as Jaskier rises he can see the tiny quirk to Geralt\u2019s lips, near-invisible from any distance, that says he\u2019s amused by Jaskier\u2019s antics.\nJaskier will give King Vizimir this much: he rises and greets Geralt without flinching, and welcomes him to the palace with a very good facade of courtesy. Jaskier can see the cracks, and he knows Geralt can smell how much King Vizimir hates and fears him, but it\u2019s a decent act.\nThey\u2019re here for the formal signing of the treaty that Jaskier wrote, the one that makes King Vizimir in fact, if not in name, a vassal of the White Wolf, bound to uphold the White Wolf\u2019s laws and keep faith with him. It\u2019s not much like the treaty the Count de Lettenhove brought to Kaer Morhen, because that treaty was a crock of shit, and Jaskier has taken immense pleasure in tearing it quite literally to shreds and letting Ciri use the scraps as practice for the fire-spells she\u2019s learning from Yennefer. The new treaty is much more plainly written and has a lot fewer traps in it, which means it\u2019s going to be a lot harder for the nobles of Redania to pretend they don\u2019t know what it says.\nJaskier might, possibly, be enjoying knowing that his family is going to have to read his treaty and swear to abide by it a little more than he ought.\nHe and Aubry and Lambert end up at the far end of the high table from King Vizimir and Geralt and Eskel and Yennefer, which means Jaskier can\u2019t eavesdrop on Geralt being imposing and Yen being elegantly nasty and Eskel being diplomatic - a shame, really, they make a great triple act. On the other hand, that does mean Jaskier\u2019s nowhere near the Count and Countess de Lettenhove, so at least he won\u2019t have to deal with that particular bit of nastiness just yet. Not that they\u2019ll dare to do more than sneer or maybe attempt to say something unpleasant - he doesn\u2019t think anyone in Redania is going to be stupid enough to actually lay hands on him.\nHe\u2019s still flanked by the Witchers, too, so the first part of dinner is almost painfully silent, because none of the nobles seated around them quite dare to speak to either of the imposing, grim-faced Wolf warriors. Jaskier talks to the Witchers, of course, but Aubry doesn\u2019t talk much at the best of times and Lambert is busy glaring at everyone, that being something he is good at and also something he was specifically tasked with doing by Geralt, who believes in playing to people\u2019s strengths.\nJaskier is rather impressed, therefore, when as the third course comes around, the pretty noblewoman, dark-haired and dark-eyed and dainty, who had the bad fortune to end up facing Lambert quite clearly screws her courage up and leans forward and replies to Jaskier\u2019s most recent bit of babble - about the food, as it happens - with a tentative, \u201cWhat sort of meals do you get in - in Kaer Morhen?\u201d\nJaskier beams at her. She\u2019s younger than he is - she wasn\u2019t one of the people who sent him off to be a sacrifice, and both Geralt and Eskel agreed that if Jaskier could get any of the younger generation of Redanian nobles to be even a little less hostile towards the Warlord of the North, it would be a fine use of his time and talents. \u201cFairly plain ones, my lady,\u201d he says. \u201cWitchers eat a lot, so the cooks make their dishes large rather than fancy.\u201d\nAs Aubry and Lambert have both eaten at least half again what anyone else around them has, the noblewoman nods in understanding. \u201cIt sounds very...rustic?\u201d\nJaskier wags a hand back and forth equivocally. \u201cIt\u2019s not much like Tretogor, certainly. Louder, often. Fewer stupid plots, more brawls.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a brawl in weeks,\u201d Lambert objects.\n\u201cYou had a brawl two days ago,\u201d Jaskier says, frowning at his companion.\n\u201cOh come on, that was barely a spat!\u201d Lambert leans back in his chair, throwing an arm along the back of Jaskier\u2019s chair and kicking his legs out under the table. The nobles across the table shuffle back a little in their seats in dismay. \u201cIt\u2019s not a brawl until you get over two dozen fighters.\u201d\n\u201cI stand - or rather sit - corrected,\u201d Jaskier says, and grins at the wide-eyed noblewoman. \u201cMore spats. And also brawls.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you scared?\u201d she blurts, and claps a hand over her mouth in dismay.\nJaskier grins wider. \u201cOh, I was at first,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all look so imposing, don\u2019t they? Well, maybe not Lambert,\u201d he adds, and Lambert growls and looks very imposing, actually, all lazy confidence and threat. Aubry snorts, very quietly, in amusement. \u201cBut not anymore.\u201d Jaskier directs his grin up the table a bit, to a pair of noblemen he remembers being among the people who agreed that he should be sacrificed to the White Wolf\u2019s lusts, and sees them both flinch. \u201cI\u2019m the White Wolf\u2019s; no one at Kaer Morhen would raise a hand to me.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says the noblewoman, eyes wide, and then she leans over the table a little further and says, quiet and desperately curious, \u201cWhat\u2019s he like? The White Wolf? Is he really -\u201d she breaks off and gestures mutely, an odd jerky motion like she doesn\u2019t quite know what to say.\nJaskier considers all the possible responses to that, from diplomatic to filthy, and settles after a second on, \u201cHe is magnificent.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, buttercup, what does a man have to do to put that expression on your face?\u201d Lambert murmurs, and Jaskier can feel his ears burning, but he gives Lambert an arch look.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d he returns in the same undertone, and Lambert chuckles.\nThe noblewoman appears to be turning the word magnificent over in her mouth like an unusual sweet. Several of the other people in earshot look as though they\u2019ve just bitten lemons.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve thrown your lot in with the Wolf,\u201d one of the noblemen sneers. \u201cHow...predictable.\u201d\nJaskier hums. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be an insult, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asks, tapping a finger against his lips. \u201cLet me see, are you trying to insult my intelligence, my loyalty, or my taste in men?\u201d\nMore lemon-biting looks. Jaskier chuckles. \u201cI mean, if it\u2019s my intelligence, I\u2019d have to point out that I am now the White Wolf\u2019s court bard, which is a far better position than any of my contemporaries at Oxenfurt have managed to claim, and I\u2019ve half a song cycle to my name already. If it\u2019s my taste in men, then I\u2019d have to wonder if you\u2019ve gone blind - you have noticed he\u2019s ungodly handsome, right? And if it\u2019s my loyalty -\u201d he drops the pretense of friendliness, and the expression he\u2019s wearing isn\u2019t a grin anymore, it\u2019s the baring of teeth. \u201cI\u2019d have to point out that Redania threw me away.\u201d\n\u201cTheir loss, our gain,\u201d Lambert puts in almost idly.\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather be court bard to a barbarian than a viscount of Redania?\u201d the nobleman demands. It\u2019s an article of faith for most Redanian nobility that being the lowest baron is far, far better than being even the wealthiest merchant or most famous bard or most triumphant general in the world.\nJaskier touches the medallion about his throat, the silver wolf\u2019s head that marks him as Geralt\u2019s. \u201cWell, the company is better,\u201d he says, keeping his voice light, and it takes a moment for the insult to really register. Once it does, the lemon-biting expressions come back in full force.\nThen the servants come around with the next course, and Jaskier subsides, letting the conversation die off again. The young noblewoman is eyeing him with deep confusion, but she stays silent until the meal is over and the dancing has started - King Vizimir and his queen leading off, with Geralt and Yennefer matching them. Jaskier and his bodyguards - since that\u2019s what Aubry and Lambert are, whether any of the Redanians realize it or not - move to a bench near the dance floor, and the young noblewoman follows them, drifting nearer as if by accident. It\u2019s quite a good act.\n\u201cA dance, my lady?\u201d Jaskier asks when the first dance is over and the rest of the court begins to filter out onto the floor. She nods, and Jaskier claps Lambert and Aubry on the shoulders and bows over her hand properly, and leads her out.\nOne of the nice things about court dances is they give the dancers time to talk privately - it\u2019s part of what they\u2019re for. Jaskier\u2019s partner waits until the music has started before she murmurs, \u201cYou like them. The Witchers.\u201d\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cBut they\u2019re -\u201d\nJaskier shakes his head and twirls her. \u201cForget all the rumors,\u201d he advises her. \u201cGo back to the old stories, from before the fall of Ard Carraigh. And then disregard half of those.\u201d He pauses for a moment to concentrate on a tricky bit of footwork. \u201cWitchers want to protect people. That\u2019s what they\u2019re for.\u201d\nHis partner frowns a little. \u201cBut -\u201d she says, and breaks off, and they dance in silence for a bit. It\u2019s near the end of the dance when she says, \u201cWould you be willing to come and talk to my friends, later? We - well, we all came to court after you were - gone, and we\u2019ve got so many questions, and no one wants to answer them!\u201d\n\u201cAs long as your friends don\u2019t mind my friends coming along,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning. Oh, this is good - this is exactly what Geralt wanted.\nThe noblewoman darts a quick glance towards Lambert and Aubry. \u201cAlright,\u201d she says, nervous but determined. \u201cI\u2019ll find you after the minuet.\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d Jaskier says, and bows over her hand again as the music ends. \u201cA pleasure to share a dance with you, my lady.\u201d\n\u201cAnd with you, sir,\u201d she says, and dips him a curtsey, and Jaskier hands her off to a hopeful-looking young nobleman and retreats back to the bench.\n\u201cYou heard that?\u201d he checks as Aubry hands him a mug of weak ale.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Aubry says. Witcher hearing, it\u2019s a marvelous thing. \u201cLook out, Yennefer,\u201d he adds, and Jaskier drains the mug and hands it back and turns to bow to Yennefer, who is grinning broadly.\n\u201cDance with me, little flower,\u201d she says, and Jaskier takes her hand and leads her out onto the floor with a laugh. Yen is a good dancer, and it\u2019s a fast-paced dance; Jaskier enjoys himself immensely, showing off with fancy steps and extra twirls until Yen is laughing and half the court is staring.\nAnd then, as the dance ends, Geralt steps in to claim his partner.\nNot Yen, for the record.\nJaskier grins up into golden eyes as Geralt\u2019s hand catches his, other hand settling warm on Jaskier\u2019s waist. \u201cYou\u2019re leading, then, my wolf?\u201d he murmurs.\nGeralt hums in answer, and swings Jaskier into the dance as the music starts. Jaskier taught him this dance - taught all four of the Witchers how to dance, in fact, when the list of people coming to this treaty-signing had been agreed upon, though Lambert and Aubry don\u2019t plan to actually join the ball. Witchers learn any physical skill very fast, and Geralt dances as well as if he\u2019d spent years with a dancing master. Any Redanian nobles watching for signs of barbarian uncouthness will not find it in their dancing.\n\u201cMagnificent, am I?\u201d he murmurs after a few moments.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Jaskier confirms. \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be paying attention to your end of the table?\u201d\nGeralt shrugs a little. \u201cEskel had it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Yen was having fun scaring everyone.\u201d\nJaskier laughs. Yen loves scaring the shit out of people who really deserve it. \u201cAnd you just had to sit there and glower, hm?\u201d\nGeralt nods. \u201cOne of my finest skills,\u201d he confirms, a tiny quirk at the corner of his lips the only sign that he\u2019s teasing, and Jaskier laughs so hard he misses a step. Geralt doesn\u2019t let him fall, taking his whole weight without any sign of trouble.\nJaskier knows half the room must be staring at them. Men don\u2019t usually dance together, in Redania, so that\u2019s unusual enough, but the fact that he\u2019s laughing in the White Wolf\u2019s arms will cause severe confusion. With a little luck, it\u2019ll give the Count de Lettenhove conniptions. It\u2019s one thing to see your disowned son claimed as the White Wolf\u2019s, another to see him fearless and joyful and thriving. May he choke on it.\nGeralt bows over Jaskier\u2019s hand as he would a lady\u2019s when the dance ends, and Jaskier sweeps an elegant bow in return and turns to see if anyone else would like to dance. There is a little group of noblewomen...most of whom are eyeing Geralt as a dog does a juicy steak. Oops. Jaskier murmurs, quiet enough to be heard only by Witcher ears, \u201cHusband-hunters, my wolf.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, flat and irritated, but they knew this was coming. Well, Jaskier knew, and he warned Geralt and Eskel, but neither of them really believed him that there would be women willing to pursue the White Wolf, Warlord of the North, terror of the continent.\nThat\u2019ll teach them to doubt his warnings. Jaskier bows to the nearest hopeful-looking noblewoman, who can\u2019t politely turn him down, and leads her into a perfectly correct, utterly unremarkable dance, not bothering to add any flourishes when his partner is watching Geralt over his shoulder anytime the dance allows it. Geralt, poor man, managed to pick one of the old dowagers as his next partner; she\u2019s not interested in another husband, but from Geralt\u2019s expression, she\u2019s probably extolling the virtues of daughters or nieces for the entire length of the dance.\nThis is what you get for being the continent\u2019s most eligible bachelor. Well. Geralt doesn\u2019t officially have a consort, but as far as Jaskier can tell, he hasn\u2019t taken anyone to his bed except Jaskier himself for the last several months, at least - and given that Jaskier spends just about every night in said bed, he\u2019d know about it. Neither of them has actually said anything about what their relationship might be, of course, Jaskier because he\u2019s terrified of the answer, Geralt...for his own reasons, presumably.\nHe does call Jaskier his little lark, though, and treats him with endless affection, in public and private alike, so Jaskier\u2019s not really repining. They\u2019ll figure it out eventually. Jaskier is content to be court bard and advisor, tutor to the princess and lark to the Warlord; he\u2019s in no hurry to add any titles to that collection.\nHe partners three more noblewomen for three more dances before the minuet begins and he finds himself tugged into Eskel\u2019s arms. \u201cPlease for the love of fuck,\u201d Eskel mutters, \u201cI need to dance with someone who won\u2019t flirt.\u201d\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Jaskier says, beaming, \u201cI am insulted! Me, not flirt?\u201d\nEskel sighs. He\u2019s as good a dancer as Geralt is, and his lead is easy to follow. \u201cFlirt badly,\u201d he amends. \u201cAnd not a one of them means it. Most of them can\u2019t even look at my damned face.\u201d\n\u201cWell fuck them,\u201d Jaskier says, and sets himself to making sure this dance is as fancy and full of flourishes as he can contrive. If the noblewomen of Redania are too stupid to see that Eskel is a damned catch - not that he wants to be caught, but still - then Jaskier will rub their noses in their stupidity, see if he doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cVicious little thing, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Eskel says, chuckling, as Jaskier twirls back into his arms halfway through the dance.\n\u201cYou know it,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cNo wonder our Wolf adores you,\u201d Eskel says, shaking his head a little in amusement. The words send a sort of warm shock through Jaskier: he\u2019s always a little surprised and a lot pleased when one of the Witchers suggests that they approve of his relationship with Geralt, but it\u2019s quite clear that they do. Even grumpy old Vesemir has given him a nod and a clap on the shoulder and a gruff word of encouragement.\n\u201cI am adorable,\u201d he says, covering pleasure with bragging. Eskel laughs, thoroughly cheered up, and Jaskier\u2019s grin broadens in triumph. Eskel is a sweetheart, and Jaskier doesn\u2019t like him to be unhappy.\n\u201cThat you are,\u201d Eskel agrees. \u201cAnd just as much a menace as the cub, too.\u201d\n\u201cI am flattered that you think I could reach such heights of mischief,\u201d Jaskier informs him. \u201cTruly, I am but an apprentice before her mastery.\u201d\nEskel laughs louder, and they finish the dance in matching high spirits.\nThe pretty young noblewoman is waiting near Lambert and Aubry, eyeing Lambert with understandable wariness. Aubry, for all that he\u2019s broad-shouldered and scarred and hulking as any Witcher, is so quiet that he tends to blend into the background a bit; Lambert has never mastered the art of being unobtrusive. It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s playing with a dagger, rolling it across the back of his hand and doing little tricks with it, pretending to do so absent-mindedly. Jaskier snorts. Lambert knows exactly what he\u2019s doing, and is enjoying scaring people. He\u2019s such an asshole, and Jaskier is so absurdly fond of him.\n\u201cHey, buttercup,\u201d Lambert says as Jaskier reaches them. \u201cWe off on an adventure, then?\u201d\nJaskier sighs and punches Lambert on the shoulder - the Witcher doesn\u2019t even flinch, naturally - and bows to the noblewoman. \u201cLead on, my lady,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd - forgive me - we have not yet been introduced, and I would know the name of the beautiful lady who gave me the honor of so lovely a dance!\u201d\n\u201cMilena de Roggeven,\u201d she says, curtseying a little. Jaskier carefully doesn\u2019t let his expression change: this is a duke\u2019s daughter. He was not expecting that. A younger daughter, surely, to have been so far down the high table, but still - if he can win her over even a little, that\u2019s quite a foothold for Geralt in the Redanian court.\nShe leads Jaskier and his Witcher guards away from the ballroom and into the gardens, which are well-lit and full of people promenading to see and be seen. Most of them give Jaskier extremely dubious looks as their little party goes by. Their destination is a large gazebo some way off the usual paths, where seven nervous-looking young nobles are clustered, goblets in hand, trying to look like they\u2019re just idly passing the time instead of waiting. Subterfuge is not their strong suit. Jaskier was sneakier than this when he was twelve.\nThey all draw back a little when Milena and Jaskier and Lambert and Aubry step into the gazebo. They\u2019re not scared of Jaskier - no, they\u2019re all looking at Lambert and Aubry warily. Aubry sits down on a bench near the entrance and leans back against the railing and closes his eyes; Jaskier knows he\u2019s probably listening for anyone\u2019s approach, but he looks relaxed and harmless. Lambert, however, drapes an arm over Jaskier\u2019s shoulders and grins at everyone, showing all his teeth. Jaskier sighs at him.\n\u201cI can\u2019t bow like this, you ass,\u201d he grumbles.\nLambert just laughs. Jaskier sighs again and shakes his head before inclining it politely to the little cluster of young nobles. \u201cWell, I would bow, but as you can see, I\u2019ve been prevented,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cMy lady de Roggeven, would you be so kind as to introduce me to your charming compatriots?\u201d\nMilena nods and does so, and Jaskier files names and faces away carefully: the noblewomen are Hanna and Natalia and Oliwia, and the men are Piotr and Dawid and Karol and Aleksander. None of them is older than eighteen, by his best guess - Oliwia can\u2019t be more than sixteen. He didn\u2019t know any of them before he was sent to Kaer Morhen, but then, he was at Oxenfurt for a fair bit of his youth. He does know some of their parents. Some of their parents were among the nobles who chose Jaskier to be a sacrifice.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jaskier says, leaning against Lambert - as long as the Witcher is going to be annoying, Jaskier can be annoying right back. \u201cI understand from my lady Milena that you have questions.\u201d\nAll of them nod, but there\u2019s a brief silence before Dawid blurts, \u201cFather said - you were - what really happened? All we ever heard was that there was an - an attempt to placate the Warlord, and it hadn\u2019t worked, and you were...involved somehow, and now the Warlord\u2019s here and there\u2019s supposed to be a treaty and it\u2019s maybe because of you?\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s lips twist. \u201cOh, is that the story that was put about?\u201d he asks, keeping his voice light with an effort. \u201cFascinating. \u2018Involved.\u2019 What a charming way to put it.\u201d\nLambert makes a soft sound of concern. He actually saw Jaskier brought into Kaer Morhen, bound and dazed with fear, as even Aubry didn\u2019t. Jaskier pats the hand draped over his shoulder absently. \u201cDo you really want to know what happened?\u201d he asks the young nobles. \u201cI warn you, it\u2019s no pretty bard\u2019s tale, and some of you won\u2019t like what you learn of your fathers.\u201d\n\u201cTell us,\u201d Milena says. \u201cIt\u2019s all - whispers, and rumors, and no one will say anything outright. We need to know.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Jaskier says, and nudges Lambert back until they can sit down beside Aubry. The quiet Witcher puts a hand on Jaskier\u2019s back, gentle and warm and supportive. \u201cSit, sit, no point standing about, hm?\u201d The nobles choose benches of their own. \u201cSo, this was a year and a half ago, yes? There were all those rumors that the White Wolf was planning to take the rest of Redania; I never did learn who started them, because to the best of my knowledge, he wasn\u2019t. Still isn\u2019t, that I know of, unless King Vizimir does something truly idiotic. Anyhow. Someone - I think it might have been the Duke de Rinde - suggested that Redania should send the White Wolf tribute, to prove that Redania wasn\u2019t a threat. King Vizimir agreed.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes a certain amount of sense,\u201d Piotr ventures.\n\u201cOh, certainly, sending tribute to stronger kings to placate them has a long and illustrious history,\u201d Jaskier agrees easily, giving the younger man an approving smile. \u201cUnfortunately, that was also about a month after a really...remarkably nasty rumor about the White Wolf started gaining a lot of attention.\u201d He hesitates - Oliwia is very young - but nobles learn about this sort of nastiness young; they have to. \u201cThe rumor said the White Wolf liked to take young people to his bed,\u201d he says, choosing his words very carefully, \u201cand most of them didn\u2019t make it back out alive.\u201d\nMilena puts a hand over her mouth, eyes wide. Hanna and Natalia clutch at each other\u2019s hands. Oliwia squeaks and shrinks back against Dawid. The men all swear, quietly, and not very well. Jaskier could swear a lot better than that, a lot younger - but then, one learns such a lot at Oxenfurt.\nLambert says, \u201cThey fucking what?\u201d\nAh. Jaskier had assumed Lambert knew what he\u2019d been sent for. Oops? Lambert is staring back towards the ballroom, eyes narrowed and a fierce look on his face, like he\u2019s planning on storming back in and doing something violent and unfortunate to someone. Jaskier puts a hand on his knee to hold him in place.\nAubry is growling, very softly, more a vibration than a sound. Jaskier puts his other hand on Aubry\u2019s knee. This was not in the plan: they\u2019re supposed to be guarding him from Redania, not him guarding Redania from them.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cbecause of that rumor, someone - I genuinely don\u2019t know who - said that King Vizimir should send a\u2026\u201d he pauses and tries to choose a word that won\u2019t set the Witchers off. \u201cA person,\u201d he decides.\n\u201cA fucking sacrifice,\u201d Lambert snarls. \u201cThey thought the White Wolf would -\u201d he gets up abruptly and starts to pace, thankfully not anywhere near the young nobles - Jaskier rather thinks they might run if an angry Witcher gets too close. Which is a good survival instinct, to be fair.\n\u201cHow did they choose you?\u201d Natalia whispers. \u201cOr - did you volunteer?\u201d\nJaskier grimaces. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t volunteer. I was as scared as you can imagine, just like everyone else.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cI. Count de Lettenhove. Decided he could spare a son.\u201d\n\u201cYour fucking father?\u201d Lambert says, rounding to stare at Jaskier. \u201cThat smarmy asshole who tried to get that piece of shit treaty past us? Him? He sent you off to be -\u201d he breaks off, snarling under his breath, and paces faster. Aubry\u2019s hand on Jaskier\u2019s back has taken a firm grip on his doublet, as though Aubry is worried that he\u2019ll need to carry Jaskier off to safety at any moment.\n\u201cDo remember that we\u2019re supposed to be diplomatic,\u201d Jaskier says to Lambert. \u201cThat means not gutting anyone, in case you didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\nLambert gives him quite a good glare. \u201cI won\u2019t be gutting anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I will lay every coin I\u2019ve ever earned that you never told Geralt this. Nor Eskel, neither. Not in so many words.\u201d\nJaskier winces. That\u2019s quite true, actually. He\u2019s never felt it necessary to do so. He wouldn\u2019t be saying it now, but he wants these young nobles to be on Geralt\u2019s side, and the easiest way to do that is to point out exactly how much difference there is between what rumor said was going to happen to Jaskier, and what actually happened.\n\u201cSo no, I won\u2019t be gutting anyone,\u201d Lambert finishes. \u201cBut they might.\u201d\n\u201cI have great faith in Eskel\u2019s ability to remain diplomatic,\u201d Jaskier says.\nLambert snorts. \u201cI notice you didn\u2019t say anything about Geralt\u2019s,\u201d he points out. \u201cButtercup, this is the sort of thing we need to know before we step into enemy territory.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIt was a year and a half ago, I am notably still alive and also very happy with my current position in life, and the point is that although I got sent off as - yes, alright, a sacrifice -\u201d he turns back to the young nobles and spreads his free hand, the one not still holding Aubry\u2019s knee - \u201cthe White Wolf, it turns out, is far nobler in soul than any noble of Redania is in blood.\u201d\n\u201cHe is?\u201d Oliwia asks, eyes enormous. Milena is watching Jaskier and Lambert with something like speculation in her eyes.\nJaskier nods to Oliwia. \u201cWhen I was brought before him, I was asked what skills I had, and when he heard I was educated at Oxenfurt, and had the training to be a bard, he commanded that I should be given all the tools of my trade. And that night, before all his people, he proclaimed that I was under his protection; and so I have been since that day.\u201d\nMilena ventures, \u201cAnd he - he didn\u2019t -\u201d\n\u201cHe did not take me to his bed,\u201d Jaskier says, and then grins. \u201cNot until about three months ago, when I asked him to. And I assure you, he never takes anyone to his bed but those who want to be there. Nor do his bedmates take any harm of his attentions.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked him to?\u201d Hanna says incredulously.\n\u201cHave you seen him?\u201d Jaskier says, and fans himself ostentatiously with his free hand. Natalia giggles. \u201cDarlings, even when I thought he was terrifying, I could tell he was the handsomest man I\u2019d ever seen, and once it turned out he\u2019s...well, magnificent in every possible way,\u201d he shrugs, spreading his hand wide. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d\nAll of the young nobles are looking scandalized, but Oliwia sighs a little like she finds the whole tale rather romantic, which is exactly the note Jaskier wanted to hit.\n\u201cBut,\u201d says Milena, bringing them back to the point with a frown, \u201cnone of our parents knew that. They all thought they were sending you off to be -\u201d she hesitates, trying to choose a word.\n\u201cSacrificed,\u201d Lambert says bitterly. \u201cTo the White Wolf\u2019s monstrous and insatiable lusts.\u201d\n\u201cThat was downright eloquent,\u201d Jaskier says, rather impressed.\n\u201cI do listen to your songs,\u201d Lambert says.\n\u201cI am very flattered,\u201d Jaskier tells him, and turns back to Milena. \u201cIn any case, yes. Your parents - the whole court - were quite sure they were sending me to my death. I believe they\u2019re feeling rather...embarrassed about it now. Especially as I have done so well by the fate which they thought would be my end.\u201d\n\u201cBut how could they?\u201d Oliwia asks plaintively. \u201cHow could they - how could your father - it\u2019s not right, that they did that!\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Jaskier tells her gently. \u201cI have prospered by it, but that is no virtue of their sending me. It is that the White Wolf is - among his many other qualities - a good man, and a good king. King Vizimir sent me into the jaws of the wolf; the Wolf himself has protected me. Which do you think more virtuous?\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Oliwia asks, looking on the verge of tears. \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d\nJaskier sighs. \u201cPeople do dreadful things when they\u2019re scared.\u201d\nJaskier stays and talks with the young nobles until the ball starts to break up, telling stories of the White Wolf\u2019s general magnificence and answering their questions, and then Lambert and Aubry herd him back into the palace and one of the servants shows them to the suite of rooms that has been set aside for the Warlord\u2019s party. Geralt and Eskel and Yennefer are already there, Yen draped over a chaise longue looking cheerful and elegant, Geralt and Eskel sitting on the hearth whetting their swords. Lambert deposits Jaskier in an armchair and says, \u201cSo, o White Wolf, do you know what these fuckers thought was going to happen to your bard when he got to Kaer Morhen?\u201d\n\u201cLambert,\u201d Jaskier hisses. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to -\u201d\n\u201cOh, but I do,\u201d Lambert says, and Aubry nods.\n\u201cThey need to know,\u201d he says, and Jaskier sags back in the chair and sighs, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.\n\u201cWhat did they think?\u201d Geralt asks, his voice very level, the way it is when he\u2019s deliberately suppressing all emotion.\nLambert starts pacing again, growling between his teeth. \u201cThey sent him to you to be fucking raped to death, Geralt. That\u2019s what they thought you\u2019d do.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d says Eskel, and Jaskier hears the soft clink of a sword being set down on stone. \u201cThat would explain how scared you were, wouldn\u2019t it, Jaskier.\u201d\n\u201cIt was more than a year ago,\u201d Jaskier says to the darkness behind his eyes, fairly sure whatever he says won\u2019t make a difference at this point. He doesn\u2019t dare open his eyes and see whatever expression Geralt might be wearing. \u201cAnd I might point out that Geralt didn\u2019t do me any harm. Then or ever.\u201d\n\u201cLittle flower,\u201d Yen says, almost gently. \u201cWe still needed to know this, because it makes a difference whether we\u2019re negotiating with a king who sent you off as a rather badly-thought-out attempt to bribe the Wolf with a pretty young bard to grace his bed and his feasting hall, or as a frankly insulting offer of a ready-made victim.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. He hadn\u2019t quite thought of it like that.\n\u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt rasps, and Jaskier opens his eyes to see that Geralt is kneeling in front of his armchair, sword set aside, hands hovering over Jaskier\u2019s knees like he\u2019s almost afraid to touch. \u201cLittle lark, I -\u201d He breaks off, and there\u2019s genuine pain in those golden eyes. \u201cDid - do you want -\u201d\nJaskier gapes for a moment before he realizes what Geralt is asking, and then he slides out of the chair and into Geralt\u2019s arms, winding his own arms around Geralt\u2019s shoulders and hanging on as hard as he can. \u201cYou have never forced me,\u201d he says against Geralt\u2019s throat. \u201cI want to be in your bed, I - I -\u201d\nThis was not quite how he anticipated making this confession. The audience, at least, is a little more attentive than he might have wanted, and Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure Lambert is going to give him all the shit for this. But Geralt is hurting, so Jaskier says, praying Geralt can sense the truth of it, \u201cI love you, Geralt. I haven\u2019t been scared of you in more than a year, and I fell in love with you - a fair while before I kissed you, alright? I chose. I still choose.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s iron-stiff muscles relax, and his arms wrap around Jaskier in a careful embrace. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\nJaskier pulls back enough that he can lean their foreheads together and look Geralt square in his golden eyes. \u201cMy wolf,\u201d he says, soft enough that maybe even the other Witchers won\u2019t hear. \u201cMy wolf, and I am your lark.\u201d He manages a tiny smile. \u201cCan\u2019t you smell love, Geralt?\u201d\nGeralt draws in a long, slow breath, and then, glacially slowly, he smiles - just a tiny upturn of his lips, but it\u2019s there. \u201cLike honey on fresh bread,\u201d he says softly. \u201cSweet and warm.\u201d\n\u201cThere, see,\u201d Jaskier says, almost limp with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s me. That\u2019s how I feel about you.\u201d\nGeralt nods a little, and brushes a tiny kiss against Jaskier\u2019s lips, then rises, bringing Jaskier up with him, and sits down in the armchair, pulling Jaskier down into his lap. Jaskier squirms a bit to get comfortable and ends up sort of draped sideways over his Witcher, head resting on Geralt\u2019s shoulder, legs hanging over the arm of the chair, Geralt\u2019s arm warm around his waist to hold him steady.\n\u201cAwww,\u201d says Yen, grinning at them. \u201cLittle flower, I know you\u2019re a bard, but you don\u2019t always have to pick the most dramatic possible way of doing something.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Jaskier grumbles without any heat in the words. Yen laughs.\n\u201cFair,\u201d she says. \u201cLambert, stop glowering, you\u2019re as bad as Geralt sometimes. Eskel, stop looking like you want to gut someone. I think we can all agree Jaskier has dibs on that. Or maybe Geralt does, I\u2019m not sure. Now: how does this change our negotiation strategy?\u201d\nEskel frowns and settles back, picking his sword back up and going back to whetting it. \u201cNot much, actually,\u201d he says at last. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to the Wolf, but we already knew they thought Witchers were monsters. We were already planning to shove the treaty down King Vizimir\u2019s throat whether he likes it or not. Which he won\u2019t. This...mostly just gives us a tool to undermine him, if we want to, and to keep a fair number of the great nobles from daring to defy us. Especially if Jaskier\u2019s conversation tonight bears any fruit, and the younger nobles start talking about the...lack of honor inherent in sending a lad off to be killed.\u201d\n\u201cThink it worked pretty well,\u201d Aubry says. \u201cThey were proper horrified, but they believed him.\u201d\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cI vote we write something into the treaty saying the fucking Count de Lettenhove never sets foot in the White Wolf\u2019s lands again,\u201d Lambert says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Geralt says before Jaskier can respond. \u201cYen, warn Vizimir to send him away before tomorrow. If I see him again, he dies.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Jaskier says. That\u2019s...vicious but sort of sweet. \u201cThat\u2019s not terribly diplomatic.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cSending you to be the White Wolf\u2019s plaything was bad enough. If he thought he was sending you to die - no. If I ever see him again, he dies.\u201d\n\u201cOr me,\u201d Lambert growls.\n\u201cOr me,\u201d Aubry agrees.\n\u201cI\u2019d probably just curse him into some sort of horrible misshapen monstrosity, to match his soul,\u201d Yen says, rising elegantly from her couch. \u201cI\u2019ll just go talk to King Vizimir, shall I?\u201d She pats Jaskier\u2019s shoulder as she passes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little flower; I won\u2019t do anything before I issue a warning. Mind, if I happen to run across him afterward\u2026\u201d\nAubry falls in beside her as she leaves the suite. Jaskier sighs and closes his eyes, nestling a little closer to Geralt. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that big a deal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou knew they sent me as tribute.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s tribute and there\u2019s tribute, little lark,\u201d Geralt rumbles.\n\u201cA king might send a bedwarmer to another king, in mutual respect,\u201d Eskel puts in. \u201cSending a sacrifice isn\u2019t respect - it\u2019s an insult.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it had been Oliwia, buttercup?\u201d Lambert asks. Jaskier goes still. Little Oliwia, barely sixteen and still as naive as any noble child gets - if she had been sent as a sacrifice, that would have been -\n\u201cMonstrous,\u201d he says, through a dry throat. \u201cThat would be monstrous, and a grave insult to the Wolf, that anyone would think he would do harm to such an innocent - that he would be that sort of monster.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Geralt rumbles, and brushes a kiss against the top of Jaskier\u2019s head. \u201cSending you was monstrous - though I am grateful to have you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Jaskier says, and thinks about that for a while. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well?\u201d\n\u201cIt ends when Vizimir signs the treaty and we can go back to Kaer Morhen and never see any of these conniving, monstrous bastards again,\u201d Eskel says firmly.\nJaskier thinks of something abruptly, and sits up, eyes shooting open. \u201cMonstrous or not, please don\u2019t -\u201d\n\u201cThey may be monsters, but we won\u2019t start hunting until we have to,\u201d Lambert says, grinning with all his teeth. \u201cMind you, if they ever do something like this again...\u201d He trails off and draws a dagger from his belt, tossing it idly into the air and catching it again neatly before throwing it with impeccable accuracy to imbed itself in the painting of King Vizimir which hangs above the fireplace. \u201cThen I guess Geralt gets to be warlord of all Redania.\u201d\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Geralt says, and tugs Jaskier back to curl against him. \u201cWe try diplomacy first.\u201d\n\u201cWhite Wolf,\u201d Lambert and Eskel chorus, and Jaskier sighs in relief. He hadn\u2019t thought -\nWell, he hadn\u2019t thought. He\u2019s put as much of that dreadful episode out of his head as he can, frankly, because the difference between the Julian who rode into the White Wolf\u2019s den, bound and terrified, and Jaskier now, bard and tutor and advisor, lover and (he dares to hope) beloved, is like night and day.\n\u201cAny more nasty little skeletons in the closet we need to know about?\u201d Lambert asks.\nJaskier shakes his head. \u201cNone I can think of.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank the gods for that.\u201d Lambert finally sits down on a sofa near the fire and sprawls out. \u201cI need a fucking drink.\u201d\n\u201cNo getting drunk in Redania,\u201d Eskel says.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Lambert sighs.\n*\nYen comes back about a quarter of an hour later, looking viciously pleased with herself; Aubry, behind her, also looks pleased, if quieter about it. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve put the fear of the Wolf into King Vizimir and the Count de Lettenhove,\u201d Yen says, draping herself back over the chaise longue and grinning. \u201cIf that cowardly fuck isn\u2019t halfway back to Lettenhove by dawn, I\u2019ll eat my favorite shoes without salt. How a man like that sired you, little flower, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for the compliment, I think,\u201d Jaskier says, woken from drowsing on Geralt\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid you curse him?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Yen says. \u201cThought about it, though. I think he\u2019d make a good slug.\u201d\nJaskier can\u2019t help feeling sort of warm all over at the noises of firm agreement from all the Witchers. He\u2019s never felt quite so - well, familial. This is what family is supposed to be, right? People who defend you even when you don\u2019t think you need it, against anyone and for any reason?\n\nThe White Wolf leads a mighty pack, aye a mighty pack he leads / bold and fierce and terrible are the wolves who run behind him / At his right hand runs a wolf as like him as a shadow / at his left hand runs a witch with violet eyes like flames / at his shoulder runs a wolf as wise as any druid / and there above his head there flies a lark to sing his praise.\n\nHm. There\u2019s definitely something there; he\u2019ll have to work on it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re composing again, little lark,\u201d Geralt says, sounding fond and amused. \u201cBed; it\u2019s late. Tomorrow we make Vizimir choke on that treaty.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you most verbose when you\u2019re threatening horrid vengeance?\u201d Jaskier complains as Geralt stands, Jaskier cradled in his arms. Geralt chuckles and nuzzles Jaskier\u2019s hair without answering.\n\u201cGoodnight, I guess,\u201d Jaskier calls over Geralt\u2019s shoulder as Geralt carries him into one of the bedrooms of the suite. Yen waves languidly at him, grinning. Lambert snorts amusement. Eskel shakes his head.\n\u201cGoodnight, Jaskier.\u201d\n*\nJaskier wakes up wrapped up in Geralt\u2019s arms, one heavy leg thrown over both of his, like Geralt is worried he\u2019ll vanish in the middle of the night. It\u2019s not quite dawn; there\u2019s a bird singing outside the shuttered window, chirping its little heart out.\nGeralt\u2019s breath is warm against Jaskier\u2019s throat, its slow rhythm soothing and familiar after three months of sharing a bed. He\u2019ll be awake soon, Jaskier knows; Geralt rarely sleeps past dawn. For now, though, Jaskier can look his fill: Geralt looks much younger in his sleep, all the worry smoothed out of his brow, the beautiful sweep of his eyelashes against his cheekbones like a song too lovely for a human throat to sing. His hair is a little disheveled, like moonlight tangled on the pillow, and the scar across his eye is that perfect note of imperfection that saves him from being too handsome to be real.\n\u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt says softly, without opening his eyes. \u201cAwake already?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re not a dream come true,\u201d Jaskier says, lifting one hand to brush a strand of pale hair away from Geralt\u2019s face. \u201cMy wolf.\u201d\nGeralt opens his eyes slowly, and Jaskier stares into molten gold like sunrise, and loses his heart all over again. \u201cYour wolf,\u201d Geralt says, and leans in for a kiss, so slow and gentle Jaskier feels like he\u2019s melting into it, becoming as sweet and liquid as honey.\n\u201cI do love you,\u201d Jaskier says as their lips part again, some uncounted minutes later. \u201cI - maybe would have picked a better time to say it, but -\u201d\nGeralt smiles. \u201cHoney and fresh bread,\u201d he says. \u201cI should\u2019ve figured it out sooner, my little lark.\u201d He pauses, and his brow furrows a little. \u201cYou can\u2019t smell,\u201d he says, almost to himself.\n\u201cI mean, I have a decent sense of smell for a human,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cI love you.\u201d\nJaskier gapes. He doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting, but - that - just like that? So easily? He hadn\u2019t thought Geralt would just - say it.\n\u201cI think you like rendering me speechless,\u201d he grumbles at last. Geralt chuckles and kisses him, and Jaskier decides that grumbling is much less important than being kissed breathless. He doesn\u2019t know who taught Geralt to kiss, but if he ever meets them - assuming they\u2019re still alive - he owes them thanks, and maybe a ballad or two, because ye gods the man can kiss. It\u2019s a little like being swept away by a particularly amorous ocean wave, overwhelming and disorienting and glorious.\nHe\u2019s not sure how long they might have lain there, kissing languidly, if someone hadn\u2019t knocked heavily on the bedroom door. \u201cGet your damn trousers on, Wolf,\u201d Lambert calls. \u201cFaster we get this fucking treaty signed, faster we can get out of this fucking cesspit of a city.\u201d\nJaskier sighs. \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d he points out. \u201cIf rather rude about it.\u201d\n\u201cIs Lambert ever polite?\u201d Geralt asks, smirking, and kisses Jaskier again, sweet and brief, before rolling away to find his clothing. Jaskier sighs and follows the White Wolf out of bed.\n*\nKing Vizimir is, indeed, not happy with the proposed text of the treaty between what\u2019s left of Redania and the White Wolf\u2019s holdings. He hems and haws and objects to every line, and Geralt, across the table, crosses his arms and looks at King Vizimir, golden eyes like fierce sunlight, and says, \u201cThat\u2019s my offer. Take it or leave it,\u201d and smiles like a wolf, all teeth and no humor.\n\u201cHonestly I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t take it,\u201d Yennefer says, leaning on Geralt\u2019s left shoulder and inspecting her nails ostentatiously. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to turn anyone into a slug in years. I need the practice.\u201d\n\u201cLeave some for me,\u201d Eskel says from his place behind Geralt\u2019s right shoulder, and grins just as wolfishly as his leader. \u201cThis treaty\u2019s a lot fairer than what that piece of shit brought to us. Fewer nasty little traps.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cWolves don\u2019t like tricks, you know. Makes us downright testy.\u201d\nLambert contributes a low, reverberating snarl. Aubry doesn\u2019t bother to make a sound: he\u2019s glowering as well as the White Wolf at his worst, and when he wants to be, it turns out he can be remarkably imposing.\nAs the only ordinary human in the little group, Jaskier should feel outnumbered and probably terrified, but honestly he\u2019s just impressed. It helps that he\u2019s draped across Geralt\u2019s lap again, lounging at his ease in the arms of the White Wolf, grinning at the flabbergasted counselors on King Vizimir\u2019s side of the table. See? he thinks, twiddling his fingers at them and smirking at their expressions. You sent me as a sacrifice, and instead, here I am again, alive and thriving. He doesn\u2019t know what they think his position in the White Wolf\u2019s court is, and frankly he doesn\u2019t care, as long as they realize that their understanding of the White Wolf - their assumption that the White Wolf, too, would see nothing of worth in Jaskier save an expendable fucktoy - was utterly and contemptibly wrong.\nAnd every word of that treaty is Jaskier\u2019s work, so Jaskier plans to count King Vizimir\u2019s signature on it as Jaskier\u2019s own final revenge. If King Vizimir had kept him, he might not be facing quite as blunt and unbreakable a treaty - might even have gotten the White Wolf to sign the first draft. But no! Here they are, and King Vizimir and all his counselors know that even though the White Wolf and his companions are outnumbered and surrounded, here in the heart of remaining Redania, it is King Vizimir who is quite thoroughly over a barrel. He can sign...or he can lose the rest of Redania, and probably his own head to boot.\nHe signs.\nJaskier takes the treaty when King Vizimir pushes it furiously across the table, examines the signature, blows on the ink to dry it, and rolls it up neatly, all without ever budging from his place in Geralt\u2019s lap. \u201cLooks good,\u201d he says, grinning broad and cruel at the Redanian nobles across the table.\nGeralt nods and stands, letting Jaskier\u2019s feet fall to the floor so he can stand tucked under Geralt\u2019s right arm, sandwiched between Geralt and Eskel. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be on our way,\u201d Geralt says, nodding to King Vizimir curtly. \u201cKeep the treaty, and we won\u2019t come back.\u201d With an army, he doesn\u2019t bother to say, but Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure everyone in the room heard it anyhow.\n\u201cRedania keeps its word,\u201d King Vizimir grits out.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Geralt says, and turns his back on the king, leading the way out of the grand meeting room. As soon as they\u2019re in the corridor, Yen opens a portal to Kaer Morhen. None of them want to spend another moment in this viper\u2019s nest of a palace.\nHm, Jaskier will have to come up with another metaphor; the Viper Witchers are actually quite nice people for the most part. Slugpit, maybe. Cesspit. Dump.\n*\nCiri is overjoyed to have her father - and her Aunt Yen and three uncles and Jaskier - back so soon, and displays this by pouncing on her father as soon as he steps into the great hall. Jaskier steps hastily to the side as Geralt rolls her off his shoulder and follows her down for a very gentle wrestling match, all flailing limbs and white hair and Ciri\u2019s bright laughter.\n\u201cI see the cub found you,\u201d Vesemir observes dryly, coming up to join them.\n\u201cThat she did,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning as she ends up sitting on her father\u2019s back and crowing her victory. Geralt sprawls out on the stone floor and pretends he can\u2019t get up under her enormous weight, groaning in mock effort. \u201cI see she didn\u2019t manage to bring the keep down while we were gone.\u201d\n\u201cNot for lack of trying,\u201d Vesemir sighs. \u201cWere you successful?\u201d\nJaskier holds up the rolled parchment. \u201cGot the treaty, and nobody got stabbed,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d call that a success, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nVesemir sighs at him, but he claps him on the shoulder, too. \u201cGood job, lad.\u201d\n\u201cWere you worried someone was going to get stabbed?\u201d Eskel inquires. Geralt rolls over, dislodging Ciri, and catches her before she can scramble away, pinning her to his chest with one arm and tickling her with the other hand. Ciri squirms and kicks, shrieking with laughter.\n\u201cI mean, with Witchers around, this is always a concern,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cHey now, I behaved myself like a fucking gentleman,\u201d Lambert says, draping an arm over Jaskier\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t stab anyone even a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cProbably better behaved than most gentlemen,\u201d Jaskier says thoughtfully. \u201cSince as far as I know you didn\u2019t fuck any chambermaids, either.\u201d\n\u201cWell, none of them were interested,\u201d Lambert says, wrinkling his nose and shrugging.\nYen exchanges a glance with Jaskier, both of them clearly more than aware of exactly how rarely that matters to most noblemen. \u201cTruly, you are a paragon of Witchers,\u201d Jaskier assures Lambert, and hums a little, finding a tune after a moment. \u201cThere was a Witcher well-behaved / whose tongue was sharp as any blade,\u201d he warbles, and Lambert guffaws.\n\u201cAw, buttercup, I get my own song and everything?\u201d He tousles Jaskier\u2019s hair and claps Aubry on the shoulder and goes wandering off down the hall, probably heading for the hot springs - all Witchers, as far as Jaskier can tell, are far more fastidious than most humans.\n\u201cHow does the rest of it go?\u201d Eskel asks, quirking an eyebrow at Jaskier.\n\u201cUm...His beard was shorn, his eyes were orange, his reputation daily made,\u201d Jaskier extemporizes hastily.\n\u201cI notice you don\u2019t specify what kind of reputation,\u201d Yen says, chuckling.\n\u201cNot orange!\u201d comes echoing back from the other end of the hall. Jaskier sticks his tongue out at Lambert\u2019s back.\n\u201cYou try coming up with a rhyme scheme on no notice!\u201d he retorts, not bothering to yell; Witcher hearing is a marvelous thing. Lambert makes a rude gesture as he leaves the hall.\n\u201cDo I get a song?\u201d Ciri asks. She\u2019s draped over her father\u2019s chest, hair wild, pink-cheeked and beaming, and Geralt is smiling up at her, that soft sweet smile that only Ciri ever earns from him.\n\u201cDarling, I will write you as many songs as you like,\u201d Jaskier assures her.\nCiri grins. \u201cI want one about the goose trick!\u201d\nGeralt puts a hand over his eyes and groans. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he mutters, and sits up, lifting Ciri off of him easily.\n\u201cNot the goose trick,\u201d Eskel agrees, looking pained.\nYen laughs. \u201cOh, do one about the goose trick, it\u2019ll be fun,\u201d she says, and wraps an arm around Ciri\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShow me what you got done yesterday, little menace. Your Papa needs to go wash off the smell of politics.\u201d\nVesemir sniffs pointedly. Geralt sighs at all of them, and takes Eskel\u2019s offered hand up off the floor.\n*\nGeralt announces the treaty at supper that night - or rather, he announces that it has been signed, and has Jaskier read the whole thing out, one sonorous clause after another. There\u2019s a cheer when Jaskier finishes, which is nice, and then Jaskier plays a few songs - not the one he\u2019s already working on about the goose trick - and there is general merriment, and Lambert gripes at him about his eyes not being orange, and Eskel laughs at both of them, and it\u2019s -\nIt\u2019s so good to be home.\nHe and Geralt herd Ciri up to bed when she starts drooping, and Geralt sits on the end of her bed and pets her hair until she falls asleep, while Jaskier leans against the wall and watches the White Wolf care for his cub and thinks entirely in incoherent adoration instead of something useful like lyrics.\nAnd then Geralt herds him down the stairs to Geralt\u2019s rooms. Not that Jaskier takes much herding. He hasn\u2019t slept in his own rooms more than twice in the last three months - both times that Geralt was out hunting something, as it happens - and most of his belongings are in Geralt\u2019s rooms, and there\u2019s a dedicated stand for his lute. He mostly only uses his rooms for composing, because it\u2019s hard to concentrate on writing when he\u2019s in the White Wolf\u2019s den. At least, it\u2019s hard to concentrate on writing anything but really filthy songs, which are fun, but not what he\u2019s supposed to be doing.\nGeralt tugs him down onto the bed as soon as they\u2019re both naked and curls around him, tucking his nose into the curve of Jaskier\u2019s throat. Jaskier strokes his hair, a little worried. Usually if they\u2019re both naked and in private, Geralt doesn\u2019t look so...distressed.\n\u201cUsually I can figure out what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jaskier says at last, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to have to give me something more than silence, my wolf. We got the treaty signed, no one got stabbed, no one got kidnapped by husband-hunters, we\u2019re home safe again...\u201d He trails off, waiting for Geralt to tell him what the problem actually is.\nGeralt sighs. \u201cYou thought I was a monster,\u201d he says, softly.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOnly until the moment I actually met you, my wolf. Even scared as I was then, I could tell you weren\u2019t - well, you weren\u2019t what all the rumors said.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and brushes a feather-light kiss against Jaskier\u2019s throat. Jaskier tries to imagine what the terrified Julian of a year and a half ago would have made of this moment, and comes up utterly blank: he could not even have dreamed of this moment, a year and a half ago, scared and alone and sure he was walking to his death. \u201cHard to kill rumors,\u201d Geralt adds after a few moments.\n\u201cI grant that silver swords don\u2019t work as well on rumors as on monsters,\u201d Jaskier allows, \u201cbut that\u2019s what my song cycle is for, you know.\u201d\nGeralt raises his head and frowns at Jaskier in mild confusion. Jaskier grins. \u201cYou have to fight a monster with the proper weapon, right?\u201d he asks. Geralt nods. \u201cSilver for monsters, steel for men, dimeritium for mages: you choose your weapons according to the fight. Well, the proper weapon in this fight is words, my wolf. Songs of the White Wolf in his glory, in his mercy, in his goodness, to kill the rumors where they lie.\u201d He brushes a thumb over Geralt\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cI probably couldn\u2019t even lift your swords, but these are my weapons, and I\u2019m very, very good with them.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and turns his head to kiss Jaskier\u2019s thumb. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d\nJaskier can feel his ears burning. A genuine compliment from this man, spare and blunt as it might be, flusters him far more than the floweriest praise from anyone else. \u201cPeople sing my songs - sing your praises - across your empire,\u201d he says quietly. Yen\u2019s been helping him get the songs published, send them out to every bard and troubadour in the White Wolf\u2019s lands, and the Witchers who go out to hunt monsters or make sure there\u2019s no trouble starting anywhere bring back fairly regular reports that the songs are often sung, both by professional musicians and by common folk who find the choruses easy to memorize and pleasant to repeat.\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt says, smiling so sweetly it almost hurts to look at. \u201cProtecting me, hm?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you protect me,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, and kisses him, deep and utterly enthralling. Jaskier figures that means the deep conversations are over for the night, and winds his arms and legs around Geralt and kisses back as filthily as he can.\nSome nights, their coupling is fast and fierce and almost vicious; some nights, it\u2019s slow and languid and so torturously good that Jaskier almost weeps with it; often, it\u2019s joyful and easy and full of laughter and - because Jaskier is Jaskier - song. Tonight, apparently, it\u2019s going to be sweet and soft and gentle.\nJaskier\u2019s reasonably sure none of the idiots who spread rumors about what the White Wolf likes in bed would ever guess that Geralt likes being gentle. Not to say he doesn\u2019t occasionally enjoy leaving bruises and bite-marks - and Jaskier certainly enjoys being on the receiving end of such attentions - but it\u2019s far more common for Geralt to be careful of his strength.\nThey\u2019re both too tired to do anything too energetic or involved, but Geralt\u2019s hand wrapped around both their pricks is enormous and warm and so fucking good, and Geralt\u2019s mouth on Jaskier\u2019s throat is an entire series of revelations, each tender kiss like a separate epiphany. Jaskier cards his hands through Geralt\u2019s hair and lets himself make as much noise as he pleases, knowing Geralt likes to hear his moans and whimpers and the occasional snatches of song-lyrics that slip unbidden from his throat.\nWhen he comes, it\u2019s not the white-hot ecstasy that sometimes leaves him breathless, but a slower, sweeter pleasure, like sinking into a perfectly blood-hot bathing pool and feeling all the tension leave him. Geralt groans softly and strokes himself half a dozen more times and kisses the last soft moans from Jaskier\u2019s lips and comes all over both of them with an almost startled gasp.\n\u201cMy wolf,\u201d Jaskier murmurs, as Geralt collapses beside him and reaches out for one of the cloths they keep on the bedside table. \u201cAnd what do we smell like tonight?\u201d\nGeralt hums and noses at the line of Jaskier\u2019s throat, breathing in deeply as he wipes them both mostly clean and tosses the cloth away. \u201cSex,\u201d he says at last, and Jaskier chuckles. \u201cHappiness. Love.\u201d\nOh, that\u2019s a new addition to the litany. Jaskier rolls over and kisses Geralt thoroughly. \u201cMy beloved wolf,\u201d he says as they finally part.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and smiles, golden eyes warm as embers. \u201cMy beloved little lark.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s heart turns over, and he buries his face against Geralt\u2019s throat and just clings. Fuck, those words, in that voice, and those eyes -\n\nThere was a wolf whose heart was held / beneath a songbird\u2019s wings...\n\nLife in Kaer Morhen settles back into its usual rhythms, and Jaskier devotes himself happily to teaching Ciri and writing songs and advising Geralt and helping Triss and all the other little habits he\u2019s picked up over the last eighteen months. Without a treaty to write, he\u2019s not in the White Wolf\u2019s office quite as often, but that just gives him more time to corner various Witchers and extract stories of their exploits, or read through the ancient books in the library, or bother Yen, so that\u2019s alright.\nAnd then, two weeks after they return from Tretogor, he\u2019s summoned to the White Wolf\u2019s office by Eskel. Geralt is nowhere to be found. Eskel is looking particularly harried, poor man, and Jaskier tugs the parchment Eskel is staring at over so he can read it, and finds himself gaping in dismay.\nIt\u2019s a xenovox-note from one of the Witchers out patrolling the southwestern border between Wolf-controlled Redania and Vizimir\u2019s Redania, and the Witcher in question was clearly utterly baffled as to what to do.\nConvoy of nobles, mostly women, the note reads. Say they want to come to Kaer Morhen. Six Redanian, three Temerian, one Cintran. Overheard them saying they want to court the Wolf. Send them on?\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says after a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s. Not. Not great.\u201d\n\u201cWolf took one look at that and ran off to hunt dinner,\u201d Eskel says.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Jaskier says, starting to grin. \u201cHe panicked again?\u201d\n\u201cHe panicked again,\u201d Eskel confirms.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s try to have some sort of solution before he gets back, then,\u201d Jaskier says, and pulls up a chair.\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Eskel says, scowling down at the parchment, \u201cis why now. We haven\u2019t had any trouble with husband-hunters before now.\u201d\nJaskier frowns. That is odd. Geralt\u2019s been the most eligible royal in the northern half of the continent for at least a decade; it\u2019s very strange that Kaer Morhen has not played host to at least a few very ambitious noblewomen.\nIt hits him all at once, and he drops his head into his hands. \u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI\u2019m - I\u2019m proof of concept. That a perfectly ordinary human can walk into the White Wolf\u2019s den and not be devoured.\u201d\n\u201cNot sure I\u2019d call you \u2018perfectly ordinary,\u2019 bard,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cBut I see what you mean.\u201d He pats Jaskier on the shoulder. \u201cIt was bound to happen sooner or later; now we just need to deal with it. Can we just...say these women aren\u2019t welcome?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you can,\u201d Jaskier says, raising his head and sighing. \u201cBut it won\u2019t exactly encourage their homelands to like you. It would be better to have a reason to reject them that isn\u2019t - well - that isn\u2019t \u2018the White Wolf will hide in the mountains until they all go away.\u2019 Or similar.\u201d\nEskel snorts. \u201cNo one outside of Kaer Morhen would believe that,\u201d he says, with a wry smile. \u201cPoor Wolf; at least I don\u2019t have to worry about this shit.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYou\u2019re known to be his right hand. There might well be some noblewomen who are willing to try for you.\u201d\nEskel shivers. \u201cOh fuck no.\u201d\nJaskier props his chin on one hand and gives the scarred Witcher a mischievous smile. \u201cNo? You don\u2019t want a charming young noblewoman in your bed?\u201d\nEskel shakes his head and rolls his eyes. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, and neither does anyone else in Kaer Morhen. Nobles are more trouble than they\u2019re worth. Present company excepted.\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure I\u2019ve been disowned,\u201d Jaskier says. The words don\u2019t hurt at all; he is far, far happier as Jaskier of Kaer Morhen than he ever was as Viscount Julian Alfred Pankratz of Lettenhove. \u201cAt this point, the only title I\u2019ve got is \u2018bard.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cCourt bard,\u201d Eskel points out, and then sighs. \u201cSo we can\u2019t just turn them back at the border. Alright, what sort of excuse can we give for rejecting them when they get here?\u201d\nJaskier hums and taps his fingers on the desk, thinking hard. \u201cWe need some sort of criteria,\u201d he says at last. \u201cA list of qualities required of the White Wolf\u2019s Consort that none of these ambitious ladies will be able to fulfill, but one that isn\u2019t obviously so arbitrary that we pulled it out of our asses.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Eskel, sounding very much like Geralt for a moment, and pulls a scrap of parchment closer. \u201cSuch as?\u201d\nJaskier frowns. \u201cWell, the big one, I think, would be respecting Ciri\u2019s place as Geralt\u2019s heir. A lot of these women, they\u2019re probably hoping they can be the mother of the White Wolf\u2019s dynasty.\u201d He winces. \u201cAnd we should probably start preparing for Ciri to be getting marriage offers, too.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s ten,\u201d Eskel says.\n\u201cNobles,\u201d Jaskier says, grimacing. \u201cBut at least Geralt can definitely make a ruling that no one may offer for her until she\u2019s old enough - that won\u2019t get too much pushback. I hope.\u201d\n\u201cFucking nobles. Right, so, some sort of oath to respect Ciri\u2019s position,\u201d Eskel says, scribbling it down. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll know if they lie.\u201d\nJaskier nods. \u201cBeyond that\u2026\u201d he hums in thought.\nThe door opens behind him, and Yen comes in and drapes herself over the back of Jaskier\u2019s chair. \u201cWhat are we up to, and why did I see Geralt heading up-mountain like there was a dragon on his tail?\u201d\n\u201cComing up with a list of criteria for the Warlord\u2019s Consort,\u201d Eskel says.\n\u201c...I can guess why Geralt\u2019s out, then,\u201d Yen says wryly. \u201cPanicked, did he?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Jaskier confirms.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got so far?\u201d Yen asks, and scans Eskel\u2019s parchment. \u201cHm. How about a willingness to give up all other titles? Can\u2019t have the consort having any ties to another country, after all.\u201d\nEskel nods. Jaskier taps a finger on the table. \u201cLoyalty - proven loyalty to the Wolf, above all else,\u201d he supplies.\n\u201cLack of fear,\u201d Yen puts in. \u201cThe Warlord\u2019s Consort can\u2019t fear Witchers. And can you imagine poor Geralt trying to bed someone who was afraid of him?\u201d\nJaskier and Eskel both wince. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says, knowing it to be perfect truth.\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Yen says. \u201cWhat else can we throw in?\u201d\n\u201cBesides being fearless, loyal, and willing to give up title and ambition for the pleasure of marrying the Wolf?\u201d Eskel asks, grinning.\n\u201cUseful skills,\u201d Yen puts in. \u201cDon\u2019t much care what, but a consort should be good at something.\u201d\n\u201cUnbribeable,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOr at least really fucking hard to bribe. Though I suppose that goes with loyalty.\u201d\n\u201cSmart,\u201d Eskel says, frowning. \u201cWarlord\u2019s Consort should be part of his council, I should think.\u201d\n\u201cGood with people,\u201d Yen says. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to be, and it isn\u2019t Geralt, bless the man.\u201d\n\u201cOh, put in something about being able to deal with Kaer Morhen,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Geralt would be willing to turn this keep into a proper court even for true love - hell, I don\u2019t think he could - so whoever it is, she\u2019ll have to deal with - well - communal bathing and semi-regular brawls and general chaos instead of court politics.\u201d\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Yen says, nodding. \u201cFuck knows I took a while to get used to that. I like it a lot better, honestly - fewer people lying to my face - but it took some getting used to.\u201d\nJaskier nods. \u201cBetter, but very different,\u201d he agrees.\nEskel grins. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll show this to Vesemir - and the Wolf, when he gets back - and see what they say, but I think it\u2019s pretty solid. If there\u2019s a woman in that convoy who meets all of these criteria, I\u2019ll eat my fucking hat.\u201d\n\u201cAdd one more thing,\u201d Yen says. \u201cMake it so that anyone who wishes to be the Warlord\u2019s Consort must win the agreement, freely given, of every single member of the Warlord\u2019s council - and his daughter.\u201d\nEskel\u2019s grin gets nastier. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s very good. We\u2019ll let the cub know she can have as much fun as she likes, scaring people off.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Jaskier says, starting to smile despite himself.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Eskel says, sounding very satisfied. \u201cI\u2019ll make a clean copy and show it to the Wolf when he gets back, so he knows we\u2019ve got a battle plan, and then we can send word to let the convoy through.\u201d He nods to Jaskier and Yen. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome, darling,\u201d Yen says, grinning. Jaskier nods.\n*\nThe thing is, Jaskier\u2019s not an idiot, as foolish as he may sometimes act. He noticed Eskel and Yen weren\u2019t specifying women in that list of criteria. He noticed, too, that it could be argued - without even stretching the truth at all - that he himself fits every single qualification. Loyal to the White Wolf. Supportive of Ciri. Unafraid, and with skills that are genuinely useful to the Wolf. And, if he\u2019s not dreadfully mistaken, approved of by the rest of the council, and the White Wolf\u2019s daughter, too.\nIf Geralt wants Jaskier to be his consort, then that list Jaskier just helped draw up won\u2019t provide a single stone to stumble over.\nWarlord\u2019s Consort. Now there\u2019s a title Jaskier doesn\u2019t know if he wants at all.\nHe\u2019d better figure it out fast, though. He doesn\u2019t have the luxury of panicking and retreating into the mountains, even assuming he could survive such a stunt.\nHe settles at his desk, staring out over the mountains, and does his best to lay everything out tidily, the way his tutors despaired of ever teaching him to do.\nA Warlord\u2019s Consort would have to be faithful, as well as loyal; that\u2019s the first problem Jaskier can come up with. Oh, Jaskier hasn\u2019t slept with anyone but Geralt since he got to Kaer Morhen, but he\u2019s looked. There are plenty of absurdly attractive people in the keep. If he were Geralt\u2019s consort, looking would be all he could ever do. Is he built to swear himself to one man alone, for all his days?\nMaybe not any other man. But Geralt\u2026\nWhere else is Jaskier going to find a man like that? And having had such a man, how could he ever be satisfied with less? Oh, he might miss women eventually, though he and Geralt might be able to work something out between them if it turned out they both wanted the same woman, or Geralt gave explicit permission for Jaskier to court some lovely lady, or something like that. But after three months in the White Wolf\u2019s bed, Jaskier just plain can\u2019t imagine settling for any man less beautiful, inside and out, than his magnificent lover.\nWell. Maybe Eskel, if Jaskier ever got the impression that the other Witcher was interested; but then, Eskel is Geralt\u2019s right hand, most trusted advisor and commander of his troops, very nearly as magnificent in his own right as his shining lord, so he definitely counts as very nearly as wonderful as Geralt is, and it wouldn\u2019t be settling at all. Anyone else, though? No. It would just end in disappointment all around.\nHm. The White Wolf\u2019s shadow is as dark as night / his eyes like embers glowing / and at the White Wolf\u2019s right he stands / all truths and secrets knowing\u2026 There might be something there. And Eskel should definitely have a song or two. Jaskier will have to work on that.\nBut anyway, some sort of monogamy would probably be fine, though if it starts looking like this is going to become a thing that happens, Jaskier will have to have a talk with Geralt about women.\nSo that\u2019s...doable, probably.\nWhat about actually being the Warlord\u2019s Consort? That would come with certain duties, Jaskier is sure...but then, he\u2019s sort of already doing them, the ones that need doing. He\u2019s making Geralt\u2019s reputation gleam, and helping with diplomatic bullshit, and advising the White Wolf\u2019s council. Being the official consort wouldn\u2019t change much of that. And Geralt certainly doesn\u2019t have some sort of set idea of what a consort ought to do; if he takes Jaskier as his consort, the list of official duties Jaskier already has on his plate isn\u2019t likely to change much. So that\u2019s fine.\nWhat of the other side of it, then, the possible drawbacks to being the Warlord\u2019s Consort?\nWell, the first obvious concern is that the Warlord\u2019s Consort is a far more likely target of assassination attempts than a mere court bard, even one who happens to share the Warlord\u2019s bed. But if someone can get an assassin into Kaer Morhen, past hundreds of protective Witchers, then...well, they\u2019ll have damned well earned their kill, Jaskier supposes.\nThe second obvious concern, at least for Jaskier, is that while the White Wolf\u2019s court bard might, maybe, be able to go out and wander like any other troubadour now and then - he hasn\u2019t yet, but it might yet happen in the future - there\u2019s no way a consort could do the same.\nOn the other hand, Jaskier wanted to be a traveling bard for two reasons: to get the hell out of Lettenhove, and to gather as many stories as he could. Kaer Morhen is definitely nothing like Lettenhove, and the Witchers of the keep have literal centuries of stories for Jaskier to turn into songs. He couldn\u2019t run out of inspiration if he tried. Even if he gets tired of singing about monster hunts and wars, the Witchers have borne witness to at least three centuries of history, and have frankly unique perspectives on it. So though traveling might be nice, it\u2019s maybe not as vital as it seemed at Oxenfurt. And there\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t go out with Ciri when she\u2019s older, maybe, to explore the empire that will someday be hers. They\u2019d need guards, but that\u2019s a bearable restriction.\nAlright then, last set of questions: would there be anyone better suited to be the Warlord\u2019s Consort?\nYen, maybe, as the leader of the mages who came to the White Wolf\u2019s banner, but Jaskier has gotten tiny snippets of the story of her failed romance with Geralt, and neither Geralt nor Yen wants to re-float that particular shipwreck. They make far better friends than sweethearts. And the Warlord\u2019s Consort needs to be able to flatter people as well as intimidate or insult them.\nIt could be argued that the Warlord\u2019s Consort should be a princess, but Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure any princess on the continent would be more horrified by Kaer Morhen - and terrified by its lord - than willing to deal with the interesting aspects of living with Witchers, so that\u2019s right out.\nWhich leaves as the only person Jaskier has left to worry about - or compete with, if this is a competition he wants to win - Ciri\u2019s mysterious mother. Because surely the mother of his heir would be the best consort for a warlord, right?\nBut Geralt has never breathed a word - even to Eskel, apparently - of who Ciri\u2019s mother is, or even if she still lives. He certainly has never suggested bringing her to Kaer Morhen.\nSo she\u2019s probably not in the running, even if there is a competition to be had.\nJaskier sighs and puts his face in his hands. And all of this worry - all of this very careful logical sensible laying out of questions and concerns, all of this weighing of advantages and disadvantages, is entirely beside the point. If Geralt ever asks Jaskier to be his consort, Jaskier will say yes before the question is even finished, because he lost his heart to the golden-eyed White Wolf of the North and he would do just about anything if it means he can stay at Geralt\u2019s side forever.\nGeralt may never decide he wants a consort - may, indeed, be perfectly happy to continue as they are, with Jaskier as friend and lover and bard and advisor - and if so, Jaskier will be content with that, no complaints at all from his end, as long as he is Geralt\u2019s little lark he will be the happiest man in Kaer Morhen -\nBut if Geralt ever does decide to choose a consort, by every god there is, Jaskier is going to do his damnedest to be chosen.\nAs soon as Geralt returns from his impromptu hunting trip - thankfully he gets back right before supper on the same day he left, and puts up with Eskel\u2019s teasing with a sort of sheepish grumbling - Jaskier is given free rein to set the stage for the welcoming of the would-be consorts, and he throws himself into the task with a sort of malicious glee. Yen helps, of course - her instinct for drama is impeccable - but Eskel and Geralt and Vesemir just sort of back away as soon as Jaskier and Yen start bouncing ideas off each other, muttering about going hunting.\nWitchers. You\u2019d think that a group of men who go about in black leather would be better at deliberately looking imposing.\nBut that\u2019s why they have Jaskier, right? And Yen, of course, who can do imposing like nobody\u2019s business. Bards and sorceresses: good at setting the stage.\nThe noblewomen step warily into the great hall at midafternoon, three weeks after the note first arrived, and it\u2019s nearly empty - to human eyes, at least. There are Witchers lurking in the shadows, a few from every School, watching silently, but they won\u2019t interfere unless something goes really impressively wrong.\nGeralt is sitting in the throne he almost never uses, the huge silver wolf\u2019s-head medallion shining like a crown behind his head, wearing his spikiest armor and - of course - the two swords that mark a Witcher. Dark stone, dark armor, silver hair and pale skin - the only spots of color are the White Wolf\u2019s golden eyes, and those, as Jaskier well knows, are very hard to meet unless you know him.\nAlso, he\u2019s glowering even more than usual, and though Jaskier thinks he looks so astonishingly attractive that it\u2019s hard to keep from falling at his feet, he\u2019s perfectly aware that newcomers to Kaer Morhen are going to assume that\u2019s the expression that only briefly precedes evisceration.\nThe rest of the council is arrayed on either side of the throne: Eskel, also in the spikiest armor he could find, at Geralt\u2019s right, arms crossed over his chest and scarred face creased in a scowl. Jaskier knows he\u2019s a complete sweetheart, but he has to admit that on first glance, Eskel is almost as intimidating as the White Wolf. Yennefer, to the left of the throne, is wearing her most dramatic black outfit, and she looks coldly beautiful and utterly untouchable, like some sort of goddess of pain. Vesemir, to her left, refused to wear spikes but does look as grim as a winter storm.\nThere was some debate as to what Jaskier should wear. A bard in black just looks wrong, somehow, and anyhow Jaskier isn\u2019t quite willing to get an entire outfit made for one evening. But he does have a gold outfit, very nearly the color of Geralt\u2019s eyes. So he\u2019s all in gold, lute across his back, grinning a little more nastily than he really wants to admit, at Eskel\u2019s right hand.\nHe thinks they make a fairly intimidating display, the five of them: the White Wolf and his Pack.\nTo their credit, none of the ten noblewomen who file into the hall in what Jaskier is willing to lay money is order of precedence actually break and run, but if Jaskier were a Witcher, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d be smelling fear as thick as porridge. The women\u2019s entourages cluster at the end of the hall, looking just as worried: one lady-in-waiting and two guards each, all that Eskel would allow past the border. The guards are all looking very twitchy, as though certain that there\u2019s about to be a bloodbath they won\u2019t be able to do anything about; the ladies-in-waiting are all white-faced and trembling.\nOh, actually, that\u2019s interesting: there is one lady-in-waiting who stands straight-backed and calm, watching the whole tableau with clear interest and no apparent fear. Jaskier squints against the dim lighting - he and Yen ordered that only half the lanterns be lit, so that the Witchers could see clearly but their human guests could not, but unfortunately Jaskier is only human, too - and realizes with a little shock that he recognizes her. Milena de Roggeven, the pretty young duke\u2019s daughter he met in Redania. If she\u2019s here as a lady-in-waiting, then Jaskier guesses that one of the would-be consorts must be another daughter of the Duke de Roggeven, presumably an older one. Well, that\u2019ll be interesting. If the elder de Roggeven daughter is anything like her younger sister, she might actually be able to cope with Witchers.\nGiven that every one of the consort-hopefuls looks like she\u2019s worried Geralt is going to eat her for dinner, he\u2019s not going to bet much money on that, though.\nGeralt waits until they\u2019re all lined up in front of the dais, ten young women in a slightly shaky line, before he deigns to do so much as nod. Given how terrified they all look, it\u2019s probably just as well that the council agreed to let Eskel do the talking; Geralt growling at them might actually cause some of them to faint. Jaskier may not think much of their chances of winning Geralt\u2019s heart and hand, and may want them gone back to their homes as quickly as possible, but he doesn\u2019t wish them any ill - well, at least, not until and unless they actually turn out to deserve it.\n\u201cYou may present yourselves to the Wolf, and state your business in Kaer Morhen,\u201d Eskel says coolly.\nOne by one, the ladies state their names and titles. The highest-ranking is actually a Temerian princess, to Jaskier\u2019s surprise; the marchioness de Roggeven is next in rank, and then another duke\u2019s daughter, and the rest are from all the ranks of the nobility, down to the very scared-looking young Cintran woman whose father is a mere baron, and who looks like she would rather be anywhere but here. When they have all introduced themselves, Princess Agata curtsies and says, voice admirably even, \u201cWe have come to Kaer Morhen in the hopes that the Warlord of the North may, in his wisdom, be willing to consider us as candidates to become his consort.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Eskel, and Jaskier does not smile at how like the White Wolf Eskel sounds. \u201cVery well. We will provide you with the list of requirements that any candidate for that position must fulfill. You may have a month\u2019s grace to consider them. If you cannot fulfill them, we will provide you with escort to the border of the White Wolf\u2019s lands.\u201d\nA month isn\u2019t very long, but Geralt\u2019s patience is not infinite. And a month is about how long it took Jaskier to forget to be afraid of Witchers in general and the White Wolf in particular, so it\u2019s as fair as any of them care to be to these hopeful young husband-hunters.\nVesemir gestures, and Witchers step from the shadows, fading into view like nightmares; the noblewomen and their entourages flinch in shock. \u201cThey will show you to your rooms,\u201d the old Witcher says, and, shakily, the noblewomen nod and curtsey again and beckon their attendants and follow the waiting Witchers out of the hall towards the wing that has been set aside for them.\nMilena de Roggeven looks up as she passes the dais and catches Jaskier\u2019s eye and smiles.\nInteresting.\n*\nSupper that night is a little tense. There\u2019s been a special table brought in for the noblewomen and their ladies-in-waiting, though their guards have been given seats at the various Witchers\u2019 tables - and very unhappy they look about it, too. All of the noblewomen spend significant portions of dinner staring at Ciri, who stares back in clear fascination. As soon as she finishes eating, she slides out of her chair and hurries around her father and Eskel to stand beside Jaskier\u2019s chair, tugging at the sleeve of his doublet.\n\u201cThey dress fancier than Aunt Yen,\u201d she murmurs when Jaskier bends his head.\nJaskier laughs. \u201cYes, they do,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut don\u2019t let your Aunt Yen hear you say that - she might take it as a challenge.\u201d\nCiri giggles briefly, then frowns. \u201cThey look really scared,\u201d she says.\nCome to think of it, Jaskier realizes, Ciri doesn\u2019t...actually talk to people outside of Kaer Morhen. That should maybe be fixed. He\u2019ll have to talk to Geralt about bringing her down-mountain and letting her talk to the villagers, or the elves in their sheltered towns, or even all the way to one of the cities to see what life is like there. \u201cA lot of people are very scared of your Papa,\u201d he explains gently. \u201cI was, when I first got here.\u201d\nCiri\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cBut why?\u201d she asks.\nJaskier shakes his head in wonder. Growing up among Witchers and sorceresses has made Ciri essentially fearless, he knows that - it occasionally causes problems, though thankfully there\u2019s always a Witcher or two close enough that such problems are easily solved - but he hadn\u2019t quite realized that she doesn\u2019t know how the rest of the continent, the lands outside the Wolf\u2019s empire, view the Warlord of the North. \u201cWell, people say a lot of stupid things,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI had heard - a lot of rumors that it turns out were completely false. I thought he was going to be very mean to me.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cAnd they think he\u2019s going to be mean, too.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jaskier agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s...probably going to be rude, because he\u2019s Geralt, and also they\u2019re all here because they want to be the Consort of the Warlord of the North, and I don\u2019t think he likes being courted.\u201d\nCiri wrinkles her nose. \u201cEven though they think Papa is mean, they want to marry him?\u201d\n\u201cPeople do very stupid things for power, little menace,\u201d Jaskier says.\n\u201cAin\u2019t that the truth,\u201d Lambert grumbles, and Jaskier is reminded - again - that trying to have private conversations around Witchers is about as productive as lighting candles in a blizzard.\n\u201cJust remember, none of them gets to marry your Papa without your say-so,\u201d Jaskier reminds Ciri gently. \u201cEven if they manage to check off every other item on that list your Uncle Eskel put together, you get to say yea or nay.\u201d\nCiri grins at him. \u201cWhat if I tell him to marry you?\u201d\nLambert goes off into snorting gales of laughter, and Eskel, who has been politely pretending to ignore the conversation, inhales a mouthful of ale and has a truly undignified coughing fit. Jaskier glances past Eskel to see that Geralt is watching him with, as usual, a nearly unreadable expression - but there\u2019s amusement in the crinkles around his eyes, and the fond quirk of lips that Ciri always brings out. Not offended by the question, then - not offended by the idea.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something you get to take up with your Papa,\u201d Jaskier says carefully.\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Ciri, clearly imitating Geralt despite the fact that she can\u2019t quite hit the same low note, and gives Jaskier a speculative look. \u201cAre you going to sing for us tonight?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAny requests, little menace?\u201d\nCiri thinks about it for a long moment, wrinkling her nose adorably. \u201cNo love songs,\u201d she decides at last. \u201cSomething funny.\u201d\n\u201cSomething funny it is,\u201d Jaskier says, and stands, fetching his lute from where he hung it on the back of his chair and slinging it over his chest. The hall hushes, which is flattering as all hell every time it happens: having an entire hall of Witchers fall silent for his performances is fucking addictive, one of the best parts of living in Kaer Morhen.\n\u201cThis is an old one,\u201d he says into the waiting silence, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always been fond of it. You know the drill: after every line, clap your hands twice, like this!\u201d He claps, sharp and brisk. \u201cThis is The Skelliger.\u201d\nSeveral Witchers hoot with anticipatory glee, and Jaskier strikes the first chord and starts to sing, beaming as the music rises to fill the hall.\n*\nJaskier left Yen in charge of organizing entertainment for the noblewomen during their stay, mostly because she seemed so delighted at the prospect. He should maybe have kept a closer eye on her, though, if only to make sure none of her plans end with any noblewomen dead, because the first thing she announces, at breakfast the morning after the women arrive, is that they are invited on a hunt with the White Wolf and his men.\nThis is initially received with great good humor, up until the noblewomen realize that while in almost any other court, a hunt means riding out looking delicate with a hawk on one\u2019s wrist and flying the bird at prey which has been flushed from the bushes ahead of you - or possibly released by servants with caged doves or rabbits - in Kaer Morhen it means going hiking through the mountains, horseless and servantless, looking for deer or boar or, occasionally and mostly accidentally, wyverns.\nJaskier made that mistake once. He has not made it since. He\u2019s mostly lived down the fact that Aubry had to carry him home, but he doesn\u2019t care to be reminded of it. He is not going hunting, thank you very much.\nBlessedly, Ciri\u2019s morning lessons make for a very good excuse for him to refuse.\nOnly one of the noblewomen is smart enough - or possibly scared enough - to back out, and Jaskier, coming down for dinner, sees the young Cintran lady and her attendants carrying their bags out of the keep towards the stables. He follows them, of course.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d the girl says when she spots him leaning on the stable doorframe. \u201cFather said I had to come, but he wouldn\u2019t be the one living in this - this horrid place!\u201d\n\u201cIf you think it horrid, then it is not the place for you, my lady,\u201d Jaskier agrees. \u201cI do not find it so.\u201d\nShe gives him a long, curious look. \u201cYou\u2019re quite mad,\u201d she says at last. \u201cBut I wish you joy of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I hope you find your joy, my lady,\u201d Jaskier says, perfectly willing to be amiable now that she\u2019s leaving.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and one of her guards helps her up onto her horse, and she leads her attendants out of Kaer Morhen without a single backwards glance.\nWell, that\u2019s one down.\n*\nJaskier is not surprised when every single one of the noblewomen and their ladies-in-waiting are being carried by Witchers when they return from the hunt, an hour or two before supper. He\u2019s also not surprised that most of them look almost paralyzed with fear from the experience, on top of the exhaustion that has resulted in their unusual method of travel.\nMilena, interestingly, is still looking fairly calm. She\u2019s sitting in Lambert\u2019s arms, and appears to be chatting amiably with the prickly Witcher, who looks somewhere between intrigued and baffled by the experience. Her older sister, in Axel\u2019s arms, is not looking anywhere near as happy.\nYen is looking smug, because of course she is. Jaskier catches her eye as the line of burdened Witchers files into the hall, and she strides over to him with a smirk. \u201cApparently,\u201d she says, \u201cnoble ladies of Redania and Temeria do not enjoy traipsing up and down mountains in their good shoes. I am shocked.\u201d\n\u201cYen, darling, I don\u2019t enjoy traipsing up and down mountains in my good shoes,\u201d Jaskier points out. \u201cAny casualties?\u201d\n\u201cOne twisted ankle - she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Yen says dismissively. \u201cAnd a couple of deer, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Jaskier says, as Geralt comes in with an entire elk carcass on his shoulders. There\u2019s something deeply primal about the sight of Geralt with blood in his hair and a tiny, feral grin on his face, carrying food back to his people. Jaskier wants to kiss him, and then drag him down to the hot springs and scrub his hair clean, and then kiss him some more.\nWhich he is, in fact, allowed to do these days.\nGeralt hands the elk off to a trio of servants, and Jaskier crosses the hall to take his lover\u2019s face in his hands and kiss him sweetly. Geralt tastes of sweat and a little blood - not the most appetizing flavor in the world - but he kisses back with a quiet, happy hum, so Jaskier doesn\u2019t really mind.\n\u201cStaking your claim, little lark?\u201d he murmurs as their lips part.\n\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d Jaskier replies, and Geralt\u2019s eyes crinkle in a near-invisible smile.\nYen claps her hands, gaining the attention of everyone in the room as the Witchers finish putting down their reluctant burdens. \u201cKaer Morhen is lucky enough to have hot springs to bathe in,\u201d she informs the noblewomen. \u201cDo please join us there before supper!\u201d\n\u201cOh, vicious,\u201d Jaskier murmurs, hiding a grin behind his hand as the noblewomen begin to mutter among themselves. \u201cVicious, vicious Yen.\u201d\n\u201cThat she is,\u201d Geralt says, almost ruefully.\n\u201cDunno why everyone thinks it\u2019s Witchers who are cruel,\u201d Eskel adds, coming up beside Jaskier and clapping Geralt on the shoulder. \u201cNice work on that elk, Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cOh, tell me he brought it down single-handedly,\u201d Jaskier sighs, rubbing his forehead.\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cWith a knife. Not his teeth.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for specifying,\u201d Jaskier says.\nGeralt sighs.\n*\nThe noblewomen look at the hot springs, which are full of cheerful naked Witchers. Jaskier watches their expressions go from shock to dismay to full-blown horror.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to use the pools below this one,\u201d Yen says, smiling like she doesn\u2019t see how unhappy the noblewomen are. \u201cThe ones the Witchers are in are far too hot for humans.\u201d\n\u201cAre there no private pools?\u201d Princess Agata demands. \u201cSurely the Warlord does not use the common baths -\u201d\nGeralt picks this moment to stride naked as the day he was born past the little clutch of horrified noblewomen and directly into the water, Eskel hard on his heels. Jaskier shakes his head at the chorus of squeaks and gasps that rise from the noblewomen, and follows his wolves into the water. Geralt ducks under briefly, and then stands in the deepest bit of the pool so Jaskier can kneel on the carved rock seat and work the blood out of Geralt\u2019s hair.\nHe\u2019s only paying half his attention to his hands, because the other half is focused firmly on the scandalized noblewomen, who hiss desperate comments at each other until Princess Agata finally decrees that the ladies-in-waiting will hold up bathing sheets around one of the pools to allow their betters to bathe in private. Jaskier feels a bit sorry for the women - some of whom, like Milena, are actually of the same rank as the consort-hopefuls - as they stand around one of the smaller pools with their arms outstretched and toweling draped over them, shielding the pool from prying eyes.\nYen gets into the pool with Geralt and Eskel and Jaskier, nude and unashamed, and grins. \u201cPoor darlings,\u201d she drawls, tilting her head at the ladies-in-waiting and the hidden noblewomen. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kaer Morhen is agreeing with them.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a startlingly vicious woman and I never wish to become your enemy,\u201d Jaskier informs her.\n\u201cYou are just as vicious, little flower,\u201d Yen says, beaming at him. \u201cYou just hide it better.\u201d\nJaskier hums and finishes getting the last of the blood out of Geralt\u2019s hair. \u201cMaybe true,\u201d he allows at last. Geralt chuckles, settles on the seat beside Jaskier, and tugs Jaskier into his lap, tucking his face into the curve of Jaskier\u2019s throat with a contented hum and wrapping his arms around Jaskier\u2019s waist. Jaskier wriggles until he\u2019s properly comfortable and leans back against Geralt\u2019s broad chest, humming his own pleasure in turn.\nLambert splashes into the water beside them, making Geralt rumble irritably, and flops down so only his head is out of the water. \u201cFucking nobles,\u201d he gripes. \u201cButtercup, you lucky fucker, you didn\u2019t have to hear \u2018em whining the whole way up the mountain and down again.\u201d\nJaskier laughs at him. \u201cYou volunteered to go along,\u201d he points out.\n\u201cYeah, well, catch me being that stupid again,\u201d Lambert grumbles. \u201cThough I guess Milena\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Eskel asks, exchanging a thoughtful look with Jaskier.\n\u201cShe\u2019s funny,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cAnd not as afraid of us as all the other noble idiots are.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a friend,\u201d Jaskier says, carefully keeping any trace of humor out of his voice. Lambert grimaces but doesn\u2019t object.\n\u201cHow many do you think we\u2019ll lose tomorrow?\u201d Eskel asks Yen. Yen hums.\n\u201cThree or four,\u201d she says at last. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been able to overhear, about half of them came on their fathers\u2019 orders, and they\u2019ll break easily. The other half...they\u2019re here because they genuinely want to be Consort to the Warlord of the North, and if that means putting up with Geralt and Kaer Morhen, they\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cGeralt\u2019s not something to put up with, he\u2019s someone to fucking cherish,\u201d Jaskier grumbles, and Geralt makes a soft happy sound and kisses the back of his shoulder. Jaskier turns his head so he can press his lips to Geralt\u2019s temple.\n\u201cUgh, buttercup, be sappy somewhere else,\u201d Lambert grumbles, splashing water vaguely in Jaskier\u2019s direction - it doesn\u2019t even hit him.\n\u201cI shall be sappy all over this damned keep if I like,\u201d Jaskier says, raising his chin and looking as haughty as he can. \u201cBard\u2019s privilege. We get to be as dramatic as we please.\u201d\nYen chuckles. Eskel shakes his head and smiles.\n*\nSupper that night is mostly uneventful: good food, good company, a table full of cranky noblewomen studiously ignoring everything around them except for the occasional attempts several of them make to catch Geralt\u2019s eye and look alluring. Geralt doesn\u2019t appear to notice. Jaskier notices, but it\u2019s more amusing than annoying, at least so far. Jaskier sings when the meal is over, picking a couple of cheerful ballads with good catchy choruses and not bothering to ask the ladies what their preferences are. He\u2019s already caught several of them giving him foul looks, clearly not amused by his obvious place in Geralt\u2019s affections. They may well have thought that their only competition was each other, on their way to Kaer Morhen, but now they know he\u2019s in the running too, and so far ahead of the rest of them it\u2019s not even truly a race.\nIf, of course, Geralt wants a consort. He still hasn\u2019t said anything one way or another, either to Jaskier or to anyone else on the council. He did approve the list of requirements they drew up without any emendations, which was moderately flattering, but besides that and his clear unhappiness about being hunted like a particularly appealing stag, he hasn\u2019t really voiced an opinion on the whole matter.\nJaskier doesn\u2019t mind not being consort - as long as nobody else is, either.\nHe and Geralt put Ciri to bed after supper, and then Geralt wraps an arm around his waist and tugs him down the stairs to Geralt\u2019s rooms - it doesn\u2019t take much tugging - and takes his own sweet time undressing Jaskier, kissing every exposed patch of skin as he goes. Jaskier pets Geralt\u2019s hair and murmurs whatever sweet babble comes to his lips - he doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s going to say next, most of the time, just that it\u2019ll be sappy and adoring and probably filthy.\nThere\u2019s something about having Geralt knelt before him, moon-white hair tangled between Jaskier\u2019s fingers and golden eyes half-closed in contentment as he nuzzles at the line of Jaskier\u2019s hip, inhaling the scents of love and lust and happiness, that\u2019s downright inspiring.\n\nOh wolf, said the maiden, your eyes they do gleam / your teeth are so sharp and your claws are so keen / have you come to devour me, am I your prey / or will you claim me and bear me away?\n\nNot that Jaskier is a maiden, but being a bard involves a lot of artistic license.\nGeralt laughs softly against Jaskier\u2019s skin and stands. \u201cAlways composing,\u201d he says fondly, and kisses Jaskier, slow and thorough, until all the words have vanished under a wave of inarticulate want.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very inspiring,\u201d Jaskier manages to squeak out as Geralt scoops him up and carries him over to the bed. \u201cNot my fault if my lover is the most magnificent man on the contin-\u201d He is interrupted by another kiss.\n\u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt murmurs, voice deep and rich and loving, and it warms Jaskier all the way down to his toes. \u201cNever stop singing.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s heart turns over. \u201cDarling wolf, how could I?\u201d he asks, and pulls Geralt down into another kiss, and another, until they\u2019re moving against each other in a steady rhythm like the beat of a drum, both too distracted by the press of lips and teeth and tongues to do anything fancier than rub off against each other, Jaskier\u2019s hands tight on Geralt\u2019s shoulders and Geralt\u2019s arms wrapped around him to hold him close, as though Jaskier would ever want to be anywhere but here.\nIn the morning, four more noblewomen take their leave, all looking very footsore and very irritable. Jaskier watches them go from the gateway, and firmly resists the urge to wave after them, before heading up for Ciri\u2019s morning lessons. He\u2019s taking advantage of the current invasion of noblewomen to go over court etiquette with the young princess; she puts up with it with better grace than usual. Mostly, Jaskier learns when the formal lesson is over, because she has an ulterior motive.\n\u201cI want to meet the ladies,\u201d she says. \u201cAunt Yen said I had to be polite at first.\u201d\n\u201cAt first?\u201d Jaskier says, starting to grin. Oh, Yen, vicious as always.\n\u201cShe said I have to be polite until they stop being polite to me,\u201d Ciri says, grinning. \u201cAnd then I can be as rude as I like as long as I don\u2019t use any of Uncle Lambert\u2019s words.\u201d\nJaskier snorts with laughter. \u201cShe\u2019s quite correct, Uncle Lambert\u2019s words are not appropriate in polite company. Or impolite company. Or, indeed, any company at all.\u201d\nCiri giggles. \u201cSo Aunt Yen\u2019s going to introduce me after dinner. Do you want to come?\u201d\n\u201cI would be honored, if your Aunt Yen doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Jaskier assures her. \u201cShall we go down to dinner and ask her?\u201d\nCiri leads the way down to the hall, skipping down the narrow steps with what has always seemed to Jaskier like impossible agility. He takes them carefully, even now: they are a little slick underfoot, and unlike Ciri, he hasn\u2019t been trained in acrobatics since he could walk.\nYen eyes Jaskier thoughtfully when Ciri asks if he can join them for the afternoon, and finally nods. \u201cTriss and I have invited the ladies to join us in the stillroom,\u201d she says.\nJaskier raises an eyebrow. \u201cHow many of them think you\u2019ll be making rosewater salve?\u201d he asks. Noble ladies do spend a fair amount of time in stillrooms, but the salves and balms and soaps they make are very little like the potions Triss spends her time concocting.\nYen\u2019s smile grows sharper. \u201cMost of them. Oh, I think they\u2019re clever enough to realize it\u2019s a trap - they just don\u2019t know what kind, yet.\u201d\nJaskier shakes his head at her and grins. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than the little menace.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do you think she learned it?\u201d Yen asks, draping an arm around Ciri\u2019s shoulders and pressing a kiss to the girl\u2019s messy hair. Ciri giggles.\n\u201cI learned it from Uncle Lambert,\u201d she says, and Yen claps a hand to her mouth in mock offense.\n\u201cBetrayed! By my own apprentice!\u201d she cries, and puts her hand to her forehead, slumping back against her chair in a beautiful false faint. \u201cAlas!\u201d\nCiri laughs harder. \u201cAunt Yen, you\u2019re so silly!\u201d she says, and clambers into Yen\u2019s lap to hug her. Yen wraps her own arms around the girl and kisses her forehead, laughing softly.\n\u201cDarling vicious little menace,\u201d she says.\nJaskier shakes his head at both of them and retreats to his own chair.\n\nThe sorceress with violet eyes / has never known a day of love / her heart is stone, or so it seems / until you see her with her cub\u2026\n\n*\nPrincess Agata of Temeria. Marchioness Marta de Roggeven. Countess Paulina de Brokilon. Countess Karolina de Rimmar. Viscountess Anastazja de Brenna. Five would-be consorts left, all of them clearly here not at their fathers\u2019 bidding but because they, themselves, are eager for the power and prestige of being the Warlord\u2019s chosen consort. Jaskier looks them over as they come mincing into the stillroom, notes the sharp unhappy glances he and Yen are getting, and decides that he doesn\u2019t like them.\n\u201cLadies,\u201d Yen says, smiling without any friendliness at all. \u201cMay I present to you my colleague, Triss Merigold, whose domain this stillroom is; and the princess Cirilla, daughter and heir of the Warlord of the North.\u201d\nCiri gives quite a creditable curtsey. Jaskier is very proud. She gets five much deeper ones back, because she technically outranks even Princess Agata, by virtue of being Geralt\u2019s heir. Princess Agata doesn\u2019t look happy about this, of course.\nTriss says, \u201cWelcome to my stillroom! As you are all here in the hopes of becoming the Warlord\u2019s consort, I thought perhaps you would be interested in learning about the potions which enable the Witchers to perform such remarkable feats as they do!\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d says Princess Agata, about to object, and Triss beams at her and barrels on, rolling over any and all objections like a runaway cart, showing each noblewoman to a separate set of brewing equipment and giving crisp instructions as to what to do with the truly disgusting ingredients laid out waiting.\nJaskier has spent a large number of afternoons helping Triss with her potions, and has almost gotten used to handling ghoul blood and sewant mushrooms and archespore juice and so on, though he certainly doesn\u2019t enjoy it. Ciri seems not to mind the smell, nor the odd unpleasant viscosity, nor the fact that without proper precautions, several of the ingredients will eat through wood and skin and leave terrible burn scars; but then, Ciri\u2019s been learning alchemy since she was six.\nThe noblewomen, used to rosewater and lavender extract, beeswax and distilled oils, look at the potions ingredients with unconcealed horror. \u201cThis is hardly appropriate labor for a princess,\u201d Princess Agata begins, and then stops, mouth open in dismay, as Ciri hops up on a stool beside Triss and begins chopping a bundle of some sort of herb or other without any hesitation.\n\u201cVery well,\u201d says Marta de Roggeven, nose wrinkled in disgust, and steps forward to imitate Ciri. Jaskier decides that he\u2019s reluctantly impressed, and also that if he sticks around much longer he\u2019ll probably have to start dealing with wyvern liver or something equally appealing, and slips quietly out the door, winking at Yen as he goes.\nShe\u2019s got it all under control.\n*\nJaskier could go and try to get some composing done, but instead, he heads for the wing where the noblewomen have been given rooms, and is lucky enough to run across exactly who he was looking for in the hallway, without having to start knocking on doors and disturbing people.\nMilena smiles at him and curtsies a little. \u201cBard Jaskier! Are you looking for Marta?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I was looking for you,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cWould you like to take a little walk, and see more of Kaer Morhen with me?\u201d\n\u201cI would be delighted,\u201d Milena says, and falls in beside him. He\u2019s not going to show her anything particularly secret, of course, but there\u2019s a lovely view from the walltops, all craggy mountains and endless vistas and the training grounds full of Witchers doing impossible feats of acrobatics and strength.\n\u201cAnd how do you find Kaer Morhen thus far?\u201d Jaskier asks.\nMilena grimaces. \u201cCold,\u201d she says, a little plaintively. \u201cI had no idea it would be this cold in the summer. We all packed our lightest gowns.\u201d\nJaskier winces. \u201cOh dear! I can lend you a coat, if you like.\u201d\nMilena nods, looking sheepish and hopeful, and Jaskier leads her first up to his suite, thankful that he has left at least a little of his wardrobe here instead of moving it all to Geralt\u2019s rooms. There\u2019s a coat that\u2019s a little too small for his shoulders but fits Milena quite handily, and she looks much happier as she burrows down into it.\n\u201cLead on,\u201d she says, smiling at him, and Jaskier offers her his arm in proper courtly fashion, grinning when she laughs.\nIt is, thankfully, not too windy, so the walltops aren\u2019t so bitingly cold as to be utterly uninhabitable by normal humans. Jaskier leads Milena along until they\u2019re overlooking the training grounds and lounges against a merlon as she stares in wonder at the mountains, the deep gorge of the river, and the hundreds of men - and a very few women - sparring below.\n\u201cYe gods,\u201d she whispers after a moment. \u201cThat man just - how?\u201d\nJaskier peers over to see what she\u2019s staring at, and grins at the sight of a pair of Cat Witchers wrestling. The Cats are the most acrobatic, he\u2019s found; these two appear to be competing for how high they can get up the walls before leaping down onto each other like mountain lions pouncing on their prey. Admittedly, the first time he saw a Witcher go bounding ten feet up a sheer wall without any apparent effort, he nearly fell over from the shock.\n\u201cYep, they do that,\u201d he says, and Milena laughs incredulously. \u201cOh, hey,\u201d he adds, pointing. \u201cLook, there\u2019s Lambert.\u201d\nTo his utter delight, Milena\u2019s cheeks go pink as she turns to follow his finger. Lambert is facing off against Co\u00ebn, both of them holding daggers instead of swords, and as Jaskier and Milena watch, Lambert lunges forward into a rolling somersault that brings him up behind Co\u00ebn, who whirls to meet him in a clash of steel. Milena squeaks and plasters both hands across her mouth, staring in horror that turns slowly into a sort of awed wonder as the mock-battle goes on. Lambert and Co\u00ebn are reasonably well matched, from what Jaskier has been able to gather; certainly they keep going for a while, as the Witchers around them applaud or wince at particularly clever moves. Milena squeaks again the first time one of them draws blood, and Jaskier pats her on the shoulder.\n\u201cWitchers heal fast,\u201d he assures her. \u201cHe\u2019ll be good as new by the time supper rolls around, from a little cut like that, at least.\u201d\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Milena says, relaxing a little, and gives Jaskier a sort of sidelong hopeful glance. \u201cLambert\u2019s a - a very strange man,\u201d she offers.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole,\u201d Jaskier corrects her. \u201cBut I\u2019m very fond of him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he of you,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was very angry at your father.\u201d\nJaskier winces. \u201cYes, well, water under the bridge now,\u201d he says. \u201cBut yes! I like to think we\u2019re quite good friends by now. He\u2019s a good man, under all the prickles, but gods above, he\u2019s such an ass sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cHe does swear a lot,\u201d Milena says. \u201cI think I learned about a dozen new words while he was carrying me back from that dreadful hunting trip yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a dozen? He must have been watching his tongue,\u201d Jaskier says, and Milena giggles incredulously. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly learned several, and I thought Oxenfurt had taught me every filthy word known to man, and most of the elven ones, too.\u201d\nMilena laughs so hard she has to lean on the wall for a bit before she catches her breath. \u201cYou like it here,\u201d she says once she\u2019s gotten her composure back. \u201cYou like the Witchers, and this incredibly imposing castle. You\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jaskier says. It\u2019s true. He\u2019s happier here even than he was in Oxenfurt, because no one here expects him to be anything other than exactly what he is - and he is loved for it.\nMilena sighs. \u201cEven if Marta can swear to everything on that list of requirements, she\u2019d never be happy here. She likes court life, and this is nothing like Redania\u2019s court.\u201d\n\u201cShould you really be telling me that?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cYou must know I don\u2019t want any of the ladies to win Geralt\u2019s hand.\u201d\nMilena snorts. \u201cMarta thinks she\u2019s got a chance, but I\u2019ve got eyes. The White Wolf dotes on you. So do all the other Witchers, and that absolutely terrifying sorceress.\u201d\n\u201cI am going to tell Yen you called her terrifying, and she will immediately adore you,\u201d Jaskier informs her.\n\u201cThank you, I think.\u201d Milena grins. \u201cBut anyhow, there\u2019s no way in the world the White Wolf is going to put you aside, so\u2026\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think Marta\u2019s going to give up until she has to, but she\u2019s not going to win him, and neither is that dreadful princess or anyone else. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m ruining her chances by talking to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019d see it that way, but I shan\u2019t tell her,\u201d Jaskier says. Down below, Lambert manages to knock one of Co\u00ebn\u2019s knives flying, and Milena leans out between the merlons, eyes wide. Jaskier grins and stays silent as the bout comes to an end in a sudden flurry of kicks and punches and another flash of steel, and Lambert ends up sitting on his friend\u2019s chest, knife to Co\u00ebn\u2019s throat. There\u2019s a brief, breathless pause, and then Co\u00ebn says something - inaudible at this distance - and Lambert bellows with laughter and rolls to his feet and offers Co\u00ebn a hand up, and they clap each other on the back as the other Witchers cheer.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very skilled,\u201d Milena observes. \u201cHe was doing knife tricks at the court, too.\u201d\n\u201cHe is that,\u201d Jaskier agrees. He doesn\u2019t want to say too much, lest she or Lambert or both of them realize how dreadfully adorable they\u2019re being, but really, he is absolutely charmed by the fact that they appear to have managed to develop feelings for each other in the course of a single night and a rather disastrous day of hunting. \u201cHe dances well, too. Should I play some dancing tunes tonight?\u201d\nMilena blushes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare ask him to dance.\u201d\n\u201cWitchers don\u2019t stand on ceremony,\u201d Jaskier says, which is an understatement of possibly epic proportions. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t mind. And you could tell your sister you\u2019re trying to ingratiate yourself with the Warlord\u2019s court, so as to help her chances.\u201d Which might, indeed, be exactly what she\u2019s doing right now, but Jaskier considers himself a fairly good judge of character, and he\u2019s fairly sure she\u2019s just what she seems: a young woman who has had a rude awakening to the truth of court politics, and also has started to develop an infatuation - or perhaps more - with the least likely Witcher in Kaer Morhen.\nMilena blushes harder, but she also nods. \u201cIf - if you do play a dancing tune, then I - I\u2019ll ask him. At least if he\u2019s not interested he\u2019ll probably just say so.\u201d\n\u201cWitchers don\u2019t lie well,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cBut don\u2019t fret. If nothing else, I don\u2019t think Lambert will ever turn down a chance to dance with a pretty lady.\u201d\n*\nThe noblewomen look even less happy with their lives when they sit down for supper. They\u2019ve clearly bathed, but they all look like they can still smell the foul ingredients they\u2019ve been working with all afternoon, and they give Triss and Yen truly unfriendly glares. Yen ignores them, looking like the cat who got the canary, the cream, and the fish set aside for dinner, too; Triss grins at them unrepentantly. Geralt takes a long look at the whole tableau as he takes his place at the table and clearly decides he doesn\u2019t want to know or get involved. Sensible man.\nThis isn\u2019t a war Witchers are equipped to fight, but between Yen, Triss, Ciri, and Jaskier himself, Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure their victory is going to be both inevitable and crushingly thorough.\n\u201cWhat did Yen do to the ladies?\u201d Eskel murmurs under the general buzz of conversation once the meal starts.\n\u201cPotions,\u201d Jaskier replies, and Eskel winces.\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll lose any more tonight, then?\u201d\nJaskier hums, surveying the remaining five consort-hopefuls thoughtfully. \u201cNot the princess, nor the marchioness,\u201d he decides at last. \u201cMaybe one of the countesses. They\u2019re high enough rank to have good prospects back home, but not high enough that they\u2019re likely to really believe they\u2019ve a chance at Geralt.\u201d\n\u201cNot the viscountess?\u201d Lambert asks.\n\u201cIf she hasn\u2019t left by now, she must be so ambitious she\u2019s willing to stick it out all the way to the end,\u201d Jaskier says, shaking his head.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Lambert says, and subsides into unwonted silence. Jaskier follows his gaze and hides a grin. Over at the noblewomen\u2019s table, Milena de Roggeven is shooting surreptitious looks up towards the Wolf Witchers, and Lambert is watching her like - well, like a wolf eyeing a rustle in the bushes, not sure if it\u2019s predator or prey or nothing but the wind.\nJaskier catches Eskel\u2019s eye and tilts his head, just a little, and Eskel nods very slightly and hides a smile behind his mug of ale. He sees it, too.\nAs soon as the meal is over, Jaskier stands, and into the flattering silence announces that it\u2019s a lovely night for some dancing. The Witchers cheer and start moving tables to make a dancing floor, grabbing preferred partners from among their friends and lovers. Several of the Witchers Jaskier knows have rather pointed senses of humor move towards the noblewomen, who look, for the most part, appalled. Princess Agata glances up towards Geralt, clearly hoping he will partner her, and is instantly furious when Ciri takes her father\u2019s hand and pulls him out to the dance floor.\nAnd Milena squares her shoulders, rises, and comes up to the Wolf table, facing Lambert across the oaken board. \u201cWould - would you do me the honor of this dance?\u201d she asks, voice a little shaky but quite clear.\nLambert makes a noise like a mouse being stepped on, and goes quite red. Jaskier kicks him gently under the table. Lambert swallows hard and says, \u201cYes!\u201d rather louder than he clearly meant to, and then stands and vaults the table, landing beside Milena with a gentle thump. Milena looks rather startled by this, but she offers her hand, and Lambert takes it.\nJaskier strikes up a dancing tune, grinning fit to burst.\n*\nThe next day, Eskel offers to give the ladies a tour of Kaer Morhen, which involves a great deal of climbing up and down narrow twisty stairs at a pace a Witcher finds comfortable, and all of them choose to spend the afternoon in their rooms rather than see what other delights the keep might have to offer.\nNone of them leave, though. Jaskier\u2019s not sure how many more \u201cfriendly\u201d ways of dissuading the consort-hopefuls Yen may have come up with, but he\u2019s starting to run dry. It doesn\u2019t help that he likes Kaer Morhen, and finds the Witchers good company; it\u2019s hard to remember, these days, how terrifying everything was back when he first arrived.\nHe gets to supper a bit early, and finds Geralt already there; the White Wolf smiles almost imperceptibly and beckons Jaskier over with a tilt of his head, and Jaskier perches on the arm of his chair and grins down at him. Geralt wraps an arm around Jaskier\u2019s waist and leans his head against Jaskier\u2019s shoulder contentedly.\n\u201cI see you haven\u2019t run off up the mountains again, my wolf,\u201d Jaskier teases gently, and Geralt rumbles softly in amusement.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he agrees. \u201cSoon, maybe.\u201d\nJaskier snickers. \u201cBig strong wolf running from a bunch of husband-hunters,\u201d he murmurs, running a hand through Geralt\u2019s hair and grinning wider when Geralt hums and leans into the caress. \u201cI won\u2019t let them catch you.\u201d\n\u201cMy hero,\u201d Geralt says, very dryly, and Jaskier chuckles and shakes his head.\n\u201cI\u2019m honestly happy just being your lark,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt says, low and sweet. \u201cAlways.\u201d\nJaskier shivers with pleasure, and Geralt\u2019s lips tilt up at his reaction.\nThe hall starts to fill, and Jaskier leans down to brush a kiss against Geralt\u2019s lips and slides off the arm of his chair to go find his own seat. Geralt rises to watch his people as they flood into the hall, still wearing that tiny smile, and Jaskier can see the Witchers assessing their leader\u2019s temper and finding it good. Hm, this might be a good night for one of the Wolf Rising songs, something to keep everyone feeling cheerful and upbeat and heroic.\nThe food is brought out, and Jaskier takes a large helping of stew and elbows Lambert to pass him the rolls - seriously, Witcher or not, he doesn\u2019t need the whole basket - and he\u2019s in the middle of a rather silly game of grab-the-rolls when he hears Geralt growl.\nThe entire Wolf table goes still, and Jaskier turns, very carefully, to look at his lover. The tense quiet spreads through the hall, until everyone is staring up at the head table in worry and dismay.\nGeralt\u2019s eyes are blown black, and he\u2019s looking down at his ale with a frown like a thunderstorm. \u201cYen,\u201d he rumbles, and Yen stands and comes to his side, leaning down to spread a glowing hand over his mug. Her look of worry turns to anger. Oh fuck, angry sorceress, not good.\n\u201cLove potion,\u201d she says bluntly. \u201cQuadruple strength. Go.\u201d\nGeralt nods and stands, and looks at Jaskier. There\u2019s a question in his eyes.\nJaskier swallows hard. Love potion - Triss has told him a bit about those. They\u2019re often nothing more than lust potions with designated targets, and don\u2019t work terribly well against people who are already in love. Witchers are mostly immune to poison, and Jaskier has to assume the targeted nature of this potion has been deflected, either by Witcher metabolism or - flattering thought - by Geralt\u2019s own feelings for Jaskier. But the blown-wide eyes and expression of ravenous hunger under very strained control suggest that the lust portion is working quite well.\nIf Jaskier goes with him, he\u2019ll be going to bed with a Witcher whose inhibitions have been completely dismantled. Geralt won\u2019t blame him if he refuses, he knows; indeed, Geralt is likely to feel hideously guilty even for asking once he gets his wits properly back.\nBut Jaskier is not afraid of the White Wolf anymore. Inhibitions or no, he can\u2019t find even a shred of worry in his soul that Geralt will ever do him harm. He might come out of tonight bruised and sore from a truly epic night, but nothing worse than that.\nHe rises, clapping Eskel on the shoulder, and goes to his lover, proud and unafraid.\nGeralt picks him up, the ridiculous man, scoops him up in his arms and leaves the hall at a brisk trot. Jaskier waves over Geralt\u2019s shoulder before the door closes, and sees that Eskel has risen and he and Yen are clearly starting to get the situation under control. So that\u2019s alright, then; by the time this potion wears off, they\u2019ll doubtless have found the culprit. Jaskier doesn\u2019t have to worry about anything but the Witcher currently carrying him off like a war-prize.\nHe wraps his arms around Geralt\u2019s neck and nuzzles the line of his throat, and Geralt makes a low, happy sound. Yep, Jaskier was completely right. Even like this, the White Wolf of the North is a complete sweetheart.\n*\nGeralt dumps Jaskier fairly gently on the bed, and Jaskier immediately starts scrambling out of his clothing, because he likes this outfit, and even on a good day Geralt is sometimes in a clothes-ripping mood. It\u2019s appealing as hell, of course, but also hard on Jaskier\u2019s wardrobe. Thankfully, Geralt is busy ripping his own clothing off, and Jaskier is down to his smallclothes and chemise by the time Geralt is nude. Those, well, the very nice seamstress who makes his clothes already knows he goes through more chemises than anyone really ought to, and teases him about it regularly.\nGeralt pounces, it\u2019s really the only word for it, and pins Jaskier to the bed without even bothering to strip him, kissing him hungrily. Jaskier winds his arms and legs around Geralt and kisses back, of course. He can\u2019t imagine a situation where he wouldn\u2019t kiss back. \u201cMy wolf,\u201d he murmurs, when Geralt pulls away to bite kisses down his throat. \u201cCan you still talk, or have you gone completely feral, my love?\u201d\nGeralt rumbles softly. \u201cCan talk,\u201d he says at last, having worried a spectacular lovebite into the skin of Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cLittle lark. Lust potion. Won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cCan talk and knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d Jaskier says, delighted. \u201cAnd I know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\nGeralt takes a deep breath and makes a contented rumbling noise. \u201cNo fear.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no fear,\u201d Jaskier says, stroking his hair back and grinning up into blown-black eyes, the thin rings of gold like the sun in an eclipse. \u201cI will never fear you again, my wolf.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Geralt growls, and that\u2019s apparently all the words he\u2019s got left to him, because he takes Jaskier\u2019s lips in a ravenous kiss, ripping Jaskier\u2019s few remaining clothes from him as he quite effectively drives every thought except Oh fuck yes from Jaskier\u2019s mind.\nThe main difference between Geralt sober and Geralt strung out on lust potion, Jaskier decides after a few minutes of incoherent moaning, is that Geralt is a lot bitier like this. He never breaks skin, not Jaskier\u2019s wolf, but he seems very pleased by the marks he leaves scattered over Jaskier\u2019s body. Jaskier lets himself be rearranged and caressed and nibbled on, squeaking or moaning as the occasion seems to require, and then although he really ought to have expected it swears vociferously when Geralt swallows his prick like it\u2019s water in the desert.\nIt is really, really not fair that Geralt can be so good at this even while completely stoned on lust potion. Jaskier tangles his hands in moon-white hair and tries to buck his hips - and fails miserably, Geralt\u2019s hands holding him perfectly still - and swears loudly and creatively. \u201cSomeday I am going to get you to tell me how you got so fucking good at this,\u201d he manages to gasp out, and Geralt growls and yep, alright, that\u2019s enough to shove Jaskier over his peak. Geralt seems to enjoy the noise he makes, at least judging by the happy little rumbles.\nAnd then Geralt flips Jaskier over onto his front and tugs at him until Jaskier\u2019s on his knees, ass in the air. This is a good position, Jaskier is fond of it, he has many good memories of very pleasant evenings spent like this, but he\u2019s a little worried that Geralt may have forgotten the use of oil -\nGeralt\u2019s tongue swipes up along his crease, and Jaskier yelps in shock. That\u2019s new, oh fuck that\u2019s new, neither of them has even suggested this before, and apparently that was a really regrettable oversight, because oh fucking gods Geralt has a clever tongue. Jaskier buries his face in a pillow and spreads his legs a little wider and whimpers desperately as Geralt kisses him open as ardently as he\u2019s ever kissed Jaskier\u2019s mouth. Geralt is growling happily, hands gentle but implacable on Jaskier\u2019s ass, and Jaskier isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ever felt more like the White Wolf\u2019s prey than he does right now.\nFor the record, he is very happy to be devoured.\nHe devolves into incoherent begging a little faster than he\u2019d really like to admit, but Geralt doesn\u2019t seem to notice, just keeps licking, filthy and ravenous, until Jaskier is almost ready to come again - and then a broad, callused hand wraps around Jaskier\u2019s prick and he does come again, so hard it\u2019s almost painful, and flops down against the sheets in a limp heap.\nGeralt purrs with satisfaction.\nAnd then, of course, he finds the oil.\nJaskier spreads his legs as wide as they\u2019ll go and moans quietly into the pillow. It\u2019s too much, and it\u2019s so good, and Geralt\u2019s fingers feel even larger than they usually do, and really he should have guessed that a lust-drunk Geralt would want to wring him completely dry, render him speechless with overwhelming pleasure.\nGeralt takes his time opening Jaskier up, humming happily whenever he hits that one golden spot and Jaskier twitches and moans, until finally - well after Jaskier has come to the same conclusion - he decides Jaskier is loose enough, and ranges over him, prick pressing down and in, his breath hot on the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck. Jaskier whines and wriggles, trying to get Geralt in him already, and Geralt growls and pins him flat with one big hand spread over Jaskier\u2019s back and holds him still as he fucks into him so damn slowly it\u2019s maddening.\nFucking. Witcher. Self-control.\nThank every god, once he\u2019s buried deep in Jaskier, Geralt takes a long slow breath, and plants his elbows on either side of Jaskier\u2019s shoulders, and begins to fuck him properly. It\u2019s overwhelming and astonishing and so fucking good, and Jaskier does his best to push up on his knees to help and finds himself pinned down again by Geralt\u2019s body, Geralt\u2019s teeth against his shoulder, a low growl reverberating from Geralt\u2019s chest. Right, apparently he\u2019s just to hold still and be - oh gods - fucked through the mattress, that\u2019s fine, he can do that, he can absolutely do that -\nOne of Geralt\u2019s arms wraps around his waist, and his hand closes around Jaskier\u2019s prick. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d Jaskier gasps, \u201cI can\u2019t - three, I can\u2019t -\u201d\n\u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt rasps.\n\u201cSweet - fuck - sweet words don\u2019t change the fact that I am only human and - oh fuck -\u201d Jaskier whines through clenched teeth as Geralt hits that spot with distressingly perfect accuracy.\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Geralt coaxes, and Jaskier grabs at the sheets and wails with sharp-edged pleasure as he topples over his peak and straight into white unconsciousness.\n*\nJaskier wakes up wrapped in warm blankets and warmer arms, his head pillowed on a broad chest. He is sore, but not nearly as much as he thought he might be. He raises his head to check on Geralt, and meets golden eyes. \u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt murmurs.\n\u201cMy wolf,\u201d Jaskier says, smiling. \u201cBack to yourself, I see.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt agrees, and traces a finger over the livid bite-bruise on Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNope, none of that,\u201d Jaskier says briskly, settling down a little more comfortably. \u201cI knew what I was volunteering for, and I enjoyed every bit of it. You\u2019re a very considerate lover even stoned on lust potion.\u201d\nGeralt hums. \u201cCan\u2019t hurt my lark,\u201d he says simply.\nJaskier sighs happily. \u201cMy sweet wolf,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, and nuzzles Jaskier\u2019s hair gently. \u201cSleep, lark. Wore you out.\u201d\nJaskier chuckles. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, letting his eyes fall closed. \u201cDamn Witcher stamina\u2026\u201d\nHe falls asleep before Geralt can reply.\n\u201cDamn, buttercup,\u201d Lambert says at dinner the next day - Jaskier slept right through breakfast and his morning lessons with Ciri; hopefully the little menace didn\u2019t get into too much trouble. \u201cYou look ridden hard and put up wet.\u201d\nJaskier gives Lambert his best glare and sits down rather gingerly, discovering that some kind soul has left a cushion on his chair. \u201cI had a very pleasant evening, thank you,\u201d he informs Lambert, who snickers and reaches over to tap a finger very gently against the only mark Jaskier can\u2019t hide, the livid bite-mark on his throat.\n\u201cWolf marked you right and proper, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\nJaskier raises an eyebrow at him and taps a finger on his own medallion. \u201cSo he has.\u201d\nLambert shakes his head. \u201cGood on you, buttercup,\u201d he says, and raises his mug of ale in a little toast.\n\u201cSo, did Yen figure out who was stupid enough to try to drug the White Wolf?\u201d Jaskier asks.\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Lambert says, with a sharp and nasty grin. \u201cThat viscountess. Snuck into the kitchens while she was supposed to be napping, so she did. Clever. Just not clever enough.\u201d\nJaskier glances over at the noblewomen\u2019s table, seeing that Viscountess Anastazja is, in fact, not there. \u201cKicked out this morning?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Lambert says, grin getting wider and nastier. \u201cLast night, soon as Yen pointed her out. Eskel tossed her out the gates himself. Good luck to her getting down the Trail in the dark.\u201d\nJaskier winces, but only a little. Really, for a stupid trick like that, she\u2019s lucky she\u2019s alive. If she\u2019d tried that on a human monarch\u2026\nWell, if she\u2019d tried that on a human monarch without a good sorcerer in his court, she\u2019d have spent the night in his bed. But having completely failed to grasp the concept that Witchers don\u2019t react like humans do demonstrates a certain level of wilful blindness.\nEskel settles into the seat on Jaskier\u2019s other side. \u201cYou doing alright, then?\u201d\n\u201cJust fine, thank you,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning at him. \u201cHear you tossed the viscountess out the gates?\u201d\n\u201cShould\u2019ve tossed her harder,\u201d Eskel grumbles. \u201cLittle idiot. Even if she\u2019d gotten what she wanted, how did she think that was going to go? White Wolf having her in the middle of the damned hall?\u201d\nJaskier imagines that and winces. \u201cNot the best plan in the world,\u201d he agrees dryly.\n\u201cNobles,\u201d Eskel sighs. \u201cMore fucking trouble than they\u2019re worth.\u201d\nJaskier grins. \u201cI resemble that remark.\u201d\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Eskel says, and shoves a platter of mutton closer to Jaskier. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking lot less trouble than they are. Always have been.\u201d\nThe words warm Jaskier down to his bones, and he turns his attention to the mutton, knowing his cheeks are pink with pleased embarrassment.\nThe rest of the day, thank the gods, is utterly uneventful; Jaskier squirrels himself away in his rooms to compose for the whole afternoon, taking occasional breaks to dab bits of Triss\u2019s miraculous bruise balm on the tenderest marks Geralt left, and at supper nothing untoward happens at all. After supper he plays dance music without getting up - bless whoever left him this cushion, really - and Lambert asks Milena to dance, which is fucking adorable, and Geralt spends the whole evening standing behind Jaskier\u2019s chair toying with his hair, and then carries him off to bed again and spends an hour smoothing bruise balm over what seems like every inch of Jaskier\u2019s skin and then cuddles him close and makes happy rumbling noises until Jaskier falls asleep.\nJaskier is never telling anyone else how cuddly the White Wolf, terror of the continent, Warlord of the North, really is. There\u2019s making Geralt\u2019s reputation more heroic, and there\u2019s completely ruining his terrifying mystique, and Jaskier\u2019s only in the business of doing one of those things.\n*\nSomewhat to Jaskier\u2019s surprise, Yen appears to have put a brief hiatus in her plans to drive the noblewomen away. As best Jaskier can figure out, she\u2019s letting the reality of everyday life in Kaer Morhen suffice as a deterrent: cold stone, plain meals, communal bathing, and the constant company of hundreds of Witchers. (And, of course, dealing with Ciri, who is in fine form. She manages to pull off the goose trick again, paints every horse in the stables green, and sweet-talks the cooks into serving a supper that\u2019s mostly beans, making for a particularly redolent and loud evening in the great hall. And that\u2019s just in the first week. Jaskier suspects Eskel and Lambert are aiding and abetting shamelessly.) It\u2019s a sound strategy, Jaskier thinks: the noblewomen are definitely not getting any fonder of the keep or its inhabitants. Jaskier may not be able to smell fear, but he\u2019s reasonably sure that only one of the ladies currently within Kaer Morhen\u2019s walls has stopped fearing Witchers, and she\u2019s not one of the ones angling for Geralt\u2019s hand.\nPretty much everyone except the noblewomen has noticed that Milena de Roggeven and Lambert spend an awful lot of time making cow eyes at each other. Jaskier thinks it\u2019s adorable; Yen and Eskel think it\u2019s hilarious; Ciri thinks it\u2019s sweet; and Geralt is withholding an opinion until he knows how badly the whole thing is going to blow up, which is fair.\nJaskier himself would be more worried, except that Milena has taken to coming to find him every few days and asking if he\u2019d walk with her, and by the third time they end up leaning on a pair of merlons watching the Witchers beat each other up and laughing at each other\u2019s jokes, he realizes that Milena is, astonishingly and unexpectedly, a friend. It\u2019s sort of nice to have a friend who is younger than he is, for a change, and who looks up to him a little. And it\u2019s positively adorable the way she always seeks out Lambert from their vantage point on the walls, and watches him eagerly as he spars or heckles the others, her hands clasped over her mouth every time it looks like he might get hurt.\n\u201cDo remember he\u2019ll have healed by supper,\u201d he reminds her one afternoon three weeks after the noblewomen first arrived.\n\u201cYes, but it probably hurts now,\u201d Milena retorts, as Lambert spits blood and - probably, though Jaskier can\u2019t be completely certain given he\u2019s too far away to hear - swears.\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Jaskier allows. Lambert, across the training fields, punches Cedric in the face, and the sparring match devolves into a sort of very undignified wrestling match instead. Milena giggles.\n\u201cI\u2019ll grant you he doesn\u2019t seem to mind,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep trying to talk to him, you know, and it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cWhile you\u2019re dancing, you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThat, but - I asked if there were gardens we could walk in, and he said something about poisonous plants; and I asked if he had a favorite spot in the keep, and he said \u2018the baths\u2019 and then went red and ran away; and I asked if he knew any poetry, and he choked a bit and then pretty much flung me at Eskel. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing wrong.\u201d\n\u201cOh, darling,\u201d Jaskier says, charmed beyond words. Any nobleman of Redania - or any other court, for that matter - would have been delighted by such encouraging words from a pretty and well-born lady, and would have taken great pleasure in promenading through formal gardens, or escorting her to the library or a particularly scenic balcony, or reciting love sonnets on bended knee. Witchers, however\u2026\n\u201cWitchers don\u2019t court like that,\u201d he tells her gently, and a little imp of mischief - and, admittedly, the strong desire to encourage this truly adorable little love story - has him adding, \u201cAsk him to teach you to use a dagger. And I suppose you could join him in the baths.\u201d\nMilena goes beet-red and claps her hands to her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re dreadful,\u201d she squeaks. \u201cI couldn\u2019t!\u201d\nJaskier looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment. Finally he settles back against the merlon a little more comfortably and says, \u201cMilena. Is this just a flirtation, or do you actually want a Wolf of your own?\u201d\nMilena swallows hard. \u201cMy father would be furious,\u201d she says faintly.\n\u201cNot what I asked,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAnd if you stayed here, your father could be furious all he liked, but he couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it, not without pissing off an entire keep full of Witchers, which is not a wise choice. Do you want more than a month\u2019s pleasant flirtation?\u201d\nMilena looks away, down at Lambert where he\u2019s flopped out on his back beside Cedric, both of them bloody-nosed and laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s such an ass,\u201d she says softly. \u201cHe swears worse than anyone else I\u2019ve ever met, and he yells so much, and - oh, fuck it, I really do want him, Jaskier.\u201d She looks taken aback at her own vehemence for a moment, then squares her shoulders and meets Jaskier\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s honest, and he cares, and he\u2019d never be the sort of - of wicked little sneak that half the people in King Vizimir\u2019s court are, and under all the prickly he\u2019s so kind, even if he refuses to let anyone acknowledge it. He volunteered to carry me down the mountain, you know. And he glares at anyone who tries to dance with me as a joke, or to make me uncomfortable.\u201d She swallows again. \u201cAnd I like Kaer Morhen better than I do the Redanian court. It\u2019s so much more - straightforward. There\u2019s no nasty little conspiracies and gossip and ugly little secrets that only come out at the worst possible time and - Marta likes playing the game, but I don\u2019t. I hate it. And if I go back, Father will marry me off to some dreadful old count or other, and I\u2019ll have to keep playing the game until I die in childbed or get lucky enough to become a widow, and I -\u201d\nShe breaks off, breathing hard, and Jaskier waits patiently for her to put her thoughts in order.\n\u201cI\u2019d far rather stay here, and be one of the White Wolf\u2019s court, and - and learn to use a dagger, if you think Lambert would teach me, and how to help with those awful potions, and maybe learn how Witchers court,\u201d she says at last. \u201cMaybe it wouldn\u2019t work, me and Lambert - I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d see in me - but -\u201d She gives a little sniffly sort of chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you need a lady-in-waiting?\u201d\nJaskier hums. He certainly doesn\u2019t need a lady-in-waiting, but Ciri, now. She\u2019s getting to about the age when she really should have someone to help her with her hair and wardrobe when she wants to be fancy. If Milena is telling the truth - which Jaskier thinks she is, but he\u2019s not fool enough to lay money on it without getting her to say all this again where a Witcher can hear - if Milena is telling the truth, there could be a place for her here, even if she doesn\u2019t end up being Lambert\u2019s lover.\n\u201cYou should ask him for dagger lessons,\u201d he says at last. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll talk to Geralt. I can think of at least one position here that you would fit quite beautifully, and if you\u2019re willing to swear before a Witcher that you\u2019ll be loyal to the Wolf, I think Geralt would let you stay.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Milena squeaks. \u201cThank you, thank you -\u201d\nJaskier chuckles and pats her on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d he assures her. \u201cNone at all.\u201d\nHe walks her down to the noblewomen\u2019s wing, and leaves her at the door to her room like a proper gentleman, and heads up to his own rooms to spend a couple of hours composing - maybe something about a particularly growly wolf and a sweet little dove, something like that -\nAnd he\u2019s a corridor away from his own door when a woman\u2019s voice behind him says, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this farce.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s just quite a lot of pain.\n*\nJaskier wakes up in Geralt\u2019s bed, which is odd, because he distinctly remembers being on his way to his own rooms. He\u2019s also very sore, and not in the \u2018just had energetic and delightful sex\u2019 sort of way. More in a...pointy sort of way.\nHe looks down at himself, and yep, his stomach is wrapped in bandages, and now that he thinks about it, he can smell healing salves, pungent and faintly unpleasant.\nGeralt, interestingly and rather distressingly, is nowhere to be found, but Ciri is sleeping in a chair beside the bed, and Eskel is sitting on the hearth, whetting his steel sword. Jaskier makes a little sound, and Eskel stands in a single smooth motion and comes to the side of the bed.\n\u201cWater?\u201d Jaskier asks quietly, not wanting to wake Ciri, who looks exhausted and unhappy - there are tear-streaks on her cheeks, and her hair is a mess.\nEskel fetches a mug of water from the bedside table and helps Jaskier raise his head enough to sip at it. It\u2019s cool and sweet and good, and Jaskier pouts a little when Eskel takes the mug away.\n\u201cCan\u2019t have too much at once,\u201d Eskel says softly.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jaskier asks as Eskel lowers him back to the pillows. \u201cIs Geralt alright?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wolf\u2019s just fine,\u201d Eskel assures him. \u201cFurious, but fine. What happened is you were stabbed.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOw. No wonder it hurt so much. Who?\u201d\nEskel snarls a little. \u201cPrincess Agata.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says again. \u201cOops. Is she dead?\u201d\n\u201cI have never seen our Wolf so angry,\u201d Eskel says, sitting down beside Jaskier on the bed. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t kill her. He clapped her in irons and had Yen make him a portal to Vizima. I believe he is currently expressing his extreme displeasure to the king.\u201d He pats Jaskier\u2019s hand gently. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon. He didn\u2019t leave until he knew you\u2019d be alright.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s...very kind of him, I think,\u201d Jaskier says. He doesn\u2019t particularly want Agata dead, even now, but imagining her and her father both facing the full fury of the Wolf is very pleasant. \u201cHow many did he take with him?\u201d\n\u201cThirty,\u201d Eskel says, and grins fiercely as Jaskier\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to have any trouble.\u201d\nThirty Witchers isn\u2019t a diplomatic envoy or even a pointed expression of distrust, it\u2019s a fucking invasion force, and the current king of Temeria will be perfectly aware of that. If he says even one thing wrong, Jaskier might end up having to amend Geralt\u2019s list of titles again.\nWell, good. Fuck the king of Temeria and his stabby daughter anyhow.\n\u201cThe rest of the ladies?\u201d he checks.\n\u201cLeaving tomorrow, if I\u2019ve anything to say about it, which I do,\u201d Eskel growls. \u201cThey\u2019re one and all terrified of us anyhow; another week won\u2019t solve that. There\u2019s no way any of them could ever hope to be the Warlord\u2019s Consort. Fuck this charade.\u201d\nJaskier nods, and then thinks of something. \u201cMilena de Roggeven,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat of her?\u201d\n\u201cHave her swear her loyalty to the Wolf, and if she can, let her stay,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI think she will.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Eskel says, frowning a little. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t smell half as scared as the rest of them, come to think of it. And I don\u2019t think she\u2019s after Geralt.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Jaskier says, mustering a cheeky grin from somewhere. \u201cShe knows he\u2019s all mine.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cI\u2019ll give her the chance, then, and if she can swear her loyalty, I\u2019ll say you vouched for her and she can stay.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jaskier says, and feels his eyelids start to grow heavy. \u201cTriss heal me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you lost a lot of blood. Don\u2019t even think about moving until tomorrow,\u201d Eskel orders him. There\u2019s a soft creak as the door opens, and Jaskier peeks out through lead-heavy lashes to see Aubry enter. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go keep order,\u201d Eskel says softly. \u201cHeal fast, my friend. We can\u2019t lose you.\u201d\nJaskier pats Eskel\u2019s hand clumsily. \u201cI\u2019ll be good, I promise,\u201d he slurs. \u201cGo be scary.\u201d\nEskel chuckles. \u201cI will,\u201d he says, and leans down to brush a kiss against Jaskier\u2019s forehead, and is gone. Aubry settles in the spot he left, warm and solid and comfortingly dangerous, and Jaskier falls asleep thinking how very lucky he is in his friends.\n*\nWhen he wakes again, Geralt is sitting in the armchair beside the bed, Ciri asleep in his lap. Those golden eyes are fixed on Jaskier, and as soon as Geralt sees that Jaskier is awake, he rises and puts Ciri gently down on the armchair\u2019s seat and moves to sit at Jaskier\u2019s side.\n\u201cWater?\u201d he asks, and Jaskier nods, and is gently lifted so he can sip at the mug of water again.\n\u201cHow\u2019d Temeria go?\u201d he asks once Geralt lowers him back to the pillows.\nGeralt\u2019s lips peel back in a silent snarl. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we definitely put the fear of the Wolf into that fool of a king. With luck, he\u2019ll remember not to piss me off again. And Agata is now an acolyte of Melitele.\u201d His snarl gets toothier. \u201cUnder a vow of silence, poverty, and never again touching any sort of blade.\u201d\nJaskier smiles. \u201cVicious,\u201d he says, pleased. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nGeralt bends down to brush a very gentle kiss across Jaskier\u2019s lips. \u201cIf she had killed you, I would have sacked Vizima,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t die, my lark.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Jaskier promises, and yawns. This magical healing business is apparently exhausting. \u201cHm. Try not to scare Milena out of her wits tomorrow. Or is it today?\u201d\nHis eyes slide closed again, but he does hear Geralt promise, \u201cI\u2019ll try, little lark. For you.\u201d\n*\nThe third time Jaskier wakes up, he actually feels like he might stay awake for more than five minutes, and Ciri is also awake. She\u2019s also playing Gwent with Milena on the wide stretch of bed beside Jaskier - this really is an absurdly large bed, but then, Geralt is a fairly large man, and what\u2019s the point of being a Warlord if you can\u2019t have the nicest bed in three kingdoms?\nJaskier must make some sound, because Ciri looks up from the game and squeals with glee, and comes scrambling over to sit beside him. It jostles the bed a bit, but thankfully Triss does good work; Jaskier doesn\u2019t feel anything worse than a very faint ache from his bandage-covered midsection.\n\u201cYou\u2019re alright!\u201d Ciri says. \u201cYou are alright, right, Jaskier?\u201d\n\u201cPrincess, let him breathe,\u201d Milena says, coming around the bed to help Jaskier sit up. \u201cWater? Are you in pain?\u201d\n\u201cWater would be nice, thank you,\u201d Jaskier says, and makes a quick internal assessment. Still nothing but vague aches. Bless Triss and all her works. \u201cCiri, I\u2019m fine; Triss fixed me up very well. Are you alright?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ciri says. \u201cBut you were so - there was so much blood - and you weren\u2019t moving -\u201d\nShe bursts into tears, and Jaskier wraps an arm around her and lets her cry on his shoulder, petting her hair gently. Poor thing; every other person around her could just get up and go about their day after a wound like that, Jaskier knows, maybe with a couple of stitches or a swallow of healing potion. But Jaskier is a poor squishy ordinary human, and could have died of being stabbed, which Ciri is not used to dealing with.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, cub,\u201d Jaskier murmurs, kissing her messy hair. \u201cI\u2019m alright, and the person who did this will never be anywhere near me again. For that matter, I suspect Geralt\u2019s going to make sure there\u2019s a Witcher within arm\u2019s length of me anytime there\u2019s any strangers in the keep for the rest of my life. Or anytime I leave the keep, but he was doing that anyway - oh, my darling cub, shh, shh, I\u2019m alright, I\u2019m alright, it\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d He rocks her gently, letting the words trail away into a hummed lullaby, and Ciri goes from wretched sobbing to gentle sniffles and at last sits back and wipes her cheeks with the back of her hands. Milena hands her a handkerchief to blow her nose, and then a mug of water, and a second one for Jaskier.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Jaskier says, and sips cautiously at it; he\u2019s not sure how much he\u2019s allowed to eat or drink before Triss pronounces him fully healed. Presumably a dagger through the midsection does nasty things to one\u2019s guts, though he doesn\u2019t particularly want to think about that. \u201cSo, since you\u2019re here, have your sister and the rest been banished from Kaer Morhen?\u201d\nMilena sits down on the edge of the bed and nods. \u201cThey left a few hours ago. Eskel was - well, you know, I\u2019d stopped thinking he was scary, because he\u2019s always so polite, but he was terrifying, almost as bad as the White Wolf. He looked like he wanted to start tearing people\u2019s throats out with his teeth.\u201d She shivers. \u201cHe said anyone who wanted to could swear loyalty to the Wolf, but otherwise we had to be gone within the hour, or he\u2019d toss us out the gates himself, and not be careful how we landed.\u201d\nJaskier smiles at her. \u201cSo you swore.\u201d\nMilena\u2019s cheeks go pink. \u201cI - he - he gave me this look, and said you\u2019d mentioned my name, and I did, I swore myself to the Wolf and I meant it, and he told Marta to stop sputtering and get gone, and sent me here to sit with you and the young princess while everything got sorted.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d been there to hear it,\u201d Jaskier says, grinning. \u201cAnd I see you\u2019ve been getting on with Ciri.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Ciri says artlessly. \u201cI like her.\u201d\nJaskier hugs Ciri around the shoulders. \u201cOh good. How would you like to have a lady-in-waiting, cub? You could use someone to help you with your hair, and court manners, and - women\u2019s things, when you\u2019re a bit older. I\u2019ll have to ask your Papa, but it\u2019s up to you, too.\u201d\nCiri gives Milena an assessing sort of look, and nods. \u201cI like you, and you\u2019re Jaskier\u2019s friend,\u201d she informs the older girl. \u201cIf Papa says so, I guess you can be my lady-in-waiting, but I don\u2019t know what one does.\u201d\nMilena is looking astonished and delighted. \u201cWell, I\u2019d help you with your wardrobe and your grooming,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d run errands for you if you needed them, and keep your correspondence in order, and be your - well, your confidant if you wanted one. Someone you could talk to, and I\u2019d be sworn to your service as well as your father\u2019s, to never betray you.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Ciri, sounding rather like her father, if several octaves higher. \u201cWhat do you get?\u201d\nGood girl, clever girl, Jaskier thinks fondly. A suspicious mind like that is a very good thing for a warlord\u2019s daughter to have.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d have your protection,\u201d Milena says, settling in a little more comfortably. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to sneeze at. And I\u2019d have a designated place in the court, so I wouldn\u2019t just be depending on the charity of the Warlord. You\u2019d be expected to give me clothing - or at least the materials to make my own - out of your household budget, and perhaps to give me a small allowance of my own to buy whatever I might need.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d be part of your household, not your father\u2019s, so you\u2019d have final say on whether I could marry while under your protection, which - well, in other courts, that\u2019s quite important and valuable. But this court doesn\u2019t seem to have unpleasant old counts looking for their third wives.\u201d\nCiri wrinkles her nose. \u201cUgh, that sounds dreadful,\u201d she says. \u201cJaskier, do I have a household budget?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cWitchers do things a bit differently. You maybe should.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Ciri says again, and gives Milena a long, searching look. \u201cWell, alright, if Papa says you can, we can try it. And if we don\u2019t get on, you could maybe be Aunt Yen\u2019s lady-in-waiting. She\u2019s got a lot more clothes than I do.\u201d\nMilena\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cI would much prefer to serve you, princess,\u201d she says, sounding a bit strangled. \u201cLady Yennefer is rather terrifying.\u201d\nTriss, in the doorway, chuckles, and they all three startle. \u201cShe\u2019d be very pleased to hear you say that, lass,\u201d Triss says, coming over to the bedside and giving Milena a friendly smile. \u201cShe works hard at it.\u201d\n\u201cShe has entirely mastered it,\u201d Milena says faintly.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll like you,\u201d Triss says, and turns her attention to Jaskier. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cVery slightly achy and not at all as though I\u2019ve recently been stabbed,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cFor which I owe you a debt of thanks and probably several songs.\u201d\n\u201cEh, sing us some proper ballads the next few nights and we\u2019ll call it even,\u201d Triss says, holding a glowing hand above the bandages wrapped around Jaskier\u2019s midsection. \u201cOr better yet, don\u2019t get stabbed again.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t intend to get stabbed this time,\u201d Jaskier points out. \u201cWhat the fuck did Agata think stabbing me was going to gain her, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201d Triss says, but Milena makes a sort of uncomfortable noise, and they all turn to look at her.\n\u201cShe kept...ranting, during our \u2018quiet afternoons\u2019,\u201d Milena says. \u201cAbout how you had the place one of us ought to. Well, she said one of us, but she obviously meant herself. That the White Wolf wouldn\u2019t look at anyone else as long as he had his -\u201d she darts a look at Ciri and obviously chooses a politer word - \u201cbedmate. I thought it was just sour grapes, because we could all see how much the White Wolf cares for you, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cCharming,\u201d Jaskier says, as dryly as he can. \u201cSee, this is why I don\u2019t miss court life. Witchers don\u2019t try to stab their romantic rivals. Usually.\u201d\n\u201cWitchers have a code of conduct that says who they\u2019re allowed to stab and when,\u201d Triss observes. \u201cMost princesses don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI do!\u201d Ciri says.\n\u201cYes, but you\u2019re a princess of Witchers, now aren\u2019t you, little menace?\u201d Triss says, grinning down at her.\nThe door opens again, and Geralt comes in. Milena flinches just a little - she\u2019s already much better than she was three weeks ago, and Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019ll be over whatever fear remains in the not-too-distant future - but Ciri bounces out of the bed and runs over to hug her father tightly around the waist. \u201cJaskier\u2019s fine!\u201d she chirps.\nGeralt smiles down at her and picks her up, slinging her over his shoulders, and comes over to the side of the bed. \u201cWell enough for supper?\u201d he asks Triss.\n\u201cYes, but no singing or dancing for tonight,\u201d Triss says. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of the new bits to tear.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be as docile as a lamb,\u201d Jaskier assures her.\n\u201cGeralt, make sure he doesn\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Triss orders. Jaskier squawks in mock offense. Geralt nods gravely. Milena hides her giggle behind her hand.\nJaskier is genuinely astonished by the sudden hush that fills the hall when he walks in at Geralt\u2019s side - and the raucous cheering that replaces it. Geralt hums, low and pleased, and herds Jaskier over to his usual chair between Eskel and Lambert. Several very kind people have apparently brought him cushions, and there\u2019s a goblet of wine waiting for him, too, which suggests Yen is feeling guilty for some reason. Silly of her; nobody really expected a princess to start trying to assassinate people.\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re not dead,\u201d Lambert says, which is so very Lambert that Jaskier has to laugh.\n\u201cDid you get to scare the crap out of the entire court of Temeria?\u201d he asks.\nLambert grins. \u201cOh did I,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I made one idiot piss himself.\u201d\nJaskier grins back. \u201cOnly one? I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cHad to leave some for everyone else,\u201d Lambert says, and then looks down the table and makes an odd noise, almost a choking sound. Jaskier turns to follow his gaze and sees Triss settling Milena next to her. Lambert says faintly, \u201cI thought they all left.\u201d\nEskel catches Jaskier\u2019s eye and winks. Jaskier smirks back.\n\u201cShe swore to the Wolf,\u201d Eskel says, voice carefully even. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to be the cub\u2019s lady-in-waiting, something like that.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s - she\u2019s staying?\u201d Lambert squeaks.\n\u201cYou should go and welcome her after the meal,\u201d Jaskier suggests. \u201cBet she\u2019d be glad of a friendly face.\u201d\nLambert mutters something incomprehensible and turns to grab a platter of stewed carrots, ears a fetching shade of crimson. Eskel makes a face like he\u2019s trying very, very hard not to laugh. Jaskier leans forward a little so he can see Geralt\u2019s expression, and is delighted to see that the White Wolf, too, looks very amused. Well, his eyes are slightly crinkled and he raises one eyebrow a fraction as he sees Jaskier looking, which is as good as a full grin from anyone else. Beyond him, Yen looks over to meet Jaskier\u2019s eyes and gives him a slightly rueful smile, and Jaskier toasts her with his goblet of wine, watching the tension drain out of her shoulders as he does so. Dear Yen; Jaskier will have to find a private moment and give her a proper hug, somewhere no one can see her being so undignified as to let him.\nWhen supper is over, instead of Jaskier singing, Eskel stands. \u201cTwo announcements,\u201d he says, as the hall falls silent. \u201cAnd then I vote we have a proper brawl; I need to punch something.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a roar of cheerful agreement. Jaskier shakes his head a little: Witchers. They\u2019re darling ridiculous creatures.\n\u201cFirst thing: no more would-be consorts. If they show up, kick \u2018em out; if they ask passage through our lands, tell \u2018em no,\u201d Eskel says. A number of Witchers bang their mugs on the tables in approval.\n\u201cSecond, we got one good thing out of that clutch of fucking idiots, and she\u2019s our cub\u2019s new lady-in-waiting, Milena de Roggeven. Stand up, girl.\u201d Milena stands and curtsies, looking apprehensive but with a stubborn set to her chin. \u201cShe\u2019s sworn to the Wolf and his cub, so let her be.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a chorus of \u201cAye\u201ds, and Eskel surveys the hall briefly and then turns to Geralt. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cHave at,\u201d Geralt says, gesturing to the open space between the tables, and Eskel grins and vaults the high table, landing neatly in the center of the open area and throwing his arms wide.\n\u201cWho wants first crack?\u201d he bellows, and there\u2019s a great whoop that rings from the high ceiling and about a hundred Witchers go pouring into the open space, and in about ten seconds there\u2019s a fairly good brawl going. No one uses blades, of course, and Jaskier has learned that there are rules: no eye-gouging, no broken bones, and if someone goes down hard enough to knock him out, the Witchers around him will heave him out of the fray.\nOther than that, it\u2019s a free-for-all. Jaskier shakes his head at the noise and gets up, shifting down one space into Eskel\u2019s chair. \u201cI think he would have preferred scaring Temerians to keeping order,\u201d he says to Geralt, who hums.\n\u201cNeeded him here,\u201d he replies gruffly. \u201cHad to keep people from doing anything stupid.\u201d He frowns a little at Jaskier. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jaskier asks, but he gets up again, and Geralt shoves his chair back a bit and tugs Jaskier down into his lap, cradling him close, arms warm and snug around Jaskier\u2019s waist.\nThis is new. Nice, but new. Jaskier shrugs to himself and snuggles close, tucking his head against Geralt\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost lost you,\u201d Geralt murmurs. \u201cWant you close, little lark.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I shan\u2019t object,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cCiri might.\u201d\nCiri, overhearing this, giggles. \u201cWe could get you a bigger chair, and you could share, and I could sit on both your laps,\u201d she suggests.\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, quite as if he\u2019s actually considering it.\n\u201cThat...might be a little inappropriate,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cGiven that officially I\u2019m your court bard, and all.\u201d And not your consort, he doesn\u2019t say. He doesn\u2019t want to push. Geralt has never said he wants a consort, after all; everyone in the various courts across the continent assumes he should have one, but he\u2019s never expressed any desire to do so, that Jaskier knows of. And certainly that decree earlier makes it sound like Geralt isn\u2019t interested in even entertaining the idea.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says, with a rather different intonation this time. And then, bafflingly, \u201cShould\u2019ve left that clause in the Redanian treaty.\u201d\nJaskier sits up a bit and blinks at his lover. \u201cWhat? Which clause?\u201d\n\u201cRedanian consort,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier shakes his head as though it will help make sense of the words he\u2019s hearing.\n\u201cYou...want...a Redanian consort?\u201d he says carefully.\nGeralt sighs and leans in and kisses him very, very gently. \u201cLittle lark,\u201d he says, and those golden eyes are very clear, and the noise of the brawl seems to fade away, until all that Jaskier can hear are the quiet words rumbling from Geralt\u2019s chest. \u201cMy little lark. Tutor, advisor, bard, beloved. Already my consort in all but name. Do you want the title?\u201d\nJaskier gapes. That - he - how is Geralt always eloquent when it\u2019s going to make Jaskier fucking speechless? \u201cDo you want me to have it?\u201d he says. He does not squeak. He is a master bard, he has much better control over his voice than to squeak, and anyone who says otherwise is lying.\n\u201cI want to keep you,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cI want you at my side always.\u201d His lips quirk, just a little. \u201cIf I were just a Witcher, and you were just a bard, that would be enough. No need for titles. But\u2026\u201d He trails off and shrugs.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re the White Wolf, Warlord of the North,\u201d Jaskier says quietly. Geralt nods. Jaskier takes a deep breath. \u201cI have. I have a couple questions we should probably talk about when I\u2019m not still recovering from being stabbed. And maybe when there\u2019s not a brawl going on. But...I want to be at your side always. So.\u201d\nGeralt hums, and nods, and kisses him again, and Jaskier nestles against his shoulder and closes his eyes and listens to the slow, steady beat of Geralt\u2019s heart beneath the noise of the brawl.\n*\nHe\u2019s woken from his quiet reverie - he hasn\u2019t even really been thinking, just basking in the warmth and comfort of Geralt\u2019s embrace - by a tiny chuckle shaking the shoulder beneath his cheek, and the scrape of a chair, and raises his head in time to see Lambert go by along the table, looking determined and nervous and hopeful, which on Lambert looks a lot like irritated. Jaskier turns to watch.\nLambert reaches Milena\u2019s seat and hesitates, which is adorable. Milena looks up at him, and her cheeks go pink, and she says something Jaskier can\u2019t hear over the noise. Damn.\n\u201c\u2018Not joining the brawl?\u2019\u201d Geralt murmurs in Jaskier\u2019s ear. Oh, now that\u2019s useful. Jaskier presses a kiss to Geralt\u2019s cheek.\n\u201c\u2018No, I - do you want to go for a walk?\u2019\u201d Geralt continues, voice warm with good humor. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s - loud. I could. Show you the library?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOh, the sweetheart,\u201d Jaskier whispers.\n\u201c\u2018That sounds lovely,\u2019\u201d Geralt finishes, as Milena stands and Lambert, looking very awkward, offers her his arm. She takes it with a sweet smile, and he leads her out of the room, looking rather as though he did not expect his efforts to bear fruit and doesn\u2019t know what to do now that they have.\n\u201cAwwww,\u201d Jaskier says, beaming. \u201cGood for them. I definitely have to work on that one with the wolf and the dove now.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cSwan.\u201d\n\u201cSwan?\u201d Jaskier asks.\n\u201cQuiet and elegant,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier blinks for a moment and then grins so hard his cheeks hurt.\n\u201cYou big softy,\u201d he says, delighted. \u201cI\u2019ve figured you out: you\u2019re a complete romantic under all that gruffness!\u201d\nGeralt puts a gentle finger across his lips, and his eyes crinkle. \u201cShh,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d\nJaskier kisses Geralt\u2019s finger and settles down again, humming scraps of melody thoughtfully. Down to the shores of a mountain lake came a wolf to quench his thirst / and on the crystal water saw a swan as white as snow\u2026\n*\nHe actually feels fine the next morning - better than fine, rejuvenated, which can only partially be chalked up to having spent a night wrapped up in Geralt\u2019s arms, warm and safe. He makes the concept of a household budget into the morning\u2019s mathematics lesson for Ciri, and actually gets her interested in geography, too, by talking about where the various fabrics for her clothing come from, so he\u2019s feeling downright bouncy by the time they come down for dinner. His mood only gets better when the Witchers come flooding in from their morning practice and baths, most of them shirtless and all of them damp and cheerful, and Jaskier looks down the table to see Milena staring at Lambert with her cheeks bright red and her bottom lip between her teeth, and looks over to see Lambert, shirtless, putting his shoulders back and preening a little at her admiring gaze.\nEskel settles into his chair beside Jaskier, catches Jaskier\u2019s eye, and glances up at the ceiling as though praying for strength. Jaskier tries to suppress his laughter and ends up snorting instead. Lambert growls, though not very well.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, laugh it up, buttercup,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t spend months pining for our White Wolf.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t smell attraction,\u201d Jaskier points out.\nLambert frowns. \u201cLust isn\u2019t the same thing as liking someone, buttercup.\u201d\nJaskier ponders that for a few moments. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d he says at last. \u201cI don\u2019t care to break any confidences, mind you, but I think I\u2019m safe enough saying that you should trust what you\u2019re smelling.\u201d\n\u201cMmmph,\u201d says Lambert, looking warily hopeful, and then, very quietly, \u201cThanks.\u201d\nJaskier pats his shoulder and pretends to ignore the smile Lambert can\u2019t seem to quite suppress.\n*\nAfter dinner, Geralt catches his eye and beckons him to follow, and they end up in the White Wolf\u2019s office, just the two of them. Geralt leans back against the smaller table and gives Jaskier a long, thoughtful look.\n\u201cQuestions,\u201d he says.\nJaskier nods and sits down, leaning back and considering his words carefully. \u201cIn no particular order,\u201d he says at last. \u201cCiri\u2019s mother - is she likely to show up and want her daughter or her rightful position as the mother of your heir?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. Five, six years ago.\u201d He pauses, sighs, and adds, \u201cBe more worried about her father.\u201d\n\u201c...You\u2019re...her...father?\u201d Jaskier says warily.\n\u201cBirth father,\u201d Geralt clarifies. \u201cShe\u2019s not my blood. Surprise Child.\u201d\nJaskier\u2019s eyebrows about hit his hairline. \u201cI would not have guessed,\u201d he admits. \u201cShe\u2019s so much like you. Alright, I\u2019ll bite, who is the father?\u201d\n\u201cEmhyr var Emreis,\u201d Geralt says. Jaskier looks at him for a long moment, praying this is a particularly stupid joke, and then puts his forehead down on the table.\n\u201cYour daughter is the heir to the two largest empires on the continent,\u201d he says to the wood under his face. \u201cOf course she is. Naturally. Right. So that\u2019s. That\u2019s going to be an interesting bridge to cross if he ever comes looking for her.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, helpfully.\nJaskier sits up and gives his lover a baleful look. \u201cRight. Well, I probably don\u2019t need to worry about Emhyr var fucking Emreis showing up and demanding to be your consort, so I suppose that\u2019s really the relevant bit of that particular revelation. Out of curiosity, who was her mother?\u201d\n\u201cPavetta of Cintra,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier re-introduces his head to the table.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019ll make conquering Cintra easier,\u201d he says at last. \u201cJust wait until Calanthe finally dies and proclaim Ciri\u2019s right to the throne. Ye gods, Geralt, this is the sort of thing your advisors need to know!\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt again, but he\u2019s looking rather sheepish when Jaskier sits up to glare at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t think this Warlord thing was going to last so long,\u201d he admits. \u201cI...should tell everyone.\u201d\n\u201cEskel and Vesemir and Yen, at least,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAnd Ciri. Whoo. I did not expect that. Alright. Alright. I can deal with this. We can deal with this. Back to my original line of questions, which is about being your consort, not...the distinct possibility of the entire western half of the continent being united under Empress-Warlady-Sorceress Cirilla at some point in the future.\u201d\nGeralt is smiling, just a little. \u201cCan you think of a better empress?\u201d\n\u201cAdmittedly she\u2019s a marvel and a wonder, and probably would do a magnificent job,\u201d Jaskier allows. \u201cIn, y\u2019know, twenty or thirty years when she\u2019s got some decent life experience and has stopped playing the goose trick on unsuspecting passers-by. Whoo. Right.\u201d He closes his eyes for a moment and tries to haul his scattered brain back in order.\n\u201cSecond question,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I wanted to go traveling around your empire - possibly with Ciri, when she\u2019s a little older - and with a group of overprotective Witchers, I\u2019m not an idiot - would you...mind?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d miss you,\u201d Geralt says. Jaskier opens his eyes to see those golden eyes fixed on him, full of something he can only call fond adoration. \u201cCan\u2019t clip a lark\u2019s wings and keep it happy,\u201d Geralt adds. \u201cTravel as you please. With guards.\u201d\n\u201cWith guards. Being stabbed once was plenty,\u201d Jaskier agrees. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want to go for more than - well, a season, perhaps, at most. Enough to see a little of the world, get some new songs, sing some of mine for new audiences. I\u2019d always come home.\u201d\nGeralt\u2019s lips quirk in a sweet smile. \u201cHome to Kaer Morhen,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cHome to you,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cRight. That was easier than I might have expected. Next thing: Does Ciri mind? Or the rest of the council?\u201d\n\u201cCiri told me to name you my consort a month ago,\u201d Geralt says dryly. \u201cEskel was very clear on the fact that you fill every requirement on that damned list. Vesemir asked me what the fuck I was waiting for. And Yen told me to get my head out of my ass and ask you already.\u201d\nJaskier adores his friends, he really does. \u201cWell, that\u2019s definite. Last question.\u201d He takes a deep breath. Geralt raises an eyebrow silently. \u201cIf. If you or I happened to find someone else...appealing. Would that.\u201d Fuck, he isn\u2019t even sure how to say this. \u201cI could be happy with no one but you in my bed, ever again,\u201d he says desperately. \u201cBut it - I -\u201d\nGeralt hums, low and almost musical, and closes his eyes, leaning back to think. Jaskier watches him, heart in his throat. This was the question he was worried about, because yes, he could be happy sharing his bed with no one but Geralt, but there are so many beautiful people in the world - fuck, just in Kaer Morhen - and he really does like women as well as men, and he knows Geralt does too, and he\u2019d far rather have everything out in the open than either of them starting to sneak around and lie and have it eat away at the trust between them -\nGeralt opens his eyes. \u201cNot in our bed,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cunless it\u2019s both of us.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Jaskier says at once. He wouldn\u2019t bring someone else back to Geralt\u2019s bed, never in a million years. Well. Unless it\u2019s both of us. Isn\u2019t that an appealing thought.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cYou want someone, you tell me. I say no, you don\u2019t bed them. Same for me; you say no, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThat is completely fair,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAgreed.\u201d It makes a lot of sense - Geralt might well know more about someone than Jaskier does, or possibly even vice versa, or there might be personality conflicts, or - well. It makes sense.\nGeralt considers, humming softly to himself, and then shrugs. \u201cYou come back to me.\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Jaskier promises. \u201cI am your lark, my wolf. My heart is yours.\u201d\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt says, and pushes himself off the table, crossing the room to stand beside Jaskier\u2019s chair. \u201cThat it?\u201d\nJaskier stands, slowly, and Geralt doesn\u2019t back away. They\u2019re chest to chest, eye to eye - Jaskier always forgets that they\u2019re very nearly the same height, because Geralt is so large, his presence filling any room he enters, but Jaskier can look him square in the eyes, breathing the same air, noses almost brushing. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he says, very quietly. \u201cAre you sure, my wolf? Do you really want to name me your consort?\u201d\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt says again, just as softly, just as gently. \u201cAlready my consort in all but name.\u201d He lifts a hand to tap the medallion about Jaskier\u2019s throat, then curls it gently around the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Are you?\u201d\nJaskier takes a deep breath. This is it, the last chance to back out, to say \u2018Nope, I can\u2019t do it,\u2019 to stay nothing more than court bard and lover, tutor and advisor - in other words, all the duties and none of the titles. None of the right to sit beside his beloved and dare the world to try to separate them. None of the surety of knowing down to his bones that the White Wolf has chosen him above all others.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep me, my wolf. I\u2019m yours.\u201d\nGeralt smiles, and pulls him forward into a kiss so sweet and thorough and loving that Jaskier\u2019s knees go weak.\n*\nGeralt meets Jaskier\u2019s eyes and gives a little beckoning motion of his head, and Jaskier stands and crosses behind Eskel\u2019s chair to stand beside Geralt. Geralt pushes his chair back and stands, and puts one hand on Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. Eskel gives a short, sharp whistle, and the hall falls silent, every eye turning to the White Wolf and the bard.\nThis seems familiar. Jaskier finds himself grinning helplessly, a far contrast from the last time he stood here to be claimed.\n\u201cHere is Jaskier of Kaer Morhen,\u201d Geralt says, voice ringing through the hall. \u201cMy Consort, from this day on.\u201d\n\u201cWhite Wolf!\u201d comes the answer from every throat, and then, hard on its heels, someone - Jaskier\u2019s not sure who - yells, \u201cAbout time!\u201d There\u2019s a sudden roar of laughter, and then cheering, loud and long and merry. Jaskier turns to face his love and loops his arms around Geralt\u2019s neck and pulls him into a kiss, right there in front of everyone, and the cheering turns into whooping and hollering and the sorts of bawdy encouragement that Ciri really shouldn\u2019t be hearing.\n\u201cMy little lark,\u201d Geralt murmurs as they break apart. \u201cWill you sing for me tonight?\u201d\n\u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d Jaskier says, grinning, and turns to reach for his lute where it hangs on the back of his chair.\nGeralt chuckles, low and sweet, and catches him about the waist long enough to murmur in his ear, too low even for Witchers to overhear, \u201cI meant the other sort of singing, Consort mine.\u201d\nJaskier can feel himself flush all the way to the tips of his ears, but he finishes grabbing his lute and slinging it over his chest, pokes Geralt in the chest, and says, \u201cYou are dreadful and I love you. Yes. Now let me sing for everyone else, hm?\u201d\n\u201cGo on, then,\u201d Geralt says, and sits down. Ciri climbs into his lap and gives Jaskier an expectant look. Jaskier grins at her, and strikes a chord, and the incoherent hollering of the Witchers turns all at once to a bellowed chorus, hundreds of voices strong, as he plays the Ode to Witchers as loud as his lute will strum.\n*\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jaskier asks, putting his lute down carefully on its stand, \u201chow does the White Wolf of the North claim his Consort, hm?\u201d\n\u201cAny way the Consort likes,\u201d Geralt says, and when Jaskier turns to face him, his eyes are crinkled with amusement and blown dark with lust. \u201cHow shall I claim my little lark?\u201d\nSo many options. Jaskier licks his lips. \u201cNaked would be a good start,\u201d he suggests.\nGeralt chuckles and starts to strip, and Jaskier stares for a long moment, mesmerized as always by the sheer beauty of his lover, before he gets his wits about him and quickly toes out of his own boots and shucks his clothing, leaving it in a careless heap.\nAnd Jaskier is feeling bold, tonight, bold and claimed and kept, silver medallion and golden eyes and the chorus of the Ode to Witchers all like strong wine in his blood. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose,\u201d he says, eyeing the long lean line of Geralt\u2019s back, the gorgeous strength of him, \u201cthat as the White Wolf of the North has, indeed, already claimed his Consort quite thoroughly and many times over, he might enjoy allowing his Consort to claim him?\u201d\nGeralt steps out of his trousers and kicks them to the side, leaving him bare and lovely in the firelight, and turns to smile at Jaskier, a slow toothy smile, predatory and sweet. \u201cHe might,\u201d he says, voice deep and rich like distant thunder. \u201cIs that what you want tonight?\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOr. Well. If you\u2019d enjoy it, too.\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d Geralt says, and Jaskier pounces.\nGeralt catches him, of course, but he lets Jaskier\u2019s weight stagger him, lets himself fall backwards onto the bed as though Jaskier ever could pin him. They\u2019re both laughing, Jaskier with wild delight, Geralt with obvious fondness. Geralt shifts back onto the bed until he can sprawl out properly, lifting Jaskier\u2019s weight as though it\u2019s nothing as he moves, and Jaskier laughs harder, muffling his giggles against one brawny shoulder. Geralt hums and cards his fingers through Jaskier\u2019s hair, and that gentle touch is enough to remind Jaskier that he had a plan, or at least a vague outline, or at the very least an intended goal.\nThat being seeing Geralt strung out and moaning with pleasure beneath him.\nHe rolls off of Geralt to kneel beside him, and Geralt grins up at him and laces his hands together behind his head and lounges there looking very smug, and very predatory, and so painfully beautiful it almost hurts. \u201cHedonist,\u201d Jaskier says fondly, and dives in.\nHe likes to think he was a pretty damn good lover before he started sharing Geralt\u2019s bed, but after three months he\u2019s definitely managed to learn a lot of what specifically works for Geralt, and he uses every bit of it tonight. Gentle kisses here, the scrape of teeth there, and by the time he closes his lips over the tip of Geralt\u2019s prick, the White Wolf is already moaning softly. It\u2019s intoxicating, wholly addictive.\n\u201cPass me the oil,\u201d he says, raising his head briefly, and Geralt reaches over to the bedside table and tosses the little pot down to him, and spreads his legs, lolling back against the pillows like - well, like the king he is, looking decadent and smug and more than ready for his consort to do him homage. Jaskier makes a soft sound around his mouthful - something between a groan and a whimper, it\u2019s really just as well he is muffled at the moment - and Geralt hums and reaches down to comb his fingers through Jaskier\u2019s hair.\nIt\u2019s quite unfair how sweet the man is, under all the gruffness. Jaskier fumbles for the oil.\nGeralt opens for him with astonishing ease, humming with pleasure as Jaskier introduces one, two, three fingers in swift succession. Jaskier has to assume it\u2019s something to do with Witcher abilities, something about deliberate control of muscles perhaps. Thankfully, Witcher mutations don\u2019t seem to change the presence of that remarkable spot that always makes Jaskier see stars, and it appears to do the same thing for Witchers, judging by the sudden increase in the volume and desperation of Geralt\u2019s moans. Fuck, that\u2019s hot. Jaskier is a musician, but playing his lute has never been quite as satisfying as playing a fucking symphony of Geralt\u2019s lovely sounds.\n\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt rasps at last, and Jaskier scrambles up onto his knees.\n\u201cYes, alright, fuck, you\u2019re so -\u201d Jaskier babbles, and Geralt laughs, soft and fond, and curls a hand around the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck. The weight of it is oddly calming.\nSliding into Geralt is not calming, but Jaskier hardly expected it to be. It is so fucking good that Jaskier has to bite his own lip so as not to spill like a green boy, and that isn\u2019t helped by the way Geralt\u2019s eyes slip closed and he sighs, long and sweet, and all the tension runs out of his shoulders. Jaskier bites his lip harder and sends a brief prayer up to whichever god looks out for fools and bards that he\u2019ll be able to hold out for more than a handful of thrusts.\n\u201cLittle lark,\u201d Geralt rumbles, which does not help at all.\n\u201cMy wolf,\u201d Jaskier gasps, and his hips start moving without his really deciding to let them, and Geralt spreads his legs wider, braces his feet on the bed and opens for him, and oh gods, oh fuck, oh help, there\u2019s no way in hell Jaskier\u2019s going to be able to hold out, but he can at least wrap his hand around Geralt\u2019s prick, can at least put his back into it so that he\u2019s hitting that spot just perfectly and making Geralt moan and sigh and gasp, can at least let his clever tongue say whatever it likes, praise and curses and desperate adoration falling from his lips like rain. Geralt soaks it all up, humming in pleasure, and then - gods be praised - Jaskier gets the twist of his wrist and the angle of his hips just right, and Geralt makes an almost startled sound and peaks, and the feeling of him tight around Jaskier\u2019s prick is easily enough to pull Jaskier over, too.\nHe ends up sprawled atop Geralt\u2019s chest, which is fairly normal for the end of a pleasant evening, apart from the fact that he\u2019s still buried in Geralt instead of the other way around.\n\u201cHm,\u201d Geralt rumbles, sounding immensely pleased with the world, and pets Jaskier\u2019s hair and down his back in long, soothing strokes. Jaskier kisses whichever patch of skin happens to be nearest.\n\u201cMy wolf,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYour wolf, my little lark,\u201d Geralt rumbles. \u201cMy beloved Consort.\u201d\nJaskier smiles and lifts his head to press a kiss to Geralt\u2019s lips. \u201cYour Consort, my love.\u201d"
