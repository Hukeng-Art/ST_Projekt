    "text": "1.\nSaturday evening finds Ochako sprawled on the floor of one of the empty rooms in the girls\u2019 side of the dormitory. Aizawa had given them permission to convert one of the rooms into a hang out spot since it wasn\u2019t being used for anything else, and tonight the girls joined forces to transform it in the biggest, fluffiest, softest pillow fort in existence.\nThere\u2019s pillows, \u00a0bean bag chairs, futons, and soft blankets covering every inch of the floor. A couple board games are stacked to the side, not too far from the television and gaming system they set up.\nYaomomo somehow was able to produce a flatscreen TV to install in the room, and Ochako could have kissed her. If she\u2019s going to kick ass at Mario Kart, she wants to win in HD.\nThere are a couple of bedsheets hung overhead to give off the effect of a tent, soft fairy lights strung along the edges with adjustable brightness because Yaomomo is a genius.\nAs soon as Ochako had walked in, she wanted nothing more than to stretch out, roll herself into a blanket burrito and nap for the next two days. The only thing keeping her from doing just that had been Eri standing close to her and looking at everything with wide eyes, bare toes wiggling into the softness of blankets.\nEri likes soft things, Ochako has noticed. It\u2019s not hard to when she had spent the entire time running her little hands through the fluffy blanket she had been given, putting it against her face, wrapping it tightly around herself.\nIt was adorable, and Ochako had snapped a couple of pictures to send to Deku, who had immediately replied with endless crying emojis, quickly followed by a whole paragraph about how happy he was that Eri looked happy.\nEri isn\u2019t looking so happy now, and Ochako doesn\u2019t know what went wrong.\nThey played games, taught Eri old playground songs as they gently guided her to an intricate slap of hands. Momo braided Eri\u2019s hair into something overcomplicated but adorable. Mina had even brought with her the completed box set of an old cartoon that had all of them looking attentively at the television with the same rapt attention that they all had at age five, gasping and cooing along with Eri.\nOchako has some experience babysitting kids. She used to take care of some of her neighbors\u2019 brats when she lived back home to earn some extra money for her parents. There were some kids that stole money from their parents\u2019 wallets. Ochako put money in her parents\u2019 wallets.\nAnd because she\u2019s used to babysitting she knows the importance of keeping to a schedule as closely as possible, of tiring kids out but letting them wind down before bed, and when the time had come, Momo had dimmed the lights and pulled out a heavy looking tome of fairy tales with gilded edges, and started reading from it.\nThey\u2019re in the second story, waiting for Eri to fall asleep with little success.\n\u201cDo you not like the stories, Eri-chan?\u201d Ochako asks in a whisper.\nEri is curled up on herself, hands in loose fists pressed to her chest, and an apprehensive little frown on her face.\n\u201cI like them,\u201d she says in a voice just as quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t, you know? We can read something else.\u201d\nEri shakes her head, curls her kitten-pattern pajama clad legs to her chest. \u201cI like them,\u201d she repeats.\n\u201cEri-chan,\u201d \u00a0Tsuyu calls, propping herself up on an elbow so she can look at Eri from Ochako\u2019s other side. \u201cIs this your first time sleeping without Aizawa nearby?\u201d\nEri chews on her lip, and then nods slowly.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid, Eri-chan. We\u2019ll keep you safe,\u201d Tsuyu says.\n\u201cDo you want us to call Mr. Aizawa?\u201d Momo asks, having stopped reading when she hear them talk.\nEri looks over at her and minutely shakes her head.\n\u201cIs there anyone else you want us to call?\u201d Ochako asks gently, and Eri chews on her lip and looks down and away. \u201cDo you want me to call Deku?\u201d Ochako pushes, and it\u2019s worth it for the way Eri\u2019s head snaps back up to her, eyes wide with hope, before she looks away again.\n\u201cI\u2019ll send him a text!\u201d Mina pipes up, already having her phone out and typing rapidly on it. \u201cHe\u2019s just on the other side of the building, Eri-chan,\u201d she waves the phone at her with a wide smile that squints her eyes shut. \u201cAll done, he should be here any min-\u201c\nThe door to the room slams open, making them all jump and jerk their heads towards it. Ochako brings her fists up instinctively, heart hammering in her throat.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Eri?\u201d Deku demands, standing in the doorway, green lightning sparking off his skin, eyes shifting around wildly as if looking for a threat, body braced in a battle stance.\n\u201cShe can\u2019t sleep,\u201d says Tsuyu, who recovers from the shock quicker than the rest of them.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Deku says, and straightens up, face coloring red. He shifts a little in place, looks away from them, rubbing at the back of his neck self-consciously \u2013 a habit he no doubt picked up with Shinsou. \u201cUm. Sorry for barging in like that.\u201d\nMina breaks the tension by laughing. \u201cDamn Midori that was fast!\u201d The rest of them laugh a little too to shake off their nervous energy.\nIt\u2019s not the first time she thinks this, but it\u2019s kind of unsettling to have the intensity Deku usually reserves for villains and other threats turned on them.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Deky says, coloring further. He chances a glance up and locks eyes with Eri, gives her a little helpless smile and a tiny adorable wave. \u201cHi, Eri-chan. Are you having fun?\u201d\nEri nods. \u201cEveryone\u2019s really nice,\u201d she says, and Deku\u2019s posture relaxes a little further. \u201cWe watched Totoro and Doraemon and Sailor Moon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really glad,\u201d he says, and gives her that eye-squinting smile.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in, Midoriya?\u201d Tsuyu suggests. \u201cI\u2019m sure Eri-chan would have an easier time falling asleep with you around.\u201d She punctuates the sentence with a croak.\n\u201cI, uh-\u201c Deku says, looking between all the girls hesitantly, before his eyes land on Eri. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with everyone?\u201d His voice pitches up higher than usual.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Midoriya-san,\u201d Momo assures him. \u201cCome in.\u201d\nDeku steps carefully into the room with a, \u201cPardon the intrusion.\u201d He climbs over pillows and both Jirou, Hagakure, and Mina, who are stretched out between the door and where Eri is laying on a veritable mountain of pillows and blankets.\nHe sits down on Eri\u2019s other side, and Eri immediately scoots a little closer to him, grips the hem of his sleep shirt, which in true Deku fashion has \u201cpajama\u201d written across the chest. Deku instinctually puts a hand down on the floor behind her back, giving her more space to press against his side.\nOchako suddenly remembers the training camp and how Deku had been the first one to try to greet Kouta. Remembers him always looking around for the boy with a little frown and a twist to his mouth.\nShe knows, probably better than most, that Deku seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to people who need help. He can\u2019t bear seeing anyone in pain, can\u2019t bear knowing he can do something about it and just stand by idly.\nShe also knows that later, when she asked about what made him approach Kouta in the first place, his answer would have a \u201cBesides, I always wanted a little sibling,\u201d bashfully tacked on to it.\n\u201cMomo was reading a story,\u201d Ochako says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all lay down and listen to the rest of it?\u201d\nDeku looks down at Eri and whispers low enough that only her and Ochako can hear it by virtue of how close to Eri she\u2019s sitting, \u201cIs that okay?\u201d\nEri nods again and wiggles until she can lay down again. Deku lays down next to her, scarred hand between them, palm up, and Eri takes it just as Momo starts reading again.\nOchako has seen Deku punch through walls with that hand. She has seen him punch through a great deal of many things, she has seen him defeat villains single-handedly, she knows what those hands can do, the power behind them, the brute strength. Deku often breaks his chopsticks at lunch because he gets a little distracted and forgets to manage his grip strength.\nAnd yet, the way he curls his fingers, crooked and scarred as they are, around Eri\u2019s hand is so unbelievably soft and gentle, it makes Ochako\u2019s heart ache a little.\nShe closes her eyes and lets Momo\u2019s warm voice wash over them.\nWhen she opens them again at the end of the story and looks over, Eri is fast asleep, hand still firmly in Deku\u2019s even if his fingers have fallen lax in sleep too. Deku already has a fairly baby-ish face, but that\u2019s even truer when it\u2019s slack with sleep.\nThey both look so peaceful, Ochako wants to snap a picture.\n\u201cFloat me, Ochako,\u201d Mina whispers, phone already in hands. \u201cI want to get a good shot.\u201d\nSo Ochako does.\n\u00a0\n2.\nMomo prides herself of many things, and one of them is helping her peers in anything they need.\nAnd while Eri isn\u2019t her peer, exactly, Momo still takes great pride in helping her catch up on everything she missed by not being able to attend pre-school. She has a lesson plan and teaching aids. She has a schedule. She has\u2026 acquired a truly ridiculous amount of stationary and arts and crafts supplies, because her allowance is big and every time she goes into a stationary store she thinks, \u201cMaybe this will be a good motivational tool for Eri,\u201d and buys it.\nHer room is overflowing with them, but Eri delights whenever Momo brings her something new, and Momo maybe melts a little bit. Granted Momo isn\u2019t great with children, especially difficult children, but Eri is an easy child. She\u2019s a joy to be around, well and truly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing very good, Eri-chan,\u201d she praises warmly.\nEri gives her a tiny smile and blushes a little. Eri melts under any kind of praise, blossoms under it, so Momo is sure to pile as much as she can on her.\n\u201cThank you, Yaomomo-san,\u201d she says quietly, and then looks down at the table bashfully, picks up a slice of peeled tangerine that Midoriya has not so subtly been pushing her way ever since they sat down.\nAll of Eri\u2019s work smell like tangerines and are stained with their juice, no matter how many wipes Momo pushes into Eri\u2019s hands.\nMomo guesses this is what she gets for putting a kotatsu in the common room and choosing it as a place of study.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a little break?\u201d Momo asks. \u201cAnd then we can do some drawings. Does that sound okay?\u201d\nEri nods, and immediately scrambles around the table to go sit next to Midoriya, peeking over his arm to see what he\u2019s doing. Midoriya lifts his arm to let her duck under it so she can have a closer look.\nMidoriya sits in on every tutoring lesson. He brings his notebooks and homework and does it next to Eri, and it works wonders to keep Eri relaxed. He offers extra encouragement when Eri struggles with something, steps in to help Momo when she\u2019s explaining things in a way Eri isn\u2019t getting.\nHe\u2019s dubbed himself Momo\u2019s teaching assistant and Momo can\u2019t say she minds. Midoriya is a lot of help, even if he keeps sneaking Eri food. Though to be fair to him, he also keeps sneaking Momo food.\nA peeled tangerine is pushed her way, and when she glances up Midoriya is already peeling another, teaching Eri how to do it. She struggles to break the skin with her short nails, and Midoriya trades tangerines with her so she can finish peeling off his and he can start on hers.\nThe whole thing is fairly domestic and it makes Momo think of how much of a good brother Midoriya would make. How much of a good brother he already seems to be, unofficially as it is.\nMomo eats her tangerine because she doesn\u2019t want to be rude, and then she gathers every work sheet in a neat pile and gets up. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I bought some new things for Eri to try.\u201d\nMidoriya and Eri both nod in acknowledgement.\n\u201cThank you, Yaomomo-san,\u201d Eri says with a little smile, which is definitely worth the money Momo spent on a high quality set of a 120 markers.\nShe plans to go get them in her room and then come back, the whole thing shouldn\u2019t take her more than five minutes, but she gets derailed because Hagakure lost one of her contacts and asks for help to find it, and then Jirou informs her that Kaminari is taped to the ceiling again, and then Satou intercepts her with a freshly baked tray of cookies which she can\u2019t really pass up.\nSo a five minute trip turns into a fourty minute affair, and when she comes back to the living room she finds Eri asleep, cheek pressed against Midoriya\u2019s side and drooling into his shirt.\nMidoriya either hasn\u2019t noticed yet, or doesn\u2019t mind because he has an arm around her back, propping her against him and making sure she\u2019s comfortable.\nMomo feels bad that she took so long that Eri grew bored enough to fall asleep. She presses her lips together and sits down across from Midoriya.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the delay,\u201d she says earnestly.\n\u201cNo worries. Eri-chan was tired, she\u2019d probably have fallen asleep either way.\u201d\nMomo isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s just saying that to make her feel better or not, but she doesn\u2019t know Midoriya to be a liar and she\u2019s trying to be better about not beating herself up for minor things, so she takes his words to heart and tries not to worry.\nInstead she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were left handed.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not,\u201d Midoriya says, right arm still firmly wrapped around Eri. \u201cBut I\u2019m working on being ambidextrous,\u201d he flexes his fingers a little, \u201cjust in case, you know?\u201d\nMomo does know, but she really wishes she didn\u2019t. There\u2019s something perturbing about one of her close classmates having to make plans in case he stops being able to use one of his arms.\nShe doesn\u2019t know how to reply to that. Luckily, she\u2019s spared from having to do it by Shinsou walking into the living room, taking in the scene, and asking, \u201cOh, we napping?\u201d before promptly laying down with his head on Midoriya\u2019s lap.\n\u201cHey, what am I? A pillow?\u201d Midoriya asks, but there\u2019s a laugh in his voice and he doesn\u2019t sound terribly put out by it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s free real estate,\u201d Shinsou says, voice a little muffled, and Midoriya stifles a laugh, looking over at Eri when he\u2019s done to make sure she\u2019s still asleep.\nThey spend the next hour in relative silence. Shinsou falls asleep too, and Midoriya keeps working on his notebook, handwriting messier than usual.\nMomo works on study guides she promised Mina and Kaminari, and when Eri wakes up, she shows her the new markers she bought along with the brightly colored sketchpad and watches, beyond pleased with herself, as Eri\u2019s eyes widen in awe and she dumps all the markers on the kotatsu, touching each of them with reverent fingers before she sets on drawing.\nMomo, very valiantly, only tears up a little when Eri presents her with a drawing of the two of them.\n\u00a0\n3.\nThey all have bad days.\nEijirou knows this maybe better than anyone, because Eijirou is everyone\u2019s friend, and because he\u2019s everyone\u2019s friend, he does his very best to help them in any way he can. He cares about everyone so deeply, he\u2019s fought alongside them, he\u2019s seen them grow and be better, he\u2019s helped and been helped in their communal journey to become heroes, to become great.\nEijirou has stood beside his classmates countless times ready to do whatever it took to make sure everyone came back breathing.\nHis mother used to tell him that he cares too much about too many things. Not in a mean way, not in a scolding way. She used to say it while petting a hand through his hair, cuddling him close to her body, worried about how much of himself he gave away.\nHe still hasn\u2019t found that balance between helping and making sure he doesn\u2019t break while doing it.\nIt helps that he has people who are willing to give just as much back, people he can trust with his life and with his heart, people he can trust with all his bad days.\nThis is not a bad day for Eijirou, but it is one for Midoriya.\nThey all have tells.\nEijirou\u2019s is getting quiet, he\u2019s told. Bakugou\u2019s is reverting back to those first months at UA, pushing everyone away by any means necessary. Sero\u2019s is cleaning his entire room, isolating himself.\nMidoriya\u2019s is haunting around the dorms like a ghost, walking up and down the hallways with dark circles under his eyes that betray how little sleep he\u2019s been getting, sitting by windows watching attentively the scenery outside like he\u2019s scanning for threats.\nEijirou wants to help. He wants to help so much it\u2019s almost a suffocating thing, but he doesn\u2019t know how.\nThe thing about Midoriya is that he\u2019s a lot like Eijirou in one aspect. He gives too much of himself to others. Midoriya has made himself into the sort of person you go to for help if you\u2019re in trouble. Some of them will even go to Midoriya faster than they will go to Aizawa, because they know that when push comes to shove, when things start looking dire, there\u2019s always Midoriya there pushing through limits and breaking himself blue and bloody.\nIt\u2019s a dangerous thing to depend on someone like that.\nIt\u2019s an unbearably heavy load to be depended on like that.\nSometimes Eijirou looks at Midoriya and sees a heaviness to him that looks crushing, and every time he tries to make it better.\nHe\u2019s a little lost as what to do today. He\u2019s tried talking to him, tried pulling him into a friendly match of Mario Kart, tried to put on his favorite hero documentaries on in the main room if only to force him to sit and rest.\nNothing has worked so far, and Eijirou is getting worried.\nHe\u2019s not the only one. They\u2019ve become like a family and when one of them hurts it\u2019s felt through the whole dorms, especially when it\u2019s someone like Midoriya.\n\u201cDo you know what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks Shinsou, keeping his voice pitched low.\nShinsou looks tired too, but not overly so, just normal Shinsou levels of tiredness.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to sleep for a couple of days,\u201d Shinsou says, voice just as quiet, mouth twisted in a worried frown, \u201ca civilian got hurt during his last patrol,\u201d he continues and Eijirou winces because yeah, that\u2019s- that\u2019s a lot. \u201cAnd Eri has been in and out of doctor appointments for the last few days. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s making him lose sleep on top of everything else.\u201d\n\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s like this,\u201d Eijirou says, feeling his heart clench. \u201cIs Eri alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just, you know, routine stuff, but she really, really hates it. She keeps calling asking for him but he can\u2019t really go to her, so he feels like he\u2019s failing her.\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d Eijirou asks, worrying his lip between his teeth.\nHe hates seeing Midoriya like this.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shinsou says, and the sigh he lets out sounds weary. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying, but I think he\u2019ll only be able to rest when she comes back.\u201d\n\u201cIs she coming back soon?\u201d\n\u201cEither later today or tomorrow. I\u2019ve been trying to distract him, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Eijirou had tried that too, with little success.\nThey watch Midoriya pace back and forward quietly for a couple more minutes before Eijirou makes up his mind. He doesn\u2019t really like doing this, because it feels vaguely dirty to use one of Midoriya\u2019s weaknesses against him, but-\n\u201cHey, Midoriya,\u201d he says, walking up to him with what he hopes is an easy going smile. He waits for Midoriya to turn to him, eyes tired, face pinched. \u201cI\u2019ve been really struggling with History of Heroics lately, can you help me out with it?\u201d\nMidoriya chews on his lip, glances towards the window and then back. \u201cRight now?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Please? I\u2019m really worried about falling behind. I can\u2019t really afford to score badly on another test,\u201d Kirishima tells him with a wince when he remembers his score on the latest one.\nNothing he\u2019s saying is a lie. He does need help, he struggles a lot with subjects that require more memorization than anything else, but it still feels a little wrong to use Midoriya\u2019s inability to say no when someone needs help to distract him. Even if it\u2019s for his own good.\nMidoriya looks at him for a second, stares with uncharacteristically dull eyes straight into his soul, and Eijirou knows Midoriya knows what he\u2019s trying to do. But still he nods, he sighs, he says, \u201cI\u2019ll help in what I can.\u201d\nMidoriya is a lot like Eijirou in this too. When he\u2019s feeling bad, helping others helps.\n\u201cThanks, man, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d he says and claps him on the shoulder a little, throws an arm over him to lead him to his room.\nHe looks over his shoulder at Shinsou while he steers them towards the elevators, and gets a thumbs up and a mouthed \u201cthank you.\u201d\nMidoriya\u2019s a good teacher, and he does help Eijirou where he\u2019s struggling. They spent a couple of hours going over stuff before their stomachs rumble and they decide to stop for the day and go downstairs.\nEijirou makes food for both of them and makes sure Midoriya is eating.\nIt\u2019s during their early dinner that Eri comes back, dragging her feet through the door besides Aizawa, head downturned and clutching a well-worn All Might plushie that Eijirou knows for a fact is Midoriya\u2019s.\nAs soon as he sees her Midoriya drops his chopsticks and speeds walks towards her.\n\u201cEri,\u201d he says, relief palpable in his voice.\nIt makes Eri look up, eyes widening and filling with tears before she drops her plushie and runs at him. Midoriya catches her easily, holds her tight against his chest as her shoulders start to shake.\nMidoriya\u2019s whispering to her, Eijirou can hear the soft cadence of his voice, but he can\u2019t really distinguish the words, can only see Eri nodding against his shoulder, hands griped tight on his shirt. It kind of breaks Eijirou\u2019s heart.\nAizawa leans down to pick up the plushie Eri dropped and walks over to them, lips pressed together in apprehension, and eyes looking even more tired than usual. He taps the plushie against Eri\u2019s hand and she peers up at him.\n\u201cDo you want to stay here for a little bit?\u201d\nEri clutches harder at Midoriya, nods.\nAizawa offers her the plushie and she takes it, tucks it against herself.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up later, then.\u201d He says, and starts walking away. \u201cMidoriya I\u2019m trusting her to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d Midoriya says gravely, with a firm nod that seems to put Aizawa at ease as he drags himself away.\nEijirou averts his eyes for a moment, feeling like he\u2019s intruding a little bit as Midoriya comforts Eri, rocks her in the same way he\u2019s seen Midoriya do to himself in a self-soothing method, pets a hand down her back as he keeps whispering.\nHe comes back to the table a handful of minutes later, and Eijirou silently gets a serving for Eri too, who only picks at her food a little from Midoriya\u2019s lap, one hand always clutching to him like she\u2019s scared he\u2019s going to disappear.\nSometimes Eri will look up at him and Eijirou will do his best to give her reassuring little smiles, close-lipped just in case his teeth startle her. They don\u2019t, usually, but you never know with kids.\nWhen the food\u2019s all gone, Midoriya stands up, Eri on his hip and looks between her and the plates on the table, a little frown etched on his face.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the dishes, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Eijirou says, because it really costs him nothing, and he thinks he\u2019d need to be a special kind of heartless to separate those two right now.\nMidoriya chews on his lip a little bit, looks down at Eri, and then nods.\n\u201cThank you so much, Kirishima-kun. For everything. Really, thank you,\u201d and he sounds so unbearably earnest that Eijirou\u2019s heart both clenches painfully and grows two sizes.\nThere is very, very little Eijirou wouldn\u2019t do for his friends.\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s easy being kind to Midoriya, especially when kindness costs so little with him. Especially when he knows Midoriya gives kindness back just as easily.\nEveryone has bad days, and when Kirishima has them, Midoriya never hesitates to help in whatever he can.\nMidoriya and Eri wander off towards the couches, while Eijirou takes care of clean up.\nWhen he\u2019s all done, he wanders after them, just meaning to check if they need anything and if they want to be left alone or want some company. What he finds is Midoriya laying down on the couch, passed out asleep, mouth slightly open as he breathes deeply, Eri equally as asleep on his chest with one of his arms over her to make sure she won\u2019t fall down.\nEijirou can\u2019t describe how much relief it brings him to see Midoriya actually resting. He doesn\u2019t want to risk waking them up, so he lowers the volume of the television and grabs a blanket off of one of the other couches, draping it gently over them.\nHe dims the lights of the living room on his way out, and writes a quick note next to the entrance warning the others to be quiet coming in.\nThe next time he walks back into the living room is to Eri\u2019s muffled giggling and Shinsou\u2019s gentle teasing voice, and it makes him breathe a little easier.\n\u00a0\n4.\nTsuyu sits under the shade of a tree next to Aizawa and watches passively as Midoriya runs around the playground, Eri-chan sitting on one of his shoulders and Tsuyu\u2019s little sister on the other.\nTo be frank, and she always is frank, she didn\u2019t know what to think when she had been asked if they could organize a playdate between Eri and her sister. The issue of Eri not having many friends close to her age was brought up, and with the intent being her joining a normal classroom at some point in the future, they wanted to expose her to more kids her age.\nTsuyu\u2019s little sister, Satsuki, is shy around strangers, so Tsuyu wasn\u2019t sure how effective having the two girls meet would be. She had forseen a lot of awkwardly sitting around, unsure how to proceed. You can\u2019t really force two kids to interact if they really don\u2019t want to.\nShe had, of course, not accounted for Midoriya being there, like she should have.\nMidoriya is a bit of a natural with children. It had taken him exactly ten minutes to win Tsuyu\u2019s little sister over, and now, almost one hour after that, the playground has been filled with both Satsuki\u2019s and Eri\u2019s laughter as Midoriya coaxes it out of them.\nTsuyu has no idea what they\u2019re playing at now, she just knows it involves the girls riding on his shoulders, pointing at different parts of the park and making Midoriya run over, crouch down to examine some leaf or bug or tree, before they point somewhere else and he dutifully heads there.\nIt\u2019s good to see all of them having fun. Tsuyu was never under illusions of how heavy a toll being a hero takes, so she knows to treasure moments like this, moments of stillness and happiness.\nAizawa gets up slowly, patting his jumpsuit free of grass, and Tsuyu looks up at him, blinking widely. \u201cTime to go, sensei?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aizawa says on a sigh, and there\u2019s a hint of reluctance to it. He doesn\u2019t want to stop Eri\u2019s fun, Tsuyu knows.\nShe gets herself up too, grabbing their backpacks, as Aizawa calls Midoriya over and tells them it\u2019s time to go, being met with three almost identical murmurs of disappointment.\n\u201cFive more minutes?\u201d Midoriya asks hopefully.\n\u201cWe were supposed to be heading towards the station half an hour ago.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya says, blinking a little in astonishment. \u201cThank you for the extra time, sensei!\u201d he then says with a sunny smile, and starts lowering himself down, until both Eri and Satsuki can comfortably hop down from his shoulders.\n\u201cI wanted to play more,\u201d Satsuki frowns, but lets Tsuyu slip her tiny backpack over her shoulders. \u201cCan we come play again?\u201d\n\u201cAnother day, Satsuki,\u201d Tsuyu says, because given how well this went there\u2019s no way Aizawa won\u2019t plan another one of these outings.\nSatsuki pouts a little but doesn\u2019t complain, looking ahead where the rest of their group is already walking towards the exit to the park. She runs after them and grabs Midoriya\u2019s free hand, making him startle a little bit, but smile when he realizes it\u2019s just Satsuki.\nEri peers at Satsuki from Midoriya\u2019s other side, one hand firmly in his, and the other in Aizawa\u2019s.\nTsuyu takes out of her phone and snaps a couple pictures, sending them to the class\u2019 group chat immediately, because it\u2019s really too good of an image to pass up, before she follows after them.\nThe train ride isn\u2019t ridiculously long, put Satsuki and Tsuyu have been out since early morning, first running errands for their parents, and then playing, so it comes as no surprise when she falls asleep.\nTusyu opens her mouth to comment on it with Midoriya and then closes it again when she sees him nodding off, head bobbing gently with the rocking of the cart, one arm thrown over each of the girls as they both have passed out against him.\nIt makes her smile a little.\nShe takes out her phone, and takes another picture.\n\u00a0\n5.\nHitoshi loves nights like these the most, when everything feels quiet and mellow and unhurried. When he can lay down with Izuku and just breath, taking comfort in each other\u2019s presence without the need to fill the silence with conversation.\nIt's a much needed break from how hectic their usual day-to-day lives are.\nTonight everything feels so soft and slow that Hitoshi feels like he could almost fall asleep. Izuku, for someone who's so tightly packed with muscle, makes for an excellent pillow. A pillow who likes running his hands through Hitoshi's hair, only contributing for his mellow state.\nHitoshi idly thinks he could stay like this forever.\nAnd then, just as he thinks it, because Hitoshi\u2019s life is a long-winded joke with no punchline in sight, there's a knock on the door.\nThey both stop their scrolling through their phones and look up towards the door.\n\"Are you expecting anyone?\" Hitoshi asks, tilting his head to look up at Izuku.\n\"No?\" He says, looking at the door with a little confused frown.\n\"Are you going to open it?\"\n\"You\u2019re on top of me,\" Izuku tells him as if he doesn't know. \"I can't get up.\"\n\"Yesterday, you threw me over your shoulder during rescue practice.\"\n\"I did. And?\u201d\u00a0\n\"You could push me off.\"\n\"Hmm, you\u2019re right,\" Izuku says, and Hitoshi barely has time to register the mischievous glint in his eye before he\u2019s being pushed legs firs onto the floor.\nHe stumbles a little, but manages to stay standing. He gives Izuku a betrayed look.\n\"Oh, Hitoshi, now that you're up can you open the door, please?\"\n\"I'm breaking up with you,\" Hitoshi tells him, but goes to open the door. \"You're a terrible boyfriend.\"\nIzuku's response to that is to stick his tongue out at him. Hitoshi sticks his tongue back at him and opens the door, then blinks when he doesn\u2019t see anyone. He looks to the left, then to the right, and wonders if someone really just tried to prank Midoriya at eleven at night.\n\u201cUm,\u201d a tiny voice says, bringing Hitoshi\u2019s attention down.\nEri stands there in her pajamas, twisting the hems of her shirt in her fingers, looking unsure and a little scared. Hitoshi immediately softens and crouches down.\n\u201cHey, Eri-chan, do you need something.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d she repeats. \u201cIs Deku here?\u201d\n\u201cIs that Eri-chan?\u201d Izuku calls from inside. \u201cLet her in!\u201d he says.\nHitoshi dutifully steps aside, and lets Eri through, watching her scurry towards the bed, and only hesitate for a second before she starts climbing up, accidentally digging one of her bony knees into Izuku\u2019s gut and making him wince, even as he helps boost her up and over him.\nHitoshi resigns to having his spot stolen.\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Izuku asks, sitting up a little.\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" she whispers. \"Aizawa-san is working so he said I could come here.\"\n\"I see,\" Izuku says, pitching his voice into a whisper too. \"Do you wanna watch a movie?\"\nEri nods enthusiastically, eyes sparkling.\n\"Is it okay if Hitoshi sits with us?\"\nThat gets another nod, a little more hesitant but still firm.\n\"Hitoshi, can you get me my laptop, please?\"\nHitoshi grabs it from Izuku's desk, and turns back to see him arrange himself and Eri on the bed so there's enough space for Hitoshi to sit. He pats the freed space when he's done and looks at Hitoshi expectantly.\nHitoshi places the laptop in Izuku's lap and sits down, lifting an arm and putting it over Izuku\u2019s shoulders so he can lean back more comfortably and have that little extra space.\n\"What do you wanna watch?\" Izuku asks, looking over at Eri.\nAfter a couple beats of indecisive silence from Eri\u2019s side, Hitoshi says, \"Little Witch Academia.\"\n\"Oh! That's a great idea, you'll love it, Eri-chan,\" Izuku says enthusiastically, already navigating his laptop to pull up the movie.\nHitoshi feels very quietly smug that Izuku liked his idea. It turns out to be a good one because Eri loves the movie so much that Izuku pulls up the series next.\nShe watches with rapt attention, eyelids drooping as episodes fly by until she falls fully asleep pressed against Izuku, mouth slack and drooling.\nHitoshi isn\u2019t sure if Izuku doesn\u2019t notice Eri\u2019s fallen asleep or if he doesn\u2019t care because he\u2019s just that invested in the show.\nHitoshi doesn\u2019t remember falling asleep. He was more or less expecting to spend a fitful night, but when he wakes up again his phone reads 10 a.m. and he\u2019s alone in Izuku's bed, cuddling a pillow.\nHe gets up slowly, mouth uncomfortably dry and with a dull headache from sleeping more than usual.\nBlinking blearily, he makes his way into the half-bathroom in Izuku\u2019s room, grabbing the spare toothbrush he keeps there to get the taste of morning breath off his tongue, and washes his face. Only when he feels a little more human does he drag his way out of the room and downstairs for some food.\nHe hears voices from the living room and plans to just say a quick greeting on his way to the kitchen, but then gets caught with his mouth half open to speak at the scene in front of him.\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d Izuku cheers.\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d Uraraka crows, holding her hand for a high five that Izuku happily gives.\n\u201cWhy is Eri floating on a broom?\u201d he asks, watching as Eri weightlessly sits on their dorm\u2019s worn broom, both hands wrapped tightly around it and smile wide and excited. Midoriya has one hand on the broom so it doesn\u2019t completely float away.\n\u201cI\u2019m a witch!\u201d Eri says.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a witch!\u201d Izuku beams.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a witch!\u201d Hitoshi says and Eri beams. \u201cAnd I need some breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Eri says, and then turns to Izuku. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\u201cTo the kitchen!\u201d Izuku says, and starts pulling the broom towards the kitchen, Eri still comfortably perched on it, floating mid-air.\nHitoshi exchanges an amused look with Uraraka and follows them.\n\u00a0\n+1.\nShouta still remembers what it was like to spend the weeks between terms alone in his apartment, eyes hurting from looking at a screen for too long as the quiet blanketed him. He still remembers falling asleep on his couch and waking up with a crick in his neck.\nHe thinks back to those times now as he hears something break in the kitchen and Hizashi\u2019s not-quiet-enough cursing, and does not miss it one bit.\n\u201cNo one come into the kitchen! Shouta get the cats!\u201d Hizashi calls.\nShouta pushes himself off his desk, stationed in the living room at Hizashi\u2019s insistence, and goes looking for the cats.\n\u201cWhat did you break?\u201d\n\u201cNothing!\u201d\n\u201cWas it my mug?\u201d\nA telling pause. \u201cNo.\u201d\nEri pokes her head out of her room and peers down the hall.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go into the kitchen, Hizashi broke something.\u201d\nEri nods seriously, and then frowns and asks. \u201cIs he in trouble?\u201d\nOne of the cats wanders out of her room towards Shouta and he picks it up to make sure there are no accidents. The last thing they need right now is a trip to the vet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Shouta says ominously. \u201cHave you seen the others?\u201d\n\u201cI think Lotte\u2019s in Hitoshi\u2019s room. I\u2019ll get her!\u201d she says, and rushes off towards Hitoshi\u2019s room.\nShouta had been a little worried when he officially adopted Hitoshi and brought him into his house. He didn\u2019t really know how Eri would react to sharing her safe space with another kid, but letting Hitoshi go back into the foster system for vacation and holidays was ridiculous, so.\nHe didn\u2019t need to worry. Eri and Hitoshi already got along from the time they spent together at the U.A. dorms and seem to share the same love for magical girl anime. Shouta would say that the only thing that makes him rethink his decision, is how Hitoshi keeps trying to teach Eri to be a little shit and play pranks on them, but that\u2019d be a lie.\nShouta hears the distinct sound of the front door opening, quickly followed by one of his cat\u2019s mad dash towards it, and he rushes over. He does not feel like walking up and down the entire neighborhood looking for his cat. Again.\n\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d Hitoshi calls, cat safely tucked in his arms. \u201cI brought Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cPardon the intrusion,\u201d the Problem Child says, peering around curiously. \u201cIs Eri-chan around?\u201d\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hitoshi says with a mock sigh, \u201cyou\u2019re only dating me so you can see Eri during vacation.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, you caught me,\u201d Midoriya says, a hint of amusement in his voice, and Shouta very privately thinks it\u2019s good to see him relaxed and not so high-strung that he seems one word away from shaking himself apart. \u201cI wanna see my little girl.\u201d\nAs if on cue Eri comes down the hall with a disgruntled cat in her arms. The thing is so big, she can barely hold it, and Shouta wishes he had his phone at hand to take a picture. Turns out it\u2019s a good thing he had one hand relatively free because as soon as Eri sees Midoriya she puts the cat down with a happy shout of, \u201cDeku,\u201d and flies at him.\nShouta scoops Lotte up, as Hitoshi says in a weirdly sing-songy voice, \u201cHere she comes,\u201d and Midoriya catches Eri in his arms in a hug.\n\u201cOkay, the kitchen is clear!\u201d Hizashi yells out, wandering into the living room. \u201cAnd I need to go out on non-mug buying business.\u201d\n\u201cSubtle,\u201d Hitoshi says.\nHizashi kisses Shouta on the cheek and rushes out the door with a, \u201cBye, my beautiful family, don\u2019t miss me too much.\u201d The door shuts behind him.\n\u201cWhat ha-\u201c Hitoshi starts, and is cut off by the door opening again and Hizashi poking his head back in.\n\u201cDid we get a new kid?\u201d he asks, squinting at where Midoriya, Eri and Hitoshi are standing.\n\u201cNo, that one is just visiting.\u201d\nHizashi finger guns at him, \u201cGotcha,\u201d he says, punctuating it with a wink, and closes the door again.\nThey collectively stare at the door for a couple of seconds before Hitoshi puts the cat down and starts herding Midoriya and Eri down the hall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to my room.\u201d\n\u201cDo I need to tell you to leave your door open?\u201d Shouta asks, mostly just to embarrass him.\n\u201cHow would the cats get in if I closed it?\u201d Hitoshi asks.\n\u201cGood answer,\u201d Shouta says and puts his cats down, watching them zoom different ways across the living room.\n\u201cCan we watch DoReMi?\u201d Eri asks Hitoshi, and then to Midoriya, \u201cHitoshi says I can only watch new episodes with him.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Midoriya asks, giving Hitoshi an amused look.\n\u201cHush,\u201d Hitoshi tells him as they disappear down the hall and into Hitoshi\u2019s room.\nShouta sighs and shakes his head a little, going back to his work.\nHizashi comes back at some point, badly hiding a small shopping bag behind his back, as he edges his way into the kitchen, and then walks back into the living room with a brand new mug similar to the new he no doubt broke filled with coffee.\nShouta sips his coffee and doesn\u2019t say anything about it.\nHis mug is almost empty when Eri tugs on his sleeve, and with wide eyes says, \u201cHelp.\u201d\nShouta\u2019s senses immediately go into overdrive. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t reach,\u201d she says, sounding dismayed.\nShouta breathes out harshly and gets up, takes a second to stretch his stiff back before he follows Eri down the hall and towards the closet. She stands in front of it and points up to a high shelf, standing on the tips of her toes.\n\u201cYou want this?\u201d he asks, touching one of their soft extra blankets.\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d she says, and Shouta gets it down for her.\nShe bundles it in her arms, the bulk of it almost too much for her and carries it down the hall. Shouta closes the closet door before he follows her, peeking into Hitoshi\u2019s room.\nHitoshi and Midoriya are passed out asleep in Hitoshi\u2019s bed, slumped against each other. Eri is on her knees on the bed next to them, stretching the blanket out over them to the best of her abilities, trying to tuck them in.\nShe nods to herself when she\u2019s done and climbs back off the bed, taking Shouta\u2019s hand on her way out the door and tugging him away. There have been very few moments in Shouta\u2019s life where he felt this warm, but they\u2019re becoming more and more frequent.\nThey go back to the living room, and leave them to rest."
