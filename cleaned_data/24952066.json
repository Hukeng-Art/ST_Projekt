    "notes": "<p>Hey! This is sort of my first time publishing a fic. I wrote a short She-Ra fic for a class earlier this year, but that was posted under the author MDST3559014. It's called Loyalty if you wanna find it. The other stories by that author are not mine. Anyway, enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed! This probably could've been edited a little more... but I got tired of reading it and wanted to post. I have a lot of ideas for different ways Peter could meet the Avengers, so this might turn into a series. Let me know what you think! (Polite) Feedback appreciated!</p>\n<p>Hey y'all! Sorry this took a while to get out - I was sick so I have a good excuse. More info about this piece and series in the end notes. Enjoy and thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay, so. Sorry this piece is sort of just an in-between to connect the first and next chapters. I hope you still enjoyed it, and I'm excited about what it's setting up to in the next chapter.<br>Speaking of which, the next chapter will be posted on Wednesday. That'll be the last chapter to this piece.<br>However, I am also making this part of a series of pieces (mostly one-shots other than this) in which Peter meets the Avengers (or one of the Avengers or Rhodey or Ant-Man or someone like that). I just about to post a new piece, in which Peter and Rhodey meet for the first time, so if you liked this please check that out! I'll be planning on posting something every Wednesday and Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The end!</p>\n<p>I hope y'all enjoyed! Sort of a short and sweet piece, but I had originally only intended on one chapter so it is longer than I planned. <br>This piece was the first part of a series of unrelated short pieces (mostly one-shots) about Peter meeting and interacting with the Avengers/some other characters. I've already posted the second piece in the series, which is about Peter and Rhodey meeting, so I encourage you to check that out if you haven't already. I plan on updating the series pretty regularly, so keep an eye out for more. Also, if you have ideas/prompts along those lines that you want to see, please send em my way!</p>\n<p>Thanks again! Hope you enjoyed this piece.</p>",
    "text": "Pardoning the Rogues was no easy feat. Tony had spent months working to get this right, despite his lingering resentments. He had made compromises he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. He even gave in to letting them stay at the Tower. And when they decided at the last minute to push their grand welcoming date back, he\u2019d given them the benefit of the doubt. When they did it again, he begrudgingly let it slide. When they did it a third time, he began questioning why he even wanted the Rogues back again. And then today - today, he\u2019d spent 9 hours with them and the stuffy government suits double-checking every last clause before they\u2019d sign on. The whole time with pointed stares and palpable animosity. And now he, Steve, Nat, Clint, Sam, and Rhodey all stood silently in the elevator up to the shared floor, and Tony wasn\u2019t even sure if the hard part had really started.\u00a0\n\u201cSo\u2026 you still got rooms for us or are we sharing the couch?\u201d Steve asked. It was a lame attempt at a joke, Tony knew, but still the implication hurt. Tony glanced at Rhodey, who was rolling his eyes.  Thank God for Rhodey. He\u2019d said he was coming along to the Tower to ensure everything settled fine, but Tony knew he was really there for him. And the part of Tony that needed someone to have his back won over the part of him that was screaming that he didn\u2019t need an emotional support buddy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Rogers. I haven\u2019t touched your rooms. They\u2019re all the same,\u201d Tony breathed. And it was true. The floor had felt violently empty since the Rogues left. Sometimes, he or Peter ventured down there to use the bigger gym, or if the penthouse kitchen was out of some foodstuff, but the floor had an eerie vibe. They tended to stay on Tony\u2019s floor or in the upper labs.\u00a0\nThe elevator doors pulled open, and Tony jutted out, maybe a little too quickly.\u00a0\n\u201cSo you know where your rooms are. I had the kitchen restocked yesterday. Same gym down the hall. Fresh towels and sheets in the closet. Same living room, same everything. And if you need anything, you can ask FRIDAY.\u201d Tony had already begun walking back to the elevator where Rhodey stood, eager for some time apart from his ex-best friends.\u00a0\n\u201cHey Tony,\u201d Nat\u2019s voice, quieter than normal, stopped him. He turned around and looked at her.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks for this.\u201d The real appreciative smile on her face almost made him feel hopeful. Until Rogers cut in.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I bet you couldn\u2019t have been too eager to have us in your home.\u201d And that was just too much. Was he trying to make Tony mad? Every word he\u2019d spoken since they\u2019d been brought back together undermined everything Tony had been doing to make this possible.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know Rogers, they didn\u2019t just decide to let you back. \u2018Oh,  I know  they\u2019re war criminals, but what if we pardoned them  just this once .\u2019 This took a real effort from me, and I\u2019d honestly like to see some gratitude!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI know they didn\u2019t just  decide to pardon us-\u201d\n\u201cOh, they didn\u2019t! Your government, Spangles, was thoroughly against you from the beginning-\u201d\nSam tried to cut in. \u201cOkay, we get it, Tony. Seriously, man, thanks-\u201d\n\u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t trying to sound ungrateful. But you were also against us from the beginning, and I\u2019m just saying it's clear you aren\u2019t super pleased with how this worked out for you.\u201d Steve turned around, but Tony didn\u2019t miss his mumbled, \u201cNot the most welcoming welcome I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t break out the streamers and confetti. Seriously, Rogers, can you not think of a single reason why I might not be jumping with joy to have  you  back in my home! Could you maybe see my perspective here, or is your head too far up your-\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Rhodey burst in between Tony and Steve. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had a very long, very weird day, and it\u2019s probably time for sleep? Maybe we can work on this lovely relationship-building during daylight hours.\u201d\nSteve looked like he had more to say, but Clint cut him off. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good thing we don\u2019t have to share the couch.\u201d Five pairs of eyes looked up at him expectantly, but Clint kept his gaze focused on whatever was on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019ve got company, Tony.\u201d\nTony made his way over to where Clint was on the other side of the couch, just as confused as everyone else. But when he saw a messy tousle of brown hair peek out from under a tightly wrapped blanket, Tony\u2019s guilt skyrocketed. With the last minute change of plans, Tony had completely forgotten to let Peter know that he wasn\u2019t gonna be at the Tower today. And it was Friday, which meant after lab time and some routine Spider-Man-ing, Peter usually spent the night. He\u2019d really dropped the ball on this one. And now Peter was wrapped on  this  couch, on the shared floor,  asleep , right in front of six superheroes.\u00a0\nTony crouched down and touched Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, Pete,\u201d and the others didn\u2019t miss how soft his voice had gotten. \u201cHey, kid, wake up.\u201d Peter struggled awake reluctantly, but his eyes were red and squinty. \u201cYou okay, kid? What\u2019re you doing on this floor?\u201d\n\u201cI, I-\u201d Peter squinted again, looking confused. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 You weren\u2019t in the lab or the penthouse, and I asked FRIDAY where you were, and she said something about the Avengers\u2026 I thought maybe you were on the Avengers floor.\u201d But Peter\u2019s eyes were shifting shut again before he even finished his sentence.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay, Pete? You seem out of it. You\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d Tony put his hand on Peter\u2019s forehead and called for FRIDAY.\n\u201cFRIDAY, what\u2019s up with him? Does he have a temperature?\u201d Rhodey came up behind Tony now, also worried about Peter, but maybe a little more conscious that there were four other thoroughly confused Avengers in the room.\u00a0\n\u201cMini Boss appears to have a very small fever, around 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on his symptoms and the recent outbreak, it is likely that he has a mild case of influenza type A, colloquially referred to as \u2018the flu.\u2019\u201d\nTony hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off of Peter, but Rhodey turned just in time to see Sam mouth the words \u2018Mini Boss.\u2019\n\u201cOof. Rough hand, buddy. Sorry I\u2019ve left you on the couch all evening. Come on, think you can make it to your room? Promise I won\u2019t wake you up again \u2018til morning.\u201d Peter rubbed at his eyes, still clinging to the blanket with his other hand. Clint walked up behind Rhodey\u2019s shoulder, trying to get a glance at the sick kid. When Peter\u2019s hand came away from his face, his eyes widened in shock momentarily, before settling down to confusion and concern.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m hallucinating. Colonel Rhodes is here... and Hawkeye is standing behind you. And he like, doesn\u2019t even have his bow?\u201d\u00a0\nTony turned over his shoulder to look at Rhodey and Clint. Clint\u2019s face held some mixture of concern - probably from dad instincts - and confusion. And maybe a little bit of pride for being recognized. Tony stared at them both for a moment before turning back to Peter. \u201cYeah, the flu can make you hallucinate.\u201d\nTony thought he heard a mumbled, \u2018ha ha\u2019 from Rhodey, but he wasn\u2019t really in the mood to explain to Peter that the Rogue Avengers had in fact shown up at the Tower and that this illness-ridden, groggy, whimpering Peter really was the first impression he was giving them.\u00a0\n\u201cCome on, up, up, up. To the elevator, to your room, and then you can sleep the night away.\u201d Tony pulled Peter up off the couch, and Peter leaned into him a bit as they made their way to the elevator, blanket still around Peter\u2019s shoulders. Luckily, Nat, Steve, and Sam were positioned behind the couch, where Peter couldn\u2019t see them. It wasn\u2019t until the two were inside the elevator, doors closing, when Peter glanced outward and saw the three other figures.\n\u201cWait-\u201d But the doors closed before the thought was finished.\u00a0\nThe five other superheroes stood silent and frozen, eyes fixed on the now-closed elevator. Then, what felt like all-at-once, their eyes went to Rhodey. It was Sam who broke the silence. \u201cUh, hey, what the hell was that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cUm, those were the Avengers? Like all of them. Well not Dr. Banner or Thor, but Black Widow and Hawkeye and, and\u2026 Captain America. And Rhodey. And the Falcon. They were all, I saw all\u2026 I- Maybe we should call Dr. Cho.\u201d\u00a0\nTony glanced at Peter as the elevator opened to the penthouse. \u201cRelax, kid. I lied. You\u2019re not totally crazy. Well, you\u2019re not hallucinating, at least.\u201d Tony took a deep breath as he guided Peter out of the elevator and towards his room. \u201cI, uh\u2026 Those really were the Avengers. Or you know, the war criminal ones\u2026 They came back today. Kinda unexpectedly. Well not that the whole thing was unexpected, but today\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect them to show up today. Signed the revised Accords, if you could still call them that. That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t here when you got out of school today. Again, I\u2019m sorry about that, kid.\u201d\u00a0\nThere were far too many things going on in Peter\u2019s brain now. The Avengers were back? If they\u2019d signed the Accords, or at least some form of the Accords\u2026 What did that mean for Spider-Man? And they\u2019d all come back to the Tower because they were living there now? For how long? Was there something they were training for, a reason they\u2019d come back? Would they find Dr. Banner and Thor? And what about the others? Scarlet Witch? Ant-Man? And wait\u2026 had he really just whined on Tony\u2019s couch, nose runny and eyes red, as his first impression in front of all the Avengers?!\u00a0\n\u201cOh, God. Oh my God. That has got to be like, the worst first impression ever. Oh my God.\u201d And now Tony was laughing. Tony was laughing at him about what was maybe the most embarrassing thing that had ever happened.  Oh my God . Peter glared at him.\u00a0\n\u201cCalm down, kid. You got to admit, it\u2019s a little funny. Besides, you\u2019re sick. People get sick, they\u2019ll get it.\u201d Peter wanted to argue that he didn\u2019t really think the Avengers did get sick. Definitely not super-soldier Captain America. And he really couldn\u2019t imagine Black Widow sick. But nonetheless, Peter was sick, and his sick brain was done arguing and ready for bed. Tony and Peter stepped into his bedroom, and Peter practically fell onto his bed.\u00a0\n\u201cDo we\u2026 do we have to tell them about Spider-Man? I mean about me, and me\u2026 being Spider-Man?\u201d Peter had to get this last question in, even if he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open any longer. He was only distantly aware of Tony trying to unwrap him from the throw blanket and force him under the covers.\u00a0\n\u201cNo. Not if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d And some part of Peter\u2019s brain told him to switch his death grip from the blanket to his bedsheets.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do we tell them then?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth. You\u2019re my intern. High school prodigy, inheritor of my fortune, superstar genius. Just leave out the web-slinging vigilante bit.\u201d Peter smiled at the compliments. He was relieved he didn\u2019t have to reveal his secret, and a part of him was excited. Terrible first impression and lingering animosity aside, it was gonna be awesome to be hanging out around the literal Avengers. He\u2019d finally settled into bed, and consciousness was slipping away.\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Tony. Thanks for taking care of me.\u201d Peter blinked and caught a glimpse of Tony\u2019s smile.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, kid. Get some rest. Tell FRIDAY if you need anything. Feel better.\u201d Tony was at the door, reaching for the light. Peter was nearly knocked out, when Peter\u2019s brain caught up with him.\u00a0\n\u201cWait\u2026 inheritor of your fortune?!\u201d\n\u201cGo to sleep, kid.\u201d And the lights went out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony really wanted to completely ignore the five enhanced individuals a few floors down. He really did. He didn\u2019t think they deserved an explanation about the couch-mongering teenager. He didn\u2019t owe them that. But he did owe Rhodey everything, and he was aware that he left him alone to fend off all the questions. So Tony took the elevator ride back down to the ex-Avengers floor.\u00a0\nWhen the elevator door clicked open, he heard a cacophony of voices, among which were the questions: \u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not your place to say?\u201d \u201cTony hates kids. Tony has always hated kids. I swear Tony hates kids.\u201d \u201cHow old is he anyway?\u201d But the voices all cut to silence, and all eyes were on Tony when he stepped out of the elevator.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, platypus. Thought I\u2019d come down here and rescue you from the vultures.\u201d Despite being clearly stressed out, Rhodey did have a bit of a smirk on his face. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get some food in you and return you to your government-minted vault.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHold up, Tony,\u201d Nat spoke first, and that was probably a good thing, since she was really the only one Tony still considered a friend. \u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d\nTony looked around at their faces, still hoping he could maybe push this off for a day or two. \u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Peter is\u2026 your\u2026?\u201d It was Clint this time, and although Tony had never been very close with Clint, and they weren\u2019t on the same page with the Accords, he felt some connection on this point. Clint seemed like he understood. Tony wasn\u2019t willing to fully accept that it was because Clint had also had a secret family.\nTony wasn\u2019t an idiot. He knew what it looked like.  Oh, he\u2019s my intern. My intern who has a room in the Tower, who spends Friday nights here. My intern who I\u2019m nicer to than anyone else, who has total clearance on all floors of the Tower. My 16-year-old intern.  That was gonna be a hard-sell to anyone, let alone a group of mistrustful crime-fighters who knew his playboy past, including a renowned superspy. Nonetheless, Tony had promised not to tell them about Spider-Man, and he wasn\u2019t about to pretend that Peter was some long-lost son, so \u2018intern\u2019 was exactly what he went with.\u00a0\n\u201cIntern. Super smart, prodigy, genius. Works in the labs. Really, kid\u2019s incredible. Remarkable stuff.\u201d Nat, Clint, Steve, and Sam all glanced at each other, with a few raised eyebrows. Nat, arms crossed, spoke up.\u00a0\n\u201cYour intern\u2026 who lives in your building?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, Peter doesn\u2019t live here. He just stays over sometimes. I wasn\u2019t gonna make him hike all the way back to Queens with the flu. I\u2019m not that cruel of a boss.\u201d\nNow Steve cut in. \u201cYou hate kids. You took a teenage intern?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, like I said, super smart. Really, crazy smart.\u201d\nSam\u2019s turn. \u201cThe robot voice. She called him Mini Boss.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s called FRIDAY. And you probably don\u2019t know this yet, but I give everybody nicknames. I\u2019m a nickname guy. Right, honeybear?\u201d Rhodey nodded, but he looked a little desperate. They didn\u2019t need to be arguing about this after the day they had.\u00a0\nRhodey offered some relief, \u201cLook, I thought it was a little weird the first time I met Peter too, but he really is super smart. He\u2019s a cool kid too. You guys will like him.\u201d Tony appreciated the help, but he wasn\u2019t so sure how he liked the sound of that. He was pretty much planning on keeping these guys away from the kid as much as he could. He didn\u2019t think that was super likely, with Peter\u2019s enthusiasm and Tony\u2019s inability to say no to him, but he was still gonna try.\u00a0\nClint cut in quietly, head down but looking up at Tony. \u201cYou seem pretty close?\u201d\nAnd there it was. How could Tony deny that? He looked around at all the others, looking at him expectantly. And mostly they just look tired, maybe confused. But something about Steve\u2019s eyes looked mad or disappointed. And that did not sit well with Tony.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s really none of your business is it?\u201d Clint had asked the question, but Tony was looking at Steve, and Steve cut in to answer.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, it kind of is. We\u2019re living here too. We\u2019re supposed to be building back some form of trust, and you weren\u2019t even gonna mention that you\u2019ve got a kid? Living here?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re  building  trust, because trust levels, those are gone to shit now, so maybe I would\u2019ve worked up to telling you about Peter, but I don\u2019t see why I owe that to any of you. Besides, Peter doesn\u2019t live here. I already said that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, that\u2019s worse. We\u2019re supposed to be keeping low-key. How are we supposed to know that he isn\u2019t gonna go tell everyone at school that he saw all the Avengers here this weekend?\u201d\nTony heard Rhodey mumble an \u2018oof\u2019 and saw Clint shake his head. He could practically feel that Rogers was baiting him, either eager for a fight or testing to see if Tony would defend Peter. But it didn\u2019t matter if it was some stupid test. Tony wasn\u2019t gonna let him,  him of all people , stand here and question Peter\u2019s trustworthiness.\u00a0\n\u201cLook,  Rogers , that kid up there, is better, more trustworthy, more dependable than all of you put together. You wanna build back trust? Well, trust me on this one. If I say he\u2019s none of your business, he\u2019s none of your business. If I say he\u2019s trustworthy, he\u2019s trustworthy. Peter has never broken my trust. He isn\u2019t the one here who needs to be watched. And if I thought he\u2019d be better off if I didn\u2019t tell you about him, then I wasn\u2019t gonna tell you about him. I will put Peter ahead of you every single time. Get used to it.\u201d\nTony was right in Steve\u2019s face, and Steve stared right back. For a moment, everything was quiet. Then, Steve broke out into a grin. The tension was gone, and the others started chuckling. Everything Tony said caught up with him, and he knew he\u2019d said too much. If they didn\u2019t think Peter was his secret kid before, they certainly did now.\u00a0\nSam whistled and let out a quiet \u201cdamn.\u201d Tony heard Clint laugh and say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come for his kid like that, Steve.\u201d Nat just smiled and shook her head. Tony turned around and looked to Rhodey for some help, but he was laughing too. \u201cWhat can I say, man, you showed your hand.\u201d\nTony shook his head and started back towards the elevator. \u201cOkay, hardy har har laugh it up. This is gonna be super fun. I\u2019m really looking forward to this fun bonding we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nNat joined in, \u201cOh, come on, it\u2019s cute. Tony\u2019s got a heart after all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t, it\u2019s mostly metal.\u201d Rhodey joined Tony outside the elevator.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, man, tell your son we hope he feels better,\u201d Clint called out. Tony heard Nat joke, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a nephew.\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t sure how he was gonna convince them that Peter really wasn\u2019t his son, but he wasn\u2019t too worried about it. Before the elevator doors shut on him and Rhodey, he saw all his old friends smiling up at him, including Steve. Maybe this whole thing wasn\u2019t gonna be so bad after all.\n\nThis really wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s week. It had been 7 days since \n\nthe Avengers\n\n found him asleep on Tony\u2019s couch, fever-ridden and convinced they were all hallucinations. Which, Peter was pretty sure, had to be literally the worst way anyone had ever introduced themselves. Mortifying first impression aside, Peter also had the problem of the flu. He was sick in bed for 4 days, only getting up for the nausea-inducing Saturday morning car ride back to Queens. Everyone forgets how bad it is to be really sick, until you\u2019re sick again. It\u2019s like, we know being sick is bad, but we forget really how bad bad is until we\u2019re living it. May took a full day off work on Monday, convinced that his freaky spider DNA was going to have some extreme adverse reaction to being sick. By Monday night, after going through a few periods of being pretty sure he was on death\u2019s bed, Peter was finally starting to feel lucid again. He couldn\u2019t manage to convince May to let him go back to school on Tuesday, but he was able to convince her to go back to work. She had, however, made him promise that if he felt worse he would call Happy or Tony and spend the rest of the day with someone carefully watching him. Peter promised, but he had absolutely no intention of repeating Friday night\u2019s encounter, so he was thankful when he woke up Tuesday morning mostly recovered.\u00a0\n\n\nBy Wednesday, he was back in school, and although it felt good to be back in the world of the living, the make-up work didn\u2019t exactly spark joy. Peter had a surge of that not-unfamiliar feeling that there literally weren\u2019t enough hours in the day for school, homework, Academic Decathlon, sleeping, and Spider-Man. Something had to go, and he certainly wasn\u2019t about to let Queens go \n\nanother \n\nday without their favorite vigilante. So, yeah, maybe he\u2019d missed one or two practices for Decathlon, but he really didn\u2019t see why that necessitated an \u2018emergency\u2019 meeting. But instead of sitting in the cafeteria at noon on Friday, Peter was sitting in the library with the rest of the team, all looking rather irritated.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re we still waiting for?\u201d Betty had her legs crossed and was drumming her fingers along the library book sitting on the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh, Mr. Harrington, duh?\u201d Ned supplied from his seat next to Peter. \u201cAnyone know what \u2018emergency\u2019 he could\u2019ve been talking about?\u201d Peter was pretty sure it was just going to be a pointed lecture about the importance of showing up to practice, but he didn\u2019t mention that to Ned.\u00a0\n\n\nMJ grunted from her seat in the middle of the room, arms crossed. She was glaring at Flash, who was standing next to her, looking defensive. Her words came out through gritted teeth, \u201c\n\nMr. Harrington \n\ndidn\u2019t call this meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter spluttered. He didn\u2019t even realize someone else could call a meeting.\u00a0 \u201cIf he didn\u2019t call it, who did?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nI \n\nsaid this was totally unnecessary, but \n\nMr. Harrington\n\n insisted that this was a democracy and whoever wants to talk - no matter how idiotic - gets to talk.\u201d MJ still had her glare trained on Flash, and now so did everyone in the room. Peter shivered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d Flash spoke up. \u201cWe were supposed to wait until Mr. Harrington got here to start, but whatever, I called the meeting.\u201d Peter watched as Flash turned his gaze towards him. \u201cParker\u2019s missed 3 practices.\u201d A series of groans rang out. Peter, despite everyone\u2019s displeasure, felt his face turn red at the (true) accusation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on, Flash. You\u2019re really gonna make us miss lunch cause you got some problem with Parker? Why do we all have to be here?\u201d Brad scrunched his eyebrows up, arms crossed and leaning against the back wall.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe have the regional qualifiers next week! If Parker isn\u2019t even practicing, how\u2019re we gonna qualify with him on the team? I\u2019m moving to vote that Parker doesn\u2019t go to the qualifiers, and we send the alternate instead.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThe alternate? You mean you, dickhead?\u201d MJ grumbled, rolling her eyes. \n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I am the alternate.\u201d Flash shrugged, as if that was only an added bonus. But if Flash took over Peter\u2019s spot for the qualifiers, then Flash had to replace Peter on the team for any of the competitions that came after, like regionals and nationals. He was basically suggesting that Peter become the alternate for the rest of the year.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPeter only missed practices because he was sick. You can\u2019t hold that against him.\u201d Betty looked over at Peter, smiling for her little victory. Peter tried to smile back, but he knew it wasn\u2019t totally true. \n\n\n\u201cParker was out of class \u2018sick\u2019\u201d - Flash used air-quotes around the word \u2018sick,\u2019 and Peter had to roll his eyes. - \u201con Monday and Tuesday. He missed practice Wednesday and yesterday too.\u201d Peter shrunk into his seat. He couldn\u2019t really explain to the room that he had to miss practices so that Spider-Man could keep Queens safe.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, why\u2019d you miss those ones, Peter?\u201d Betty asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d Peter stuttered. It felt stupid to say he\u2019d been busy, but that was pretty much all he could say. He looked at Ned, who just looked sorry for him. \u201cI had a lot of make-up work from Monday and Tuesday, and I guess I just\u2026 fell behind? Sorry.\u201d Everyone was looking at him, and Peter could tell they were starting to doubt him.\u00a0\n\n\nNed cut in. \u201cLook, Peter\u2019s probably the best competitor on the team? So, he missed a few practices this week, but he\u2019ll go to all the ones next week before the competition, right Peter? We need him on the team.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cParker can\u2019t just slide by without practice. He\u2019s not as brilliant as you think he is,\u201d Flash stepped closer to the two of them, challenging Peter. \n\n\n\u201cOkay, maybe Flash is kinda right?\u201d Brad began reluctantly. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Parker, but it\u2019s not super fair to just skip practice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, shut up, Brad. You\u2019d really rather have Flash on the team?\u201d MJ raised her eyebrows at him, but Brad just shrugged.\u00a0\n\n\nPeter felt a little affronted now, and he tried to defend himself. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been studying and stuff, I was just really busy this week. I won\u2019t miss any more practices, and I swear I\u2019m ready for qualifiers.\u201d Peter was standing now, and Flash was standing only a little distance away.\u00a0\n\n\nNed stood up. \u201cThis is stupid. Mr. Harrington isn\u2019t even here, so we can\u2019t vote on it anyway. Let\u2019s just go back to lunch, and we can talk about it at the next practice.\u201d\n\n\nEveryone seemed ready to accept that solution except Flash. \u201cOh, I bet you\u2019re in a big hurry to get back to lunch, huh, fat kid.\u201d Flash mumbled, but everyone heard. Some people groaned, and Peter thought he heard Brad say \u201cCome on, man.\u201d\n\n\nMaybe if he hadn\u2019t spent half the week sick, if he hadn\u2019t totally embarrassed himself in front of the Avengers, if he hadn\u2019t been swamped with make-up work, if he just hadn\u2019t been \n\nso stressed\n\n this week, then maybe Peter would\u2019ve just told Flash off and walked out of the room. It wasn\u2019t like it was the first time someone picked on Ned for his size or the first time Flash said something terrible. But Flash always knew how to push Peter\u2019s buttons at just the worst time.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Flash? Just lay off of everyone else and worry about yourself, okay?\u201d Peter took a step towards Flash.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, like you\u2019ve been? I\u2019m just thinking about the team, Penis. It isn\u2019t fair how you and your weird friends get to do whatever you want with no consequences.\u201d Flash took another step forward, and Peter knew other people were talking, but he was only focused on Flash.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThinking about the team? That\u2019s bullshit, Flash. You just want to cheat your way into my spot.\u201d Part of Peter\u2019s brain was screaming that he didn\u2019t wanna be picking this fight, but he couldn\u2019t seem to listen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCheat?! I\u2019m the one who\u2019s showing up!\u201d Flash barely lifted his arm, but he made contact with Peter\u2019s chest, and pushed him, just enough to set Peter\u2019s senses off. Before Peter had even registered what happened, his fist was in front of Flash\u2019s face. His brain caught up just in time to slow down his punch and hear Mr. Harrington shout his name from the doorway.\u00a0\n\n\nPeter knew he\u2019d taken all the strength out of his punch, but Flash had stumbled backwards and was clutching his nose. And then Mr. Harrington was in front of Peter, telling Peter to restrain himself and how ashamed he was and that both he and Mr. Thompson would be headed to the principal\u2019s office and-\n\n\n\nOh shit.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPeter thought Principal Morita\u2019s face looked more bored than disappointed or reprimanding. It didn\u2019t make him feel particularly guilty or remorseful, more like uninteresting. It all seemed stupid now. If they\u2019d just waited for Mr. Harrington to come, Peter was sure he would\u2019ve been on his side, and none of this would\u2019ve escalated. But that didn\u2019t happen and now Peter and Flash were sitting in the principal\u2019s office across from Morita, with Mr. Harrington pacing behind them.\u00a0\n\n\nPrincipal Morita sighed. \u201cSo, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violence. I\u2019m sure you both know that.\u201d He looked up at them expectantly. Peter offered a \u201cyes, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I was just defending myself!\u201d Flash argued. Which was just a lie.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got witnesses who say otherwise,\u201d Mr. Harrington reminded him. Everyone else in the library had agreed that Flash pushed Peter first. Not to mention starting the argument. \u201cAnd you were strictly instructed not to even begin this meeting until I had arrived.\u201d\n\n\nFlash wasn\u2019t done arguing. \u201cYeah, well I barely touched Parker and he punched me in the face.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou pushed Peter, enough for him to stagger backwards, and although he shouldn\u2019t have hit you back,\u201d Mr. Harrington sent a pointed glare Peter\u2019s way. \u201cI saw him pull back before he hit you, and you clearly weren\u2019t hurt very bad.\u201d\n\n\nPeter was lucky that he\u2019d managed to pull back. He really had barely touched Flash, and he certainly hadn\u2019t hurt him. There weren\u2019t any marks on either of them. If there had been, Peter was sure he\u2019d be in a lot more trouble.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, well, there\u2019s a minimum punishment of 3 days suspension for fighting. I\u2019m applying that to both of you. You\u2019ll be going home now, so I\u2019ll be generous and count today as your first day. You can come back to school on Wednesday. Your situation with Decathlon is up to Mr. Harrington. I won\u2019t keep either of you off the team.\u201d The three of them looked up to Mr. Harrington to offer a solution. He stopped pacing and looked down at Peter and Flash.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, normally, if someone on the team was suspended this close to a competition, they\u2019d be out. We\u2019re supposed to practice every day next week, and you\u2019ll both have to miss Monday and Tuesday.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBut since both of you are suspended, and I don\u2019t have another alternate ready, I\u2019m keeping the team as is. Peter, you\u2019ll be competing at qualifiers, and Flash, you\u2019ll be the alternate. I expect you both to practice while you\u2019re out of school. Especially you Peter, since you missed some practices this week.\u201d\n\n\nPeter gave a silent cheer that he\u2019d get to compete after all. Even though he thought Flash was out of line, he had been a little concerned that Flash might get his spot.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Flash cut in. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t decide at the meeting! People were starting to agree with me!\u201d Flash insisted.\n\n\n\u201cWhile I find that hard to believe,\u201d Mr. Harrington began, \u201cthat was \n\nbefore \n\nyou started a fight.\u201d\n\n\nFlash grumbled to himself and sunk down into his chair.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, with that all settled, I\u2019m going to call your guardians to sign you out. You can head back to class, Mr. Harrington.\u201d Peter watched Mr. Harrington nod and walk away, shaking his head to himself. Principal Morita trained his eyes on his computer screen.\u00a0\n\n\nMay definitely wasn\u2019t going to be happy about a suspension. Peter was a real sucker for \u2018not mad, just disappointed,\u2019 and that was definitely May\u2019s style. Peter sat quietly as Principal Morita called Flash\u2019s mom. Flash was quiet now, and Peter almost felt bad for him. He knew Flash\u2019s relationship with his parents wasn\u2019t the best, and this probably wasn\u2019t going to do anything to help. After a short conversation, Principal Morita hung up, clicked through his screen again, and then began dialing a new number. The three of them sat in silence as the phone rang and rang. No one picked up. May was at work, and it wasn\u2019t totally abnormal for her to be unreachable. Peter wasn\u2019t sure what happened now. \n\n\n\u201cYour aunt didn\u2019t pick up. Should I try again?\u201d Principal Morita raised an eyebrow at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s at work. She doesn\u2019t get off for a while, so she probably won\u2019t check her phone.\u201d Peter offered, sinking a little further into his seat. Would they make him wait in some office all afternoon if she couldn\u2019t come? He hoped they would still count today towards his three days.\n\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d Principal Morita looked back towards his screen. He looked hesitant, and again raised an eyebrow at Peter, but Peter didn\u2019t really know what else to say. Morita sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll call your secondary contact.\u201d\n\n\nPeter paused. Secondary contact? Who was that? There wasn\u2019t any other family, and he didn\u2019t really think any neighbors would come all the way to Midtown to pick him up. Unless\u2026 it was Mr. Stark? But he wouldn\u2019t come to Midtown, would he? No, he\u2019d probably send Happy. Maybe that was who they were calling anyway: Happy. Yeah, Happy was probably his secondary contact.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHave you even got someone else to contact?\u201d Flash whispered. \u201cWho is it, your fairy godmother?\u201d He snickered to himself, and then seemed to think of an even funnier joke. \u201cOr better yet, Tony Stark?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPrincipal Morita\u2019s eyes went a little wide when he heard that, but the phone line was already ringing. Someone picked up, and Principal Morita started talking.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh, hello, sir? Yes, this is the principal speaking. No, he\u2019s fine. Well, not hurt. You see, he was in a bit of a fight. Yes. Well, he\u2019s been suspended. Three days is the minimum punishment for fighting, but I\u2019m counting today as the first day, since it was a very minor deal. Well, I called his primary contact first, but she didn\u2019t pick up. Oh, he needs someone to check him out. Alright, excellent. Thank you, I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d\n\n\nMorita seemed somewhat surprised by the conversation, putting the phone down slowly and then staring at it for a moment. Peter worried.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall, this week hadn\u2019t gone nearly as terribly as Tony predicted. The fights had been minimal (although there had been some fights), they started training again without many hitches, and Tony felt\u2026 okay. It felt like the five of them were falling into some pattern, and although the trust wasn\u2019t there, it felt like it could be one day. Rhodey had spent a little more time than usual at the Tower, trying to make sure that Tony was adjusting fine. Happy too had been around, trying his best to act like everything was the same as before. Today, Tony had managed to convince Rhodey that he could quit babying him, and Happy had taken the day off to visit his mother. Tony was managing through so far without the outside help. So he felt alright on Friday afternoon when he piled into the conference room with Nat, Clint, Steve, and Sam for a meeting.\n\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve got a few things to cover. It\u2019s my understanding that no one has heard from Wanda or Vision?\u201d Steve began. Everyone shook their heads. Nat cut in, \u201cI know they\u2019re in Europe, and I know we\u2019re unlikely to hear from them anytime soon. I doubt they\u2019ll want to sign.\u201d\n\n\nSteve nodded. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll keep up with that, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s high priority right now. What about Scott Lang, heard from him?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard from him,\u201d Clint began. \u201cYou know, he lives in California with his family. He\u2019s not so much reluctant to sign as\u2026 well, I think he\u2019s worried we might expect more of him if he does. He doesn\u2019t want to move his family out here or get wrapped up in something big.\u201d That seemed reasonable to Tony. Clint had been hesitant because of his family too. In fact, Clint wasn\u2019t going to be living at the Tower normally. He had spent this first week here to help everyone adjust, but after today, he was going back to living with his family upstate, and only coming for trainings and meetings some days.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have to happen. He can come up and sign and head right back to California if that\u2019s what he wants. We just want everyone on the same page. Convince him, Barton.\u201d Steve looked to Clint, who nodded. Then, Steve turned to Tony.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, so, what about Spider-Man?\u201d\n\n\nTony looked up at all of them, not sure how to approach this. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d he began. Steve sighed and shook his head, but Tony kept going. \u201cLook, Spider-Man is just a young neighborhood guy. He stays in Queens, he doesn\u2019t need to be a national level concern.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe was in Germany,\u201d Sam cut in.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd in D.C. one time,\u201d Nat added.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I brought him to Germany, and he shouldn\u2019t have been there,\u201d Tony dismissed. Germany wasn\u2019t a great subject for them to bring up. \u201cAnd he just happened to be in D.C. that one time. It\u2019s not like he was looking for trouble.\u201d\n\n\nFRIDAY\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cBoss, you have an incoming call.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSend it to voicemail,\u201d Tony waved the notification away. \u201cLook, Spider-Man isn\u2019t going to be signing, so-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBoss, the call is from Midtown School of Science and Technology.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe argument died on Tony\u2019s lips, and everyone seemed to perk up with interest. \u201cUh, okay, yeah, send it to my phone.\u201d Tony got up. \u201cSorry, I, uh, I have to take this.\u201d Tony walked out of the room as the others started whispering.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTony Stark. Hello?\u201d Tony listened as Peter\u2019s principal, Principal Morita, told him how Peter had been suspended for fighting. Not really Peter\u2019s style to say this least. And now someone had to sign him out at school. May hadn\u2019t responded to the call, probably at work. Without really thinking about it, Tony had told Morita that he\u2019d come to get Peter. He was about to send Happy when he remembered that Happy had taken the day off. He thought about maybe sending another security worker, but although Happy might\u2019ve been able to convince them to let Peter go with him, Tony doubted the school would let Peter go with some random Stark security guy. At least, he hoped they wouldn\u2019t. Tony somewhat reluctantly started back to the conference room.\n\n\nHe popped his head in, \u201cHey, I have to go.\u201d All the others looked up to him for a moment and then at each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a meeting,\u201d Steve started. \u201cWe have a lot more to talk about.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll be back. We can start it up again in like 30 minutes. But this is more important, I have to go.\u201d\n\n\nThey all looked at each other again, and Tony felt like he should just turn around and go now. But then Clint cut in. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d He sighed, \u201cYeah, but I got to go pick up Peter.\u201d Stupid \u2018trust-building.\u2019 Stupid \u2018letting them back into his life.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cHe okay?\u201d Nat asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, but he\u2019s gonna be sitting in the principal\u2019s office all day if you guys don\u2019t let me go pick him up.\u201d\n\n\nThere was another silence, but Tony noticed some smiles break out. Clint started, \u201cYou have to go pick up your not-son-just-an-intern from high school?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDamn, I wish I had a boss that sweet,\u201d Sam chimed in.\u00a0\n\n\nSteve scrunched his face in what Tony guessed was disappointment. \u201cHe\u2019s in the principal\u2019s office? Is he in trouble?\u201d\n\n\nNat laughed. \u201cOh, no! Is he gonna be grounded?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough sharing. You guys are ridiculous. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Tony turned around and started down the hallway. \u201cHe\u2019s not my son!\u201d\n\n\nPeter and Flash had been sitting outside Principal Morita\u2019s office for 15 or so minutes. They mostly sat in silence, since every time Flash started to say something the receptionist glared and started humming loud enough that Peter could barely hear his own thoughts. When she stepped into the principal\u2019s office with a stack full of papers, Flash seized on his opportunity. \u201cDo you think anyone\u2019s even coming for you? Think you\u2019ll be sitting out here all day or do you think they\u2019ll send you to some office or something to wait? If you stay here the rest of the day, it shouldn\u2019t count as one of your suspension days. You should have to be out until Thursday.\u201d\n\n\nPeter sighed, not in the mood for Flash\u2019s teasing. \u201cYes, Flash, I think someone\u2019s coming. Someone told Principal Morita they were coming, so someone must be coming.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPeter was really starting to worry about this whole thing. May was going to be so upset about it, and she might not want him going out as Spider-Man when he was supposed to be suspended, and now he was going to have two and a half more days of missed work to catch up on, and he definitely had to be ready for Decathlon next week because if he wasn\u2019t Flash would never let him hear the end of it. It was like whenever he thought his week couldn\u2019t get worse, that the universe decided to prove it could.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you kidding? You seriously don\u2019t even know who\u2019s coming to pick you up?\u201d Flash sneered.\n\n\n\u201cYou know what Flash, I\u2019m not the only one sitting out here. Where\u2019s your mom anyway?\u201d Peter bit back. Maybe it was a little bit of a low blow, but it felt like Flash deserved it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d was all Flash said. And then the receptionist came out of Morita\u2019s office, humming loud and proud, and the conversation was over. Peter looked down at his feet, hoping Happy would show up soon, and not make him talk too much. Too busy feeling bad for himself, Peter missed the sound of the door opening and footsteps coming up to the receptionist.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m here for Peter Parker.\u201d Peter\u2019s head shot up. That was Tony\u2019s voice. Tony\u2019s voice, here, in his high school. Here, in his high school, right in front of Flash. Out of the corner of his eye, Peter saw Flash\u2019s head whip up and his jaw drop open. \u201cTony Stark,\u201d Tony supplied, as if maybe the receptionist didn\u2019t know.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd maybe she didn\u2019t, because she looked up at him fairly indifferently, despite the expensive suit and his signature sunglasses. \u201cHm, yes, Mr. Stark. You\u2019ve gotta talk to Principal Morita, and then you and Peter can go.\u201d Peter watched as she walked over to the office and called for Morita. He stepped out, eyes just a little too wide to be normal, and offered Tony his hand.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d Then, he seemed to remember where he was and turned to Peter. \u201cWell, not exactly pleasurable circumstances I suppose.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPeter stood up, because he felt like he was supposed to, but he was in a bit of a daze. Tony was here, \n\nin his school\n\n, standing in front of his principal, and some unamused receptionist, and \n\nFlash Thompson\n\n of all people. This was just so weird. He felt Tony\u2019s hand come down on his shoulder, and he couldn\u2019t see but he imagined Flash\u2019s jaw had just fallen a few more inches.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, not awesome circumstances. This lovely lady said you needed to talk to me?\u201d Tony pointed his head to indicate the receptionist who, despite her demur act, blushed a bit. Since Peter had started spending more time with Tony, he noticed more and more the \n\ngenius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist \n\nact that people always loved about Tony Stark in public.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes, well, just to review Peter\u2019s situation. He got into a very minor fight, no injuries, but as we have a strict no-violence policy, both of the offending parties will be serving a three-day suspension. We\u2019re counting today as the first day, so Peter can stay home Monday and Tuesday, and come back in on Wednesday. He won\u2019t be punished in any other way, including Decathlon, so he can still compete next week.\u201d Morita tried to train his glance back on Peter, but his eyes kept drifting back to Tony. \u201cI expect you to stay out of trouble though, Peter. Peter\u2019s always been a good student and a delight to have here at Midtown.\u201d That\u2019s not really what Peter recalled. In fact, Peter recalled being more of an \n\nirritation \n\nto Morita, and he recalled getting quite a few reprimands and even the occasional detention for everything from running in the halls to skipping class (for Spider-Man related activities).\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a real delight,\u201d Tony rushed. \u201cKeep him home Monday and Tuesday, keep him out of trouble, is that all? Are we good to go?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes, yes, of course. You\u2019re good to go.\u201d Morita smiled again and Peter thought he looked a little awkward, shuffling his hands and his jacket. Morita looked around at Peter and Tony and Flash, and then clapped his hands and turned back towards his office. \u201cThank you!\u201d He called, before slowly closing his office door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOdd man,\u201d Tony muttered and turned towards Peter. Peter was ready to sprint out of this building and this situation, but before he could say anything, Flash spoke. \n\n\n\u201cHi, Mr. Stark. It\u2019s, I\u2019m\u2026 It\u2019s very cool to meet you.\u201d Flash looked like he was trying to decide whether or not to stick out his hand, and it\u2019s probably a good thing he didn\u2019t, Peter thought, judging by the semi-disgusted look on Tony\u2019s face. Peter was a little impressed by his audacity.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe kid who \n\nthis kid\n\n,\u201d Tony began, gesturing towards Peter, \u201cgot into a fight with? Yeah, I can\u2019t say the same about you.\u201d Peter was stuck between embarrassment and pure joy.\n\n\n\u201cOh, it really wasn\u2019t a big deal. No one was hurt or anything. I\u2019m sorry, Peter.\u201d Flash shrugged, and Peter felt like he forgot how to breathe. Did Flash Thompson really just say sorry? To him?!\n\n\n\u201cOh, I, uh, yeah, I\u2019m sorry too, Flash.\u201d Peter stuttered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWait, Flash? This is that kid-\u201d Tony began, but some noise came in from the front, and they turned to see Flash\u2019s mom talking to the receptionist.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Tony muttered, but he had the restraint not to say anything else.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cCome on, kid, let\u2019s go.\u201d Tony pulled Peter outside, but Peter\u2019s brain was still stuck on Flash Thompson \n\napologizing to him\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of Tony\u2019s many expensive cars was sitting on the street outside the school, and as Tony got into the driver\u2019s seat and Peter approached the passenger\u2019s, he wondered briefly if Tony was gonna be mad at him. Or disappointed? What was your mentor/boss/superhero-role-model supposed to say when you got into a fight at school? Peter figured if he wasn\u2019t the only person in the world with that kind of relationship, then he was probably the only one who had had that person \n\npick him up from school\n\n. But despite the situation, Peter couldn\u2019t shake the elated feeling from hearing \n\nFlash Thompson \n\napologize to him. Not to mention it\u2019d be a lot harder for Flash to tease him about his \u2018fake internship\u2019 now that Flash had seen Tony Stark pick him up from school. Sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, Peter\u2019s brain registered a few moments too late that Tony had said something.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh, sorry, what?\u201d Peter smiled at Tony.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, kid. You\u2019re a little too pleased for someone who just got a three-day suspension for fighting. Did that kid hit your head or something?\u201d Tony was joking, Peter knew, but it was still a little embarrassing to have Ironman worried that Spider-Man got hurt in a school fight.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it really wasn\u2019t a \n\nfight \n\nfight. We barely touched each other. And I\u2019m just\u2026 I just can\u2019t believe \n\nFlash Thompson\n\n apologized to me. I think that\u2019s maybe the first time in his life that Flash has ever said \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Like ever. It\u2019s definitely the first time I\u2019ve heard him say it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTony looked at Peter for a minute longer, then snickered and started the car. \u201cYeah, well,\u201d he grinned at Peter over his sunglasses. \u201cBeing Tony Stark has its perks.\"\u00a0\n\n\nPeter had asked if Tony was taking him back to his apartment, but it was Friday, and Tony didn\u2019t see the harm in letting him come over to the Tower and start lab time a little early. May wasn\u2019t there anyway, so was it really better to leave Peter home alone all afternoon? He\u2019d called May and left a message to let her know he got Peter from school and not to worry.\u00a0\n\n\nTony didn\u2019t want to be pushy, but he felt like he was meant to say something. You weren\u2019t supposed to pick a kid up from being suspended and not say anything about it. Tony drummed his fingers along the steering wheel, trying to figure out how to start the conversation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSo, uh, what\u2019re you doing getting into a fight at school anyway? It\u2019s not like you.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeter tilted his head and looked at him kind of funny. Tony knew he was teetering on the edge of the weird (but not super uncommon) precipice of sounding dad-like.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 Well, it was really Flash\u2019s fault. He just loves to mess with me, and he\u2019s always wanted my spot on the Decathlon Team - he\u2019s the alternate - and I missed some practices because I was sick, and there\u2019s a competition next week, and I guess he thought it was a good chance to steal my spot. So, he called some \u2018emergency\u2019 meeting at lunch to vote on whether I should have the spot or him, and everyone thought it was stupid, but he kept going on about how I wasn\u2019t prepared enough, and then Ned said we should just vote on it at the next practice and go back to lunch, and Flash had to say some stupid thing about how \u2018Of course Ned would want to go back to lunch,\u2019 and I told him to just lay off, and then he pushed me and I guess it was just stress and instincts and I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly, and I was going to hit him before I knew what was happening, but I pulled back and I ended up barely hitting him. Anyway, Mr. Harrington came in at that moment and he saw us fighting so we got sent to the office.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThere was certainly a lot to register there. Tony always found it vaguely impressive how Peter could speak for minutes without taking a breath. He also made a mental note about the competition next week. \u201cHm. How come this Mr. Harrington guy wasn\u2019t there to begin with? Seems like he should\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell he was supposed to be,\u201d Peter began. \u201cFlash was supposed to wait until he got there to start the meeting. That\u2019s why Mr. Harrington said he wasn\u2019t going to consider giving Flash the spot anymore. Cause Flash didn\u2019t wait for him.\u201d\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s good, Tony thought. So Peter didn\u2019t need to worry about losing his spot.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely a good thing you pulled that punch. I guess I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t want you to react when someone pushes you, but maybe we need to work a little more on separating Peter situations from Spider-Man situations, huh? Sounds like you kinda entered vigilante mode.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d Peter shrunk down. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not, like, mad?\u201d\n\n\n\nTony paused. He wasn\u2019t mad. He wasn\u2019t even really disappointed. But maybe he was supposed to be? He was sure May had more to say then him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not thrilled that you got suspended. But I\u2019m not gonna yell at you or something. I\u2019m sure May will have some things to say.\u201d\n\n\nPeter sighed. His face shifted into a dejected grimace. \u201cYeah, she definitely will.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou did okay, kid,\u201d Tony reached his arm over to squeeze Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou pulled back, and no one got hurt. That\u2019s what counts.\u201d\n\n\nPeter smiled as they walked into the Tower. He figured there would be more to get through once he had to face May, but now he was one awkward talk down, and he was pretty sure he was still gonna get lab time later. Now, Tony was testing him on random facts, in some attempt to make up for all the lost Decathlon practice.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of Chile?\u201d Tony asked, stepping into the elevator. \n\n\n\n\u201cSantiago.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true! I\u2019ve been there.\u201d Peter smirked. Of course Tony had been there. Tony had been everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWho developed the rabies vaccine?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLouis Pasteur.\u201d\n\n\nTony shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe? Seems right.\u201d\n\n\nPeter laughed, as the elevator stopped. Tony was looking down at his phone as he stepped onto the floor, so he didn\u2019t stop like Peter did. \u201cWho was Secretary of State during World War II?\u201d\n\n\nPeter vaguely registered someone else giving a response.\u201cOoh, I know this one.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPeter was still standing in the open elevator, staring out at the Avengers. Somehow, he\u2019d completely forgotten that they were even at the Tower, and although Tony hadn\u2019t initially noticed, Peter spotted the group as soon as the elevator doors opened. Maybe if his brain had caught up by now, he might\u2019ve laughed at the idea that Tony had just asked him a World War II trivia question in front of the most famous World War II soldier.\u00a0\n\n\nTony looked around, noticing they were on the Avengers floor. \u201cHow the hell did we get to this floor? FRIDAY, why are we on this floor?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYour elevator is set to automatically go to the penthouse unless otherwise instructed, Boss,\u201d FRIDAY offered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUh huh, and I did not otherwise instruct you!\u201d\n\n\nFRIDAY paused. \u201cThe protocol does not stipulate that you must be the one to give the instructions. Miss Romanoff made the request.\u201d\n\n\nThe Miss Romanoff in question spoke up, eyes trained on Peter and completely ignoring Tony. \u201cHello, Peter.\u201d\n\n\nPeter stepped out of the elevator, feeling stupid. Here he was, silent and jaw-dropped, standing in front of 4 superheroes (5, if you count Tony). His brain reminded him of how stupid Flash had looked just a little while ago, standing jaw-dropped in front of Tony Stark, and Peter quickly shut his mouth. He realized he\u2019d been addressed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, uh, hi. Hi, uh, Miss Romanoff.\u201d Peter replied, using the same name that FRIDAY had supplied. Miss Romanoff - or Black Widow - smiled at him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Tony cut in indignantly. \u201cAren\u2019t you all supposed to be in a meeting?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, we had to stop because of you,\u201d Steve replied. \u201cBesides, we wanted to meet your kid.\u201d\n\n\nPeter felt his cheeks turn red. \u201cMe? Uh, wait, I\u2019m not, uh\u2026\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t really sure if they meant \u2018kid\u2019 as in \n\nson\n\n, but that\u2019s what it sounded like. Why did they want to meet him anyway? \u201cI\u2019m just an intern. But it\u2019s, uh, very cool to meet you guys.\u201d Peter looked at Tony, questioningly. Tony rolled his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIntern. Intern. Peter Parker, the intern,\u201d Tony came around behind Peter and put his hands on his shoulders. \u201cAvengers, meet the intern. Intern, I guess you\u2019re meeting the Avengers.\u201d\n\n\nPeter looked past Black Widow and Captain America, and saw Hawkeye standing in the background. He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your bow this time.\u201d\n\n\nHawkeye, or Mr. Barton, smirked. \u201cYeah, kid. The rigging\u2019s broken. Tony\u2019s been telling us how \n\nyou\u2019re just his intern\n\n, and I figured if you really are just some super smart, high-school intern, you wouldn\u2019t have any problem fixing this.\u201d Mr. Barton threw him the bow, and Peter reached his hands out just in time to catch it.\u00a0\n\n\nTony started, \u201cOkay, okay, he doesn\u2019t have to do some stupid test. Come on guys, just lay off of this-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I can fix this easy.\u201d Peter looked down at the bow, and the problem really was something he could easily fix. He\u2019d worked on Avengers weapons often enough in the lab with Tony. Besides, he wasn\u2019t so worried about them thinking he was Tony\u2019s kid, but he didn\u2019t want them to be suspicious of him. If this would make them feel better around him, he was happy to do it. He looked up at Tony for confirmation.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, yeah, I guess. I guess, sure, if you want to.\u201d Tony shrugged, falling into one of the kitchen chairs. \u201cClearly, I have no control over this situation.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPeter walked over to the drawer against the wall, grabbing some tools. He put the bow down on the counter and began fixing it. Miss Romanoff and Mr. Barton followed him over, with Captain America and the Falcon close behind.\n\n\nPeter could feel Mr. Barton\u2019s breath as he watched over his shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\nTony slumped into his seat. Was he happy to have the Avengers back? Seemed like they'd taken over his Tower. Since when did FRIDAY listen to Nat? And now they had his intern in their grasps.\u00a0\n\n\nTony listened from his seat as Nat began asking Peter questions, \u201cOkay, so, how\u2019d a high-schooler end up with an internship at Stark Industries?\u201d\n\n\nPeter kept his eyes focused on fixing Clint\u2019s bow, which Tony knew was a good thing, because the kid in an undistracted state would not handle an interrogation well. \u201cCompetition. We had to submit videos and stuff. They picked one high-schooler for the internship.\u201d\n\n\nNat raised a skeptical eyebrow at Tony. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cNot my idea. PR stunt. But, you know, it worked out well.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeter looked up at him and smiled, then looked back down at his work. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat sorts of intern things do you do?\u201d Sam looked over at Peter and Clint\u2019s bow, a little confused and maybe impressed. \u201cYou get coffee and stuff? Make copies?\u201d\n\n\nTony scoffed. The idea of Peter somehow using a coffee machine.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cMostly, lab time. We work on different robots and stuff. Sometimes we work on your stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur stuff?\u201d Steve cut in. \u201cLike our tech? Weapons?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Peter shrugged. \u201cHow do you think I knew how to fix this?\u201d He gestured to Clint\u2019s bow.\u00a0\n\n\nClint started waving his hands, and Tony noticed his eyebrows were all scrunched up. \u201cWait, hold up. I thought you were like a personal intern. If you work in the labs, how come you\u2019re always hanging around up here?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPeter stopped his work for a second, and looked at Clint confused. He seemed to realize something. \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t work in, like, the intern labs. I work in Tony\u2019s lab. With Tony.\u201d\n\n\nPeter returned his gaze to his work. The Avengers, on the other hand, all looked towards Tony, most eyebrows raised.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony threw up his arms in defense. \u201cI can work with people!\u201d\n\n\nNat rolled her eyes. \u201cUh huh, yeah, you\u2019re a pro at it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs this not the same dude who won\u2019t even let other people hand him shit?\u201d Sam asked. Tony had to wonder how he knew that. \n\n\n\nPeter again looked confused. \u201cHe lets me hand him stuff all the time.\u201d\n\n\nAlright, red lights. Too personal. Tony hoped someone would change the topic.\u00a0\n\n\nLuckily, Steve cut in again, \u201cHow come you\u2019re home from school early? You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re sick anymore.\u201d\n\n\nPeter paled a bit, and Tony saw his straight face turn into a frown. \u201cI, uh, got suspended. For fighting.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFighting?\u201d Sam seemed incredulous. \u201cYou sure don\u2019t seem like a fighter, kid. But you don\u2019t have a black eye or something, so what\u2019d you do to the other kid?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Nothing, it was barely a fight. I was just\u2026 I was just defending a friend. Besides, Flash pushed me first.\u201d\n\n\nTony watched Steve shake his head, which aggravated him. What right did Steve have to judge him? \u201cFighting isn\u2019t the answer to that. There\u2019s always another way.\u201d\n\n\nTony was ready to cut in and defend Peter, or change the topic at least. He was ready, at least, before he saw Peter grin with a bit of a mischievous look in his eye. He turned his head towards Steve. \u201cSave me the lecture, Cap. I\u2019ve seen the PSAs.\u201d\n\n\nTony\u2019s ears perked up. PSAs? And now Steve was pink and frowning.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cPSAs? Tell me we\u2019ve just stumbled on some quality blackmail material.\u201d Tony raised his eyebrows. Peter looked at Steve, but Steve remained silent, looking very much like he wanted to turn invisible. Peter laughed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThey show them all the time at school.\u201d Pete lowered his voice and puffed up his chest to imitate Steve. \u201c\u2018So, you got a detention\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\n\nNat moved closer to Peter. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious. Tell me all about them.\u201d\n\n\nPeter smiled, enjoying the attention. \u201cThere\u2019s one for puberty too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! How could we be in the dark about this?\u201d Clint joined in. Sam laughed along. Steve\u2019s face turned redder by the minute.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s funny, sure. Laugh it up.\u201d He grumbled. \u201cThey paid me for those though.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFRIDAY, please tell me we have access to those?\u201d Tony looked up to his ceiling with hopeful eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, a number of the Captain America high school PSAs are on YouTube. Would you like me to pull one up?\u201d\n\n\nTony was about to shout a triumphant yes, when Steve interrupted.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo! Cut it out, Stark, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\n\nTony frowned. Last names meant trouble.\u00a0\n\n\nSam stepped up and put his hands on Steve\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOkay, Mr. Grumpy Pants. That\u2019s probably enough torture for now. No, thanks, FRIDAY.\u201d But Sam turned towards Tony, mouthed \u2018save it for later,\u2019 and winked. Tony had to admit he was warming up to Sam.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNext question. Who\u2019s your favorite Avenger?\u201d Nat changed the subject.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh, easy.\u201d Peter grinned. \u201cDr. Banner.\u201d\n\n\nTony shot up. \u201cWhat?! You haven\u2019t even met him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s like the coolest scientist ever. They have a picture of him in my physics classroom.\u201d Peter kept his eyes on his work, but Tony could see his sassy grin growing.\u00a0\n\n\nTony made a time-out symbol with his hands. \u201cWait a minute. He\u2019s your favorite Avenger and your favorite scientist? What does that make me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA weird old rich dude who feeds me and gives me a ride home from school sometimes?\u201d Peter looked up, grinning from ear-to-ear. What a little shit.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\n\nOld?!\n\n\u201d Tony shrieked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI like this kid,\u201d Nat clapped Peter on the shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHow come he did pick you up from school, though? Seems like a weird thing for a boss to do,\u201d Clint asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell, they called my aunt first. But she\u2019s working, and she can\u2019t usually look at her phone in the middle of a shift.\u201d Peter shrugged. \u201cAnd well, I guess Tony\u2019s my emergency contact.\u201d\n\n\nThe rest of the room looked at Tony, who just shrugged. \u201cWhat do you expect me to do, leave the kid on his own? I\u2019m not that cruel.\u201d Tony glared at Peter. \u201cUnlike some people. \u2018\n\nWeird old rich dude\n\n,\u2019\u201d he grumbled. The others looked willing to dispute the matter of cruelness, but Steve had another question.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou live with your aunt?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter looked back down at his work, hiding his face. A silence followed that he wasn\u2019t unused to. An unasked question lingered. He sighed. \u201cMy parents died when I was little.\u201d\n\n\nTony grimaced. More silence followed, but at least that was better than apologies.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Clint began. \u201cI think this kid really isn\u2019t a secret Stark. He\u2019s too likable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI totally agree,\u201d Nat nodded. \u201cI think Tony just took on a weird mentorship role and went totally overboard.\u201d Okay, \n\ntotally \n\noverboard seemed like an exaggeration to Tony.\n\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s like sports movies where the coach is super overbearing and attention-seeking.\u201d Sam added. Tony let out an offended, \u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFinished!\u201d Peter shouted and popped his head up. He smiled and presented the bow to Clint. \u201cGood as new, Mr. Barton.\u201d\n\n\nClint grabbed the bow and examined it. He smiled and looked up at Peter, \u201cThanks, kid, this is great. And you can call me Clint.\u201d\n\n\nLater, Peter and Tony spent the night working in the lab. After a little more - for lack of a better word - bonding, and after examining quite a few of those Captain America PSAs, Tony had managed to pull Peter away from the Avengers so that they could get some work done and maybe Peter could finally relax. Now, they were sitting in the lab, working on a little robot of Peter\u2019s creation that would lift his fork for him when he was too tired to move but also hungry. Which seemed like it might be the case right now. Tony watched as Peter put his head down on the work table.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Avengers really thought I was your son. So crazy.\u201d Peter\u2019s words were stifled by a yawn. Tony laughed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re a crazy bunch. I guess I\u2019m glad you got to meet them, though. They\u2019ll be around all the time, and maybe now they\u2019ll finally stop bugging me about you. Although, that doesn\u2019t seem super likely.\u201d Tony sighed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I met the Avengers. And hung out with the Avengers. And Ironman picked me up at school,\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cAnd I got into a fight. And I got suspended. And I have so much extra work now.\u201d He yawned again and closed his eyes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWorry about it later, kid.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes softened, and before he knew it he was running a hand through Peter\u2019s hair. But Peter just smiled and moved a little closer to him.\u00a0\n\n\nTony saw his phone light up with a text from May, and with his other hand, he opened it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNext time you pick up our delinquent because of a suspension, at least ground him to his room instead of lab time.\n\n\n\nTony laughed. Of course she would somehow know they were in the lab. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I\u2019m loving the image of Tony Stark walking into Midtown High to sign out a teenager. Very domestic of you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThanks for taking care of him.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPeter shifted a little. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re really my favorite Avenger, right?\u201d\n\n\nTony laughed lightly. He wondered at how he got to feeling so content in life. \u201cYeah, kid. I know.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe typed out a reply to May.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\n\n"
