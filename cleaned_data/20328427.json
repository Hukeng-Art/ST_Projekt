    "summary": "<p>After a bad diagnosis that paints an early death for Inko Midoriya, the kind mother does whatever she can to give Izuku a good life outside heroics. Buying a coffee shop? Check. Teaching her child how to run an analysis website? Done. Adopting a certain horned child using dubious means while ensuring they stay together? Already handled.<br>Everything she did was to help him. After all, she may believe in Izuku's dream, but no one else did.</p>\n<p>His mother passing away was a shock for Izuku. However, he has a coffee shop to manage, a website to run, and a traumatized child to raise. Heroics seems far away for the green bean, and he's accepted that. But just because he doesn't have a license, heroics runs deep in Izuku's soul, and soon he'll find that those that need a hero find him instead.</p>\n<p>Now if he could just get Aizawa to stop bugging him for analysis's during his break.</p>",
    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Yo! I was finishing up on the newest chapter of 'Kitten Quirk Freeloading' (almost done, but, I have to add some edits tonight) when I realized I could finish this chapter pretty quickly.<br>This chapter is focusing on how Izuku is growing into his own person. He's making his own allies, friends, and decisions. Will they always turn out perfect? No, but he's learning. Next chapter will focus on his digging into the League, and a dark secret he finds out about his sweet mother. Will his opinion change on her, or will he let himself see the entire story before making judgements?<br>Also... Aizawa was a main feature in this chapter! Let me know how you liked the mini game of cat and mouse the pair played.<br>Yagi Toshinori showed up, will he become a regular patron? And if so, can Izuku be the 'voice of kindness' that helps him through his troubles like with so many others?<br>Tanaka-jiji will play a semi important role in introducing a character, and he was their first customer. He's like a good family acquaintance at this point. </p>\n<p>Eri is growing up, and getting a personality. How will Izuku take it as she becomes independent now that Kai is gone and she's getting older? This is part of the goals with this fic, seeing how Izuku would handle juggling his protective streak and knowledge that Eri isn't helpless.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hitoshi showed up! Whoo, any other 1-A or other characters you want to see, let me know!<br>Have a great week!</p>\n<p>Sooo, I have a fellow author who owns a discord. They decided to let me use their server so both our sets of fans can meet in one place. Maybe one day I'll have my own server, but right now I'm too busy to manage it! You just click the link below and get the role 'The Riku' for updates on when I post, to talk, ect. I write for both Naruto and My Hero Academia (as does the other author) so you guys will have plenty to talk about and read!<br>https://discord.gg/UwKSTr<br>P.S (on of Plasma Assassin's awesome stories here)<br>https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12961436/1/Naruto-The-Devilish-Sage</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wow! That was a hard chapter, honestly. It was going one way, then I made it go another. Anyways, how was it? Doesn't the moment with Shinsou just show true friendship? No pairings in this fic, but I do appreciate friendship being shown.</p>\n<p>Eri and Izuku goes to the festival! While I probably won't write much about the festival, more about what Izuku and Eri do, as well as how they stumble across another lost soul.</p>\n<p>Nezu is interested, though right now it's bc he think the kid is a weird little fan who makes amazing tea. Will Izuku keep his interests down or will he let his job leak out?</p>\n<p>Finally, Inko. Izuku is like that kid that grows up seeing their parents doing something not completely right, and doesn't overthink it till they get older. Does Inko have ties to the LOV? Who knows! We'll find out, but Izuku is trying to put his emotions back together after seeing a man that actively tried to harm his friends (and is on his 'investigate and destroy' list) dancing with his mother. Maybe it was before villainy but he's still shocked. Talking to Shinsou helps him realize that... his mother wasn't perfect. She's human, and while she may be amazing, not everything she did would be without fault, no matter the intent or how it turns out. It makes Izuku more human, I think. </p>\n<p>Anyways, please enjoy and see you next time!</p>\n<p>Oh, and go check out 'Canary'. It's an mha fic that's amazing! You guys would probably love it, as it has a lot of growth for Izuku in it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So, I'm not overly happy with this chapter. Yes, it took a whole lot of effort and it's 'good', but... I really had to stop myself from foreshadowing too much! And being careful with Kurogiri's part... not to mention the whole Sports Festival. <br>Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed this! The chat part was probably my favorite section to write, as it was a random 2am decision on my part. School has started so updates are slower (that's what I get for applying for 2 jobs and taking 19 hours kill me.) <br>-Katsuki, Katsuki. I love his character growth in manga, so don't worry! But... he is a jerk before he and Izuku hash it out. This is my version of how that kind of 'understanding' happens.<br>-The League is moving, how will Izuku take it next chapter when a certain confession of sorts is found by our green bean? <br>-Nezu... you poor rat, you and Izuku get your tea time next chapter! I just wanted to end dramatically, chapter 5 already has about 2k words tbh. <br>Finally, if any of you are in the path of the Florida huricane, know that I'm praying for your safety. Please stay safe everyone in the path of storms. Downloading stories from AO3 will help pass the time, LIIIIKE:<br>1. Canary (amazing 'Izuku has a voice quirk with a mentor Present Mic that we didn't know we needed)<br>2. Who's kid is this (short but amazing).<br>3. Arson (just updated again and I love it- more serious but cool)<br>4. With Love Comes the Pain (Seriously, top 5 fics and it updates regularly. It even has adopted Izuku!)<br>5.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay! Phew, I cut a whoooole lot as it was rambling, and to make sure the next chapter contains the meeting with Nezu as well as what he found in that last sentence. Lots of foreshadowing.</p>\n<p>-This thing with Bakugou was planned! Promised. However, I, like many others, believe there are signs of abuse towards the annoying Pomeranian in cannon. Just looking at how he interacts with his mother after Kamino is enough. So, I fixed it. He's not redeemed, the plot won't allow it...yet. He still has to get taken out of the environment, grow, and face the wrath of the UA teachers when they catch him saying something...not nice... to Eri later on. That will be fun. Don't crucify him please. He's a minor character, but he plays a part in Izuku fully moving on from his past of bullying and in the final chapter.</p>\n<p>-Facing off against Nezu, oh my! This will be interesting, and I hope the cliffhanger was alright. I'm taking 19 hours, starting a job at both a music studio and as a private lessons teacher at a school, not to mention my other stories... so updates are erractic. Reviews revive me though! I need some ideas for where you guys would hide clues for something important. Inko has some secrets getting revealed but more are to be hidden for her little Izu-chan to find. Soooo...ideas? Please and thanks, scavenger hunts- even short and somewhat easy ones- are not my strong suit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- FINALLY! Check out these fantastic stories (and lemme know if you guys have recommendations for me to read or have enjoyed any of these stories)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Worthless Necessity (really awesome story with compelling narration and angst, as well as a cat companion!)<br> - Reflex<br>-Izuku Eats His Problems (one of my personal favorites as Izuku is a Flerkin)</p>\n<p>Have a great week guys!<br>(PS. I started another story: The Dragon Boy. It's different but expect updates on that one as well.)</p>\n<p>Discord server!:<br>https://discord.gg/ppDHQPT</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Heyo! Another chapter in our saga. First off....<br>Discord server! We finally got our own. Join for updates, spoilers, the chance to nag me, or to hang out. Everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/ppDHQPT</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Big thanks to Dragon, the amazing beta that made this possible. We had sooo many read throughs of this chapter.<br>-Nezu you rat. Of course Izu is perfect for the case. Too bad you don't know just how invested he is.<br>- Finally, changed how we were going to go about having Izuku finding his mother's past. There's still more to discover, but he already has her journal, so what now? O.o</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-p.s Go look at these stories for a good read.<br>1. Worthless Necessity<br>2. Decker (I just started reading it, Aizawa is a hoot in it.)<br>3. Hero for Heroes<br>4. Canary (I hear a new chapter is due soon and their discord is really chill)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wooh! Another chapter. How will Stain defeat Stain without...actually fighting? And what's Sho Kurogiri going to do when it finally comes out what Inko's child has been up to while he battles his own inner demons?<br>- I wrote this while sleep deprived but my awesome beta Dragon seems to think it was going alright, so please enjoy.<br>- I just started posting these stories on my ff.net account so if you prefer that interface feel free to use that site instead.<br>- Finally, only 3 (maybe 4 if I add a certain plot point) left so let's finish off strong!</p>\n<p>Finally... Discord!<br>https://discord.gg/NP5N6St</p>\n<p>Have a great week everyone,<br>Riku</p>\n<p>Please prepare pitch forks and tissues! And maybe arrange therapy?</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Sooo\u2026 how many are either a) biting their nails, b) preparing to kill me for doing that to Eri, or c) both? Seriously, me and the awesome beta, Dragon, felt horrible for doing this to Eri! Buuuuutt\u2026.<br>- What exactly does AFO want with her?<br>- What is this 'hope' mentioned at the end?<br>- Chisaki? What even?<br>- Will Izuku ever get a break? And if so, when?!<br>Seriously, I hope you enjoyed the chapter, but it's late sooo....<br>Discord!<br>https://discord.gg/k9KvXYt</p>\n<p>Annnnd... Have a great week!<br>-Riku, out.</p>\n<p>Update: I went in and...kinda figured out how to add the spaces? Hopefully, this fixes it! Again, the ending is a bit rushed... apologies! However, think of this as an opportunity to write your own ending/epilogue and have fun with it!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>End!<br>Well, that\u2019s literally the end of \u2018The Coffee Shop Hero\u2019 everyone. I am so thankful for you all and your support. This has been\u2026 a long journey despite being less than a year and only ten chapters. A couple of things:<br>1. If you have the time, let me know how you liked the series as a whole and the chapter please. I tried to make this as realistic as possible while not going straight to canon for Kamino since\u2026 well canon is boring when you have fanfiction.<br>2. Yes\u2026 I know who Kurogiri really is. But don\u2019t spoil it for others! I went with what was known when I started lol.<br>2.5 Where was Shigaraki? Well... that's for you all to ponder on!<br>3. I apologize for the long wait. The few threats I got for chapter eight kind of sucked the joy of writing this work for awhile. My beta, Dragon, was ticked at them and I couldn\u2019t agree more. But\u2026 we finished! Yay!<br>4. Sequel?<br>\u2026\u2026. Maybe? I don\u2019t know yet. Coffee Shop Hero was a beast, but rewarding. But! No matter if I upload a sequel or not, I would love to see you guys write some! Just let me know if you\u2019re going to so I can check them out and give you lots of gushes of happiness.<br>5. Finally, this chapter totaled thirteen hours of writing, plus six of when I started it before but changed some premises. I loved doing it, but now I need a nap (even though I\u2019m currently in my PJs haha).<br>Again, I am so thankful for you all, and look forward to writing more stories for you!<br>(ps. Join our discord . Shout out to Dragon my beta- may you survive this semester!)<br>https://discord.gg/MjrNGYb</p>\n<p>Heyo! I hope this intrigues all you guys! It's just an idea I had. I love fics where Izuku raises Eri, or becomes an unlikely hero. Inko in cannon intrigued me, and I wanted to write how she might react to finding out she was going to die while trying to believe in Izuku's dream. Anyways, I was inspired by a fic I read awhile ago where Izuku took out the Yakuza to save Eri and owns a shop. I can't remember the name, but it was reaaally good. However, Izuku won't be taking the Yakuza out. I could totally see the cannon pre- quirk Izuku using his abilities to lead the police to Chisaki Kai though. </p>\n<p>Finally, let me know what you think!</p>",
    "text": "\nChapter One\n\nIzuku Midoriya was always a Momma\u2019s boy. Quick to forgive her tendency to fret, and burying his disappointment that she didn\u2019t believe in his dream. He always supported her, knowing that no matter what, she was his precious mother. That\u2019s why he let himself get talked into a rather insane plan hatched by the single mother.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inko Midoriya was always cunning, willing to manipulate for the greater good. Be it when she talked her aloof husband into taking the job in America so she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with his tendency to bring shady folks over, to when she snuck in baking and cooking lessons for her son under the guise of \u2018even heroes have to cook\u2019! She remembered how she used her skills in writing to start her boy on his hobby of notating quirks, hoping it would help him in the future.\n\u00a0Being the mother of a quirkless child was hard simply because she knew the world wouldn\u2019t be kind to him. How could it, when even those with useless quirks felt the need to sneer down at those below them?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, unlike what her darling son thought, Inko didn\u2019t believe he couldn\u2019t become a hero. Quite the opposite, she knew he\u2019d excel in the field, as well as others like it. But the world would make it unimaginably difficult for him. When she cried \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, Izuku\u2019 all those years ago, it was not about his dream. No, it was about how others would tear him down for it. Inko planned to quietly sit through his childhood, letting Izuku attempt his dream. She figured after he saw how awful those in the hero world were, he\u2019d find another profession\u2026 or make it. Either way, Inko would let fate decide what Izuku did.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until her doctor\u2019s appointment a week after Izuku turned ten.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cC- cancer?\u201d Inko sputtered out, looking at the diagnosis the doctor gave her. The man gave an encouraging smile though.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, but we caught it extremely early. The treatments are pricey since chemotherapy was outlawed in the wake of quirk chemo, but it has a high chance of success.\u201d Inko\u2019s survival instincts screamed to just take it. She wasn\u2019t rich, and her health insurance was pitiful after she produced \u2018a weak child\u2019, meaning she wasn\u2019t worth as much to the insurance companies in the grand scheme of things. Why save a woman who had a weak quirk and produced a quirkless child?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow\u2026how much?\u201d She forced herself to ask. Hisashi stopped sending money a year ago, and she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was dead. It was just her and Izuku, so she had to be careful.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAbout one million yen after insurance, Mrs. Midoriya.\u201d He admitted. Inko sucked in a breath. That was the amount she had saved for Izuku\u2019s middle, high, and college funds, plus their nest egg. She couldn\u2019t steal that. But she couldn\u2019t leave Izuku either. It would destroy him, he\u2019d have no one to fall back on when she left.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, maybe, she could give him something to live for. Something better than heroics, than broken dreams and bullies she knew he faced.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow long till\u2026 till I d-d-\u2026 pass on, doctor?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBased on the diagnosis quirk and other tests, you have about four years. However, you won\u2019t show signs until the third year. The only reason we caught it was because Maiko was on duty with her quirk today. Really, it\u2019s best if we act now.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Inko said firmly. The doctor sputtered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cW- what?! You can\u2019t be serious. It\u2019s a simple procedure and thereapy, you\u2019d be healthy within six months! If it\u2019s a matter of losing your job, I\u2019m sure we could ensure time off is compensated.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, I work as an online freelance writer. No, I cannot afford the treatment. I understand my insurance would cover some sort of care at least?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d The doctor admitted, resigned. \u201cThere is a pill that would delay the symptoms from showing up\u2026 but it is not a cure. You take this and you\u2019ll just be living a lie until your body collapses.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d She insists. Another hour of back and forth between the pair and Inko Midoriya walks out with a prescription and a death wish. In her mind whirled plans and a prepared story for her darling Izuku who should be coming home from school in a couple of hours.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMom! I\u2019m home!\u201d Came Izuku\u2019s voice, making Inko stiffen in her web searching at the table, notes strewn across it. As her darling child came in, covering yet another bruise on his arm, she sighed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit, Izuku.\u201d She pointed to the chair across from her. \u201cWe\u2026need to have a family discussion.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay? What\u2019s wrong Mom?\u201d Izuku gulped when her gaze held firm, before glancing at his wrist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you like school, Izuku?\u201d She asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cW-what?!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d Inko pressed, mentally cringing at how rough she probably sounded. But for this to work, she had to make her son face his demons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d He blurted out. \u201cI mean, I like learning! It\u2019s fun and the classes are interesting. But nobody\u2026 really likes me.\u201d He mumbled the last part. Izuku wanted to lie, to placate, but found himself rambling it all out. \u201cKaachan and the other kids are mean, Mom. The teachers aren\u2019t that nice, and sometimes I can\u2019t even answer questions. It\u2019s like my throat closes up. They call me useless and\u2026\u201d Several minuets of rambled confession painted the grim reality Inko hated. Before Izuku started crying, Inko caressed his cheek.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you won\u2019t go to that school.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cB- but I have to!\u201d He insisted, unshed tears and hope on his face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, you have to go to a school; not that one. I will enroll you in an online school, where there aren\u2019t bullies.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo! Then I\u2019m running away, hiding in my room like\u2026 like a Deku\u201d He admitted. Inko gave a huff.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAbsolutely not, Izuku. You won\u2019t be \u2018hiding in your room\u2019 from the world. In fact, I\u2019d be surprised if you\u2019ll have time for much other than school and what I have planned.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh?\u201d She smirked at his puzzled face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up a coffee shop.\u201d Inko said brightly, turning Izuku\u2019s whole world upside down.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Opening a coffee shop with a ten year old wasn\u2019t easy, Inko admitted. She grew up in Tokyo with her parents, working at a coffee shop every school break to help her family, so she knew how the shop should be run. It was a tiring process. But, using the funds she saved and the numerous favors she racked up from online clients meant that soon \u2018Midoriya Coffee and Pastries\u2019 was opening its quaint doors a month before Izuku turned eleven.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome to our shop!\u201d The mother-son duo chorused from the register. The small shop with a red awning and flowers outside contained comfy chairs and six tables, all of which would be managed by Izuku or Inko at any given time. She taught him everything he needed to be a good host, how to make every drink and food article she could think of.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now it was time for him to practice it under her gaze until that inevitable day happened. Before that happened, Izuku would learn how to run the business solo. If he still wished to become a hero, she\u2019d let him. Even if he was too good for them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But first, she\u2019d show him the happiness of getting your hands dirty and befriending everyone with a smile.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, I\u2019d like a black coffee for here, please.\u201d Their first customer said quietly to the six am atmosphere. Inko smiled and rang him up while Izuku gently poured the coffee into a sturdy but elegant cup. The man thanked them and sat down at the right window table. None of the wooden tables matched, having come from pawn shops or her parent\u2019s house, but each held charm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before lunch they had over a hundred customers. Inko felt her stamina drain and stomach get queasy from her medication, but Izuku\u2019s bright smile was all the motivation she needed to push through. This was all for her child\u2019s future, after all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust a couple more years\u201d She chanted to herself while packaging up a croissant.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku was an intelligent child. His mother knew it, and he made sure to show it to her as much as possible, as it always made her smile. She never hid the reason why things happened from him, always honest.\nThat\u2019s why he found her secrecy on why they moved above a small coffee shop and opened the \u2018new family business\u2019 so strange. Surely they were happy before, as his mother didn\u2019t have to work physically hard. She seemed happy working with him every day and doing school work over the computer with him though, so he couldn\u2019t find it in him to question her. Not even when he heard her crying late at night or chugging strange pills from an unmarked bottle.\nMidoriya Coffee and Pastries opened their doors from six am to two pm. It would close, giving Izuku time to clean and do homework at a table to the smell of baking pastries. He\u2019d hum along to the soft caf\u00e9 music while his mother flitted around or collapsed into the couch by the second window. They\u2019d joke over their customers or strange assignment he had. Soon though, they\u2019d put away the computer and stretch, and opened the shop once more from four pm to nine pm.\nThey\u2019d smile and talk with people from all walks in life, serving types of coffee, tea, and deserts. Nobody could resist their Persian blend or crepes, and before long they were celebrating their first year anniversary of opening the shop. Life was good, even if he found himself sneaking in analysis still and practicing to be a hero.\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d He heard his mother murmur after the shop closed for the day. It was particularly busy in celebration. Their last customer- the same older gentleman who bought the first cup of coffee and insisted on being called \u2018Tanaka-jiji\u2019- had left almost an hour before, and everything was clean and ready for the next day.\n\u201cYes, Mom?\u201d Izuku asked.\n\u201cI saw your analysis. They\u2019ve improved.\u201d She murmured. He stiffened, hoping she didn\u2019t say he should focus more on school or work. Over the past year they hadn\u2019t talked about his dream at all, but heroes still made his day brighter, especially when one of them came in for a drink. \u201cWe both know you\u2019ll be done with middle school before August.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u201d He whispered. Finding out he\u2019d graduate secondary school at twelve was a pleasant surprise. UA and other hero programs didn\u2019t accept those younger than fourteen, so he could either take online courses till then to get ahead or wait.\n\u201cI figured, instead of doing highschool classes\u2026 you could.\u201d She stopped herself before continuing. \u201cWhy not start an analysis blog?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And with those magic words, Izuku\u2019s world got even more turned around.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In late August, \u2018Dekiru\u2019s Analysis\u2019 launched online, where a mysterious person posted analysis on quirks. Heroes, Villains, situations\u2026 he offered his unique way of looking at them from behind a computer screen. Heroes could request a complete analysis on their weaknesses and how to improve to be sent to their agencies via an untraceable postage. Izuku would laugh as he read comments on his general analysis that gave ways to improve quirks without giving away weaknesses. He also did posts on financial costs of heroism (though his mother did most of the work on those until he learned how) and editorial posts on ethics. Before long his site raked in enough for them to hire a part time worker on the weekends. While the shop covered their expenses and way of life, the site gave them a nest egg.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not a very large nest egg, but the site was still young. In time it would grow, but for now Izuku would have to put in the work, something he was used to by now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inko never let Izuku know that the site could have easily paid for her procedure. She accepted she was a dying woman, and happily listened to his ramblings on how to use the funds to expand or improve. He still wished to go to UA. If he did decide to do that, Inko knew his website would give the funds he needed to pay for all the employees he needed while at school. But, Inko had a feeling her plans would work out, and that her baby would be something better than a hero to hundreds in a cape.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thankfully, she had another, very large favor she could call in for her baby if he did decide to go down that route.\n----\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMom! We have a problem.\u201d A now thirteen year old Izuku panted from the doorway to their upper apartment. Every other Sunday and fifth Saturday the shop would close for the day. Izuku was supposed to be shopping for their specialty tea that they couldn\u2019t get from a supplier and more cleaning fluid. However, instead of bags in his arms, a small white haired girl who looked like Izuku was her whole world stood in the doorway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell\u2026 why don\u2019t we sit down and start from the beginning?\u201d She asked after they stared at one another for what seemed like a lifetime.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku never planned on picking up a four year old if he was being honest. He had dropped off another analysis for a side kick at a small time agency without being seen, and was looking forward to talking to the cute girl who ran the tea leaves shop. That\u2019s when he found his legs being held hostage. Blinking, he looked down, and was shocked to see a little girl with blue-white hair and a horn, crying.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked, crouching down to be eye level. She just buried herself into his arms. It was then Izuku really saw her. The haunted look, grimy hair, and bandaged arms. Something was wrong, really wrong. His mind raced through what he knew about the area, about how it was known for Yakuza and small crime. How it wasn\u2019t a place one went to at night.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Crap\u2019 He thought, and then gulped when a familiar looking beak popped out from across the street crowd, looking wildly. The child seemed to peek over her shoulder and cringed at the sight as well. Izuku, knowing that man from the Police\u2019s index of Yakuza members, struggled to keep a calm voice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to cover you and run. He won\u2019t get you, I\u2019ll save you.\u201d Izuku declared, feeling heroic emotions bubble up inside of him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cY-you promise?\u201d She whispered, voice not used to talking since two months ago when her quirk made her a monster.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI promise. After all, that\u2019s what heroes do: we save people.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201c..Eri.\u201d Izuku glanced up to see the bus that parked, blocking the beaked man\u2019s view of them before he could spot the pair. Taking his que, Izuku bundled up the now named Eri and bolted out of area, taking back routes and populated streets to lose any pursuers. Being an analysist, hero fanatic, and curious mind, Izuku knew the routes heroes would use to lose anyone. Thus, it took an hour of his legs and arms screaming at him, but they were safely in the apartment. When his mother had them sit down, that\u2019s when Izuku allowed his emotions to give way, his fear at what he just did becoming clear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you were taken by this \u2018Overhaul\u2019 after your quirk killed your father.\u201d Izuku repeated, no judgement in his voice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a monster\u201d Eri cried while drinking milk. She was engulfed in a hug by the two watery eyed Midoriyas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course not! You\u2019re not a monster, and neither is your quirk. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Izuku insisted. She blinked. No one had called her beautiful before. Not even before Mother left and Kai had her \u2018help\u2019 with making something to take away quirks. She hadn\u2019t meant to run today, it was an accident while following a stray cat.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grateful and not sure about the new emotions bubbling up in her chest, Eri joined the crying, only they were tears of happiness. Of belonging.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Long after Eri cried herself to sleep, now resting on their living room couch, Inko and Izuku sat at the table, having a discussion she never wanted to have.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know I used\u2026 favors\u2026 to get us the permits for the shop quickly?\u201d She spoke quietly. Izuku nodded, well aware that they were walking the legal line, but loving his Mom too much to care. \u201cWell, I always held my biggest one in reserve. It was to make your dream possible.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy\u2026 how?\u201d He asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo one would accept a quirkless hero. Not without years of discrimination against you and possibly plots to kill you.\u201d She stopped, seeing how Izuku thought she was going to say he couldn\u2019t be one. \u201cBut\u2026 I believe in you. You COULD be a hero, Izuku. I know that. You\u2019d find a way to become the best quirkless hero there is. However, right before we opened the shop, someone I helped out long ago contacted me. He\u2019s risen to power over the last two decades and let me know I could ask a favor from him. He has connections, enough to make it seem like you have a late blooming analysis quirk, or even receive one from a contact of his. I\u2026 was planning on letting you decide if you wanted me to get him to get you a fake quirk\u2026or even a real one.\u201d She let the silence ring out in the apartment. Inko knew it was always Izuku\u2019s dream. It\u2019s why she had planned on letting him get a letter in her will when he completed one semester of UA with details how to ask for such a favor. It would deal with evil men, but if Izuku really didn\u2019t want to be a coffee shop owner or online genius, she would try to let him go prepared into the world. If only the man had contacted her before her illness, or even before their opening day. Then she would have taken him up on it instantly, secure that Izuku would rise from tragedy to become a hero. Now, though, she was just so proud of how content he was, and prayed what she suggested they do with that favor instead didn\u2019t break him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf he can fake me a quirk registration or get me one\u2026 then he could create a new identity right? We could get Eri a whole new life, safe from the Yakuza. That man who had her\u2026 I barely know anything and it\u2019s from my research, but he\u2019s bad news. If your friend could make an identity that would stand up against UA\u2019s probing, we should use it\u2026 for Eri.\u201d Izuku suggested before Inko could. Without hesitation or mention of his own wishes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She had never been prouder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight, I\u2019ll call him right now then.\u201d Inko choked out. If Izuku calmly wiped away a tear and looked at his hands for a moment, neither said anything. They were the Midoriya family. They took care of their own. Eri Midoriya would soon see that.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Getting Eri Midoriya legal was difficult but Inko\u2019s friend had deep ties to the government. Eri was registered as having a \u2018unicorn\u2019 quirk with undisclosed properties. Her hair was short, dyed permantly green with white highlights from a quirk user, her eyes now a bright green that matched her brother\u2019s. She came from America after living with her father for most of her life. Hisashi died (Inko found that out recently for sure, making the story convenient), leaving poor little Eri to her mother that gave her up formally in the \u2018divorce\u2019. Eri would attend online school like Izuku until she could cope, making it easier for her to disappear into the masses away from Chisaki Kai. Of course, a few anonymous tips from a phone in \u2018Tokyo\u2019 led the investigation on him to a point his organization was being pulled apart. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the so called \u2018Eight Precepts of Death\u2019 were no more.\nInko hugged Sho for his unbreakable proof that Eri was theirs, and then cried over him when he did her dying wish that was so much simpler than her other request but just as important: Izuku was legally a complete adult now. The government classified quirkless people as adults at thirteen as long as they had a steady income. So, Izuku was safe. But, Sho got them the permit that most couldn\u2019t get until they were seventeen, allowing him to be a guardian for children. This included biological siblings or fostering. Now, Inko could die happy knowing her two children would be secure and safe.\nEven if Izuku did become a hero, Inko knew it would some how work out. That\u2019s why when she went to her parent\u2019s house for the weekend before they went into a nursing home in May before Izuku\u2019s fourteenth birthday, she didn\u2019t fight the feeling of death that crept up on her as she fell asleep. Her parents disowned her before her nineteenth birthday for getting pregnant and they would not have custody of her children, but Inko was grateful that they got to reconcile the night before she passed, and that they found her body instead of her sweet angels.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Burying his mother with a sobbing Eri at his side was the worst day of Izuku\u2019s life. The relatives and friends that came were few as Inko had gradually pulled away from them in the last four years in light of what he now knew was her sickness. Everything clicked into place for him, all the way back to the last doctor\u2019s appointment she had. Izuku felt so stupid, wanted to scream, but he held it back. Nobody but him and the doctor that quietly showed up knew about it, and that\u2019s how it would stay. Everyone else thought it was a sudden heart failure.\nMany gossiped when they saw Eri. They speculated Inko left to hide a pregnancy, that she gave up the child to open a shop before then being forced to take care of a little girl again and the \u2018burdensome quirkless child\u2019. They blamed him. Izuku let it wash over him. When it was time for him to greet those that gossiped behind his back, Izuku did what he did best.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He smiled and bowed, like the most excellent coffee shop owner that he was. Eri copied him, and soon the siblings were back in their apartment, crying over the will \u00a0Inko left for them, the man who read it to them in his office offering no sympathies.\nJuly fifteenth passed with little fanfare, though Eri sang him the happy birthday song they had sung to her, holding out a bowl of Katsudon their mother taught her to make. Izuku dove into his analysis as well as the shop, making enough for them to live off of. The part timer that he hired quit after they got into UA, leaving with a cheesy grin and head pat to Eri.\n\u201cBoss, you were so manly! Thanks for letting me work to help save for my dream!\u201d Kirishima cheered. The now red head (and how Izuku almost tossed a frying pan at him when he saw it at six am, convinced it was some sort of monster) left, promising to visit. Izuku didn\u2019t say anything about how he wished he was going to. Eri hugged him, thinking he was worried about finding another worker that they could trust. He couldn\u2019t correct her, knowing he had decided to not mention his dream since he saved her.\nThat night he took Eri home from the funeral, Izuku left his childhood behind. He was now the caretaker of an amazing little girl. A little girl that needed stability and safety, not a brother who went after an almost impossible dream.\n\u201cHey Eri, how would you like us to close early and watch a movie?\u201d Izuku asked, grinning when she positively beamed at him.\n----\n\u201cWelcome! What can I get you sir?\u201d Izuku chirped at six am on a rather slow Monday. The gruff man that entered the caf\u00e9 seemed dead to the world, slouching as he walked up, white scarf hiding his neck.\n\u201cCoffee. Black as my soul to go\u201d He groused. Amused, Izuku filled up the standard cup, knowing that it probably irritated their customer that someone was so awake at the \u2018ungodly hour\u2019. Eri peeped out from the counter to look at him, her hair a mess waiting to be tamed by Izuku. At least she was in her work uniform.\n\u201cHere you go, Sir!\u201d Izuku handed the coffee as money was passed to him. The man raised an eyebrow when Eri padded up to him and gave him a bag of cookies. She had one free bag to hand out to a customer per day. Usually she waited till their evening session, but Izuku couldn\u2019t help but think she chose right that day.\n\u201c\u2026Thanks.\u201d The customer said in puzzlement. He started walking out.\n\u201cOh, and Eraserhead?\u201d Izuku called idly to the now frozen back. \u201cYou might want to try dipping the cookies in the coffee; it\u2019s rather good.\u201d\nWithout a word, Aizawa walked out of the quaint coffee shop Nemuri sometimes went to, interest piqued. He\u2019d be sure to visit again.\nOnly for the cookies, Of course.\n\u00a0\nIzuku watched the man walk away, hiding a snicker. Eri looked him a bit cross eyed.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Eraserhead, Nii-san?\u201d She asked, used to her brother rambling about heroes since he did some kind of secret online job. She wasn\u2019t allowed to tell anyone about it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a really cool hero, Eri. One day I\u2019ll tell you about him. For now, grab a brush before Tanaka-jiji shows up for his order.\u201d With a fond smile, Izuku helped Eri get twin braids, refusing to let his smile turn sad.\nAfter all, it wouldn\u2019t do to dwell on the man that theoretically could have been his teacher at UA. He got over Midnight, he\u2019d get over this one. Even if it hurt.\n\u201cThere, all done!\u201d\n\u201cHehe, let\u2019s make customers happy!\u201d Eri squealed.\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s make them happy. Always.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTwo\u201d Izuku called as he measured out the grounds for the coffee brewer. It was three thirty, meaning soon they\u2019d be seeing customers again. Eri was sweeping the last crumbs into the trash.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFour!\u201d She chirped back. They were going over multiples in math and her online kindergarten had a test the next day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSix\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEight.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSixty-four\u201d Izuku threw in randomly, seeing if he could trip her up. Eri just smirked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSixty-six, Nii-san!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy, at this rate you\u2019ll be better at math than me! And then you won\u2019t need your poor old Nii-san anymore.\u201d Izuku faked a horrified gasp at the thought.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry Nii-san! I\u2019ll always need you, and I\u2019ll stay here forever and ever!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou mean it? You\u2019ll stay with your lame brother?\u201d Izuku asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh huh. After all, somebody has to look after you in your old age.\u201d She said cheekily, ruining the moment. That was one thing Eri was beginning to pick up from their more \u2018trendy\u2019 customers (read: hooligan teens in Izuku\u2019s opinion), sass. Thankfully she still had her sweet moments, such when she proceeded to tackle Izuku in a hug as he walked to switch their sign to \u2018open\u2019 once more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay Princess Unicorn, enough; we have customers to please.\u201d And sure enough, the hugging siblings were greeted by the scruffy visage of Aizawa, back for more coffee from the morning. He raised an eye brow at the two.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMore coffee, please.\u201d Aizawa said after a moment.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shouta had been enjoying his coffee and cookies (and how did they taste so good, normally he hated sweets because they were a waste of time) in the teacher\u2019s lounge. Technically classes wouldn\u2019t start till next week, but staff had a week of meetings and preparations. So here he was, feeling alive for once, and all because of Midoriya Coffee and Pastries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What really got him though, was the casual note from the boy running the counter about his hero identity. Most didn\u2019t know who he was- or cared- because that\u2019s how he liked it. Already the man combed through the student profiles to see any matching his description (that would at least give some excuse for the recognition seeing as Aizawa helped run the exams) to no avail. Perhaps the boy had a sibling in the school? Though, Aizawa also wondered about the kid, as he seemed more comfortable than the average worker. Perhaps the owner\u2019s son? That\u2019s how Nemuri found him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy, my, Shouta, I see you\u2019ve tried some of Izuku-kun\u2019s coffee. And are those Eri-chan\u2019s cookies!\u201d Nemuri squealed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo that\u2019s their names. They looked like siblings, does their family own the shop?\u201d He asked. Nemuri seemed to somber up, if only for a moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh. That. Well actually Izuku\u2019s the owner. His mother passed away a few months ago, so now it\u2019s just him and his little sister. She\u2019s around five I think.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait, how old is he? He looked young, and you can\u2019t own a business before you\u2019re sixteen in Japan.\u201d Aizawa pointed out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHeh, well he\u2019s fourteen. Normally you\u2019d be right, but\u2026\u201d Nemuri trailed off. Aizawa raised an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s quirkless.\u201d Silence loomed uncomfortably between the two before Aizawa snorted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course those stupid laws would make it possible. Glad to see they\u2019re doing something right. I assume he somehow got the permit to raise his sister as well seeing as she lives there.\u201d Nemuri shrugged. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t answer how he recognized my hero persona of all people.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIzu-kun does something with analysis. I\u2019ve walked in on him after their afternoon closedown to see him muttering about a hero or whatever. He always put his notes away before I could see though, it must be his embarrassing hobby. They\u2019re very detailed mutterings too.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That sparked suspicion in Aizawa\u2019s mind. What teenager- a non heroics one at that- want with such detailed information? It sounded like the boy wasn\u2019t going on to do anything but make coffee. Mind made up, Shouta Aizawa went from \u2018I\u2019ll casually visit to figure this puzzle out\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019m officially stalking the possible villain informant\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s how he ended up at Midoriya Coffee and Pastries just as it opened, staring at the (admittedly) cute duo greeted him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMore coffee, please.\u201d He finally said.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Watching as Eraserhead- Shouta Aizawa, the man insisted after Eri started chatting to him- drank his third cup of coffee while munching on more cookies, staring at Izuku the whole time unsettled the young business owner.\nWhat could Aizawa want, Izuku wondered. While they did have some customers take up a table for long stretches of time while working on projects or waiting for bad weather to pass, but Aizawa sat facing him without any work in front of him, and it was a brisk but beautiful late September day; there was no reason for him to be here.\nOf course, Izuku didn\u2019t dare say anything. He was too good of a host for that, and Eri seemed to like him. Despite being young, her experiences made her an excellent judge of character. Though\u2026 If Aizawa was plotting something bad, Izuku would ruin him like he ruined Chisaki Kai.\nWatching that arrest on the nightly news three weeks ago was a highlight of his life; he still had it recorded for particular bad days.\nFinally, after the gruff man consumed five cups, he came up to Izuku once more.\n\u201cRestroom\u201d He demanded (?), making Izuku\u2019s smile slightly twitch. The only one they had was in the apartment, seeing as most customers didn\u2019t stay long enough to need to relieve themselves. Izuku was about to suggest going to their neighbor, a rather nice small grocer who had a customer restroom, when Eri- bless her heart but sometimes he wondered what went through her head- piped up.\n\u201cAizawa-san! You can use ours! And I can show you my stuffed animal collection.\u201d She dragged Aizawa away before Izuku could protest, though he did call out to them a warning.\n\u201cTen minutes Eri; one second longer and I\u2019ll drag you both down myself!\u201d Her disbelieved giggle ruined the image. Thankfully his security camera installed on his laptop on the table would give him plenty of a vantage point to keep watch. He wouldn\u2019t want the man to start snooping through his files or his mother\u2019s things. Hopefully Eri would distract him the entire time with her dozens of stuffed animals on the couch (curtesy of Izuku; he couldn\u2019t resist buying her a new one each time they went shopping. It was now a sort of tradition between the two.) for him to get too curious.\nAizawa felt awkward as he washed his hands in the animal themed restroom, and shivered as his hands dried on a unicorn hand towel. Eri had proudly told him Izuku let her redecorate it in June. As he looked around the cozy kitchenette and living room (why was the brown couch covered in animals that seemed to pierce your soul again), the Pro hero gained one key insight on the target of his mini investigation: the kid was wrapped around his little sister\u2019s thumb. A nice laptop sat on the table, with papers for elementary students piled close. However, under the laptop sat notebooks, one open and showing a detailed report on Midnight\u2019s quirk.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh that\u2019s Nii-san\u2019s work!\u201d Eri piped up. Aizawa shot his head to meet her eyes. She eeped and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret though, something online. You can\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Okay, sure. Let\u2019s get you back down, alright?\u201d He asked, letting the five year old skip down the stairs, happily telling him about how her elephant animal didn\u2019t get along with her cat one, so she had to keep them \u2018suuuper far apart\u2019 or something. God, was Aizawa glad he didn\u2019t have kids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku met his even gaze, nodding goodbye when Aizawa shuffled out the door. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that letting Eri be the one to take him upstairs would lead to a headache.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, though, he had to focus on thinking up ways for Midnight to improve her quirk; he had to drop off the analysis this weekend.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The week was a rather\u2026 intense one for Shouta. He was convinced that Midoriya was a puzzle he wished to solve, and some signs pointed to him being involved with something shady (he left late at night sometimes with files, losing Aizawa of all people in the alleyways) and returned later empty handed. He would mutter about a hero, villain, or random quirk- hell, yesterday Aizawa heard him rant to himself about traffic patterns in high villain areas of all things- in details only seen in professionals like Dekiru or Nezu. However, the kid was kind, polite, and always helped others. In his investigation (read: mini stalking) Izuku had helped five children find their parents, six elderly carry groceries, and gave a full meal to a homeless man that collapsed outside the shop. With every person he came across, Izuku was extremely nice, making Shouta Aizawa want to pull his hair out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFINALLY IT CAME!\u201d Nemuri squealed when she burst into the lounge, clutching a blank, thick file\u2026 that looked suspiciously like Izuku\u2019s.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Hizashi asked, already hyped about it being the first day, now reaching bursting levels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis! I commissioned Dekiru to make an analysis for me. He dropped it off at the agency this weekend- of course, no one saw him as usual- so I just picked it up on my way here. Look! So detailed. And the artwork detailing some costume redesigns are on point.\u201d That\u2019s when she flipped open the file on the table. Most of the teachers just marveled at the details.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aizawa did a spit take on his life drink, knowing where he saw that particular page.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Shouta? You okay?\u201d Hizashi questioned while patting his best friend\u2019s back. Aizawa nodded and stood abruptly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, just a break in a case I was working on came to me. I\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d With that, Shouta left in a brisk walk, barely bothering to drag his sleeping bag with him.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku was more amused than anything for the week Aizawa stalked him. One doesn\u2019t avoid bullies, give detailed analysis, and protect a five year old without getting impressive observation and stealth skills. When Eri gave a tearful confession that she admitted the files were \u2018secret\u2019 to Aizawa, Izuku had just sighed shook his head, already knowing from the camera. It was hilarious though when the man started stalking him, and Izuku made sure to become shadier looking when he left to do his drops; he had to get entertainment somehow, and the man did bring it on himself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So when Aizawa came in looking like death run over yet triumphant after the first day of school (Kirishima was already planning on coming for dinner to celebrate), Izuku kept his face impassive. The shop was empty due to a villain attack at the station earlier, making many people hurry home while clean up ensued. Even Tanaka-jiji called to say he wouldn\u2019t be in at six pm for his herbal tea.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou. You\u2019re Dekiru.\u201d Aizawa pointed an accusatory finger at him. Izuku gave a closed eye smile and held up an already made cup.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCoffee, Aizawa-san?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProblem child\u2026\u201d The source of Izuku\u2019s headache and fun said once they were sat. Outside it began pouring, and Izuku sent Eri up to get ahead on school and play. She didn\u2019t try to convince him to let her stay after he gave her the look. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Shouta-san? I can call you that, yes? I mean, after you stalked me for a week, I think I feel familiar enough with you for first names.\u201d A hidden smile behind his coffee. Izuku could feel Aizawa\u2019s irritation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou knew.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course, Shouta-san. You know a secret of mine. One that cannot get out. One that would endanger Eri and our livelihood if some\u2026 shadier persons figured out \u2018Dekiru\u2019 was just a simple shop owner without a quirk.\u201d The silence loomed. Izuku loved playing this tactic, it was one he\u2019d seen his mother use when a client found out something they shouldn\u2019t have or somebody questioned her. Shouta instinctively looked away from Izuku\u2019s now sharp eyes. \u201cSo, now that you know about my side business, what will you do?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026I want to help.\u201d That made Izuku drop his cup in shock, and from Shouta\u2019s look, he wasn\u2019t expecting to say it either.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cExcuse me?\u201d The man sighed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIzuku- no, Problem Child- you\u2019re smart, scary so. Your blog and paid analysis are second to none. But, you\u2019re fourteen, and running a shop. You\u2019re untrained in fighting and if the wrong person happened to spot you on your late night drop offs, you\u2019d be an easy target.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo, what could you do?\u201d Izuku asked, interested despite himself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll be the one to drop them off. It would create a bumper between you and any potential enemies.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what do you want in return? These deliveries are sensitive, and must never be caught.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnalyze my class\u2019s quirks\u2026and a free cup of coffee every morning.\u201d He admitted the last part was his favorite. Shouta Aizawa loved coffee, and the shop\u2019s coffee was worth living for.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku sat back, contemplating. On one hand, he liked the late night exhibitions, and the day time ones brought him a thrill. But, Eri shouldn\u2019t be left alone at night, and his breaks taking the files were often rushed and could be spent helping Eri or going to the park with her. Nodding to himself, he produced a file from seemingly nowhere and passed it to his now \u2018partner\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well; this is supposed to be delivered to the Present Mic agency, for one of the newer sidekicks. Could you do this without being caught?\u201d A manic grin met his small smile.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not known as a \u2018demon in the night\u2019 by friends for nothing, Problem Child.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen don\u2019t do things that get my interest.\u201d Aizawa shot back. The two shared a small chuckle when the bell rang. Izuku looked up to see Kirishima dragging in a soaked Purple haired boy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYo, boss! Sorry, I know dinner isn\u2019t till nine because of closing and stuff, but I ran into this super manly kid on my way out of U.A- and he\u2019s in my class! He\u2019d be perfect for the shop, and his hair is manly wicked.\u201d Kirishima boasted, knocking down the boy in the UA uniform with a \u2018pat\u2019 on the back. Izuku resisted a snort and stood up to bow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome, I apologize for my former employee. He knows we\u2019re in need of a weekend part timer, and is\u2026 very enthusiastic about helping. My name is Izuku Midoriya, pleased to meet you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Hitoshi Shinsou. Likewise.\u201d The boy about his age muttered and looked to the side, eyes widening at seeing one of his teachers here. Kirishima, however, was not observant enough and kept talking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo yeah, today we had our first day boss, and we had this really manly teacher! He was kind of unmanly at the beginning, trying to scare us with a \u2018quirk test\u2019 and said the lowest score would lose. However, The purple midget that came in last still got to stay! So, I guess Aizawa-sensei isn\u2019t too bad, but I think he needs more sleep; I\u2019ve seen zombies with less bags.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGlad to see my sleep schedule amuses you, Kirishima\u201d Aizawa quips from his position, somehow commanding authority instantly. Kirishima yelp and turned redder than his hair, while Shinsou looked half terrified, half amused.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA- Aizawa-sensei! I didn\u2019t know you c-came here!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell the coffee is rather good.\u201d Was all Aizawa said before continuing his peaceful drinking.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the end, Shinsou did agree to work at the shop every Saturday and Sunday, as well as school holidays. He seemed to be in disbelief that Izuku and Eri weren\u2019t freaked out about his quirk. In fact, Izuku was amazed about it and insisted he\u2019d be a fantastic hero.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shinsou would never admit that made him tear up so much that Eri hugged him. Or that Aizawa had to pass a handkerchief. Or admit that when Izuku insisted he stay for dinner since the storm was still going, Shinsou felt true happiness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018He\u2019s really my hero\u2019 The purple boy thought while laughing on his first day of work that weekend, conversing with customers who never once questioned or judged him. When they heard he was going to be a hero, a kid even asked for his autograph \u2018for when he gets famous and forgets the little people\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, his boss was a strange one, but kinder than any other he met. From the way he treated everyone like they were the center of his attention, to the way he could hold intelligent conversations on any topic despite not doing high school (though when Izuku admitted he graduated middle school at twelve, Hitoshi had to keep his jaw from hitting the floor), Izuku Midoriya was what any person would expect to see in a decent human being and hero.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Too bad the kid shot him down the one time he suggested he\u2019d make a great one, sad smile on his face. The worker never asked again, knowing there was a private demon there.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku stretched in the dark Monday air, two weeks after Shinsou started. He finally had a proper hand again, and Eri seemed to like him. Now though, he had to open the store. Cracking his back, he muttered while walking down the steps.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy back.\u201d Then shut up, realizing how old he sounded, and vowed to never let another soul hear him say that. He was fourteen, not some grandfather, despite what his customers seemed to think at times!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of customers, Izuku was worried about Aizawa. His class had gotten attacked by villains on Thursday, leaving the school to close while repairs and rest happened. The man sent a text Saturday saying he was alive, though Izuku was still worried. The news only spoke of there being injuries, and with the current climate, Izuku was unable to dig up any information on his elusive customer/helper. Even Shinsou just knew the man was gravely injured and in the hospital. However, Izuku was drawn out of his musings and half baked plans to hack into every hospital database to find him, when the door swung open\u2026to a mummy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh\u2026 welcome?\u201d Izuku asked rather than stated. The mummy seemed to groan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProblem Child.\u201d And instantly it clicked. This was Shouta Aizawa.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShouta-san\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCoffee.\u201d The mummy demanded while walking up. Only to be pulled back by a familiar head of blonde hair.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShouta! You can\u2019t just leave the hospital, walk twenty blocks, and come in for coffee! You\u2019re not even supposed to be walking, much less drinking caffeine with your medication.\u201d The voice of Present Mic chided. This seemed to upset Mumzawa.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHizashi, I swear to God, let me get my coffee. I have class in two hours\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat you\u2019re not going to! We can get a sub, you should go rest.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t, my students need to see that I\u2019m alright.\u201d Mumzawa growled. Before it could turn into a war zone, Izuku cleared his throat.\n\u201cI apologize, Present Mic sir, but your voice is getting rather loud. My neighbors wouldn\u2019t appreciate the noise disturbance.\u201d Izuku gently chided. Aizawa seemed to radiate smugness while Hizashi looked like someone kicked his puppy.\nUntil he got a look at Izuku.\n\u201cOH MY GOODNESS! You\u2019re the little listener Nemuri keeps talking about! Izuku, right? You\u2019re even cuter in person than the pictures!\u201d Izuku was put into a hug from across the counter, wondering what his life had turned into.\n\u201cP-pictures?!\u201d He gasped, stuttering due to lack of air. Hizashi clamped up at that and chuckled nervously. While he was distracted, Izuku passed Mumzawa his coffee, nodding as the man silently swayed out the shop and toward school, not bothering to say that he gave him decaf just in case it did interfere with his \u2018medication\u2019. Once he was gone, Izuku turned his gaze to the still nervous blonde man.\n\u201cSo. Would you mind telling me what exactly got him so injured?\u201d With a baited breath, Izuku waited to see if he could be told. Hizashi paused, then nodded, talking quieter.\n\u201cWell, it began on a field trip, as you know\u2026\u201d\n----\nThe whole day was rather sullen for Izuku after that revelation. Though not getting the full story, he got enough to piece it together.\nAnd enough to research this so called \u2018League of Villains\u2019 and \u2018Tomura Shigaraki\u2019. \u00a0Eri noticed his dark mood and made sure to give him an extra hug, thinking it was her fault somehow. The two ate a special lunch to reassure her, and by the time six pm came around, life was back in Izuku\u2019s face.\nNot that the customers were ever let onto Izuku\u2019s mood earlier; he was too professional to let it be that obvious.\nWhen the door opened and a large group entered the caf\u00e9 right after six, Izuku expected teens or college students.\nNot a fair chunk of UA\u2019s teaching staff (and some gaunt man with clothes six sizes too large for him), led by a gushing Present Mic and Midnight while they passed their phones showing a picture of what looked like him and Eri when she made them matching cat ears for online art. Izuku, so happy, agreed to wear them for an entire week. Much to his chagrin, Midnight must have taken the opportunity to snap incriminating evidence.\n\u201cWelcome to our shop, how may we serve you?\u201d He asked, instead of the millions of other questions swirling through his head.\n\u201cHoly mackeral Nemuri, you\u2019re right: he is like an old grandfather or host!\u201d A man Izuku knew as Vlad King from his analysis stage whispered. Izuku withheld an eye twitch while Eri came in from the kitchen with more bags of cookies and some muffins.\n\u201cNii-san! Look, I made some new muffins all on my own!\u201d She boasted. When she saw the frozen group at the door, she smiled and bowed. \u201cWelcome to our shop!\u201d\nIt took five minutes to get the group coherent enough to sit down and order. Pretty soon, Aizawa was sleeping on the couch while the rest crammed around tables, enjoying the sweets and coffee. Using the basic sign language he taught Eri, Izuku had the girl go grab one of his mother\u2019s crocheted blankets and drape it over the injured man. Next she managed to put her Unicorn themed noise canceling headphones that played a soft music. Izuku figured the man could just crash there if he didn\u2019t wake up on time; it was the least he could do, as a good business owner.\n\u201cMidoriya-san, your tea is excellent! Nezu would be proud\u201d Exoplasm praised, mentioning the tea loving principal of UA. Izuku hid a blush, and just gave a refill.\nThe next three hours was spent answering silly questions, mediating a fight between Nemuri and Hizashi about which coffee was better, and snapping a pic of Eri drifting off to sleep in the corner of couch by Aizawa\u2019s head. Normally she would head off to bed at eight thirty, and now it was past nine. In fact, it was past closing time, Izuku noted in apology to his customers.\nWith whispered thanks, the patrons left, a mix between pro heroes and regular patrons. Tanaka-jiji, normally never there till closing, lingered in front of his mother\u2019s picture on the wall. It was from their opening day at dawn, mother and son sporting wide grins.\n\u201cYou know, Izuku-kun,\u201d The man said while stopping at the door, \u201cEven though the lovely Inko-san has left the world, you and your kind smile makes sure she never left the shop. She\u2019s so proud of you, I just know it.\u201d\nWith that farewell, the man went out in the night, leaving Izuku with an empty shop save for a slumbering Shouta Aizawa and drooling Eri. Giving a contented sigh, Izuku began the long process of cleanup.\n\nChapter 3\n\nShouta Aizawa rarely woke up relaxed, used to nightmares from his more difficult cases. That intensified after the USJ, and Shouta was sure it\u2019d take weeks for his nerves to settle. Screams of his students, cracking bones, and darkness made the cacophony of his dreams.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So imagine dreaming of nothing but green fields, coffee, and\u2026unicorns? Yes, there was definitely a high-pitched voice singing about a friendly unicorn somewhere. Opening one eye, Shouta found himself not in his apartment (or a demented cartoon judging by the still singing voice) but in the dim coffee shop, Izuku busy brewing coffee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUrgh\u201d Shouta managed, realizing he was wrapped up in a rather well-crafted crocheted blanket, and a weird weight was on his head. He tried to move, but bandages prevented it. Still, that horrid voice kept singing. Izuku looked up, noticed his predicament, and walked over, smiling. Before long he felt the weight taken off, and the world became quiet again.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, there you are, Shouta-san! You slept a good twelve hours, I was just about to open shop. Eri should be down soon, you should thank her; not just anyone is allowed to use her headphones.\u201d Izuku held up the offending things, drawing a groan from the older man. However, it was a short lived one as he was given coffee and a piece of toast. Izuku just smiled as his guest got up, folding the blanket lovingly. Eri bounded down the stairs, squealing when she saw the scene.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNii-san! Shouta-san! Good morning\u201d She chirped. Izuku snorted when he saw her hair, once again growing out, sticking up everywhere.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEri, Eri, come here you wild child. You can\u2019t greet our customers like this.\u201d He tsked and started the long process of brushing and braiding her hair. When he heard a snicker he sent a baleful look at the couch. \u201cRemember whose couch you slept on for free.\u201d He reminded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProblem Child\u201d Shouta seemed to accuse. It wasn\u2019t his fault his friends left him, or that Eri put those cursed headphones on him. Seriously, did Problem Child coordinate all her possessions to be annoyingly adorable?\n\u201cYes, Shouta-san? You have class in two hours, you should get going.\u201d The door chimed, cutting their conversation off, and in walked Tanaka-jiji. \u201cWelcome! Your usual I presume?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, young Izuku! Yes, dark roast with two sugars as always.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shouta slipped out silently as more customers funneled in, Eri waving bye.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Days pass, and with it Izuku notes the upcoming sports\u2019 festival. In past years he would bring the television downstairs and have it play for the shop. Customers would flock that day, and it was always fun to serve specialty treats in celebration. Eri spent the entire time last year jumping around like a rabbit when they watched some second year- Mirio Togato, Izuku recalled- blast away the competition. That was until the idiot lost control of his quirk and subsequently his pants right as Eri looked over.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku had to resist flaming the UA student to oblivion on his blog for it, though he was grateful the \u2018pant less wonder\u2019 never showed up at his shop.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if Eri insisted on meeting him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEri, what are you doing?\u201d He asked a week before the festival as his kid sister had an entire table overrun with paper and colors. It was break so he didn\u2019t mind the mess, but her artistic tastes tended to leave a lot of\u2026 interesting messes.\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m making Kirishima-san and Toshi-san some cards, to tell them to \u2018do their best\u2019 and win the festival!\u201d She said seriously. Izuku quirked a brow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally? But only one can win the festival.\u201d That stopped her. She scrunched her face up for a few moments. Then, she grinned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell the festival to let there be two winners.\u201d Eri decided.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEr\u2026 Eri, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd why not?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBecause that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBecause there can\u2019t be more than one first place.\u201d His patience was being tested.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBecause, Eri\u2026 you know what, never mind. Talk to Shouta-san when he comes with the others tonight; maybe he\u2019ll change the rules.\u201d Izuku gave in finally, not wanting to have an argument. Eri hummed happily and resumed her work. With a soft smile, Izuku turned back to his personal project: the League of Villains.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So far, Izuku had created an analysis of their quirks, phycological profiles, and the beginnings of possible areas their base of operations could be. However, the supposed \u2018leader\u2019, Shigaraki Tomura, bugged him. The man clearly didn\u2019t have enough charm to actually be the leader, and he was so obviously a puppet. So then why was whoever was actually in charge allowing a\u2026loser, to be honest\u2026 run the organization? Something didn\u2019t add up, and it was driving Izuku\u2019s need for answers up the wall.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The rest of the afternoon is spent giving service to their few customers and watching Eri continue her efforts. By the time six came around, she had made cards for the teachers as well. Secretly Izuku sighed, knowing all the glitter she added would be a pain to clean that evening, but unable to bring himself to make her stop. Customers loved watching the bright child create in a corner table, so who was he to stop her on a slow day?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYo listeners! We need some serious caffeine and treats!\u201d A familiar mop of blond hair shrieked. Most of the usual crowd (does coming twice as a group count as usual, Izuku mused) sauntered in with tired smiles from preparing for the next week. Mumzawa grumbled as he came in, still looking like he belonged in a tomb despite the obvious improvements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cProblem Child.\u201d Shouta greeted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not a child Shouta-san, I do own a business.\u201d Izuku deadpanned while carrying a tray filled with cups of coffee and tea. The tables were filled, though Snipe seemed a bit weirded out by the glitter on Eri\u2019s former base. Thankfully she was upstairs washing her hair after paint got in it somehow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDespite those stupid laws, you\u2019re still a child to me.\u201d Shouta shot back while lifting his cup.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThose \u2018stupid laws\u2019 let you get the best coffee in this city every morning.\u201d The green genius pointed out. Nemuri chimed in.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but Izu-kun, don\u2019t you want a normal teenaged life? You know, high school and girls?\u201d She teased. Cementose slapped a hand over his mouth; it wasn\u2019t a secret amongst the staff that Midnight thought she should get Izuku a girlfriend from UA before he turned into a prude\u2026 well more than he already was. Present Mic had heard from Eri that he was still griping about the Mirio boy and his birthday suit mishap.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 haven\u2019t been in a physical school since I was ten. School\u2026 wasn\u2019t the kindest place for me.\u201d Izuku admitted. A blind man Izuku was used to came in, eagerly accepting his to go order of cookies and Jasmine tea, leaving in the time it took the UA staff to gather their thoughts. They didn\u2019t seem to want to address the elephant in the room so instead Midnight pointed to the laptop resting on a shelf by the register.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey, you don\u2019t normally have that thing here. Are you doing another one of your \u2018secret projects?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone perked up at that. Through their various solo and group visits, they all found something that really made them curious about Midoriya: his projects. Mutterings, whispers about heroes, or villains.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPerhaps\u201d He said with the same cryptic smile he always had.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018What a cryptic basterd\u2019 Several staff thought, just wanting to know what even went on in his head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYOU\u2019RE HERE!\u201d An adorable squeal said from the door to the back and rushed Present Mic, hugging him. Somehow, he had become her unofficial favorite, and Izuku doubted it had to do with the merch he\u2019d sneak her. In her hand was the messy pile of cards.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s this little listener?\u201d Hizashi asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA gift! For all of you!\u201d She passed each of the heroes a personalized card, much to their delight. She even had one for Yagi-san, who could only sip on some light tea as he coughed up blood. It didn\u2019t deter the child, however, and she smiled at him all the same. It made him proud, knowing his sister could look past the outside scars to see the beauty of a person.\n\u00a0While they gushed over them (were those rocks glued to Cementos\u2019s card?) Izuku turned his attention to a sullen looking man in his thirties, nursing a cup at a table.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, they say that stewing over a problem on an empty stomach just makes it worse.\u201d Izuku pondered quietly and set down a croissant stuffed with turkey in front of the coffee. The man looked up, slightly puffy eyes and rumpled business jacket.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI- I can\u2019t accept. I mean, I can\u2019t pay for this\u201d He insisted with a sniffle. Izuku only smiled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn the house. I find just letting good food do its work makes things easier to face.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 I lost my job six months ago. But, I couldn\u2019t tell my wife, we have three children! So\u2026 I\u2019ve been trying to find work anywhere before our savings run out, but no one wants to hire a quirkless man with a degree in fashion. A useless skill.\u201d He said dejectedly, and Izuku felt for him. \u201cTruthfully, I can\u2019t even pay for this coffee, I just stumbled in after I failed\u2026 again.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell maybe life will start to look up soon? Who knows, maybe tonight you\u2019ll get a job offer, or something will fall into your lap.\u201d The greenette said with a wink, ignoring the scoff from the man. \u201cEither way, enjoy the coffee- on the house as well- before you leave.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d The bewildered man finally muttered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No one but Shouta noticed Izuku slip out, everyone- including the few regulars- absorbed in their drinks and company. He went through the back way that connected him to the tailor\u2019s shop three stores down. Knocking on the entrance to the store\u2019s back room, knowing Kurama-san would still be working, Izuku smiled as the slightly annoyed man answered the door.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you want, Midoriya?\u201d He grouched, though to be fair he was like that with everyone. Ever since his wife died years ago, the man worked to the bone alone, as most didn\u2019t want to be under a man who could snip you with his scissor fingers (rumors were they could go through steel).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI need a favor.\u201d Izuku said bluntly. \u201cA certain man in a rough place needs a job, and\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d Lee cut him off.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe has a degree in fashion\u201d Izuku continued like the interruption didn\u2019t happen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo? Some goody two-shoes fashion hot shot?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo\u2026 He\u2019s quirkless.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd? Why does that matter?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe has three kids at home and they\u2019re desperate, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d work very hard.\u201d Izuku promised. Lee seemed to contemplate it before shaking his head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my time paying somebody who has to be taught the ways of MY store\u2019s style, nor care for sob stories. Find someone else.\u201d This caused Izuku to clench his fists, but he still pulled out the envelope that normally rested in a secure safe.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere is three months\u2019 wages for him. Pay him off of this, so you get free labor essentially. If he doesn\u2019t perform after that time or if he\u2019s scared of your quirk, you can fire him. Just\u2026 give him a chance. This could be his only hope.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2026Argh fine! You annoying Midoriyas, never know when to keep to your business!\u201d Lee threw his hands in the air and grabbed the thick envelope. \u201cYou going to introduce us?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust look for a rumpled suit and tired brown eyes coming out of my shop soon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name at least?\u201d\n\u201cNot a clue,\u201d Izuku admitted with a shrug. \u201cOh, and Lee-san?\u201d Shiny yet poisonous green eyes met wrinkled grey ones.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, pest?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t tell him about this conversation.\u201d The air grew thick, before suddenly breaking with Izuku\u2019s smile. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cY-yeah. Alright.\u201d Never would Lee admit those eyes terrified him since Inko Midoriya \u2018discussed\u2019 him not smoking in the shop years ago and forced him to become clean.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arriving back to the shop to hear Present Mic fail at singing the US National Anthem to Eri, everyone else covering their ears, Izuku slipped in unnoticed, waving a goodbye to the still dejected man. He hoped his life turned out well and that one day he\u2019d be able to drink the Midoriya coffee with happy eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShouta-san! Change the rules for the festival!\u201d Eri suddenly pipes up, bringing Izuku back to reality with a bark of laughter at the poor man\u2019s predicament.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah Shouta, can\u2019t the \u2018oh so great\u2019 teacher of 1-A change the rules?\u201d Vlad King snickered, bringing some sort of rivalry into the conversation.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asahi Rei was one of the many poor saps desperately needing work. Being quirkless didn\u2019t used to be too bad when he was in college. So, he went after his dreams, only to fail. Instead he got an office job, only to lose it when the new CEO did major cuts. Six months later and nothing.\nAsahi wondered if perhaps he should have begged the coffee shop kid for a job? Then again, the brat probably just took pity on him and gave stupid empty condolences. It\u2019s not like the jerk gave him a job or anything. Working at a coffee shop wouldn\u2019t be too bad, but the kid probably didn\u2019t want someone quirkless there for liabilities. Insurance companies had higher rates for business with quirkless people because of them being \u2018weak\u2019 in accidents. Walking down the road, two shops down- a tailor\u2019s, how lovely- an old man struggled with a box.\n\u201cWell? You going to help, brat?\u201d The man demanded after Asahi stared at him for a minute. With a start, he hurriedly picked the box up and carried it inside. After it was done, he turned to the door to leave, spotting a \u2018help wanted\u2019 written in sharpie on a napkin taped to the door. It was a sloppy job if Asahi ever saw one.\n\u201cUh, sir?\u201d He gulped and tried to point to the sign. The man grunted.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hired. Be here at six am sharp or I\u2019ll fire you.\u201d\n\u201cW-WHAT?\u201d Asahi shrieked, not catching on.\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s your name? For paperwork.\u201d\n\u201cAsahi Rei, sir. But\u2026 before you hire me\u2026\u201d He winced at his honesty. \u201cI\u2019m quirkless.\u201d A beat of silence met them. Asahi half expected an apologetic dismissal.\n\u201cSo? Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re quirkless or if All Might\u2019s stupid ass quirk manifested in you: show up at six am or else.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUh, Yes SIR!\u201d Asahi bowed, true happiness in his heart. Who knew that stupid kid with the coffee could tell fortunes? Maybe that\u2019s his quirk.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soon it was time to bid goodnight, with Eri asleep upstairs and all tabs closed. Izuku and the very done Shouta Aizawa were the last ones in the shop, Shouta drinking a jelly packet while Izuku cleaned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou went out.\u201d Shouta said casually.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd did something about that man.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have no idea what you mean, Shouta-san.\u201d Izuku batted innocent eyes. Shouta snorted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah, and Hizashi can sing.\u201d Duel shudders ran up their spines at the memory of him singing tonight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmm, Eri is looking forward to watching the festival. You\u2019re commentating, right?\u201d Change of topics, success.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately. By the way, here.\u201d Two tickets hit his face, and Izuku looked at the very expensive VIP passes for the festival. \u201cWe requested for those to be given out so you could go. I know you\u2019ll like getting an up close and personal look at how your analysis improved my students\u2019 quirks so far.\u201d He mumbled the last part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tears sprung to Izuku\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShouta\u2026 I can\u2019t accept these. You know that these cost soo much. Besides, I have a shop to run\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust come for the third round, it starts at three. You can have your morning earnings and then get out for the afternoon. Also\u2026 Nezu wants to meet you. He\u2019s the one that approved the tickets. He\u2019ll be coming with us next time here, so be cautious about Dekiru\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That made Izuku pause. While it wouldn\u2019t be too bad if the super intelligent mammal knew about Dekiru, he honestly didn\u2019t want that kind of attention on his family. If Nezu went through one of his famous spells of digging into every crevice of what intrigued him, Izuku didn\u2019t want to know what he would be able to dig up on Eri\u2019s or his past. While the papers would more than likely stand up to scrutiny, there was always a really low chance of them not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well then, I\u2019ll welcome him like any other guess\u201d Izuku finally monotoned. This caused the older male\u2019s eyebrow to raise, but he dropped it. He waved and left the boy to his cleaning.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Going through old boxes shouldn\u2019t make his lungs this filled with dust, Izuku decided. But, Izuku wanted to pull out some photos of their family for her online school\u2019s \u2018family tree\u2019 project. His mother had an old scrapbook filled with photos of her, her family, and various friends she made. Izuku never bothered to look through it. In his mind, it was always him and his mother. His father left and grandparents disowned them; why should he bother looking at their faces then? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOld gun safety manual, bike handle\u2026 a dented kettle\u2026ah! The book!\u201d Izuku cheered. He wiped off the cover and began to flip through it, planning on just grabbing a few pictures each. Page after page were sappy childhood ones of his mother (she really was beautiful even then) to her adult life. Nothing unusual until one picture shook his foundation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was his mother, at what appeared to be her wedding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Getting a dance\u2026 with a familiar body of suit and purple mist. Just to be sure, he looked on the back to see the names of the people in the photo.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Midoriya-chan and Kurogiri-kun having a dance of friendship at the lovely Inko\u2019s wedding.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blood ran ice cold.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was his mother doing dancing with one of Japan\u2019s most wanted?\n----\nThe next day was Shinsou\u2019s day to work before the festival, something Eri was ecstatic about. She was spending the day making her own \u2018analysis book\u2019 like Izuku\u2019s in preparation. It apparently had to have stickers on every page.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be honest, the greenette was glad she was upstairs while he stayed mainly in the back. Shinsou ran the front, though it was a rather slow day. After finding that photo, Izuku hadn\u2019t had time to look into it more as the shop and Eri\u2019s school demanded him, meaning troubling thoughts loomed in his head.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Logically, he knew his mother\u2026 knew some people. But, those were distant things, people he never really cared about or affected his life negatively. But Kurogiri was someone who tried to kill Aizawa, Shinsou, and Kirishima. The man helped run what was becoming one of the most dangerous organizations in the underground if dark web chatter were to be believed. His thoughts grew darker, wondering if his mother ever did \u2018a favor\u2019 and received one from him\u2026 or if their coffee shop was possible because of that man.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His thoughts were pushed aside as he put on a fake smile, bringing fresh cookies to the display counter. No one was in the shop except Shinsou, who looked\u2026 downtrodden.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Izuku asked, keeping the sigh out of his voice. He just wanted to tear into every file from his mother\u2019s old work places and find out what Kurogiri had to do with anything.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing Boss!\u201d Shinsou flustered but gave in at the unimpressed raised eye. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 My quirk.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent quirk, yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo you, but what about at the festival? We have to compete in front of thousands, with all the pros looking for talent. What happens when they see my quirk and think I\u2019m a villain in the making? That I\u2019ll use it on them and not a bad guy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey won\u2019t\u201d The greenette said simply.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Boss. It\u2019s always happened in the past. Even in Aizawa\u2019s class there have been a few\u2026 vocal ones. I have friends now, but I still don\u2019t want the world against me.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShinsou-kun. Look at me\u201d Izuku ordered, making their gazes meet. \u201cThe past is the past. Do not let someone\u2019s past- even your own- overshadowed the present. Will there be mockers? Yes, everyone is human. We all make mistakes and have dark patches on our souls from our pasts- even All Might I bet- but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone lets those dark patches define them. If you go out there with your head held high and be a hero, most people will look past your quirk\u2019s surface level potential and see the hero inside I know you are. That Eri and Kirishima knows you are.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By the end tears are starting to fall down the purple haired boy\u2019s cheeks and he nods.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re right, Boss; I\u2019m going to show them all I\u2019m a hero.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Izuku praises before leaving the shop for a quick errand, somehow head feeling lighter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though, he did still have to research his mother\u2019s connection with Kurogiri; it could be a lead. But no matter how his shop came to be, it was still the same place: a meeting spot for those in a tough spot needing guidance and a good cup of coffee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, and cookies, of course.\n\nChapter 4\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tucking in Eri the night before the festival had been a special kind of hell, so Izuku was on his own for the morning shift at the shop. His adorable little sister had not stopped playing till after midnight, much to Izuku\u2019s dismay. Now he had to deal with customers fretting over where \u2018their little unicorn was\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you SURE she\u2019s not sick? Green bean, what if the little listener has a cold? Or the flu? Or what if she has some flesh eating virus that makes her sleepy!\u201d Hizashi Yamada\u2019s loud fretting was cut off by Shouta\u2019s boot to the head. Instantly the yellow haired man was bound by the capture scarf while its user sighed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re such a child, Hizashi; the kid stayed up too late is all. Problem Child has already promised she\u2019s fine and will be up for the stupid festival.\u201d Shouta growled. A muffled screeching was his answer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYamada-san\u201d The shop owner sighed as the man was trying to make Izuku more informal with him like with Shouta, \u201cEri was just excited about seeing everyone today; she spent three hours picking out the plushy to take with her after I limited her to one. Apparently, it was a tie between the Present Mic plushy and her unicorn.\u201d Izuku deadpanned. Immediately the blonde was out of his bounds and shaking the young shop keeper.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIzuku-chaaaaaaaaaaaan, you\u2019re too cruel! She should be able to take as many plushies as she wishes! What if they want to watch the festivities too?!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen they can watch it on the tv while we\u2019re gone. I\u2019m letting it stay on despite it being a waste of electricity. Besides, she\u2019s taking her unicorn plushy with her. At least she decided on her favorite.\u201d Izuku didn\u2019t notice Shouta\u2019s smirk and Hizashi\u2019s soul leaving his body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cS-she didn\u2019t pick the Present Mic one?\u201d He tried to wheeze out through tears. Izuku raised a brow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, apparently her unicorn is \u2018the bestest of the best\u2019. It\u2019s to be expected of course. After all\u2026\u201d Here Izuku leaned down to stage whisper. \u201cIt was the first animal I ever got her. Eri said that as \u2018her favorite person\u2019 I get the honor of seeing my gift to her be carted around at the festival. Adorable, right?\u201d Izuku gave a shit eating grin, proud that he was still \u2018the coolest\u2019 despite Eri now knowing several heroes. If he was hero, he hoped he\u2019d have been her favorite one as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStupid familial privileges\u2026 Midoriya- no, Izuku, let me adopt Eri.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHell no.\u201d Was the instantaneous reply. \u201cGo get your own sister complex.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you admit you have one\u201d Shouta snorted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd proud of it! Now, take your coffee and shoo.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pair left, One dragging the other in a scarf, making Izuku shake his head. Several customers chuckled at the sight but didn\u2019t comment on the owner\u2019s muttering of \u2018protection plans against potential sister snatchers\u2019.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The shop was cleaned and shut, ready to be opened the next day (though perhaps he\u2019d hold a dinner for Shinsou and Kirishima if they wished tonight), and Izuku was just tapping his foot impatiently, waiting for Eri.\nWearing an old shirt as he didn\u2019t have many instances where he wasn\u2019t wearing his work uniform, Izuku made a mental note of groceries they could pick up after the events.\n\u201cEri, come on! We have to leave now if we don\u2019t want to be late!\u201d\n\u201cCOMING!\u201d Eri shouted after a moment and hopped down the stairs\u2026.\n\u201c\u2026What are you wearing?\u201d He asked. Midnight boots, Eraserhead pants and scarf (and were those yellow swim goggles peeking out), Present Mic jacket over what looked like one of Izuku\u2019s old work shirts, an exoplasm face mask to the side of a purple wig, and her unicorn stuffed inside his old All Might backpack. She waved at him with her notebook, hands in fingerless gloves that said \u2018manly\u2019. Various Hero stickers decorated her notebook she was taking.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see everyone, so I wanted to cheer them on!\u201d She said seriously. \u201cI had to wear something from everyone. Kiri-chan and Hito-chan even got me a wig and gloves!\u201d Izuku silently held up his phone and took a picture. Sliding it away, he moved to pick her up, but Eri\u2019s next few sentences made him hug her instead. \u201cI even got my favorite hero here!\u201d\n\u201cOh? Who, Eraserhead?\u201d Only logical as he had the most being represented, though Izuku was sure Present Mic had wormed his way into her heart.\n\u201cNo silly! YOU obviously.\u201d She pointed to the way too big white shirt and tie. Tears watered his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m your favorite hero?\u201d He whispered while hugging his sister.\n\u201cUh huh. You saved me after all, even if I\u2019m not allowed to tell people about it. You\u2019re my hero.\u201d\nThey left five minutes late, but Izuku didn\u2019t care as he openly cried.\n----\nShouta Aizawa was so done with this commentator thing, already planning revenge on his \u2018friend\u2019 for this. They were finishing up lunch in the booth when both their phones went off, showing the group chat Nemuri set up with all of them and Izuku. All the teachers- including All Might (Toshinori, Aizawa reminded himself), though Izuku didn\u2019t know that- were in the chat, save Nezu.\nIt was originally so that the brat could ask for help if need be, but so far it\u2019s been used for memes and hell as Nemuri shared pictures of his past that Problem Child had NO business seeing.\nBut the picture currently staring at him? It was instantly going in the \u2018print and put copy on desk\u2019 folder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOMG, SHOUTA! Look at this! Eri-chan looks like me!\u201d Hizashi gushed, earning an eye twitch from Shouta.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook closer, idiot: She\u2019s clearly wearing more of MY outfit.\u201d He would deny he sounded smug at that. It appears he was Eri\u2019s favorite hero.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStupid Izuku, he had to ruin it.\u201d Hizashi muttered in fake anger. Shouta quirked a brow but looked at the messages.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Midnight: Awwwwww, what a cutie! She wanted to dress up for us?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coffee Hero: Yep! My little sister says to have a great time and that she\u2019ll be cheering everyone on- even you, Shouta-san.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exoplasm; I approve of her mask.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Power Loader: Wait, why don\u2019t I have any merch being represented? I thought I was her favorite hero.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stupid Yellow Rabbit: I\u2019m sure Young Eri has no favorite.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bane of My Existence: No way! Little Listener says I\u2019m her favorite. Right, Izuku?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coffee Hero: Hehe, about that\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Midnight: RIP Power Loader; I\u2019m her favorite though, right? Or maybe Shouta, even if he is a grump.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coffee Hero: She said I\u2019m her favorite hero, she even wore my first work shirt and tie. And don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve already bought bracelets of every teacher today so she\u2019s wearing your stuff guys!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attached was a short video of Eri jumping up and down while holding a unicorn shaped milkshake screaming \u2018NII-SAN\u2019S MY FAVORITE! BEST HERO! Best HERO!\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The chat started blowing up constantly after that. Shouta ended up having to take his friend\u2019s phone away so they could actually commentate.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The siblings watched the matches with much cheering and happiness\u2026 well unless someone got hurt, then Eri cried.\n\u00a0Sitting in the VIP section was a blast, and often times one of the teachers would pop in to chat with Eri or bring her merchandise. Already Izuku was dreading the walk home with all the bags. During most of the matches, Izuku took notes on the quirks of 1-A, trying to find ways to improve them further. For certain matches, however, he observed with rapt attention, Eri just as focused.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGO HITO-CHAN!\u201d Eri screamed while leaning on the railing. Hitoshi looked up and gave a timid smile. He was facing off against Katsuki, much to Izuku\u2019s dismay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Katsuki Bakugou was someone the greenette seldom thought about, and when he did it was with mixed feelings. On one hand, his former neighbor and friend was just a child when he bullied Izuku and could have matured. On the other\u2026 Izuku still had scars. He knew Katsuki would be in the festival (he DID make a detailed analysis for him like the others) but wasn\u2019t sure how seeing his old friend and bully after five years would go.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They never did have closure after all. Izuku was pulled out the same day of his mother\u2019s doctor appointment and they moved to the store a week later. Sure the place was leaky and they had to shower in the community gyms for a couple months during repairs, but they still moved. He remembers his mother blocking Mitsuki\u2019s number when she kept trying to call them, saying she shouldn\u2019t have to talk to someone who raised a monster. When Katsuki tried to call Izuku, she changed his number, not wanting that part of their lives to follow them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While Izuku was musing the fight started with a bang. Hitoshi, obviously receiving more training from Aizawa with the quick jabs aimed at Katsuki\u2019s throat, jumped back from explosions. The explosion user socked him in the jaw when the purple haired teen tried to antagonize him for a few minutes while dodging. Without a word the angry looking blonde swung Hitoshi out of the ring and into the wall. Said purplette collapsed in a heap. Eri immediately started crying.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cN-nii-san! What happened to Hito-chan?! Is he going to die?\u201d She sobbed. It didn\u2019t help matters when their friend was carried off the arena on a stretcher while blood dried on the wall. Izuku hugged his sister and wiped her face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould seeing him make you feel better?\u201d He asked, wincing internally after she nodded as he sent a text asking the teachers for their assistance. Yagi-san thankfully promised to come pick them up and take them to the infirmary. The enigma of a man that even Izuku couldn\u2019t find anything on was a real life saver. Soon they were walking to visit the purple haired teen, Yagi making small talk.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo\u2026\u201d Usually he didn\u2019t speak to the shop user. The young man was known to just bring his herbal tea and accept payment quietly, allowing Toshinori to absorb the lively shop his coworkers dragged him to. Of course he thought the shop keeper was an amazing person.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which is why he kept his distance. A young business owner who appeared quite happy with his life didn\u2019t need All Might to barge in and drag him down One For All\u2019s bloody path of tragedy. The young man was a good candidate for the quirk- intelligent, brave, and known for helping anyone without a second thought. If only the kid had decided to even go to a high school.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But maybe\u2026 maybe he should give it a go? Get Nezu to recommend the boy test in, and talk to him? Could he do that, even if he had to find a successor soon? Toshinori shook his head vigorously and dismissed the thought as the siblings crowded around the young Shinsou, much to Recovery Girl\u2019s annoyance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019d leave them out of this. Bringing those siblings into his fight was too cruel, and the boy made the right choice in not being a hero. Even with a quirk it was hell, and without one, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI swear, you\u2019re headed for an early grave if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d Izuku admonished, as Shinsou looked sheepish. Most of his injuries were healed but he had a broken arm that was still sore and would take a week to get to be one hundred percent. He was instructed to rest while Recovery Girl prepared some more gummies, meaning the siblings who made his world better were there to entertain him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know, boss; I\u2019m sorry, I just got\u2026 so angry. He refused to talk, even though he always insults everyone.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you even say? I haven\u2019t seen him get that angry since\u2026\u201d Izuku trailed off. Hitoshi blinked but filed away the information that his boss knew the bully of 1-A away for later.\n\u00a0Neither boy noticed Eri\u2019s eyes going blank as she rested a hand on the cast.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2026 said that he was a villain, that he should have joined a villain group since his attitude would fit right in.\u201d Izuku sucked in a breath. \u201cI know that was low, but I just wanted to win. No matter what I do, I\u2019m still behind a lot of classmates combat wise, I just\u2026 wanted to prove I deserved to be in the class.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do deserve it, I promise. Already heroes are praising your first two rounds and your matches. You might get some great internship offers, but for now we should probably go watch Kirishima\u2019s match. I\u2019ll see you tonight for dinner to celebrate getting into the third round?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cY-yeah. That sounds good- ow!\u201d A light enveloped Hitoshi\u2019s form before receding back\u2026into Eri\u2019s horn. When it left, Hitoshi was healed, all his bruises and cuts gone. \u201cW- what was that?!\u201d He squeaked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Izuku\u2019s face was pale. This was exactly what he didn\u2019t want to happen. Eri\u2019s quirk, from their very few experiments, was powerful. It was good, but potentially able to cause many questions- and accidents. Just ask that to the mouse she erased from existence last month. They were going slow, but with the investigations on the League of Villains, Izuku hadn\u2019t had time to help her train. He was planning on paying Shouta to tutor her secretly; having such a powerful quirk without training would cause way too many questions, and Izuku didn\u2019t want Eri to be put under that mess.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not when the dark web described the man behind the league as someone who could steal and give quirks. The man his mother offered to have help him years ago with his quirkless dilemma. With Eri\u2019s quirk, he didn\u2019t want to risk peaking his interest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShinsou-kun\u2026\u201d Izuku whispered. The room went cold as he stared at his employee. \u201cI need a favor.\u201d\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hitoshi sat next to his boss and his boss\u2019s sister pale as a ghost yet oddly not terrified. Sure, everything from his life and manhood to reputation had been threatened if he ever told a soul about Eri\u2019s quirk without Izuku\u2019s permission, but the worker still held utter loyalty to the greenette. Besides, it\u2019s not like he would ever betray his boss. And hiding his healed wounds (and sneaking out of the infirmary) had made him feel like a ninja. Who knew his boss could jump two stories with Eri on his back and still look epic?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOoh! Kiri-chan is winning.\u201d Eri pointed to the ring, where Kirishima and someone named Tetsutetsu started arm wrestling. Honestly, Izuku wondered about his former employee sometimes. When the redhead expertly \u2018proved his manliness\u2019 by driving Tetsutetsu in the ground, Eri screamed in happiness. Izuku joined in, as did Hitoshi, though more reluctantly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll make it in the next round? He\u2019s fighting Bakugou of all people.\u201d Hitoshi commented dryly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Eri looked up as her brother hummed. \u201cNo. It will be a good fight but I know Katsuki; he\u2019ll pull through.\u201d This got Eri to tear up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI- I don\u2019t want Kiri-chan to fight that meanie. He\u2019s the bully you talked about.\u201d Now the older boy regretted telling his sister even the scrap of information on his school days. Why must all his bedtime stories be used against him? First it was where babies come from, and now she was spilling tea to his worker!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBully?\u201d Now Hitoshi was interested. Rarely did Izuku talk about his childhood, much less about bullies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHmm, yes, I used to call him \u2018Kaachan\u2019 and he called me\u2026 a less kind name. When we opened the shop, we moved and that was that. He was a bully but he has the\u00a0 potential to be a fantastic hero.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI doubt that. He\u2019s a violent jerk.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, now, just because he isn\u2019t\u2026likable\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s irredeemable. I\u2019ve known that since the first time he picked on me. And Eri, quit pouting and enjoy the matches.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Matches pass quietly, as Izuku fills up a notebook with coded analysis on each contestant, knowing Shouta would want them later. Hitoshi dozed in the next seat, Eri sitting in his lap with her own book.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey Nii-san? Can you help me do the notebook of that plant girl? I\u2019m no good at it like you are.\u201d \u00a0Izuku smiled in response as he wrote.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course. Remember what I told you about setting up an analysis page: start with a bare bones map of the quirk BEFORE you do the small details.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Little did the trio know that a certain Principal had the booth bugged, finding the entire interaction fascinating.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIzuku Midoriya you have my attention.\u201d Nezu smirked from his own booth while sipping tea.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bakugou blocked Kirishima\u2019s attack, sending an explosion to the side as a distraction. His classmate\u2019s drive was inspiring he admitted, even if Bakugou knew he\u2019d come out on top.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And he did. Like always he beat his opponent in the ground. But like every time since he disappeared, it seemed boring. No one could make his blood boil like him, nobody dared look down on Bakugou\u2019s power.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If only the nerd hadn\u2019t left. Katsuki Bakugou would never admit it aloud, but he secretly wished his old friend was watching him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The finals of the festival sent shockwaves- literally- through the stadium. Bakugou looked peeved when he won against the Todoroki boy, Izuku noticed. When he stood on the stage steaming and spit on the first place meddle All Might gave him, Izuku knew something was wrong. More so than usual with his former friend turned bully turned stranger.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Too bad it wasn\u2019t any of his business. Curse his curious mind.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now it was just Izuku and Eri, the former carrying the latter and all their bags back to the shop. He had enjoyed himself greatly, as did the younger greenette, but now it was time for a nap before dinner with his worker and former worker.\n----\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was the afternoon after the Sports Festival at UA and Kurogiri cleaned another glass absently, hoping it would get his dark thoughts to go away. Tomura was once again negotiating with some villain for an allaiance, this time a rather rude man by the name of Stain. It was rather remarkable really, that Inko had ever put up with the man during her own\u2026colorful past before Izuku was born, even if the man wasn\u2019t a murderer then. Or how she could stand dealing with him online. The \u2018vigilante\u2019 was crude, rude, and unintelligent. Kurogiri was just thankful the boy Izuku was never in the shadows like Inko and he were\u2026or are, in his unfortunate case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thoughts drifted to Inko\u2019s child, and how he was running a lucrative coffee shop while raising that orphan child. Kurogiri was just happy he could help his former friend out one last time. Especially after what she did for him five years ago, knowing the hell it would bring down on her if anyone ever found out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But that was the kind of person Inko Midoriya was: kind to a fault but willing to shake hands with demons in order to protect her kind.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After all, she dealt with him. It was the least he could do to give her offspring a normal life. One not involved with the convoluted plan to bring change to the world, a change Kurogiri wasn\u2019t sure he wanted. But one he was committed to.\n----\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While a former friend of his mother regretted everything yet nothing, a green haired youth resisted the urge to wipe the smile off his own face.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His normally peaceful shop, known for happiness and good coffee, was now a potential war zone. And it was all thanks to his former employee dragging in \u2018a super awesome manly friend!\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome, Kirishima\u2026and Katsuki Bakugou. What can I get you?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow about an explanation! Where you been, Deku?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNii-san, we\u2019re out of cat paw\u2026cookies.\u201d Eri walked into the main area of the shop, quieting down at the tense atmosphere. Izuku sighed, and figured this talk was coming. Perhaps a coffee would allow for a calm discussion now that they weren\u2019t children? Maybe they could come to an understanding? He did have a lot of questions about his former friend, after all.\n\u00a0Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t customers to make sure the boy behave, but Kirishima should be enough.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOi! Don\u2019t ignore me, shitty nerd.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo cursing. It\u2019s the rules.\u201d Eri puffed out her cheeks. Bakugou scowled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, fucking brat.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suddenly, Izuku was very happy there weren\u2019t any customers in the place: it would make it easier to hide murdering the scum before him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you, a piece of scum not worthy of decorating the deepest pits of hell, dare say to my precious little sister I would burn the world for?\u201d The room turned icy, and Katsuki Bakugou was reminded of the time he spilled milk on some coded papers of Auntie Inko and laughed when she started crying.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, Kirishima felt the conflicting need to simultaneously call Shinsou to prevent a murder of one of his school friends and take Eri to the park before returning with the means to destroy a body.\n\nChapter 5\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nMidoriya family members, both mother and son, are not openly violent people. They prefer to cry over tea and make up with an enemy over anything else. Even when retaliation is possible, they tended to go down the road of destroying reputations or ruining a corporation financially rather than physical attacks.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSo when Katsuki found himself hanging from the ceiling by apron strings and kitchen knives, he knew he was going to die.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThe brat- Eri, Katsuki\u2019s mind supplied from when Deku sent her outside with Shitty hair- was the cause of all this. If only his mouth wasn\u2019t hardwired to be vulgar in Deku\u2019s presence.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThere was really only one way to make a Midoriya get physically violent: cause harm to those they viewed as family while in their presence. Katsuki knew Auntie Inko was capable of it after some low life at the park spit on Izuku and pushed him down when the four-year-old bumped into him on the sidewalk nearby. Inko Midoriya, who showed no signs of being an assassin moments before, had the man pinned to a tree by his underwear and stabbed in the balls.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nFrom across the park. \n\nOnly Katsuki had seen the knife move from her purse to the man, and the \u2018sweet\u2019 smile she gave him later ensured he stayed silent. It was the real reason he never bullied Izuku around his mother if he\u2019s being honest.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd now Izuku was proving to be just as violent as Auntie Inko. Gulping, Katsuki idly noticed his quirk wasn\u2019t working- where did Izuku get a quirk suppressing APRON of all things?!- as the green haired boy shot him that super \u2018sweet\u2019 smile.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cNow that the light of my life is going out for a fun day at the park with my former employee, we\u2019re going to talk like civilized people or-\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to stick me in closet for a time out if I refuse? News flash nerd, my mom can hit harder than you and I\u2019ve fought worse, \nDeku.\n\u201d Katsuki interrupted despite the aura in the room. If he was going to die, it was going to be with dignity!\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHowever, his former friend\u2019s eyes went blank like they did whenever he was thinking about\u00a0 a hero or quirk, before snapping in realization of something.\n\n\n\u201cHow about some tea?\u201d Was the green haired nerd\u2019s only response before Katsuki Bakugou was let down (how did he get up there in the first place, he wasn\u2019t sure). He couldn\u2019t believe it when he just willingly plopped down at a comfortable but worn wooden chair, accepting his favorite Oolong tea silently.\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIzuku frowned at the observations he made while Bakugou drank the tea with muted enjoyment. His former friend had always been explosive, and would never have given in so easily as a child just because of a little quirk suppressant binding apron (and did he really have to thank Midnight for that one, and Shouta-san for spending the weekend hours teaching him how to tie up a rowdy customer before they got out of hand) and \u2018scary aura\u2019. Izuku intentionally let the knot be loose, intending on just scolding him (read: being such a Midoriya that Saten would cry) for a while and calling Shouta-san to deal with him. If it resulted in Bakugou getting detention and apologizing to Eri? Even better.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBut to not even try to escape the bindings and give that half baked retort with those connotations was worrying.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku knew from the first six months with Eri that abuse victims had certain tells for anyone daring to look. Eri herself would hunch her shoulders, pulling her sleeves down, and crawl inside small spaces to name the more obvious ones. She would ask every time he so much as gave feedback on something if she would \u2018be hit\u2019 or \u2018sent back\u2019. Oftentimes she wouldn\u2019t accept praise or rewards because \u2018it wasn\u2019t the best\u2019 or \u2018I wasn\u2019t the best\u2019 no matter how good she really did. Bakugou showed his own special kind of signs- signs that were probably there since the beginning.\n\n\nExtremely aggressive and standoffish behavior to those kind to him. He thought they looked down on him. When they were five, Izuku was sure Bakugou screaming for him to \u2018stop looking down on him\u2019 everytime Izuku brought an extra bento since Bakugou never seemed full was the blond being egotistical. Now it seemed defensive. Even now, Bakugou was eyeing the cup suspiciously like it was going to cost him something.\n\n\nLoud behaviour, to the point of excessiveness, and seemingly craving praise. As children, his behaviour was chalked up to being related to his quirk, but many children who are cast aside at home act out or become excessive to garner more attention.\u00a0\n\n\nMore and more tells- like how Bakugou almost had to be chained to the podium for the metal or used to flinch when Izuku tried having playdates at Bakugou\u2019s house before a push down the stairs stopped that- played through Izuku\u2019s keen mind.\u00a0\n\n\nHe really shouldn\u2019t get involved, he knows. He already has the mystery of his mother, a villain organization to take out, not to mention a stack of folders to deliver to Hosu in two weeks since Shouta-san would be busy with the takedown of a Yakuza supplier before a new shipment arrived. Not that Shouta \n\nknew \n\nthat Izuku was aware that Eraserhead was assigned to the case- he was the one to feed the intel last month to the police, but not using Dekiru. He couldn\u2019t let his alter ego get \n\nall \n\nthe attention. No, a \u2018concerned single father\u2019 had called from a ratty gym before all security footage within six blocks were erased and a pdf was emailed to the cops. It accidentally meant though, that Izuku was out one delivery man on top of his other duties. So he should give Bakugou a warning about talking to Eri and let him leave, knowing it wasn\u2019t his responsibility.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t. Izuku sighed to himself, not realizing it was freaking the other boy out and smiled in a kind fashion while blocking out thoughts of what he wanted to say to the brat about Eri. Then, a way to kill two birds with one stone hit.\n\n\n\u201cTo start with, you\u2019re going to be Eri\u2019s bodyguard for the week before your internships.\u201d Izuku stated bluntly, plan already forming.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?! No way am I hanging around some shitty brat-\u201d a fork embedded itself next to his hand.\n\n\n\u201cOops! My hand must have slipped, silly me.\u201d Izuku giggled, unnerving Bakugou to no end, face white as ash. \u201cBefore I was so rudely interrupted, you will be watching my precious angel everyday after school until seven pm. Lately I\u2019ve been unable to take her to the park, much less the library for their weekly storytimes. You, my \u2018friend\u2019, are going to take her wherever she wants to go. I don\u2019t care if she wants to visit a hero museum, the beach, or even the unicorn cafe in Tokyo; you will be a gentleman and take lots of pictures of her having fun while keeping her safe. If you refuse this\u2026\u201d The next ten minuets of Izuku rambling were the most terrifying in the aspiring number one\u2019s life.\n\n\n----\n\n\nWaving goodbye to the retreating trio the next afternoon (Kirishima needed extra money for his internship and Izuku was happy to pay for him to go with Bakugou and Eri), the analyst and coffee shop own let his smile drop and set to work guiding Shouta-san through an earpiece, typing away at his keyboard.\n\n\n\u201cYes, turn right, his bedroom should be at the end of the hall.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018You were right about Mitsuki; her behaviour is already enough to warrant a full investigation, even without that evidence you just \u2018accidentally\u2019 acquired last night.\u2019 \n\nThe crackling voice of his hobo accomplice came through, making Izuku suppress a nervous chuckle. Staying up till two am going through the video feed of a security camera aimed at the front of the Bakugou house was not the...wisest course of action, especially since Eri wasn\u2019t there at the shop to help out. Thankfully he had forty minutes before the shop opened and thirty after that before it got busy.\n\n\nThe night before had been enlightening to say the least. In the last month alone of footage Bakugou had punched by his mother when he opened the door, in full view of the footage. On the day of the USJ footage, Izuku lip read a conversation that amounted to Bakugou \u2018being a piece of trash and worthless son\u2019 if he was so weak and \u2018couldn\u2019t beat low level villains\u2019 despite having the highest amount of captures. Hospital records- always so easy to hack- showed seven visits in the last two years, ranging from a broken collarbone (\u2018falling down the stairs\u2019) to large amounts of glass being embedded in his back on a day Izuku saw through the cameras in the neighborhood that Bakugou dodged Mitsuki\u2019s punch and flipped her off before being yanked into the house by his ear. That one was blamed on a school yard fight.\n\n\nThen it got interesting as he discovered that Masaru wasn\u2019t living with his wife anymore, as work across town made him rent an apartment- and has been since Bakugou was nine. Taking that initiative, he contacted the meek man and asked (read: bully through evidence and guilt tripping) for him to send his wife on a surprise week long spa trip while letting Bakugou\u2019s teachers and school conduct a child abuse case. The man himself was privately being charged with negligence and emotional abuse as Masaru hadn\u2019t done anything to stop Mitsuki, choosing to leave instead of helping or even just telling Inko. He agreed to let the investigation take off and preliminary searches- thank God the man owned the house and thus could let police in- to get enough evidence for a proper warrant in exchange for leniency.\u00a0\n\n\nNow it was just giving Bakugou a few days of forced \u2018Eri therapy\u2019 before things turned his world upside down.\n\n\n\n\u2018Problem Child? Problem Child, you there?\u2019 \n\nShouta\u2019s unamused voice broke him from his thoughts. He had to help get the ball rolling on this search after all.\u00a0\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u201cShoutaaaaaa! Just tell us already!\u201d Hizashi Yamada wailed while being dragged to their group\u2019s coffee shop by the infamous scarf. Nemuri seemed just as interested.\n\n\n\u201cI told you, the informant that set the investigation is my private contact; I\u2019m not about to risk their identity getting leaked just to satiate you lots\u2019 stupid curiosity.\u201d Honestly, these last three days had drained Shouta Aizawa to new levels. Being woken up at five am by a hyperactive Problem Child sporting circumstantial evidence that one of his students were being emotionally and physically abused (while kicking himself that he hadn\u2019t seen the signs) really should have been enough to drain him.\n\n\nBut then being told that he was going to lead the investigation and never give Problem Child\u2019s involvement away yet still put the parents away would normally had done him in.\n\n\nBut to \n\nthen\n\n be told about how not only Bakugou cursed at Eri and spit in her direction before being owned by his Problem Child? Now that just sent Shouta into a vicious cycle of \u2018must help student\u2019 and \u2018must kill brat who hurt Eri\u2019 that made breathing too troublesome. And now he had to deal with his coworkers in the middle of the investigation.\n\n\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d Problem Child\u2019s ever chipper voice was enough for the attention to be taken off Shouta long enough to grab his waiting cup at the counter and curl up on the couch.\n\n\nBest to just let Problem Child deal with his coworkers\u2019 and boss\u2019s annoying questions. It\u2019s the least the brat could do after dumping another case on him in the midst of another investigation into the Yakuza. If he was salty that said Yakuza supplier case came from Problem Child who then acted like he had no clue why Shouta was so tired? All the better.\n\n\nMeanwhile, one explosive blond was busy keeping the laugh out of his voice while watching Kirishima be conned into buying Eri another ice cream despite knowing how Deku was going to react going past her sugar intake. This week sucked, he kept telling himself, even when it started sounding fake to his ears.\n\n\n----\n\n\nIzuku blinked at the\u2026 creature, sipping some of their famous mixed tea while sitting on his counter after the rather well executed introduction. He knew this was coming, but between the investigation, his other projects, and work, he just wanted the rat thing to leave.\n\n\nBut, he was a host, and a Midoriya.\n\n\n\u201cI hope you enjoy your beverage, Nezu-san.\u201d He smiled like he always did. The UA staff were busy arguing about what to get Eri for a surprise gift since she was gone still and debating who the \u2018mystery informant\u2019 was. They were so absorbed that none noticed the pair in a dance of words at the counter.\n\n\n\u201cIt is most excellent, Midoriya-san; tell me, what\u2019s the infamous \u2018Dekiru\u2019 doing running a coffee shop?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about\u201d Izuku meekly squeaked, not liking the interested glint in Nezu\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\u201cHmm, your expression gives you away. You\u2019re good at hiding it, but I\u2019m better.\u201d And like a shotgun the battle of wits began between two geniuses, one a human tugging away from his dark skeletons and the other a mouse skipping right towards them.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that, ne, \n\nNezu-san?\n\n\u201d Poison green met beady black. He had to protect everything- especially what he found yesterday, right under the smile of his dear mother\u2019s shrine. \n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nFloorboards were a funny thing in the Midoriya family. Throughout his childhood, Izuku remembered his mother teaching him the best method to hide important things in them, and where to look for said items. By the time he was six, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to find a loose board booby trapped for him to unlock, treasure inside as an incentive. He should have known that his mother would find a way to keep something important under one of the boards, even if he was sure he\u2019d checked it for signs of being tampered with after her death.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nThat\u2019s why he really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find his mother\u2019s missing diary under the floorboard in front of her ashes. The journal was the missing piece he had been looking for weeks, and feeling the board slam into his face after stepping on it totally didn\u2019t make him cry.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt totally did.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTrembling hands read the note on the inside cover, dated just a week before she died.\n\n\n\nDear Izuku,\n\n\n\n\nMy time is short; each passing day I feel my energy drain and my life fade. Soon the day will come for you to be on your own.\n\n\n\n\nNo, not on your own. You have the shop, your freedom, and now you have Eri. Take care of her, Izuku. You gave up your dream for her without hesitation. Though you may think you\u2019re nothing, you\u2019re a hero, in both mine and that little girl\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\n\nI should wrap this up, as my will has my full letter of regret and love for you. By the time you read this I\u2019ll be dead. The board had a trigger on it with a timer set to unlock sometime after you turned fifteen. I bet you had a surprise when it became loose, eh! I have a feeling you cried when it hit you in the face, so much like myself.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, inside is everything I did. It\u2019s not all pretty, Izuku. If I could, I\u2019d ask for you to not read it, especially what I did to earn Eri\u2019s new identity. But I can\u2019t. There are people out there who would use your ignorance against you, people who know everything I\u2019ve done. So, my son, read and see what your mother allowed herself to become. I\u2019ve accepted that you\u2019ll hate me afterwards\u2026\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. Know that no matter what you do after reading my journal, that I will ALWAYS love you from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\n\n\nLove,\n\n\n\n\nMom\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI could never hate you, mom.\u201d Izuku whispered while cradling the book close to his chest. In the early morning light a grieving boy began to unravel the mystery that was Inko Midoriya.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWhy must humans be so cruel? My sweet parents who once held me close and spoiled me, kicked me out as soon as I told them about Hisashi and my baby. They had never been this angry, even when my nightly activities from high school came out. Who knew breaking the law was less of a disgrace than a pregnancy!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, it isn\u2019t my fault the bastard broke the protection and now we\u2019re bringing a little life into the world. In order to save face for my future child, I did something I promised I\u2019d never do: I married someone I don\u2019t love. Hisashi seems nice enough, but Sho warned me at our wedding that the man wasn\u2019t to be trusted. I scoffed at my former partner, thinking the man was harmless; He is just a businessman, and I am a former vigilante and one of the best information analysts on the web.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIzuku stopped there with a gasp. His mother was a \n\nvigilante?! \n\nHis sweet, doughy, mother? And an analyst? Well that last one was believable as her \u2018online writing\u2019 freelancing always brought favors and the analyst \u2018Green Viper\u2019 stopped working around the time their shop opened. The user was less moral than Izuku was in their posts and frequently sold to both sides depending on the past. And yet those skills were being used so differently now.\u00a0\n\n\nHe remembered his mother walking him through the bare bones of how to breakdown situations and people at the same age most children practiced reading comprehension. At the time he assumed (as all children do) it was just for his future as a hero or something. Well it certainly aided his future in the end!\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nFiguring he\u2019d dwell on that later (and find out which vigilante his mother was exactly), Izuku pressed on. The next entry was dated almost a year later, right after his birth.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIzuku joined us several months ago. He\u2019s the most perfect baby in the world, I can already tell he\u2019ll do something amazing, and it\u2019s not just my motherly love speaking. Every time I look at his blotchy face, hope fills me. It\u2019s like my past doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter about the people I killed, or that Hisashi is a villain.\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right, the man hangs around those I used to hunt. Then again, am I any better? Vigilantes are illegal, and I killed twelve villains in my time. Promising to never kill again does nothing for my guilt. Every face haunts me\u2026 until I see my Izuku. He\u2019s so innocent. I promised myself I\u2019d keep him out of my world, never let him see the delinquent his mother was. Never let him see the Green Viper who just last week ruined a Yakuza boss\u2019s rival for enough money to settle hospital bills, and who gleefully thanked the man for promising her a favor whenever she wished.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn the end I\u2019m just a different kind of villain than Hisashi, aren\u2019t I? Will Izuku be like his parents?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo, Izuku must grow up pure. If only I\u2019d listened to Sho, though. Hisashi knows about my past and threatened to post my vigilante identity if I told anyone about his \u2018friends\u2019. The man thought I didn\u2019t know about him\u2026 maybe I should have killed him quietly. No, chances are his murder would bring to many questions, and I promised never to kill again. Asking Sho to kill him would feel like I failed, like I can\u2019t even manage my own problems.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTurning the page was another entry, this time from around the time Izuku turned two.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nHisashi left on a job in the States. Izuku cried for a couple of days but I was relieved. We made a deal that he stays away and sends money in exchange for me not telling anyone. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement, as our respective skeleton filled closets are always ready to swallow us if we let our guard down.\n\n\n\nOh, Izuku is crying again for that silly All Might video. Doesn\u2019t he realize he won\u2019t be like All Might?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIzuku blinked, but the grineed at the next statement.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nHe\u2019s going to be a million times better!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHearing Eri starting to wake up, Izuku continued reading at a faster pace, before arriving at an entry towards the back, dated soon after that horrid doctor appointment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIt\u2019s official: I\u2019m a monster. There\u2019s no redemption for me now, helping save \n\nthat man \n\nfor Izuku to get a quirk. How can I look Izuku in the eyes knowing I helped find and kidnap the infamous \u2018Dr. Fate Breaker\u2019? This is bad, but when Sho called, I couldn\u2019t turn him down. He was my rock, my crush as a child, my partner\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nDr. Fate Breaker, the only reason the Yakuza remained in power in Northern Japan during the rise of heroics. His quirk, known to be some kind of \u2018ultimate healing\u2019 ability managed to to heal anyone of any injury- including himself- with just water, hence the moniker \u2018fate breaker\u2019. The man had been in hiding, and was employed by every Yakuza syndicate while evading police like a slippery snake. Izuku\u2019s mother had him do a report about what he thought happened to the doctor when everyone else thought he died. Looks like his prediction of kidnapping was right.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI couldn\u2019t say no when Sho called crying, begging for a favor to save his Sensei. Sho and Inko, the unstoppable vigilantes, taking down five crime rings when they were barely 15. That was us. That was me. That was Sho. But then he left to follow that man, the man known to steal quirks and torture people for enjoyment. I washed my hands of him when Izuku was born.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBut then he called. And I caved. Using Green Viper, I pinpointed where the Chinese heritage yakuza surgeon, \u2018Dr. Fate Breaker\u2019 had retired to and helped Sho kidnap him. I helped hold the monster down while the dying boogeyman Sho served ripped the quirk out. And when the boogeyman used a five hundred liter bucket to make himself unstoppable again despite that wound from All Might, I bowed and left to make Katsudon for Izuku. All I could think about was about using it to make Izuku happy!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAgain, I am a monster. As I write this, even my tears can\u2019t hide the joy and disgust I felt at seeing my old friend, though he fell so low.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSho Kurogiri, why did you ask me to sell my soul? And why did I say yes?\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAfter that last line Izuku had dropped the journal like it was full of hot coals. Spending the next thirty minutes puking bile as Eri cried thinking he was dying, Izuku had processed what he learned.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHis mother was a vigilante. A hacker. An Analyst. A helper of villains. She helped- and seemed to love- the man who was after his friends\u2019- no, family\u2019s- lives. Sho Kurogiri, of course he should have connected the dots about the \u2018friend\u2019 she\u2019d sigh about when he was younger. She would tell about her first love, how they didn\u2019t get together because of some \u2018big fight\u2019 about his choices, but that in the end \u2018they were the same\u2019. It all clicked. And a villain that fought- yet survived- All Might and could steal quirks? She helped him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u2018Mom, what do I do?\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt had taken the rest of the day to calm Eri down and assure her that no, he wasn\u2019t \u2018dying\u2019, just shocked about something. The little girl looked awfully interested in what that \u2018something\u2019 was but a quick reminder that some secrets are dangerous made her nod her head solemnly.\n\n\nNow here he was, staring down a being with the intelligence and influence to tear his world apart. It didn\u2019t matter what secrets Nezu uncovered: Eri, the Yakuza, the connection many villians (much less \u2018Sho\u2019 Kurogiri); any of them would end his happy life of stability with Eri.\n\n\n\u201cYou may be good at hiding your expressions but I\u2019m better\u201d Nezu had told him. That scared Izuku to no end. He had forced himself to be neutral but it wouldn\u2019t work if any micro expression gave him away.\n\n\n\u201cHmm, more tea?\u201d Izuku offered in the privacy of the kitchen, keeping an ear out for the door chime or customers requesting more coffee.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes please, the rumors of your brewing prowess are not without base; if anything they under exaggerate your mastery to the craft!\u201d Nezu praised. The greenette gave a pleasant smile.\n\n\n\u201cYou flatter me. I\u2019m but a simple, quirkless business owner while you\u2019re a principal to a prestigious academy.\u201d A tactic his mother taught him: flatter while providing an avenue for the customer to brag about themselves. It will lead them away from unpleasant topics.\n\n\u201cAh, ah, ah, I know your strategy Izuku-kun, I can call you that right? I know so much about you from my staff it feels as if I\u2019ve come here multiple times instead of this being my debut.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course, Nezu-san. Anything for a customer. And I am rather confused as to what strategy you\u2019re referring to? I never attended highschool so my uncultured brain has to be reminded of things.\u201d Internally Izuku was panicking while going through any other ways he could distract Nezu from\u2026 basically anything.\n\n\u201cAnd yet you graduated at twelve from middle school and are the reason Kirishima-kun hasn\u2019t failed out of school yet if the rumor mill is to be believed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes, Kirishima tends to run his mouth and exaggerate what his \u2018boss\u2019 can do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNormally I\u2019d agree but even the bright Shinsou-kun talks about you leading him through every big assignment they\u2019ve had so far. Don\u2019t sell yourself short, Izuku-kun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLike you do with the media, ne?\u201d Izuku countered, pointing to the fact the chimera was known to stay in the shadows and let rumors spread that there was a shadow power in charge of the school and that Nezu was just a figurehead. No matter how unfounded or racist those claims were, the principal used them to sink his jaws into the shadier side of politics.\n\n\n\u201cNow that would be telling. And a waste of our time.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs is this senseless battle of words.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFair. Then let\u2019s stop dancing around why I\u2019m here. You fascinate me, Izuku Midoriya. Your independence, integrity, cunning intellect, all are above the standards of society. However, I couldn\u2019t help but notice you have some problems I could assist on. How would Eri like to go to regular school instead of working? Or to have a full time employee, maybe let you attend a prestigious academy? All I would ask is for your special \u2018talents\u2019 be available for whenever UA needs them. This includes but is not limited to\u201d Nezu was cut off but a firm- but polite- tea cup slammed onto the table by an irate Izuku.\n\n\n\u201cMind your own problems before you talk about mine, \n\nrat.\n\n\u201d The coffee shop owner looked livid. How dare this privileged ass try to play him in such an obvious manner.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Beady eyes blinked. Neither noticed the quiet in the cafe, several pairs of ears now trained on the conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t care for what you\u2019re implying, Izuku-kun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Midoriya-san to you, Nezu-san. I may be working to the bone to keep this place afloat and my little sister happy, but we are in no need of your attempts to procure my \u2018talents\u2019. If you wish to employ my services you are aware of the channels, as you\u2019ve used them before. You have no right to walk in here and try to snoop around like I\u2019m your own personal puzzle. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed the listening devices you\u2019ve placed under the table or on my counters. Now, I kindly ask you to desist these games and either be a normal customer or leave.\u201d Izuku pauses to drop the devices with a clank on the table, crushed. Nezu had the decency to look sheepish\u2026 and terrifyingly impressed. A beat of silence rang in the shop, with the UA staff being slack jawed at the sound of their Midoriya losing his cool yet still being polite.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThen a clap echoed loudly from Nezu\u2019s paws, a delighted expression on his snout.\n\n\n\u201cMy, my! I\u2019m impressed, most impressed! You pass, Izuku Midoriya!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Waz\u201d Izuku lamely blurted out. His hidden file on all the dirt (however meager) he could find on Nezu stuck in his jacket intended to ensure silence was forgotten in favor of blinking rapidly. \u201cWhat test?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, just my minor hazing project to accept personal consultants! Congratulations Izuku Midoriya, with your discretion and skills, it would be my pleasure to ask for your help in tracking down the League of Villains and put a stop to them once and for all.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI refuse.\u201d He stated simply, not liking how close it would put him with detectives and other figures (mainly Nezu) who would very much like to know how a super villain that is probably supposed to be dead (All Might did fight him, one doesn\u2019t simply survive that man if they don\u2019t go to prison) is at full health and able to steal quirks. Based on what Izuku knew of the \u2018Nomu\u2019 that attacked UA from Shouta, the same man his mother foolishly helped was behind it. That\u2026 was not something he wanted to be involved in. Already Izuku wished he could just wash his hands clean of the whole mess, but the League did have to get caught.\n\n\nAnd they would be. By Dekiru and anonymous tipping.\n\n\n\u201cDoes this change things?\u201d Nezu slid over a rectangular piece of paper while sipping tea. On it were a \n\nlot \n\nof zeroes. As in, the amount Izuku made yearly on the site. \u201cThat\u2019s the monthly pay.\u201d\n\n\nThis made Izuku whip his head up and pause. It would make the case go faster, and Nezu knew his secret. Being close to him would keep the focus off other subjects, but how to frame it was the question.\n\n\n\u201cSign a nondisclosure agreement and a promise to stop trying to spy on us and it\u2019s a deal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy, what spying?\u201d The chimera quipped even as he produced a signed and dated agreement, complete with a written promise to not look into where Eri actually came from.\n\n\n\nThe little rat knew.\n\n\n\nSeeing Izuku\u2019s face pale to ash Nezu smirked.\n\n\n\u201cRat got your tongue?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cH-how?\u201d\n\n\nBefore answering Nezu led Izuku outside to the alley, away from prying ears or eyes. The door slams, before the chimera looked up with an almost sympathetic smile.\n\n\n\u201cNext time don\u2019t claim a mutant type child with a powerful quirk comes from two very weak emitter quirk parents, one of which hasn\u2019t been in the country in twelve years and the other hasn\u2019t left it in fifteen. Makes it rather hard for conception to happen. I won\u2019t ask where she came from or why you seem to keep her out of the public eye. But whatever it is, know that UA\u2019s protection will extend to you.\u201d That was a surprise to the host, not used to the way Nezu\u2019s mind plays worked or how he could switch roles so easily.\n\n\n\u201c... Thank you.\u201d Izuku bowed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAnd I thank you, Midoriya-san. Your analysis will help us catch these monsters. I won\u2019t make you stop your other work or projects, but UA needs Dekiru\u2019s best. Please aid us.\u201d Receiving a firm nod in return, the pair went back to the main area of the shop, with a stern look from Nezu keeping the teachers from questioning it.\n\n\n\u201cWho wants more coffee?\u201d With Izuku\u2019s chipper question the invisible tension dissipated and warmth returned.\n\n\n\u2026 Only to be replaced with chaos when an \n\nextremely \n\nhyper Eri practically dragged Kirishima and Bakugou through the door, an ice cream cone dripping down her hand.\n\n\n\u201cNii-san! We had THREE whole ice cream cones and hamburgers!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...You did, did you?\u201d Izuku knelt down and patted Eri\u2019s head, figuring he would just make the idiots play with her to burn that extra energy; there\u2019s a reason one doesn\u2019t let small children get sugar highs. Already the \u2018babysitter\u2019 duo looked dead, and Izuku was keeping the glee off his face over how they\u2019d feel after they burned her energy up.\n\n\n\u201cYEP! Now I\u2019m suuuuper happy, can we have a dance party?!\u201d She begged.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYEAAH, DANCE PARTY!\u201d A certain blond parakeet screamed. The babysitters tried to scoot out but Shouta caught Izuku\u2019s look and blocked the door.\n\n\nNot one to deny his sister anything he patted her head.\n\n\n\u201cOf course, but I\u2019m busy right now. Why not take your new \u2018friends\u2019 and Cockatoo- I mean Yamada-san upstairs? Your favorite song is already in the disk player.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWoah, really?!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, now shoo!\u201d Up the child ran leaving Bakugou looking ready to explode and Kirishima crying.\n\n\n\u201cBoss, that was so unMANLY!\u201d The red head wailed.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unmanly is breaking Eri\u2019s sugar limit. You disobeyed my instructions, and now you have to live with the consequences. Now. UP.\u201d Dejectedly the worker walked up, with snickering from the teachers lighting his way. Yamada thankfully took Bakugou with him as well. Soon the bane of Izuku\u2019s existence started playing, though the security video he pulled up on his laptop for the shop to enjoy made it worth it.\n\n\n\u201cI am so keeping this for blackmail\u201d Aizawa sighed blissfully.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYoung Midoriya, are you certain this isn\u2019t...invasive?\u201d Yagi-san fidgeted but kept watching.\n\n\n\u201cYagi-san, Yagi-san, Yagi-san. It\u2019s my apartment.\u201d Izuku pointed out.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you have security camera in your living room why exactly?\u201d Power loader and Midnight asked in unison.\u00a0\n\n\nBoth Izuku and Nezu blinked as one, answering together.\n\n\n\u201cThe question why \n\nwouldn\u2019t \n\nyou have one?\u201d\n\n\n---\n\n\nMeanwhile, Katsuki Bakugou learned the meaning of true pain.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWe wonder are you ready to join us now! Hands in the air we will show you how, come and try! Caramell will be your guide!\u201d Eri, Yamada-sensei and Kirishima danced with gusto, belting out the sing along off key. How the voice hero failed so terribly at singing would forever be a mystery.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nBakugou wanted to puke. Worse was his inability to say no to Eri brightly leading him through the moves.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nSo there he was, a top student at UA, champion of the Sports Festival, waving his hips and hands through the air.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cCome and sing! Oa, Oa, Oa.\u201d The prideful genius monotoned. The only consolation was that Deku wasn\u2019t there to see.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cLet\u2019s do \u2018Let it Go\u2019 next!\u201d Eri suggested. Suddenly dying by disney seemed very plausible.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n----\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cProblem Child.\u201d Shouta groused over his coffee, long after the others- minus the \u2018dancing troupe\u2019 as the private Pro-hero discord was calling the video. Eri\u2019s face had been obscured but the scene was still golden. The duo had been discussing the conversation with Nezu, and how the creature could have unraveled Dekiru\u2019s identity.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cShouta-san. I\u2019m...working with you now, officially that is.\u201d Nezu had agreed the underground hero would make a fantastic contact. If possible the man looked even more done.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOf course I\u2019d be given more work. So what case is the rat making you help on? My Yakuza case? Or the UA child abuse case for Bakugou?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThe LOV elimination case\u2026.\u201d Izuku admitted. Shouta took a deep breath, then slumped down in the couch.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell fuck. I\u2019ll never be rid of you.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cHeh. Yeah\u2026 Shouta-san, not that I don\u2019t enjoy your company, but why are you in your sleeping bag here?\u201d He deadpanned while ignoring the jibe. However he was already pulling out the thick files on the League Nezu left with instructions to be ready for a discussion in a couple days when the Principal returned.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cJust knowing I\u2019ll have more work because of you, Problem Child, makes me too tired to move. Wake me in the morning.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201c...I feel you\u2019re abusing my hospitality.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTell that to my sleeping bag, Problem Child.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nChapter 7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPlease, Nii-san- I mean Tickle Guy! I surrender, stooop. MERCY!\u201d A childish giggle mixed with a whine in the early morning filled the Rainbow village.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHah, but I\u2019m the super villain \u2018Tickle Guy!\u2019 Mercy is not in my vocabulary, and after you\u2019re gone all the citizens of Rainbow village will bow before me. Now die foolish little hero!\u201d A voice distorted under an apron tied around the \u2018villain\u2019s\u2019 head cackled it went for the killing blow: the feet. The villain prepared for victory. It was so close, just another step.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cW-wait, Tickle Guy! I, Princess Unicorn, use my force fields to make you freeze.\u201d The newly named \u2018hero\u2019 declared. Tickle Guy stopped mid air. \u201cGood! Now you are captured by my sparkle scarf of justice.\u201d Princess Unicorn wrapped the villain up and started to celebrate.\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I have been defeated. Woe is me vile hero.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFear not citizens! For evil has been defeated!\u201d Clapping could be heard from behind Princess Unicorn, courtesy of the grateful \u2018citizens\u2019. \u201cNowww\u2026. Time for breakfast.\u201d And the scenario was broken. Princess Unicorn took off her mask and bath towel cape to become Eri Midoriya, picking up the \u2018citizens\u2019 who became her regular plushies.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright the muffins should be ready; don\u2019t forget to wash your hands.\u201d \u2018Tickle Guy\u2019 called as he took off the apron mask and capture scarf. Out stepped Izuku Midoriya, who followed the off key singing to the kitchen for food. Soon the sun was fully risen and breakfast done, Eri taking to coloring. Izuku balked at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re running late kid; grab your backpack and let\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t colored the eyes yet!\u201d She pouted, already shooting off to grab her backpack. Izuku had to drop off the Dekiru analysis before visiting his grandparents in their new retirement home. He never bothered to know them before and would rather let them die without ever meeting him. At the funeral, everyone was so numb and the pair so distraught that he avoided them despite the looks given. He let the lawyer act as the mediator, and oh did Izuku wish he could do that once more.\nBut they had answers. Like which vigilante his mother was, seeing as there were literally a hundred different vigilantes operating around the time his mother did. Unraveling it would take time, time better spent taking the league out of commission.\u00a0\nSo he\u2019d swallow his pride and ask. According to the diary they knew about his mother\u2019s activities but didn\u2019t disown her until she got pregnant, meaning they were valuable sources of information. Thankfully Nezu\u2019s gracious pay allowed for the shop to close down for a day without real losses. Izuku refused to hire a full time worker- at least not until he had to- but the extra financial cushion was a nice change. At this rate Eri could attend middle school and high school, specifically the all female one just two train stops away.\nHe couldn\u2019t let some punks try to woo his innocent sister, after all.\n\u201cDone! Ready to go.\u201d Eri cheered. While Izuku would rather her stay near him, having her interact with his mother\u2019s parents would be unwise. Thus, he\u2019d be setting her up in a secure hotel room next door to the retirement facility complete with a makeshift security camera, a taser (homemade during craft night) and a cellphone with everyone on speed dial. If anyone even looked at her door, he\u2019d know.\n\u201cEri\u2026 did you REALLY need to pack that many plushies?\u201d Bulging out of the zippers were at least ten animals and heroes. In fact, it was so crowded that Eri had her taser (disguised as camera) around her neck and the tablet she got for her birthday clasped in her hands. One could tell it belonged to his little sister by the sheer volume of stickers on it.\nWell at least she wouldn\u2019t lose anything.\u00a0\n\u201cNevermind, let\u2019s get going. Remember what we talked about?\u201d He asked as they started walking towards the train.\n\u201cStay in the room when you go do your \u2018super secret adult stuff\u2019 and don\u2019t answer the door.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if someone tries to get in or hurt you?\u201d\n\u201cScream and press the panic button on my phone! Then taser them in the no-no place.\u201d The last addition was Shouta\u2019s doing, as the man thought it prudent to teach a small child taser techniques.\u00a0\nThat earned the hobo hero a home cooked meal.\u00a0\n\u201cCorrect, Princess Unicorn.\u201d On the train ride mothers and grandparents cooed over the adorableness that was the Midoriya family playing I spy. Eri always picked a cloud that looked like her kangaroo plush while Izuku seemed fond of birds or aircraft. Sibling pair spent the entire time laughing, not aware of the terrors night would hold.\u00a0\n----\nIzuku sat across from the pair of imbeciles who disowned his mother, keeping the polite yet aloof air he\u2019d been taught. Yuki and Raido Akatani looked a mixture of awkward and sheepish at his sudden appearance in their lives. Good, in Izuku\u2019s opinion they deserved worse. His mother might have mended their relationship before she passed (if the pair\u2019s wailing at the viewing were to be believed) but that didn\u2019t change their past actions.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so much, since\u2026the funeral.\u201d Yuki- his grandmother- managed. Her green hair was highlighted by runny streaks of white, accented by deep wrinkles and baggy skin. It hurt, seeing as the woman greatly resembled what he imagined his mother to look like. Even the signature ponytail he grew up seeing was present.\n\u201cYes, and into such a fine young man; that shop your mother left you has continued on?\u201d Raido, a stern looking man of pure white hair and muscles not completely degraded, asked. His tone was light but held an edge.\n\u201cIt is sustaining my family.\u201d Was all Izuku said on the matter. The coffee in his hand tasted like ash despite being his special brand brought as a gift.\n\u201cThat\u2019s excellent! Yuki and I were hoping to have met you at the funeral, you and the girl- what\u2019s her name again?\u201d\n\u201cEri.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Eri-chan.\u201d Raido rubbed his chin in thought. \u201cI must say we\u2019re surprised you chose now of all times to visit, long after Inko died from overworking with that blasted heart condition. Being a mother having to support children is hard, and my daughter was told warned as a teenager not to have children- her health was never the best, you see.\u201d\u00a0\nAh. There it was; they blamed his mother dying on him and Eri. Many people did, thinking that having two children and running a coffee shop led her down the road of many single parents, literally collapsing from overwork. Her sickness was a private matter though- not something he felt the need to spill. And even if he did, they\u2019d find some other way to blame the \u2018quirkless son\u2019 and \u2018small needy girl\u2019.\nScrew them, in Izuku\u2019s words.\n\u201cShh, Raido! We talked about this\u201d his grandmother whispered harshly. While she seemed repentant for Raido\u2019s outburst she didn\u2019t seem too keen on saying Inko\u2019s death wasn\u2019t Izuku\u2019s or Eri\u2019s fault.\nIt was, he knew it was. But they should have the tact to not say it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine, Yuki-san; All Midoriya members know how to take unjust prejudice and anger. We are most excellent hosts, afterall.\u201d All was said with a smile yet felt like venom judging by the looks on their faces.\n\u201cW-why you! How dare\u201d\n\u201cOh apologies! Did I say that out loud? You must understand, as someone not able to attend high school, I never learned tact. Working with my dear mother after she was  stupidly disowned causing us to learn how to support ourselves took too much of my energy growing up.\u201d\nTense silence filled the air, taut with accusation. Neither side breathed or dared to break eye contact. Finally, Yuki, his technical grandmother, broke the unofficial competition.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell us why you\u2019re here dear? We all know it isn\u2019t for a reunion. And certainly not for the coffee, delicious as it is.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot as good as Inko-chan\u2019s\u201d Raido muttered. He was silenced once more with a glare.\u00a0\n\u201cThat is acceptable.\u201d Izuku\u2019s coffee was carefully placed on the table and the infamous journal was pulled from his suit jacket. He had considered dressing in \u2018street clothes\u2019 but seeing how put together he looked compared to the shells of people in front of him made the stuffy suit worth it. He had bad fashion outside of work, but did his grandparents really think horizontal stripes went with wave patterns? \u201cTell me about my mother\u2019s vigilante career.\u201d Cups clattered on the table, coffee pouring everywhere. Wordlessly Izuku pulled out his spare cleaning rag and wiped it up with a blank expression.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what you mean by that dear.\u201d\n\u201cOh I think you do, seeing as- and I quote- \u2018weren\u2019t as angry, even when my nightly activities from high school came out. Who knew breaking the law was less of a disgrace than a pregnancy!\u2019 Now why would my mother say that? Later on she mentions being on a \u2018vigilante duo\u2019 with a childhood friend.\u201d\n\u201c...What do you want with us, boy?\u201d Raido clenched his pant legs.\n\u201cI want the truth; no lies or half-assed attempts at covering the past up. You will tell me, it\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d Izuku let that ring out. The ball was in their court. If they refused, he'd have to do things the hard way, or find another method to extract their information.\n\u201cFine. Inko was\u2026 was a special child, ever since her quirk manifested.\u201d Izuku raised an eyebrow, knowing his mother always talked about how \u2018weak\u2019 her telekinesis. Yuki sensed his disbelief and snorted. \u201cThat girl was a master at getting the other children- or really anyone but us and her friend- to believe she could only pull one pound at a time, even if her limit was about ten. While still nothing to write home about, our Inko\u2026 she was so  clever about how she could use her quirk. Inko kept her quirk quiet, wanting to become an underground hero with her childhood friend, Sho.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they? Why\u2019d they become vigilantes?\u201d He asked quietly.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause a hero killed Sho\u2019s father.\u201d Yuki said tonelessly. Izuku sucked in a breath. That would make anyone want to destroy the system.\u00a0\n\u201cWorse was that bastard made those government dogs cover it up, taking \u2018early retirement. A so called \u2018hero\u2019 killed a good man because that man tried to stop him from shooting a robber.\u201d Yuki patted her husband to stop his rant.\n\u201cYou see, Izuku, Sho was taken hostage by a bank robber who had already escaped several attempts at capture; the hero couldn\u2019t\u2026wouldn\u2019t\u2026 wait for backup; he wanted the credit. His attack would have hit Sho, even if it would have been non-fatal. Sho\u2019s father, Ranpo, took the brunt of the attack, an electric bolt. He died five days later in a coma.\u201d\u00a0\nHeroes were not infallible; just looking at Endeavour's property damage was enough proof. But rarely did one, even one looking to gain more fame, justify hurting a civilian to take a villain down. Yuki\u2019s continuance made him rise from his thoughts.\n\u201cRanpo\u2019s death broke the two, as he was an uncle figure for Inko.\u201d\n\u201cBut our baby girl still wanted to help people. Inko signed up for a local highschool claiming she wanted to be a business woman, but at night she\u2019d go out with that boy to stop crime. The brats never got caught either, even at their high point.\u201d\n\u201cAs her mother I  knew something was wrong during her first and second year- she stopped letting me in her room for talks and insisted she did her own laundry. I thought, and hoped, she was dating Sho. It was always our hope they\u2019d get together.\u201d\n\u201cBut you found out she was a vigilante, right?\u201d Was his mumbled question. Both nodded.\u00a0\n\u201cShe came home after they took out two rival gangs in a war, bloody with three broken ribs and a concussion; Sho wasn\u2019t much better. We patched them up and the truth came out. Our daughter and the boy who was our unofficial son were the vigilantes I\u2019d seen plastered on the news: Green Ripper and Void.\u201d\nShit. She just had to be that vigilante, the genderless, emotionless fighter that would hide in the rafters and \u2018rip\u2019 the hearts out of a villain if they were truly irredeamable or throw weapons at them and rip them harshly from the wounds, worsening the bloodloss. The vigilante- his mother, Izuku\u2019s mind supplied- was only given the moniker \u2018green\u2019 by their green handled weapons. Void, their suspected partner in crime, would open blackish voids in the room, allowing knives to fly out randomly. As far as he knew, Green Ripper suddenly went off the map around his mother\u2019s sixteenth birthday. Void stayed on alone, becoming more and more bloody before disappearing shortly after Izuku was born. Even today their case was famous, and Izuku remembers reading about them in his modern quirk history class.\nYuki took the pause to get up from their couch and walk to a floorboard. She kicked her heels three times to release the mechanism. As the board lifted, the older woman picked up a book and cradled it to her chest.\n\u201cThis\u2026 this was our daughter\u2019s diary from her three years in that life. After she stopped and let us help her, she gave me this as a show of trust. Sho, though, kept going out; we tried to help him too but the boy was on a mission. But they stayed close, even as Inko focused on school and wanted to go to school.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut then Hisashi came in the picture, and he wooed my baby girl away, bringing her home one day with a possitive pregnancy test. And my baby girl wouldn\u2019t listen to reason, wouldn\u2019t agree to give the baby\u201d\n\u201cYou mean me\u201d Izuku cut in dryly.\u00a0\n\u201cEr, yes, you. She wouldn\u2019t give you up and go to college, insisting she could \u2018manage\u2019 raising you, even marrying that bastard. Sho tried to talk her out of it- he loved her like a man should, you see here- but Inko was always stubborn and for some reason wouldn\u2019t marry Sho. The boy said he\u2019d stop being a vigilante for her! I don\u2019t know what made her refuse him but I know it had something to do with you. Sho left and we- I-\u201d Raido cut off with a coughing fit from over exertion.\u00a0\n\u201cWe made a mistake, dear. Inko made us so disappointed, and in our rage\u2026 we told her to leave and never come back except if she gave you up.\u201d\nIzuku wanted to scream. He wanted to protest in outrage for his mother. Mouth opened up, ready to flay them alive, and maybe drain their bank accounts secretly out of spite.\nBut then the people who were his grandparents broke down crying. Mutterings of \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and \u2018We tried to find her\u2019 could be heard from the couch. All accusations died in his throat.\nYes, they did an unspeakable thing, thinking they could control their daughter, probably out of fear she\u2019d become a vigilante again.\u00a0\nAnd yes, they clearly thought something he had no control over- his birth- was the cause of all their problems.\u00a0\nBut they were a product of circumstances, bundles of bitterness bred from tragedy. Izuku couldn\u2019t bring himself to hate them. No, he pitied them with all his heart.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take my leave now. Thank you for the information and the journal. Good day.\u201d Izuku bowed and left the still sniffling pair while ignoring his grandmother\u2019s feeble protests. He walked through the building, not remembering doing so.\nOutside the retirement facility Izuku allowed a few tears to escape before turning his tablet on to check on Eri. His little sister was sleeping on the hotel bed surrounded by stuffed animals, causing him to smile.\n\u201cEri, Eri, Eri; you know not to leave your tablet on while you sleep\u201d Izuku chortled with humor. Knowing she\u2019d be out for a few hours, Izuku decided to make his delivery first and bring back dinner. They were planning on leaving in the morning, so tonight he\u2019d allow them to watch bad My Little Pony Heroes reruns and let himself get centered.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about mom right now, Izuku; wait till you\u2019re home. Then you can unravel everything.\u201d\nWith determination and numb emotions the shop owner began his pre planned route in the late afternoon sun.\n----\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t- ack!\u201d Dust covered the rooftop as Shigaraki disintegrated an unlucky janitor assigned to water the plants on the edge. Honestly, the senseless bloodshed disgusted Kurogiri.\nWas this what he wanted? To let innocents be slaughtered just to further a goal? In his early twenties, he would say yes.\n\u00a0In his teenage years he was a young man hurting from his only parent being murdered and watching the perpetrator walk away with a cushy retirement.Sho would only kill villains, staying in a righteous mindset that it was better to kill the bad guys before they caused more problems. Things started looking better when highschool graduation grew near, with Inko\u2019s family supporting his decision to stay a vigilante.\nThen Inko broke his heart. Sho Kurogiri\u2019s other half, the woman he promised to stop being a vigilante that went after villains, refused to marry him or let him help raise her unborn child. Her reasoning? Sho had killed a civilian woman who tried protecting her husband, a notorious murderer. The woman was in the way...so Sho made her not a problem.\nInko had been disgusted with him, as she should have been, saying he was becoming just like the bastard that made them vigilantes. But Sho Kurogiri, with his eighteen year old pride, insisted it was necessary, that she could have been in on it too, that all those fleas deserved to pay. Inko called him a villain- said he could do better- and tossed him out her bedroom window while he refused to see her again in his rage.\nAfter that was a ten year haze of taking care of his Sensei, proclaiming that \u2018if you say I\u2019m a villain, I\u2019ll be a villain\u2019, even if he kept tabs on his childhood friend.\u00a0\nBy the time he realized Inko was right and regretted his life, it was already too late; Sho Kurogiri was too far in the dark to ever live in the light again.\n\u201cKurogiri stop spacing out like an NPC; when are my Nomu going to be ready?\u201d The pale teen Kurogiri was somehow serving under whined.\n\u201cThey are going through final checks as we speak Master Shigaraki and should be ready by sundown.\u201d\n\u201cGood, kuku; Hosu will burn tonight with the screams of hero filth.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 God, how did he let himself fall this low? Even now mustering up pity for the soon to be dead citizens was hard; he really was heartless.\n----\nTwo hours after his walkout Izuku was running through the streets in determination. Fires suffocated the air around him, giant creatures- Nomu, he remembered- attacking heroes and civilians alike. To Izuku, the apocalypse appeared to have come judging by destruction just two Nomu were causing.\u00a0\n \u2018Make that three\u2019 He mentally deadpanned after dodging a large rock thrown by a flying Nomu. He had to get back, back to Eri. Already he had texted Shouta and Nezu, getting permission to hunker down at a local agency\u2019s emergency bunker. A sidekick was going to meet him at the hotel to pick Eri up, who was thankfully still asleep and not near the attacks- for now, at least.\nAlong the way Izuku fought his instincts to help every civilian who tripped or got caught in their car. But those instincts won out, as he found himself opening multiple stuck doors before darting off once more.\n \u2018Okay no more heroics Izuku! The Nomu could turn at any moment, you   have   to get to Eri.\u2019 \n\u201cTHIS IS FOR MY BROTHER!\u201d Arose from a nearby alley. Izuku intended to run past while sending a message to the local hero hotline- maybe nine one one- as he had other responsibilities.\nBut there was so much blood. Shinsou and Kirishima\u2019s classmate, the turbo kid Iida Tenya, struggled to stand with blood pooling from his arm. His back was to Izuku but the shop owner could tell; the boy was on a warpath. Closer to Izuku was the hero Native, pinned to the side wall by a knife to the shoulder. The hero pleaded with his eyes for him to leave, and Izuku could see why: Stain was the one Iida Tenya stood against. Thankfully his angle near a dumpster kept him hidden, meaning he could feasibly follow the hero\u2019s silent orders.\u00a0\nLogic dictated Izuku back out and call the heroes or run to get help. He was a civilian after all who had a sister sleeping in their hotel room unaware of the chaos. But he was a hero at heart. And heroes helped those in need, even idiots out for revenge.\nSending a text to Shouta with an awkward \u2018send help to my location, Stain killing your student and Native\u2019 was probably less than tactful, but Izuku didn\u2019t care; he had a serial killer to stall.\n----\nMeanwhile, a  very  done with life Shouta Aizawa resisted the urge to smash his phone in frustration after fulfilling Problem Child\u2019s suicidal request. Really, why did the idiot have to go to Hosu of all places? On the  night of a major villain attack? Honestly if he wasn\u2019t on a train heading to the madness (after rushing the bust, leaving a horde of traumatized criminals and police) Shouta would have bolted across the rooftops to scold Izuku himself. The hero knew he had to be rational, however, so instead he settled for calling in more heroes to keep Problem Child and his foolish student alive.\u00a0\nR E: sorry I deletrd the repete chapter! Thanks for letting me know.\u00a0\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku his heroic tendencies as he crouched behind a dumpster, knowing the chances of him winning a fight were less than zero. He had nothing but his dish rag, his mother\u2019s journal, and taser out of juice from being used in helping previous trapped citizens. That left distraction, but how does one distract a serial killer with ideological tendencies? An idea formed in his head but was interrupted.\n\n\n\u201cJust another fake \u2018hero\u2019 boy; you\u2019re just like your brother. Now, die!\u201d Stain snarled. Izuku bolted from his spot, tossing the broken taser between Iida and Stain. Native looked on helplessly as the blood loss threatened to take away the hero\u2019s consciousness.\n\n\n\u201cWhat in the world\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho the \n\nhell\u201d \n\nStain\u2019s and Iida\u2019s surprised yells overlapped. Izuku slowly walked past Native, holding his hands up in surrender.\n\n\n\u201cInstead of killing children, misguided and unheroic as they are, why don\u2019t we \n\ntalk \n\nlike the civilized people we are?\u201d Keeping his voice gentle, the greenette gave a kind smile that didn\u2019t match his poison green eyes that glowed in the moonlight. Both sides of the alley seemed shocked; it\u2019s not every day a death match is halted by a teenager in a suit, after all.\n\n\n\u201cTsk; there\u2019s nothing to talk about, \n\nboy; \n\nI don\u2019t have time to waste on civilians- and judging by your lack of muscle and\u2026 clothes, that\u2019s what you are- now scram.\u201d The Hero Killer seemed ready to dismiss him. That simply wouldn\u2019t do for Izuku\u2019s plan of keeping everyone alive.\n\n\nAccording to what Shouta had told him and his own sightings while fleeing, Endeavor and other heroes were in the area. Shouta would get someone here, Izuku just had to last until then. The greenette moved to rebuttal Stain, only to be interrupted by the brat who caused this mess.\n\n\n\u201cWhile I do not wish to agree with such a monster, I must in this case! Civilian, please leave immediately while us heroes take care of this villain.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0Izuku walked up to the revenge obsessed teen and wacked him with his dish rag, earning a snort from Stain.\n\n\n\u201cFirst off, my name is Izuku Midoriya, \nnot \n\u2018civilian\u2019, and second: I don\u2019t see any active heroes currently, seeing as you\u2019re an intern and Native is now passed out from his wounds. This no villain verses hero fight that I\u2019m seeing; No, what I see is a child trying to go against someone far above them in the name of vengeance.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe almost killed my brother! That monster deserves to die!\u201d Iida shouted back.\n\n\n\u201cYes, your hero brother. While Stain-san here can\u2019t seem to see he\u2019s going about his \u2018revolution\u2019 all wrong, you don\u2019t get to break the law or your brother\u2019s morals just because you\u2019re hurting inside!\u201d\n\n\nStain let out a deep, malevolent chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a Midoriya standing in my way; first your mother saying I was \u2018misguided\u2019, and now you. Izuku, you said your name was? Mind \u2018enlightening\u2019 me on what I\u2019m doing wrong?\u201d The tone was mocking but curious. Izuku swallowed his questions about yet \n\nanother side \n\nof his mother being revealed and instead gave a small bow.\n\n\n\u201cWhy certainly, Stain-san; did you know that the instant you killed or maimed those \u2018fakes\u2019 you immortalized them, turning them into martyrs for hero society?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d Both hero student and Hero Killer sputtered. Honestly, they synced so well for men trying to kill each other. Izuku sighed dramatically and rubbed his chin in thought.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true; in the three months since your first victim died, there have been four books in the works about his life, two documentaries, and countless \u2018memorial merch\u2019 that includes everything from his heroic phrases to cosplay; children are wearing the merch, adults view them as someone to remember. Really, all you did was take a shady hero being investigated for spousal abuse and put them on a pedestal.\u201d Giving a \u2018what can you do\u2019 shrug he continued. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to kill a student, whose death will make the Igenium name even more famous. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they put a statue up in remembrance. But\u2026 I guess if you want to destroy what little support you have in the common folk, be my guest.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nStain blinked.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, little Midoriya? You and your mother, always tearing others down with your words.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell it \n\nis \n\nless bloody than knives, and far more effective. That\u2019s proven by your hesitance now to strike Iida-san down.\u201d\n\n\nThe alley filled with bloodlust; Stain seethed at the boy now blocking his way. Inko was just like him, always scolding him when he played her for information. Every one of his three encounters with the woman- two online and one offline when he stupidly let a thug shot five rounds into his chest.\n\n\n\u00a0It was his early days of being a vigilante, not even a month after he dropped from Shiketsu to rid the world of crime and fake heroes. His first target, a small drug ring, kept eluding him. For weeks he\u2019d bust into warehouses once filled with drugs, empty before he or the police showed. It frustrated him to no end, until the underground forums whispered of an informant willing to give you any intel\u2026 for the right price, of course.\n\n\nShe had been working for the drug ring, and Stain finally managed to catch one upper guy to torture. It took a few days but eventually he got the contact information. All his savings went into it, but he paid her fee before the gang could up their price.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nHonestly, if he hadn\u2019t met Inko after the gunshot wounds with her calmly telling him her name with a list of everything she\u2019d do to him if he ever spilled or so much as googled her name, he\u2019d think she\u2019d be the perfect partner in the crusade. Being scolded like a child and finding threatening messages in your home (despite moving three times a month) really put a damper on the whole \u2018trust\u2019 aspect a partnership required.\n\n\nStain blinked back thoughts on the memories, focusing on the boy in front of him. While Inko never physically attacked him (did having a knife aimed at your balls count as motivation or attacking?), she was still dangerous. If the brat was anything like her, Stain had to be careful.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\u201cWhat would \nyou \ndo then?\u201d Stain seethed.\n\n\n\u201cSlander their names online and post incriminating evidence.\u201d Izuku said with a kind smile that looked eerily like Satan asked for tea.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s most unbecoming and\u201d Iida\u2019s rant was cut off by a sharp glance.\n\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019d drain their bank accounts, funnelling it into a fake mafia account while setting them up to take the fall, all while drinking tea.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 are a very terrifying individual, brat.\u201d Stain finally admitted. What the man didn\u2019t know was that he did just that to the Eight Precepts, only he just posted their overseas account transactions, not fabricate them.\n\n\nThe shop owner hummed and stepped back while dragging Iida along. Stain blinked in surprise.\n\n\n\u201cAnd you are officially captured, Stain-san\u2026 or should I say Akaguro Chizome?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nInstantly fire came from above, cutting Stain off but striking right where Iida used to be. Said boy paled at the thought he was almost incinerated.\u00a0\n\n\nIzuku winced as a spare burst of flame licked his arm.\n\n\n\u201cAre you alright, citizen!\u201d Iida exclaimed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou little shit!\u201d Could be heard from behind the flames. Shouta\u2019s scarf whipped from above, Endeavor making sure the serial killer couldn\u2019t escape the alleyway.\n\n\n\u201cY-yeah; don\u2019t worry I\u2019ve had kitchen burns worse than this.\u201d Izuku assured despite the blisters arising.\u00a0\n\n\nBoth teens took to watching Shouta and Endeavor dodge a volley of knives and kicks (though Iida still looked ready to jump in despite having a look of shame). Ice covered the ground around the pair, and Kirishima\u2019s classmate Shouto Todoroki landed with a graceful thump. Duel colored eyes and rough scar peered at them, flicking over to Native\u2019s collapsed form.\n\n\n\u201cWhat. Happened.\u201d Todoroki ordered, not asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to know that too Problem Child.\u201d A very irate and out of breath Shouta Aizawa growled. His boot was shoved into a bloody and burned man\u2019s face loosely resembling Stain. Apparently Shouta didn\u2019t feel like showing mercy today, Izuku mused.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Shouta-san! Funny story, that is.\u201d The erasure hero sighed, adrenalin dying.\n\n\n\u201cYou know what? Nevermind, I\u2019ll hear it at the hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t need a hospital.\u201d Izuku pointed out. A snort sounded from Todoroki, who quickly acted like it didn\u2019t happen and helped Iida walk towards the arriving ambulances, Native being treated with care by paramedics.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not even going to try to argue with you Izuku. We\u2019re going to the hospital where Eri is and that\u2019s final.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho is the dead piece of scum that sent my little sunshine to the \n\nhospital?!\n\n\u201d Shouta was immediately reminded of the footage of Izuku taking Bakugou down. By this point the police had quietly arrived and took the infamous Hero Killer into custody. Shouta sighed and grabbed the kid he stupidly grew attached to (and no, it wasn\u2019t all because of the coffee), dragging him to a waiting police vehicle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Problem Child; shaken up when a fourth Nomu crashed into the building, but all right. Eri\u2019s getting a check up and you\u2019re getting the burn treated. Not to mention a check for smoke inhalation and witness statements.\u201d Shoving Izuku in the back gently, Shouta climbed in and motioned for the rookie to drive. Being an underground hero with a face of death had its perks.\n\n\n----\n\n\nIzuku was in a daze when he walked through the emergency doors, the ordeal catching up to him.\n\n\nHe talked a serial killer down. He \n\nsassed \n\na serial killer! What was he thinking?! And Eri, Eri would have been all alone if he died!\n\n\nSpeaking of his angel, Eri was sitting on a bed with a breathing mask held to her face, nurse giving her pats. She looked dead and scared, making Izuku\u2019s heart break from across the crowded floor of the injured.\n\n\n\u201cEri.\u201d He swore he barely whispered but watery eyes met his own. Instantly she bolted through the room, Izuku kneeling so she could land into his arms. Siblings cried together while Shouta awkwardly walked away to get Izuku put on the waiting list.\n\n\n\u201cNii-san; I- I was so scared! I thought you died, nobody would tell me anything. You didn\u2019t come back for me.\u201d Eri\u2019s muffled sobs drenched his shoulder. Izuku hugged her tighter.\n\n\n\u201cI know, Eri-chan. But know this: I will \n\nalways \n\ncome back. It\u2019s my promise to you, to always be your hero, your big brother.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cY-you promise?\u201d Still her face was glued to his shirt.\n\n\n\u201cLike I said before, I promise. Always and forever.\u201d\n\n\n----\n\n\nThey- Izuku and Iida that is- ended up being scolded by detectives. More so Iida, as citizens in a crisis- quirkless ones especially- have certain leeway in good samaritan laws. Plus Izuku never threw a punch. Iida though\u2026.\n\n\n\u201cAgain, I feel I must apologize! It\u2019s my duty as a hero in training to put the greater good before my wants, and I\u2026 failed in that duty yesterday. If Endevour-san\u00a0 and Aizawa-sensei hadn\u2019t taken the credit and hid what I did from the media, I wouldn\u2019t be a hero anymore. Midoriya-san, please accept my most humble apologies and awe, as you clearly were acting like a hero!\u201d Chopping motions accented the words, making Izuku sweatdrop. They were with Shouta in Iida\u2019s hospital room, the boy wanting to apologize before Izuku took Eri home to binge watch a million disney movies.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t being a hero back there.\u201d Izuku replied, and held a hand up to stop Iida from refuting his claim. \u201cNo, I really wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a hero for one person only, and that\u2019s just her love for me speaking. I wasn\u2019t acting like a human, I was acting like a \ndecent human being.\n\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cW-whatever do you mean by that? That was beyond heroic!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 Iida-san, being a \u2018hero\u2019 is just a phrase society uses without any concrete concept. I can\u2019t be a hero; I\u2019m a business owner, quirkless, and relatively untrained; but I always find myself living by an old proverb. I don\u2019t always succeed, in fact often times it\u2019s my own selfish love for my loved ones that prevent me from living by it; but that\u2019s beside the point. Would you like to know what the proverb is?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes\u201d Iida whispered.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather simple, really: to know what is right, yet choose to do nothing, that is the mark of the coward who lost what makes them a decent human being. Maybe you need to stop looking at making yourself a hero, and focus on just being a person not afraid to help and do what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s hard. Maybe next time, you won\u2019t look to get revenge but instead protect your mentor. Just a thought, good day, Iida-san, Aizawa-san.\u201d With a bow, Izuku walked out to meet a beaming Eri.\n\n\n\u201cSensei\u2026 I don\u2019t think I understand, not fully.\u201d Iida admitted.\n\n\nShouta looked at his student, choosing to speak for the first time.\n\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s fine; you\u2019ll have plenty of time to reflect the meaning during your two week suspension and six week detention.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnderstood. Thank you for not expelling me, Sensei.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me; I had your drop forms filled out. Izuku Midoriya, however, used a favor to convince me to keep you on, heavens knows why.\u201d Shouta muttered the last part, still not convinced letting a child who tried to Rambo a serial killer stay was for the best...no matter how convincing Izuku was. \u201cIf you want to thank him, he needs free labor at his shop for the next two weeks.\u201d\n\n\nIida stood gaping as he was basically told to go work for the boy who saved his life and career. A business card with Midoriya\u2019s shop address hit him in the face.\n\n\n\u201cOh. And mess up my coffee while there\u2026 not even All Might will save you.\u201d The ominous warning was all Shouta said before leaving, intent on catching up to Izuku and chewing him out the entire train ride home.\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTenten-chan, more stirring!\u201d Eri ordered while puffing out her cheeks. She stood on a stool, directing her slave- er, trusted helper.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cYES TINY BOSS!\u201d Iida bellowed out while whipping the batter. Meanwhile, Izuku laughed from the register. The customer that accepted two cups of coffee to go joined in.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI swear, Midoriya-san, you really picked an...interesting helper.\u201d Asahi Rei chuckled. The quirkless man was dressed in a fashionable suit and no longer held the air of depression he had all those nights ago.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cAh, yes. He\u2019s a welcome change in the evenings. How is Tanaka-san treating you?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTerrifying. Every day my life flashes before my eyes.\u201d The man said, pale. \u201cBut... he\u2019s the best boss I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you. Now he\u2019s your complimentary bagal to celebrate three months being hired.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019ll pay for the bagal if you tell me what your quirk is.\u201d Rei tried. Izuku just shook his head and sent the grumbling man on his way.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWhile Izuku didn\u2019t outright hide his status, only close customers, friends, and Eri knew he had no quirk. Everyone else seemed to think he had a coffee God quirk or was some cryptid.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nA voice laughing at him made Izuku realize he said that last sentence out loud.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cThose would stop if you didn\u2019t ominously know what to say in every situation, little listener!\u201d Yamada boomed as he pulled Shouta in.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cTiny Boss! We must wash our hands FIVE TIMES according to the excellence of this prestigious establishment.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cI swear you kept him on to spite my sanity, Problem Child.\u201d Shouta growled while pulling out his sleeping bag. Izuku gave an innocent smile.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOh, whatever do you mean? Hiring him this past month was the best stroke of genius I\u2019ve had in \n\nages \n\nbecause he\u2019s clearly qualified for it.\u201d He lied through his teeth. \u201cWhy would I try to spite you? After all, it\u2019s not like you tried hacking into my phone seven times to put a tracker on it, or had Nezu put a \u2018necessary\u2019 alley camera aimed right at my window. And it\u2019s definitely not like you snapped a tracking cuff and listening device on my ankle complete with a taser button for anyone who took it off that required my unique skills to get off safely.\u201d Shouta stared at the grinning boy before snorting.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cWell you haven\u2019t broken the rules of drop off since. And once again, no Hizashi, you aren\u2019t being told about them.\u201d Shouta tacked on from habit.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cOne of these days you\u2019ll spill, Shouta! You too, little cryptid!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm? Coffee, anyone?\u201d\n\n\n----\n\n\nIt happened on a Saturday. The birds were singing, his underlings were handling the shop, and the League had been quiet. A rare treat, the Midoriya siblings took their game of heroes verses villains to their park.\u00a0\n\n\nAs always, Princess Unicorn stopped the fiendish Tickle Guy from overthrowing the queendom, this time saving the \u2018summer gala\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes! Fall to my mighty sparkle scarf!\u201d Eri ordered. Izuku groaned as he lay \u2018defeated\u2019 beneath her. All was right with the world.\n\n\nAnd then he spotted a portal. A small, purplish mass that only one person possessed, in the shadow of the slide meer feet away. The playground was eerily silent, empty. No witnesses, Izuku realized.\n\n\n\u201cEri prepare to run.\u201d He whispered and rolled away just as Tomura Shigaraki leapt from the portal, four fingers out. Izuku landed and was up, holding Eri while his eyes darted around.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cKuku, for an NPC you\u2019re pretty fast; must be your mother\u2019s influence.\u201d Tomura giggled. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to worry, we just need to borrow the brat, have her use her quirk for a...project.\u201d Tomura cackled.\n\n\n\u201cHell no, now leave.\u201d Izuku slid Eri behind him, already pushing the panic button on his watch, the one device he let Shouta monitor.\n\n\n\u201cPlease, Izuku-kun, hand the child over and she\u2019ll remain unharmed.\u201d Kurogiri blurted out, looking desperate. Funny, when Izuku imagined the man from his mother\u2019s journals, he didn\u2019t expect this gentleman behavior, or nervousness. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d\n\n\nIzuku threw the cape he had been wearing for the game right at Kurogiri and pushed Eri to run to the bushes behind them, knowing from his calculations and analysis of Kurogiri\u2019s quirk that Eri could (hopefully) make it to the street before Kurogiri caught sight of her.\u00a0\n\n\nTomura was apparently done with the nice guy act and lunged at Izuku before Eri could even process what she was supposed to do. Izuku found himself lifted in the air, the pinky dangerously close to landing on his neck as Tomura held him. One tiny twitch and he\u2019d be dead.\n\n\nWell at least Eri ran, right?\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you, and Sensei didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t kill you exactly. He might be mad, but surely Sensei will understand! Who knew Green Ripper gave birth to such a weakling, right Kurogiri?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShigaraki! Put him down immediately!\u201d Kurogiri ordered, menacing. Tomura scoffed.\n\n\n\u201cKnow your place. This is just an NPC, nobody will miss him, and then we\u2019d have the useful sibling for the League permanently- with no \u2018family\u2019 obligations.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cEri\u2019s only being employed for her quirk, no harm will come to either of them, Sensei promised me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell he\u2019s in our way, so he has to die. You\u2019re not even a little bit cool, NPC, so your death means nothing. Back off Kurogiri, before you join him!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Izuku-kun.\u201d Kurogiri backed away. The fifth finger dangled over the artery in Izuku\u2019s throat. He closed his eyes, accepting his fate.\n\n\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d Eri screamed. All motion stopped. \u201cJust...stop! I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd why does that matter?\u201d Tomura sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re a pawn,\u00a0 I\u2019m taking you either way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf Nii-san dies I won\u2019t help you! I- I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll kick and scream and not help you!\u201d She said firmly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cSensei could just take your quirk, brat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t, not with the drawbacks it has.\u201d Kurogiri muttered.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cY-yeah! Drawbacks. Let Nii-san go\u2026 and I\u2019ll do what you say. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Tomura seemed to think on it before nodding to himself and throwing Izuku onto the ground, pinning him with a boot.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cE-eri no.\u201d He wheezed.\n\n\n\u201cShut up NPC, you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t want to make Sensei disappointed. Fine, unicorn pawn. We came for you, not him, anyways. Kurogiri, take the girl and let\u2019s go before the heroes show up.\u201d\n\n\nTomura flippantly broke one of Izuku\u2019s ribs with a snap, followed by breaking his right leg. Izuku only glared at the villain.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just so you don\u2019t follow us. Who knows, if she\u2019s useful enough we might just let you two visit when we reform this cursed society.\u201d Without a second glance he stepped into the portal.\n\n\n\u201cEri-chan, say goodbye.\u201d Kurogiri mumbled. Eri looked from the open portal to her brother.\n\n\n\u201cE-Eri. Sho...please. If you ever loved my mother, let her go.\u201d Kurogiri flinched and turned his head.\n\n\n\u201cQuickly your goodbyes.\u201d\n\n\nEri took a deep breath before looking at him with tears.\n\n\nThanks to you... I got away from the Yakuza. Thanks to you and momma I had a happy place... but most of all...you showed me what it was like to have a papa. Thank you Tou-chan.\"\n\n\nThose words froze Izuku\u2019s world. Everything seemed to stop, even time. The mist around Eri grew thicker, and her last words would haunt him for all time.\n\n\n\u201cYou were my hero, now I\u2019m yours; Princess Unicorn saves the day, Izuku-niisan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWith that they were gone after Kurogiri tossed her tracking bracelet to his stomach, and Saturday became the day Izuku\u2019s heart shattered.\u00a0\n\n\nHis sweet angel.\n\n\nHis little sister.\n\n\nHis most precious person. The child he and his mother gave \neverything for.\u00a0\n\n\nThe pain kept him in a haze, and it wasn\u2019t until Shouta showed up that Izuku\u2019s eyes started leaking. It would be hours before He would notice that along with Eri\u2019s tracking bracelet, Kurogiri had thrown hope.\n\n\n----\n\n\n\u201cAnd this is the adopted one, the child you said could rewind someone\u2019s internal clock?\u201d An amused voice chuckled, staring at the tiny, crying girl through the monitor of his computer.\n\n\n\u201cYes, and she\u2019s the key to ridding the world of diseases known as quirks.\u201d Another, younger voice griped.\n\n\n\u201cAh, ah, ah, careful; I may have gotten you out of prison, but I can just as easily rip you limb from limb; do not insult me again. All Might is our target.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd then I get the girl.\u201d The younger one prompted.\n\n\n\u201cYes, yes, you can have her, so long as she does what I need and I get her qurik later. While I may not want it in my body personally, there are so many pawns I could force it on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow long then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPatience, Chisaki Kai; I\u2019ve waited two hundred years, you can wait a few days. By then I\u2019ll have completed my final goal.\u201d\n\n\nAnd after that, All For One will be unstoppable.\n\nChapter 9\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\u201cAnd this is the adopted one, the child you said could rewind someone\u2019s internal clock?\u201d An amused voice chuckled, staring at the tiny, crying girl through the monitor of his computer.\n\u201cYes, and she\u2019s the key to ridding the world of diseases known as quirks.\u201d Another, younger voice griped.\n\u201cAh, ah, ah, careful; I may have gotten you out of prison, but I can just as easily rip you limb from limb; do not insult me again. All Might is our target.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then I get the girl.\u201d The younger one prompted.\n\u201cYes, yes, you can have her, so long as she does what I need and I get her quirk later. While I may not want it in my body personally, there are so many pawns I could force it on.\u201d\n\u201cHow long then?\u201d\n\u201cPatience, Chisaki Kai; I\u2019ve waited two hundred years, you can wait a few days. By then I\u2019ll have completed my final goal.\u201d\nAnd after that, All For One will be unstoppable.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen Nezu received word that his analyst\u2019s sister was kidnapped, he had just started his fifth cup of tea while reading through the meeting notes once more. Before that phone call arrived, it had been his favorite brew.\nOver the past several weeks, he and the ever polite Izuku had narrowed down the League\u2019s motives, their member lists, and came to the conclusion their targets were holed up somewhere between the Hosu and Kamino wards (though nothing they would narrow it down further, to Nezu\u2019s chagrin). Nezu had been quite impressed- if not slightly uneasy- with how intelligent his temporary employee was.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFlashback:\nIzuku Midoriya glanced at him nervously, the dim lights of the long closed cafe made his eyes pierce the room even more than usual. Nezu suppressed a shiver of excitement and foreboding.\n\u201cI have some information!\u201d Izuku had blurted out suddenly, producing a six inch thick file folder, sliding it to the principal. Nezu blinked.\n\u201cThat...is impressive, Midoriya-san; I was under the impression that we'd be doing a brainstorm session tonight.\u201d This caused the green haired teen to blush sheepishly.\n\u201cYes, well\u2026 I just had a thought: UA captured over a hundred villains at the USJ incident, and at first glance they appear to have been recruited from across northern Japan, with no real pattern.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Nezu replied, already beginning to open the file folder.\n\u201cHowever!\u201d Izuku got an excited gleam in his eye. \u201cTake out the outliers and you get a belt shaped area of recruitment, most heavily near Kamino and Hosu.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not possible- there are two other \u2018belt shaped\u2019 areas in a district to the north and one just blocks from UA.\u201d The mouse like being pointed out. Izuku smirked.\n\u201cOh, those weren\u2019t the main recruitment spots, based on the timeline of when each group was inducted. The first group- we\u2019ll call it the Kamino-Hosu group- was inducted first, three weeks before the raid. These are comprised of villains that suit Shigaraki\u2019s style more- brutal, blood thirsty, without a cause- and seemed to be the most reluctant to say anything besides when they were approached about the job. The second area, the one to the north, is larger (if only just) and has less blood thirsty villains. These guys all said during interrogation they met Kurogiri or Shigaraki about a week before the attack and it was done on their turf. Shigaraki didn\u2019t have them meet in one spot, nor did he inspire trust in them as they were just told they\u2019d get money.\u201d Izuku paused for breath, and Nezu took the opportunity to add his two cents.\n\u201cPerhaps Shigaraki didn\u2019t want to let those in the second area to congregate in his main base, and the first group wouldn\u2019t have talked either way as none of them were considered for plea bargains- all from Kamino-Hosu were on the run or suspected of murder, rape, or other \u2018hard crimes\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, except that\u2019s the point: they were all criminals unable to be out in the open, with us only able to confirm their supposed links to the area using scattered police sightings. They had protection- longer than those three weeks too- and were the more adept bunch. Now, the third group, we both know they were recruited the day of the USJ, and thus there is no way they could be where his base is.\u201d\n\u201cNot true, he could be hiding under the radar\u201d Nezu chided, knowing they weren\u2019t. At this point he was testing his analysts\u2019 abilities. Izuku, in turn, snorted.\n\u201cYeah right, Nezu-san; there are now sensors to detect a warp quirk within a quarter mile of UA and far too many hero watches that make keeping a base unrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course. We will roll with your theory on it being somewhere in Kamino or Hosu, but that still leaves twenty square miles of city to narrow down.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, but twenty miles is barely anything, what when you have every traffic camera on your side, ne?\u201d Izuku grinned evilly. Nezu cackled, tea spilling.\n\u201cI knew there was a reason I liked you, Midoriya-san! I believe between the pair of us, the LOV stands no chance.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, Nezu-san. Now, let\u2019s talk about the quirks.\u201d Here Izuku pulled out a file labeled \u2018Kurogiri\u2019, a flash of pain in his eyes.\n\u201cMidoriya-san?\u201d Nezu raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cN-no, it\u2019s nothing. Anyways\u2026 did you know there is a formula for Kurogiri\u2019s quirk? And Eri, back to bed!\u201d He called suddenly to the stairs. A squeak and muttered \u2018how does he DO that\u2019 were accented by feet running back to their warm bed. The \u2018adults\u2019 shared a chuckle and resumed their work in gusto.\nEnd FLashback\u2026\nThose weeks of working out the kinks of their search and dissecting their enemies were among the most enjoyable in Nezu\u2019s career. It was rare to find anyone so dedicated, polite, and genuine as Izuku Midoriya, he was a real gem.\nSo when the call came in that the teen was at the hospital being healed, and that Eri Midoriya was taken by the monsters they were tracking, Nezu\u2019s blood boiled. With zero regard for decorum he ran out the door, intent on being involved in the case, and promising himself that every UA hero- and any others he could round up- would do their best to bring the little girl home. If not for her sake, then for Izuku\u2019s.\nAnd his fifth cup of tea, once his most favorite brew? Why, Nezu doubted he\u2019d ever be able to stomach the filth again; it tasted like ash.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen Bakugou got the word about his little pipsqueak being kidnapped, he had been trying on new shoes, courtesy of his new guardian.\nMidnight-sensei- Kayame-san she insisted- was Izuku\u2019s idea, and Bakugou would never admit he liked having her as a foster mom. The crazy lady was stupid, and kept trying to make him blush- which he never did!- but she wasn\u2019t mean. And she worked with him on his quirk.\nNot to mention his shoes. They were built for his quirk specifically, in case he needed to use it while out of his uniform. Deku- Izuku, he reminded himself grumpily- had pointed out that his feet could use his explosions, and Midnight-sensei wanted him \u2018prepared\u2019. Able to slide the soles back with a push of a button, they wouldn\u2019t be ruined like his last three pairs, and he didn\u2019t have to file for permission to take his combat pair for his costume off of school grounds.\nSo everything was going perfectly\u2026 until Midnight\u2019s phone rang.\n\u201cYeah?... WHAT! Shouta, calm down and explain.\u201d Long curses from his lazy sensei followed, though Bakugou couldn\u2019t hear. He ignored them, looking at a pair of unicorn boots for Eri, thinking of how he could make shitty hair go along and say he bought them for her, since there was no way in hell Bakugou would give the brat a gift. None at all.\n\u201cKatsuki\u2026.\u201d Midnight\u2019s voice, filled with tears, jerked his attention back to the conversation. She looked broken.\n\u201cYeah, hag?\u201d He gulped. She ignored it, meaning it was serious. Shit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Eri.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the brat?\u201d He tried to play it off as nothing, even as he let out a spark and dropped the boots.\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 She\u2019s gone Katsuki.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s when Bakugou\u2019s world stopped, much like Izuku\u2019s.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen Eri\u2019s kidnapping reached the coffee shop, Hitoshi was just serving some mint tea to grumpy Tanaka while the old man complained about his clothing shop being under appreciated. Kirishima meanwhile tried his best to help Iida in the kitchen, but the pair was hopeless at it and Hitoshi feared what his Boss would think.\n\u201cYer just a snot nosed brat, so you wouldn\u2019t understand, but nobody appreciates the finer seams in pants. Isn\u2019t that right, boy!\u201d Tanaka barked. His assistant, a timid man named Rai or Rei (honestly Hitoshi didn\u2019t care enough to remember) bobbed his head with vigor.\n\u201cY-y-yes sir!\u201d\nHitoshi rolled his eyes as he returned to the counter.A regular came in, looking like a jittery squirrel. Hitoshi dreaded this guy\u2019s order.\n\u201cWelcome to Midoriya\u2019s, what can I get you today?\u201d The purplette droned, already bracing for the answer.\n\u201cTen shots of espresso, on the dot!\u201d Yeah. The man, a twenty something engineering student, had the audacity to order espresso, and only espresso- not even coffee or milk- every afternoon. Boss seemed indulgent and would smile, but Hitoshi refused; the guy was shifty, as anyone who had that much espresso and still lived was not to be trusted. However, he fulfilled the order and watch the guy literally buzz while stumbling out of the shop. Taking a minute to get over the sacrilege of the afternoon, Hitoshi winced at the loud bang eminating behind him.\nHis two underlings for the day- there\u2019s no way Boss would let anyone but him be in charge, right?- bolted out of the kitchen with somehow edible cookies.\n\u201cShinsou-kun! We have endeavoured our hearts to make sweets that align with our fine establishment\u2019s standards!\u201d Ah. That was Iida. Maybe Hitoshi could ignore him? But no, he had a job to do.\n\u201cIida, stop shouting in the shop. You know Boss hates it. And Kirishima...why is your hair white?\u201d Hitoshi drawled. The pair grinned and moved to respond when one of the regulars gasped and dropped their coffee. Hitoshi whipped his head around, and the customer- a woman known for not showing emotion- was openly crying while looking at her computer screen.\nCurious, Hitoshi stalked over, intent on cleaning up the mess and finding out what made the usually emotionless woman cry. When he saw the news feed with a picture of Eri Midoriya smiling, his stomach clenched. And when he read the caption, describing her kidnapping?\nWell, Hitoshi saw red. But that\u2019s okay, as he was sure the entire shop was willing to help him get away with murder, based on their expressions.\nNo mercy for these scumbags, after all.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShouta Aizawa was having a good day, in that he was napping in his apartment with the AC blasting, and no brats were waking him up to teach seeing as it was summer. Cats surrounded him, both in dreamland and reality, and the erasure hero felt as if nothing could spoil it.\nSo when Izuku\u2019s panic button went off on his phone, Shouta felt dread. A filthy bile, ominous and foreboding, settled in his throat. Activating the location he darted to where his kids were, alerting the heroes and cops in the area on the way. Within twenty minutes he landed in a park surrounded by cops.\nWhat he saw broke his stony expression; Izuku, staring at the sky listless, clutching a rib while bones protrude out of one leg. Crime tape was being erected around the park\u2019s perimeter, though the paramedic attempting to talk to Izuku was looking worried at the lack of response.\n\u201cProblem Child.\u201d He breathed. No response. \u201cIzuku\u201d Shouta said sharply, hoping to snap the teen back to reality. It worked, as poison green eyes darted to meet his. Tears instantly started pooling.\n\u201cA-Aizawa-san. T-they\u2026 they took her! They stole my sister.\u201d Gut wrenching sobs escaped and on instinct Aizawa knelt down and gently hugged the teen, his own shock taking over.\n\u201cShh. It\u2019s going to be okay, we\u2019ll find her. We\u2019ll find E-Eri\u201d He stumbled over the little girl\u2019s name, the name of someone who made everyone\u2019s lives better with just a smile. The underground hero crushed the urge to spiral into despair; he had to be strong for his kids. \u201cI need\u2026 I need you to tell me who attacked you.\u201d Izuku lifted his eyes once more and spat with venom.\n\u201cIt was the League of Villains. The bastards who stole my Eri- it was them.\u201d\nAnd Shouta Aizawa felt ten years older. The one group of villains that managed to elude them, who amassed an army with monsters capable of taking All Might, those were the monsters he had to take down.\nSo much for a peaceful weekend before summer camp.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIzuku felt his awareness click in the moment Recovery Girl kissed his injuries away, and absently stuffed five gummies in his mouth. He furiously wiped away his tears, mind racing with the facts of what happened.\n\u201cSorry for being out of it; thank you for coming to the hospital, Recovery Girl.\u201d Izuku said politely. She gave him a sad smile and a pat on the hand.\n\u201cNo thanks needed dearie; you and Eri have done wonders for us all, it\u2019s the least I can do since\u2026\u201d She trailed off, only to shake her head in anger at the situation. \u201cAnyways, Aizawa-san should be back in a few minutes. Rest up until then.\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m fine, I need to get to Nezu, we don\u2019t have much time! Eri\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already here Midoriya-san!\u201d Nezu popped in the doorway, effectively stopping Izuku\u2019s frantic ramblings.\n\u201cNezu-san!\u201d Izuku looked relieved. \u201cIt was Kurogiri and Shigariki, they took Eri.\u201d Here Izuku hesitated. He knew he needed to explain some things about how and why the League wanted an innocent six year old child, but Recovery Girl was in the room.\n\u201cYes, and I bet we need a private talk\u201d Nezu gave a meaningful look to the healer. With a huff and warnings to rest the woman left, clicking the door shut behind her. \u201cNow, something tells me you have an idea about why Eri was taken- something to do with her miraculous birth between your parents across continents.\u201d\n\u201c...It\u2019s her quirk, you see.\u201d\n\u201cOh? What\u2019s so special about little Eri-chan\u2019s quirk? It\u2019s a unicorn mutation I believe.\u201d Here Nezu was intrigued despite the circumstances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018unicorn mutation\u2019. Her quirk...it can turn back any living organism\u2019s internal clock. It\u2019s so powerful she could turn someone back to not having a quirk, or even...erase them from existence. That\u2019s what happened to her father, before her mother sold her to the Yakuza for the price of a plane ticket out of the country.\u201d Fist clenched, Izuku reflected on the scumbags who used his precious little one for months before he spotted her on that fateful shopping trip. \u201cI happened to see her a couple of years ago, filthy and in a hospital gown. Without thinking I ran with her home, where my mother helped cover her past up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Yakuza group?\u201d The rodent asked while ignoring how a supposed poor shop owner had the connections to pull the identity switch off- Dekiru had many connections, but fake ID making didn\u2019t seem to be one of them.\n\u201cI manipulated their arrests; The Eight Precepts of Death were my first large project, actually.\u201d Nezu\u2019s fur paled to translucent, face slackening. \u201cEh, Nezu-san?\u201d\n\u201cWe were going to cover it up- the Hero Commission that is- until I had a chance to discuss the breakout with you and make a plan to stop public panic, but\u2026 sixteen hours hours ago an unknown warp gate broke into the prison Kai Chisaki was being kept in and aided his escape.\u201d\nIzuku sucked in a breath. This changed everything.\n\u201cShit.\u201d He uncharacteristically cursed. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? First the League, and now a Yakuza madman who can destroy anything with barely a touch.\u201d\n\u201cWe will do all that we can- we WILL find her, that I promise you.\u201d The green eyed teen buried his face in his hands as Nezu got up to make a phone call. He had no leads, the kidnappers threw her bracelet at him, meaning no tracking.\nIt was as if the world swallowed all his hope. Reaching down to his pocket, he pulled out the tracking bracelet, smiling a watery grin at the unicorn sticker Eri insisted on sticking to the band. Then there was a scratch on the glass from her dropping it on the sink, not to mention the cute little micro SD card taped to back-\nWait, micro SD card?\n\u201cWhat in the\u201d Izuku murmured, and then it hit him- Kurogiri. The sly villain had given him something. What it was, Izuku could only guess.\n\u201cProblem Child, are you alright?\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice broke Izuku\u2019s hyper focus. An even wider grin, this time of hope, stretched across his face as he met his favorite customer\u2019s eyes. \u201cEri\u2019s bracelet\u2026\u201d The man observed.\n\u201cNo, hope. It seems Sho-san isn\u2019t a complete traitor to my mother after all.\u201d Aizawa just stared, completely puzzled as his kid pulled a laptop from thin air and started typing away like the hounds of hell were upon him.\n\u201cOh, you little shit; you think having this weak of an encryption key on your card would keep me out? My my, so overconfident.\u201d Izuku chuckled darkly, making the underground hero remember that while his kid was generally a pacifist coffee shop owner, he was also a demon.\nAnd demons knew no rules when it came to getting what they wanted.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCracking into the data proved easy- tedious, but easy considering everything his mother taught him. The six hundred characters coded message? Easy as kindergarten mudpies. Following said message to the live security footage of Eri getting smacked by Chisaki Kai?\nHardest thing he\u2019s ever had to witness. Her \u2018room\u2019, dingy and dim, reminded him of the nightmares she used to describe while screaming, flashbacks consuming her before he or his mother could calm her. Even two years later, Izuku would find the little sunshine crawling into his bed with whimpers of past horrors. He kept watching the footage, eyes taking in every aspect of the room, as Kurogiri appeared and started telling off Chisaki. His eyes widened when the mist villain dropped a bag of \u2018Bleeding Burgers\u2019 in front of Eri.\nThere was only one Bleeding Burgers.\n\u201cCan we track this?\u201d Izuku could hear Aizawa demand from Nezu, who was already at his own laptop while making calls. Neither had seen the scene, and when Izuku looked back, Kurogiri (and the bag) was gone. He heard something about it taking twenty hours to unscramble the location, that they would need to get to the better computers at UA, that so called \u2018experts\u2019 would be able to do it.\nBut Izuku couldn\u2019t care less about that. His eyes were focused on the information Kurogiri had either intentionally or unintentionally given out (Izuku desperately hoped it was the former, since a small part of him wished the Kurogiri his mother had loved was still in there).\nHis mind worked through the algorithm of where Kurogiri could be based on the bag; Bleeding Burgers had one location (with excellent food), at that was at Kamino.\n\u201cWhat will you do when you have the location?\u201d Izuku asked quietly, checking his ribs to make sure they were completely healed. One of the officers heard him as Aizawa was still busy.\n\u201cEh don\u2019t worry kid; we\u2019ll find out where the tyke is, and launch an investigation. Kidnapping cases like these, we take em slow since the villains want them alive- we go careful so she doesn\u2019t get hurt. She isn\u2019t in immediate danger.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s already been hurt! We need to get her home immediately!\u201d Izuku argued.\n\u201cWoah woah, stop worrying kid. You\u2019ll have her back by the end of the week at the latest- we just don\u2019t want to rush things and waste the heroes\u2019 lives\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYammamoto shut up!\u201d The lead investigator barked, not having heard the stupid (and rather false) observation by the rookie. The Eri kid had ties to Aizawa, and when that man had someone taken from him the police were quick to get that person back; the man was the best hero they had for underground work and angering him due to bureaucratic red tape was not in the investigator\u2019s best interests. The investigator, a portly man in his forties with an intelligence quirk, dragged the rookie to another room to get updates from Aizawa, who was verbally grilling the police chief for immediate permission to do whatever necessary to get Eri home today.\nBut Izuku didn\u2019t know this. His world was crumbling, and rational thought was few and far between. So, with grace bought with years as a coffee shop owner he left the room silently. After checking out at the desk and stopping home for what he needed (without alerting the mass of worried customers and workers), Izuku disappeared into the wind, his phone left on his desk with a note.\n\u2018I refuse to lose another member of my family\u2019\n-Dekiru\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKurogiri looked at Overhaul, feeling disgust twist in his gut. He was a monster, even more so than Kurogiri himself.\nAnd he was helping him and the league break into UA.\nHe could only hope Izuku was in the process of saving Eri before Sensei\u2019s plan to lure All Might could work.\nBecause if Sensei was successful, all hope would be lost for Kurogiri\u2019s soul.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNezu growled as they tried to decode the location, the algorithm proving tedious. His teachers save the on patrol All Might sat in their spots around the staff room, each working nonstop.\n\u201cBakugou, I need you to fax this\u201d Midnight called to their most...passionate student. The boy was insisting on helping all the while clutching some cutesy trinket to his chest. Thankfully he was willing to do the tedious tasks that slowed down their work.\nSo caught up in the bickering and planning and frantic grunts from Aizawa asking where his \u2018Problem Child\u2019 was, Nezu didn\u2019t notice the shift in security.\nNot until the walls started to disintegrate before his very eyes.\nThe grinning face of Chisaki Kai met his horror struck own.\nEnd! This is part one of the All for One takedown and saving Eri. I\u2019ve had this sitting at the current word count for...like 3 weeks? Maybe? Anyways, no the story isn\u2019t abandoned, we have two chapters left! I have part of the next chapter written sooo onto the announcements!\nWill Izuku survive his plan to save Eri?\nWhat exactly is AFO planning?\nCan UA survive this?\nWill Aizawa ever openly admit that Izuku and Eri are his kids?\nWill Riku ever learn how to make a decent Eggplant Parmesan that she\u2019s failed making twice now?\nFind out Monday on \u2018THE COFFEE SHOP HERO!\u2019\n(ps. Join our discord . Shout out to Dragon my beta- may you survive this semester!)\nhttps://discord.gg/MjrNGYb\nChapter 10\nAN: So I was reading the last chapter on both FF.net and AO3, and saw that my page breaks didn\u2019t transfer. First off, I apologize, it must have been hell reading it! After I get this chapter posted I will try to get it fixed (hopefully nothing bad happens to the formatting in this one too)! To make sure no mishaps happen, I\u2019ll be showing scene changes in bold.\n****** Warning: this chapter has character deaths. Please, if you need to not read it, that\u2019s totally fine! I\u2019ve lost both my mother and sister as well as friends in the past- I get that reading death can be triggering. I kept it mild, though, so it should be fine.

His teachers save the on patrol All Might sat in their spots around the staff room, each working nonstop.\n\"Bakugou, I need you to fax this\" Midnight called to their most...passionate student. The boy was insisting on helping all the while clutching some cutesy trinket to his chest. Thankfully he was willing to do the tedious tasks that slowed down their work.\nSo caught up in the bickering and planning and frantic grunts from Aizawa asking where his 'Problem Child' was, Nezu didn't notice the shift in security.\nNot until the walls started to disintegrate before his very eyes.\nThe grinning face of Chisaki Kai met his horror struck own.\nWith Izuku, somewhere in Kamino Ward\u2026\n\u00a0When Izuku had seen Eri on that street two years ago, something in his heart just knew they were family, and Izuku always protected his family. It was like the fates had snapped a chain around Izuku, binding him to his little sister the moment he laid eyes on her. That bond, overflowing with love and protective instincts, is what drove him to his current location.\n\u00a0A dirty bar. Nothing remarkable, nothing that screamed it was the base of the monsters who would abduct an innocent child for their gain, but his gut screamed that it was the place. Well, his gut and the computer tracking he had done. While his rational side said, \u2018screw it, let\u2019s get Aizawa here to help\u2019, his big brother side couldn\u2019t stand by for help or support. Eri was inside suffering who knows what. He couldn\u2019t wait for the heroes at this point; too much was at stake.\n\u00a0\u201cNot for long, Eri-chan; your big brother is coming to kick some ass for you.\u201d He swore to the building across the street from where he was standing. Fixing the ball cap and various gadgets- including the trusty apron- Izuku Midoriya stepped off, eying the various entries he could take. Thousands of plans flittered through his mind, not all of them pretty.\n\u00a0Many had him end up horribly disfigured, more had him dead.\n\u00a0But all had Eri being safe and sound. And that was the only outcome that mattered in the end.\nWith Aizawa, U.A\u2026\n\u00a0\u201cAizawa, stop him!\u201d Nezu orders as the walls waste away before their eyes. Various teachers pair off to face the villains head on, Nemuri pulling Bakugou behind her; his angered screams echoed in the room. Aizawa was about to go to his student like a good educator when a warp gate sent them away, various villains following. Soon the battles were starting, the only villain not being intercepted was arguably the most dangerous one. Perfect, just how Aizawa like it.\nThe fact that an escaped S-class criminal decided today was a good day to attack him was a testament to how stupid villains could be.\u00a0\n\u00a0Honestly, showing up with the monsters who stole his kids? Well, Aizawa wasn\u2019t complaining if he was able to interrogate them after for locations. While that meant no killing the sick bastards- yet- he knew how to make takedowns more painful than death.\n\u00a0\u201cWhat the- ah, Erasure Head, how\u2026pleasant.\u201d The villain known as \u2018Overhaul\u2019 grimaced when his reassembling of the atoms was abruptly halted. The monster Overhaul had begun crumbled away. Aizawa gave a cruel smirk and wrapped his capture weapon around Overhaul\u2019s body, pinning his hands to his sides.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d He snarked and reached for the standard issued quirk-suppressant handcuffs on his belt. Overhaul, however, had other plans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYour quirk is beautiful, you know; the ability to erase the disease that plagues our society, even if it\u2019s for mere moments, is amazing! You and I, we could cleanse the Earth! What do you say?\u201d Overhaul got a fanatical gleam in his eye that made Aizawa\u2019s stomach clench in disgust.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll pass, you nutjob\u201d He deadpanned, using a term Problem Child called a recent villain they were analyzing. It seemed to fit the man literally shaking in front of him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cTsk, tsk. So sad\u2026oops!\u201d Overhaul chuckled. Confused, Aizawa tried to jump back on instinct, eyes still glued open. That\u2019s when it happened.\n\u00a0Pain. The all-encompassing type that being slammed into the ground by a thousand pound Nomu caused. It was the kind of pain that made Aizawa bolt up in bed at the mere shadow of it entering his dreams. It was the reason he had to take anxiety medication when the flashbacks just became too much.\u00a0\nIt was the reason he grunted- no, screamed- in agony when suddenly that pain was back, eyes flinching but still struggling to stay open. His captured scarf became slack, and Overhaul looked gleeful as he stepped out of the useless bindings.\u00a0\n\u201cThat there is my personal Nomu, given as a sort of token of goodwill between the league and I. It might not have any speed enhancers beyond, but the levitation and strength boosts more than make up for it.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re illogical if you think Shigaraki views you as more than a tool.\u201d Aizawa grunted. Instantly he was slammed once more into the ground. Ribs cracked further, but he refused to allow a second scream to pass.\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s him who is my tool; him and that fossil of a sensei will bow before me. I will reassemble this world from the corrupted filth it is into what it was!\u201d Overhaul promised. \u201cAfter Eri-chan gives me what I want, I\u2019ll be unstoppable.\u201d He added.\n\u201cShut\u2026 shut up. Eri\u2026\u201d Aizawa wheezed. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d The villain snapped his fingers, almost lazily, and the Nomu tossed Aizawa in the air like discarded trash. As he flew, Aizawa blinked rapidly, his quirk refusing to start up again with blood in his eyes. The Nomu appeared before him in a flash despite the lack of speed, body slamming the Erasure hero into the destroyed terrain. The ground grew closer and closer, blood flying into his vision.\u00a0\n\u201cPathetic.\u201d Overhaul could be heard amongst the pounding in his ears. The bored look Overhaul had spoke of the man\u2019s belief the fight was over.\nNow, any ordinary hero would have taken the fall at this point, praying either for a comrade to rescue them or a quick and merciful death. Shouta Aizawa was not an ordinary hero, nor would he ever be. Aizawa was one used to working against the odds to save those he held dear; if he failed now his kids and his friends would be in peril.\nAnd that was something he would never allow. Mustering up the strength only those fighting for something greater than themselves possessed, Aizawa flung his capture scarves. Months of focused training with his fellow heroes after the USJ incident paid off, his discussions with Izuku about projectile angles and force finally bore fruition.\nFor despite his downward spiral, Aizawa captured onto the Nomu. He allowed a fierce grin as he slowed to a controlled fall, landing on his feet like a badass. Overhaul screamed in frustration and moved to unravel the earth below.\nBut it didn\u2019t work. Despite the blood in his eyes and concussion, despite all the broken bones, Aizawa activated his quirk.\n\u201cNOMU\u201d Overhaul demanded. But this time Aizawa was ready. A Nomu without speed was like any other oversized villain he had faced; launching another scarf at the beast he used its momentum to fling it into Overhaul. The pair collided, the Nomu screeching. Overhaul stumbled up painfully, unused to injuries he couldn\u2019t overhaul.\nAizawa kept his quirk activated as he yanked the former Yakuza boss close and slapped both quirk suppressant cuffs and collar over the madman before a second passed. Overhaul moved to order his Nomu for a counter strike, but Aizawa was so done with the villain.\n\u00a0With a quick jab to the neck with a sedative all UA staff carried curtesy of Midnight and Recovery Girl, Overhaul was out like a light.\n\u00a0\u201cHave plenty of nightmares, you bastard\u201d Aizawa said to the unconscious man. His \u2018special Nomu\u2019 lay where it fell, a lifeless husk without orders. Aizawa nodded in approval before looking around the destroyed office. \u201cGood thing we have unlimited funding\u2026 hopefully. Now, time to find my student. I swear if they hurt the little shit.\u201d He muttered. Said muttering continued as he hobbled out of the room dragging Overhaul with him.\u00a0\n\u00a0Some days he really wished he had just become an accountant like his mother wanted, especially when his ribs continued to shift with every step.\u00a0\nBack with Izuku\u2026\n\u00a0Contrary to popular belief, sneaking into super secret bases was not difficult. All it took was him lockpicking the basement door and putting the cameras on loop. While lengthy and taking over fifteen minutes, it wasn\u2019t overly difficult for a teen capable of being basically invisible while delivering reports.\n\u00a0What was difficult was dodging all other forms of detection. There seemed to be no major villains in the base, which scared Izuku more than anything. But there were some. And most quirk users would be able to take him if he wasn\u2019t careful- best not let them see him.\n\u00a0\u201cHey! What are you doing here?\u201d Speak of the devil and he shall appear. A villain Izuku had researched for a blog post about those with \u2018useless\u2019 quirks being capable of evil rounded the corner. A long term criminal, Gato the Mugger literally was only able to change his skin to bright blue when angry. As such, the pathetic bastard preyed on women in back alleys, but was so clumsy he was more often than not run off by his chosen victims. Shorter than Izuku, overweight to the point of huffing after speaking his one line, and you had a villain was more sad than scary.\n\u00a0How Gato the Mugger got a job with a man who literally took quirks and ran an evil organization was beyond him. Thankfully Izuku was in shape from all the coffee he served and was able to get into Gato\u2019s space.\n\u00a0\u201cSorry, just here to deliver some pizza\u201d Izuku said before kneeing him in the throat. The villain dropped like a light, leaving Izuku alone with the body. \u201cHuh\u2026 where to put this\u2026\u201d He said while looking at the multiple rooms with various alarm pads.\n\u00a0See, this was the real \u2018problem\u2019 with breaking into a base: hiding the bodies.\n\u00a0Ten minutes later and an annoyed with life Izuku left his victim tied up in a closet, holding the half doodled map the idiot had made for patrols.\n\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 Eri should be somewhere in the next three hallways\u201d He muttered. The hallways were dim and filled with decrepit rooms. Movement caused him to duck into a random one, heart pounding.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, that is wrong; your girlfriend should support your decisions!\u201d A male voice drifted past his hiding spot, heavy footsteps accompanied by lighter ones. They stopped right outside, and Izuku\u2019s heart stopped.\n\u00a0\u201cMan, why doesn\u2019t she? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going hero or anything crazy like that! But if I want to switch from bank heists to assassinations, why should it matter if it\u2019s not \u2018as easy\u2019 for a pay out? I have just always wanted to be a hitman, yo!\u201d \u00a0Izuku stifled his urge to laugh at the other\u2019s companion. Who knew villains had dating troubles?\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a toxic relationship; couples have to be a team, dawg. If she doesn\u2019t want to stand by you, that\u2019s her loss. There are plenty of girls out there just dreaming of having a killer for a boyfriend. You\u2019ll find her.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d The voice sounded watery, like he was holding back tears. \u201cBut what if I don\u2019t?\u201d Booming laughter followed from the first voice.\n\u00a0\u201cThen we\u2019ll kidnap a chick and brainwash her, easy peasy!\u201d The footsteps started moving again along with the laughter.\n\u00a0Slowly the voices drifted away and Izuku collapsed against the door. Though close, he was safe.\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, it\u2019s only two hallways to check; you can do this Izuku.\u201d He repeated his mantra \u201cFor Eri\u201d as he rejoined the dim hallways.\n\u00a0Thirty minutes, two more close calls, and a run in with a demented guard poodle later, and Izuku was outside the last door that could hold his little sister. Taking a deep breath, Izuku pulled out his mini computer and made sure all alarm systems would be disabled. Only to see it was just a deadbolt- an unlocked deadbolt.\n\u00a0An unlocked deadbolt that opened to an empty room. Signs of his sister- an old bed, empty \u201cBleeding Burgers\u201d bag, strands of her white and green hair- littered the room. Eri\u2019s hair pin and metro card lay discarded by the doorway. Feelings of pride and fear for the light of his world bubbled in Izuku\u2019s chest.\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Time to find out where you went, however\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOh that won\u2019t be necessary; my little weapon is safe and sound\u201d A cold voice spoke behind. Izuku twirled around, only to freeze at the sight.\n\u00a0\u201cYes, you really do look like your mother, Izuku Midoriya; it\u2019s a pity you didn\u2019t inherit Inko\u2019s most wonderful quirk. While weak, it did great things before she became a coward.\u201d Izuku was staring at an image he never wished to see.\n\u00a0A completely healed \u2018boogie man of the underworld\u2019 holding his sister by the throat, her right arm broken. He eyes watered when they met him, a black eye beginning to form along with her horn, fully enlarged.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou bastard\u201d Izuku said with venom at her tears. The monster of a villain smirked, looking rather like a business man in a spiffy suite, white hair neatly groomed that contrasted with the cold blue eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWho, me? I assure you my parents were married, at the very least. I prefer you use the name \u2018Sensei\u2019 regardless; it\u2019s much better than my other titles, but \u2018All For One did have a certain ring to it in my youth.\u201d Eri whimpered and the hand on her throat grew tighter. Without a single thought besides saving his sister, Izuku rushed in.\n\u00a0\nWith Eri, moments before Izuku found her room\u2026\n\u00a0Growing up with a brother like Izuku gave you certain abilities. Abilities like, picking a lock or sneaking out of rooms. Abilities other children didn\u2019t have, not even the boy at the park who Eri liked making mud pies with whose daddy went to prison for being a thief.\n\u00a0Eri knew all those times her \u2018Izu-nii\u2019 played games like \u2018hunt the toy\u2019 and \u2018crack the safe for pie\u2019 she was learning something important. Her brother never said it out loud, but he was teaching her things that would protect her from the bad men.\n\u00a0That\u2019s what Mamma Inko said the last time Eri saw her, at least. Eri didn\u2019t understand it then, when her new Mamma told her Izuku did everything for a reason and he always said important stuff only. Until now, when she heard the pop of the dead bolt sliding open, leading to the hallway. Kurogiri, the nice mist man who gave her sweets and apologized for hurting her, said she could get out while they were gone if she really needed to.\u00a0\n\u00a0Eri was going to escape. Kurogiri said her brother would come for her, but Eri didn\u2019t want to be a burden. Her Izu-nii was her hero, always brave and strong; now she had to be one too. They wanted her to hurt All Might, her brother\u2019s favorite hero! No, Eri couldn\u2019t do it, it\u2019d make her Izu-nii sad if his hero was hurt by her curse.\n\u00a0Taking a deep breath of courage like Aizawa-san said to, Eri stepped out into the hallway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, Kuro said go right\u2026then left two doors\u2026\u201d She continued muttering the directions as she snuck through the base like in her games, a habit she no doubt picked up from her amazing Izu-nii.\n\u00a0\u201cWell, well, just as I was coming to grab you to lure a certain ant who thinks himself a hero, you just come to me.\u201d An evil sounding voice interrupted her thoughts. This voice, she was more scared of it than Chisaki\u2019s voice, and he gave her nightmares. When she saw Chisaki in her room, Eri thought things couldn\u2019t get worse. But then this man with an even eviler voice had come in and made her scream with nightmares. He said he had many quirks, that he was God and wouldn\u2019t kill Izu-nii if she behaved.\n\u00a0And now he saw her- so stupid! Eri felt fire in her tears as they pooled. The evil man\u2019s cruel blue eyes met hers as he grabbed her arm and crushed it.\u00a0\n\u00a0Eri screamed, but a harsh slap stopped the sound.\n\u00a0\u201cTsk, tsk; enough of that. We wouldn\u2019t want you to alert your brother. Not before I\u2019m ready for him anyways.\u201d A hand made breathing harder than anything else she\u2019s had to do before- harder than cooking, making her bed, all of it- and she was dragged down the hallway. Her horn started throbbing as well, making everything seem fuzzy.\n\u00a0Eri cried inside for her hero.\nBack to the present, with Izuku and Eri\u2026\n\u00a0Eri looked at her brother, and somehow she knew everything would be alright. Izu-nii would protect her, he\u2019d get them home. Even as he was kicked to the side wall by the evil man\u2019s shoe, Eri knew: Izu-nii would save her.\n\u00a0Izuku grunted as he slid down the wall.\n\u00a0\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d just let you near me? Really? You may be quirkless, but I\u2019ve learned your kind know how to squeeze out surprise attacks like the worms you are. You, my brother- both of you have that same look of pathetic bravery in your eyes.\u201d The villain known as \u2018Sensei\u2019 and \u2018All for One\u2019 semi ranted. Izuku wheezed, and shakily stood his ground. Sensei rolled his eyes at the gesture.\u00a0\n\u201cGive\u2026 me back\u2026 my sister\u201d Izuku said. He gripped his trusty apron, knowing it wouldn\u2019t help, but maybe the sedative?\n\u201cHonestly, just stop; you don\u2019t stand a chance and you know it. What could you, a quirkless nobody hopes to accomplish against ME, a man with hundreds of quirks?\u201d He jeered. Eri struggled in his grip, inciting another sneer. \u201cEri-chan, Eri-chan; didn\u2019t we have a deal? You do what I say and I let you go- you\u2019ve broken your end of the bargain.\u201d Sensei loosened his grip on her throat. \u201cWell? What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYou- you\u2026 you\u2019re evil\u2026 you never would let me go. And, and, and, you hurt my Nii-chan! You weren\u2019t supposed to hurt him!\u201d Eri coughed. Izuku shuddered as the grip tightened again and prayed for a miracle.\nJust then a misty portal opened, Kurogiri\u2019s tense form joining the room, Tomura stumbling in through the mist with multiple gash wounds adorning his body.\n\u201cAh, Kurogiri, Tomura, nice of you to join us; tell me, how did Tomura\u2019s little \u2018mission\u2019 go?\u201d Sensei greeted while ignoring the blood. Kurogiri shifted his form nervously, something Izuku noticed.\u00a0\n\u2018Mission?! What mission?\u2019 Izuku\u2019s mind flew with possibilities.\n\u201cIt\u2026 we did accomplish the mission, sir, but\u2026\u201d Sensei\u2019s eyes flashed and he tossed Eri towards Izuku. Without thinking Izuku caught her in a roll and watched the scene warily for a chance to exit.\n\u201cWell? What happened?\u201d Sensei demanded. Kurogiri sighed.\n\u201cWell, for one thing we lost the Yakuza punk\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHardly a loss, considering his stupidity. What aren\u2019t you telling me, Kurogiri?\u201d The room\u2019s temperature dropped, and not from a quirk.\nKurogiri looked deep in thought before glancing at Izuku, winking. Izuku\u2019s eyes widened, as the mist villain turned back to his boss.\n\u201cIt was a complete disaster\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor one thing he let the target go like the worthless NPC he is\u201d Tomura\u2019s growl echoed, pain laced in his voice.\n\u201cTomura, go get those treated.\u201d Sensei said quietly. Tomura left in a huff, and the villain turned towards Kurogiri. \u201cYou. Explain. Now\u201d Sensei ordered, hand already twitching towards Kurogiri\u2019s form.\nKurogiri\u2019 s point of view, flashback\u2026\n\u00a0Kurogiri knew this was a bad plan. Heading to the U.A main building during a crisis would not end well.\n\u00a0And it didn\u2019t. Despite his warnings to Tomura to not be cocky, the teen rushed in with the villain horde they had brought. A brilliant fighter, Tomura held his own despite the odds not being in their favor.\n\u00a0But the others didn\u2019t fair as well. Overhaul- dragged in unconscious by Erasure head not ten minutes after the invasion started. Twice and Compress- knocked out by UA security protocol that they knew would be there but couldn\u2019t fight. Dabi and Himiko\u2026 well, he didn\u2019t know what happened to them, as Himiko was going on about making the mission a \u2018tour\u2019 of the school. By this point they were probably lost in some dark corner.\n\u00a0All these children, Kurogiri had mentally screamed. Honestly, no attempt at subtly or tactics. They were in Nezu\u2019s playground, yet acted like it would be easy. This is what happens when All For One let his godlike abilities bolster the troop morale: they got sloppy.\n\u00a0He winced at the other Nomu they brought shutting down after its head was ripped by Nezu\u2019s wrecking ball. They were losing\u2026 no, they had already lost.\n\u00a0If only he hadn\u2019t gotten Inko involved all those years ago. If only he hadn\u2019t helped a monster rise again; perhaps Tomura wouldn\u2019t be so far gone, cackling as he disintegrated the cement blocks thrown at him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOi, Misty-fuck, let me go!\u201d Ah. Yes, Kurogiri\u2019s second facet to this mission: grabbing Katsuki Bakugou for \u2018bait\u2019 against All Might. Separating the boy from his sensei was the easy part. But keeping him captive made Kurogiri\u2019s stomach clench. Really, it was unnecessary violence. All Might would come for just Eri- Kurogiri would drag the man to base if necessary, to stop this madness- there was no need for this. If anything, why not take a UA student on their walk home?\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m talking to you! When I get out of here, I\u2019ll rip your misty face off\u201d The Bakugou boy ranted. Tied with quirk suppressant ropes and sporting a broken shoulder, the threat was minimal, but still sent shivers down Kurogiri\u2019s spine.\n\u00a0First, he betrayed the children of his love, and now he had to take this random child too?\u00a0\n\u00a0Tomura landed near him in a heap. UA staff, most of them exhausted but standing, advanced upon the villains. In Tomura\u2019s grasp was Midnight.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cKurogiri, grab the brat and let\u2019s go; everyone else can be rescued later.\u201d Tomura said. Blood pooled from several spots. \u201cWe have this one too as a gift for Sensei.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the plan!\u201d Kurogiri objected. He ignored the Bakugou child struggling to escape. Tomura looked annoyed.\n\u00a0\u201cAnd? Her quirk would be good for our NPCs; let\u2019s go Kurogiri. Now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201d Kurogiri admitted.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou what?! What do you mean you CAN\u2019T?\u201d Without a word, Kurogiri gathered Tomura in his mist and teleported them away- without the targets. He couldn\u2019t leave Tomura, not after he raised him since childhood. But\u2026 neither could he let this madness continue.\n\u00a0So, Kurogiri took them home, fully aware he wouldn\u2019t make it out again alive.\nBack to the present, with Kurogiri\u2026\n\u00a0\u201cAnd you just let them go?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do it. And I don\u2019t regret it. At all.\u201d Kurogiri admitted. The atmosphere became suffocating. All the coward inside Kurogiri wanted to do was either apologize or warp away to safety.\u00a0\n\u00a0Now, here was a defining moment in Kurogiri\u2019s life. Everything was spiraling out of control. They were now kidnapping not only innocent children but heroes that would be killed for no reason after their quirk was taken. This is what Kurogiri\u2019s life had become: madness. In his youth he would have gone along with it, convinced Sensei knew what was best. That or run away.\n\u00a0But no more. No more of this. Kurogiri had stood his ground, leaving the \u2018bait\u2019 back at U.A. Sensei\u2019s face spoke of his impending doom if he didn\u2019t run- which he wouldn\u2019t. Not without Izuku and Eri.\n\u00a0He just had to time this right to save the love of his life\u2019s children.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 shocked.\u201d Sensei said quietly. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t be- you loved your Inko too much, always advocated for \u2018peaceful\u2019 plans. You\u2019re not a villain Kurogiri: you\u2019re just a broken man wishing for a second chance that will never come. But don\u2019t worry; It\u2019s time I put you out of your misery, coward.\u201d Sensei- no, All For One\u2019s when he had that look in his eye- shot his hand out like a viper.\u00a0\n\u00a0Kurogiri was ready, though, and evaded the hand. Instantly he was in front of Izuku and Eri, praying this would work.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cMaybe I am a broken man, and a coward. But I\u2019m something else too.\u201d He said. His mist covered the two children he betrayed, and he used all his focus to send them away. He sent a mental apology for not going with them, but he had to face his past. As soon as the portal closed a snarling All for One was on him, ripping his quirk out of his body.\u00a0\n\u00a0Every bone, every molecule, every particle screamed in agony. Never had such pain been felt, not in all his years. And never had the feeling of loss hit him so hard. His quirk\u2026 gone. Left behind was his pale and tattered body that had never seen the sun.\n\u00a0\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d His former master snapped hatefully. A hand gripped his face painfully, but Kurogiri still found the energy to grin and lifted his shirt to show what he\u2019d been hiding ever since he agreed to kidnap Eri Midoriya.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a vengeful spirit, you lying bastard. I\u2019m vengeful and you hurt Inko\u2019s children.\u201d All for One\u2019s eyes narrowed then widened when the former mist villain activated a bomb. A bomb attached to his torso. A countdown started.\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 you fool! You\u2019ll only kill yourself!\u201d He exclaimed and dropped Kurogiri, attempting to use the stolen quirk- or really any quirk- to escape, only to fail as quirk suppressant gas filled the room.\n\u00a0Like any good vigilante/ villain, Sho Kurogiri had back up plans amongst back up plans, all so over the top they\u2019d never be used.\n\u00a0Except this one. The bomb was not designed to kill, just release enough quirk suppressant gas for an elephant, curtesy of Mustafu\u2019s hospital ward.\u00a0\n\u00a0A rage filled All for One realized what happened and chuckled darkly.\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 you really are a fool, Sho Kurogiri. You know this won\u2019t stop me, I have the antidote in my office.\u201d All for One said. A boot crushed harshly into Kurogiri\u2019s newly exposed windpipe. He could feel his life slipping away curtesy of his quirk being ripped out without regard and the now damaged neck.\n\u00a0But that was okay. Because he still won.\n\u00a0\u201cM-maybe. But by then they\u2019ll be here.\u201d He whispered hoarsely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhat! Who- who did you tell traitor! Kurogiri!\u201d His former boss demanded. But it was too late.\n\u00a0The room which was dim became brighter than the summer days of his youth. No longer was the room there, just a void. Kurogiri smiled at the peace that filled him. A familiar scent, one he thought he\u2019d never smell again came. Gentle laughter filled his ears.\n\u00a0\u201cI-Inko\u201d He whispered in wonder. More laughter surrounded him, and a hand appeared in his vision despite the bright nothingness. Inko smiled down at him, the image of her teen self.\n\u00a0\u201cCome on Sho! We\u2019ve got to go- everyone\u2019s been waiting for you.\u201d And suddenly in the distance his family waved, bright grins on their faces.\n\u00a0\u201cYeah. I\u2019m coming, Inko-chan\u201d Sho said. With that, a young Sho Kurogiri stood up and chased his best friend to the light, his body left behind by the now free spirit.\n\n\n\n\u00a0And thus, All for One was left with the cooling corpse of a broken man who redeemed himself. Without a backwards glance to the fool, All for One opened his phone to the tracker he put inside his weapon. First he had to grab the brat, his antidote, and then prepare for whoever the fool summoned.\nWith All Might, right before, UA\u2026\n\u00a0All Might felt like everything had gone to shit. His patrol bore no fruit and now his comrades- no, friends, family- were injured. Even Recovery Girl had quirk exhaustion trying to keep everyone alive and well.\n\u00a0Worse was Eri being gone still, and now young Midoriya missing. He failed the children, like the failure he was!\n\u00a0\u201cToshinori\u2026\u201d Recovery Girl tried gently as he allowed his face to fall into his hands. U.A was half destroyed, and they now had no idea where the children were. \u201cIt will be alright.\u201d \u00a0His head snapped up, angry tears in his eyes. Rarely was he so human but damnit was he distraught.\n\u00a0\u201cAlright? How the hell will it be alright?! Young Eri, You Midoriya- gone! Both with that madman, a madman who already killed my master. Our friends- injured, our school half destroyed. The only reason Young Bakugou wasn\u2019t taken was because their escape car just left him there for reasons we don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u00a0\u201c\u2026I know. But you must calm down.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHOW CAN I CALM DOWN?\u201d He shouted at his long time friend, the woman who saved him countless times. But he couldn\u2019t help it, he hadn\u2019t felt this helpless since Nana. He was the symbol of peace. He was ALL MIGHT. How could he be either of those things if he couldn\u2019t do what his persona demanded of him?\n\u00a0Answer was he couldn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Recovery Girl,\u201d He whispered. Tears pooled down his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cHey now, no need for tears if we\u2019re going to save Eri-chan and Midoriya-san.\u201d Nezu\u2019s cheery voice popped out of an intact vent. A tiny computer was in his paws. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky I always have the entire UA system backed up in my personal computer- I\u2019ve managed to pinpoint the location of Eri\u2019s captivity.\u201d His voice was smug but filled with hope.\n\u00a0Suddenly, the Symbol of Peace had a reason to smile again: hope was not lost.\n\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d He said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWait, we need to regroup\u201d Nezu said. But All Might was already gone.\nWith Izuku and Eri, somewhere in base\u2026\n\u00a0Izuku held his sister protectively as they tumbled out of the portal. Rolling several times before stopping, Izuku looked at the dark room they found themselves in. His mind wanted nothing more than to bolt with Eri right then, but his relief at having her in his arms clouded that judgment.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, Eri\u201d He breathed and hugged her close. Openly the sibling pair cried, Izuku being careful of her broken arm and now pulsing horn. This was bad; he had to get her to safety and calm the quirk down before it went wild.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNii- Nii-chan, I knew you\u2019d come. Even though I tried to be brave I couldn\u2019t\u201d Eri sobbed. \u201cI just wanted to go home! I couldn\u2019t do what they wanted.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cShh, shh, my little Princess Unicorn. You\u2019ve been nothing but brave this whole time. Everyone gets scared, hell I bet All Might gets scared.\u201d He said. Eri sniffled.\n\u00a0\u201cR-really?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes, really. But despite your fear you stayed calm- I\u2019m so proud. So, so proud. When we get out of here we\u2019ll get some ice cream to celebrate.\u201d Izuku promised. However, he first had to get them out. Ripping his jacket for a sling, Izuku situated Eri\u2019s arm and wished he could do something about her eye. For now though, it would have to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOkay, Eri, I need you to hold one, okay? I don\u2019t know where Sho- I mean Kurogiri- sent us, but from the walls we\u2019re still in base. We need to leave.\u201d Eri nodded and let herself get picked up, holding onto Izuku\u2019s neck with one hand that refused to let go.\n\u00a0\u201cI just want to go home, Izu-nii\u201d She mumbled.\n\u00a0\u201cI know, and we are.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0Brother and sister exit the room, hallways the same as those he had been in looking for Eri. In fact, there was a stain he remembered\u2026 and that\u2019s a door he brushed past\u2026\n\u00a0\u201cThat sly, sly man\u201d Izuku whispered. Sho had dropped them off near the entrance. All he had to do was take five rights, two lefts, then race to basement entrance he used originally. They were home free.\n\u00a0Izuku ran like the hounds of hell were on him. Some would mistake him for having a speed quirk, but he was still powerless. No, what fueled him was the desperation to save his sister. No thoughts about his own safety were in his mind as he came upon the last two turns.\n\u00a0\u201cWe made it\u201d He said.\n\u00a0\u201cNot quite. It\u2019s the NPC brat and weapon brat- my lucky day.\u201d Shigaraki drawled, now bandaged up and looking rather maniacal. His form leaned casually against the door they needed, smirking cruelly. Izuku backed up, straight into All for One, who had turned the corner, looking at a phone.\n\u00a0\u201cSo, my tracker does work. I was unsure with how fast the dot was moving, but of course you quirkless can pull of ridiculous feats when threatened.\u201d He grabbed Izuku and ripped Eri away. She screamed.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, shut up; you just have to do what we say and your worthless brother lives, okay?\u201d Shigaraki said. Eri landed painfully on her bottom and All for One lifted her by her hair.\n\u00a0\u201cTomura, go prepare our escape plans; after I grab my quirk antidote we\u2019ll regroup at another location to lure All Might.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYes, sensei\u201d Tomura agreed with reverence before hobbling away.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNow behave, or your brother gets it. Keep your quirk under control as well\u201d All for One said, as Eri\u2019s horn was alternating between shrinking and growing.\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this\u201d Izuku said hatefully, even as he found talking difficult. The comment about antidote peaked his interests. All for One rolled his blue eyes.\n\u00a0\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ve heard it all before from you children. I may not have access to my quirk at the moment, but the passive boosts they give me are enough to contain two brats like you.\u201d With that he dragged the two from the basement level through the base.\u00a0\n\u00a0Soon they reached the supposed office, though to Izuku it was just a shell of a room. No papers, an opulent desk with computers that looked like they hadn\u2019t been used in years. They were taken to a wall safe, where All for One quickly pulled out a thick needle full of blue liquid.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d All for One said conversationally as he injected a syringe in his neck, the office dust settling around him, \u201cMy brother was quirkless like you, like I said earlier.\u201d Izuku kept silent as they were once more led out the door. \u201cI gave him a quirk, you know, and what did he do?\u201d The hand holding Izuku tightened. \u201cHe used it against me! Me, his older brother!\u201d\n\u201cSounds like he knew you were evil\u201d Izuku muttered.\n\u201cOh, yes, he shared your sense of justice and wit as well. Well, my little brother decided that he did actually have a quirk, and it combined with the one I gave him. Oh, the irony! Then, he passed it down to some other do-gooder. So even when I finally killed the worm, his legacy passed on and on all the way into the current \u2018Symbol of Peace\u2019.\u201d Izuku\u2019s mind raced at the possibilities. A quirk that could be passed down?! Well, he should have seen it, what with All for One\u2019s quirk.\n\u201cMaybe when this is over and I kill off the last bit of my brother, I\u2019ll keep you alive and with me. It would be like a trophy, a way to laugh in my brother\u2019s memory.\u201d The villain chuckled. Ice spread down his spine. Eri sniffled.\u00a0\nSuddenly everything- hallway, floor- exploded.\n\u00a0\u201cDETROIT SMASH!\u201d was heard as the dust settled. Standing in the rubble, below where the trio was, was All Might himself.\u00a0\nAnd he wasn\u2019t smiling, making All for One jeer.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, lovely, he just had to show up before the antidote fully formed. No matter. Eri-chan\u201d All for One said as he dropped her on the ground. \u201cYou want your brother to live, yes?\u201d Eri nodded fearfully.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cY-yes. Let Izu-nii go!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cGood. To make that happen, do what we agreed on- or else. Go on, go to All Might.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0Izuku watched his little sister struggle to get up and toddle through the rubble. Her horn grew to full length as she reached for All Might, who swooped in and scooped her up.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to have her\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cRewind the pest All Might, yes.\u201d All for One drawled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t risk rewind\u2019s side effects on my, after all.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cShe would never!\u201d Izuku insisted.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, she would, because otherwise she knows I\u2019ll snap your neck. I did the same thing to Kurogiri earlier.\u201d He talked about death so easily. Izuku struggled, but couldn\u2019t get free. All for One lifted Izuku by the throat, the now evening sun illuminating the action in the debris.\n\u00a0\u201cAll for One, let the boy go, he\u2019s nothing to you!\u201d All Might called. The hero landed on a support beam, Eri clutched in his grasp. A short hero landed next to him, one Izuku barely recognized as a retired Gran Torino. Eri was passed to him, but when Gran Torino tried to leave, she bit him and jumped down.\n\u00a0\u201cOh, I would say he still has use. You\u2019ve been a thorn in my side for eight generations, but no more. I had wanted to move our fight to a more private venue, but not matter- now, Eri!\u201d All for One ordered. \u201cDo your job or Izuku dies- just like your adopted mother and birth father!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cNii-chan!\u201d She shouted, and white began circling her. Izuku looked at her through the haze of little oxygen.\n\u00a0\u201cE- Eri. I\u2019m so sorry I couldn\u2019t save you and be the hero you needed. I love you Eri, but you need to run. Don\u2019t give him what he wants\u201d Izuku choked out.\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Eri looked conflicted, like she wanted one thing but her sense of right and wrong prevented her from acting on it.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Eri-chan, whatever happens, happens\u201d All Might tried and patted her head. He prepared himself to possibly stuff his quirk down the child and send her away with his former mentor. He\u2019d then fight All for One to the bitter end and die with Izuku. He grabbed a hair in preparation.\n\u201cOh, is this not rich. You, All Might, are about to doom a small child to this fate? And then what? Die here with this boy! Well, if you\u2019ve made up your mind, how about I just speed along the deaths, since Eri doesn\u2019t seem to care about her brother?\u201d\u00a0\nAll for One\u2019s quirk chose that moment to come back, all his enhancers turning back on. His hand clenched and Izuku\u2019s neck snapped.\nSnapped in half.\nSnapped loudly.\nSnapped, and his world just ended.\nIzuku Midoriya, age fifteen, fell limp, dead.\nTo be continued\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026Just kidding, let\u2019s see what happens next!\nWith Eri\u2026\n\u00a0Eri heard the snap. She heard it across the battle field, felt it in her spine. The world stopped. The air froze. And her quirk exploded like a thousand suns.\n\u00a0\u201cIZU-NII!\u201d Tore through her very being. All her anguish, all her sorrow, filled the name of her most precious person. It didn\u2019t matter if the world was unwound. In Eri\u2019s mind, nothing mattered now that Izuku-nii was dead.\n\u00a0Her Nii-chan. Her Tou-chan. Her hero. Gone.\n\u00a0\u201cYOU MONSTER\u201d She barely heard despite the volume. Her dull eyes saw nothing but the red of battle mixed with her quirk. It was as if Eri had left her body, no longer wanting to be in it if Izuku wasn\u2019t there.\n\u00a0\u2018Why are they fighting?\u2019 She thought vaguely. Shockwaves hit her, one after the other. The old man who was her size hugged her.\n\u00a0\u2018Stop fighting. There\u2019s no point\u2026 no point\u2026 Izu-nii\u2026\u2019 Suddenly anger sparked in her. How dare they fight with her Izu-nii gone, tossed away while they hit each other?!\n\u00a0\u201cUNITED STATES OF SMASH!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a fool! You will die here today! Look at you, even your quirk is leaving you!\u201d The evil man\u2019s voice reverberated. All Might was looking a lot like Yagi-san, his face gaunt.\n\u00a0\u201cEven if I die, I will never stop protecting people from YOU!\u201d All Might shouted back and punched more.\n\u00a0\u201cStop it\u2026 Stop it!\u201d She started chanting. \u201cStop fighting. Stop fighting! You can\u2019t fight anymore!\u201d She kept saying, over and over. The white grew, her quirk shot out to encompass everyone in the vicinity. \u201cJUST STOP FIGHTING!\u201d\n\u00a0And the world was quiet for Eri. The use of her quirk made her sleepy, and she started dreaming even before her eyes closed.\n\u00a0Because there was no way her Izu-nii was running towards her, right?\u00a0\nImmediately before Eri passes out, with All Might\u2026\n\u00a0The whole mission was a nightmare. He hadn\u2019t listened, hadn\u2019t waited for anyone but Gran Torino to back him up.\n\u00a0And now a young man was dead. A young man he had once wanted to make his successor. Through his years, Toshinori had seen many people die after Nana. But only Izuku\u2019s hit him the way it did.\n\u00a0Now All Might was struggling to pull one last punch as his quirk literally died inside him. He would die here, with his quirk. All hope was lost. At least he could apologize to Young Izuku in the afterlife. He prayed Gran Torino took Eri, that she could survive at least. He prayed to, that Izuku\u2019s body could be recovered later, give her closure. Toshinori Yagi felt his body begin to just drop. It was time.\n\u00a0But then white covered him like a mother\u2019s hug and villain\u2019s wrath tied into one. It was happiness and rage; it was gentle and rough. It was so many things and he would swear for years he saw a unicorn\u2019s face inside the light, carrying Izuku back to his fallen body.\n\u00a0The light covered everything, and in moments he was standing tall, no pain in his gut. But also no One For All.\n\u00a0He was quirkless yet healed. But, guessing by All for One\u2019s enraged yet frail sounding screams, an old man\u2019s body left where the villain once was, he wasn\u2019t the only one. The former villain coughed weakly, two-hundred year old body not able to stand.\n\u00a0\u201cEri!\u201d Toshinori\u2019s head snapped from the sight of his nemesis to Izuku bolting upright and running towards a somehow unconscious Eri and younger looking Gran Torino. He turned his attention back to his nemesis.\n\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re done here.\u201d He grinned and allowed some smugness to show through.\nWith Izuku, before Eri\u2019s quirk\u2026\n\u00a0Izuku had woken from his neck snapping to a world of white.\n\u00a0\u201cWell, I guess I didn\u2019t make it out\u201d He deadpanned. A melodious laugh made his undead heart stutter to a stop.\n\u00a0\u201cOh you did, sweetie.\u201d His mother was looking down at him, having that \u2018I know something you don\u2019t\u2019 look he always hated.\n\u00a0\u201cM-mom. Oh, Mom! I died and get to see you!\u201d Izuku cried and moved to go near her. She held up a hand to stop him.\n\u00a0\u201cMaybe I am, maybe I\u2019m not. But one thing is certain, you\u2019re not dead. You have too many things to do, Zuzu.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cI am dead, though\u201d Izuku insisted. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t simply survive a neck snapping. Most people die from that.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cNo, that\u2019s true. But you aren\u2019t most people- or rather, your sister loves you too much for you to be here yet.\u201d His mother gave a teasing grin and wink. Izuku blinked as his mother started fading.\n\u00a0\u201cNo, mom!\u201d He begged. A warm feeling engulfed him.\n\u00a0\u201cOh shush, my little Izu-chan. You always were such a crier. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll still be here when it\u2019s time. But for now, you have a little girl to raise and coffee to sell! Don\u2019t let our shop fail. And watch after Eri- she watches too much tv mister! And eat more vegetables!\u201d \u00a0The visage of his mother faded before him. Izuku was alone in the white.\n\u00a0And then he was snapped into his body. Cautiously he checked, relieved he was alive. Instantly he was on his feet, all thoughts of his mother gone as Eri came to mind.\n\u00a0\u201cEri!\u201d He screamed to his sister\u2019s pale and sleeping form, relief that everything was going to be okay even as dozens of heroes arrived.\u00a0\n\u00a0They did it. They were safe.\nEpilogue\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0One year. That\u2019s how long since Izuku\u2019s foolish rescue mission that somehow turned out alright. A lot had changed in that year, mainly the structure of heroes.\n\u00a0All Might retired, publicly showing his form and stepping down. No one knew what sparked it, as Kamino was more secret than most government black ops.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYoung Eri, we do not use that much sugar! There are too many cavities caused by it!\u201d Toshinori\u2019s voice echoed from the kitchen during their lunch break. The man made it his mission to ensure Eri had a partner in the kitchen on days the other slaves- er, employees- couldn\u2019t be in. Izuku offered to pay him, but Toshinori insisted the joy of working was payment enough.\n\u00a0\u201cYagi, shut up before I make you\u201d A grumbled voice from the shop\u2019s couch signaled Aizawa awakening.\n\u00a0\u201cYou do know your apartment is one block away, right? Go sleep there\u201d Izuku deadpanned. After Kamino, the man had moved to a new apartment less than a block away from the shop, not that he ever used it. At least half the week Izuku would find him asleep on the couch in his sleeping bag come morning.\n\u00a0\u201cProblem Child, my apartment is too far away. Now stop working on your reports and take a nap.\u201d Izuku huffed and complied. He plopped down at the other end of the couch right as Eri came in, covered in flour. Again.\n\u00a0\u201cOi, Shit\u2026 Izuku! We need cookies now!\u201d Bakugou boomed from the door, Midnight laughing while ruffling his hair. They really were a great mother son match.\n\u00a0Life was good.\n\nLater\u2026.\n\n\u00a0Well, most of life was good. Visiting his mother\u2019s new grave, now next to Sho Kurogiri\u2019s- both were approved because of Nezu\u2019s influences and money- brought mixed feelings. Standing there always left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\nOn one hand he was so unbelievably pissed for what the man did and couldn\u2019t figure out what Kurogiri\u2019s end goal was. But on the other hand, he sacrificed himself for Eri.\u00a0\n\nSo Izuku\u2019s emotions were everywhere.\n\n\u201cNezu keeps saying I should talk to you, that it would help.\u201d Izuku began. It had been a year, it was time for him to settle this. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so mad. So, so mad. You stole my sister, betrayed my mother. But then you helped me save her. I guess\u2026 I don\u2019t hate you. I will never forgive you, but I am grateful for your sacrifice. I still have nightmares from my neck snapping, and Eri can\u2019t stand small spaces. But she\u2019s alive.\u201d He added. \u201cSo, than you, Sho Kurogiri. For everything.\u201d\n\nWith that, Izuku dropped a letter with all his feeling spelled out on the grave, walking away. He had a coffee shop to run and his workers were lost without him.\n\nThat afternoon, Izuku smiled as he opened his shop to customers waiting anxiously. Eri bounced up to them eagerly.\n\u201cWelcome to Midoriya Coffee Shop and Pastries! We\u2019re so glad you\u2019re here\u201d She beamed.\n\nYes, life was good."
