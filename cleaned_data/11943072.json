    "text": "Soulmarks suck.\nBruce Wayne  firmly believed that soulmarks sucked. He wished he had never gotten one. He tried numerous times to burn it off, cut it off, chop it off. He even just scribbled all over it with Sharpie once in a fit of pique. Still, no dice. Thing didn\u2019t go away.\nIt was a stupid soulmark, anyways. His was on the inside of his right wrist, a small design, just a red sun and a yellow moon orbiting each other. It had small stars trailing around it; they almost looked like they twinkled in the right light.\nWhat a stupid fucking mark.\nAs an extension of how much he hated his own mark, Bruce didn\u2019t pay very much attention to anyone  else\u2019s marks either. He knew Arthur\u2019s, because Arthur\u2019s was right on his chest and he never covered his chest, and Mera had a matching one she didn\u2019t bother to cover, either. He\u2019s seen Diana\u2019s, but only once, and it was so fucking sad he doesn\u2019t ask about it. He knew Dick\u2019s, and kept an eye out for a matching one for him. He hadn\u2019t found it yet, but he was still optimistic, even if it was just about this one thing. He didn\u2019t know Jason\u2019s, but he did know Tim\u2019s. Tim was just waiting for the right person to come along, wearing his mark like a badge of honor.\nBruce wore his like an embarrassing scar.\nHe didn\u2019t know Hal\u2019s. He didn\u2019t even know if Hal had one, or if any aliens had them at all. He didn\u2019t know Barry\u2019s, even though he felt as though Barry probably would\u2019ve wanted to share by now. He didn\u2019t know J\u2019onn\u2019s, but, again, he didn\u2019t know if aliens had them. Atlanteans had them, but they were still on Earth.\nHe didn\u2019t know Superman\u2019s.\nAgain, aliens.\nNobody knew his, except his three boys and Alfred. That was it. They were all sworn to secrecy, and knew what would happen to them if they told anyone what it was. Even knowing that one person out there knew his mark made Bruce itch, though, let alone four. Bruce wore a cuff around the mark at all times. He  never took it off. He even kept it on in the goddamn shower, just in case. He knew what he had to do to keep a secret.\nUnrelated, but working with Superman had been incredibly difficult lately. The first time they met, Bruce felt this weird surge of heat he had chalked up to rage, and it had been boiling ever since. His skin itched horribly when he was with him. Superman was the worst kind of rash. Or, second worst, to the fucking soulmark. Superman was also the only one whose identity Bruce hadn\u2019t figured out so far. World\u2019s greatest detective or not, Superman was a tough nut to crack. That also drove Bruce nuts.\nBut they still got teamed up more often than not, because they worked really well together, which even Bruce could concede, and Superman was just about the only person who could put up with Bruce when they  had to assign someone to work with him.\nBruce preferred to work alone.\nSuperman has never really let that happen.\nAnd it was on one of those exact days that Bruce was itching more than usual. He felt like his hands were numb and tingling, all of him hot, and it set him on edge for the entirety of his and Superman\u2019s patrol. Superman didn\u2019t seem to notice; just like usual, he just kept chattering on and on about some dinner his mom had hosted the past weekend and what the old ladies from church had gossiped about while he was there. Bruce mostly tuned him out until they stopped to take a break on the edge of a rooftop. Superman sprawled out, lounging in a lazy stretch at the building\u2019s precipice. Bruce eyed him, then crouched beside him, never quite relaxing. Superman eyed him in return and leaned back.\n\u201cI wish we had somebody to fight,\u201d Bruce commented, probably interrupting something Superman was saying. Superman gave him a look. \u201cJust. You know.\u201d\nAfter a long pause, Superman said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He turned out to the city and stared, putting his chin in his hand. \u201cIt is pretty dull when things are this quiet.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bruce echoed. They fell back into silence. After a little while of total quiet, in which Bruce stared hard at one precise spot on one exact building until his vision went black and Superman seemed to be nearly catatonic in his relaxation, Superman sat up.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s getting mugged,\u201d Superman said. There was a hint of a suggestion in his voice, and he grinned at Bruce. \u201cWant to put the fear of God in them?\u201d\n\u201cThought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d Bruce grumbled, jumping down after Superman and sprinting after his shadow toward the alley Superman had apparently scented the mugger in. There were only three muggers, so having Batman and Superman show up was definitely overkill, but Bruce would probably replay the looks on their faces when they saw them for a long, long time. Superman just reached out and punched one of them in the jaw, then spun to knock another one toward Bruce, to let him have a turn. The woman they were mugging stared, open-mouthed, at the five of them brawling. Bruce knocked one of the guys out easily and caught the one that Superman had spun at him. When Superman turned to him and pulled his arm back to punch the daylights of him, though, Bruce\u2019s grip on the mugger\u2019s wrists faltered. He regained it immediately, and Superman didn\u2019t even notice as he knocked the guy to the ground and started monologuing about righteousness and justice. Bruce could barely hear him.\nSuperman had the same soulmark as him.\nThe same  stupid fucking soulmark. \nJust, right there, on his left wrist. Red sun, yellow moon. Stupid stars twinkling in the stupid glow of the stupid,  stupid streetlight.\nBruce decided he had to leave before he actually went ballistic.\n\u201cI, uhh,\u201d Bruce managed to choke out. Superman stopped monologuing briefly to look back at him, and Bruce forced his face to shut down behind his cowl. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Superman said, clearly confused. The two muggers Superman let stay conscious looked on, baffled. The third was unconscious, courtesy of Bruce. Bruce envied him. The woman they were mugging was still staring.\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Bruce repeated gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll do my reports later.\u201d He pulled out his grappling hook and shot it up without looking, letting it yank him off the ground and up to the roof above him. As he took off, he faintly heard Superman say:\n\u201cSee ya, Batman.\u201d\nHe ran faster.\n\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d Alfred said, when he found Bruce stripping out of the uniform with an uncharacteristic haste. \u201cBee in your bonnet?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Bruce grumbled, knocking his cowl aside. Alfred raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Alfred replied. \u201cMay I ask what happened?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said, slipping on his sweatpants and t-shirt and shoving his suit into a haphazard pile. \u201cWhere\u2019s-\u201d\n\u201cThe kitchen,\u201d Alfred told him. \u201cIt\u2019s still dinnertime.\u201d\nBruce followed Alfred up to the kitchen where, true to form, Tim was consuming an unholy amount of food, Jason was staring at the far wall, and Dick was playing solitaire on the countertop. Dick and Tim both looked up at him when he came in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d Dick commented,. Bruce rolled his eyes and opened the fridge.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the entire household kept track of my schedule,\u201d Bruce said, grabbing a hunk of watermelon from the fridge and taking the seat beside Tim at the table.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a schedule,\u201d Jason said, picking up Tim\u2019s butter knife and flicking it between his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re home before midnight, which is early.\u201d He stabbed one of the sausages off Tim\u2019s plate with the knife and shoved it in his mouth.\n\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Dick asked. He frowned at the red queen in his hand before sticking it under the deck.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce bit off. Tim looked up at him with all the concern that a nearly-fifteen-year-old boy could muster.\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked. Bruce shook his head and kept eating his watermelon.\n\u201cDid Superman say something?\u201d Dick suggested. Bruce glared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s a yes. What\u2019d he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Bruce told him.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWhat did he  do,  then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Bruce spat. Tim frowned up at him.\n\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Tim asked, concerned. Bruce looked down at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m not hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cEat your dinner.\u201d\n\u201cDid he beat you in a fight?\u201d Jason asked.\n\u201cHe did not,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cAs if he could.\u201d\n\u201cHe definitely could,\u201d Jason said.\n\u201cOh, yeah, for sure,\u201d Dick agreed. \u201cDid he stop you from doing something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cAll of you, fuck off.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tim said. Bruce hesitated before reaching out and ruffling his hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Bruce assured him. \u201cJust eat your dinner. Did you finish your homework?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tim said, and Bruce released him.\n\u201cThen we can go out tonight, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Bruce said. Tim looked sheepishly at Dick.\n\u201cI offered to take him out tonight already,\u201d Dick said. \u201cTake advantage of your night off. Do something a normal person would do. Don\u2019t you have a benefit or something tonight,  Bruce Wayne?\u201d \n\u201cWhat  did Superman do?\u201d Tim asked again.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t  do  anything,\u201d Bruce told him. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n\u201cDid he do something ridiculously attractive?\u201d Dick asked. \u201cDid he got you all hot and bothered?\u201d\n\n \u201cDick-\u201d \n\n\u201cHe  did,\u201d Dick gasped. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d\n\n \u201cNothing-\u201d \n\n\u201cSomething with his-\u201d Dick motioned in the direction of his head, \u201c-face? Something face-related? He\u2019s got a nice face.\u201d\n\u201cLegs?\u201d Tim suggested. Bruce glared down at him. \u201cArms?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce spat.\n\u201cArms,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWhat about his arms?\u201d\n\u201cHis elbows?\u201d Tim asked.\n\u201cIt is his muscles?\u201d Dick asked.\n\u201cDid he choke you or something?\" Jason offered. \"Did you like it?\u201d\n\u201cJesus  Christ-\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Jason said. He glanced up at Bruce, then reached out and pointed at his wrist. \u201cWas it-\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dick gasped. Tim looked between him, Jason, and back to Bruce. \u201cHe  doesn\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s his soulmark,\u201d Jason said. Tim dropped his fork.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he echoed, hands covering his mouth. \u201cWas it?\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d Dick prompted, when Bruce didn\u2019t say anything. Bruce just shoved another chunk of watermelon in his mouth. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Bruce told them. \u201cStop talking about it.\u201d\n\u201cSuperman has the same soulmark as you?\u201d Alfred asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a handy coincidence. When will he be stopping by, presuming you didn\u2019t kill him on the spot?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be stopping by,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cHow did you notice?\u201d Tim asked.\n\u201cHis sleeve rode up,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cwhen he pulled his arm back for a hit.\u201d\n\u201cHot,\u201d Dick commented. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t notice?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce told him, \u201cand he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t  say anything?\u201d  Tim asked, incredulous. \u201cBruce!\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou have to tell him!\u201d Tim exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the books, you have to tell him. He\u2019s your  soulmate.\u201d \n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cIt means something,\u201d Alfred reminded him. \u201cHe\u2019s your best match on Earth.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an  alien,\u201d  Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even  from Earth.\u201d\n\u201cBest match in the universe, then,\u201d Alfred amended. \u201cThat\u2019s not something to let slip by.\u201d\n\u201cYou gotta tell him,\u201d Tim insisted again, shoveling biscuits into his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Bruce said. He made eye contact with Jason, who just lifted one shoulder in a shrug and stabbed a biscuit out of Tim\u2019s hand with the butter knife. Dick shoved him away.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even bother,\u201d Jason suggested. \u201cJust tell him to fuck off. Never see him again.\u201d He bit the biscuit in half. \u201cYou\u2019d be better off.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Tim exclaimed. Jason flipped him off and stood, his chair screeching back on the tile before he left the kitchen. Tim slumped in his chair. Bruce ruffled his hair again and turned back to his watermelon. He could feel Dick\u2019s eyes on him and, eventually, caved and looked up.\n\u201cTry to be happy for once,\u201d Dick suggested. Bruce glared at him for a little bit longer, then turned his attention back down to his fruit.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell him,\u201d Bruce said. Tim groaned loudly and started eating again. \u201cFinish up and go get dressed. Dick, don\u2019t keep him out too late.\u201d\n\u201cAy, ay, Mom,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do tonight, if you\u2019re not making any rounds?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Dick said. \u201cTry to do something a  normal  person would do. Go to your benefit. Read a book. Go to  sleep.  Be  normal.\u201d \n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bruce agreed. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nAn hour later found Bruce back in the suit and up at the Watchtower. He expected it to be empty of any of the actual Justice League members, so he was surprised when Arthur was sitting in front of the computers and viewscreens, absently twirling his seat slightly to the left, then to the right. He glanced back at Bruce when he got in.\n\u201cHello, Batman,\u201d he offered, turning back to the screens. \u201cNothing much right now. Can I help you with anything?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cJust- checking in.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Arthur said, staring up at the screens. Bruce hesitated, then took one of the seats near him, watching the screens, as well. One thing Bruce appreciated about Arthur was that he understood the value of silence and never felt the need to fill it around Bruce. The two of them watched the scenes Arthur had chosen to monitor: some beachside town, a spot in Atlantis, a few locations in several cities. Bruce recognized a couple of familiar Gotham haunts.\nWhen Bruce eventually turned and glanced at Arthur, he got a full view of the soulmark on his chest, a cluster of pearls inscribed with intricate designs of a Pacific origin. He didn\u2019t look away fast enough, and Arthur caught his eye. He raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked. Bruce shook his head.\n\u201cI was just looking at your soulmark,\u201d Bruce told him. Arthur grinned, turning back to the viewscreens.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou a match?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cNo, sorry, Artie.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me Artie,\u201d Arthur said, smiling. Bruce offered a smile of his own in return. \u201cYou got a mark?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bruce told him. He lifted his wrist and pulled his glove and sleeve apart to reveal his cuff. Arthur glanced back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret, though.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t, with you?\u201d\n\u201cNot all of us run around in tights, telling everyone we\u2019re the King of Atlantis.\u201d Bruce watched as Arthur laughed and turned away again.\n\u201cGot a soulmate?\u201d Arthur asked.\n\u201cI must,\u201d Bruce said, \u201csomewhere.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t met them?\u201d\n\u201cWell-\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t told them,\u201d Arthur corrected. \u201cI get it.\u201d\n\u201cDid you tell Mera?\u201d Bruce asked. \u201cAbout yours?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Arthur told him. \u201cShe noticed first. Anyways, in Atlantis, soulmarks are important. You people, you keep yours secret. We wear ours proudly. We weren\u2019t ashamed. She couldn\u2019t keep it to herself once she realized we were a match. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been able to, either.\u201d He twisted to and fro in his chair again. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me, anyways. I think it\u2019s important.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your soulmate. What else could I have done, knowing that half of my soul was out there and I wasn\u2019t with her? You know?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said, but Arthur turned back towards him and smiled anyways.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Arthur conceded. \u201cWell, think about it. They probably want to know, too.\u201d\nBruce hadn\u2019t thought of that. He hadn\u2019t thought of a lot of things, actually. But now, all he could think about was not keeping the secret from Superman, but how Superman would react when he learned about the soulmark. Would he be pissed off? Disgusted? Disappointed? Would he- and Bruce didn\u2019t even want to think about it, but he did anyways- Would he be pleased? Would his whole face light up, would he be thrilled? Would the odd burning Bruce felt for Superman be echoed in him, would that affection Bruce suppressed be returned?\nProbably not.\nWhatever.\n\u201cI\u2019m late for a thing,\u201d Bruce said, standing. Arthur offered him a wave. \u201cGoodnight, Art.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Arthur,\u201d Arthur corrected. \u201cOr Aquaman. Or Your Majesty. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Bruce repeated, taking his leave of the Watchtower.\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d Arthur shouted after him. Bruce just picked up his pace and kept going.\nAfter a quick stop at Wayne Manor to change from the batsuit into a normal suit, Bruce was on his way to the benefit, driving himself and parking in a haphazard manner outside the reception hall, how people expected Bruce Wayne to park. He tossed the keys to the valet and strode inside, past the photographers still lingering outside despite the fact that Bruce was fairly certain the benefit had started over an hour before, past the entrance hall and the mingling socialites. He headed straight for the drinks and scooped up a glass of wine at once. He was turning to try and find the food table when he suddenly had a familiar face blocking his vision.\n\u201cClark Kent,\u201d he said, forcing himself to give that Bruce Wayne smile. Clark offered one of his own in return. His camera hung around his neck; he had a notepad and a pen in his hand, and another pen tucked behind his ear, snug against his glasses.\n\u201cBruce Wayne,\u201d he replied. \u201cAlways a pleasure. Can I have a moment?\u201d\n\u201cYou can have exactly three, if you\u2019re quick,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy night for me.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Clark said, \u201cwhich is why you\u2019re over an hour late.\u201d\n\u201cSome people actually do have better things to do than harass philanthropists and show up at useless benefits,\u201d Bruce told him.\n\u201cGood thing neither one is here,\u201d Clark replied. He pulled out his notepad. Bruce wished the guy wasn\u2019t so goddamn handsome; it would make it easier to ignore him if he was. As it was, Clark showed up at most Wayne events, representing the Daily Planet. Sometimes he brought coworkers: Lois Lane, who was beautiful and witty in her own right, or Jimmy Olsen, who was a far superior photographer. Tonight, he seemed to be on his own.\nBruce looked up at Clark over his wine glass. Clark smiled.\nToo goddamn handsome. Puts Superman to shame.\nThe reminder of Superman had Bruce frowning down into his wine glass. Clark seemed to catch on to his mood change.\n\u201cWe can schedule an interview for another time,\u201d Clark suggested. Bruce waved him off with his glass.\n\u201cYou\u2019d never leave me alone,\u201d Bruce said, \u201ceven if I said yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re onto me,\u201d Clark said. He clicked his pen open. \u201cCan I ask you a few questions about the Wayne Foundation?\u201d\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cbut will you?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s that Wayne humor we never hear about,\u201d Clark said with a grin. He shifted, tugging his sleeves back to stop them from catching on his notepad, and Bruce\u2019s smile slipped off his face the second he looked down.\nSoulmark.\nThe same-\nThe same  fucking soulmark.\nBruce\u2019s eyes darted back up to Clark\u2019s face, scanning his features. He had a dopey grin on his face, big glasses over his eyes, his hair combed and curling to the side.\nBruce  really looked.\nHe knew those eyes. Blue eyes, eyes he\u2019d seen shoot fucking lasers, eyes he\u2019d seen staring back at him, smiling, happy, sad, afraid, dying, living, warm, friendly. He knew that nose, straight like it had never been broken, even though Bruce knew it had been smashed on several occasions. He knew that mouth, knew it when it grinned, when it was shouting at him, when it was frowning. He knew that jawline, sharp and almost inhuman.\nActually, apparently genuinely inhuman.\n\u201cMr. Wayne?\u201d Clark asked, interrupted Bruce\u2019s revelation. Some detective he was.  World\u2019s greatest, and yet he somehow couldn\u2019t figure out Clark Kent was fucking Superman. \u201cDo you want me to repeat the question?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Bruce said at once. He handed Clark his glass, which Clark took with a frown.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I-\u201d he started to say, but Bruce waved his hand, cutting him off.\n\u201cNot your fault,\u201d he said, flashing a smile that he knew didn\u2019t feel right. It must not have looked right, either, because Clark looked absolutely baffled. Bruce found himself staring again, finding Superman in Clark\u2019s face, and Clark in Superman\u2019s. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Clark said, and Bruce turned before he could make another mistake, heading right back out the door, snatching his keys from the valet and jogging to his car. He sped the whole way home.\n\u201cBefore midnight again,\u201d Alfred pointed out as Bruce pulled up the driveway and hopped out of the car. \u201cYou\u2019re having an interesting night.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Bruce said. He locked his car and jogged past Alfred inside. Dick and Tim were already back from their night out, having already shed their costumes in the Cave and changed into pajamas. They were playing a video game in the living room, Jason sitting on the armchair beside their sofa and reading a book, a half-eaten apple at his side, when Bruce entered.\n\u201cYou\u2019re home early,\u201d Dick said again. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go this time?\u201d\n\u201cWatchtower,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cand then the benefit.\u201d\n\u201cMust not have been there very long,\u201d Dick commented. Tim paused the game and they both turned to look at him. Jason kept his eyes down at the book in his lap, flicking his Swiss army knife between his hands as he read and actively ignored them. \u201cWhat happened this time?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Aquaman on call right now?\u201d Tim asked. \u201cWhy\u2019d you go to the Watchtower?\u201d\n\u201cPeace and quiet,\u201d Bruce answered.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you go to the benefit?\u201d Dick asked.\n\u201cTo be  normal,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cas you so kindly suggested.\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you home already?\u201d Dick prodded. \u201cWas Superman there?\u201d\nBruce didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cHe  was?\u201d Dick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that on the news or anything.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there as Superman,\u201d Bruce told them.\n\u201cNo shit,\u201d Dick said. \u201cYou figured out his identity.\u201d\n\u201cSpill!\u201d Tim exclaimed. \u201cWho\u2019s Superman?\u201d\nBruce glanced at Jason, who must have felt the eyes on him, because he looked up and snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Superman,\u201d he told them. \u201cI\u2019m not hunting down a Boy Scout for shits. I don\u2019t care who he is.\u201d\nBruce hesitated, then said, \u201cHe\u2019s Clark Kent.\u201d\n\u201cThe reporter?\u201d Tim asked, brow creased. \u201cBut that guy\u2019s a klutz.\u201d\n\u201cThe perfect cover,\u201d Dick said. \u201cA moron.\u201d\n\u201cClark Kent is your soulmate?\u201d Alfred asked. \u201cThat\u2019s oddly fitting. I\u2019ve seen the two of you bicker.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they\u2019re two different guys and you\u2019ve got a hot threesome coming your way,\u201d Jason offered unhelpfully, grinning with teeth. He dog-eared his page in\u00a0his book to join the conversation. \u201cYou sure it\u2019s the same guy?\u201d\n\u201cI saw his soulmark,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cI stand by what I said,\u201d Jason replied.\n\u201cActually,\u201d Dick said, \u201cClark Kent being Superman actually makes a lot of sense. I\u2019ve never seen them in the same place, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are always the ones writing about him and taking pictures of him, they look kind of shockingly alike. I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t notice before.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially not Mr. World\u2019s Greatest Detective,\u201d Jason said.\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a  moron,\u201d  Tim said. \u201cAre you  sure?\u201d \n\u201cPositive,\u201d Bruce assured him.\n\u201cShall I prepare for his arrival?\u201d Alfred asked. Bruce glared at him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s  not coming,\u201d Bruce reiterated. Dick and Tim both groaned.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him  again?\u201d Dick asked. \u201cJesus Christ, Bruce.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I going to say? \u2018Nice soulmark, Superman has one just like it and so do I, so you must be Superman and I must be your soulmate.\u2019\u201d He accepted the mug of coffee Alfred gave him and took a sip. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to have happen at once.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have to tell him,\u201d Dick said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Tim said. \u201cYou found his real identity because you\u2019re soulmates. You find his  true self.\u201d \n\u201cJesus, kid, chill out,\u201d Jason said. He turned back to Bruce. \u201cKill him.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMake him leave the Justice League.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cYou leave the Justice League, and I take your place.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Jay,\u201d Dick said. He turned to Bruce. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cYou  have to tell him,\u201d Tim repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice. You have to.\u201d\n\u201cI live alone,\u201d Bruce said, ignoring Dick when he motioned to the four other people currently living with him. \u201cI work alone.\u201d\n\u201cJustice League,\u201d Tim pointed out.\n\u201cI don\u2019t play well with others,\u201d Bruce snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to want-\u201d\n\u201cAhh,\u201d Jason said, when Bruce cut himself off. \u201cGot it.\u201d\n\u201cBruce,\u201d Dick said, slowly. \u201cDo you want to tell him?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I want,\u201d Bruce replied. Tim frowned.\n\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d Tim argued. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d\n\u201cTim-\u201d\n \u201cDo you?\u201d Tim insisted. Bruce stared down at him, then sighed.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, teeth clenched together.\n\u201cGod, it\u2019s like we\u2019re shoving bamboo under your nails,\u201d Dick said.\n\u201cThis is nothing like that,\u201d Jason commented, picking his apple back up and cutting a slice out. He popped it in his mouth. \u201cThis is much worse, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a sad, dark, brooding person, really,\u201d Dick offered. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re definitely unhinged, and kind of a drag. But you\u2019re not as bad as you make yourself out to be.  Jason  is as bad as you make yourself out to be.\u201d He pointed at Jason.  \u201cThat  is real sad.  You\u2019re  just lonely sad.\u201d\n\"Fuck you, Dick,\" Jason spat. Dick heartily ignored him.\n\u201cYou need Superman,\u201d Tim agreed, all attention on Bruce. \u201cTell him you love him.\u201d\n\u201cI do not  love Superman,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cYou definitely could,\u201d Dick pointed out. They all fell silent. Alfred broke it.\n\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Alfred offered. Bruce groaned.\n\u201cStop adopting children and go get yourself a man,\u201d Dick said. \u201cFill that hole in you. Tell your soulmate about yourself.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Bruce said. Tim jumped up, excited.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Superman to be our step-dad,\u201d Tim said, and Jason flipped him off. \u201cOh, fuck off, Jay.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence,\u201d Jason said to Dick.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m the bad influence,\u201d Dick said, turning back to Bruce. \u201cLet us know how it goes. Try not to come back before midnight again.\u201d\n\u201cCan do,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cClark Kent is still at the benefit,\u201d Tim told them, \u201caccording to Twitter. He was there twelve minutes ago. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019s left yet.\u201d\n\u201cGo back to the benefit,\u201d Dick insisted. \u201cYou look nice. Just go back and tell him.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bruce said, and left.\nBruce circled around the house, changed back into the batsuit, and headed straight for the Hall of Justice just to get ten minutes of peace and fucking quiet.\nApparently, that was too much to ask for, because Superman was hovering just inside the door when Bruce got there. Bruce slammed the door shut with a little too much force and walked past him.\n\u201cWas it something I said?\u201d Superman asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s eating you? You left patrol pretty early before.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019m all good. Just forgot something here. Just taking a break.\u201d\n\u201cTwo separate reasons,\u201d Superman pointed out. Ugh. Not even just Superman anymore.  Clark. And now that Bruce knew, it was impossible not to see it. Too fucking handsome, too fucking good. Fucking perfect.\nClark landed back on the ground and came to stand beside him. \u201cAnything I can do? Anything you want to talk about?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Bruce repeated. \u201cAll good. Like I said. Bye.\u201d He brushed past Clark and was trying to just straight-up leave the room when Clark called out,\n\u201cBruce Wayne?\u201d\nAnd Bruce stopped in his tracks.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce asked, turning back. \u201cWhat- about him?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Bruce Wayne?\u201d Clark asked. \u201cHe blew me off earlier tonight. Kind of weird that both of you would do that. Is it me?\u201d\n\u201cIt is weird that Bruce Wayne would blow you off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cNot easy to blow off Superman.\u201d\n\u201cActually,\u201d Clark corrected him, \u201che blew me off in my secret identity.\u201d\nBruce was silent.\n\u201cWeird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clark continued. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know anything about that, would you?\u201d\nBruce glared at him. \u201cAre you asking if I know Bruce Wayne?\u201d\n\"No.\"\n\"Are you asking if I\u00a0am\u00a0Bruce Wayne?\"\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cWhy on  Earth  would I be Bruce Wayne?\u201d Bruce asked. \u201cThat guy\u2019s a total asshole. He doesn\u2019t have time for anyone but himself. And even if I was, which I am  not, how would you have even come to that conclusion?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Clark said, taking a seat and motioning for Bruce to do the same. Bruce did not. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Batman kind of just abandoned our patrol after, presumably, seeing my soulmark.\" Bruce immediately froze up. Clark just kept going. \"Then, later that  same night,  Arthur tells me that Batman stopped by and said some cryptic nonsense about soulmarks. Then, after that, I show up at a Wayne Foundation benefit, Bruce Wayne sees my soulmark, and  he abandons his benefit.\u201d Clark kicked his feet up on the table in front of him and shrugged. \u201cI might be pretty, Bruce, but I\u2019m not dumb.\u201d\nBruce forced himself to unfreeze.\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re pretty?\u201d Bruce asked, the first thing that came into his mind, and Clark laughed.\n\u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re thick,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs Bruce Wayne the real persona? Are you actually that dumb?\u201d\n\u201cBruce Wayne is a complex and layered person,\u201d Bruce defended, his mouth dry.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my soulmark?\u201d Clark asked, apparently going all in. \u201cHave you seen it before? Do I match Nightwing or something? Because I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled, but things could be worse.\u201d\nBruce frowned. \u201cWhat, Nightwing\u2019s not good enough for you?\u201d\n\u201cAre you arguing that I should date Nightwing?\u201d Clark asked, looking bewildered. He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just not interested. I got someone else in mind.\u201d\nBruce stared at Clark. Clark stared at Bruce.\nBruce carefully, slowly, reached up and pulled his cowl off. Clark smiled at him, but it was less of a show than before; it was softer, genuinely happy.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen your soulmark before,\u201d Bruce told him.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhere?\u201d\nBruce hesitated, then brought his hand up to his mouth and pulled his glove off with his teeth. He yanked his sleeve down and brought the cuff out, pressing his thumb and forefinger to the fingerprint access points. The cuff unlocked, for the first time in a long time, and Bruce held his arm out. Clark stood and ghosted over, hovering for a moment before he landed on his feet and took Bruce\u2019s wrist between his two big hands.\n\u201cHow long have you been wearing that thing?\u201d Clark asked. \u201cYour skin\u2019s so pale.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like looking at it,\u201d Bruce told him. Clark pressed his thumb into the red sun, then the yellow moon. Bruce\u2019s skin burned.\n\u201cKrypton has a red sun,\u201d Clark told him.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d known that before,\u201d Bruce said.\nClark looked up at him, then back down at the soulmark. He rolled up his own sleeve and settled it in the air beside Bruce\u2019s, their matching marks lining up.\n\u201cSuperman and Batman, soulmates,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhat a scoop.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Clark Kent would know a thing or two about that,\u201d Bruce said. Clark grinned.\n\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d he asked, and Bruce shrugged.\n\u201cA while.\u201d\n\u201cTonight?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Clark said. He touched Bruce\u2019s mark again, and the skin grew hot once more. He touched further up his arm, that warm trail following. Bruce couldn\u2019t figure out if it was a soulmate thing or if Clark just ran hot. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d\nBruce paused. \u201cAm I mad?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou ran away twice. It\u2019s not an unreasonable question.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought my soulmate would be a Boy Scout leader,\u201d Bruce commented. Clark smiled down at their wrists. \u201cIt\u2019s not the worst thing in the world.\u201d\n\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Clark murmured.\n\u201cHow could I be mad?\u201d Bruce offered. \u201cUnless you\u2019re not really Clark Kent. Am I in for a threesome?\u201d\nClark laughed. \u201cUnfortunately, no, I am Clark Kent. Sorry, Bruce Wayne.\u201d\n\u201cNo apologies necessary,\u201d Bruce said, and Clark tipped his head up and kissed Bruce before either of them could think better of it. Something wild and previously displaced settled inside of Bruce\u2019s chest and, judging off the expression on Clark\u2019s face, he felt the same thing. \u201cGuess we were right.\u201d\n\u201cGuess so,\u201d Clark said. He hesitated, then brought Bruce\u2019s wrist to his mouth. His mouth was just as hot as his hand. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be,\u201d Bruce replied. Clark smiled against his wrist and kissed his skin again."
