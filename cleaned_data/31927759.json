But here he was, nineteen years old, surrounded by his four closest friends, and celebrating just that. With a piece of a cake made for him by Kacchan, no less, who he lived with. Tell that part to twelve-year-old Izuku and he probably would\u2019ve grinned and said I knew it, because he always did know his friend would come around.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not crying right now, Deku,\u201d Ochako joked, smirking at him from the couch where she was cuddled up with her girlfriend, Mina. Todoroki nodded his agreement.\n\u201cHe did that already,\u201d Kacchan deadpanned from the kitchen, making Izuku laugh sheepishly, \u201cfor like, two fuckin\u2019 hours.\u201d\n\u201cNot that long!\u201d Izuku protested, earning blank, unbelieving stares from all four of his friends. Izuku shrunk back in his chair a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs it should be!\u201d Mina declared, lifting her glass of soda to the air, \u201cIf you cry, then you cry, Mido, more power to you!\u201d\nIzuku raised his own cup meekly in reply, feeling his cheeks burn and watching Kacchan join the rest of them in the small living room area of their shared apartment. Him, Kacchan, Todoroki, Ochako, and Mina had been friends since high school and managed to stay friends after graduation, thanks to Kacchan and Mina going to the same high-ranking fashion school in their city and the other three going to the same college, also in their home city. Izuku was forever glad for that, as he would\u2019ve been heartbroken to be separated from any of them, and utterly lost without Kacchan.\nIt had even been this group of friends that got him into streaming in the first place, originally with Ochako showing Izuku someone she\u2019d seen talking about comic books on a stream, who he disagreed with so strongly he\u2019d picked up the courage to start streaming himself. His initial popularity boost was surely in large part to Todoroki tweeting about him to his millions of avid fans \u2013 perks of being friends with a famous child actor, apparently \u2013 but even after that his follower count just kept growing. Lots of nerdy people in the world, he guessed.\n\u201cDamn, Bakugou, I always forget how good of a baker you are,\u201d Ochako hummed through a mouthful of cake, snapping Izuku out of his head.\nKacchan glared at her. \u201cThe fuck is that supposed to mean, Cheeks?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment, Blasty, just take it,\u201d Mina smirked, picking a spare chunk of frosting off her girlfriend\u2019s plate and licking it off her fingers.\n\u201cIt means you\u2019re amazing at everything you do, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku grinned at his childhood friend, who just rolled his eyes. Kacchan was truly good at everything he did, because he worked so hard at it, and there was no doubt in Izuku\u2019s mind he\u2019d be a great designer one day.\n\u201cAre we going to play something?\u201d Todoroki asked, taking Izuku\u2019s attention off Kacchan.\n\u201cSure!\u201d he chirped, grabbing the remote to turn on the TV, \u201cDid you want to stream or just be us?\u201d\n\u201cThree million celebration stream!\u201d Ochako cheered, leaning forward to snatch a game controller off the coffee table. Mina and Todoroki agreed, and when Izuku turned to Kacchan, he just shrugged. \n\u201cYour fuckin\u2019 party or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I still want you to play,\u201d Izuku said, holding out a controller to Kacchan, who stared at it for a second before accepting.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he conceded, shifting further towards the end of the couch, \u201cjust keep my fucking face out of frame.\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Izuku agreed, moving to turn on the webcam he kept set up by the TV and get his computer ready to stream. Kacchan had always been a very private person despite his parent\u2019s fame in their industry and being friends with two popular streamers and one actual celebrity, but he didn\u2019t seem too opposed to being heard on their streams or in Todoroki\u2019s Instagram stories. As long as his face wasn\u2019t shown, Kacchan would kick Izuku\u2019s ass in a video game any chance he got.\nIzuku finished setting up the stream and posted an announcement to his Twitter, and soon enough viewers started flooding in and spamming the chat with hellos and congratulations that made him smile.\n\u201cHey everyone!\u201d he greeted, taking his seat at the edge of where the camera frame lay, next to a just out-of-frame Kacchan with his other three friends on the couch on his other side. \u201cI\u2019ve got some friends over right now and we\u2019d thought we\u2019d play some games to celebrate three million of you lovely people!\u201d His friends, minus Kacchan, said their hellos to the viewers. \u201cKacchan\u2019s here too,\u201d Izuku added with a grin, reaching off-camera to pat Kacchan\u2019s soft blond hair and earning a slap to his hand. \n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Kacchan sniped as Izuku laughed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s mean, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku fake pouted, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be congratulating me.\u201d\n\u201cWas the damn cake not enough for your greedy ass?\u201d Kacchan shot back with an eyebrow raised. \n\u201cThe cake was amazing,\u201d Izuku smiled, then turned to face the camera again, \u201cKacchan made me a cake because he\u2019s actually a very nice person who-\u201d Izuku was cut off by Kacchan\u2019s socked foot pressing into his face and pushing him back into Todoroki. \u201cMmpf!\u201d He shoved Kacchan's foot off his mouth and was met with a very handsome, amused smirk. He felt his cheeks suddenly heat at the sight, mustering a glare and trying not to get flustered. \u201cRude!\u201d \n\u201cNever slander my name again,\u201d Kacchan said as their friends laughed behind them.\n\nChat\n\nShimuraNana: congratulations deku!!!\njustalittlebeekeeper: wooooo three mill!! you deserve it \ud83d\ude0a\n[MOD] TheEighthUser: ocha and mina are here!! best gfs uwu\nanquelbean: kalsdfdkj deku and kacchan back at it\nCloudFormations: you love 2 see it\nTenkoTenko23: Kacchan\u2019s voice how I missed you &lt;3\nLesbianNebula: \u2018never slander my name again\u2019 lmaooo\n\u201cCome on, you two!\u201d Ochako said loudly, drawing Izuku\u2019s attention away from Kacchan and back to the matter at hand \u2013 he noticed that happened often with Kacchan sitting in on streams, he\u2019d completely forget about being filmed or watched by anyone outside of Kacchan himself. \u201cLet\u2019s get to playing, I want to kick Kacchan\u2019s ass,\u201d she smirked, careful to use the nickname that was attached to Kacchan\u2019s only internet presence through Izuku\u2019s streams. \n\u201cLike hell you will, Mochi Cheeks!\u201d Kacchan snapped.\n\u201cWhat are we even playing?\u201d Todoroki asked. \nIzuku grinned. \u201cMario Kart, and I\u2019m going to kick all your butts.\u201d\n\u201cJust say ass,\u201d Ochako and Kacchan said in unison, then each made matching looks of disgust at the other as Mina and Izuku snickered.\n\u201cSomething they agree on!\u201d Mina laughed, earning a look of betrayal from her girlfriend.\n\u201cFine!\u201d Izuku giggled, \u201cIf you both insist, I\u2019ll kick all your asses!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMany rounds later, Izuku had no idea who was winning overall, thanks to the competitiveness of him, Kacchan, and Ochako, and the fact that Todoroki had grown up the youngest of four children. But what he did know was that the second he finally beat Kacchan, he declared himself total victor and said the game was over.\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Kacchan snapped, glaring at him with his controller gripped dangerously in his hands. Izuku grinned at him and puffed his chest out in an overdramatic pose. \n\u201cDeal with it, Kacchan, you lost!\u201d\n\u201cHe did beat you,\u201d Todoroki added helpfully as Kacchan narrowed his eyes further. \n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you,\u201d Kacchan growled, hardly threatening to Izuku at this point and really only serving to make him blush slightly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on camera,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cthere\u2019s no way you\u2019d get away with it.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Kacchan challenged, setting his controller down and raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cYeah, try me-\u201d Izuku cut himself with a yelp and a laugh as Kacchan grabbed him by the legs and dragged him off the couch and out of frame, holding him so he hung upside down in the air, which was a very impressive show of strength and made him glad for the blood rush to his face. \u201cAH! Kacchan!\u201d \nHe flailed his arms around until he grabbed onto Kacchan\u2019s ankle, yanking on it, and only realizing how stupid that was when Kacchan yelled in surprised and toppled backwards, Izuku landing haphazardly on top of him as someone\u2019s limb hit a tall lamp and sent it crashing to the ground. Kacchan\u2019s instincts were just barely fast enough to catch the top before the lightbulb shattered against the hardwood, and his cussing was almost drowned out by Izuku and the rest of his friend\u2019s laughter.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Kacchan yelled, making Izuku laugh even harder as Kacchan shoved him off. \n\u201cThat was-hah! That was your f-fault, Kacchan!\u201d Izuku managed through his laughter, then winced at the sore spot on his back where Kacchan\u2019s knee had hit him. It was moments like these when he understood why his mother has seemed slightly concerned at the prospect of him and Kacchan renting an apartment together. They\u2019d had the tendency to a little carried away ever since they were kids, and that did not stop when they turned eighteen. \n\u201cFuck off, that was on you!\u201d Kacchan protested, slapping Izuku\u2019s leg with his free hand.\n\u201cIs the lamp okay?\u201d Izuku asked, sitting up. \nKacchan nodded and winced. \u201cGod fucking dammit, now I\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d\n\u201cWoops!\u201d Izuku laughed, pushing himself to his feet and making his way back on camera, grinning lopsidedly at his viewers, \u201cWell, now my back hurts, so I think I\u2019ll end it here. Thank you for watching and thank you so much for any donations! Love you all, catch you next time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nbread @bag_uette\nOchako is all of us watching Deku and Kacchan lmao\n[Image: a gif of Ochako watching Izuku talk to someone off screen, then turning to smirk at the camera]\n\u00a0\nishi @edamame\nASDKLFDFKD DID THEY BREAK A LAMP WHILE WRESTLING??

Kacchan\u2019s bed was already empty, and he could hear his roommate moving around in the kitchen outside, because despite being the opposite of a morning person Kacchan never let himself sleep in on weekdays. Izuku preferred to fit in extra hours whenever he could, especially with his busy life as a full-time psychology student and a streamer.\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Izuku smiled as he entered the main room of the apartment to find Kacchan warming up leftover miso soup in the microwave as he did something on his computer and mumbled a greeting in response. He was wearing his glasses, red eyes narrowed and concentrated on his screen, one finger pressed into his lips and brows furrowed like every time he got focused, and Izuku would be lying if he said it didn\u2019t make him feel something. Really, seeing Kacchan do anything made him feel that something, but he tried to ignore it. Kacchan was his closest friend, of course seeing him would make him feel\u2026warm, or whatever. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d\n\u201cSchool thing,\u201d Kacchan muttered, and Izuku knew he wouldn\u2019t be getting more of an explanation than that, at least not until Kacchan was done with whatever the project was. As Mina would say, he was in the Fashion Zone.\nInstead of bothering him, Izuku just made himself some breakfast and sat at the counter, pulling out his phone to check for any important notifications before he had to go to class for the day. There were more congratulatory replies from friends and fans \u2013 it was so weird to think that he had fans, but he didn\u2019t know what else to call them \u2013 and a few message alerts from people sending him things they thought he\u2019d want to talk about.\nAnd then he found the Kacchan comments. There were always Kacchan comments when Kacchan joined him on streams, and sometimes when he wasn\u2019t there at all, because his little voice cameos had that much impact on people (Izuku understood one hundred percent, of course). Many of them fawning over Kacchan\u2019s deep voice \u2013 which, okay, they had a point \u2013 and even more seeming to claim he and his roommate had some sort of relationship beyond friendship. Those suggestions never failed to make Izuku think he was about to pass out. \nHim, dating Kacchan. \nOr, more accurately, Kacchan dating him. Yeah, not likely, and very not true. Maybe his viewers thought that because they couldn\u2019t see how way out of his league Kacchan was \u2013 Izuku had been told he was cute a few times by people that weren\u2019t his mother, but Kacchan was\u2026Kacchan was hot, if he were to put it bluntly. Kacchan was hot and cool and Kacchan, he was just Deku, and that was that. Their Venn diagrams were far from intersecting in terms of dating.\nTherefore, Izuku thought it was best to ignore the tweets and chat messages the best he could rather than embarrass himself in flustered attempts to explain that they were just friends. He ignored them, Kacchan never saw them, it was all fine.\n\u00a0\nHe got back from classes later that afternoon to an empty apartment with Kacchan still at school for what he guessed would be a few more hours, since it was nearing finals season and his friend preferred not to bring his projects home where Izuku would undoubtedly do something stupid like spill soup on cashmere or step on a pin cushion. Kacchan only ever brought a sewing project back to the apartment if he absolutely had to, but Izuku loved it when he did. Seeing Kacchan in his element, all focused and intense, was amazing. \nIzuku worked on his own classwork for a while, texting Kacchan to ask him to pick up groceries for dinner before he got home in between drafting papers and taking diligent notes on textbook chapters about his favorite subjects. After a few hours of work and response from Kacchan that said \u2018fuck you\u2019 that let him know Kacchan was on it, it reached the time in the afternoon when he was usually online. He quickly finished the last part of his assignment and grabbed his black and green headphones, then logged on to Twitch and started a new stream. It didn\u2019t take long for viewers to start coming in, spamming the chat with exclamation marks and hi deku!!s that never failed to make him both flustered and happy.\n\u201cHey everyone!\u201d he said to the camera, smiling. It had taken him a while to get comfortable talking to a camera when he wasn\u2019t just rambling about superheroes, but he liked to think he was better at it now than he was back in first year of high school. \u201cSorry for starting a little later than usual, I had to finish up an assignment. My professor is pretty harsh about late work.\u201d\n\nChat\n\n[MOD] TheEighthUser: hi deku!! :D\nAbsolutelyNot: Good job being a good student!! ( \u2022\u0300 \u03c9 \u2022\u0301 )\u2727\nFrogzz: ughhh, school is ew\nanquelbean: yikes, strict professors suck :/\nHoneyComb: what was the assignment? (also congrats on 3mil!!)\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Izuku said, reading through the chat messages he could see, \u201cYeah, my professor\u2019s pretty strict but he\u2019s a really good teacher. And the assignments are super interesting! They just take a lot of time,\u201d he continued, leaning back in his chair and running a hand through his unruly hair. He should probably take a shower. \u201cBut, you know, life of a college student.\u201d He lowered his voice to an impression of All Might\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m an adult now, so I have\u2026responsibilities.\u201d\nHe laughed at himself to his empty room, Kacchan\u2019s voice popping into his head unannounced to tell him how stupid he sounded. Screw off, Kacchan, he\u2019s an adult.\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d he snickered, opening Steam on his desktop and clicking on one of his favorite games, an All Might RPG he and Kacchan used to play as dorky eleven-year-olds squeezing in next to each other in front of the Bakugous\u2019 TV. \u201cMy brain is tired, so let\u2019s beat up some nomus!\u201d\nHe played the game for an hour or so, answering questions in the chat and rambling about the history of the game and any easter eggs he happened to notice as an All Might super-fan who knew way too much about this bullshit \u2013 Kacchan\u2019s words, not his, as if Kacchan knew any less about niche nerd things that he did. He got so caught up in all of it he didn\u2019t hear the front door of the apartment open, or the first few times Kacchan called his name.\n\u201cThis specific nomu design is actually one that\u2019s been around since the original All Might comics, which is why it\u2019s recognizable to a lot of-\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s rant was cut off by the door to his and Kacchan\u2019s shared room opening with a bang and Kacchan\u2019s gruff voice snapping, \u201cDeku.\u201d \n\u201cWAH!\u201d Izuku yelped, startling up so suddenly he nearly fell out of his chair and slapping a hand over his racing heart, \u201c-chan! Kacchan! Hi!\u201d\nKacchan glared at him from the doorway with one eyebrow raised. \u201cCome on, fucker, you\u2019re helping me unpack groceries.\u201d Before Izuku could respond, Kacchan hooked his foot through the armrest of Izuku\u2019s wheeled chair and yanked him out of frame. \n\u201cAh, okay!\u201d Izuku yelped, quickly shedding his headphones to avoid yanking his whole setup off his desk with the still plugged-in wire and scrambling out his chair before Kacchan could pull him all the way into the kitchen. \u201cBe right back, everyone!\u201d he chirped, pausing the game with a little wave at the camera before following Kacchan into the kitchen, where his friend had started putting things away after abandoning Izuku\u2019s chair in the bedroom doorway. \u201cThanks, Kacchan!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it next time,\u201d Kacchan responded, tossing him a bag of vegetables to put in the fridge.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Izuku answered, \u201cBut only if you give me a list, otherwise I\u2019m buying all the wrong things again and you\u2019ll get mad at me.\u201d \n\u201cI got mad at you because you bought two fucking vegetables, Deku,\u201d Kacchan huffed, glaring at Izuku out of the corner of his eye. Izuku grinned back sheepishly grabbing some more items from the grocery bag to put away and finding that Kacchan has bought a few small cartons of strawberry milk.\n\u201cAh!\u201d Izuku gasped, \u201cThank you, Kacchan!\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kacchan said, not even looking up to see what Izuku was talking about, \u201cJust make sure to save some for the rest of the idiots.\u201d\n\u201cAw, Kacchan, you\u2019re being nice again,\u201d Izuku smiled, only for his smile to drop as Kacchan turned to glare menacingly at him, revealing the eyes of a design student on crunch time that did not need to be messed with right now. \u201cI gotta go back to my stream now thank you bye!\u201d he blurted before making his quick, tactical retreat back to the bedroom with a carton of strawberry milk and a fuzzy feeling in his chest. Kacchan seemed to love pretending that he thought of his friends on accident or only in passing, but that didn\u2019t change the sweet things he did every so often. \n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d he announced, slipping his headphones back on and lifting his carton, \u201cand Kacchan bought me strawberry milk!\u201d\n\nChat\n\nLesbianNebula: yum!! (*^\u25bd^*)\nNerdCandy: wow kacchan how kind of u \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\nRedWingHawks: simp behavior methinks\u2026\ncarrotstix: I love strawberry milk!! &lt;3\nDabiDabiDoo: is kacchan going to play with you?? I missed him last night im sad\nBubblegumMirko: wait I wanna hear more about the nomus! (/\u2267\u25bd\u2266)/\nIzuku elected to ignore the comments about Kacchan, sipping his milk as his cheeks heated even thinking about the suggestion of the possibility of Kacchan doing anything close to simping for him, instead focusing on the messages on what he\u2019d been rambling about before. \n\u201cOkay, back to what I was talking about,\u201d he smiled, setting down the milk carton, \u201cthe nomu character that I was fighting was designed by Horikoshi way back in the very first All Might comics, which is why merch designs nowadays still have nomus with those bat-like wings even though they\u2019re all so different!\u201d He glanced back at the posters on his side of the room to look for any sign of the nomu that he could show the viewers, only for the door to the bedroom to open again as Kacchan came back in.\n\u201cWait, nerd, before you get back into your dumb shit,\u201d he smirked, and Izuku noticed one hand hidden behind his back. His childhood instincts immediately screamed at him to run away from whatever Kacchan was holding, so he shuffled his chair back a bit. \n\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d he said, trying to hold back a nervous laugh as Kacchan continued to smirk at him. Then, to his surprise, Kacchan stepped between him and his desk, effectively blocking out the camera with a view of his back. Izuku was suddenly so overwhelmed by Kacchan smirking at him from point-blank range that he hardly noticed his friend slipping something over his head until he\u2019d left, not a word more spoken and hot-faced Izuku in his wake. Well.\nIzuku blinked a few times at nothing to get his brain back in order, then focused on his tiny self in the corner of his monitor to see just what Kacchan had put on him, hoping it was nothing that would embarrass him more than he was already. He couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter when he found a pair of bunny ears on his head, and he didn\u2019t try to, making sure to glare the best he could out his open doorway as he did. \u201cI was seven, Kacchan!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Small Might!\u201d Kacchan yelled back, and Izuku could clearly imagine the subtle smile he was no doubt wearing somewhere in their living room. \u201cGo eat your fucking carrots!\u201d\n\u201cThey were not bunny ears!\u201d Izuku protested through another laugh, remembering the hero costumes he and Kacchan had designed as little kids. He turned to address the camera. \u201cThey were so I could look like All Might.\u201d\nThe chat, meanwhile, seemed to be going crazy with the new developments.\n\nChat\n\nRedWingHawks: HWY DID HE LOOK SO BUFF IM GONNA SDFL\u2019;DFL;JD\nHoneyComb: aklskdfl deku you look adorable!!\nMightyShield: KACCHAN??\nFrogzz: Deku why are you blushing sm \ud83d\udc40\n[MOD] TheEighthUser: deku and kacchan lore??? explain pls??\nRedWingHawks: KACCHAN COME BACK\nedamame: bunny ears!!! dekubun!!\nBurntToast: what is happening\nLoserpixels: is this flirting?\nPhoenixShadow: decchan backstory?? what bunny ears??\nNerdCandy: STRAWBERRY MILK AND NOW THIS\nIzuku felt his face heat up dramatically once again, and he covered his burning cheeks with his hand in an attempt to not give himself away any further. God, this was mortifying. \n\u201cOkay, okay, let me explain, guys,\u201d he managed, dropping his hand back to his keyboard. \u201cWhen Kacchan and I were kids, we designed ourselves hero costumes, and I added little things to the top of mine \u2013\u201d he held his hands up to his head, mimicking the front parts of All Might\u2019s hair \u201c \u2013 like this, so I could look like All Might, of course!\u201d He put his hands down again and faked a pout. \u201cBut everyone thought they were bunny ears and Kacchan has never stopped making fun of me for it.\u201d\nHe aimed his voice out the door towards his roommate. \u201cAs if you weren\u2019t the one who put grenades or your arms!\u201d \n\u201cThose were badass!\u201d Kacchan yelled back, apparently close enough to hear him and making Izuku laugh.\n\u201cSure they were, King Explosion Murder!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Great King Explosion Murder God Dynamight to you, loser!\u201d\n\u201cRight, right,\u201d Izuku laughed, smiling comfortably at the old memories that came with that dorky nickname, \u201cGreat King Explosion Murder God Dynamight. Imagine that guy being your best friend. I was the luckiest kid on the block.\u201d He glanced at the clock in the corner of his computer screen to see that it had been a few hours since he started and sat up a little more in his chair, stretching out his shoulders. \u201cAlright, everyone, I think I\u2019m going to call it there since I still got homework to do. See you all later and thank you for stopping by!\u201d \n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\nneon-froggy\n\nGREAT KING EXPLOSION MURDER GOD DYNAMIGHT??\n#everything about the end of that stream was GOD TIER for the decchans #oh my god #childhood friends moments?? #kacchan on screen?? #strawberry milk?!? #BUNNY EARS?!?!? #DEKU BLUSHING?!?!?!? #PERFECTION #deku #kacchan\n\u00a0\n\nboomboombitches\n\nlisten. listen. of course I have thought about what kacchan looks like and of course I assumed he\u2019d be hot because of his voice but none of that could\u2019ve prepared me for seeing him be THAT MUSCULAR??

Not that his disinterest had ever stopped her or ever would \u2013 every single one of the four idiots he hung out with would talk his ear off before letting his bad attitude towards socialization get in the way of their rambles. Annoying shits.\n\u201cThis one has like, two thousand followers,\u201d Mina continued, scrolling through her phone from her seat near the other end of the large workroom table covered in scattered fabric scraps and sketch pages. \u201c\u2019I could literally fall asleep to his voice it\u2019s so soothing\u2019,\u201d she read aloud, followed by a poorly hidden laugh, \u201cThat\u2019s one way of describing it.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki countered, marking the length of a pattern piece on his drawing and glancing up to inspect the mannequin he\u2019d pinned his mockups to earlier. He honestly couldn\u2019t care less about fan accounts or weird extras fawning over his voice on the internet as long as they didn\u2019t fuck with him directly or get creepy. It helped that he avoided social media like it was the plague, and therefore never had to see that shit.\n\u201cOoh, this person is freaking out about your shoulders,\u201d Mina said with an eyebrow raised, looking over at Katsuki with a look of appraisal. \u201cFair.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Katsuki scowled, \u201cthat\u2019s weird as shit.\u201d\nMina shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say, Blasty, people are drawn to mystery, and you\u2019ve created quite the persona.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve said,\u201d Katsuki grumbled, snapping his sketchbook closed and raking a hand through his hair with a huff. \u201cBunch a fuckin\u2019 extras don\u2019t need to know shit about me.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t help that everyone\u2019s got a crush on Mido but can obviously tell he\u2019s only got eyes for you,\u201d Mina added nonchalantly, followed by a loud crack from Katsuki accidentally snapping his pencil in half by gripping it too tightly. \n\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he snapped, ears dangerously warm as Mina gave him the least believable look of innocence he\u2019d ever seen.\n\u201cWhat, I\u2019m just saying!\u201d\nKatsuki glared at her. \u201cI fucking told you to stop it with that shit.\u201d Over the past few years, Mina seemed to have developed a Todoroki-level conspiracy that led her to believing Deku had some kind of crush on Katsuki. Which was an absurd fucking idea, and Katsuki didn\u2019t think that from lack of confidence in himself, but merely from the fact that it was Deku. It\u2019s not like the looks he gave Katsuki were any different than those he gave to limited edition All Might merchandise. The fucking dork blushed when his own mother called him a \u2018handsome young man\u2019. He was Deku. They were friends. Enough said.\n\u201cThe internet agrees with me, Katsuki!\u201d Mina protested, waving her phone around in its fluffy pink phone case as if that argument helped her in any way. \u201cHe likes you back!\u201d\nKatsuki stood up so fast his chair went screeching backwards and nearly toppled over. \u201cI never fucking said I like him!\u201d he yelled, glaring at Mina, who seemed entirely unperturbed.\n\u201cYeah, but you never talk about your feelings anyway,\u201d she pointed out, sounding like Katsuki\u2019s therapist or her fucking girlfriend, \u201cyou\u2019re more of a \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019 guy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you if you don\u2019t shut the hell up,\u201d Katsuki threatened, not at all interested in a breakdown of his character for Mina to prove he had a thing for the nerd. Which he didn\u2019t. Or at least, not that much of a thing.\n\u201cEven now, you\u2019re not denying it-\u201d\n\u201cYou know what, fuck you, you can go home by yourself,\u201d Katsuki interrupted with his ears burning red, snatching his stuff of the worktable and starting out the door.\n\u201cWait, no, Katsuki!\u201d Mina yelped, scrambling to collect all her things and chase after him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m just trying to help out!\u201d\n\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t fucking needed or appreciated,\u201d Katsuki snapped, \u201cStay out of my damn business.\u201d He did not have feelings for Deku. Would he say yes if Deku offered? Sure. Well, maybe. Deku would never do that anyway so the question was irrelevant.\nMina sighed, her heeled leather boots clacking on the floor of their school hallways as Katsuki\u2019s intimidating presence cleared their way through any other students who happened to be there this late into the day \u2013 which was most of them, thanks to final projects being due soon. \u201cI swear there\u2019s something between you two.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s called fucking friendship,\u201d Katsuki said, glaring at her as they exited the building they were in and headed for the train station. \u201cDeku\u2019s not into me and the internet is fucking insane.\u201d\n\u201cRandom question, but do you even watch his streams?\u201d Mina asked.\n\u201cWhy the hell would I do that when I see his stupid face every damn day,\u201d Katsuki responded, scowling. He lived with the nerd, he didn\u2019t need to watch him through a screen to see him ramble about All Might and suck at video games for three hours. He\u2019d been seeing that shit every day since he was four. Mina sighed again. \u201cYou fucking got something else to say, bubblegum?\u201d he snapped.\n\u201cI\u2019m too tired for this, topic dropped,\u201d Mina said, adjusting the bag over her shoulder, \u201cYour mess of a love live can wait until after I\u2019ve killed these stupid finals and established myself as queen of fashion school.\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d\n\u201cYou can be king, but Ochako might hit you.\u201d\n\u201cFuck her, I can be king if I \u2013 I mean fuck you, my love life is not a mess!\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki and Mina parted ways after disembarking the train at the same stop, Mina heading to the small apartment she shared with Uraraka and Katsuki to the one he shared with Deku. As he expected, Katsuki entered the apartment to the sound of Deku chattering away to whatever nerds seemed so inclined to hear what he had to say, most likely not hearing him come in. Instead of going to bother him like usual, Katsuki went straight to the kitchen to start dinner, because he\u2019d been so busy today at school that he\u2019d pulled a Deku and forgotten to eat lunch.\nAs he moved about the kitchen, gathering everything he needed to throw together a meal of leftover curry and whatever else he thought would be good, he found himself unconsciously tuning into Deku\u2019s bubbly voice through the wall. He was talking about the comparative powers of characters in a superhero fighting game, pointing out some secret move he found out about by trying to copy the character\u2019s move in a comic book he read, and he sounded so damn interested and happy about it that Katsuki had the strange urge to bang his head into a wall.\nIt wasn\u2019t because he was into him, though. Because, again, while he could admit that Deku was cute \u2013 sometimes \u2013 he wasn\u2019t dying to date him or anything. That would be\u2026why was he even thinking about this. Mina was seeing things, extras on the internet didn\u2019t matter in the slightest, it was whatever.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d he called out, mostly to get his brain away from stupid thoughts and back to reality.\n\u201cHi Kacchan!\u201d Deku called back after a moment, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \n\u201cYou want curry?\u201d\nInstead of an answer, he got Deku blurting something to his viewers and practically racing out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. \u201cNo, don\u2019t make stuff!\u201d he cried, slapping his hands down on the counter with a pout, \u201cI was gonna make you dinner tonight because you\u2019re working so hard on things.\u201d\nKatsuki tried to frown at him and ignore the traitorous heat in his face and ears at the sight of Deku still wearing the stupid bunny ears he\u2019d apparently put on at some point and forgotten to take off, his nose crinkled up with the pout like he was, well, a rabbit. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI just said!\u201d Deku admonished, throwing his hands up then grabbing Katsuki by the arm to start dragging him out of the kitchen, \u201cYou\u2019ve been working really hard on school, and you made dinner the past few days, so now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just reheating curry,\u201d Katsuki pointed out, letting himself be pulled away regardless until Deku deposited him behind the counter that split the kitchen from the living room.\n\u201cShush,\u201d Deku said, \u201cI am making you dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna burn something for sure,\u201d Katsuki countered. Deku was a perfectly fine baker, but for whatever reason he couldn\u2019t cook for shit.\n\u201cI will not,\u201d Deku objected, returning to the other side of the counter and looking at the food Katsuki had already gotten out, \u201cYou\u2019ll be watching me the whole time and you\u2019d never let that happen.\u201d\nKatsuki snorted, leaning forward to prop his elbow up on the counter and rest his chin on his fist. \u201cAlright, bunny.\u201d\nThere was a loud crash as Deku literally yanked the spice drawer he had been looking in off its hinges, making Katsuki shoot up straight again in surprise. Deku yelped, quickly lifting the drawer up and fitting it back where it belonged, muttering something incoherent and nervous as he did.\n\u201cWhat the hell, nerd?\u201d Katsuki snapped with a barely hidden laugh, \u201cFine, you\u2019re not burning shit, you\u2019re breaking shit!\u201d\n\u201cI-you-it was-shut up,\u201d Deku stammered, burying his surely red face in his hands and turning away from Katsuki. Katsuki snorted again, which got Deku to laugh and fold over the counter in embarrassment. \u201cYou saw nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI saw plenty,\u201d Katsuki countered, \u201cYou\u2019re destroying our kitchen.\u201d\n\u201cIt was your fault!\u201d Deku protested, whirling around to face Katsuki and reveal that his cheeks were, in fact, beet red.\n\u201cHow the fuck was it my fault?\u201d\n\u201cYou were the one who-\u201d Deku cut himself off with one accusatory finger held out, meeting Katsuki\u2019s eyes for a second before looking away. \u201cAaaagh, I hate you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell did I do?\u201d Katsuki pressed, raising an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou called me bunny!\u201d Deku blurted, throwing his hands up. \nKatsuki\u2019s brain shut down. Rebooted. And then, finally, he barked a laugh. \u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019re wearing the fucking ears, dumbass.\u201d\nDeku\u2019s eyes went wide, and he slowly reached up to pat the top of his head and find that the ears were actually still there. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, stupid, what the fuck did you think I was saying,\u201d Katsuki scoffed.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Deku squeaked, a little too fast, taking the ears off and tossing them on the counter, \u201cNothing at all. Who knows? It was whatever.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026kay,\u201d Katsuki said, narrowing his eyes as Deku gave him an awkward smile and turned back to the food. Fuckin\u2019 weirdo.\n\u201cAnyways!\u201d Deku said, a little too loud as he set the timer on the microwave, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d\n\u201c\u2019S fine,\u201d Katsuki answered, leaning on the counter again, \u201cMade progress on my shit, Miss Midnight was annoying as fuck, nothing new.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d she do this time?\u201d Deku asked, by now familiar with Katsuki\u2019s history of fashion teacher due to his consistent complaints about nearly everything she did \u2013 he would admit she knew what she was doing, but that didn\u2019t make it any less bothersome when she lectured for an hour about bondage gear making its way into mainstream fashion and said nothing about what she actually should\u2019ve been talking about. It wasn\u2019t like he needed her to tell him that when the way she dressed was proof enough.\n\u201cToday was all about fuckin\u2019 boob windows,\u201d Katsuki said.\nDeku laughed. \u201cI bet Mina had fun with that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nHoney | mirko\u2019s fluffy tail @honeycomb\nthe way deku heard kacchan call for him then /immediately/ stopped streaming\u2026.deku do you have something to share with the class\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @honeycomb gay gay homosexual gay\nall might is gay @mightyshield\nReplying to @honeycomb not to mention his eyes LIGHTING UP when kacchan called his name uggghh they\u2019re so OBVIOUS I STG\ndeku my beloved &lt;3 @twelveturtles\nDeku wearing the bunny ears again on stream!!

Today\u2019s goal was to, apparently, cut Uraraka\u2019s hair so she could have the \u201clesbian undercut of her dreams\u201d \u2013 Mina\u2019s words, not his. Oh, and they were doing it on stream, because of course they were.\n\u201cWhy the fuck aren\u2019t we just going to a hairdresser\u2019s?\u201d Katsuki asked, not for the first time but still confused as to why he had to be standing behind a camera as five whole people squeezed into the tiny apartment\u2019s bathroom. Deku was perched on the lip of the bathtub for space. Todoroki was sitting in the bathtub.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s way more fun this way,\u201d Mina answered, plugging the electric razor into the wall socket. She flicked it on, making it buzz loudly, and Katsuki immediately bristled. \n\u201cBe fucking careful with that thing!\u201d he snapped. \nMina shut the razor off and grinned at him. \u201cChill out, mama bear, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d Katsuki scowled.\n\u201cIt means you\u2019re the mom friend,\u201d Uraraka answered from her stool in the middle of the bathroom, digging her hand into a bag of chips then passing them to Deku, who was nodding along with her. Traitor.\n\u201cYou would make a wonderful mother,\u201d Todoroki commented from the bathtub, \u201cYou\u2019ve packed us all lunch before, and there was that time at the museum.\u201d\n\u201cMama bear Kacchan,\u201d Deku agreed with a shit-eating grin.\n\u201cI fucking hate all of you,\u201d Katsuki grumbled. \n\u201cLove you too, Kacchan,\u201d all four of the idiots responded in unison, because they were a hive mind formed with the sole purpose of annoying the shit out of him on the daily. Letting people make friends with him was a mistake and he\u2019d known that since the second he laid eyes on one Todoroki Shouto.\n\u201cDie.\u201d\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d Uraraka said, grinning at him smugly.\n\u201cKill me yourself,\u201d Deku challenged, sticking his tongue out.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been dead for thirty years,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned.\n\u201cHaircut time!\u201d Mina announced. Katsuki, who had been busy sticking his tongue back out at Deku while flipping him off, turned his attention back to the unfolding disaster and kept careful watch on the electric razor. Who fucking cares if he\u2019s a mom friend \u2013 if he weren\u2019t, these dumbasses would\u2019ve died a long time ago.\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Uraraka chirped, clapping her hands and turning her attention to the computer screen while Mina started collecting parts of her hair into a ponytail, \u201cThis is a Q and A, so let\u2019s hear some questions! They can be for any of us \u2018cause we\u2019re all here.\u201d\n\u201cI ain\u2019t answering shit,\u201d Katsuki corrected, hoisting himself up to sit on the bathroom counter.\n\u201cYou always say that,\u201d Deku pointed out, tossing another chip in his mouth, \u201cAnd you always end up talking.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you never get anything right!\u201d Katsuki snapped\n\u201cFirst question!\u201d Uraraka said, interrupting what would\u2019ve surely turned into yet another wrestling match, \u201cHow long have you and Mina been together?\u201d\n\u201cThree years by next month,\u201d Mina answered, leaning down to kiss her girlfriend\u2019s forehead as Uraraka tiled her head back to grin up at her. Katsuki didn\u2019t miss the look Deku gave them, like he was seeing the most adorable puppy in the world and lamenting the fact that he didn\u2019t have one back home. Did the nerd want a fucking dog?\nKatsuki did not at all like the fact that he found himself wondering about what breed. He. Did. Not. Care. And that analogy was stupid.\n\u201cWe started dating in high school!\u201d Uraraka continued, \u201cFirst year.\u201d \n\u201cThank god we didn\u2019t have to endure that pining for another two years,\u201d Deku added good-naturedly, and Katsuki was inclined to agree. The two of them had never stop staring at each other or stuttering over words like the smitten messes they were, and it was infuriating to watch.\nUraraka, Mina, and Todoroki didn\u2019t seem to have the same idea, however, if their blank stares in Deku\u2019s direction were anything to go by. Deku stared back at them nervously.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Todoroki finally monotoned, \u201cThank god there\u2019s been zero pining in this group of friends since then.\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Mina answered, for some reason glancing at Katsuki then dead into the camera.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you three talking about?\u201d Katsuki cut in, scowling at them. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d Uraraka said, not even looking at him, \u201cNext question!\u201d\nThe next few rounds of questions Katsuki mostly tuned out, bored by answers to things he already knew and shit that really had nothing to do with him. He never said it aloud, as he\u2019d never felt the need to, but sometimes hanging around these idiots was enough by itself to melt away his stress, if only for a moment. He\u2019d never really thought he\u2019d have that feeling with anyone but Deku, but there was at least a version of it with the other three. No matter how fucking annoying they were.\nHe tuned back in a bit when he heard Deku say his name, glancing up slightly to find him grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s what Kacchan used to call me when we were kids! My real name\u2019s kanji could be misread as \u2018Deku\u2019 and Kacchan thought that was funny, then it kinda stuck around.\u201d Ah, someone had asked about the nickname again. \u201cKacchan and Deku are actually both childhood nicknames!\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mina cut in, \u201cand if any of us non-Dekus call him Kacchan off stream he tries to kill us.\u201d Katsuki scowled at her, and she just smiled sweetly in response and went back to her attempts at cutting Uraraka\u2019s hair.\nHe tuned back in all the way when Uraraka laughed obnoxiously loud, reading something off her screen. \u201cMidori-Cat asks if Kacchan is, quote, as hot as he sounds.\u201d She snorted again, glancing over at him. \u201cI dunno, how hot does he sound?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki grumbled, flipping her off as he did.\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not into men, so I can\u2019t really pass judgement on that,\u201d Uraraka said, ignoring him, \u201cAny guy-lovers want to answer for the dear viewers? Scale of one to ten.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s like\u2026a solid nine,\u201d Mina smirked. \n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Katsuki objected, \u201cI\u2019m a damn twelve!\u201d\n\u201cAnd a fifteen if you\u2019re not making the gremlin faces,\u201d someone muttered, and Katsuki had to do a mental double-take to make sure it had really been Deku, staring at a spot on the floor with the look he got when his mind was half-somewhere else. Everyone was dead silent for a moment, then Uraraka broke into a small grin.\n\u201cSo you think he\u2019s hot?\u201d she asked before Katsuki could stop her.\n\u201cYeah, duuuuu-\u201d Deku\u2019s eyes slowly went wide as he glanced up and seemingly remembered where he was and who exactly he was with \u201c-uuaaaaAAAAAH I MEAN MAYBE,\u201d he yelped, cheeks turning red as Katsuki felt his own ears burn, \u201cI was-I wasn\u2019t-I mean he is, you are, I just\u2026\u201d Deku trailed off, then broke eye contact with Katsuki and jumped to his feet, \u201cI have to go to the bathroom!\u201d\nThe room was quiet for a few beats of awkward silence after Deku made his escape, Uraraka looking very pleased with herself while Katsuki tried not to let his brain turn into a pile of scrambled eggs or a dumpster fire. Eventually, Todoroki piped up, again from his seat in the bathtub, \u201cWe\u2019re already in the bathroom.\u201d\nWhat an astute fucking observation, Half-n-half.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nA;LSKDJHSLA;FJS;FK; SCREAMS FOR SIX HOURS THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REAL!!!!\nHoney | mirko\u2019s fluffy tail @honeycomb\nReplying to @freckledeku what happened???\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @freckldeku DID YOU NOT WATCH OCHAKO\u2019S STREAM HONEY???\nHoney | mirko\u2019s fluffy tail @honeycomb\nReplying to @freckledeku I HAD SCHOOL \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @honeycomb GO FIND IT ON YOUTUBE RN DEKU CALLED KACCHAN HOT THEN GAY PANICKED\nHoney | mirko\u2019s fluffy tail @honeycomb\nReplying to @freckledeku OH MY GODDDDD I NEED TO SEE\nmoon @moono_pixie\nnot the rest of the dekusquad basically confirming that kacchan and deku have been pining after each other for YEARS \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d mina looked so Done with them I swear\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nIn the ten minutes it took for Izuku to finally come back into the bathroom, Uraraka had graciously moved onto other questions while Izuku tried to set his brain back in order and wished he could disappear off the face of the planet. One second he was listening to his friends having a good time and poking fun at Kacchan, the next he was muttering things out loud and admitting things he really should be keeping in his head. He tried calming himself down by thinking of all the ways it could\u2019ve been worse \u2013 he could\u2019ve told Kacchan he looked cute when he was sleeping or that one very strange night in second year where he dreamed about his arms, however that would\u2019ve come up naturally \u2013 but all that succeeded in doing was making him feel like his face was melting off. If there were any god that loved him, he\u2019d have been struck down by lighting right then and there.\nBut there was no god, at least not a merciful one, and he had to go back inside before anyone started worrying about him.\nThankfully, the topic was not brought up again, but Izuku could feel Kacchan\u2019s eyes on him almost the entire time, right up until his roommate got distracted by Mina\u2019s haircut job and started snapping directions at her. Mina argued that her mom was a hairdresser, Kacchan countered that \u201cthat shit\u2019s not exactly hereditary knowledge\u201d, and they ended up lowering the camera so he could take over without his face being seen. He also threatened to shave Uraraka\u2019s head all the way. Todoroki made another mom friend comment. It was whole thing.\nIn fact, Izuku got so caught up in the normal chaos of all his friends in one place that he almost completely forgot about his entire debacle until he and Kacchan were all the way back at their apartment building, riding up the elevator in comfortable silence. It was almost like Kacchan had been waiting to trap him where he couldn\u2019t run away.\n\u201cSo\u2026,\u201d Kacchan started, raising an eyebrow as he leaned back against the wall, hands in his pockets like some 80s greaser high school sweetheart, \u201cfifteen out of ten, huh?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s face lit on metaphorical fire in seconds. Kill him. Kill him right now. Code red brain meltdown initiated oh hell this was bad. \u201cUh,\u201d he managed eloquently, unable to meet Kacchan\u2019s eyes from the sheer embarrassment that could only come from admitting that you thought your best friend was attractive, to his face, after years of managing to keep that yourself. Someone get him a scientist to classify him as a natural (bisexual) disaster. Oh god.\n\u201cI\u2019d say\u2026three,\u201d Kacchan said, making Izuku look up with a hint of confusion. He was met with a smirk and a look in Kacchan\u2019s crimson eyes that made him shove his hands in his pockets so as not to fan himself like an overdramatic Victorian woman. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe five on a good day,\u201d Kacchan continued, and in the few seconds it took for things to finally click in Izuku\u2019s brain, the elevator door opened and Kacchan pushed himself off the wall.\n\u201cYou jerk,\u201d Izuku pouted, narrowing his eyes at his friend and following him out of the elevator, \u201cI\u2019m at least an eight.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to who, your mom?\u201d Kacchan scoffed, smirk transforming further into what was more of a teasing smile, \u201cNews flash, Deku, Auntie has to say that, she\u2019s your mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re calling my mother a liar?\u201d Izuku gasped in mock offense, \u201cShe would never!\u201d He grinned, throwing his arm around Kacchan\u2019s neck and yanking him down into a headlock. \u201cNow take that back!\u201d\n\u201cFuck no!\u201d Kacchan yelled, suddenly wrapping his arms around Izuku\u2019s hips and lifting him off his feet before he could stop him. Izuku yelped, finding himself hoisted over Kacchan\u2019s shoulder like a sack of flustered potatoes, his headlock attempt completely thwarted in what was arguably the best and worst way possible. \u201cUgly loser.\u201d\n\u201cPut me down!\u201d Izuku demanded, unable to stop laughter from permeating his complaints. He kicked his feet around, trying to hit Kacchan in the face, but Kacchan just shoved his feet away with a snort of laughter. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m gonna\u2026,\u201d Izuku said, then trailed off, not entirely sure what he was going to do. In a split-second decision he decided on hugging around Kacchan\u2019s waist like an upside-down koala, thereby shoving his nose into Kacchan\u2019s shirt. \n\u201cWhat the fuck are you even doing?\u201d Kacchan guffawed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Izuku laughed, squeezing tighter as the blood rushed to his head. Kacchan was having zero problems carrying him, huh? \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna puke, honest-\u201d\nAnd then their neighbor\u2019s door opened. \nIzuku snapped his mouth shut with a slight sense of dread, slowly tilting his head to the side to meet eyes with an elderly gentleman in his pajamas, holding his room\u2019s door open and staring Izuku down with harsh, judgmental old man eyes as Izuku hung upside down over Kacchan\u2019s shoulder. Uh.\n\u201cGood evening, Mr. Kiyabu,\u201d Izuku finally said after far too many moments of uncomfortable silence, smiling awkwardly, \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well.\u201d\n\u201cLater, gramps,\u201d Kacchan cut in rudely before Mr. Kiyabu could respond, quickly unlocking the door to their apartment, carrying Izuku inside, and slamming the door closed behind them. \nThe second the door to their apartment shut, the two of them broke into laughter, Kacchan practically squealing like a boiling kettle as he barely made it to the couch to dump Izuku off his shoulder. Izuku, for his part, was laughing so hard his abdomen hurt and he was starting to find it difficult to breath. Kacchan\u2019s barks of laughter dissolved into giggles, then snorts, then he all but collapsed onto his knees and pressed his forehead into the coffee table, his entire body shaking. The entire scene only made Izuku laugh harder than he already was, and he was pretty sure he was going to die soon.\n\u201cGood-,\u201d Kacchan finally managed, sucking in a breath that turned into a squeal, \u201cgood evening? You fucking-HAH!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what else to say!\u201d Izuku protested through a wheeze, gripping his stomach and shoving his face into the couch cushions. This was always how things ended up when he started laughing too hard with Kacchan \u2013 he\u2019d be lucky if he weren\u2019t still snickering about this by tomorrow morning. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna hate us now for sure.\u201d\n\"Now?\u201d Kacchan barked, snorting, \u201cThat asshole hated us since we moved in!\u201d\nIzuku rolled over on his back, trying to take deep breaths as the last bits of laughter forced their way out. \u201cThat\u2019s your \u2013 hah \u2013 your fault, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the fuck does everything gotta be my fault?\u201d Kacchan groaned, reaching over to slap Izuku\u2019s arm half-heartedly.\n\u201cBecause!\u201d Izuku laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who carried way too many boxes at once to prove you were stronger than me, then almost kicked down his door because you couldn\u2019t see which-\u201d\n\u201cShut the hell up.\u201d\n\u201c-which one was ours,\u201d Izuku pressed on, \u201cand then I almost ran into you because you were outside the wrong door, and then you got mad because I almost ran into you, and then you almost dropped my bronze age figurine, which was really expensive and you-AH!\u201d Kacchan yanked him off the couch before he could finish rambling, making them both narrowly miss the coffee table as the tumbled to the ground, Izuku landing face-down on top of Kacchan with a yelp.\n\u201cGah! Get the fuck offa\u2019 me!\u201d Kacchan snapped, shoving him to the side where he hit the couch, making it screech backwards a bit until there was just enough space for Izuku to flop over on his back, head resting on Kacchan\u2019s arm and halfway under the couch as he laughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who-,\u201d he cut himself off with a giggle, tilting his head to the side to better look at Kacchan, \u201c-you\u2019re the one who yanked me on top of you!\u201d\nKacchan stared back at him strangely for a moment, his expression unusually soft. He almost looked surprised. Izuku felt his face grow warm. \u201cFine,\u201d Kacchan said eventually, pushing the coffee table out of the way and sitting up, \u201ceight on a good day.\u201d\nBy the time Izuku registered what he meant, Kacchan had already disappeared into the bedroom, and he sat up so fast he banged his head into the bottom of the couch. \u201cOW!\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s head hurt for the rest of the day, but he was a little to busy trying not to fall apart while getting all his schoolwork done to think about it much. The most Kacchan had ever said about Izuku\u2019s look was teasing him for having bird\u2019s nest hair or calling him ugly after he just woke up. The most Izuku had ever said back was absolutely nothing, because he knew the second he did it would turn right into every time he complimented anything about Kacchan, which is to say he\u2019d ramble for an hour and embarrass the hell out himself. \nNot to mention the split-second thought he\u2019d had about kissing him, which had since occupied his panicked mind for hours before he finally fell asleep. His tiny, accidental comment/confession had somehow spiraled into a full-on crisis. Kacchan was cool and talented and good-looking and amazing and Izuku knew all that, had always known all that, but for whatever reason was only now panicking about it. \nKacchan would never want to date him. Another thing he knew.\nBut did he want to date Kacchan?\nNo, he didn\u2019t, that would be crazy because Kacchan\u2019s just his best friend in the entire world but they\u2019re not-\n\u201cHey nerd.\u201d\nIzuku startled a bit and glanced up to find Kacchan leaning over the kitchen counter, propped up on his elbows with his somehow perfect bedhead that Izuku had always envied, reading glasses perched on his nose as he gave Izuku a somewhat sleepy smirk that really just looked like a smile. He sounded like he woke up two minutes ago. And he was giving Izuku that look again.\n\u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\nOh no.\nOh no, this was very incredibly bad. \nNot that he looked like shit \u2013 Kacchan told him that all the time \u2013 but the fact that he was feeling feelings that he did not want to be feeling right now.\n\u201cYup,\u201d he managed like an idiot, quickly busying himself with grabbing breakfast so as not to stare at Kacchan any longer and blush at him any harder, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve got a lot of, uh, work I need to finish today so I\u2019ll probably be in our room for a while,\u201d he blurted, an excuse for the way he was planning to run right back into his bedroom and scream into a pillow. \n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Kacchan said, almost sounding disappointed but most likely just confused as Izuku grabbed a bowl of rice and literally nothing else that might be a part of a sane breakfast, \u201cTalk to you later I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYep!\u201d Izuku responded, voice very nearly cracking in the middle of the word as he escaped to the bedroom and away from ~Kacchan~, \u201cHave fun in your classes!\u201d he called for politeness\u2019s sake as he shut the door, almost entirely sure the unsuspicious factor had been completely thrown out the window at this point.\nThen, he flopped face-down on his bed, shoved his face into his pillow, and tried not to scream too loud. As soon as that was out of his system, he sat up, grabbed his phone, and opened it to his contacts. There was absolutely no way he was working through this by himself if he knew anything about his ramble-y, panicky brain, and the amount he was freaking out right now. For the record, he thought it was a perfectly logical amount to be freaking out about possibly definitely being romantically interested in the man you\u2019ve been best friends with since you were four.\nOchako picked up after a few rings, sounding cheery, \u201cHey Deku! What\u2019s-\u201d\n\u201cThe internet people were right I think,\u201d Izuku blurted without thinking.\nThere was a beat of confused silence on the other end of the phone, then, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe people on the internet,\u201d Izuku repeated, brain running to fast to think about Ochako\u2019s utter lack of context, \u201cI think they might have been right.\u201d\n\u201cAbout\u2026?\u201d Ochako prompted, and Izuku bluescreened. He didn\u2019t think this whole \u2018talking\u2019 thing through at all. \u201cDeku? Are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku blurted again, then quickly backtracked, \u201cI mean yes. Physically yes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you having a panic attack? Let me call Baku-\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku yelped, waving his hands around in a panic, \u201cNope! Not a panic attack, don\u2019t call Kacchan! No Kacchan needed, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fine, I shouldn\u2019t have even-\u201d\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Ochako interrupted in a commanding voice that made him shut his mouth immediately, imagining the look on his friend\u2019s face, \u201cDeep breaths, please.\u201d \n\u201cI, uh\u2026right, okay,\u201d Izuku conceded, inhaling deeply before letting it out and trying to make his heart stop racing. He wasn\u2019t in danger; it was just feelings. \u201cOkay,\u201d he repeated with another deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m good now.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Ochako responded, \u201cnow, what\u2019s wrong? What internet people?\u201d\n\u201cThere are\u2026uh, there are rumors on the internet that I\u2026like Kacchan,\u201d Izuku explained awkwardly, bouncing his leg up and down with nervous energy, \u201cIn the\u2026you know, romantic sense. Like I want to\u2026\u201d he felt his face go red and wondered why he was still talking \u201c\u2026hold his hand?\u201d he decided on instead of something that might\u2019ve made him combust internally.\n\u201cI\u2026okay,\u201d Ochako said, probably even more baffled now. Izuku was being so weird right now, \u201cand they\u2019re\u2026right?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Izuku squeaked, grabbing his pillow to shove his face into, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cDeku, you\u2019ve held Bakugou\u2019s hand before. I\u2019ve seen that,\u201d Ochako said, matter-of-fact.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku protested, face hot, \u201cI mean\u2026the other part.\u201d\n\u201cThe romantic feelings,\u201d Ochako clarified, and Izuku wished he could fall through the floor, \u201cYou have romantic feelings for Bakugou.\u201d\nIzuku nodded into the pillow before remembering Ochako couldn\u2019t see him and mumbling, \u201cYeah.\u201d\nTo his surprise, Ochako just huffed a laugh. \u201cTook you damn long enough. I coulda\u2019 told you that back in first year!\u201d\nIzuku simply did not understand. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Deku,\u201d Ochako said, sounding way too happy about this. Then, she laughed again. What the hell. \u201cThis is great! Finally!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku repeated, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not great! What the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cUh, take him out to dinner?\u201d Ochako answered like that should\u2019ve been obvious, \u201cThen buy me, Mina, and Todoroki some champagne so we can celebrate. Or we could just steal some from old man Enji.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku said for the third time, this time almost a shriek until he remembered Kacchan might still be on the other side of the door, \u201cTake him out to-Ochako, no! No, no, no! I can\u2019t do that!\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\u201cBecause he\u2019d say no?\u201d Izuku explained, baffled as to why Ochako seemed to think otherwise.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019d say\u2026oh my god.\u201d Ochako sighed heavily. \u201cI celebrated too soon.\u201d\n\u201cOchako, what in the world are you going on about?\u201d Izuku asked, feeling tears start to well. Ochako must have recognized the change in his voice.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Deku, I got ahead of myself,\u201d she apologized, \u201cYou called me freaking out about this. Tell me why.\u201d\n\u201cI already told you why,\u201d Izuku said, pulling his knees up to his chest and squishing the pillow he\u2019d been hugging, \u201cI walked into the kitchen this morning, and he smiled at me, and I felt like I got hit by a bus.\u201d He sighed, curling in on himself a little further. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do about this.\u201d\nOchako was quiet for a minute and Izuku felt himself slipping into emotional despair. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he feels the same way, do you?\u201d\nIzuku frowned into his pillow. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Ochako repeated flatly, \u201cOf fucking-okay. Deku, darling, my amazing, smart, beautiful friend, why would you think that? Honest question here.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026,\u201d Izuku ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of an answer to that question that wasn\u2019t just because Kacchan, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it just doesn\u2019t make sense that he would.\u201d\nOchako sighed. \u201cI want to come over there and give you a hug\u2026then hit you maybe.\u201d\n\u201cWhy hit me?\u201d Izuku pouted.\n\u201cOut of love,\u201d Ochako assured him, \u201cDeku, listen. I could sit here and soliloquize for hours about how great and deserving of everyone\u2019s love you are, but I know for a fact you have a class to get to and I have a strong feeling I\u2019m not the person you need to hear it from. So, all I\u2019m asking \u2013 wait no, I\u2019m not asking. Do this for yourself.\u201d She paused for a second, and Izuku fiddled with the corner of his pillow. \u201cJust don\u2019t give up too soon, alright?\u201d\nIzuku didn\u2019t answer for a while, mind running a million different directions until his eyes drifted to an All Might plushie tucked into the corner of his bed. Kacchan had given it to him way back on his fourteenth birthday, a rare golden age model he\u2019d tracked down through his parent\u2019s connections to famous people. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nHe heard Ochako\u2019s exhale of apparent relief and could tell she was smiling when she spoke, \u201cGreat. Want me to come over later?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a bother, since I already-\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see you around five,\u201d Ochako interrupted, making Izuku smiled. He should\u2019ve known better.\n\u201cThanks, Ochako,\u201d he conceded, \u201cand, um\u2026could you do me a favor and not tell Mina about this? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust her, I just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo problem, Deku, I understand,\u201d Ochako assured, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna go around spilling your secrets, promise. I gotta go now, though, so I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d\n\u201cBye, \u2018chako.\u201d Izuku hung up with a hint of a smile, then flopped back on his bed with a heavy sigh, staring up at his ceiling. \nDon\u2019t give up too soon, huh?\nAfter a few moments of contemplative silence, Izuku reached over to pick his phone back up and open Twitter. Then, against what might prove to be his better judgement, he searched for decchan, a word he had been seeing in his chat and all over his little part of the internet for a while now. Originally, he had assumed it was just a mashup of his and Kacchan\u2019s nicknames for conciseness\u2019 sake, but now he knew that it was\u2026not that. Either way, he had never actively searched out the term until now, and although Ochako might have told him not to, he wasn\u2019t feeling incredibly rational at the moment.\n\u00a0\nkacchan\u2019s shoulders @shadowphoenix\nI want what decchan have oh my GOD\u2026 need me someone to love and be gay for \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 \n\u00a0\nyeah @apparently29\ndecchan pining is real and almost painful to watch (in the best way) like aaaaaaah just kiss already!!! I cannot imagine being the rest of the squad watching that all the time lmao. rip todoroki fr\n\u00a0\nall might is gay @mightyshield\nsince ocha\u2019s last stream became the absolute decchan GOLD MINE that it was (also shoutout 2 undercut ocha woWEE) I have updated my tumblr masterpost of decchan being gay. enjoy &lt;3 \n[LINK]\n\u00a0\nIzuku frowned, curious, and clicked on the link. It opened a new page on Tumblr, which he really only used nowadays to participate anonymously in All Might fandoms. This\u2026was not something he had come across before.\n\u00a0\n\nmightyshield-canon\n\n\nMASTERPOST OF DECCHAN BEING GAY (RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR SALAD)\n\nHello and welcome to my compilation of Deku and Kacchan moments that made me scream into my pillow loud enough for my mom to ask if I am okay from the kitchen downstairs. Because I love them. I\u2019ll be updating it every so often to keep it up to date with all of Decchan\u2019s\u2026everything. \n(quick disclaimer: this is all in good fun, please use nothing on this list to harass real people)\n---\n1) Obviously we have to start with the legendary introduction of Kacchan himself (while I\u2019m pretty sure he was in Deku\u2019s very first stream, that has since been taken off the internet in almost all forms so I\u2019m starting the count from when Deku blew up). That amazing moment when he walked in on Deku mid-ramble and Deku stopped talking (about All Might?!?!) and LOOKED AT HIM LIKE THIS.\n[Image: a young high school Izuku in a bedroom covered in All Might memorabilia, wearing headphones, and sitting in a desk chair, grinning brightly at someone beside the camera with his mouth partially open like he\u2019s exclaiming something, eyes wide and bright.]\nIf anyone ever looked at me like that, I\u2019d propose to them on the spot. (Especially if they\u2019re as cute as bby Deku look at HIM!!!) Not to mention the way he says \u2728\ud83e\udd70KACCHAN!!\ud83e\udd70\u2728 I mean\u2026\n\u00a0\nIzuku tried not to grimace at the image of his younger self, but he did admit he looked awfully excited to see the person behind the camera. But what in the world were those emojis around the name supposed to mean or imply in this context. He said Kacchan\u2019s name normally. \n\u2026Didn\u2019t he? Yeah, he did. Whatever.\n\u00a0\n2) I\u2019m not doing this in chronological order that\u2019s too hard. Anyways next up we got some gay panic from Kacchan\u2019s end, aka that time Deku beat him in a racing video game (hero themed one, duh) because Deku smirked at him and he accidentally drove his car off a cliff. Same, Kacchan. \nAnd!! The entire reason Kacchan was playing with him is because he came in to give Deku a snack and yelled at him for not eating breakfast. We love a caring man &lt;3\n3) Actually while we\u2019re on the topic Kacchan does that a lot. Like too many times for me to find proof for all of them, he\u2019s just consistently checking in on Deku and I think that\u2019s so??? Cute??? Like oh my god I need me a Kacchan \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\n4) Next up we got a special shoutout to Decchan randomly tackling the shit out of each other!! Love that for them, every so often Deku will just be yoinked off-camera and it\u2019s like those sound effects in cartoons where a bunch of things crash around and then a cat yowls. Just plain chaos while I sit there going GOOD FOR YOU HONEYS and laugh my ass off. Fellas, is it gay to tackle your childhood best friend any chance you get (yeah kinda)\n5) Have I mentioned \u2728\ud83e\udd70KACCHAN!!\ud83e\udd70\u2728 yet? I\u2019m mentioning it again. \n\u00a0\nHe did not say it weird!\n\u00a0\n6) And as a follow-up to \u2728\ud83e\udd70KACCHAN!!\ud83e\udd70\u2728 I think I have got to mention *spoken like an embarrassed signifigant other being flirted with in public but they actually think it\u2019s funny* \u201cDeku\u201d. Slightly rarer occurrence but Kacchan always sounds like he\u2019s being flirted with by his husband of twenty years and it\u2019s the best thing\n\u00a0\nThat was\u2026incredibly specific. \nIzuku decided to ignore that last bit due to the fact that he didn\u2019t flirt with Kacchan and, more importantly, they were not married, but the rest of it was\u2026extremely confusing, if he were being honest. If he did his very best to shove his own opinions out of the way, his own preconceptions about the relationship between him and Kacchan, he just ended up wondering if all the things they did were romantic in some way. Because they had pretty much listed everything that he and Kacchan did, and had been doing for years now.\nThey checked in on each other, had fun together, and yeah, Izuku was always happy to see him.\nIt all just wasn\u2019t fair. There were hundred of screenshots out there of Izuku looking at Kacchan like that and none to even possibly prove it was ever the other way around. \nIzuku huffed, shutting his phone off and laying back on his bed again. This was too much right now, and he had to get to class soon. \nHe forced himself up, changing out of his pajamas and grabbing his stuff and the abandoned bowl of rice on his desk, which he hadn\u2019t even gotten chopsticks for. He was seconds away from just dumping it into his mouth like a starving toddler as he hefted his bag over his shoulder and made his way out of the apartment, but a note stuck to the fridge caught his eyes just before he did. He lowered the bowl of rice and went to grab the piece of paper, assuming that Kacchan had already left by the fact that he had apparently left Izuku a note.\n\nYou forgot chopsticks, dumbass. And you\u2019re not going to get shit done if you don\u2019t eat well, we\u2019ve been over this. Eat a better breakfast or I\u2019ll kick your ass. Don\u2019t stress about shit too much or I\u2019ll also kick your ass. Also there\u2019s leftover fish in the fridge.\n\nIzuku grinned despite himself, grabbing the Tupperware of fried fish and greens from the fridge and dumping his rice in before snapping a picture and sending it to Kacchan.\n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; [image attachment] this better?\n&lt;&lt; also you could\u2019ve just texted me instead of a whole note\u2026\n\u00a0\nKacchan responded almost immediately. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; you don\u2019t ever check your phone when your stressed or running late\n&gt;&gt; and that meal is pitiful but I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ll always be stronger than you\n&lt;&lt; you wish!! (\u256c\u2594\u76bf\u2594)\u256f\n&gt;&gt; you\u2019re weak. now get your ass moving before you\u2019re late\n\u00a0\nIzuku checked the clock. \n\u00a0\n&lt;&lt; oops. I shall eat on the go. thanks kacchan!!\n&gt;&gt; you\u2019re a disaster\n\u00a0\nDon\u2019t give up too soon.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou look relieved,\u201d Mina commented as Katsuki shoved his phone back in his pocket and continued on their walk to their first class of the day. He scowled at her in response. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katsuki said, \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cWho were you texting?\u201d Mina asked.\n\u201cDeku, you fucking nosy-ass,\u201d Katsuki answered with a huff, \u201cWhy the hell do you care?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m your friend, remember?\u201d Mina responded, rolling her eyes, \u201cAnd I want to make sure our resident angel is doing okay.\u201d\n\u201cHe was being weird as fuck this morning,\u201d Katsuki said, opening the door to their classroom, \u201cbut that\u2019s not exactly a novel occurrence.\u201d Usually he didn\u2019t just run away like that, though. And the look he\u2019d given Katsuki before he did was still stuck in his mind \u2013 he\u2019d looked surprised and slightly horrified.\nWas it because of something Katsuki said? Maybe his weird\u2026whatever he\u2019d been doing yesterday? He wasn\u2019t even sure what that would be. It had just kind of happened, some instinctual need or want to continue poking fun at Deku\u2019s apparent (objective) attraction to him. Though, poking fun at Deku certainly wasn\u2019t anything new.\nKatsuki\u2019s real problem at the moment was the fact that his actual rating for Deku might be a little more than an eight of ten. But whatever, objective attraction didn\u2019t mean anything.\n\u201cAnything\u2026interesting happen after you went home last night?\u201d Mina asked in a strange tone as they took their seats, raising one brow. \nKatsuki stifled a laugh and smirked. \u201cYeah, Deku tried to tackle me and we ended up annoying the shit out of the old guy next door. What else is fucking new?\u201d The excited expression melted off Mina\u2019s face, and Katsuki finally realized with a bit of a start that her tone had been suggestive. His ears felt warm again, the fucking traitors, but before he could go off on her the teacher came in. Fucking hell, Mina.\n\u00a0\nHours later, Katsuki somehow found himself at Mina\u2019s apartment, busying himself in her mess of a kitchen he didn\u2019t have the self-control to leave dirty as she and Todoroki chatted loudly at the counter. Mina had dragged him there after classes, claiming that they could work on their projects in a \u201crelaxed environment\u201d and citing that Ochako was going over to his place to hang out with Deku. Which only made Katsuki feel a little weird, because since when did Deku not tell him shit? But whatever, it was probably nothing.\nMina hadn\u2019t told him she was inviting Todoroki over too, but apparently the guy had some time off from whatever the fuck he did all day \u2013 there might have been some movie he just got cast in that Katsuki had forgotten about, possibly a TV show, but whatever it was it had Todoroki coming over in the shittiest baseball cap and sunglasses disguise he\u2019d ever seen. What was this, an Avengers\u2019 movie?\n\u201cBetter than what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Todoroki countered when he brought it up, making Mina snicker and Katsuki scowl as he scrubbed a dish in the sink.\n\u201cHoodie turtle mode,\u201d Mina smirked, curling up a bit in her seat and miming putting a hood up over her head, \u201cThat\u2019s what Mido called it.\u201d\n\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Katsuki grumbled, rinsing the plate off and setting it to the side to dry. Once or twice in the past he\u2019d had to hide in his fucking hoodie to avoid annoying fans \u2013 of any one of his friends, but mainly Todoroki \u2013 from taking a picture with him in it and inevitably coming to the conclusion that he was \u201cKacchan\u201d. One time, Deku had yanked his hoodie strings closed and pushed him into a bush to avoid a confrontation, which obviously earned him proper retribution. But it wasn\u2019t a thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people would\u2019ve deleted pictures if you\u2019d asked,\u201d Todoroki commented, sipping from the berry drink Mina had handed him upon entrance.\n\u201cYeah, like these fuckers respect your privacy,\u201d Katsuki said, frowning.\n\u201cNo, I mean if you asked,\u201d Todoroki amended, \u201cIn your Bakugou voice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is my Bakugou voice?\u201d Katsuki snapped, accidentally holding up the knife he was holding like a weapon.\n\u201cSee, just like that,\u201d Mina grinned, Todoroki hummed a noise of approval. \u201cThough, from what I\u2019ve seen online they might be even more all over you then,\u201d Mina added, waggling her eyebrows.\n\u201cEw,\u201d Katsuki gagged, \u201cI did not need to hear that. Disgusting.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki, you think that\u2019s disgusting, you would probably combust if you actually had any social media,\u201d Mina said, Todoroki nodding along slightly. \u201cThe things I\u2019ve had to read about my own girlfriend are surreal, and that\u2019s not even approaching the gross stuff.\u201d\nKatsuki frowned at that, brows knitting with a bit of genuine concern for the sake of all his \u201cfamous\u201d friends. He wasn\u2019t a na\u00efve idiot, he knew the internet was a place, and they could all take care of themselves perfectly fine, but still.\n\u201cA lot of it is just funny,\u201d Todoroki said, steering the conversation from slightly darker topics, \u201cFor example, I recently found a thing called Endeavor-bashing, which I quite enjoy.\u201d Katsuki snorted and Mina laughed again. \u201cWanted to add some of my own thoughts but my PR manager said Endeavor-bashing was different that Enji-bashing and wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\u201cGood for you, Todoroki,\u201d Mina giggled, patting him on the shoulder.\n\u201cYou should do it anyway, your PR guy can go fuck himself,\u201d Katsuki added. \n\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t fire him,\u201d Todoroki said with the tiniest hint of a smirk, \u201cbut I added some things on my side account he doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d Mina laughed even louder at that.\n\u201cHoly shit, Todoroki, you\u2019re a gem,\u201d she grinned, and Todoroki looked almost proud of himself. Fucking dork. Mina suddenly gasped and snapped her fingers. \u201cOh my god, that\u2019s what you should do, Katsuki!\u201d\nKatsuki glanced up from the cookie pan he was washing. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cA secret account!\u201d Mina exclaimed, clasping her hands together, \u201cNo one would have to know it was you! This is a genius idea.\u201d\n\u201cBubblegum, did you forget that I\u2019m not a part of that cesspool because I don\u2019t want to be?\u201d Katsuki said, making a face, \u201cWhy the hell are you so interested in me getting an account?\u201d \n\u201cBecause,\u201d Mina said, drawing out the word, \u201cit\u2019s the 21st century, Katsuki! You\u2019re trying to break into the fashion industry, there are things you need to know!\u201d Katsuki just gave her a deadpan look. If he needed social media for fashion, he\u2019d just use his parent\u2019s company\u2019s account.\n\u201cBecause it would be funny,\u201d Todoroki corrected, and Katsuki commended his honesty, at the very least.\n\u201cYeah, mostly that,\u201d Mina admitted, then gave him pleading eyes, \u201cPlease? I\u2019m just curious here.\u201d \n\u201cName five reasons why I should even consider doing that,\u201d Katsuki challenged flatly, rinsing off his hands in the sink and drying them on a towel.\n\u201cOne!\u201d Mina announced, holding up her finger then pausing for a suspiciously long time, \u201cCute\u2026pictures of cats.\u201d Katsuki raised an eyebrow, but she barreled on. \u201cThere are lots of adorable cats on the internet, and I know you like those, you can\u2019t deny it.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to, but-\u201d\n\u201cTwo!\u201d Mina interrupted, adding another finger, \u201cAll Might nerd heaven. Need I say more?\u201d\n\u201cYou need not,\u201d Todoroki cut in as Katsuki scowled at her.\n\u201cThank you, Todo,\u201d Mina smiled, then continued, \u201cThree! You can like all of my pictures because I\u2019m your beautiful best friend and you love and support me.\u201d Katsuki rolled his eyes at that one, stealing Todoroki\u2019s drink as retribution for his previous comment. \u201cFour! Cute pictures of Mido.\u201d\nKatsuki damn near choked on his drink, spluttering out a cough as he ducked his head and slammed a fist into his chest to try and breath correctly again. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of them,\u201d Mina said casually like Katsuki hadn\u2019t been nearly dying a second before and like he wasn\u2019t glaring at her with malice right then, \u201cbecause he has a lot of simps. Like, a lot, and they collect pictures of him.\u201d\nKatsuki paused his plans to throttle her where she sat. \u201cHe has whats that do what now?\u201d\nMina blinked at him for a second. \u201cFive, you won\u2019t be so out of the loop that you seem like first year Todoroki.\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck you!\u201d Katsuki snapped, \u201cJust tell me what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cGet on Twitter for once and you\u2019ll find out,\u201d Mina smirked, wiggling her eyebrows.\n\u201cEnlighten yourself, Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki said with an utter lack of emotion or conviction, \u201clike I did.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, like Twitter is enlightening anybody,\u201d Katsuki grumbled, pulling his phone out of his pocket despite all logic saying he should do literally anything else. He opened the app store and went to download the app of hell to a background of Mina\u2019s excited gasp. \u201cI\u2019m deleting this the second you losers realize there is literally nothing of interest to me here.\u201d\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Mina squealed, practically jumping up in her seat and scurrying around the counter so she could peer over Katsuki\u2019s shoulder. He shoved her away lightly with a scowl, but she was too damn excited to be stopped. \u201cOkay, okay, you gotta pick a username first and then you can-\u201d\n\u201cI know how to make a fucking account, I\u2019m not clueless,\u201d Katsuki interrupted, making Mina roll her eyes dramatically. \n\u201cWell hurry it up then!\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki scowled, setting his user and display name as the first things he could think of. \u201cNow what.\u201d\n\u201cThat was fast,\u201d Mina commented, poking her head around his shoulder again and huffing, \u201cReally, Katsuki, that\u2019s and incredibly boring profile. You don\u2019t even have a picture.\u201d\n\u201cI already told you I think this is fucking stupid and you expect effort from me?\u201d Katsuki protested, \u201cNo. This is fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his username?\u201d Todoroki asked like Katsuki wasn\u2019t right there, taking another sip of his previously stolen drink. Gross.\n\u201cDynamite but it\u2019s spelled d-y-n-a-m-i-g-h-t,\u201d Mina answered, again ignoring Katsuki\u2019s presence, \u201cwhich is a cute childhood reference and all that, but the display name is just \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what the fuck you hairbrains wants me to do or I\u2019m deleting this and leaving,\u201d Katsuki threatened, already having regrets.\n\u201cOkay, okay, cool your jets, big man,\u201d Mina said, smiling in faux innocence, \u201cJust look up your name or something, that\u2019s always fun. Make sure you put in \u2018Kacchan\u2019, though, not Bakugou.\u201d\n\u201cIs that\u2026really the best choice?\u201d Todoroki asked with a hint of a frown.\n\u201cI already know about the weirdos,\u201d Katsuki said, glaring at him. Did he not think he could handle weird comments or something?\n\u201cNo, I mean the\u2026other thing I\u2019m not actually supposed to mention,\u201d Todoroki said, then must have immediately realized he was spilling someone\u2019s secrets and returned full, awkward attention to his drink.\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Katsuki snapped.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Mina grinned, \u201cjust look it up.\u201d\nKatsuki frowned, looking between the two of them. \u201cBoth of you are up to something here and that\u2019s pissing me off.\u201d\n\u201cI am up to nothing!\u201d Mina declared with overdramatic offense, \u201cI only want my dear friend to know\u2026certain things that he really should.\u201d\nAlright, Katsuki was done with the weirdness and riddles. He just needed to find out what the fuck these two dunces were going on about and get this over with, so, he found his way to the search function and typed in his stupid nickname. What could possibly be such a big thing.\nKatsuki didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d been expecting. No, correction, he knew what he\u2019d been expecting, but in the face of what he actually got he somehow found himself still taken by surprise despite all the things he\u2019d heard from Mina. And \u201cby surprise\u201d he meant the \u201chit by a bus\u201d kind of surprise. The \u201cstepped off the sidewalk only to realize it was into a highway\u201d kind of surprise.

Why the fuck did his face\u2026why did he look like that. What the fuck. Why. How. Who. What was going on.\nAlso the internet thinks their dating? When the actual hell did that become a thing and why the fuck was he not informed. \n\u201cI think he found the\u2026things,\u201d Todoroki said, barely snapping Katsuki out of his head. He looked up to glare at the both of them, holding up his phone. \n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you guys knew about this shit?\u201d he almost yelled, ears warm and heart racing for indiscernible reasons. \u201cThe fucking\u2026\u201d he trailed off, unable to even begin describing whatever the hell this was.\n\u201cShipping?\u201d Mina provided, shrinking back the tiniest bit.\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Katsuki snapped, \u201cShipping? Like a fucking package?\u201d\n\u201cOh, uh\u2026nope, not that kind,\u201d Mina responded, doing a very poor job of holding back laughter, \u201cIt\u2019s when people see two other people or characters and decide that they should date. They ship them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026is the stupidest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d Katsuki decided after a moment, \u201cWhy would you call it \u2013 never mind!\u201d He shook his head and huffed. \u201cWhy the hell are people doing that to me and Deku?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they want you to date,\u201d Todoroki monotoned, \u201cI thought we explained that part already.\u201d\n\u201cDie,\u201d Katsuki growled, \u201cAlso, explain.\u201d\n\u201cExplain what?\u201d Mina asked, raising a brow in confusion.\n\u201cWhy does he look like that!\u201d Katsuki yelled, then quickly moved to correct himself, \u201cI mean, why the fuck would they want that?\u201d\n\u201cAre you okay, Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki said, narrowing his eyes with a hint of a frown, \u201cYour ears look sunburnt all of a sudden.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you blushing?\u201d Mina gasped like a rabid animal catching scent of nearby prey. Her eyes were wide, and he could practically see the cartoon sparkles of interest. \u201cGive me your phone! What did you see?\u201d\n\u201cNo! Fuck off!\u201d Katsuki shouted, holding his phone above his head as Mina lunged for it, shoving a hand into her fluffy pink hair to hold her back as his face heated even more. He hated this entire experience with a burning passion.\n\u201cI bet it was Midoriya,\u201d Todoroki suggested, looking completely relaxed in the face of this chaos.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Mina responded, as if she weren\u2019t trying to attack and rob Katsuki that very second.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katsuki screamed, accidentally dropping his phone as he did. He and Mina lunged for it at the same time, both missed, and it clattered the counter and slid right into Todoroki\u2019s waiting grasp. That fucker. \u201cGive that back!\u201d Katsuki snapped.\n\u201cNo, give it here!\u201d Mina yelled, leaning so far over the counter she might have climbed on top of it and making grabby hands at the phone. Todoroki, for his part, just flipped the phone over so it was screen-up, then slid it back to Katsuki.\n\u201cIt was Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d Mina practically shrieked, pumping her fist in victory.\n\u201cKnew what?\u201d Katsuki yelled, snatching his phone back. She was too damn loud.\n\u201cThat you,\u201d Mina said, punctuating her words with a finger to Katsuki\u2019s chest and grinning up at him, the fucking she-devil, \u201chave a thing for your shitty Deku.\u201d\n\u201cI DO NOT,\u201d Katsuki screeched, his entire face far too hot and heart racing far too fast. \u201cWhat in the fucking hell would fucking give you that damn-\u201d\n\u201cYou swear a lot when you\u2019re flustered,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned, and Katsuki snapped his mouth shut and whirled around to glare at that monotone Canadian flag son of a bitch. \u201cWhich is around Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cEven he sees it,\u201d Mina pointed out.\n\u201cEven I see it,\u201d Todoroki agreed.\n\u201cYou two can go die in a ditch, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Katsuki snapped, shoving his phone in his pocket and swiping his keys off the counter where he\u2019d dropped them earlier. He started for the door, but Mina jumped to scramble after him and latch onto his arm. \n\u201cWait, no, Katsuki!\u201d she whined, \u201cC\u2019mon, dude! We\u2019re trying to help here! Just admit that you-\u201d\n\u201cSO WHAT IF I DO?\u201d Katsuki suddenly yelled, whirling around to face her and shaking her grip off his arm. And then he froze. What the fuck did he just say. Mina slowly broke into a grin. Oh fuck no.\n\u201cSo you admit-\u201d\n\u201cGood bye,\u201d Katsuki snapped, yanking the door open and slamming it shut behind him. He was definitely having a heart attack. Or dying. Or dreaming. What the hell was going on.\nWhat was going on is that he just admitted he had a crush on Deku.\nMaybe he was going insane.\nWith an aggressive huff mostly directed at his own stupid brain and traitorous body, he shoved his hands into his pockets and stalked down the stairs out of Mina\u2019s apartment building. He felt his phone, and immediately his mind flashed with those pictures of Deku, looking at him, like that. Why were his palms so damn sweaty? \nHe had to be going insane or something, because there was no way he\u2019d ever have a thing for Deku. Dorky nerd Deku with his stupidly big smile and those dumb eyes that look like crystals made of sea glass, or his obnoxiously loud laugh at the most idiotic of jokes, or his accurate-to-the-point-of-being-creepy impressions of All Might he always did at the worst of times. Or his incredibly messy hair that stuck up in every direction imaginable and looked like an absolute beast when he went to bed with it wet. Or the way he always had to sleep on the left side of any bed, and the way he bit the inside of his lip when he got nervous, and the way he had that one All Might hoodie he wore when he was feeling down, and the way he would always kneel down to talk to little kids so he could look them in the eye.\nOr his freckles that were splattered everywhere on his face like someone had shaken a wet paintbrush at him \u2013 there was one bigger one by the outer corner of his right eye that for some reason always stuck in Katsuki\u2019s mind. Or those scars on his hand from that time Katsuki challenged him to a race on their bikes as kids and he skidded into the ravine and fell into some blackberry bushes. Katsuki had managed to carry him almost all the way back home on his back, and now his ring finger was slightly crooked from where it had broken.\nThere were four scars total from that accident, actually. Three on his hand, one on his shoulder next to the collection of freckles that slightly resembled the Pleiades. Katsuki distinctly remembered a time in third year elementary school, when he and Deku were sitting outside to eat a dinner his mom had made them, and Deku took off his shirt because he\u2019d gotten too hot. His arms were covered in freckles and scrapes from their summer day of running around in the woods, and Katsuki had the clear thought that he looked like the night sky, then frowned to himself because that didn\u2019t sound big enough.\nKatsuki slowed his walking to a stop.\nDeku was gorgeous, and Katsuki knew almost every inch of him inside and out.\nWell. \nFuck.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nWhen Izuku opened the door, Ochako was waiting with a bottle of his favorite strawberry soda, four packs of pocky, and a sympathetic, knowing smile as she took in his well-worn All Might hoodie, baggy shorts, and messy hair that was sticking up at odd angles thanks to continuously running his hand through it. \u201cHey there, Deku.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Ochako,\u201d Izuku answered, trying for a smile as he stepped to the side to let Ochako in their apartment and closed the door behind her, \u201cI think Kacchan\u2019s coming home soon.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s with Mina at my place,\u201d Ochako said, making her way to the living room to place all her stuff on the coffee table and plopping herself down on the couch. \u201cWhich give us some time to talk,\u201d she added, patting the seat next to her. Izuku practically collapsed into the couch, taking the soda she offered with a mumbled thanks. \u201cAre you okay, Deku?\u201d\nIzuku took a sip of the strawberry soda, not meeting his friend\u2019s concerned gaze. \u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he answered honestly, \u201cJust feel a little weird, to be honest.\u201d \n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Izuku muttered, pulling his legs up on the couch, \u201cI think I\u2019m confused.\u201d He paused, and Ochako stayed silent to let him collect his mess of thoughts. \u201cI looked up \u2018decchan\u2019 on the internet.\u201d\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d Ochako gasped, pretty much the reaction he had been expecting. \u201cOh, Deku, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t the best idea I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Izuku admitted with an instant of a smile, \u201cBut it made me realize just how much of my\u2026fanbase, I guess, is dedicated to thinking me and Kacchan have a relationship. Or wanting us to have one.\u201d He took another sip of his drink, thinking back to all the things that had been stuck in his mind all day. \u201cAnd that makes me feel kind of stupid, really.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ochako asked, frowning at him, \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid at all.\u201d\n\u201cLiterally millions of people watch me be disgustingly into him every day and I didn\u2019t even figure it out until this morning,\u201d Izuku countered, huffing and chewing on the inside of his lip, \u201cI\u2019m kind of stupid.\u201d\n\u201cDeku\u2026\u201d Ochako started, then sighed and shuffled across the couch to wrap an arm around his, squeezing his shoulder in comfort, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you stupid. It\u2019s hard to know ourselves, especially when you\u2026well, when you\u2019ve kind of been like that at least as long as I\u2019ve known you.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s shoulders slumped, \u201cIt was that obvious, huh?\u201d\nOchako gave him an awkward smile and tilted her head back and forth. \u201cPretty much.\u201d\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d Izuku groaned, dropping his head to his knees in embarrassment, \u201cIt would be a miracle if he didn\u2019t know, then.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ochako said, rubbing his back, \u201cyou would think so, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Izuku asked with a pout, turning his head to look at her.\n\u201cIt means you and Bakugou are of the same mind in this sense,\u201d Ochako said, reaching up to ruffle his hair, \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re both stupid, but oblivious might be a better word for it.\u201d\n\u201cSo, he doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Izuku said, sitting up again. \nOchako shook her head, \u201cNope.\u201d\nIzuku let out a tiny sigh of relief. \u201cNeither Kacchan or I knew I liked him.\u201d\n\u201cOr the other way around,\u201d Ochako mumbled, making Izuku\u2019s eye widen as he choked on his soda.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he managed to cough out as Ochako patted his back. He caught his breath. \u201cThe other\u2026what?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to tell you this morning, Deku,\u201d Ochako smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t give up too soon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Izuku started as Ochako patiently waited for his brain to catch up with the rest of him, \u201cyou think Kacchan likes me back.\u201d\n\u201cBingo,\u201d Ochako smirked, clinking a stick of pocky against his bottle then eating it, \u201cAnd before you go denying it, just think for a second.\u201d\nIzuku tried. He really did. But all he could do was what he\u2019d done his whole life \u2013 think about how amazing Kacchan was. His strength, his steadfast, fiery determination to do anything and everything he set his mind to, the way stood tall in the face of people that tried to tear him down. He was smart, talented, hard-working, everything Izuku ever wanted to be. He was basically a hero, but better because he was real. \nIzuku told him that when they were young. Kacchan would beat off a bully, get up after every fall, show off anything and everything he could do, and Izuku would be right there behind him to grin and brag about him being cooler than All Might. \n\u201cListen, Deku,\u201d Ochako said, brow furrowed in sincerity as she sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much sway I have here, but trust me when I say seeing you two together\u2026the way you look at each other can be physically painful at times.\u201d She shook her head, laughing under her breath. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Deku, it\u2019s like you\u2019re each other\u2019s suns. That\u2019s grossly poetic but\u2026I mean, he hardly even smiles when you\u2019re not there.\u201d\nIzuku had no idea what to say to that.\n\u201cThis is probably a lot, I know,\u201d Ochako said after a few drawn out moments of silence, \u201cbut you obviously don\u2019t have to do anything about this right now, okay? And no matter what, you always got me.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Ochako,\u201d Izuku mumbled, leaning into his friend\u2019s side. She opened her arm to let him in a little closer, running her fingers through his hair as she did.\nThey ended up watching some trashy drama show Ochako found on TV, and spent most of the time yelling at the characters for missing obvious clues to the crime they were trying to solve. It was incredibly frustrating and exactly what Izuku needed, seeing as he\u2019d almost completely forgotten all his negative feelings by the time the door opened and Kacchan returned home.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Ochako yelled at the exact time Kacchan walked into the living room, \u201cIt was obviously Takata, not Hashimoto! Why are you arresting her?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re stupid,\u201d Izuku said, glaring at the TV, \u201cShe was framed for sure.\u201d \n\u201cFor sure!\u201d Ochako agreed, throwing her hands up, \u201cGah! How could they do that to that beautiful woman?\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not just on her side because you think she\u2019s hot?\u201d Izuku asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Ochako denied with a wave of her hand, making him laugh.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you two doing?\u201d Kacchan cut in, making Izuku startle and twist around on the couch to grin at him. \n\u201cKacchan!\u201d he chirped, \u201cWelcome home!\u201d\nInstead of his usual response, or any at all, Kacchan just stared at him, once again looking softly surprised for no discernable reason. Izuku just stared back at him awkwardly, feeling his cheeks heat up more the longer it went on. Kacchan was pretty like this. Really-\nA gunshot from the TV made Izuku yelp in surprise, breaking the weird eye contact thing and whirling around to find Ochako watching him with a smug, knowing look and smile as she crunched down on a stick of pocky. \u201cI think Takata just shot someone.\u201d\n\u201cI, uh\u2026we guessed it,\u201d Izuku managed, making Ochako smile even wider.\n\u201cYeah, apparently I was right,\u201d she said, and Izuku felt his face heat up even more. He mouthed at her to stop, but she just grinned at him and leaned back to look at Kacchan, who looked like he might have been in crisis. Which was\u2026concerning, to say the least. \u201cHow are you doing, Bakugou?\u201d\nKacchan blinked at her for a second, then fixed his face into a scowl. \u201cFucking whatever, Mochi Cheeks. What are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI was just about to leave, actually,\u201d Ochako said sweetly, pushing herself off the couch as Izuku felt his heart drop to his stomach, jumping up to scramble after her.\n\u201cNo, no, you should stay!\u201d he laughed nervously, grabbing her arm and giving her a pleading look that he hoped Kacchan didn\u2019t see. He could not be left alone with Kacchan right now, he might die.\nOchako, obviously knowing this, just smiled at him, patted his hand, then pried it off her arm. \u201cSorry, Deku, but I gotta get home and do some work.\u201d \n\u201cOchako,\u201d Izuku hissed under his breath, glancing back at Kacchan for a second. \n\u201cBye!\u201d\nThe door shutting behind her carried a lot more finality than it probably should have, and Izuku turned around to face Kacchan after clearing his throat forcefully. His eyes darted around the room for a second until he forced them to stay on his roommate, who somehow seemed to be feeling just as awkward. \u201cHi.\u201d Wait, shoot, he already said that.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Kacchan echoed, red eyes scanning him up and down. There was another awkward pause and Izuku silently wondered what the hell was going on. \u201cWho the fuck is Takata.\u201d\nIzuku snickered, forcing a bit of tension out of his shoulders. This was still just Kacchan. \u201cA character from this show \u2018chako and I were watching,\u201d he said, making his way back over to the couch and flopping down, \u201cAnd he\u2019s a traitorous bitch.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Kacchan said, raising an eyebrow in a very casual way that did not make Izuku blush, then leaning over the back of the couch and propping himself up with his elbows, \u201cDo fucking tell.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nno @dynamight\nokay yeah fuck I\u2019ve got a thing for deku\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nget in line then \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 (we\u2019re all behind kacchan tbh\u2026)\ndeku my beloved &lt;3 @twelveturtles\njoin the club friend\nOkay, why the actual fuck did people see that. Katsuki hadn\u2019t posted it expecting to get responses, especially not fucking challenges (apparently?). It was a mere impulse after watching Deku ramble about some stupid TV show for fifteen minutes straight. Side note, he was starting to understand a little better why people just posted their random shit on the internet.\nOut of curiosity, he clicked on the profile of the first person to respond to him \u2013 the person who had a name that was a reference to him by the way \u2013 and found that it was an account almost solely dedicated to\u2026him and Deku. Seriously, every tweet or retweet was about them, and whatever the fuck \u201cdecchan\u201d was. Name combination? That was just weird as fuck.\nAnd they had the nerve to tell him to get in line? What the fuck?\nKatsuki was momentarily glad he had better impulse control than his high school self, else he might\u2019ve just revealed his identity right then and there out of pure spite. Instead, he glared at his phone and flopped back on his pillows, glancing over at Deku, who was working on an assignment at his desk on the other side of their shared room. He was wearing his headphones, obviously listening to something from the way he swayed back and forth ever so slightly in his seat, mouthing the words to some song with a soft smile on his face.\nno @dynamight\nReplying to @freckledeku never. he\u2019s mine.\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @dynamight a challenger approaches, I see. here\u2019s what I got\n[Image: screenshots of Deku on stream, a picture of him and Uraraka, and a picture of Deku laughing in a frog bucket hat.]\nKatsuki frowned at his phone screen, slightly confused. What in the hell kind of challenge was that?\nWhatever it was, this extra had chosen a losing battle because Katsuki was the one who\u2019d taken most of the pictures Deku posted online. He opened his camera roll, then started his search. It was during this he learned that most of his pictures were either of Deku or his fashion projects, which\u2026He\u2019d just say that a lot of things were making way more sense in hindsight after he realized just how far gone he was for this freckled dumbass.\nThe freckled dumbass he\u2019d known since childhood, so suck it, Max.\nHe replied to the extra with a few pictures of Deku looking like a dork, then shut his phone off and tossed it to the side before he got too invested in stupid internet drama on his first day of being on it. Instead, he busied himself staring at his roommate in real life, who had gone from slight movements and mouthing song lyrics in his seat to a dramatic, silent reenactment of the singer at a concert, invisible microphone and all. His eyes were closed, and Katsuki would bet he\u2019d completely forgotten he wasn\u2019t alone in the room.\nKatsuki fought off a smile and the urge to shove his face into a pillow. Who the fuck gave Deku the right.\nSuddenly, Deku took off his headphones, yanking the plug out of his computer and letting the music \u2013 that was at far too high a volume for headphones, by the way \u2013 fill the small bedroom as he stood from his chair, not stopping his lip-sync dramatics.\n\u201cHey honey, you could be my drug, you could be my new prescription!\u201d He mouthed along, reaching over to turn the volume up even more than it already was. \u201cToo much could be an overdose, all this trash talk make me itchin\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cDeku.\u201d\nThe nerd was full on dancing around their room now, switching between an invisible microphone and an air guitar seemingly on a whim. \u201cOh my, my shit. Everybody talks, everybody talks, everybody talks too much\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Katsuki yelled, grabbing a pillow to throw at him as Deku reached the chorus of the song with somehow increasing dramatics.\n\u201cIt started with a WHISPERRRR!\u201d Deku sung out loud this time, clutching one hand to his chest in an exaggerated pose and using the other to bat away the pillow projectile. \u201cAND THAT WAS WHEN I KISSED HERRRR!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not even singing!\u201d Katsuki shouted, unable to stop a laugh.\n\u201cAnd then she made my lips huurrrt, I could hear the chit chaaaat!\u201d Deku yelled, and Katsuki briefly thought of old man Kiyabu next door, \u201cCome on, Kacchan!\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not, you dorky fuck,\u201d Katsuki said, grabbing another pillow for defense against Deku\u2019s advances towards his bed, not stopping his progression through the nerdiest dance number to ever exist.\n\u201cNope, you\u2019re dancing with me before I go insane from boredom,\u201d Deku grinned, grabbing his ankle to pull him off the bed.\n\u201cOi, fuckwad!\u201d Katsuki laughed, prying Deku\u2019s hand off his ankle only for Deku to grab Katsuki\u2019s hand and continue pulling him. \u201cI think you\u2019ve already gone insane,\u201d he snorted, having been fully yanked to his feet as Deku waved his arms around like a\u2026octopus on drugs? Who fucking knows, but he looked like a dumbass, and it was fucking adorable. \n\u201cHey sugar show me all your love,\u201d Deku mouthed, squeezing his eyes shut again as he raised on arm to point forward, which just happened to be where Katsuki was standing. Uh oh. \u201cAll you\u2019re giving me is friction! Hey sugar, what you gotta say?\u201d\nDeku waved his other arm around in the air, swaying back and forth as Katsuki just stood there, feeling completely frozen. \u201cIt started with a whisper! And that was when I kissed her! And then she made my lips hurt!\u201d\nWhy the hell was he standing so damn close?\n\u201cI could here the chit chat, take me to your love shack!\u201d Oh yeah he was way too close now. Holy fuck. Did he realize he was doing this? \u201cMama\u2019s always gotta backtrack, when everybody talks back!\u201d\nDeku finally, finally opened his eyes, locking them with Katsuki\u2019s as he discovered that he had chaotically danced his way right up into Katsuki\u2019s space while Katsuki had failed at doing absolutely anything to keep him away. His vibrant green eyes widened a little with the realization, lips parting open slightly, his hair messy from the day and smooshed down a bit where his headphones had been, making him look like an utter disaster that was literally making Katsuki feel slightly weak in the knees. This was the worst fucking thing that had ever happened to him.\n\u201cIt started with a whisper, and that was when I kissed her.\u201d\nHe seriously needed to move before this entire environment pushed him into doing something absolutely idiotic. Like kissing Deku right fucking now and possibly sending their friendship careening off the tracks. Which was a huge, flashing red NO, but for some reason he was not moving. The song had fucking ended, a new one had started, and neither of them were moving.\n\u201cI-\u201d Katsuki started, the cut himself off to clear his throat because he\u2019d sounded like he was wheezing through a ten-ton weight on his chest, \u201cI think Mr. Kiyabu\u2019s really gonna hate you now.\u201d\nDeku blinked at him, furrowing his brows slightly, then finally came back to himself and laughed loudly. \u201cYeah, probably.\u201d\n\u201cI also hate you now, turn that shit down,\u201d Katsuki said, shoving him back towards his computer as Deku laughed again, finally turning the racket down to an acceptable volume. Katsuki flopped back down on his bed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell prompted you to do that.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither!\u201d Deku chirped brightly, sitting back in his desk chair, \u201cBut I feel much better now. I\u2019m just going to finish this assignment, then I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Katsuki yawned, stretching one arm across his chest, \u201cNight, then.\u201d\nDeku smiled at him, something a little more personal than his usual camera-worthy grin. \u201cNight, Kacchan!\u201d He twisted back around in his seat, humming along quietly to the next song that was playing, and Katsuki covered himself with his blanket before he was caught smiling at him like an idiot. Who the fuck gave Deku the right.\nWhen Katsuki grabbed his phone to turn off his alarm the next morning, he came face to face with more notifications that he had ever gotten. All from his stupid fucking Twitter account. What the hell?\nDeciding he was too tired for whatever that shit was this early in the morning, Katsuki just rolled out of bed and went to get dressed, yanking back the curtain as he did and making Deku grumble from under his pile of blankets. The dumb fuck probably stayed up too late working again. For good measure, and also because he felt like it, Katsuki grabbed the pillow he\u2019d thrown last night off the floor and chucked it onto Deku\u2019s head.\n\u201cKacchaaaan,\u201d Deku groaned, shoving the pillow off his face and sitting up with what was perhaps the cutest glare Katsuki had ever seen. Katsuki wanted to\u2026squish his face, or something. God, he sucked at this.\n\u201cMornin\u2019, dumbass,\u201d Katsuki greeted, pulling his tank top over his head then grabbing his phone from off the dresser and heading out of their room. He went to grab himself some leftover miso soup from the fridge, only for his damn phone to buzz again. Alright, fine, what the hell was going on there. \nThe first thing he noticed was his new four thousand and something followers, then the countless numbers of direct messages. What in the actual fuck? Thoroughly confused, Katsuki clicked on the notifications tab, finding that his singular tweet that had pretty much zero content had somehow blown up. Most of the replies were\u2026he felt his stomach lurch a bit with sudden dread \u2013 most of the replies seemed to be under the impression that he was Kacchan.\nHe fucked up. He really fucked up. How in the hell did this even happen?\nKatsuki navigated his way back to the conversation he\u2019d been having last night with the extra, assuming that had to be where this had all started because he\u2019d literally done nothing else.\nno @dynamight\nReplying to @freckledeku [Image: multiple pictures of Deku doing different things.]\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @dynamight ASLKDLDKF OKAY I\u2019VE NEVER SEEN THAT THIRD ONE YOU WIN. where did you find that??\nOh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, FUCK. He thought he\u2019d only posted pictures Deku had posted, too. Shit, this was bad, this was very, very bad.\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nReplying to @dynamight okay wait seriously where did you get the third one because deku only posts so many pictures of himself not with his friends\u2026\nKatsuki clicked on the extra\u2019s profile and found that his theory was correct. They\u2019d posted the damn photo \u2013 a picture of Deku in heart sunglasses and floral button-down he\u2019d found in a shitty thrift store, holding up peace signs and obviously on the verge of laughter \u2013 and captioned it asking their one thousand something followers if they had ever seen it. Someone asked where they got it, everyone remembered \u201cKacchan\u201d was the one who took most of Deku\u2019s photos thanks to Deku apparently mentioning that before, and then things blew themselves out of proportion thanks to a bunch of fucking pseudo-Todorokis and their conspiracies.\nIn short, Katsuki had fucked up.\n\u201cKacchan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKacchan whirled around the second Izuku said his name, eyes wide and looking almost defensive about something \u2013 which might have been the phone he was literally hiding behind his back. Izuku frowned at him, still rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the fuck wouldn\u2019t I be,\u201d Kacchan snapped, almost robotically if Izuku thought Kacchan had any capability of being truly awkward. \n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Izuku shrugged, furrowing his brows, \u201cyou tell me.\u201d\nKacchan glared at him, the are-you-seriously-sassing-me-right-now kind, then huffed. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d Izuku conceded, making his way into the kitchen and hip-checking Kacchan out of the way to get to the fridge. Kacchan elbowed his shoulder in retribution, making him laugh. \n\u201cYou stayed up too late again,\u201d Kacchan said, not a question. Izuku smiled at him sheepishly.\n\u201cNot that late\u2026I was only up for an hour\u2026or so,\u201d he admitted, feeling himself blush a bit because part of the reason it had taken so long to get his work done was that he kept getting distracted thinking about his\u2026moment\u2026with Kacchan last night. He had thought about kissing him, again. But, like, actually kissing him. Which was a lot. \nKacchan flicked his forehead. \u201cAck!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s for being dumb.\u201d\nIzuku pouted at him, rubbing the spot on his forehead a bit as he grabbed a slice of bread from the fridge. \u201cRude.\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve it,\u201d Kacchan said, taking a bowl of miso soup out of the microwave, then moving to sit at the kitchen counter and look back at his phone. His expression made Izuku slightly concerned, but he figured it was something about school and decided to let him be. He could always ask him about it later, when he wasn\u2019t as stressed. Maybe whatever it was would fix itself by the evening.\n\u00a0\nIzuku actually got to class on time that day, and spent his day doing his best to listen to his professors drone on about behavior of human beings and patterns of speech processing rather than following passing daydreams of romantic beach picnics with Kacchan, or more kissing. He wasn\u2019t doing a very good job, though, seeing as one of his classmates asked him if he was sick because his cheeks were so red. So that was great.\nAbout halfway through his fourth and final class of the day, Izuku got a text from Todoroki asking if he could meet for coffee in an hour or so. Thinking his friend must\u2019ve finally got a short break from his busy schedule as of late, Izuku happily agreed and walked to the coffee shop a few blocks away from campus after his class let out. He found Todoroki hiding in the back corner of the place, away from most windows but not from prying eyes and dramatic glances from other patrons.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Izuku greeted, taking the seat across from him.\n\u201cI ordered your usual thing,\u201d Todoroki responded, pushing a coffee cup across the table, \u201chope that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thank you very much,\u201d Izuku smiled, taking the drink and taking a sip, \u201cI see you got a break, finally. How\u2019s the new movie going?\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Todoroki answered with a bit of a shrug, \u201cI think I made a new friend.\u201d He took a sip of his tea. \u201cHer name is Camie and she\u2019s a little strange, but she\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of her,\u201d Izuku mused, \u201cShe played the main character in Illusion, right?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Todoroki said, then sat up straighter in his chair and fixed Izuku with a very serious look that made his more than slightly nervous. \u201cSorry, Midoriya, bit there was actually something I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026,\u201d Izuku said, wondering what in the world he could be thinking of, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to apologize,\u201d Todoroki continued with the sincerity only he could have. Izuku was only more confused. \u201cA while ago you requested that I not tell Bakugou about\u2026\u201d he trailed off, glancing around the caf\u00e9 and making a few patrons quickly duck their heads and pretend they weren\u2019t staring or trying to eavesdrop. Izuku sighed in annoyance. \u201c\u2026well, the dating thing.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes went wide as his heart sped up a bit. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yesterday evening I was over at Mina\u2019s home, and we\u2026convinced Bakugou to go on Twitter,\u201d Todoroki said, cringing the slightest bit, \u201cand then Mina told him to look up his nickname, and he\u2026saw things.\u201d He what. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for breaking your trust,\u201d Todoroki continued, bowing his head slightly, \u201cI should\u2019ve stopped them.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku said, then shook his head to come back to himself, \u201cOh, no, Todoroki, that\u2019s fine! Don\u2019t worry about it, Kacchan can do what he wants so that wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\u201cYou still look worried.\u201d\nIzuku sighed, tapping the top of his coffee cup. \u201cHe was acting a little weird yesterday and this morning\u2026\u201d His heart dropped as quite the depressing thought came into his head. \u201cOh, shoot, he was probably grossed out by the idea.\u201d Of course Kacchan would be weirded out by people thinking he\u2019d date Izuku. It was weird.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Todoroki commented coolly with a sip of his tea, making Izuku look up, confused, \u201cHe seemed more surprised than anything.\u201d He took another sip, then mumbled, \u201cOr flustered.\u201d\nIzuku blinked at him, feeling like he\u2019s just been slapped across the face with a raw fish. \u201cWhat?\u201d he squeaked. Was Todoroki on Ochako\u2019s side?\n\u201cI do not wish to breach the privacy of another friend,\u201d Todoroki said, effectively side-stepping the question, \u201cI would only warn you to not put words into Bakugou\u2019s mouth. He doesn\u2019t seem the type to take kindly to that.\u201d\nOnce again, Izuku found himself with no clue as to how to respond. Todoroki didn\u2019t seem bothered by his silence at all, continuing to drink his tea and waving at a little boy in the line at the counter who had been staring at them. \nThe problem was that Todoroki was right. Kacchan hated it when people said things for him or assumed things about him. Izuku knew that, but\u2026but that didn\u2019t mean anything. Well, maybe it did? But what was he supposed to do, ask Kacchan if he liked him back or not? He\u2019d rather fight All for One with his bare fists than do something that risky.\nBesides, he had a slightly bigger, more immediate issue to deal with.\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019s mad at me?\u201d Izuku asked after a bit of silence. \u201cFor, you know, not telling him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can tell when Bakugou is mad,\u201d Todoroki deadpanned, and Izuku laughed sheepishly. \n\u201cRight,\u201d he smiled a bit, \u201cI should probably still say something to him about it, though.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Todoroki agreed, then looked at Izuku for a second, almost analyzing him. \u201cBut\u2026I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. You\u2019re very close, something like this isn\u2019t strong enough to do anything.\u201d\nIzuku smiled for real at that. A recognition of his and Kacchan\u2019s bond always did that to him. \u201cThank you, Todoroki.\u201d He grabbed his coffee cup again. \u201cAnyways, tell me about your new friend Camie!\u201d\n\u201cYou say that like I\u2019m your preschooler son.\u201d\n\u201cThey grow up so fast.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodoroki had to leave after an hour or so to get back to set, paying the bill before Izuku could argue and giving him a cryptic look before getting in his car and driving off. After walking home, Izuku still had some time before he planned to start a stream, and he decided to check his phone for any important notifications he\u2019d muted before setting himself to work on school. \nHe opened his Twitter to more direct message notifications than he\u2019d ever gotten, possibly more than the time his wi-fi had cut out mid-scream while he was playing a horror game Kacchan had triple-dog-dared him to try. There were thousands this time. Literally thousands.\nStarting to feel a little panicked and desperately hoping nothing terrible had happened, he clicked on a random one and read through. The only contents of the message were an all-caps \u201cIS THIS KACCHAN\u201d along with a screenshot of an account by the username @dynamight, no profile picture, zero following, and over five thousand followers. The display name was just plain \u201cno\u201d. \nIzuku frowned, clicking through a few more messages to find more or less the exact same situation from nearly every single person. Finally, he found one with a bit more explanation to it. \n\u00a0\nluka (\u0e51\u2022\u0300\u3142\u2022\u0301)\u0648\u2727: people think that they account @dynamight is actually Kacchan because of one of the pictures he posted, is that true?? this was the picture\nluka (\u0e51\u2022\u0300\u3142\u2022\u0301)\u0648\u2727: [Image: a picture of Izuku wearing heart shaped sunglasses and floral shirt, grinning at the camera with his hands held up in peace signs.]\nluka (\u0e51\u2022\u0300\u3142\u2022\u0301)\u0648\u2727: sorry about the spam I\u2019m sure you\u2019re getting lol \ud83d\ude05\n\u00a0\nIzuku opened the picture and frowned deeper, furrowing his brows. Why would that make people think this user was Kacchan? There were hundreds of random pictures of him online. But, he did admit he wouldn\u2019t have thought of posting this one himself, seeing as he looked like he was about to burst out laughing and it was slightly embarrassing. It must\u2019ve been from one of his friends, then. It surely didn\u2019t make this random person secretly Kacchan.\nOut of curiosity, Izuku decided to take a look at @dynamight\u2019s profile to search for any other clues to why people would connect the account to his roommate. But there was literally only one tweet on the account, albeit a popular one, that simply read \u201cokay yeah fuck I\u2019ve got a thing for deku\u201d. Izuku felt his face flush, but this was just another random person on the internet.\nUnder the replies tab, @dynamight had briefly argued with another random user over\u2026well, over Izuku himself, which was certainly not helping his flustered situation, and posted a few pictures of him. All in all, it wasn\u2019t anything Izuku hadn\u2019t seen before. So, what was the big deal? Kacchan hated social media with a passion, he didn\u2019t have any accounts on it anyway.\nAgain, feeling curious, Izuku went back to @dynamight\u2019s main profile and discovered that the account was only made sometime in this past month. The singular tweet was from last night. This person hadn\u2019t been on this account for long.\nAnd Todoroki did say Kacchan had looked through Twitter yesterday \u2013 no! No, that was crazy. Kacchan had probably just used Mina or Todoroki\u2019s account, not made a new one of his own. @dynamight was not Kacchan. \nProbably.\nNo, definitely. Don\u2019t be stupid, Izuku.\nBut, because he was a masochistic idiot, Izuku spent the next far-too-many minutes scrolling through his direct messages and mentions for further reasoning to the \u201c@dynamight is Kacchan\u201d theory. He learned that, apparently, the photo had never been posted before, which was a reasoning that only served to make him wonder exactly how closely these people followed him. How in the world could they know for sure he or one of his friends had never posted that image?\nThings only got worse when he found that Kacchan was trending on Twitter thanks to Ochako\u2019s text message. \n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; have you seen this yet?\n&lt;&lt; kinda\n&lt;&lt; I am very confused ochako\n&lt;&lt; they think they found kacchan on twitter\n&lt;&lt; but he doesn\u2019t have twitter?? so why??\n&gt;&gt; oh\u2026\n&lt;&lt; what\u2019s that supposed to mean?!?\n&gt;&gt; nothing!! just maybe talk to bakugou? communication is key, remember?\n\u00a0\nIzuku sighed. She was right, but how the hell was he supposed to bring this up when he\u2019d been hiding this kind of stuff from Kacchan for the past five years?\nThe door opened before he got a chance to think it through.\n\u00a0\n&gt;&gt; oh shit he\u2019s home help\n&lt;&lt; talk. to. him.\n&gt;&gt; nononononono I cant do that\n&lt;&lt; do it. I\u2019m turning my phone off now\n&lt;&lt; OCHAKO\n&lt;&lt; OCHAKO COME BACK\n&lt;&lt; you\u2019re the worst\n\u00a0\n\u201cDeku, what the fuck is wrong with you,\u201d Kacchan said, interrupting his mild panic. Izuku shot up straighter in his seat at the kitchen counter and slammed his phone down a little too harshly. Kacchan gave him a look of slight concern.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Izuku nearly yelped, then lowered his voice to a sane level, \u201cNothing at all, everything is A-okay! All good here.\u201d Kacchan kept staring at him. \u201cNo\u2026no problems. Everything is-\u201d\n\u201cCut it out.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNow take a fucking breath, Deku,\u201d Kacchan ordered, hanging his schoolbag on the wall hook and making his way over to the counter, leaning on it on the opposite side from Izuku. Izuku complied, taking in a few slow breaths to calm his racing heart and keep his head in order. \u201cWhat\u2019s the damn problem.\u201d\nIzuku took one more deep breath, mostly to stall, trying to figure out what exactly he wanted to bring up first. \u201cSo\u2026uh, I talked to Todoroki today, and he told me that you found out about the whole\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat awkwardly, unable to meet Kacchan\u2019s eyes. C\u2019mon, Izuku. \u201cUh, the shipping stuff. Of you and me?\u201d He finally mustered the courage to glance up and was surprised to find Kacchan looking relieved, of all things. \u201cI guess I just wanted to say sorry?\u201d he continued, \u201cBecause, you know, I never told you about that even though it involved you.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d was all Kacchan said in response, which only made Izuku more nervous.\n\u201cI only didn\u2019t say anything because I\u2026well, I had no idea how to bring it up, really,\u201d he started to ramble, \u201cbecause, you know, it\u2019s kind of\u2026uh\u2026kind of\u2026awkward? That people think we\u2019re-that you would- that we\u2019re\u2026yeah, I just didn\u2019t know how to bring that up and, oh gosh I\u2019m embarrassed about it now I should\u2019ve just told you the first time you would\u2019ve probably laughed at me and then we-\u201d\n\u201cDeku.\u201d \n\u201c-it would have been nothing, probably!\u201d Izuku blurted right over him, \u201cWhy would it be anything, it\u2019s not like we actually are\u2026you know! Nor do we want to be, so\u2026it\u2019s nothing! Nothing at all, not a big deal, we\u2019re cool. Totally-\u201d He cut himself off when he caught sigh of Kacchan\u2019s expression again. He didn\u2019t look weirded out or even mildly annoyed like Izuku would\u2019ve expected. In fact, given Izuku\u2019s long life of figuring out Kacchan\u2019s feelings from his expressions and body language, he looked disappointed. Hurt, even. About what? \u201cAre you okay? I\u2019m really sorry about-\u201d\n\u201cDeku, shut up,\u201d Kacchan interrupted, making Izuku snap his mouth closed as he fiddled nervously with his hands, \u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d\nWhy did he sound so sad?\n\u201cWas there anything else you wanted to say, or can I get to my fucking work?\u201d\nNow he sounded mad. But\u2026Izuku would rather get this all over with right now than draw it out for later. \n\u201cUh\u2026there was one more thing, actually,\u201d he started, tapping his fingers nervously over his phone case and jiggling his leg under the counter, \u201cBecause I figure you should know about this stuff now\u2026you\u2019re kinda trending on Twitter today.\u201d Izuku got absolutely zero reaction from that, which served to make his heart race faster because something was definitely wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, just some people found an account and they think it\u2019s you.\u201d He laughed, awkward and strained. \u201cWhich is crazy because you don\u2019t\u2026you don\u2019t have social media so. Yeah, just people being weird.\u201d \nKacchan stayed quiet, staring at Izuku with those red eyes like firelight reflecting of billowing smoke, an almost vulnerable look. A resigned look. But that wasn\u2019t right. Kacchan didn\u2019t just\u2026give up on stuff. And what was he even giving up on?\n\u201cKacchan\u2026something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Izuku finally said, \u201cI can tell something is wrong. What is wrong? Did I do something?\u201d\nKacchan tapped his fingers against the counter, just once, then averted his eyes and started to stand. \u201cI\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\nIzuku blinked at him in surprise, also standing. \u201cGet over what?\u201d Kacchan didn\u2019t answer. \u201cKacchan, please talk to me. What did I do?\u201d He raked a hand through his hair, feeling tears prick at his eyes as the words spilled out, desperate for any solution to a problem he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI promise I never meant to lie to you, and I\u2019ll never do it again \u2013 or is the account? I can make a statement saying it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s just a joke \u2013 or I can tell everyone we\u2019re not dating, if that\u2019s what\u2019s bothering you!\u201d \n\u201cDeku, stop.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku yelled, fully crying now, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna stop because you\u2019re mad at me and I don\u2019t know why and I\u2019m trying to fix this but I don\u2019t know what I did wrong! I never meant for this stuff to happen, I\u2019m doing my best here, but I can\u2019t\u2026you can\u2019t just do this to me again!\u201d He sniffled loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t push me away and not tell me why, Kacchan, I deserve to know why!\u201d\n\u201cFucking hell, Deku!\u201d Kacchan yelled, slamming something down on the table, \u201cShut your damn mouth already! This is my fuck-up, not yours.\u201d Izuku froze, meeting Kacchan\u2019s crimson eyes as his friend sighed. \u201cJust look at the fucking phone and then yell at me all you want, I don\u2019t care. But\u2026I\u2019m not fucking leaving unless you want me to, alright? I\u2019ve stuck around your dumb ass too long for that shit.\u201d\nIzuku, now thoroughly confused but incredibly touched, wiped his tears with the sleeve of his t-shirt and looked down at what Kacchan had put in front of him, which happened to be his phone. Open to a Twitter account. Kacchan\u2019s Twitter account. \nWith the username @dynamight.\nMeaning a) Kacchan was @dynamight, b) Kacchan was into him, and c) Izuku had essentially just rejected him without the middleman step of a confession. Also known as screwing up, badly.\n\u201cDeku,\u201d Kacchan said, making Izuku realize he had been sitting there, staring at the phone in shock, for who knows how long.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Izuku started, glancing up at him and trying to form any coherent thought through all the screaming in his head, \u201cit was actually you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it fucking look like, idiot?\u201d Kacchan glowered. \n\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re dynamight,\u201d Izuku said. Kacchan gave him a look, and he cleared his throat nervously. \u201cYou\u2019re dynamight. Right. Got it.\u201d He furrowed his brows. \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe people actually guessed that. It\u2019s a little creepy, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cDeku!\u201d\nIzuku stood up a little straighter and remembered he should be saying something very different right about now. \u201cYup. Sorry. Um. This is just\u2026did you\u2026\u201d he pointed at the phone screen awkwardly, \u201cdid you happen to actually mean that?\u201d\nKacchan drew in a breath, glaring at him. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku squeaked, suddenly feeling faint, \u201cI think I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m gonna sit down for a second,\u201d he announced quietly, dropping into his seat at the counter and staring into space. This was not real. This could not be real. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kacchan knows any other Dekus, though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nWoops, he said that out loud.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he managed, \u201csorry, I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m not asleep, am I?\u201d He pinched himself to make sure and found that it very much did hurt. \u201cOw! Nope, not asleep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d Kacchan frowned, \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna\u2026I don\u2019t know, leave?\u201d\nIzuku blinked at him dumbly, feeling as if his brain was in a haze. \u201cWhy would I leave?\u201d\nKacchan looked at him like he was a total dunce, which was nothing new. \u201cBecause I told the entire fucking internet that I have a fucking thing for you.\u201d\nHearing him say it out loud was like getting his head dunked in ice cold water, a complete shock to the system that confirmed for the thousandth time that this was actually happening. \u201cYou have a crush on me,\u201d he breathed.\nKacchan growled in frustration, propping his elbows up on the table and running his hands through his hair aggressively. \u201cFor the last fucking time, yes. God damn it, could you be drawing this rejection out any fucking longer you asshole.\u201d\n\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Finally, reality came back to him like a bullet train going over the speed limit and Izuku jumped out of his seat so fast he nearly fell over. \u201cNo!\u201d he yelped, waving his hands around like a crazy person, \u201cNo! This isn\u2019t-I\u2019m not!\u201d Kacchan glared at him harder while Izuku struggled to form actual words, using his hands to chaotically motion back and forth between the two of them. \u201cI-you\u2026I also. I mean, shit, uh. I, uh, you \u2013 me too.\u201d\nHe was disaster who belonged in a dumpster. What in the world was that.\nIn good news, Kacchan no longer looked seconds away from strangling him. Now he just looked\u2026confused out of his mind.\nWell done, Izuku.\nSucking in one last deep breath, Izuku clasped his hands together in front of him and exhaled strongly. \u201cWhat I am trying to say, Kacchan, is that I\u2026feel\u2026the same as you do. I also have the\u2026\u201d Was it, like, a hundred degrees in this apartment? \u201c\u2026the romantic\u2026notions. Those.\u201d\nKacchan stared at him in stunned silence, and Izuku buried his red-hot face in his hands. \u201cIf there is any god listening, now would be a great time to smite me,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI am the worst. That was the worst. Let me shrivel up and die. Oh my god.\u201d After way too many seconds of nothing, Izuku peeked out from between his fingers to find Kacchan still staring at him like he\u2019d grown a second head, his ears painted bright red under his ash blonde hair. \u201cKacchan?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to do right now,\u201d Kacchan admitted, which was rare enough of a statement that it made Izuku almost laugh. Which of course, Kacchan noticed, earning Izuku a glare. \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku snorted, covering his mouth as more laughter bubbled up, mostly thanks to nerves. \u201cI think I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d He snorted again, sinking to his knees as he covered his face with his hands. \u201cOh my god what is happening.\u201d\n\u201cI have no fucking idea, now why are you on the ground?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Izuku said, his voice pitched way to high as he let out another laugh. \u201cHelp.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, something is seriously wrong with you,\u201d Kacchan grumbled, suddenly grabbing his arm and dragging him to his feet. Izuku just let him, finding his balance again and then freezing when he glanced up to meet Kacchan\u2019s eyes and realized he was still being held onto. Kacchan\u2019s cheeks were pink now, too, and Izuku couldn\u2019t help but think it was adorable.\n\u201cI have no idea what to do either,\u201d he said, grinning at Kacchan and feeling like that time as a kid he\u2019d taken a shot of Auntie\u2019s whiskey and almost broke a vase.\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cLike that,\u201d Kacchan repeated, narrowing his eyes at Izuku. That just made Izuku start laughing again, then Kacchan shook him back and forth which made him laugh harder, and without another thought and lunged towards Kacchan and squeezed him into a hug. \n\u201c\u2019Cause I like you,\u201d Izuku said, muffled into Kacchan\u2019s shirt. Then, he pulled back a bit to look at him. Stark red eyes, sharp nose, spiky ash blonde bangs, and a look of someone without a smidgen of an idea about what to do with themselves. He made Kacchan look like that. He made Kacchan feel like that. Once again barely thinking, Izuku slid his arms out from around Kacchan and placed them on his cheeks instead. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d he breathed, then immediately froze up. \u201cI mean\u2026shoot, that\u2019s a little fast, sorry, I thought I was gonna say something else-\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s heart just straight-up stopped beating. \u201cWhat?\u201d he managed, little more than a whisper.\nKacchan smirked at him. \u201cI said okay.\u201d \nAnd then he was being kissed.\nBy Kacchan.\nKacchan was kissing him.\nHOLY SHIT KACCHAN WAS KISSING HIM. \nIzuku\u2019s brain rebooted just in time to stop Kacchan from pulling back, quickly sliding his hands from his cheeks to around his neck. Kacchan\u2019s hands settled on his waist. His lips were so soft. Izuku suddenly felt like he was going to fall down at any second. Oh boy. Lots of things happening.\nHe broke away after a few seconds but didn\u2019t even think about letting go, both because he might\u2019ve collapsed the second he did and because he really did not want to. He never wanted to let go of Kacchan again. This was the best thing that had ever happened to him. Including that time the real life actor for All Might shook his hand. Well, maybe it was tied with that.\n\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m tied with All Might?\u201d Kacchan said, making Izuku realize he\u2019d been muttering his train of thought this entire time. He smiled at him, raising a brow with a shrug. \n\u201cIt was All Might, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kacchan started, leaning in and grabbing Izuku\u2019s chin lightly, \u201cyou always used to say I was better than him.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Izuku hummed, full-on staring at Kacchan\u2019s lips instead of his eyes. \u201cYou could always try to convince me.\u201d\n\u201cEasy.\u201d\nKatsuki loved threading his hands through Deku\u2019s hair. It was so damn soft. And he made this weird-ass purring noise when he did, which made Katsuki feel all kinds of things he didn\u2019t want to think too hard about. \nThe two of them probably spent the better part of an hour on their couch, doing nothing but letting out all the stupid pent-up feelings from the past\u2026ten years, probably. Deku tasted like caramel-sweetened coffee and coconut chapstick, and Katsuki couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Couldn\u2019t get enough of every part of him. God damn it, if only he\u2019d realized how badly he wanted to do this and fessed up a whole lot earlier. He could\u2019ve made out with this nerd a hundred times over.\nBut fuck that, he had all of right now and the foreseeable future to make up for lost time. He planned on more than making up for it.\nEventually, Deku broke away fully to take in a huge breath, staring down at Katsuki with his face bright red as Katsuki smirked up at him, keeping his hands at their place on Deku\u2019s waist. He liked holding onto him. He liked a lot of things about being with Deku like this, he\u2019d found.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Katsuki murmured, his voice a little rougher than usual, \u201cstill thinking about All Might?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Deku responded, sounding like he was about to pass out. Katsuki smirked. Damn right. \u201cBut I think if we keep doing this I\u2019ll die. There is only so much I can take in a day, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Katsuki hummed to himself, looking up at Deku like the damn idiot he apparently was, \u201cthat\u2019s a fucking shame.\u201d\nDeku\u2019s eyes went wider, and he shoved his face into the couch arm next to Katsuki\u2019s head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, Kacchan. Stop that.\u201d\n\u201cStop what?\u201d Katsuki mumbled, tilting his head to kiss Deku\u2019s neck and making him shoot upright with a tiny yelp.\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d\nKatsuki snorted at his beet-red face and electrocuted expression. This was fun, actually. \u201cWhat, you fucking dork.\u201d\n\u201cYou-I-Kacchan, you-,\u201d Deku spluttered, narrowing his eyes with a pout, \u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah I am,\u201d Katsuki agreed, \u201cyou\u2019re cute when you blush.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Deku wheezed, \u201cokay, I can\u2019t do this anymore. Great while it lasted, Kacchan, but if you keep talking like that I will die.\u201d Katsuki snorted again, sitting upright as Deku tried to scramble off of him in a flustered panic, somehow fucking up bad enough to fall off the damn couch. Katsuki would\u2019ve laughed at him if the fucker hadn\u2019t grabbed his arm and yanked him down too.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d Katsuki yelled, untangling their limbs until he was able to bring himself up onto all fours above the nerd, who quickly hid his face in his hands and muttered something completely unintelligible. He was adorable. \u201cYou wanna get away from me so bad you pull me off the fucking couch?\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Deku wailed, obviously embarrassed beyond belief which only served to further Katsuki\u2019s amusement. \n\u201cMake me,\u201d he grinned. \nDeku opened his hands to glare at him. \u201cStop flirting with me, I am literally having heart palpitations.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking dramatic,\u201d Katsuki said, meaning it to come out a scoff but instead somehow landing on a purr. Deku literally squeaked at him, shoving a hand over Katsuki\u2019s face to push him backwards. \u201cOi!\u201d \n\u201cStop being pretty at me!\u201d Deku wailed. \n\u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I\u2019m overwhelmed!\u201d\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Katsuki laughed, grabbing Deku\u2019s wrist to pry his hand off his face and sitting back on the balls of his feet, resting his arms on his knees and smirking down at Deku. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a break.\u201d\nDeku blinked at him from where he lay star-fished on their carpet, then pouted. \u201cWait no come back.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Deku!\u201d Katsuki guffawed, pushing himself all the way to his feet. \u201cMake up your damn mind!\u201d\n\u201cNever!\u201d Deku countered, sitting up but staying sat on the floor. Then, he frowned a bit. \u201cWe still have things to talk about, don\u2019t we.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Katsuki agreed, dropping into a spot on the couch. Deku pulled himself off the ground and sat opposite from him, pulling his legs up to his chest.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Deku started, tapping his knees a few times, \u201cuh\u2026I don\u2019t know how to start this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 look at me,\u201d Katsuki frowned, \u201cI\u2019ve never done this shit either.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess first on the list would be what \u2018this\u2019 even is,\u201d Deku concluded, meeting Katsuki\u2019s eyes with a nervous smile. \u201cI mean\u2026you said you were into me.\u201d\nKatsuki wished he had something to throw at him. \u201cYeah, then I fucking made out with you for an hour, I\u2019d sure hope we were past that part.\u201d\n\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d Deku said, staring blanky at a point on the couch for a second, \u201cthat did, in fact, just happen in real actual life.\u201d He looked back up at Katsuki. \u201cWhich would make us\u2026uh. Dating? Even though we\u2019ve never been on a date, so I don\u2019t know if it counts, and don\u2019t these things usually go a little slower? Maybe they do, I\u2019ve only watched movies so I have no good frame of reference for this specifically, but-\u201d\n\u201cOi, nerd.\u201d Katsuki reached out a foot to tap Deku\u2019s forehead before he could start a ramble. Deku snapped his mouth shut and gave Katsuki his attention. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you call us, honestly, but\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking Deku up and down for a moment. \u201cIf it helps your nerd brain stop freaking out, just say boyfriends.\u201d\nHe figured the only real difference between how he and Deku were feeling right then was that he was better at hiding it. Or at least he hoped he was. He freaked out in his head while Deku looked like he\u2019d been told all superheroes were real and they were waiting outside the door to meet him, or possibly like Katsuki had slapped him across the face.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he finally wheezed.\nKatsuki tried not to laugh in his face. \u201cYou good, Deku?\u201d\n\u201cSo good,\u201d Deku rasped, then coughed aggressively, \u201cyup.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Katsuki said, leading into an awkward pause, \u201cNext thing.\u201d\n\u201cI guess if we have all the\u2026us stuff figured out,\u201d Deku said, his cheeks pink, \u201cthen it would just be the, you know, internet situation.\u201d Katsuki scowled. Yeah, that. \u201cI mean, we could just ignore them if you wanted.\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Katsuki said, even surprising himself a little with an answer he hadn\u2019t thought out beforehand. But he might as well go with it. \u201cGimme a second,\u201d he decided, standing from the couch to retrieve his and Deku\u2019s phones from the kitchen counter. He flopped back down, tossing Deku\u2019s phone over to him before opening his own and making some edits to his Twitter profile. First up was deleting everything he\u2019d posted up to that point, which was only the one embarrassing tweet and the few replies. Next was the rest of it. Finally, he followed his three friends and one boyfriend.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki @dynamight\nAKA Kacchan.\n4 Following 6,024 Followers\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said, turning his phone screen around to show Deku, \u201cKacchan\u2019s got a Twitter now.\u201d\nDeku grinned at his phone, then at him. \u201cYou know this means everyone\u2019s going to know you like me, right?\u201d\n\u201cPretty sure they already fucking figured that out,\u201d Katsuki countered, cheeks warm.\n\u201cFair,\u201d Deku said, nodding a bit, \u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with your real name there?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have put it if I fucking wasn\u2019t,\u201d Katsuki pointed out. People would figure out who he was eventually, as he\u2019d discovered, but it didn\u2019t really mean anything in the long run. He\u2019d keep doing whatever he wanted regardless, fuck anyone and anything that tried to get in the way of that.\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Deku smiled, grabbing his own phone, \u201cI\u2019ll tag you in something to let everyone know it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\u201cGo for it,\u201d Katsuki muttered, leaning back into the couch cushions and staring at him for a second. His boyfriend, with his wild dark hair and all those stupid freckles. He had the strong urge to reach out and latch onto him like koala, so instead of stopping himself he just grabbed Deku by the waistband of his shorts and pulled him across the couch, twisting him around as he did until his back was against Katsuki\u2019s chest. Fuck yeah. \n\u201cKacchan, what\u2026\u201d Deku trailed off as Katsuki wrapped his arms around his torso and leaned forward to rest his chin on Deku\u2019s shoulder to look at his phone screen.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you write?\u201d Katsuki asked, playing it off as nonchalant because he knew that would fluster his nerd the most.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Deku managed, sounding a little hoarse, \u201cnothing yet.\u201d\n\u201cWell hurry it up then,\u201d Katsuki smirked to himself, breathing in the faint laundry smell of Deku\u2019s sweatshirt and feeling more comfortable than he had in a while.\nDeku cleared his throat quietly, then slowly relaxed a bit into Katsuki\u2019s hold. Cute. \u201cHow\u2026uh, how do you feel about telling people that we\u2019re together?\u201d\nKatsuki thought about that for a moment. He hated random people in his business, and definitely valued his privacy, but\u2026for fuck\u2019s sake, three million people on the internet were out there thirsting over his boyfriend every damn day. Not like Deku was gonna go running off to any of those random extras but he might as well show them what\u2019s what.\nAnd it may have been less than a few hours since they got together, but Katsuki didn\u2019t see getting over him or getting away from him anytime soon. Not when he\u2019d apparently been wanting this for way too many fucking years.\n\u201cGo fucking wild, I\u2019m yours now,\u201d he mumbled. Deku made the weirdest noise he\u2019d ever heard, like the verbal keysmash of strangled person. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say things like that!\u201d Deku wailed pathetically. \nKatsuki rolled his eyes and squeezed Deku a little tighter. \u201cAlright, fine, I hate you. Ugly loser ass.\u201d\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to,\u201d Deku said, making Katsuki laugh. \u201cOkay, how\u2019s this?\u201d He held up his phone for Katsuki to better see. \n\u00a0\nDEKU! @smallmight\n@dynamight my beloved is now on twitter everyone say hi kacchan\n\u00a0\nKatsuki felt his face heat up in a very unwelcome change of events. \u201cYour what.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Deku said, and Katsuki could clearly hear his shit-eating grin in his voice, \u201cyou said you were mine.\u201d Katsuki did not like this taste of his own medicine whatsoever. \u201cI\u2019m yours too, handsome.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Katsuki hissed, feeling his palms start to sweat. Deku giggled, which made everything a billion times worse. \n\u201cWhat, I can\u2019t flirt back?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cSee?\u201d Deku said, clicking send on the tweet, \u201cNow you know how it feels\u2026my beloved.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\ngreat explosion murder max @freckledeku\nOH MY FUCKING GOD I WAS RIGHT HOLY SHIT ASDLKFJLD\n\u00a0\nHoney | mirko\u2019s fluffy tail @honeycomb\nDECCHAN CANON THIS IS NOT A DRILL THEYRE REAL IM FREAKING OUT RN\n\u00a0\ngecko @lesbian_bubblegirl\nKACCHAN IS HIS BELOVED IM GONNA CRY.

Of course, that peace couldn\u2019t last long, as he found when the door to their apartment swung open so fast it banged against the wall and startled Deku so much he screamed, which in turn scared the shit out of Katsuki who was trying to finish a history of fashion assignment.\n\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d\n\u201cKATSUKI,\u201d Mina yelled right over him, pointing an accusatory finger, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you answered my messages?\u201d\n\u201cHow the fuck did you get in here, the door was locked,\u201d Katsuki countered. \n\u201cOchako knows how to pick a lock, now explain yourselves!\u201d Mina shrieked, planting her hands on her hip. Her girlfriend behind her copied the pose, while Todoroki stood off to the side with a slight smile. \n\u201cUh\u2026hi guys,\u201d Deku started, nervously lifting his notebook to hide most of his face and he sat, curled up on the couch. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018hi guys\u2019 me!\u201d Mina yelled, stomping over.\n\u201cWe did not sit through your shit for five years to learn you finally started dating over Twitter!\u201d Ochako shouted, slamming her hands down on the counter where Katsuki was working. What the fuck was going on.\n\u201cOh, uh, sorry about that,\u201d Deku tried to apologize, eyeing Mina like she was a raptor and he was an unlucky goat thrown in the cage, \u201cWe kinda\u2026it just sorta happened. But\u2026yeah. We\u2019re dating now.\u201d He shrunk back even further, his voice quiet. \u201cHooray.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Todoroki said as the only bitch in this house with any manners, apparently, while the two women each glared at their respective person who lived in the house they just broke into. \n\u201cThank you, Todoroki,\u201d Deku squeaked, not taking his eyes off Mina as he shrunk back so far into the couch he might\u2019ve disappeared into it. \n\u201cDo you have anything to say for yourself, Bakugou?\u201d Ochako demanded, narrowing her eyes at him. \nKatsuki just shrugged. \u201cDeku speaks for the both of us now. Bother him.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d Deku hissed, betrayed.\n\u201cWe are getting the full story right this second,\u201d Mina announced, stalking over to Katsuki and grabbing his arm, \u201cfrom both of you!\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d Katsuki protested as he was yanked off his chair and thrown onto the couch by Mina\u2019s freakishly strong arms. The other three took their seats on the other side, consequently shoving Deku towards Katsuki which he had absolutely no problem with. In fact, he pulled Deku closer, right onto his lap, then hugged around him from behind to use him as a shield against the harassment. \u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, Katsuki,\u201d Mina cooed, squishing her cheeks and making him scowl at her. \n\u201cWhat do you even want us to tell you?\u201d Deku asked. \nOchako grinned with a frightening look in her eyes. \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nSix months later, Katsuki sat on the very same couch next to an energetic Deku as he rambled on about something way off topic from the question he was originally trying to answer. It was supposed to be a six-month anniversary Q&amp;A (that Katsuki had agreed to after a lot of promises), but someone had asked something Katsuki already forgot about and now Deku was going on and on about the technological advancements made my David Shield in the Plus Ultra fictional universe. \n\u201cDeku,\u201d Katsuki finally interrupted, reaching on camera to flick his forehead.\n\u201cAh!\u201d Deku squeaked, cutting off his ramble with wide eyes, \u201cOh darn it! What was the question again?\u201d\n\u201cI think you should just move on,\u201d Katsuki laughed, making Deku flush in embarrassment.\n\u201cOkay, okay, next question,\u201d he conceded, squinting at the chat log on his computer, \u201cSince you\u2019re childhood friends, do you have any embarrassing stories about each other?\u201d Deku grinned and Katsuki groaned. \u201cOoh, I like that one.\u201d\n\u201cYou do, huh?\u201d Katsuki said as Deku smirked at him. \u201cAlright, what if I told everyone about the time with the beetle?\u201d Deku\u2019s eyes went widened and Katsuki grinned in victory. \u201cYou remember, the little beetle you named\u2026Bug Might, was it?\u201d \n\u201cKacchan, no,\u201d Deku started, pointing a finger at him. \n\u201cYou captured this poor bug and put it the jar, which suffocated it until it died because your dumbass forgot about air holes for dear old Bug Might-\u201d\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d\n\u201c-and then you sobbed about it for like two whole hours!\u201d Katsuki continued as Deku stuck out a foot to try and push him further away. Katsuki just grabbed his ankle and shoved his leg back in response. \u201cBut then you got scared that your mom was going to get mad at you for killing the bug-\u201d\n\u201cKACCHAN!\u201d Deku yelped, trying to scramble out of his hold. \n\u201cSo what did you do, Deku?\u201d Katsuki grinned, releasing him, \u201cDo you remember? Because I do.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cYou ate it,\u201d Katsuki concluded, \u201cYou ate Bug Might\u2019s corpse.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Deku wailed, burying his red face in his hands. He was so fucking cute. \u201cI was like five years old! Don\u2019t hold it against me!\u201d\n\u201cBug killer.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk!\u201d Deku yelled, throwing his hands up, \u201cFor example, that one time you stepped on an ant hill to spite me for telling you to watch out for it-\u201d\nNow it was Katsuki\u2019s turn to get embarrassed. \u201cDeku, don\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all the ants started climbing all over you,\u201d Deku continued with a shit-eating smirk, \u201cSo you-\u201d Before Katsuki knew what he was doing he lunged forward and tackled Deku back to the couch, shoving a hand over his mouth as he let out muffled protests and maneuvering himself to sit right on top of him. He was fully center frame now, a surprise face reveal, but all he did was grin sharply at the camera. He didn't care at this point, but his pride was not going to stand for Deku finishing that story.\n\u201cDeku is dead, this is my channel now,\" he announced.\nAnd then Deku pushed him off the couch.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nKatsuki @dynamight\nyeah.\n[Image: a picture of Katsuki and Izuku wearing heart-shaped sunglasses and matching patterned button-downs, taken in store\u2019s dressing room mirror.
