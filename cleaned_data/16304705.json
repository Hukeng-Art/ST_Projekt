He saw himself in Sasuke, Obito in Naruto, and Rin in Sakura. He woke, saw himself in them, and took a large step back, regretting accepting them as his new team. In another world he was quite hands off, merely a watcher because it was so very painful to watch. He saw himself and all his mistakes in this new team of his.</p>\n<p>In this world, Kakashi awoke, saw the similarities, and instantly panicked. He suddenly realized what he had done, passing a team.

    "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Some of this may be OOC but i think a lot of it can be due to the fact that Team 7 barely knows one another and yet have to keep relying on one another to survive Kakashi's insane training. I make it sound pretty straightforward but imagine being dropped off in the woods partially naked with no supplies with three classmates you've barely talked to. I would personally go a little crazy.</p>\n<p>I also think of all problems that could have been solved by a mediating adult. So Sakura, who is emotional and even described as a cry-baby early in the manga, probably would have snapped under certain circumstance. But she's logical as is Sasuke, so I think Kakashi could have fixed so much with just some little communication. They are also both impressionable young kids who look at Kakashi and see a legendary ninja (who hasn't been lazy in this world) and so they respect and listen to him.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I know i keep giving Sakura crying scenes, but as Kakashi said; tears are not a weakness. I wanted to show some of her frustration and bring back the nickname she had of 'crybaby'. She is a young girl who is dealing with being isolated with three boys, only one of which even vaguely understands her. </p>\n<p>And while i think Sasuke being rude would be cannon, his apology might seem ooc. But on this idea, i reiterate that they are in isolation, and he is being given exactly what he as always wanted; training. This Sauske is a bit better than cannon because he is getting training and good attention. Kakashi gives him leeway but also doesn't allow disrespect or stubbornness from the boy, tossing him around until he is too exhausted to be a jerk.</p>\n<p>As for Naruto, i feel like this is all positive attention for him and that he barely notices the fact they are isolated.There is little reason for him to be antagonistic or harping on Sasuke when Kakashi takes an active role in their lives. Kakashi also waited till he was sure they were far from Konoha and he had their trust before he told Naruto the secret of his mom.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to see the appearance of some more traditional ninja items. But so many were so interesting i couldn't just pick one for each kid! I won't focus heavily on the weapons but many of them will make multiple appearances briefly in upcoming chapters.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I think the capital town of a non-ninja village would be impressive but not unlike edo period or even earlier. The kids also do their first kill which i think a good ninja sensei would introduce in a more controlled environment than many situations. Against civilian bandits is a lot more easily handed. That it happened in defence and instict would make it easier for all of them to handle.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I feel Kakashi in cannon did Sasuke a disservice by not sitting him down and telling him he had the sharingan and how he got it. Sasuke is a traumatized child raised on stories of doujutsu theft. Kakashi could have gained his respect and trust by having a serious talk with him about it. </p>\n<p>I also feel Sasuke would have thought Kakashi had a different reason for being his sensei if he hadn't known about the sharingan. </p>\n<p>Kakashi is also training alongside his students so he is getting back to a good physical fitness level. He hadn't exactly let himself go, but years of lazy training and outside of ANBU had dulled him. With a little training Kakashi improves rapidly as shown by how the first fight with Itachi in the manga had him going down quick, but later on he was facing high level opponents with more ease. </p>\n<p>Get ready for Wave btw. I couldn't leave it out.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I made the battle against Zabuza go a bit differently because i think as the kids changed, so has Kakashi. His reactions have changed from mess around with the opponent to kill them quickly if he doesn't want them near his kids. Also in the manga when he fights Zabuza with the sharingan and his own attacks, i think it would be risky. I mean a master of water versus a quick copy? Why not use lightening he later uses often.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A little bit more of the team learning about one another. And some Sasuke angst. And more life lessons.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So i always hated how they never fully investigated Wave when they knew that Gato was going to try and destroy the bridge and kill Tazuna. SO here they did it, though i didn't show the scene. </p>\n<p>I also never liked how they killed of Zabuza and Haku. I know it taught Naruto about loss or something and then gave some good flashbacks, but i felt like the whole thing was bleh. So Kakashi, stronger and more driven than in the manga, makes a different choice.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Timeline so far: 1 month in the forest the first time they got dropped, two weeks forest the second drop, two weeks to tea country and their base, six weeks in tea country, two weeks to wave, three weeks in wave, week and a half back to Konoha. Approx. 5 months and a few weeks. </p>\n<p>I am trying to make travel time look a little more realistic, and doing ninja vs. civilian, than some stories that say places like Suna are 3 days away. Fire Country is one of the larger countries and getting around would take a while, especially in dense forests and winding roads. </p>\n<p>So the team is finally back in Konoha and kakashi is already preparing them for the chunin exam!</p>\n<p>As for needing a certain number of D-ranks, it shows discipline and hours spent working for Konoha. There must be some form of level needed before they can enter an exam. </p>\n<p>The Hokage also demanded he enter them because its all a power play and as nice as they make the Hokage in the manga, he is still a dictator that must keep a firm grasp on his power.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I never understood why Kakashi didn't introduce his pack at some point, especially after using them in wave and such. </p>\n<p>The explanation of summons is half made up, half pieced together from my knowledge of the manga and stuff. </p>\n<p>The armor stuff i made up because i cant imagine heavy taijutsu fighters not using armor or others who specialize in things like long range. I know the reasons such as heavy armor decreases speed and flexibility and stealth, but they have seals to seal literal demons away, why not to make things like cloth hard. It would make more sense than someone wearing fishnet as a shirt in a fight out in the elements.</p>\n<p>Gave them another new outfit too. They're kids, even if most ninja seem to pick one look and stick to it, kids get bored of the same shirt after some time. And they're still growing and finding a style. I know i don't wear the same clothes i did when i was young, or even from a year ago.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>A little more weapons training and a quick breakdown on what i think a military village would work it's pay system like. All the stories where they get paid per mission never made much sense to me. How would people dedicate time to training? And it would create such a competitive system that people would probably try and actively sabotage others to get their cash. Bounties make sense, but you would want some sort of equality in a ninja village.</p>\n<p>And finally some fluff about moving into the Hatake compound.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Music therapy and D-ranks. The scene with Iruka vs. Kakashi is something i thought would be more realistic than the arguing in the manga.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_15_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Some fluffy team arguing and then some serious politics. And then the end. Or perhaps the real beginning.</p>\n<p>Someone made a super cute fanart of Team 7!!!!!! https://oxenfire.tumblr.com/post/188868619800/team-7-outfits-from-this-cute-fic-by</p>",
    "text": "When Kakashi woke the morning after passing the New Team Seven, he woke from a dream of his own genin days, of Rin, Obito, and Kakashi all together. For a brief moment he woke feeling nostalgic. He realized in that moment, that in these three genin he saw his own team. \nTheir teamwork was weak. Very, very weak, and Kakashi really shouldn\u2019t have passed them based on it. But he had. He had because there was something there, a spark, ready to bloom into fierce loyalty. They were also all skilled in their own way. Kakashi had seen many shinobi, had personally failed many genin, and he could spot talent. And these three had it. So he had passed them.\nIn one world, Kakashi awoke, felt grieved, and let that grief make him a lazy teacher. He saw himself in Sasuke, Obito in Naruto, and Rin in Sakura. He woke, saw himself in them, and took a large step back, regretting accepting them as his new team. In another world he was quite hands off, merely a watcher because it was so very painful to watch. He saw himself and all his mistakes in this new team of his.\nIn this world, Kakashi awoke, saw the similarities, and instantly panicked. \nKakashi was not a man prone to panic or hysteria, but in that instant he felt it overwhelm him and he fled to the memorial stone. Kakashi had a full blown panic attack before the stone, begging his dead team for advice. Begging them to protect this new team and not let them end as tragically as his had. He could see himself in Sasuke ignoring his team, seeing them below him. He could see Obito in Naruto acting out for attention and recognition. He could see Rin in Sakura crushing after Sasuke and snapping over Naruto. He could already see cold Sasuke being broken over stubborn Naruto\u2019s death when Naruto would be the one to remember team loyalty and pay for it. He could see broken Sakura, caught because of his failings to teacher her and murdered. He could see Sasuke breaking all over again. \nKakashi panicked, suddenly realizing what he had done, who he had passed. He did not want to watch history repeat itself. \nSo Kakashi had a panic attack and a break down like he had not had since ANBU. Ever lazy Kakashi was suddenly thrown from first gear into full speed and it left him scrabbling and frantic. \nAnd so Kakashi, the genius copy-nin who had been a genin at age 6, did what he did best. Kakashi was born and bred to be a shinobi and shinobi were good at a few things. One was killing your problems, the other was being paranoid and over prepared. Since Kakashi wanted to do the opposite of kill this problem, he kicked himself into gear and started to plan for every way this could go wrong and what he had to do to not watch this new Team Seven die. \nSimply put, Kakashi became a teacher.\n.--.\nKakashi watched the three very carefully for the next three days, watching them as they did D-rank missions. He offered them no training and watched as they didn\u2019t take the initiative while he made them wait two hours for his late arrival. He watched as Sasuke ignored the other two, Naruto challenged him at every turn, and Sakura switched between crushing on Sasuke to yelling at Naruto in an instant. \nTo be honest, Kakashi really wasn\u2019t surprised or disappointed. You had to have expectations to start too even feel them get destroyed. \nInstead Kakashi watched and knew he could train them, could train any bad habits out of them. It was why kids graduated at twelve and were put in 3 man teams. One teacher for three students was better than one teacher to a full class. It was Kakashi\u2019s job to train them. In reality, genin was not considered much of a step above academy student to most ninja. Shinobi didn\u2019t consider genin to be ninja to be honest. They were still students, who were to be trained. They may take \u201cmissions\u201d but those were just glorified chores that were more often a different form of training. D-ranks trained genin how to work together, how to work with civilians, how to follow orders, and even skills they made need for disguises later. D-ranks weren\u2019t really missions.\nSo Kakashi didn\u2019t worry. He knew they would be pretty bad straight out of the academy with its lax training. He would get them up to snuff or so help him.\nSo Kakashi watched for three days, made plans, and prepared. Then, on the fourth day, Kakashi woke up at 3am and put his plan into motion.\n.--.\nKakashi grinned beneath his mask as he grabbed Naruto like a sack of potatoes. The boy didn\u2019t even twitch, just kept snoring. There was something quite fun about kidnapping his new precious students, after having caught them in genjutsu. Especially with how easy they made it. Sure, Naruto had some impressive traps about his apartment, but Kakashi was a jonin thank you very much.\nKakashi was a tad impressed with Naruto\u2019s creativity and skill with traps though. He had heard of his pranks and like most others, not really considered the trap-potential in them. Now he was having second thoughts considering even Sasuke\u2019s traps weren\u2019t half as good as Naruto\u2019s.\nSakura had no traps of course. He\u2019d fix that later.\nKakashi tossed Naruto onto the back of Bull with his other two cute students and strapped them down. Then he and his ninken waved at the ANBU who watched them leave the gates. Kakashi had made sure to get permission before they left. This time at least.\nIt was the work of ten hours of some very, very, quick tree-hopping to get them deep into Fire Country, deep into the thickest parts of the forest and the wild. It would take the poor genin at least two weeks to walk back, maybe a week if they decided to run some of it. \nKakashi spent the next hour searching the area with his ninken for an ideal place. They found one that had a river and small lake with in a safe distance. The forests of Fire country were thick and wild, nigh on impenetrable to those who had not been raised to survive in them. Even civilians rarely left roads or towns. Such large swaths of wilderness always held large predators and dangerous plants. That wasn\u2019t even considering the more northern parts of the country that was still riddled with dead traps from the wars. \nBut what was deadly to civilians was safer for ninja. Not easier, but survivable. \nSo Kakashi found an area, dismissed his ninken, and dropped his students in a heap. He set their own sandals and three brand new travelling cloaks at their feet. And then he dismissed the genjutsu that had helped keep them asleep. Nearly as one they awoke, their instincts suddenly telling them something was wrong. Sasuke came awake ready and aware, leaping to his feet even as Sakura and Naruto groaned, rubbing their eyes and groggily peering.\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Kakashi chirped. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sakura asked, blinking as she realized she wasn\u2019t in bed.\n\u201cWuzzit?\u201d Naruto shook his head like a dog, \u201cWhere are we?!\u201d\nSasuke gave no accusations, just narrowed his eyes at Kakashi and took stock of the situation. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for some training ducklings!\u201d Kakashi sang, eye smiling, \u201cSurvival training specifically! Doesn\u2019t that sound fun?\u201d\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Sakura asked standing up finally, \u201cThis isn\u2019t Konoha.\u201d\n\u201cOh? How do you know that?\u201d Kakashi asked curiously.\nSakura flushed as Naruto and Sasuke looked at her as well and hesitantly pointed to a plant near Kakashi.\n\u201cUm, that\u2019s a species only found in southern Fire country, not near Konoha.\u201d\nSasuke and Naruto turned to Kakashi, one giving him a narrowed expression while the other gaped.\n\u201cWhat?! Why are we not in Konoha?!\u201d Naruto leapt to his feet. \nKakashi was quite pleased they had trusted Sakura immediately on her information. That was good. Trust was good. \n\u201cSurvival training,\u201d Kakashi repeated with a smile. \n\u201cDid you kidnap us out of bed?\u201d Sakura asked aghast as she realized she was in her pajamas. \nNaruto gave a shout of outrage as he realized this as well. Sasuke had already realized this, along with the fact he had no weapons.\n\u201cWe have no supplies,\u201d Sasuke said lowly.\n\u201cSurvival training,\u201d Kakashi repeated, \u201cIt isn\u2019t real if I gave you everything to survive. I was nice and brought your sandals and some cloaks for you. I will give you one more gift though.\u201d\n tossed three kunai to their feet and smiled. They shrank back from this smile. Kakashi would forgive them for that. This smile was a tad more foreboding and gleeful.\n\u201cYou have one month to make it back to Konoha,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll see you there. Good luck!\u201d\nAnd then he vanished before their eyes. Or appeared too. He watched from a tree branch, under layers of genjutsu, as the three panicked. Even Sasuke, who looked calm and collected on the outside, clenched his fists and stared at the ground. Naruto shouted a lot and Sakura looked a tad frazzled. \n\u201cHe left us!?\u201d Naruto howled.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Sakura hissed, \u201cCan he even do that?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to die!\u201d Naruto yelled again. \n\u201cWe won\u2019t die,\u201d Sakura snapped, \u201cHe won\u2019t be allowed to let us die.\u201d\n\u201cBut he abandoned us!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have to check in on us,\u201d Sakura said, trying to sound assured and sounding less than so. \nSasuke said nothing, simply pulled his sandals on, shouldered the cloak, and picked up the kunai at his feet, looking around. Kakashi could see his eyes tighten and his mouth curl downwards as the kid was hit by the realization he had no idea where they were.\n\u201cSakura,\u201d Sasuke said sharply, cutting into the other two\u2019s yelling, \u201cYou said we were in the south?\u201d\n\u201cUm, yes,\u201d Sakura said quickly, looking at Sasuke hopefully, \u201cDo you recognize the area?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never been outside of Konoha,\u201d Sasuke said stiffly.\n\u201cNeither have I,\u201d Sakura admitted.\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Naruto frowned, \u201cHow do we get back if we don\u2019t know where we are?\u201d\n\u201cIf we\u2019re south, we head north,\u201d Sasuke said simply.\n\u201cUm\u2026Fire Country is really big,\u201d Sakura said slowly, as if unsure she wanted to contradict Sasuke, \u201cWe could head North and still miss Konoha by a hundred kilometers easily.\u201d\nSasuke clenched his kunai and glared at the ground. Sakura drew back from the displeased expression on his face, clenching her hands worriedly. \n\u201cWhat about the stars?\u201d Naruto asked suddenly, \u201cIf we wait for night we can just follow them.\u201d\nThe other two turned to him slowly, surprised, and stared.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Naruto asked nervously as they continued to stare.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s actually really smart Naruto,\u201d Sakura said slowly.\n\u201cHehe,\u201d Naruto laughed nervously, scratching the back of his head, \u201cI mean, Iruka told us they can be used as a guide right? He helped me finish an assignment one night on them.\u201d\nThe two still stared as if they couldn\u2019t believe Naruto had had a good idea. \n\u201cOkay. So we wait for night,\u201d Sakura said hesitantly, \u201cWhat should we do till then?\u201d\n\u201cFood,\u201d Sasuke grunted. \n\u201cSuch a good idea!\u201d Sakura beamed at him, \u201cDo you know what we can eat?\u201d\nSasuke faltered.\n\u201cWe can hunt,\u201d he declared after only a brief pause.\n\u201cWe can eat some berries and roots and stuff to,\u201d Naruto said. \n\u201cWe meet back here tonight,\u201d Sasuke said, and then set off into the trees.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Sakura yelped leaping to her feet, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we stay together.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get in my way,\u201d Sasuke snorted as he disappeared into the undergrowth.\nSakura looked after him aghast and dejected.\n\u201cNe, Sakura,\u201d Naruto said hesitantly looking around, \u201cI think we should stay together.\u201d\n\u201cIf Sasuke says we don\u2019t need to,\u201d Sakura started strong.\nBut then she trailed off, looking about.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty deep in the woods,\u201d Naruto insisted, \u201cReally deep if Sensei thinks it will take us a month to get back. There are wild animals out here.\u201d\nAs if answering a call, a roar rang out from ahead of them where Sasuke had gone.\n\u201cSasuke!\u201d Sakura screamed even as Naruto leapt after the boy. \nKakashi followed as the two crashed through the bush and came upon Sasuke facing a giant bear. In the trees Kakashi chuckled weakly, not having expected them to have run into trouble that soon. But they were trained for all they weren\u2019t considered real Ninja, and Kakashi was pleasantly surprised when they even half worked together. \nSasuke and Naruto were quick enough to dodge any hits and Naruto kept spamming clones while Sasuke used some quick fire attacks when they realized their kunai were useless against the tough hide. The fight went on for a bit as Sakura leapt about the edges, obviously frayed and worried. Kakashi waited to see if she would jump in at all, and was finally rewarded when her expression changed and she put her hands together.\n\u201cSasuke, Naruto! Get out of the way!\u201d\nNaruto obeyed immediately, but Sasuke lingered until a Naruto-clone threw him out of the way. Then Sakura channeled her chakra and used a very low level genjutsu they were taught in the academy to make people think their opponents had disappeared, visually and scent wise. Kakashi was currently using a much more advanced version of it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make a sound!\u201d Sakura hissed at the two boys as the bear roared, confused.\nThey stood absolutely still at the edges, waiting as the bear sniffed about, rumbled, and finally strode off. When they were sure it was gone, Sakura dropped the jutsu, panting just the slightest.\n\u201cAwesome Sakura!\u201d Naruto crowed. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d she flushed.\nShe looked to Sasuke for kind words as well but he looked away, crossing his arms.\n\u201cWe need to stick together,\u201d Naruto announced, \u201cWe can hunt together or within yelling distance.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make decisions for us, Dead-last,\u201d Sasuke snapped. \n\u201cSays the person almost eaten by a bear!\u201d Naruto yelled.\n\u201cI was doing fine,\u201d Sasuke hissed, \u201cIdiot.\u201d\nIt quickly devolved into a scrap as Naruto lunged. \n\u201cStop it, both of you!\u201d Sakura finally interrupted, stamping her foot, \u201cWe have to work together! Which means no fighting! We don\u2019t have the energy to waste on fighting.\u201d\nThey looked away sullenly, but listening for now.\n\u201cFirst thing we need to find is water,\u201d Sakura said, tone bossy, \u201cWe can do without food for now and figure out the hunting thing later. But water we will need. On the way we can look for roots and berries.\u201d\nKakashi wore a pleased smile as he watched Sakura herd the two. He had hoped she would pick up a spine along the way and not make eyes at Sasuke constantly. He supposed being dropped in a forest and told to survive was a good way to do that. Maybe also the fact she had actually made a difference in a fight. Oh, she wasn\u2019t instantly cured, but he would bet anything that by the end of the month, she\u2019d be much less of a squealing fangirl. Especially if Sasuke kept this attitude up.\n.--.\nKakashi would readily admit he laughed himself sick when the kids found the river and tried fishing. None of them knew how to catch fish, let alone gut them. Sakura had come close to catching one, realized her finger was digging into an eye socket, and had a brilliant freak out throwing the fish away. Right into Sasuke\u2019s face. He was left spluttering, looking exactly like someone who had just been slapped by a fish. And then Naruto had almost drowned laughing and Sakura and Sasuke had had to drag him out of the water. \nThey did indeed learn though, going to bed that night full and sated, after they had finally figured out which way to head the next day. \nBut it couldn\u2019t be that easy for them, oh no. So Kakashi snuck into their camp, which was an old den under a tree that no bear could fit in, and stole two of the three kunai. Just to fuck with them he left fish in their places.\n.--.\nFour days later the kids were scratched, bruised, but looking to be doing okay as they slowly but surely made their way in the direction of Konoha. They had found a system of staying close but also splitting up to hunt, gather food, and scout out areas ahead of themselves. \nThey were doing well.\nThat meant it was time for Kakashi to step in and start to make it a tad more difficult.\n.--.\nThree days later and they finally figured out that they had been caught in a genjutsu and been walking in the opposite direction of Konoha. Sakura\u2019s scream of rage was louder than Naruto\u2019s. \nJust to be mean Kakashi caught them in another not an hour later.\n.--.\nKakashi was quite proud of how twitchy Sakura had gotten. To be honest they were all quite twitchy, glancing about with narrowed eyes and ready hands. But Sakura was the one who muttered \u2018kai\u2019 every hour and disrupted her chakra to make sure they were under no genjutsu.\nHe was even more proud when Naruto asked what she was doing and she made no complaint or insult before she taught him. She didn\u2019t even do anything but roll her eyes when Naruto had no idea what chakra was. \n.--.\nKakashi rubbed his chin thoughtfully as they got closer to Konoha and wondered what he would do to turn them away. They had been walking for two weeks now and even with his genjutsu setback they would make it in a week. He didn\u2019t want that though. He wanted them to take longer, to work together longer. \nSo Kakashi gathered his hands together and gleefully summoned his ninken in the night. \nHe was correct in his thinking that the kids would not know the difference between his ninken and wolves under the cover of night. They were awoken by the howling, and then snapping, howling, and quick flashes of teeth had his students running, leaping through the trees as his ninken harried them in a new direction. \nKakashi kept it up most of the night before letting his ninken vanish in the first rays of dawn, seemingly having lost the three. He watched as his kids collapsed, all panting and sweaty and wrecked from nerves and running all night. \nThis time it was Naruto and his boundless energy which got the three dunking in a river to clean off the stench of sweat and exhaustion that could be tracked. Then they somehow gathered enough energy to find food before collapsing in the tree tops. Kakashi watched over them as they slept, letting them have that rest.\nThat night they awoke and started moving again, following the stars. Kakashi figured he had set them back by about three days again. Kakashi decided to be merciful and allow them the rest of the journey unscathed.\n.--.\nWhen his cute little students tumbled through the gates of Konoha it was early morning. They were all dirty, tired, bruised, and looking exhausted, but they were all standing. \n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Kakashi chirped cheerfully from where he had been waiting by the gatehouse, \u201cYou made it with two days to spare! Good job!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Sakura hissed, looking wild with her bloodshot eyes, tangled dirty long hair, and dirtied torn pajamas under her cloak. \n\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Sasuke said darkly, just as disheveled and twitchy.\nNaruto, usually the one with boundless energy and a loud voice, merely growled.\n\u201cWell, since it\u2019s only early morning, I think we should do some training!\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nThis is where they started to crack.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Sakura said, tears in her eyes, \u201cNo more. We need time off.\u201d\nNaruto was nodding heartily looking close to tears as well.\n\u201cAw,\u201d Kakashi sighed as if disappointed, \u201cI suppose a short break would be okay. You have two hours to go shower, nap, eat, and then I want you in training grounds 4.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t even bother to argue just took off down the street without looking back. Kakashi grinned gleefully after them and set off to get some supplies.\n.--.\n\u201cI have decided to be nice,\u201d Kakashi announced, appearing via shunshin in the middle of the training clearing, \u201cWe\u2019ll do research today instead of any physical training.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a merciful sensei,\u201d Naruto cheered, \u201cWhat are we looking up?\u201d\nKakashi dropped an armful of scrolls and books.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be studying survival techniques and knowledge,\u201d he grinned, \u201cEverything from how to survive with no chakra to what plants are okay to eat. For all the countries.\u201d\n\u201cA-all the countries?\u201d Sakura spluttered.\n\u201cYou had it easy,\u201d Kakashi nodded sagely, \u201cThe academy teaches more about Konoha\u2019s landscape than any of the other countries. But ninja missions take you far and wide and you need to be ready for emergencies.\u201d\nAnd so the reluctantly took scrolls and books as Kakashi started to lecture in between, keeping them all on the same topics. He would give them a wide basic understanding, and then start to focus on individual talents. He already planned to educate Sakura in herbs and plants for consumption and medical usage. Sasuke would be on scouting and sensing enemy, along with how to disguise their trail. Naruto would be their trap specialist and hunter. \nSo they set in for an exciting day of research. The fact that none of them complained showed they were still very much cowed. Perhaps the exhaustion was keeping them quiet as well.\n.--.\nThe growl of Naruto\u2019s stomach interrupted Kakashi while he was teaching Sakura about useful medicinal plants. Everyone looked up at Naruto who blushed. \n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s dinner time,\u201d he grouched. \nIt was rather late in the day Kakashi realized looking up at the sun. \n\u201cA quick break then,\u201d Kakashi said. \nHe had sent Sasuke running to the convenience store earlier and they had had some snacks and drinks, but they would be needing food. \n\u201cYou guys have half an hour to relax while I go get dinner,\u201d Kakashi announced.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done?\u201d Naruto asked mournfully.\n\u201cAre you finished the scroll I assigned you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he pouted, mulishly.\n\u201cThen nope!\u201d Kakashi grinned right before he disappeared.\nWhen Kakashi returned half an hour later he had his arms stacked in take-out boxes. \n\u201cI love you!\u201d Naruto screamed as he realized there were four bowls of ramen in there for him. \nEven Sakura and Sasuke looked happy to see the pile of food he had brought.\n\u201cSensei can treat you sometimes,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully, \u201cBut don\u2019t get used to it.\u201d\nThey devoured their food even as Kakashi quizzed them on what they had learned for the day. They replied in between bites and yawns. By the time they had finished they were yawning, rubbing at their eyes adorably and looking ready to drop off. Well, it was late and they had been exhausted.\nAlso Kakashi had drugged their food.\nKakashi cackled when Naruto was the last to drift off, having needed nearly five times the amount of drugs the other two had. \nTheir screams of rage the next day, when they woke hundreds of kilometers outside of Konoha would warm the cockles of his heart.\n.--.\nThis time around Kakashi had dropped them off to the West in the middle of the mountains. This time he also stole their sandals, stole their shirts, stole their cloaks, and left them hunting knives. He had also given them only two weeks.\nThe mountains were a much different territory then the vast but mostly flat woods of Southern Fire country. Watching his kid\u2019 scale a mountain yelling about no shoes, only to find a group of very angry mountain sheep sent Kakashi into hysterical laughing, especially when Naruto ended up getting head-butted off a cliff. Oh he was ready to step in if needed, but his kids were resilient. \nThis time when he came at them with genjutsu, he layered it. It took Sakura only one day to realize it was there, hidden under weaker layers that he reset every time she dismissed the last one. When she wasn\u2019t strong enough to disrupt this stronger hidden layer, it was Sasuke who remembered pain could be a better disrupter and they all bit their lips hard while using \u2018kai\u2019. Kakashi was very proud. \nWhen they ran into a bear this time, they were ready. Naruto\u2019s creativity paired with Sakura\u2019s more academic knowledge paired with Sasuke\u2019s practicality had armed them with handmade spears and they actually brought the bear down. It was Kakashi\u2019s earlier lessons on their \u2018day off\u2019 that had taught them how to skin and cut up a larger animal, or at least the theoretical knowledge.\nThey messed up a bit of course and the hide wasn\u2018t useful with how much they had cut it, but they got a good deal of meat from it. They spent the next few hours cooking enough meat to last them a few days, even unrefrigerated. \nThen Kakashi followed them over a few more mountains, Sakura gathering plants as they went, some edible, some medicinal. Sasuke learned how to hide their tracks better and was a very devoted scout. Naruto made sure that every time they hunkered down for the night, even with limited supplies, nothing would be able to make it them unawares. \nWhen they had realized how far out from Konoha they were, and with the two week time limit, they had realized they needed to set a fast pace to make it back. So they did with very little complaint. None of them were at a place where they could run as fast or as far as a jonin, but they weren\u2019t civilians either and they kept a steady jog up most days. \nNaruto by far had the most stamina, a truly ridiculous amount for a kid his age and size. Sasuke was well trained as well but even he could tire. Sakura on the other hand was the weak link and they all realized it. During the first month Sasuke had been dismissive and even cruel in some of his comments aimed at her. Kakashi didn\u2019t think the boy actually knew how mean his words were but they had affected Sakura. She had been dejected at first, near tears at some remarks, but as Kakashi had guessed, she was stubborn. Sakura was far too stubborn to give up. \nSakura was also not a doormat. She let Sasuke get away with quite a few comments, quite a few barbs for the first few weeks, trying desperately to keep up and keep polite and \u2018cute\u2019 in front of her crush. But at some point, when you\u2019re lost in the woods for weeks at a time, driven to exhaustion every day, and made to survive off what you can forage with only the company of two boys, sometimes you snap. \nSakura had snapped brilliantly. It happened in the first week of this new trip when Sasuke made another decisive comment offhand about how weak she was. Sakura, driven to the very edge of her strength trying to keep up with the faster stronger boys who had far more training than her, was at her wits end and it showed. So when Sasuke made that one fated comment, not even the thought of her crush could stop her. \nWith a roar, Sakura had launched herself at the startled Sasuke. It took the combined effort of three Naruto clones to pull the two apart as Sakura tried her best to beat Sasuke\u2019s face in. Kakashi had also noted her anger problems but she had kept them well contained. Now they were unleashed. \nKakashi watched in interest at how strong Sakura\u2019s hits were, how coordinated. That girl had potential in taijutsu was all he thought as he watched. Her academy profile said she was weak in taijutsu, average in form and strength. Kakashi wondered how often she had pulled her punches because \u2018ladies weren\u2019t violent\u2019. Wondered how weak her previous diet had made her. Wondered how much Sakura had repressed to be a cute little lady in front of Sasuke. \nWell that cute little lady was beating Sasuke\u2019s face in. \n\u201cSakura! You\u2019re gonna really hurt him!\u201d Naruto yelped, two clones holding the girl down while the other helped Sasuke up, \u201cNot that the bastard doesn\u2019t deserve it but I don\u2019t want to have to carry him back to Konoha!\u201d\nSasuke spit out a wad of blood, reaching up to touch his broken nose, obviously still bewildered. Sakura let out another cry of fury, raging against Naruto\u2019s hands before she finally stopped, collapsing panting.\nFor a moment silence rang out as Naruto looked between the two nervously and Sasuke touched his bloodied face. And then Sakura burst into heaving sobs. Kakashi decided it was time to intervene.\n\u201cNaruto, go help Sasuke clean his face in a stream. Don\u2019t reset touch his nose, I\u2019ll reset it.\u201d\nNone of the three looked all that surprised to see him. They had of course known he was following, watching over them due to his genjutsu and his way of fucking with them. Naruto did as he said, dragging Sasuke away and dismissing his clones. Kakashi hovered over the sobbing heap for a minute, trying very hard not to have an allergic reaction to emotions. Then he sighed, maned up and gathered the girl into a hug.\nSakura clung to him like a limpet, sobbing into his vest.\n\u201cHush now Sakura,\u201d Kakashi pat her back gently.\n\u201cH-He\u2019s an asshole,\u201d she cried.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d Kakashi said wryly, \u201cMost Uchiha were.\u201d\nSakura sniffled and snuffled and Kakashi waited with her, rubbing soothing circles in her back, as she slowly got her tears under control. \n\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Sakura finally sniffled pulling back to wipe at the tears and snot on her face. \n\u201cSakura,\u201d Kakashi said gently, \u201cDo you really want to?\u201d\nSakura heard all the unasked questions and quieted for a moment.\n\u201cI-I\u2026I want to be strong,\u201d she finally whispered as if confessing a secret.\n\u201cAnd you will be,\u201d Kakashi told her seriously, \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m doing this training?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTeamwork. You said the first day it was the most important thing,\u201d she wiped her nose, \u201cBut, but, our team sucks!\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. You have been working together,\u201d he smiled, \u201cWould you have been able to do this alone, would any of you have?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026maybe Naruto,\u201d Sakura admitted slowly like it was an unfair truth, \u201cBut even he would have\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cYou all clash but you have been working together well. Teamwork doesn\u2019t always mean loving the other person or even liking them. It\u2019s about working together anyways, knowing they are your comrade, and at the end of the day, making sure everyone stays alive.\u201d\nSakura nodded miserably.\n\u201cPlus, this training has done other things as well,\u201d he offered lightly, \u201cWould you have put as much effort into stamina if you had been assigned laps at the village?\u201d\nShe shook her head knowing the truth they both already knew. Sakura would have obeyed but she wouldn\u2019t have put such effort, such desperation into it.\n\u201cDo you trust me Sakura?\u201d Kakashi finally asked.\nShe looked up at him, surprised. \n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, without hesitating.\nKakashi felt his smile shift, twist to become a small genuine thing.\n\u201cEven though I\u2019ve abandoned you in the forest twice now?\u201d he smiled.\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t,\u201d she said, a tad bewildered, \u201cWe knew you were watching us.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not upset I left you to fight bears and such?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, its training,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a bit difficult.\u201d\nKakashi pat her on the head happily.\n\u201cMah, my cute students, understanding my lessons. You\u2019re a very bright child Sakura.\u201d\nShe flushed happily at the compliment. \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about Sasuke, he\u2019s a bit emotionally stunted but he\u2019ll come around. Without needing to punch him in the face.\u201d\nHe gave her a pointed look and she flushed again, this time in embarrassment.\n\u201cMaybe wait until we spar, ne? While I don\u2019t usually condone violence against teammates, spars are a different matter,\u201d he relented with a wink, \u201cAnd don\u2019t let his comments get to you. You never had the privilege of clan training or the heritage that predisposed you to the shinobi arts. You are doing fantastic on your own.\u201d\nShe beamed up at him and he ruffled her hair again.\n\u201cNow, put on a brave face, apologize for beating his face in, and start heading for Konoha again. If you guys make it in five days instead of seven, Dinner is on me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I trust any of your offers anymore,\u201d she huffed but stood, wiping the rest of her tears and snot away.\n \u201cHow about I swear to never drug you guys again then,\u201d he offered, \u201cIt was a tad rude of me.\u201d\nShe peered at him to see if he was being honest before offering a small shy smile and a nod.\n\u201cAnd Sakura, I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\nHer resulting smile was a blinding beam. Kakashi left her to get the boys. Naruto was lecturing Sasuke relentlessly about being a good teammate even as he was helping wash the last of the blood of his face.\n\u201cGood job separating them Naruto, now why don\u2019t you go join Sakura while I help Sasuke reset his nose.\u201d\nNaruto stuck his tongue out at Sasuke and vanished after Sakura.\n\u201cNow, Sasuke, can you tell me what you did wrong?\u201d\nSasuke stared mulishly at the water. Kakashi sighed and motioned him over. It was the work of a moment to reset his nose, Kakashi\u2019s hand lit green with his very basic grasp of medical chakra.\n\u201cSasuke,\u201d Kakashi prodded.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have insulted a teammate,\u201d he finally said.\n\u201cYes. Does Sakura deserve you insults?\u201d\nSasuke struggled.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he finally admitted voice a tad lower.\n\u201cShe has been working really hard to keep up with you boys. You know she\u2019s not as skilled as you yet. And while some of the blame can be placed on her and her lack of effort, you must know that she is trying and that what training is for.\u201d\nSasuke wasn\u2019t looking at him, but Kakashi could tell he was listening. \n\u201cShe\u2019s even let up on the fangirling hasn\u2019t she? She\u2019s been much more exhausted then both of you, but she\u2019s not dragging you behind. Her knowledge has been an asset and you know it, even if she can\u2019t run as far as you guys each day.\u201d\nSasuke looked at his feet, eyes unfocused.\n\u201cSakura is your teammate, Sasuke. She will be, even when you all become chunin. That could be years of interaction. It will be years of being with her on missions and in training. It will be days upon days upon days of her company. It will be battles upon battles where she will be watching your back for you. She may even be what stands between you and death one day. Wouldn\u2019t you agree it would be good to have a good working relationship with her?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026shes annoying,\u201d Sasuke said, a sulk in his voice.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a twelve-year-old girl. Most twelve-year-olds are annoying,\u201d Kakashi said lightly, \u201cBut you can admit she\u2019s changed hasn\u2019t she? Just as she will change every day for the next few years as she grows and matures.\u201d\nSasuke nodded hesitantly.\n\u201cNow, I think if she does something you don\u2019t agree with you are allowed to speak up and talk to her about it. You can tell her you are not interested in dating or fangirls. Tell her honestly and straight and she will back off. If she doesn\u2019t, I will make sure she does. But snapping at her for being slower is not fair to her. She is trying. And she will not always be as good as you, nor will you always be as good as her. Teams are meant to round each other out. You will both have your skills and your weaknesses.\u201d\nSasuke finally sighed and nodded.\n\u201cNow, you\u2019re going to apologize for insulting her. She will apologize for punching you in the face. And when we get back to Konoha, we will have a nice chat all together.\u201d\nSasuke only hesitated a moment and then nodded.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kakashi smiled. \nKakashi watched from the trees as Naruto frowned at both teammates till they apologized and shook hands. He had told neither of the boys about the deal for dinner. He didn\u2019t want them pushing Sakura, he wanted Sakura pushing them. \nSo he watched happily as they started to run. Kakashi may or may not have cleared the way for them, lessening his genjutsu and taking care of a cougar as they set off for home.\n.--.\nThe three students that stumbled in the gates at the end of the fifth day looked like wild feral things. Since Kakashi had stolen their cloaks, shoes, and shirts at the beginning (to Sakura\u2019s embarrassment despite the fact her sports bra was more cover than many ninja wore), they had spent some precious time scavenging. Kakashi was impressed with the reed sandals they had woven. He was also impressed with the spears and the make-shift bamboo canteens. \nHe was also impressed by how they had given up baths to make it back at the five day mark and all stood grimy and dirtied and panting, gazing at Kakashi, awaiting a command.\nHe beamed at them.\n\u201cGood job! You all did very well. You have tomorrow off.\u201d\nThey cheered, even if it was somewhat tired. \n\u201cBut the day after that we meet here at seven am. Pack for a month long trip. Make sure you have everything from weapons to rations. Don\u2019t worry about tents. I doubt any of you have one yet so I will provide those.\u201d\nThey stared up at his smile, aghast.\n\u201cSensei, please,\u201d Sakura said weakly.\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t abandon you alone in a forest again,\u201d Kakashi soothed, \u201cIt\u2019s a training trip.\u201d\nThe relaxed minusculely and he waved them off. Kakashi grinned after them.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to mutiny,\u201d Kotetsu murmured having watched the last interaction as well.\n\u201cAnd kill you,\u201d Izumo said sympathetically, \u201cIn a \u2018training accident\u2019 and we will never find your body.\u201d\n\u201cMah, they can try,\u201d Kakashi waved a hand, \u201cSuch cute little ninja. I am sure they\u2019ll love this trip.\u201d\n\u201cYup. Totally going to mutiny,\u201d The two nodded even as Kakashi wandered off to do his own planning and packing.\n.--.\n\u201cOkay kiddies, let\u2019s see what you packed,\u201d Kakashi said as he appeared amongst his three students. \nHe could already see they had over-packed. He supposed they were a tad paranoid after having already seen Kakashi\u2019s version of training. Kakashi went through their weapons, noting quality and quantity, Sasuke having the higher quality but Naruto having the most and most varied. He went through their medical supplies, Sakura by far the most prepared with Naruto the least. He went through the rations, Sakura having a good solid amount while Naruto had the most and Sasuke had the most balanced nutritious ones. As for bedrolls, Sasuke once again had the highest quality and Naruto the least. \nIt was easy to read their circumstances in their supplies. Naruto on his shoe string budget but with a trap-ninja mind frame and living a bit of a harder life. Sasuke with his pick of the Uchiha weapons, supplies, and money. Sakura with no ninja background to help know more intimate details but a good practical mind-frame. \n\u201cOkay, seems like you\u2019ll be good. A little more than you really need but oh well,\u201d Kakashi shrugged and didn\u2019t let any of his plans to help them lose some of that extra luggage show.\nTheir outfits had changed slightly as well and Kakashi nodded as he looked them over. Sakura and Sasuke had switched to pants. They were both light and breathable in the hot weather, but would cover more at night when it got chilly. They had both picked sensible black pants and strapped them to their ankles with bandages. Sasuke had kept his wide collared blue shirt but wore a tight dark colored long sleeves shirt underneath. Sakura had kept her red shirt that hung low to her knees, but also wore a thin long sleeve shirt under it and a dark green vest over it with a hood. Naruto still has the orange jumpsuit, but Kakashi could see he wore an extra layer of mesh and bandages underneath. All three now wore fingerless dark gloves.\nHe was quite proud as he quickly realized what every extra layer was for. The three had found out how much help an extra layer of clothes could be, not just for protection or warmth but to be used as extra material. Shirts could be cut into emergency bandages of made into rope. Extra bandages could be used as thread and ties. Everything could be of use, but bags could be lost, clothes often weren\u2019t. \nThey also all carried the dark brown cloaks he had given to them on the first trip. They were meant to blend in well with trees and dirt, waterproof and thick. \n\u201cOkay then team, lets head out!\u201d he beamed. \n.--.\nKakashi didn\u2019t tell the kids where they were going, just pushed them at a fast pace. At the end of each day they were all panting an exhausted. For the first week Kakashi didn\u2019t bother setting watches, just let them rig traps and alarms and they all slept. On the second week he started a watch rotation as they drew further and further from Konoha.\n\u201cWhere are we going sensei?\u201d Sakura finally asked after the second week of hard quick travel.\n\u201cTo the border of Tea country,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cAlong the coast.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cMeh, seems as good as place as any,\u201d he shrugged.\n\u201cIf any place would work why are we going two weeks out of our way?\u201d she asked, exasperated.\n\u201cMah, it\u2019s teaching you all how to travel quickly and efficiently,\u201d he smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s a taste of what we would be expected to do if we were to be called on a mission\u201d\nSakura drew back, thoughtful at that. It was true. Kakashi had been teaching them watch rotations, how to pick their way through unfamiliar terrain in a more sure way then just trying to bumble home as quick as they could. When he had dropped them in the woods their only goal had been get home in a decent time frame. Now he was teaching them how to actually travel through terrain with a leading commander and supplies. There was a difference. \nThey didn\u2019t ask any more questions about where they were going as they efficiently travelled forwards. Kakashi taught them how to best jump quietly through the trees, working on their bounding and leaping and footing. He hadn\u2019t taught them how to stick with chakra yet, but he wanted them to learn without it at first. If they ever found themselves drained or unable to use chakra, being able to still leap and twist gracefully and quickly through the trees was a good skill. \nKakashi also taught them better how to hide their tracks, how to hide signs of a camp. He taught them how to make false signs as well and lay false trails. He taught them about how you could be tracked. He didn\u2019t teach them any ninja skills as much. He taught a low level genjutsu or two for hiding their trail, but everything else was a survival technique require merely wits and knowledge. \nKakashi also took the time to tell them of various mission stories he knew weren\u2019t classified. At the end he\u2019d subtly test what they had been listening for, what they had been picking up. Every story had a lesson, be it how to escape a bad situation, when to abandon a mission, when to continue, etc. Kakashi made sure they remembered and could repeat what to do in situations back to him. He also tested all the things they should know coming out of the academy knowledge wise. \nHe did all of this easily enough as they travelled, his cute little genin panting and rushing after him, answering him between gasps and pants as he worked on their stamina and barely paused. He knew he was pushing them hard but none of them complained.\nSasuke and Naruto would never complain, Sasuke wanting strength and Naruto always wanting to know more about how to be \u2018an awesome ninja\u2019. Naruto would grumble of course, ask how certain things were relevant, but if Kakashi explained he would quiet down and listen. Sakura would have been the one to complain if the past two trips and the consequential punching Sasuke in the face conversation had not occurred. Instead she was determined not to be the one left behind.\nKakashi was very, very proud of all of them by the time they reached the border of Tea country and stood on a beach, looking out at the Kawa pass. \n.--.\n\u201cOkay, we need a more permanent camp,\u201d Kakashi smiled at his exhausted students, \u201cOnce that is set up you may have a day off to explore the area and relax.\u201d\nSakura gave a halfhearted cheer. \n\u201cNow, where is the ideal location? We aren\u2019t in enemy territory, nor should there be any foreign ninja in this area unless they are passing by on a mission. Nor are there any villages within a day walk, so doubtful we will see any bandits.\u201d\nThe three glanced at one another.\n\u201cIn the trees I think,\u201d Sakura said hesitantly, \u201cDefinitely not in the open on the beach here.\u201d\nAll Konoha ninja felt safer under trees and so he nodded. He got them working on an idea of what their camp should look like, chipping in here and there, until they had sketched out something in the dirt and then they all set out together to find an ideal place. They ended up twenty minutes back into the tree line beside a small creek, tucked out of the way. \nKakashi pulled his own supplies out via a seal scroll and handed the three confused genin a set of axes.\n\u201cWell, go cut some trees down. We have enough tarp to make a covered area but we need some poles.\u201d\nThey set out after a bit more encouraging and Kakashi watched until they came back, dragging some young cut trees. Together they all set up a wide tarped area, using an extra-large tarp Kakashi had brought of molted greens and browns. It was an extra thick one and they draped it up and over the poles so it fell down the sides where they tied it down. \n\u201cYou won\u2019t always have the tools to make a camp like this, but if prepared for longer stake-outs or stationary missions, it is very useful,\u201d Kakashi told them, \u201cTents are fine by themselves but are by necessity small. If you are in the same place for a long time these tarps can help with camouflage but also provide you shelter from wind and rain while giving you a communal area.\u201d\nThey also dug a small fire pit under the new tent like tarp and Kakashi showed them how to use it without smoking themselves out. Then he dug out the two tents he had brought and directed them to set them up still under the large tarp near the back.\n\u201cYou will decide how we are pairing up. Two people a tent,\u201d Kakashi said.\nSakura hesitated, as if she wanted to object. But she\u2019d spent the last two months curled up in a heap with the two due to minimal supplies and the chilly nights.\n\u201cSometimes you will not have the opportunity for separate sleeping arrangements,\u201d Kakashi further drilled, \u201cBest get used to it.\u201d\nDespite the fact he did not want to talk to them about it, Kakashi made a mental note to make sure they had all had the Talk. The academy should have went over it, with warnings of how rape was used as a weapon, but kids never listened well to such talks. Too giggly and thoughtless at that age. Kakashi would make sure they understood the safety, the danger, and what No meant. He could turn it to harassment as well and kill whatever was left Sakura\u2019s fangirling. They needed to know how to respect other people. \nHe watched as they set the tents up and when they were done sent them out with the axes again to gather firewood.\nHe was pleasantly surprised when they returned, arms loaded with wood, and a brace of pheasants hanging from Naruto\u2019s shoulder. Naruto babbled a story about running across them as he held them up like an offering to Kakashi.\n\u201cGood job,\u201d he told the boy.\nNaruto beamed, all sunny smiles and crinkled eyes, as if he had been offered the world. Sometimes Kakashi was reminded of how desolate Naruto\u2019s life had been and what a small bit of praise meant to him. He was constantly reminded that these cute little kids, trying so very hard to be shinobi, were in fact kids. Twelve-year-old little kids with stick thin wrists and wide eyes. It was so easy to forget. Too easy to forget. \n\u201cNow, what else could we need?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow at all of them.\nThey shuffled and looked at one another.\n\u201cProximity alerts and traps!\u201d Naruto finally chirped up. \n\u201cGood. Go set those up. And show Sakura and Sasuke how and where. Then you can have the rest of the day free.\u201d\nKakashi watched them run off fondly and turned to gutting the pheasants to get them ready for dinner. \n.--.\nKakashi watched with half an eye as his cute little students ran around the beach and through the water. It was not sandy here, more rocky but they had no care, turning over rocks to look at crabs and fish. It was revealed Naruto couldn\u2019t swim more than an instinctive doggy paddle and soon Sakura was teaching him with a bossy tone. \nKakashi was merely there to make sure they didn\u2019t drown as he sat with his book open as a prop and mentally made a list of what they needed to learn. \nTree walking, water walking, various ninjutsu, various genjutsu, he needed to get their hand signs down to half signs, he needed to make sure they knew the basic academy jutsu so well they could do them in their sleep. They also all needed taijutsu practice as Naruto only had a brawler style, Sakura didn\u2019t suit the academy style, and Sasuke had never learned the full Uchiha form. He needed to make sure Naruto was caught up on everything and get him started on some more high-level traps and perhaps seals. Sasuke needed more elemental jutsu and perhaps some blade training. Sakura needed some more of everything to better round her out. \nIt was going to be a long few weeks. But, Kakashi would have the distinct pleasure of not being the one tired or exhausted.\nHis students looked up at him alarmed as he let a cackle out.\n.--.\nPeople liked to joke that they felt bad for whatever team of genin finally got Kakashi as their sensei. With how many he failed it had become a larger joke that many jonin weren\u2019t afraid to rib him over. With his chronic lateness, bad excuses, bad habits, bad self-care, and all around eccentricity people assumed he would be a terrible role model for children.\nKakashi wondered if he should be offended. \nBut the thing was, the thing people brushed aside, was Kakashi was a genius. He was smart. Most people had also forgotten that Kakashi had taught teams before. It was an open secret that he had been an ANBU captain, and Tenzo called him senpai all the time, but people seemed to forget. They seemed to forget that ANBU captains were responsible for training teams and new recruits. \nSo Kakashi had been a teacher, albeit not of genin, but really, ANBU weren\u2019t that much different, you just taught them at a higher level. \n\u201cHow is everyone feeling?\u201d Kakashi beamed at his students.\nA series of groans and moans met his ears as he looked at the slumped exhausted genin. The first day of training had gone well. Better than well in fact. He had taught them tree walking to start. \nSakura had gotten it on her first try. \nKakashi had tried not to gape at her the way the boys had when she reached the top of the tree with one single try. The boys had been envious and awed, but Kakashi had been blown away. None of them understood how much chakra control something like that took. That wasn\u2019t even a skill Kakashi had gotten down on his very first try (his third, but still not the first). As he half listened to Sakura try to help the boys out by saying what she had done, Kakashi\u2019s mind had sprung into overdrive on what he could teach a with that level of chakra control. \nHe had set the boys to mastering it and pulled her off towards the water to get her started on water-walking. He twitched only the slightest when it took her five minutes to get it down. He\u2019d made her practice on water all day to help her grow her chakra reserves, telling her to practice jumping and sliding and running and even pulling herself out of the water with her hands. \nBy the end of the day, all three had gotten it down, though Naruto had needed a bit more one on one coaching, but Kakashi could see his problem lay in how much chakra he had. \n\u201cWe have to do dinner now,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cWhat shall we have? Shall we go fishing?\u201d\n\u201cCan please just eat rations tonight?\u201d Sakura groaned, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the energy to forage or hunt.\u201d\nKakashi gave them a long look before relenting. He made them do all the preparation though. It only took half an hour for a fire to be started in their cover, rations cooked, and each of them to be sitting on a log in a circle, happily eating.\nKakashi let them have some peace while they ate. He wouldn\u2019t push them physically in the evening unless they needed some night training, but he had an array of other things to teach them.\n.--.\nThe first two weeks went well. \nKakashi ran his cute little genin into the ground either physically or mentally every day. They spent many a morning and afternoon working tirelessly on taijutsu, a clone giving them each one-on-one time to refine and work on katas. To Sasuke he gave more of the Uchiha\u2019s main form, copied from working with various Uchiha on the battlefield. To Naruto he showed how to hit harder, how to roll with the punches better, how to shift between stances flawlessly; his brawler style suited him too well to try introducing a formal form. To Sakura he gave her various stances of the Iron Fist style; Gai would agree with her potential when he saw her use it. \nEvenings were spent on chakra control, playing tag across the rolling waves or upside down on trees. He taught them to fight and roll across the water and across any surface. They switched back and forth, from one surface to another, sticking with their hands or feet as he threw them about in games of keep away. If they were too tired to keep running after their taijutsu in the morning, they did slower exercises, carrying boulders across the water and mediating upside down. He watched Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s control grow in leaps and bounds while Sakura\u2019s chakra reserve swelled. \nOn days they were too tired and sore to move he drew them into what seemed like simple games and questions and conversations. Every single one was a test, a skill to learn. Kakashi had them play question games that could double as interrogation with more dangerous intel. They played keep away games designed to train them to avoid enemies. They played games that involved innocent play-acting that could be disguises and personas for infiltration later. They played word games that worked like codebreaking. They played games trying to make Kakashi give them answers that could be used for intel gathering.\nSasuke was the most reluctant to play \u2018games\u2019 of course, but the other two dragged him in and he had gotten better at listening to commands from Kakashi. Punishment, especially physical activity after an exhausting day was helping Sasuke get over his attitude. Perhaps also the fact that Kakashi had given what he always wanted; training. \nThe first two weeks were on stamina and taijutsu and chakra control exercises and subtle mind games. \nThe third week he moved them onto ninjutsu much to Naruto\u2019s glee.\n.--.\n\u201cNaruto, stop laughing at him,\u201d Sakura sighed, exasperated. \nBut Naruto was a heap of giggles and laughter as he pointed wordlessly at Sasuke\u2019s eyebrows. Or lack off.\n\u201cThat is the danger of fire jutsu,\u201d Kakashi eye-smiled, \u201cThey can blow up in your face if not careful.\u201d\nSasuke kept his face expressionless but kept giving these full body twitches. \n\u201cMah, you\u2019re turn Naruto,\u201d Kakashi said, subtly edging Sakura and Sasuke back, \u201cAnd remember, too much chakra and it will get your eyebrows too.\u201d\nNaruto leapt eagerly to his feet and ran through the hand seals without chakra with Kakashi at his side. Kakashi made sure every one of them was right and showed him how to control the fire when it bloomed. Then he made sure to put a good twenty feet between him and the blond. Sasuke and Sakura, behind his protective form, looked up at him, confused as to why they were suddenly giving Naruto space. Kakashi just watched, waiting for the explosion.\nNaruto, with a jinchurki\u2019s chakra and with little control from excitement and a lack of experience trying to use an explosive fire jutsu, did not disappoint.\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Sakura blurted out tucked under Kakashi\u2019s arm.\nSasuke merely stared from under Kakashi\u2019s other arm, eyes wide beneath his singed face. Kakashi raised a brow at Sakura.\n\u201cOh, sorry for swearing,\u201d Sakura squeaked, flushing.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s deserved,\u201d Kakashi said blandly from where they stood on a tree branch, forty feet away from the blast zone. \nHis clone had already went to put the fire out while another checked on Naruto.\n\u201cDID YOU SEE THAT?!\u201d Naruto screamed looking spastically happy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the whole country did,\u201d Sasuke frowned. \nKakashi gently patted Naruto down, trying to wipe ash and soot from where it layered the whole boy. Naruto was missing his eyebrows now too and his hair was singed. His jumpsuit would probably be a loss as well. Kakashi said nothing about the burns that healed even as he watched. Naruto was shouting and squirming in his grasp and when he finally let the boy go he started leaping about, waving his arms excitedly as he took in the damage. \n\u201cMah, maybe you should celebrate after you actually master it, not fail at it,\u201d Kakashi said much to Sasuke\u2019s smugness and Naruto sulk.\n.--.\nHe did not test his students for their affinity yet, though he had his suspicions regarding each one. Instead he gave them a few small ranked jutsu of every style, refusing to let the knowledge of what they would be best at psychologically hamper them. When they looked frustrated or close to giving up, he gave them an extra moment, gave them extra tips, and pit them against one another, using their competitive streak against them. Sasuke was the best at ninjutsu, unsurprisingly, with his average chakra, his decent control, and his previous training. Naruto had the most powerful ninjutsu unsurprisingly. But Sakura surprised with how creative she could get in using her jutsus, her control allowing her to twist many of them beyond their basic purpose; she could turn a stream of fire into a lance or a set of them with careful focus. \nAfter their week of ninjutsu, Kakashi started them on genjutsu. \nSasuke had a knack for it and would be even better when he awoke his sharingan, and Sakura was quickly picking them up, but Naruto was utterly hopeless at them. Kakashi declared him unteachable by the third day and moved him back to chakra control exercises and practicing his ninjutsu. The other two did well with genjutsu and Naruto could use the time to perfect his other work. Whereas he would never let his students get away without knowing a few basic ninjutsu, genjutsu was a different area and sometimes you just didn\u2019t have the talent for it. Naruto accepted it with good grace and went back to blowing himself up with ninjutsu quite happily. \nHe didn\u2019t let them get away with no physical activity of course and mornings were still dedicated to exercising and sparring. His students seemed to enjoy actual jutsu lessons more though, as younger ninja usually did. Something about being able to bend elements and making illusions seemingly cooler than just kicking. \n.--.\n\u201cHow does this look, Kakashi-sensei?\u201d Sakura asked hopefully, holding her paper up to the light of the fire.\nKakashi took it and titled it towards the lantern light near his own pile of papers. He peered at it carefully, giving it due consideration.\n\u201cVery good Sakura. Your symbols are very neat and tidy. Work on infusing your chakra a bit more.\u201d\nShe beamed at him and set to practicing again. Sasuke held his out without a word.\n\u201cGood. Your symbols could stand to be a bit wider, especially these ones, so they interact better, but your chakra flow is good.\u201d\nSasuke shot Naruto a smug look as Naruto held his own work up beaming. \n\u201cUm\u2026,\u201d Kakashi said, turning the paper around, not sure which way was up, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did it, but despite the fact I have no idea what I\u2019m looking at it is ready to function.\u201d\n\u201cHear that!\u201d Naruto cheered, \u201cI\u2019m better than you at sealing Sasuke!\u201d\n\u201cNaruto, bragging is unattractive,\u201d Sakura said blandly.\n\u201cBut Sakura!\u201d Naruto whined. \n\u201cI suppose I should have assumed you\u2019d be good at this,\u201d Kakashi hummed.\n\u201cHuh, what, why?\u201d Naruto demanded.\nHis eyes had narrowed as he looked at Kakashi almost nervously. Kakashi glanced down to where the boy\u2019s hand crept up his stomach. Kakashi wondered how the boy had drew that conclusion.\n\u201cBecause your mother was an expert at sealing,\u201d Kakashi said.\nA harsh silence fell over the camp. Naruto had frozen up, going stiff and still. Sakura and Sasuke turned to Kakashi with surprise, both knowing full well Naruto was an orphan.\n\u201cM-my mother?\u201d Naruto stuttered.\n\u201cYes. Uzumaki Kushina. Amazing woman,\u201d Kakashi nodded, aiming for a light tone.\n\u201cYou knew her?\u201d Naruto whispered low and hopeful.\n\u201cHey Sasuke, let\u2019s go check the perimeter,\u201d Sakura announced standing up and abandoning her work.\nSasuke went with no fight. Kakashi was very proud of them.\n\u201cSit down Naruto,\u201d Kakashi said gently.\nNaruto sat down instantly still staring at him wide eyed.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner,\u201d Kakashi started, \u201cI should have, but I didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I could use the excuse most other people use, about how your mother has enemies who would love to take their revenge out on you, but truth is, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026you were friends then?\u201d Naruto asked, all trembling hope.\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d Kakashi allowed, \u201cHer name was Uzumaki Kushina and she was from Uzu before it fell, but grew up in Konoha. She was a fierce and strong woman, and like most from Uzu, a seal master.\u201d\nAnd so Kakashi told Naruto what he could without giving any real details away. Naruto listened attentive and desperate, shifting closer and closer until he was curled up against Kakashi\u2019s legs. Sasuke and Sakura stayed out of the way, hovering at the edges of camp. And Kakashi told Naruto what he should have told the boy long ago. Naruto couldn\u2019t have his father yet, but he could have his mother.\nIt made a world of difference to the small boy. \n.--.\n\u201cARGH! FUCK YOU SASUKE!\u201d Sakura screamed, her angered shout echoing across the water.\nNaruto tripped over his own feet gaping at her outburst and even Sasuke let his kunai drop through numb fingers in surprise.\n\u201cYou shithead!\u201d Sakura howled, slugging him across the face.\nSasuke fell back into the waves that lapped at the shore surprise making him freeze up.\n\u201cMah mah, Sakura, such cute little genin shouldn\u2019t swear like that,\u201d Kakashi said.\nWhat came out of Sakura\u2019s mouth was far too filthy to repeat and Kakashi quickly covered Naruto\u2019s ears hoping the water would block Sasuke\u2019s. When Sakura finally cut off panting, she was starting to look less angry and more teary.\n\u201cWhat has you so upset?\u201d Kakashi asked as gently as he could.\n\u201cHe,\u201d she swung an accusing finger at Sasuke, \u201cKeeps pulling my hair!\u201d\nWell. Yes, he had seen that happen a few times in spars. The thing about Sasuke that made him unlike his two teammates was he didn\u2019t hesitate to fight dirty. While Kakashi knew Sakura and Naruto had it in them, they didn\u2019t use any dirty tricks in team spars despite Kakashi having told them such things were quite helpful. Naruto had this idea of fairness and Sakura had been raised by civilians who usually tainted shinobi stories with things like honor. Sasuke though, had been raised by ninja. He had also seen his whole family massacred before him and things like that could seriously destroy any idea of honor. So Sasuke didn\u2019t even seem to consider it fighting dirty, it was just fighting. \nAnd Sakura\u2019s long hair was such a tempting thing to get a grip on and yank in the middle of a spar. \n\u201cTch, it\u2019s an easy tactic,\u201d Sasuke said, wiping water and sand from his face as he stood up.\n\u201cIt hurts!\u201d Sakura shouted back at him, sniffling.\n\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t such a girl,\u201d Sasuke sneered. \nNaruto \u2018meeped\u2019 sensing the danger rising at that comment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a girl?!\u201d Sakura demanded.\n\u201c\u2026Nothing,\u201d Sasuke admitted with a growl, \u201cExcept you spend so much time on your stupid hair when you could be learning to fight better.\u201d\n\u201cStupid?!\u201d Sakura asked, voice shrill, \u201cFuck you! My hair isn\u2019t stupid!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a liability,\u201d Sasuke sniffed.\n\u201cA liability!?\u201d\nKakashi was wondering if he was going to have to get between them before Sakura throttled Sasuke. The possibility grew as Sakura whipped a kunai out. \nAnd then she grabbed a fist of hair and started hacking.\n\u201cFuck you Sasuke! And fuck \u2018a liability\u2019!\u201d she yelled, as she slashed at her hair, the boys gaping at her, \u201cI am not a liability.\u201d\nSakura hew off the last large chunk and threw it on the ground at Sasuke\u2019s feet, panting and red faced. Sasuke gaped at her, full open mouth and wide eyes. \nThen Sakura burst into tears.\n\u201cOkay, you boys go take a break,\u201d Kakashi said, quickly shooing the two boys away to do damage control. \nThey left quickly, still unsure of how to treat emotional girls. Kakashi crouched in front of Sakura, tugging her hands away from her face as she sobbed nosily.\n\u201cMah, that was a bit dramatic,\u201d he smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m stupid,\u201d Sakura sobbed looking at him through teary eyes and a red face and a snotty nose.\nHe sometimes forgot how young these kids were, but looking at her like this he was reminded they were indeed children.\n\u201cSasuke was right, I\u2019m a liability. I\u2019m stupid and a crybaby,\u201d she choked out trying to tug away as she looked at her feet and the pink strands littering the ground.\n\u201cNe, Sakura, look at me.\u201d\nSakura did so slowly.\n\u201cCrying is not a bad thing. You are allowed to cry,\u201d he told her softly, \u201cEmotions are not a weakness. And you\u2019re very far from stupid. In this situation I would argue that Sasuke is the stupid one for upsetting you so. Boys should know making girls cry is just rude.\u201d\nShe gave a half choked watery laugh.\n\u201cNow. I feel like this was a while in coming. Why do you feel like a liability?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I cant keep up with the boys,\u201d she sniffled, \u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying really hard and they just\u2026they just do everything so much better! I can\u2019t win any spars against them and I can\u2019t do as many ninjutsu and my taijutsu is sloppy and\u2026and...\u201d\n\u201cShh. Take a deep breath,\u201d he soothed rubbing circles on the top of her hands with his thumbs, \u201cSakura, Sasuke and Naruto are both powerhouses in their own right. Most of the genin would have trouble keeping up with them. There is no shame in not being better than someone. You are doing fantastic. Neither boy has your control with chakra or your skill with genjutsu. Even your sealing is solid. And neither can ever hope to beat you in knowledge.\u201d\nShe had stopped crying so hard during his talk and was mostly just sniffling now looking at him so heartfelt he wanted to give her a hug.\n\u201cSakura, you are a very good genin,\u201d he said honestly, \u201cand you shouldn\u2019t ever feel as if you are lesser just because someone is better. You are working really hard and I am very, very proud of you.\u201d\nShe surprised him by throwing her arms around his neck, hugging him tightly.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered in his ear.\n\u201cMah, you\u2019re all my cute little students and I\u2019m very happy to help. Talk to me if you ever feel this way again okay? Don\u2019t bottle it up. I know what it\u2019s like to do that and it never ends well.\u201d\nShe nodded against his neck and he pat her back a tad awkwardly.\n\u201cNow, why did you chop off your hair? Was that just a spur of the moment, anger driven action?\u201d\n\u201cI was getting so annoyed,\u201d she admitted, \u201cHe kept pulling at it in spars and it did hurt. Plus it kept getting caught in the trees and bushes. And it gets dirty so easy when it\u2019s long. I like it long but it was getting really annoying.\u201d\nThat was probably partly his fault. He had admittedly wanted to press on her that looking perfect everyday was not reality for a ninja. So he had not allowed her to spend too long on it and made sure to aim her at mud puddles and Naruto\u2019s smoke bombs when they spared. But he had expected her to put it up, braid it, or wrap it, not chop it off.\n\u201cWould you like a hand evening it out?\u201d Kakashi asked carefully as he ran a hand through the choppy uneven length.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said pulling back from the hug to wipe her nose, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, I got snot on you again.\u201d\n\u201cMah, it won\u2019t kill me,\u201d he smiled at her embarrassed face. \nThen he made her turn around as he took out a kunai and tried his best to even out the mess she had made of her hair. In the end it was very short in the back only an inch at most. The sides were a tad more salvageable and he let them taper past her chin. \nWhen they wandered back into camp the boys were trying to look busy. Kakashi knew they had eavesdropped on the whole conversation. \n\u201cWow! Sakura your hair looks great!\u201d Naruto said immediately and with great enthusiasm. \nSince it was Naruto it sounded 100% sincere as well and Sakura\u2019s shoulders relaxed just the slightest as she offered him a small smile. Then Sasuke stepped forwards and her shoulders hunched up again, defensive.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sasuke blurted out, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to insult you. You\u2026you are getting very skilled.\u201d\nShe stared at him as if trying to divine if this was the truth.\n\u201cAnd, I like your hair like this,\u201d He finally said, mumbling.\nShe beamed at him.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she smiled. \nKakashi nodded to himself. All was well.\n.--.\n\u201cOkay kiddies, I have a treat for you,\u201d Kakashi announced interrupting the three-way spar on top of the ocean waves.\nThey ignored him, exchanging blows and dodging around him as if he wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cMy cute little students, ignoring me!\u201d Kakashi said, put his face in his hands as if he were crying.\n\u201cYour surprises are usually painful,\u201d Sakura said shortly, throwing Naruto over her shoulder straight into Sasuke. \n\u201cYeah! They suck!\u201d Naruto yelled, as Sasuke braced and let Naruto use his back as a springboard so he could fly right back at Sakura.\n\u201cNo trust!\u201d Kakashi sniffled, \u201cFine, no weapons for you then.\u201d\n\u201cWeapons?\u201d Sakura perked up right before Naruto drop kicked her into the water. \nSasuke turned to focus on him with a sharp keen gaze. Only for Sakura to tug him under the waves as well.\n\u201cLike some badass sword?!\u201d Naruto demanded right before his teammates came at him from two different sides, bursting from the water. \nHe waited till they finished their spar, pulling themselves onto the beach, squabbling. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough to teach you about any weapon enough to be a master, but I\u2019ve copied a lot of basics,\u201d Kakashi said when they finally sat at his feet looking eager, \u201cAnd at least one weapon is always a good thing to know. Can anyone tell me why?\u201d\nSakura\u2019s hand shot in the air.\n\u201cIt gives us reach,\u201d she said eagerly, \u201cLike if they have a contact poison or lean towards poison weapons its best to keep out of their reach. A sword or something would keep hands away from you.\u201d\n\u201cGood, any other reasons?\u201d\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t use chakra,\u201d Sasuke said, \u201cIt\u2019s an extra edge over just fists and feet.\u201d\n\u201cIt also looks badass!\u201d Naruto cheered. \n\u201cNow, this is going to be a personal choice,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBut let\u2019s go over some weapons and their history and advantages first. Starting with the tanto.\u201d\nEven Naruto listened as Kakashi gave them a lecture on a wide variety of \u2018classic\u2019 weapons from swords to fuma shuriken to specialty knives and on; what pros and cons he knew about them. Finally, he pulled out a sealing scroll he had brought along just for this purpose. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been on a lot of missions,\u201d Kakashi prefaced, \u201cand it\u2019s such a waste to leave good weapons behind. But I\u2019m too lazy to go get them evaluated and sold every time, so I stock-pile. You kids are lucky I haven\u2019t been by to sell them for a few years.\u201d\nWhat he released from the scroll was a veritable mountain of weapons. Naruto practically had hearts in his eyes and Sasuke\u2019s gaze was very evaluating. Even Sakura looked interested. \n\u201cDon\u2019t cut yourselves, but swing some around,\u201d Kakashi encouraged. \nThey did so eagerly, and he made sure to keep a close eye on them to make sure no one was hurt. He watched closely to see what happened to settle in their hands the easiest.\n\u201cAno, Kakashi-sensei,\u201d Sakura was the first to stop exploring, \u201cI think\u2026I think I would like to learn how to use this one.\u201d\nHe looked at her unconventional choice and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \n\u201cThat could be very deadly in the right hands,\u201d he told her cheerfully, \u201cSo we better make sure those are your hands.\u201d\nShe smiled up at him and gave the long war hammer a spin. It was just a plain one that was a tad aged, but it would do until she was beyond the basics. Kakashi ran through his head trying to remember in anyone in Konoha knew how to use them. He couldn\u2019t actually think of anyone at the moment. He wondered if it spoke of her character that she had picked a war hammer. Not a blade, but a bludgeoning weapon. She would crush, not cut. She would grind her enemies underneath her. \n\u201cKakashi!\u201d Naruto yelled next, pumping a fist as he grinned at his choice. \n\u201cInteresting choice,\u201d Kakashi chuckled.\nNaruto spun the sickle and chain and nearly cut his nose off but Kakashi thought he would do well with it. It would give him reach and would work well with his wind affinity. It also wasn\u2019t cumbersome and could be used for capture which was more Naruto\u2019s style. Sasuke was the last, looking over a few weapons more closely than the rest.\n\u201cAh, a Naginata or a Sasumata,\u201d Kakashi hummed as the boy looked at both very carefully, \u201cBoth would be good. They give you range. The Sasumata would be good to pin opponents down to do close range jutsu or genjutsu. The Naginata would be a good one to make them keep their distance.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026My mother knew how to wield the Sasumata,\u201d Sasuke finally offered, quiet.\n\u201cI imagine she was very good at it,\u201d Kakashi said easily, \u201cDo you want to follow her?\u201d\nSasuke didn\u2019t answer verbally, but he picked the Sasumata and nodded once. \n\u201cGood choices,\u201d Kakashi smiled at all three of them, \u201cBut before we get into the particulars of those personal choices, we are going to go over some weapons you are all going to carry.\u201d\nKakashi dug through the pile to lay out a set of weapons before them.\n\u201cThe Fukiya,\u201d Kakashi said picking up the tube, \u201cIs very useful. I\u2019m sure with Sakura\u2019s growing herb knowledge we can start working on paralytics and poisons. They are a silent weapon that only really takes aims and strong lungs. They may be useful in a pinch and well worth carrying.\u201d\nHe let the kids peer at the ones he put before them before picking up the next item. \n\u201cDo any of you recognize these? They are not as popular these days.\u201d\n\u201cAre they knuckle dusters?\u201d Naruto asked, peering at the ring with a spike on it.\n\u201cNope. They\u2019re karute,\u201d Kakashi said, slipping one on, \u201cThey\u2019re actually worn with the spike hidden in your palm.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Sakura asked, frowned.\nKakashi waved her up and when she stood in front of him her made a grabbing motion.\n\u201cSee where that would end up?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Sakura said in surprise, \u201cIt would puncture my skin or at least tangle in my clothes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s to help with your grip,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cNaruto, you would suit these well with your brawler style.\u201d\nNaruto already had one on every finger. Kakashi rolled his eyes and picked up the next item. \n\u201cHere are the knuckle dusters. They are useful to add some more damage to your hits,\u201d Kakashi told them, \u201cAnd they can be used to deflect weapons as well. But you have to be very precise and sure in that instance since it isn\u2019t a large surface. Sasuke, with your precise style they could be an advantage.\u201d\nSasuke looked at them closely, turning them over in his hands.\n\u201cNow, onto some less conventional weapons. I don\u2019t actually have any for you. These are from my own collection,\u201d Kakashi said holding up the first one, \u201cThis is a tessen, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of them. Careful, it\u2019s very sharp.\u201d\nHe passed the small folding fan about and they each peered at it.\n\u201cThe Tessen is reinforced with steel spines. Generally people use them to bludgeon. They are also sharp as a kunai though, and can slice in an emergency. They can also be invaluable for wind jutsu, helping give a bit of a kick to an attack.\u201d\nNaruto perked up at the element he had the most luck with. Kakashi hadn\u2019t tested them yet, but Naruto was most likely wind element. \n\u201cAnd here is a weapon you will rarely see these days. This was my grandfathers.\u201d\nKakashi held up the long thin pipe almost two feet in length.\n\u201cIt\u2019s made of steel and fully functional as an actual pipe, but getting hit by one of these in the head can crack a skull.\u201d\nSakura gave a whistle of appreciation at that.\n\u201cYou can also sharpen the end,\u201d Kakashi said motioning to where it would be placed in your lips, \u201cMy grandfather killed a man by shoving it through his eye. Said the next smoke was even better.\u201d\nThey all wrinkled their noses and Kakashi chuckled at them. \n\u201cAnd while I don\u2019t know how to do it myself, my grandfather used his with his fire element. He could create a smoke thicker than a smoke bomb with it.\u201d\nNow Sasuke looked a tad more interested.\n\u201cAnd I know a decent number of his friends who claimed he smoked some poisonous mixtures that would create poisonous haze that was deadly in enclosed areas.\u201d\nNow Sakura perked up. Kakashi had been starting to teacher her less of the medical side of plants and more what he knew about the deadly side.\n\u201cThese two are very useful weapons in discreet situations,\u201d Kakashi said, folding the fan ad pipe away, \u201cAnd here is the last weapon I\u2019m definitely going to train you on.\u201d\nThey stared as he pulled out a long bow.\n\u201cAny guesses why?\u201d Kakashi asked as they stayed silent.\n\u201cFor long distance,\u201d Sakura said immediately. \n\u201cYes. But why? Why not just kunai?\u201d\n\u201cArrows can go farther and keep more force,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cEspecially out of a bow that size.\u201d\n\u201cWe could stay out of sensing rang and snipe people,\u201d Sasuke said, eyes narrowed in thought. \n\u201cAnd disappear before they even realize where we are!\u201d Naruto grinned. \n\u201cAnd if, you say, wrapped an explosive seal around an arrow?\u201d Kakashi asked off handedly.\nNaruto\u2019s grin was unholy.\n.--.\nWhen they had all mastered the seal to store items, Kakashi let them have the evening off. Not that there was much to do alone in the woods though, so they ended up sitting around the fire anyways, asking Kakashi questions about their lessons or anything they could think of. \n\u201cDo you have any hobbies other than porn?\u201d Sakura asked, partly exasperated as Kakashi talked to them over top of Icha Icha.\nHe wanted to giggle and tell her they had it good. He had actually set the book down most days to help them out. \n\u201cI have some hobbies,\u201d he drawled in a tone he knew pissed them off. \n\u201cLike what?\u201d Naruto badgered, \u201cBeing lame?\u201d\nSasuke gave Kakashi a flat, unblinking, stare that was actually a tad unnerving.\n\u201cI rescue puppies,\u201d Kakashi said aloud.\nWhich wasn\u2019t even really a lie, hilariously enough. They gave him suspicious looks and he smiled innocently at them.\n\u201cAnd I do challenges with my eternal rival. A man who wears green spandex and has a bowl cut.\u201d\nNow they were just looking disbelieving. \n\u201cI also play the shamisen.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I call bullshit,\u201d Sakura declared, \u201cNone of that can be true.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe the puppies,\u201d Naruto chimed in, \u201cI mean, Kakashi-sensei isn\u2019t heartless.\u201d\n\u201cMah, no trust,\u201d Kakashi said mournfully, \u201cIt\u2019s all the truth.\u201d\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Sakura said triumphantly.\nOh he was going to have fun the day they met Gai. And his talking ninken. But that was not this day. So Kakashi pulled out a scroll he rarely used and had only brought last minute. It was a small thing, only the size of two of his fingers and tucked away carefully. In a puff of smoke Kakashi had a shamisen on his lap.\nHis students blinked in surprise and all looked up at him incredulous.\nKakashi idly tuned the instrument under said incredulous gazes. At the first note they started to lose the surprise and shifted closer, curious. In the still night Kakashi grabbed the bachi and drew a sharp note out of the instrument that had belonged to his mother before she had died giving birth to Kakashi. \nKakashi had learned when he was young and though learning her favorite instrument would be a way to get closer to her. He had a bad habit of picking up the habits of the dead (Obito\u2019s excuses, Rin\u2019s overstocked medical supplies, his mother\u2019s shamisen). So the kids listened as he played them a song he had never heard his mother play but what his father had told him was her favorite.\n\u201cYou\u2019re really good Kakashi-sensei,\u201d Naruto said as the last note faded away. \n\u201cMah, your old sensei isn\u2019t that good,\u201d he said as he looked at the three young faces.\n\u201cNo, you are,\u201d Sakura insisted, \u201cMy mother plays the shamisen as well and you sound just as good as her.\u201d\n\u201cWell thank you,\u201d he smiled, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that many songs. Can you play the shamisen as well then Sakura?\u201d\nShe flushed as all the boys looked at her.\n\u201cA few songs. I\u2019m not good though.\u201d\nKakashi held out the shamisen and she dithered for a moment before she took it and strummed out an easy tune that most beginners started with.\n\u201cWow Sakura! You\u2019re good!\u201d Naruto cheered, ever the ball of enthusiasm.\n\u201cCan you play anything?\u201d Sakura asked the blond.\nKakashi winced knowing that would be a no. Naruto drew back, fumbling, and Kakashi gave him a soft look over Sakura\u2019s head. There was nothing to be ashamed about being an orphan, nor with being hated for something not of your own fault.\n\u201cI can play the koto,\u201d Sasuke announced as Naruto fumbled, \u201cNot very well but my mother was teaching me before-\u201d\nHe cut off and the circle fell in an uncomfortable silence as Sakura looked up at Kakashi desperately, unsure of what to say to the two glum boys. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to know how to a play an instrument,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cA good hobby and good for the mind. When we get back to Konoha I will see if I can find anyone to help you more with the Koto. And I can show you a bit more Sakura. What about you Naruto, would you like to learn to play something.\u201d\nNaruto looked surprised at the offer.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, almost shyly as everyone looked at him. \nKakashi smiled at them all.\n.--.\n\u201cMy cute little students! I have a surprise for you!\u201d\nThey all peered at him suspiciously.\n\u201cWell, I suppose your last surprise was pretty good,\u201d Sakura allowed. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll trust you this time, Kakashi-sensei,\u201d Naruto declared.\n\u201cNh.\u201d\nKakashi sighed dramatically. \n\u201cMah, maybe I won\u2019t tell you the surprise if you will be such downers all the time.\u201d\nThey gave him identical flat looks and he couldn\u2019t resist. He reached out and ruffled their hair, switching when they batted at his hands until he had thoroughly messed up all their hair.\n\u201cThe capital of Tea Country is a half a day\u2019s journey from here if we move quickly. I was thinking you might all like to go have a look.\u201d\nThey perked up and nodded eagerly.\n\u201cMah, we\u2019ll treat it as an infiltration mission. Sakura, you\u2019re in charge of our cover and disguises. Naruto and Sasuke, you work on contingency plans in case anything goes wrong.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Naruto wrinkled his nose.\n\u201cAnything. We will leave tomorrow morning so you all have the rest of the day to plan. Chop chop.\u201d\nNaruto and Sasuke descended on their supply of scrolls tucked in a bin by the tents while Sakura flopped down on her log, brow furrowing in thought. \nBeyond their shelter the rain was still pouring as it had been for the past day. Monsoon season was soon. It would build character to make them work in the torrential downpour. \n.--.\n\u201cOkay, so, Kakashi-sensei is our Master,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cOr, well, yours. He\u2019s a trapper and you two are his apprentices. I\u2019m his daughter.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you have to be his daughter?\u201d Naruto wrinkled his nose.\n\u201cCause we\u2019re going among civilians,\u201d Sakura said patiently. \n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cCivilians have strict gender roles,\u201d Sasuke rolled his eyes.\n\u201cGender roles?\u201d Naruto questioned, confused. \n\u201cIt means they think girls can only do certain jobs,\u201d Kakashi chipped in, \u201cAnd that they are unsuitable to do a lot of skilled jobs.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s stupid,\u201d Naruto said flatly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s civilians,\u201d Sakura sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I became a ninja. It\u2019s a bit better in ninja villages with ninja politics being so prevalent, but I still would have been married off an expected only to be a housewife if I had not become a shinobi. I could have helped run my husband\u2019s business or such, but I wouldn\u2019t be expected to work outside the home much, especially not in labor jobs.\u201d\nNaruto gaped at her, and even Sasuke raised a brow.\n\u201cBut, but girls are just as good as guys,\u201d Naruto protested, \u201cAnd you\u2019re strong! I mean, you can hit harder than I can!\u201d\nSakura flushed, pleased and embarrassed. Kakashi nodded sagely behind Naruto. Their cute little pink teammate could hit really hard. Kakashi had been surprised at first before he realized she had been continuously focusing chakra to her limbs with her near perfect control. A few months of that started to naturally augment muscles and strength. Sakura must have been doing it instinctively for years because even without the use of chakra she could pack a punch. \n\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m a trapper, and you two are my cute little students!\u201d he said, ruffling the boys\u2019 hair, \u201cThat means hidden weapons and civilian clothes.\u201d\nThey grumbled but obeyed. Instead of trying to find clothes that would blend in, and which they didn\u2019t have, the used small henge. It wasn\u2019t ideal for ninja places, but in the capital of Tea Country, it was fine. Sakura did the same but used a small genjutsu so it looked like she was wearing a worn yukata. \n\u201cOkay, all ready?\u201d Kakashi double checked.\n\u201cYes!\u201d The chorused.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d he said cheerfully.\nThey ducked out of the trees onto the dirt road and started too head in the direction of the town that was close to four hours from where they had slipped from the woods. It would be a bit of a ways to jog but his kids seemed to enjoy the journey as the bound along the road. It had finally stopped raining and the kids jumped over the puddles happy to be out and about and dry, even if it was only six in the morning.\n.--.\nThe capital of Tea country was surrounded by a simple wooden wall with guard towers that was more than good enough for simple bandits and wildlife but would never work against ninja. Since they brought no goods to declare they passed by the guards with simple nods. He students looked around with curiosity and excitement, none having been anywhere other than Konoha. \n\u201cOkay, I take it when I told you to pack back in Konoha you all packed cash?\u201d\nThey all nodded.\n\u201cGood. Cash is always a good emergency item. If you ever lose supplies or need to blend in, cash is a must. You may, of course, spend some today.\u201d\nThey nodded eagerly.\n\u201cEvery two hours we meet back here, on the hour, to check in, okay?\u201d he said, looking at them seriously. \nThey nodded again.\n\u201cGood. And Sakura, unless you henge to look like a man, it isn\u2019t smart for young civilian girls to wander around. I trust you to look after yourself but it draws questions. Think of this as a test. No one should ever suspect you are ninja.\u201d\nThey all nodded solemnly, but when he gave a dismissive wave they all took off with wide grins. He was happy to see they all stuck together despite the fact he had given them permission to split up. He could have insisted on staying together, but to be honest, the kids did need a break. He had a disguised clone following them just to be careful anyways. It probably wasn\u2019t need, but they were only genin and they weren\u2019t in Konoha and that meant supervision. \nKakashi himself headed off with a few destinations in mind.\n.--.\n\u201cSensei, you gotta try this!\u201d Naruto greeted him at one of the check-ins, holding up a stick with some sort of cheese meat thing on it.\nSo Kakashi did what no one in Konoha could ever say they had seen him do. He tugged his mask down and took a bite. None of his students batted an eye at his face, simply waiting for his opinion on the food. \nKakashi wanted to grin at them again. He had considered it for a long time when he first took them as students, when he had first started to treat them as real students, when he had first realized this was going to be his team. And Kakashi had decided that if he was going to put the time, effort, trust (love), into this team, it had to start with him as well. \nThey didn\u2019t even understand how absolutely crazy it was to see his face. He had not made a big deal of it and they had not asked about the mask. He took it off to eat, to drink, to simply wring it out when it got wet. They thought it was normal to see his face. \nHe couldn\u2019t wait till they realized what a rarity seeing his face. He couldn\u2019t wait till the rest of Konoha realized they had seen his face. Kakashi had been keeping hidden for a very long time and could count on one hand the number of people in Konoha who had seen his face.\nHe looked at their curious faces, waiting for approval of the food and having no idea the show of trust (and love) he was giving them. \n\u201cVery good,\u201d he approved, \u201cHave you been being good?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Sakura and Naruto chorused.\n\u201cI got some souvenirs for my parents,\u201d Sakura added, \u201cTea of course.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I got some for Jiji and Iruka!\u201d Naruto cheered.\n\u201cWe also found some beautiful yukata,\u201d Sakura sighed, \u201cBut they were too much.\u201d\n\u201cAnd of course food!\u201d Naruto grinned.\n\u201cGood good, and how have you been enjoying it Sasuke?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow at the most quiet member.\n\u201c\u2026It has been fine,\u201d Sasuke said, looking away.\nHe smiled at his more sullen student but could see he was enjoying it as well. \n\u201cHow about you Kakashi-sensei?\u201d Sakura, the ever thoughtful one prodded.\n\u201cMah, I\u2019ve been enjoying it. Now, go off and explore a bit longer. Next time we meet up we have a few things to do and then we are leaving.\u201d\nThey nodded and took off again, Naruto bee-lining for a food stand.\n.--.\nKakashi had indeed kept himself busy as his team ran around the town. His first stop had been a geisha house to talk to the matron. He had revealed himself to be a ninja for said purpose because she would never have come to talk to a regular trapper. It took some quick haggling and a great deal of charm to buy a few older training instruments that her maiko used. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but it would be the only place to get them on short notice. Then he convinced her to let him copy some of the girls playing. That took a bit more money but she was interested enough to see how he would do it that she allowed it.\nThe hushed gasps and whispered when he uncovered the spinning sharingan were normal. The girls were a tad nervous but a few braver ones played for him as he focused on their hands. Kakashi made sure to thank the matron and the girls before vanishing in a swirl of smoke and leaves just to impress the girls peering around the doorways to watch.\nHis next stop was at a black smith with his cute little students weapons in hand. Since they were weapons he had gotten off his dead enemies, he wanted to make sure they would truly stand up in combat. The blacksmith declared the Sasumata to be in good shape and made of very decent craftsmanship. He declared the same of the sickle and chain but said the hammer would was poor quality and would not last well in a heated battle. \nSo Kakashi made a note to order a better hammer for Sakura. The weapons shop in Konoha that supplied more unique and varied weapons would most likely have one in a dusty corner. He\u2019d send a message with a ninken asking to have one sealed and sent his way soon. \nThen Kakashi went to a few bars, hopping from one to another just long enough to pick up on gossip. None of it was very important at the moment except some rumors about bandits near the border, but you never knew. And civilians could be canny. They tended to gossip more than a shinobi because no one threatened them with death for it. \nThen he went to meet with his students again.\n.--.\n\u201cOkay, first thing we need to do before we can head home, is supplies,\u201d Kakashi clapped his hands together, \u201cSpecifically thing\u2019s that last like Rice. Remember, the scrolls will slow down things like rot but won\u2019t stop it completely. Same with things going stale. So try to pick longer-lasting items. Since you can all do sealing scrolls decently we can carry more as well. And what is a saying about being over prepared?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing if you can carry it all!\u201d they chorused with rolled eyes.\n\u201cGood!\u201d he beamed at them, \u201cSo let\u2019s go get supplies.\u201d\nHe made them take turns haggling as they went between vendors. Sakura proved to be the best at this, though she admitted her parents took her shopping and had her do the same sometimes, especially with supply vendors for their shop. Naruto was decent at it as well as he was just so cheerful and friendly everyone seemed to like him. Though he could be taken in with a sucker story since he tended to be a tad gullible and too kind. \nSasuke was the worst of the three for the simple reason you had to talk and say more than one sentence which he seemed to struggle with. It had Kakashi wondering how often Sasuke had actually talked to be people or been able to hold one on one conversations outside of the classroom. If Sasuke had been isolated aside from class it would explain a great deal. \nThey stocked up on rice, beans, jerky, and other such more preserved foods, Kakashi lecturing his students on proper nutrition. He had already given them such talks of course over the last few weeks. Sakura had needed it because after having a stable camp she had tried to fall back on dieting again, but he had dissuaded her of that notion after a few exhausting harsh physical days that showed she needed more stamina.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Kakashi said when they had had everything sealed away in a discreet alley, \u201cWhat else could we possible need?\u201d\n\u201cClothes,\u201d Sakura said immediately, \u201cI mean, most of ours is pretty\u2026damaged.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t lying. He had pushed them and pushed them hard. And clothes didn\u2019t stand up that well sometimes, even shinobi clothes. Naruto and Sasuke being boys had not thought too much on clothes and has only brought a few outfits each. Even though Sakura had brought more it had also suffered. Kakashi had been extra vicious towards the clothing he deemed ridiculous. Naruto\u2019s orange jumpsuit only lived because he had given up and sealed it away. All Sakura\u2019s flimsy red dresses had been shredded trough training. Even Sasuke\u2019s pristine white shorts were no longer white. When they were powerful ninja who didn\u2019t have to give a fuck about being discreet they could wear what they wanted, until then they needed every advantage.\nOf course they all knew how to do basic mending but things never looked good after you had to patch up a hole bigger than your hand. So every outfit was looking a tad hole-y. They had outfits and weren\u2019t going to freeze or be exposed to too many elements, but they did look a little rough. Almost like they had been training in the woods for weeks. \n\u201cFair enough. We\u2019ll find a place.\u201d\nAnd they did find a place that was geared more towards travelers with thicker more durable clothing. Since none of his students planned to wear it forever, most likely aiming to get more shinobi clothing, they mostly picked things out that would make them look a little less like feral children. \nAll three bought dark trousers that were a tad too loose for ninja, but would do for now. Then Naruto and Sasuke bought dark shirts, in green and blue respectively. Sakura went for a tad nicer looking short kimono top that was made of thick woody-red material and held shut with a thick black obi. Their travel cloaks (also looking very warn in now) could go over top. To top it off they bought some extra material, whispering about how to cut it into strips to use to die down loose pant legs and sleeves.\nKakashi was proud of them as they strode out of the capital restocked and relaxed in early afternoon. They set off at a light jog once out of sight and his students looked even more relaxed and cheerful after a day of fun. Only two hours into their jog Sasuke fell back from where he had been scouting ahead to mention a group of wagons ahead of them. \nAs a group they slowed, setting their pace closer to a civilians and henging backpacks onto their shoulders. Unencumbered by a group or wagons, they made a show at catching up to the wagons. \n\u201cHo, you folks heading towards Fire Country?\u201d a man asked when they caught up to the small group of merchants\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Kakashi answered idly, \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cWe are. You would perhaps be better to stick with us though folks,\u201d his partner said, \u201cThere have been rumors of bandits on this road recently. Larger groups tend to be unscathed.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Kakashi agreed, having heard such rumors from the bars as well, \u201cI\u2019m Hataka. This is my Daughter Hiromi, and my apprentices Kimako and Nagao.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meetcha,\u201d the first one one grinned from his seat, \u201cI\u2019m Higashi and this is Rei. If the little miss wants she can hop up on the wagon with us.\u201d\nSakura gave a shy smile and let Kakashi lift her up into the back of the wagon filled with bags of what looked like tea. Kakashi watched them all carefully as Naruto quickly grew bored of the slow pace and dragged Sasuke into running ahead a bit to poke at puddles and bugs. Sakura chatted happily with the two men when they asked questions, her background from a shop-keeper civilian family helping her out. \nKakashi watched his students fondly as they took the time to act like the kids they were even as they seamlessly blended in with the civilians.\nIt was not a surprise when they ran into bandits almost an hour later as the hour grew later, dusk on the horizon. Kakashi had been expecting it really since he had heard of the rumors in the pub. He had even been going to lead his students to root them out but this had worked out better.\n\u201cGive us all your valuables!\u201d the leader menaced, sword drawn as the rest of the group surrounded the set of wagons and travelers that had made up this small group, \u201cAnd leave the women as well!\u201d\nKakashi eyed them, surprised they had even attempted to rob a group as large as this one. A few merchants had swords as well, but looked wary of drawing them with how surrounded they were.\n\u201cOoh! Dibs on this one boss!\u201d one bandit laughed, grabbing Sakura\u2019s arm and yanking her off the wagon bench, \u201cLook at her coloring!\u201d\nKakashi didn\u2019t even have to say go. Sakura had lashed out as soon as she was pulled free of the wagon, a kunai going for the man\u2019s throat in an instinctive slash. Naruto and Sasuke hadn\u2019t hesitated a moment seeing their teammate in danger. Sasuke came in low from the left going for the legs while Naruto went high, aiming a kick at the man\u2019s head.\nHe was dead before he hit the ground and it was hard to tell if it was the slashed throat, the broken skull, or the deep cuts through his femoral arteries that nearly separated his legs from his body.\nFor a moment silence rang out as he students stared at the first man they had killed. Then they looked up at the rest of the frozen bandits.\n\u201cWell, go get them,\u201d Kakashi smiled, waving at the surrounding men.\nThe bandits tried to flee realizing they were ninja, but his cute little students were cute little monsters. Only two more bandits died, one when Sakura underestimated her strength and ruptured a man\u2019s stomach, the other when Sasuke aimed for a man\u2019s chest and cut right through his throat when he fell forwards unexpectedly. Naruto had used considerably more restraint and the rest were knocked out and bound. \nKakashi waved the civilians off mid battle and though they were grateful for the save, they were also grateful to get away. One left Kakashi and his students a bag of mochi as a thank you and the wagon drivers had left them some very high-quality tea before they were gone.\n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi smiled at his students as he looked them over, \u201cYou were all very calm and collected and reacted accordingly. I\u2019m very proud of how you helped your teammate with no hesitation.\u201d\nThey nodded faintly, all looking a tad green about the gills.\n\u201cLet\u2019s head back to camp. We\u2019ll go over it later.\u201d\nThey would also need to talk about their first kill and would probably need some reassuring words. So Kakashi sent them ahead and then dealt with rest of the bandits. There was no point in trying to haul them back to the city. \nThat night they talked softly around the fire and drank rich matcha tea with mochi.\n.--.\nOf all of them, it was Naruto who took the first kill the hardest. Sasuke had already seen death dealt so often that while he had been initially surprised, he was over it. Well, not over it, but he had long since been broken and one kill wasn\u2019t going to change that. Sakura on the other hand had been more shocked at how easy it had been than the fact she had killed someone. \nNaruto though, well Naruto put a lot of stock in life. Kakashi could tell Naruto would be one of those people who always despised killing. It just sat wrong on his shoulders and his mind. \nSo Kakashi fought off Naruto\u2019s gloom by running him into the ground and physically exhausting him. Then, when they were all beaten and tired he pulled out the new instruments he had bought. \n\u201cPractice ones,\u201d he said as Sasuke ran his hands over the old worn koto and Naruto spun the bamboo flute around, \u201cYou probably have your mother\u2019s koto tucked away, but I thought you may like one to practice on with no fear.\u201d\nSasuke dipped his head in the barest show of gratitude, eyes lingering on the strings as if he saw ghosts. \n\u201cNow, I said it the other night; Music is a good thing for you to learn. It will never be a waste of your time,\u201d he said smiling, \u201cUse it to release emotion and stuff. Kind of like free art therapy.\u201d\nThey gave him raised brows and incredulous looks at that delivery but they all looked over their instruments. \n\u201cShow us what you can do Sasuke.\u201d\nAnd so Sasuke slid on the finger picks and plucked hesitantly at the strings as if trying to dredge up old memories of how to play. It was a simple tune and Kakashi could tell he had missed a few notes. But he was past the very beginner level at least and knew his strings. \nKakashi tuned it by ear and showed Sasuke the first song he had learned from the maiko. Leaving Sasuke to fumble over his strings he glanced at Sakura but she was doing her own thing with his shamisen. Then he turned to Naruto who was going red in the face trying to make the flute make sound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tad tricky,\u201d Kakashi agreed.\nNaruto pouted and tried again to no avail. So Kakashi pulled his mask down and tried. He showed Naruto a few notes and then backed off, watching with amusement as it took ten minutes for Naruto to make even a single note.\nHe had been serious though when he said music was free art therapy. Plus, perhaps it would teach them some more patience.\n.--.\n\u201cLike this,\u201d Kakashi corrected, straightening Sakura\u2019s arms.\nSakura shifted but didn\u2019t look away from her target.\n\u201cHere it comes,\u201d Kakashi murmured.\nNaruto was raising holy hell on one end of the woods near them while Sakura and Kakashi sat poised on a small cliff shelf. Sasuke was somewhere behind Naruto helping drive prey towards them. Sakura remained focused on the break in the trees in front of the cliff, patient and still. \nWith a flurry of movement a buck came leaping from the bush, driven away from the boys and their noise. Sakura didn\u2019t even hesitate for a moment, letting the arrow fly.\n\u201cGood aim!\u201d Kakashi praised as the buck dropped instantly.\nSakura beamed and scrambled down the cliff wall with him as Naruto burst from the underbrush.\n\u201cDidja get it!\u201d he yelled.\n\u201cWe got it,\u201d Sakura cheered. \n\u201cYay!\u201d Naruto whooped, \u201cSauske got a bird too!\u201d \nSasuke emerged behind him with a pheasant in a hold and a smirk on his lips.\n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi congratulated them, \u201cNow, let\u2019s go hang the deer. We\u2019ll skin it later and then let it hang overnight before we butcher it. We can catch some fish while we wait and tomorrow after taijutsu practice, I will show you how to smoke it so we can keep it longer.\u201d\nThe kids nodded excitedly. He would send them out for some fungi and tubers tomorrow as well. He was damn well gonna make sure his kids could survive no matter what situation they found themselves in. \n.--.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we had a serious discussion.\u201d\nSasuke looked up at him, startled. Not that Sasuke was an expressive boy but Kakashi could see the flare of his eyes, the way his mouth twitched, the way his fingers made for hand signs. He may not be overly expressive, but he was a twitchy boy when startled. \n\u201cA discussion,\u201d he said flatly, to hide his surprise.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cDo you know why I was picked to be your sensei?\u201d\nSasuke shot a discreet look after the other two who were sparing on the waves again and furrowed his brow.\n\u201cYou are a legendary jonin, an ANBU at one point,\u201d Sasuke said, because they had all seen his fading tattoo, and the walking library that was Sakura had recognized it even if he gave them no conformation, \u201cIf\u2026that man ever decided to come back and finish the job, you would be able to fend him off.\u201d\nKakashi blinked. He had\u2026he had not considered that might be the angle Sasuke was looking at. He had not thought Sasuke still\u2026had a fear of Itachi. Kakashi felt like he had been caught flat-footed. He had not even considered that while Sasuke obviously hated Itachi, he also highly feared him.\n\u201cI could,\u201d Kakashi said with no hesitation.\nAnd it was honest. Oh he might not be able to defeat Itachi for that man was a monster and Kakashi would know having been his ANBU captain (and knowing Itachi would have been further pushed by a criminal lifestyle on the run) but at the very least Kakashi would make sure he never touched a single hair on his student\u2019s head, even if it meant his death. Team Seven above all. \nMaybe a few months ago Kakashi would have been less sure of himself in the face of an S-ranked criminal, but his cute little students weren\u2019t the only ones getting a work out with all this training. Kakashi\u2019s own control and strength had been improving in leaps and bounds with all the activity and clones he used on a daily basis. In fact, he felt like he was back up to par of his glory days as an ANBU captain. \n\u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason,\u201d Kakashi said, pulling from his thoughts.\nDespite the fact that Kakashi had shown them his face, that he peeled his mask back regularly, he had never lifted his headband. He did so now, red sharingan spinning as it opened. With the clarity it revealed, Kakashi could see the moment Sasuke stopped breathing.\n\u201cI got this during the war,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom a friend.\u201d\nSasuke didn\u2019t breathe for a long moment and Kakashi let that sink in, let it sink in that this wasn\u2019t doujutsu theft and had happened long before the slaughter. \n\u201cWho?\u201d Sasuke finally croaked.\n\u201cA cousin of yours, Uchiha Obito,\u201d Kakashi said softly, trying not to let the grief well inside of him, \u201cWe were on a genin team together and he died to save me and our teammate.\u201d\nSasuke swallowed thickly as Kakashi slowly tilted the headband back over his eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m mostly learned it through trial and error since the Uchiha refused to teach me,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cBut when you awaken yours, I can help you.\u201d\nSasuke gave a slight, shaky bow of acknowledgement and turned on his heel. Kakashi watched him run towards Sakura and Naruto, less graceful and more like a child running from something that troubled him. Sasuke collided with the other two, tackling them into the water and Kakashi watched fondly as they all started squabbling and fighting. Kakashi could practically see the tension drain from Sasuke and allowed a small pleased smile as Naruto and Sakura both caught on to it and squabbled louder to distract the boy.\n.--.\nKakashi watched as his students sunk into an easy meditation. He had gotten them into the habit of doing it everyday before lunch. It was a good way to unwind and find themselves, centering their thoughts and bodies. Naruto had had the most trouble at first, but now Kakashi was proud to see he fell into it easily, even upside down from a tree branch. Sakura meanwhile, was amazingly meditating on the open water, the waves bobbing her up and down as she drifted. \nKakashi let his students be and returned to the scroll he was writing on. He had a request of the Hokage and he would need to use all his manners and his rarely used legible handwriting to make sure he got it.\n.--.\nKakashi read the scroll carefully and then glanced at his genin, with a wide smile.\n\u201cOkay kids,\u201d Kakashi yelled out, \u201cStand to attention!\u201d\nThey hesitated only a moment, never having had such a command, but they all also knew the importance of listening to his commands and as such dropped what they were doing to stand, looking at him curiously.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been assigned a mission.\u201d\nAnd there was the excitement as they all looked at him eagerly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our first C-rank,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cWe are going to escort a bridge builder to Wave country and act as a guard while he completes it. Questions?\u201d\n\u201cWho are we guarding it from?\u201d Sakura asked immediately, \u201cNinja?\u201d\n\u201cBandits, which means civilian or low-level ninja, like academy drops outs or genin missing-nin.\u201d\n\u201cDuration?\u201d Sasuke asked.\n\u201cMost likely a month,\u201d Kakashi nodded.\n\u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d Naruto asked, bouncing in place.\n\u201cTwo hours.\u201d\nThey froze.\n\u201cT-two hours?\u201d Sakura stuttered.\n\u201cBetter get packing kids,\u201d Kakashi grinned evilly.\nThey stared at him aghast. And then they were a flurry of activity.\n.--.\n\u201cSensei, don\u2019t genin usually have to do a certain number of D-rank before they can take a C-rank mission?\u201d Sakura asked as they flipped through trees at a steady pace.\n\u201cMah, D-rank are generally meant for trainees and those stuck in the village on downtime since D-rank don\u2019t extend outside of Konoha\u2019s territory, so fresh genin usually get assigned them during training. They also help out with teamwork. But since we have been working outside of Konoha\u2019s walls for a while now I asked for permission to skip D-rank for now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best sensei!\u201d Naruto cheered at that.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so excited,\u201d Kakashi said amused, \u201cBefore you can enter the chunin exams you have to have at least 30 D-rank finished or special permission from the Hokage. So when we return after this mission we will have to get started.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of special permission?\u201d Naruto asked slyly. \nThey all knew he was close with the Hokage but Kakashi knew that the Hokage would trust Kakashi\u2019s opinion on their readiness before Naruto\u2019s needling.\n\u201cThe Hokage is in charge,\u201d Kakashi said dryly, \u201cHe can, in essence do as he pleases, such as allowing students to do things without reaching certain markers of development. But he is also the one who put those markers in in the first place, so he probably won\u2019t let you cute little kids get around them.\u201d\nKakashi didn\u2019t say that the Hokage would if Kakashi asked. When Kakashi had laid out his training plan before the Hokage he had expected at least some resistance. When he said he was taking three genin out of Konoha\u2019s protective walls to train in isolation he had expected a \u2018no\u2019. But the Hokage had surprised him. Sarutobi had leaned back and asked Kakashi why. And when Kakashi had explained he wanted them to survive, to live, no matter what the world threw at them (and it would throw things at the Last Uchiha, The Kyuubi Jinchuriki, and the unfortunate soul who was their teammate).\nAnd the Hokage had immediately granted him permission, flooring Kakashi. Kakashi knew Sarutobi trusted him. It was apparent in how much he let Kakashi get away, how much Kakashi was allowed to know, how when Kakashi asked for an audience it was granted. Kakashi knew he was one of Sarutobi\u2019s favorites. But even he had expected resistance. Apparently he was more trusted and respect by their dictator than he had though. \nBut Kakashi was not going to tell the kids that. That might change their notion of him or something silly. It would also lead to badgering that he was not interested in.\n\u201cWhere are we meeting the bridge-builder?\u201d Sakura asked, interrupting Kakashi\u2019s thoughts.\n\u201cJust East of Konoha, about three days walk out of it. Another team is escorting him until we meet up since they have a mission in a similar direction.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when are we supposed to be there?\u201d she raised a brow at him.\nAh, she must have noticed he was pushing them quite hard each day. Well, that was to train them as well as be on time.\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cThree days?!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cWe\u2019re still at least five days out!\u201d\n\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to pick up the pace than. If you have the energy to talk you must all have the energy to run!\u201d\nThey all gave despairing groans as Kakashi pushed off the branch even faster.\n.--.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d Naruto moaned, \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n\u201cThink of how we feel, you stamina freak,\u201d Sakura hissed. \nNaruto managed to make a face at her from where he was laying face down in the dirt.\n\u201cAll out of energy?\u201d Kakashi asked mournfully looking at the heaps that were his students.\nSasuke tried to stand, as if to prove he could, and failed, muttering into the dirt.\n\u201cWell, I suppose we can set up camp here,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cWe are only three hours away from the meeting point.\u201d\n\u201cBut we have to be there by tonight,\u201d Sakura whined. \n\u201cNope. We need to be there by tomorrow at noon.\u201d\nThey all stilled before turning deadly looks on him. He grinned. \n\u201cI lied, we had an extra day,\u201d he told them cheerfully.\nTheir screams of rage scared away all the birds in the area, but they had no energy to attack him, so he continued grinning at them.\n.--.\nBy the time the time Kakashi sensed a group coming down the road his Genin had laid out various plans of dealing with bandits and other troubles. They had also all taken a dunk in the river a few kilometers over to wash the travel off. They were dressed neatly, carrying only small packs that held the essentials for a few days of travel. The rest was sealed up. Weapons were strapped to their backs and they all looked rested and ready, faces set politely. \nHe had to admit, they actually looked like ninja as they all stood ready in dark clothing, loose ends bound tightly at wrists and ankles and waists. Naruto and Sasuke wore their headbands across their foreheads while Sakura\u2019s was wrapped neatly around her throat. Sasuke\u2019s Satsuma protruded above his head, strapped loosely to his bag. Sakura had her hammer sealed in a scroll tucked in the top of her kimono-top, for easy access. Naruto\u2019s sickle and chain were tucked at his waist. \nThey had been told not to use the weapons unless they were sure they could, or at the very least use it only if it was useful and drop them the moment they became a burden. This would actually be a good mission to test them out against low level opponents. If you couldn\u2019t handle a weapon well it was more of a liability, but this would give them some experience wielding them in battle.\nHis cute little genin looked like proper shinobi and it brought happy tears to his eyes.\n\u201cSo cute!\u201d he cried, burying his face in his hands, \u201cThey grow up so fast!\u201d\n\u201cSo embarrassing,\u201d Naruto moaned.\nSasuke gave Kakashi a look that screamed \u2018you\u2019re an adult, act like it\u2019 while Sakura just shrugged it away, giving Kakashi a comforting pat on his arm. A team of chunin came into view with an older civilian man.\n\u201cHatake,\u201d Kotetsu greeted, the only one familiar to him.\n\u201cKotetsu,\u201d Kakashi greeted with an eye-smile lifting his face from his hands, \u201cYou\u2019re relieved. We will take the mission from here.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d they all snapped salutes. \nWithout another word they were gone, leaping into the trees.\n\u201cHow do they know we aren\u2019t imposters?\u201d Sasuke asked, frowning.\n\u201cOne of them was an Inuzuka. Hard to fool their noses. Other than that, this is a C-rank mission, it is doubtful anyone would go to that length to get a hold of a bridge-builder,\u201d Kakashi explained, \u201cAnd if you watched very closely you would have seen some of the silent signals I made with my posture and which they responded too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d said bridge-builder blustered, narrowing his gaze on them, \u201cI asked for ninja, not a group of shrimpy kids.\u201d\nNaruto\u2019s cheeks puffed up, indignant, but a sharp look from Sakura had him holding his tongue.\n\u201cTeam seven,\u201d Kakashi said lazily, \u201cI\u2019m the Jonin in charge, Hatake Kakashi. Are you Tazuna?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the man frowned before taking a swig from a sake bottle.\nWell this was going to be fun. At least it would make his kids get used to working with prickly civilians.\n\u201cLet\u2019s head out then. We still have six hours of daylight,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully. \n.--.\nThe first sign of trouble came four days later, a week\u2019s travel out of Konoha at a civilian pace. Kakashi spotted the puddle as soon as it came in sight and then turned his eyes on his students. Sakura was frowning, glancing around as if she could sense something out of place but couldn\u2019t figure out. Sasuke had tightened his fists, also sensing something off. And Naruto, well he obviously didn\u2019t sense anything off in the environment around them. But he was very quick to pick up on the tenseness that ran through his teammates.\nAll their reactions showed something about them. Sakura was a well of knowledge and a quick evaluating mind. She had seen the puddle in the view and subconsciously realized that in this dry weather such a thing was out of place even if she hadn\u2019t yet focused on the puddle itself as what was bothering her. Sasuke could most likely sense the faint buzz of chakra in the air from the genjutsu. And Naruto, good with emotion and reading people as he was, had picked up on his teammate\u2019s wariness immediately. \nKakashi watched as Sakura\u2019s frown turned deeper and felt her chakra well up. Sakura had gotten so good at dispelling low level genjutsu she didn\u2019t even use hand signs anymore, just very precisely pulsed her chakra. The genjutsu shattered just feet ahead of them and the enemy was left surprised as they were suddenly pulled from their cover. They quickly tried to rally an attack. \nWatching his students react was like proudly looking at something you had worked on finally be unveiled.\nNaruto used his sickle to deflect a chain out of the way even as Sasuke used his back as a spring board and launched himself at the two ninja now facing them. Sakura had gone the opposite and went low, aiming at the knees with knuckledusters decorating her fists. \nOne of the ninja managed to stumble back from them, but the other had to brace to block Sasuke\u2019s kick which gave Sakura the moment needed to break both his kneecaps. \nEven as the one went down screaming, Sasuke bearing down on him to finish the job, the second recovered. But he wasn\u2019t fast enough. Naruto was in his face, fist drawn back. As the man stumbled from the blow Sakura was gunning for him as well, spinning neatly to nail him in the ribs with a hard fist. Kakashi winced in sympathy knowing how hard Sakura could hit, the knuckle dusters helping all the more. The sound of his ribs breaking seemed to echo. Naruto punched him in the face a second time and the man slumped, out like a light. \nKakashi looked at his students and the two ninja at their feet, one dead and one unconscious. Tazuna the bridge-builder was gaping.\n\u201cGood job!\u201d Kakashi eye-smiled, \u201cNow, did their claws touch you at all? They are poisoned.\u201d\nNone of his students had a single cut or bruise though and simply looked at him. He ruffled their hair as he went for the last enemy left alive.\n\u201cGood job,\u201d he repeated proudly. \nSakura and Naruto beamed and even Sasuke gave a small curling smile at his praise.\n\u201cNow, Naruto, make a seal for that one. These are missing-nin so we can most likely collect a bounty.\u201d\nNaruto obeyed with only the faintest grimace to the body. \n\u201cAnd now,\u201d Kakashi said overly cheerful, \u201cLet\u2019s have a chat Tazuna.\u201d\nThe bridge builder looked ready to flee in the face of Kakashi\u2019s cheer because even he could sense it was hiding a monster. He broke immediately, giving up on the ruse and explaining the situation. Kakashi listened carefully and didn\u2019t let the emotional manipulation get to him even as he saw Naruto tear up at the heart-wrenching story of Wave\u2019s struggle. \nIn the end, Kakashi left the decision up to his team. While he had ultimate authority, letting them look over details and make logical decisions was good practice. They huddled a-ways away talking, laying out yes or nos. Sakura seemed the most opposed for the simple reason they didn\u2019t know risk factors or any real details besides Tazuna\u2019s biased ones. Naruto was all for it because he was a bleeding heart who always wanted to help. Sasuke wanted the mission, to test them on, and he glanced only once at Kakashi as if to double check they had their oversight. \nA few minutes later they were all back on the road, heading towards Wave, and Kakashi freely handed out hair ruffles. \n.--.\n\u201cDuck,\u201d Kakashi ordered harshly. \nHis students, used to obey his commands in all their training, dropped like stones. Sakura was quick enough to think of grabbing Tazuna and hauling him down even as a huge sword spun through the air and sunk into a tree just over the heads.\n\u201cDog formation,\u201d Kakashi barked.\nHis kids rolled away, coming up in a triangle formation around Tazuna, kunai drawn. They had taken many mornings and spars to drill into their heads various formations. Most were simple, just a quick command, but it worked better than yelling out instructions. It also had the bonus of immediately thrusting them into the mindset of fighting and they knew to obey him when he used them. \n\u201cWell, well, well, Hatake Kakashi,\u201d a deep voice chuckled, \u201cFancy seeing the Copy Cat Ninja all the way out here.\u201d\n\u201cMah, I could say the same thing, Demon of the Mist, Momichi Zabuza,\u201d Kakashi chirped.\nThe man now standing on the hilt of the sword still buried in the tree leveled a glance at his students and Kakashi felt his hackles raise.\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d Kakashi said, deceptively calm, \u201cIf you have a problem it\u2019s with me.\u201d\nZabuza gave a nasty grin behind his bandages but Kakashi leveled killing intent at him and the man finally looked away from his students. An instant later Kakashi was gunning for the man. He knew a threat when he saw one and he was going to get this man away from his students right now!\nThey exchanged a series of neat blows, Zabuza ripping his sword out to help keep Kakashi at a distance. Zabuza was decent with taijutsu, but much better at kenjutsu as all the famed Swordsmen of Kiri were. Kakashi ducked under a blow only to be hit by the flat of the blade and tossed through the air like a ball. His vest absorbed a great deal of the impact as did the thin armor he wore under it, hidden by the bulky green. Still, he was tossed back, flipping neatly through the air.\nWhen he landed on the water it didn\u2019t even take but a brief moment to start using chakra to stick. \nKakashi slid across the water, chakra helping him find purchase even as he tried to calculate the quickest way off the water. Before Kakashi could move, water snaked up, coalescing around him leaving him hovering in a bubble. Never fight a Kiri ninja on water they said, just like you never fought a kumo ninja in a storm or a suna ninja with a wind at their back. Or a Konoha ninja when their students were in danger.\n\u201cWater prison,\u201d he burbled before holding in his air. \n\u201cCaught you,\u201d Zabuza leered.\nKakashi was already working on subtle chakra manipulation, drawing air out of the water to breathe slightly. He would still suffocate but more slowly. And Zabuza could do little while holding the prison, hand and chakra balanced, which was why the water prison was a two man take-down technique. \n\u201cNow let\u2019s deal with the kids,\u201d Zabuza grinned.\n\u201cIf you touch them, I will show you why I am feared across every nation,\u201d Kakashi said lowly, a snarl in his voice and killer intent rising-up around him like a tsunami. \nHe caught the slight wincing of Zabuza\u2019s eyes, the tenseness of his shoulders and merely snarled again as his threat sunk into the man. On the shore his students were still positioned around Tazuna but were exchanging harsh whispers. Then Sasuke and Naruto closed ranks as Sakura dropped to her knees beside Tazuna, hands pulling a scroll from her bag. A slow mist was settling around them, rising up subtly from Zabuza. It was an impressive use of a jutsu, well mastered and no hand signs in sight. A water clone peeled away from the man a moment later and through his haze Kakashi felt a grudging respect for the A-rank missing-nin. Hand sign-less clones were a feat. \nBy now Kakashi could no longer see the shore or his students, though he could sense them, even though the swirling chakra water encasing him. Kakashi was waiting for his moment, waiting to light this water up with his chakra that was gathering, pooling in his hands subtly. He would have one shot and he needed to prepare without the ability to make hand signs as frozen as he was in the water. \nHe would have to trust his students to handle the clone. \nBut just as he was getting ready to unleash his lightening, just when he was starting to fear the silence on the land, there was a sharp snap. And an arrow was coming straight for Zabuza\u2019s chest. The man swore, saw his course of action in a moment, and pulled back, dropping the jutsu holding Kakashi prisoner. Another arrow came flying and Zabuza was forced to dodge another blow as Kakashi found his feet, shaking himself free of the chakra water like a dog. \nThe mist started to fade with Zabuza\u2019s concentration and Kakashi smiled grimly at Sakura and her wide stance, long bow held carefully in her arms and a quiver at her feet. Sasuke was tussling with the water clone, a Naruto clone backing him up while the real Naruto guarded the client.\n\u201cZabuza,\u201d Kakashi snarled, much like his ninken, forcing the man to focus on him and not the arrows still being aimed at him. \nZabuza switched focus mid jump and came barreling at Kakashi, hands flashing through signs that Kakashi\u2019s sharingan picked up in an instant. Kakashi thought of copying the water dragon but decided not to at the last moment. Instead he charged his body with the lightening chakra he had been gathering moments earlier. Kakashi was after him like a shot a moment later, heading straight for the dragon that roared a watery challenge. Kakashi grinned and let the electricity spark across his hands, a half form of the chidori. \nZabuza\u2019s eyes widened in alarm and then Kakashi was blasting through the dragon, white lightening around his fist as he headed straight for the man. Just before his hand could pass through the man\u2019s throat, a brace of senbon did it first and Zabuza dropped like a stone, already half sinking into the water. Kakashi flipped over him, landed with a slide on the land, and cast a brief glance at his genin. Sakura still had an arrow knocked and drawn while Sasuke was looking a little damp but victorious. \nA hunter-nin dropped from a tree like a wraith and hauled Zabuza out of the water by the back of his waistband.\n\u201cThank you for your help Hatake,\u201d the kiri hunter-nin rasped through his mask.\n\u201cStealing a kill is rude you know,\u201d Kakashi said pointedly.\nThe Hunter-nin simply loomed. Kakashi understood if he had killed Zabuza before the Hunter-nin politics might have been involved and Konoha definitely would have demanded the body. \n\u201cGet lost then,\u201d Kakashi waved.\nIn a blink the hunter and his prey were gone.\n\u201cUm, shouldn\u2019t he have burned the body?\u201d Sakura asked, bow still in hand. \n\u201cThat\u2019s Konoha procedure,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cThe Kiri-nin like to take their bodies back as proof. Heads alone don\u2019t do it for them. Besides, anyone might be leery of doing procedure before non-allies, especially one with a sharingan.\u201d\nSakura nodded and Kakashi cast a critical eye over all of them as he covered his sharingan. While his chakra was a tad low now, the last few months had dragged him back towards peak form and he was not as exhausted as he could have been. \n\u201cWell,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n.--.\n\u201cDo you know anyone around who knows how to teach music and may be interested in making cash?\u201d Kakashi asked Tsunami on the second day in their home.\nShe stepped back, startled at his sudden appearance, but rallied quick enough.\n\u201cKatsuya may be interested. He was a local performer until\u2026 Well, he lives alone out in the soy field to the south.\u201d\nSo Kakashi went and paid him a visit. The man accepted immediately with an air of desperation and Kakashi decided to trust him and paid him in advance. Kakashi then had to tactfully ignore the tears in the man\u2019s eyes as Kakashi handed him cash and half paid him in a bag of rice. He had already gotten a sense of how desperate the people here were. The fact a man was nearly crying over a bag of rice was far more real though and Kakashi strategically retreated.\nThat night Kakashi sent his three students off under the cover of nightfall with their sealed instruments and instructions to be good. He was more than fine to watch the family on his own for a few hours as his students got real lessons. The fact that it helped calm them down and give them something to focus on outside of training and the run-down air of the place was a bonus. \n.--.\n\u201cThis is what poverty looks like,\u201d Kakashi said lowly.\nSasuke and Sakura are looking about with wide shocked eyes at the hollow-eyed people watching them back. Sakura is from a well to do family and Sasuke had been a part of a clan where something like this would never happen to an individual. His two students kept very close, as if almost scared of how to respond in the face of desolation. Kakashi kept his head high and wasn\u2019t afraid to meet peoples gaze, giving acknowledging head tilts to the few who lingered. \nThey followed Tazuna in to what was a grocery store when it was fully stocked. Now it held some sad looking vegetables and a few dented tins of food. Kakashi noted the way Tazuna eyes darted to them and then the way he weighed his coin pouch. \n\u201cWe will find our own meals,\u201d Kakashi told the man simply, watching as Sakura gave some beaten down kid a candy from her pocket. \nTazuna nodded, relief clear in his face as he paid an abhorrent amount for a small bag.\n\u201cWhere did the blond brat go?\u201d he blustered as the stepped out onto the street.\n\u201cA few streets over I think,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cWe\u2019ll collect him on the way out of town.\u201d\n\u201cI have nothing else to get,\u201d Tazuna shook his head.\nKakashi nodded and led them down an alley, a street, around a corner, and then into a narrow street with a line of doors. Naruto was sitting on a stoop, talking animatedly at a lady sitting beside him. The woman, thin and hollowed like every other village, looked much more lively as she laughed. Naruto grinned at her and then spotted them and gave a short wave. Kakashi watched and saw only a brief flicker of movement as Naruto tucked a stack of coins in the woman\u2019s hand. She frowned, tried to slip them back in his pocket and he merely danced back, giving a wave before he fell in between Sakura and Sasuke.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Sakura asked peering after the woman.\n\u201cA prostitute,\u201d Naruto said unhesitant.\nKakashi watched as his other two students reared away from Naruto in surprise. \n\u201cYou live near the flower district back in Konoha, don\u2019t you Naruto?\u201d Kakashi asked offhand. \n\u201cYup,\u201d Naruto smiled, \u201cThe girls there are super nice! Well, I mean some are. They would let me sit in the kitchen and give me scraps if I was real quiet.\u201d\nSakura and Sasuke are looking at him in horror, as if trying to understand that little blonde Naruto sat at the feet of whores and broke bread with them.\n\u201cAnd you thanked them right,\u201d Kakashi said, slightly scolding.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Naruto scoffed, \u201cI know my manners when I need them.\u201d\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d Kakashi ruffled his hair. \nNaruto looked at the people around them and saw familiar looking nightmares; poverty, starvation, fear. Naruto had grown up in the slums, so close to this sort of thing he looked around with familiar eyes. Kakashi could see how hard it was for Sakura and Sasuke to accept this. Perhaps they might learn something from this.\n.--.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Kakashi said couching beside Sakura, \u201cWatch closely.\u201d\nShe watched with sharp eyes and a single-minded focus he found startling sometimes. Ever since she had decided she was not going to be a \u2018liability\u2019 to her team, or fall behind the boys, she had been focused. At least it made her a tad calmer than the boys.\n\u201cThat looks like a water jutsu,\u201d she said, picking apart the hand signs and meanings.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Kakashi agreed, happy that she could break down something like this so quick.\nShe was such a quick smart student he was sure she could give any Nara a run for their money. He showed her one more time and then had her practice the symbols until they were smooth.\n\u201cI lifted it off of a Zabuza during our scrap,\u201d he told her cheerfully.\n\u201cThe water dragon one,\u201d Sakura realized quickly.\n\u201cYes. Very good for dragons and \u2026,\u201d he prompted.\n\u201cAnd if I can learn it, I might be able to change it into smaller forms, maybe something other than a dragon,\u201d Sakura chimed in, \u201cOr maybe even shape it into a\u2026well, I guess I could do a lot with it since it\u2019s form manipulation of water. In theory at least.\u201d\nHe ruffled her hair and she took it without a frown. They had started to realize that was his way of showing his pride and praise. They had started to accept such actions happily, beaming at him. \n\u201cGo practice under the bridge. Within yelling distance of course.\u201d\nSakura smiled and cheerfully threw herself off the bridge to the horrified shouts of the civilians. Their startled gasps when she landed neat-as-you-please on the surface of the water reminded him how little civilians truly knew of ninja. \nSasuke had cast a glance their way when he heard the scream, eyes searching for a threat. But when he found no such thing he turned back to the group he was working with. Sasuke was apparently a large help with the welding. He was used to working with flame and since he could walk up any surface he could work anywhere at any angle. He had also made them all gasp in amazement when they realized he needed no welding torch and could instead breath out white hot flame. Since Kakashi didn\u2019t want him wasting chakra he only did it sparingly for jobs too large for the torch to be convenient. \nNaruto on the other had was running around carrying things. He had about ten clones doing the same, all of them fetching tools and keeping an eye on workers who were working at heights or in harnesses. Since Naruto was stronger than even the strongest civilian man here he was often asked to carry heavy supplies with his clones or hold things in place as others worked. Sakura had been the look out while the boys worked before he sent her off.\nHis team was doing a fantastic. They were in fact speeding up the building time and Tazuna admitted things were moving forward at a fast pace despite the fact their crew was so small. \n.--.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sasuke growl, frustrated one day, eyes glinting and fists clenched.\n\u201cDon\u2019t understand what?\u201d Kakashi asked lightly.\n\u201cHow?!\u201d he demanded, pointing at Naruto accusingly.\n\u201cHow what Sasuke,\u201d Kakashi repeated, \u201cYou need to use your words.\u201d\n\u201cHow is he so terrible at taijutsu form yet so good at it!\u201d Sasuke growled, \u201cAnd how does Sakura have harder hits than me!? They were both losers in school!\u201d\nSakura shot him a nasty glare but didn\u2019t pull away from where she was waist deep in the water, a fishing net in her hands. Naruto sulked across from Sasuke, his knuckles bloody from where he had smashed them against Sasuke\u2019s nose. While Kakashi didn\u2019t like them to bloody one another, sometimes Naruto\u2019s style was too unpredictable to completely avoid injury. \n\u201cHow long have you been practicing the Uchiha Cold Fire style?\u201d Kakashi asked idly, watching as Sakura cast her net. \n\u201cSince I was four,\u201d Sasuke growled.\n\u201cAnd how did you practice?\u201d\n\u201cI did it in the family dojo,\u201d Sasuke said crossing his arms.\n\u201cDid you ever spar?\u201d\n\u201cOnce in a while. Not after the\u2026.\u201d \nSasuke trailed off, looking at the ground angrily. \n\u201cAnd how long have you been wrestling, Naruto?\u201d Kakashi looked to his blond student.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Naruto said, scratching his cheek, \u201cAll my life I guess?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell the other orphans liked to steal my stuff,\u201d Naruto shrugged, \u201cAnd then when I moved out some people thought they could paint my door or destroy my stuff so I fought them.\u201d\nHe shrugged in a sort of matter-of-fact way, unaware of Sasuke and Sakura turning incredulous looks on him. \n\u201cSee Sasuke?\u201d Kakashi asked, \u201cIf it were a competition of form, you would win hands down. But in a spar it\u2019s a matter of instincts; and Naruto\u2019s have been honed in more dangerous situations than yours.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Sakura?\u201d Sasuke asked, still angry.\n\u201cShe has perfect chakra control,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cEven unknowingly she\u2019s been using chakra to enhance her strikes. It helps grow the muscle harder and makes her hits harder. Just like every child who learns how to channel chakra starts to unconsciously channel it making them stronger and faster than any civilian will be able to be. You can all jump house-high now, even without chakra because of this. She just has the fine control to do it for her muscles in a fight.\u201d\nSasuke, in the face of logic, kicked at the ground angrily.\n\u201cThere is always going to be someone better than you Sasuke,\u201d Kakashi said with a sharp voice, \u201cMaybe not in everything, but in something at least. Instead of finding fault in yourself and your teammates, you should think of how to work your strengths together until as a team you have no weaknesses.\u201d\nSasuke muttered something and stomped off. Naruto went to go after him but Kakashi held up a hand, stopping him.\n\u201cGo help Sakura. If you walk out farther, you can get larger fish.\u201d\nNaruto looked after Sasuke and then at Kakashi before nodding and plodding out to join Sakura in catching dinner. Kakashi went after Sasuke and found him curled up at the base of a tree, face in his knees. \n\u201cSasuke,\u201d he said, crouching beside the boy, \u201cWhy does this bother you? You should understand you can\u2019t be the best at everything and that your teammates will grow. They won\u2019t be the same people you attended the academy with forever.\u201d\nSasuke seemed like he was going to ignore Kakashi, and Kakashi hunkered down ready to wait him out, when finally, the boy looked up, dark eyes look at Kakashi with a suspicious wetness to them. \n\u201cThat man told me I had to be strong, that caring is a weakness, that teams are a weakness that will hold me back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to listen to him?\u201d Kakashi asked, \u201cTell me Sasuke, if you went after him and somehow got poisoned, what would you do?\u201d\nSasuke said nothing.\n\u201cNow, if say Sakura was with you, do you think you would be better off? Or say you ran into a problem that needed an application of traps; would Naruto be a weakness there?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sasuke finally relented.\n\u201cSasuke, Teams can be a weakness in only one way,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cThey can make you vulnerable because you care, that is true. But the benefits far out-weigh the risks. Konoha has only sent out shinobi in teams since its founding for a reason.\u201d\nSasuke breathed heavily through his nose.\n\u201cYou do realize, that if you ask, we will all help you face Itachi,\u201d Kakashi said gently, resting a hand on Sasuke\u2019s head.\nSasuke flinched at the man\u2019s name and looked wildly up at Kakashi.\n\u201cNo!\u201d he blurted out, \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean now,\u201d Kakashi said gently, \u201cBut if we train, one day in the future, I\u2019m sure a team as strong as us can even deal with a S-class missing-nin. We are a team Sasuke. We will have your back.\u201d\nSasuke still looked a tad panicked by the idea, but Kakashi felt him slowly relax under his hand.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t alone anymore Sasuke,\u201d Kakashi hummed.\nSasuke stayed quiet and Kakashi merely sat with him. When Sakura and Naruto came looking, two large fish in their hands, they had ready smiles for Sasuke who cautiously peeked up at them. Their good cheer pulled him from his mood and it was a happy team that returned to Tazuna\u2019s with dinner. And if Sasuke\u2019s eyes lingered on his teammates, Kakashi merely smiled encouragingly. \n.--.\nKakashi had been ignoring the Inari problem. The little boy was a sulking mess and still a little too young to let things like logic work against what he thought was the truth. Kakashi also didn\u2019t care for any kids but his own and this one was not his problem. \nLuckily, or maybe unluckily for Inari, Naruto wouldn\u2019t let the argument go and butted heads with the boy the entirety of their stay. Even Sasuke seemed annoyed at the child and Sakura frustrated. Kakashi let them fight like kids, arguing over the dinner table. Either they would convince the boy and feel accomplished, or they wouldn\u2019t and they would learn sometimes you couldn\u2019t change people\u2019s minds. \nAnd if the kid drove Naruto to frustration which drove Naruto to work those frustrations out with extra training, well Kakashi couldn\u2019t find any fault there. It was good to be motivated and learn how to work out frustration in a healthy manner.\n.--. \n\u201cWeave it under like this,\u201d Tsunami said gently.\nNaruto scowled at the material, tongue peeking out of his teeth as he scrunched his nose in concentration. His hands fumbled, more use to the handle of a kunai than a needle. But he seemed to get it.\n\u201cGood job!\u201d Tsunami praised.\nNaruto brightened like the sun, whole face lighting up under the warm praise. \n\u201cMiss Tsunami! What do I add next?\u201d Sakura called.\n\u201cKeep practicing that row of stitches,\u201d Tsunami told Naruto before retreating to the kitchen to help show Sakura the recipe. \n\u201cThose are looking quite tidy, good job,\u201d Kakashi said peering at the small cross stitching on the material.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cNow my clothes won\u2019t look so terrible!\u201d\n\u201cYour stitching did leave much to be desired,\u201d Kakashi said dryly, remembering the terrible way Naruto had patched some rips before. \nHe would never trust the boy to sew someone up, but he was improving. Naruto was doing well under a calm gentle manner like Tsunami\u2019s, who had endless patience and a careful hand with children. Naruto had never had a mother figure in his life and he flourished under the guidance. Kakashi was trying to think of anyone who could possibly step up to that plate back in Konoha. Naruto needed a calm influence in his life that Kakashi couldn\u2019t always afford to be. Maybe a talk with that academy sensei of his. \nSakura was often in the kitchen, helping Tsunami cook, Sasuke a silent shadow behind her. The boy acted indifferent but Kakashi had noticed his careful looks. He doubted the boy knew how to cook much and made a note to look into his living arrangement when they got back to Konoha. He had already seen Naruto\u2019s. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do some lessons after dinner,\u201d Kakashi announced after a thought, \u201cDo any of you know anything about finances and accounting?\u201d\n\u201cMy father sometimes gets me to help calculate his books with him,\u201d Sakura piped in.\n\u201cI gotta manage my allowance,\u201d Naruto shrugged.\nSasuke didn\u2019t answer but gave a shrug.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about personal finances and maybe even a bit about a larger network like, say, Wave\u2019s,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cMaybe Tsunami can help and teach us about households.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy too,\u201d Tsunami smiled from the kitchen.\nShe was a grateful woman; grateful for the return of her father safely, grateful for the help the kids gave in repairs around the property, grateful for the fact they kept bringing fish and game home for dinner, grateful for sharing extra rations they had tucked away. She was a good influence on the kids and so Kakashi took advantage of the gratefulness in little lessons.\n\u201cSo, what have we learned?\u201d Kakashi asked in the dead of night, a small lantern set on the ground between them.\nSakura unrolled a map of wave between them all and Naruto leaned eagerly forward, a pen in hand. \n\u201cGato\u2019s got warehouses here, here, and here. He\u2019s also got control of the shipyard and has an office there that\u2019s swarming with mercenaries.\u201d\n\u201cHis home base,\u201d Sasuke grunted.\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Naruto nodded, \"He has a ship there too that\u2019s just his and not his company\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Wave is a small island,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAnd seizing shipping ports is the best way to put a chokehold on the economy. How is he doing that?\u201d\n\u201cHe controls outgoing and incoming shipments,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cMaybe not the vessels, but with taxes when they land.\u201d\n\u201cSo why is there no food coming in?\u201d Kakashi asked her.\n\u201cBecause the taxes are too high. People are skipping this port,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cHe\u2019s choking out the competition so only his ships will come here afterwards and have a monopoly. Supplies will become more common again then, but first he\u2019s monopolizing.\u201d\n\u201cLegally?\u201d Kakashi raised a brow.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sasuke snorted. \n\u201cI mean, the Daimyo guy really isn\u2019t doing anything to stop him,\u201d Naruto said scratching his head, \u201cSince Gato isn\u2019t stopping any of his ships or supplies.\u201d\n\u201cCourts never care for civilians,\u201d Sasuke snorted again. \n\u201cSo Wave will be in a depression until the shipping war is over,\u201d Sakura concluded. \n\u201cDoes Konoha have any stock in Wave?\u201d Kakashi asked. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Sakura said bluntly, \u201cWe don\u2019t get anything from them we can\u2019t get elsewhere. Its why we haven\u2019t heard of the problem or seen a rise in any goods or prices.\u201d\n\u201cWave is pretty small scale,\u201d Kakashi agreed, \u201cIf it were any bigger we would have felt it, but Gato chose correctly. Now, onto the problem of Zabuza and his accomplice. If they\u2019re still alive. Gato must be paying him a fortune to work for him and come after us. How do we deal with this?\u201d\nNaruto was frowning at the map thoughtfully, Sasuke was pushing a stick through the dirt in battle plans, and Sakura was squinting at Kakashi as if trying to find a trick question.\n\u201cI got an idea,\u201d Naruto finally said, turning to grin up at them.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it then,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nIn the cover of night, their small lantern glowing over their map, there was no one to listen to Naruto\u2019s idea or Kakashi\u2019s laugh.\n.--.\nKakashi batted Sakura\u2019s strike out of the way, redirecting it carefully knowing how hard that hit was. He had learned not to block her blows unless his was braced. Out on the waves Naruto was facing one of his clones, learning how to grapple better on the rolling surface. And it gave Naruto more chakra control practice which the boy needed in larger doses more frequently than the other two. In the bushes Sasuke was running from a clone, practicing how to hide. It was an exercise in patience for the boy who liked to meet opponents head on. \n\u201cYou over extended that punch,\u201d Kakashi said idly as she Sakura lunged at him.\nShe huffed but straightened her next strike, followed by a leg combo that nearly caught Kakashi.\n\u201cGood,\u201d he encouraged.\nThe moved quickly across the ground, Sakura not backing off the offence for even a minute. Sakura wasn\u2019t a stamina freak yet, but she was a powerhouse, so she hit hard and fast, hoping to wear an opponent down before they wore her down. It was working well for her and Sakura\u2019s confidence grew in leaps and bounds with her hard hitting taijutsu. \nSakura, the softest of his students, the civilian raised girl with candy floss hair and a face still chubby with baby fat, looked good wreathed in violence. It straightened her spine, focused her gaze, and set her shoulders straight. She was a different girl when she was trying to collapse his rib cage and Kakashi was very proud. \nSasuke came spinning out of the bushes, Kakashi\u2019s clone hot on his trail, and leapt over Sakura and the real Kakashi to disappear into the bamboo grove. Kakashi saw the faint shaking of the bamboo even as his clone winked at him and went after the boy. Kakashi smiled as he dodged a punch and reflected that Sasuke was getting much more quick and agile. His little aloof student with an attitude problem was coming out nicely. He just needed a calm authority figure who he could rely on. And Kakashi would be that for him, be there for him, to reassure him. \nNaruto on the other hand, was flourishing just being around other people. Kakashi knew how isolated Naruto had been. While Sasuke had been isolated, more by choice, he still had memories of family to fall back on. He had shop keepers who smiled at him and people who would bend over backwards to help the last Uchiha. Oh it wasn\u2019t perfect but it wasn\u2019t as desolate as Naruto\u2019s position. He was not isolated like Naruto was, not just from people but from positive emotion. \nNaruto, for a boy treated like dirt and left to grow on his own, had turned out shockingly well rounded. And under Kakashi\u2019s care and his team\u2019s closeness, Naruto was growing like a weed, improving in leaps and bounds and blooming. \nKakashi was ridiculously proud of them all. \n.--.\nKakashi was reading his icha icha idly when he felt Zabuza approach. He sighed, a perfectly good reading moment interrupted. He so rarely got a moment alone with his book these days. He snapped it shut and tucked it away, straightening from where he had been slouched on a beam. \nNaruto was already herding men away from the fog that was rolling in. They had started early today, eager to get more work down, and there was usually fog, but this one was thickening instead of dissipating with the sun. Naruto and his clones got everyone off the bridge even as Sakura and Sasuke drew Tzauna between them. Tazuna was a prime target and this scene would probably get messy, but better he was closely watched then out of sight.\n\u201cNaruto, send a clone running back to Tazuna\u2019s to check on his family,\u201d Kakashi called.\n\u201cAlready have some there!\u201d Naruto hollered. \nZabuza loomed out of the mist, the fake hunter-nin at his side. \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make this easy Hatake,\u201d he called, \u201cYou give up the bridge builder and we don\u2019t have to fight.\u201d\nKakashi snorted.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Zabuza grinned, \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting a rematch. Haku, get the kids.\u201d\nKakashi twitched but forced himself to relax as the hunter-nin went spiraling towards his students. Naruto intercepted and gave a holler as he kicked Haku out of his path. Sasuke broke off from Tazuna to help while Sakura kept a defensive position.\n\u201cKeep him busy,\u201d Kakashi ordered, \u201cI\u2019ll help after I deal with Zabuza.\u201d\n\u201cNot if I deal with you first,\u201d Zabuza grinned, \u201cAnd don\u2019t underestimate Haku.\u201d\nKakashi lifted his headband to reveal his spinning sharingan.\n\u201cMah, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just thinking my cute little students outnumber him.\u201d\nZabuza snorted and swung his sword off his back. Kakashi had a plan of course. They all had a plan and he had drilled them on it in case Zabuza hadn\u2019t been as dead as he seemed. Kakashi had had to many incidents of \u2018fake deaths\u2019 and an old enemy at his back to discount such things. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Kakashi grinned.\nHis hands flattened against one another and he flashed through signs to fast for most to see. He turned to an art he rarely used but was much more powerful backed up by the sharingan. \n\u201cGenjutsu,\u201d Zabuza hissed as the world wavered, \u201cI hate that bullshit! Let\u2019s go with good old swords and fists!\u201d\nHe smashed through the first genjutsu, flaring his chakra, and Kakashi was forced to dodge a swing of the sword. He sighed. So little appreciation for the mental arts. Oh well. He\u2019d give Zabuza what he wanted. Kakashi dove into the mist willingly and began a dance with Zabuza, keeping a close ear on his students fight as well.\nZabuza was an A-rank missing nin for a reason, S-rank in kenjustsu alone. But Kakashi was of similar breed. They were both monsters and Kakashi had honed himself recently. It was also an entirely unappreciated fight, hidden by mist and done alone. On the edge of his senses Kakashi could feel the faint body of people approaching on a boat. He was sure Zabuza could feel them as well, but they had no concern for civilians as they traded blows. Kakashi layered light genjutsu on Zabuza, feeling it only fair in the senses dampening mist. \nThey exchanged light banter with heavy blows.\n\u201cWhy are you so interested in Tazuna anyways?\" Kakashi asked at one point, trying to sound out where Zabuza was hiding on the bridge. \nHe usually didn\u2019t care for the enemy\u2019s reasoning but in this instance it was odd to see a A-rank missing nin going so hard for his throat over a civilian hit. \n\u201cGato is paying me more than well for his head,\u201d Zabuza\u2019s voice echoed.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Kakashi replied even as he dodged a slash and tumbled after Zabuza, kunai flashing. \nThere was tinge of blood on his blade and Kakashi smiled at his opening. With a quick summoning he had a growling pack with Zabuza\u2019s scent in their noses.\n\u201cLet\u2019s finish this,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the mist. \nThe hounds all howled and darted into the mist. Kakashi followed them, lightening chakra pooling ready in his hand. And when he heard the crunch of teeth in flesh and bone he lit the spark, the sound of a thousand chirping birds filling the air. The mist started to clear as Zabuza released the jutsu and tried to see the angle Kakashi was coming from. Double edged jutsu and all that. \nThe mist cleared in time for Zabuza to see Kakashi with his fist raised and wreathed in lightening. Kakashi could hear his students end their scuffle even as his eyes tunneled in on the enemy. There was no last minute witty words or last minute saves. \nKakashi sunk his arum up to the shoulder into Zabuza\u2019s chest. The boy, Haku, pinned by Sasuke and Naruto screamed a shrill broken noise. It was an animal noise of pain as Kakashi let Zabuza sag and fall free of his arm. Sasuke and Naruto didn\u2019t look away, respectful, as Kakashi\u2019s opponent fell to the concrete. The boy in their arms was limp making wounded moans.\n\u201cKill me,\u201d the boy sobbed, \u201cplease just kill me.\u201d\nKakashi shook his arm once, splattering blood on the ground and looked at Haku for a long moment.\n\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d he asked blandly.\n\u201cPlease, just let me join him,\u201d Haku choked out.\n\u201cHa!\u201d a voice joined the, \u201cI\u2019ll do that for you little brat.\u201d\nKakashi glanced over at the end of the bridge to find a small gathering of mercenaries bristling with weapons and headed by a short man in a nice suite.\n\u201cSeems the Demon of the mist was really no demon at all,\u201d the man sneered, \u201cCouldn\u2019t even beat a team of kids and their teacher.\u201d\nKakashi smiled at the man blandly behind his mask but Gato didn\u2019t seem to register the threat.\n\u201cNow, hand over the bridge builder and get the hell out of my country,\u201d Gato ordered, \u201cAnd if you give me the boy I might be nice enough to let you leave alive and uninjured. You did me the favor of killing Zabuza before I did but that only gives you a small amount of mercy for your interference.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Kakashi said blandly, \u201cthe old \u2018have them do the job and then kill them so you don\u2019t have to pay them\u2019 ploy.\u201d\nGato laughed in agreement and Kakashi could see Haku stiffening in anger. \n\u201cSo you weren\u2019t going to pay them?\u201d Kakashi asked again, \u201cJust to be sure, I want to know if you were going to break the contract?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I was!\u201d Gato scoffed, \u201cIt\u2019s business, boy.\u201d\n\u201cHear that Zabuza,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cHe was going to betray you.\u201d\nEvery eye went to the body slumped and bleeding and dead. It didn\u2019t even twitch and everyone slowly looked back at Kakashi like he was crazy. Kakashi raised a hand and dismissed the layered genjutsu with a single wave. He covered his sharingan a second later feeling the drain from holding that layer of the genjutsu up under the lighter layers he had allowed to be caught and dismissed. \nThe body of Zabuza wavered and vanished like a mirage. In its place was the real Zabuza sitting with Kakashi\u2019s dog\u2019s still holding him down and a glancing blow of the chidori across his side. Kakashi had pulled at the last second. He\u2019d kept the man pinned of course just in case things hadn\u2019t turned out like he had anticipated. Zabuza must have seen something was up because he hadn\u2019t tried to disrupt the genjutsu or fight too hard against his dogs. \nNow he looked murderous.\nHaku made a noise of relief so deep Kakashi felt it echoed in his bones.\n\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d Zabuza growled.\n\u201cNo guessing about it. My cute little students and I practiced some infiltration,\u201d Kakashi eye-smiled, \u201cNaruto had a good plan on how to break Gato\u2019s strangle-hold on Wave. Had to make sure he wasn\u2019t a big enough threat to derail our mission after all. First we needed to make sure you wouldn\u2019t be an issues. So we broke into his offices and stole a bunch of ship deeds. Then we stole all his business plans. And then we decided Gato really needed to go. We thought we\u2019d give you first dibs though, as the betrayed. We made sure to leave your broken contract and your fees tucked away nice and safe in his office.\u201d\nHis students looked pleased with themselves. As they should be. They had done very well on that little adventure and Kakashi had some important documents tucked away for Sarutobi\u2019s view. Zabuza looked faintly pleased at the \u2018dibs\u2019 and \u2018fees\u2019 part.\nWith a displacement of air and smoke Kakashi\u2019s hounds vanished, letting Zabuza straighten. Kakashi helpfully picked up his sword and offered it out to the man.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any issues now do we?\u201d Kakashi asked pointedly.\n\u201cNone,\u201d Zabuza said flatly.\nSasuke and Naruto let Haku up and the boy scrambled for them, eyes bright and alive as he looked at the mostly uninjured Zabuza.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take out the trash Haku,\u201d Zabuza said gruffly.\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d Haku said eagerly.\nKakashi retreated back to Tazuna\u2019s side with his students and watched the ensuring blood bath.\n\u201cMy clone popped over at Tazuna\u2019s house,\u201d Naruto reported, \u201cAnd headed off some of the mercenaries. There\u2019s a mob forming in the town, but we should be done before they get here.\u201d\n\u201cGood job,\u201d Kakashi ruffled his hair, \u201cAll of you. You stuck to the plan.\u201d\n\u201cHaku was tough but we beat him together!\u201d Naruto cheered.\n\u201cIt would have been easier to kill him,\u201d Sasuke muttered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Kakashi allowed, \u201cBut then we would have had to deal with the mercenaries. And Konoha has never had trouble with Zabuza. Sometimes it is a mark of a strong shinobi when you can let an opponent live instead of killing them.\u201d\nSasuke mulled this over as Zabuza and Haku finished off the last of Gato\u2019s men and then beheaded Gato himself. Tazuna was whispering prayers behind them but they ignored him. \n\u201cI guess we owe you some thanks, Hatake,\u201d Zabuza grunted, bad naturedly, as he shouldered his blade.\n\u201cMah,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cNo need. You\u2019ve got a cute kid there.\u201d\n\u201cNot my kid,\u201d Zabuza huffed.\nKakashi raised a brow at him and the man looked down and away.\n\u201cReally dedicated,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cand strong. He\u2019s a good student.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d Zabuza finally agreed.\n\u201cLook after him. Good students are hard to find,\u201d Kakashi said.\nZabuza snorted.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go Haku,\u201d Zabuza said, \u201cWell collect our fee from his office before the mobs get it.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d Haku beamed.\nAs they headed off, Haku turned to give a wave that Naruto returned enthusiastically.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Kakashi sighed seeing a story there.\n\u201cI met him in the forest the other day while training. We talked about precious people,\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cI thought he was a girl.\u201d\n\u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d Kakashi rubbed at his forehead.\n.--.\nThey stayed to see the bridge completed and enjoyed a few celebrations or two before he and his team got the hell out of Wave. Just because they had been freed from a corrupt business and opened up the economy didn\u2019t mean everything would go all sunshine and rainbows immediately. They shook Tazuna\u2019s hands, all his students gave Tsunami a hug, and Naruto even ruffled Inari\u2019s hair. They left the family the last of their rations and food supplies as a gift and then headed off for Konoha. \nKakashi spent the journey back to the village posing questions about the situation to his students, letting them bounce idea of what Wave\u2019s political climate would be in the next few years.\nThey were all cheerful after their completed mission, proud of what they had done despite all the road bumps. Kakashi was proud as well and liberally handed out hair ruffles as they hurried back to Konoha for the first time in months.\n.--.\n\u201cNaruto, what are you doing?\u201d Sakura asked slightly incredulous as Naruto flopped face first into the dirt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re home!\u201d he crowed, throwing his arms across the ground, \u201cIt feels so good to be back!\u201d\n\u201cGet off the ground, Moron,\u201d Sasuke rolled his eyes.\nAs one, Sakura and Sasuke grabbed an arm and heaved him up. There was a fine layer of dirt and dust all up his front, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\u201cTeam Seven checking back in,\u201d Kakashi smiled at the gate guards who were watching with bewildered looks. \n\u201cAh, of course. Hokage has ordered you to his office for debrief,\u201d the one guard said, clearing his throat as Kakashi signed them in.\n\u201cWell, come on kids,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully.\nThey followed him quick enough and they all headed for the tower. While they waited for the Hokage to have time to see them he managed to bully them into using the washrooms to wash their faces and hands and pat Naruto down of dirt. \n\u201cTeam Seven,\u201d the Hokage said kindly when they finally entered his office, \u201cFinally back in Konoha. How long were you gone for again?\u201d\nKakashi was under no illusion the Hokage didn\u2019t know down to the minute but he nudged Sakura forwards. \n\u201cSince we left for training near Tea country, 3 months and 3 and a half weeks,\u201d Sakura said.\n\u201cAnd since the beginning of your training trips into the woods?\u201d\n\u201cAll together from the first day dropped in the Southern Forests, about 5 months and one week and 4 days,\u201d Sakura said instantly.\n\u201cYou have a quick mind,\u201d the Hokage praised. \nSakura bowed, flushed at the praise, and stepped back.\n\u201cWell, you certainly took time training and on your first C-rank. I hope the results are good,\u201d the Hokage smiled, \u201cWould you like to lodge any complaints about your sensei or the unusual training method?\u201d\nKakashi watched them carefully. This was a test of course, to see if they knew better than to complain about Hokage-authorized training. Perhaps Sarutobi might take Naruto\u2019s words to heart, but the other two would get black marks on their record if they spoke up against Kakashi who was assigned by the Hokage. \n\u201cNo sir,\u201d Sakura answered instantly and unhesitantly, \u201cIt has been a privilege.\u201d\nHer words were honest even though she could see it was a trick question. She wasn\u2019t just giving him what he wanted to hear though, she was being truthful and Kakashi rewarded her with a hair ruffle. She smiled shyly sideways at him and didn\u2019t slap his hand away. \n\u201cGood, good. I expect mission reports to be submitted by tomorrow. Dismissed Genin.\u201d\nNaruto gave him an enthusiastic wave while the other two bowed.\n\u201cGo relax,\u201d Kakashi further commanded, \u201cAt seven, meet me for a team meeting at Ichiraku\u2019s ramen stand.\u201d\nNaruto gave a noise of joy as the others lugged him out of the room. \n\u201cI hope it was worth it Kakashi,\u201d Sarutobi said as the door shut, \u201cThe council threw a fit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d\n\u201cThat they had pushed me to make you a teacher and they could deal with it.\u201d\nKakashi chuckled lowly.\n\u201cIt was well worth it,\u201d he said to the Hokage, eye earnest.\n\u201cWhat level are they at then?\u201d\n\u201cMid-Chunin. At the very least,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cThey all have a terrible amount of potential. I just needed to iron out some attitude problems and get them working as a team. That\u2019s why I requested the isolation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I granted it,\u201d Sarutobi nodded, \u201cI eagerly await their display of skill. Enter them in the chunin exams when the applications open up. Dismissed.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Hokage-sama,\u201d Kakashi bowed.\n\u201cOh, and Kakashi?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the Hokage smile. \nKakashi wondered if the Hokage was thanking for him for taking this new team seriously, for treating Naruto right, or for helping upset the council. Maybe all of it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nThen he ducked out the door. Kakashi had to get unpacked himself and then he had three genin to teach mission reports and debrief procedures too. Then he had to go fill in the paperwork to enter them in the chunin exam. He already had the forms of course, having been planning it before he had been ordered to, so it would be easy enough.\nMah. Being a jonin-sensei was so much work. But so far\u2026 so far it was well worth it.\n.--.\n\u201cOkay kids, no time to rest!\u201d Kakashi announced as he appeared on the stool beside his students.\nHe was met with a series of groans as the kids shoved ramen into their faces. He gave them a fond look as they practically inhaled the food. He supposed months in the forest cooking on a campfire and then eating pretty much nothing but fish in wave had made them starved for \u2018real\u2019 food. Even ramen made that cut now.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be gracious and let you finish your ramen,\u201d Kakashi said in a saintly tone.\n\u201cIf you had tried to get between us, I would have eaten whatever body part appeared in the way,\u201d Naruto declared around a mouthful of broth.\n\u201cEw,\u201d Sakura muttered, \u201cYou don\u2019t know where his body parts have been Naruto. Actually, wait, you do. That makes it worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d get indigestion,\u201d Sasuke snorted.\n\u201cMah, no respect,\u201d Kakashi lamented to the chef and the girl who both were watching with amusement. \nThey didn\u2019t even ask what he wanted, just slid him a bowl. He wondered how good the man\u2019s memory was if he could remember what Kakashi had always ordered when Minato brought him here. Kakashi let peace reign as everyone ate, reveling in the warm salty goodness. \n\u201cOkay, as I was saying, we have no time to rest,\u201d Kakashi announced, \u201cWe only have three weeks about.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, why only three weeks?\u201d Sakura asked with narrowed eyes, \u201cWhat's in three weeks?\u201d\n\u201cMah, it\u2019s a secret,\u201d Kakashi grinned, \u201cNeedless to say we must prepare! What is team seven\u2019s motto!\u201d\n\u201cThe serious one or the silly ones?\u201d Naruto asked.\n\u201cAll our mottos are serious!\u201d Kakashi gasped.\n\u201cIf that was true we\u2019d have like, a hundred,\u201d Naruto rolled his eyes, \u201cMusic is free therapy! Never use lightening attacks on water! Always have at least 5 weapons on hand! Always smile because it confuses your enemies! There is no such thing as over prepared, only underprepared! Always-\u201d\n\u201cThe last one,\u201d Kakashi said decisively, \u201cAnd none of those are silly. Anyways, better to be over prepared. So we need to work out a schedule. I will give you the rest of tonight off-\u201d\n\u201cHow nice of you,\u201d Sasuke said dryly, \u201cSeeing how it\u2019s so early at 7 pm.\u201d\n\u201c-But we start bright an early,\u201d Kakashi continued unfazed, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to write succinct mission reports and how to give mission debriefs if ever needed to do it in person. We need to restock on supplies after that. Then, training! I want to polish up all your taijutsu more and I\u2019m working on finding tutors for your weapon training. After that we need to make sure you all have your ninjutsu mastered in the next few weeks. No new ones. We need to focus on what you have. Remember, \u2018Jack of all trades-\u201d\n\u201cBut master of none, is still better than a master of one!\u201d his kids chorused.\n\u201cGood. So these three weeks are going to be less new stuff and more polishing of all the skills I\u2019ve been teaching you. This is going to require patience,\u201d he said with a pointed look at Naruto who squirmed, \u201cIt will be boring at times, but it is needed. We also need to finish some D-rank missions. So, tomorrow, 9am, Naruto\u2019s place.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, why my place?\u201d Naruto squawked.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s closest between all of our places. And that means you can get a few minutes of extra sleep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! Why does he get the extra sleep?\u201d Sakura blurted out.\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s paying for dinner,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d\nHe vanished in time to miss Naruto\u2019s scream.\nHe wondered if Sakura and Sasuke would follow his example or stay and split the bill. They would learn in time.\n.--.\nKakashi gave his students a nod when they all handed their mission reports politely and calmly. Even Naruto managed to keep his voice a reasonable level. The chunin working the desk, accepting the scrolls, raised a surprised eyebrow. He peeked in one of the scrolls and turned an incredulous look on Kakashi as if he couldn\u2019t believe he could actually read the handwriting. Kakashi honestly liked to make it hard for them with bad hand writing and half of it in code. But his students needed to be able to do it right before they could have fun with it.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Kakashi asked his students patiently.\n\u201cTeam Seven requesting some D-ranks,\u201d Sakura said, chin raised and tone even.\nThe desk chunin raised a brow at her but offered a smile and pulled a few forms from his desk.\n\u201cThere is a request for weeding, a fence painting, walking the Inuzuka dogs, finding Tora, doing a grocery run for the orphanage, helping run some games at the senior center, and cleaning up the south city park,\u201d the chunin said, shuffling the papers, \u201cSince you are the first ones here today you get first pick.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take them,\u201d Sasuke nodded for the team, sharp and brisk.\nNaruto reached out and plucked the forms from the stunned looking chunin.\n\u201cA-all of them?\u201d he blinked.\n\u201cYup. Thanks!\u201d Naruto beamed.\nAnd then they followed one of his lessons to heart and ducked out the door before anyone could gather their wits and argue. \n\u201cAttack plan?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cGrocery run while the markets are quiet, then the weeding and painting while it\u2019s not too hot out,\u201d Sakura said immediately, gathering the forms from Naruto to look at addresses and detail, \u201cAnd then we will need to do the center since its time sensitive. Then we can do the dogs and look for Tora at the same time since there is no detail beyond wander about with the dogs. And then we can end it with the park in the cool of the evening.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Let\u2019s go then,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully.\nThey all nodded determined. He knew they would have thrown a fit if he hadn\u2019t explained the purpose of D-ranks was to give back to the village, work on teamwork, learning how to work with civilians, and so on. If he also hadn\u2019t warned them of how dull the missions could be they might have groaned and whined. As it was, they understood the purpose of them now. \nPlus he had told them all the other Genin Teams had at least forty D-ranks done each and that on paper Team Seven looked to be failing. That had lit a fire under their feet.\n.--.\n\u201cGood job today,\u201d Kakashi said to his tired genin.\nThe D-ranks beyond Tora hadn\u2019t been all that exhausting, but keeping up with all of them and keeping a cheerful facade in the face of a center full of grumpy seniors had drained his kids. Neither of the boys were a socialite by any means and even Sakura had lost some tolerance for it lately. Talking to people was hard.\n\u201cDo you have the energy for some training?\u201d\nThey all looked at one another and Kakashi waited as they made a decision. It was their job to evaluate their own capabilities. They also had to want to train or it would be a waste of time. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Sakura finally nodded for all of them, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think taijutsu.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Tomorrow we will skip missions and do taijutsu. If we can do as we did today, we will only need to do missions every third day. I also have a surprise lesson for you.\u201d\nThey nodded, looking a tad curious, and he gathered them all up to start smoothing out some of their ninjutsu.\n.--.\n\u201cWho knows of summons?\u201d Kakashi asked the three.\n\u201cSummons?\u201d Naruto asked, confused.\n\u201cYou mean like summoning animals?\u201d Sakura asked eager.\n\u201cYes. Naruto, if you sign a contract with certain animals you can summon them to your location and they will fight with you,\u201d Kakashi said simply.\n\u201cWhat?! Cool!\u201d Naruto grinned, \u201cAny animal?\u201d\n\u201cIt depends. If you do sign a contract they have to accept you first of course,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cThey can always turn you down and strike your name from their scroll. Summons aren\u2019t mere animals, most are powerful with grasps of human language and even some jutsu. Often they can be much larger than a normal animal as well.\u201d\n\u201cLike the sanin!\u201d Sakura chirped.\n\u201cThe sanin?\u201d Naruto echoed.\n\u201cAnother time perhaps,\u201d Kakashi cut Sakura off from indignant explanation, \u201cThe three she is talking about had summon contracts. They also give a good example of the different kinds of summons there can be. There is the Toad Contract that summons various toads from regular sized to some the size of the Hokage monument. They live in the summons realm and are known as prophets and warriors. The Snake summons is quite similar in you can summon varying snakes of varying sizes. Lastly was the slug Contract. Do any of you know why the slug contract is different from the other two?\u201d\nThey all shook their heads, listening very carefully. \n\u201cWhile the other two contracts had a great deal of animals to summon, multiple toads and snakes, the slug contract has only one summon. Katsuyu is the only slug it summon.\u201d\n\u201cIs there a reason?\u201d Sakura asked, ever the knowledge seeker.\n\u201cSummon animals live in a realm separate from ours,\u201d Kakashi started, \u201cSo they are not normal animals in a sense. We don\u2019t really know that much of them but some relate them closer to kami and spirits then animals. The Toad and snake contracts are tied to the species as a whole. All the Toads are linked to it just as all the snakes are linked to their contract. For Katsuyu, she is the only one of her kind. She appears to be a slug the size of the monument, but she possess the ability to break down into a hundred smaller slugs. Though she can split, she is still the same being, and it is said her contractor can communicate and channel chakra through her.\u201d\nThey stared at him, trying to sort this information and he gave them a moment.\n\u201cSo some contracts can only have one animal?\u201d Naruto finally frowned.\n\u201cIndeed. Take my contract for example.\u201d\n\u201cYou have one?\u201d Naruto blurted out, eager.\n\u201cHe used it in Wave against Zabuza,\u201d Sakura elbowed Naruto.\n\u201cThe dogs? I thought that was part of the illusion,\u201d Naruto grinned sheepishly. \n\u201cI have a contract with a pack of ninken,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cNinken are a unique contract as well, as they sign on as a pack, not as a species or individually. The Inuzuka also hold a ninken contract, but it\u2019s not for one person. They hold it as a clan. You\u2019ve probably seen their companions, each Inuzuka paired with a dog. Those dogs are ninken, not normal dogs. The pack the clan signed contract with lives full time in this realm and grow up alongside the humans. So they aren\u2019t summoned but work alongside each other every day all the time.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Can we meet yours?\u201d Naruto asked looking a tad overwhelmed.\n\u201cOf course. That\u2019s why I brought the subject up. I\u2019d like you to meet them.\u201d\n\u201cCan we get our own summoning contracts?\u201d Sakura asked as Kakashi withdrew a scroll from his vest. \n\u201cIf you can find one or find a summon animal in this realm to talk to. They aren\u2019t uncommon but nor are they an everyday thing. Most people inherit them from teachers or family. I inherited my pack from my father,\u201d Kakashi explained as he unrolled his contract, \u201cBut keep an eye out. They can be invaluable to you.\u201d\nWith a flash of smoke they were suddenly surrounded by a herd of dogs.\n\u201cYo!\u201d Kakashi greeted, \u201cLook at my new puppies!\u201d\n\u201cPuppies!\u201d the dogs spazed. \nHis genin were buried under wagging tails and prodding snouts and a mountain of rapid fire questions as his dogs tried to sniff them, get pets, and see if they had treats. Kakashi laughed at Sasuke\u2019s indignant squawk and Sakura\u2019s yelp of surprise and Naruto shrill yip of joy.\n.--.\n\u201cYo! Treat time!\u201d Kakashi called.\nHis students and dogs alike came tripping over eagerly.\n\u201cWhat did you get us?\u201d Naruto asked, jumping up and down.\n\u201cTreats! Treats! Treats!\u201d Guruko yelped jumping alongside Naruto.\nKakashi lifted the convenience store bag above their heads and gave them stern looks.\n\u201cSit.\u201d\nAll his ninken sat immediately, as did Naruto. Sakura and Sasuke rolled their eyes behind him and dragged him to his feet. Kakashi tossed Naruto a box of dog treats and the boy eagerly opened it to give the dogs a few treats each. The rest of the box got poured into Bull\u2019s mouth as the giant dog waged his tail happily. \n\u201cHere you go,\u201d Kakashi smiled, handing Sakura her iced coffee and Sasuke his bottle of tea.\nNaruto got a bottle of orange juice since it was the only way to make him consume fruit and veggies it seemed. They each got a box of pocky as well.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best sensei,\u201d Sakura gushed.\n\u201cMah, it fills my heart with joy to hear you say those word,\u201d Kakashi wiped a tear away.\nShe grinned at him and cracked her drink.\n\u201cAfter you\u2019re finished we\u2019ll play a game of tag and then I have a task for us to do in town,\u201d Kakashi declared.\n\u201cTag?\u201d Naruto asked around a mouthful of pocky.\n\u201cTag where you can\u2019t touch the ground,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cOr I punish you.\u201d\nThey stared at him wide eyed and he cackled to back up his threat. They shuddered.\nBy the time the game of tag was done his students were panting sweaty messes with sticks leaves and dirt in their hair and clothes. But they had improved on their tree sticking and their water walking because he had come at them from every and any angle. Sakura, sticking to the edge of a boulder by her fingertips while one foot clung to branch and the other to a post just millimeters above the ground, had been inspiring. \n\u201cOkay, rinse off and then we have a quick task,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\nHis students trudged to the river\u2019s edge, splashing their arms and legs and faces. Naruto gave up and just chucked most of his clothes and waded in in his boxers. Sakura rolled her eyes and helped Sasuke pick sticks out of his hair and high collar. As those two were distracted Naruto got a devious look on his face, Kakashi ended up tugging Naruto from the water before he could splash his teammates and star an all-out war.\n\u201cThings to do,\u201d Kakashi tsked as Naruto whined. \nNaruto huffed but shook himself off like a dog once on land and redressed.\n\u201cOkay kiddes, follow me!\u201d Kakashi said leaping off.\nThey scrambled after him and Kakashi pretended not to see when Sasuke tripped Naruto to get ahead of him. The entire trip soon consisted of small sabotages as the kids made a game out of catching up first. \nWhen Kakashi dropped suddenly from the roof, they were almost all nearly on top of him. He laughed as they squawked, overshooting the stop. The backtracked quick enough through and joined him on the ground.\n\u201cYamada,\u201d Naruto squinted at the sign above the door, reading carefully.\n\u201cWhat type of store is this?\u201d Sakura asked eyeing the dusty window and the lack of display.\n\u201cA well-respected shinobi shop,\u201d Kakashi said simply as he held the door open.\nThey all filed into the dark dusty little shop and peered curiously about at the shelves.\n\u201cAh, Hatake,\u201d the shopkeeper greeted immediately.\nHis students stared at the positively ancient woman that shuffled out from behind the counter, bent over and wearing thick glasses. \n\u201cWhat can I do for you today?\u201d the woman asked peering up at Kakashi, \u201cYou haven\u2019t lost another set of armor, have you?\u201d\nKakashi held his hands up at her suspicious huffy tone. \n\u201cI have three cute little genin for you to outfit today!\u201d he said cheerfully.\nShe peered at the dazed kids and finally smiled. \n\u201cArmor?\u201d Naruto asked.\n\u201cYamada makes the best armor in all of the west,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cdiscreet, lightweight, and well worth the high price. Her armor has saved my life a few times.\u201d\n\u201cHmm, with a teacher like him you\u2019ll need it,\u201d the woman muttered, \u201cwho first?\u201d\nSakura and Sasuke glanced at one another than shoved Naruto forwards. It took an hour to fit the kids with armor. Yamada\u2019s armor was very modern, made less of metal and more of seal reinforced chain, mesh, and cloth. Her seals were very secret and very useful and it was said the Yondaime himself had come to her for help with seals. It was even rumored she had Uzumaki blood. \nYamada was one of the best kept secrets of Konoha and her armor had saved hundreds of lives. Each piece was unique and handmade and valuable. Nearly every Konoha jonin wore at least a piece of her armor. Kakashi knew for a fact that the mesh shirt Anko wore openly was one of Yamada\u2019s more advanced ones, the mesh stronger than steel. \nHis students were each fitted with specific pieces. Naruto argued for mesh in the end because he said he needed to be able to squeeze into small spaces to set traps. Mesh wasn\u2019t the strongest of her armor, but Naruto had a very good healing rate so Kakashi was not as worried. The mesh would give for nothing less than the sharpest chakra blades anyways. Oh he may get cut between the spaces, but he would never be disemboweled. So Naruto was outfitted in a long sleeves mesh shirt, and spandex like pants to wear under his normal clothes that were so inked in seals they had appeared to be black despite the fact the cloth was white. \nSasuke went next and got a set of heavier armor. He got a shirt that was a few layers thick, delicate chainmail sewed between layers of cloth. It was flexible enough for his style but solid enough to take heavier hits. He got pants and a shirt, all in dark colors.\nSakura was the trickiest of the lot. While he wanted to get her the heavy armor she also needed room to grow, not just up, but around the curves. \nArmor was expensive enough he wasn\u2019t going to buy them new sets every time they shot up a few inches. For that reason Sasuke and Naruto\u2019s were a few sizes too large. Easily fixed by folding and bandaging tight at places like the ankle, wrist, and waist. Since they had picked thinner armor, it was flexible enough to do so. But Sakura was going to grow in different ways from the boys. \nIn the end Kakashi sent the boys on a convenience store run and Yamada spent some time fitting her with various combinations. By the time they had decided, Sakura had a chest piece of armor that was fashioned to look like a tank top. It covered mid-stomach to her collar bone and was flat and smooth protecting her ribs and heart. It was made of a layer of plate set between cloth. It was held on by straps under her arm over her shoulders that could be adjusted for growth. The layer touching her skin was a tad more padded and would fit comfortably unless Sakura\u2026developed quite a bit. Sakura wore a layer of mesh like Naruto\u2019s underneath the plate to cover her stomach and lower back . \nSakura was a heavier hitter than the boys and would most likely be more often engaged in taijutsu battles so she got a few extra pieces as well. Arm guards were tucked in the pile to cover her forearms to her wrist. On top of that she got plate armor that hugged her legs and travelled from her ankle up to mid-thigh that was a masterpiece of interlocking pieces to cover her legs while also keeping her flexibility and staying silent. Her plate armor was quite heavy but well worth it in Kakashi\u2019s opinion. She would grow used to it. \n\u201cI can have it to you in two weeks if it\u2019s a rush,\u201d Yamada said with a knowing look.\n\u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d Kakashi smirked. \n\u201cGood. I will have to resize and readjust some of it. Leaving room for growth of course,\u201d Yamada said as she tallied his total, \u201cGirl, what color do you want the plating?\u201d\n\u201cI can chose?\u201d Sakura asked startled, \u201cI thought it was automatically black?\u201d\n\u201cI cover the seals with a layer of paint to hide them,\u201d the woman explained, \u201cDo you want plain black?\u201d\nSakura looked to Kakashi but he shrugged.\n\u201cUm, could I have them mostly black? Maybe just some detailing?\u201d\n\u201cAcceptable. What color?\u201d\n\u201cRed,\u201d Sakura finally decided.\nWhen she said the total Sakura winced but Kakashi willingly paid.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Sakura asked shyly, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it will most likely save your lives at some point. So well worth it,\u201d Kakashi ruffled her hair, \u201cLet your old sensei give you a gift.\u201d\n\u201cYou constantly give us gifts,\u201d she protested.\n\u201cNot like I\u2019m broke,\u201d he chuckled.\nShe let him off the hook but he caught her muttering something to Sasuke and Naruto as they returned. They all took a break outside the shop, sipping at their new drinks and nibbling on the treats Naruto had picked out.\n\u201cSo, armor down. I feel like after our adventures in the forest, some of you need some new clothes,\u201d Kakashi said looking them over. \nThey had each got something in the Tea capital, but it was civilian make, not meant for ninja stress. After the trouble in wave the clothes were even more tattered, if not well mended. \n\u201cLet\u2019s go take a quick look,\u201d Kakashi said leading them off to another popular shinobi shop.\nOnce again, this shop was not distinguished by signs or advertisement but by word of mouth. It was a popular store for jonin and Kakashi even recognized one of the men browsing when they entered. It was once again a small shop that had a few racks of clothes but specialized in customization. Most ninja wore a regular uniform or wore custom outfits that rarely changed. \n\u201cGo take a peek,\u201d Kakashi waved his students on. \nThey hesitantly flipped through the racks before getting a tad more into it. Kakashi kept half an eye on them as Sakura started to hold things up against the boys, talking about colors and fashions.\n\u201cHello Hayate,\u201d Kakashi said, giving his brightest smile to the other patron.\n\u201cGood lord. That look says you want something,\u201d Hayate rolled his eyes, coughing lightly into his hand. \n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Kakashi grinned.\n\u201cWhat do you need Hatake?\u201d the man sighed. \n\u201cAnyone you know that can use the Sasumata?\u201d\nHayate paused, eyeing him carefully.\n\u201cKotetsu,\u201d he finally answered, \u201cIs the only one I can think of. He learned off some man in the capital on a mission, but you know Kotetsu, he doesn\u2019t have it mastered, he\u2019s just passable.\u201d\n\u201cYes, too distracted by a new weapon before he could master it,\u201d Kakashi nodded sagely, \u201cApparently one of Gai\u2019s students is like that. Wants to be a weapons mistress.\u201d\nHayate nodded and Kakashi gave him a wave as he went to pay for his own purchase.\n\u201cSensei, what do you think?\u201d Naruto called, tugging at his sleeve.\nKakashi turned around and tried to hide his wince.\n\u201cI think no,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cSakura, why would you let him put that one?\u201d\nSakura smirked at him over Naruto\u2019s bright pink, feathered shoulder. He was wearing some kind of pink feathered cape.\n\u201cJust testing stuff,\u201d Naruto said innocently, hiding giggles behind his hand.\nKakashi tugged it off gently and hung it back on the rack. He paused though as he caught sight of what Naruto was wearing underneath.\n\u201cThat is acceptable,\u201d Kakashi said nodding to the rest.\nNaruto was wearing a pair of dark green pants that fit well enough he could wear armor beneath but wouldn\u2019t billow. His shirt was now a dark grey t-shirt that would fit over his mesh and similarly was a tighter fit. He had found a nice multiple pocket and pouch belt that sat snug about his waist in muted green. He wouldn\u2019t be Naruto without orange, but they had found a dull burnt orange haori with a tasteful pattern of swirling grey clouds and green leaves. \n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch the sleeves,\u201d Kakashi said, tugging at the wide sleeves, \u201cBut you can also ditch a haori easily enough if need be.\u201d\nIt actually looked good on the kid, professional but with a touch of his personality. The haori also helped hide the pouches. His chain and sickle would be hidden tucked in his waist against his spine under the haori as well. It was also large enough to make Naruto look smaller, more unassuming when paired with the orange color. More likely to be underestimated.\n\u201cCan I put seals on the jacket?\u201d Naruto asked, looking at the inside of his jacket, \u201cthe lady at the shop puts them on cloth and stuff for armor, so can I put storage ones on here?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a good question,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cand correct. They are a tad trickier to make stick to cloth but I can teach you.\u201d\n\u201cHow does Sasuke look,\u201d Sakura said, pushing Sasuke forward next.\nSasuke didn\u2019t need pants as he would be getting the dark armored ones, nor a shirt as he had one of those coming as well. But he had picked a dark grey kimono like top that had long but narrow sleeves, no large baggy pieces, tied shut with a black strip of cloth he had tied in front, tucking the loose ends in so they couldn\u2019t be grabbed. It was a flat grey, but had patterns in black and blue with hints of silver of mountains and clouds that looked like smoke curling about. The top was tight and secure enough he would be able to carry his Sasumata on his back.\n\u201cAlso good,\u201d Kakashi nodded, \u201cTry to find some good kunai pouches. I noticed your one was a tad ruined from our last spar.\u201d\n\u201cI have some at home,\u201d Sasuke said.\n\u201cFind new ones,\u201d Kakashi said again. \nSasuke looked up at him with narrowed eyes but Kakashi reached out and ruffled his hair.\n\u201cPick out you own. You have the money.\u201d\nSasuke finally nodded and wandered off, Naruto looking between them confused. \n\u201cMake sure he gets some,\u201d Kakashi told the blonde boy seriously, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to wear his dead family\u2019s.\u201d\nNaruto\u2019s eyes widened and he hurried off. Technically it would be a waste not to use the Uchiha\u2019s, but Kakashi didn\u2019t think Sasuke needed to use the things of his dead relatives. He\u2019d obviously been using their weapons, but weapons were different than clothes that had been worn into shape by specific people. \n\u201cMe next!\u201d Sakura interrupted his dark thoughts, stepping forwards. \nShe would be covered ankle to waist with first spandex armored pants and then plating but she had found a short dark red kimono that fell mid-thigh with wider sleeves than Sasuke\u2019s so it fit looser, but not the long impractically dangling ones that kimono usually had. She had tied it shut loosely in the front with a black belt that held a few smaller pouches along its length. The pattern on her kimono was a series of blooming chrysanthemum in dark purples and pinks with tasteful designs between them. It was clear she intended to only wear her armor plating and mesh beneath it.\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d Kakashi complimented, \u201cSame as Naruto, make sure no one gets a grip on it if you have it that loose.\u201d\nShe nodded and went off to fetch the boys who were digging through a box of kunai pouches. By the time they exited the shop, new clothes paid for it was well into the afternoon.\n\u201cI think I see a theme,\u201d Kakashi said amused, looking at his cute little students in their dark pants and traditional patterned tops.\n\u201cLike a uniform!\u201d Naruto grinned. \nKakashi laughed and ruffled their hair.\n.--.\nKakashi watched with half an eye as Kotetsu went through the motions beside Sasuke. Sasuke was watching with careful attention but Kakashi had his sharingan out, since Kotetsu couldn\u2019t come back every day to teach Sasuke. They would at least know better basics and could work on their own after he left.\nThe other half of his attention was on Naruto and Sakura lightly sparing on the other side of the clearing using their own weapons. \nKakashi had bartered with Miyazaki, owner of the local weapons shop and weapons enthusiast to copy an hour\u2019s worth of lessons using a hammer and a chain and sickle. He had known enough about the chain and sickle that Kakashi would be able to keep Naruto busy for a bit, but even he had only known the bare basics of using a hammer. His cute little student just had to pick the one weapon no one in Konoha used. Oh well, she\u2019d muddle through it till they could find a sensei. He had already noted she as heading for the library after lessons, and after checking up, had found she had been looking at the few scrolls on intel they had on said weapon. \n\u201cI have one more gift for you,\u201d Kakashi smiled at Sakura as she and Naruto took a break.\nHe held out a scroll and she eagerly unsealed it.\n\u201cWow!\u201d Naruto crowed, leaning over her shoulder to look at the large hammer.\n\u201cThe wooden one you were using is okay, but it wouldn\u2019t hold up to the strain of real battle. Miyazaki got this one from Iwa. Real steel so it will be heavy,\u201d Kakashi warned.\nSure enough she had trouble lifting it as easily as the wooden one. He trusted she would get it though.\n\u201cThis must have been expensive,\u201d she muttered, eyes narrowed.\n\u201cGot a deal actually. No one wanted it for the same reason we can\u2019t find you a teacher; no one in Konoha uses the hammer.\u201d\nWhich was true, he had gotten a splendid deal actually. He ruffled her hair and set her and Naruto back to work, Sakura much slower under the new weight. \n.--.\nNo one became a ninja for the pay. \nEvery ninja got a small stipend a month (based on rank) as long as they worked either missions or in village. It wasn\u2019t done per mission as that would create a competitive work environment in a place they tried to foster cooperation and teamwork. So instead you were paid according to your rank as long as you filled a certain number of hours a month. Out of village missions could count towards more hours since you were technically on duty at all times while away. You could also stock pile hours, such as working back to back missions for one month to take the next off as long as you were not specifically needed. It made sure ninja took the initiative to keep busy but since everyone got a similar pay no one was fighting for missions or sabotaging others to get hours. Genin were given a bit more leeway in the hours department if the sensei filed for more training hours (which is what Kakashi had done for their training trips) which was usual before exams and the like. \nThe only way to make extra money was to get bonuses on well done missions (by the Hokage\u2019s decision) and by collecting bounties while out on missions. There were cases where ninja accepted small missions while out on larger ones as well. Local villages would sometimes ask for certain help if a ninja wandered through town. As long as it didn\u2019t interfere with the village assigned mission it was fine. You just had to declare it to pay taxes on the mission. Same as the bounties. \nIn return Ninja got subsidies on housing, ninja specific housing available to those who did not want to find anywhere else or couldn\u2019t. Healthcare was free. Certain bars and restaurants (especially the Akimichi ones) would give discounts as well. Standard weapons could be gotten from the armory, a certain amount per month, only extras needing to be purchased out of pocket. And since D-ranks were provided free of charge to any villagers who could prove a need, most civilians tended to tip the ninja since they hadn\u2019t had to pay for the service. \nAs for teachers, well, jonin sensei got a decent stipend while training. They were treated as working hours and they were given a tad extra to help with the training be it for tools, the odd team bonding meal, or such. \nKakashi had been holding onto that stipend saving it carefully as they didn\u2019t have to spend anything in the middle of nowhere. Kakashi was also by no means a large spender. He had his cheap apartment and he had everything he could need. The only things he regularly purchased was food and weapon replacements. His only vice was porn, so he didn\u2019t spend money at the bar or the brothels. The only other thing he ever spent money on were his ninken, but the Inuzuka rarely charged him for check-ups or appointments. \nSo Kakashi who had been working full time since he was 6 years old had a decent amount of savings on his own. But he was also the head of the Hatake clan. While they had never been the most prosperous clan, they had still at one point had a decent amount of members. Most Hatake had preferred simple lives, not spending lavishly, so savings had built up there as well. While there were other Hatake in the ninja ranks, distant cousins and relatives, Kakashi was the last of the main branch. To be honest the Hakate wasn\u2019t so much a clan now as it was a scattered family. Kakashi could claim no relative to be close nor did he want to to be honest. \nBut that didn\u2019t man he wasn\u2019t still head of the clan with a vote on the council and a nice nest egg of savings.\nAlong with a house. \n.--.\n\u201cThis is your house?\u201d Sakura asked, nose wrinkled as she looked at the dusty doorway.\nThe front gate had squeaked atrociously when they had opened it and there were so many dead leaves and weeds on the ground they had had to push hard. \nKakashi hadn\u2019t touched the place since his father had died to be honest. When he remembered every few years he got a D-rank ordered to clean it up and do a few repairs, but it had been a few years since then. To be honest, Kakashi had thought of selling it many times, but in the end he always paused. For one, it was a hassle to go through the trouble of selling it, for another\u2026well it had been his families. He had been born here, he parents had died in here (one in childbirth, one via suicide). It was his families and while Kakashi had doubted he would have more family to fill it, some lingering ghosts and memories had compelled him to leave it be. \n\u201cYup,\u201d Kakashi said with a slightly forced cheerfulness.\n\u201cLooks like a mess,\u201d Naruto declared looking around the small yard before the front of the house. \nAt one pointed it had been a beautiful garden with trimmed trees and flowers. Now it was a wild tangle of dead leaves, weeds, and out of control plants. \n\u201cHaven\u2019t been in here in\u2026hmm must be going on twenty years now.\u201d\nThe stared at him surprised, trying to understand, but he just smiled at them, book tucked away and hands in his pocket. Kakashi made a go-ahead gesture after a long silent moment. The kids cast him looks under their lashes and then looked at one another in silent communication before entering. \nKakashi stayed, leaning against the front gate, and listened as they wound their way through the house, through the traditional rooms and up the narrow stairs. He could hear it when they stomped through the inner courtyard and then leapt to the roof. He couldn\u2019t help the fond smile as they all yelped, suddenly realizing the ninja house was defended against sticking to the roof. \nThe sound of their fall into the pond was hilarious. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a ninja house!\u201d Kakashi yelled over their splutters, \u201cThe roof and the walls and fence are all made to make sure no one can use chakra on them!\u201d\n\u201cNow you tell us!\u201d Naruto howled. \nThy joined him a few minutes later, after they had boosted themselves on the roof without the use of chakra to peer at the tiles and the fence surrounding the property. He decided not to let them know yet that their were seals rigged under tiles and stone and that at any moment he could activate them to send lightening chakra surging through the roof, fence, or gate. That was a well held Hatake secret. \nThe three trooped back up to him, all dripping.\n\u201cNaruto,\u201d Sakura said, \u201cMake at least twenty clones.\u201d\nHe did so, filling the small front yard to the brim. \n\u201cSend some to get supplies,\u201d she further commanded handing him a list.\nKakashi snagged the clones before they could run off and tucked his wallet in their hands with a stern look.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house so you use my money to buy supplies,\u201d he said.\nNaruto shrugged and hurried off. Or well, three clones did. To be honest Kakashi wasn\u2019t sure which one was the real Naruto; that was the beauty of shadow clones. \n\u201cSasuke, do you know how to fix paper doors? And clean tatami mats?\u201d Sakura asked Sasuke, relying on his knowledge of more traditional styled homes.\u201d\nSasuke nodded and was sent off with three clones.\n\u201cThe rest of you,\u201d Sakura said turning to the fifteen Naruto\u2019s, \u201cTwo on this courtyard, five in the back, five for downstairs, and three for upstairs,\u201d \nThe clones all saluted and fell on the pile of cleaning supplies they had all brought for this mission.\n\u201cThere should be yard work tools in the back,\u201d Kakashi called at the outdoor clones. \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget Naruto went off to get plants as well when he gets supplies, so don\u2019t feel bad about uprooting to many,\u201d Sakura added.\nThey gave a war cry and attacked the house as a mob of cleaners. \n\u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d Kakashi asked Sakura.\n\u201cI\u2019m supervisor,\u201d she said with an innocent look, \u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job wrangling Naruto and his clones.\u201d\nHe laughed and ruffled her hair. She batted his hand and then gave him a shove out of the gate.\n\u201cGo get tea of something, sensei. Leave this to us.\u201d\n\u201cMah, I can help,\u201d Kakashi smiled at her.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sakura said putting her foot down in a childish sort of huff, \u201cYou can see it when we\u2019re done, and you have calmed down.\u201d\nHe stared at her, but she glared back, arms crossed.\n\u201cSo smart,\u201d he told her absently, patting her head.\n\u201cGo sensei,\u201d she said gently, \u201cand whatever you hate about this place, we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d\nHe wondered if she was too optimistic. He would never forget the way his father\u2019s blood had pooled on the tatami mats or the way his hair had looked in the dawn sunlight coming through the windows. But\u2026but maybe these three could chase the memories away enough he could enter for the first time in twenty years.\nHe went to get tea to calm himself down. And to say thank you he made sure to order a very nice lunch for the three.\n.--.\nIt took the kids all day to clean up the old Hatake manor, and the only reason they finished in a day is Naruto made a few more clones. Kakashi had had lunch delivered to them as he went to the memorial stone, still a tad unsettled, but he made sure to take them a late dinner himself. \nWhen he arrived at the manor, dusk was drawing closer, but enough light still shined to show him the differences. Someone had also cleaned up the lanterns around the property and lit them all, casting soft glowing light. Sakura met him at the gate, obviously having been forewarned by a clone or Sasuke\u2019s excellent chakra sensing to his arrival. Naruto and Sasuke joined her a moment later as Kakashi admired the front garden.\n\u201cCome see,\u201d she demanded. \nKakashi nodded, took a deep breath discreetly and stepped onto the property.\nThe front yard was back to its former glory with beautiful trimmed trees and blooming flowers set between rocks. Someone had straightened the granite lantern as well as the bench at the back corner. Naruto had even raked the gravel path nicely and it was a sort of calming vision.\nKakashi toed his sandals off and followed his students into the well-lit house. The doors slid easily in their tracks and any wear or tear had been touched up with stain. The floor had been polished to an inch of its life and Kakashi could see they had already replaced a few tatami mats. The kitchen had been scrubbed to gleaming, a small pile of wood stacked to the stove. The table had been washed and Kakashi found it set up with a small vase of flowers. \nEvery window had been cleaned and wiped, all the paper doors fixed and tidied. Even the ceiling looked to have been dusted and wiped with a clean cloth. Sakura said something about replacing a few roof tiles and fixing a leak or two. Naruto made a face and said the bathroom had been scrubbed. \nWhen they led him onto the back porch, looking over the inner courtyard Kakashi paused. This garden had been cleaned, trimmed, and weeded as well. It looked like they had found some more rocks somewhere, and somehow cleaned out the small pond. And if Kakashi wasn\u2019t mistaken\u2026.\n\u201cDid you get new koi?\u201d he asked faintly.\n\u201cSasuke donated them!\u201d Naruto was the one to grin and nod.\nKakashi raised a brow at the dark boy who looked away.\n\u201cI never took care of them,\u201d the boy murmured.\nKakashi looked across the darkening courtyard, lit by granite lanterns tucked inside the garden and lit by paper lanterns that hung from the porch. \n\u201cThe electricity will have to be turned on again,\u201d Sakura remarked, \u201cand maybe checked. It\u2019s old and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a fire hazard. The water will need to be turned on as well, but we used water jutsu to fill the pond.\u201d\n\u201cMah, you talk as if I\u2019m moving in,\u201d Kakashi waved a hand.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked shrewdly.\n\u201cNope!\u201d Kakashi grinned.\n\u201cThen why make us clean it!?\u201d Naruto demanded.\n\u201cBecause you are moving in.\u201d\nThey all froze.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Naruto squeaked. \n\u201cYour apartment is atrocious,\u201d Kakashi smiled at Naruto, \u201cAnd this place is free. You might as well take advantage of that. All you have to pay for here is utilities.\u201d\nNaruto was staring at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all welcome of course,\u201d Kakashi said giving Sakura and Sasuke a look, \u201cI know you all end up hunkered down at Naruto\u2019s half the time.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t look ashamed of the fact they often got together most nights to practice music, or go over lessons that one or the other had trouble with, or even to share a meal. Kakashi had been invited a few times but they needed time alone to bond together and be kids, not students.\n\u201cI know Sakura will want to go home to her parents some days, but nothing wrong with having a bed here as well,\u201d Kakashi continued, \u201cAnd the Uchiha compound is so far out of the way it might be more convenient to have a bed here as well.\u201d\nAs Sasuke looked down Kakashi gave Naruto and Sakura meaningful looks. Kakashi was not happy with Sasuke wallowing in grief and ghosts alone in a large empty compound surrounded by memories of blood and death. But Sasuke was too practical to ever rent an apartment when he had the compound. If Naruto and Sakura pushed though, he would follow. Especially if the place was offered freely. The two gave him curt nods over Sasuke\u2019s shoulders. He hadn\u2019t outright told them such things but they had started to pick up on it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the utilities hooked up again tomorrow,\u201d Kakashi announced, \u201cAnd you can move in.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t phrase it as a question. Didn\u2019t want to give any of them the choice to refuse. When Naruto tackled him in a hug Kakashi beamed at them. \n.--.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Kakashi said, offering an instrument to Sakura. \nNaruto was thumping about somewhere above him, Sasuke following silently, but Sakura had been tucking groceries in the fridge so it was just them in the kitchen. The plumber and electrician had declared the place sound enough and re-hooked up the water and power easily. Kakashi had gotten it put under his name but the Naruto had said strongly that they would pay for them. \nIt was the work of a few clones and an hour for the kids to gather everything they needed to move in and they were now unpacking. One of Naruto\u2019s clones had pulled Kakashi aside and revealed he was worried about Sasuke after seeing the Uchiha manor and how empty and isolating it was. Kakashi merely patted him on the head and told him that they had to make sure Sasuke spent all his time here then. Kakashi was proud of how well Naruto had taken stock of his teammates situation. The Naruto from before would not have known Sasuke enough or been observant enough to notice such a thing. \nSo Naruto had bullied Sasuke into moving most of his stuff to this place, making him take up the room next to Naruto\u2019s. Even Sakura had moved a great deal of her stuff in, leaving the bare minimum at her parents. Sasuke had even graciously given her an extra futon from his own manor so she would have a permanent bed here.\nSakura looked at Kakashi from where she was putting their combined food stuffs away in the kitchen and only reached out when Kakashi continued holding the instrument out. She took it, running her fingers over the cherry colored wood and the pink sakura patterns on the silk side.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she breathed, fingers running over the strings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours now,\u201d Kakashi smiled.\n\u201cKakashi-sensei! I can\u2019t accept this! It looks expensive!\u201d she protested, aghast.\n\u201cI got it for free,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully.\nSakura wavered looking at the beautiful instrument she couldn\u2019t afford on her own pay cheque and her will crumbled. \n\u201cThank you, I promise to take care of it,\u201d she said solemnly.\n\u201cYou better,\u201d he teased, \u201cOr my Mother\u2019s ghost may haunt you.\u201d\nHer eyes flew wide and surprised and he vanished in a swirl of leaves before she could insist on giving it back again, running off to help Naruto and Sasuke.\n.--.\n\u201cHow many are we at?\u201d Kakashi asked as his kids handed in the last D-rank mission scroll for the day.\n\u201c28,\u201d Sakura said instantly. \n\u201cGood good, we\u2019ll come back tomorrow then for one final sweep.\u201d\nThe chunin at the desk groaned. There were no rules saying they couldn\u2019t take all the missions in one day as long as it even out over a week, but he had to deal with the teams who had planned to do a mission getting hissy when there were none. \nHis kids merely smiled innocently at the groaning chunin and followed him like ducklings back into the street.\n.--.\nSasuke had brought his mother\u2019s Koto along to the Hatake manor, and finally pulled it out one evening. Naruto and Sakura oohed and awed over the quality of it as Sasuke flushed proudly. \nSakura had tried returning the Shamisen a few times in the last couple of days but Kakashi pretended to be deaf and blind every time she brought the topic up much to the amusement of Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi had also got Naruto a new bamboo flute was what he told her whenever she pushed. She spluttered saying it wasn\u2019t the same but he just ruffled their hair. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kakashi flopped down onto the cushion set on the deck, \u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing for weeks. Let\u2019s hear what Katsuya taught you in Wave.\u201d\nThe three snapped to attention sending looks to one another. Sasuke settled the Koto gently on the polished wood porch and settled on his own cushion. Sakura sat formally in the seiza, close to Sasuke and set the shamisen on her lap, bochi in hand. Naruto sat much less formally, legs hanging over the edge of the porch. \nEvening had settled a while ago and the sun was gone. The only light came from the living room, the paper doors thrown open so the light fell onto the porch, and the paper lanterns Sakura liked to light. The soft sound of the rain muffled the sounds of Konoha as the rain that had been spiting all day fell heavier in the nightfall.\nSakura took a deep breath, looked at the boys who nodded, and struck the strings, sending note trilling.\nKakashi listened, slouched on his cushion, book nowhere to be seen. It hit him, as he sat with a cup of steaming tea near his hand and his three students starting up a song, perfectly in sync, that he was \u2026happy. The sound of rain and the traditional instruments, looking at his students concentrated faces, feeling safe and content, Kakashi realized he was actually happy.\nHis heart felt light and he let himself relax to the music and Kakashi breathed easily for the first time in a very long time\n.--.\n\u201cThe chunin exam will take place in three days as you well know,\u201d the Hokage announced to the assembled crowd of jonin, \u201cYou have all been given your duties and assignments.\u201d\nKakashi glanced across the room idly, taking in the fact most of Konoha\u2019s jonin were packed into the room. It seemed the Hokage had recalled all Jonin back to Konoha for extra security for this exam. Not unusual. \n\u201cAdditionally, any sensei who would nominate entries into the exam may now step forward.\u201d\nThere was the usual shuffling as people glanced about, unwilling to be the first ones to draw attention to themselves. Most waited as well to see who was assured of their team enough to entire. It would hold up a marker of what level was generally expected.\n\u201cI nominate, Team Seven,\u201d Kakashi said cheerfully, snapping his book shut.\nUmino Iruka, the Hokage\u2019s favored chunin and paper-work nin outside of the academy, spluttered from where he was busy writing down the Hokage\u2019s words. \n\u201cThey are six months out of the academy,\u201d the man hissed, \u201cYou think they\u2019re ready for this exam?!\u201d\nKakashi eyed him, looking at the Hokage\u2019s smile. Umino Iruka was a very loyal and very proficient ninja, one of the reasons the Hokage blatantly favored him. He also had a protective streak which had made him an asset in the academy. Iruka may have only held the rank of chunin due to skill level, but Kakashi was absolutely sure his clearance level and political power was well beyond that. \nIruka was a dangerous man to cross.\nKakashi merely smiled at him. The Hokage watched with a fond sort of amusement, silent even as they took over the meeting. No one even thought to get between the Hokage\u2019s two favored ninja in this argument. Especially not with the Hokage tolerating, if not actively encouraging, it. \n\u201cYou think they aren\u2019t?\u201d Kakashi asked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re children.\u201d\n\u201cAs are all the students you graduate. That does not mean they are not ready.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had barely six months of training under you!\u201d\n\u201cAnd it has been intensive training,\u201d Kakashi said flatly, smile slipping away, \u201cI have trained them to be soldiers and shinobi and they are damned good. They are more than ready for the chunin exams. Do you doubt me Umino?\u201d\nIruka finally huffed, winding down. While he may hiss and spit all he wanted, challenging Kakashi in subtle words, even he would not question Kakashi when it came down to it. Iruka was a quick witted man and he knew with certainty that no good would come from challenging Kakashi\u2019s professional opinion and decisions.\nKakashi met his gaze and Iruka finally bowed out, writing the nomination down. \nKakashi saw the other jonin exchange silent looks, obviously breaking down the argument. He also saw the other jonin sensei hesitating now, having heard the conviction in his words. Kakashi had made sure he was 100% sure Team Seven was ready. This was no wishy washy test run for them to try in the safety of their own village. While the majority would nominate their teams just for them to see the exam in the more relaxed environment of their home territory, many would not expect their teams to pass. \nKakashi expected his team to dominate.\n.--.\n\u201cWell, that makes a nice even 35,\u201d Kakashi brushed his hands cheerfully.\n\u201c35 isn\u2019t an even number in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Sakura glowered at him. \n\u201cIt is now,\u201d Kakashi declared.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Sasuke muttered under his breath.\n\u201cAnything I say makes sense,\u201d scolded Kakashi.\nThey all rolled their eyes at him and he grinned.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s go pick up your armor.\u201d \nThey followed him through the streets, picked up their armor with many thanks for Yamada, and retreated to their training grounds to tug it on.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been three weeks since we arrived back in Konoha,\u201d Kakashi announced as the kids pulled on their footwear, \u201cAnd you may have noticed I was pushing you hard to finish D-ranks and smooth out all your training.\u201d\nThey focused on him instantly, all going still as they sensed he had something important to say. Kakashi only spoke long groups of sentences when he had an important lesson and they had all taken to concentrating when he started in on more than just a few sentences. \n\u201cAnd I got you armored up and prepared,\u201d Kakashi continued.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell us you\u2019re dropping us back off in the woods,\u201d Naruto moaned in despair. \n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Kakashi said lightly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a no,\u201d Sakura eyed him like he was a wolf; all sharp teeth.\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not allowed to say whether or not there will be a forest in which you get dropped off in,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cAs in really am not allowed to say that there is a good chance.\u201d\nThey stared at him wide eyed and he let them evaluate that for a minute.\n\u201cI\u2019ve entered you in the chunin exams,\u201d Kakashi finally announced, holding up three forms.\nThey all froze, staring at the papers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in two days,\u201d he smiled.\nThey stared, aghast, and he saw panic and awe and excitement all start to creep in together.\n\u201cSo, if you want to enter, here are the forms.\u201d\nThey took them, all staring holes in the paper.\n\u201cYou have tomorrow off to prepare. If you decide to enter, you need to be at the academy at 9am the day after. 3rd floor, your old classroom.\u201d\nSakura looked up at him, lips pressed in a narrow line as Sasuke read the paper religiously. Naruto was starting to grin.\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019re ready?\u201d Sakura asked carefully, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s in Konoha which makes it a safer test run to participate in than any other country, but are we really actually ready?\u201d\nHe offered her a grin and ruffled her hair.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he smiled.\nShe beamed. Naruto grinned behind her and even Sasuke smiled, pleased.\n.--.\nKakashi felt the intrusion before even the first knock, sensing the miniscule but revealing flare of chakra that was almost unnoticeable in the village of ninja. Kakashi stood and flashed a few signs at his students so as not to alarm them and was at the door in a moment, smiling in welcome at the two shadowed figures standing inside his gate.\n\u201cHokage-sama, Umino. Would you like tea?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d the Hokage smiled.\nKakashi held the door open and they entered toeing their sandals off to follow him down the hall. Kakashi led them to the back garden where Sakura had already pulled out extra cushions for their guests. Sasuke had went to the kitchen to fetch tea at the sound of their conversation. \n\u201cJiji!\u201d Naruto crowed happily, reaching for a hug.\nThe Hokage readily folded him in an embrace and smiled a lot more genuinely as Naruto babbled something about his day. Naruto went for Umino next and Kakashi watched in interest as Umino\u2019s smile softened and deepened from politeness into fondness. Umino and he often clashed for the fact that Kakashi treated all shinobi as soldiers and tools in various situations. Kakashi was a field commander, a war veteran, and a genius. He was also a pessimist at times, or a realist in his own mind, and as such he could be harsh and cold at times and he knew it brushed Umino the wrong way. Umino was a man of empathy and emotion who probably cared a tad too much for his students (not that Kakashi could say that anymore without being a hypocrite). \nThey had just never gotten along.\n\u201cThank you Sasuke,\u201d the Sandaime said as Sasuke gracefully set a tray down and served the elder tea. \nUmino likewise gave a wide smile and a thank you. \n\u201cDid we interrupt something?\u201d the Hokage asked sipping his tea.\nKakashi cast a glance about at the abandoned instruments as the three genin sat together and listened respectfully. Good to see his lessons on patience and manners were working as well. \n\u201cJust some practice,\u201d Kakashi smiled, \u201cWould you like to see?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! I learned the flute Jiji!\u201d Naruto crowed diving for said flute.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear then,\u201d the Hokage laughed.\nNaruto, Sakura, and Sasuke took up position and picked up their instruments with nervous-excited fingers. They exchanged glances, Naruto vibrating with energy and Sakura showing the open nervousness while Sasuke went stone-faced. The first notes were struck and Kakashi watched all the tension melt away as his kids fell into their relaxing hobby. With half an eye Kakashi watched as Umino\u2019s expression morphed into astonishment and joy, watching the three kids like a fond parent. \nPutting Umino in the academy had been a good idea, even with his other use as the perfect bureaucrat. He felt too much for the kids to ever be put on active missions with them; he\u2019d go rogue in an instant for any of his kid\u2019s safety. But that nurturing and care worked perfectly to mold future ninja who were loyal, who looked at their caring instructors with fondness. \nUmino clapped happily as the kids finished and the Hokage gave them all a wide smile and congratulated them.\n\u201cNaruto, why don\u2019t you and Sasuke do that duet you learned,\u201d Kakashi said, \u201cSakura, maybe you could grab the mochi from the kitchen.\u201d\nHis kids obeyed with only a few sideways glances. Kakashi stood and held the door open for the Hokage to show him inside. They left Naruto and Sasuke picking up a jaunty tune, the music drowning out their footsteps as Kakashi led the Hokage to what was a neat and tidy little office. It was where all their rogue scrolls and paper work were filed. Kakashi had been trying to teach his students the art of filing and keeping track of finances and missions properly. \n\u201cWhat brings you out this late Hokage-sama,\u201d Kakashi asked, offering the chair at the desk to the man. \nThe Hokage sat down, hands tucked carefully in his sleeve and Kakashi carefully sat on the floor, seiza. The Hokage did not do house visits. Unless it was a formal meeting or dinner. Or punishment. Kakashi kept his hands on his knees, kept his chakra carefully controlled, and waited for whatever was to be said. \nThe Hokage sighed faintly, glancing about the room.\n\u201cYou have taught your students well,\u201d the Hokage said, \u201cI had high hopes in you; I\u2019m glad they weren\u2019t unfounded.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kakashi said simply.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the past week,\u201d the Hokage said, flipping idly through a mission report on the desk, \u201cYou have made, what was a disaster of a team on paper, into a well-oiled machine. They have teamwork, they have respect for authority, they are more loyal than ever before. I had\u2026\u201d\nThe Hokage paused, frowned. Kakashi waited for the other shoe to drop even as a faint trace of pride welled in him. \n\u201cI had my doubts about the team. The civilian raised girl, the broken Uchiha, the Kyuubi jinchuriki. A political powder keg of a team. But you did what you do best Kakashi; you preached teamwork and left no man behind. You have made a team I think is on the way to greatness.\u201d\nThe Hokage paused again, sighed and rubbed wearily at his face.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given them weakness too,\u201d the Hokage said calmly.\n\u201cWeakness?\u201d Kakashi questioned.\n\u201cThey are like you,\u201d the Hokage said pointedly.\nAt first there was pride, but it withered to ash on his tongue and Kakashi abruptly felt sick.\n\u201cWhen one of them dies, the others will fall apart just like you,\u201d the Hokage said not unkindly. \nKakashi could not help his flinch. Kakashi knew the failure of his own genin team. Knew how the world had crumbled and greyed and Kakashi had been the only one to walk away. He had learned to care and learned what caring too deeply did all in only a few years. He carried those regrets every day. But he had survived. He had survived and fought and was still loyal to Konoha.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t shatter,\u201d he said, words like poison in his gut.\nNot like me, he didn\u2019t say.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d the Hokage allowed, before giving the finishing blow; \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to all die together.\u201d\nKakashi looked down at his hands and tried to hide his trembling. There was a scream building up in his throat, of horror, of denial. \n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d the Hokage sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t say you did wrong. Of all the shinobi in this village, they will need bonds that strong the most.\u201d\nBut Kakashi couldn\u2019t agree anymore. What if he has just molded them into his old team? One dies and they all fall like dominos with one shattered husk remaining. \n\u201cHatake Kakashi,\u201d the Hokage said solemnly, \u201cI have a mission for you.\u201d\nThe Hokage has always held Kakashi\u2019s leash, always known how to make him focus. And so Kakashi snapped out of his doubts and snapped to attention. He could scream later, could worry his way into being sick later. But for now, his Hokage was commanding him.\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI will need your full attention for this,\u201d the Hokage said looking solemn, \u201cI have only trusted three other people with this information.\u201d\nKakashi slipped into the cool controlled veneer that had gotten him in and out of ANBU alive.\n\u201cI am yours to command, Hokage-sama!\u201d he bowed.\n\u201cGood. The chunin exams,\u201d the Hokage started.\nKakashi sat perfectly still as the Hokage delivered his information, delivered his mission. In the very end the Hokage stood and handed him a small security locked scroll. Kakashi checked the authenticity and then summoned Pakkun to take the scroll somewhere safe. The Hokage clasped Kakashi\u2019s shoulder and gave it a firm squeeze, eyes dark and sad all at once.\n\u201cI am counting on you Hatake Kakashi,\u201d he said solemnly. \n\u201cI will not fail you sir,\u201d Kakashi saluted.\n\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go get back to the genin. I can feel their agitation from here.\u201d\nWhen they returned to the porch Naruto had eaten half the mochi and Umino was showing Sakura a tune on the shamisen. Sasuke was sitting, carefully looking like he wasn\u2019t tracking Kakashi by his chakra signature. \n\u201cShall we hear another song before we go for the night,\u201d the Hokage smiled.\nKakashi watched his students clamor to obey and carefully did not look at Umino or the Hokage again. \n.--.\nKakashi looked at the three nervous faces before him and pretended he didn\u2019t feel any of the same nervousness. Sakura was working the hem of her kimono shirt, Naruto was fidgeting, and Sasuke was looking everywhere but anyone\u2019s faces. They had slipped up the walls of the academy, bypassing the pre-test of genjutsu so easily and still looked so anxious. His cute little students.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Kakashi asked, no hint of humor in his voice.\n\u201cTeam seven!\u201d Naruto cheered.\n\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cNo one gets left behind,\u201d Sakura said, sure and still. \n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd everyone must live,\u201d Sasuke whispered fists clenching. \nKakashi crouched to look them in the eyes, face still solemn.\n\u201cRemember, the team before the mission,\u201d he told them, heartfelt.\nThey looked at him, all wide eyes and childish faces with weapons in their hands and power in their fists. He looked at their odd little uniforms and the armor he had purchased to protect their breakable bones and organs. He thought back on the Hokage\u2019s words, though of the idea that he had molded them into his old team. And he shook the thought away. Maybe he had indeed bred weakness into them, but there were worse things for a ninja to be then reliant on teammates, in and out of combat. Each of them would have struggled alone, would have faced a harsh world all alone, but he had brought them together at the very least; given them teammates to rely upon and all the knowledge they could need to survive.\nKakashi looked at them and finally, finally he didn\u2019t see his old team. He didn\u2019t see the dead looking out.\nInstead he saw Team Seven. He saw his students. He saw the living.\n\u201cGo give them hell,\u201d Kakashi smiled, soft and loving.\nThey smiled back and Kakashi\u2019s heart finally seemed to find a hold in his chest.
