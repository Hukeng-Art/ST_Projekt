Cue a torn James Potter, who really wants to hate the kid because he\u2019s a Slytherin and a Malfoy and not that Weasely girl, come on Harry, he liked her. But on the other hand, HE LOVES QUIDDITCH AND HES A SEEKER AND A BLOODY GOOD ONE AT THAT, and he sides with James on debates about players that he always loses against Lily and Harry, so James is very torn about whether he wants to kill the kid or ask him to move in.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Warnings for massive, massive canon divergence. But this was so much fun, I really don't care.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Okay, so...I admit I went a little OOC with Harry not liking Quidditch as much as he does in canon. My reasoning was that maybe a Harry who grew up with his father, instead of trying to find a connection with him in every little thing James ever touched, may be less connected to Quidditch in this AU. I thought it worked alright, but if you disagree, I can totally get that.</p>",
    "text": "The entire house smelled like garlic and spices. James wrinkled his nose but wisely kept his silence. He had been informed \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 how monumentally important this dinner was, and he was not stupid enough to get between Lily and her over-seasoning. Not when she\u2019d finally got the roast in the oven and succumbed to a small meltdown over pudding. Instead, he focused on fishing the good silverware out of the cupboards and oh-so-subtly prying for information.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again?\u201d\nLily hummed thoughtfully as she added six \u2014 six cinnamon sticks \u2014 to her mulled wine concoction. James felt his throat clench in protest but he managed to keep a straight face and focus on his wife.\n\u201cDraco, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lily mused thoughtfully. \u201cUnusual name, but\u2026I think I like it. Very old-fashioned.\u201d\nJames snorted. Yeah, old-fashioned was one way to describe the Malfoys. Also, uptight, puritanical, snobbish and so painfully conformist he\u2019d bet they still brewed their tea in brass cauldrons and bestowed ceremonial beatings on their house-elves. In summation, he was not a fan and he didn\u2019t understand how Lily could be so calm about all of\u2026well, this.\n\u201cDoes this wine look right to you?\u201d Lily asked, cocking her head and frowning at the bubbling, frothy mess on the stove-top. \u201cAlice said to\u2026you know, never mind. I\u2019ll just throw in some more star anise, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do we really know about this kid?\u201d James asked, in a last ditch attempt to distract her. Lily turned to him and he promptly seized an opportunity to edge in around her and rescue the wine. \u201cYou know,\u201d he coaxed as he stirred some brandy in, \u201cother than the basics.\u201d\n\u201cHarry only gave me the footnotes when he called,\u201d she admitted, crossing her arms and leaning against the counter. \u201cThey knew each other at Hogwarts, didn\u2019t always get along. You know, Gryffindor, Slytherin\u2026that kind of thing. Oh!\u201d She snapped her fingers, making James jump a little. \u201cDo you remember that one time McGonagall called us when Harry got the bad end of a Jelly Legs Jinx? Apparently, that was him.\u201d\nUnderstandably, this didn\u2019t do much to reassure James. \u201cSo he\u2019s a Slytherin, he\u2019s Lucius Malfoy\u2019s son and he hexed my kid,\u201d he listed off dryly. \u201cRemind me, why are we letting this boy in the house again?\u201d\nLily scoffed incredulously. \u201cReally, James?\u201d she quipped. \u201cYou want to talk about pulling pigtails in the school-yard?\u201d Okay, so she had him there. Lily smirked victoriously and nudged him out of the way with her hip. \u201cIf it helps at all, I\u2019m sure your son gave as good as he got. Besides, it was years ago. They\u2019re all grown up now and they\u2019ve been dating for months. And you \u2013\u201d she gave him a pointed look \u2013 \u201care going to behave yourself. It\u2019s not every day Harry asks to bring someone to dinner. The only other one who got that far was little Miss What\u2019s-Her-Face.\u201d\n\u201cCho Chang?\u201d James put in helpfully. He remembered the bright, young brunette from about a year ago. Pretty, smart, solid Puddlemere U fan\u2026he\u2019d actually liked her. Lily, on the other hand\u2026James snorted. \u201cYou just don\u2019t like her because she said your chicken was a little dry.\u201d Lily glared at him and he wisely changed the subject. \u201cHow about the Weasley girl? Wasn\u2019t Harry seeing her? She was cute.\u201d\nLily rolled her eyes. \u201cVery. I\u2019m sure Nymphadora agrees, considering they\u2019re sharing a flat in Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d James perked up at the mention of Tonks. The kid was his best Auror, now that Kingsley had officially moved on to politics. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were friends.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re lesbians, James.\u201d\nWait, what? James gaped at her and threw his arms up in incredulous defeat. \u201cHow come I never know these things?\u201d\nLily shrugged. \u201cIt took you four years to figure out Sirius and Moony were together, you tell me.\u201d Her green eyes lit up speculatively. \u201cYou know, if you really want to complain about Draco, I\u2019ll bet Padfoot will join you. He loves bitching about family, you know that.\u201d\nThat\u2026wasn\u2019t the worst idea, actually. Didn\u2019t Padfoot\u2019s fright of a cousin end up with Lucius Malfoy? That meant Draco was probably his second cousin. Or nephew. Or something. If the boy was hiding some dark, potentially deal-breaking secret, Padfoot would know for sure. He still kept tabs on estranged relatives\u2014 a precautionary measure James heartily endorsed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just head over for a check in, get the lay of the land, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou do that, Head Auror.\u201d Lily\u2019s answering laugh was all amusement and fond exasperation. \u201cBut be back in an hour. The boys will be here by then, and I need you to set the table.\u201d\nGreat. So, Malfoy Junior was officially one of the boys now. James\u2019s mouth twisted. This was starting to get out of hand. Clearly, he had work to do if he wanted to contain this situation. So, he nodded to himself and stole a kiss from his beautiful wife. \u201cI\u2019ll leave right now.\u201d\n\u201cGood. And I\u2019ll get back to my recipe.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, Alice Longbottom\u2019s recipe.\u201d\nLily gave him another kiss and her lips quirked in a soft, dangerous smile. \u201cJames, darling? You\u2019re the love of my life but if you don\u2019t get out of my kitchen right now, I will hex you.\u201d\nPoint taken.\nJames grabbed his coat and headed to the Floo.\n\u00a0\nIn minutes, he was comfortably ensconced in an armchair at his best friends\u2019 flat, twirling a glass of Ogden\u2019s and watching tiny Teddy play with his blocks. Teddy gurgled happily and waved a chubby fist at the grown-ups. James couldn\u2019t help but smile fondly. Godric, had Harry ever been this little? Every time he saw Teddy, his heart soared with happiness for his friends. It had taken years before they were even seriously considered for adoption, thanks to Remus\u2019s affliction. But Teddy was here at last, and they couldn\u2019t be happier. James raised his glass in a silent toast before turning to Sirius.\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d he declared ominously. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d\nSirius made a wibbly-wobbly gesture with his hands before succumbing to a disinterested shrug. \u201cMeh.\u201d\n\u201cMeh?\u201d James echoed. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got for me? He\u2019s your cousin!\u201d\n\u201cOr nephew,\u201d Sirius drawled consideringly. \u201cOr something. I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Prongsy. I barely know him. Reg\u2019s the one who keeps up with that side of the family.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did your creepy little brother have to say about Draco Malfoy?\u201d James demanded. Teddy gurgled urgently and toddled over to his father. James bit back on a resigned sigh as Sirius was immediately distracted. He Shifted \u2014 much to Teddy\u2019s delight \u2014 and barked affably, nuzzling and fussing as the child grabbed at his fur with tiny fists.\n\u201cSirius.\u201d Remus entered, sighing and shaking his head disapprovingly. \u201cHow many times\u2026if you rile him up right before bed, he won\u2019t sleep all night.\u201d\nSirius yipped apologetically and Shifted back. \u201cSorry, love,\u201d he grinned, placating his husband with a sweet kiss and settling back down with the baby.\nRemus gave him a fond look and took a seat too, shifting his attention to James easily. \u201cWhy the sudden interest in Draco Malfoy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat, I\u2019m not allowed to enquire about my son\u2019s former classmates or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cProngs.\u201d\nJames held up his hands in defeat at Moony\u2019s warning tone. They\u2019d collectively learned a long time ago that The Tone was not to be ignored. \u201cFine. Harry\u2019s dating him and he\u2019s coming to dinner. I\u2019m just trying to figure out this kid\u2019s deal. Did you know he used to hex Harry back at Hogwarts?\u201d\nRemus cocked his head. \u201cAs far as I remember, Harry hexed him right back. Of course, I only taught them DADA for one term before I quit, but\u2026they sort of reminded me of you and Lily at that age.\u201d His lips twitched at James\u2019s noticeably sour expression. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d James declared with genuine amazement. \u201cYou two are no help at all.\u201d\nSirius didn\u2019t look too broken up about it. \u201cReg did bring him up at dinner one time. He said he\u2019s alright. Which coming from him\u2026well, you know.\u201d\nJames did know. Sirius\u2019s younger brother was notoriously anti-social. Their eventual reconciliation hadn\u2019t done much to soften him up. Allegedly, Teddy was the only one who could get a half-smile out of the dour man. If even Regulus I-hate-everything Black had something halfway decent to say about Malfoy then\u2026\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d James declared firmly. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m going to have to crack this case myself.\u201d\n\u201cOr,\u201d Remus chided, \u201cyou could just get to know the boy with an open mind.\u201d\nJames gave him a blank look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all, do you?\u201d\nHe glanced at Padfoot \u2014 a normally reliable source of support \u2014 but all he got was another shrug. \u201cHarry\u2019s got good instincts,\u201d Sirius pointed out.\nMaybe, but that didn\u2019t stop a father from worrying. That\u2019s just how it was. His one job in the world was to protect Harry and keep him safe. Now he was all grown up and dating and that was bad enough but a Malfoy? There was no way this ended well for Harry. That boy was obviously using him, or worse.\nAnd James was going to figure his game out if it was the last thing he did.\n\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d he told them. \u201cGot to take care of this.\u201d\nRemus sighed and Sirius smirked and raised a glass. They watched as James disappeared through the fireplace.\n\u201cLily\u2019s going to kill him if he ruins dinner,\u201d Remus remarked in the silence.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll pull through,\u201d Sirius chuckled. \u201cYou have to admit, it\u2019s rough when your kids start dating.\u201d Teddy cooed and planted a grubby hand on his cheek. Sirius\u2019s laughter trailed off into a soft smile and he planted an affectionate kiss to his son\u2019s head. \u201cGood thing that\u2019s a long, long way off for us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen James stumbled out of the Floo, it was to the sounds of conversation and laughter.\n\u201cDad!\u201d Harry exclaimed, heading straight for him. \u201cYou made it!\u201d\nBefore James could blink, he was being enveloped in a crushing hug. His heart warmed and he immediately moved to embrace his boy. Harry was so tall now, it felt like he grew a little more every time James saw him. It was almost hard to remember a time when he\u2019d barely come up to his father\u2019s knee. The thought made him tighten his hold just a little more.\n\u201cI missed you too, kiddo,\u201d he murmured, ruffling Harry\u2019s hair a bit. It was just as messy and unkempt as his own. Those shining green eyes though\u2026that was all Lily.\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Harry demanded petulantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting ages.\u201d\nIt was the we that brought him back. James cleared his throat and disentangled himself to peer over his son\u2019s shoulder. Lily grinned and winked at him, before gesturing subtly to her right.\nAnd there he was.\n\u201cMr. Potter,\u201d Draco Malfoy cleared his throat, stepped forward and extended his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour, sir. Harry\u2019s told me so much about you.\u201d\nHuh.\nJames gave it a good five seconds before taking the proffered hand and shaking it firmly. He took his time, sizing up this\u2026interloper in their midst. So this was Draco Malfoy. Dressed in tailored robes sporting the Malfoy crest...well, James had to admit he certainly looked the part. Grey eyes, sharp features, white blond hair \u2014 yeah, that was all Lucius Malfoy. The resemblance made his eyes narrow in well-founded suspicion.\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d he intoned gruffly, when Lily raised a meaningful eyebrow at him. \u201cWelcome to our home.\u201d\nThe for now went unsaid, but he\u2019d like to think it was heavily implied.\n\u201dThank you, sir,\u201d Malfoy replied, all eloquence and politeness. Oh, he was smooth. And by the looks of it, he already had Lily and Harry eating out the palm of his hand. James\u2019s jaw tightened. Draco Malfoy, he decided, would soon find out that he was a much harder nut to crack.\nLily seemed to have sensed some underlying tension because she quickly stepped in. \u201cIt\u2019s so wonderful to finally meet you, Draco,\u201d she said, kind and trusting as always. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking forward to this dinner all week.\u201d\nMalfoy was quick to jump on the offered bone. \u201cThe pleasure\u2019s all mine, Mrs. Potter,\u201d he replied, bestowing another smooth, clearly practiced smile on Lily. Her eyes lit up, and so did Harry\u2019s. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too forward, I brought a little something for your table.\u201d James bit back on a scoff as Malfoy produced a massive bouquet of Madonna Lilies and offered them to\u2026oh right, lilies for Lily.\nCute.\n\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Lily exclaimed in delight. \u201cOh Draco, you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d\nHarry smiled proudly and laced his fingers with Malfoy\u2019s, and that\u2019s when James decided he had to say something.\n\u201cInteresting choice,\u201d he said stonily. \u201cI mean, lilies are a funeral flower.\u201d\nHarry stared at him. Malfoy blinked but quickly recovered with a small, sheepish smile. As for Lily\u2026well, it took all his Auror training not to quail at the look she gave him. James swallowed. Suddenly, his throat felt very dry. Where was that over-spiced mulled wine when he needed it?\n\u201cOh, you never know, darling,\u201d Lily said, light and breezy and utterly menacing. \u201cThey might just come in handy.\u201d With that sorted, she gave them all another dazzling smile and proceeded to usher everyone into the dining room, effectively dispelling the awkward silence. \u201cWell, I hope everyone\u2019s built up an appetite! Draco dear, sit anywhere you like. Oh and Harry, be a lamb and fetch me a vase for these gorgeous lilies.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDinner progressed, as dinners tend to do. James glared sullenly into his wine, resolutely ignoring the conversation around him despite Lily\u2019s watchful eye. Everyone seemed to be doing just fine without his input anyway. Malfoy was having no trouble holding court. So far, he\u2019d been a model guest \u2014 making easy conversation, showering Lily with compliments on everything from her Charms work to the food, liberally summoning wine\u2026no doubt it was all those etiquette lessons Lucius Malfoy had obviously sprung for.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t even the worst part. The boy was sitting right next to Harry and \u2014 despite their laughable attempts to be respectfully discrete \u2014 they clearly couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other. Every time James looked over, they were brushing shoulders or exchanging soft smiles and glances or lacing their fingers together. Harry was clearly besotted by the kid, and as much as he hated to admit it, Malfoy seemed to honestly return the sentiment. It was all kinds of terrible.\nJames wasn\u2019t sure he could take it anymore. He speared a piece of roast with his fork and choked it down, coughing around the liberally seasoned meat.\n\u201cAllow me, Mr. Potter,\u201d Malfoy piped up on cue, sending a glass of wine his way. James managed a half wave in grudging thanks as he took a hearty swig.\nHarry laughed and nudged Lily playfully. \u201cWent a bit wild with the seasoning again, Mum?\u201d\n\u201cOh, hush you,\u201d Lily scolded, with a smile in her voice. She passed Malfoy the potatoes and rolled her eyes. \u201cYou see what I put up with?\u201d\nMalfoy smiled and took a liberal helping. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it personally, Mrs. Potter. Everything\u2019s delicious. Some people just don\u2019t have an\u2026adventurous palate.\u201d\nJames scowled. Was that a dig? It sounded like a dig. But Malfoy was looking at Harry now, grinning teasingly at him.\n\u201cOh, here we go.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cHere\u2019s a tip, Mum. Never try Draco\u2019s Pad Thai. I fed some to one of Hagrid\u2019s Fire Salamanders once and it exploded.\u201d\nLily laughed over Malfoy\u2019s protests of exaggeration. The conversation drifted from there, going from food to music to travel\u2026apparently, Malfoy had cheffed at a dive bar in Bangkok, played the cello, spoke fluent German and he and Harry were planning their first trip to Prague soon. James listened to it all, just waiting for this suave, smooth talking little serpent to slip up so he could pin him down.\n\u201cSo, Malfoy,\u201d he broke in, when the conversation lulled. \u201cWhat is it you do exactly?\u201d\nMalfoy blinked, apparently surprised at the direct address. Fair enough, considering James had done an excellent job avoiding him all night. \u201cI\u2019m training to be a Curse Breaker, sir,\u201d he answered carefully. \u201cI\u2019m finishing my apprenticeship with the goblins next week, actually.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good,\u201d Harry continued, smiling fondly at Malfoy. \u201cBill Weasley says he\u2019s a shoo-in for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a noble profession,\u201d James cut in pointedly. Harry frowned and glanced uncertainly at Lily, who pursed her lips. James kept his penetrating gaze trained on Malfoy. \u201cFunny, I had you figured for a politician. Like your old man.\u201d\n\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Harry began.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Malfoy murmured, squeezing his hand gently. He turned back to James. \u201cThat\u2026was the plan for a long time,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMy father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and I didn\u2019t really see any reason not to.\u201d\n\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d Lily asked.\nMalfoy smiled faintly and turned to Harry. \u201cHe did,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHarry\u2019s always so\u2026he just does what makes him happy. He could have been an Auror like you, Mr. Potter. It would have been safe, sensible thing to do.\u201d He glanced briefly at James. \u201cBut he wanted to work with Magical Creatures, so that\u2019s what he did. Honestly, I thought he was mad but\u2026I realised that he\u2019d inspired me. Harry made me want to find my own way. He showed me that I didn\u2019t have to be what was expected of me. So, after a bit of soul searching, I told my parents I was going to be a Curse Breaker and that was it. Of course, Father was not happy but\u2026I am.\u201d His smile widened and he bussed a kiss to Harry\u2019s cheek. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\nHarry stared at his boyfriend with wide, shining eyes. \u201cYou never told me any of that,\u201d he said softly. Malfoy managed a sheepish grin and Harry leaned into him. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nThey indulged in a sweet, unhurried kiss and Lily sniffed and dabbed her eyes. She gave James a watery smile and gestured to them. He could almost hear her unspoken you see?\nThat was it. That was the moment he officially gave up. The boy was as good as adopted at this point, so why even fight it? Clearly, Draco was everything Harry and Lily wanted so who was he to stand in the way?\nJames drained the rest of his wine and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some air,\u201d he announced.\nHarry broke away from Malfoy and blinked at him. \u201cDad?\u201d\nBut James was already out the door.\n\u00a0\nAll things considered, it was a nice night. James sat on the porch of Godric\u2019s Hollow, alone with his thoughts. The small wireless he\u2019d pilfered from the living room crackled cheerfully beside him. The Semi-Finals were tonight and he had his money on Puddlemere.\n\u201cMr. Potter?\u201d\nJames started at the soft, cultured voice. He didn\u2019t turn around to look, nor did he react when Draco approached hesitantly, settling beside him on the porch. Honestly, the kid even managed to make slumping on a porch look elegant.\nJames sighed heavily.\nNo wonder they liked each other so much. Harry was wild and spontaneous and carefree, and Draco was cultured and poised and polished. Wasn\u2019t that a thing, opposites attract? It must be, he decided. What other explanation could there possibly be for Moony and Padfoot?\nThe train of thought made him chuckle a bit \u2014 which no doubt concerned Draco judging by his discrete side-eye.\n\u201cI swear I\u2019m not always this crazy,\u201d James explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand, when you\u2019re a parent someday.\u201d\nDraco nodded although it didn\u2019t look like he got it. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d he asked finally.\n\u201cNo,\u201d James answered at once, because really, he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. He was just a kid who wanted his boyfriend\u2019s parents to like him. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t, Draco. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like me,\u201d Draco said. He sounded so resigned about it, like hoping for anything more was pointless.\nJames felt guilt coil deep inside him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI think\u2026I think I had this idea of you and I just ran with it.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought I\u2019d be more like my father,\u201d Draco concluded. He was sharp, James had to give him that. \u201cIf it helps, sir, you\u2019re not the first.\u201d\n\u201cLook, kid. I don\u2019t mean to go after your old man. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI understand. My family can be\u2026and yours is\u2026I suppose it was too much to ask to get along right from the start.\u201d He gave James a cautious glance. \u201cMaybe we just need to spend more time together?\u201d James shrugged in reply and Draco took a deep breath, clearly steeling himself for what he had to say next. \u201cLook, Mr. Potter. I realise you might not want to hear this right now, but I think it\u2019s important for you to know. Harry\u2026he\u2019s my everything. He means the world to me and \u2014 assuming that he\u2019s alright with it \u2014 I plan to spend the rest of my life with him. So, I would strongly suggest that you get used to me because\u2026well, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\nFair enough. Fair. Enough.\nJames nodded firmly, clapped the boy\u2019s shoulder and looked him dead in the eye. \u201cIf you ever hurt my son, I will hunt you down.\u201d\nDraco cracked a smile, even if it was a little shaky. \u201cDuly noted, sir.\u201d\nWell, that was that. James withdrew and reached out to tune the wireless. If they were really doing this whole bonding thing, Quidditch scores were a good place to start. And after all this, he would be remiss not to give this boy a fair shot.\n\u201cI assume you have the good sense to support Puddlemere United?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWho else would I support?\u201d Draco asked, sounding genuinely confused. \u201cThe Arrows? Or Merlin forbid, the Chudley Cannons?\u201d He visibly shuddered at the thought and James couldn\u2019t help a bark of laughter.\n\u201cHarry likes the Cannons,\u201d he pointed out. It was one of the few things they\u2019d always argued about.\n\u201cAnd I love him despite that,\u201d Draco reassured with a smirk. \u201cIt\u2019s all Ron Weasley\u2019s fault, you know. He\u2019s a terrible influence on your son.\u201d\nThey chuckled and swapped player stats until the announcements started. James shushed the boy and held the wireless up, craning to hear. Draco shuffled closer, all propriety promptly forgotten, contorting into James\u2019s space to get a hint of the news. Puddlemere had the Quaffle, they lost it, they got it again, and\u2026\n\u201cYes!\u201d Draco howled, pumping a victorious fist in the air. \u201cBlenkinshop kills it again!\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a national treasure! Why they have him in Reserve I\u2019ll never know, he should be front and centre at the\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShh! Draco, shh! They\u2019ve spotted the Snitch!\u201d\nCheers rang out from the wireless and James whooped like a madman as Draco eagerly joined in.\n\u00a0\nMeanwhile, back at the house, things were a lot less cheery.\nHarry glared sullenly as the plates floated into the kitchen and set themselves neatly in the sink.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Dad\u2019s problem?\u201d he burst out. He\u2019d been simmering in silence ever since his father had all but fled from the table, and Draco had cautiously opted to follow him. Now they were both gone and he just\u2026he didn\u2019t know what they could have done differently.\nLily smiled gently and brushed a kiss to his temple. \u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry tonight didn\u2019t go the way you wanted.\u201d\nHarry huffed and slumped on the couch. He turned big, sad eyes on her and it was all she could do not to take him in her arms and hold him until it was all better. But Harry wasn\u2019t six anymore and this wasn\u2019t a scraped knee or a banged up elbow. She would just have to do her best to be there for him \u2014 and give James a piece of her mind later. \u201cYou\u2019re his baby boy,\u201d she explained gently. \u201cAs far as your Dad\u2019s concerned, nobody could ever be good enough for you. You could have brought home Celestina Warbeck and he\u2019d still find something to complain about.\u201d\nHarry made a face. \u201cReally? Celestina Warbeck. That\u2019s the bar then, is it?\u201d\nLily grinned and ruffled his hair. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he sighed. A thought struck him and it was painful enough to bring a sting to his eyes. \u201cIs it\u2026is it because Draco\u2019s a man?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lily refuted that at once. \u201cNo, Harry. Never. You\u2019re our son and we love you no matter what. If you\u2019re happy, if you love him and he makes you happy\u2026then we love him. It might take your Dad a while to get there, but he will get there. I promise.\u201d \u00a0\nHarry cracked a smile. \u201cI do love him, you know,\u201d he admitted quietly.\n\u201cI know, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted you and Dad to like him too.\u201d He looked up at her hopefully. \u201cYou do, right?\u201d\nLily just pressed a kiss to his forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s polite, charming, sweet and he likes my cooking. Trust me, we\u2019re keeping this one,\u201d she said firmly. Harry pulled her into a tight hug and she smiled into his hair. Everything would be just fine, she knew it. Lily gave her boy a reassuring squeeze before pulling away. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go find them, hm? I think a little dessert is just the thing to pull this party back together.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, okay. I think they\u2019re outside\u2026\u201d\nThe shout rang out suddenly, scaring at least ten years off Harry\u2019s life. He exchanged an alarmed look with his mother and then they were both running for the door, wands out and raised. Harry stumbled out on the porch, searching for the source of all the unholy screeching, prepared for anything from hexes to a literal punch up...\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lily blurted, coming to a halt right beside him.\nHarry just stared, unable to comprehend what he was seeing.\n\u201cI told you!\u201d James was yelling, holding the wireless aloft. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d\n\u201cSalazar, did you hear the crowd?\u201d Draco ran his hands through his hair, all composure forgotten. He was flushed and grinning, eyes bright with excitement. \u201cThat had to be a new world record!\u201d\nJames whooped and threw an arm around Draco\u2019s shoulders, jostling him playfully. \u201cYou\u2019re alright, kid. Say, did you play back at school?\u201d\n\u201cSeeker, yeah!\u201d Draco replied, nodding frantically.\n\u201cMe too!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m out of practice though. Father thinks Quidditch is for plebians and vagabonds\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHarry hates it too! Go figure!\u201d\nHarry\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI do not hate Quidditch,\u201d he informed his mother indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m just not a lunatic about it like some\u2026\u201d\nLily waved a hand to shush him. She was trying to keep a straight face, but a stifled laugh escaped her anyway. \u201cJust let it play out, baby,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust\u2026let them go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple brooms in the shed,\u201d James was saying, already dragging Draco towards said shed. \u201cYou ever played Seeker\u2019s Tag on a Firebolt?\u201d\n\u201cYou have a Firebolt?!\u201d\nAnd with that, they bolted off, leaving Lily smiling behind them and Harry gaping in the dust.\n\u201cQuidditch,\u201d he mumbled. How could he have missed\u2026? He knew what Dad was like about the sport. And Draco honestly scared him during World Cup Season. And yet somehow, he hadn\u2019t put two and two together. He shook his head, amazed at his own cluelessness and turned to his mother for emotional support. \u201cQuidditch,\u201d he bleated helplessly.\nLily was practically doubled over with laughter by this point. It took her a good two minutes to compose herself, and by the time she did, two brooms were easily spotted in the sky, swooping and sailing towards a golden ball glinting in the moonlight.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she laughed, herding her baffled boy indoors. \u201cLet\u2019s get you some pudding. And we\u2019ll make a plate for your father and his new best friend too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nSix months later:\n\nThe Floo flared up at six in the morning, bathing the corridors of their small flat in bright green. Harry muttered sullen curses under his breath as he stumbled, still half-asleep to the living room. If this was what he thought it was\u2026\n\u201cHey, son!\u201d James waved cheerfully through the flames. \u201cMerlin, you look awful. Are you getting enough sleep?\u201d\nHarry groaned and palmed his face. \u201cDad,\u201d he moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is it? Well, I was just heading out for a run and I thought I\u2019d check in and say hi\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSave it,\u201d Harry grumbled. \u201cI know you\u2019re not calling for me.\u201d\nAwkward silence. It lasted maybe a beat or two before\u2026\n\u201cSo, can Draco come out to play or\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cDraco!\u201d Harry yelled, slumping on the couch and mentally willing the coffee to make itself this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s for you!\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t even slightly surprised when Draco bounced out, already dressed in full Quidditch gear. It took him thirty minutes to gear up on a good day. When had he even woken up? Harry decided he didn\u2019t want to know. Nothing good ever came from getting in between those two and their Quidditch obsession.\n\u201cHey James,\u201d Draco said, hoisting his broom up in greeting. \u201cI\u2019m all set.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Get over here, son!\u201d\nHarry grumbled and rubbed his eyes as Draco kissed him goodbye.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he promised. \u201cGo back to bed, you look exhausted.\u201d\n\u201cGosh, I wonder why,\u201d Harry muttered. He scowled blearily at his father, still grinning in the flames. \u201cIf you don\u2019t return my boyfriend in two hours, I\u2019m calling Mum. And I will tell her about the window you broke.\u201d\n\u201cYeah yeah, two hours. Merlin, you\u2019re just like your mother with the nagging\u2026\u201d\nHarry waved him off and buried his head under a cushion. The hiss of the Floo faded away with the sounds of his boyfriend and his father excitedly swapping Quidditch strategies for the day.\n\nHonestly.\n\nStill, despite his exasperation and annoyance at all things Quidditch, an amused smile played on his lips. All in all, that dinner could have been a lot worse. Harry settled in, bemused but content with how things had played out.\nHe was asleep again before the ash had settled."
