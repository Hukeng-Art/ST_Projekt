    "summary": "<p>Peter has a nasty habit of falling. And Tony, bless him, will catch him every single time. Until the day he can't.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m falling.\u201d<br>The words trickled out of Peter\u2019s mouth before they\u2019d really even formed, but Tony understood them.

    "notes": "<p>So I haven't written a fanfic in years - and then this popped into my head and I couldn't make it leave. These two are just so pure I had to write SOMETHING!<br>So this happened...is all un-beta'ed, so any mistakes are mine. Feel free to let me know about them in the comments.</p>\n<p>Thank-you all so much for your responses! It's been fantastic! You prompted me to write this next chapter so much faster than I thought I would!</p>\n<p>Here we go, another chapter! And once again it's all un-beta'd and written in a rush, so I'm sure the grammatical errors are going to be severe...</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Awww. He cares. He cares so much. </p>\n<p>...and they shall return in the next chapter...</p>\n<p>Sorry this chapter took a little longer...I don't know. I just wasn't happy with it. I'm still not sure about it...<br>Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>I literally have no words. Everyone's support and comments on this fic have been so fantastic! I love and appreciate you all so much! Ahh. You're all so beautiful!<br>Sorry this chapter took so long! Life got in the way as per usual. Also, as per usual, this is all unbeta'd so mistakes are mine, and probably vast.<br>Hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>P.s. Also Kudos to all of you who caught the Teen Wolf reference in the last Chapter! One of my favourites!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I know....feelings....<br>I got quite a few mixed reviews about adding Steve into the mix, both positive and negative - and I agree with most. Steve was wrong. He made the wrong choice. He blindly put Bucky above everything. What I don't agree with is that he did it out of malice, or even because he thought it was right. He admitted that at the end of the film.<br>I like to think he genuinely regrets what he did to Tony. To all of them.<br>And in this fic, he definitely does.<br>That does not mean that he has abandoned Bucky! Not even a little. But what is he doing in this fic is trying to figure out his place, in this world, and where Bucky fits into it. That is, after all, what his arc has been through the last few films - especially Winter Soldier. He has no place anymore. But he wants one. He wants purpose again. A place again.<br>THIS DOES NOT MEAN HE IS FORGIVEN!<br>Especially not by Peter.<br>Oh, darling, grudge-holding, pouting Peter.<br>And Tony needs no comment. He is perfect. Damaged, but goddamn perfect. </p>\n<p>...Also, to those wondering about Wanda...I may or may not write another fix to match this. And in that fic she would feature heavily. She is a favourite of mine, and I just feel like there is a lot about her life and choices that the films aren't touching on at the moment. If that fic does become a reality, you can expect a whole lot more Peter whump, and lots of Wanda whump to match...<br>Cause I'm cruel...and a sucker for the babies of the team...and their various, emotionally stunted parental figures...particularly Tony</p>\n<p>Let me know if that would be something you're interested in?</p>\n<p>Until the next chapter...which I will warn you, is going to be intense...</p>\n<p>Hey all! I can't even describe what all of your support means to me. Every single comment means so much! And I'm just having such a fantastic time writing!<br>That being said...here is the next chapter!<br>Before we get into it though I would like to let everyone know about the TRIGGER WARNING for this chapter! There is a SUICIDE ATTEMPT - though the circumstances around it are a little convoluted - and quite a few REFERENCES TO SUICIDE. If this is a trigger for anyone please read with caution/don't read at all. Be safe everyone! </p>\n<p>With that all out there! Please do enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>...And they will be seasoned with patriotism!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed that piece of shameless whump.....</p>\n<p>...because believe me, the next one is going to be 2731794832048% worse...</p>\n<p>Poor Tony. That's the only spoiler I'm giving. Poor, poor Tony.</p>\n<p>First of, oh my god, I\u2019m so sorry! It took soooooooo long to write this. I don\u2019t know what happened. My muse just abandoned me right at the start, and I ended up re-writing the whole thing about 3 times. <br>But here it is! At last, the final segment of this 5+1. <br>And it\u2019s a bit of a doozy. Prepare to cry your eyes out.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as with all of the other chapters, I do not have a beta and therefore all mistakes in this chapter are my own \u2013 and possibly numerous. I\u2019m afraid my proof-reading skills really decline after about eleven (and it\u2019s now five to one in the morning here\u2026) So apologies \u2013 feel free to let me know of anything I may have missed in the comments.</p>\n<p>Last but most certainly (by a long shot) not least, you guys are honestly more than I could ever express in words. All of your comments and kudos have mean to damn much to me \u2013 I can\u2019t describe it. The response to this fic has been something that I only ever dreamed about. Writing, and sharing that writing, is so hard sometimes because you pour everything into it and then lay it out for the world to see \u2013 but every single one of you have made this the best writing experience of my life. <br>Thank-you all so damn much. <br>And as my gift to you for all of your amazing responses, I give you the final chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And there we have it. All done and dusted. Our boys are safe \u2013 just. </p>\n<p>Please let me know what you thought. This chapter was really hard for me to write, and I\u2019d absolutely love to know what you thought. I read each and every comment (multiple times!) because they all mean so much to me. <br>Thank-you for sticking with me! <br>Until next time\u2026<br>Eva</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\n1.\n\u00a0\nYeah. Peter was definitely failing his Spanish quiz in the morning.\nHe\u2019d meant to be home, with his head shoved in his textbook, hours ago. He\u2019d traded studying for patrolling every night this week \u2013 arguing with himself that he could always cram tomorrow. Well tomorrow was here.\nAnd Peter was clinging to the underside of a helicopter for dear life, thousands of feet above Queens.\nNot really what he\u2019d planned for the evening \u2013 but after finding the ski-mask-wearing, large-gun-totting, group of men fleeing a jewellery store just after midnight Peter could hardly walk away - even if it did mean failing another Spanish quiz.\nMJ was going to kill him \u2013 if these guys didn\u2019t beat her too it.\n\u201cEngedje meg a sz\u00f6rnyeteget!\u201d\nOne of the aforementioned ski-mask-clad men leaned out of the helicopter cabin and fired several shots in Peter\u2019s direction.\n\u201cYeah. Dude. Still not a clue what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Peter yelped, pressing up against the metal helicopter frame in an effort to avoid the wild bullets. \u201cBut if you bring this thing down I\u2019m happy to try and-\u201d\nSeveral more shots cut him off.\nThe freezing November air cut to Peter\u2019s very bones as the helicopter rose even higher. They were hovering well beyond any of the buildings in the area now, and swaying heavily from side to side as the men repeatedly leant in and out of the cabin, firing in Peter\u2019s direction. It was becoming somewhat of an issue.\nPeter was doing all he could to remain on the helicopter. The cold was doing his already cramped, and stiff fingers no favours, and sliding off the bottom was starting to become a real possibility. And problem. The buildings below were way too far away for comfort, and he\u2019d used his parachute last week when he\u2019d been all but flung into the sky by a jetpack-wielding-megalomaniac.\n\u201cL\u0151dd le!\u201d\nThe shooting picked up \u2013 one man leaning almost all of the way out of the cabin to get a better aim at Peter.\n\u201cLook, if that was a surrender, I accept.\u201d Peter yelled.\nThe hailing of bullets continued. Peter\u2019s fingers slipped a little. He panicked slightly. Crashing painfully against the underside of the helicopter as he flung his entire body along the cool metal. A bullet grazed his left leg.\nYeah. This might not end so well.\n\u201cMight I suggest a different course of action?\u201d\nKaren\u2019s voice cut in over Peter\u2019s panicked gasps.\n\u201cYES!\u201d Peter all screeched, shifting just slightly to avoid another bullet. \u201cYes! Please do-\u201d\n\u201cYou are reaching restricted altitude.\u201d Karen\u2019s voice cut him off. The helicopter continued to spiral upwards. \u201cA pre-set height of exactly two-thousand feet \u2013 dictated by the \u2018Baby-Proofing\u2019 protocall.\u201d\n\u201cTHE WHAT?!\u201d It was definitely a screech that time. Peter shook his head manically, clinging to the cool metal of the helicopter desperately as if flung from side to side. \u201cLook, never mind \u2013 Karen I need-\u201d\nAnother series of shots rung out, only this time one hit home.\nJust not in Peter.\nA deafening clang rang out as one of the bullets collided with the main rotor above the helicopter \u2013 the rotor snapped upward, bending back on itself, and jerked wildly.\nOne more jerk and the helicopter was no longer spiralling upwards.\nIt was catapulting downwards.\n\u201cShit. Shit. SHIT!\u201d Peter yelled, hauling himself upwards into the cabin as the helicopter flipped mid-air \u2013 the rotators dragging the entire thing downwards.\nA boot to the face almost sent Peter cascading into the open air.\nAs it was he barely managed to latch his fingers onto the side of the cabin and haul himself back in. One of the masked men kicked out again, but Peter caught the foot before it met his face a second time and shoved the man across the small cabin.\n\u201cSeriously!\u201d Peter yelled, \u201cI\u2019m trying to help here!\u201d\nThe man surged forwards again, but was yanked back by another of the masked thieves.\n\u201cFelejtsd el! Gyer\u00fcnk!\u201d The second man yelled, strapping something around himself and his partner - and then lunging out of the helicopter together.\nPeter threw himself to the edge of the cabin and gaped, watching as the parachutes opened just before they fell out of his view. Spinning wildly Peter realised that the others must have jumped as well while he was climbing his way in \u2013 because he was suddenly all along in the plummeting helicopter. Shit.\n\u201cAh, Karen. Suggestions. Now.\u201d Peter stammered, climbing over the seats to the pilot\u2019s position and seizing the joystick. He jerked it upwards, and the entire cabin jerked to the right, spinning manically, but continued to fall.\n\u201cSuggested course of action: Evacuation.\u201d Karen said.\n\u201cGreat. Helpful.\u201d Peter spat through gritted teeth as he pulled the joystick back as far as it would go and began wildly pressing every button he could get him hands on. The helicopter continued to spin. Nausea began to settle in Peter\u2019s lower intestines. \u201cAny suggestions on how I might do that without a parachute!\u201d\n\u201cYour chances of survival are slim.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019M AWARE!\u201d Peter screamed. The city was approaching beneath him. \u201cI need more tha-\u201d\n\u201cYou have reached terminal velocity. \u2018Baby-Monitor\u2019 protocall activated. Calling Tony Stark-\u201d\n\u201cWHAT!? NO DON\u2019T-\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t hear her reply. With one final jerk on the joystick and the rotors began to spin at full speed again \u2013 only full speed with a bent rotor meant even more spiralling and no less falling. The next several seconds were past in a blur of screaming and multiple, painful collisions with the cabin walls.\nBy the time Peter managed to get a grip on one of the chairs \u2013 and figure out which way was up again \u2013 the city was much too close.\n\"Karen!\" Peter breathed heavily, giving up on the piloting equipment and climbing back into the main cabin \"I need a place to set this thing down!\" He threw a panicked glance around him. \"And a way to get it down - preferably softly.\"\nThe spinning was starting to get to him. His earlier nausea had grown, leaving him on the verge of hurling. Or maybe that was the panic - because he was definitely panicking now.\nThe helicopter was still in a death spiral and Peter was all out of ideas. He could web onto the side of two buildings and try to hold the helicopter with his legs? But there was no guarantee he could hold it. Or that the helicopter would even fall between buildings sturdy enough to grip. It might plummet straight into something before he even got a chance to slow it down. And if he was sure of anything it was that if the helicopter hit the ground or any of the buildings above it, people were going to die. It was too big, and falling far too quickly. It was why he hadn't taken his chances in falling back to the city without it. He needed to slow it down - or it could bring a building down with it.\n\"Restoring rotor balance, and resulting wind-displacement, may restore functions long enough to maneuver a non-fatal landing.\"\n\"Non-fatal.\" Peter breathed shakily, climbing along the inside of the cabin to look out over the edge. \"Y-yes. That \u2013 good.\"\nNo sooner had he stuck his head out of the cabin, the bent rotor arched up from below him and nearly took his head clean off.\nHis already laboratory breathing skyrocketed into full-blown hypoventilation.\n\"Okay!\" Peter swallowed, inching his head back out of the cabin to get a better look at the rotor. And the buildings below that we're getting uncomfortably close. \"Straighten the rotor. Sure. Good. How should I do that exactly?\" The damaged rotor arced up again - inches away from Peter.\nKaren's silence was deafening.\n\"Okay. Fine. We can do this. We got this. I mean how hard can it be? It's like straightening a coat hanger.\" Peter argued. The damaged rotor swung up once more. \"Just a really big, really sharp coat hanger.\"\nPeter shot a web onto the side of the cabin to brace himself, before leaning out just a little further in the open air \u2013 ready to shoot a web at the broken rotor.\n\u201cTouch the coat-hanger, kid, and I\u2019ll eject you from this tin can myself.\u201d\nPeter pulled back into the cabin just in time. A moment later an Iron Man suit latched onto the side of the helicopter. And another a moment later. They rocked the small cabin, but Peter clung on. An Iron Man suit slammed into the open cabin space where he had been only seconds early \u2013 digging the metal fingertips of one hand into the base of the cabin, and seizing the wild rotors with the other. The helicopter engine spluttered, and then died under the pressure. The rotors fell limp.\n\u201cMr. Stark!?\u201d Peter cried, crawling forwards until he was crouched just in front of the Iron Man suit, wedged in the cabin doorway.\n\u201cRemember that grey area, kid?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice flooded through the suit. \u201cThis isn\u2019t it. This isn\u2019t even on the spectrum of grey. This is florescent. Bright, ugly and an eye-sore that\u2019s about to make a not so lovely crater in the middle of Queens-\u201d \u00a0\nThe rant went on for some time \u2013 but to be entirely honest Peter caught very little of it. After just a couple of seconds the helicopter was already slowing. The Iron Man suits had latched on, and were beginning to haul it back into the sky.\nIf Peter weren\u2019t so aware that the Iron Man suit \u2013 with its array of cameras \u2013 were so close, he would have cried with relief.\n\u201c-kid. Kid? You with me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter breathed, leaning back against the metal frame of the cabin and trying to bring his breathing under some kind of control. Now that he knew he was going to be fine, his panic was starting to be embarrassing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. I swear. T-t-thanks for coming. I, ugh, yeah. Thanks.\u201d\nYeah. Real smooth. Avenger\u2019s material right there.\n\u201cSure you are.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice echoed through the suit. A moment later the helmet flipped upwards to reveal \u2013 nothing. The suit was empty.\nGood, Peter thought. At least he\u2019s not here in person to watch me fail completely. The thought was fleeting, but Peter clung to it. Determined to bury the empty feeling that sprung up in his chest at the sight of the empty helmet.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y run vitals.\u201d A red beam erupted from inside the helmet and moved swiftly across Peter\u2019s body. Peter curled in on himself just a fraction. As if a ball of Peter Parker might make his bullet grazed leg and easily broken ribs more difficult to detect.\nThe helicopter was moving across the city now \u2013 headed out of Queens and towards Manhattan. It was oddly peaceful. With Peter\u2019s advanced senses it was never quiet anymore. There was always something happening in Queens \u2013 always someone or something nearby. But up this high, and devoid of any engine sounds, the night was almost silent. The gentle whirring of the suit\u2019s repulsors was all that broke the silence, and Peter found he didn\u2019t mind it at all. It was almost soothing.\n\u201cRight-\u201d Tony\u2019s voice echoed out of the empty helmet. \u201cFirst things first: where did they even get this piece of junk. Honestly. This thing is a blight on the good name of aero-space engineering-\u201d\nA loud crack rang out \u2013 and then Peter was falling.\nThe roof of the helicopter, which one of the Iron Man suits was currently grasping to help keep the thing flying, creaked and then gave way. The thin metal ripped from where the armour\u2019s hands were clasped around its edges, all the way to the base of the rotor. Luckily the entire helicopter didn\u2019t give way \u2013 the other suits were more than fast enough to readjust their grip.\nPeter was not quite so fast. Or so lucky.\nThe base of the cabin tipped drastically when the roof ripped open, and before he could latch on to anything Peter found himself sliding out into the open air. And plummeting to his death.\nHe was definitely panicking again.\n\u201cPETER!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhen he had first made the web-shooters, and taken them out for a test-run, Peter would have sworn up and down that the feeling of falling through New York was the greatest of his life. The thrill of each and every lunge was somehow more fantastic than the last.\nHe was ready to rethink that assumption now.\nFalling through New York this time was terrifying, and final. Maybe because he wasn\u2019t falling through the city like he did as Spiderman \u2013 relying on the buildings and monuments he knew so well \u2013 he was falling to it. And much too quickly.\nThe night around him was a dizzying array of lights, darkness, and the distinct knowledge that the ground was much closer to him than he realized. Tony must have been close to landing the helicopter because after just a few seconds of falling Peter was about to become acquainted with some of the taller Manhattan buildings.\nGod. Being impaled on the Empire State building was not how he wanted to go.\nOh god. He was going to die.\nSomewhere, in the distant parts of his mind, Peter knew he was screaming \u2013 Guttural, animalistic screams \u2013 but he was falling so fast that the sounds were ripped from him before he could fully process them.\nOh. God. Ohgodohgodohgodohgodohgodohgod.\nHe shot a web at the closest building when he began to sail right past it \u2013 but the web pulled taught much too fast and snapped. Peter\u2019s shoulder arced, and ripped with it. The bone popped out of the socket under the pressure.\nHe tried again. The web snapped. The tendons in his shoulder snapped along with it.\nHe could see the cars on the street below him. The people. The concrete.\n\nOh god! No! \n\nWhat would happen to May? Ned? God, what would Tony tell them? Tony. What would happen to Tony?\n\nNO!\n\nSomething hard, cold and strong latched on under his arms and yanked. Peter let out a yelp of pain \u2013 which quickly turned into a sigh of relief when his decent started to slow. The Iron Man suit behind him pulled him upwards \u2013 slipping its metal arms around his waist and cradling him to its chest \u2013 before blasting the repulsors.\nThe sudden change in direction had Peter on the verge of nausea again. His eyes blurred one last time.\nThe image on concrete not ten feet below him would haunt him for the rest of his life.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was still ringing in the back of Peter\u2019s head. \u201cKid!?\u201d\nLogically Peter knew he couldn\u2019t have been out for long \u2013 the clanging of metal on the pavement and the feeling of cool ground beneath his own feet told him that it could only have been a couple of seconds. But it felt like hours.\nPeter\u2019s entire body hurt. And exhaustion had set in during those few seconds. He could barely muster the strength to keep breathing \u2013 let alone open his eyes. Yeah. He\u2019d rest for a bit. Just a little while. Just a short fourteen hour nap. That\u2019d set him right.\nHe could feel himself being lowered down to concrete, strong arms still clasped around his torso.\n\u201cKid!?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was still pounding at the back of his head. Or was it in front of him. Peter wasn\u2019t too sure. It might not have been Tony\u2019s voice at all. Peter had never heard him sound so panicked \u2013 and whoever was manhandling him to the ground was practically seeping fear. \u201cTime to wake up now.\u201d The voice went on, breaking slightly at the end.\nPeter registered the words, but their meaning flew right by him. God, he was so tired.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y run vitals,\u201d the voice bit out as soon as Peter\u2019s head touched the concrete. \u201cPulse? Does he have a pulse? Jesus \u2013 get this thing off me. Get it off now!\u201d\nThe cool metal left Peter altogether, and he drifted for a second. The pavement wasn\u2019t comfortable whatsoever, but right now Peter could have kissed it. It was so firm. Not at all like the feeling of falling. Christ. He wanted to lie there for the rest of his life. Even the idea of standing seemed like it would be far too far from the ground. Yeah. He\u2019d stay here. Sleep a while and \u2013\nSomething warm was suddenly crouching beside him. Hands running along his torso. Lifting the edge of his mask up, above his mouth.\nTwo shaking slightly fingers dug into the side of his neck.\nPeter\u2019s eyes cracked open.\n\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d\nThe city very slowly came into focus above him \u2013 and so did the man hovering over him.\n\u201cKid!?\u201d Tony was hunched over him, face pale and eyes wide. At the sight of Peter\u2019s open eyes, he let out a chocked, ragged breath. The hand that had been pressed almost painfully against Peter\u2019s throat moved to rest on his chest. Rising and falling with Peter\u2019s every breath.\nFor a long moment all the two did was breathe.\nEventually Tony spoke. \u201cYou alright, kid?\u201d\nWhen Peter didn\u2019t answer, panic started to rise up in Tony\u2019s eyes again. His hands moved up to grip Peter\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cPeter? You alright? Anything hurt? Anything broken?\u201d\nPeter stared up at the older man \u2013 flesh and blood man, not empty suit \u2013 incomprehensively.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Peter stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re really here.\u201d\nA large sigh heaved through Tony at the sound of Peter\u2019s voice. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here, kid.\u201d He murmured. His hand left Peter\u2019s chest, moving down to poke at his bullet grazed leg instead. Peter could already feel it healing \u2013 unlike his nerves. Those would probably never recover.\n\u201cB-but. What?\u201d Peter stuttered, trying to wrap his head around the last few minutes of his life. And it really had only been a few minutes. The helicopter. The bullets. The Iron-Man suits.\nThe fall.\nGod, he felt like he\u2019d aged a decade.\n\u201cYeah, you and me both, kid.\u201d Oh shit. Did he say that out loud?\nTony\u2019s words were clipped, but there was something underneath. The hand that had been resting on Peter\u2019s chest found its way back. It sat just above his heart, rising and falling as Peter tried, and failed, to take several steady breaths.\nThe weight of it was comforting.\n\u201cH-how, I-I-\u201d Peter went on, glancing about wildly. He was lying on a deserted sidewalk in a small side street. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nTony, clearly unhappy about, but satisfied with, the state of Peter\u2019s leg, moved back up to lean over him. His concern was growing with every incomprehensible stammer.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y run a scan for spinal and cranial damage.\u201d\nThat broke Peter from his stupor.\n\u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m good. I swear.\u201d Peter jack-knifed up into the sitting position \u2013 nearly head-butting Tony. \u201cGood. I\u2019m good. J-just, ugh, that was\u2026high. That was high.\u201d\nTony leaned back slightly, looking over him warily. The hand on Peter\u2019s chest didn\u2019t lower.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony agreed slowly, watching the teen heave in several breaths. \u201cBit too high. I thought we\u2019d agreed that the friendly-neighbourhood-Spiderman stays in the neighbourhood \u2013 not two thousand feet above it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. T-totally.\u201d Now that he was sitting up Peter was beginning to feel the ache in his shoulders. And, well, just about everywhere else too.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y?\u201d Tony prompted, still focused on Peter.\n\u201cNo significant spinal or cranial damage.\u201d F.R.I.DA.Y\u2019s voiced echoed out of the now-empty suit standing beside them. \u201cThe left clavicle is currently dislocated, and surrounded by small tissue tares. Due to his advanced regenerative cells, the tears will heal within hours once the clavicle is re-aligned. Scans do show significantly low blood pressure, laboured breathing and an elevated heart rate.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Really. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Peter insisted.\nTony\u2019s other hand came to rest on Peter\u2019s uninjured shoulder, holding him in place as a wave of dizziness passed over him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, kid. You\u2019re just in shock. It\u2019ll ease up in a few minutes.\u201d Tony said, shifting so that he was sitting directly in front of Peter, with one hand on his shoulder and the other still resting on Peter\u2019s chest. They stayed like that for a few minutes, and eventually the world started to come back into focus for Peter. Tony must have been able to feel Peter\u2019s heartbeat beneath his hand, because he waited for it to steady before he spoke.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not do that again, huh?\u201d\nPeter let out a small, hysterical breath of laughter.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have no plans to fall out of a helicopter any time \u2013 oh shit! Where\u2019s the helicopter!? The robbers!?\u201d The last few minutes finally began to break through Peter\u2019s haze.\nHe leapt to his feet \u2013 scanning the sky.\n\u201cHey, Easy!\u201d Tony pushed to his feet beside him, grabbing a hold of Peter\u2019s shoulder again. Only this time the hold was a lot stronger. Holding him in place. \u201cThe chopper\u2019s at the Tower, and whoever was in it are long gone. All of their bags are still secured in the cabin, so whatever they stole, they didn\u2019t take with them.\u201d\n\u201cBut they got away!\u201d\n\"Yeah, and you almost got made into a blue-and-red pancake!\u201d Tony hissed, his eyes flashing. The panic that Peter had seen there before was slowly giving way to anger, and frustration. \u201cSo let\u2019s just file tonight as \u2018episode 904 of Peter getting in over his head\u2019 and be satisfied with the fact that we\u2019re not cleaning anyone off the pavement.\u201d\n\u201cB-but-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off. His tone was final. \u201cSee that building there,\u201d With the hand that wasn\u2019t currently clenched around Peter\u2019s uninjured shoulder, he pointed up at the Empire State Building \u2013 which was just visible a few blocks away. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s your new height limit, kid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! No! Come o-\u201d\nTony cut him off again.\n\u201cEvery time you argue with me, you loose another hundred feet.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Star-\u201d\n\u201c-1,150 feet.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mr. Star-\u201d\n\u201c1,050 feet.\u201d Peter gaped at the man, but didn\u2019t make a sound. God. This was so not how he wanted tonight to go.\nA sleek, black car pulled up on the sidewalk.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Tony said, releasing Peter for just a second to move back towards the abandoned Iron-Man suit. With a wave of one of Tony\u2019s hands the suit began to fold in on itself until it formed a large suitcase. Tony seized it by the handle and marched back to Peter. \u201cWe need to get back to the Tower and get that shoulder fixed before it sets that way.\u201d\n\u201cI can do it-\u201d\nWith his free hand Tony latched back onto the arm Peter was moving up to his injured shoulder.\n\u201cDo not reset your own shoulder on the sidewalk.\u201d Tony hissed, shaking his head disbelievingly. He pulled Peter towards the car with a muttered, \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\nPushing Peter in first, Tony slid inside the car and shut the door. The car started automatically and began to weave through late-night traffic to the Tower.\n\u201cHey, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter murmured after several minutes of silence.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cNice catch.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, we are not making a sport out of this, kid.\u201d\n2.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s feet made an odd squelch with every step.\nHis converses had been soaked through with rain, and the pressure of them against the immaculate Stark Tower floor made them rub painfully against his feet. And squelch.\nThe sound was equally fascinating and off-putting. Peter found himself so captivated by it that he almost walked straight past the lobby elevator that would take him up to the Avengers\u2019 living quarters. And then when he realized, and doubled back, he found himself standing in front of the elevator with absolutely no idea why he was there.\nHe\u2019d come for a reason. An important one. But then his shoes had squelched, and the homeless man outside had reminded him vaguely of the guy from a Burger King ad he\u2019d seen the other day and \u2013\nPeter sagged against the elevator doors. His mind was moving at a thousand miles an hour, and as much as he tried he just couldn\u2019t focus.\nThere was something important. God. Something he had to do\u2026?\nHis shoes squelched again as he shoved himself painfully upright.\nGod, why was everything so cloudy? Cloudy. There. That sounded familiar. That was important. Clouds. Clouds were important. Well, they kind of sucked when he was swinging through the city, because they made some things difficult to see, and clouds usually meant rain which really sucked when he was out patrolling because the suit, no matter how many fancy tech gadgets Tony put in it, always chaffed just a tiny bit when it got wet \u2013\nTony. That was important too. Clouds and Tony.\nMaybe that was why he was currently standing in the empty Avengers Tower lobby at two in the morning, in nothing but a pair of sweats and stained hoodie. Tony was here. Likely. And so were clouds if he went high enough.\nYeah. That was why he was here. To talk to Tony, and the clouds.\nWait. No. That wasn\u2019t right.\nSquelch.\nGod, that was so weird. Such a weird sound. He felt like water shouldn\u2019t make a sound. Or was it the shoes making the sound? But couldn\u2019t be, because they didn\u2019t usually make that sound \u2013 but then again, neither did water. It was some mad combination of the both. Physics. So cool-\n\u201cMr. Parker.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voice echoed out in the empty lobby. \u201cCan I assist you in finding Mr. Stark?\u201d\nPeter jumped so much that a moment later he found himself hanging upside from the ceiling the elevator. And then the second after that he was on the floor again. Sprawled out on all fours with his head throbbing. His hands and feet felt strangely numb. So did everything else actually. Huh.\n\u201c-r. Parker?\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y\u2019s voiced rang out again. \u201cYou vital signs are fluctuating. Shall I call Mr. Stark?\u201d\n\u201cN-nope.\u201d Peter scrambled to his feet \u2013 and then promptly face planted back to the floor.\nOn the third try he was up. Or mostly. He was definitely on his knees \u2013 and it was enough to get him to the elevator. He slammed a hand down on the button, dinting the metal framing, before sliding back down onto the floor. The tiles were cool on his warm face. Hot face. Very hot face.\nGod. His face was on fire.\nThe elevator doors slid open right in front of his face and Peter began to crawl inside. He wasn\u2019t quite sure why, but he was in the lobby \u2013 which was nice and all \u2013 but probably not worth the trip from Queens. Or, at least, Peter thinks he came from Queens. Probably. He couldn\u2019t exactly remember, but it sounded about right.\nThe elevator was blinding.\nEvery inch of it was white. The Ceiling. Floor. Walls. It radiated, and ached behind Peter\u2019s eyes. So much so that it took a few good seconds for Peter to crawl inside, and when he had he was left a shivering mess on the floor. God it hurt. Someone needed to turn them down.\nWith a soft click the lighting immediately dimmed, taking on a red-tinge that almost had Peter crying with relief.\n\u201cT-thanks F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u201d\nThe doors slid closed silently, and then the elevator was moving.\nPeter \u2013 using the metal handlebar that ran around the walls of the elevator \u2013 heaved himself back to his feet. Or at least he thinks they\u2019re his feet. They\u2019re beneath him, and holding him up, but he couldn\u2019t feel them. Couldn\u2019t feel his hands either.\nHis head he could feel. It was pounding. The bright light had broken something in him and now all he could feel was blinding, pulsing pain.\nHe slammed it down on the wall, half to try and beat the pain out, and half to stay upright. His numb legs were buckling dangerously beneath him, so he leant over the metal bar and rested some of his weight on it. Okay. All of his weight.\nShit. He really didn\u2019t feel so good. But he had to stay upright. He was here for a reason. An important one \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t quite remember what.\nOh. Right! Tony! Clouds and Tony. He needed to talk to the clouds and Tony. No. That didn\u2019t sound right. Did it?\nThe elevator stopped with a small shudder, and the small motion was enough to throw Peter off the railing and towards the elevator doors. Only there weren\u2019t doors there anymore.\nThere was a very real Tony Stark.\nPeter stumbled face first from the elevator \u2013 ready to meet the floor for what seemed like the hundredth time in the last few hours \u2013 when warm arms wrapped around him and saved him from a painful introduction to the tiles.\n\u201cKid?\u201d\nThe one word sent Peter\u2019s head spinning. Or more spinning. Spinner? Because it was definitely spinning already \u2013 but Tony\u2019s arms wrapping around him and lowering him gently to his knees definitely made it spin harder.\nPeter had to tell him something. He wasn\u2019t sure what \u2013 god, his head was spinning so bad \u2013 but he definitely had to tell him something.\n\u201cM-mr. Stark-\u201d Peter started, staring up at the older man with wide eyes. Wow. His goatee was so well trimmed. How had Peter never noticed that before?\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony asked, clearly taken-aback, \u201cWhat are you doing here, kid?\u201d\nTony pulled his hands away once they were both safely kneeling on the tiles, but it seemed that not even kneeling agreed with Peter anymore because he began to list sideways without Tony\u2019s steadying hands.\n\u201cWow! Shit!\u201d Tony\u2019s hands snapped out and grabbed a hold of Peter\u2019s hoodie, lowering him the rest of the way to the floor. \u201cKid, what\u2019s happened? Are you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cO-oh, h-hey Mr. Stark.\u201d God. Was that his voice? Was it always that squeaky? Why had no one told him!\nTell\u2026he had something to tell. He had something to tell Tony. And the clouds.\n\u201cPeter, what\u2019s going o-\u201d\n\u201cCLOUDS!\u201d\nTony, who had been leaning over Peter with his brows knitted together, recoiled at the noise. Huh. Had he shouted? He could barely hear the words himself \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t really hear anything right now. Except buzzing. Yeah, he could hear buzzing \u2013 and squelching. God, that noise was weird \u2013\n\u201c-eter!\u201d\nTony\u2019s hands were back on his hoodie, and they were shaking. Or Peter was shaking. They were both definitely shaking. \u00a0\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony\u2019s head slowly swam into focus above Peter. Wow. That was a nice goatee. \u201cPeter, can you hear me?\u201d There was a hand on Peter\u2019s face, smoothing back his hair, tugging back his eye-lid. Tony was really close to him now. Staring down into his eyes, with panic written in every line of his face. Panic? Tony was panicking. Should Peter be panicking? Wasn\u2019t he already panicking?\n\u201cClouds!\u201d Peter said again, reaching up to seize a hold of Tony\u2019s deep red shirt. He used it to heave himself off the ground just a few inches. \u201cI need to talk to clouds!\u201d Wait. No. \u201cI have to talk to you!\u201d Yeah. That was right. \u201c-and then clouds.\u201d Huh.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony nodded slowly, pushing Peter back down to the floor gently. \u201cOkay. Just take some deep breaths kid! Talk to me. What happened?\u201d\n\u201cClouds-\u201d\n\u201c-Tony-\u201d\nPeter\u2019s head swivelled at the new voice \u2013 God, how many people lived here - and his eyes promptly fell on Captain America, who was standing awkwardly just down the fall.\n\u201cTony, what?\u201d Captain America moved towards them both, eyes focused on Peter. \u201cWho is this? What happened-\u201d\n\u201cIs Bruce here!?\u201d Tony snapped at the Captain, holding Peter down with one hand and pressing the other into his neck. Whatever he found there clearly wasn\u2019t what he wanted because Tony\u2019s agitation skyrocketed.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s upstairs. Tony-\u201d\nTony cut him off without even a glance in his direction.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y call Bruce down here, now-\u201d\nThe Captain reached them in just a few seconds, kneeling down on the other side of Peter, and placing a hand on the shoulder that Tony was currently clasping at. Something was off though. H-he wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Not here. Not with Tony.\nTony.\nTony who had come back from Siberia with blood splattered over every inch of him \u2013 and something broken behind his eyes. They were friends. And Steve left him to die. Steve. Captain America. Left. Tony. To. Die.\n\u201cGET AWAY FROM HIM!\u201d\nPeter, with the last inch of strength he had, hurled himself at the Captain. Shoving him back from Tony. The Captain didn\u2019t stumble back nearly as far as Peter would have liked but he did back up \u2013 eyes wide.\nPeter moved to shove him again \u2013 to get him the hell away from them \u2013 when arms wrapped around him again. Holding him back.\n\u201cPeter!?\u201d Tony cried, \u201cPeter stop!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Peter struggled, \u201cI won\u2019t let him near us, I wont let him hurt you!\u201d\nThe Captain took another step back, his face crumpling.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here to hurt us!\u201d Tony argued, pulling Peter back to the floor and wrapping an arm around his head in an effort to force Peter to look at him. \u201cHe\u2019s not here to hurt either of us, okay? We talked about this. Cap\u2019s here to discuss the Accords, all the Avengers are-\u201d\n\u201c-No.\u201d Peter maintained, his eyes darting between the Captain and Tony so fast it was making him dizzy. Dizzier. \u201cNononono-\u201d\n\u201c-Peter! STOP!\u201d\nTony\u2019s yell broke through Peter\u2019s haze. Kind of. Mostly. His face stopped spinning at least.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve been drugged,\u201d Tony said slowly, once Peter was focused on him. \u201cOkay?\u201d Peter stared blankly at Tony. \u201cOkay!? Can you hear me?\u201d\nWhen Peter continued to stare up at the older man with wide eyes Tony let out a strained breath, and pulled Peter closer to him \u2013 cradling Peter to his chest. Wow, Tony was really warm. Really warm. Oh god. Was he sick? He kept going on about heart problems, but the flippant way the he talked, Peter had always shrugged him off. What if he was really sick? What if \u2013\n\u201c-I\u2019m not sick. I\u2019m not sick. You\u2019re just cold.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice broke through Peter\u2019s wild thoughts. Or words. Had he said all that out loud? Oh, god. What else had he said out loud? \u201cYou\u2019re really cold kid, you\u2019re shivering. I\u2019m trying to keep you warm. Just focus on me, okay. Relax and focus \u2013 you\u2019re going to be fine. We\u2019re going to fix you up and-\u201d\n\u201c-Tony?! What the hell is going on?!\u201d\nFrom where he lay, practically crushed to Tony\u2019s chest, Peter could barely make out the mousy brown haired man coming through the elevator doors. He rushed to Peter\u2019s other side, dropping a large bag by Peter\u2019s legs and leaning over to have a better looked at Peter through his slightly askew glasses.\n\u201cWhat happened? Who is this?\u201d The man asked, digging into his bag and pulling out piles of different medical supplies. \u00a0\n\u201cThis is Underoo.\u201d Tony murmured, lowering Peter to the ground just slightly so that the other man could get a better look at him.\n\u201cThis is Spiderman?!\u201d Peter\u2019s attention snapped back to the Captain \u2013 who was still standing a few steps away, watching them all with astonishment. \u201cHe\u2019s a teenager!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re ninety-seven.\u201d Tony snapped back. \u201cWe don\u2019t exactly age discriminate.\u201d\n\u201cTony-\u201d The man beside Peter, currently taking his blood pressure, began softly. Tony cut him off.\n\u201cBruce, please. Not now.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes flicked between the two men, and then down to Peter. The fight drained out of him. \u201cPlease,\u201d Tony said, glancing back up at the two men. \u201cJust help me with him, and I\u2019ll explain later. I swear.\u201d\nThe man on the other side of Peter \u2013 Bruce \u2013 nodded and moved back to \u2013 Holy Shit! Bruce. Bruce Banner. Peter was lying on the floor next to Bruce Banner. Peter was sprawled out on the floor, with his head spinning and last meal about to make a re-appearance next to Bruce Banner. \u00a0\nHuh. He really didn\u2019t feel so good.\nHe felt odd. And cold.\n\u201c-do we know where his been, if we could circle back on where he\u2019s been maybe we can-\u201d Bruce fell silent when Peter spoke.\nWell, it sounded like him, but Peter couldn\u2019t be sure. He couldn\u2019t exactly feel his face anymore. Or the rest of him.\n\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Peter murmured. God he was tired now. And cold. He felt like the squelch sound. All weird and water logged. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d\nThe words were soft \u2013 Peter could barely hear them himself \u2013 but they froze the room. All of a sudden whatever conversation was happening above Peter stopped, and all three men were at his side in an instant.\n\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y run every scan we have-\u201d\n\u201c-blood pressure is high \u2013 too high \u2013 we need something-\u201d\n\u201c-you said you needed to know where he was, can you track his phone or something? I can follow his movements and-\u201d\nPeter\u2019s head swum. Or maybe he was swimming. Swimming sounded nice. Relaxing. Might help with his sore everything \u2013 except his head. Which was pounding. And, god, water was loud. Really loud. Like, yelling loud.\nWhy was the water yelling at him?\n\u201cPETER!?\u201d\nHe was shaking again. Or something was shaking, and he was shaking with it.\n\u201cPeter!? Answer me, dammit!\u201d Wow. Water was bossy. \u201cWake up!\u201d\n\u201cM-mr. Stark?\u201d\nEven Peter\u2019s voice hurt now. Oh god. Could this night get any worse?\nTony slowly came into focus above him \u2013 and so did the rest of the room in time. Peter was back on the floor, a stricken Tony leaning over him. The Captain was on his other side, one hand resting against the side of Peter\u2019s throat, and the other on Tony\u2019s shoulder. Bruce was nowhere to be found.\n\u201cJesus Christ kid!\u201d Tony\u2019s fists clenched tightly where they sat, clasped on Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d\nPeter definitely heard the words. Definitely. Sense, however, they did not make.\n\u201cKid?\u201d All of a sudden the Captain\u2019s face was hovering beside Tony\u2019s. God, his eyes were so sincere \u2013 no. No. Peter was angry with him. He did something. Something\u2026but those eyes were just so sincere. \u201cYou need to tell us what happened. Did you take something? Did someone inject you?\u201d\n\u201cClouds.\u201d\nThe word trickled out of Peter\u2019s mouth in a garbled mess.\nThe Captain stared down at him, like he\u2019d grown a third head.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201c-not a clue. He keeps going on about clouds.\u201d Tony answered before Peter could even begin to decipher the word. He was still staring down at Peter \u2013 fist clenching and unclenching nervously around Peter\u2019s shoulders. The touch was oddly grounding. Peter worried he might actually float away if it stopped. \u201cWhere is Bruce?!\u201d Tony went on. He tilted his head slightly to the ceiling. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y ask Bruce what\u2019s taking so long.\u201d\nA moment later Bruce\u2019s voice echoed through the walls. Oh god. Was he a ghost? Had he died? No \u2013\n\u201c-Tony, I\u2019m trying. There are hundreds of drugs that could be in his system \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a little while to narrow it down. Just keep him still and calm, okay. We don\u2019t want to move him to much until we know more-\u201d\n\u201cCloud.\u201d\nThe Captain\u2019s voice cut ghost-hulk off mid-sentence. Rude.\nAbove Peter Tony\u2019s eyes finally glanced up to the man kneeling across from him. He stared for a second in silence.\n\u201cNew development,\u201d Tony deadpanned, still staring at the Captain. \u201cThe meteorological-word-vomit is contagious.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Tony.\u201d The Captain argued, animated. \u201cCloud. Like a cloud of powder?\u201d\nTony barely missed a beat before he was rounding back down on Peter. \u201c\n\u201cPeter, did anyone through powder into your face?\u201d Words. Peter definitely heard words. What did people do with words again \u2013 \u201cPeter!\u201d The hands that had been flexing around Peter\u2019s shoulders moved up to rest of his face, holding him still while Tony stared directly down at him. \u201cPay attention. Did anyone throw powder at you.\u201d Powder. Clouds. Yeah. Yeah.\nPeter nodded.\nHe remembered that. God, that cloud had been awful. It had burned in his throat. His eyes \u2013\n\u201cWere you wearing this hoodie?\u201d Tony plowed on, his grip on Peter\u2019s face not lessening.\nTo be honest, Peter wasn\u2019t really sure \u2013 he\u2019d been more preoccupied with the cloud that was eating his face at the time \u2013 not his outfit, but it sounded about right. He nodded again.\nAnd a second later he wished he hadn\u2019t. As soon as he\u2019d even started to nod, the hands on him were seizing him under the shoulders and hauling him into a half-sitting position. Another set of hands joined in once he was kind of upright, unzipping his hoodie and pulling it down and off his arms.\nIf he\u2019d thought he was cold before, it was nothing compared to when the cold breeze in the room touched his bare chest.\n\u201cWe need to get this to Bruce.\u201d A voice that was distinctly not Tony\u2019s \u2013 and brought out a hint of irritation in Peter, because he was angry at it\u2026just not sure why \u2013 murmured. The second pair of hands that had stolen Peter\u2019s jacket pulled away.\nAsshole. Peter knew he didn\u2019t like that voice. First he\u2019d done\u2026something. Definitely something bad. And now he\u2019d stolen Peter\u2019s hoodie. Great. Just great. When Peter\u2019s addled mind finally figured out who it was, he was going to \u2013\nOh. Warm. Mmm. Warm.\nSomething delectably soft wrapped around Peter and the arms still holding him half-upright. God it was soft. Peter took it all back. The as-yet-unidentified-asshole could keep his hoodie. This was so much better \u2013\n\u201cTalk to him.\u201d The not-Tony voice said, tucking what had to be the nicest blanket that Peter had ever touched more firmly around him. Mmm. Maybe not such an asshole. Yeah. Whoever he was, he could stay \u2013 \u201cKeep him awake.\u201d\nAwake. Awake? Wasn\u2019t he already awake? Or maybe not. This blanket was the thing of dreams \u2013 and if so what was so wrong with that. Any dream with this kind of softness in it had to be a good dream. Sometimes Peter had good dreams. Sometimes he dreamt of going to Comic-Con with Ned and running into the ghost of Leonard Nimoy \u2013 who takes them aboard the real Enterprise before the three of them are whirled off to a different planet on some epic adventure.\nSometimes he dreamt about MJ. He wasn\u2019t so sure how he felt about those yet. Nothing ever happened! It was just the two of them, sitting around, talking or studying. Just a little bit of normality. Those dreams were soft too, but in a different way. They always left Peter feeling warm inside. He was always so rushed when they were really together \u2013 so aware of everything he kept from her. It was hard. In the dreams being with her was\u2026easy. Soft. There were no vultures, or spiders. Just Peter and MJ. Getting coffee, or hanging out in the park \u2013 or breaking into the ice-rink on 11th and spending the night making a fool of themselves. Yeah. He\u2019d liked that dream a lot.\nUnfortunately for Peter, the good dreams weren\u2019t so common anymore.\nNow day\u2019s sleep was filled with images of falling buildings, and planes. Of coming home to find Aunt May gone. Or worse. Dead. That one happened a lot \u2013 and every time Peter spend the rest of the night sitting outside her bedroom door with his arms wrapped around his knees. The fear that, if he ventured to far away, something might happen always kept him there until the early hours of the next morning.\nHe couldn\u2019t loose her. He couldn\u2019t loose any of them \u2013 but always did. In his dreams they were ripped from him. One. By. One.\nMay. Ned.\nTony.\nAll gone.\nAnd with them, every part of Peter that matters.\n\u201cM-mr. Stark.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s voice sounded far away, even to his own hears.\nVaguely he knew that Tony had been talking while he faded in and out, but he\u2019d heard very little. And made sense of none.\nNothing really made sense anymore.\nMaybe this wasn\u2019t such a soft dream.\nSlowly Tony\u2019s face swam into focus. Peter was laying with his head in Tony\u2019s lap, the blanket half folded around them both, while Tony stared down at him. He had an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders, and the other resting on his chest \u2013 which was heaving. God, why couldn\u2019t he breathe? And how had he not noticed that he couldn\u2019t. What was happening? What was happening to him? He didn\u2019t like this this. He didn\u2019t \u2013\nThe arm around Peter\u2019s shoulder tightened, just a fraction. \u201cYou need to relax, kid.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounded like he was yelling through water. Could you yell through water? \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine \u2013 Bruce, Cap and I are going to fix you up \u2013 but you need to breathe. In-and-out. Nice and even-\u201d\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m falling.\u201d\nThe words trickled out of Peter\u2019s mouth before they\u2019d really even formed, but Tony understood them. Peter was sure. Because the next moment those hands were pressing down a little harder, a solid weight on his shoulder and chest.\nGrounding him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d Tony\u2019s was suddenly sharper than it had been all night. It broke through Peter\u2019s haze \u2013 filtering into the last part of his brain that was actually functioning, and Peter clung to it. Clung to the words as if they the last shred of his sanity.\nMaybe they were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019ve always got you, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAunt May had told Peter once about the worse hangover of her life. About how she\u2019d snuck out of her parent\u2019s house, with her boyfriend at the time, and two bottles of Wild Turkey, and sat around in an abandoned building until dawn. Not that she remembered any of it \u2013 actually she admitted to the night being a distant and constant blur.\nThe next morning, however, had been crystal clear.\nUnlike the bathroom where she spent the next 24 hours periodically heaving her guts out.\nPeter had always thought she exaggerated the story a little for his sakes \u2013 you know, really drive home the effects of binge-drinking. Etc. etc.\nHe was beginning to reconsider.\nPeter\u2019s entire body felt like it had been repeatedly crushed by a freight train. A freight train full of rhinoceros\u2019. A freight train full of rhinoceros\u2019, which had just eaten another freight train of rhinoceros\u2019 \u2013 freight train and all.\nAnd that was only his body.\nSomehow, despite there being so conceivable way, his head felt worse.\nPeter was legitimately concerned that his brain was dripping from his ears, and \u2013\n\u201cFinally gracing us with your presence?\u201d\nOh god. No. No noise. Never. Peter was taking a vow of silence. His poor, melting brain couldn\u2019t handle this.\n\"U-ugh. No. Shhh.\u201d\n\u201cDid you just shoosh me?\u201d Oh god, please stop. \u201cDid a shooshing sound actually just leave your lips, directed at me?\u201d\n\u201cAm I in hell?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice sounded like a forty-year old chain-smoker. Huh. That was new. \u201cAm in hell? Are you the devil?\u201d\nA strained chuckled forced its way into Peter\u2019s pounding ears. The chuckle sounded like it was almost seeping relief \u2013 which was majorly unfair, because Peter\u2019s head was giving him no relief at all.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in hell, kid.\u201d The voice went on, still chuckling. \u201cThat second part though \u2013 well, I can neither confirm nor deny.\u201d\n\u00a0Peter finally cracked at eye-lid.\n\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d\nTony smirked down at him from where he slouched in a chair next to the bed Peter was currently occupying.\n\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d\nPeter groaned. And then regretted it. All sounds were evil.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m dying.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2013 well, not anymore.\u201d Tony said, with a small shrug. Peter\u2019s eyes shot open. At his terrified expression, Tony went on. \u201cYou were. Sort of. Maybe. Doesn\u2019t really matter. You\u2019re no longer dying \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\nDespite his aching head, Peter hauled himself into a sitting position. He stared over at Tony, who was watching him with casual interest.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter breathed.\nTony\u2019s eyebrows shot upwards.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything do you?\u201d Tony asked. When Peter shook his head, Tony sighed and pulled himself up straighter in his chair. \u201cWell, turns out, you were having a study sleep-over with your \u2018man-in-the-chair\u2019, when you apparently heard something and took off in nothing but your sweats,\u201d the last word was hard. Tony\u2019s casual fa\u00e7ade was fading. Ah. Peter got the feeling he wasn\u2019t going to come off well in this story.\nTony didn\u2019t wait for Peter to comment before he plundered on.\n\u201cSteve managed to find a local girl who says she was trying to buy some \u2018good stuff\u2019 and the deal was going bad. Dealer wanted a little more than money.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes flickered up from where he had been fiddling with his phone, staring Peter down. Yeah. Peter was definitely in trouble. \u201cApparently, a bare-footed jogger raced to her rescue. And received a face full of \u2018ethereal\u2019 for his efforts when things turned violent.\u201d\nEthereal. What the hell was that?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super-potent, street hallucinogenic \u2013 which actually kills majority of its customers, so I don\u2019t imagine it will be popular for long.\u201d Tony elaborated, at the sight of Peter\u2019s confusion.\nPeter nodded, taking it all in.\nTony\u2019s gaze hardened.\n\u201cYou got lucky,\u201d Tony murmured. \u201cMost people would have died in just a few minutes.\u201d\nPeter nodded again. More slowly.\nTony leaned forward with sudden rigor, resting his elbows on his knees.\n\u201cYou know, it actually got me thinking though.\u201d He said, energetically. \u201cYou should really have a built in gas feature in your mask \u2013 oh, wait, you do!\u201d\nAh. Yeah.\nPeter went to explain \u2013 but Tony held up a silencing hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to yell at you. I\u2019m not. There\u2019s no point. You don\u2019t even remember doing it.\u201d Tony sighed. And then shrugged. \u201cAnd May\u2019s going to shout enough for the both of us when she gets here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Peter screeched \u2013 and then shuddered. Sound was still very much against him. \u201cYou told her!\u201d\n\u201cSure did.\u201d Tony said, leaning back in his chair with an irritating air of smugness. \u201cBecause \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 absolutely none of this was my fault.\u201d\nPeter threw himself back down to the bed with a groan \u2013 and then let out another, louder grown when his impact with the soft cushions pulsed angrily through his head.\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Tony asked, flipping casually through his phone again, after a few solid seconds of Peter groaning into the cushions. \u201cJust out of curiosity. And, you know, because you\u2019re probably going to be grounded for the next decade.\u201d\nPeter shrugged. And then regretted the shrug. God. He hurt everywhere.\n\u201cNot much to be honest. Just feelings. Mostly confusion.\u201d Peter muttered. He scrubbed an exhausted hand over his face. Slowly \u2013 very slowly \u2013 some of the feelings started to come back to him. It felt a little like looking into a kaleidoscope \u2013 except the colors were his thoughts. God, even trying to remember hurt his brain. \u201cIt kind of felt like I was floating away.\u201d\nEven saying the words brought the feeling back \u2013 and another feeling with it. Something soft. Something grounding.\n\u201cAnd then you were there, and I wasn\u2019t anymore.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes snapped back up. They were wide, and uncharacteristically-sunglasses-free. Without the tinted lenses there was nothing to hide the flicker of emotion behind his dark eyes \u2013 but before Peter could name it, or even be sure it was there, it was gone.\nReplaced with a suave smile and a smooth chuckle.\n\u201cCan\u2019t have you floating away \u2013 life would be so boring.\u201d Tony smirked. He rose to his feet smoothly, and paused.\nAfter a second of hesitation he leant down and clasped a gentle hand around Peter\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cGet some rest, kid.\u201d\n3.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOi, Penis!\u201d\nPeter heard the paper ball barreling towards his head as soon as it left Flash\u2019s hand. It sailed across the Chem. Lab at a frustratingly slow speed. Peter could have moved his head \u2013 just slightly \u2013 and it would have sailed right past and towards the front of the room where Mr. Lowe was attempting explain the molecular fusion.\nBut he did. He stayed where he was and let the paper hit him directly in the back of the head. Just like he always did.\nNed shot him a pitiful look from his next to Peter.\n\u201cJust ignore him.\u201d Ned leaned in and whispered \u2013 and then received a paper ball to the head, too, for his efforts.\n\u201cCome on, Penis \u2013 we just want to talk.\u201d Flash\u2019s voice carried across the murmuring classroom. Flash\u2019s posse snorted with laughter at the back of the classroom. \u201cGot any hot Avenger gossip for us? I mean \u2013 you\u2019re just so close to them all, they must tell you everything \u2013 so come on, spill. Seen Black Widow in the shower yet?\u201d\nWhen Peter didn\u2019t reply another paper ball collided with the side of his head. Peter\u2019s fists clenched around the desk.\n\u201cIgnore him \u2013 you still haven\u2019t told me what happened the other night!\u201d Ned\u2019s voiced hissed excitedly in his ear.\n\u201cI told you,\u201d Peter sighed, doing his best to actually pay attention to Mr. Lowe. And the web-formula currently setting in the draw of his desk. \u201cSome random drug dealer threw a handful of power in my face, and I spent the night stumbling around talking to clouds.\u201d\nNed\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAwesome.\u201d\nPeter swiveled to stare at him. \u201cNo dude, not awesome. I passed out on Mr. Stark\u2019s floor \u2013 and I have no idea what I said.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think you said anything?\u201d\n\u201cBecause, he keeps asking me what Leonard Nimoy and I are getting up too now day\u2019s!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned nodding slowly, his eyes somehow getting even wider. \u201cAwesome.\u201d\nPeter hung his head, using the momentary reprieve to check on his web formula. It was still sticking firmly to the desk.\nPeter poked at the webbing distractedly.\n\u201cAnd I think I punched Captain America,\u201d Peter added. \u201cAgain.\u201d Ned sucked in a startled breath and gave up all subtle pretenses. He swiveled fully towards Peter in his chair and gaped.\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Ned squeaked. \u201cWhy!?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Peter hissed, running an exhausted hand through his hair. \u201cAnd Mr. Stark wont tell me. He let it slip \u2013 and then wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about it.\u201d\n\u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Ned. Not wow. They live in the Tower now. I have to see them when I go over. And now the Captain and Bruce Banner know who I am.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. That kind of sucks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I feel bad. Before I left I heard the Captain chewing Mr. Stark out for letting me go to Germany.\u201d\nNed shrugged a little.\n\u201cHe kind of has a point. You were fourteen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s a dick.\u201d Peter retorted, pouring more of the web-formula into his beaker with a little too much force. \u201cTherefore his opinion is irrelevant.\u201d\nThe beaker started to bubble at once. Peter slammed the draw closed.\n\u201cAre he and Mr. Stark still not getting along?\u201d Ned asked, pulling away and leaning back over his quiz sheet just as Mr. Lowe past them by.\n\u201cNo, they are, which is worse. They\u2019re not like, buddy-buddy or anything, but Mr. Stark\u2019s just, like, letting him off the hook for everything. Like it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did happen?\u201d Ned asked, scribbling down on his quiz sheet. \u201cLike, in Siberia.\u201d\nPeter pulled his sheet closer and began reading the first question. Sort of. Not really.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d Peter huffed.\n\u201cThen how do you know it was all Captain America\u2019s fault?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Mr. Stark came back with the shit kicked out of him \u2013 and Cap didn\u2019t come back at all.\u201d Peter snapped. Ned paused, and looked up in surprise. Peter rarely lost his temper. Even before the whole spider-bite incident \u2013 and especially after. He couldn\u2019t afford to get angry. People could get hurt.\nBut he couldn\u2019t deny that the whole situation with the Avengers moving back in frustrated him.\nPeter sighed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d He admitted, dropping his voice when Mr. Lowe passed by their table. \u201cBut they were friends. And you don\u2019t do that to your friends.\u201d\nNed nodded, swiveled a little closer and open his mouth to reply.\nAnd then promptly shut it again when the sound of exploding glass echoed through the desk.\nThe whole classroom paused \u2013 looking around giddily for whoever had broken the beaker \u2013 and Mr. Lowe whirled around.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d He demanded.\nThe classroom stayed silent \u2013 gawking at each other.\n\u201cCome on, who broke something? This is the fourth time this week people. You need to be more careful. Who was it?\u201d\nAgain no one spoke up.\nThe desk-draw by Peter\u2019s feet began to push out on it\u2019s own \u2013 frothing over with web-serum. Shit.\nPeter slammed the draw closed with his feet. Struggling the hold in the expanding formula. Ned gawked down at it, terror written in every line of his face.\nEventually \u2013 when Mr. Lowe had looked over every desk and seen for his own eyes that everything was still in tact \u2013 the class went on. People turned back to their quizzes and Mr. Lowe got caught at the back of the room helping another student.\nAs soon as Peter was sure everyone\u2019s attention was elsewhere, he moved his foot slightly. The draw had stopped trying to erupt \u2013 which had to be an improvement \u2013 but when he finally slid it open what he found a solid square of web-formula, which took up every inch of the draw, he reconsidered.\nThe broken beaker was set right in the middle of the clear goo.\n\u201cAh crap.\u201d Peter muttered.\nNed, who was leaning over his shoulder, gawking down at the draw, nodded quickly.\nAnother paper ball hit Peter, square, in the back of the head.\n\u201cOh, Penis-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cSo they\u2019re all just living at the Tower now? That's so awesome.\"\nPeter and Ned were on the gym floor, Peter half way through a set of sit-ups, and straining to keep his movements slow and pained, with Ned holding his feet to the floor, still prodding him about his magical-dream-walk (as Tony had taken to calling it) the week before.\n\"Not all of them. I've only seen the Captain, Bruce and Rhodey so far. But I think the others are close by, you know, waiting for the outcome of whatever chats they're having.\"\nNed's excitement tripled, so much so that he was practically vibrating.\n\"What do you think they're talking about? Are they going reform?! Cause that would be totally awesome! You could be working with like the Scarlet witch, and the Winter Soldier, and-\"\n\"Oh yay, working with the guy who tried to break my entire body with his metal arm. Can't wait.\" Peter grumbled.\n\"So aweso-\"\n\"-No Ned. Not awesome.\"\n\"Oh come on. It was a fight. You can't really be angry that they fought back.\"\n\"I-I'm not. It's just. Look.\" Peter, finally finished his set, pulled himself upright and rested his arms on his knees. \"You didn't see Mr. Stark when he got back, okay, they messed him up. Like bad. Like real bad. The Winter Soldier is crazy.\" Peter ran a hand through his hair. \"And the Captain is a dick.\" He added a second later, under his breath.\n\"But you said the Captain helped you the other night?\" Ned asked as they swapped places on the mat. \"Didn't he hunt down the drug dealer or something?\"\n\"I guess.\" Peter grumbled, pressing his hands down on Ned's feet. \"Doesn't mean he's not a dick.\"\nNed shrugged. Helpful.\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is-\u201d\n\u201c-Penis!\nA shadow fell over Ned and Peter, and Ned fell silent.\nFlash stood above them both, in his pristine gym wear. His sweater tied across his chest like some kind of forty-year old vacation dad, about to head out for 18 holes of golf.\n\u201cYou actually going to show at the decathlon meet this weekend?\u201d\nPeter sighed.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you showed all the other times?\u201d Flash threw back \u2013 and Peter had to admit he had him a little. But come on. He\u2019d only missed like two training sessions this term. And not a single competition round. He was trying. He was really trying.\nJust some things were more important.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Flash prompted, moving forward so he was standing right in front of Peter who was still on his knees. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you show on the Thursday training a few weeks back?\u201d\n\nI was clinging to a car that was on the verge of falling of the Manhattan Bridge with three kids inside.\n\n\u201cOr the information night at the start of term?\u201d\n\nI accidently interrupted a drug-smuggling drop at the docks and got locked inside a shipping freight for two days. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t actually want to be on the team, you should just admit it and leave.\u201d Flash demanded. Oh god. Here they went again.\nEvery since Peter had come back to the team Flash had targeted him as the one to try and force out. Flash still stood as first alternate and \u2013 since they were getting pretty far into the school year and competitions \u2013 that was looking less and less likely to change. Much to his displeasure.\nMJ had refused to kick Peter out, despite his occasional absence, so Flash had resolved to make Peter leave all on his own. And god, was it getting annoying. If he\u2019d though Flash was making his life hard before \u2013 it was nothing compared to what he was suffering through now. Peter could barely make it through a class without Flash taunting him or attempting to get him kicked out of said class. Frustratingly he\u2019d succeeded on several occasions. So much so that Peter\u2019s grade performance was actually starting to slip \u2013 which was exactly what Flash wanted. If Peter\u2019s marks fell much more, he\u2019d be kicked off the team.\nAnd flash would be in.\n\u201c-no one wants you there-\u201d\n\u201c-No one wants you there, Flash.\u201d Ned cut in.\nHe\u2019d stopped his round of sit-ups and was now staring up at flash with clear distain.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the alternate for a reason. Because everyone else on the team is smarter-\u201d\n\u201cShut up, you fat shi-\u201d\nPeter was on his feet before Flash could blink.\nWith one hand Peter reached out and pushed Flash back, not hard, but just enough to send him stumbling back a few steps.\nAnd enough to get Peter in trouble.\n\u201c-Coach Wilson!\u201d\nAh shit.\n\u201cCouch Wilson! Parker shoved me-\u201d\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d Ned shouted, lunging to his feet as well. \u201cHe was harassing us!\u201d\nCoach Wilson dragged himself across the room to them \u2013 looking as if he\u2019d rather be anywhere else. Peter could sympathize.\n\u201cHe shoved me!\u201d Flash yelled, drowning out Ned\u2019s indignant cries. \u201cHe shoved me! I was just standing here, and he came up and-\u201d\nFlash was cut off suddenly when a volleyball flew in out of no where and collided forcefully with his face. He doubled over with a screech while Ned burst into laughter.\nPeter whirled around.\nA good five feet hind them was MJ, sitting on the belchers, seemingly ignoring them all as she sketched silently. The rather large stack of volleyballs beside her though was a pretty good give away though. No matter how good her poker face was.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Flash screeched, whirling around to MJ as well.\nHer eyes flicked up at them lazily. She shrugged.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cMy dainty, lady fingers slipped.\u201d\nIf possible, Ned began to laugh harder. Tears spilling out of the corner of his eyes at Flash\u2019s astounded expression.\n\u201cMiss Jones. Really?\u201d Coach Wilson sighed.\nMJ shrugged again, her attention moving back to her sketchbook.\n\u201cYou told me to go for the ball.\u201d\n\u201cIn the game. Go for the ball in the game.\u201d\n\u201cWhoops.\u201d\nCoach Wilson stared at her for a moment before shaking his head and stalking away without another word.\nFlash watched him go, gaping.\n\u201c-but Coach Wilson!\u201d Flash began, holding a hand to the side of his face where the volleyball had connected, and rushing after the older man. \u201cParker! He shoved me! Parker-\u201d\nThe Coach walked all the way across the gym, to the double doors, and exited.\nFlash followed \u2013 still squawking.\nPeter let out a burst of laughter. A smile lit up his whole face. Damn. That had been close.\nHe turned back to MJ. There was a small smirk on her lips too.\nAbandoning Ned \u2013 who looked on the cusp of a laughter induced stroke as he watched Flash flee the gym \u2013 Peter made his way over to MJ, who was still silently sketching.\n\u201cNice shot.\u201d Peter chuckled.\nShe shrugged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my gifts.\u201d She said, adding one last flourish to her sketch before turning it around for Peter to see.\nPeter almost joined Ned on the ground in a laughter-stroke.\nThe sketch was a cartoon image of Flash, every detail of him down the forty-year old vacation sweater, catching a volleyball to the face. The detail in it was amazing. She must have been drawing it all period.\nGod. Peter was pretty sure he was ready to propose marriage right then and there.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only mysterious one, Peter.\u201d MJ smirked, raising one eyebrow in silent challenge.\nPeter smiled again.\nAnd this time it didn\u2019t fade for hours.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bell was still ringing when Peter burst through the front doors at exactly three. With his bag flung over one shoulder he pounded down the front steps.\nOkay. He had a few hours until he was meeting May at home for dinner for one of her mystery surprise nights - hmm, maybe best to duck by the deli before any patrolling. Just in case. She'd been not so bad lately, but Peter could never quite shake the time she had tried to make paella from scratch, and somehow it had ended up tasting like some weird hybrid of off-gravy and gravel-\n\"Hey, Penis!\"\nSomething caught a hold of Peter's sweater and yanked him backwards. Only his quick reflexes saved him from tripping back up the stairs behind him.\nOnce he was steady again, about three quarters of the way down the steps - come on! He just wanted to go - he finally swirled around.\nFlash stood on the step above him, his arms now folded across his chest as he stared down mutinously at Peter.\n\"What the hell, Flash!?\"\n\"You need to pull out of the decathlon team.\"\nPeter groaned.\n\"How many times do I have to tell you this? No.\u201d Peter said. \"Do you want to hear me say it in Spanish? No.\" He added in a god-awful Spanish accent.\n\"Come on, Parker!\" Flash argued. \"We both know you don't really care about the team-\"\n\"-that's not true-\"\n\"-you're too busy faking an internship with Stark. Which no one believes, just so you know. So just quit! You're not doing anyone there any favors by hanging around-\"\n\"Shut up, okay, Flash. Answer is no.\" Peter said, turning away to start back down the stairs. \"Give it up already.\" Peter added, under his breath.\nBefore Peter could even turn all the way around hands were colliding with his back again. Only this time they weren't pulling. They were pushing.\nHard.\nNormally, the shove wouldn't have even made Peter stumble. Bonus of his Spider-ness.\nBut Flash had never actually pushed him before, and Peter wasn't expecting it at all.\nThat, and the fact one of Peter's feet had been hovering over the next step, made Peter stumble.\nAnd then fall.\nAh shit. This was actually going to hurt.\nBefore the hard, concrete steps could become acquainted with Peter's face though another set of hands caught him by the front of his sweater.\nHeaving himself back upright Peter's eyes flicked upward to the owner of those hands.\nOh shit.\nTony.\nHe'd totally forgotten that he'd arranged to meet Tony after school to go over upgrades for his suit. They met up every week nearly to tinker with the suit. Not much tinkering really happened though. Mostly they actually just sat around and played in Tony's lab. Tony had even let Peter have a look at some of Stark industries latest production plans - wanting his input. God, Peter though he'd die of happiness in that moment. And Tony was always so relaxed in the lab - like all of his problems with the other Avengers and the accords just evaporated when they were locked down there. It was incredible to watch the man work. He was like an engineering steam engine.\nNow, though, he was just a steam engine. One likely to run straight over Flash if Tony's expression was any indication. It was almost blank, but Peter could see the fury behind his tinted sunglasses. In the way he clamped his fists closed - one at his side and the other still gripping Peter's sweater.\n\"O-oh my god.\" Flash stammered, backing up a step, and almost tripping himself. His eyes were so wide Peter worried for a moment that they might actually pop out of his skull. \"You're T-Tony Stark.\"\nTony let the hand clenched around Peter's sweater fall once Peter was balanced on a step, taking a careful step forward - standing just above Peter and staring mutinously at Flash.\n\"And you would be?\"\nWow. Peter had always known Tony was a good businessman. He'd have to be. He owned a giant business. But, even with those few words, Peter was beginning to understand why it was such a good business.\nThe words were as cool as they were dismissive. If they'd been aimed at him Peter was sure he would have shrunk at least 2 feet.\n\"I-ugh-I-\"\n\"Name.\" Tony barked, harshly, cutting off Flash's stammers. Flash withdrew another step.\n\"F-Flash Thompson.\"\nTony's brows shot upwards.\n\"Seriously?\"\nWhen Flash did nothing but gape at the question Tony swiveled, looking down at Peter.\n\"Seriously?\" He asked again. Peter shrugged in confirmation. Tony's brows shot even higher - now in real danger of disappearing into his hairline.\n\"Seriously?\" Tony repeated once he had turned back to Flash.\nFlash made a small chocking noise.\n\"Christ.\" Tony breathed, with a small chuckle, \"No wonder you\u2019re a dick. Your parents screwed you good.\"\nFlash stammered an incomprehensible retort, but broke off quickly when Tony took another step forward and clasped a hand around Flash's shoulder tightly.\n\"Though not nearly as much as I'm going to screw you if I you ever do that again. Do I make myself clear?\"\nPeter was sure that Flash's head was going to bounce straight off at the speed he was nodding.\n\"Good.\" Tony smiled, all of his teeth glinting in a way that reminded Peter vaguely of a cartoon shark before it took someone's leg off. \"Now fuck off.\"\nIf Peter weren't still trying to wrap his head around the last few seconds of his life he would have laughed at the sight of Flash practically clawing his way up the stairs with his hands and feet, before disappearing inside.\nThere were a few other students milling out of the doors now - some stared as Flash fled back inside, but most gapped incredulously at Tony, who was making his way back down the stairs to Peter.\n\"Flash? Seriously?\" Tony asked again, jabbing a thumb in the direction of the door Flash had disappeared through. When Peter nodded Tony let out a bark of laughter. \"Christ. That's practically child cruelty.\"\nPeter laughed a little with him, his nervousness bleeding through badly. Lots of people were staring now.\nTony paused when he was eye to eye with Peter. All the laughter gone from his expression.\n\"What's with that?\" Tony asked seriously, nodding towards where Flash had been standing.\nPeter shrugged again.\n\"Nothing.\"\nTony stared.\n\"Really, it's nothing.\"\nPeter glanced around. Wow. They were really gathering a crowd now. On the plus side, Flash would never be able to claim his internship wasn't real again.\nBut. On the down side.\nEveryone was staring.\nWas this what it was like for Tony all the time? God. It sucked. Peter's insides felt like they were coiling and uncoiling at 100 miles an hour.\nOh god. Ohgodohgodohgodohgod.\nA hand latched on to Peter's sleeve and pulled him down the stairs.\nFor a wild moment Peter thought it was Flash - with a death with clearly, because Peter was fairly sure Tony wasn't joking with the life ruining comment - but the hands were gentle with him while they led him down the stairs and into a sleek, black car that was waiting at the curb.\nThe hands ushered Peter inside, and the quite, empty space seemed to shatter whatever had taken over him.\nShit. Had he just freaked out? At school? In front of everyone?\nAnd Tony?\nOh god, kill him now.\nTony slid into the car after Peter, slamming the door behind him.\n\u201cPunch it, Happy.\u201d\nHappy \u2013 who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, as per usual \u2013 sent a little nod in Peter\u2019s direction before pulling the car away from the school. Peter should have been pleased. Happy\u2019s reactions to him usually stayed within the range of frustration and exasperation \u2013 a nod was almost a hug in Happy speak.\nBut Peter was too distracted by the fact he had just freaked out in the middle of school.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, kid.\u201d Tony said.\nClearly Peter\u2019s mortification was written all over his face.\n\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it. Everyone freaks out sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Peter murmured. Why doesn\u2019t something ever try to eat him when he wants to be eaten.\n\u201cI grew up with this,\u201d Tony shrugged, leaning back in his seat and looking over at Peter. \u201cI had to get used to shoving cameras out of my face before I could even walk.\u201d\nWow. That sounded awful.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you wont have to get used to it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019ll avoid school-yard appearances where possible-\u201d\n\u201c-no you don\u2019t have to do that, it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mind-\u201d\n\u201c-though I will make an exception if that little asshole is going to be a problem.\u201d Tony plowed on over Peter.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Peter assured, staring down at his hands.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Tony asked, staring over at Peter. \u201cSo he\u2019s not the kid that\u2019s been harassing you for months?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter squeaked.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, May and I chat.\u201d Tony said, and then paused for a second. \u201cWell, mainly she calls me in the middle of the night to yell at me \u2013 but occasionally, after the yelling, we chat.\u201d Tony added thoughtfully. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this kids deal?\u201d\n\u201cHe wants on the decathlon team.\u201d Peter admitted, with a shrug. Trying his best to play it all down.\n\u201cAnd what? His plan to do that is to torment you until you withdraw?\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter muttered. He so didn\u2019t want to have this conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\u201cIf he\u2019s pushing you down stairs it\u2019s some kind of deal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d Peter insisted.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tony stressed with a shrug of his own. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of not.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re kind of not dealing with, Cap, so, you know, whatever.\u201d Peter snapped.\nThe car fell silent.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, painfully calm.\nOh god. He did not just say that. This is not happening.\nPeter shook his head manically.\n\u201cHappy, pull over.\u201d\nHappy steered the car to the edge of the road and slid into a park.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony said firmly, moving forward in his seat to look Peter in the eye. \u201cWhat is your problem with the Captain?\u201d\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d Peter stammered, eyes fixed on his hands. \u201cNothing. Forget I said anything. I didn\u2019t\u2026I-I didn\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201cStop deflecting.\" Tony ordered. Peter fell silent. \"You weren't happy when I told you Cap was moving in \u2013 and I got it, he did punch you a few times in the face \u2013 but you're nicer to criminals that shoot at you, which I strongly disagree with, but that's not the point right now.\"\nPeter remained silent.\n\"What's going on, Peter?\" Tony asked, all frustration slowly giving way to confusion. \"I thought you liked him. When I told you why we were going to Germany I was a little nervous you'd swap sides, you were that excited to meet him-\"\n\"-I would never do that.\" Peter insisted harshly, cutting Tony off. He would never have dared, usually, but he needed Tony to hear this. Needed him to believe it. \"I would never do that to you.\"\nTony stared at him as if he'd grown an extra head.\n\"I know you wouldn't.\" Tony said slowly. \"Kid, where is this all coming from? I don't-\"\n\"I know what happened in Siberia.\"\nThe words were barely a whisper, but Tony heard them.\n\"Happy, get out of the car.\"\n\"What?\" Happy barked from the front seat, where he'd been trying to look like he wasn't listening to every word. \"Come on, no-\"\n\"Oh yes,\" Tony cut him off, waving an impatient hand at him. \"Out. Now. Go get a double chocolate, vanilla syrup, extra pump espresso or something.\"\nHappy muttered mutinously but heaved himself out of the car nonetheless. Slamming the door closed behind him.\nAs soon as he was gone Tony's attention focused back on Peter, and he shrunk back a little. Dammit. Should have just kept his mouth shu-\n\"What do you mean?\" Tony's hard voice cut off Peter's internal berating. \"What do you know about Siberia?\"\nPeter considered staying silent, but the look on Tony's face told him that that wasn't going to be an option now.\n\"I know you went after the Captain.\" Peter murmured, fiddling with a hole in his sweater. \"I know you found him - and the Winter Soldier.\"\nPeter's hands clenched around his sleeves, and he refused to look up into the brown eyes he knew were staring at him.\n\"I know they nearly beat you to death.\"\nPeter heard Tony's teeth clench together.\nNeither of them said a word.\nTony was silent for so long that Peter was half expecting him to ask Peter to get out of the car. Maybe he should just go? Clearly Tony didn't want to talk about this. And why would he? God, Peter shouldn't have brought it up. Such a dick thing to say. Why not remind the man of the time his friend kicked the shit out of him. Yeah. Peter should just leave now, before he could make anything worse-\n\u201cHow did you find out about this?\u201d\nThe words slid out of Tony\u2019s still clenched teeth.\nPeter shrank lower in his seat.\n\u201cI was there when you called Happy.\u201d Peter muttered. \u201cOr in the next room, but Happy was shouting so I came to the doorway. I could hear you talking about the Captain.\u201d Peter fiddled some more with his sleeve. \u201cI could see what they\u2019d done to you.\u201d\nTony let out a pained sigh, and then \u2013 much to Peter\u2019s surprise \u2013 slid closer.\n\u201cWell, Happy and I are going to have a discussion about what a private conversation entails.\u201d Tony began, shooting a dirty look out the car window in the direction Happy had disappeared in. Guilt built up in Peter\u2019s chest. It hadn\u2019t been Happy\u2019s fault \u2013\n\u201cBut, you need to know that what happened was complicated.\u201d Tony went on. His voice faded a little. \u201cThere were mistakes made on both sides.\u201d\n\u201cBeating the crap out of a friend counts as a mistake?\u201d Peter asked, dubiously. Not bother to cloud his resentment.\n\u201cNo, but-\u201d Tony began again, but Peter cut him off. He\u2019d heard enough.\n\u201c-there are no buts. You don\u2019t do that. You just don\u2019t.\u201d Peter insisted, starting to get worked up.\n\u201c-it\u2019s complicated-\u201d\n\u201c-how is that complicated!\u201d Peter fumed. \u201cYou don\u2019t hurt your friends!\u201d\n\u201cPETER!\u201d\nPeter fell silent.\nTony took a deep breath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Tony insisted. Peter opened his mouth to argue but Tony held up a hand and plundered on. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, because I started the fight.\u201d\nThat rendered Peter silent.\nHe gaped at Tony for several seconds, not quite sure what to say to that.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d The word left Peter\u2019s lips in a breath of confusion. As soon as it had, though, Peter regretted it.\nTony\u2019s eyes fell, and he pulled away. All of the energy that seemed to seep from him, all of the time, just faded. Suddenly he seemed old. Tired.\n\u201cThe Winter Soldie-\u201d Tony said, but broke off. He stared out the car window for several seconds. Peter fidgeted nervously.\n\u201cJames Barnes,\u201d Tony began again. \u201cHas a long history.\u201d\nTony\u2019s eyes flicked back to Peter.\n\u201cUnlike Rogers, he wasn\u2019t always asleep.\u201d Tony leant back in his seat, resting against one of the car doors. \u201cAnd, when he was awake, he did\u2026things.\u201d\nPeter stared in confusion.\nTony sighed again.\n\u201cHe killed people. Lot\u2019s of people.\u201d Tony went on. \u201cAnd there are some who have broached the idea that he should be held accountable for those murders.\u201d\nIf possible Peter was suddenly more confused.\n\u201cBut, wasn\u2019t he brainwashed?\u201d Peter asked, slowly. \u201cLike, Hydra, they brainwashed him didn\u2019t they? It was all over the news. They released videos of him being conditioned like some kind of animal.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tony said. \u201cHe was.\u201d\n\u201cThen how is any of what he did his fault?\u201d Peter asked, lost. \u201cI mean, if he was brainwashed, then doesn\u2019t that kind of make him a victim as well?\u201d\nTony stared at Peter for so long that Peter was beginning to think he had finally over stepped. That the older man wasn\u2019t going to answer.\nHe was wrong.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tony said eventually. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d\n\u201cThen I-\u201d\n\u201c-look.\u201d Tony cut Peter off, leaning forwards so that his elbow rested on his knees, and his face sat at Peter\u2019s eye level. \u201cWhat happened in Siberia was an epic cock-up. Alright? We let out anger the better of us, and we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Tony said, watching Peter\u2019s expression carefully. \u201cBut the point I\u2019m trying to make is that the mistake was on us. As in all of us. Because, trust me, I gave just as good as I got.\u201d Tony smirked, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Captain\u2019s fault.\u201d He made a sour face as soon as the words left his lips, before hastily rephrasing them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t solely the Captain\u2019s fault. Okay?\u201d\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cAnd it definitely wasn\u2019t a good example of conflict resolution.\u201d Tony added, his typical bravo returning. \u201cIn the case of Flash, for example, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I would instead encourage a subtle emotional, and social crippling. You start with-\u201d\nThe driver\u2019s door swung open, and Happy slid inside. Hands full of some chocolaty, overflowing, Frappuccino.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Tony demanded.\nHappy swirled around.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He fumed. \u201cYou told me to go. You wanted to talk to the kid-\u201d\n\u201c-Yeah, and now we\u2019re done.\u201d Tony cut him off. \u201cCome on, chop chop. Lots to do tonight. We have to get through all the upgrades and home before the kid\u2019s curfew.\u201d\nHappy nodded jerkily, scrambling to turn the car back on.\n\u201cNo time for indulgences,\u201d Tony insisted, snatching the Frappuccino out of Happy\u2019s hands and shoving it into Peter\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Happy huffed. \u201cYou told me to go and get-\u201d\n\u201cTime is money.\u201d Tony stressed, and Happy finally pulled away from the curb.\nTony shot a wink at Peter, and Peter barely held in a chuckle.\nHe took a sip of the Frappuccino.\n\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, kid?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to be my favorite.\u201d\n\u201cDamn straight.\u201d\n\u00a04.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god, this is amazing!\" Peter gushed as soon as he was inside the training room. \"This is amazing. This is probably the best moment of my life - including that time Flash got a physics question wrong at a decathlon meet and MJ-\"\n\"Wow, kid.\" Tony chided. \"This is just a bit of a trial run, okay? See how everyone gets on.\"\n\"Yeah!\" Peter insisted, trying his best to seem professional despite his excitement making him want to literally bounce off the walls. \"Definitely. All just chilling. Chilling like a-\"\n\"For my sake please don't finish that sentence,\" Tony shook his head. \"We're just ten mature adults, coming together to see how we get along as a team now. Sort out the dynamics.\"\nPeter nodded manically and took another look around. God. This was so cool. The Avengers training room. The Avenger\u2019s training room! And he was actually going to train with them. Oh god. This was the best thing to even happen to him. Hands down. No questions. Not even any close comparisons \u2013\n\"Well, 9 and a half mature adults.\" Tony muttered, breaking off Peter\u2019s racing thoughts.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Peter argued, turning to shoot a light glare at Tony who was still waiting by the training room doors, \u201cI\u2019m at least two thirds.\u201d\n\u201cYou can be two-thirds if you stop gaping at everything and come and wait over here like a normal person.\u201d Tony waved him over. Peter followed, still craning his neck to take in every inch of the room.\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Tony began. \u201cWe\u2019re going to train for a few hours, make some small talk and try not to kill each other. Think you can handle that?\u201d\nPeter nodded again.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cThat makes one of us.\u201d\nBefore Peter could reply the double doors opened and Rhodey stepped inside, his bionic leg-crutches clunking loudly with each step inside the large room. He was dressed in a loose t-shirt and cargo pants. Ready to work.\n\u201cOh, thank-Christ you\u2019re here.\u201d Tony panted. He took a steadying breath that Peter hadn\u2019t realized he needed. Wow. He was really nervous about this. Should Peter be nervous about this?\n\u201cChill, I\u2019m here.\u201d Rhodey said, moving over to Tony. \u201cEveryone\u2019s arriving.\u201d\nTony nodded and began clicking his fingers nervously. Glancing about the room \u2013 or generally anywhere other than Rhodey and Peter. Peter moved forward, but Rhodey cut him off.\nHe moved towards Peter and clapped a hand on his shoulder.\n\u201cHow you doing, kid?\u201d\nPeter had met Rhodey a couple of times now. They\u2019d met when he\u2019d walked in on Tony trying to remove Peter\u2019s suit after some goon, breaking into a hardware store, had sprayed him in super adhesive. Not Peter\u2019s finest moment.\nRhodey, though, had been oddly cool with the whole thing.\nHe\u2019d barely even raised an eyebrow before asking where Tony kept his baking spray. When Tony had fallen into a panicked tangent about why he was not allowed to keep baking supplies in the penthouse \u2013 curtsy of Pepper and several failed attempts \u2013 Rhodey had simply held up a silencing hand, disappeared for several minutes and returned with a jumbo jar of peanut butter.\nNeedless to say, Peter was free in no time. But incredibly sticky.\nYeah. Really not his finest night.\nHe\u2019d run into Rhodey several more times since then, mainly in the Avengers Compound where Tony was still improving his bionic legs. They often sat around and ate pizza while Tony worked. It was nice. The man was just, so, constant. Nothing ever rattled him.\nPeter could see how he and Tony got along so well. Where Tony was a constant mirage of movement, Rhodey was solid and immoveable.\n\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Rhodey went on.\nPeter gave a shrug.\n\u201cThat kid, Flash, still giving you trouble.\u201d\nPeter shot an annoyed look at Tony \u2013 which the older man completely missed. Tony had started to pace across the doorway, hands fiddling with his sleeves, and gaze still fixed on anything but Peter and Rhodey. Peter\u2019s annoyance faded away. Wow. He was really nervous. Was there something Peter didn\u2019t know? Was this likely to end badly?\nPeter moved to take a step towards Tony again, but Rhodey moved just slightly to the side, blocking him.\n\u201cJust let him go.\u201d Rhodey murmured, not even needed to look over at his friend to know that he was panicking. \u201cHe\u2019s not so great with situations he can\u2019t predict with a mathematical algorithm.\u201d Rhodey explained. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine once everyone\u2019s here, and nobody spontaneously combusts.\u201d\nPeter nodded slowly.\nIt made sense, really. They hadn\u2019t all been in a room together since Germany, and that had ended\u2026badly.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Peter began, his own nervousness building. \u201cWho exactly is here?\u201d He asked. \u201cMr. Stark didn\u2019t really say\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll Steve\u2019s here,\u201d Rhodey said, leaning down and fiddling with a screw on his metal leg-braces. He shot a quick look up at Peter. \u201cTony says you already know that.\u201d Peter scowled again. Rhodey didn\u2019t push the subject. \u201cSame with Bruce, and Vision\u2019s been living here for the past year already, so he\u2019s here.\u201d Rhodey straightened back up. \u201cOther than that, Sam, Clint and Scott are all flying in from underneath whatever rock they\u2019ve been hiding under. And Natasha. I\u2019ve got no idea how she\u2019s getting here though, or where she\u2019s been, but she said she\u2019d be here so-\u201d\nThe training-room\u2019s double-doors swung open, and the woman herself walked in.\nShe was dressed in all black \u2013 just like the last time they met \u2013 but instead of a cat suit, she was dressed head-to-toe in tight fitting combat gear. Her blonde hair \u2013 wait, blonde? Wasn\u2019t she a redhead the last time they-\n\u201cDo you just wait out there for someone to talk about you, so you can make a dramatic appearance?\u201d Tony asked, finally pausing his pacing to glare at the Black Widow. The. Black. Widow.\nPeter was in the same room as the Black Widow.\n\u201cTony.\u201d Romanoff nodded. She glanced across the room. \u201cColonel Rhodes. Peter.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes widened.\nAs did Tony\u2019s, though not, Peter suspected, out of awe.\n\u201cHow do you know his name?\u201d Tony fumed. Romanoff smiled, just slightly.\nPeter\u2019s spider-sense tingled.\nThe double-doors opened again a head of messy brown-hair appeared.\nClint Barton. Hawkeye.\nOhmygodthiswasthebestdayofPeter\u2019slife.\n\u201cWe late?\u201d He asked, stepping all the way inside. \u201cSorry, bit of a piloting mishap. Turns out the pilot couldn\u2019t actually fly a plane-\u201d\n\u201c-I can fly a hell of a lot better than you can, you-\u201d\nSam Wilson followed Barton inside, his metallic wings securely fastened and folded up against his back. He scowled as he spoke.\nBarton cut him off.\n\u201c-giant metal, fairy wings don\u2019t count.\u201d Barton argued, \u201cA Quinjet is a sophisticated, and advanced piece of technology. Okay. Not even a close comparison to your glorified gliders-\u201d\n\u201c-my what! These wings are one of the most advanced aero-dynamic instruments in history-\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nBruce slipped in the doors behind the two men, took one look at them while they bickered, and moved towards Peter and Rhodey.\n\u201cHey Bruce,\u201d Peter waved. Bruce smiled a little.\n\u201cHi Peter, how you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cMuch better than last time.\u201d\nBruce let out a small chuckle, that didn\u2019t reach his eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\nRhodey shot them both a confused scowl.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two had met.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Peter said, enthusiastically. \u201cHe helped me when I was dying of a drug-overdose.\u201d\nRhodey\u2019s eyebrows rose, just an inch. Ah. Maybe not the best choice of words.\nPeter was spared from explaining when the last of the team wandered through the double-doors.\nVision, fully clad in slacks and a purple sweater, swept inside with his usual silence and grace, and a scrubby looking, brown-haired man followed him. Who was he? Peter didn\u2019t know him?\nBefore Peter could question it the doors opened one last time and Steve Rogers stepped through. He closed the door softly behind him.\n\u201cWe ready?\u201d He asked, glancing around at the many faces in the room.\nA few nodded in return, but most glanced over to Tony, who was standing with his arms folded near the wall of windows.\nFor a minute no one said anything.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony murmured. It traveled through the reinforced room. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d\nSteve nodded, glancing around at the others. Everyone stood slightly spread through the room. Peter, Bruce and Rhodey to the left of the door, Romanoff alone in the middle of the large room, Tony by the windows, Vision in back corner, Barton and Wilson just in front of the large doors, and the Captain and mystery guy barely through them. Ah. Peter was starting to see why Tony was so nervous.\nFor a really long moment no one said anything.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d The Captain said at last, breaking the silence and taking a large step into the room. \u201cWhere do we want to start?\u201d\n\u201cHow about introductions?\u201d Tony shrugged, nodding at the strange man standing hovering next to the Captain \u201cWhose this guy?\u201d\n\u201cOh, this is Scott Lang.\u201d Rogers said at once, waving a hand at the man, who gave an awkward wave of his own to the group. \u201cHe\u2019s-ugh-\u201d\n\u201cI was the dude in the red suit.\u201d Lang cut in when the Captain broke off, unsure. \u201cI was tiny, and then kinda big-\u201d\n\u201cGiant-tiny-red-dude!\u201d Peter yelled, eyes-wide. \u201cYeah, wow, you were awesome.\u201d\nEvery set of eyes in the room flicked to Peter.\nAh shit.\n\u201cYou are a child.\u201d Barton said, staring over at Peter in astonishment. Barton cast a stray look around at everyone else, all of which were still staring at Peter. \u201cThere is a child in the room.\u201d Barton clarified, as he couldn\u2019t quite compute that bit of information. \u201cWhose child are you exactly?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d\nThe gaping stares shot over to Tony.\n\u201cNot like that. Christ.\u201d Tony added. He waved a hand over at Peter, who still stood between Rhodey and Bruce, and suddenly felt a lot less enthused about this whole thing. \u201cEveryone this is Peter Parker, or Spiderman as YouTube has coined him.\u201d\nThat got the attention of the room.\n\u201cUm. How old is he?\u201d Wilson asked, his voice tense.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fifteen,\u201d Tony cut in, and then continued on over several outraged cries. \u201cAnd before any of you contest, he\u2019s about to kick all of your asses, so\u2026don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cJust because he can, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he should.\u201d Wilson argued, staring over at Peter with an unreadable expression. \u201cFifteen, Jesus, are you still in High School?\u201d\nPeter opened his mouth, but nothing came out but a chocked breath.\n\u201cHe is.\u201d Tony answered, pulling himself away from the windows and making his way over to Peter, Bruce and Rhodey, stropping just foot or so in front of Peter \u2013 half shielding him from the eyes of the other Avengers. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also far too stubborn to stop swinging from skyscrapers and attacking muggers, no matter how many people ask him to. So feel free to try.\u201d\nSeveral of the others opened their mouths to do just that \u2013 Wilson and Barton most animatedly \u2013 but the Captain cut them all off. His was voice calm, but eerily final. Peter couldn\u2019t imagine many people arguing with that voice. Himself included. Not that he wouldn\u2019t do just that if Rogers started to weigh in on Tony again \u2013 because that was not happening. At all. Peter would have a lot to argue about if that started up right in front of him. This was Peter\u2019s choice, not Tony\u2019s, and it the Captain had something to say about that he could say it to Peter\u2019s face, not \u2013\n\u201cPeter\u2019s a part of the team now, so he\u2019ll train with us like everyone else.\u201d Roger\u2019s voiced echoed through the training room, cutting off Peter\u2019s already enraged train-of-thought. Huh. That was not what he\u2019d been expecting. Judging by Tony\u2019s look of utter astonishment, the older man hadn\u2019t expected the support either. \u201cAny other questions before we get started?\u201d The Captain asked, staring around the room.\nLang raised a hand in the air, stirring several chuckles.\n\u201cUmm. Yeah.\u201d He started. \u201cWhat exactly do we do now?\u201d\nEven the Captain had no real answer for that one. Everyone stared silently around the room again. God. It was like waiting for the first person to rack up the nerve to dance at a school event. Someone always did, eventually, but the awkward loitering before hand always left Peter queasy.\nYou could have pounded through this awkward silence with a sledgehammer.\nSo of course, Romanoff did.\n\u201cWe hit each other repeatedly in the face.\" Romanoff said, her face even and arms crossed across her chest as she stood in the middle of the room. A silent challenge. \"Whose first?\"\nNo one said a word.\nPeter leaned closer to Bruce. \"She's joking right?\" He murmured.\n\u00a0She was in fact not joking.\nPeter watched in awe as Wilson, Barton and the Captain all faced off against the Widow - one at a time. Wilson was flipped onto the mat in just a couple of seconds. Peter wasn't entirely shocked at that though. What had shocked him was that the Captain eventually joined him. The fight had lasted much longer, it was clear that he was much more of a match for Romanoff, but Peter noticed at once that he was clearly reaching for her more than she was reaching back. It left him open. And she never was. Rogers was agile, sure, but he relied on his strength a lot as well. It was what he was known for really, and Peter was sure that in any other fight the combination of the two would have worked. But not in this one. Peter wasn't sure what it was. Whether it was Romanoff's speed, or her ability to turn every move against an opponent, or the fact that she seemed to know every move someone made before they made it, but the move Peter watched the more he was captivated. She never lost. She just didn't. Even when it came to Barton's round - and he lasted longer than both the Captain and Wilson, clearly more experienced with her particular brand of insane-ninja-skills - she didn't loose. Barton still hit the mat in the end, but he'd given just as good as he'd got.\nPeter was pretty sure he was in love. Or petrified. Definitely one of the two.\n\"Kid, at least try and make it look hard. You know, for the rest of us.\"\nScott Lang was next to Peter on one of the exercise mats, struggling through a round of push-ups while Peter flew through a set of his own.\nPeter grinned and smashed out the last few with a flourish. Scott let out an exaggerated sob and flopped to the ground, spread out like some kind of dilapidated worm.\nScott was weird, but kinda awesome. He was also just as new to the group as Peter, so the two had gravitated together when the group had divided up for a warm up (or to be beaten up in Wilson, Rogers and Barton's case).\nWarm up was a loose term though, as it ended up only being Peter and Scott that pumped through a few cardio sets. Rhodey - still out with his legs - had watched the fights, yelling suggestions, while Tony and Bruce hovered around the fighting mat as well. Vision had remained in the corner of the room. Just watching.\n\"What kind of a warm up is that?\" Wilson had called down to Tony and Bruce, halfway through his time with Natasha, and clearly needing a minute to catch his breath. He nodded over at their relaxed position by the mat.\n\"A scientific one,\" Tony had retorted without even a beat. \"We're running the odds on how many times you're going to hit the mat if you keep this up.\"\nWilson had barely had time to let out a sarcastic bark of laughter before Romanoff was on him again. And he was on the mat. Again.\nEven Peter gave up his rouse of warm-up to watch Romanoff and Barton go at it one more time. With Scott still face down on the mat beside him, no one was there to mock his for openly gaping. Which he was. Not even subtly. Especially when the match ended with Romanoff swinging her legs around Barton's throat and twisting him to the mat.\n\"I'm getting to old for this shit.\" Barton muttered, but he was smiling slightly as he heaved himself back upright. But the Widow had moved on.\nShe was staring at Peter now.\nOh shit.\n\"How about you, little spider?\" Romanoff murmured, smiling just enough to get Peter's spider sense tingling.\nPeter was on his feet with a hell yes on the edge of his tongue when Tony cut in.\n\"No.\" He called, not even bothering to look up from the phone he was typing on. \"There will be no breaking of the underage participants before we even get past the warm-up.\"\nRomanoff smirked but didn't protest.\n\"I think we're all warm now, anyway.\" Rogers agreed, moving back into the middle of the room. \"Why don't we all get suited up and head outside for some drills?\"\nThe team nodded and began to trudge out of the training room. Peter, who had his suit on under his sweats, pulled his mask out of the pocket of his hoodie and made his way over to Bruce who was heading out a glass-side door of the training room and into the garden.\n\"No suit?\" Peter asked as he caught up to the older man.\nBruce turned and, upon seeing Peter, smiled. \"No. I don't think the other guy's going to make an appearance today.\"\nPeter nodded absently. Tony had already told him not to push Bruce when it came to the hulk. They were lucky to have the man here at all at the moment.\n\"So what's up with Vision?\" Peter asked instead, matching Bruce's stride as they made their way down to an empty patch of grass at the back of the facility. \"Does he normally get in on these things?\"\n\"I'm not really sure,\" Bruce admitted, watching the android in question step straight through a wall and out onto the back lawn. Awesome. \"I've never trained with him before, but-\"\nBruce cut off suddenly.\n\"But what?!\" Peter pushed before he could stop himself, trying to keep his voice low.\nBruce sighed, but leaned a little closer to Peter.\n\"Wanda's not here.\"\nThe Scarlett Witch. Peter had noticed when she didn't show with the others, but he'd been so absorbed with the others that he'd forgotten to ask about it.\n\"Why?\" Peter asked. \"Wasn't she with the Captain.\"\n\"She was...\" Bruce began carefully, still watching Vision as he moved across the lawn to stand at the edge of the trees that lined the estate.\n\"And where is she now?\" Peter asked. He knew he should let the whole thing go. That clearly no one wanted to talk about it, but now they'd started on the topic Peter found himself brimming with curiosity. He'd admired these people for so long - it was just so captivating to be with, and hear about them, in person.\n\"No one knows.\"\nThat got Peter's attention.\n\"No one knows?\" Peter repeated, astonished. \"How can no one know?\"\n\"Apparently she left in the middle of the night while they were in Wakonda.\" Bruce explained. \"Left a note saying there were things she had to do, had to fix, and just disappeared.\"\n\"Wow.\" Peter breathed, glancing over to Vision as he started to however just an inch or two off the ground, head lifted to the sun.\n\"Yeah,\" Bruce agreed just as the doors to the compound opened and the others began spilling out. \"Best not to bring it up though.\" Bruce added softly as the other moved towards them. \"Tony and Steve have already had a row about it, and fighting is going to get us no where at the moment.\"\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cWhy would her not being here effect Vision though-\u201d\nPeter cut off sharply when the others started to reach them.\n\"Ready to go, kid?\" Tony asked, setting down the case, with his Iron-man suit inside, on the grass.\nBehind Tony, Rhodey was already in the War Machine suit, shooting up into the sky with Falcon hot on his tail. Scott was no where to be seen - meaning he was probably already tiny and slipping between them all - and Romanoff and Barton were at the edge of the lawn, talking too softly to hear.\nThe Captain was the last the make it down to the lawn. He was fully suited up - cowl and all - and running his hands over his shield.\nRogers looked up and met Tony's gaze for just a second, before nodding softly at the engineer. Tony returned the nod, just slightly, and the Captain ran his hands over the shield one more time before sliding it into place across his shoulders.\n\"Shall we?\" Tony called. Rogers nodded.\n\u00a0Peter took it all back. This was the greatest moment of his life.\nHe was flying through the air, swinging around the Avenger\u2019s facility while the Avengers battled around him. Tony had released a crate full of training bots, and they were now flitting through the air and along the ground while the Avenger\u2019s chased after them.\n\u201c-one on you\u2019re tail, Falcon.\u201d Barton called across the comms. from his perch at the edge of the facility, where he was firing arrow after arrow.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Falcon called, spinning up into the sky with the drone at his heels.\nPeter swung around the corner of the facility, webbing an unsuspecting drone of his own and catapulting it into the side of the building. It crumbled upon impact.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice echoed through the comms. \u201cMind the building. I just had her renovated.\u201d\n\u201cReally!?\u201d Falcon called from above them all, trying to throw off his tail in the clouds.\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Tony said, blasting a bot clean out of the sky. \u201cHad the whole kitchen redone.\u201d\n\u201cFinally get that soft-serve machine I told you about?\u201d Barton asked. An arrow whizzed by Peter and slammed into a bot that was shooting towards him. Awesome. Peter flipped backwards and shot out another web, swinging himself up towards the very top of the facility.\n\u201cYeah, and a waffle-maker that makes waffles in the shape of the Hulk. Had to special order that one-\u201d\n\u201cChatter!\u201d Rogers\u2019 voice cut them all off.\nGod. This was amazing. This was the best day of Peter\u2019s life.\nRogers was on the grass, beating bots to the ground left-right-and-center with his shield. Romanoff wasn\u2019t far behind, taking cover in the trees and surprising the bots that strayed in after her. She took each of them down with electric bracelets that Peter had absolutely no desire to get to know.\nVision was up in the clouds with Wilson, occasionally shooting down a beam from the jewel in his head and obliterating the bots. Rhodey and Tony were circling the compound, shooting down bots as they ringed around the entire group.\nBruce had gone inside as soon as the bots were released, already edgy and not really up for team bonding.\nScott was nowhere to be found. But every so often a bot would explode mid-air, and Peter could swear he saw something tiny fly off from the debris.\nYeah. Definitely the best day of his life.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve still got a bot biting at your heels, Wilson-\u201d\n\u201c-PETER MOVE!\u201d\nTony\u2019s voice cut through everything else.\nPeter, who had just shot a web into the side of the facility and was riding it down, looked up to see Falcon wiz up and over him. And directly through his webbing. The web formula snapped under the pressure of Falcon\u2019s sharp, steel wings, and then Peter was no longer gliding.\nHe was straight out falling.\n\u201cPETER!\u201d\nTony\u2019s voice echoed through the comms. but Peter barely noticed. He was too busy trying to shoot a new web onto the facility before he hit the ground. Hard.\nBut the snapped webbing seemed to have done something to his wrist-shooters because the left one was no longer working, and if he used the right the odd angle would propel him straight into the windows of the compound. The bullet and missile proof windows. Yeah. That didn't sound fun. Though neither did hitting the ground after a six-story drop, but Peter was very quickly running out of options-\nSomething solid slammed into Peter.\nMetallic arms wrapped around him in a death-grip and threw them both off to the side - slamming into the grass at an angle, with Peter clutched to the metal breastplate.\nDespite the angle, and landing on top of the hulking metal figure, Peter felt a couple of ribs give way as they hit the ground. His shoulder, too, popped hideously, and began to scream with pain. Peter clenched his teeth together to keep quiet.\nAs soon as they had skidded to a stop, though, Peter sprung up to his knees, leaning over the brilliant red Iron Man Suit beside him. Ribs and shoulder be damned.\n\"Oh my god! Mr. Stark are you okay!? What-\"\nThe suit, which was now half hurried in the grass, opened at once and Tony pulled himself out. He clawed his way to his knees, and across the grass to Peter.\n\"Jesus kid, are you okay?!\" Tony's hands reached out, one closing around Peter's undamaged shoulder as the other reached up and ripped the mask of Peter's head.\n\"I'm good. Really. Bit sore, but \u2013 what about you? T-that was a hard-\"\n\"Don't worry about me, kid.\" Tony sighed, tension draining out of him as soon as he\u2019d yanked the mask from Peter\u2019s face and could see that he was relatively unharmed. \"My suits are actually made to fall a few hundred feet, unlike your glorified tissue paper! Why didn't your parachute release!?\"\n\"Oh, ugh,\" Peter stammered, \"I meant to tell you about that, I kinda used it. A few days ago. I meant to-\u201d\n\u201cOh, for Christ sake kid. We talked about this. As soon as you use it you come to me, and we replace it. Do I need to put an automatic shut down in the suit, because I will! I will have Karen forcibly march your ass back here and-\u201d\n\u201c-everyone okay!\u201d\nThe others were starting to reach them now. Roger\u2019s being the first. He must have really floored it, because last time Peter saw him he was on the other side of the compound, but there he was skidding to a stop beside them both, breathing heavily.\n\u201cAre you both alright?\u201d He went on, eyes rolling over Peter and Tony.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re good.\u201d Tony sighed, beginning to heave himself up, \u201cOne of us is totally grounded from patrolling for a few days \u2013 Christ I sound like my dad, how does this keep happening \u2013 but other than that-\u201d\n\u201cAh, that arm does not look so fine.\u201d\nScott had popped back into normal size beside them all, and was staring down at Peter\u2019s dislocated arm with equal amounts of disgust and concern.\n\u201cWhat arm?\u201d Tony asked rounding back down on Peter and finally noticing the arm Peter was currently cradling to his chest. \u201cKid!?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter gushed, pushing up to his feet with his good hand and grimacing when it put pressure on his ribs. \u201cReally. It\u2019s just dislocated. It\u2019ll be fine in a few hours. Same with my ribs.\u201d\n\u201cWhat ribs?!\u201d Tony protested, moving closer to Peter and seizing his good shoulder again before running a gentle hand across Peter\u2019s torso. Peter couldn\u2019t help the groan that slipped through his lips when his ribs protested painfully at even the gentle pressure.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tony said, pulling away and resting a hand on Peter\u2019s back, marching him towards the compound. \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d\n\u201cNo! No. Really. I can still help. I-I can-\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Tony cut Peter off. \u201cHave a date with an X-ray and a very large icepack.\u201d\nPeter groaned, but didn\u2019t bother arguing.\nHe could already feel his shoulder trying to heal \u2013 but with the bone out of place the whole thing was starting to set a little strangely. Yeah. Probably better to fix that.\n\u00a0\u201c-Brucie-bear!\u201d Tony called, plundering through several different cupboards in the medical room. \u201cWhere are the micro-freezers?\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice called from another room down the hall \u2013 where he was taking a closer look at the X-rays of Peter\u2019s ribs.\n\u201cThe micro-freezers,\u201d Tony screamed back, heaving a frustrated sigh when he came up empty in another cupboard. \u201cYou know. The mini, instant, icepack things I made a few months back.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tony.\u201d Bruce called. \u201cJust use a real icepack.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony groaned, slipping out of the med-room and into the hallway.\nHis voiced echoed loudly through the compound\u2019s basement level.\n\u201cThese were so cool! They set on the skin and-\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they burn you the first time you used them?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But I fixed all that-\u201d\nPeter was sprawled out on a med-bed, newly aligned shoulder strapped down to ensure everything stayed where it was supposed to while it healed. His ribs had been looked at, and deemed a clean break, so there was nothing to do but wait for it all to heal. It\u2019d only be a few hours. But still, a few hours of lying around doing nothing. Ugh.\nAt least Tony had been entertaining to watch as he flitted about the med-room playing with all of the equipment. That is, until Bruce had come in and banned him from touching anything after he got halfway through making a sentient defibrillator. Tony had been naturally outraged, while Bruce\u2019s exasperation rose with every syllable.\n\"Tony you made an AI out of a blender.\" Bruce had reminded him, eying him critically.\n\"Wha-\" Tony had squeaked, pressing a shocked hand to his heart. \"You love Frederic-\"\n\"-and you can't even use the blender anymore! As soon as you start to put anything in, it turns on and tries to blend your fingers off!\"\n\"He's vivacious.\" Tony insisted, with a shrug. \"And he likes blueberries, so you have to put them in first.\u201d\nThe whole conversation had come to a dramatic ending when Bruce had all but banned Tony from the room, and Tony had stalked around in search of his micro-freezers \u2013 which Peter was honestly not sold on. Though he would take a real icepack right about now. The joints in his shoulder were really starting to ache.\n\u201c-here.\u201d\nA frozen bag of peas appeared under Peter\u2019s nose.\nPeter looked up at Rogers, who had appeared in the room out of nowhere.\nThe others had called off the training exercise as soon as Peter had fallen. They\u2019d all loitered a little while Bruce looked him over, but once he\u2019d been given the all clear they\u2019d all dispersed so shower and settle in for the night. All except Tony and Bruce, who had hung around to bicker and keep Peter company.\nPeter had assumed Rogers had cleared out with the others, but apparently not.\n\u201cPeas?\u201d Peter asked, probably a little more dryly than the man deserved. He was trying to be nice after all. Sort of. Maybe. \u201cReally?\u201d\nRogers shrugged, setting them down next to Peter on the bed. \u201cI can go find Tony and his skin melting micro-freezers if you like?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d Peter denied quickly, pulling the peas towards him and pressing them hard against his shoulder. \u201cThese are fine.\u201d\nRogers nodded a little awkwardly, but he didn\u2019t leave.\n\u201cHow\u2019s school going? Anything-\u201d He began, but Peter cut him off.\n\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t really want to make small talk with you.\u201d\nYeah. That was definitely harsh, but Peter really wasn\u2019t in the mood to be nice to Rogers. Not that he was even in the mood to be nice to Rogers. But if the Cap wanted to argue then \u2013\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes snapped up to meet the blue irises staring down at him softly. So damn sincere. Wait. What. A serious case of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over Peter, and he blamed it for throwing him off-guard, because before he knew it he was calling out to Rogers.\n\u201cMr. Stark told me what happened.\u201d Peter blabbered, and Rogers stopped midway to the door. \u201cIn Siberia.\u201d\nThe Captain turned, slowly, eyes falling on Peter again. Cautious eyes this time.\n\u201cHe did?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter went on. Well, he\u2019d dug himself into a hole, might as well make a crater out of it. \u201cHe said it was both of your fault\u2019s.\u201d Peter said carefully, watching Rogers for any hint of emotion. There was none. The man stared down at Peter solemnly. Never moving to interrupt. \u201cThat the whole thing, blowing way out of hand, it was kinda everyone loosing their cool-\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nScratch that interrupt part.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked, thrown off. God. If this asshole was about to blame the whole thing on Tony then Peter was \u2013\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s fault. And it certainly wasn\u2019t Tony\u2019s.\u201d Rogers said, his eyes never falling. \u201cIt was mine. Just mine.\u201d There was a sternness in his voice that Peter hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let Tony tell you any different.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013 he said-\u201d\n\u201c-I let my personal feelings on \u2013 well, just about everything \u2013 get the better of me. And Tony paid for it. So did Rhodey. And the others. You. None of us should have been at that airport. Or in Siberia. And if I\u2019d just been honest with Tony from the beginning, we wouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d\nThat rendered Peter silent. Rogers sighed, and then moved forward. He took a seat on the edge of the bed, by Peter\u2019s legs.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Peter asked, when his head finally wrapped around the Captain\u2019s words.\nRogers stared at him for a minute \u2013 taking in his evident confusion \u2013 before shaking his head softly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my story to tell.\u201d He said soberly. Something about his voice kept Peter from arguing that particular point.\nPeter opened his mouth to say something else, but Roger\u2019s spoke first. And Peter\u2019s words faded away.\n\u201cTony\u2019s a good man. Better than he knows, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got his six.\u201d Roger\u2019s said, a soft smile curving at his lips. It didn\u2019t reach his eyes though. \u201cHe needs someone to remind him of that every now and again.\u201d\nPeter sat up a little straighter.\n\u201cI do.\u201d Peter said firmly. \u201cHave his six.\u201d He added.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Rogers said without missing a beat. He leaned forward, just an inch. \u201cAnd I have yours.\u201d He said, staring straight into Peter\u2019s eyes. If it had been anyone else it might have been awkward, but from coming from Rogers the declaration held weight.\nSo. Damn. Sincere.\n\u201cI mean it. If you ever need anything, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Roger\u2019s said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Tony program my number into your suit. You can call me night or day. I\u2019ll answer.\u201d\nFor a second neither of them said anything. What do you say to that? Especially considering Peter was starting to feel really conflicted about that man. I mean, he still hurt Tony, and that was one hundred percent not okay no matter what had happened \u2013\n\u201cThis team-\u201d Steve said, breaking Peter from his wild thoughts. The Captain\u2019s eyes had fallen while Peter was lost in thought. They were now staring at his hands, which were clenched together tightly in his lap. \u201cThis team is the most important thing in the world to me, and I won\u2019t anyone on it down again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your friend?\u201d\nPeter hadn\u2019t meant to ask. He really hadn\u2019t. But, god, he was so curious. He hadn\u2019t dared bring it up with Tony, but he really wanted to know. He\u2019d been in Germany, seen the soldier, fought him, and yet he knew nothing.\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe.\u201d Rogers replied. \u201cA very long way away.\u201d He added gravely. \u201cTruth is, I clung to him when I found out he was alive. Clung to the idea of him, as if by holding onto him I could hold onto what little I had of my old world.\u201d Rogers\u2019 eyes drifted, and Peter didn\u2019t have to be psychic to know that he was an age away. And then he wasn\u2019t. His eyes were back, focused on Peter. Sad, yes. But not lost. \u201cBut this my world now, different as it is. I have friends here. Purpose. And I don\u2019t know where he fits in, in that. Or if he can.\u201d Rogers ran an exhausted hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know him anymore, not really. And he doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d\nPeter stared at the older man \u2013 half of him wanting to reach out, but not sure how.\nRogers cleared his throat and glanced back up at Peter, his face a little taken aback.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rogers\u2019 said, shaking his head, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear about all this. Get some rest, kid-\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2013 I do. I-I mean, if you want to tell me, I do. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Peter babbled. He glanced down to the bag of peas that were resting on his shoulder. It had just about stopped aching now.\n\u201cAnd I get it.\u201d Peter murmured. \u201cIf something happened to Ned \u2013 my friend \u2013 I think I\u2019d probably do some pretty stupid shit, too.\u201d\nRogers chuckled softly, but again, it didn\u2019t reach his eyes.\nHe pulled himself off the bed and to his feet, moving back towards to the door. Before he did though, he pressed a soft hand on Peter\u2019s uninjured shoulder.\n\u201cRest up, kid.\u201d\nPeter called out to him before he could disappear down the hall.\n\u201cRogers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSteve.\u201d Rogers corrected, turning back to Peter. \u201cYou can call me Steve.\u201d\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Peter said, testing the word on his tongue. It felt weird, but not wrong. \u201cTouch Mr. Stark again and I\u2019ll fling you off the Manhattan bridge. Hard.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyebrows rose almost all the way into his hair, but Rogers \u2013 Steve \u2013 was already gone.\nA crash sounded from a room at the other end of the basement, and Peter sat up a little higher \u2013 trying to peak down the hallway. A second later Bruce\u2019s voice echoed through the basement. Loudly.\n\u201cOh, for god sake, TONY!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe world was falling. Or at least Peter\u2019s was.\nAnd what did it really matter if the ground below his feet was still here, when what had kept him grounded to it was gone. All gone.\nAll dead.\nAll Peter\u2019s fault.\nHigher.\nThere was a voice in Peter\u2019s head \u2013 it had to be his though. Who else could get in there? Who else was left, too?\nHigher. It murmured. Higher. It will hurt less. Higher.\nBut god Peter\u2019s legs hurt. Every square inch of him ached, but he kept climbing, one stair at a time. That was all he had left in him. One foot in front of the other. He couldn\u2019t stop. Not ever. Stopping meant thinking. Thinking meant feeling.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t feel this. He just couldn\u2019t. It would kill him.\nHigher.\nHe clutched at the handrail, using it to haul himself up every time he stumbled, but he kept climbing. The concrete steps were cold on his bare feet. He\u2019d lost his shoes somewhere along the long walk home.\nThe white walls began to blur together. And Peter blurred with them.\nOh god. He was alone. Alone.\nHigher.\nPeter\u2019s hands slammed into the metal-door at the top of the staircase. It took him a full minute to realise that he couldn\u2019t go up any further, and when he did the thoughts that were threatening to kill him started to poor right back in. No. No, he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t think about this. Couldn\u2019t \u2013\nKeep going.\nThe door grinded against its metal frame loudly as Peter swung it open. The lock had been broken for as long as Peter had lived in the building, and because of that the roof had become a bit of a hideout for him when he was younger. He used to go up with a blanket, and a pair of binoculars, and watch the New York skyline. Uncle Ben or May would bring him hot chocolate and sit with him \u2013 Ben would talk about the planets, and May would talk to Peter about school. And when they ran out of things to talk about they\u2019d sing Beatles songs for hours. Or try to. They always botched the lyrics, and ended up making their own.\nMay.\nOh god. May.\nNo. No. He couldn\u2019t think about that. Not that.\nThe roof was deserted. It was only ten o\u2019clock, the city\u2019s nightlife barely kicking off below, but there was already chill in the air that swept through Peter and threatened to bring him to his knees.\nHe stumbled out of the staircase and onto the roof, his bare feet carrying him numbly towards the ledge. This wasn\u2019t real. Was it? This couldn\u2019t be real. The skyline was all wrong. It was\u2026empty. There was no more wonder in it. No more thrill. Peter had stared out across that skyline for majority of his life, and never once had he not been able to find something glorious about it. Possibilities hidden it.\nHe used to sit alone and watch the sky for hours just to catch a hint of red and gold soaring above Manhattan.\nBut the red and gold was gone.\nHe\u2019d fallen, and he wasn\u2019t getting back up.\nAnd neither was Peter.\nClimb onto the ledge.\nWhat. What? Wait \u2013\nClimb onto the ledge.\nHis feet were moving before he really knew what was happening. They were dragging him closer to the ledge. Stepping up onto the cool brick \u2013 and freezing there.\nPeter had never known New York to be silent. Not once. He\u2019d hated that in the beginning. How the sirens never seemed to stop, and the crowds never ended, but he\u2019d grown used to it. Now he couldn\u2019t imagine his life without that noise \u2013 without the constant reminder of life around him.\nIt was gone now. The noise and the life.\nOh god. What was he \u2013\nMove closer to the edge.\nPeter\u2019s feet inched forward.\nWhat was he doing? Why he up here? No. This was wrong. This was all wrong \u2013\n\nThey\u2019re gone. They\u2019re all gone. \n\n\nBecause of you.\n\nOh god. They were gone. What had he done?\nA choking sound ripped its way out of Peter\u2019s throat. The sheer force of the sob that heaved through his chest nearly sent him plummeting from the ledge.\nThe skyline blurred as tears burned at his eyes. Stained his cheeks. He couldn\u2019t breathe. Sobs were tearing through him now, taking every breath before he could choke it down.\nGod. He was dying.\nHe couldn\u2019t breath. He was dying \u2013\nA whirring sound erupted above Peter, but he could barely hear it above his own gasps for breath. It didn\u2019t matter anyway. Nothing mattered now. Everything that had mattered was gone.\nStep forward.\nThe voice in his head was soft. Reasonable. That sounded reasonable. Didn\u2019t it? But. No. Wait \u2013\nStep forward.\nGod his chest hurt. He couldn\u2019t breathe. It hurt so much \u2013\nSomething hard, and metallic landed on the roof behind him \u2013 and with a whoosh Peter wasn\u2019t alone on the roof anymore.\n\u201cKid?\u201d\nNo. No. Not his voice. Not now.\n\u201cKid?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter chocked out. He still couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re not here. You\u2019re real. You\u2019re gone.\u201d\nSomething inside Peter broke. He felt it. Somewhere deep in his chest something shattered, and the hole it left ached. Everything he was started to cave inside. His life. His future. It crumbled into that gaping hole.\nStep forward \u2013\n\u201c-I\u2019m not gone. I\u2019m not! I\u2019m right here. Just turn around. I\u2019m right here.\u201d\nDon\u2019t, the voice in his head whispered. Just step forward \u2013\n\u201c-Peter, turn around! Look at me!\u201d\nDon\u2019t. It\u2019s all a lie. Step forward \u2013\nThe voice in his head sounded so sure. So calm. So unlike Peter. He wanted to do what it said. Everything would be fine so long as he listened. Everything would be fine \u2013\nBut Peter had never been able to deny Tony.\nSlowly \u2013 more slowly than Peter had ever moved in his life \u2013 Peter glanced behind him.\nTony stood a few feet behind Peter, dressed in nothing but an oil stained tank and a pair of sweats \u2013 with his arms held out. His eyes were wide as they took Peter in.\nTerrified.\nOne of Tony\u2019s arms reached out a little further, and he took a small step forward.\n\u201cHey. Hey, it\u2019s just me.\u201d Tony breathed, inching forward. His hands were shaking. Peter couldn\u2019t look away. Tony\u2019s hands never shook. Never. He was an engineer. Steady hands were what he was known for \u2013 but they were definitely shaking now. \u201cJust me. Just Tony and Peter.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head. \u201cNo you\u2019re gone.\u201d\nEverything was gone now. The hole in his chest had swallowed everything Peter was. All he was left with a strange feeling of weightlessness.\nStep forward. Peter slid a foot towards the edge.\n\u201cNO!\u201d Tony lunged forward, but quickly ground to a halt when Peter turned back to him, drawing away, closer to the edge. \u201cNo, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m really here, I promise! J-just come down, and we can talk.\u201d\nPeter stared down at Tony blankly. He was vaguely aware that he was breathing again. His sobs had been swallowed by the hole in his chest as well. He was just numb now. Whatever had been suffocating him, though, must have been contagious because now Tony seemed to be having trouble breathing. The older man\u2019s chest was heaving, breaths coming in strained pants, as his incredibly wide eyes stared up at Peter. One hand still outstretched, and only a foot or so behind Peter.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re confused right now,\u201d Tony went on, hand never lowering. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t you. Okay? You don\u2019t want this.\u201d He said, words tripping over one another in his rush to get them out. \u201cYou remember? There was a man, a man who was infecting kids with something, and then they-they\u2026died. Remember? You caught one. You caught a boy falling from one of the buildings on twenty-third \u2013 saved his life. You must have started looking for the man \u2013 even when I told you not to!\u201d Tony broke off, heaving in a large breath that he looked like he desperately needed. If Peter weren\u2019t so sure that the man before him was a hallucination he would have been a little worried. He was so pale that Peter could see veins in his temples throbbing wildly \u2013 even in the dull, rooftop lighting. \u201cPeter, you don\u2019t want to do this. You need to remember. You need to remember the man \u2013 okay? I think he\u2019s gotten to you. Please. Y-You need to try and remember-\u201d\nPeter shook his head, hard. Trying to cast the image of Tony away. He wasn\u2019t real. He was just there to taunt him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gone.\u201d Peter muttered, his head still shaking. His vision was starting to blur. \u201cYou\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gone. I swear, I\u2019m right here, Peter.\u201d Tony argued, eyes wide and honest - as open as Peter had ever seen them. \u201cI\u2019m loosing about ten years off my life for every minute you stay up there, but other than that, just fine. J-just come down-\u201d\nNo. The other voice was back. No. Step forward. You\u2019ll feel better. This is what you deserve.\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t-\u201d Peter wasn\u2019t sure if he was talking to the voice or Tony. Or both. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to follow either. To step forward or back. He just stayed where he was, balanced on the edge of the rooftop.\n\u201cYou can! You can. Just one step \u2013 just take one step, and come down. Okay?\u201d Tony insisted, inching forwards again, with his hand still outstretched. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you. I-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter said, growing more agitated. His whole body was beginning to shake. \u201cYou\u2019re dead. Dead. You. May. Ned.\u201d Peter rambled. The words echoed from his lips, but were still cloudy in his mind. They were just so foreign to him that he couldn\u2019t make sense of them. \u201cMy fault. My fault.\u201d \u201cNo. No, we\u2019re not. I\u2019m right here, and May\u2019s just downstairs \u2013 I swear.\u201d Tony cut in, one hand still outstretched. \u201cAnd Ned, Ned\u2019s wherever Ned is, but I promise he\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all fine. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s been hurt. This man, he\u2019s done something to you \u2013 but it\u2019s okay, we can fix it. We\u2019re going to fix it, you and me, I promise. All you have to do is take my hand.\u201d\nPeter glanced down at that hand. It was just inches from him now. He could reach out and hold on without even stretching \u2013 and god he wanted to. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d been doing since the day he met Tony? Reaching out. Before then even.\nThe man had offered him so much. A mentor. A purpose.\nA friend.\nAnd Peter had reached out and taken all of it. It was all he\u2019d ever wanted. To mean something. To do something. And Tony had given him the chance to have, and do, both.\n\u201cStep down.\u201d Tony said again, his voice starting to break. He stared up at Peter. Terror in his eyes, as if Peter were the ghost among them, not Tony. \u201cPlease, Peter. Take my hand, and step down.\u201d\nTony had given him so much. So much.\nAnd Peter had disappointed him again, and again.\nAnd now \u2013 for the last time.\nStep forward.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201cNO!\u201d\nPeter slid one foot forward. And fell.\nOr, at least, he started to. He started to feel the air beneath him, and the familiar sense of weightlessness that came with falling through the streets he knew so well.\nAnd then something strong, and desperate, seized a hold of one of his arms and clung to him.\nTony was above him \u2013 halfway over the ledge himself in an attempt to keep Peter from falling the 30 odd floors to the pavement \u2013 gripping Peter\u2019s arm with one, strong hand.\n\u201cHold onto me!\u201d\nTony\u2019s voice screamed above Peter \u2013 but Peter couldn\u2019t really hear him. Or maybe he could \u2013 but words were fuzzy. Everything was becoming fuzzy.\nHe\u2019d done what he\u2019d been told to do. He jumped \u2013 just like the man said. But he didn\u2019t feel better. The man said he would feel better. That it would put everything right \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t right. It couldn\u2019t be.\nTony was still screaming.\n\u201cHold onto me!\u201d The older man yelled from above him \u2013 his breathing skyrocketing to hyperventilation as he clung to Peter with wild eyes. He was so pale now. He really must be dead. B-but. He was here. He was clinging to Peter. God. Peter\u2019s head was starting to ache.\nThe man had said. T-The man had said \u2013\n\u201c-don\u2019t let go!\u201d\nBut Peter had already.\nAnd now the world was letting go of him.\nSomewhere \u2013 in the distant reaches of his numb fingertips \u2013 Peter felt himself slipping. And then he was falling again.\u00a0\nSomething hard and cold smacked into Peter\u2019s back \u2013 knocking the air out of him. But then, whatever it was wasn\u2019t just on his back. It was circling his arms. His legs. Clasping around his chest and face. Encapsulating him. And then he was no longer falling.\nOr, he didn\u2019t think so.\nNo. Now he was flying.\nMaybe he\u2019d fallen already \u2013 hit the ground at a hundred miles an hour \u2013 and this was what came after. The man had promised it would make everything better. Was this it? Was this better?\nPeter\u2019s metal bound feet smacked into the ground, and then, without warning, his prison opened and Peter crumpled. Every inch of him was numb now. Nothing moved. Nothing had to \u2013 he\u2019d fulfilled his purpose. He\u2019d jumped.\nThe man hadn\u2019t told him what to do after.\nBefore Peter could hit the ground something else grabbed a hold of him. This something was warm though. Its grip on Peter was strong, and unyielding, but it was warm. So different from the cold air, the cool concrete and his metal prison.\n\u201c-Peter!? Christ, please, PETER!?\u201d\nPeter felt himself being lowered to the ground. It was cool concrete \u2013 but not pavement. It was too smooth to be pavement. Was he back on the roof?\nWith Tony?\n\u201cPeter!? Come on, Peter, look at me!\u201d\nThat same warmth wrapped around Peter. Fingertips slid along his scalp, while a warm hand against his chest. Those same fingertips pulled away from his head and pressed against his neck. They were shaking.\nTony?\nPeter was shaking too. But\u2026gently. He was swaying. The warm, solid, mass that he was pressed against was rocking, back and forth. And Peter was rocking with it.\nSlowly \u2013 so slowly \u2013 Tony\u2019s voice started to filter through the sieve that was Peter\u2019s brain.\n\u201c-No, no. Please. Christ no! Pleas-\u201d\nThe fingertips that were pressing into Peter\u2019s neck moved, fluttering up and down his neck before pressing down again, painfully hard.\nPeter could faintly feel his pulse beating against the fingers.\nAnd, apparently, so could whoever was holding him.\n\u201cOh god!\u201d The words came out as barely a breath, but Peter could feel them above him. Warm arms closed more firmly around him, and a forehead dropped down to rest on his own. \u201cOh Christ, thank-you. Thank-you.\u201d \u2018\nFor a few minutes there was nothing. Peter just\u2026existed. And so did the man above him. The man heaved in several breaths \u2013 Peter rising and falling with each one as he was still clenched against his chest \u2013 and continued to rock.\nIt sounded like Tony. Hell \u2013 it even felt like Tony.\nPeter knew those hands. They were scarred and rough. Calloused to the core. They swept over Peter\u2019s hands when they were in the lab, working on the detailed sections of his web shooters. They clapped him on the shoulder more times then he could count. And damn were they strong. He thought it every time he did something stupid, or dangerous, and those hands clasped onto him like chains. Engineer\u2019s hands. Strong and steady.\nBut the man had said he was gone.\nThe man had said \u2013\n\u201c-Peter. Peter! You need to look at me. Look at me! Come on, give me something, kid, please-\u201d\nThose fingertips were on his face again. Ghosting over his forehead, and eyes. Hovering over his lips as he breathed.\nAt the feeling of Peter\u2019s breath against his finger the man clutching Peter let out another heaving breath, and the hand on Peter\u2019s face disappeared for a moment.\nPeter faded with it.\n\u201c-Bruce! Bruce.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice broke back through the haze.\n\u201cYeah, I have him. H-he didn\u2019t fall. Or he did \u2013 he just didn\u2019t. He d-didn\u2019t \u2013 I have him. I have him, but he\u2019s not okay. His eyes are open, but he\u2019s not responding.\u201d\nHuh. Peter\u2019s eyes were open? That was odd. He couldn\u2019t see anything. He couldn\u2019t\u2026well\u2026anything. He was so numb that he wasn\u2019t entirely sure he had a body at all anymore.\n\u201c-he has a pulse \u2013 but he\u2019s barely breathing. I need you to head down to the workshop, okay?\u201d Tony\u2019s rushed words swayed in and out. Peter only caught a few hear and there. He had more important things to worry about. Like whether he still had a body. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was a concern or not, but it was worth pondering.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new med-suit that I\u2019ve been working on, but it\u2019s still plugged into the configurator. You\u2019ll know the one when you see it. I need you to unplug everything and then set it to online \u2013 I can take-over from here \u2013 no. No. I need that suit. He\u2019s barely breathing as it is, okay, if he stops in the normal suit on the way \u2013 no, okay, just no. The one in the workshop has a respirator, so if \u2013 if anything happens mid-flight it can keep him alive until he gets there-\u201d\nPeter must still have a body. He was definitely tied down to something \u2013 and god was it heavy. And Tony was saying\u2026something. Something about breathing. You needed a body to do that right? And if you had a body, you needed to do it. Huh. Peter wasn\u2019t so sure that he was though. He couldn\u2019t feel \u2013\nHe couldn\u2019t feel \u2013 anything.\nHe didn\u2019t feel cold, or sore, or anything else that he probably should have been feeling. He could barely feel the flat hand that was rubbing roughly along his sternum \u2013 trying to spur some response from his heavy lungs.\n\u201c-come on, kid. I know you have good lungs.\u201d Tony\u2019s strained voice weaved into focus, breaking through Peter\u2019s thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you talk for hours without taking a breath. You need to use them. Come on, take a deep breath.\u201d\nThis was nothing like the man said it would be.\nHe had said Peter would be safe once he fell. Everyone would be safe \u2013 but he didn\u2019t feel safe. And Tony didn\u2019t sound safe. He sounded scared.\nThis wasn\u2019t what the man had promised. This wasn\u2019t\u2026right.\nPeter was not right.\n\u201c-my anxiety levels are already well off the charts tonight.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice cut through Peter\u2019s addled mind, \u201cWe are not adding in a few rounds of hysterical CPR, so, just, keep breathing. Okay? Keep breathing.\u201d\nKeep breathing. Keep breathing.\nPeter could do that. Couldn\u2019t he?\nAll of a sudden he wasn\u2019t so sure. God. He was really beginning to not like this. T-This nothingness. It was everywhere. It was in his hands, and his feet, which he still couldn\u2019t feel. It was in his bones and his chest. In his lungs \u2013 which, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t make move any more.\n\u201c-come on, kid \u2013 Peter \u2013 please, please, just keep breathing-\u201d\nKeep breathing. Keep breathing.\nKeep breathin-\n\u00a0\nThis wasn\u2019t what the man had promised.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter woke slowly \u2013 sunlight streaming into his eyes from every direction. God. Had he forgotten to close the blinds again? And, damn, that was some bright sunlight. Had he slept in? May was going to kill him if he was late for school. He had a calculus quiz, and decathlon practise, and god MJ was going to kill him if \u2013\nSomething pulled him back when he tried to sit up.\nReaching up he moved to rip whatever it was away, only to meet a long piece of plastic tubbing that wound around his face and under his noise.\nA nasal cannula.\nPeter\u2019s eyes shot open, and everything swum into focus.\nHe was in the Avengers Compound. The med-bay. Bare chested, and wrapped in a bundle of the softest blankets he\u2019d ever had the pleasure of meeting. His chest, though, which remained uncovered, was littered with monitoring wires and other, various, medical equipment.\nA heart-monitor was beeping steadily beside him.\nOh shit.\nMay was definitely going to kill him.\nAn echo of voices just down the hall from the med-bay broke him from his building panic. The door of the med-bay had been left slightly ajar \u2013 and Peter strained to make out the voices.\n\u201c-No. No. I don\u2019t care-\u201d\n\u201c-Tony-\u201d\n\u201c-I\u2019m going.\u201d\nIt was Tony and Steve \u2013 and they weren\u2019t being very quiet.\nPeter made an effort to calm his breathing, and keep his heart rate steady. The last thing he needed was for the machines around him to start going off, and for both men to come running in before Peter could work out what happened.\nHe knew from experience that Tony tended to downplay things when he got hurt. He never lied \u2013 Peter could tell at least that much \u2013 but it was always clear that Tony only gave him very abridged versions. Whether for Peter\u2019s sake or Tony\u2019s, Peter wasn\u2019t sure.\nAnd considering Peter remembered absolutely nothing he was pretty sure something bad had happened.\n\u201c-going where\u201d?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice echoed down the hall. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know where this man is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll find him.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice insisted, harshly. \u201cI have all the other victims locations \u2013 and Peters \u2013 he must circle somewhere around there. He\u2019ll pop up eventually-\u201d\n\u201c-and then what? You\u2019ll kill him? Right in the middle of New York \u2013 with hundreds of witnesses-\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Tony\u2019s voiced thundered. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking right I will. He\u2019s killing kids Steve.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s breath caught in his throat.\n\u201cEven the ones that don\u2019t throw themselves from skyscrapers, or bridges, half of them don\u2019t make it to medical help! Respiratory, and full cardiac, failure sets in pretty much straight away-\u201d\n\u201cI know. I know, Tony-\u201d\n\u201cNO! You don\u2019t know!\u201d Tony roared \u2013 loud enough to make even Peter flinch. \u201cYou don\u2019t know!\u201d\nTony\u2019s voice broke on the last word. The hallway fell silent.\n\u201cTony.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was soft now \u2013 its previous edge having faded away. \u201cTony, he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, I didn\u2019t-you weren\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d Steve\u2019s voiced stressed. \u201cBetween you and Bruce he\u2019s been checked over about a hundred times in the last few hours \u2013 and he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s breathing, he\u2019s moving. He\u2019s responding \u2013 just like the others who got to medical help in time. They were fine \u2013 and he\u2019s going to be too.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice paused, but then went on at a murmur. \u201cAnd when he is, what kind of example are you going to be setting.\u201d\nTony\u2019s silence was cutting.\n\u201cThis kid worships the ground you walk on.\u201d Steve implored, \u201cIf you go out there and kill this man, and get yourself thrown in prison, what does that say to him?\u201d\n\u201cIt says that kids are going to stop walking off buildings-\u201d Tony argued, \u201cHe touched my kid, I\u2019m not going to-\u201d\n\u201c-I\u2019m not suggesting that we let this stand. Not even slightly.\u201d Steve cut in, harshness returning. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing because I care about what happens to whoever this asshole is \u2013 I want to kill him too, believe me \u2013 but what I do care about is what happens this team. I\u2019m not going to let you throw your life away, and go to prison, when we can do this right. Together.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019d be okay with that?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice challenged, \u201cKilling him?\u201d\n\u201cThe man is killing children.\u201d Steve deadpanned. \u201cI\u2019d be very okay with that.\u201d\nThe two fell silent again.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Tony hummed, softly. \u201cMaybe you do have a dark side.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t sound all that displeased at the thought.\nPeter leaned over the side of the bed a little further \u2013 straining to hear more \u2013 but one of the wires attached to his chest pulled tight and the machine on Peter\u2019s left tilted dangerously.\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d\nThe machine crashed to the ground, cracking in several places and ripping the connecting wire from Peter\u2019s chest.\nTony and Steve scrambled inside the room.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! God, so sorry Mr. Stark.\u201d Peter gushed, sitting up and leaning further over the bed for the machine. \u201cI-I just \u2013 it fell \u2013 I got it. I swear I\u2019ll-\u201d\nStrong arms latched onto Peter\u2019s shoulders and heaved him upright on the bed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the damn machine,\u201d Tony said, not even sparing a glance at the clearly broken \u2013 probably very expensive \u2013 piece of medical equipment. \u201cLay down. How do you feel?\u201d Tony pushed Peter back down into his mound of pillows and took a seat on the edge of the bed \u2013 watching Peter warily. \u201cDo you know where you are? What happened? Does anything hurt? Your chest \u2013 does your chest hurt? Does it hurt to breath-\u201d\n\u201c-Tony.\u201d\nSteve had wound his way around the bed and was now leaning down on Peter\u2019s other side \u2013 taking him in with worried eyes. He let out a soft chuckle when Tony\u2019s eyes flicked up to him.\n\u201cHe might actually answer if you give him a second.\u201d\nTony didn\u2019t acknowledge the Captain, but when he turned his attention right back to Peter he stayed silent \u2013 heaving in several deep breaths.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Peter said at once. \u201cI feel fine. I just \u2013 what? What happened? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nSteve and Tony shared a look.\n\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d Tony asked, slowly. \u201cThe last thing?\u201d\n\u201cI-I was at the Deli on twenty-first.\u201d Peter said, struggling to put the hazy pieces together. \u201cWith Ned, I think. Ned was riling up Murph \u2013 Mr. Delmar\u2019s cat \u2013 and \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t \u2013 what happened?\u201d Panic started to set in. \u201cYou said kids were dying? Ned? Is Ned okay? What-\u201d\n\u201cNed\u2019s fine,\u201d Tony cut in, inching forward and placing a warm hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. So is May. Everyone\u2019s fine.\u201d He said. \u201cYou need to take a breath, okay, several preferably. Just relax.\u201d\n\u201cBut what happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Tony shot another look at Steve. \u201cWell, for lack of a better word, whammied.\u201d\n\u201cWhammied?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s a man who\u2019s been targeting kids around the city \u2013 and somehow he gets in their heads, and makes them-\u201d\nPeter\u2019s stomach dropped.\n\u201cMakes them what?\u201d Peter asked \u2013 but he had a feeling he already knew the answer.\nTony opened his mouth to answer, but the words seemed to catch in his throat. He stared at Peter. Eyes wide and\u2026lost.\n\u201cHe makes them walk off buildings, or bridges, anything tall enough to-\u201d Steve answered instead, his voice fading. Peter didn't need him to finish.\nPeter nodded slowly. \u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Steve, how many?\u201d\n\u201cEight.\u201d\n\u201cEight!\u201d Peter yelped, shooting upright despite Tony\u2019s attempts to keep him horizontal. \u201cIn one night?! How?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyebrows shot together, confusion in every line of his face.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony spoke finally, watching Peter warily again. \u201cWhat day did you go to the Deli with Ned?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d Peter said at once. \u201cTuesday.\u201d\nTony and Steve shared one last look.\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony began. \u201cToday is Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked, shaking his head. \u201cNo. No, I \u2013 but. Oh god. May. I have to call May \u2013 she\u2019ll be freaking out, I-\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey, calm down,\u201d Tony insisted, shoving Peter back into the pillows again. \u201cI called her, she knows where you are. And you\u2019ve only been here since last night, okay? Whatever he did to you, it must have messed with your head a little. Made you loose a few days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Peter asked, hesitantly. Not entirely sure he wanted an answer. \u201cOr, what did I do?\u201d\nFor a few seconds no one answered. Both men just stared down at Peter.\nFinally Steve opened his mouth to speak \u2013 but Tony cut him off.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything. He whammied you, you went for a bit of a wander, and then I found you. Got you back to the Compound and fixed up. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nPeter didn\u2019t know whether to be offended at the clear lie, or grateful. He got the impression that he really didn\u2019t want to know \u2013 but at the same time he really did.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Peter pressed, but his heart wasn\u2019t in it. If the other kids had\u2026then what had he done?\nTony stared at him for a moment.\n\u201cSomething nearly happened,\u201d The older man murmured, his voice low, and eyes fixed unwaveringly on Peter. \u201cVery nearly \u2013 but it didn\u2019t. And now you\u2019re fine. That\u2019s it.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice hardened at the end.\nPeter nodded.\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d Peter asked, more than ready to change the subject while he processed all of that. \u201cHow do we find him?\u201d\nTony\u2019s typical Tony-ness returned with a vigour.\n\u201cOh no, there is no \u2018we\u2019. There will be no \u2018we\u2019 in this. You\u2019re out.\u201d Tony said, leaning back and levelling a glare in Peter\u2019s direction. \u201cYou are confined to this room for at least the next two days, and-\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter argued, pushing against the arm that Tony held out to keep him from sitting up again. \u201cNo! I can help. Mr. Stark, please, I can-\u201d\n\u201cNope. You\u2019re benched.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cSteve!\u201d Peter appealed to the man across from him. \u201cCome on, please!\u201d\nSteve smiled softly, but shook his head. \u201cSorry Pete, Tony\u2019s right. You need to rest up. Let us handle this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat! No-\u201d\n\u201c-You heard the man,\u201d Tony cut him off, giving his shoulder one last squeeze before rising back to his feet. \u201cAmerica has spoken. Can\u2019t argue with that. So you rest up, and Cap and I are going to head out and deal with this-\u201d\n\u201c-that is no longer necessary.\u201d\nAll three of their heads snapped up to the doorway where Clint Barton was leaning against the frame lazily. He shot a smile at Peter, as he looked him over.\n\u201cYou look better kid. Feeling okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I feel fine-\u201d Peter said, but Tony cut him off.\n\u201c-what do you mean, \u2018no longer necessary\u2019?\u201d\nBarton stepped into the room, pulling a file out from where he had it pressed up against the doorway. He held it out to Tony.\n\u201cMeet Adrian Turner.\u201d Barton said, as Tony snatched the file from his hands and began scanning over it. \u201cHe met an untimely end early this morning when he threw himself off a ninety-three story building on Broadway.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is him.\u201d Steve said, leaning over the bed to read the file over Tony\u2019s shoulder. Peter rose a little, trying to do the same, but Steve pushed him back down with a gentle hand without taking his eyes off the file. Rude.\n\u201cWe have him on camera with one of the kids, doing something.\u201d Barton nodded. \u201cYou can\u2019t really see, but something happened, and then an hour later the kid jumped off his family\u2019s apartment building in Chelsea.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s dead. Turner.\u201d Tony said. It wasn\u2019t a question \u2013 but Barton answered anyway. Clearly sensing Tony\u2019s need for validation.\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tony shoved the file back into Barton\u2019s arms and pulled away from the bed. He spent the next several minutes fluttering about the room \u2013 cleaning up the broken medical equipment on the ground, checking over the other machines around Peter that were reading his vitals, and then dragging over a plush armchair that had been resting in the corner of the room.\nSteve and Clint exchanged a knowing glance, but before Peter could question it Barton was taking Tony\u2019s now vacated place on the bed.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pull this kind of shit with us, kid.\u201d He said, smirking. \u201cWe\u2019re all old men, we can\u2019t take it.\u201d He jerked a thumb towards Steve. \u201cEspecially him. He\u2019s like a hundred now \u2013 he can\u2019t take the stress.\u201d\nPeter huffed out a laugh, but couldn\u2019t keep himself from watching Tony out of the corner of his eye. He\u2019d abandoned the armchair by Peter\u2019s bed and had turned his attention back to one of the fancy machines in the corner of the room that was monitoring Peter. Steve wandered over and murmured quietly to him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d\nPeter eyes flicked back to Clint, whose voice had lowered to barely a murmur. But Peter could hear it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d Clint murmured again, his eyes never leaving Peter\u2019s. \u201cYou really freaked him out on this one.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes fell, shame wafting over him. Barton leaned forward, though, brushing a calloused hand over Peter\u2019s bare shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay. You, just, lie low, heal up, and stick to grand-theft bicycles for a week or so, and he\u2019ll be right as rain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Peter whispered.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Barton\u2019s voice, despite remaining low and out of range of both Tony and Steve, was hard. \u201cThis guy was a monster.\u201d\n\u201cBut I let him-\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t let him do anything. What he did was wrong \u2013 and nothing that stemmed from it was your fault.\u201d Barton argued, his voice leaving no room for argument. He was still murmuring \u2013 but there was a fire in his eyes. \u201cTrust me. I\u2019ve got some experience with mind-controlling assholes.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s brow crinkled in confusion.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the story one day,\u201d Barton said, nudging Peter\u2019s shoulder playfully. \u201cBut for now, rest. And if you need anyone to talk to anyone about what happened, I\u2019m here. And for a smart-ass, I\u2019m a decent listener.\u201d He shrugged.\nPeter couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony cut in. He was back at the end of the bed, with Steve leaning against the doorframe at the end of the room. \u201cWhat are you two talking about? Are you scheming? You two are not allowed to scheme. Okay? This building was not built to withstand your combined scheming forces.\u201d\nPeter opened his mouth to argue \u2013 but Barton beat him too it.\n\u201cDo your worst!\u201d Barton mock cried, swirling around to Tony and glaring at him in challenge. The edges of his mouth betrayed him though, twitching as he fought of a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get us to talk!\u201d\n\u201cOh, Christ, get out.\u201d Tony sighed, swatting the archer with a pillow from the opposite bed, before collapsing into the armchair he\u2019d moved to the edge of Peter\u2019s bed. \u201cMy migraine can\u2019t handle this right now.\u201d\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Barton agreed, good-naturedly, heaving himself off Peter\u2019s bed and moving towards Steve at the door. He threw a wink at Peter. \u201cOld man needs his beauty sleep.\u201d Peter barely held in a snicker and Tony launched the spare pillow across the room towards the archer.\nBarton ducked easily, cackling as he skipped out of the room.\nSteve followed him out, throwing a small smile towards Peter, and a nod at Tony, before ducking out the door.\nPeter sunk back into his sheets, pulling the mound of blankets over his bare torso and settling in \u2013 waiting for Tony to follow the others out.\nOnly, he didn\u2019t.\nInstead he, too, relaxed. He slouched down in the armchair, resting his feet at the edge of Peter\u2019s bed, and threw his head back to rest against the plush cushioning. Closing his eyes.\nPeter stared.\nAnd then stared some more.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony muttered, not even opening his eyes. \u201cStarting to get creepy, kid.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d Peter insisted.\nGod, he\u2019d taken up enough of the man\u2019s time. Peter honestly had no idea how long he\u2019d been in the Compound \u2013 but it must have been at least over-night from the way Tony described it. Peter must have taken him away from New York \u2013 and his huge work schedule. He shouldn\u2019t be wasting anymore time with \u2013\n\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d Tony muttered, slinking down in the armchair a little more to get comfortable, but not opening his eyes.\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to, really. I-I-\u201d Peter began, the sheets crinkling loudly as he shifted up on his elbows.\n\u201cI\u2019m staying, kid.\u201d Tony said again, still not opening his eyes. He reached out a hand and pushed Peter gently back down onto the bed. \u201cSo, stop talking, and get some sleep.\u201d\nPeter relented, sinking back down to the mattress and pulling the blankets back up. He shot a glance at the man beside him, sprawled across the armchair, and then closed his own eyes.\nHe was asleep within seconds.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take him to notice?\u201d\nClint was leaning against the observation window that looked into the med-room, staring over at Tony and Peter as they slept.\n\u201cNotice what?\u201d\nSteve stood behind him \u2013 his face buried in the file Clint had brought with him \u2013 but every so often he threw a glance over at the sleeping pair as well. Clint nodded towards Tony\u2019s prone figure in the armchair.\n\u201cThat he\u2019s practically adopted a child.\u201d Clint said. He stared down at the two for a moment longer. \u201cIt suits him.\u201d\nSteve didn\u2019t even bother hiding his next, quick, glance at the sleeping pair.\n\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s eyes fell back to the file a moment later.\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s it then?\u201d Steve asked, flicking through the last few pages. Soaking it all in. \u201cIt\u2019s all done. He just jumped off a building and did our job for us.\u201d\nClint shrugged.\nSteve\u2019s questioning silence spoke volumes.\n\u201cNatasha might have helped him.\u201d Clint admitted. Steve let out a put upon sigh, running an exhausted hand over his face. \u201cHe admitted to it. Everything. Every single kid \u2013 including Peter.\u201d Clint explained, and Steve looked up. Fire in his eyes. \u201cPeter caught him hassling a kid from his school \u2013 probably didn\u2019t even put two and two together before he got hit.\u201d\nSteve threw another glance towards the boy sleeping just on the other side of the glass.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nClint didn\u2019t need him to clarify the question. He knew exactly what he was asking. Clint had been asking himself the same thing since he heard about the first kid. \u201cHe said he was addicted to the feeling \u2013 told Natasha he was helping them find peace.\u201d\nClint spat the last word, his features twisting.\nSteve went back to the file. Flipping through it a little more aggressively.\n\u201cIs there anything to trace back to her?\u201d Steve asked. Clint threw him a disbelieving look \u2013 eyebrows in real danger of disappearing into his hairline. Steve nodded. \u201cWell then, I guess we can just put it all to bed.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Clint sighed, pulling away from the glass and shooting one last look at Tony and Peter. \u201cRight, well, I\u2019m going to head home, and hug my kids.\u201d He chuckled, but the sound was strained. Steve\u2019s face twisted in understanding. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join? I was thinking of having a fry-up?\u201d Clint went on.\nSteve shook his head softly.\n\u201cI might stick around here. Keep an eye on things.\u201d\nClint didn\u2019t need to follow his eye-line to know that he was still watching Tony and Peter.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be fine \u2013 both of them.\u201d Clint assured him, though he understood the trepidation. He\u2019d carry the memory of Tony, well over the edge of hysteria, tearing the unresponsive boy out of a med-suit on the Compound\u2019s front lawn for the rest of his life.\n\u201cI know that.\u201d Steve said with a small shrug. \u201cStill, I can help out for a few days while they get back on their feet.\u201d\nA short bark of laugher burst through Clint\u2019s lips.\n\u201cThe entire building is practically an AI. What exactly does it need help with?\u201d\n\u201cI can make a better breakfast spread than Dum-E.\" Steve argued, with a small smirk.\n\u201cThat is true.\u201d\nSteve nodded, and then paused, considering.\n\u201cWhat do mutated, spider teenagers eat for breakfast?\u201d He asked, brow furrowing. \u201cWell, if my thirteen year old boy is any indication \u2013 everything.\u201d Clint chuckled, moving towards the elevator just across from them both.\n\u201cI can handle that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd sleep deprived geniuses \u2013 when they can finally drag themselves away from their adorable, adopted children \u2013 eat coffee. No boiling required. He\u2019ll just eat the beans.\u201d Clint went on, stepping inside the metal elevator and moving to the side as Steve joined him.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I could put that in a pancake.\u201d\n+1\n\u00a0\n\u201c-and then we have the quarterly meeting with Devin from accounts, he\u2019s got some input about the new line coming out in fall-\u201d\nTony ran a hand across his face, attempting to sweep away the exhaustion that was setting there. And failing. Miserably.\nHe glanced down at Pepper\u2019s face, which was lighting up the screen of the laptop that sat in his lap on the bed, and sighed.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m pretty sure that when most couples video chat \u2013 after weeks of not seeing each other, mind \u2013 they usually skip all the accounts chat and head straight for the Netflix and chill kind of vibe.\u201d\nPepper\u2019s eyes flicked up from the report she was reading to him, staring at him through the computer screen, with a small smirk on her lips.\n\u201cNetflix and chill?\u201d She asked, eyebrows rising. \u201cTony, you\u2019re upstate and I\u2019m in Croatia.\u201d\n\u201cWe can make it work. I\u2019m a pretty imaginative guy.\u201d\nA short chuckled slipped out of Pepper\u2019s lips. Her eyes glanced down and a shuffling echoed through the speaker as she pushed her papers away.\n\u201cOh, I know.\u201d\nGod. That sultry tone had Tony adjusting the laptop that was still resting on his now quite tight, silk pyjama pants.\n\u201cReally?\u201d He murmured, sliding the laptop forward on the bed until it was resting on the edge and he was sprawled out on his stomach staring at Pepper. \u201cWhat is it that you know, Ms Potts?\u201d\nPepper leaned towards the screen slowly, resting her elbows on the desk that her own laptop was perched on and folding her hands under her chin to stare at Tony. Christ, that stare did something to Tony that \u2013 no matter how many times she levelled him with it \u2013 never went away.\n\u201cI know that you have a meeting with the secretary of state this morning at eight, and it\u2019s already three.\u201d She murmured, seductively. It took a full minute for the words to seep into Tony\u2019s brain. When they did, his face must have fallen, because Pepper let out a soft chuckle and leant back in her seat. \u201cGo to sleep, Tony.\u201d\nTony shook his head, running a hand through his hair and leaning up on an elbow of his own.\n\u201cNah, this view is way better than anything I can dream up.\u201d\nPepper\u2019s eyes sparkled. That grin grew.\n\u201cI thought you said you were imaginative?\u201d\n\u201cI am, but even I have my limits.\u201d Tony argued, leaning back down onto the bed and throwing a smirk of his own towards the laptop. \u201cThe mere image of you, Ms Potts, is too much for even this genius to invent-\u201d\nPepper was bent over, and in hysterics, before he could finish.\n\u201cOh, my god.\u201d She gasped. \u201cThat was awful.\u201d She threw her head back, whipping away tears that were escaping out of the corners of her eyes. \u201cThat was-\u201d\n\u201cRomantic.\u201d Tony insisted. Her chuckles erupted into full out laughter. \u201cI\u2019m being romantic.\u201d He argued. \u201cI\u2019m wooing, you just-\u201d\nTony cut off sharply when every light in the room flashed an ominous red \u2013 and then a booming alarm sounded all through the compound.\nPepper\u2019s hands shot up to cover her ears. Even through the computer speaker the alarm must have been deafening.\n\u201cWhat is that?!\u201d She yelled, eyes wide.\n\u201cI have to go.\u201d Tony shouted over the alarm, panic setting in. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 but I have to-\u201d\n\u201cTony!?\u201d\nTony shoved the laptop closed before Pepper had a chance to get another word out. He was up and off the bed a second later, scrambling for the sweatshirt he'd thrown across the room when he'd first collapsed on the bed. He shoved it over his head and wrenched open the door. No sooner had he taken a step into the large hall, than something large and warm collided with him. The force of the collision would have sent him to the ground if it weren't for the quick hands that caught him.\nSteve was a step behind him, equally frazzled, and gripping Tony's shoulders tightly to keep the smaller man from toppling over.\n\"What the hell is that?\" Steve panted, but the wild look in his eyes told Tony that, in the back of his mind, he knew already.\n\"Perimeter breach.\" Tony breathed. Steve's jaw tightened. The blonde threw a glance behind him - in the direction of the entrance hall.\n\"We need to gather the others-\"Steve began, but Tony was already miles ahead.\n\"Natasha, Vis and Bruce are here. Rhodey's in Manhattan so he can be here in minutes if I can get onto him-\"\n\"-Sam's here too, got in late last night-\"\n\"-PETER!\"\nTony pulled away, wrenching out of Steve's hold, and stumbled down the hall.\n\"Peter's here! I h-have to-\"\nSteve followed at once, and the two of them hurtled down the corridor towards the other rooms.\nThey barely made it two doors down before a massive boom echoed through the building, and the entire compound shook violently. Both Tony and Steve were thrown off their feet - colliding with the hallway wall painfully.\n\"What the fu \u2013 F.R.I.D.A.Y what's happening?!\" Tony ground out, pushing himself back to his feet. Steve practically sprung to his - the adrenaline activating every inch of the super in super-soldier - and reached down to haul Tony the rest of the way to his feat. Steve pushed him forward and the two were hurtling down the hall again.\n\"Several armed men have entered the facility through the north wall, sir.\" F.R.I.D.A.Y's voice echoed, but the sound was crackled.\nNorth wall? The mainframe. Damn them.\n\"F.R.I.D.A.Y shut everything down. We're going manual. Scramble all previous access codes and blow out the mainframe - literally. I want a boom of my own.\u201d Tony panted as they reached the end of the hall.\nWhere they promptly collided with Bruce and Peter.\nAll four of them opened their mouths to speak \u2013 confusion and panic coating every face \u2013 but another, billowing boom echoed through the compound and the ground around them shook again.\nTony seized a hold of Peter\u2019s arm and pulled the kid towards him, tucking him against his chest and covering him as best he could as the roof above them quaked ominously. Steve and Bruce braced as well \u2013 but after a moment of shaking the ground stilled, and the compound remained intact.\nBefore they could get back to their feet another body flew around the corner and nearly collided with Bruce. The doctor let out a short cry of surprise \u2013 and turned several shades greener \u2013 but at the sight of Sam, panting, beside him he began to relax.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on!?\u201d Sam cried.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being attacked.\u201d Steve answered shortly. He rested a hand on Bruce\u2019s shoulder, watching the man suck in several controlled breaths. Bruce gave him a short nod a moment later and Steve pulled away.\n\u201cI gathered that.\u201d Sam breathed, throwing a glance towards where the explosions had sounded. \u201cBy who? For what?\u201d\n\u201cNot a clue,\u201d Steve answered, before turning to Tony. \u201cThe second explosion, was that yours?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tony said, \u201cTrust me, when the mainframe blows we\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you blowing out the mainframe?\u201d Peter asked, his voice far quieter than the others \u2013 who were talking again \u2013 but it rang out to Tony. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be an asset to us?\u201d\nTony, who had released the kid from where he\u2019d been crushed against Tony\u2019s chest, looked down at him properly for the first time. He was ramrod straight, eyes flitting around the hallway at the slightest noise, and dressed in nothing but his pyjama pants, the too large I survived my trip to New York t-shirt that Tony had thrust upon him all those months ago, and his web-shooters \u2013 which Tony was beginning to suspect the kid never took off.\nThere was fear in his eyes though. Honest to god fear that cut straight through Tony, and made him want to march right outside and end these assholes now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only an asset to us for as long as we can control it,\u201d Tony answered honestly. The kid was smart \u2013 too smart for his own good half the time \u2013 and lying to him now would do nothing. As much as Tony hated himself for it, they were likely going to need him to get out of this. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have control for very much longer.\u201d\nPeter nodded sharply, throwing another glance down the hall.\n\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d Tony murmured, leaning closer in an effort to get the kid\u2019s attention and block out the rushed plan that was being made above both of their heads. Peter\u2019s wide eyes landed on him without hesitation \u2013 god dammit the raw faith in the kid\u2019s eyes was going to cripple him one day.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Tony said, no small amount of force behind the words. \u201cI\u2019m going to get us out of here \u2013 just stick with me.\u201d\nPeter nodded, a little more firmly this time, and Tony nodded with him. Okay. Good. Peter sorted. Peter safe.\nNow to the getting out of here part.\n\u201c-where is Vision?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s voice was strained, but steady. His soldier instincts had kicked in, and he was in full combat mode now. His plan so far had gotten no further than gather the team and find out what the hell is going on. Tony couldn\u2019t argue with either point.\n\u201c-he went for a walk earlier, but I don\u2019t know if he came back.\u201d Sam answered, the same readiness in his stance. \u201cAnd Natasha-\u201d\nThe compounds lighting \u2013 which had remained dimmed since the initial alarm had sounded \u2013 flashed a blinding white and then shorted. The hallway was thrown into pitch darkness for a second before the secondary red lights switched on and left them all bathed in scarlet shadows.\n\u201cEveryone brace \u2013 and cover your ears!\u201d Tony called, pulling Peter back towards him and shoving them both to the ground. A second later something strong, and solid settled over the both of them.\nSteve.\nTony didn\u2019t have a chance to question to super soldier before a blinding light erupted outside the compounds widows \u2013 and a second later the resounding boom echoed across likely the entirety of upstate New York.\nThe widows shattered immediately \u2013 glass raining down all around them \u2013 and the building shook once more. Only this time it was earth-rattling quakes that left Tony\u2019s teeth chattering and his heart racing faster than it had in a while. For a moment everything blurred. The building was vibrating far too much to focus on without vomiting, so Tony squeezed his eyes shut and moved his hand from over his ears to cover Peter\u2019s eyes as well.\nIt lasted only a couple of seconds, but it felt like hours before the building finally stilled.\nSilence followed.\n\u201cThat,\u201d Tony breathed, \u201c-was the mainframe blowing.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s weight disappeared as fast as it had come. Tony pulled back too, climbing to his feet and pulling Peter up with him. Tony ran an eye over him \u2013 a couple of glass scratches that were already healing, but other than that he was in one piece. The others were in relatively the same condition.\nSteve seemed to have taken the brunt of the glass, covering Tony and Peter who had been closest to the windows, but even he was sporting only a few scratches.\nA shadow fell on them all when another figure slid around the closest corner. Steve was in front of them all faster than Tony could even process, but a moment later the red lights glinted equally red hair and he pulled back in relief.\n\u201cNatasha.\u201d Steve sighed.\nThe woman ran an appraising eye over them all in the dark lighting and, when seemingly satisfied that they were all in one piece, relaxed just slightly.\nShe threw a smirk over at Tony.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cStill not a sharer I see.\u201d She murmured, nodding her head behind them \u2013 where the mainframe used to be.\nTony shrugged.\n\u201cNo one plays with my toys.\u201d\nNatasha stepped a little closer, and directly beneath one of the red lights, which illuminated the red droplets setting on her neck and the left side of her face. There were dark stains on her black tac-suit.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony asked, eyeing the stains. Steve and Sam \u2013 who had been looking over the damage \u2013 whipped around and focused in on the stains as well. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\u201cI took a detour \u2013 met one of our guests.\u201d Natasha said, running a casual finger over the droplets splattered across her face. \u201cNot very chatty, but he didn\u2019t need to be.\u201d\nShe brought up her other hand, in which was a set of high-tech, night-vision goggles.\n\u201cMilitary grade.\u201d Sam said, eyeing the goggles.\n\u201cNot just any military.\u201d Natasha added, throwing them over to Tony. \u201cThese are special order \u2013 recognise them?\u201d\nTony looked over them, and something deep in his gut clenched.\n\u201cRoss.\u201d\nNatasha nodded.\n\u201cFrom what I could tell from a quick sweep there are three teams \u2013 all of about twenty men. Two coming in from the east and one at the west.\u201d Natasha said. \u201cUsing the lake as cover.\u201d\nEveryone in the hallway froze.\n\u201cWhy is Ross attacking us?!\u201d Wilson hissed. He waved a hand at Tony. \u201cI thought you two were buds?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony drawled, his face pinching in frustration. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been getting along so well lately.\u201d When confusion clouded every face in the room, Tony sighed and went on. \u201cI broke his boat \u2013 I think he\u2019s taking it kind of personally.\u201d\n\u201cThat was you.\u201d Steve gaped. The others stared \u2013 confounded. \u201cThe cameras and the access panels were all down for maintenance when I got onto the raft \u2013 you did that!?\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes so forcefully that it almost made his dizzy. \u201cNo.\u201d He said, sarcasm dripping from him. \u201cThey just like to run hour long system reboots with four high priority prisoners on board.\u201d\n\u201cYou helped get us out?\u201d\nTony knew that Sam\u2019s absolute astonishment wasn\u2019t intended to hurt him \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t deny that it did a little. He\u2019d been trying. Christ, he\u2019d barely slept in the last month in an attempt to get the accords in some kind of order, but he supposed the mistrust was somewhat warranted. Still, it stung. He had \u2013 somewhere in the last few weeks \u2013 really started to value Sam. He was a good man. Fair and honest.\nAnd Tony was, well, Tony.\nHe\u2019d made one \u2013 or twelve thousand \u2013 too many mistakes to ever really be thought of as a good man.  \u201cWell, I helped put you in so it seemed kind of fair \u2013 but this probably isn\u2019t the best time to get into it.\u201d Tony murmured, tossing a glance of his own in the direction of what was surely a smouldering pile of his once beautiful mainframe.\n\u201cHe knew it was you.\u201d Natasha asked, nodding to herself as the pieces came together.\nTony shrugged.\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t exactly a long list of people who could hack into his glorified, floating, soda can.\u201d\nThat silenced the room for a couple of seconds.\n\u201cSixty men.\u201d Sam murmured finally, breaking the silence. \u201cKind of flattering.\u201d\nBruce let out a sigh of his own \u2013 his skin mercifully pink with only hints of green \u2013 and spoke for the first time since the shit-storm had started.\n\u201cWell this kind of complicates things \u2013 I mean they\u2019re not exactly an enemy. What do we do?\u201d\n\u201cWe run.\u201d Was Tony\u2019s immediate answer.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice cut in. Equal parts enraged and astonished. \u201cNo. We can\u2019t run. We can\u2019t just let this stand. They\u2019ve attacked us where we live \u2013 they just made themselves an enemy-\u201d\n\u201c-We can\u2019t fight-\u201d Tony started to argue. \u201c-The hell we can\u2019t.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice thundered over his.\n\u201c-We\u2019re locked out of the armoury.\u201d Tony cut both men off firmly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have access to any of the suits, or the weapons.\u201d\nThat got their attention.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam screeched, only for Steve to knock him painfully over the head in an effort to keep him quiet.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get in without the mainframe to open it.\u201d\n\u201cThen why the hell did you just blow it to shit?!\u201d Sam hissed, taking a heated step forwards.\nTony opened his mouth to argue, but Natasha beat him too it. She stepped between the two of them, staring over at Sam with a glint in her eyes that Tony would not be comfortable having directed at him. Sam seemed to feel the same. He took a step back instantly.\n\u201c-We were never going to get to it before they did.\u201d She said, calmly, but there was definitely a warning at the edge of the crisp tone. \u201cIt\u2019s better out of play altogether than in their hands.\u201d\nSam sighed \u2013 but nodded. Steve nodded as well.\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Steve said, nodding once at Tony before facing the group. \u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d \u201cFacing down sixty mercenaries without any weapons or back-up.\u201d Bruce outlined stonily.\nThe truth of their situation slammed into all of them, and they fell silent.\nBeside Tony, Peter hands were clenching and unclenching nervously. Tony shot the kid a glance, taking in the pale tint of his skin and the slight quiver of his hands.\nSteve opened his mouth to speak, but Tony cut him off.\nWith one last glance at Peter, Tony grabbed a handful of Steve\u2019s shirt and dragged him a few steps away \u2013 not out of sight of the others, but just far enough to give them a hint of privacy.\nSteve opened his mouth to speak, but Tony cut him off again.\n\u201cI know you want to fight \u2013 but we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d Tony stressed, softly. Careful of the enhanced ears behind him, and their owner who was staring over at Tony and Steve, and nervously abusing the hem of that I survived my trip to New York t-shirt. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Tony added, tearing his eyes away from Peter and looking back up and Steve. \u201cI\u2019m getting him out of here.\u201d\nThere was no room for argument in Tony\u2019s voice. He wasn\u2019t swaying on this. All of them were a part of this already \u2013 but Peter could be spared. He could go home to May like he was supposed to in a few days and never have to look back. If Ross found out about him \u2013\nThe sight of Wanda, bound and motionless in her cell on the raft struck him like the blast from a repulsor. Ross would take him. Tony was sure of it. Who was he after all? Not a world-famous super soldier. Not an army veteran. Not a renowned spy with hands in more international pies than any other person alive.\nNot the sole air to a multibillion-dollar tech company.\nHe was just a kid. Just a kid from Queens. A kid that Ross could snatch away, and no one would care.\nExcept Tony.\n\u201cI know that everything in you tells you to fight. It\u2019s just your nature. To stand and do something.\u201d Tony went on before Steve could try and interrupt. He swallowed heavily. \u201cTo plant your feet and say no, you move.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s eyes widened, his face twisting equal parts shock and pain. Tony knew the it was harsh to let the words dangle as he did \u2013 knew that this wasn\u2019t the right time to get into their shared past with Peggy \u2013 but god he needed Steve to understand.\n\u201cTony-\u201d\n\u201cYes. I was there. I knew her.\u201d Tony cut in, not ready to go into any further detail than that. She was a part of his life that he\u2019d shared with very few people. \u201cI knew her very well.\u201d He added. His voice lowered. \u201cShe is part of the reason you are here, that I am trying \u2013 and I am trying \u2013 but you need to understand that the world has changed. There are no battlefields anymore. Wars are fought at home now. With chlorine grenades in hospitals and pipe-bombs at pop-concerts, designed to blow up children.\u201d Tony ran an exhausted hand over his face. \u201cIf we fight, we escalate the shit-storm that is descending on us, and the people around us get hurt.\u201d\nThe words hung in the air for several seconds.\n\u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d Steve asked softly.\n\u201cRun.\u201d Tony stressed. \u201cBelieve it or not, but this could be good for us. Ross has shown his hand. He\u2019s loosing with the accords, and I\u2019m willing to bet this is some last ditch attempt to provoke a response that could get us put on the United Nations threat list. If it fails \u2013 if the compound is empty when he gets in \u2013 then nothing is on us. He\u2019s attacked us with no warning, and violated the terms we\u2019ve already set down. That could give us the leverage we need to finally push the last few points the council have been chewing on.\u201d Tony breathed, hope blossoming in his chest as Steve took in the words without obvious argument. \u201cIt\u2019s not a defeat \u2013 it\u2019s a tactical retreat.\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you.\u201d\nTony sighed, ready to argue, and then Steve\u2019s words sunk in. \u201cY-You-wait, what?\u201d\n\u201cI agree.\u201d Steve said again, his eyes flitting to the other behind them and hardening in resolve. \u201cMy issue is in the details. How do we run?\u201d He asked. \u201cIf we\u2019re locked out of the armoury, then I\u2019m also willing to bet we\u2019re locked out of the garage, and the hanger, and every other door that might lead to a form of transport. Short of physically running, I\u2019m all out of ideas.\u201d\nHuh. Tony actually hadn\u2019t gotten that far. He\u2019d been too focused on getting Steve to agree to the plan to really make one.\nTony opened his mouth to speak, but was silenced by a voice barely an inch behind him. \u201c-There\u2019s a farm-house about six miles up.\u201d Natasha said, causing Tony to jump and skid across to Steve\u2019s side. Natasha smirked. \u201cOur second closest neighbour.\u201d She elaborated, when neither Steve nor Tony seemed to catch on. \u201cRoss\u2019s teams are coming around the west side of the late, if we head along the north rim we could skirt around and be at the house in an hour.\u201d She explained. \u201cMr. Beauchamp is seventy-two, and a sweetheart.\u201d Wow. That word sounded wrong coming from her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to lend us a truck.\u201d\nTony shot her a look.\n\u201cDo you spy on all of our neighbours?\u201d He asked.\nShe tilted her head. \u201cDo you not?\u201d\n\u201cYou need professional help.\u201d Tony shot back. He opened his mouth to speak again, but before he could another boom echoed through the compound. The building shook so forcefully that it threw all of them off-balance, and to the floor.\nTony scrambled over to Peter, who was already halfway back to his feet. Damn, the kid was fast.\nPeter pulled Tony up with a strong hand, and Tony wrapped an arm securely around his shoulder.\nNatasha sprung up to her feet as well.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re inside.\u201d She murmured.\nSam pulled a now very green Bruce to his feet and cast a look around.\n\u201cThat would be our cue, then.\u201d\nTony nodded, shoving Peter forward and towards one of the blown out windows.\nTime to get the hell out of dodge.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStay next to me, and close to the ground.\u201d Tony murmured, pulling Peter along beside him as the six of them made their way silently around the lake. Peter nodded jerkily, not even trying to pull away from Tony\u2019s hand, which was fastened around the kid\u2019s upper arm. His silence was unnerving. The kid was never quiet. Not once since Tony met him. And now, despite how many times he\u2019d wished the kid would shut-it for just a couple of minutes, he found himself desperate to hear the kid jabber about something. Anything.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Tony breathed, pulling Peter down to take cover in the bushes near the lake when Steve waved a warning hand back to them. \u201cWe all are. We\u2019re going to get out of this.\u201d\nSteve and Natasha were ahead of them, just slightly. Leading the small group through the trees and manoeuvring them around the encroaching soldiers. Bruce was nearby Tony and Peter, taking cover behind a nearby tree.\nSam was a couple of feet behind them. Bring up the rear and making sure they weren\u2019t spotted from behind.\nA pack of soldiers appeared a couple of feet ahead of them. They tracked through the woods cautiously, automatic weapons raised and ready as they moved towards the compound. They disappeared after a few moments, and Steve waved the six of them on again.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony prompted softly when the kid didn\u2019t answer. Steve raised a hand again and they slid into the bushes for cover once more. Tony took the momentary pause to clamp his other hand onto Peter\u2019s shoulder and force the kid to look at him. His panic skyrocketed when the kid refused to look him in the eye. \u201cKid? I need you to tell me you\u2019re doing okay. Okay?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes crept up. The terror in them struck Tony hard. Damn this kid would be the end of him. Before Tony could ask what was wrong though \u2013 and how he could fix it \u2013 the kid spoke.\n\u201cWhat if he knows who I am?\u201d\nThe words were barely audible, but Tony caught them.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nPeter cast a look back towards the compound. \u201cRoss. What if he knows who I am?\u201d Peter breathed. He glanced up at Tony. \u201cWhat will happen to me? To May? My friends?\u201d He asked, the panic in his eyes growing. \u201cI can\u2019t be the reason something happens to them. I-I can\u2019t-\u201d\n\u201c-You won\u2019t.\u201d Tony cut him off, tightening the hand that he had clenched around Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNothing is going to happen.\u201d He assured the kid. \u201cRoss doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that-\u201d\n\u201cI do know that.\u201d Tony hissed, pushing the kid further down when a group of soldiers past them by. \u201cNot only do I know it \u2013 I\u2019ve ensured it.\u201d He went on, barely breathing the words, but sure that Peter could hear them. \u201cYou forget, I have access to every inch of his floating tin-can. I know every little piece of information that crosses his desk, and yours never will.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes snapped away from the soldiers and flicked up to look at Tony. Tony didn\u2019t look away. \u201cI have you, kid.\u201d He breathed. \u201cAnd I will burn Ross to the ground before he touches you, or anyone around you.\u201d\nThe smallest of smiles crept over Peter\u2019s face.\n\u201cThanks, Mr. Stark.\u201d\nTony snorted quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, kid.\u201d He breathed, pulling them both back up when Steve waved them all forward. \u201cI got you into this, remember?\u201d\nAnother explosion echoed behind them. Peter\u2019s head swung back towards the compound, a groan escaping his lips.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cI left my Spanish homework in there.\u201d Peter huffed after a couple of seconds.\nTony could have cried with relief. There was the kid he knew.\n\u201cI\u2019ll forge you a note.\u201d Tony promised lightly. \u201cYou should have seen some of my more impressive ones in high-school, once I even-\u201d\n\u201cGet down!\u201d\nTony slammed Peter into the ground as soon as the words tore out of Steve\u2019s lips.\nThey\u2019d been spotted.\nA halo of bullets rained down around them. Tony chanced a glance upwards as light flooded into the trees where they were taking cover.\nA helicopter. Shit.\n\u201cDammit, this makes things more difficult.\u201d\nSam appeared beside Tony and Peter, sharing Tony\u2019s sentiments exactly. Peter cast a glance upwards as well.\nAnd then he was no longer on the ground. Damn the kid was fast.\n\u201cI can take care of it.\u201d\nWith that he was gone.\nShooting a web up at the tree beside them, Peter hoisted himself into the air and took off after the helicopter.\n\u201cWhat?! No!\u201d Tony screamed after him. Another downpour of bullets was the only answer he got. Seizing a handful of Sam\u2019s shirt, Tony pulled them both beneath a close-by tree.\nTony leaned around the trunk wildly, struggling to catch sight of Peter.\n\u201cCan you see him?!\u201d Tony hissed at Sam \u2013 who was straining his neck around the other side of the tree in an effort to spot the kid as well.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sam breathed, ducking back around when the gunfire started up again. \u201cGod damn that kid is fast.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the others?!\u201d\nSam shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d\nA wild, and guttural, roar cut him off.\nTony\u2019s breath caught in his throat, and heart slammed against his chest,\nSam\u2019s eyes snapped up to his.\n\u201cIs that-\u201d Sam began, his eyes wide.\n\u201c-Bruce.\u201d Tony finished as the Hulk let another roar and the gunfire started up with even more ferocity.\nSam nodded. He leant back around the tree and froze. Tony followed his gaze and caught sight of the Hulk a few hundred feet away from them \u2013 tearing through dozens of soldiers in a wild rage.\n\u201cDoes this make things better or worse for us?\u201d Sam asked slowly.\nTony \u2013 who had already forgotten about the Hulk, and was once again searching the sky for any sign of Peter \u2013 didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cWe should-\u201d\nTony never found out what they should do. Before Sam could get the words out a light erupted a few dozen feet away from the two of them \u2013 and an explosion ripped through the forest.\nIt tore through the tree Sam and Tony were taking cover behind, thrusting the two of them forcefully forward.\nTony collided the trunk of a nearby tree \u2013 hard. He spilled out across the forest floor, skidding a couple of feet in the dirt.\nGod. Everything was spinning. And screaming. Tony\u2019s ears were ringing so loudly that he couldn\u2019t hear the gunfire anymore. Couldn\u2019t hear anything.\nHe tore his eyes open, fighting to make his retinas stop spinning, and failing.\nThey slid closed again after a moment \u2013 sight of small body hurtling towards the ground imprinted on his eyelids.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony came to sharply.\nThe sounds of gunfire, and the stench of smoke and scorched skin, never resulted in a slow or gentle return to consciousness for Tony. And unfortunately he was startlingly familiar with both.\nHe shot up to his feet, his head screaming its disagreement with being upright. There was blood running down the back of his neck, sliding down through his hair and disappearing beneath his sweatshirt, and his eyes refused to focus, but nevertheless he trudged through the forest. Keeping low to the ground he hunted for any sign of the others. Sam had been close to him \u2013 he could remember that much \u2013 but the others?\nA enraged roar coming from what remained of the compound told him where one of said team-mates were, but there was no sign of the others. Had Ross taken them? Killed them? Had he \u2013\nTony stopped dead in his tracks when his agonisingly muddled, and probably concussed, brain finally shifted through all of the information that had been thrown at it in the last hour since the security alarm had sounded. All of a sudden everything snapped into place.\nThe image of a small, frail, body being thrown from the sky flashed across his mind, replaying like a bad cassette recoding. Again. And again. And a hundred more times after that.\nPeter.\nPeter had fallen.\nPeter had fallen and Tony had done nothing.\nTony cast his eyes up, frantically searching the sky for even a glimpse of the kid. He wondered through the woods, sidestepping around small fires and praying for any hint of movement above. For any hint of that small, frustratingly fast, form.\nAnd then he found it. Only it was in the sky.\nThe terrifyingly small body was crumpled, and unmoving, at the edge of the lake. Water was streaming over untameable curls, bare feet, and soaking through the white I survived my trip to New York t-shirt that still left an unshakeable stab of guilt in Tony\u2019s chest every time he saw it. Every time, except that one moment when his eyes settled on Peter \u2013 unmoving, broken, and laying face down in the lake. Because in that one moment Tony\u2019s chest felt so hollow that nothing could have pierced it.\n\u201cPeter.\u201d\nHe was sure he meant to scream the word, but it trickled through his lips as nothing more than a breath. A prayer.\nOh god. No.\nTony stumbled through the trees faster than he ever thought he could move. Crashing down to the bank of the lake in seconds. All caution forgotten.\n\"PETER!\"\nThe kid didn't move.\nTony sprinted along the embankment, his feet splashing wildly through the icy water. No. No.\nNo.\n\"Peter...\" The word ripped through his throat. Echoing through the trees. Tony slid to his knees. Rocks that littered the lake's floor cut into them painfully. Tony barely noticed. Instead he yanked the still body towards him, rolling the boy onto his back and cradling him to his chest.\n\"Peter\u2026?\" Tony breathed.\nThe boy didn\u2019t respond. Didn\u2019t move.\nDidn\u2019t take a breath.\n\u201cNo-\u201d The word tore out of Tony\u2019s throat again. He leant down, pressing his fingers desperately against the kid\u2019s neck and letting his ear hover above Peter\u2019s lips. Praying that the breaths were just too fine for him to hear.\nThey weren\u2019t.\nAbsolute stillness met his fingertips as well. No matter how hard he pressed his fingers against the kid\u2019s neck, he couldn\u2019t find a pulse.\nGod. No. No.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony called, hysteria seeping in, pulling the boy closer. \u201cPeter? Please\u2026no. D-don\u2019t do this-please-Peter!?\u201d Tony ran a shaking hand over the kid\u2019s head \u2013 smoothing away the sopping hair. \u201cNo, p-please-no. No.\u201d\nThe trees around him and Peter erupted suddenly with light. A moment later the roar of another explosion hit Tony\u2019s ears \u2013 so loud that it had him bending down over Peter, tucking the boy further into his chest, and clenching his teeth to keep himself from crying out. The sound echoed through his head for several seconds, ringing in his ears and drowning everything else out.\nIt woke up the part of his brain that had short-circuited when he\u2019d first caught sight of Peter in the lake.\nWhat was he doing? God \u2013 why was he wasting so much time?\nLooking down at Peter he latched onto the slight warmth that he could still feel coming off the kid\u2019s skin, and the small hint of pink still in the his otherwise pale lips.\nTony was out of the water, with the kid cradled in his arms, in seconds. He pushed back up onto the bank of the lake and crashed back down to his knees, releasing Peter onto a dry patch of dirt. Without wasting another second Tony pulled up higher on his knees, tilted the kid\u2019s head back, threaded his hands together over that sopping I survived my trip to New York t-shirt and began pumping down over Peter\u2019s sternum. The kid\u2019s chest caved downward with each rough compression, but he remained otherwise motionless.\nThirty compressions. Two breaths.\nTony knew this. Knew the science behind it. Keep the blood pumping, and oxygenized, and you keep the brain alive. Keep the heart from decaying. Spur motion back into the lungs.\nBut, god\u2026this was Peter.\n\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d Tony panted, shoving the heels of his palms continually into the kid\u2019s sternum. Hard. Tony could feel ribs giving way beneath his hands, but he didn\u2019t dare let up the pressure. This had to work. It had too.\nHope had blossomed in Tony\u2019s chest when his brain had finally kicked in, and he\u2019d noted Peter\u2019s dwindling warmth. Warmth meant life. It meant that the kid hadn\u2019t been without a pulse for very long.\nMeant that this was something Tony could fix. Had to fix.\n\u201cCome on, kid, please-\u201d Tony breathed, reaching the end of his first set of compressions. He leant over the Peter\u2019s head, grasped onto his lax jaw and sealed his lips over the kid\u2019s. Pushing a breath of air into Peter\u2019s unmoving lungs. Looking down, Tony watched Peter\u2019s chest rise and fall with the forced breath, and then still.\nHe leant down and forced another breath down into the kid\u2019s lungs. Again Peter\u2019s chest rose and fell, and then stilled.\n\u201cDammit kid, don\u2019t do this-\u201d Tony barked, rising back up and folding his hands over Peter\u2019s chest again. He started on another round of compressions \u2013 rougher this time. Desperate. This had to work. It had to.\nThere was no alternative for Tony.\nHe cast his first real look over the kid\u2019s body. He had a small cut on his forehead, which was slowly oozing blood as Tony continued to pump the kid\u2019s chest, and a few burns scattered across his arms and bare feat \u2013 but other than that he looked all in one piece. On the outside at least.\nGod, Tony hoped there was no damage inside that he was currently making worse.\nHe finished up his round of compressions, and then leant back down over Peter\u2019s face and blew two breaths down into the kid\u2019s lungs. Pulling back slightly Tony pressed his fingers back against the pulse point at Peter\u2019s neck, and moved his ear to hover over the kid\u2019s lips.\nNothing.\nSomething very close to dread seeped down Tony\u2019s spine, but he refused to let it take root there. No.\nNo.\nDread meant he was failing. And he couldn\u2019t fail.\n\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d Tony hissed through his teeth, pulling back up and folding his hands back over Peter\u2019s sternum. He pushed down rhythmically. \u201cBreathe dammit!\u201d He ordered with no small amount of force.\nGod Tony was tired \u2013 his arms were aching with fatigue \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t stop. Not ever if it meant this would work.\nTony fought through another cycle \u2013 barely pausing to catch a breath before leaning down and forcing it into Peter\u2019s still chest.\nHe pulled away and lifted his trembling fingers to feel for a pulse. Nothing.\n\u201cNo. No. D-don\u2019t do this-\u201d Tony pleaded, everything in the world fading away except his absolute need for the kid to breathe. He threaded his hands together over Peter\u2019s chest and resumed compressions. Pounding down on the kid\u2019s chest with every last piece of strength he had. \u201cCome back,\u201d Tony panted. His helplessness morphing into rage, as the boy continued to lay, un-responsive, beneath his desperate hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve never given up on anything in your life, so fight dammit.\u201d\nDroplets of water dripped from Peter\u2019s sodden hair and trailed along his pale checks \u2013 spurred loose as his body shook with Tony\u2019s frantic compressions.\nThat small tint of pink in the kid\u2019s lips, which had ignited so much hope in Tony, was gone now. A hauntingly blue tinge had taken its place.\nNo. No. No. No. NO.\nThe word rung through Tony\u2019s head in time with his every shove as he continued to pump the otherwise motionless chest. This wasn\u2019t happening. It couldn\u2019t \u2013 he couldn\u2019t \u2013 no.\n\u201cNo.\u201d The word slipped through Tony\u2019s clenched lips. He leaned over again and forced two breaths down into the kid\u2019s lungs \u2013 watching as his chest rose and fell with each \u2013 before pulling himself back up and settling over the his chest again, pumping down over the sternum with everything he had. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t have him.\u201d\nTony wasn\u2019t sure whom he was talking to. God? The universe? The soldiers that had done this? It didn\u2019t really matter. They could all go to hell \u2013 because Peter was staying right here. With him. Tony was going to make sure of it.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have him.\u201d Tony heaved, his head tilting forward in exhaustion, and pain, but his hands never wavering as they pressed down again and again on the small chest beneath him. It wasn\u2019t working. It wasn\u2019t \u2013  \u201cAnything \u2013 anything \u2013 else. You can have anything else, just give him back,\u201d Tony pleaded, pausing to blow two quick breaths into the kid\u2019s lungs, before pulling himself back up to continue pumping the still chest. \u201c-Just give him back \u2013 give him back to me-\u201d\nA faint whirring sound was the only warning Tony got before something slammed into the embankment only a few feet in front of Peter and him. Tony pulled away \u2013 ready to cover Peter \u2013 when the achingly familiar silver, metal suit finally swam into focus and Rhodey stepped out.\nDressed in nothing but bright red boxers, his leg-braces and the watch that Tony had gifted him the Christmas before last \u2013 which allowed him to remotely call the suit \u2013 he looked absolutely ridiculous stepping out of the multimillion dollar war suit. Any other day Tony would have laughed, and commented wildly on every brilliant part of the picture in front of him.\nNot today.\nNot with the still unmoving boy beneath his hands.\nRhodey\u2019s eyes roomed over Tony, and then down to Peter beneath him. They froze there.\n\u201cHelp me-\u201d\nRhodey didn\u2019t need to be told twice.\nHe was at Peter\u2019s other side in seconds, pressing his fingertips against the kid\u2019s neck and peeling back one of his eyelids to check his pupils as Tony continued his set of compressions.\n\u201cHow long has he been down?\u201d Rhodey asked. His shoulders were tense as he leant down over Peter\u2019s head and ran his fingers probingly along his scalp \u2013 where the small laceration was still bleeding.\n\u201cA few minutes now.\u201d Tony ground out, breathing heavily with every shove on the kid\u2019s sternum. \u201cI found him in the lake.\u201d\n\u201cThe head wound doesn\u2019t look serious.\u201d Rhodey murmured, pulling up to watch Tony work through the last few compressions in his cycle. \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Tony breathed. \u201cHe fell. I know he fell, but I \u2013 I don\u2019t know what-\u201d\nTony broke off and leant over Peter\u2019s head, tilting it back and blowing two breaths down into his chest. He pulled back up \u2013 ready to fight through another round of compressions \u2013 but Rhodey beat him to it.\nUp on his knees, with his hands clasped together, he pumped the kid\u2019s chest rhythmically \u2013 his compressions far stronger and steadier than Tony\u2019s.\nLeaving Tony with\u2026nothing. Nothing to do but watch as Peter quaked beneath every shove of Rhodey\u2019s strong hands. Watch as the droplets continued to trail along his pale cheeks. Too pale.\nOh god. They were failing \u2013 Tony had failed. He still wasn\u2019t \u2013 he wasn\u2019t \u2013\n\u201cTony, breath!\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice cut through Tony\u2019s panic. Tony blinked up at his friend, who was still compressing Peter\u2019s chest even as he stared across at Tony, clearly panicked. \u201cI need you to stay with me, okay? You need to breathe so you can breathe for him.\u201d Rhodey stressed, nodding down at Peter. Tony nodded jerkily. Rhodey hands paused after another moment \u2013 and it was the only cue Tony needed before he leant down and forced two more breaths into the kid\u2019s lungs.\nRhodey resumed compressions as soon as Tony pulled away.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go into shock yet, alright?\u201d Rhodey ordered, his eyes locking onto Tony\u2019s. \u201cI know this is hard, but you need to-\u201d\n\u201c-Shock.\u201d\nRhodey stared at Tony as if he\u2019d lost his mind \u2013 which to be fair in the last few minutes he probably had.\n\u201cTony \u2013 what?\u201d\n\u201cShock.\u201d\nTony was on his feet and stumbling towards the stationary War Machine suit before his barely function brain fully caught up with him. Shock.\nDefibrillator.\nTony dug his fingertips into the still-open breastplate of the suit and tore into the inside lining. His hands screamed in pain at the abuse \u2013 blood spilling from gashes where the suits metal edges cut deep into the flesh \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have time to be gentle.\nPeter didn\u2019t have time for him to be gentle.\nTony had installed a defibrillator into Rhodey\u2019s suit years ago now. It was fastened to the inside breastplate, which remained pressed tight against his friend\u2019s chest whenever he was in the suit and could therefore be utilized if something were to happen and Rhodey was still inside. It ran on its own power-source and was programed to activate if Rhodey\u2019s heart rate ever dropped or spiked to a certain point. He\u2019d added it as an afterthought. Something that made him feel a little better about Rhodey being out there alone \u2013 but something he\u2019d hoped to god that his friend would never have need to use.\nTony had never been more thankful for his crippling anxiety than in that moment \u2013 because his all-consuming fear of loosing Rhodey a few years back might actually help him save Peter today.\n\u201cTony!?\u201d\nTony finally pulled the last piece of the makeshift defibrillator free and lunged back towards Rhodey and Peter.\n\u201cGet his shirt off.\u201d Tony ordered, his voice firm and his hands steady as he set about connecting the de-fib pads that he\u2019d ripped free of the breastplate back to the small, isolated power source that he\u2019d stored lower down in the armor.\nRhodey didn\u2019t hesitate. Pulling his hands away from where they were pumping Peter\u2019s chest he seized handfuls of the kid\u2019s shirt and pulled. The cheap fabric ripped down the middle, and he shoved it away roughly.\nTony leant down and smoothed the de-fib pads over Peter\u2019s bare chest \u2013 one high on the right side, just near his heart, and the other on his lower left\u2013 and then dove back to the small reactor battery that was charging them.\n\u201cMove back.\u201d Tony barked, and Rhodey pulled away from the boy between them.\nTony connected the last lead to the small, reactor battery \u2013 just for a second \u2013 and Peter\u2019s body jolted.\nAnd then fell back to the ground. Motionless.\nNo. No, this had to work.\nRhodey was back up on his knees and pressing down the kid\u2019s chest before he\u2019d even fallen still. When he paused at the end of his set Tony abandoned the battery in his hands for the moment and leant over to blow two breaths down into Peter\u2019s lungs.\nThey continued their cycle \u2013 Rhodey grounding out thirty strong compressions and Tony delivering two quick breaths \u2013 as Tony kept a hand rested against Peter\u2019s throat. Feeling for any kind of flutter beneath his fingers. After a couple more rounds he felt it \u2013 a pulse fighting to thrum in time with Rhodey\u2019s hands.\n\u201cStop.\u201d Tony breathed, snatching up the battery that he\u2019d abandoned on the dirt beside him. Rhodey pulled his hands away.\nTony connected the last lead from the de-fib pads to the battery and Peter\u2019s body jerked violently again.\nRhodey moved forwards to clasp his hands over the kid\u2019s sternum again, but before he could Peter\u2019s chest suddenly heaved as he gaged, and then sucked in a small breath.\n\u201cPETER!?\u201d\nTony was leaning over him in an instant, tugging the boy onto his side as he gaged. Rhodey slid a hand under his head, lifting it slightly to ease the pressure the odd angle put on the kid\u2019s neck, as Tony pounded an open palm into his back.\nA lungful of water trickled steadily from the kid\u2019s lips as he coughed brutally.\nEventually the gaging stopped and Peter was able to suck in another labored breath. Tony inched closer, rubbing a hand firmly against the kid\u2019s back to help clear his lungs, and smoothing the Peter\u2019s mop of hair back with the other.\nWhat he found beneath made his chest clamp.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes were open \u2013 half-lidded and very clearly out of it \u2013 but somewhat aware. They flittered upwards towards Tony and stayed there.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Tony breathed, resting a gentle hand on the kid\u2019s forehead as Rhodey pulled away and rushed back to the suit \u2013 calling for help.\nPeter\u2019s eyes blinked slowly but didn\u2019t look away. His breaths were coming in short pants, but it was something.\nIt was life. And Tony could work with life.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Tony murmured, thick tears openly sliding down his cheeks and falling onto Peter\u2019s forehead \u2013 mixing with the last few droplets of water from the river.\nThe knot that had formed in Tony chest the moment he saw Peter face down in the lake finally started to loosen \u2013 and when it did the rest of the world came back into sharper focus.\nThe forest around them was still cracking with small fires, and in the distance he could hear the sound of the Hulk tearing through what he was sure used to be the foundations of his compound.\n\u201cYour team is safe.\u201d Rhodey said, moving back towards Peter and Tony. He settled on Peter\u2019s other side again \u2013 resting a hand on the kid\u2019s side as if he, too, needed the physical confirmation that the he was breathing. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to get through on the radio. The intruders are gone \u2013 pulled back as soon as the Hulk made his appearance. The team managed to salvage some comms. from the soldiers and were spread out in the woods looking for the two of you.\u201d Rhodey nodded at Tony and Peter. \u201cThey should be here in a few minutes.\u201d\nTony nodded, but he was only half listening. He\u2019d tuned out as soon as Rhodey had told him the others were safe. That was all he cared about \u2013 everything else in that moment, with Peter alive and cradled against his chest, was inconsequential.\nThe whole damn world could have been on fire and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered \u2013 because Tony\u2019s no longer was. Everything that really mattered was here, and whole, and breathing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter woke to a quiet beeping and the startling realization that he didn\u2019t know where he was. This bed was far too soft to be his lumpy mattress, and the semi-lit room was almost silent, which his never was. Crappy insulation and shitty neighbors meant that Peter\u2019s room was almost always buzzing with some kind of noise \u2013 be it from the street below or the neighbors going at it \u2013 but all he could hear now was soft snores ruffling the air beside his bed.\nHe forced his eyes open through sheer stubbornness. They ached something shocking, just like the rest of him, but he had to get them open.\nSomething had happened. Something important.\nDim light seared through his skull when his eyelids finally flickered upwards. Wherever he was, it was dark, but not pitch black. A small \u2013 and expensive looking \u2013 lamp sat alight on the beside-table and it illuminated just enough of the room to settle Peter\u2019s panic.\nNamely, it illuminated Tony.\nPeter turned his head slowly \u2013 pain shooting through his skull and chest as he did \u2013 to look at the older man.\nHe was sprawled on a plush looking armchair, one arm folded under his chin as he slept and the other resting on the bed beside one of Peter\u2019s. Next to him hospital equipment was set up \u2013 all leads and monitors running down to Peter\u2019s arms and chest \u2013 but despite that the room didn\u2019t look like it belonged to a hospital.\nIt was far too nice for that. There was a leather sofa on the other side of the room that Peter was willing to bet cost more than everything in his room, and \u2013 no matter what time it was \u2013 no hospital was ever this quiet.\nNot to mention the bed.\nSo. Soft.\nSo delectably soft.\nNope. Peter had absolutely no idea where he was \u2013 or what had happened that landed him here. But he found, after a couple of moment of watching Tony drool onto a suit that definitely cost more than May\u2019s entire apartment, that he really didn\u2019t care.\nSleep was calling him again. He could feel it at the edge of his already waning consciousness.\nWhatever had happened, and wherever he was now, it could wait.\nTony was right there \u2013 so Peter knew he was going to be just fine."
