    "text": "Foggy isn\u2019t paying attention when Karen tells Matt about it.\nFoggy isn\u2019t really paying attention to anything that isn\u2019t his intense game of Candy Crush, and he\u2019s swearing wholeheartedly at the screen when he walks into the next room to find Karen looking mortified and Matt looking confused and both of them staring right at him.\n\u201cMotherfucking candy fuckers can\u2019t even get it right, I pushed the button! Guys, we have to file a lawsuit against whatever evil masterminds make these shoddy cellphone keys that don\u2019t-\u201d He stops as he looks up and sees his friends\u2019 expressions, pausing the game as an afterthought.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d I miss? Did something happen? If New York is getting rained on by freaky-headed aliens again I swear to god-\u201d\nKaren has her hands over her mouth, her eyes wide and apologetic as she blurts, \u201cFoggy, I am so sorry, I thought he knew!\u201d\nFoggy has his mouth open to ask what the hell are you talking about when Matt says, \u201cWhen were you in love with me,\u201d bewildered and surprised and all kinds of confused.\nAt first Foggy thinks this is just a weird dream and pinches himself to prove it. Then he says, \u201cOw,\u201d kind of absently, and shakes the hand he just pinched.\nThey continue to stare at him like he\u2019s a bomb about to go off, and Foggy clears his throat. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d he manages. His voice doesn\u2019t shake, he\u2019s proud of that, he expected that if this ever came into light then his voice would start breaking like he was fifteen all over again.\nHe meets Karen\u2019s eyes, who squeaks and starts apologizing again. \u201cI just, we were talking and I mentioned it and Matt got all confused and then I got all confused because I thought he knew you didn\u2019t tell me not to tell him I really did think he knew I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she says in a rush, muffled by her hands.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Foggy says faintly. Even though he knows it wouldn\u2019t matter, he can\u2019t bring himself to meet Matt\u2019s eyes. \u201cOkay. I. Am going to go- somewhere. Out the door. And onto the street! And then, I\u2019m gonna, well, who even knows, Hell\u2019s Kitchen is a plethora of, of places to go and things to see. You guys know I\u2019ve never been to that place that ties your ankle and then throws you around in the air, always wanted to do that, I\u2019m gonna go do that-\u201d\nHe\u2019s halfway to the door when Matt stops him with a hand on his arm. \u201cFoggy.\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Foggy says, shrugging him off. \u201cNope-\u201d\n\u201cFoggy-\u201d Matt moves in front of him, blocks the doorway every time Foggy makes a desperate attempt to get past him. It\u2019s futile, he knows, he\u2019s heard everything the man in the black mask- Daredevil, now, in the red suit- has done, and Foggy doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\u201cI swear to god, I will get to the street via jumping out that window if you don\u2019t let me through right now, Murdock,\u201d Foggy says, a laugh in his voice that wasn\u2019t there before.\n\u201cI\u2019d stop you,\u201d Matt says. He puts a hand on Foggy\u2019s shoulder, drops it when Foggy winces. \u201cI- Foggy, this isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\nThe laugh bursts out of him. \u201cYeah! Yeah, right.\u201d He tries to make another break past him but Matt blocks him easily, giving Foggy a look that clearly says really?\nFoggy waves towards the door, towards sweet, sweet freedom only three feet away. \u201cCome on!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re freaking out.\u201d\n\u201cI am not!\u201d\n\u201cYou are. Foggy, you need to calm down, this isn\u2019t a big deal, it was in college, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re still in love with me.\u201d\nAs soon as Foggy says, \u201cUh-huh,\u201d he knows he\u2019s fucked. His voice cracks in the middle of it so even without Matt\u2019s freaky heartbeat-lie-detector skills he\u2019d be able to tell Foggy is a dirty liar.\nFoggy wishes for another alien invasion as Matt\u2019s eyes grow wide behind his glasses.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Matt says.\nIt\u2019s telling how surprised he is that he lets Foggy go through the door this time. Foggy tries not to let that get to him.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nKaren calls him until he picks up.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Foggy,\u201d she says, so fast Foggy has to work to sort the words out. \u201cYou just, back at the bar, you said it so casually and you guys are so open about everything else-\u201d\nFoggy laughs at that, remembering Matt bloody and maskless on the couch as Foggy stared down at him.\n\u201c-so I assumed he\u2019d already know,\u201d she finishes. \u201cI am so, so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Foggy says. He pauses. \u201cWell, no, it\u2019s not fine, it\u2019s probably the least fine thing to happen in the history of the entire world and every alternate universe, but I won\u2019t hold you to it. After I finish sulking. During which I will resent you to the point of burning. Like, hellfire levels of burning, here. But then I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful secretary, y\u2019know that, Karen? Should put your name on the door next to ours.\u201d\n\u201cFoggy, where are you?\u201d\nFoggy lets his head rest on the bar, then regrets it. There are substances sticking to it that he doesn\u2019t want to identify. He lifts his head, starts scrubbing at the place that touched the bar. \u201cI\u2019m on the road to being thoroughly inebriated. That, Karen, is where I am.\u201d\n\u201cI could come and get you? We don\u2019t have to tell Matt.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, he\u2019s probably all concerned, doing that concerned frown at you right now. You know the one, with the little dent in between his eyebrows. Fuck that dent. I love that damn dent, he looks like a woodchuck.\u201d\nFoggy doesn\u2019t even know what he means by that, but he means it hard.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted to let you cool down, but about an hour ago he left to look for you.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Foggy says, and hangs up. He doesn\u2019t know, exactly, how Daredevil finds people, but he knows he\u2019s good at it.\nHe\u2019s speedwalking through an alley when Matt jumps at him from above and lands a foot in front of him, making Foggy yelp and scramble backwards.\n\u201cWhat the HELL,\u201d Foggy barks. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go- backflipping off of roofs without your Daredevil getup, people will put two and two together-\u201d\n\u201cFoggy. Buddy,\u201d Matt tries, but Foggy blocks his ears and starts walking in circles around the alley, singing as loud as he can.\nMatt watches this for a while, that stupid worried frown on his face, and when Foggy steps on a slippery piece of cardboard and nearly topples over because of it, Matty grabs him and steadies him.\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Foggy sighs, brushing Matty\u2019s hand off. He groans when Matty gets that look, that kicked puppy concerned look. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do face things at me. You know I can\u2019t handle the face things, Murdock.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Matt says. \u201cFoggy, you gotta- go home. Sober up. Everything will be better in the morning.\u201d\nFoggy turns his gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019m glaring at you.\u201d\n\u201cI assumed, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cHey, can you see me glaring at you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I told you. Just shapes, where things are.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t tell what face I\u2019m making.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nFoggy pulls the silliest face he can accomplish. \u201cYou can\u2019t see this?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing out. I got detention for a week for making this face at my seventh grade maths teacher,\u201d Foggy tells him, and leans against the side of the alley, trying not to think about how many germs he\u2019s probably picking up by doing it. God help him, he loves this city, but sometimes he feels like he should go around in a big plastic bubble so he doesn\u2019t catch hepatitis. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t know, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Foggy sighs. He tips his head up, pushes it against the alley wall. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so, up until you told me about the whole vigilante thing and how you can kind of not really see and also tell when people are lying because of the heartbeat thing. Thought you knew, after that. After all, I can\u2019t lie to you, right, buddy?\u201d\nHe says the last bit of it with the last dregs of resentment he\u2019s still clinging to, and Matt flinches, this small thing that makes victory roar in Foggy\u2019s chest before it gets replaced by guilt.\n\u201cI knew- that you were attracted to me,\u201d Matt admits. \u201cBut a lot of people are attracted to me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, god, you poor soul.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d Matt hunches. Foggy hasn\u2019t seen him look this uncomfortable in years. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you thought you couldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\nFoggy spreads his arms. \u201cWell, look where it got us! You\u2019re letting me down all awkwardly and then we\u2019re gonna go and be awkward forever, because no matter how much we don\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s always gonna come up sometime.\u201d\n\u201cWe can move past this, Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cYeahhhh, I don\u2019t think so, buddy,\u201d Foggy says. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019ve been trying to get over you since I met you, and it hasn\u2019t worked so far. See, this is why I didn\u2019t want you to know- you\u2019re going to get all guilty about not feeling the same way, and you\u2019re gonna apologize all the time, which will only make things worse. And we\u2019ll say we\u2019re gonna pretend like nothing ever happened, but you\u2019re all with the guilt, man! You\u2019re like a guilt machine, you churn it out like- like a churning thing, butter or whatever. So you\u2019re gonna feel bad about it and it\u2019s gonna eat you up inside until finally you say you can\u2019t do this to me anymore and then we\u2019re gonna go our separate ways all because I can\u2019t get over my big gay crush on you!\u201d\nHe yells the last bit, nods to a few people walking past who look at him funny. Then he looks at Matt, who is all big, miserable kitten eyes and hunched shoulders.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that doesn\u2019t sound like something you\u2019d do,\u201d Foggy says when Matt opens his mouth. \u201cThe guilt thing. Don\u2019t say it\u2019s not going to suck every time you remember about it and know you can\u2019t feel the same way and feel oh-sooooo-bad about poor Foggy, pining away over you.\u201d\nMatt swallows. \u201cFoggy,\u201d he says, and then stops. \u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t feel the same way, not like that, but I still- I still love you. As a friend. And I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Foggy mutters, his throat closing up. He waits until it lessens, says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you either. Which was why I wasn\u2019t going to tell you.\u201d\nMatt sets his jaw. \u201cThings can still say the same.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, until you get all Catholic on me and say you can\u2019t put me through it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI- might,\u201d Matt admits.\nFoggy sighs, elongating it out until it turns into a yell. \u201cOkay. Fine, let\u2019s just do this. Let\u2019s pretend nothing ever happened. See how long that lasts.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Matt says.\nFoggy sighs again. \u201cJesus. You look like you just realized you have to strangle everyone you ever loved to save Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Hey, that might happen. Weird shit happens with you superheroes. Come on, help me back to my place and feed me water like you always do.\u201d\nHe slings an arm over Matt\u2019s shoulder, is grateful when Matt doesn\u2019t stiffen. But then again, Matt kind of can\u2019t get any more rigid than he is right now, and Foggy shakes him, just a little. \u201cNothing happened, remember? This isn\u2019t going to work if you don\u2019t roll with it.\u201d\nMatt nods, lips pinching. \u201cFoggy.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my fellow heterosexual?\u201d\nThat gets him a small smile, one that vanishes as soon as it appears. \u201cIf- if I could love you like that, I would. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t.\u201d\nFoggy lets his gaze linger on his best friend\u2019s face, the miserable set of his frown, his eyebrows, the downturn of his mouth. Then he looks away, claps him on the shoulder. \u201cYeah, I know you are, buddy. But hey, can\u2019t help what gender you\u2019re attracted to.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Matt says. Then he goes all stiff and silent again, and Foggy has to keep up a running commentary all the way home.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nThings, predictably, are awkward for the next few days. Karen dances around the two of them until Foggy yells at her about it, shocking all three of them and causing Foggy to buy Karen some apology cupcakes from the place downstairs.\nFoggy and Matt are more or less normal after Matt stops looking like he wants to apologize for being straight every time Foggy walks into the room. They still touch the same amount as usual, the occasional back-pat and the absent hand on each other when they want to get each others attention. Foggy still finds himself leading Matt places, a habit he can\u2019t seem to shake even after he found out Matt could navigate fine without the cane and could also beat up a dozen guys on his own with no weapons.\nThey still have the same old conversations, jokes, arguments, but sometimes there\u2019s this air that Foggy can\u2019t shake, like when a woman flirts with Matt and Matt hesitates with the knowledge of Foggy beside him before responding.\n\u201cI could stop, if you want,\u201d Matt tells him once, and Foggy sighs.\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna stop you flirting with hot chicks, man.\u201d\n\u201cBut it- doesn\u2019t it-\u201d\n\u201cHurt? Well, yeah, but most of it\u2019s \u2018cause of the tragedy that is you somehow pulling all these beautiful women and not having the sight to appreciate it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Matt says, and Foggy\u2019s getting better at this, at lying without actually lying.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nFoggy meets Claire about three months after The Thing is revealed when he gets a call from an unknown number.\n\u201cHello, this is Foggy Nelson.\u201d\n\u201cMatt needs someone to take care of him and I have work in 45 minutes.\u201d\nFoggy pauses. \u201cMay I ask who this is?\u201d\nA sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s Claire, Matt said he told you about me?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cRight, the nurse.\u201d\n\u201cThe nurse,\u201d Claire confirms. \u201cCan you pick him up or not, I really have to go soon. I\u2019d leave him to sleep it off, but he\u2019s on painkillers and god knows what he\u2019ll do on them. I don\u2019t want him going out to stop a mugging and falling on his own face because of the pills.\u201d\n\u201cSure, I can come and get him. Hey, how bad is it this time?\u201d\n\u201cNot too bad. Don\u2019t put any weight on his ribs, though. And do me a favour and don\u2019t let him go out and fight crime for a few days so he doesn\u2019t rip his new stitches again.\u201d\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d Foggy sighs. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in ten.\u201d\nShe hangs up without a goodbye, but Foggy doesn\u2019t take it personally. He guesses she has a lot on her mind. His phone lights up a second later with her address.\nShe blinks at him when he shows up at her door with a muffin, and looks down at it when he pushes it into her hands.\n\u201cTo eat on the road,\u201d he tells her, and her mouth quirks up. \u201cI have an aunt who\u2019s a nurse, she was always complaining she never had time to eat.\u201d\n\u201cTell your aunt to keep granola bars in her scrub pockets and eat while she walks,\u201d Claire tells him. She opens the door further to let him in.\nFoggy walks in to see Matt on the couch, asleep, shirtless and bandaged in multiple places. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s making a face until Claire says, \u201cHe can take worse, believe me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cI\u2019m not used to seeing him- all beat up like this. But hey, I suppose he\u2019s beat up all the time, just covers it with his clothes.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t sit well with him, the new knowledge that his best friend is most likely in pain all the time due to constantly going out and getting hit, or stabbed, and a further colourful of array of hurt.\n\u201cI actually got him to take some painkillers this time,\u201d Claire says where she\u2019s shrugging into her jacket. As she ties up her hair with elastic, she says, \u201cHe might be a little loopy on the way home. Get him in bed and he should be up and being stubborn again in six hours. Good luck getting him to take more painkillers.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very surprised he took these ones,\u201d Foggy says. He walks over, crouches down to Matt and flicks him in the forehead.\nMatt groans, rolls his head sluggishly towards Foggy. His face lights up when he sees- or, notices him, grinning in a way that makes Foggy\u2019s stomach clench up.\n\u201cFoggy,\u201d he murmurs, and then reaches out to fondle Foggy\u2019s ear and pat him in the cheek way too hard.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Foggy says, standing up and trying to get him into a sitting position. \u201cC\u2019mon, buddy, we\u2019re gonna do that walking thing. Can you do the walking thing?\u201d\nMatt groans again as he stumbles to his feet, leaning on Foggy for support. \u201cWhere\u2019s- where- Foggy?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re at Claire\u2019s,\u201d Foggy tells him. \u201cBut she has to go to work and you\u2019re eight kinds of loopy right now, so I\u2019m taking you back to my place so I can make sure you don\u2019t fall out a window.\u201d\nMatt blinks up at him, and then his lips spread in that drugged-up smile again. \u201cFoggy,\u201d he says, and then sways forwards to rub his head against Foggy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAlways takin\u2019 care of me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you need it, what with the crazy crime fighting skills,\u201d Foggy points out. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\u201cMrgh,\u201d Matt says, and follows Foggy to the car with the help of Foggy\u2019s hand on his arm.\nMatt leans his head on Foggy\u2019s shoulder the whole way home, and then tries to do it the whole way up to Matt\u2019s apartment, but his head slips off a few times. Foggy may or may not take pictures and snapchat them to Claire, warning her via captions not to get the wrong idea.\n\u201cDo you want me to tuck you in,\u201d Foggy asks when Matty gets into his bed, and Matty shakes his head, shoves a hand through his hair so it sticks up.\n\u201cNuh,\u201d he says. He keeps making movements with his face, weird ones that Foggy thinks are so he can hear better. \u201cHey, Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, buddy?\u201d\nMatt sighs, lolls his head to look at him. \u201c\u2019M real sorry I can\u2019t love you like you love me.\u201d\nFoggy\u2019s throat clicks and he wonders if Matty can hear that when he\u2019s this whacked out on painkillers. \u201cI told you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019S not,\u201d Matt insists, and before Foggy can stop him, Matt\u2019s using his strength and weird fighting skills to grab Foggy\u2019s arm and somehow use his legs to get Foggy so he\u2019s lying next to Matt on the bed.\nFoggy draws in a thin breath when Matt gets up on his elbows and leans over Foggy, blinking down at him. \u201c\u2019S not okay,\u201d Matt repeats. \u201cYou\u2019re sad, I\u2019ve been making you sad. I never want to make you sad, you deserve to be happy. Y\u2019 deserve to be happy, Foggy.\u201d\n\u201cI am happy,\u201d Foggy says loudly to distract himself from the fact that Matt is leaning over him, close enough to kiss. \u201cStop with the guilting!\u201d\n\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt says, sounding sad and distant as his hand lifts to touch Foggy\u2019s face. They did this once before, in college, Matt running his hands over Foggy\u2019s face to get a feel for his features. It was the start of this whole thing, for Foggy, the whole being in love with Matt thing, and Foggy has lost count of how many times he\u2019s jerked off to the memory of Matt\u2019s hands on his skin, feeling his way across Foggy\u2019s face.\nFoggy draws a thin breath in and then he\u2019s pushing Matt\u2019s hand away, getting up off the bed and telling Matt he should sleep.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be watching the door,\u201d he warns him. \u201cSo don\u2019t try any ninja crap.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019S not ninjaing,\u201d Matt protests as the door closes.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nSometimes Foggy wishes for the simplicity of their college friendship- the drunken nights on the town, the wistful plans for the future, sharing cheap noodles and personal space and occasionally beds, staying up studying and then crashing the next day.\nTheir friendship has changed, first because of Daredevil and now because of what they\u2019ve taken to calling The Thing, capitalized even though Foggy\u2019s pretty sure neither of them have ever wrote it down.\nKaren\u2019s in on it, the only other one who knows about The Thing. She tries to talk to them about it sometimes- Foggy always refuses to listen, but he thinks she\u2019s been talking about it with Matt when he\u2019s not around.\nIt makes him cringe, thinking about what they might be saying. And he knows it\u2019s about him, because every time it happens, Matt shoots him these looks that Foggy can\u2019t decipher and doesn\u2019t know what to do with. Which is stupid, anyway, since Matt can\u2019t even see Foggy, just a vague Foggy Nelson-ish shape, so there\u2019s really no reason for Matt to be giving him any looks at all.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nFoggy gets kidnapped about seven months after The Thing gets revealed, and he\u2019s more pissed off about it than anything.\n\u201cNot just any bad guys,\u201d Foggy hisses as Matt unties his hands. \u201cIncompetent bad guys. I nearly untied this knot myself just sitting here!\u201d\nHe flexes his hands when the ropes finally fall free. \u201cUgh, thank you. That shit chafed worse than that awful watch-\u201d\nMatt stands up and roundhouse kicks a guy in the face who Foggy hadn\u2019t even seen coming at them.\n\u201c-you got me for graduation, you know the one, it was terrible,\u201d he continues as Matt gets the guy down on the ground. There\u2019s blood coming out of his head, but Foggy can\u2019t see where from exactly. \u201cThat watch stopped me from nearly scoring with so many girls, it was that terrible, gaudy as hell, what was I thinking letting a blind dude pick out a watch for me-\u201d\nMatt takes down what Foggy assumes to be the last of the bad guys, but he thought that three bad guys ago.\n\u201cAre you okay,\u201d Matt asks as he\u2019s untying Foggy\u2019s legs. \u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe they knocked me out in my own house,\u201d Foggy continues. \u201cIt\u2019s so- clich\u00e9, and boring, what, I couldn\u2019t even get a car chase out of my experience as hostage-\u201d\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Matt tells him, and Foggy realizes that he\u2019s hyperventilating. \u201cBreathe with me, Foggy, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here, I got you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Foggy rasps. He gasps in a breath, then another, and Matt takes his hand and presses it to his own chest.\n\u201cBreathe with me.\u201d\nThey stay there like that, surrounded with bloodied thugs, Matt\u2019s hand pressing over Foggy\u2019s, which presses into Matt\u2019s chest as it rises and falls.\nWhen his breathing is more or less back to normal, Foggy tells Matt he\u2019s fine apart from a headache, and Matt leads them out of wherever the hell they are, Foggy doesn\u2019t even know, they put a bag on his head. A bag. Like in the movies.\nMatt doesn\u2019t even change, just gets them back to his place to wipe the blood off of Foggy\u2019s face no matter how much Foggy tells him he\u2019s fine, really, he can apply cotton swabs to his face without incident.\nBut Matt stays, taking his mask off when he\u2019s finished, and then he sits there on his couch, white-knuckling the mask in his hands.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Foggy says. He knocks their shoulders together. \u201cYou know I\u2019m fine, right? Just a few bumps and bruises.\u201d\n\u201cThey took you,\u201d Matt says, with such intensity that it makes Foggy startle a little bit. \u201cThey took you-\u201d\n\u201cMy fault for getting involved,\u201d Foggy tries. \u201cEveryone was all, Foggy, don\u2019t talk to the Emmerson witness, they\u2019ll put a hit on you, but did I listen? Noooo-\u201d\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have ever fucking touched you,\u201d Matt grits out, shaking now, tiny tremors working their way through his frame. \u201cThe one thing- the one thing I promised myself when I put on the mask the first time was that I\u2019d never let them get to you. And I can\u2019t even save you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did save me!\u201d Foggy squeezes Matt\u2019s shoulders, tries to get him to look at him before realizing for the millionth time, oh, right, blind. He wonders sometimes if he\u2019s ever going to stop having that realization. \u201cFoggy Nelson, safe and sound! All thanks to our friendly neighbourhood Daredev-\u201d\nThe last part gets cut off by Matt\u2019s open mouth on his.\nIt\u2019s not long, just a few seconds, but Foggy\u2019s brain blanks out entirely. There\u2019s a cut on Foggy\u2019s lip that he hadn\u2019t noticed until just now, and it makes their kiss taste like copper as their mouths move against each other.\nMatt\u2019s hands come up to frame Foggy\u2019s face, hands still shaking, fingers pressing almost too hard.\nThe door opens as their tongues meet, and they jerk apart as Karen storms in, saying, \u201cFoggy, thank god you\u2019re okay, this woman named Claire called and told me-\u201d\nShe trails off, handbag dropping unnoticed to the floor when she takes in the cut-off kiss and Matt\u2019s costume, the mask in his lap where he dropped it to kiss Foggy.\n\u201cI,\u201d Karen says. She wavers on the spot. \u201cWhat- you-\u201d\n\u201cClose the door, please,\u201d Matt says, strained.\nKaren does, and then comes to sit on the floor as Matt explains the whole Daredevil thing. Foggy offers to go and make tea during this, and spends the next ten minutes sitting on the floor with his head in his hands.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nFoggy goes home, calls in sick to work for three days and then turns up like nothing happened, because that\u2019s what they do, pretend like everything\u2019s normal and Foggy isn\u2019t desperately in love with his straight best friend. This is what they do.\nBoth Karen and Matt look worried, but Foggy wisely ignores it and goes into his office to start in on the paperwork he\u2019s missed out on.\nKaren and Matt make attempts to talk to him, but Foggy says he\u2019s really very busy and can\u2019t talk right now and takes a long lunch break so he can hide in the bathroom and have a panic attack.\nWhich he regrets as soon as he walks out, because Matt\u2019s looking the kind of tense that lets Foggy know that he definitely heard.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Foggy says when Matt opens his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m dealing. I? Am totally dealing, I am the deal master, master of the deals. And dealing with things.\u201d\nMatt snorts. \u201cRight. Because denial works so well.\u201d\n\u201cWorked for us so far,\u201d Foggy says, and imagines the spike in his heartbeat as it happens.\nMatt\u2019s jaw works, his shoulders go tight. \u201cFoggy-\u201d\n\u201cDo you want doughnuts? Because I would kill a man for a good glazed chocolate-\u201d\n\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt talks over him. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t,\u201d Foggy says, and starts to leave, opens his mouth to say he\u2019ll get Matt a doughnut as well, except he doesn\u2019t get to say anything because Matt is kissing him.\nFoggy kisses back for a second, unable to stop himself, unable to pull away from something he\u2019s been wanting for so long he thinks it\u2019s pretty much imprinted on his soul, but then everything rushes back and he shoves Matt away.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snarls, and is mortified to discover that he\u2019s close to tears. He swallows, sucks in a breath, hopes Matt doesn\u2019t hear whatever indicators he\u2019s making about the close to tears thing. \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t you dare, you can\u2019t just-\u201d\n\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt says desperately. \u201cWhat if I could- love you like that?\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Foggy says, rubbing his hands down his face. \u201cJust, do not, okay? I get that you\u2019re sad about making me sad but holy SHIT do not do this, it\u2019s a bad road to go down-\u201d\n\u201cHear me out,\u201d Matt says. \u201cPlease?\u201d\nFoggy sighs. \u201cI\u2019m glaring at you.\u201d\nMatt nods, and then his hands drop to his sides. His mouth opens, and nothing comes out for a second. Foggy waits, arms crossed.\n\u201cI,\u201d Matt says, and then clears his throat. \u201cSince you told me-\u201d\n\u201cKaren told you, I got dragged along in this.\u201d\n\u201cSince I found out,\u201d Matt says. \u201cI\u2019ve been- thinking. About us. Mostly about you. And about how sexuality is fluid, and-\u201d\n\u201cMatt, come on-\u201d\n\u201cKaren gave me some books to read-\u201d\n\u201cThis is so embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201c-which helped me realize I\u2019m demisexual.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cDemisexual,\u201d Matt says. \u201cIt\u2019s-\u201d\n\u201cI know what it is, Matt.\u201d\n\u201cRight, good, but that\u2019s, that isn\u2019t the point, the point is that I never considered the possibility that I could love you like that,\u201d Matt blurts. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think I could. But, but since you told me, I\u2019ve been thinking, and I tried to get myself to feel the same way, and I tried so hard to force it, but then Karen told me something and I realized- Foggy, I think I\u2019m already in love with you. I think I was before I found out you were in love with me-\u201d\n\u201cCrap, yeah, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d Foggy says, and tries to shoulder his way past him to the door, why does he always let Matt stand in front of the door, but Matt gets in the way, grabs his shoulders.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been in love with you for years,\u201d Matt says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize because I didn\u2019t think I could feel like this for a man.\u201d\nFoggy chews furiously on his cheek so he doesn\u2019t start crying. \u201cMatt. I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, but trust me, you are not in love with me. You\u2019re in friend love with me, which is a whole other and completely valid thing, and it\u2019s not your fault that you can\u2019t love me the way I- the way I want you to.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d Foggy pleads. \u201cDon\u2019t- god, do you know how much it\u2019d hurt if I actually believed you and we got together and you broke up with me somewhere along the line because you finally gave in to the fact that you aren\u2019t in love with me? Or, god forbid, you stayed just because you didn\u2019t want to lose me as a friend! You would do that, Matt, don\u2019t say you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nMatt shakes his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou would.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, I respect you too much.\u201d\nFoggy makes a noise of frustration through his teeth. \u201cYOU ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Matt says determinedly. \u201cI\u2019ve put a lot of thought into it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve put a lot of thought into it!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cI trust you with everything, asshole,\u201d Foggy snaps. \u201cBut I also trust the fact that you\u2019d feel so bad about not being able to love me back that you\u2019d- convince yourself you were in love with me, that you have been for years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you I wouldn\u2019t! If it makes you feel better I\u2019ll get a lie detector-\u201d\n\u201cA lie detector, fuck off, you can probably- control your heart rate or some shit to fake it-\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell would I be able to do that?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind and you fight crime, I don\u2019t know what else you can do! Can you fly? Can you set fires with your mind? I just don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cWhat will it take for you to believe me, Foggy?\u201d\nFoggy draws a shaky breath, lets it out even more shakily. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cTell me and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cI said I don\u2019t know, jeez,\u201d Foggy says weakly. He rakes his hands through his hair, sighs loudly. \u201cStop staring at me! What do you even want, Matt?\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Matt says instantly. \u201cYour friendship, and in the last several months I\u2019ve realized I also want a relationship. Why is that so hard for you to believe?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cAlso, you are way out of my league.\u201d\nMatt frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind, what would you know?\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019re kind. I know you\u2019re funny, and loyal, and you try to cheer people up even if you don\u2019t know them or why they\u2019re sad. I know you\u2019re witty, and generous, and selfless, and hardworking, and you\u2019ve stuck by me through everything. I know you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had, and that I love you, and that I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that in time you\u2019ll believe it. And when you do, I\u2019m going to be there waiting for you.\u201d\nFoggy stares, trying to find something, anything to respond with. Finally, he goes with, \u201cWith how our luck\u2019s been recently, it\u2019ll be five seconds before I die dramatically in your arms.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be very poetic, you\u2019d scream my name into the sky and vow revenge-\u201d\n\u201cFoggy,\u201d Matt says with a hint of a smile, and Foggy sighs.\n\u201cI\u2019ll consider your proposal, Mr Murdock.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask, Mr Nelson,\u201d Matt says, and the bastard walks off grinning.\n\u00a0\n-\n\u00a0\nMatt is quietly persistent about it, tossing in \u2018love you\u2019s and getting the occasional kiss in, but Foggy doesn\u2019t believe, not really, until Matt has a run-in with a beam that gives him his sight back for half an hour.\nFoggy is all but vibrating on the spot when Claire tells him this, and also tells him that the first thing Matt did when he found out is head to Foggy\u2019s place.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Foggy croaks. \u201cI\u2019ll just, uh. Wait for that then.\u201d\nHe hangs up and goes to the mirror, stares at his reflection for a while and then combs his hair when he realizes he has no idea how to make himself look better other than brushing his hair. Then he goes back to the lounge, picks up a book and pretends like he isn\u2019t glancing up at the door every ten seconds. When the knock finally comes, Foggy doesn\u2019t even bother with a bookmark since he wasn\u2019t really reading anyway.\nHe unlocks the door, opens it and there\u2019s Matt, whose face utterly transforms when he sees Foggy. He was already smiling when the door opened, but- god. God.\n\u201cHi, Foggy,\u201d Matt breathes, and fuck, Foggy didn\u2019t even know that look existed, that anyone could have that much love poured into one expression.\nShit, Foggy thinks distantly. \u201cYou love me.\u201d\nMatt keeps staring at him, grinning hard. \u201cVery much, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Foggy says. \u201cWell, that\u2019s- okay, then. Do you want to go look at more things or-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d look at you forever if I could,\u201d Matt says, and Foggy swears under his breath before dragging him in to kiss him.\n\u201cYou kept your eyes open during that, didn\u2019t you,\u201d he says when he pulls back.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cFair \u2018nuff,\u201d Foggy says.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Matt tells him, and Foggy rolls his eyes, says, \u201cYeah, yeah, you too, now c\u2019mere.\u201d"
