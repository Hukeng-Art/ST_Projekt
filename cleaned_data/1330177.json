    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's sixteen and in the woods on the wrong side of the town-line and he's so fucking fucked.\nHe knows he's not supposed to run, they teach that to you in preschool (don't run from a Were, back away slowly and walk with care), but they never told you how it would feel, standing in the dark with your heart in your throat as those pale, lit eyes tracked you from the shadows.\nHe's sprinting away like a startled deer even as he sings the old nursery song wildly in his head, keeping beat with the frantic thud of his sneakers in the dirt. He knows as soon as he starts that it was the wrong move, almost as wrong as crossing the town-line, or as wrong as neglecting to tell anyone that he was going to wander into the Hale woods today like a reckless dipshit.\nHe can't stop now though. Once you start running, there's only one thing that stops you.\nHe's only gotten partway through the second verse of the rhyme when it hits him, not a sound to warn him before he's knocked right off his feet, the Were solid and heavy and animal-smelling at his back. He screams in fear, an echo in the dark woods before he feels the sudden sting of teeth.\nHe stares into the silent dark with shocky eyes, a breath caught in his throat as the wolf snaps teeth like sharp needles into the soft, vulnerable spot at the nape of his neck.\nHe sucks in a deep breath and cries out long and mournful into the dirt as the teeth stay clamped there, holding him still, pinned, claimed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey're like that for hours before the search party finds them. By then, he's slipped into a black-out sleep a few times, drained by the adrenaline rushes, only to wake again and rush when he feels the teeth pinched in his neck still.\nIt's hunters that find them first, and the wolf at his back starts growling before Stiles can hear them breaking through the undergrowth; it's a low, terrifying sound and it makes Stiles whimper a little, fingers clawing the dirt and dead leaves around him.\nThere's shouting and beaming flashlights, bouncing along the trees and settling on them. The wolf's growling pitches higher, more threatening, and Stiles starts trembling, cowering at it.\n\"Get it off him! Get it off!\" one of the hunters is yelling and then there are others, moving swiftly and sleekly through the trees, and he knows before the hunters shout that they're Weres.\n\"Oh shit, oh shit,\" someone groans as the Weres appear on the other side of the clearing, too many for Stiles to count.\nRifles cock and the Weres make low noises and then he hears him, his father's voice, coming clear and stern through the upset \"Everyone calm down. Back away from them. Back up.\"\nThere's silence and then a woman's voice \"Derek, love. You need to let him go.\"\nThe wolf at his back starts panting through its nose, sharp, loud breaths like it's freaking out as badly as Stiles is. Stiles tries to be very still as the woman gets closer. \"I'm going to help you, sweetheart. Just let me--\" Stiles sees her bare feet first and it makes him wince, knowing she's a wolf too. But when he winces, the wolf at his back growls again, low and unhappy.\n\"Stiles, stay still, son, relax,\" his father says and Stiles tries to go limp everywhere. He thinks about making his arms pliant, his legs. The wolf on him seems to approve, sighs out once through its nose, the heat of it rifling Stiles' hair.\n\"Ok, love. Your teeth are caught. I'm going to help you,\" the woman says and it's a lot of slow motions and the careful, cold touch of her fingertips where Stiles' nape is all slobbery-wet from the wolf and then, as easy as anything, the teeth are out of him and he's trying to scramble away.\n\"Stiles, don't move. Don't move!\" his father shouts and the wolf snarls but when Stiles flips over on his back, heart racing, he sees the woman wrestling the snapping wolf away from him and then the wolf changing, a vibration of color and fur that settles into the rangy figure of Derek Hale. Derek Hale, the eldest son of the Alpha, whose face is all snarled and wild and dirty, his bare chest streaked, his chest hair matted with mud. Stiles stares dumbfounded at him, at the way he grits his teeth back at Stiles with all this pain in his eyes.\nThe hunters descend. One of the Argent's is shouting at the woman, Talia (oh god, Talia Hale the alpha herself) and someone else is throwing an emergency blanket over Stiles. And there are pointing guns and other wolves, standing naked and unafraid and Stiles curls in on his own knees, shaking, the back of his neck feeling hot and sore from the bite.\nIt's his father again who calms them. \"Get your gun out of here, Hersh,\" he says dismissively, annoyed. The Argent brother frowns but listens, steps back. Stiles watches, shivering as his father walks to Talia Hale, who has settled her son with some of the other wolves. She greets him and it is an odd sight, his father in his police browns and Talia Hale in just her human skin.\n\"Your son, he's not an alpha?\" his father asks first, and Stiles didn't even think of that, that he might change. That he might grow teeth as long as his fingers, might start howling at the moon.\n\"No,\" Talia says, \"he's a beta. And he's never given anyone any trouble.\"\nStiles' dad gives her the steely sheriff eyes before he tacks onto her words \"--until today.\"\nShe looks unhappy as she agrees \"until today.\"\nHis father sighs, looks over at Stiles and his jaw works. \"The bite...why--?\"\nTalia looks at Stiles too, and her eyes are clear and pale and cool. Stiles shivers harder when they make contact.\n\"Derek has claimed him,\" she admits softly.\nThe hunters start shouting again and it takes a moment for his dad to quiet them and then he's scrubbing at his forehead the way he does when he feels overwhelmed.\n\"Pardon me for my ignorance, but what does that mean, Alpha Hale?\"\nShe looks back at her own son, who is now slumped between two other wolves, his eyes cast aside, mouth turned down in a hard, unhappy frown.\n\"It means your son is his mate.\"\nIt's a long while after that, calming the Argents down.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Hey,\" his father says at Stiles' bedroom door.\n\"Hey,\" Stiles say back dryly. They haven't spoken much for a week since...yeah.\nHis dad pushes the door open a little more and looks around. He leans against the door jamb, frowning a little in thought. And then he pulls the book out of his back pocket and holds it out.\nStiles finishes tying his shoe and gets up to grab it.\nHis face washes over with shame when he sees what it is.\nBeing Claimed: Your Duty to Yourself and Your Wolf.\n\"Dad,\" he says, strangled.\n\"Just...read it,\" his father says bluntly. Not angry, but just uncertain of himself, lost for words.\nStiles nods and sits down hard on his bed, staring at the cover.\n\"I...I asked Alpha Hale and she said it was accurate.\"\nStiles laughs humorlessly, thinking about his father and Alpha Hale on the phone, sharing literature recommendations.\n\"Stiles,\" his father warns.\n\"No, it's fine, dad,\" he sighs. And then presses the book to his forehead for a second while his whole face twists up. He pulls it away and smiles a little, tries to. His father looks at him worriedly. \"Thanks.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGet to Know Your WolfWith patience, open mindedness and a careful mediator, there is no reason why you can't get to know your wolf.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe book is dog-eared and settled in his jacket's breast pocket as he knowingly crosses the Hale line again, this time on the road.\nThe land on this side looks exactly like Beacon Hills, the trees hanging heavy and quiet in the humidity, the fields hazy, rolling at the edges with heat mirage.\nHe walks along the pale-paved road, the sun buzzing at his back, heating the bite mark on his nape.\nHe takes off his plaid shirt when he gets too hot, ties it around his waist and walks on in his sweaty tee-shirt.\nA red pickup truck rumbles up the road. He steps to the side hastily but it stops and Talia Hale leans out, hair golden brown in the sun.\n\"Stiles,\" she says, and smiles. Her face is beautiful, carefully lined at her eyes and mouth. \"Why don't you climb in.\"\nHe's breathing a little fast when he gets into the passenger seat, the leather hot under him. It helps that she's dressed this time. She looks more approachable in a pair of maroon corduroys and a faded denim shirt.\n\"Hi,\" he says, heart drumming quickly. He rubs his sweaty palms on his thighs.\n\"I can drive you back to the town-line or I can bring you up to the house.\" Her offer is genuine, he can tell. But he can also tell what she'd like him to say.\n\"Uhhh,\" he says, swallowing nervously. \"I can come over for a while?\"\nShe smiles again, bright with all those white teeth in her mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe doesn't know what to feel when she says \"Derek's not home,\" as they pull up to the big old house in the woods.\n\"Oh,\" he says stupidly.\n\"Come on,\" she gets out and there are kids sitting on the porch, all tan-shoulders and sunburned faces that track Stiles as he climbs up the steps behind her.\n\"My nephews,\" she tells Stiles and pushes open the screen door, holding it briefly for Stiles to follow. As she lopes in front of him, her loose hair swings a little. The house is gloomy inside compared to the sun-stroke of the day, but not unwelcoming or cold. Stiles pauses in the hall, looks into a wide, airy room with soft, old sofas, all frayed around the edges like little Were-paws have fringed them for ages.\nA Were is coming down stairs when Stiles' turns back around. He feels his face go hot with embarrassment at being caught snooping around.\nShe's got a book curled in her hand and they just freeze at the sight of each other before Talia Hale's voice wafts in from the back of the house \"Laura, invite Stiles in please?\"\nLaura rolls her eyes and it's so human that it makes Stiles' shoulders loosen.\n\"Hey,\" she says, bored as she walks him back through. \"Stiles, right? Stilinski? Your dad's the sheriff?\"\nStiles shoves his trembling hands into his pants pockets, trying to look cool. \"Yeah.\"\nThe kitchen is big and warm and yellow, lit up with a picture window facing the backyard and Talia is pulling stuff out of the fridge when they walk in. \"Your dad's hot,\" Laura tells him nonchalantly and Stiles gapes in disbelief.\n\"Laura,\" her mother says sharply. Laura walks out again and Stiles watches her go, mouth still agape.\n\"She's just trying to rile you,\" Talia soothes, and begins washing some greens in the sink. \"Don't take anything too seriously.\"\n\"W-what,\" Stiles tries, \"you trying to say my dad's not hot?\"\nShe pauses and is silent for so long, he starts to sweat a little and then she's laughing hoarsely, a deep, pleased sound. He smiles back, big and dorky in his relief.\n\"Come help me, Stiles,\" she beckons, putting out a chopping board, a knife and three summer squashes. \"And tell me all about you. How has school been?\"\nAnd then it's easy. He helps her finish dinner for her pack while he prattles on at her like she's one of his favorite aunts or something.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's just started looking forward to eating what they've made when Laura pops in again, face agitated. \"Mom, the police.\"\nTalia sighs and wipes her hands off on a dishtowel. \"Come,\" she beckons to Stiles.\nHe sees the flash or blue and red lights from the window. He's about to apologize for bringing the law to their land again when the front door flies open and Derek Hale comes stumbling in, face full of fear.\nHe's in some lacrosse shorts and pads like he just ran from practice, his hair wet at the tips like he actually sweat doing so. He looks like he's going to say something but the moment he sees Stiles, he goes very still and just...stares at him.\n\"...you play lacrosse?\" Stiles asks like he can't keep his big mouth shut and Derek just looks at him, all wide eyes.\nAnd then his eyebrows come together in confusion and he says, voice very soft \"Yes?--\" and gets interrupted by Stiles' dad shouting \"Stiles! Get your ass out here!\" from the yard.\n\"Go, love,\" Talia says, suddenly there again and guiding him out. He has to walk past Derek and when he does, Derek flinches away a little, but not soon enough that Stiles doesn't get a sense of how much bigger he is, how much taller. How freaking attractive.\n\"Jesus,\" he whispers to himself on the porch, dazed by it.\nTalia actually smiles as she gives him a little push towards the stairs.\nHis dad is standing on the lawn with his arms crossed over his chest, looking very forbidding in his uniform and sunglasses. Stiles sighs, slumps a little as he walks down the stairs towards him.\n\"Sheriff Stilinski,\" Talia Hale says in greeting.\n\"Alpha Hale,\" his dad says back, watching Stiles the whole time. Stiles climbs into the passenger seat with his head down. He looks up once and catches Laura Hale standing on the porch with a little smirk on her face.\nHe doesn't think, just sticks his tongue out at her and her smile grows until it's full-blown and she looks just like her mom.\nHe looks away again when his dad gets in the car with a deep, disappointed sigh and starts the engine.\n\"Nothing happened!\" Stiles argues on the drive home. \"Derek wasn't even there! I mean, not until I was leaving--\"\n\"Stiles, you can't just walk into Were land alone. You were lucky that Alpha Hale found you first. What if a jealous beta had? Do you even know how uncommon and taboo it is for the Alpha's son to claim a human? You don't know how the pack feels! You might just have started an inter-pack feud--\"\n\"Really?\" Stiles says, remembering the quiet homestead and the kids all lazy on the porch. Laura rolling her eyes. Talia putting dry pasta in a boiling pot.\nDerek in his lacrosse shorts, knees all grass-stained and handsome face flushed from running.\n\"--it didn't seem like that.\"\n\"Not everything is as it seems,\" his father argues and Stiles looks away, curled in on himself.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter that, it's done by the book. Literally by the book. With formal invites and chaperons and Stiles' dad fussing over his suit tie.\n\"Dad, it's fine. It's just dinner. Talia Hale isn't some cocktail hour lady, she's really...chill and laid back.\"\nStiles' dad snorts, retying his tie once more in the mirror. \"She's one of the richest Weres in the state, kid. We're just going to do our best to look nice tonight.\"\nStiles wanders away grumbling. Waits out on the front stoop for the Argent brothers to show. He doesn't love the idea of them coming, though it helps to know they'll just be waiting in the car.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTalia answers the door wearing a summer dress that matches her pale green eyes. Stiles' dad is nervous when he shakes her hand.\nShe beckons them in and all the lights are on in the house, setting it ablaze, bright and yellow and Stiles squints a little, startles when he sees how many Hales are there. It's definitely not the whole pack but it's a crowd of them.\n\"You both look handsome,\" Talia tells them, taking Stiles' dad's jacket and then she turns her eyes on Stiles and smiles with all this affection. \"Stiles, you cut your hair. It's very nice.\" And then she's walking Stiles into the pack a little with a hand on his knobby shoulder and saying \"Isn't his haircut handsome?\"\nThe pack makes general sounds of approval and close in around them and they're all warm and inviting and Stiles can't make out any familiar faces as he blushes and stutters out thanks and says hi, nice to meet you and shakes a few hands as Talia leads him through proudly.\nHe feels welcome here. He feels like he's wanted here and it's nice and strange all at the same time. He's read the book and he can kind of understand it, but not wholly, not like they do. He'll never feel what they feel, how one, awkward, too-long bite in the woods that night suddenly made him pack. Family.\n\"This is Peter, my brother,\" Talia says and there is a man holding a squirming baby in front of him, flashing him a smile and saying \"Hey, nice to meet you finally.\"\n\"Nice to meet you--\" Stiles says back and then he's being introduced to others: Allie, Peter's wife. Grace and Jameson, Ben's parents. Cora, Oliver, Helen. A little boy named Cedar, who runs through with a dinosaur toy, barking at everyone. Two other cousins whose names Stiles forgets. And then Laura is there with a man named Thomas and then Derek. Derek, who stands up hurriedly from the couch, and with stiff motions, introduces himself to Stiles' father.\n\"Sheriff Stilinski, I'm Derek Hale,\" he says seriously, earnestly. And he's wearing a tie. Just like Stiles's dad. And his dark hair is brushed back neatly off his forehead.\nStiles' dad takes Derek's hand firmly and shakes. Says \"It's nice to meet you under better circumstances, Derek.\"\nDerek shoots Stiles a nervous look and then looks back at Stiles' dad, still shaking his hand. \"Yes, sir.\"\nStiles' dad has to free himself with an amused smile and then Derek is jerking his hand away like he's been shocked and looking worse for wear.\n\"Oh god, dad. Leave him alone,\" Stiles can't help muttering, which makes Derek look at him again, wide-eyed, and his dad snort.\n\"Go on, then. Go...get to know each other or something, Jesus,\" his dad says, clapping Stiles' shoulder. Stiles grabs Derek's arm and walks them away quickly.\nThey're in a little hall beneath the stairs when Derek frees his arm with a wincing look on his face. \"Uh, sorry,\" Stiles offers. \"My dad just--is uh--\"\nThey look at each other and Stiles can't finish what he was going to say because Derek is really, really good-looking (Jesus) but also just standing there, looking at Stiles like Stiles is about to rip his heart out of his chest or something.\n\"Why--\" Stiles starts, and then breathes \"are you scared of me?\"\nDerek swallows and looks away, pained.\n\"What? Do you think--\" Stiles tries. \"I'm not an Argent or something.\"\n\"I know,\" Derek says quickly, adamantly.\n\"I don't get it,\" Stiles says, and he starts to deflate a little, feeling out of his depth. \"I uh. Not a lot of people understand why you bit me because I'm kind of...kind of a spazz.\"\nDerek looks at him, hard.\n\"They all think you were desperate--\"\nDerek makes an angry sound in his throat, face all outraged.\n\"It's ok, man. I uh. It's kind of a weird choice. Maybe we were too close to the new moon or something? Isn't that a thing? Werewolf rut or lust or--\" and then he's being pressed roughly into the wall by pinching hands and Derek looms over him for a second, breathing heavily and threateningly before he disappears around the corner.\n\"Woah, ok,\" Stiles gasps to himself, shaken.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's still trembling a little as he walks into the next room and Laura appears out of nowhere, tips his head back and looks into his eyes. \"Stiles, are you ok?\"\n\"Uh, yeah? I just maybe made your brother angry,\" he says and Talia appears too, concerned.\nLaura makes a face like she doesn't believe him but Talia sends her away with a firm \"Go. Find him. Talk to him.\"\nThen she leads Stiles to his father and says, sighing. \"Perhaps tonight was a little too soon.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" Stiles says, miserable as she packs them into the car with tupperware of dinner, extras for the Argents who mutter their thanks with downcast eyes.\n\"It's ok, Stiles,\" she says, face so fond it hurts him a little.\n\"No, it's not ok,\" Stiles says. \"I said...I said something really rude, I think. I think I implied something really rude and bigoted.\"\nShe's leaning down in the window with her hair tucked behind her ears, face all lined with concern. \"Stiles--\"\n\"I told him he probably was just in...in werewolf lust when he claimed me,\" Stiles admits unhappily, whispering.\nHer face is surprised. One of the Argents, who heard him, snorts in laughter.\nShe gives the man a stern look and then runs a hand through Stiles' hair gently, just once.\n\"That's not true, you know?\"\nStiles nods slowly, because he thinks he knows. He kind of knows.\nNext to him, his father says \"Oh hell, Stiles.\"\n\"It's ok. You'll see,\" she smiles and then steps back. Waves as they drive away.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey try again with a picnic on Hale land. This time, his dad forgoes the Argent protection detail and the pack seems calmer, quieter. They're in the big, sloping field behind the Hale house, near where a few trees shade a rocky little brook that feeds into the river.\nHe feels the healed bite mark at his nape go hot and awake when Derek walks up to greet them with an uncomfortable look on his face and a handful of wildflowers.\n\"Hey, uh. I'm sorry about--\" Stiles starts to say but Derek just holds out the flowers. Stiles takes them with fumbling hands.\nDerek's eyes watch him closely as Stiles looks at the bouquet and then smells it because he doesn't know what else to do. It's sweet, full of honeysuckle. He smiles and Derek's eyes track it and then Stiles sneezes. Twice.\nWhen he can open his eyes again, Derek is grabbing the flowers out of his hand and throwing them away. It's the first thing he sees, Derek with a determined look on his face, throwing Stiles' flowers away like they're a live grenade.\nStiles sniffs and smiles weakly but Derek's shoulders hunch and he suddenly, stiffly walks away.\nTalia watches them from a picnic blanket, hand cutting the sun from her eyes.\n\"That boy is an odd one,\" his father whispers, and there's no way that any werewolf in the field missed it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time is at the lake on the Hale preserve, the Hales all in swimsuits and trunks, though Stiles is pretty sure that the pack could care less about modesty when humans aren't around (which becomes apparent when most of the little ones have to be wrangled back into their swimsuits every few minutes; one with a little pale butt goes bounding past Stiles into the water).\nIt sounded like fun when his father told him about it but then it's just him shivering in his shorts and a towel, skinny and human and cold while golden Weres splash in the chilly,\nmountain lake.\nDerek spends the day on the other side of the beach, mostly by himself. Stiles watches, curled around his knees for warmth, as Talia walks across the sand to her son. They talk for a long time, Derek throwing rocks in the water and then they walk back together, Talia with her arm over her son's shoulders.\nThey walk right up to where Stiles is shivering and his father is reading a book quietly in a beach chair. Talia looks at her son and Derek looks at his feet and says \"do you want to come out with me in the boat?\"\nStiles nods, teeth chattering and Derek makes a huffing noise and pulls off his sweatshirt, hands it to Stiles.\nIt's body-warm, feverishly so, from the Were's skin and it smells spicy like Derek hasn't bathed today. It's nice to slip on, the sleeves fitting Stiles' long arms but the shoulders are stretched out, a little too big on him. It'll keep him warm but it's almost not worth it when he realizes, as Derek struts away like it's the only way he can walk, that he's about to be stuck in a boat with the man while he's half-naked. Derek's back is golden and lithe and Stiles stares, mouth-breathing a little.\n\"Be good,\" his father says sternly.\nStiles has to jog to catch up when the Were looks over his shoulder to see if he's following.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek does all the work, arms bunching and pulling as he rows. Stiles tries not to look, watches a loon fishing.\nThey end up rowing all the way out to the big rock, and then Derek pulls the oars in and just sits there, frowning to himself.\n\"Thank you for the flowers. Before,\" he tries.\nDerek scoffs. \"You were allergic to them.\"\n\"No I wasn't!\" Stiles says quickly. \"I just have hay fever. Sometimes. They were fine.\"\n\"Oh,\" Derek says, and then his mouth curls downwards.\nHe should reassure him, but instead he barks out a sharp laugh, says \"You bombed those things across the field like they were about to explode.\"\nDerek looks startled as Stiles tips the boat a little, laughing at the memory.\n\"It was funny,\" he explains. Derek watches him quietly and then looks away.\nIt's awkward and forced, this time alone together. The sun beats hot on the lake, but the wind is cool. It leaves him both sunburned and cuddled tightly in Derek's sweatshirt for warmth. They don't talk. And then Derek sighs and puts the oars back into the water.\nWhen they're close to shore, Derek's expression goes through all these feelings while Stiles watches and then he whispers \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"For what?\" Stiles wonders, smiling about the flowers again.\nThe boat hits the sandy bottom of the shallows and Derek climbs out into the water to tug it onto the grassy shore. \"For biting you in the first place,\" Derek says softly, looking at Stiles with all this open regret.\nFalling in the cold center of the lake would have felt less unpleasant than realizing Derek's regret and Stiles doesn't know what to say. He just gapes and Derek grimaces and walks away, leaves him to heft himself out of the boat alone and figure out what to do with Derek's sweatshirt, which he just leaves draped over the side of an oar.\nHe walks back to his dad and says \"can we go?\" hugging himself.\nHis father sees his face and nods, gets up, concern etched in his brow.\nThey're at the car when Talia catches up and Stiles slams the door and slumps deep into the cup of his seat, ignoring them as his dad and Talia talk frantically outside to one another.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLaura is wrangling all the nieces and nephews, rolling in the grass with them the next time they come by.\nTalia greets them on the porch steps. \"Derek has lacrosse practice this afternoon. Don't you play lacrosse too, Stiles?\"\n\"Uh, for Beacon Hills, yeah,\" Stiles says and frowns when his dad claps him on the shoulder and walks back to the car.\n\"Dad--\" he says, trying to follow but one of the kids rolls right into his legs and trips him up.\n\"I'll be back to get you by night fall. Be good. Listen to Alpha Hale,\" he says and gets in the car.\n\"Dad!\" Stiles says louder, and ends up in the grass, downed by the kid that tripped him.\n'Have fun!\" his dad shouts out the window and beeps the horn as Stiles gets scent-marked by three Hale kids, earnestly rubbing their cheeks against his face and one against his shin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe gives up trying to fight them and ends up lying in the grass next to Laura with his eyes closed, relaxed like he hasn't been for the whole summer, a few of the kids snoozing on him, drooling on his shoulder, his chest.\nLaura tells him it's a pack thing, that the little ones puppy pile. And then she rolls nearer and cuffs her arm around one of the pups and sleeps too. It makes Stiles' eyelids heavy, his breathing slow.\nHe wakes up suddenly, surprised he fell asleep at all. He's alone on the grass.\nThe house looms gloomily in front of him like Derek Hale's unhappy face. He gets up and brushes off his ass, goes looking for the Weres.\nEverything is silent though, still. Even the light. No one is home. They must have all gone somewhere and left him.\nHe grumbles to himself as he starts walking back to the town-line alone.\nThe woods are empty. At least they feel empty. He keeps pausing, looking around, listening. Listening for something. He looks over his shoulder and there's no one there.\nHe wakes up with a start, disoriented and Laura owls an eye at him. The sun is hot, making his hair sweaty. He sits up, groggy and disheveled. Looks around. \"Shit, I was dreaming.\"\n\"About werewolves?\" Laura asks, smirking.\nHe frowns, runs his hands through his damp hair. \"No, there were no Weres. The woods were all...empty.\"\nShe makes a face at that and pushes herself up on her feet. \"There are more of us than you can count.\"\nIt makes Stiles lie back for a bit, weirdly relieved. The kids are all on the porch with Peter Hale, eating melty popsicles. Stiles gets up, brushes off his ass and wanders over.\nPeter offers him a red one with a raised brow and Stiles settles on the steps next to Cedar and lets the cold sweetness wake him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe gets dropped off early on Sunday, finds Talia baking bread in the kitchen, her hair pulled up in a messy bun.\n\"Derek's still sleeping,\" she says, voice rich and low.\nStiles shrugs and washes his hands to help.\nHe kneads dough on a big, wooden cutting board until it turns glossy and elastic and then Talia busses it away in a bowl, covers it to rise. She pours them both coffee and they sit at the kitchen table in the dough-sweet kitchen, drinking, arms covered with flour.\n\"I think we're stuck,\" he admits. She looks at him curiously over her mug. \"We just keep misunderstanding each other and getting angry. I think we need to do the next part.\"\n\"The next part?\" she asks.\nHe reaches into his back pocket and pulls out the little book. Her eyebrows rise. Then she clears her voice and says \"what's the next part of Being Claimed Stiles?\"\nHe looks at it, squeezes it in his hand, shy. \"I uh. Something about being scent-marked.\"\nThere's a thump from upstairs and Talia smiles, leans back in her seat with her coffee. \"Oh?\"\n\"Yeah, uh--\" Stiles says, distracted as the thumping moves across the floor upstairs. \"I think we should just do that now and see if it helps. Some of the pack pups have marked me already, I guess? But maybe we're holding up the process because we haven't tried--\"\nThen there are quick, heavy feet on the stairs and Stiles turns around in his chair just in time to get a sleepy, frowning, half-naked Derek Hale in his arms.\n\"Woah!\" Stiles says. Derek hunches over him, heavy and spicy, hot-skinned. Buries his face against Stiles' shoulder and rolls it there, like Stiles' isn't built bony and sharp. He rubs the grain of his unshaven cheek against Stiles' neck and tee-shirted shoulder, taking frantic little breaths while he does it.\nTalia gets up, rustles her hand through both of their hair as she leaves them alone for a bit.\nStiles sits very still, blushing, palms hovering at Derek's naked back for a minute before they settle there lightly, ginger and uncertain against that heat. Derek scent-marks him with his cheek, leaves the skin of Stiles' throat scratchy and beard-burned. There's a moment where Stiles' heart upticks, when he remembers the woods, that same spicy scent at his back when the wolf had his nape locked in its teeth and that's when Derek jerks away.\nStiles touches at his hot, itchy skin after and says \"Dude, you're hairy for a teenager.\"\nDerek's eyes are thin like he's still half-asleep, eyebrows collapsed together in that Hale resting face of eternal frustration. But he mumbles \"I'm a werewolf, Stiles,\" in response.\n\"--that's probably it,\" Stiles agrees quietly, stupidly surprised that Derek even knows his name.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow when they come for dinner, Derek meets them impatiently on the porch, shifting his weight restlessly from foot to foot, arms crossed over his chest as he frowns.\n\"I'm coming, just give me a second!\" Stiles calls from the car, trying to grab up the casserole and salad they packed in the backseat.\n\"I got this, you go. He looks like he's about to throw himself off that porch,\" Stiles' dad says, shooing him.\nStiles runs up the steps with his arms wide open, a knowing smirk on his face. Derek meets him halfway, clutches at Stiles as he scent-marks him, roughing their cheeks together.\nIt only takes a few strokes now, because they do this so often. Stiles barely gets in a loose bro-hug before Derek is moving away again, still awkward even after literally rubbing their faces together.\n\"Better?\" Stiles asks and Derek shrugs, looks away. But it must be better because Derek is loose in the shoulders. They walk in together and the pack greets them with happy noise, Peter shaking Stiles' dad's hand.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings get easier after Stiles gives Derek free rein to scent-mark him whenever he needs to. It's like something inside of Derek, that's made him stiff and closed off unlocks a little, jars open.\nThey still don't really know how to talk to each other, and Stiles ends up spending more time with the pups and Talia than Derek on any given visit, but there's not the same full-bodied strain to their interactions.\nThe only time it gets particularly bad again is when Stiles can't make it out for a week when his grandmum is visiting. When he finally gets back to the Hale House, Derek meets them in the driveway and jerks the car door open, forcibly pulls Stiles out by his wrist.\n\"--oh, h-hey,\" Stiles tries but Derek drags him away from his dad, away from the house and into the trees.\nStiles trips as he tries to keep up, mouth agape. He starts apologizing for whatever boneheaded thing he's done this time. He wonders if the wolf will come out. If the wolf will hunt him again and it makes his blood quicken.\nHe's turned and knocked right into a tree, a breath shocked out of him. He puts his hands up in defense and whines \"Sorry. Sorry! I didn't mean to do anything...I didn't know--\"\nas Derek faceplants against his shoulder.\n\"Oh,\" Stiles says after a while, when Derek just breathes there.\n\"Hey,\" he says softly, taking a bit of Derek's weight. There's dark hair tickling his nose and he turns his head slightly towards it and takes his own, small sniff.\n\"--did you just scent me?\" Derek asks, voice muffled against Stiles' shirt.\n\"Yeah, I guess so?\" Stiles says. He takes a deeper inhale of Derek's Were scent, spicy and sweaty and warm and Derek makes this throaty, ticking noise, almost like a purr.\n\"You don't smell like pack anymore,\" Derek tells him, and Stiles can feel his hot breath, in and out quickly, on his throat.\n\"It's only a matter of time before your nieces and nephews puppy-pile,\" he soothes.\nDerek pulls away. His face is flushed, eyes a little lost.\nStiles swallows, because Jesus Christ, the Were is fucking hot.\nDerek steps back, shoves his hands into the pockets of his jeans. He looks skittish, like he might run, so Stiles steps into him and pointedly drags his own cheek and forehead against Derek's shoulder, roughing up his shirt sleeve. Derek steadies him with a hand to his elbow and lets him.\nWhen he pulls away, Derek's eyes are thinned out, content.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSchool is starting up again and he's spending the last Saturday of his break with the Hales. It's late, the gibbous moon nearly fat over their heads, making the house a pale ghost of itself.\nPeter and Thomas, Laura's mate, start a bonfire in the back field that the pups practice howling around, their little voices echoing and high-pitched. The Were's faces dance with orange light, all sharp-lined. Their eyes catch the light in that strange way animal eyes do, glowing like headlights. It makes Stiles stare from his spot on a dry log beside the bonfire, mouth agape.\nDerek joins him later with a stick, sits near even though they don't talk, they rarely talk. He pokes the fire with his stick a few times, watching the sparks scatter.\nIt hits Stiles, that he's going to miss this. All this time he's gotten to spend with the Hale pack.\nHis dad is drinking a beer on the other side of the fire, talking with Jameson, laughing about something, tipsy enough that the skin of his neck is ruddy.\nIt feels good, settled. Stiles ducks his head to look at Derek, who is frowning in spite of the glowy, happy feeling of the evening.\n\"What? What is it?\" Stiles whispers, interested.\nDerek's eyes dart to his. He looks like he has no idea what he wants to say and then he closes his eyes suddenly, tightly, gruffs out \"I won't see you.\"\nStiles knocks their shoulders together awkwardly. \"Hey, buddy, that's not true. I'll come see you on the weekends.\"\nDerek doesn't look like he believes it, but he says \"Can you...do something for me?\"\nStiles shrugs, \"Sure.\"\nDerek's mouth thins and he considers. He plucks bark off the log as he thinks. \"Can you go up to my room and just...trade your shirt for one of mine?\"\nStiles mouth falls open. Derek notices his surprise and his lips thin and turn down darkly.\n\"No no, hey. It's cool. I'll do it. I'd love to do it.\" He jumps up so Derek can't change is mind, in action. \"--but I get to take whatever I want!\"\nDerek nods, eyebrows lifting as he watches Stiles turn and jog back to the house.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Hey,\" Laura says, passing him in the hall. Stiles stops her.\n\"Which one is Derek's room?\" he asks and though she's surprised by the question, she points to the closed door at the end of the hall. \"Ok, thanks.\"\n\"Don't get yourself into trouble, Stilinski,\" she sings as she goes down the stairs.\nStiles lets himself in, closes the door behind him.\nHe finds a light switch blindly on the wall and it turns on the standing lamp in the corner.\nThe room is...normal. A dresser with clothes spilling out. A bookshelf stuffed with fantasy paperbacks. A messy unmade bed.\nStiles strips off his shirt, sits down on the bed and peeks through the crap on Derek's nightstand. There are some receipts, a handful of change. A collection of Isaac Asimov short stories. Stiles picks it up to look at it and the bookmark slips out before he can catch it.\nHe picks it up off the floor and stares at it.\nIt's his school photo from last year, ripped out of a yearbook.\n\"Holy shit,\" he breathes and it hits him for the first time ever, that maybe Derek didn't accidentally pick him in the woods that day. That maybe...maybe Derek likes him a little bit after all.\nHe stares at his own, dorky face for a minute before stuffing the photo back in the book.\nBefore he puts on a shirt, he lets himself lie back in Derek's bed, shaky with what he's doing. He knows that his scent is going to be thick here when Derek goes to bed tonight.\nAnd he still does it, turns over so he can smell Derek's pillow, the sour-spiciness of his scent layered here.\nThen he shoves out of the bed, flushing when he realizes he's boned up in his shorts.\nHe kicks through Derek's clothes on the floor until he finds what he wants, Derek's dirty, scent-rich lacrosse shirt. He pulls it on and gnaws his lip a little, readjusts himself in his shorts.\nThen he puts on a brave face and goes downstairs, out the back door of the kitchen, towards the warm light of the bonfire.\nThe Weres he passes all pause and turn to him, eyes following. Like they know. They do know. Stiles is wearing Derek's scent like he's wrapped himself up naked in his arms. He's wearing Derek's scent like a promise.\nWhen he reaches the fire, Peter actually drops the heavy branch he's dragging and looks at him, eyes widening.\nAnd Derek, Derek's nostrils flare and his eyebrows crawl up to his hairline and his mouth falls open on a single, whimpery sound.\nStiles swallows and says \"we should probably get going,\" to his dad.\nFrowning, his father gets up and says \"well, I guess you do have school tomorrow,\" clearly happy to stay if he could.\nStiles makes his way to Derek and, while the guy just looks at him like he's caught in the crosshairs of a shotgun, Stiles pats his shoulder tentatively and says \"So I'll see you next weekend?\"\nDerek nods, speechless.\n\"Ok, great,\" Stile says, and looks around, seeing all the other Weres just staring at him too.\n\"Oh, well. Bye!\" Stiles says loudly and waves a little.\nOn the way to the car, Talia Hale catches up to them, takes one look at Stiles swallowed up in Derek's lacrosse shirt and lets out a little, surprised sound.\n\"Goodnight, Alpha Hale--\" Stiles' dad says warmly.\n\"Goodnight, sheriff,\" she says. And then to Stiles \"Goodnight, Stiles.\"\nIn the car, his dad lets out a hard sigh. \"Jesus, Stiles. You don't do anything halfway, do you kiddo?\"\n\"What do you mean?\" he wonders, but he knows. He can smell Derek on him. He's drenched in it.\n\"Lets just say that if any of the pack was wondering about how serious you are about this claiming nonsense, they'd know now.\"\nStiles makes a face, but when he turns away to look out the window, he takes a little, silent sniff of Derek's shirt sleeve.\n\"So do you think I'm a freak now?\" he asks breathlessly, slumped over on himself.\nScott looks aside, mouth parted in thought. He just got back from his cousins' house in Taos tonight, and they're sitting outside on the picnic tables at the Puffy Taco, eating and staring at the flickering streetlight in the parking lot.\n\"No?\" Scott says, consternated. \"You're not a freak, Stiles. It's just...not what I expected.\"\n\"Tell me about it,\" Stiles mutters.\n\"What were you doing, walking over there alone??\"\nStiles shrugs, feeling stupid. \"I don't know. Last year Greenberg said his dad said there were these ruins in the woods near the town-line and I was bored, man--\"\n\"You crossed the line because of something Greenberg said?!\" Scott asks, horrified.\n\"Shut up, dude! I don't know! It was late and I was bored and I took too much adderall--\"\n\"Stiles,\" Scott bemoans. \"This is all my fault. I shouldn't have gone away all summer.\" He drops his face onto his crossed arm on the table.\n\"Oh my god, you don't need to martyr yourself with every little bad thing that happens in the world, dude. Stop.\"\nStiles gives him a little backrub until Scott lifts his head up again to finish his taco. They eat, Stiles' straw making slurpy noises in his empty cup.\n\"What're they like, the Hales?\" Scott asks softly.\n\"Cool,\" Stiles shrugs. Scott gives him a skeptical look. \"No really, they're pretty nice. I mean, I'm kind of pack now, so they're nice to me. But they're also nice to my dad. Alpha Hale is really laid-back. We uh. Sometimes we cook together.\"\n\"What's Derek like?\" Scott pries deeper, like he expects that Stiles is hiding the awful truth underneath his praise.\n\"Derek is fine. Derek is...Derek is--\" he can't seem to find the right words. The ones he thinks of make him blush a little.\n\"Oh, it's like that?\" Scott says, knowing him too well.\n\"No! I mean. No, dude. He's just really good-looking. But he's also weird and distant and I'm pretty sure he fucking hates himself for claiming me in the first place.\"\nScott frowns hard. \"Not cool.\"\n\"Scott--\"\n\"--no, that's bullshit. He's lucky to have you. He should feel freaking lucky.\"\nStiles smiles weakly, knocks their shoulders together. \"Thanks.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"So,\" he starts, and she turns around and grins when she sees him standing in her back yard. \"Am I a freak now?\"\nShe lowers her bow and gives him a one-armed hug, grinning wider. She'd gone to Hunter camp or something most of the summer. Scott said she'd come home with some killer new sword skills.\n\"No,\" Allison says, and then her brow has a little, concerned cut to it. \"Are you ok, though? Dad said it wasn't mutual.\"\n\"Oh no, it's mutual, it's very mutual,\" Stiles hustles to explain. She quirks her brow. \"I mean, mostly. Mostly mutual. Not at first! But things are going well. Better. I think I'm kind of growing on him.\"\n\"Growing on him?\" she says, suddenly serious, unimpressed.\n\"--growing on each other?\" he tries. \"It's just...neither of us were ready. I'm pretty sure he was running on instinct when he claimed me. Like if you ever met him, you'd know he's just not the kind of guy who bites people on purpose--\"\n\"Oh, I've met him,\" she says ominously, shooting an arrow. It zips across the yard, embedding in a target.\n\"You have?\" he asks. \"Nice shot.\"\n\"Mmm-hm,\" she hums and frowns at her aim. Goes for another arrow. \"We meet with the Hales every few months. Derek comes with his sister and mum sometimes. He's...\" she pauses and fiddles with her bow. \"He's quiet more than anything. My aunt used to try to rile him up sometimes and he'd just stare at her, all blank and unimpressed.\"\nStiles frowns, tries to imagine Derek having to deal with Kate Argent's throaty jibes.\n\"He's a good guy, Ally,\" Stiles says.\nShe sighs, looks at him. \"I'm sure he is, for a werewolf. But you have to be careful, Stiles. Learn the rules. Keep your head down. And come to us if you need protection. It's what we do.\"\nStiles nods. Allison smiles at him and taps his shin with her bow. \"Do you want to hang out? My cousin Carson is coming over for dinner. You guys could talk lacrosse.\"\n\"Yeah right, I'm pretty sure Carson thinks I walk out of existence the second I leave the field. I just wanted to come over and see if we were good.\"\nShe smiles, rolling her eyes. \"We're good, Stiles.\"\n\"Thanks, Ally,\" he says sweetly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe walked out of school at the end of last year a nobody and walked back in a minor celebrity.\n\"Hey, how are you? I can't even imagine what your life must be like now?\" a blond freshman girl he's never even seen before says with all this concern, taking his arm in hers.\n\"Uh, Scott?\" Stiles swallows, looking back at his friend who rolls his eyes.\n\"Shoo, shoo,\" Lydia Martin says, waving her hands at the freshman. The girl makes a face and moves away, only to be replaced by Lydia herself, who draws Stiles on with her, chin tilted up defiantly as the crowded hallway parts for them.\n\"This is what makes you pay attention to me? This?\" Stiles asks, exasperated.\n\"Well,\" she says primly, pausing to open her locker. She puts her hand flat to his chest when he tries to leave. \"Lets just say you had nothing to endorse you before.\"\nHe snorts. \"Oh, so being mated to a werewolf--\"\n\"--to a Hale wolf,\" she says forbiddingly. She pauses, looks at him with keen eyes. \"--there must be more to you than that terrible flannel and teeshirt combo.\"\n\"Nice,\" he mutters.\n\"--but that can be fixed. We can work with that.\"\n\"W-what? Fixed?\" he sputters.\nShe links their arms and shuts her locker, drags him with her to AP English.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEveryone else is almost cool about it. The only person who openly gives him shit for it is Jackson, who gives him shit for everything anyway, and who ends up getting a \"Not cool, man,\" from Danny when Jackson calls Stiles a wolf bitch during practice.\nJackson sighs and goes running off after Danny to apologize, so all in all, coming out as a claimed werewolf mate isn't too terrible.\nThere are some kids in the halls that stare, some that avoid him like he's got something communicable, but he was never the most popular kid in high school anyway, so it makes little impact on what his day is like. The only things that bother him are the questions.\nHe feels knuckles draw ticklishly across his bare nape and yelps.\n\"What was it like?\" Karen Finney asks, sitting at his table in the library suddenly, eyes rapt.\nHe pops his collar. Makes a face. \"What? It wasn't...it's not--\"\n\"Did it hurt? God it looks like it hurt. Or did it feel good? In every book I've ever read, they're like...it hurt? But it hurts so good--\"\n\"Oh my god,\" he says, shoving up out of his seat.\n\"Hey, I'm just curious! I won't tell anyone!\" she calls after him and he gets shushed by the librarian.\nAt lunch the next day, Isaac Lahey tosses him an unopened bag of sun chips, sits down across from him, eating his own chips, and stares with critical eyes.\n\"What?\" Stiles asks, uncomfortable.\n\"Did he hunt you? Was it like a mating run? Was it the full moon?\" Isaac asks, munching.\nStiles groans.\n\"Was he going to kill you but then had...urges.\"\n\"Werewolves don't kill people, dude. God. Also, that's gross and highly personal, what the hell.\"\nIsaac shrugs. \"Just curious.\"\n\"Everyone's curious,\" Stiles mutters, but opens up his free chips and eats them anyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCarson Argent runs into him on the way out of Chemistry and gives Stiles a little smile that Stiles double-takes at, because the guy barely looks at him on the field, never even makes eye contact with him and here he is, grinning, eyes all warm and friendly.\n\"Huh,\" Danny says beside him and gives Stiles a raised eyebrow.\n\"Woah, no. No way. Carson?\"\nDanny shrugs, sets his books on a lab table.\n\"--but he's an Argent. They were all grumpy, waving guns about me all summer long. I thought Gerard Argent was going to have an aneurysm.\"\n\"You got this now--\" Danny says, flicking Stiles' collar and gesturing at the pale, healed bite mark on his nape, which Stiles slaps a palm over defensively. \"To a werewolf hunter, you're probably like catnip. You're a damsel in distress. You're sleeping with the enemy--\"\n\"Stop, woah. Woah. Nope. Not ok, Daniel--\" Stiles says, waving at him to shut up.\nDanny grins. \"And you're pretty cute now. You got all shouldery this summer.\"\nStiles stares at him.\n\"I can see the appeal,\" Danny says and winks, sitting back with a pen in hand, flipping open his notebook.\n\"What appeal?\" Scott asks, sitting down next to Stiles.\n\"Nothing,\" Stiles says, blushing, remembering the yearbook photo that fell out of Derek's book.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's been three days and he feels...not so great. Weird. Itchy or something. He actually wears Derek's dirty lacrosse shirt to bed, but he's still uncomfortable in the morning.\nSo that night after he finishes his homework, with his knee bouncing anxiously, he holds his phone cradled to his ear and rings the Hale house.\n\"Hale,\" comes a drawled, annoyed voice on the phone.\n\"Hey uh. Laura?\" Stiles asks.\n\"Oh my god, wait--\" she says quickly, voice all impatient. \"Wait, Stiles don't hang up. Derek!\"\nStiles swallows hard, listening as the phone fumbles and Laura laughs somewhere in the background.\n\"Stiles,\" comes a breathless voice.\n\"Oh god, dude. Dude,\" Stiles chokes out, surprised by the rush of relief he feels. His skin stops crawling and starts to warm over.\nDerek makes a low, fraught sound and then they're just listening to each other breathe like a pair of weirdos until Stiles realizes that he should say something, anything.\n\"How is school? You have school, right? Do you...oh man, I don't even know if you go to school. I assumed you did because of the lacrosse uniform--\"\n\"Yes,\" Derek interrupts. \"But the pack school is small. It's not like your school. Just two rooms. A lot of us home school.\"\n\"Oh,\" Stiles says. Then he doesn't know what else to talk about. They don't talk. They don't ever talk, what the hell? How do they never talk? They just sit close together and scent-mark and Derek looks at him with all this banked, frustrated something and--\nDerek makes a growly noise, hisses \"--shut up Laura,\" and then softly, he asks \"Are you...ok, Stiles?\"\n\"Yeah, buddy. I'm good,\" Stiles says. And then they just listen to each other breathe again.\nHe doesn't know why he does it, but it slips out of his mouth anyway. \"I wear your lacrosse shirt to bed.\"\nDerek's breath catches sharply, a surprised sound.\nThe line goes strange and muffled and Stiles hears Derek shout something and then Laura's on, saying \"Oookay, Stilinski, I'm gonna have to cut this conversation short. There will be no phone sex on the land-line while the kiddos are listening in.\"\nStiles gasps in horror.\n\"Laura!\" Stiles hears Derek roar before the call cuts out.\nHe drops his own phone like its scorched him and buries his hot face in his pillow, groaning in embarrassment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat weekend, he fidgets through several shirt changes until he puts on his baseball shirt and forces himself to walk out of his bedroom.\nThen he fidgets through eating breakfast, watching his dad putter around, making coffee and whistling to himself.\n\"You ready to go over to the Hales or do you want to wait until after lunch?\" his dad asks and he chokes out \"Now is good. Uh. I mean, whatever.\"\nThen he fidgets through the whole drive, messing with the radio station, twitching his fingers over the volume, tracking the houses they pass as they cross the town-line and head ever closer to the homestead.\n\"Do you want me to just drop you off or--?\" his dad asks as they pull up and Stiles is already shoving out the door, giving a short \"Yeah, later dad,\" before he charges up the front steps.\nDerek crashes through the screen door, face all stricken and frantic and Stiles can't help it, he plows right into him with a little shout and gets lifted, lifted right off his feet as Derek lurches around, holding him close and making breathy, desperate noises while Stiles laughs in delight.\nThey stop and look at each other and Derek's heavy eyebrows are all snagged together in frustration and his mouth is all turned down but Stiles has gotten used to reading that face, he knows that face so he just coos nonsensically, leans in and strokes his soft cheek along Derek's, right alone the fine, beardy grain of that cheekbone.\nDerek clings to him, holding him so close and tight Stiles has to struggle to breathe, still laughing a little, but gasping too.\nHe's gently put down on his feet then, and Derek drops his brow against Stiles' throat, scents there, rubs his whole face there, purring low in his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe day is lazy and long, one of those hot days that feels like summer still has its teeth. He falls asleep at one point, sprawled on the slow-moving porch swing, palm to his belly. He blinks in and out a few times, finds Derek sitting nearby on the wood floor, doing homework. It makes Stiles feel all warm to see the fragile little curl of hair behind his ear, when Derek ducks to look at his writing. He sleeps deeper, knowing Derek is nearby.\nHe's jolted awake when one of the cubs bounces on his stomach. He flails and falls off the swing with a hard thump. The kids laugh. Cedar has his little milk teeth out, and he's hissing as Stiles pushes up with a groan. It's not often any of the Weres show their wolf when he's there, so Stiles watches in interest.\n\"Come on,\" Cora Hale mutters, dragging Stiles back onto his feet. She flashes golden eyes at Cedar, who jumps off the high porch and rolls into the grass like the drop is nothing.\nDerek comes out with two cups of coffee and offers one to Stiles, who moans at the gesture, says \"Oh god, you're my favorite.\" He sees, out of the corner of his eye, Derek shoot Cora a tiny but noticeable little smirk.\nCora snorts and disappears into the house and Stiles and him sit and drink in silence, moving back and forth on the porch swing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey go for a walk in the field after, along the creek. Derek doesn't talk a lot, but he pauses Stiles once by reaching over and touching his hand to Stiles' hip, then ducks down to show him a rabbit warren near the creek bed. Stiles watches him tilt his head a little, listening intently. And then his face goes placid, which almost a smile for Derek and Stiles says \"what is it?\"\n\"There are four of them. They can hear us.\"\nStiles nods and Derek stands, turns his head back towards the homestead with this look on his face like he's listening in to his own den, mouth set in a firm line.\nThen he sets off again with Stiles tripping to keep up, towards the woods where Derek picks crab apples and looks them over critically before offering Stiles the good ones.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey get back in time to wash up for a late lunch. Stiles stares at the hair on Derek's tan arm when they share the sink together. It's coarse and dark, gets smoothed under the water and then fluffs up again when Derek dries himself off roughly with a hand towel.\nHe blushes when he turns around and finds Laura watching them.\nTalia comes in late from meeting with part of the pack, walks past them eating, ruffling Derek's hair, pulling Cora's braid and tweaking Stiles' ear. Stiles grins around a mouthful of ham sandwich. She comes back in with a plate and looks at them all with approval. She sits and says \"how was your first week of school, Stiles?\"\nStiles swallows, says \"Good, ma'am. I've got mostly AP classes this year. They think I might be able to graduate early.\"\nShe looks impressed, congratulates him. Derek's shoulders seem to lift and spread as he listens to his mother's praise for Stiles. Stiles can see it, the way he grows taller beside him. It's somehow extra-pleasing, to have the Alpha's approval and to see Derek's pleasure in it.\nAfter he helps Talia and Peter clean up their lunch mess, follows them into the kitchen with a stack of dishes and gets hugged suddenly, pulled into Talia's wiry arms. She pats his back soothingly while she does it and Peter winks at him and walks out of the room.\nAt the last moment before she pulls away, she nuzzles against his jaw and he realizes with a start that he's pack, he's really pack. The Alpha is scent-marking him.\nHe's at a loss for words, can only stare at her after with wide eyes as she chuckles and takes the dishes out of his hands.\n\"Go. See Derek. He's missed you this week.\"\nSo he does. Wanders off to where everyone is sitting on the porch with popsicles, laughing at the kids who are trying to do handstands in the grass.\nDerek jumps up from the stairs when Stiles walks out, an earnest, strained expression on his face.\n\"Hey, uh so--\" he tries for nonchalance but Derek takes his face in his eager hands and kisses him.\nIt's just plush, delicate lips, cold sweetness and the scratch of beard before Derek's drawing away, eyes searching Stiles' face.\nStiles can't close his mouth, it hangs open, breathing roughly. Just a little touch of lips and he's half-gone. He blinks slowly, dazed, and Derek's eyes widen.\nHe takes Stiles by the shoulders, drawing him towards that reddened mouth again, eyelashes dropping heavy and lush before Peter interrupts, says low \"--there are children present.\"\nDerek jerks away like it's hot and Stiles ends up tripping backwards and knocking into the porch rail hard, wincing.\n\"Ow, fuck,\" Stiles breathes out in a rush.\n\"Hey, it's ok. It's ok, he just tripped,\" Laura is saying, but Derek's already backing away, eyes wide.\n\"Derek?\" Stiles says, confused.\nBut the Were jumps off the porch and runs. He runs away, off towards the woods.\n\"I got him,\" Talia says, passing through the screen door and jumping over the steps, then moving too fast for Stiles to see her go.\n\"What happened?\" Stiles asks, laughing a little at how sudden it was.\nThe pack sort of sighs en masse, looking at Stiles. Peter gives Laura a little shoulder squeeze and says to Stiles \"why don't you call your dad, kid. I think it might be a good idea to give Derek a little breathing room.\"\n\"Yeah, ok,\" Stiles mumbles and, rubbing his bruised hip.\nHe squints into the woods as his phone rings, wondering if Derek is out there now in his wolf skin, running, his eyes glowing bright and cold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe looks at the small mark on his hip in the mirror. He bruises easily, his skin always mottled from lacrosse take-downs, from his own inability to walk up stairs correctly. It's a little tender, but nothing that will bother him.\nHe remembers how long it took the bite mark to stop smarting. How it would sting in the shower. How he could feel it when his shirt collar scraped over it. How even a month later, it still felt a little swollen sometimes. When he was hot and sweaty it would feel tight, itchy.\nHe wants to call Derek, tell him look, so sometimes this is going to happen. You're going to make a mistake. Or maybe I'll hurt myself. One time I tripped in the kitchen and pulled out the entire knife drawer onto my feet. It happens. It's human. Haven't you read Being Claimed? Don't freak out.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOn Thursday they have practice, so he gears up and wanders out to the field with Scott, half-listening to his friend's prolonged do you think she'll go with me to the winter formal this year? monologue about Allison. (Stiles has already double-checked with her, and she'd blushed and said \"oh god, yes? When is he going to ask?\") He puts on his helmet just in time, because Carson Argent comes up behind him and taps him on the head twice, rattling him. The guy is huge and that meaty hand can do some damage. Carson shakes off his goalie glove as he talks.\n\"Hey, Stiles. You guys coming out for dinner tomorrow?\"\nStiles blinks at him, turns to Scott in confusion.\nScott shrugs.\n\"My granddad invited your dad and a few of the deputies out for the cookout? You know, the Hunters thing? I was hoping you were coming--\"\n\"Oh, uh. Yeah? Probably,\" Stiles says. He usually goes with his dad to those Argent get-togethers, if only to make sure his dad gets out of there before he has a rage blackout or something.\nCarson smiles, knocks his knuckles into Stiles' helmet and then grabs him by the nape and squeezes.\nIt happens so suddenly, Stiles can't stop him. He's just standing there and then someone else's hot palm is closing over his mark.\nHe winces hard, jerks away.\n\"What? Does it hurt?\" Carson asks, frowning.\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles lies. \"I don't like being touched there.\"\nCarson's frown gets deeper, critical. \"That's not good, Stiles. Did it bite you again?\"\nIt takes him a moment to work out what Carson means by it, and when he does, he chokes \"No.\"\n\"Good,\" Carson says like something's been settled, and then jogs off to join Kelly Hess and coach at the goal.\n\"That was weird, right? Was that weird? Is he into you now?\" Scott asks him.\nStiles has to reach back and stroke at the mark like he's wiping Carson's touch off\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles sighs after. \" And it's maybe not good.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe shoves open the art room, looks in at Allison and asks her \"Are you going to your granddad's thing tomorrow?\"\nShe looks confused for all of two seconds before she deflates \"Ohhhh--\"\n\"Yeah, oh.\"\n\"I forgot,\" she sighs, and brushes her hair out of her face before picking up her pen again.\n\"You have to come,\" he says, slipping inside and grabbing a stool. \"Your cousin is getting all creepy bad touch with me and I need you to run interference.\"\nShe makes a face. Then mutters \"Carson,\" under her breath.\n\"Yeah. He's definitely from the overly aggressive, one-flirtation-away-from-a-restraining-order side of your family. Like Kate,\" Stiles agrees.\nShe looks at him with sympathy. \"Sorry about that.\"\n\"Not your problem. Except if you leave me alone with all his cronies.\"\nShe sterns her jaw and nods once. \"I wouldn't let a brother go in alone.\"\n\"Atta girl,\" he says and jumps up. He's five minutes late for AP Stats.\n\"Stiles!\" she calls before he walks out.\nHe swings around, bag smacking his hip right on Derek's bruise. \"Yeah?\"\n\"They're going to interrogate you. About Derek,\" she says, eyes clear.\nHe thumps his forehead into the door jamb with a groan.\nShe gives him a what can you do? shrug.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tries calling Derek that night, but Cora just sighs, a deep, long, disaffected sound before she says \"he's not here. And even if he was, he probably wouldn't want to talk.\"\nStiles drops into his bed, hand in his hair \"Why? What--it wasn't a big deal. Nothing happened--\"\n\"Just give him some room to breathe,\" she interrupts. \"A few days or something. He's not used to spending so much time with other people.\"\n\"He's with pack all the time,\" Stiles argues. \"There's always like, a dozen people over there.\"\n\"I said other people,\" she says and he catches his lip in his teeth. She sighs down the line. \"I gotta go. Goodnight, Stiles.\"\n\"Night,\" he says dryly.\nHe drops his phone next to his head and stares off at the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next day is all head fog and distraction, like he forgot to take his meds, though he remembers popping them dry before he even got out of bed. He keeps looking at his phone and feeling like he can't do anything to fix this, and it's all he can think about.\nHe rolls it in his hands over and over until Coach takes it away and stashes it in a drawer until schools over.\nAt lunch, he rests his face on his arm and eats listlessly while Scott and Allison give each other worried looks overhead.\n\"You look like shit,\" Lydia says out of the side of her mouth in English.\n\"Thanks. Awesome,\" he mumbles.\nShe sighs and takes his notebook from him. He doesn't even bother fighting her and is surprised when she passes it back after class, filled with cramped notes on Gloria Anzaldua.\n\"Don't you need these?\"\n\"Not really,\" she says. \"I wrote it down, so I'll remember it. But if I give this to you, you need to study them because no one wastes my time and nobody wastes Gloria Anzaldua's time, ok?\"\n\"Ok,\" he agrees, nodding. She gives him a last, unimpressed look and grabs her bag.\n\"Thanks Lydia!\" he calls and she waves him off.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis dad literally does breathing exercises in the car every time he's about to see Gerard Argent.\n\"In, deep breath,\" Stiles coaches. \"Let it sit for a second, yeah. Slooooow exhale--\"\nHis dad sighs hard and shoots him a dark look. \"Slow exhale, dad.\"\n\"This is my least favorite part of being the sheriff, you know that, right?\"\n\"Yes, dad. Everyone knows that. Gerard Argent knows that.\"\n\"I used to think it was a good thing but now I just--\" he trails off, eyes narrowed on the road, the sun setting bright and burning. \"I'd rather be over Alpha Hale's for another bonfire, to be perfectly honest.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles says softly in agreement. He hasn't told his dad about the Derek not talking to him part. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe Derek will call and he'll go over this weekend and Derek will be his normal, restrained, uncommunicative self. Without the running away part.\nThey pull up to the compound and Leland Argent, in douchey mirrored aviators, peers in at them from the security booth before he buzzes them through.\nHis dad waves, muttering \"Bonehead.\"\nStiles snorts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAllison meets them at the door, gives Stiles' dad a little hug and then grabs Stiles' arm. \"Come on, we're outside!\"\n\"What, who's outside?\" he asks as she drags him away and through the airy house and out onto the back patio.\n\"Oh thank god,\" Stiles says in relief, seeing Vernon Boyd sitting out on a deck chair. He looks up as Stiles plops down in the seat next to him and Ally takes the one on the other side. \"I thought it was going to be just me and Allison.\"\n\"Nope,\" Boyd says, sounding weary. \"My mom's here.\"\n\"Sorry, dude,\" Stiles commiserates and Boyd looks him over for a second before he lifts his head and says \"I heard about you.\"\n\"Oh god,\" Stiles groans.\n\"You went and got yourself mated to a werewolf,\" Boyd says, smiling slowly. \"Only you, Stilinski.\"\n\"Shut up,\" he says. \"You want something? I'm gonna go grab drinks.\"\n\"Yeah, there's coke in the cooler,\" Boyd says.\n\"Ally?\" he wonders. \"Jack Daniels? Doesn't your dad--\"\n\"Just a coke,\" she says, shoving him away. She moves to sit close to Boyd, who goes to the school district over and has lots of stories that they haven't heard yet. She's asking him about his Technical Student Association group when Stiles ducks back in the sliding door.\nThe cooler's in the kitchen, which he can get to easily from the back patio as long as he skates along a corner. Most everyone else is out in the side yard where the grill is. He can smell charry meat and lighter fluid, hear their voices.\nIn the kitchen he grabs their drinks and a bowl of barbecue chips and heads back, thinking he was pretty sneaky getting in and out of there unseen but when he draws the slider open, Carson Argent is sitting out on the edge of Allison's chair, waiting for him.\nShe gives him an apologetic look as he walks out.\n\"Hey, Stiles,\" Carson says, grinning.\n\"Heyyyyy,\" Stiles says weakly, not sounding very excited to see him, though Carson can't seem to take a hint. Boyd does though. His brows shoot up and he looks at Carson speculatively.\n\"Boyd was just telling us about his new flash bomb prototype,\" Ally says as Stiles settles in his own chair.\n\"I don't see the use of something that can't incapacitate a Were,\" Carson says, frowning.\nBoyd shrugs. \"I didn't say it was for Weres, Argent. It's for Lamia. A few friends at Caltech were having issues a month ago.\"\nStiles laughs. \"Lamia? In Pasadena?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Boyd says and smiles. \"Maybe they're into technical fields. Gives me a lot to work on. The flash prototype was something we worked out long distance. I haven't seen it in action yet but it sounds like the first test went well.\"\nCarson looks almost annoyed when Stiles keeps asking Boyd questions. Boyd ends up fishing out his phone and scrolling through a list of emails so Stiles can see some of the blueprints.\n\"Who is this Reyes? They're funny,\" Stiles says, laughing. Boyd snatches the phone away, frowning. He looks at the email in question and scrolls, his face lighting up as he reads.\n\"It's just...Erica--\" Boyd says and looks up at Stiles and Allison, grinning at him. \"Whatever.\"\n\"Just Erica,\" Stiles teases. \"What--\"\nAnd that's when the slider door opens and Gerard Argent sticks his grumpy face out.\nAllison and Boyd go quiet. \"Genim, could you come in for a moment, please? It won't take long.\"\nStiles grimaces at his name being mangled in that sour old mouth. Boyd gives him a back pat as he gets up.\n\"Genim?\" Carson says, confused, following him in with Allison right behind.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are several Argent men and women standing around Gerard's office, along with Stiles' dad, who looks disgruntled about the whole thing.\n\"Is this even necessary??\" he asks, and Gerard says \"Of course it's necessary, he's mated to a goddamn werewolf, John.\"\nIt's a good thing Chris Argent is there, because he nips that old feud right in the bud, saying \"All right, enough. I didn't come here to listen to you two bicker. Just get on with it, dad.\"\n\"I just thought it would be beneficial if we told Genim his options,\" Gerard says, owling an eye at Stiles.\n\"What do you mean, options?\" Stiles' dad asks, skeptical.\n\"Well, did you know that there's actually no existing law that says you need to honor a werewolf claim?\"\nThe room falls quiet because while Gerard is technically right, there's also a lot he's not saying. Like how the law doesn't exist because werewolves rarely claim humans. How most claimings are done with everyone consenting and happy and of age. How when an underage werewolf claims, there are more things to consider. How Stiles was the one trespassing on Hale land. How Derek was in his wolf skin and without the resources and pack he needed to resist. How Stiles ran.\nHow werewolves suffer when their mates reject them.\nStiles' mouth falls open, a little stunned.\n\"--and Stiles, if it's the loneliness of unbonding that worries you, I feel certain that there can be other, satisfying bonds to be made,\" Gerard says with relish, and looks at Carson, who smiles at Stiles, chest puffing out.\n\"Oh god,\" Allison whispers to herself.\nStiles makes a long, groaning noise of misery, covers his hands over his face \"nooooooooooo--\"\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" John hisses. \"What are you even saying??\"\n\"Well,\" Gerard says, walking behind the couch. Stiles squirms to look over his shoulder, to keep an eye on him as he pauses behind Allison and ominously lays his hands on her shoulders. \"I'm sure other arrangements can be made.\"\nStiles lets out a squeaky \"What!?\"\nAllison's face goes wide open with shock and she says \"DAD!\"\nAnd her dad says \"DAD!\" and Gerard Agent raises his hands, palms up in defense. \"Everyone, quiet! Quiet!\"\n\"--so you're pimping out your grandkids now?\" Chris Argent growls and Gerard rolls his eyes.\n\"I'm just informing Mr. Stilinski of how serious we take his forced claiming. No one will be mating with any werewolves in this town, not against their will, not ever. We'll put that mongrel down before we let him--\"\nStiles jumps up then, heart thumping. \"Stop, enough. Just...stop.\" Gerard looks at him with all this open distaste and annoyance. Stiles rifles a hand through his hair and then says \"I'm going through with it. I...I want to.\"\n\"Stiles--\" Carson argues.\n\"No, it's my choice, ok? Like, thanks for...whatever that was. I can see your hearts were kind of in the right place, but lets just be honest here, that was really weird before. But yeah, thanks? I'll take the werewolf.\"\nGerard's mouth works, all frustrated. Chris tries to take his arm, but Gerard jerks away. \"you're making a mistake. How will they learn if we just give in to their demands??\"\n\"I don't know, man,\" Stiles sighs. \"I don't really care.\"\nHis dad gets up, gestures him out of the room. \"You'll be getting a call from me in the near future, Argent,\" his dad says sharply to Gerard.\nAs they're leaving, Stiles opens the patio door to say goodbye to Boyd. Boyd's mom is sitting out with him, so Stiles pauses to say hi and ask her how she's doing. He's always liked Boyd's mom. She smiles back at him, her smile widening when Stiles' dad ducks out and says an awkward hello to her too.\n\"You're leaving early,\" she says. \"Must have gone good in there.\"\nStiles' dad sighs, shaking his head. \"You bet.\"\n\"Gerard tried to pimp Allison out to me. So you know, time to go!\" Stiles says sarcastically.\nBoyd's face is all surprise for a second and then a laugh bubbles out \"Jesus.\"\n\"Well, we better head out before Gerard comes up with any more numb-skull ideas. Miriam, as always, a pleasure.\"\n\"You too, Sheriff. Good seeing you,\" she says. \"Night, Stiles.\"\nIn the car, Stiles smirks \"Could you flirt harder with Boyd's mom?\"\n\"Shut it,\" his dad mutters, cheeks flushed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up Saturday morning late, closer to lunch than breakfast and mopes around in his boxers and a tee shirt, eating cereal at the sink and flipping through a Vermont Country Store catalog.\nWhen his dad comes in, he mumbles \"Why do we get this old person catalog anyway?\"\nHis dad fills up a glass of water and looks, says \"Oh your gran got me something out of there one time and now they won't stop sending it.\"\nHe takes it out of Stiles' hand and throws it in the trash. Stiles makes a noise around his cereal, says \"I was looking at that!\"\n\"When are you going to be ready to go over to Hale house? This is pretty late in the day for you, kiddo.\"\nStiles shrugs and puts his milky bowl in the sink. He goes to leave the room and his dad says \"Stiles? Wait, do you not want to go today?\"\n\"Nah. I think. I think I'm gonna go hang out at Scott's. I'll be back tonight.\"\nHis dad's face is all lined with confusion, but Stiles really doesn't want to have to explain so he ducks out to take a shower.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey get In-n-Out and then sit around replaying BioShock Infinite until Scott rolls over on his bed and says \"Not that I don't appreciate it, but what the hell are you doing here anyway?\"\nStiles rolls his eyes.\nSo Scott makes a face and nudges the power button with his big toe.\n\"Augh, Scott!\" Stiles complains and throws down his controller.\n\"We don't have to talk about it, but. Just tell me you're ok,\" Scott says adamantly, face all concerned.\n\"Yes, I'm ok. I'm fine. We just needed a break,\" Stiles sighs and puts his sock foot to Scott's hip, shoves him away.\nScott doesn't seem 100% satisfied with the answer, but he lets Stiles monopolize his playstation for the rest of the day and then walks him home when the street lights come on.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt school on Monday, Allison finds him at his locker and says \"Sorry about granddad. And Carson. My dad gave them a piece of his mind when you left.\"\nStiles smiles tiredly. \"Sokay.\"\nShe hip-checks him fondly and wanders off, probably to look for Scott.\nHe runs into Lydia right after, groans \"Oh fuck, I forgot!\" about studying her notes.\nShe eyerolls his incompetence, says \"At least look it over before the quiz.\"\nHe gapes at her as she steps away \"WHAT QUIZ?!\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLacrosse is so much better, with Carson jolting away with a pained face whenever Stiles gets too close. He practically ducks out of his goal at one point, leaving a perfect opening for him. Stiles isn't sure what Chris Argent said to him, but whatever it was, it worked.\nAfter, he's tired and grass-stained and sweating under his gear and finds Jackson jogging to catch up to him as they walk off the field.\n\"So...\" Jackson says, nonchalant. \"What's Laura Hale like?\"\n\"Urgh, gross,\" Stiles complains. \"Also, Lydia is going to string you up by your balls, dude.\"\nJackson scoffs. \"Like I'm afraid of Lydia.\"\n\"I'll just tell her then, about this conversation?\" Stiles offers and Jackson's face twists into a scowl. He kicks a divot of grass at Stiles and stalks off towards Danny, who is waiting with his helmet in hand, frowning.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's got his chem homework spread out over the entire bed when his phone rings. He doesn't even bother to look, it's either Scott of Ally this time of night so he just answers with a \"What's up?\"\nThe phone is quiet for a second too long and then he hears someone clearing their throat. It's a rush of warmth up his spine. It collects at the bite mark on his nape, makes him feel it.\n\"Stiles?\" Derek starts, voice soft. Then he pauses like he's uncertain of what to say.\n\"Yeah, buddy. It's me,\" Stiles reassures him quickly.\nDerek makes a frustrated noise, says \"Are you ok?\"\nStiles frowns. \"Yeah? Why? Are you ok?\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Derek says, annoyance obvious.\n\"Oh, well good. Talk to you later--\" Stiles says sarcastically and Derek says \"Wait, Stiles--!\"\n\"What?\"\nDerek sighs, sounding petulant when he says \"You didn't come over this weekend.\"\nHe imagines it, Derek waiting around all Saturday. Hovering near the door. Sitting out on the porch and frowning hard at the road. Waiting until the sun goes down and the fireflies come out.\n\"Jesus,\" Stiles mutters. \"Derek. Dude. Your sister told me to give you breathing room so I stayed away. That's all. You were so upset about what happened--\"\n\"I was fine,\" Derek snaps.\n\"Dude, you ran away. It happened so fast, you were there and then you ran off--\"\nDerek is quiet, painfully so, so Stiles prompts \"You still there?\"\n\"Yes,\" he gets back, brusque and gruff.\n\"Do you want me to come over tonight?\"\nThere's a long pause and then Derek says \"On a school night?\"\n\"Yeah? I can come over for a little while.\"\nHe lets Derek stew on it, pulling on his sneakers in anticipation. And then Derek says \"Yes.\"\nStiles grins, \"be there in twenty,\" and hangs up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek waits on the steps as dad parks the car. His face is all serious, brow-heavy and rude-looking. Stiles grins and waves.\n\"There he is, Grumpygus Hale,\" his dad mutters.\n\"Dad, he can hear you,\" Stiles chastises and throws himself out of the car. His father gets out too, says \"I'm gonna go see if Jameson or Peter are watching the game. You got one hour, kiddo.\"\n\"Yes, dad,\" Stiles says and then yelps when Derek takes a hold of his elbow and starts dragging him towards the woods.\n\"One hour!\" his dad calls after them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's backed into a tree and there's nothing but the sound of Derek panting against his neck, scenting him. Stiles lets his eyes close in bliss, rests his head back loose, neck offered.\nAfter a while, he feels something sear his bared shoulder, inhales sharply when he realizes Derek's pressed a small, open-mouthed kiss there.\nThe inside of his mouth feels scorching.\n\"Who do you smell like?\" Derek asks him quietly. \"You smell like all these people I don't know. Not like pack anymore.\"\nStiles swallows, and the little kiss left on his neck goes cold as it dries. \"They're kind of my pack. Scott McCall. He's my best friend. And then Allison, Ally, Scott's girlfriend, my kind of other best friend?\"\nDerek nuzzles in, listening while he rubs his jaw like he's rubbing their scent off of him.\n\"Then,\" Stiles chokes at the ticklishness of it. \"Lydia. She's Ally's friend and she started hanging around a little after she heard about you.\"\nDerek pulls back, frowning, looking him over. \"She didn't think I was cool and then she found out that I was werewolf claimed so now...she thinks I'm cool?\"\nDerek snorts, displeased. It makes Stiles soften a little, slump against the tree. Derek ducks back in and his breath is hot and quick as he smells him again.\n\"Then the lacrosse team. Probably. You can probably smell Danny's aftershave because he took me down so many times yesterday--\"\nDerek growls in his chest, a nightmarish kind of sound in the darkening woods. Stiles huffs out a breath at it, lungs emptied.\nDerek pulls away. \"You smell like Argents,\" he says roughly.\n\"Ally is an Argent,\" Stiles admits and Derek's nostrils flare a little. \"But a good one! She thinks her granddad is as fucked up as we do.\"\nDerek looks him over for a hard moment before he faceplants into Stiles' throat again, stroking with his cheek. Stiles sighs, drifts back into the tree.\nAfter a long while, when Derek seems to slow his motions down so they're more self-soothing than effective, he mumbles \"I'm sorry I hurt you.\"\n\"You didn't really hurt me. It was worse that you ran away,\" Stiles tells him gently.\n\"I know,\" Derek says. \"Mom told me.\"\nStiles rolls his eyes fondly.\n\"I don't want to hurt you, but I want to--\" Derek looks up, and his eyes just drift down to Stiles' mouth, stare blankly, a little lost. \"I want to--\"\n\"Yeah?\" Stiles breathes. \"Like this?\" and he puts a soft, little kiss to Derek's mouth.\nDerek's eyes widen for a half-second before they slowly close in pleasure, going hazy for a second before they're lidded and he's swaying there, well after Stiles' has pulled away and is just watching him.\nThen he's caging Stiles in, backing him firmly into the tree and putting their foreheads together. They breathe like that, until Derek finally gives a short sigh and kisses him again, a small kiss too, testing.\nStiles tries to open against it but Derek jerks away, catching his breath. He opens his eyes and they're all glassy and limned with gold, like the wolf is stalking the edges of his control.\nStiles slowly, carefully drapes his arms around Derek's shoulders, closes a hand over his warm nape and tries to draw him back to his mouth. He meets him with pliant lips, all parted and receptive.\nThe kiss is still sweet, syrup-slow, but then, like they're both working on instinct, their tongues meet, and Stiles groans into the sudden scorch of it.\nHe pops off the kiss with a noisy breath, runs his wrist down between his legs, wincing a little as he readjusts.\nDerek follows the motion, eyebrows going soft and expressive. Then his eyes trail up and he looks at Stiles dazedly, hungry. His pupils all glassy and dark.\n\"Derek--\" Stiles breathes and they're fumbling into another kiss, Derek whimpering low around his tongue.\nDerek can't keep focused, keeps trailing his mouth down Stiles' jaw like he wants to kiss him everywhere. Stiles finds our how sensitive his ear is when Derek wraps the lobe up in his agile tongue, tugs it gently.\nHe ends up ripping Stiles' collar a little as he tries to taste, to suck at Stiles' shoulder, mouth hot and eager.\n\"Yes, oh my god,\" Stiles whines, hips jerking helplessly as he's bruised up in Derek's mouth.\nDerek's hand gropes his hip, too rough, squeezes twice then shakily feels between his legs, finding him. Stiles fingers dig sharp in Derek's upper arm as Derek learns the length of his cock, pets it with his fingertips.\nDerek pants out ragged breaths, starts rubbing at him through his clothes, making Stiles grunt, hips flexing up for more, meeting that touch.\nAnd then Derek's lifting his head away, his hands, eyes wide.\n\"What is it--?\" Stiles asks, and Talia Hale, way too nearby, calls \"Stiles, it's time for you to go home now! Your father is waiting.\"\nStiles drops his face into Derek's shoulder, hand cupping himself between the legs and squeezing sharply to stave off the frustration.\nDerek lets out a little whimper, snuffles at Stiles' hair, right behind his ear, drinking up the scent of him before they have to get moving.\n\"I want to get to know you,\" Stiles breathes like it's dirty talk and Derek looks pained, his fat bottom lip sucked into his mouth. They tumble out of the woods holding hands, and it's obvious what they've been doing, Stiles' shirt collar askew and ripped, Derek's mouth lush and reddened and his hair messy.\nStiles' dad rolls his eyes dramatically at their exit. Alpha Hale gives her son a look that makes Derek reach out hastily and recenter Stiles' collar.\n\"I'm gonna call you,\" Stiles says adamantly, before he lets Derek's hand go. \"Ok?\"\nDerek's actually blushing, looking away. \"Yeah? Ok,\" Stiles repeats, leans up quickly to put a kiss on Derek's cheek before he saunters to get into his dad's car.\nHis dad sighs and gets in too, looks over at him, unimpressed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe calls Wednesday night after lacrosse practice and a shower. He tugs on some pajama bottoms and crawls into bed, dials Derek's number and waits, heart beating out of his chest.\n\"Hello?\" Derek says.\n\"Hey,\" Stiles grins into the phone. \"Can you talk for a bit?\"\n\"Yeah?\" Derek says like he's not sure, and then there's the sound of a door closing.\n\"Derek, I just. Uh. How was your day?\" Stiles gets out, slapping his forehead with how dorky he sounds.\n\"Good,\" Derek says. Stiles pauses and waits for more but there's nothing more forthcoming so he lets out a strangled groan and says \"Come on, man, give me something to work with.\"\n\"Oh,\" Derek says, \"it uhhh--\"\nStiles takes pity on him, flips over onto his back and says \"I've got my first lacrosse game tomorrow.\"\n\"Against who?\" Derek asks intently, sounding interested.\n\"La Puente. I know they've got Addison this year--\"\n\"They're going to destroy you,\" Derek interrupts, laughing.\nStiles gasps. \"Woah, what the hell--\"\n\"So you've got Danny Mahealani on goal with Hess this year and Whittemore as your left attack and Argent as your 3rd, you guys are going to get creamed.\"\nStiles mouth hangs open and then he lets out a little defensive cry \"And me and Scott, dude!\"\nDerek keeps chuckling warmly and though he's probably not wrong (Beacon Hills hasn't won a playoff for like, 5 years), Stiles keeps up the ruse of being offended just to hear that laugh get deeper and more relaxed.\nRight before he gets off the phone, he pauses and says \"I really liked that thing in the woods,\" then blushes.\nDerek huffs out a breath, says \"Me too.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Stiles chews at his lip. \"Can we do that again sometime? Soon?\"\nAnd then Derek growls \"Laura,\" and Stiles sighs, says \"We'll talk about it later.\"\nHe says good night to Derek's growling, frustrated \"Laura, stop laughing!\" before he hangs up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe enjoys the first part of a lacrosse game, when they all meet on the field. That's usually the best part for him.\nWhen that part's over, he slaps Scott on the butt in support and then goes to sit on the bench, which he'll warm to perfection.\nWaiting for him on the empty bench is Ally, who waves at Scott excitedly. And then...oh great.\n\"Hey gorgeous,\" Allison's evil Aunt Kate says, winking at him.\nAllison smiles at Stiles, who groans dramatically and says \"Wow, it's Aunt Kate. How's socal?\"\nShe shrugs, eyes glittering at him. When he goes to sit down on the other side of Ally with his gatorade, Kate gets up and moves to sit next to him. \"A little bird told me that you went and got yourself a werewolf plaything,\" she says, voice smoky and amused.\nStiles rolls his eyes and Allison looks apologetic, like she forgot what a bad idea it was to get him and Aunt Kate together.\nHe snorts. \"It's not like that. God, do you have to make everything sound so creepy and suggestive?\"\nShe grins at him. \"What's it like, then?\"\n\"It's...serious, ok?\" he says and knows that he sounds like a petulant kid, getting annoyed with her.\n\"Ok, well excuse me,\" she says, holding up her hands. He rolls his eyes. \"So who'd you lock down, little Cora Hale?\"\nHe makes a face. \"She's like, 13.\"\n\"Surely not Laura Hale?\" she says in disbelief.\n\"No! Not...just. Derek, ok?\" Stiles says, blushing helplessly. There's a loud crack of rib pads knocking together on the field and Stiles is distracted for a minute, watching Jackson take a dude from La Puente down. When he looks back, Kate's eyebrows are high, her expression all surprise. And then she barks out a laugh, has to wipe her eyes after. \"Oh god, so you're the new person that kid is making eyes at? What a little lothario. Did he offer you the bite too?\"\nStiles gawks at her helplessly. \"What?\"\n\"Kate,\" Allison says, frowning, uncomfortable.\n\"He offered it to me once, but of course I said no. It's not that he's a bad guy, he's just so young and earnest and probably in love with being in love. He thought he was in love with me and kept trying to get me out in the woods with him. I'm not even sure he'd have known what to do, if I let him claim me.\" She grins at him and Stiles reaches back, palms anxiously at his claiming mark.\nThe smile falls off her face, aware. \"Stiles, did you let him do it??\"\nStiles washes hot, feels like he can't breathe for a second.\n\"Oh, sweetie baby,\" she pats his knee. \"...maybe it'll be different for you?\"\nStiles moves away from her, breathing noisily, chest aching.\n\"Stiles?\" Allison tries to stop him but he lurches to his feet. \"Stiles, you're getting panicky.\"\nHe ducks his head down near his knees, tries to breathe. Can't breathe.\n\"Stiles??\" Kate says, distantly.\nHe feels Allison rubbing his back, sees black spots in the field lights. He's ashamed when he comes back and finds the game paused, the away team watching with their helmets in hand, standing awkwardly around, waiting.\n\"Shit,\" he whines. It's been a while.\n\"You ok? Stiles?\" Scott asks, concerned. \"It's just a panic attack!\" Scott yells at coach. Which is just loud and great.\n\"Come on, Stiles. Breathe,\" Ally whispers.\n\"I need you to bring me to Derek's. I need to ask him,\" he says hoarsely, once he can breathe. She looks grim. \"Please.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" she asks.\n\"Yes, please Ally. I can't walk there--\"\nShe nods sharply then, starts guiding him away. Scott follows them to the edge of the field and then he has to go back, presses a quick kiss to Allison's lips before he leaves, strokes his palm down Stiles' back.\nIn the car, Ally turns to him nervously, says \"You can't trust Kate.\"\n\"I know,\" he says, slumped in his seat, heart in his throat. \"That's why I have to ask him.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDerek looks confused and anxious when Stiles clambers up the porch steps in his gear. His face is all twisted up and he stutters out \"Stiles, w-what. What--?\"\n\"Kate Argent,\" Stiles says point blank and watches the confusion fall right off his face, replaced with knowing.\nIt makes something lurch inside him and he feels like, yeah. That's all he needed to know.\n\"Fuck I'm so stupid,\" he grits through his teeth and turns to stumble back down the steps and away from him.\n\"No, wait!\" Derek follows, upset. \"It's not like that!\"\n\"Did you offer her the bite? Do you just...go around wanting to bite people?\" Stiles asks angrily.\nDerek looks taken aback. \"No, of course not!\"\n\"Did you, though? Offer her the bite?\" he tries again, jaw so tight it hurts. His hands in fists.\nDerek looks away, unhappy. And then he says \"Yes,\" like he regrets having to.\n\"I just...\" Stiles feels so lost. And worse, his face is getting all hot and blotchy like he might cry. \"Kate Argent, really?\"\nDerek goes to speak but Stiles interrupts \"So, Kate said no and you what, found my picture and decided I was your mate now?\"\nDerek stares at him, eyebrows drawn together. But he doesn't say anything.\n\"How did you know it was me and not her? Why did you--\"\nDerek shakes his head slowly, confused \"What picture, Stiles?\"\nStiles makes a face. \"You have a picture of me! From my yearbook...I saw it that night of the bonfire--\"\n\"Cora found it at the library,\" Derek says quickly, \"after I claimed you. She brought it home to tease me with it. So I shoved it in my book--\" Eyes cast down, he looks ashamed of himself.\nStiles lets out a harsh breath, feeling all sickly hot inside, horrified that he would think he could be so special.\n\"Why did you bite me then?\" he asks, lost.\n\"Because you--\" Derek starts but looks uncertain, like the words won't come, like he can't think of what to say. \"Because you...smelled good.\"\nStiles nods at that, mouth agape. \"Oh.\"\nThen he turns around and goes for the car door.\nDerek's hot at his back in a heartbeat, holding his hand away from the door handle, whispering \"No no no no no, please Stiles.\"\n\"Jesus get off me,\" Stiles grits, trying to shake him off. Derek holds on a beat too long so Stiles snarls \"What are you going to do, force me?\"\nDerek rips away from him then, face full of horror.\nStiles swallows and slips into the car, slams the door.\n\"Come on, go,\" he whispers when Ally just sits there, goggling at him. \"Please Ally.\"\nSo she starts the car and backs it up. Her headlights swing, light up Derek, whose standing there with his shoulders hunched, his hands in claws. Half-wolfed out.\nStiles slouches deep into his seat and bites his lip hard so he doesn't cry. Relaxes into it when she reaches over and smooths his hair off his forehead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Do you want me to come up?\" she asks when she drops him off.\n\"No,\" he says, and smiles weakly. \"I'm just gonna crash.\"\nShe looks worried. \"Do you want me to tell Scott to come over?\"\nHe shakes his head. \"Nah, go. Have fun. I bet he's waiting up for you.\"\nShe smiles a little and says \"I'll call you in the morning though?\"\n\"Yep,\" he agrees. \"Thanks, Ally.\"\n\"Love you,\" she tells him before he closes the door.\n\"Love you,\" he says back and waves as she pulls out of the drive way.\nHis dad is working second shift so the house is quiet and dark. He turns on the porch light so dad won't stumble when he gets home before dawn.\nThen he goes right upstairs, rips off his pads and falls into bed face first.\nHe wakes up at one point in the night and his bite mark itches, the skin feeling tight and stinging. He wants to claw it off. He ends up punching himself awkwardly there and then laughing soundlessly at how stupid he is before he falls back asleep again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up and calls Scott. Then he hangs up and calls Ally. They're still talking when Scott shows up with doughnuts. He kicks off his sneakers and crawls into Stiles bed and they eat doughnuts together, the phone between them, listening to Ally talk.\nAfter a while, she hangs up so she can come over too and eat the last bear claw.\nThey're kind of having a thing so Lydia ends up stopping by after lunch, looking like she's been awake and productive for several hours. It's almost exhausting looking at her, so Stiles buries his face against Scott's shoulder.\nHe mopes the whole day away, still in his pajamas by the time his dad gets up, takes one look at him and sighs.\n\"I'm pretty sure this means we're getting hamburgers for dinner,\" he tells Stiles dryly and Stiles doesn't argue.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter a week of moping in silence, he reveals just how bad it's gotten when he asks Allison \"Carson's probably a good guy, right? I mean, he's probably easygoing?\"\nShe looks at him, openly distressed. \"Oh Stiles, what the hell.\"\nShe actually misses the rest of school, drags him out to her car and drives him for ice cream cones. He just stares at his dipped chocolate cone miserably so she makes an angry noise at herself and takes it out of his hand, throws it in a trash can.\nAnd then she drives him back to her house and breaks out the bourbon.\n\"Don't you dare tell my mom,\" she says and starts pouring shots.\nAfter three, he gets sobby and dramatic and drapes himself over the couch, an arm flung over his eyes. \"I hate him. What a big jerk. What a big, big, handsome asshole.\"\n\"Stiles,\" she says maternally, and then hiccups, ruining the effect. \"Maybe you should talk to him.\"\nHe scoffs. \"Derek doesn't talk, Ally. He just sort of represses himself at you.\"\n\"Than maybe...maybe there are things that still need to be said?\" she tries. And when he lifts off his arm to scowl at her, she shrugs and drinks.\n\"Can we talk about Scott too, if we're doing this hang out and drink about boys thing?\"\nHe sits up quickly, worried. \"What? Yes? What is it? Is everything ok?\"\nShe smiles. \"Yeah, it's just...can I complain about one little thing, just between us?\"\n\"Yes, of course,\" he tells her encouragingly \"What?\"\n\"He. He just kisses sometimes like blah,\" she lets her tongue rest out on her lip, loose and unresponsive.\nStiles snorts when he laughs at her. She slaps his leg.\n\"I don't know what to do with that? Like, does he want me to...to kiss it? Or?\"\nStiles groans, laughing. \"Poor Scott! Dude, you have to teach him. You're his first girlfriend! He's completely untested.\"\n\"I know, I know,\" she says, smiling.\nHe sobers up a little, suddenly thinking about kissing Derek, how good it felt. He drops his head back again, dizzy.\n\"Talk to him,\" she says softly, knowing.\nHe makes a face at her and rolls into the couch so she can't see his lip tremble.\nLater on, they do some drunk target shooting with her dad's crossbow, which isn't their brightest plan ever. One arrow gets lodged in the exposed ceiling beam and they can't get it out by tossing throw pillows at it or waving the broom handle drunkenly. He makes sure to get the fuck out of dodge before Victoria gets home for dinner.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe's still drunk when his phone trills, drifting into his pillow and listening to it chirp at his ear.\n\"Stiles--\" Derek says when he answers, voice fraught.\n\"Listen,\" Stiles mutters. \"Just listen.\" But he can't think of anything to say, so he just breathes for a while and Derek is content with that. Finally he sighs and says \"I feel stupid.\"\n\"Don't, don't feel stupid, Stiles. I should have explained--\"\n\"No,\" Stiles moans. \"I got really drunk. We shot an arrow in the ceiling and I don't think she can get it out. Chris Argent is going to be so pissed.\"\nDerek goes quiet and just listens again. So Stiles breathes, nose congested.\n\"I liked you so much,\" Stiles whispers.\nDerek lets out a low, whining sound. It's so sad and pathetic, it makes Stiles chest hurt. He rubs his nose on his sleeve and then takes his shirt off. \"Will you come over?\" he asks.\nDerek pauses before answering, and then says \"Yeah, I'll. I'll be right there.\"\n\"You need directions?\"\n\"No, I can find you,\" Derek says, and hangs up.\nStiles closes his phone and falls asleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up a few hours later to Ally's frantic face in his face. She's shaking him.\n\"What? What is it?\" he mutters.\n\"They got Derek. He crossed the town-line. Stiles, this is serious we need to go.\"\nIf she punched him in the face, it would have been less jarring. Eyes wide, he stumbles out of bed looking for a shirt.\n\"What, why--??\" he starts and then gasps \"Oh fuck, I told him to. I was drunk and told him to come and he fucking did it.\"\n\"My granddad is talking about putting him down,\" she says, throwing him his jacket.\n\"What!? He's not a threat to anyone! They can't--\" Stiles argues.\n\"He gave you the claiming bite without your consent. And then he crossed the town-line and broke treaty. Stiles, it's not good. They've put Weres down for less.\"\n\"Shit shit shit shit,\" he says, shoving his feet into his shoes. \"My dad--\"\n\"He's already there. With my dad. They're keeping everyone calm. But you need to come. Deaton is on his way to pass judgment.\"\nStiles grimaces, jumps up and follows her down the stairs and out to the car.\n\"Shit Ally, I don't want to put you in a shitty position, but if we have to--\"\nShe jerks open a bag at his feet and a small crossbow is there, several other weapon-y things he's never seen before but assumes she wields like Xena Warrior Princess when she needs to.\nHe sighs, relieved. \"No one is taking Derek, ok?\" she tells him sharply. \"Not without a fight.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe compound is lit up like it's Christmas. It's basically hunter Christmas. They shove into the crowd and there are people sharing drinks, chatting, laughing. A man in a black sweater with a rifle over his back is skyping on a laptop excitedly.\nWith her brow raised and her bag on her shoulder, Allison makes a path through the crowd while Stiles follows.\nBoyd meets them in the hall, looking morose. \"I'm with you. My mom and I, we're here and we'll take your side if you need it,\" he tells her.\nShe sighs in relief and hugs him. He hugs her back loosely and a tall, ridiculously attractive blonde steps up and says \"Hey, so some narc with a cobra tattoo just slapped my ass, can we kill him first?\"\nBoyd looks at Stiles and says \"This is Erica. Reyes.\"\nStiles starts to light up so Boyd says \"Don't even, Stilinski.\"\n\"Jesus, Stiles, get in here!\" his dad hisses from behind them. He's looking out of Gerard Argent's office, face all stressed.\nThey shuffle in in a line and Stiles gasps when he sees Derek, slumped, tied to a big chair that Allison's always called \"The torture chair\" because it's made out of solid mountain ash.\nStiles goes on his knees in front of him, cupping Derek's face in his hands while the men bark at him to back up.\nHe sees why they're freaking out a second later, Derek's face all twisted up with the beta wolf, canines sharp in his mouth, eyes glowing. He growls low in his chest, a warning.\n\"Fuck, he's hurt! He's like this because he can't switch back until he's away from the ash!\"\n\"Get up! Get him up!\" Gerard says angrily, swatting at Stiles with his cane. Stiles ducks and there's a commotion as his father steps in front of Gerard with his hand perched on his holstered gun and says \"You touch my son one more time--\"\n\"He's going to get hurt, John! We let this go on long enough. We turned a blind eye after Genim was bit when we should have put the dog down for misbehaving. And now he's breaking treaty--\"\n\"I told him to!\" Stiles says, voice cracking. \"I told him to come. I was drunk. Dad, it's my fault. I was drinking and I made a mistake.\"\nHis dad stares at him hard, his mouth a thin line. \"I fucked up but it wasn't like he was coming to like, make mischief on the women. He was coming because I stupidly asked him to and we're mated. He can't...not come when I call him. That's what mating is.\"\nEveryone's quiet for a moment in thought and then Chris Argent says \"He's right.\"\n\"Oh not you too!\" Gerard wails theatrically.\n\"E tu, Chris?\" Stiles says impulsively and the wolf in front of him chuckles. Stiles looks up at him, surprised and Derek is fighting a smile, eyes all lined with care and humor. Stiles grins back.\n\"He's laughing!\" Gerard wails.\n\"He's right, dad. If Stiles asked him to come, Derek couldn't refuse him. It's instinct. If anyone is at fault, it's us for not explaining to Stiles what our expectations were with the treaty,\" Chris says.\n\"Bullshit,\" Gerard growls. \"We have no precedent for this, no special rule. The rule is the same for all werewolves, no matter who they're mated to.\"\n\"You know, this is basically the definition of precedent, right? This is exactly what precedent is,\" Stiles backtalks, which gets him a stern \"Stiles,\" from his dad.\n\"Deaton will decide,\" Chris says finally. And he gives Stiles a little look of commiseration. \"We have to wait and see.\"\nStiles nods but then glances at Allison, who is standing with her bag at her feet, watching, pokerfaced.\nThey know the moment Deaton arrives because four separate Argent cousins comes in excitedly to report it.\n\"Yes,\" Chris sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, \"we know.\"\nDeaton's followed by Scott, who works with him at the vet's office and who grins and waves at Ally when he comes in. Chris frowns at him.\nScott was never quite as popular with the rest of the other Argents as he was with Allison.\nDeaton takes one look at the whole tableaux of them, hunters and tortured werewolf and says \"Allison, your arsenal is unnecessary,\" and Stiles lets out a big whoop of relief, because that could only mean one thing.\nChris looks at his daughter, and then at the bag at her feet and says \"Allison--\"\nShe shrugs, arms crossed over her chest. And then slouches into Scott's shoulder when he, still grinning, goes to wrap his arm around her.\n\"This is outrageous! He crossed a boundary line! He broke treaty!\" Gerard bellows.\nDeaton begins to untie Derek, hands careful. \"And his mate has come to claim him,\" he says, inspecting the knots. \"Stiles? Do you claim your mate?\"\nStiles groans out \"Yes.\"\nDerek whines in his throat then, squirming.\n\"But the treaty!\" Gerard argues.\n\"Werewolf claiming is a much older law than your treaty,\" Deaton says.The ropes seem to melt off once he's got one knot untied. Stiles rushes to help draw Derek off the chair, down onto the floor away from it.\nStile soothes at Derek's head, watching the wolf come back to himself. His canines slip away, his eyes change, back to their pale green. He looks at Stiles for a long, endless moment, eyes fixed.\n\"Sorry,\" Stiles says, petting his hair. \"I fucked up.\"\n\"Sokay,\" Derek says, voice throaty. \"Me too.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Can I take the car? I gotta get him home,\" Stiles asks his dad, voice low.\n\"Stiles--\" his dad says, unimpressed.\n\"Please. I really need to face them after that. They're pack, dad.\"\nHis dad frowns and runs a hand over his face. \"Fine, but we're still going to have words about your underage drinking, Stiles, what the hell were you thinking?\"\nHe nods. \"Yes, of course. I know.\"\n\"Are you sober?\" his dad asks, serious.\n\"Yes, I promise. That was like, 6 hours ago.\"\nHis dad sighs \"Be back before sunrise, kiddo.\"\n\"Definitely,\" he agrees and his dad tosses him his keys.\nDerek is shaking hands with Deaton in the hallway, and then with Boyd and his mother, saying shy hellos.\n\"Woah, kid, you bagged a hottie,\" Erica tells him in approval and Derek freezes, blinking.\n\"Yep!\" Stiles agrees, \"but now it's time to get this hottie home to his mama. Who might rip my throat out with her teeth, who can know?\"\nDerek looks at him with a tight frown.\nHe makes sure to give Ally a hug before they set off. \"Thank you. Thank you. You are a goddess. You are Artemis, my goddess of kickass.\"\nShe grins, showing off her dimples which makes Scott coo and snuggle into her.\n\"Ok, come on my werewolf mate, lets get you the fuck back to your Alpha.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey drive in silence for a while, and then Derek clears his throat, looking uncomfortable, but starts talking.\nStiles listens.\n\"When I was 12, I didn't know a lot of other people outside of the pack. I was in the middle, not alpha material like Laura, not the baby. Just Derek. One time I got tipsy on wolfsbane and forgot to put on my wolf skin when we went howling at the moon and everyone's always remembered that--\"\n\"--wait, were you buckass naked, howling at the moon?\"\nDerek looks at him, hard.\n\"Yeah, ok go on.\"\nDerek sighs.\n\"People kind of start having this perception of who you are. They remember stories about you. Mostly not good stories. They see who your mom is, your sister. They start to think that's all you are in the world. You feel like, that's your place in the pack. That's all you can be.\"\nStiles listens, frowning a little.\n\"When I met Kate Argent, I was 15 and lonely and she was so...confident and outspoken and she seemed important and she paid attention to me.\" He lets out a hard breath. \"I don't know, I thought she liked me. She teased me. Not...not like that, but like a person teases a pet, or a dog. I got really attached to how she made me feel. Special, mostly.\"\nThey make eye contact across the car before Stiles has to look where he's driving again. He reaches over though, to squeeze Derek's knee.\n\"I asked her to take the bite from me and she laughed. She laughed and petted me and told me I was cute but that women like her needed men, not werewolf cubs.\"\nStiles curls his lip at that.\n\"I kind of...disappeared into myself for a long while. It's why I'm so, so bad at this.\"\nHe takes a deep breath.\n\"Then I smelled you in the woods.\"\nStiles snorts.\n\"Stiles,\" Derek says softly. \"You smell so good to me. I never knew it would be like that. They said I'd know, that my wolf would tell me, but I didn't know how strong it would feel, how I could barely unlock my teeth from your neck because you smelled like you belonged to me.\"\nStiles' mouth falls open on a sharp breath.\n\"I want to be with you all the time. I want to rub your scent all over me. I think about you all the time. I'm not doing great in school. I am completely useless on the lacrosse field. Laura teases me because I forget to do stuff. I walk into doors when I hear your car on the road, I leave the milk out because I'm daydreaming about you napping on the porch swing, I sleep in too late and miss pack meetings because I stayed up all night worrying if you even like me, or if it's just a big obligation to you.\"\nStiles gapes at him, stunned.\nDerek's brows are all collapsed together, frustrated. \"Don't you get it? I didn't know you before that night in the woods, but the wolf brought me to you and I can't stop...every time you come over, it's hard to believe that you're coming to see me, that you're trying to be with me, even though you can't smell what I do, can't scent the way we are together.\"\nThey're almost to the house so Stiles pulls off the road and parks. Covers his hands over his eyes and groans \"I'm such a dumbass, fuck, Stiles, way to almost beef it up, seriously.\"\nThey're quiet, just the breathing night around them.\nThen Derek suddenly perks, listening. \"They're coming,\" he says.\n\"Go,\" Stiles prompts. \"They're probably worried sick about you. I'll be right behind you, buddy.\"\nSo Derek clatters the door open, gets out into the dark.\nStiles watches him, how he walks purposely into the field, taking off his shirt as he goes. Then his jeans, which means Stiles gets a nice look at his ripe ass in the moonlight, sighs.\nAnd then he's bounding off in his wolf skin, towards the woods where there are howls now, long and heartbroken.\nHe puts the car back in drive and finishes the trip up to the homestead, parks on the grass and then goes up to wait on the porch.\nPeter comes out of the house a while later, sits beside him.\n\"I'm going to say it once,\" Peter says quietly. \"But if you ever hurt him, Stiles, I'll make you suffer for it.\"\nStiles swallows. \"Hurt him like...what happened today?\"\nPeter snorts, lies back on the wood. \"That was mostly Argent's fault. That guy is a menace.\"\n\"Tell me about it,\" Stiles agrees, and lies beside him.\n\"I mean, if you do what Kate Argent did to him,\" Peter clarifies.\nStiles sighs in relief. \"Yeah, gotcha. No gutting him and emasculating him until he's a shadow of his former self. Not a problem.\"\nPeter smiles then, and he's back to being the kind uncle Stiles' used to.\nHe falls asleep waiting for Derek, wakes up being carried upstairs like a kid, warm and close. He nuzzles in and gets beard burn on his cheek, yawns \"Derek.\"\nDerek's chest rumbles and then they're in a room that smells like Derek, like his lacrosse shirt and his sweat and his hair and Stiles wants to tell him he's wrong about Stiles not getting it, because he fucking loves that smell.\nIt's rich in the blankets when Derek sets him down, so Stiles rolls into them, presses his nose in and breathes deeply.\nThen he moans, way too loud when he feels Derek's heavy warmth at his back.\n\"Shhhhhhhhhhh,\" Derek hushes. \"Jesus.\"\n\"Feel so good though,\" Stiles says low, arching, thriving in it.\n\"They can hear you,\" Derek tells him quietly.\n\"Shhhhhh,\" Stiles hushes back, looking around at him. Derek huffs, going pink under his beard. It stains his cheeks, his ears. Stiles settles back into the cup of Derek's hips and they both let out held breathes at how good he fits.\nHe rolls his ass once to get comfortable and gets his hip fisted up.\nTongue pressed to his teeth, Stiles cats his hips in a tight circle to test him and Derek shudders and tries to still him, hand firm.\n\"Stiles,\" he whines. Then he goes sharply still and growls out \"Stop listening!\"\nHe lifts up away from Stiles, holding him down with that hand to his hip and glares at the far wall. After a second, he rolls his eyes and hisses \"Well, go to bed then!\"\n\"Are you talking to Laura?\" Stiles wonders.\nSuddenly Derek's eyes widen and he jerks down into bed, says \"Yes, mom.\"\nStiles barks out a laugh and gets his mouth clapped under Derek's palm.\n\"Please. Go to sleep,\" Derek begs in his ear.\nWhich makes Stiles sigh, snuggle back and close his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe wakes up feeling this strange euphoria. This rested, warm belonging.\nThe morning is slow-moving, skin against skin, Derek's hand under his shirt, hot and holding his abdomen. Derek's cold feet tucked against his.\nA drip of sweat tickles the back of his neck. He rustles the blankets and slips out from under Derek's arm, sits on the edge of the bed and just breathes them in.\nThere's something under his skin, wanting him to move.\nHe puts on his sneakers in a daze, watching Derek. The sun is just creeping fingers over the house, smoothing away the night. It's chilly still and misty when Stiles walks out onto the porch.\nHe takes deep lungfuls of the cool air, stretches a little. Heart strong in his chest, he takes the porch steps into the yard, ducks around the sleeping house and out into the back field.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe walks past the rocky brook and the rabbit's warren, past the high hill where the pack has their picnics. He walks until the field grass blends into thicket and then becomes the beginning of the woods.\nHe takes a path into the woods that he's walked with Derek before, a narrow foot-worn path that the Weres tread on full moons. He starts to jog then, heart quickening. He sucks on his bottom lip as he keeps a steady beat, listening to the morning around him.\nSomewhere, far behind him, there's a single, echoing howl.\nHe dashes then, heart racing, pushing himself until his muscles start to burn in his legs, his chest. The green of the woods is starting to bleed into red, the trees changing colors. The impact of his feet on the ground makes the woods seem to jolt, jerk around him.\nHe makes it a good hunt, scrambles up a hill at one point and hears the growl behind him, the thump of feet.\nHe throws himself over the other side of the hill, hissing as he rolls through some brambles, prickles clawing at his arms, blood pricking on his elbow. And then he's smothered under the wolf, breath knocked right out of his chest.\nGasping, he looks up and Derek's face is in beta shift, canines bared, mouth snarled up in frustration.\nThey struggle against each other, Stiles squirming to shove his pants down, off, Derek trying to grab his wrists, to hold them and pin them.\nStiles gets his pants shoved halfway down his thighs and then he's caught, forced to be still, bony wrists held tight in one of Derek's fists.\nHe freezes when Derek ducks in, breath harsh and panting in Stiles' face, the Were scenting him, running his nose along Stiles' throat. Stiles bares it freely, makes Derek whine.\n\"Mate me,\" Stiles hisses and Derek's eyes slipt closed in pain, his hips moving helplessly at the demand, bucking.\nStiles strains against the hold on him, lifts his head and breathes \"I know you need to claim me. Put your smell inside me--\"\nDerek's jaw clenches and his body starts to tremble like barely repressed action, pulse a frantic flutter in Derek's strained throat. Stiles can see it, tries to arch to get his mouth on it but Derek's holding him down.\nInstead, he groans \"Please. Fuck, Derek. Claim me--\"\nHe ends up face-first in the dirt again, the wolf at his back and this time it's good, so good, he grinds himself into the ground, eyes flickering shut in bliss when Derek snarls and tears his loose jeans and underwear down to his ankles.\nThere's panting breath behind him and then teeth, fucking teeth snapping at his bitten nape and he cries out for it, reaches back to fist Derek's ear, hold him there, needing him there.\n\"Stiles,\" Derek says brokenly when he finally pulls off. \"I don't want to hurt you--\"\n\"Just a little, just a little bit,\" Stiles begs, lifting his ass, offering.\nDerek groans, dirty and low, and there's a jangle of his belt opening, the burr of his fly being parted. And then fever-hot skin pressed against him.\nHis own cock twitches and drips at the feeling, his mouth gone loose and breathless. Derek starts shivering harder, hips giving these little, sharp flexes like he can't control his instinct to fuck Stiles, to mate him.\n\"Stroke yourself,\" Stiles whispers and Derek gives this throaty groan \"Stiles,\" and puts a hand between Stiles' shoulders, pins him in place.\nIt's just their quick breath and this movement, this frenzied movement behind him, shaking them and then Stiles can hear the skin-slick sound, the spank of it, of Derek masturbating, and he arches against Derek's hold, lifts his ass to him.\n\"Oh god,\" Derek breathes.\n\"Mark me inside. Just a little--\" Stiles begs, trying to get on his knees.\nDerek pants noisily and Stiles feels the blunt head of his cock nudge along the seam of his ass, press right at him where he's sleek and hot and receptive.\n\"Please, just a little--\" Stiles begs and then cries out long and wounded when Derek starts pressing his tight little ass apart, just the very rim, a wide, sharp stretch.\nA hand finds his nape, clamps there, searing the mark as Stiles whines, ass just barely breached, opened up enough to hurt but not enough to make him claw away.\nHe goes pliant under Derek's hand, listening as Derek starts to stroke off again, the frantic beat of it catching in his ass where Derek's cockhead jolts and hardens in him, thickens.\n\"Yes, fuck. Mark me,\" Stiles breathes harshly and Derek's body steels up over him, goes still and sharp everywhere and Stiles lets out a long, relieved moan when he feels the rush of fine shivers, the muscles twitching all over Derek's body as wet warmth soothes him inside where he's sore and stretched.\nThe wolf makes high-pitched, short whimpers as he finishes, and Stiles' mouth opens in a soundless o of shock when Derek's cock slicks deeper, riding on the wet mess he made inside him.\nAnd then he's tearing himself off of Stiles and Stiles is cold, hyperventilating, his ass feeling wrecked, wide open.\nHe gets turned over onto his back by force, barely gets to see the wild, distressed look in Derek's eyes before the Were ducks down and sheathes Stiles' cock in his mouth.\nStiles cries out, clawing at Derek's soft hair, the ground, fighting against the sudden intensity, the mind-breaking pleasure of being deep inside Derek's plush heat.\nHe hunches at his mouth twice and then screws up and bursts, sobbing into the dirt.\nDerek's mouth purrs sweetly at his taste.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes him a long while to come back to himself. He lies on his back with his palm to his stomach, drifting in and out.\nThen he finally sits up, finds his pants and underwear pulled inside-out at his ankles.\nHis ass feels...strange. Empty. Wet.\nShe scrambles to pull his jeans back into place, up over his ass and then he sees Derek nearby, back to him, hunched over his knees. Angsting about something.\nHe creeps over carefully, rests his head on Derek's shoulder and whispers \"You ok?\"\nDerek lets on a sigh. \"They're going to know that I came out here and hunted you.\"\n\"Is that bad?\" Stiles wonders. Because he can't see how what they did is bad.\nDerek shoots him a frustrated look, eyebrows heavy, tucked together. \"Yes. It's...weird.\"\nStiles frowns. \"How is it weird? It was consensual--\"\n\"No, it's just,\" Derek sounds exasperated. \"It's just kind of...\" then he grimaces, struggling to say it.\n\"Kind of?\" Stiles prompts.\nSo Derek whispers a low and embarrassed \"Kinky,\" like he's saying a bad word in church.\nStiles' eyebrows lift. \"Kinky,\" he says.\n\"Shhhh, yes,\" Derek says, annoyed.\n\"Oh my god,\" Stiles laugh and collapses onto Derek's back. He hangs there, laughing. Derek growls at him.\nHe lets it go when he sees how miserable Derek is, starts rubbing circles into his back. \"It was something we both wanted, we both needed. And I don't feel bad about it. And honestly, if it doesn't happen again I'm going to be disappointed.\"\nDerek shoots him a look over his shoulder, considering.\n\"So Laura ribs you for a few days. We're having great, mutually enjoyable sex. If she thinks that's kinky, her and Thomas are probably having some boring-ass sex.\"\nDerek snorts, his ears blushing a little.\nAnd then his eyes widen and he pulls Stiles onto his lap. \"Are you ok?\" he asks, face tight with worry.\n\"What?\" Stiles asks, and then says \"Oh, you mean...yeah. I wanted you to, dude. It was good. My ass is a little sore but you didn't push it. You gave me what I wanted.\"\nDerek looks his face over critically, like he expects to find a lie there, a tell. When he doesn't, his face goes placid and self-pleased. He smiles a little like he's done something awesome all on his own, not like he's just had sex with Stiles.\nStiles cuffs him in the cheek. \"Stop looking like the cat who got the cream, we did this together.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey walk back to the house through the sun-warm field, holding hands through swarms of lazy gnats. Derek's whole everything is different, looser, confident, relieved. His hair is also sticking up in the back and there is a leaf waving in it.\nStiles smiles to himself, squeezes the Were's hand.\n\"Should we wash off?\" he asks at the brook and Derek holds him tighter, shakes his head.\n\"Dude, we have to stink,\" Stiles complains but Derek marches him onward. He can see someone in the kitchen, walking past the picture window.\n\"You smell like me. Like my mate. I want them to--\" Derek stammers, looks at Stiles like Stiles can finish his thought. Stiles waits.\n\"--to meet you,\" he finally says and shrugs.\nStiles sighs, checks their hips together. And then he thinks of Ally, of Scott and Scott's doofy smile.\n\"Will you let me bring my friends over, to meet you? They won't be able to smell that we're mates, but they'll want to celebrate it anyway.\"\nDerek nods, but looks worried.\n\"Ally was going to have a shoot-out with her crazy extended family to save you,\" Stiles tells him. \"Anyway, I just lost my virginity in the woods and we're walking back to your Alpha mom's house while I reek of sex with you. All this after I got you nearly exterminated last night--\"\nDerek's eyes widen and he says \"Virginity??\"\nStiles ends up tipped into the grass, laughing, Derek scrambling to kiss him all over his face, to soothe him, chastising \"You should have told me, Stiles!\""
